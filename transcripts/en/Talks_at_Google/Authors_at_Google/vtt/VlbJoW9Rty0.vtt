00:00:07.212 --> 00:00:08.420
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.800
Welcome to talks at Google
in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.059
Today, it's my great pleasure
to introduce Max Tegmark.

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.890
Dr. Tegmark is an
MIT physics professor

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.100
who loves thinking about
life's big questions.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.570
He is author or co-author of
more than 200 technical papers,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.770
and has worked with the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.240
collaboration on galaxy
clustering, shared

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.070
the first prize in
"Science" magazine's

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.910
"Breakthrough of the Year 2003."

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:44.250
He's here today to discuss his
book, newly out in paperback,

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:47.390
"Our Mathematical Universe--
My Quest for the Ultimate

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.220
Nature of Reality."

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.520
This book is his quest to
explore the ultimate nature

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.010
of reality, from the microcosm,
to our universe, and beyond.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.440
This sounds like a
pretty big undertaking.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.700
So we'd better let
him get right to it.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.209
Please join me in
welcoming Max Tegmark.

00:01:07.209 --> 00:01:07.709
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:07.709 --> 00:01:10.410
MAX TEGMARK: Thank you so much.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.280
It's a great
pleasure to be here.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.320
You guys at Google
like to think big.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.180
Today, I want to encourage you
to think really big, because we

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.620
humans are really the
masters of underestimation.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.770
We've repeatedly underestimated
not only the size of our cosmos

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.530
again, and again, and again,
realizing that everything

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.240
we knew existed was just a
small part of a much grander

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.470
structure-- a planet, a solar
system, a galaxy, a universe,

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.700
and perhaps a hierarchy
of parallel universes.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.820
But we've also
repeatedly underestimated

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.230
the power of our human mind
to understand our cosmos.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.740
And it's through
this understanding,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.950
of course, that we've also
been able to develop so much

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.130
cool technology like what you
guys are doing here at Google.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.470
So let's start with the first
kind of underestimation,

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.050
underestimating
the size of things.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.020
And let's just remind ourselves
of what we humans have managed

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.820
to figure out so far during
the first 13.8 billion years

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.250
of cosmic history about
our place in space.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.100
So let's start here
in the Himalayas

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.820
and go for a little ride.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.970
As we zoom out,
when Eratosthenes,

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.450
over 2,000 years ago,
first figured out

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.589
the size of this great ball,
Earth, that we live on,

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:26.130
people were pretty
shocked by how big

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.245
it was, that it was actually
40,000 kilometers all

00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:29.870
the way around.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.290
But of course, now we think
of this as pretty puny

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.120
in comparison.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.070
What's cool about both
what Eratosthenes did

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.400
and what his contemporaries
did when they figured

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.410
out the distance to the
moon, and the sun, and so on

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.850
was that they actually did
it without rocket power,

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.040
without even having telescopes,
just with mental power,

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.350
letting their minds
fly, and using

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.390
really clever
observations with angles,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.600
and a lot of neat logic.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.330
Of course, it was this
kind of cleverness

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.900
which gave us rocket power,
which in turn gave us

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.610
these satellites, which you
can see orbiting Earth here.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:01.670
I love this video.

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:03.199
This is made by
the American Museum

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:04.490
of Natural History in New York.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.900
Because everything
is exactly to scale.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.620
So, for example,
shortly when the moon

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.379
comes into view-- this is
the moon's orbit there,

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:15.170
seen as the white line--
you won't actually

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:17.500
see the moon, because
it's to scale.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.940
That's how big the
moon's orbit is.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:22.867
And then we're going to see
the sun coming into view, which

00:03:22.867 --> 00:03:24.700
of course, is so far
away that, as you know,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.690
it's taken eight minutes for
the sunlight to reach us.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.430
So we're seeing the sun
the way it was in the past.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.430
If someone looked at
us from the sun now,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.100
they would see this talk
not having started yet.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.540
Raise your hand if
you know anybody

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.760
who was born before 1925.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.260
Cool.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.779
So if we think about these
people, my grandma for example,

00:03:48.779 --> 00:03:50.820
it's interesting to reflect
what kind of universe

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.486
they grew up in.

00:03:51.486 --> 00:03:53.090
It was a much smaller
one than ours.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.505
They knew about
the solar system.

00:03:55.505 --> 00:03:58.090
Pluto hadn't been demoted
yet, so they knew,

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.610
they thought there
were nine planets.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:02.210
They knew there was
this wispy thing

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.751
in the sky they
called the Milky Way.

00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:06.460
But they didn't know that
there were other galaxies yet.

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.980
Because that only became
settled in 1925 by Edwin Hubble.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.650
That's how recently we
got a vast expansion again

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.370
on the size of things.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.970
It takes hundreds of
years for starlight

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.524
to reach us from
typical stars you

00:04:18.524 --> 00:04:20.399
might see in Cambridge
tonight if it's clear.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.875
So someone there
would not see us.

00:04:21.875 --> 00:04:23.750
They wouldn't see anything
to do with Google,

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:26.030
but they might see the Boston
Tea Party, for instance.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.630
This galaxy that
we're a part of,

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.430
this incredible pizza
shaped structure

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.930
with hundreds of
billions of stars,

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.450
is so vast that it takes
100,000 years for life

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.180
to traverse it
from side to side.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.310
Yet, as we zoom out,
that's just one galaxy

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.630
out of enormously large numbers.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.807
Because every other dot here
in this data from the Sloan

00:04:42.807 --> 00:04:45.140
Digital Sky Survey that I've
had a lot of fun working on

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.970
with my colleagues
is another galaxy.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.360
Every dot in here has
hundreds of billions

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.940
of stars of its own.

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.360
And even these galaxies,
these much bigger structures,

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.320
are again part of even
larger structures.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:58.100
You can see, they come
here in groups, clusters,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.770
super clusters, and
enormous filaments,

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.750
with the Sloan--
Great Wall, and so on.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:07.160
So again, things we
thought were huge

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.780
turn out to be part of
something even grander.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.330
And even this,
even this massive,

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:16.460
three dimensional map of
galaxies, which when we first

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.130
made it was the largest
3D map of its time,

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:22.320
is part of something even
bigger, what we affectionately

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.830
call our universe, or
our observable universe,

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.210
this ball here.

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:31.100
And if you promise to be kind,
and loving, and gentle to it,

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.610
you're welcome to play with it.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.860
So so far, everything
was pretty intuitive.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.500
The farther away we looked,
the more stuff we saw,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.830
more and more galaxies.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.940
But what on Earth
is this sphere,

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.910
this green, yellow, round thing?

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.681
To understand that, we cannot
just speak of our place

00:05:49.681 --> 00:05:50.180
in space.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.970
We have to understand
also our place in time.

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.540
Fortunately, we can
learn a great deal

00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:58.970
about our place in time, simply
by looking out into space.

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.430
Because as we just
mentioned, we see the past.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:02.730
The sky is like a time machine.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.620
We see the sun eight minutes
ago, a lot of stars hundreds

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:07.350
or even thousands of years ago.

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:10.630
And many of the galaxies here
in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field,

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.520
we see them billions
of years ago,

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:16.150
even 12 billion
years ago, or more.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:19.680
So by looking at things at
very different distances,

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:23.830
we can put together a
very interesting history

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:25.272
of our universe.

00:06:25.272 --> 00:06:27.480
And what have we learned
from these kind of pictures?

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.030
We've learned something
which I find very surprising.

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.980
And just to make you appreciate
how surprising it is,

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.400
I want you for a moment to
imagine that each one of you

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.800
is a galaxy, and I'm looking
at you now with my telescope.

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.330
And I see something
kind of funny.

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.426
You guys here in the front row
are all about 100 years old,

00:06:43.426 --> 00:06:44.300
as far as I can tell.

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.675
You look healthy, but about 100.

00:06:46.675 --> 00:06:48.660
And you guys are
90, and then 80.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:51.170
And then I see
farther back, a line

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:53.300
of teenagers, a
bunch of toddlers.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.590
And on the second
last row, I see

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:57.840
only infants who can't walk yet.

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:01.140
And the very last room
here of this lecture hall

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.550
is empty completely.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.630
Why did you guys have this
OCD idea to arrange your,

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.391
self by age when you came in?

00:07:09.391 --> 00:07:10.890
And as if that
weren't weird enough,

00:07:10.890 --> 00:07:14.910
the whole rear wall of this
room is glowing with microwaves.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.730
And even more odd,
you're all blushing.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:18.546
Why?

00:07:18.546 --> 00:07:20.640
Was it something I said?

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.640
You guys look just
a little bit pink.

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.810
But those in the back are
tomato red in the face.

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:27.860
This is exactly
what we actually see

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.110
when we look at these
galaxies with our telescopes.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.870
Why?

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:32.620
Well, first of all,
it's easy to see

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.170
how the business with them
being arranged by age works,

00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:39.930
because nearby, we
see galaxies the way

00:07:39.930 --> 00:07:43.110
they actually more or
less are these days,

00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:45.420
or were pretty recently.

00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:47.950
Whereas farther away,
we see galaxies the way

00:07:47.950 --> 00:07:49.400
they were very,
very long ago when

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:50.608
our universe are still young.

00:07:50.608 --> 00:07:53.490
So they haven't had time
to age and grow up yet.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:56.640
We see smaller galaxies,
little baby galaxies.

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.480
They're very young.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.270
Still farther away--
and this is what

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:03.360
corresponds to the
empty, last row

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:05.780
of the room-- we see
no galaxies at all.

00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:08.470
Because we're looking at things
that happened so long ago

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:11.400
that galaxies hadn't
yet had time to form.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:14.450
All there was back then
was the raw material

00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:16.920
out of which galaxies
later were formed,

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.110
mostly hydrogen gas,
which is transparent.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:22.420
So we just don't see
it in the picture.

00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:25.480
Now, why is it that
you're all blushing?

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.450
Well, you know, if you
walk down to the I-93,

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:33.400
at least on a day with less
snow, that the cars will go--

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.049
[MIMICS SPEEDING CARS]

00:08:36.049 --> 00:08:36.789
They don't go--

00:08:36.789 --> 00:08:38.683
[UPWARD INFLECTING SOUNDS]

00:08:39.638 --> 00:08:41.429
Because the Doppler
effect says, of course,

00:08:41.429 --> 00:08:43.970
that the frequency goes
down when something

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:46.705
is receding from you,
moving away from you.

00:08:46.705 --> 00:08:47.760
Ehh.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:51.350
And that works for any
waves, not just sound waves.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.920
It works for light, as well.

00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.910
So a galaxy flying
away from you will

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:58.500
have its light stretched to
long, lower frequencies, which

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.722
makes it look redder.

00:08:59.722 --> 00:09:01.180
We call this redshift
in astronomy.

00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:03.450
And that's why you guys all look
like you're blushing, the fact

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.199
that you're all flying
away from me, which

00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:09.259
is why Edwin Hubble said, hey,
our universe is expanding.

00:09:09.259 --> 00:09:11.800
And the fact that you guys in
the back are blushing much more

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.990
means you're flying away faster.

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:16.920
How long ago were
you guys all here?

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:17.670
Well, that's easy.

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:22.740
Just look at how far you are
and compare that with the speed.

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:26.430
Since it turns out that there's
an interesting relation,

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:28.320
that the galaxies twice
as far typically fly

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.960
away twice as fast.

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.870
You get the same
answer, whatever galaxy

00:09:31.870 --> 00:09:33.320
you look at, pretty much.

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.780
It was around here-- it seems,
if you extrapolate backwards--

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.160
about 14 billion years ago.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.750
If you do it really carefully
and take into account

00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:43.140
the fact that it accelerated
and decelerated a bit,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:46.760
you get 13.8 billion years
ago, something really weird

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.320
happened.

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.070
We still don't know exactly
what it was that happened.

00:09:49.070 --> 00:09:50.640
But we have a nice name for it.

00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:53.630
We call it our Big Bang.

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:55.310
But what we know
a great deal about

00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.737
is what happened after that,
during the subsequent 13.8

00:09:57.737 --> 00:09:58.320
billion years.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.861
Because as I've
said, we can actually

00:09:59.861 --> 00:10:03.550
watch most of that unfold
with our telescopes.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:06.550
And since we see
everything flying apart,

00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:08.380
that must mean that
this expansion also

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:11.170
affected the gas
between the galaxies.

00:10:11.170 --> 00:10:13.180
If you expand the
gas, it cools off.

00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.420
That's how air conditioning
works, of course.

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:17.540
So my universe got
cooler and cooler.

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:19.880
Which means that as we
go backward in time,

00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.830
this gas would be
hotter and hotter.

00:10:22.830 --> 00:10:24.692
If you take an ice cube
and you heat it up,

00:10:24.692 --> 00:10:25.650
what does it turn into?

00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:29.110
Water.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.140
A liquid, that's right.

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.610
If you heat up a
liquid, it actually

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:37.370
turns into a gas-- steam,
in the case of liquid water.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:42.090
If you heat up a gas, what
does it turn into eventually?

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:43.420
Plasma, that's right.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:47.420
So what we can predict is
simply from this expansion

00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.171
of our universe, if
we go far enough back,

00:10:49.171 --> 00:10:51.128
if things were more and
more squished together,

00:10:51.128 --> 00:10:53.590
eventually all this hydrogen
gas would have been a plasma.

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:55.480
So what it would
look like is this.

00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.690
A plasma is opaque.

00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:58.060
You can't see through it.

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.310
So it should look to us as if
beyond on all these galaxies.

00:11:02.310 --> 00:11:04.930
First, through this empty
region with no galaxies.

00:11:04.930 --> 00:11:08.759
And then you should
see a plasma screen.

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:11.050
But you should see this in
whatever direction you look,

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.100
of course.

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.100
Whatever direction you peer, and
you're looking far enough back

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:15.475
in time, there's
a plasma screen.

00:11:15.475 --> 00:11:18.120
So it looks to us like we're
actually surrounded by a plasma

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.090
ball that we can
photograph from the inside.

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:23.230
And when this idea
was first put forth

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:26.830
by George Gamow and others
in the '40s and '50s,

00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:30.160
people felt this was totally
nutty, and way too extreme

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.620
an extrapolation of things we
knew to really take seriously.

00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.480
But then it was found in
1965, and got the Nobel Prize.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:38.780
And now, we've taken these
amazing precision pictures

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.195
of this.

00:11:40.195 --> 00:11:43.460
This is from the Wilkinson
Microwave Anisotropy Probe.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.020
It's a fantastic NASA satellite
for a cost of $0.40 per

00:11:47.020 --> 00:11:50.590
American, one of the highest
impact science experiments

00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:51.399
ever.

00:11:51.399 --> 00:11:53.690
And the one thing you've got
to worry about when you're

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:56.730
taking baby pictures of our
universe from 13.8 billion

00:11:56.730 --> 00:12:01.390
years ago, when our cosmos
was only 400,000 years old

00:12:01.390 --> 00:12:03.670
is did they screw up somehow?

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:05.810
This is a very hard measurement.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.760
In fact, here, you
see these patterns.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.410
They had to stretch the color
scale by a factor of 100,000,

00:12:11.410 --> 00:12:13.460
because the differences
in temperature

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.660
are only a thousandth of a
percent from place to place.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:21.400
Fortunately, another team--
independent technology,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:24.710
independent people-- now have
made it an even better map.

00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:25.899
So we can compare.

00:12:25.899 --> 00:12:27.440
This is the Planck
data that was just

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.070
released last year
in its latest format.

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.780
And it's really fun to just sit
and flip these back and forth

00:12:33.780 --> 00:12:36.180
and see A+ for both experiments.

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:40.720
See all of the places where
there's a big hotspot?

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:43.160
It's still a hotspot, even
when you go from the three

00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:45.710
megapixels to the 50 megapixels.

00:12:45.710 --> 00:12:47.170
It's similar for the cold spots.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:49.560
So looking at this map,
which are basically

00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:52.160
the cosmic DNA that encode
within them information

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.530
about what's going
to happen later,

00:12:54.530 --> 00:12:57.610
you can see that where there
is more stuff, the clump back

00:12:57.610 --> 00:13:02.370
then, you can predict that later
on that will form galaxies.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.365
And where there
is less stuff, you

00:13:04.365 --> 00:13:08.810
can predict that's going
to turn into a giant void.

00:13:08.810 --> 00:13:11.556
So we've learned a
lot about our cosmos,

00:13:11.556 --> 00:13:14.180
thanks to the technology that's
given us these better pictures.

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.400
But it's important
to be humble and be

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.910
mindful of how much
we have left to learn.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:21.460
For example, in
this quest-- Google

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:23.510
likes to map stuff, of course.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.220
So you have Google Earth.

00:13:25.220 --> 00:13:28.390
And now, you also put our
Sloan Digital Sky Survey data

00:13:28.390 --> 00:13:30.020
into Google Sky.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.120
But I would like to have
Google Universe, frankly.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.980
Can you guys do that,
where it can just

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:36.730
fly to any part of our
observable universe

00:13:36.730 --> 00:13:38.260
and see what's going on there?

00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:40.900
And look how little
we've accomplished.

00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:42.830
All those galaxy maps
we flew around then

00:13:42.830 --> 00:13:46.940
are just this tiny part near the
center that are well covered.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:48.900
We have some sparse
outliers in here.

00:13:48.900 --> 00:13:53.739
And then there is this cosmic
microwave background radiation

00:13:53.739 --> 00:13:55.405
that we just talked
about, which is just

00:13:55.405 --> 00:13:58.560
a photograph of the
outside surface.

00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.780
I want to map all of it.

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.440
There's 100 times
more information

00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.490
or more in there to be had.

00:14:03.490 --> 00:14:04.610
How can we do that?

00:14:04.610 --> 00:14:06.160
Can we just take
pictures of galaxies

00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:08.950
here by building
really big telescopes?

00:14:08.950 --> 00:14:12.210
No, because there
weren't any galaxies

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:13.710
that long ago that
had formed yet.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:17.117
There's just the hydrogen gas
out of which they later formed.

00:14:17.117 --> 00:14:17.950
That's the bad news.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:19.490
But the good news
is hydrogen gas

00:14:19.490 --> 00:14:22.250
itself can also be photographed,
because it gives off

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:23.540
radio waves.

00:14:23.540 --> 00:14:26.310
They're 21 centimeters
long when they're emitted,

00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:29.110
and then they reach us,
and they get stretched out.

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:31.202
We can pick them up
with radio telescopes.

00:14:31.202 --> 00:14:34.330
And the wavelength of the
waves when they get here

00:14:34.330 --> 00:14:37.150
tell us how far
away they came from.

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:39.640
So we can build up
three dimensional maps.

00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:43.510
And we've had a lot of fun
at MIT looking at a way

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:46.470
to do this much cheaper
than by building

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:50.350
this ginormous, big dish that
points in various directions.

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:52.340
So let me show you
in just two minutes

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.430
how you can make your
own radio telescope,

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.090
at least if you move fast.

00:15:18.210 --> 00:15:20.590
That was [INAUDIBLE],
right down the road.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:53.640
So we've had a lot
of fun with this.

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:58.070
And the technologies we
built this to test out,

00:16:58.070 --> 00:16:59.790
I'm happy to report,
have worked so well

00:16:59.790 --> 00:17:02.640
that we're now teaming up with
a bunch of other universities

00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.339
across the US to build a
dramatically larger one,

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:07.480
starting to build
in South Africa.

00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:11.940
We want to cover many
football fields worth of land.

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:14.410
And what you can see
here is that this

00:17:14.410 --> 00:17:16.400
looks really different
from a normal telescope.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.441
That's why it's so cheap.

00:17:17.441 --> 00:17:19.450
Just get a bunch of mass
produced little things,

00:17:19.450 --> 00:17:21.430
hook them together, and
let the computer figure

00:17:21.430 --> 00:17:23.990
out what the sky looks
like, just from the volts

00:17:23.990 --> 00:17:25.800
that you measure, and
all these antennas.

00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:28.829
I think about this as the same
philosophy as Google Earth.

00:17:28.829 --> 00:17:30.370
Instead of first
figuring out, I want

00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.530
to know what's going
on there, actually

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:35.900
going there and looking, you
just image the whole thing.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.190
And then you can
figure out later

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.250
what part you're
most interested in.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:44.100
This radio telescope, since
the computer is figuring out

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:46.540
what part of the sky you're
interested in right now

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:48.320
by combining volts
in different ways,

00:17:48.320 --> 00:17:51.080
it just measures
everything, all the volts,

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.280
which means you're gathering
information from the entire sky

00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.250
all the time.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:56.940
It's omnidirectional.

00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.170
That's why we call
it the omniscope.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:01.930
And this is the
future, in my opinion,

00:18:01.930 --> 00:18:04.020
of this quest to
make the biggest map

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.830
ever of our universe in 3D.

00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:08.840
And we need this kind
of additional data,

00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:11.590
because we have a
lot of questions

00:18:11.590 --> 00:18:14.710
left we haven't answered, even
though we've come a long way.

00:18:14.710 --> 00:18:17.480
For example, we have no clue
what 95% of our universe

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:18.550
is made out of.

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:23.620
And we would like to know better
what happened before this epoch

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:26.280
with a plasma screen and the
cosmic microwave background.

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.610
So let me take a
little bit of time

00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:30.110
to update you on
that, because there

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:33.972
was a sensational announcement
last Friday, which

00:18:33.972 --> 00:18:35.430
was in "The New
York Times" and all

00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:37.700
over the world about inflation.

00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:40.020
And this is something I've
had a lot of fun working on,

00:18:40.020 --> 00:18:42.170
and I want to share with you.

00:18:42.170 --> 00:18:48.780
So last March, there was a big
splash all around the world.

00:18:48.780 --> 00:18:50.780
There was a press conference
I was at at Harvard

00:18:50.780 --> 00:18:54.900
where a team announced, we
have found the first evidence

00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:58.396
of something super exciting
supporting this idea

00:18:58.396 --> 00:18:59.770
that our whole
universe underwent

00:18:59.770 --> 00:19:01.650
this process called inflation.

00:19:01.650 --> 00:19:03.320
Pretty quickly,
a bunch of people

00:19:03.320 --> 00:19:07.370
started pouring cold water
on this and saying maybe

00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:10.220
the data wasn't as
compelling as they said.

00:19:10.220 --> 00:19:11.290
What's going on?

00:19:11.290 --> 00:19:12.820
What is inflation, first of all?

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.720
Well, inflation is the
most popular theory

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.620
we have for what
happened earlier on, what

00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.820
created all this hot,
expanding plasma.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:23.260
And the basic idea
of inflation-- this

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.060
is how I think about it.

00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:28.180
It's that our universe
began just like you guys.

00:19:28.180 --> 00:19:34.392
You were originally 1 cell,
then 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 cells.

00:19:34.392 --> 00:19:35.350
You just kept doubling.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:40.430
Fortunately, you
didn't keep doubling

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:41.810
for nine months,
which would have

00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:42.940
been very painful for your mom.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.030
Because after nine months of
doubling about once per day,

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.405
you would have had a mass
greater than the whole universe

00:19:47.405 --> 00:19:48.450
that we're in.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.200
What happened instead
was once you reached

00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:51.840
the size of about
5 centimeters, you

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.436
stopped this exponential
doubling, this crazy doubling,

00:19:54.436 --> 00:19:56.310
and started growing in
a more leisurely rate.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.750
And this is exactly
what inflation

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:01.675
says our universe did.

00:20:01.675 --> 00:20:05.077
It started-- tiny
subatomic speck of stuff,

00:20:05.077 --> 00:20:06.160
doubled, doubled, doubled.

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:08.570
And when it was
about 5 centimeters,

00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:10.110
the doubling stopped.

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:12.410
And it started
growing more slowly.

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:15.690
Inertia kept it flying apart.

00:20:15.690 --> 00:20:17.580
And these two curves
look very similar.

00:20:17.580 --> 00:20:19.150
I promise you, I
didn't fudge it.

00:20:19.150 --> 00:20:22.880
When I made this for the book,
I actually spent more time

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:25.550
than I care to admit
looking up data

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.820
from prenatal observations of
baby growth and plotted here.

00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.330
That's why it's a
little bit wiggly.

00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:36.199
I have no idea why we have this
funny 5 centimeter coincidence,

00:20:36.199 --> 00:20:37.740
why they have the
same vertical axis.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:43.980
I can't even think of an
anthropic explanation for it.

00:20:43.980 --> 00:20:45.830
But the x-axes are
kind of different.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:47.180
You doubled about once per day.

00:20:47.180 --> 00:20:49.010
Our universe doubled
once every maybe 10

00:20:49.010 --> 00:20:52.490
to the minus 36
seconds or thereabouts.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:54.650
If you double something
frequently, of course,

00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:58.270
you'll soon get a
huge amount of stuff.

00:20:58.270 --> 00:21:01.330
And moreover, the stuff will
be moving apart very fast,

00:21:01.330 --> 00:21:03.630
because expansion
speeds also doubled.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:07.080
So inflation is an idea which
actually causes the Big Bang.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:09.370
You take something which
is not big and not banging,

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.536
you're not moving very much.

00:21:10.536 --> 00:21:13.240
You make something
huge expand very fast.

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.260
And I want to first
emphasize that there's

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:19.160
a lot of misconceptions
about this.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.900
Even in "The New York
Times" article here

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:23.290
that my friend, Alan
Guth, wrote for MIT,

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:28.190
they say in the instance
after the Big Bang inflation

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:29.520
happened-- no.

00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.500
That's not at all
what inflation said.

00:21:31.500 --> 00:21:34.010
Inflation rather
creates the Big Bang.

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:36.150
It's the mechanism
that takes something

00:21:36.150 --> 00:21:38.820
which is neither big
nor bang-ey-- it's

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:41.770
more like a cold little
swoosh-- and creates a big bang.

00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.780
It sounds like black magic,
the way I described it.

00:21:47.780 --> 00:21:49.280
If we had another
half hour, I could

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.781
tell you the whole
mechanics of this

00:21:50.781 --> 00:21:52.530
and how this is actually
not something you

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:53.597
have to put in by hand.

00:21:53.597 --> 00:21:55.180
It's actually something
that comes out

00:21:55.180 --> 00:21:57.350
of Einstein's equations
of general relativity

00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:59.600
if you put in only one little
assumption that you have

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:02.746
a certain kind of substance,
which is really hard to dilute.

00:22:02.746 --> 00:22:04.770
You can ask me
about it afterwards.

00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.100
But for now, if you just
take the predictions of this,

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:08.960
you can ask, how
can you test them?

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.460
It predicts a
whole lot of stuff.

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.500
It predicts that
there was a Big Bang,

00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.804
that things are expanding.

00:22:13.804 --> 00:22:15.470
And it predicts a
whole bunch of numbers

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:17.011
that I and many of
my colleagues have

00:22:17.011 --> 00:22:18.344
had a lot of fun measuring.

00:22:18.344 --> 00:22:20.760
For example, how that space
should be really, really flat.

00:22:20.760 --> 00:22:23.440
Well, we've measured
that now and tested it

00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.830
to better than 1% accuracy.

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:26.730
And that's why Alan Guth
looks so happy here,

00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:28.162
maybe, because it works.

00:22:28.162 --> 00:22:29.620
It predicts a bunch
of other stuff,

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.650
and it predicts all
these funny patterns

00:22:31.650 --> 00:22:34.910
you saw in the microwave
background, the properties,

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:35.790
really nicely.

00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:37.350
But there was one
more prediction

00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:41.640
that it never actually
tested, which was often

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.680
considered the holy
grail of inflation.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:47.470
If we saw this, this should send
Alan Guth, and Andrei Linde,

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:49.640
and perhaps some other
pioneers of inflation

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.399
to Stockholm to collect
the Nobel Prize.

00:22:51.399 --> 00:22:53.190
Because there was no
other reasonable thing

00:22:53.190 --> 00:22:54.850
that could have
produced that signal.

00:22:54.850 --> 00:22:56.100
What is that signal?

00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:57.825
Well, we call it B-modes.

00:22:57.825 --> 00:23:00.080
It's a very geeky name.

00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:04.067
And the way I think about it
is if you take an image-- Alan

00:23:04.067 --> 00:23:06.650
Guth and Andrei Linde here were
blissfully unaware that I took

00:23:06.650 --> 00:23:09.730
this photo at a
party in Sweden--

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:14.940
if you make gravitational
waves, distortions

00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.280
and the very fabric
of space time itself,

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:21.000
and you send them between you
and this background image,

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:22.329
it'll look distorted.

00:23:22.329 --> 00:23:24.120
Because of course, when
space is distorted,

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:27.100
then the light waves get bent.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.730
If there's a gravitational wave
now going between me and you--

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:32.250
(MUMBLING) I will get
distorted this way.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.746
We can test exactly
this by looking

00:23:33.746 --> 00:23:36.370
at these pictures, the pictures
of the cosmic micro background,

00:23:36.370 --> 00:23:38.250
the baby photos of
our universe and see,

00:23:38.250 --> 00:23:41.320
do they look distorted by some
kind of gravitational wave?

00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.040
Because the idea is when
you work through the math,

00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.440
you'd that inflation, this crazy
doubling of space early on,

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.852
was so violent.

00:23:50.852 --> 00:23:53.060
They had so much violence
in the very fabric of space

00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.351
that it actually would cause
these gravitational waves.

00:23:55.351 --> 00:23:57.490
It would cause these
ripples, these distortions,

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:01.760
in the very fabric
of space itself.

00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:04.869
And so you can look for them.

00:24:04.869 --> 00:24:06.410
It turns out that
the best way to see

00:24:06.410 --> 00:24:09.405
the distortions is to look
through this polarized light.

00:24:09.405 --> 00:24:11.530
Because then you get rid
of a lot of other effects,

00:24:11.530 --> 00:24:14.830
and there's a certain
kind of signal.

00:24:14.830 --> 00:24:17.800
For the geekiest part of
the audience, what you do

00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:20.530
is you take the polarization.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:24.360
And just like you could take
vectors and decompose them

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.360
in a part with no curl,
and no divergence,

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:29.390
and the part that
has no divergence,

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:32.499
we call the magnetic
fields, or B in physics,

00:24:32.499 --> 00:24:34.540
you can do the analogous
thing for these vectors,

00:24:34.540 --> 00:24:37.586
these polarization things,
and two dimensions,

00:24:37.586 --> 00:24:38.960
and a curved sky,
and blah, blah.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.501
Don't worry about
the details at all.

00:24:40.501 --> 00:24:44.220
Inflation predicts that if
you do this geeky process,

00:24:44.220 --> 00:24:47.820
you can make a picture like this
where there should be signal,

00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:50.820
for which we have no
other explanation.

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:52.430
There's no other
known physics that

00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:53.805
would produce
anything like this.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:59.540
And last March, 10
months ago, right here

00:24:59.540 --> 00:25:02.800
in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
it was announced, boom--

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.394
it's been found by
the BICEP2 team.

00:25:05.394 --> 00:25:07.310
And when they measured
the detailed properties

00:25:07.310 --> 00:25:12.990
of this-- plot whose units
and axes really don't matter,

00:25:12.990 --> 00:25:16.060
except for the fact
that this red curve here

00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:20.100
is a prediction from inflation
and the black things are

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.340
measurements-- people
got very excited.

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.440
But then people
started wondering,

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:27.800
is it really true
that what they've seen

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:29.660
comes from our baby universe?

00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.710
Or could there be
some other source

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.280
of microwaves that got
added to that along the way?

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:39.800
And suspicion started to fall
on dust from our own galaxy.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:43.350
Last fall, in Europe, this
Planck satellite dimension

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:46.717
that had the 50 megapixel
picture of the baby universe

00:25:46.717 --> 00:25:48.050
released some data saying, yeah.

00:25:48.050 --> 00:25:49.830
It might be that
everything they saw

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:52.000
was dust, or maybe half of it.

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.180
We don't know yet.

00:25:54.180 --> 00:26:01.540
Just this Monday, three days
ago, this paper came out,

00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.730
February 2 here, where
what you see on the x-axis

00:26:04.730 --> 00:26:07.470
is the amplitude of
these gravitational waves

00:26:07.470 --> 00:26:09.020
from inflation.

00:26:09.020 --> 00:26:13.970
Which Alan Guth will be
very happy if it's not 0,

00:26:13.970 --> 00:26:15.950
because that means
inflation happened.

00:26:15.950 --> 00:26:18.230
On the vertical axis,
you see the amplitude

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:21.590
of signal caused by
dust in our galaxy.

00:26:21.590 --> 00:26:24.590
And what you see here is
what the data prefers.

00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:27.580
Look, for example, at the
data they take most seriously

00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:30.940
here is shown by heavy lines.

00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:34.240
This is a 68% chance that
the truth is in there,

00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:36.130
95% chance that it's
in there somewhere.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:39.470
And you see, there's a slight
preference for inflation

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:43.460
to have happened, for this
number to not be zero.

00:26:43.460 --> 00:26:46.139
And if this is the
truth, for example,

00:26:46.139 --> 00:26:47.680
that will actually
be a very nice fit

00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:49.980
for a lot of simple
inflation models.

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:52.190
But you can absolutely
not look at this and say,

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.170
we have proof of
inflation from this.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:59.620
Because there's more than a 5%
chance that the truth is zero

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.400
and there was just a bit of
a statistical fluke here.

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.750
So what have we learned so far?

00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:06.537
Well, this has been a real
roller coaster ride, of course.

00:27:06.537 --> 00:27:08.120
This is not at all
what the team hoped

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.350
when they made the
announcement last spring.

00:27:10.350 --> 00:27:13.450
They had underestimated
how much dust there

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:17.020
was, or overestimated their
confidence in their models.

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:22.170
Right now, all we can say is
we don't have the smoking gun

00:27:22.170 --> 00:27:24.330
evidence at all that
inflation happened.

00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.670
On the other hand,
inflation used

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.830
to be the most popular
theory for inflation

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:30.480
before this even took place.

00:27:30.480 --> 00:27:33.510
And there's absolutely nothing
here arguing against inflation.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:36.007
If anything, there's
a little hint there,

00:27:36.007 --> 00:27:37.840
if you squint a little
bit, and have a beer,

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.540
and then squint some more,
that it might already

00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:42.531
have started to see the
signal of inflation.

00:27:42.531 --> 00:27:43.030
We'll see.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:46.830
The good news is that
both this team measuring

00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:49.050
from the south pole and
a number of other groups

00:27:49.050 --> 00:27:52.390
is a super competitive field,
are making awesome experiments.

00:27:52.390 --> 00:27:55.940
And we should know a lot more
about this in the one or two

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:56.890
years to come here.

00:27:56.890 --> 00:28:01.330
So this is one of the hottest
frontiers in all of science.

00:28:01.330 --> 00:28:02.820
And it's very
audacious, frankly,

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:05.870
to think that we little humans
can sit here with our equations

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.670
and extrapolate them all
the way back not just

00:28:08.670 --> 00:28:10.620
to 400,000 years
after our Big Bang,

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:14.860
but back to 10 to the minus
20, minus 36 seconds, when

00:28:14.860 --> 00:28:16.860
everything out there
was squished together,

00:28:16.860 --> 00:28:23.160
less than the size of a proton,
and make predictions, and then

00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:25.750
even be able to test them.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:27.080
It's quite shocking.

00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:29.880
But that's exactly what
we're talking about here.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:33.450
So think big.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:36.570
Now, let's come back
to where we started.

00:28:36.570 --> 00:28:39.390
I said that we've underestimated
greatly the size of our cosmos.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:41.870
But I also said that we've
underestimated greatly

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:45.280
the capability of our human
minds to figure stuff out.

00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.200
Why is that that we've been
able to do so much more

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.780
than we thought?

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:51.900
Leonardo da Vinci would
have been so blown away

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.780
if he had known what you
guys at Google can do today.

00:28:55.780 --> 00:28:59.290
Where does this power come from?

00:28:59.290 --> 00:29:01.290
Yeah, the human mind is awesome.

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.510
This is certainly part of it.

00:29:03.510 --> 00:29:06.800
We didn't evolve to do
integrals or even send emails.

00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:09.520
But somehow, our mind is
so flexible that it can.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.700
But I don't think
that's the whole story.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:15.150
I think if you look back
at the roots of our success

00:29:15.150 --> 00:29:17.520
in science, there
are two really,

00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:20.160
really powerful ideas to
have helped us enormously.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:24.120
One is do experiments.

00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:26.920
In other words, measure a
bunch of numbers from nature.

00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:29.690
And the second is
less talked about.

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:33.050
When you have a
bunch of numbers,

00:29:33.050 --> 00:29:34.910
try to make mathematical
models of them.

00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:37.280
In other words, look for
mathematical patterns in there.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:39.160
Look for mathematical hints.

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.810
Because nature has,
again and again,

00:29:40.810 --> 00:29:43.010
dished out these kind
of hints in the form.

00:29:43.010 --> 00:29:46.510
That's the equations that I
teach down the road at MIT.

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:48.860
And that's what
really has enabled

00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:52.680
us to build this technology,
that we see these patterns

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:54.730
and can exploit them.

00:29:54.730 --> 00:29:55.890
This is an old insight.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.120
Pythagoras already said
over 2,000 years ago

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.890
that numbers rule our universe.

00:29:59.890 --> 00:30:02.060
And then Galileo 400
years ago famously said

00:30:02.060 --> 00:30:04.980
that our universe is
like a grand book written

00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:07.070
in the language of mathematics.

00:30:07.070 --> 00:30:08.320
But what does he mean by this?

00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:11.980
You look around, where is all
this math he's talking about?

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:15.170
I don't see any big
numbers written in the sky.

00:30:15.170 --> 00:30:17.070
But if you look more
closely at what he says,

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.695
he talks about how
this book is written

00:30:18.695 --> 00:30:20.480
in the language of
mathematics, and its characters

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:22.930
are triangles, circles, and
other geometric figures,

00:30:22.930 --> 00:30:24.440
et cetera.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.682
So geometric shapes,
geometry is also math.

00:30:26.682 --> 00:30:28.140
He's taking a
broader view of math.

00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.510
He's not talking about
math as just a bag

00:30:30.510 --> 00:30:32.380
of tricks for multiplying
numbers together

00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:34.930
or a sadistic form of
torture that schoolteachers

00:30:34.930 --> 00:30:36.920
invented to make us feel bad.

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:39.385
This is my mommy's view of math.

00:30:39.385 --> 00:30:41.300
He's looking at it
in a more broad way.

00:30:41.300 --> 00:30:43.160
And if you look for
patterns, then it's

00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:46.710
pretty obvious that yes,
nature's full of them.

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:48.180
Whatever you throw
up in the air,

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:49.805
it's going to move
in this shape, which

00:30:49.805 --> 00:30:51.360
we call a parabola.

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:54.480
And it'll be this very
simple quadratic equation,

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:55.670
y equals x squared.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:59.560
And if you look in space, again,
everything orbiting anything

00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.970
under gravity goes in this
shape, which is called an--

00:31:01.970 --> 00:31:02.350
AUDIENCE: Ellipse.

00:31:02.350 --> 00:31:02.830
MAX TEGMARK: --ellipse.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:04.205
And if you look
more closely, you

00:31:04.205 --> 00:31:05.996
can see that what we
learned in high school

00:31:05.996 --> 00:31:07.940
was the parabola isn't
actually a parabola.

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:10.000
It's just a small piece
of an ellipse, which

00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.180
is very well approximated
by a parabola.

00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:13.795
So it's all ellipses.

00:31:13.795 --> 00:31:14.295
Why?

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:19.060
And let me ask you a
little pop quiz here.

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:22.260
What tool was it that triggered
the discovery of these three

00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:27.890
things-- the planet Neptune,
the radio wave, and the Higgs

00:31:27.890 --> 00:31:28.390
boson?

00:31:28.390 --> 00:31:31.145
What tool was it that
triggered their discovery?

00:31:35.314 --> 00:31:37.730
AUDIENCE: Least squares
error approximation.

00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:41.830
MAX TEGMARK: Least squares
error approximation.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:47.560
Doesn't anyone want to try a
one word answer in that spirit?

00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.172
Statistics.

00:31:50.172 --> 00:31:52.356
Or just more generally,
you could say math.

00:31:52.356 --> 00:31:54.230
Or if you want to be
really, really nitpicky,

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.484
you could say the pencil.

00:31:56.484 --> 00:31:58.650
Because they were all
predicted through mathematics.

00:31:58.650 --> 00:32:00.740
You know the stories.

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:04.150
In 1846, the French
astronomer, Urbain Le Verrier,

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:08.300
was using Newton's
equations to figure out

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.080
how the recently-discovered
planet Uranus was supposed

00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:13.020
to move, and why
it wasn't moving

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.660
the way it was supposed to.

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.465
And he wrote this letter to
this astronomer, Galle in Berlin

00:32:17.465 --> 00:32:19.730
and said, hey,
point your telescope

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:21.810
to such and such a
place, and I predict

00:32:21.810 --> 00:32:24.840
that you will there
see a new planet.

00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:27.580
The guy did-- boom,
there was Neptune,

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.820
predicted with mathematics.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.876
Just a few decades later,
James Clerk Maxwell

00:32:33.876 --> 00:32:35.250
was sitting around
with equations

00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:39.040
that I was teaching over at MIT
this morning to 90 freshman--

00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.920
the Maxwell equations,
we of course

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:43.690
call them now in his honor--
and realized when he solved them

00:32:43.690 --> 00:32:47.280
with his pencil that if you
build a certain kind of device

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:48.750
that had never
hitherto been built,

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:50.620
you could use it
to send information

00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:52.445
at the speed of light
through empty space.

00:32:52.445 --> 00:32:54.070
Now, raise your hand
if you have a cell

00:32:54.070 --> 00:32:58.810
phone in your pocket--
predicted through mathematics.

00:32:58.810 --> 00:33:02.000
And most recently,
Peter Higgs sat down

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:05.360
with the most advanced
mathematical description

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:07.370
of the time in namely,
the standard model

00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:08.940
of particle physics,
and figured out

00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.120
that if you built the
most complicated machines

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:13.770
humans have ever
built in Geneva,

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:15.540
and you use it to smash
particles together

00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.280
near the speed of
light in a certain way,

00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.305
you would there make this new
particle, the Higgs boson.

00:33:20.305 --> 00:33:21.830
You know how that went.

00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:24.895
He built the machine, and he
got a free trip to Stockholm

00:33:24.895 --> 00:33:26.250
to pick up his Nobel Prize.

00:33:26.250 --> 00:33:30.720
So why is it that math
is so powerful like this?

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.620
And it's not just
these predictions.

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:38.030
But we've been able to
summarize so much about nature

00:33:38.030 --> 00:33:39.890
with these very,
very simple equations

00:33:39.890 --> 00:33:41.680
that capture these
patterns, these

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.134
hints that nature has given us.

00:33:43.134 --> 00:33:45.050
Some people, they like
their equations so much

00:33:45.050 --> 00:33:46.300
they even put them
on their tombstone.

00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:48.090
I took this one when
I visited Alpbach

00:33:48.090 --> 00:33:51.090
in Austria, Schrodinger's grave.

00:33:51.090 --> 00:33:54.550
And it's not just
equations and shapes.

00:33:54.550 --> 00:33:55.620
It's also numbers.

00:33:55.620 --> 00:33:59.590
You'll find this list in
chapter 11 on my book.

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:03.790
These 32 numbers, pure
numbers with no units.

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:05.940
From these 32 numbers,
we can, in principle,

00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:10.480
calculate every pure
number ever measured

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:13.840
in the history of science.

00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:19.239
So why is it that nature
is so mathematical?

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:22.862
By the 1960s, Eugene
Wigner wrote a famous essay

00:34:22.862 --> 00:34:25.070
where he argued that this
enormous usefulness of math

00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:26.650
in the natural science
is really something

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:27.816
bordering on the mysterious.

00:34:27.816 --> 00:34:31.920
And there's no rational
explanation for it.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.625
I agree with Wigner that
it's really mysterious.

00:34:35.625 --> 00:34:37.500
But I think there actually
is an explanation.

00:34:37.500 --> 00:34:39.845
I explore the whole range
of possibilities in the book

00:34:39.845 --> 00:34:41.469
from people who think
that math is just

00:34:41.469 --> 00:34:44.719
something we humans have
made up-- it's just a tool,

00:34:44.719 --> 00:34:48.719
and it means nothing special--
to the opposite extreme, which

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:51.949
is where I personally would bet
my money on-- namely that there

00:34:51.949 --> 00:34:55.989
is an explanation, that our
universe is very profoundly

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:56.949
mathematical.

00:34:56.949 --> 00:34:59.440
Specifically, my guess is
that our universe isn't

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:02.200
just described by math, but
that it is math in the sense

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:05.736
that it's actually a
mathematical structure.

00:35:05.736 --> 00:35:07.360
Let's unpack a bit
what I mean by that.

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:09.609
I mean in plain English that
our universe doesn't just

00:35:09.609 --> 00:35:11.950
have some mathematical
properties,

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:18.080
but that it fundamentally has
only mathematical properties.

00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:20.580
Now, that sounds really
nutty when you first hear it.

00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:24.270
So let me introduce you to our
neighbor here, Mr. Hoggles.

00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:25.930
He lives in our
backyard, except I

00:35:25.930 --> 00:35:29.060
think he thinks that we
live in his backyard.

00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:30.332
Well, look at him.

00:35:30.332 --> 00:35:32.540
I said the universe has only
mathematical properties.

00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:36.090
Well, what properties
does he have?

00:35:36.090 --> 00:35:41.150
Maybe a cuteness, a
fluffiness, herbivorousness,

00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:45.210
a passion for digging
holes in our backyard.

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:47.630
Those don't sound like
mathematical properties at all.

00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:49.760
But if I look at
him as a physicist,

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:54.180
I see a blob of quarks
and electrons arranged

00:35:54.180 --> 00:35:55.847
in a certain
interesting pattern.

00:35:55.847 --> 00:35:57.430
What properties does
an electron have?

00:35:57.430 --> 00:36:07.270
It has the property minus
1, 1/2, 1, and so on.

00:36:07.270 --> 00:36:09.060
And we physicists have
made up nerdy names

00:36:09.060 --> 00:36:09.934
for these properties.

00:36:09.934 --> 00:36:12.480
You can see them in the table
here-- like electric charge,

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:14.215
and spin, and lepton number.

00:36:14.215 --> 00:36:17.030
The electron doesn't care
what we call these properties.

00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:18.590
They're just
mathematical properties.

00:36:18.590 --> 00:36:19.465
They're just numbers.

00:36:19.465 --> 00:36:21.620
And as far we can tell,
none of the other particles

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.047
that make up stuff in this
room have any properties

00:36:25.047 --> 00:36:26.130
either other than numbers.

00:36:26.130 --> 00:36:27.400
It's just that they
have different numbers

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:28.480
than the electron does.

00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:29.940
In fact, as far
as we understand,

00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:31.730
the only difference
between an electron,

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:35.430
and a proton, and
a photon is which

00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:36.905
numbers it has as
its properties.

00:36:40.590 --> 00:36:43.260
Now, that's the stuff in
space made of particles.

00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.427
What about space itself?

00:36:44.427 --> 00:36:45.760
What properties does space have?

00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:48.920
Well, it has the property 3.

00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:51.380
That's the largest
number fingers

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:53.339
that I can hold
perpendicularly to one another.

00:36:53.339 --> 00:36:55.338
Again, we have a geeky
name for this, of course.

00:36:55.338 --> 00:36:57.040
We call it the
dimensionality of space.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.080
But again, space doesn't
care what we call it.

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.545
The property is 3.

00:37:00.545 --> 00:37:02.150
It's a number.

00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:04.230
And we now have
discovered that space also

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:07.620
has two more properties, the
curvature and the topology,

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:08.936
which are equally mathematical.

00:37:08.936 --> 00:37:10.310
So if you take
seriously the idea

00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:13.840
that both the space
and space itself

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.520
has only mathematical
properties,

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.020
it starts to sound
a little bit less

00:37:17.020 --> 00:37:21.590
nutty, the idea that
maybe everything is

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:23.860
just mathematical.

00:37:23.860 --> 00:37:28.100
So we've talked about how we
humans keep underestimating

00:37:28.100 --> 00:37:31.120
both the size of our world
and the power of our minds

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.690
to understand it.

00:37:32.690 --> 00:37:35.280
So let's look
forward, see what we

00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:37.850
can do with this
if we think big.

00:37:37.850 --> 00:37:41.090
First of all, this
guess that it's

00:37:41.090 --> 00:37:43.410
all mathematical is either
right or it's wrong.

00:37:43.410 --> 00:37:46.050
If it's wrong, that means that
physics is ultimately doomed,

00:37:46.050 --> 00:37:48.600
because we've kept
making progress

00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:50.750
by finding these
mathematical clues.

00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:53.415
And if we run out of them
without understanding things,

00:37:53.415 --> 00:37:54.790
then we won't get
any more clues,

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:56.581
and we're always forever
going to be stuck.

00:37:56.581 --> 00:37:59.140
Whereas if this guess is correct
and it's all mathematical,

00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:01.530
that means there are more
clues we haven't yet found.

00:38:01.530 --> 00:38:02.821
We can keep searching for them.

00:38:02.821 --> 00:38:05.297
And in principle,
there is no road block.

00:38:05.297 --> 00:38:07.630
There's nothing that we can't,
in principle, understand.

00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:09.620
And our ability to
actually figure stuff out

00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:14.560
is only going to be limited
by our own imagination.

00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:16.450
I think that's the
optimistic view.

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:18.029
And I think since
we don't know which

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:20.320
it is, I think it's a good
working hypothesis that it's

00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:21.000
true.

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.830
Because then, we're
going to try harder.

00:38:22.830 --> 00:38:25.146
There's no better way to
set up to guarantee failure

00:38:25.146 --> 00:38:27.270
than to tell yourself that
what you're trying to do

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:31.740
is impossible, and therefore,
eh, I'm not even going to try.

00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:35.300
Now, what about the future--
not of physics, but of humanity?

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:38.350
If we look at the
path ahead here,

00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:41.340
what lies around the corner?

00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:44.160
This universe has been here
for 13.8 billion years.

00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:47.440
We humans, newcomers
on the scene,

00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:51.010
been in our present form,
ballpark of 100,000 years.

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:56.240
We've only had the internet
since I was since a high school

00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.820
student.

00:38:57.820 --> 00:39:01.617
And what lies around the corner?

00:39:01.617 --> 00:39:03.450
A lot of people have
written a lot of things

00:39:03.450 --> 00:39:05.630
about this, mostly speculation.

00:39:05.630 --> 00:39:07.310
Some are very
optimistic and have

00:39:07.310 --> 00:39:09.780
a vision of how life
will spread from Earth

00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:12.210
and eventually flourish
throughout the cosmos.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:14.870
Others have more dystopic
visions of various ways

00:39:14.870 --> 00:39:19.470
in which we can
destroy ourselves,

00:39:19.470 --> 00:39:21.430
maybe creating an
accidental nuclear war,

00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:24.950
maybe building machines that are
smarter than us, where things

00:39:24.950 --> 00:39:26.930
somehow go wrong, maybe
messing up our climate,

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:28.950
or some combination
of the above.

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:30.810
There are many dystopic ideas.

00:39:30.810 --> 00:39:32.600
Which one is it going to be?

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:35.730
In the last chapter of the
book, I take all of the things

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:37.130
that people like to worry about.

00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:39.950
And I sort them by urgency.

00:39:39.950 --> 00:39:41.510
So how far into the
future they will

00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:43.270
be most likely to wipe us out.

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:46.030
And what's interesting about
this is you see that all

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:49.130
the things which are most urgent
that could happen the soonest

00:39:49.130 --> 00:39:51.220
are things we cannot
blame our universe for.

00:39:51.220 --> 00:39:52.410
We can only blame ourselves.

00:39:52.410 --> 00:39:53.510
They're the self-inflicted ones.

00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:55.800
But if you flip this around,
that's also good news.

00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:58.250
It means if we can get
our act together and not

00:39:58.250 --> 00:40:00.752
annihilate ourselves,
we have much more time

00:40:00.752 --> 00:40:02.210
to confront all
these other things.

00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:04.418
And if you ask me afterwards,
I can tell you actually

00:40:04.418 --> 00:40:06.660
pretty straightforward
technical fixes

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:12.790
for how to avoid
death by asteroid,

00:40:12.790 --> 00:40:16.724
how to avoid death by sun.

00:40:16.724 --> 00:40:18.640
If we don't do anything,
the sun, for example,

00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:21.300
will evaporate the Atlantic
Ocean in about a billion years

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:22.830
as it gets hotter.

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.810
But there's a clever technique
involving asteroid deflection,

00:40:25.810 --> 00:40:28.076
which can move us out to
a more comfortable orbit,

00:40:28.076 --> 00:40:29.700
give us billions of
years more, as long

00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:33.120
as we start this project about
1/2 a billion years from now.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:35.639
So you can ask me
about this later.

00:40:35.639 --> 00:40:37.180
But I think, obviously,
the game plan

00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:40.560
should be let's first
get our act together,

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:44.670
and then we have a lot of
time to sort out the rest.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:47.480
So being a professor,
I have this bad habit.

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.070
I just love giving out
grades, even unsolicited.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:54.090
So I decided to give humanity a
grade for risk management 101.

00:40:54.090 --> 00:40:56.900
So I asked around a little bit
what people thought was fair.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:58.590
And some people said,
maybe a B minus.

00:40:58.590 --> 00:41:02.112
We've done some stupid
stuff like cutting it a bit

00:41:02.112 --> 00:41:04.560
close a few times, like
the Cuban Missile Crisis.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:05.610
But we're still here.

00:41:05.610 --> 00:41:08.580
So maybe a B minus, a
decent passing grade.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.510
I decided to give a D minus,
even though actually, that's

00:41:11.510 --> 00:41:14.320
not a legal grade at MIT.

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.630
Because I really think
from a cosmic perspective,

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:19.057
it's pathetic.

00:41:19.057 --> 00:41:21.140
There's a huge uncertainty
in what the probability

00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:24.590
is that we annihilate
ourselves in any given decade.

00:41:24.590 --> 00:41:26.460
Some people think it's
very unlikely, maybe

00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.439
only one chance in 10,000.

00:41:28.439 --> 00:41:29.980
Some people think
it's pretty likely,

00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:32.454
like 10% chance per decade.

00:41:32.454 --> 00:41:33.370
Doesn't really matter.

00:41:33.370 --> 00:41:36.000
None of those extremes
is a good recipe

00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.070
for lasting for
millions of years.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:42.760
It's like if you play Russian
roulette often enough-- not

00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:44.490
the smartest strategy.

00:41:44.490 --> 00:41:46.360
Moreover, from the
standard perspective,

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:49.180
we kept obsessing about the
next election cycle and life

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.140
here on Earth.

00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:52.090
We have so much more
potential for life.

00:41:52.090 --> 00:41:54.230
We have 10 to the 57
times more volume,

00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:57.850
for crying out loud, out
there-- billions of years.

00:41:57.850 --> 00:42:00.240
Let's take advantage
of this and not

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.830
keep playing
Russian roulette now

00:42:01.830 --> 00:42:04.390
and risk just
jeopardizing it all.

00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:07.819
And why is this that
we're so shortsighted,

00:42:07.819 --> 00:42:09.110
taking these unnecessary risks?

00:42:09.110 --> 00:42:13.500
Well, the most common answer I
get when I ask people is money.

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:14.500
We just can't afford it.

00:42:14.500 --> 00:42:17.200
Yeah, it would be nice
to safeguard humanity.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:23.600
But the economy's
tough, budget cuts.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.460
But I like numbers.

00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:27.710
So I decided let's drill a
little bit deeper and see

00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:29.920
if that argument actually works.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.250
Some small nonprofit
organizations actually

00:42:32.250 --> 00:42:34.600
spend some money that they
raise philanthropically

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.640
to try to reduce risks.

00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:37.240
Like down the road
here in Cambridge,

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:38.990
we have the Union of
Concerned Scientists.

00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:40.510
They spend about
$20 million a year,

00:42:40.510 --> 00:42:42.218
for example, on trying
to reduce the risk

00:42:42.218 --> 00:42:43.780
of accidental nuclear war.

00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:47.010
Let's let $20 million
correspond to that box

00:42:47.010 --> 00:42:49.014
and shrink it down
to a few pixels.

00:42:49.014 --> 00:42:49.805
That's $20 million.

00:42:49.805 --> 00:42:53.520
And let's see what other things
we spent money on last year

00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:55.650
so that we couldn't
afford spending

00:42:55.650 --> 00:42:58.460
more on reducing nuc risk.

00:42:58.460 --> 00:43:02.260
$10 billion last year on
cosmetic surgery in the US

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:03.690
alone.

00:43:03.690 --> 00:43:05.340
$20 billion on air conditioning.

00:43:05.340 --> 00:43:08.060
Not for you, just for US troops.

00:43:08.060 --> 00:43:11.167
$100 billion on smoking.

00:43:11.167 --> 00:43:13.250
And the biggest item didn't
even fit on my screen.

00:43:13.250 --> 00:43:15.083
I have to shrink it by
another factor of 10,

00:43:15.083 --> 00:43:18.060
to make room for it,
the military budget.

00:43:18.060 --> 00:43:21.550
So if someone says, the reason
we can't spend twice as much

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:25.606
on that is because we just
really don't have the money,

00:43:25.606 --> 00:43:28.130
we can't cut that much out
from anything else, that's

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:29.640
obviously not the real answer.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:31.620
So what is the real answer then?

00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:33.740
Well, another answer
I often get, actually,

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:39.680
is that it would be
irresponsible to spend money

00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:43.811
on mitigating a risk
that hasn't been proven.

00:43:43.811 --> 00:43:45.060
Think about that a little bit.

00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:48.370
You hear it a lot on
certain news channels,

00:43:48.370 --> 00:43:50.350
that it would be
irresponsible to spend money

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.500
to mitigate climate
change risk that

00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:55.660
hasn't been proven, for example.

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:59.510
But let's think about
that a bit more.

00:43:59.510 --> 00:44:01.360
You can easily see
the logical flaw in it

00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:04.120
if you make the same argument,
apply it to this situation.

00:44:04.120 --> 00:44:06.980
You can go out to the
store to buy a stroller

00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.690
for the baby of a
good friend of yours.

00:44:08.690 --> 00:44:10.148
And the salesman
comes up and says,

00:44:10.148 --> 00:44:12.980
hey, I have this really
nice model on the left here,

00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.910
very robust stroller, $49.95.

00:44:15.910 --> 00:44:17.800
We sold it for over
a decade, never

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.800
had any safety complaints.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:20.960
Solid buy.

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:24.055
But I also have this
other model on the right.

00:44:24.055 --> 00:44:26.430
I know there have been some
press reports of it sometimes

00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:28.138
collapsing and crushing
the baby and all.

00:44:28.138 --> 00:44:30.060
But there's never been
any proof, especially

00:44:30.060 --> 00:44:32.680
in a courtroom, that any of
these deaths of these babies

00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:35.190
were actually caused by any
design flaw on the stroller.

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:38.440
So wouldn't it be
irresponsible to spend 20% more

00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:43.790
money on reducing a risk
that hasn't been proven?

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:45.290
Which stroller are
you going to buy?

00:44:50.410 --> 00:44:53.760
So if you're willing to
spend 20% more reducing

00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:58.939
your risk for one child,
I think you would happily

00:44:58.939 --> 00:45:01.230
do the same when you're
talking about all children, not

00:45:01.230 --> 00:45:04.500
just alive today, but for all
future generations that we

00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:07.230
might have.

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:12.290
And in summary, I think
it's very important

00:45:12.290 --> 00:45:15.250
when we talk about science
not just use it to figure out

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:17.940
how to build cool new gizmos,
but also take a step back

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.810
and ask, what does
this mean for us?

00:45:19.810 --> 00:45:22.100
What we really learn
from studying cosmology

00:45:22.100 --> 00:45:26.150
is that life has so much more
potential in the future than we

00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:30.600
thought, and that it's extremely
important that we don't blow

00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:34.630
it, that we actually make
the most of this potential,

00:45:34.630 --> 00:45:41.590
rather than act very
recklessly and screw things up.

00:45:41.590 --> 00:45:43.984
And for this reason,
I've actually

00:45:43.984 --> 00:45:45.900
had a lot of fun during
the past year spending

00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.679
some time starting up
an organization called

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:50.970
the Future of Life Institute,
that's here in Cambridge,

00:45:50.970 --> 00:45:52.390
if you want to
join a bunch of us

00:45:52.390 --> 00:45:55.246
scientists and others thinking
about concrete things we can

00:45:55.246 --> 00:45:56.620
do to reduce some
of these risks.

00:45:56.620 --> 00:45:59.820
Shoot me an email and come
to one of our get togethers.

00:45:59.820 --> 00:46:02.200
We just organized a
conference, for example,

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:04.950
on artificial intelligence in
Puerto Rico earlier this month

00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:07.280
where we had many of
the top AI builders

00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:09.900
in the world coming together
with no journalists--

00:46:09.900 --> 00:46:13.000
so we didn't have to deal with
stupid articles with a picture

00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:15.051
of the Terminator
afterwards-- and talked

00:46:15.051 --> 00:46:16.300
about what can we actually do?

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:18.220
What research can
we do now to make

00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:22.300
sure we get the benefits
of AI while avoiding risks?

00:46:22.300 --> 00:46:23.636
And then Elon Musk was there.

00:46:23.636 --> 00:46:25.260
And it was really
fun working with him.

00:46:25.260 --> 00:46:26.200
And he said, yeah.

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.050
I hear you guys.

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.450
You have a lot of concrete
things you want to do now.

00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:30.606
Research is going to help.

00:46:30.606 --> 00:46:32.230
And you're complaining
it's not funded.

00:46:32.230 --> 00:46:33.890
Well, let me give
you some money.

00:46:33.890 --> 00:46:36.320
So he gave us $10 million,
and there's a research program

00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:38.420
that we're running now
through our organization.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:39.610
You can go apply.

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:44.660
Deadline is March 1 if you have
concrete ideas for research,

00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:48.090
again, in AI that could
help get the benefits,

00:46:48.090 --> 00:46:50.240
while reducing risks.

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:52.180
But we're interested
in not just AI.

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.560
We're interested in
anything that humans

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:59.090
can do to become better at
thinking more long term.

00:46:59.090 --> 00:47:02.564
So let's make a difference.

00:47:02.564 --> 00:47:04.040
Thank you.

00:47:04.040 --> 00:47:07.484
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:13.210 --> 00:47:14.890
Questions?

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:18.437
AUDIENCE: So how much of a risk
is collision with the-- I mean,

00:47:18.437 --> 00:47:20.520
we are going to collide
with the Andromeda galaxy.

00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:23.540
But I thought we were just
going to pass through.

00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:25.170
Is it actually dangerous?

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:27.974
And what can we do to stop it?

00:47:27.974 --> 00:47:30.140
MAX TEGMARK: The collision
with the Andromeda galaxy

00:47:30.140 --> 00:47:30.970
is tough to stop.

00:47:30.970 --> 00:47:32.640
But the good news
is you don't really

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.070
need to worry so much about it.

00:47:34.070 --> 00:47:37.117
When two galaxies collide, it
sounds worse than it really is,

00:47:37.117 --> 00:47:39.450
because most of the stars
don't actually hit each other.

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:41.700
The stars are very far between.

00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.690
So what happens is more
like a corporate merger

00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:46.090
where, actually,
the galaxies are

00:47:46.090 --> 00:47:47.300
going to kind of fly
through each other

00:47:47.300 --> 00:47:49.674
once and get kind of messed
up, and then they come back--

00:47:49.674 --> 00:47:51.446
that's 3.5 billion
years from now.

00:47:51.446 --> 00:47:53.320
5 billion years from
now, they collide again.

00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:55.899
And this time, they just
merge into a single galaxy.

00:47:55.899 --> 00:47:57.440
I don't know what
our descendants are

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:01.100
going to call it, maybe the
Milkomeda, or maybe something

00:48:01.100 --> 00:48:03.010
else in Andromodese.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:06.550
But most of the
stars will be fine.

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:11.720
So I think that's pretty far
down on the list of things

00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:12.780
I worry about.

00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.610
But the cool thing is, even
with the limited understanding

00:48:15.610 --> 00:48:20.110
we have today, we can actually
forecast a lot of these things

00:48:20.110 --> 00:48:22.710
and in cases where
it makes sense,

00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:25.070
actually start taking
some precautions.

00:48:25.070 --> 00:48:27.510
It's pretty likely that when
that happens, for example,

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:31.472
that our solar system would be
put in a less favorable orbit.

00:48:31.472 --> 00:48:33.680
Maybe we'll have a close
encounter with another star.

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.760
Maybe we'll get
detached from the sun.

00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:37.620
So it might be
smart to be energy

00:48:37.620 --> 00:48:42.430
self-sufficient at that point,
so we don't need the sun.

00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:46.380
But we have a few billion
years to figure that out.

00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:47.426
More questions?

00:48:47.426 --> 00:48:49.010
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:51.510
This is about the unreasonable
effectiveness of mathematics.

00:48:51.510 --> 00:48:52.884
It seems to me
that a lot of math

00:48:52.884 --> 00:48:55.640
was especially designed to
understand the physical world.

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:57.740
So there's a little
bit of drawing a target

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:59.560
around the arrow going on here.

00:48:59.560 --> 00:49:00.470
MAX TEGMARK: Yes.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:03.760
AUDIENCE: And perhaps it's a
more limited puzzle of yeah,

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:07.160
math was 60% designed to
understand the world and 20%

00:49:07.160 --> 00:49:08.694
to do financial calculations.

00:49:08.694 --> 00:49:10.110
And then you have
the puzzle well,

00:49:10.110 --> 00:49:13.290
why does the same math sometimes
work at both physics grads

00:49:13.290 --> 00:49:15.461
and to get good
jobs on Wall Street?

00:49:15.461 --> 00:49:17.210
MAX TEGMARK: That's
an excellent question.

00:49:17.210 --> 00:49:19.320
So there's obviously
an element here

00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:23.050
of us figuring out a
mathematical language

00:49:23.050 --> 00:49:25.740
to do the tasks that we
are interested in doing,

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.385
guided by the physical world.

00:49:28.385 --> 00:49:31.260
It's very important
though to distinguish

00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:34.490
between the language of
mathematics, which we invent,

00:49:34.490 --> 00:49:37.620
like the notation for how
we write the number 5,

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:39.800
and the structures
of mathematics,

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.410
which are the things
that I'm claiming

00:49:41.410 --> 00:49:43.180
exist independently of people.

00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:46.071
So to clarify this a little bit,
think of Plato, for example.

00:49:46.071 --> 00:49:48.070
He was really interested
in this simple question

00:49:48.070 --> 00:49:51.950
of how many regular
three dimensional shapes

00:49:51.950 --> 00:49:57.530
there were that you can make
just out of identical polygons.

00:49:57.530 --> 00:50:00.320
And he figured out that
there are five of them,

00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.220
which we call Platonic solids.

00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:05.820
Now, he was free to invent the
language for describing them,

00:50:05.820 --> 00:50:09.180
to call them the tetrahedron,
the cube, the octahedron,

00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.610
the dodecahedron,
and the icosahedron.

00:50:11.610 --> 00:50:15.090
He could have called the last
one shmicosehedron or something

00:50:15.090 --> 00:50:16.220
else, right?

00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:19.660
But he was not free
to invent a sixth one.

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:23.490
That's the aspect that
just exists mathematically,

00:50:23.490 --> 00:50:26.480
that we are not free to invent
the structures themselves,

00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.280
that there is such a thing as
a dodecahedron that has exactly

00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:33.120
four cousins--
not five, not two.

00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:34.780
That's the thing
which is out there.

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:36.390
So the way I envision
this is we have

00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:38.240
all these mathematical
structures,

00:50:38.240 --> 00:50:44.280
the Platonic solids, the
integers, Hilbert space, the 3

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:46.910
plus 1 dimensional,
pseudo-Riemannian manifolds--

00:50:46.910 --> 00:50:47.910
put in your favorite.

00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:51.410
There's an infinite set of
these mathematical structures

00:50:51.410 --> 00:50:52.110
out there.

00:50:52.110 --> 00:50:55.220
Some of them we find
useful to study,

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:57.470
because they help with
finance, or building bridges,

00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.840
or whatever.

00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:59.548
And we give them names,
and we teach them

00:50:59.548 --> 00:51:00.720
to our children at school.

00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.570
Others, we haven't even
discovered them yet,

00:51:03.570 --> 00:51:05.800
because they weren't
relevant before us.

00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:11.890
But the set of them
that's out there

00:51:11.890 --> 00:51:13.660
has nothing to do with us.

00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.660
It's not because of
our doing that there

00:51:15.660 --> 00:51:17.240
are five platonic solids.

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:20.300
So I think of it as
much like if someone

00:51:20.300 --> 00:51:21.760
comes to Boston
for the first time,

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:25.237
they've never been here, which
exact streets they choose

00:51:25.237 --> 00:51:27.320
to explore will depend a
lot on their preferences,

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.090
like where they work, what
food they like to eat.

00:51:30.090 --> 00:51:34.200
But then if no one tells them
what these things are called,

00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.470
they might even invent
their own language for it.

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:40.070
We're exploring this
mathematical space,

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:42.576
to first explore the things
that are useful for us.

00:51:42.576 --> 00:51:44.200
If you have an alien
civilization which

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:46.070
start to study math,
they would probably

00:51:46.070 --> 00:51:48.390
start exploring a lot
of other structures

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:51.340
that we haven't bothered
with, and maybe vice versa.

00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:53.510
But I also suspect that
there are some things which

00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:56.360
are so central in math that
pretty much any aliens that

00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:58.090
want to do any kind
of serious technology

00:51:58.090 --> 00:52:01.780
would find it useful to,
again, discover the integers,

00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:08.280
for example, and doing Boolean
logic with zero and ones,

00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:09.740
and maybe they
would make computers

00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:12.240
that had logic much
like ours, and so on.

00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.764
Because it's just
like anyone who

00:52:13.764 --> 00:52:15.430
spends enough time
in Boston is at least

00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:20.180
going to discover Boston
Common and downtown.

00:52:20.180 --> 00:52:20.907
Question?

00:52:20.907 --> 00:52:21.490
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:52:21.490 --> 00:52:25.720
So intuitively, I
agree with and I

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:29.390
believe what you claim about
that it is just math all

00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:31.550
the way down, that it's
not just the description

00:52:31.550 --> 00:52:34.240
of some underlying
reality and these numbers,

00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:36.700
these relationships
just emerge from those.

00:52:36.700 --> 00:52:40.610
But at the same time,
it seems like if there

00:52:40.610 --> 00:52:44.340
is an underlying material
reality, and these numbers

00:52:44.340 --> 00:52:48.090
and equations, part
of the clue I think

00:52:48.090 --> 00:52:52.572
is we talk not about expressions
so much, but about equations.

00:52:52.572 --> 00:52:54.530
Because it's about the
relationships of things.

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:55.613
MAX TEGMARK: That's right.

00:52:55.613 --> 00:52:57.570
AUDIENCE: Math is
fundamentally about that.

00:52:57.570 --> 00:53:00.860
It's uninteresting or not
being applied if you're just

00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:04.240
talking about expressions not
in the context of an equality,

00:53:04.240 --> 00:53:06.360
or an equation, or a
comparison to something else.

00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:07.405
So it's all about relations.

00:53:07.405 --> 00:53:08.200
MAX TEGMARK: That's right.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:09.410
It is all about relations.

00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:10.200
I agree.

00:53:10.200 --> 00:53:11.191
AUDIENCE: And the
fact that we know

00:53:11.191 --> 00:53:13.280
there's not some underlying
reality that we can never

00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:14.863
directly perceive,
because we can only

00:53:14.863 --> 00:53:16.950
see the indirect relationships
and the transitive

00:53:16.950 --> 00:53:18.970
relationships that we can
measure these numbers about.

00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:19.720
MAX TEGMARK: Yeah.

00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.640
You're making a very
good set of points there.

00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:24.640
Let me just add a little bit
how I think to them, as well.

00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:27.260
First of all, in
mathematics, the way

00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:29.280
a mathematical
structure is defined

00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:33.490
is simply as an abstract set
of elements and relations

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:35.180
between them.

00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:38.050
You can give names to
these abstract elements

00:53:38.050 --> 00:53:40.839
and call them the edges of
your dodecahedron, or whatever.

00:53:40.839 --> 00:53:41.880
But that's not necessary.

00:53:44.550 --> 00:53:46.800
The elements of a
set in mathematics

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:48.640
don't have any
properties at all.

00:53:48.640 --> 00:53:52.260
And when physics began, when
Archimedes, and Galileo,

00:53:52.260 --> 00:53:55.360
and others were doing
their stuff, at that point,

00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:57.360
the relations they
discovered with equations

00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:01.280
could only capture
a very small subset

00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:04.070
of all the properties of
nature, mostly motion of things.

00:54:04.070 --> 00:54:07.140
So Galileo was very good at
figuring how this would move.

00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:09.640
But he had no idea where
the atoms came from

00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.030
or why this was black
and why this was hard,

00:54:12.030 --> 00:54:15.510
even though his skin
was soft, and so on.

00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:18.280
So it seemed like you had
these mathematical relations

00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:21.280
between things which were
very non-mathematical

00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:22.280
in their properties.

00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.926
Gradually, that changed.

00:54:23.926 --> 00:54:25.300
Then we got the
Maxwell equations

00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:27.427
which explains, actually,
what colors are.

00:54:27.427 --> 00:54:30.010
And then we got the Schrodinger
equation of quantum mechanics,

00:54:30.010 --> 00:54:32.490
which actually lets me
calculate why this is black,

00:54:32.490 --> 00:54:34.840
and why my shirt looks
blue, and why this is soft,

00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:38.260
and why this is hard, and all
the other properties of matter.

00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:41.029
And now, we instead
have realized

00:54:41.029 --> 00:54:43.320
that we can understand all
this with quantum mechanics,

00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:45.070
and looking at these
smaller building

00:54:45.070 --> 00:54:46.450
blocks, quarks and electrons.

00:54:46.450 --> 00:54:50.860
And as I said earlier, a quark
isn't actually soft, or hard,

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:52.200
or yellow, or blue.

00:54:52.200 --> 00:54:53.910
It doesn't have any
of those properties.

00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:55.490
In fact, we've
looked really hard

00:54:55.490 --> 00:54:57.240
and haven't discovered
any property yet

00:54:57.240 --> 00:55:02.610
that a quark or an electron has
other than just some numbers.

00:55:02.610 --> 00:55:06.031
So that's why our
world is feeling more

00:55:06.031 --> 00:55:07.280
like a mathematical structure.

00:55:07.280 --> 00:55:08.821
The relations are
there, and we found

00:55:08.821 --> 00:55:10.050
more and more relationships.

00:55:10.050 --> 00:55:12.140
We know more relationships
now than ever before.

00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:14.390
But the things that the
relationships or relationships

00:55:14.390 --> 00:55:17.570
between have lost
much of their magic.

00:55:17.570 --> 00:55:19.620
And as far as we can
tell, actually, they

00:55:19.620 --> 00:55:21.910
don't have any properties
at all except numbers.

00:55:21.910 --> 00:55:24.800
But this ain't over yet.

00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:26.840
There are still
things in the world

00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:29.907
that we have epically failed
to describe with math,

00:55:29.907 --> 00:55:31.740
so we should be humble
and acknowledge that.

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:33.415
For example, our consciousness.

00:55:36.195 --> 00:55:38.320
Some people think we'll
never be able to understand

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.430
our consciousness with
mathematics and equations.

00:55:41.430 --> 00:55:42.680
Other people think we do.

00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.375
For example, Giulio
Tononi and Christof Koch,

00:55:45.375 --> 00:55:47.510
two famous neuroscientists,
have this theory

00:55:47.510 --> 00:55:52.470
where they argue that
conscious is actually

00:55:52.470 --> 00:55:55.327
certain mathematical pattern to
do with information processing.

00:55:55.327 --> 00:55:57.160
And we don't know yet
what's right or wrong.

00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.700
And I think one of
the coolest things

00:55:59.700 --> 00:56:01.530
to watch to see which
way this is going

00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:04.110
to break is to see
whether ultimately

00:56:04.110 --> 00:56:06.760
even that aspect of nature is
something we can understand

00:56:06.760 --> 00:56:08.390
better with science,
or whether we're

00:56:08.390 --> 00:56:10.730
going to hit the
road block there.

00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:13.849
Do we have time for
one more question?

00:56:13.849 --> 00:56:14.640
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:15.513
MAX TEGMARK: OK.

00:56:15.513 --> 00:56:19.610
AUDIENCE: So this a little
bit of a loopy question

00:56:19.610 --> 00:56:23.800
about deep time and long
term-- very, very long

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:28.425
term prospects for humanity.

00:56:28.425 --> 00:56:29.800
So one of the
things you run into

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.320
is the notion that as
everything, the universe,

00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:41.340
is expanding, the things, the
edges of what we can detect

00:56:41.340 --> 00:56:43.010
are now receding at
the speed of light.

00:56:43.010 --> 00:56:47.910
And if this process goes on
for a while, at some point,

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:50.640
you couldn't even see that there
had ever been other galaxies,

00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:52.640
because all the other
galaxies are moving faster

00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:54.223
than the speed of
light away from you.

00:56:54.223 --> 00:56:56.810
So there's no way to get
any information about them.

00:56:56.810 --> 00:57:01.140
And at an irrational level, this
seems really offensive to me.

00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:05.622
Is there a scientific
way out of this trap?

00:57:05.622 --> 00:57:07.580
MAX TEGMARK: Can someone
throw me our universe?

00:57:14.720 --> 00:57:18.760
Little bit short, but
the pass is complete.

00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:21.800
So just to make sure I answer
your question properly,

00:57:21.800 --> 00:57:23.910
is the part you find
offensive that things

00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:25.610
seem to go faster than light?

00:57:25.610 --> 00:57:27.910
Or is it that there are
things that we have no access

00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:29.660
to experimentally?

00:57:29.660 --> 00:57:30.330
The latter?

00:57:30.330 --> 00:57:30.720
AUDIENCE: Well,
they basically leave

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:32.303
the universe, because
there's no exit.

00:57:32.303 --> 00:57:33.410
MAX TEGMARK: OK, good.

00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:34.224
So first of all--

00:57:34.224 --> 00:57:35.640
AUDIENCE: So the
universe shrinks?

00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:38.510
MAX TEGMARK: We have
to be careful with how

00:57:38.510 --> 00:57:40.420
we use our words here.

00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:42.452
Some people choose to
use the word universe

00:57:42.452 --> 00:57:43.910
to refer to everything
that exists.

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:45.530
And then by
definition, of course,

00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:46.530
nothing can leave our universe.

00:57:46.530 --> 00:57:48.113
Our universe would
just be everything.

00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:55.990
I'm using the word
universe instead

00:57:55.990 --> 00:57:58.260
to refer to simply everything
which we can possibly

00:57:58.260 --> 00:58:01.300
observe with even the best
telescopes, namely this sphere

00:58:01.300 --> 00:58:03.990
from which light has had time
to reach us during the 13.8

00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:05.660
billion years
since our Big Bang.

00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:07.260
If you want to be
more precise, you'd

00:58:07.260 --> 00:58:09.320
call this our
observable universe.

00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:12.120
If you want to have a
word for everything you

00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.137
get to if you travel
forever in all directions,

00:58:14.137 --> 00:58:15.720
I would use a different
word for that.

00:58:15.720 --> 00:58:17.280
Mainly, just space.

00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:20.890
So space is bigger
than our universe.

00:58:20.890 --> 00:58:23.220
We don't know for
sure yet whether space

00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:25.239
is infinite or not.

00:58:25.239 --> 00:58:27.030
It might curve back on
itself or something.

00:58:27.030 --> 00:58:28.800
But right now, we
have no evidence

00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:31.300
whatsoever that space ends here.

00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:33.320
In fact, if we wait
one hour, we can

00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:35.160
see light reach us
from farther away

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:38.570
and falsify that hypothesis.

00:58:38.570 --> 00:58:41.340
And moreover, inflation,
this most popular theory

00:58:41.340 --> 00:58:43.070
we have for what
created our Big Bang,

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:44.720
typically predict
that space actually

00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:48.720
is much bigger than this,
perhaps even infinite.

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:54.510
So we're in this situation
where most likely,

00:58:54.510 --> 00:58:57.222
we can only observe a part
of everything that exists.

00:58:57.222 --> 00:58:58.930
And some people don't
like that, and they

00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:04.390
feel it's disappointing
and humbling.

00:59:04.390 --> 00:59:06.390
They think it's bad for
our egos or whatever.

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:09.010
But frankly, I think a little
bit of humility is good for us

00:59:09.010 --> 00:59:09.510
humans.

00:59:09.510 --> 00:59:13.742
And second, if we think about
it the other way around, to me,

00:59:13.742 --> 00:59:15.200
it feels pretty
arrogant if we were

00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:17.116
to assume that there's
some law of nature that

00:59:17.116 --> 00:59:19.880
says that we have to be able to
observe everything that exists.

00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:22.173
It's like an ostrich with
its head in the sand,

00:59:22.173 --> 00:59:27.320
saying, oh, if I can't see
you, then you don't exist.

00:59:27.320 --> 00:59:29.260
That feels way too
arrogant for me.

00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:31.280
We humans have had this
tendency in history,

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:34.050
again, and again, and again,
to assume that everything

00:59:34.050 --> 00:59:36.180
we knew of was
everything that existed.

00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:40.700
That's why we got so freaked
out by the whole Galileo spat,

00:59:40.700 --> 00:59:43.550
and then with the
realities that we

00:59:43.550 --> 00:59:46.944
live in a galaxy, the
universe, and so on.

00:59:46.944 --> 00:59:48.360
I think it's
overwhelmingly likely

00:59:48.360 --> 00:59:51.362
that there are parts of
space that we can't see now.

00:59:51.362 --> 00:59:52.820
Many of these
galaxies out here, we

00:59:52.820 --> 00:59:54.570
can see if we wait
the billion years.

00:59:54.570 --> 00:59:55.319
Eat your vitamins.

00:59:57.427 --> 01:00:00.010
But there might be other regions
of space which you will never

01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:03.070
be able to see, because the dark
energy will keep pushing them

01:00:03.070 --> 01:00:04.840
away from us farther.

01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.680
Let me also just
comment on the thing

01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.360
you said about speed of light.

01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.120
So we all learned
in kindergarten

01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:14.680
that nothing can go faster
than the speed of light.

01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:16.640
But it turns out
actually that that's only

01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.120
what special relativity said.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:20.890
And then Einstein came along
with general relativity

01:00:20.890 --> 01:00:22.760
that overruled this.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:24.910
And general relativity
is a bit more liberal

01:00:24.910 --> 01:00:26.360
about the speed limit.

01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:29.340
In general relativity, you
can't go faster than light

01:00:29.340 --> 01:00:32.465
through space itself,
but space can stretch out

01:00:32.465 --> 01:00:34.174
as fast as it wants.

01:00:34.174 --> 01:00:36.340
General relativity says
that space is better thought

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.240
of not as a static
boring stage where

01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.590
stuff happens, but
as a rubber sheet.

01:00:40.590 --> 01:00:41.450
It can vibrate.

01:00:41.450 --> 01:00:43.570
That's what those
gravitational waves are.

01:00:43.570 --> 01:00:46.260
It can curve, even making
things like black holes.

01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:47.660
And it can stretch.

01:00:47.660 --> 01:00:49.260
That's what the
expanding universe is.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.860
So if you keep
stretching it uniformly,

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:55.050
there will be some parts of
space which right now actually

01:00:55.050 --> 01:00:58.180
are going away from us faster
than the speed of light.

01:00:58.180 --> 01:00:59.430
And that's OK.

01:00:59.430 --> 01:01:01.680
If you try to look at them,
you simply can't see them.

01:01:01.680 --> 01:01:04.780
Light hasn't made it over here.

01:01:04.780 --> 01:01:06.840
So on that note, I
think time is up.

01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.710
So let me thank you
all so much for coming.

01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:09.840
It was a pleasure.

01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:13.490
