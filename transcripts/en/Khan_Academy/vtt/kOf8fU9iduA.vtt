00:00:00.804 --> 00:00:02.906
Narrator: As you might
imagine, World War I was

00:00:02.906 --> 00:00:05.139
one of the bloodiest events in, frankly,

00:00:05.139 --> 00:00:06.269
all of human history.

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:08.282
I was thinking about
putting some pictures here,

00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:09.866
and I encourage you to do a web search

00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.386
for actual photographs from World War I

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.939
of mass graves and people starving

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:17.020
and soldiers dead in trenches.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.326
It will make you feel ill.

00:00:19.326 --> 00:00:22.468
It's probably a good
thing to look for those

00:00:22.468 --> 00:00:24.765
images because it will
remind you how disgusting

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:29.268
and gross and crazy wars can be.

00:00:29.268 --> 00:00:31.474
Sometimes we abstract
it when we look at it

00:00:31.474 --> 00:00:33.553
in hindsight and we just
talk about the numbers.

00:00:33.553 --> 00:00:36.874
World War I was gruesome,
especially because this

00:00:36.874 --> 00:00:38.775
was the first time that
industrialized weapons

00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:42.096
were really put to use in a war context.

00:00:42.096 --> 00:00:44.521
There was far more bloodshed
than I think any of the

00:00:44.521 --> 00:00:47.861
fighting powers actually
believed there would be.

00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:49.554
Just to put things in to numbers,

00:00:49.554 --> 00:00:51.889
and these are huge numbers,
and these are frankly

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:53.600
abstract numbers; numbers that are hard

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.855
for us to comprehend.

00:00:54.855 --> 00:00:56.784
We don't know the exact numbers,

00:00:56.784 --> 00:00:58.862
as you can imagine, it's
not easy to take a census.

00:00:58.862 --> 00:01:01.174
The military's have a better count of

00:01:01.174 --> 00:01:04.543
who might have been killed
or who might be missing.

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:07.556
The civilian casualties are
almost impossible to count.

00:01:07.556 --> 00:01:09.599
You have people who are
inadvertently killed

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:11.566
by a bomb, you have people who are dying

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:13.481
of starvation, who are
dying due to famine.

00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:15.233
These are very hard numbers to count,

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:17.673
but there is some consensus on the rough

00:01:17.673 --> 00:01:20.488
estimates on the total
casualties in World War I.

00:01:20.488 --> 00:01:22.435
In particular, I'm going to
focus here on the deaths,

00:01:22.435 --> 00:01:24.607
when people talk about
casualties that often will also

00:01:24.607 --> 00:01:25.929
talk about injured.

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:28.610
Just the deaths alone,
the estimates I've seen,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.610
and I encourage you to look up your own

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.438
and try to figure out what
consensus you could get to,

00:01:33.438 --> 00:01:37.125
but the estimates I've
seen have on the order of

00:01:37.125 --> 00:01:41.006
16 million, million deaths during

00:01:41.006 --> 00:01:43.574
or due to World War I.

00:01:43.574 --> 00:01:45.001
If we were to break down those deaths,

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.693
we have 8-10 million in the military.

00:01:47.693 --> 00:01:50.694
So, directly military these
are death of soldiers,

00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:52.317
so this is the military.

00:01:52.317 --> 00:01:55.267
It was roughly, based on
the accounts that I've seen,

00:01:55.267 --> 00:01:58.488
about 60% of these deaths were amongst

00:01:58.488 --> 00:02:01.566
the Entente, and about 40% were amongst

00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:03.633
the central powers, but in either case,

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:05.937
we're talking about
millions on either side

00:02:05.937 --> 00:02:08.432
of World War I and then the rest,

00:02:08.432 --> 00:02:11.186
if we're talking on the
order of about 6-7 million

00:02:11.186 --> 00:02:12.454
were civilians.

00:02:12.454 --> 00:02:15.817
(writing) 6-7 millions civilians.

00:02:15.817 --> 00:02:18.662
The estimates I've seen
were about 1 million plus

00:02:18.662 --> 00:02:20.723
that were directly due to military action.

00:02:20.723 --> 00:02:24.226
This is military action
impacting civilians.

00:02:24.226 --> 00:02:27.387
This was disproportionately
felt on the side

00:02:27.387 --> 00:02:29.897
of the Entente, on the side of the allies.

00:02:29.897 --> 00:02:32.003
If you look at where,
especially the western front

00:02:32.003 --> 00:02:33.743
was fought, it becomes clear

00:02:33.743 --> 00:02:35.686
and also much of where the
eastern front was fought.

00:02:35.686 --> 00:02:37.926
The eastern front, a lot of it was fought

00:02:37.926 --> 00:02:40.123
on Russian land, or what
was controlled by the

00:02:40.123 --> 00:02:42.986
Russian Empire at the time
and on the western front,

00:02:42.986 --> 00:02:46.069
much of the, or most of
the battle was in France

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.843
and in Belgium and also in Italy,

00:02:48.843 --> 00:02:50.636
that was also where you
had a significant amount

00:02:50.636 --> 00:02:52.990
of the battle actually going on.

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.681
So, this is why the allies, the Entente,

00:02:55.681 --> 00:03:00.006
felt a disproportionate
number of the civilian

00:03:00.006 --> 00:03:02.789
that's directly due to
military casualties.

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:05.049
But then on top of that, the
rest of the civilian count,

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:07.216
this is what's, frankly,
very hard to get an exact

00:03:07.216 --> 00:03:09.587
number on, this would be due to famine,

00:03:09.587 --> 00:03:11.542
starvation, disease.

00:03:11.542 --> 00:03:14.083
(writing) disease.

00:03:14.406 --> 00:03:17.293
We've talked before about the blockade

00:03:17.293 --> 00:03:19.200
of the central powers.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.324
You had definitely
people not being able to

00:03:24.324 --> 00:03:28.465
kind of eat properly,
you had the Spanish Flu.

00:03:28.465 --> 00:03:31.475
It was just an all around ugly situation

00:03:31.475 --> 00:03:33.198
and then to make matters worse,

00:03:33.198 --> 00:03:36.762
and this is what the
history books often forget,

00:03:36.762 --> 00:03:38.832
you often had an explicit extermination

00:03:38.832 --> 00:03:42.229
of peoples' trying to
happen during World War I.

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:44.617
In fact, the, I guess, most notable,

00:03:44.617 --> 00:03:47.140
but often forgotten was
the Armenian genocide.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.672
There was actually an explicit campaign

00:03:49.672 --> 00:03:53.016
on the part of the Ottoman's
and this actually started

00:03:53.016 --> 00:03:56.273
before World War I, but
it kind of hit full pace

00:03:56.273 --> 00:03:59.667
during World War I where 1 to ...

00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:01.983
I've seen estimates of
1 million to 1.5 million

00:04:01.983 --> 00:04:04.801
Armenian's were systematically ...

00:04:04.801 --> 00:04:08.816
I'm talking about men, women, children,

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:12.986
systematically killed by
the Ottoman government.

00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:15.617
War is ugly and it brings out the worst

00:04:15.617 --> 00:04:18.721
in people and you see it
just from these numbers.

00:04:18.721 --> 00:04:21.963
Just to give a context of all this is ...

00:04:21.963 --> 00:04:26.504
it's very easy for us just
to abstract these things,

00:04:26.504 --> 00:04:28.792
but I really wanted to sit
in how horrible this was,

00:04:28.792 --> 00:04:33.604
but just to kind of
bring it all into focus.

00:04:33.604 --> 00:04:37.143
This right here is a passage from

00:04:37.143 --> 00:04:40.004
The Atlantic Monthly, Volume
129 that was published

00:04:40.004 --> 00:04:43.845
in 1922 and it's a passage
on Joseph Tumulty's book.

00:04:43.845 --> 00:04:46.634
Joseph Tumulty was the Private Secretary,

00:04:46.634 --> 00:04:48.337
what is now called the Chief of Staff,

00:04:48.337 --> 00:04:50.075
of President Woodrow Wilson.

00:04:50.075 --> 00:04:53.413
This is about his account of being with

00:04:53.413 --> 00:04:56.268
Woodrow Wilson after the war was declared

00:04:56.268 --> 00:04:58.080
in World War I.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.152
It's fascinating because
it applies, frankly,

00:05:01.152 --> 00:05:02.868
to most wars, or all wars.

00:05:02.868 --> 00:05:05.821
The War President and the War.

00:05:05.821 --> 00:05:08.024
"At the time of delivering his far-echoed

00:05:08.024 --> 00:05:11.741
"war message, in April
1917, the President was

00:05:11.741 --> 00:05:15.006
"cheered by dense multitudes
thronging the streets

00:05:15.006 --> 00:05:17.823
"as he passed from the
White House to the Capital

00:05:17.823 --> 00:05:19.068
"and back again.

00:05:19.068 --> 00:05:21.869
"This is from Tumulty's,"
that's Woodrow Wilson's

00:05:21.869 --> 00:05:24.003
Chief of Staff, or it was
called Private Secretary then.

00:05:24.003 --> 00:05:25.799
"This is from Tumulty's own description

00:05:25.799 --> 00:05:29.037
of the return: 'For a while he,'"

00:05:29.037 --> 00:05:30.444
and we're talking about Woodrow Wilson,

00:05:30.444 --> 00:05:32.803
"'For a while, he sat silent and pale in

00:05:32.803 --> 00:05:34.073
"'the Cabinet room.

00:05:34.073 --> 00:05:36.787
"'At last he said, 'Think what it was they

00:05:36.787 --> 00:05:38.152
"'were applauding.'"

00:05:38.152 --> 00:05:40.339
"'My message today was a message of death

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:41.807
"'for our young men.

00:05:41.807 --> 00:05:46.453
"'How strange it seems to applaud that.'"
