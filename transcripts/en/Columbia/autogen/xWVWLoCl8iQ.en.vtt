communities need to go from the outside
to the from the margins of the

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:36.830
conversations in order for democracies
 

00:32:36.830 --> 00:32:39.279
conversations in order for democracies
to really be fully realized within their

of minorities it's very difficult to

of minorities it's very difficult to
 

00:32:46.129 --> 00:32:48.789
of minorities it's very difficult to
show the actual existence of democracy

00:32:48.789 --> 00:32:48.799
show the actual existence of democracy
 

00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:53.649
show the actual existence of democracy
in one's own country and so we work on a

00:32:53.649 --> 00:32:53.659
in one's own country and so we work on a
 

00:32:53.659 --> 00:32:56.529
in one's own country and so we work on a
variety of places we've now worked in 24

00:32:56.529 --> 00:32:56.539
variety of places we've now worked in 24

countries around the world specifically

00:32:58.690 --> 00:32:58.700

countries around the world specifically
focused right now on a systematic

00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799
focused right now on a systematic
 

00:33:00.799 --> 00:33:01.460
focused right now on a systematic
approach to

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:01.470
approach to
 

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:05.120
approach to
stopping rape in Haiti having women's

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:05.130
stopping rape in Haiti having women's
 

00:33:05.130 --> 00:33:07.039
stopping rape in Haiti having women's
groups local women's groups aggregate

00:33:07.039 --> 00:33:07.049
groups local women's groups aggregate
 

00:33:07.049 --> 00:33:10.820
groups local women's groups aggregate
data on instances of violence so they

00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:10.830
data on instances of violence so they
 

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:12.230
data on instances of violence so they
can then hold their government to

00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240
can then hold their government to
 

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:14.990
can then hold their government to
account so it's very much utilizing

00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000
account so it's very much utilizing
 

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:18.620
account so it's very much utilizing
digital tools to have a legal argument

00:33:18.620 --> 00:33:18.630
digital tools to have a legal argument
 

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.140
digital tools to have a legal argument
where they can push their their

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:21.150
where they can push their their
 

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:23.870
where they can push their their
government and authorities into driving

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880
government and authorities into driving
 

00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:26.740
government and authorities into driving
actual action and if they don't then

00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:26.750
actual action and if they don't then
 

00:33:26.750 --> 00:33:28.669

prosecuting them at the international
level in order to ensure that forcing of

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:40.940

want to make that argument partially to
 

00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:56.980
want to make that argument partially to
sort of give some you know to give a

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:56.990
sort of give some you know to give a
 

00:51:56.990 --> 00:51:59.079
sort of give some you know to give a
sense of what the power is there and

00:51:59.079 --> 00:51:59.089
sense of what the power is there and
 

00:51:59.089 --> 00:52:01.779
sense of what the power is there and
then to sort of end up in some extent to

00:52:01.779 --> 00:52:01.789
then to sort of end up in some extent to
 

00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:03.490
then to sort of end up in some extent to
some extent sort of talking about the

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:03.500
some extent sort of talking about the
 

00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:04.720
some extent sort of talking about the
challenge of doing this in really

00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:04.730
challenge of doing this in really
 

00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:08.319
challenge of doing this in really
difficult places and speak to some

00:52:08.319 --> 00:52:08.329
difficult places and speak to some
 

00:52:08.329 --> 00:52:12.160
difficult places and speak to some
experiences that I had in Iraq in 2004

00:52:12.160 --> 00:52:12.170
experiences that I had in Iraq in 2004
 

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:14.769
experiences that I had in Iraq in 2004
and 2006 trying to get Iraqis to use

00:52:14.769 --> 00:52:14.779
and 2006 trying to get Iraqis to use
 

00:52:14.779 --> 00:52:18.400
and 2006 trying to get Iraqis to use
communications technology so I think the

00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:18.410
communications technology so I think the
 

00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:20.910
communications technology so I think the
first point that has to be made is that

00:52:20.910 --> 00:52:20.920
first point that has to be made is that
 

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.039
first point that has to be made is that
we've had global movements we've had you

00:52:24.039 --> 00:52:24.049
we've had global movements we've had you
 

00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:25.900
we've had global movements we've had you
know sort of global humanitarian global

00:52:25.900 --> 00:52:25.910
know sort of global humanitarian global
 

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:28.720

social movements for a long time does

00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:28.730
social movements for a long time does

social movements for a long time does
anybody here sort of know what were the

00:52:30.099 --> 00:52:30.109
anybody here sort of know what were the
 

00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:32.710
anybody here sort of know what were the
are the two most important movements of

00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720
are the two most important movements of
 

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:34.960
are the two most important movements of
the 1900s that could be called little

00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:34.970
the 1900s that could be called little
 

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:40.359
the 1900s that could be called little
global movements no no historians in the

00:52:40.359 --> 00:52:40.369
global movements no no historians in the
 

00:52:40.369 --> 00:52:42.309
global movements no no historians in the
room so there were two things one of

00:52:42.309 --> 00:52:42.319
room so there were two things one of
 

00:52:42.319 --> 00:52:44.230
room so there were two things one of
which was anti-slavery and the other

00:52:44.230 --> 00:52:44.240
which was anti-slavery and the other
 

00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:46.180
which was anti-slavery and the other
which was women's suffrage now the

00:52:46.180 --> 00:52:46.190
which was women's suffrage now the
 

00:52:46.190 --> 00:52:47.680
which was women's suffrage now the
interesting part about both of these is

00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:47.690
interesting part about both of these is
 

00:52:47.690 --> 00:52:49.779
interesting part about both of these is
they're not usually seen as global

00:52:49.779 --> 00:52:49.789
they're not usually seen as global
 

00:52:49.789 --> 00:52:51.099
they're not usually seen as global

00:52:53.019 --> 00:52:53.029
things which happened in the US but if
 

00:52:53.029 --> 00:52:54.789
things which happened in the US but if
you actually go back and look at the

00:52:54.789 --> 00:52:54.799
you actually go back and look at the
 

00:52:54.799 --> 00:52:56.680
you actually go back and look at the
history you can sort of see you really

00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:56.690
history you can sort of see you really
 

00:52:56.690 --> 00:52:57.970
history you can sort of see you really
can understand what was happening at

00:52:57.970 --> 00:52:57.980
can understand what was happening at
 

00:52:57.980 --> 00:52:59.829
can understand what was happening at
that point but the question well how do

00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839
that point but the question well how do
 

00:52:59.839 --> 00:53:01.240
that point but the question well how do
you actually do a global movement during

00:53:01.240 --> 00:53:01.250
you actually do a global movement during
 

00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:03.880
you actually do a global movement during
that period you had pamphlets you had

00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:03.890
that period you had pamphlets you had
 

00:53:03.890 --> 00:53:06.039
that period you had pamphlets you had
booklets but the real thing was you had

00:53:06.039 --> 00:53:06.049
booklets but the real thing was you had
 

00:53:06.049 --> 00:53:08.710
booklets but the real thing was you had
people who would go you know there's a

00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720

you know they still could 84 different
 

00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:18.099
you know they still could 84 different
countries and I can assure you this took

00:53:18.099 --> 00:53:18.109
countries and I can assure you this took
 

00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:19.430
countries and I can assure you this took
a lot longer than took mark

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440
a lot longer than took mark
 

00:53:19.440 --> 00:53:22.609

was actually the most impressive you
know idea of this so I then went back to

00:54:33.050 --> 00:54:33.060
know idea of this so I then went back to
 

00:54:33.060 --> 00:54:35.270
know idea of this so I then went back to
Wesleyan and you know we tried to figure

00:54:35.270 --> 00:54:35.280
Wesleyan and you know we tried to figure
 

00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:36.829
Wesleyan and you know we tried to figure
out how could we organize this campus

00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839
out how could we organize this campus
 

00:54:36.839 --> 00:54:38.240
out how could we organize this campus
and then how can you know I personally

00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:38.250
and then how can you know I personally
 

00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:40.130

because you know we knew it was
 

00:54:48.839 --> 00:54:50.000
because you know we knew it was
happening Wilson we might have known was

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:50.010
happening Wilson we might have known was
 

00:54:50.010 --> 00:54:52.190
happening Wilson we might have known was
happening yell but was very unfair was

00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200

happening at Harvard at that point and
 

00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:55.069
happening at Harvard at that point and
in fact it wasn't sort of until years

00:54:55.069 --> 00:54:55.079
in fact it wasn't sort of until years
 

00:54:55.079 --> 00:54:56.510
in fact it wasn't sort of until years
later that I actually figured out where

00:54:56.510 --> 00:54:56.520
later that I actually figured out where
 

00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:00.500
later that I actually figured out where
the demands came from because we and you

00:55:00.500 --> 00:55:00.510
the demands came from because we and you
 

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.150
the demands came from because we and you
know it really was a much more isolated

00:55:02.150 --> 00:55:02.160
know it really was a much more isolated
 

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:04.670
know it really was a much more isolated
sort of experience and similarly with

technology is really lo-fi radical so in
 

01:02:51.510 --> 01:02:54.260
technology is really lo-fi radical so in
this case actually think it's that it's

many ways in which these technologies

01:15:44.980 --> 01:15:44.990
many ways in which these technologies
 

01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:47.760
many ways in which these technologies
need to be taught to our young people

01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:47.770
need to be taught to our young people
 

01:15:47.770 --> 01:15:51.640

and I'm thinking where are those rfps
 

01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000
and I'm thinking where are those rfps
where's the money for that who's going

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:01.010
where's the money for that who's going
 

01:16:01.010 --> 01:16:02.650
where's the money for that who's going
to help develop that because that's

01:16:02.650 --> 01:16:02.660
to help develop that because that's
 

01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:05.620
