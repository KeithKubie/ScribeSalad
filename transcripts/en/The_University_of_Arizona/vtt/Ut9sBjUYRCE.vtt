[VIDEO GAME SOUNDS]

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.940
 This is about 5%
of the collection.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.070
It's a distributed archive,
so there are actually,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.410
I think, 12 other
locations around--

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:20.740
mostly in the US, but several in
Europe and Australia, as well.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:23.980
And so all of those places
have different items.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.040
The things that we leave
here are things that

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.430
end up getting requested a lot.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:32.910
Lots of historical games lots of
historical consoles and things

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.610
we leave out because
everything circulates,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.140
so people don't
only want to see it,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.806
they also want it to
be shipped to them,

00:00:38.806 --> 00:00:41.280
which is an unusual thing
that we do in this archive.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.500
We circulate things.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.690
This is the Telematch Panoramic.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.110
It's an Argentinean pong
system, mobile pong system.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.870
So it was really designed
to be carried around.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.220
As you can see, it looks like
a suitcase full of launch codes

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.730
for during the Cold War.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.310
It's five games operated
with a push-button.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.630
You have the instructions
here for playing Submarine

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.370
and Frontón and a kind of
volleyball game, a soccer game,

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.100
and a tennis game.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.995
Frontón is kind of a pong game.

00:01:13.995 --> 00:01:15.620
JUDD RUGGILL: There's
a lot of interest

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.590
in older games and
kind of replaying them

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.310
and in modern situations.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.180
So what you have here is a
collection of basically arcade

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.120
classics all built
into one little device,

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.210
and it allows you to
play Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.540
I think Pole Position is on
here, Zevious, and Mappy.

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.060
KEN MCALLISTER: In its
day, none of those games

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.850
could possibly have
fit into a space

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.685
that small, let alone
5 or 6 of those.

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:42.770
[VIDEO GAME GUNFIRE]

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.270
JUDD RUGGILL: We both grew up
reading crappy science fiction

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.547
and fantasy novels, and they can
have a really profound effect

00:01:48.547 --> 00:01:50.130
on the way in which
you see the world,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.440
and the same is true for games.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.898
 Yeah, these things
are inspiring.

00:01:52.898 --> 00:01:54.300
I mean, they build creativity.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.710
They build imagination.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.860
They shape our hopes and dreams
about what we could really do.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.230
How many of the things
that we see around

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.560
our campus were inspired by
people playing video games,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.940
by reading science fiction
as kids, reading comic books,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.640
watching movies, watching TV
shows, and wondering, geez,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:13.320
could I do that?

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.819
I wonder if we could
really do that.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.860
And I think a lot of
times, the answer is yes.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.360
 Whoa!

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.357
