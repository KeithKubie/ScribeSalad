00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.830
Isolated tribes live all over the planet,
humans who have NO IDEA what YouTube is, and

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.450
have never seen an iPhone, or a metal knife.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.980
How come they're still out there?

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.470
Hello everyone, Trace here reporting for DNews.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.339
In late June a previously isolated tribe in
Brazil walked out of the Amazon rainforest

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.949
and peacefully approached a team of government
scientists.

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.080
This was the first time in 20 years they'd
done so!

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.590
The Brazilian Indian Affairs Department or
FUNAI, said it wasn't a normal approach and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:34.590
was worried.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.790
They believe illegal logging forced these
people from their ancestral homes.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.300
There are humans all over this planet who
still live like our ancient ancestors.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.280
There may be 100 different isolated groups
across the Amazon and New Guinea, on islands

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.970
off the coast of India, and in Malaysia and
central Africa.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.490
Even the most isolated usually make contact
with OTHER tribes and some of those secondary

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.980
tribes contact the local government regularly.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.871
Not to mention, anthropologists attempt to
photograph these people from the air, and

00:01:01.871 --> 00:01:05.830
missionaries attempt to evangelize on the
ground -- so even if they don't understand

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:10.490
what that giant metal bird is, they know other
humans are around.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.970
The largest isolated tribal area on earth
is in South America.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.180
The Peruvian and Brazilian governments have
laws reserving land for these tribes to live

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.180
on.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.210
Brazil used to forcibly assimilate tribes,
but now they have a policy of non-interference,

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.060
similar to Star Trek's Prime Directive.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.010
Which sounds great on paper, but most reserves
end up being ravaged by illegal oil, logging,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.280
mining and drug-trafficking practices, driving
the tribes away or killing them.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.360
There are stories of tribes who fight back
being killed in all sorts of gruesome ways.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.600
Brazil has confirmed that 67 isolated tribes,
and Peru has 15 -- numbering more than 500

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.600
people.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.190
The smallest known isolated tribe on our planet
is difficult to pinpoint.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.659
There are tribes of only a handful of individuals,
down to just one.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.590
A man in his 40s living in the Brazilian state
of RondÃ´nia (HONduonia) is the last survivor

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.890
of his tribe, the rest likely being killed
by modern humans.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.190
No one knows his name or his lost tribe.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.390
[Do we have a source or is this widely reported?

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:12.200
In 2010, he was on the run from locals trying
to chase him off his land to develop it.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.280
His huts were bulldozed, and he was alone.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.920
He killed an encroaching man by shooting an
arrow into his chest.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.920
Yikes.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:19.970
He's still out there somewhere].

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.000
The most isolated tribe in the world is a
tough one to guess, but there are two known

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.319
tribes on the Andaman Islands off the coast
of India.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.870
The most famous of the two are the Sentinelese
who were described in 1290 by Marco Polo,

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.970
as "a most violent and cruel generation."

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.989
They have no desire to join modern society.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.080
They've fought off National Geographic and
police helicopters with bows and arrows, and

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.250
kill fisherman who land on their island.

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.390
Estimates say there may be as few as 40, but
we can't get close enough to tell.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.780
The dangers to these isolated tribes are many,
and it's not just loggers with chainsaws or

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.300
drug traffickers with guns.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.349
In 1980, a mission trip from Florida set up
camp in Colombia near the isolated Nukak tribe

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.130
hoping to evangelize them.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.400
Since these tribes are mainly living hunter-gatherer
lifestyles the missionaries brought metal

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.450
tools to gain their trust.

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.099
But because of the Nukak's lack of immunity
to modern viruses and bacteria, the missionaries

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.569
brought axes, machetes and disease.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.440
They were stricken with respiratory infections
and other diseases before being treated.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.819
Most of them now live in poverty in a city
near their old land.

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:31.849
A study in Nature[a] of 238 indigenous populations
in South America found declines averaged 43-percent

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.910
after contact with outsiders.

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.140
Even simply contacting the tribes directly
completely changes their chosen way of life.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.819
Remember that tribe from the beginning?

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.629
A month later, they'd emerged again, with
the flu.

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.880
Which brings to mind a whole OTHER consideration.

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.870
Should we leave these people be?

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.460
Or find a way to contact them?

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.720
We've got a comments section, so go use it.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.250
