00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Okay. So here we are in our Editor again, and this is the basic HTML file

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
we were editing before and that we were opening in our browser.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
We're going to go back to this a little bit so we can learn

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
some new form elements.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
So the first thing I'm going to do is remove the Action parameter

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
from the Form element so that we can submit

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the form to itself and we'll see the "q" parameter in the URL again.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This makes it easy to demonstrate what's going on,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
without having to go back to our app Server and all of that stuff.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
So I removed that; let's go to our browser and let's give this form a test.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So I reload the page,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I type in: "some junk" here,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which it autocompletes for me.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I click Submit,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and we see "some junk" in the URL:

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
q=some+junk.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Okay. Let's go back to our Editor.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So here we are in our Editor.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
One thing that I'm leaving off is the Type parameter on this first input.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
So let's go ahead and add that:

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
type="text"--

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
type="text" is the default type of an input parameter.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I didn't include it originally because I didn't want to

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
spend a whole lot of time talking about that, at the time.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But in reality, we want to be a little bit more specific with our types,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
especially now that we're going to learn some new types.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So if I change that to type "text" the behavior won't change in the browser.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And the first thing we're going to do is learn a new type.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
So instead of being "text"

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
we're going to change this to "password".

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
The "password" type is useful for entering passwords in a text box.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Okay--so here we are in our browser.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Now when we type some text into the box here,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
it appears as dots instead of the actual text.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So for the next quiz, what I'd like you to do is

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
tell me what happens when I click the Submit button.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You can try this out on your own, at home.
