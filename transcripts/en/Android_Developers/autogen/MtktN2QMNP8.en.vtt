00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:18.050 align:start position:0%
um so I think the short answer to that
is<00:07:15.900><c> it</c><00:07:16.710><c> there</c><00:07:17.160><c> there</c><00:07:17.490><c> wasn't</c><00:07:17.700><c> a</c><00:07:17.880><c> lot</c><00:07:18.030><c> of</c>

00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:17.110 align:start position:0%
we couldn't do that then we weren't

we couldn't do that then we weren't

the actual best metric for this thing we

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.420 align:start position:0%
think that we're designing for people's

00:20:10.420 --> 00:20:10.430 align:start position:0%

00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.470 align:start position:0%
that what game mode stress mode
I<00:20:12.650><c> think</c><00:20:13.100><c> what's</c><00:20:13.250><c> funny</c><00:20:13.430><c> is</c><00:20:13.580><c> people</c><00:20:14.120><c> when</c><00:20:14.300><c> they</c>

00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
I think what's funny is people when they
 

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.570 align:start position:0%
I think what's funny is people when they
like<00:20:14.870><c> a</c><00:20:15.200><c> research</c><00:20:15.800><c> project</c><00:20:15.980><c> I</c><00:20:16.190><c> ran</c><00:20:16.370><c> that</c><00:20:16.490><c> you</c>

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:16.580 align:start position:0%
like a research project I ran that you
 

00:20:16.580 --> 00:20:18.700 align:start position:0%
like a research project I ran that you

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:18.710 align:start position:0%

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:19.900 align:start position:0%

really<00:20:18.890><c> weird</c><00:20:19.130><c> to</c><00:20:19.250><c> ask</c><00:20:19.430><c> people</c><00:20:19.640><c> what</c><00:20:19.820><c> their</c>

00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:19.910 align:start position:0%
really weird to ask people what their

really weird to ask people what their

00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:27.290 align:start position:0%
about the tray and I was like okay
 

00:20:27.290 --> 00:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
about the tray and I was like okay
forgot<00:20:27.620><c> the</c><00:20:27.710><c> tray</c><00:20:27.950><c> like</c><00:20:28.160><c> I</c><00:20:29.030><c> went</c><00:20:29.210><c> to</c><00:20:29.330><c> people</c>

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:29.570 align:start position:0%

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:32.710 align:start position:0%
and was like you know you know what
airplane<00:20:31.310><c> mode</c><00:20:31.490><c> is</c><00:20:31.640><c> give</c><00:20:32.000><c> me</c><00:20:32.090><c> like</c><00:20:32.240><c> ten</c><00:20:32.510><c> more</c>

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
airplane mode is give me like ten more
 

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.650 align:start position:0%
airplane mode is give me like ten more
and<00:20:33.080><c> all</c><00:20:33.620><c> of</c><00:20:34.010><c> their</c><00:20:34.160><c> modes</c><00:20:34.430><c> were</c><00:20:34.820><c> moods</c><00:20:35.090><c> they</c>

00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:35.660 align:start position:0%
and all of their modes were moods they

and all of their modes were moods they
weren't<00:20:35.840><c> modes</c><00:20:35.990><c> at</c><00:20:36.110><c> all</c><00:20:36.230><c> so</c><00:20:36.590><c> just</c><00:20:36.620><c> that</c><00:20:37.130><c> like</c>

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:37.310 align:start position:0%
weren't modes at all so just that like
 

00:20:37.310 --> 00:20:39.340 align:start position:0%
weren't modes at all so just that like
little<00:20:37.610><c> the</c><00:20:37.880><c> extra</c><00:20:38.060><c> Oh</c><00:20:38.300><c> makes</c><00:20:38.840><c> a</c><00:20:38.930><c> difference</c><00:20:39.230><c> I</c>

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:39.350 align:start position:0%
little the extra Oh makes a difference I
 

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:41.050 align:start position:0%
little the extra Oh makes a difference I
think<00:20:39.530><c> like</c><00:20:39.680><c> intuitively</c><00:20:40.370><c> being</c><00:20:40.610><c> like</c><00:20:40.790><c> oh</c><00:20:40.970><c> I</c>

00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:41.060 align:start position:0%
think like intuitively being like oh I
 

00:20:41.060 --> 00:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
think like intuitively being like oh I
think<00:20:41.270><c> that's</c><00:20:41.540><c> right</c><00:20:41.810><c> how</c><00:20:42.110><c> do</c><00:20:42.170><c> I</c><00:20:42.260><c> make</c><00:20:42.350><c> a</c>

00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:42.650 align:start position:0%
think that's right how do I make a
 

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
think that's right how do I make a
metric<00:20:43.070><c> for</c><00:20:43.100><c> that</c><00:20:43.400><c> yeah</c><00:20:43.730><c> you</c><00:20:44.390><c> talked</c><00:20:44.600><c> about</c>

00:20:44.940 --> 00:20:44.950 align:start position:0%
metric for that yeah you talked about
 

00:20:44.950 --> 00:20:47.260 align:start position:0%
metric for that yeah you talked about
kind<00:20:45.950><c> of</c><00:20:45.980><c> you</c><00:20:46.070><c> know</c><00:20:46.160><c> maybe</c><00:20:46.310><c> mimicking</c><00:20:46.760><c> a</c><00:20:46.820><c> great</c>

is<00:30:17.840><c> users</c><00:30:18.350><c> seem</c><00:30:18.559><c> happier</c><00:30:18.980><c> and</c><00:30:19.250><c> so</c><00:30:19.520><c> therefore</c>

00:30:19.750 --> 00:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
is users seem happier and so therefore
 

00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:22.750 align:start position:0%
is users seem happier and so therefore
for<00:30:20.179><c> us</c><00:30:20.270><c> it's</c><00:30:20.480><c> a</c><00:30:20.570><c> win</c><00:30:20.750><c> and</c><00:30:21.049><c> so</c><00:30:21.650><c> I</c><00:30:21.679><c> think</c><00:30:21.980><c> I</c><00:30:22.429><c> don't</c>

00:30:22.750 --> 00:30:22.760 align:start position:0%
for us it's a win and so I think I don't
 

00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:24.669 align:start position:0%
for us it's a win and so I think I don't

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:06.420 align:start position:0%
and I think when we tend to design stuff
 

00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:08.210 align:start position:0%
and I think when we tend to design stuff
we<00:31:06.630><c> look</c><00:31:06.810><c> at</c><00:31:06.930><c> it</c><00:31:07.020><c> within</c><00:31:07.170><c> the</c><00:31:07.410><c> container</c><00:31:07.740><c> so</c>

00:31:08.210 --> 00:31:08.220 align:start position:0%
we look at it within the container so
 

00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.130 align:start position:0%
we look at it within the container so
it's<00:31:08.370><c> like</c><00:31:08.550><c> blow</c><00:31:08.970><c> away</c><00:31:09.150><c> the</c><00:31:09.390><c> container</c><00:31:09.810><c> and</c>

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:10.140 align:start position:0%
it's like blow away the container and
 

00:31:10.140 --> 00:31:11.900 align:start position:0%
it's like blow away the container and
then<00:31:10.530><c> I</c><00:31:10.710><c> think</c><00:31:10.920><c> the</c><00:31:11.040><c> other</c><00:31:11.070><c> piece</c><00:31:11.520><c> of</c><00:31:11.550><c> that</c><00:31:11.760><c> is</c>

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:11.910 align:start position:0%
