1
00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.220
That doesn't look like something you want to use in your house.

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.420
You're gonna ruin your floors.
Put rubber on the floor,
rubber on the floor,

3
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.810
put rubber all over your house so nothing gets ruined.
Did you,

4
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:13.710
do you have grandparents who put plastic over the furniture?
Oh yeah.
My Nana.

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.300
My Nana in Clifton,
New Jersey.
Yeah.
My mind was in New York.
Yeah,

6
00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.550
they put fucking plastic over the furniture.
It was a big deal.

7
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:25.620
You spent a lot of money on that couch.
You're gonna.

8
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:28.740
It's gonna has to last their whole life fuse where I was a little kid,

9
00:00:28.741 --> 00:00:30.960
I'd sit on that couch,
I'll be like,
this is terrible.

10
00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.460
Especially in the summer with your shorts and your,
the back legs.

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.680
Just be sweating it man.
And this.

12
00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.690
And they eventually got kind of like yellowed by the sun and by use crackly.

13
00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.710
So it was weird.
Yeah.
It was like,
oh,

14
00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.850
you would like put like a jacket down and then he would sit on your jacket.

15
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.450
That whole generation never had comfort.
Like their beds were hard,

16
00:00:51.451 --> 00:00:56.320
the pillows were shit like that.
Look up through the fucking depression,
man.

17
00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.840
Yeah,
that's,
that's real,
that shit.
People Starve to death.

18
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.120
This was barbaric time where,
where people were brought down to,
you know,

19
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.710
base humanity just was rival rough.
And then you have like,

20
00:01:10.711 --> 00:01:15.540
you have like 15 good years and then go into World War II and they dealt with

21
00:01:15.541 --> 00:01:18.630
that.
So yeah,
they were like,
we don't need comfort.

22
00:01:18.631 --> 00:01:22.320
We're not laying around in our sweat pants on bean bag chairs.
Will,

23
00:01:22.321 --> 00:01:26.010
they knew the importance of being vigilant.
Right.
Like we all do.
Do you ever,

24
00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:30.720
do you follow I'm David Goggins Online?
Yeah.
David,
do you know where he is?

25
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.040
No.
David Goggins is this navy seal who,
um,

26
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.570
now is more or less a,
uh,

27
00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.650
like a motivational and a fitness influencer run.

28
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.890
The Guy who runs,
oh dude,
broken knees.
That was a fucking savage.
Yeah,

29
00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.150
I've seen some of his clips.
How many?
100 mile runs that he'd run in a row.

30
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.070
Some fucking preposterous number.
Yeah.
I don't remember.
I don't want to say,

31
00:01:56.071 --> 00:01:57.870
cause I can't remember it all.
I want to say six or seven.

32
00:01:57.871 --> 00:02:00.330
But then it's like 12 or 13 of 100 mile member.

33
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:03.780
I don't remember it all but there his whole thing is stay hard.

34
00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.800
Like he'll send me a text out of nowhere.
Like just say stay odd motherfucker.

35
00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.470
Don't go soft out there.
Yeah.
Cause like first of all,

36
00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:15.750
if you're a navy seal,
right?

37
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.810
This is the pinnacle of hand to hand combat and armed forces.

38
00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.910
Those motherfuckers are all special humans.
Yeah.

39
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.460
And then on top of those motherfuckers being all special humans,

40
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.590
there's guys that can just just put a little of that message out like hey you,

41
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.090
you are soft as fuck compared to how people used to be.
Right.

42
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.090
All soft as fuck.
Compared to those world war two people,
those state,

43
00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.800
you've got to stay vigilant.
Back then everybody had to stay vigilant.
Yeah.
Yeah.

44
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.070
You had to deal with just day to day life,

45
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.110
you have to deal with what was coming from Hitler,

46
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.720
what a tune in at a certain time to find out what was happening.
Yeah.

47
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.010
Everybody had to gather around the TV for the news.

48
00:02:56.011 --> 00:02:58.150
That was all the news you got.
That's all the news you got.

49
00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.860
You only got an hour's worth.
That was it.

50
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.430
They just know what the fuck was going on,
nothing,
nothing.

51
00:03:03.431 --> 00:03:07.290
And they were better report and they may just say really whatsapp.

52
00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.020
So tired of that.
They were better off for it.
I don't need to know.

53
00:03:11.021 --> 00:03:12.160
Not better off for it.

54
00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.660
Way Better off recognizing that you're luckier than those people having some

55
00:03:16.661 --> 00:03:17.860
fucking discipline,

56
00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:22.900
watching a David Goggins Instagram clip and get your fucking shit together.
Tom.

57
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.180
No,
I'm not.
I agree with everything you just said.

58
00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.550
I agree with everything you just said,
but I'm saying you're better.

59
00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.430
They were better off not being fed a news diet 24 hours a day.
Yeah.

60
00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.460
Mentally,

61
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.270
mentally pour the first human beings that have had to deal with this onslaught.
