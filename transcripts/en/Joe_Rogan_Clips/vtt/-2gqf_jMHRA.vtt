The Joe Rogan experience,
how do you know that you're not going to,

2
00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.890
a common thing is when comedians steal jokes.
Cheerio.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:09.930
So when you're writing and you're like,
yeah,

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:11.340
I'm going to do this as awesome idea.

5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:16.260
How do you know that that content already hasn't been,
uh,
been been discussed?

6
00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.460
Well,
always.
You don't always,
um,

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.560
you could absolutely write something and have parallel thinking,

8
00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.750
write something and not even know that someone's already written it.
Right?

9
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.560
But you,
there's a difference between that stealing.
Like,
you know what,

10
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.050
when someone's,
like,
if you come up with,
if you

11
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.300
look at something,
whatever it is,
like,
um,
say maybe you,

12
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:41.040
your wife sends you to,
uh,
to the grocery store to pick up some tampons,
right?

13
00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.790
And it has a,
the price things all fucked up.

14
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.200
And so the guy has yellow price tag tampons.
Tampons.
Yeah.
Right.

15
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.860
There has been like a hundred Christ done bits on that.
Right.

16
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.520
And it's not that they're stealing,
they probably didn't hear anybody do it.

17
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.000
They thought it was funny.
They thought it up themselves and they did.

18
00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.420
Or maybe it even happen to them.
Right.
They did it.
That's parallel thinking.

19
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.900
It's a common one.
Right?

20
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.290
And then there's other people that did hear someone do it and they stole it.

21
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.540
That's a different thing.
That's the worst.
Right?

22
00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.380
But you could get both of those things from that same subject.
Right.
That same,

23
00:01:13.381 --> 00:01:15.550
really common.
Easy to think of subject.
Right.

24
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.970
There's a lot of those with cops and donuts.
There's a lot of,

25
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.940
there's a lot of things that are like a part of the lexicon.

26
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.550
They're like a part of,
they're part of the way we talk.

27
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.760
There are a part of culture and you could think you thought them up,

28
00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:28.920
but you didn't.
It's almost like Seinfeld in a way.
It's like,
Shit,

29
00:01:28.921 --> 00:01:32.250
I should happen to everyone.
Sure.
Right?
Sure.
Um,

30
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.710
but then there's stuff that's clearly yours.

31
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.810
Like if you did a whole bit about how you built a Tesla,

32
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.760
right?
You know,
and that you think,

33
00:01:41.761 --> 00:01:44.670
and then you got paranoid heavy hitter and you thought Elan Musk is plotting

34
00:01:44.671 --> 00:01:48.330
against you.
You could something to that.

35
00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.290
And that would be something that's wholly unique to you.
I mean,

36
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:56.350
how many fucking people have built a Tesla is,
or even 20 on the earth height.

37
00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.750
I at this point,
yeah,
probably maybe 20 let's pretend.

38
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:06.050
Let's pretend that out of 7 billion plus population of human beings,

39
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.160
maybe 20 people have done what you've done.

40
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:12.530
But as I get old though you that one bit,
that's okay.
I can't,

41
00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.950
but you can the same sauce.
You just talk about other things then,
right?

42
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.280
Like you could talk about anything that you find interesting.
Personal Shit,

43
00:02:20.281 --> 00:02:25.140
technology,
world events,
worrying about the environment.
You know all this.

44
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.870
Anything that I did that whale really have a bomb strapped.
Right?

45
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.190
I keep thinking about that over.
No I not.
Yeah,
I mean,
and then if you,

46
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.930
maybe it was like someone from CNN that fucking hates the Russians,
right?

47
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.730
You know,
like wanting to blame everything on the,
and it's like,
yeah,
they,

48
00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.660
they got duped for two years saying that there was collusion and that pastor

49
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.080
Trump was going down.
They colluded with Russia.

50
00:02:46.081 --> 00:02:49.500
And it turns out that the Mueller report doesn't really necessarily say that.

51
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.410
And then they're like,
fuck,
we gotta do something.

52
00:02:51.411 --> 00:02:52.780
I got from these Goddamn Russians yet.

53
00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.520
So they hired this whale and they put a strap on and

54
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.080
that allows a good story.
Shit,
I got a bad cough.
So,
so that,
that is,

55
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.240
you write all this stuff down,
right?
You're right.
Like,
you know,
1700 words,

56
00:03:04.241 --> 00:03:07.740
2000 words.
Out of that,
I might get one line really,
maybe.
