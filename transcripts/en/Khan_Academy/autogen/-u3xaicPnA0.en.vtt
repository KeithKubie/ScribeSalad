and the symphony or whatever whatever it
might be all of those so so how much

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489
might be all of those so so how much
 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.900
might be all of those so so how much
truth is that is there to that and and

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910
truth is that is there to that and and
 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.990
truth is that is there to that and and
or not I think the things that you've

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000
or not I think the things that you've
 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.459
or not I think the things that you've
just described are components uh that a

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469
just described are components uh that a
 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.819
just described are components uh that a
certain student might have as part of

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
certain student might have as part of
 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.340
certain student might have as part of
their application and it is not the

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350
their application and it is not the
 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.980
their application and it is not the
first way that we think about evaluating

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990
first way that we think about evaluating
 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.149
first way that we think about evaluating
students so we think about trying to

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159
students so we think about trying to
 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.789
students so we think about trying to
enroll students that are going to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
enroll students that are going to
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.230
enroll students that are going to
succeed academically on our campuses who

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240
succeed academically on our campuses who
 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.620
succeed academically on our campuses who
are going to be a well matched to our

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630
are going to be a well matched to our
 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.530
are going to be a well matched to our
institution so that the kinds of things

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540
institution so that the kinds of things
 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.520
institution so that the kinds of things
that motivates those students they get

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530
that motivates those students they get
 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.219
that motivates those students they get
them excited are the things and the

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229
them excited are the things and the
 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.550
them excited are the things and the
culture on our campus and then we think

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560
culture on our campus and then we think
 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.200
culture on our campus and then we think
about what kind of contributions that

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
about what kind of contributions that
 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.179
about what kind of contributions that
those students might be able to make to

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189
those students might be able to make to
 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.179
those students might be able to make to
our campuses which might mean any

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189
our campuses which might mean any
 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.600
our campuses which might mean any
particular kinds of talent that they

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610
particular kinds of talent that they
 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.940
particular kinds of talent that they
have but also how engage they're going

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950
have but also how engage they're going
 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.420
have but also how engage they're going
to be can the life of the universe so

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430
to be can the life of the universe so
 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:54.770
to be can the life of the universe so
that's really the lens that we're

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
that's really the lens that we're
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.289
that's really the lens that we're
looking through and students can

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299
looking through and students can
 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.600
looking through and students can
manifest those things and demonstrate

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610
manifest those things and demonstrate
 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.889
manifest those things and demonstrate
those things in different ways so you

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899
those things in different ways so you
 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.550
those things in different ways so you
talked about the number of KP classes

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560
talked about the number of KP classes
 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.320
talked about the number of KP classes
and things like that that students might

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330
and things like that that students might
 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.690
and things like that that students might
have and you know for us we're looking

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700
have and you know for us we're looking
 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.830
have and you know for us we're looking
at

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840
at
 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.050
at
choices that students have made around

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060
choices that students have made around
 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.000
choices that students have made around
their academics but also their

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010
their academics but also their
 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.300
their academics but also their
non-academic so academically we want to

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310
non-academic so academically we want to
 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.530
non-academic so academically we want to
see that students are challenging

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540
see that students are challenging
 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.140
see that students are challenging
themselves in the things that really

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150
themselves in the things that really
 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.729
themselves in the things that really
interest them and students can do that

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739
interest them and students can do that
 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.020
interest them and students can do that
in any number of different weddings AP

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030
in any number of different weddings AP
 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.759
in any number of different weddings AP
classes may be one but there are other

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769
classes may be one but there are other
 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.619
classes may be one but there are other
ways of doing that as well and not all

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629
ways of doing that as well and not all
 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:39.420
ways of doing that as well and not all
students that have even access to AP

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430
students that have even access to AP
 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.650
students that have even access to AP
classes and it's not as though there's a

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660
classes and it's not as though there's a
 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.690
classes and it's not as though there's a
particular tally or score sheet that we

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700
particular tally or score sheet that we
 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.360
particular tally or score sheet that we
have where we're looking at a student's

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370
have where we're looking at a student's
 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.830
have where we're looking at a student's
record and saying they have to have

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840
record and saying they have to have
 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.080
record and saying they have to have
certain markers because really there are

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090
certain markers because really there are
 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.360
certain markers because really there are
all different kinds of markers all

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370
all different kinds of markers all
 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.500
all different kinds of markers all
different ways that students can

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510
different ways that students can
 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.020
different ways that students can
demonstrate these different talents

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030
demonstrate these different talents
 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.759
demonstrate these different talents
so certainly academically as I said

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769
so certainly academically as I said
 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.500
so certainly academically as I said
earlier not all students have access to

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510
earlier not all students have access to
 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.140
earlier not all students have access to
taking AP classes so there may be other

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150
taking AP classes so there may be other
 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.089
taking AP classes so there may be other
ways that students can demonstrate to us

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099
ways that students can demonstrate to us
 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:17.009
ways that students can demonstrate to us
that academically they're going to be

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019
that academically they're going to be
 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.819
that academically they're going to be
ready to succeed on our campus so there

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829
ready to succeed on our campus so there
 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.160
ready to succeed on our campus so there
are these two realities on one extreme

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170
are these two realities on one extreme
 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.930
are these two realities on one extreme
you have and this is maybe the more

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940
you have and this is maybe the more
 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.640
you have and this is maybe the more
traditional reality the students taking

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650
traditional reality the students taking
 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.530
traditional reality the students taking
a lot of very rigorous courses doing a

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540
a lot of very rigorous courses doing a
 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.000
a lot of very rigorous courses doing a
lot of homework staying until 2:00 in

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010
lot of homework staying until 2:00 in
 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:30.720
lot of homework staying until 2:00 in
the morning

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730
the morning
 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.580
the morning
they're very stressed out they frankly

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590
they're very stressed out they frankly
 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.190
they're very stressed out they frankly
don't have time to pursue their passions

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200
don't have time to pursue their passions
 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.990
don't have time to pursue their passions
on the other side you could have

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000
on the other side you could have
 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.839
on the other side you could have
students who aren't in a traditional

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849
students who aren't in a traditional
 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.940
students who aren't in a traditional
system maybe and maybe I don't even have

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950
system maybe and maybe I don't even have
 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.229
system maybe and maybe I don't even have
traditional grades but they're able to

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239
traditional grades but they're able to
 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:44.330
traditional grades but they're able to
show evidence of their academic

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340
show evidence of their academic
 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.740
show evidence of their academic
knowledge through standardized tests

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750
knowledge through standardized tests
 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.960
knowledge through standardized tests
through maybe they take things like the

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970
through maybe they take things like the
 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.670
through maybe they take things like the
AP tests themselves maybe the

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:50.680
AP tests themselves maybe the
 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.129
AP tests themselves maybe the
independent study for it maybe they take

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139
independent study for it maybe they take
 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:54.930
independent study for it maybe they take
some college courses but they have more

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940
some college courses but they have more
 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.819
some college courses but they have more
time to pursue their passions and build

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829
time to pursue their passions and build
 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:58.920
time to pursue their passions and build
portfolios I mean on some levels based

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930
portfolios I mean on some levels based
 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:59.789
portfolios I mean on some levels based
on what I'm hearing it sounds like that

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799
on what I'm hearing it sounds like that
 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:01.080
on what I'm hearing it sounds like that
second student might even be at an

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:01.090
second student might even be at an
 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.030
second student might even be at an
advantage I think students that are

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040
advantage I think students that are
 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.610
advantage I think students that are
overloading themselves their coursework

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620
overloading themselves their coursework
 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.020
overloading themselves their coursework
where they don't leave any time for

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030
where they don't leave any time for
 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.120
where they don't leave any time for
anything else are definitely doing

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130
anything else are definitely doing
 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.849
anything else are definitely doing
themselves a disservice I think students

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:14.859
themselves a disservice I think students
 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:16.710
themselves a disservice I think students
against challenge themselves in areas

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720
against challenge themselves in areas
 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.050
against challenge themselves in areas
that interest them but I think students

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060
that interest them but I think students
 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.240
that interest them but I think students
also really need to leave themselves

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250
also really need to leave themselves
 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:26.730
also really need to leave themselves
time and capacity to pursue more

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740
time and capacity to pursue more
 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.629
time and capacity to pursue more
independent

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:27.639
independent
 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:30.300
independent
projects independent I don't mean by

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310
projects independent I don't mean by
 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.980
projects independent I don't mean by
themselves independent projects could

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990
themselves independent projects could
 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.020
themselves independent projects could
mean with other people certainly but

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030
mean with other people certainly but
 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.510
mean with other people certainly but
these other projects that allow students

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520
these other projects that allow students
 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.059
these other projects that allow students
to use some creativity and independent

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069
to use some creativity and independent
 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.760
to use some creativity and independent
thought and coming up with some new and

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770
thought and coming up with some new and
 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.980
thought and coming up with some new and
interesting things and whatever topics

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990
interesting things and whatever topics
 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.459
interesting things and whatever topics
interest them oh those are the kinds of

00:04:50.459 --> 00:04:50.469
interest them oh those are the kinds of
 

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:53.209
interest them oh those are the kinds of
things that we also really like to see

00:04:53.209 --> 00:04:53.219
things that we also really like to see
 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:55.140
things that we also really like to see
students submit as part of their

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150
students submit as part of their
 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.600
students submit as part of their
application we really like to see it and

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610
application we really like to see it and
 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.029
application we really like to see it and
those kinds of projects can really help

00:05:00.029 --> 00:05:00.039
those kinds of projects can really help
 

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:02.999
those kinds of projects can really help
students because it can show that it can

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:03.009
students because it can show that it can
 

00:05:03.009 --> 00:05:06.089
students because it can show that it can
show us kinds of things that students

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099
show us kinds of things that students
 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:07.920
show us kinds of things that students
might want to pursue once they come to

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930
might want to pursue once they come to
 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.100
might want to pursue once they come to
campus and so on the academic side

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110
campus and so on the academic side
 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:12.839
campus and so on the academic side
really we're just looking for evidence

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:12.849
really we're just looking for evidence
 

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:14.879
really we're just looking for evidence
that students are talented and capable

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:14.889
that students are talented and capable
 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:16.879
that students are talented and capable
and that they're going to do well and

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:16.889
and that they're going to do well and
 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:21.059
and that they're going to do well and
beyond that we're looking at the rest of

00:05:21.059 --> 00:05:21.069
beyond that we're looking at the rest of
 

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:23.700
beyond that we're looking at the rest of
it and those into the portfolio's of

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:23.710
it and those into the portfolio's of
 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.519
it and those into the portfolio's of
students can submit showing the

00:05:26.519 --> 00:05:26.529
students can submit showing the
 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:28.469
students can submit showing the
independent work that they've done can

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479
independent work that they've done can
 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:31.050
independent work that they've done can
really enhance their applications so the

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060
really enhance their applications so the
 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.429
really enhance their applications so the
student you know just to make it

00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:32.439
student you know just to make it
 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:34.350
student you know just to make it
concrete a student with strong SAT

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360
concrete a student with strong SAT
 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.179
concrete a student with strong SAT
scores ones that would show are a CT

00:05:36.179 --> 00:05:36.189
scores ones that would show are a CT
 

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:37.290
scores ones that would show are a CT
scores that show evidence that they

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300
scores that show evidence that they
 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.510
scores that show evidence that they
would do well at a place like MIT strong

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520
would do well at a place like MIT strong
 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.420
would do well at a place like MIT strong
maybe ap scores and the rigorous ones

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:42.430
maybe ap scores and the rigorous ones
 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:45.089
maybe ap scores and the rigorous ones
that they they have an interest in plus

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099
that they they have an interest in plus
 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:47.369
that they they have an interest in plus
a portfolio of things that they've you

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:47.379
a portfolio of things that they've you
 

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:48.809
a portfolio of things that they've you
know substantive things that they've

00:05:48.809 --> 00:05:48.819
know substantive things that they've
 

00:05:48.819 --> 00:05:50.459
know substantive things that they've
done not just kind of cookbook projects

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:50.469
done not just kind of cookbook projects
 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:53.100
done not just kind of cookbook projects
but things that were really show their

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110
but things that were really show their
 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:55.769
but things that were really show their
passions they would have a strong

00:05:55.769 --> 00:05:55.779
passions they would have a strong
 

00:05:55.779 --> 00:05:56.990
passions they would have a strong
application

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:57.000
application
 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.700
application
those students would have a very strong

00:05:59.700 --> 00:05:59.710
those students would have a very strong
 

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:01.860
those students would have a very strong
application so I mean that brings up

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:01.870
application so I mean that brings up
 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:03.269
application so I mean that brings up
another interesting dimension I mean at

00:06:03.269 --> 00:06:03.279
another interesting dimension I mean at
 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:05.550
another interesting dimension I mean at
the other extreme end of this you do

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.560
the other extreme end of this you do
 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:07.709
the other extreme end of this you do
have some homeschool students you have

00:06:07.709 --> 00:06:07.719
have some homeschool students you have
 

00:06:07.719 --> 00:06:09.990
have some homeschool students you have
this unschooling movement but how do you

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000
this unschooling movement but how do you
 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.490
this unschooling movement but how do you
evaluate those students and I actually

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:11.500
evaluate those students and I actually
 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.779
evaluate those students and I actually
even compared them relative to the

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789
even compared them relative to the
 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:14.249
even compared them relative to the
students who are taking the 5 AP classes

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:14.259
students who are taking the 5 AP classes
 

00:06:14.259 --> 00:06:16.139
students who are taking the 5 AP classes
at a traditional college prep school

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:16.149
at a traditional college prep school
 

00:06:16.149 --> 00:06:18.300
at a traditional college prep school
right so I think thinking about

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310
right so I think thinking about
 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.149
right so I think thinking about
homeschool students is a great a great

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:21.159
homeschool students is a great a great
 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:24.869
homeschool students is a great a great
way to demonstrate the fact that it's

00:06:24.869 --> 00:06:24.879
way to demonstrate the fact that it's
 

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:27.809
way to demonstrate the fact that it's
not just about the AP classes because we

00:06:27.809 --> 00:06:27.819
not just about the AP classes because we
 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:30.209
not just about the AP classes because we
have a home school students we're very

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:30.219
have a home school students we're very
 

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:33.659
have a home school students we're very
successful and do successful in our

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669
successful and do successful in our
 

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:35.249
successful and do successful in our
process certainly but also become very

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:35.259
process certainly but also become very
 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:38.879
process certainly but also become very
successful once at MIT we do need

00:06:38.879 --> 00:06:38.889
successful once at MIT we do need
 

00:06:38.889 --> 00:06:41.100
successful once at MIT we do need
evidence though that they're going to do

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:41.110
evidence though that they're going to do
 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.399
evidence though that they're going to do
well

00:06:41.399 --> 00:06:41.409
well
 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:43.199
well
and there are a number of ways that

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:43.209
and there are a number of ways that
 

00:06:43.209 --> 00:06:47.129
and there are a number of ways that
students can demonstrate that to us it

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:47.139
students can demonstrate that to us it
 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.109
students can demonstrate that to us it
is one of the reasons why we require

00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:49.119
is one of the reasons why we require
 

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:51.320
is one of the reasons why we require
standardized tests I mean that's one

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330
standardized tests I mean that's one
 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.909
standardized tests I mean that's one
piece of information it's not all of it

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919
piece of information it's not all of it
 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:57.719
piece of information it's not all of it
but it's one some students right who are

00:06:57.719 --> 00:06:57.729
but it's one some students right who are
 

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:00.649
but it's one some students right who are
not in traditional schooling pathways

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:00.659
not in traditional schooling pathways
 

00:07:00.659 --> 00:07:05.579
not in traditional schooling pathways
will still take classes in less

00:07:05.579 --> 00:07:05.589
will still take classes in less
 

00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:07.019
will still take classes in less
traditional ways so some will take

00:07:07.019 --> 00:07:07.029
traditional ways so some will take
 

00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:09.540
traditional ways so some will take
classes at local colleges for example

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:09.550
classes at local colleges for example
 

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.639
classes at local colleges for example
and be able to demonstrate their ability

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:11.649
and be able to demonstrate their ability
 

00:07:11.649 --> 00:07:14.669
and be able to demonstrate their ability
that way and you know then there are

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:14.679
that way and you know then there are
 

00:07:14.679 --> 00:07:18.029
that way and you know then there are
other various kinds of ways students can

00:07:18.029 --> 00:07:18.039
other various kinds of ways students can
 

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:18.629
other various kinds of ways students can
do it

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639
do it
 

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:20.759
do it
for example the American math

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:20.769
for example the American math
 

00:07:20.769 --> 00:07:24.179
for example the American math
competition offers these competitions

00:07:24.179 --> 00:07:24.189
competition offers these competitions
 

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:26.489
competition offers these competitions
where students who have a high ability

00:07:26.489 --> 00:07:26.499
where students who have a high ability
 

00:07:26.499 --> 00:07:29.279
where students who have a high ability
in math can can do well on these exams

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:29.289
in math can can do well on these exams
 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:31.589
in math can can do well on these exams
and progress towards and through the

00:07:31.589 --> 00:07:31.599
and progress towards and through the
 

00:07:31.599 --> 00:07:34.439
and progress towards and through the
Olympiad program and it's a way for

00:07:34.439 --> 00:07:34.449
Olympiad program and it's a way for
 

00:07:34.449 --> 00:07:35.939
Olympiad program and it's a way for
students to demonstrate again their

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:35.949
students to demonstrate again their
 

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:37.769
students to demonstrate again their
talents at least in math so that's one

00:07:37.769 --> 00:07:37.779
talents at least in math so that's one
 

00:07:37.779 --> 00:07:39.359
talents at least in math so that's one
example in there are other ways like

00:07:39.359 --> 00:07:39.369
example in there are other ways like
 

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:43.319
example in there are other ways like
that so we were open to evaluating all

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:43.329
that so we were open to evaluating all
 

00:07:43.329 --> 00:07:46.739
that so we were open to evaluating all
kinds of evidence that students can

00:07:46.739 --> 00:07:46.749
kinds of evidence that students can
 

00:07:46.749 --> 00:07:50.509
kinds of evidence that students can
present to us to demonstrate their

00:07:50.509 --> 00:07:50.519
present to us to demonstrate their
 

00:07:50.519 --> 00:07:54.119
present to us to demonstrate their
ability to succeed once they come here
