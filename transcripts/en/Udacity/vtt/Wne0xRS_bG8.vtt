00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.150
There are many ways to answer this question, and

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.710
I really just wanted you to try and come up

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.080
with one on your own. One possible explanation would

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.020
be that, although both individuals have the same genetics for

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:15.900
these eight factors. One individual, woman two, suffered more

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.430
spontaneous mutations from her environment, while the other had fewer.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.060
This means she had more repair to do and couldn't

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.610
get it done as efficiently as woman one. Another explanation

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:29.170
could be that woman two had additional genetic

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.330
factors that damaged the repair mechanisms or encouraged

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.470
tumor growth or maybe woman one had genetic

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.750
factors that actually helped protect her. The bottom

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.140
line is these would be differences for other

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.710
unknown genetic factors between the two women. Most

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.760
likely the answer to this question is probably

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.740
a little bit of all of these things.
