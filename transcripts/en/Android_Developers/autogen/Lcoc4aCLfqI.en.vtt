range of Android phones so these tasks

00:33:25.489 --> 00:33:25.499
range of Android phones so these tasks
 

00:33:25.499 --> 00:33:30.339

added a usability component to our study

00:33:30.339 --> 00:33:30.349
 
 

00:33:30.349 --> 00:33:33.919
 
an in this research we validated a real

an in this research we validated a real
 

00:33:33.929 --> 00:33:36.439
an in this research we validated a real
need for vibration feedback we learned

00:33:36.439 --> 00:33:36.449
need for vibration feedback we learned
 

00:33:36.449 --> 00:33:38.389
need for vibration feedback we learned
that vibration provides valuable

00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399
that vibration provides valuable
 

00:33:38.399 --> 00:33:40.699

to hear spoken feedback on their device

00:33:47.239 --> 00:33:47.249
to hear spoken feedback on their device
 

00:33:47.249 --> 00:33:50.209
to hear spoken feedback on their device
we also learned that the more distinct

00:33:50.209 --> 00:33:50.219
we also learned that the more distinct
 

00:33:50.219 --> 00:33:53.160
we also learned that the more distinct
the vibration pattern the more useful

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:53.170
the vibration pattern the more useful
 

00:33:53.170 --> 00:33:55.950
the vibration pattern the more useful
finally we learned that users wanted the

00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960
finally we learned that users wanted the
 

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.470
finally we learned that users wanted the
ability to adjust vibration intensity

00:33:58.470 --> 00:33:58.480
ability to adjust vibration intensity
 

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.630

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:03.570
according to their personal preferences
so in Android P we're giving greater

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:03.580
so in Android P we're giving greater
 

00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.360
so in Android P we're giving greater
control to the user over vibration

00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:06.370
