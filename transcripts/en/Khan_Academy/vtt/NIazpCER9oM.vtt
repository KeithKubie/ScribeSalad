00:00:00.417 --> 00:00:01.590
- [Voiceover] Let's now do a proof

00:00:01.590 --> 00:00:04.248
of the polynomial remainder theorem.

00:00:04.248 --> 00:00:06.257
Just to make the proof
a little bit tangible,

00:00:06.257 --> 00:00:07.731
I'm going to start with the example

00:00:07.731 --> 00:00:09.948
that we saw in the video that introduced

00:00:09.948 --> 00:00:11.516
the polynomial remainder theorem.

00:00:11.516 --> 00:00:13.129
We saw that if you took three x squared

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:15.068
minus four x plus seven and you divided

00:00:15.068 --> 00:00:18.307
by x minus one, you got three x minus one

00:00:18.307 --> 00:00:20.153
with the remainder of six.

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:21.732
When we do polynomial long division,

00:00:21.732 --> 00:00:23.530
how do we know when we've
got to our remainder?

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:25.183
Well when we get to an expression that has

00:00:25.183 --> 00:00:28.689
a lower degree than the
thing that is the divisor,

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.322
the thing that we're dividing
into the other thing.

00:00:32.322 --> 00:00:34.862
So in this example we
could have re-written

00:00:34.862 --> 00:00:39.302
what we just did right
over here as our f of x.

00:00:39.302 --> 00:00:40.719
Let me just write it right over here.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:44.498
So we could have said three x squared

00:00:44.498 --> 00:00:48.480
minus four x plus seven is equal to

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.359
x minus one times the
quotient right over here,

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:53.797
or I could say the
quotient times x minus one.

00:00:53.797 --> 00:00:57.384
So it's going to be
equal to this business.

00:00:57.384 --> 00:01:01.877
It's going to be equal
to three x minus one

00:01:01.877 --> 00:01:06.138
times the divisor, times x minus one.

00:01:10.497 --> 00:01:11.566
When you multiply these two things,

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.611
you're not going to get exactly this.

00:01:12.611 --> 00:01:14.665
You still have to add the remainder.

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:18.391
So plus the remainder.

00:01:18.694 --> 00:01:20.535
Actually, let me write
the actual remainder down.

00:01:20.535 --> 00:01:22.309
So plus six.

00:01:22.346 --> 00:01:24.587
The analogy here is exactly the analogy

00:01:24.587 --> 00:01:26.444
to when you did traditional division.

00:01:26.444 --> 00:01:29.370
If I were to say, actually, let me just

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.924
show you the analogy.

00:01:31.088 --> 00:01:36.088
If I were to say 25 divided by four,

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:42.627
you would say, okay,
well four goes into 25

00:01:42.627 --> 00:01:46.121
six times, six times four is 24.

00:01:46.284 --> 00:01:48.397
You would subtract, and then you would get

00:01:48.397 --> 00:01:51.065
a remainder, one.

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.505
Or another way of saying
this is you could say

00:01:53.505 --> 00:01:58.505
that 25 is equal to six
times four plus one.

00:02:12.161 --> 00:02:13.948
So we just did the exact same thing here,

00:02:13.948 --> 00:02:16.338
but we just did it with expressions.

00:02:16.664 --> 00:02:18.801
So once again, I haven't
started the proof yet,

00:02:18.801 --> 00:02:20.125
I just wanted to make you feel comfortable

00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:22.168
with what I just wrote right over here.

00:02:22.168 --> 00:02:26.242
If I divided this expression
into this polynomial,

00:02:26.242 --> 00:02:27.705
and I were to get this quotient,

00:02:27.705 --> 00:02:29.564
that's the same thing as
saying this polynomial

00:02:29.564 --> 00:02:32.186
could be equal to three x minus one

00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:35.156
times x minus one plus six.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.201
Now this is true in general.

00:02:37.201 --> 00:02:38.442
Let's abstract a little bit.

00:02:38.618 --> 00:02:41.077
This is our f of x.

00:02:41.276 --> 00:02:43.120
So that is f of x.

00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:47.104
So f of x is going to be equal to

00:02:47.104 --> 00:02:48.578
whatever the quotient is.

00:02:48.578 --> 00:02:50.360
Let me call that q of x.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.922
So do this in a different color.

00:02:53.722 --> 00:02:58.333
So I'm going to call that q of x.

00:02:59.855 --> 00:03:02.021
This right over here is q of x.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.437
So f of x is going to be
equal to the quotient,

00:03:04.437 --> 00:03:08.036
q of x, times, this is our x minus a,

00:03:08.036 --> 00:03:09.499
in this case a is one, but I'm just trying

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:11.601
to generalize it a little bit.

00:03:11.601 --> 00:03:16.098
So x minus a, and then plus the remainder.

00:03:18.252 --> 00:03:19.532
We know that the remainder is going

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:21.746
to be a constant because the remainder

00:03:21.746 --> 00:03:26.024
is going to have a lower
degree then x minus a.

00:03:26.024 --> 00:03:28.288
X minus a is a first degree.

00:03:28.288 --> 00:03:30.006
So in order to have a lower degree,

00:03:30.006 --> 00:03:31.307
this has to be zeroth degree.

00:03:31.307 --> 00:03:33.280
This has to be a constant.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.160
So this is true in general.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.145
This is true for any polynomial

00:03:37.145 --> 00:03:42.145
f of x divided by any x minus a.

00:03:42.486 --> 00:03:43.992
So this is just true.

00:03:44.586 --> 00:03:49.586
So this is true for any
f of x and x minus a.

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.070
Now what is going to happen
if we evaluate f of a?

00:04:04.032 --> 00:04:07.805
Well if f of x can be written like this,

00:04:07.805 --> 00:04:10.347
well we could write f of,

00:04:10.347 --> 00:04:14.027
let me do a in a new
color so it sticks out.

00:04:14.027 --> 00:04:19.027
We could write f of a would be equal to

00:04:22.444 --> 00:04:27.444
q of a times, I think you might see

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.660
where this is going,
times a minus a plus r.

00:04:43.217 --> 00:04:45.110
Well what's that going to be equal to?

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.071
What's all this business
going to be equal to?

00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:51.019
Well a minus a is zero, and q of a,

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:52.296
I don't care what q of a is,

00:04:52.296 --> 00:04:53.829
if you're going to multiply it by zero

00:04:53.829 --> 00:04:56.233
all of this is going to be zero.

00:04:56.233 --> 00:05:01.233
So f of a is going to be equal to r.

00:05:06.634 --> 00:05:07.829
And so you're done.

00:05:07.829 --> 00:05:09.339
This is the proof of the

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:11.196
polynomial remainder theorem.

00:05:11.196 --> 00:05:15.515
Any function, if when you
divide it by x minus a

00:05:15.515 --> 00:05:18.580
you get the quotient q
of x and the remainder r,

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.390
it can then be written in this way.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:22.701
If it's written in this
way and you evaluated

00:05:22.701 --> 00:05:25.405
at f of a and you put the a over here,

00:05:25.405 --> 00:05:26.926
you're going to see that
f of a is going to be

00:05:26.926 --> 00:05:29.862
whatever that remainder was.

00:05:29.862 --> 00:05:33.625
That is the polynomial remainder theorem.

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:34.646
And we're done.

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:36.998
One of the simpler proofs that exists

00:05:36.998 --> 00:05:40.735
for something that at first
seems somewhat magical.
