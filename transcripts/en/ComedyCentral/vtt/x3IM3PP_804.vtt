We now turn
to the subject of war,

00:00:04.004 --> 00:00:07.841
specifically the Hashtag War.
Now...

00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:11.178
tonight...

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:13.981
we're wondering what it would be
like if Senator Sanders' finger

00:00:14.014 --> 00:00:15.983
was on the button, especially
one that does something

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:17.451
other than alert
his flight attendant.

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:20.120
Uh, what would Mr. Trump do
as head of state,

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:22.055
besides negging Angela Merkel?

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:24.725
Well, gentlemen, now is your
opportunity to go head-to-head,

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:27.728
mano a mano. Tell the voters
what the world would look like--

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:30.230
this is your final chance
to get their approval--

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:32.766
if you were sitting in the Oval
Office, with tonight's hashtag,

00:00:32.799 --> 00:00:35.502
#IfIWerePresident.
#IfIWerePresident.

00:00:35.536 --> 00:00:38.238
Uh, examples might be
"our national parks would become

00:00:38.272 --> 00:00:40.240
national golf courses" or, um,

00:00:40.274 --> 00:00:41.775
"the White House
would get a chairlift."

00:00:41.808 --> 00:00:43.510
Either one, either way.

00:00:43.544 --> 00:00:45.913
Um, we're gonna go back
and forth on this one.

00:00:45.946 --> 00:00:47.581
Let's start with you,
Senator Sanders.

00:00:47.614 --> 00:00:50.384
Okay. If I were president,

00:00:50.417 --> 00:00:54.021
"Hail to the Chief" would be
played by the band Phish,

00:00:54.054 --> 00:00:57.491
and it would take 25 minutes
every time I walk into a room.

00:00:57.524 --> 00:00:58.992
All right, points.

00:00:59.026 --> 00:01:00.727
Mr. Trump.

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.730
If I were president,
we would have

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:06.667
the first lady-daughter
of the United States.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.203
I'm disgusted. Points.
Senator Sanders.

00:01:09.236 --> 00:01:10.737
If I were president,

00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:13.607
I would put
the rich Wall Street bankers

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.743
in the same prison
that Magneto goes in,

00:01:16.777 --> 00:01:18.912
but they would not be let out
for any sequels.

00:01:18.946 --> 00:01:21.114
All right.
Points to Senator Sanders.

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:22.716
Mr. Trump.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.252
If I become president,

00:01:25.285 --> 00:01:29.923
I am gonna hunt down Rosie
O'Donnell like Osama bin Laden.

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:31.525
Points.

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:33.594
Senator Sanders.

00:01:33.627 --> 00:01:35.462
If I were president,

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:39.333
I would institute
a national Netflix account

00:01:39.366 --> 00:01:41.134
with one password

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:44.605
so we are no longer burdening
our seniors

00:01:44.638 --> 00:01:47.307
for their Netflix passwords.

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:52.412
Points to Senator Sanders.

00:01:52.446 --> 00:01:54.815
You're applauding that,
but do you know what that...

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:56.817
you'd end up watching
if everyone were

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.019
-on the same account?
-They don't even understand.

00:01:59.052 --> 00:02:02.489
They don't even understand.
It would be <i>Bones</i> all day long.
