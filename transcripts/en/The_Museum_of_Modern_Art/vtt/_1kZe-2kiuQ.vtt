00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:02.719
Welcome back to Fashion as Design.

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.210
This week we're gonna talk about the lifecycle of garments.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.809
We're gonna talk about how they are born,
starting with the prime materials that are

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:13.190
used to make them.

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.840
And we're gonna talk about how they die, and
sometimes are reborn.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.820
How they get recycled, reused, re-adapted.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.439
So we're gonna really think of a whole cradle
to cradle.

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.319
You probably know this term that was coined
about 15 years ago.

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:33.480
A cradle to cradle idea about garments.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.660
We're gonna look first at two of the most
poignant garments to talk about this subject.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.860
One is the white T-shirt, and the other is
jeans.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:49.380
Following that we're gonna talk about garments
that come back alive, that are anew every

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.370
single time they get passed on to new wearers.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.960
And last but not least, we're gonna talk about
forever.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.700
About some particular garments and accessories
that are so well made that they last for a

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.700
long time.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.610
Sometimes, they get passed on from a generation
to the other.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.320
Of course, they demand a bigger investment
at the beginning but the lifecycle is extended

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.450
for decades.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.650
So, there are many different objects, as we
said, in this particular week.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:25.330
But I think we need to talk a little bit about
jeans, because I feel that so much current

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.130
experimentation, and also so much work on the side of the companies that

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.730
make jeans, is going into them.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.800
And one of the things I love looking at is
the [University College London] project on

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.400
the global denim.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.770
And two anthropologists, the two professors,
have looked at the ways in which denim has

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.680
proliferated so very much across the globe
in the last century or so.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.870
And how it means very many different to different
people, and yet has these really universal

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:54.740
and standard meanings also to many.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.120
And so, they use it almost like a litmus test
or a barometer of modernity across the globe

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.110
in different cultural scenarios and different
geographic regions.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.420
And it's been really fascinating to think
about jeans.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.860
Therefore,  it's one of these key

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.690
discussion points in the course, and also
in our exhibition.

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.500
And that's from the anthropological standpoint.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.380
But then, there is this sustainability and
technological standpoint.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:25.130
So jeans are a crucial example of comfort,
of universality, of personality.

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.140
And also of waste.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.690
And the good news is that companies are taking this very seriously.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.890
They're looking for ways to use less water.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.840
They're looking for ways to recycle.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.440
Some is experimental, some is already advanced.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.730
But the technology that goes into making the
industry more sustainable is mind boggling.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.001
One final note on jeans, when we think of
the history of jeans, they were

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:50.300
designed for durability.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:51.300
Right?

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.260
So when we say jeans, denim had been around
for centuries.

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.560
But when we say jeans, a pair of jeans, this
was really something that was born in the

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.880
19th century when rivets were applied to different
stress points of jeans, including the crotch

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.990
and the pockets.

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.360
So right off the bat, jeans were designed
to last forever.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:14.840
But also there are some unintentional long
lasting garments that are testimonials for

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.580
our "Anew" section like the plannel.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.750
The plaid flannel shirt, one of the...

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.930
I said the plannel.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.920
Let's call it a plannel.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.340
Like the plannel shirt, yeah.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.710
So when we think of the plaid flannel shirt,
I think most of us right off the bat have

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.890
images of, you know, hip cool sub-cultures,
grunge in particular.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:40.540
But really, the plaid flannel shirt is a lens
to look at how we up-cycle clothing.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:46.610
So it's interesting because we've been looking
at ways to make garments more sensibly.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.740
We've looked at ways to make them last longer,
to repair them.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.060
Now there's this kind of new life that they
can have.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.070
And then there's the idea of garments that
last for a long time.

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:02.290
And, for instance, the menstruation garments
that we see today.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.900
There are so many startup companies that are
working on something that is an old concept

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.370
brought back to life.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.110
Unlike other menstruation products that are
designed to be used and then discarded and

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.650
have an impact on the environment.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.870
Startup companies are thinking about the ways
in which might we use underpants that can

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.259
be re-washed and reused.

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.059
It's actually a fairly old idea.

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:27.809
And that's the interesting thing that is happening
in all forms of design these days.

00:04:27.809 --> 00:04:30.319
We tend to have so much to learn.

00:04:30.319 --> 00:04:32.419
We always did but now we recognize it.

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:38.960
We have so much to learn from ancient cultures,
from material culture, from parts all over

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:40.330
the world.

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.139
And interestingly, today we're gonna talk
about another topic that is as old as the

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:47.599
world, which is the topic of death.

00:04:47.599 --> 00:04:53.370
The week is gonna be closed by the ultimate
little black dress, which is by Pia Interlandi,

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.900
a designer in Melbourne, Australia, that works
with people that are terminally ill and decides

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.039
with them what they want to wear when they
die.

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.990
And they're gonna talk about biodegradability,
green burial.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.599
But they also will talk about what they want
to leave behind.

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:14.270
Do you think that's the difference then, Paola,
actually, if we are talking about Bernard

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.930
Rudofsky was thinking about with "Are Clothes
Modern?"

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.510
That was right at the moment when there was
a post-war boom of consumption.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:27.780
And design history at that point in time is
so often talking about how we might use design,

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.259
consume design and bring it into our lives.

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:36.449
This particular conversation about life-cycle
we have in the contemporary moment, a general

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.240
atmosphere or general hope that we consume
less.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:44.839
There's a sort of coming realization that
we have finite resources and so we're thinking

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:48.370
more about how we can consume less.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:53.029
The devil's advocate position in this conversation,
is that, of course, fashion is a huge business.

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:56.210
It employs so many people globally.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.619
And many of them are actually women who are
using the money that they earn from working

00:06:01.619 --> 00:06:06.189
in the garments sector to empower themselves,
empower their families, and really, can radically

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:07.189
change their lives.

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:10.969
It's really a matter of awareness.

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:13.789
And also it's a matter of peer pressure.

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:21.439
And it's a matter of just creating a culture
that normalizes more ethical behaviors.

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:28.509
So I feel that slowly but surely, if everybody
understands that one pair of jeans versus

00:06:28.509 --> 00:06:36.009
another is a choice that has impact, then
we will, as we say, vote with our wallets.

00:06:36.009 --> 00:06:42.040
And make the world more sensible by letting
companies know what we accept and what we

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:43.560
don't.
