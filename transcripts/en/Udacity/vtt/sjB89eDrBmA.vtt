00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.920
Monogenic traits are traits that are significantly influenced by a

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.850
single gene. Monogenic meaning one gene. Now these are also

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.720
referred to as simple genetic traits and they're frequently found

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.310
in many introductory genetics textbooks. And that's because they are pretty

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.105
straightforward and easy to understand. We change one gene and

00:00:17.105 --> 00:00:19.840
we get a change in a trait. Now what I'd

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.150
like for you to do is now that we've been

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:25.330
through about seven lessons in the course. See if you can

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.390
name one monogenic trait that we've covered so far,

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.290
or maybe one that you've heard of elsewhere. But even

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.400
if you're not sure, go ahead and try to think

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.190
of one and put it in the text box here.
