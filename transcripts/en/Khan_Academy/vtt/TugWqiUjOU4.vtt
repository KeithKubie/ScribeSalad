00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.500
The diagram below contains
parallelogram ABCD,

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.490
so that's parallelogram
ABCD, and triangle EFG.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.140
And they tell us
which of the angles

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.348
have a measure of 90 degrees,
and they label it here,

00:00:12.348 --> 00:00:13.070
as well.

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.200
And they tell us
which of the angles

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.520
have a measure of 31 degrees,
and they label it here,

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:17.690
as well.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.120
Which of the equalities
must be true?

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.830
I encourage you to
now pause this video

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.200
and try to figure
this out on your own.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.950
So now let's look at
this first statement,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.190
tangent of angle ADC.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:33.640
So let's think about the
tangent of angle ADC.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.170
So this is angle ADC
right here-- ADC.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.120
To remind ourselves the
definition of tangent,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.460
we'll break out sohcahtoa.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.830
Sine is opposite
over hypotenuse,

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.770
cosine-- soh cah-- cosine
is adjacent over hypotenuse,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.490
toa-- tangent is
opposite over adjacent.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.920
So what is the opposite
side to this angle?

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.700
So we're dealing with this
right triangle, triangle ADC.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.390
Let me highlight
it so that we know

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.970
we're dealing with this right
triangle right over here.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.840
That's the only right triangle
that angle ADC is part of.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.510
And so what side is
opposite angle ADC?

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.750
Well, it's side CA, or I
guess I say AC, side AC.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.590
So that is opposite.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.280
And what side is adjacent?

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.516
Well, this side, CD.

00:01:30.516 --> 00:01:34.040
CD, or I guess I could call it
DC, whatever I want to call it.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.460
DC, or CD, is adjacent.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.880
Now how did I know that
this side is adjacent

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.382
and not side DA?

00:01:41.382 --> 00:01:43.400
Because DA is the hypotenuse.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.640
They both, together, make up
the two sides of this angle.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.830
But the adjacent side
is one of the sides

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.730
of the angle that is
not the hypotenuse.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.130
AD or DA in the
sohcahtoa context

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.870
we would consider to
be the hypotenuse.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.040
For this angle, this is
opposite, this is adjacent,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.200
this is hypotenuse.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.530
Tangent of this angle is
opposite over adjacent-- AC

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:05.385
over DC.

00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:06.760
Now is that what
they wrote here?

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.260
No.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.470
They wrote AC over EF.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.199
Well, where's EF?

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:12.990
EF is nowhere to be seen
either in this triangle,

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.460
or even in this figure.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.830
EF is this thing
right over here.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.170
EF is this business
right over here.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.149
That's EF.

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:22.773
It's in a completely
different triangle

00:02:22.773 --> 00:02:24.148
in a completely
different figure.

00:02:24.148 --> 00:02:26.240
We don't even know what
scale this is drawn at.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.030
There's no way the
tangent of this angle

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.801
is related to this somewhat
arbitrary number that's

00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:31.300
over here.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.341
They haven't labelled it.

00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:35.650
This thing might be a million
miles long for all we know.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.470
This thing really
could be any number.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.040
So this isn't the case.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.740
We would have to relate it to
something within this triangle,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.360
or something that's
the same length.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.990
So if somehow we
could prove that EF

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.249
is the same length as DC,
then we could go with that.

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:53.040
But there's no way.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.581
This is a completely different
figure, a completely different

00:02:55.581 --> 00:02:56.470
diagram.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.170
This is a similar
triangle to this,

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.700
but we don't know anything
about the lengths.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.200
A similar triangle just lets
us know that the angles are all

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.790
the same, or that the ratio
between corresponding sides

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.280
might be the same,
but it doesn't

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.760
tell us what this number right
over here, doesn't tell us

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.050
that this side is
somehow congruent to DC.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.190
So we can't go with this one.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.000
Now let's think about
the sine of CBA.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.500
So the sine-- let me do
this in a different color.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.980
So the sine of angle CBA.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.160
So that's this angle
right over here, CBA.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.670
Well, sine is opposite
over hypotenuse.

00:03:36.914 --> 00:03:38.330
I guess let me
make it clear which

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.970
triangle we're looking at.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.100
I'll do this in yellow.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.300
We're now looking at this
triangle right over here.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.190
The opposite side is AC.

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.480
That's what the
angle opens up into.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.230
So it's going to be equal to AC.

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.140
And what is the hypotenuse?

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:00.150
What is the hypotenuse here?

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.060
Well, the hypotenuse--
so let me see,

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.826
it's opposite over hypotenuse--
the hypotenuse is BC.

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:12.160
It's the side opposite
the 90 degree side.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.770
So this, it's BC.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:24.490
Sine is opposite over
hypotenuse, so over BC.

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.970
Is that what they
wrote over here?

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:26.470
No.

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.100
They have DC over BC.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.380
Now what is DC equal to?

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.100
Well, DC is this.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.180
And DC is not-- there's no
evidence on this drawing

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.880
right over here that DC is
somehow equivalent to AC.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.820
So given this information
right over here,

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.970
we can't make this
statement, either.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.240
So neither of these are true.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.520
So let's make sure
we got this right.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.410
We can go back to
our actual exercise,

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:58.040
and we get-- oh, that's
not the actual exercise.

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.050
Let me minimize that.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.990
This is neither
of these are true.

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:06.990
And we got it right.
