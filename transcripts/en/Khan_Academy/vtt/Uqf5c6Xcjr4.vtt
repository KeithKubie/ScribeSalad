00:00:00.346 --> 00:00:01.580
- [Instructor] In other videos

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.223
we have already looked at
production possibility curves

00:00:05.223 --> 00:00:08.071
and output tables in order to calculate

00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:11.974
opportunity costs of
producing a certain product

00:00:11.974 --> 00:00:13.641
in a certain country.

00:00:13.641 --> 00:00:16.854
And then we used that to think
about comparative advantage.

00:00:16.854 --> 00:00:19.664
We're going to do something
very similar in this video,

00:00:19.664 --> 00:00:20.989
but instead of thinking about,

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:22.848
or instead of starting with output,

00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:24.905
we're gonna start with input.

00:00:24.905 --> 00:00:26.824
So right over here we have a table

00:00:26.824 --> 00:00:30.763
that shows us the worker
hours per item per country.

00:00:30.763 --> 00:00:32.776
So, instead of this being an output table

00:00:32.776 --> 00:00:34.432
where we say in a given country,

00:00:34.432 --> 00:00:37.885
how much of, say, toy cars can a worker

00:00:37.885 --> 00:00:40.195
in country A produce per day?

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:43.589
Here we're saying, how
many hours does a worker

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:47.597
in country A take to produce A toy car?

00:00:47.597 --> 00:00:49.703
In country A it is two hours.

00:00:49.703 --> 00:00:53.373
That labor, that two hours
of labor, this is the input.

00:00:53.373 --> 00:00:56.208
So we're not counting the
number of cars per day here.

00:00:56.208 --> 00:00:59.606
We're saying how many hours per car, A,

00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:01.657
we need to put in to produce it.

00:01:01.657 --> 00:01:04.748
Similarly, we have the
input required in country A

00:01:04.748 --> 00:01:05.947
to produce a belt.

00:01:05.947 --> 00:01:07.941
One hour of worker time.

00:01:07.941 --> 00:01:10.372
In country B, four hours of worker time

00:01:10.372 --> 00:01:11.727
produces a toy car.

00:01:11.727 --> 00:01:14.025
And in country B, three
hours of worker time

00:01:14.025 --> 00:01:15.497
produces a belt.

00:01:15.497 --> 00:01:18.054
So what we're gonna do
next is convert this

00:01:18.054 --> 00:01:20.530
into the world that you
might be more familiar with,

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:22.302
of thinking in an output world.

00:01:22.302 --> 00:01:25.067
And to do that, we'll
just assume that there are

00:01:25.067 --> 00:01:26.650
eight working hours

00:01:29.645 --> 00:01:30.478
per day

00:01:33.551 --> 00:01:34.845
in either country.

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:38.393
And so from this, can we
construct an output table?

00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:41.707
Let me put this right over here.

00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:43.381
Output table,

00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:44.495
where once again we're gonna think

00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:46.891
about the output in country A.

00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:50.082
We're gonna think about
the output in country B.

00:01:50.082 --> 00:01:51.389
And this is going to be in

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:54.448
how many units of that
product can a worker produce

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:56.757
per day in each of those countries?

00:01:56.757 --> 00:02:00.836
So once again, we're gonna
have toy cars in this row,

00:02:00.836 --> 00:02:03.958
and we're going to have belts

00:02:03.958 --> 00:02:05.008
in this row.

00:02:05.008 --> 00:02:07.164
And let me just draw
some lines so it's clear

00:02:07.164 --> 00:02:09.920
that we're dealing with a table here.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.170
So there we go.

00:02:12.514 --> 00:02:14.849
Then one more column.

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.010
And so, see if you can fill these in.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.998
So how many toy cars per worker per day

00:02:20.998 --> 00:02:22.652
can we produce in country A?

00:02:22.652 --> 00:02:24.086
Then think about it for belts.

00:02:24.086 --> 00:02:26.249
Then think about both
of them for country B.

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.773
Pause the video and
try to figure that out.

00:02:28.773 --> 00:02:31.238
Alright, now let's think about how many

00:02:31.238 --> 00:02:33.834
toy cars per worker per day.

00:02:33.834 --> 00:02:34.992
Let me make it very clear.

00:02:34.992 --> 00:02:37.075
We're thinking per worker

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.242
per day here.

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.819
Because if we can fill out
this output table from this,

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.560
I guess you could call
this an input table,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.929
then we can think about opportunity cost

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:49.127
in the traditional way.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:51.171
And then we could think
about in which country

00:02:51.171 --> 00:02:53.453
do we have a comparative advantage?

00:02:53.453 --> 00:02:54.733
So, let's see.

00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:56.590
Toy cars in country A.

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.598
If it takes two hours
to produce one toy car

00:03:00.598 --> 00:03:02.099
in country A,

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.299
and if you're working, if
the average, or if the worker

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.486
is working eight hours per day,

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:10.081
well then, a worker can produce four cars.

00:03:10.081 --> 00:03:13.301
Four cars times two hours is eight hours.

00:03:13.301 --> 00:03:16.797
So, an average worker per day in country A

00:03:16.797 --> 00:03:18.964
can produce four toy cars.

00:03:19.928 --> 00:03:21.759
Let me write than in that red color.

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:23.100
Four toy cars.

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.674
I just took eight hours and I divided

00:03:24.674 --> 00:03:27.617
by the number of hours it
takes to produce a toy car.

00:03:27.617 --> 00:03:29.414
Similarly for belts, if I have eight hours

00:03:29.414 --> 00:03:32.124
and it takes an hour for
a worker to make one belt,

00:03:32.124 --> 00:03:35.117
then per worker per day,
eight divided by one,

00:03:35.117 --> 00:03:37.552
I could produce eight belts.

00:03:37.552 --> 00:03:39.574
And we could do the same
thing for country B,

00:03:39.574 --> 00:03:40.576
and I encourage you to pause the video

00:03:40.576 --> 00:03:41.623
if you haven't done so already

00:03:41.623 --> 00:03:43.933
and try to fill this column out.

00:03:43.933 --> 00:03:46.478
Well, in country B, if it takes four hours

00:03:46.478 --> 00:03:49.287
to produce a toy car per worker,

00:03:49.287 --> 00:03:51.813
that means you take eight
hours divided by four hours

00:03:51.813 --> 00:03:55.919
that you could produce two
toy cars in a day per worker.

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.977
If it takes three hours to produce a belt,

00:03:58.977 --> 00:04:01.045
well then you take your eight hours,

00:04:01.045 --> 00:04:03.426
divide it by three hours per belt,

00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:06.662
and you're gonna be able to make 8/3 belts

00:04:06.662 --> 00:04:08.054
per worker per day.

00:04:08.054 --> 00:04:11.471
This is the same thing as 2 2/3 belts

00:04:11.471 --> 00:04:13.061
per worker per day.

00:04:13.061 --> 00:04:15.333
So as you can see, we can easily translate

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:18.801
between the input world
and the output world.

00:04:18.801 --> 00:04:21.961
And then we could use this to
calculate opportunity cost.

00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:22.907
So let's do that.

00:04:22.907 --> 00:04:25.407
Let me write opportunity cost.

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:31.993
And I'll make another table here.

00:04:31.993 --> 00:04:33.076
So country A,

00:04:34.946 --> 00:04:35.779
country B,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.767
and then I have the toy cars,

00:04:42.655 --> 00:04:45.295
and then I have the belts.

00:04:45.295 --> 00:04:48.156
Let me do the belts in that orange color.

00:04:48.156 --> 00:04:49.573
I have the belts,

00:04:50.435 --> 00:04:53.102
and then let me set up my table.

00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:56.085
We're almost there.

00:04:56.085 --> 00:04:57.521
At any point in time,

00:04:57.521 --> 00:05:00.061
pause this video and see if you can figure

00:05:00.061 --> 00:05:02.128
out the opportunity cost
given the information

00:05:02.128 --> 00:05:03.479
that we already have.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:05.622
We took this table to
figure out this table,

00:05:05.622 --> 00:05:07.372
and now we could take

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:12.046
this table to figure out this one.

00:05:12.046 --> 00:05:13.870
Well, let's do this together now.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:15.686
So, toy cars.

00:05:15.686 --> 00:05:18.217
What's the opportunity cost in country A?

00:05:18.217 --> 00:05:20.736
Well, one way to think
about it is in country A,

00:05:20.736 --> 00:05:23.319
the same energy to produce four

00:05:24.648 --> 00:05:28.448
toy cars, I'll call it four c, c for cars.

00:05:28.448 --> 00:05:32.637
We could also use that
to produce eight belts.

00:05:32.637 --> 00:05:36.368
So, if I were to divide
both sides by four,

00:05:36.368 --> 00:05:38.750
the energy to create one car is equal

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.473
to the energy to create two belts.

00:05:41.473 --> 00:05:43.822
So my opportunity cost of a car

00:05:43.822 --> 00:05:45.423
is two belts.

00:05:45.423 --> 00:05:47.690
And if I start with this original equation

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:50.093
and just divide both sides by eight,

00:05:50.093 --> 00:05:52.919
I would solve for the energy for a belt.

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:54.925
And so that would be four over eight

00:05:54.925 --> 00:05:59.394
is 1/2 of the energy to make a car

00:05:59.394 --> 00:06:02.245
is equal to the energy to make a belt.

00:06:02.245 --> 00:06:05.813
And so the opportunity cost
of a belt is 1/2 a car.

00:06:05.813 --> 00:06:07.541
1/2 a car.

00:06:07.541 --> 00:06:08.374
And like always,

00:06:08.374 --> 00:06:10.543
this and this are
reciprocals of each other.

00:06:10.543 --> 00:06:13.735
And we could do this same
exercise for country B.

00:06:13.735 --> 00:06:14.900
And once again, I keep emphasizing,

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:15.733
try to pause the video.

00:06:15.733 --> 00:06:16.846
If you do this on your own as opposed

00:06:16.846 --> 00:06:18.209
to just watching me do it,

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:21.097
it'll stick a lot better in your brain.

00:06:21.097 --> 00:06:23.730
Alright, in country B, the same energy

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.980
to make two cars, toy cars,

00:06:26.907 --> 00:06:31.074
with that same energy
I could make 8/3 belts.

00:06:32.687 --> 00:06:35.108
8/3 belts right over here.

00:06:35.108 --> 00:06:37.420
So the energy to make a car,

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.268
divide both sides by two,

00:06:39.268 --> 00:06:43.435
is equal to, instead of one
car I can make 4/3 of a belt.

00:06:45.042 --> 00:06:49.209
And so I'll just write
this as 1 1/3 of a belt.

00:06:50.156 --> 00:06:51.766
And then if I start right over here

00:06:51.766 --> 00:06:54.069
and I multiply both sides by 3/8,

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:55.114
actually, let me do that over here.

00:06:55.114 --> 00:06:57.819
So I have 3/8 times two c

00:06:57.819 --> 00:07:02.620
is equal to 8/3 b times 3/8.

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:04.113
These cancel out.

00:07:04.113 --> 00:07:07.497
And over here I'm gonna have 6/8 c.

00:07:07.497 --> 00:07:11.947
6/8 c is the same thing
as 3/4 c is equal to b.

00:07:11.947 --> 00:07:13.807
So, instead of making one belt,

00:07:13.807 --> 00:07:18.626
I could take that same energy
and make 3/4 of a toy car.

00:07:18.626 --> 00:07:20.959
3/4 of a toy car.

00:07:21.873 --> 00:07:24.752
So given everything that we've just done,

00:07:24.752 --> 00:07:26.801
which country has the
comparative advantage

00:07:26.801 --> 00:07:27.801
in toy cars?

00:07:30.022 --> 00:07:31.343
Well, to figure that out,

00:07:31.343 --> 00:07:33.857
we just look at the
opportunity cost for toy cars

00:07:33.857 --> 00:07:35.511
and we compare them.

00:07:35.511 --> 00:07:39.998
In country A, the
opportunity cost is two belts

00:07:39.998 --> 00:07:42.445
while in country B it's only 1 1/3 belts.

00:07:42.445 --> 00:07:46.434
So country B has the comparative
advantage right over here.

00:07:46.434 --> 00:07:49.267
Comparative advantage in toy cars.

00:07:50.133 --> 00:07:51.371
And then in belts,

00:07:51.371 --> 00:07:56.202
1/2 of a car is less than 3/4 of a car.

00:07:56.202 --> 00:07:59.753
In belts, we see that country A has

00:07:59.753 --> 00:08:01.358
the comparative advantage.

00:08:01.358 --> 00:08:02.916
And now what's always interesting

00:08:02.916 --> 00:08:05.794
about thinking about this is notice,

00:08:05.794 --> 00:08:09.044
country B has the comparative advantage

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:11.388
in toy cars.

00:08:11.388 --> 00:08:14.034
It has less of an
opportunity cost in toy cars.

00:08:14.034 --> 00:08:17.474
Even though country A has
the absolute advantage,

00:08:17.474 --> 00:08:20.258
its workers are more efficient
at producing toy cars.

00:08:20.258 --> 00:08:22.318
A worker can produce
four cars in country A

00:08:22.318 --> 00:08:23.854
versus two in country B.

00:08:23.854 --> 00:08:26.637
But despite that, because
of the opportunity cost,

00:08:26.637 --> 00:08:28.498
it would actually make sense for country B

00:08:28.498 --> 00:08:31.190
to focus on cars and for country A

00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:33.043
to focus on the belts.

00:08:33.043 --> 00:08:34.674
But the big picture here is

00:08:34.674 --> 00:08:36.323
we're thinking about
comparative advantage.

00:08:36.323 --> 00:08:39.440
And instead of thinking
about with an output lens

00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.786
from the beginning, we
started with an input lens,

00:08:41.786 --> 00:08:43.485
converted that to an output lens,
