00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.410
If you’ve played the Oregon Trail then you
know cholera is a harrowing illness that killed

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.859
many a’pioneer.

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:13.959
But what exactly IS cholera and why are people
still getting it?

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.160
Hey there bankers from Boston and Carpenters
from Ohio, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.140
While many of us only know it from the game
Oregon Trail, cholera is a real infection

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.230
with real consequences.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.130
In 2010, Haiti was hit with a massive earthquake.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.839
UN workers arrived to help but possibly also
brought cholera along with them.

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.460
Haiti had not had a cholera outbreak in more
that 50 years.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:40.532
But the 2010 outbreak left about 790,000 people
sick and over 9,000 dead... we wanted to know

00:00:40.532 --> 00:00:43.770
what exactly is this disease, and what does
it do?

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.110
Cholera is a bacterial infection caused by
Vibrio cholerae.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.699
Only about 1 in 10 people infected develop
symptoms, but those that do must get treatment

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.840
quickly and may experience excessive watery
diarrhea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.640
Cholera can kill a healthy individual within
hours if they are not treated properly.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:05.300
According to Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School
of Public Health, the incubation period for

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.540
the disease is about 12 hours to 4-and-a-half
days.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.360
Cholera affects the digestive tract by releasing
choleragen, or cholera toxin, a protein that

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.260
attacks the gut, causing that watery diarrhea.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.730
Because those afflicted are losing so much
fluid, it leave them severely dehydrated!

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.920
This can cause hypovolemic shock -- or an
extreme loss of the body’s fluid.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.780
This loss of fluid literally makes the blood
thicken which causes problems with circulation

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.760
and keeps it from reaching organs.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.600
This also happens during regular old dehydration,
and can lead to death if a patient isn’t

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.250
hydrated immediately!

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.560
Because the loss of fluid is the major symptom,
the primary treatment is fast and plentiful

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.700
rehydration.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.980
In areas of the world where cholera outbreaks
are common, doctors keep rehydration packets,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.280
IV fluids, and salts on hand.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.180
I know you're probably thinking salt makes
you thirsty, but it's also an important part

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.480
of life, without salt our body can't move
fluids around easily -- so these packets contain

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.830
sodium for water movement, and glucose which
was discovered to accelerate fluid movement

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.550
by research published in the Lancet in 1978
-- they called it the "most important medical

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.280
advance of the century."

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:14.000
There are also antibiotics for cholera; however
rapid rehydration is the most important step

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.190
in saving lives.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.190
Today we know that cholera is often transmitted
through faecally contaminated water and food,

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.420
but back in the early 19th century, physicians
thought it was caused by bad odors, or miasmas,

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.983
rising up from the sewers and open graves.

00:02:26.983 --> 00:02:32.400
Then in the early 1850s, a British physician
by the name of John Snow (no, not THAT John

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.420
Snow, this guy actually knows something…)
Snow theorized that something else was responsible,

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.350
because the main symptoms were in the digestive
tract, not in the lungs.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.800
Instead of breathing in the source of cholera,
Snow believed patients ingested it.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.380
During an outbreak in Soho London in 1854,
Snow mapped the cases of cholera and found

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.740
that there was an epicenter to the outbreak.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.790
The Broad Street water pump was surrounded
by the highest incidences of the disease,

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.520
which led Snow to believe it was contaminated
water that was the culprit..

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:04.630
He published his findings in a book in 1855!

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.870
They're a fascinating read.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.000
Also in 1854, in Florence, Italy, Filippo
Pacini published a paper describing the microorganism

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.569
that caused the disease.

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.530
And in 1884, Robert Koch isolated the bacteria
and described how the cholera was spread.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.430
Since then, the disease has been mostly eradicated
in developed countries with proper sanitation.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:30.790
Each year cholera affects 1.3 to 4 million
people and causes 21,000 to 143,000 deaths

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.790
worldwide.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.340
There are several regions still affected,
including India, much of Africa, and most

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.720
recently, Haiti.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.080
After much investigation, into the 2010 Haitian
earthquake response, it is thought that some

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.960
Nepalese UN workers may have had cholera in
their systems, since Nepal was dealing with

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.730
an outbreak of their own.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.780
Because the septic tanks the UN workers used
emptied into a landfill that was close to

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:58.440
a river which was used for drinking and bathing
-- they spread that cholera to the local population.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.780
In August 2016, the UN admitted they played
a part in the outbreak and they are planning

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.790
to help with financial support.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:05.790
