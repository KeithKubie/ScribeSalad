00:00:13.436 --> 00:00:15.810
JASON SILVA: I think that one
of the things that we enjoy

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.040
the most as human beings
is to lose ourselves

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.500
in an experience,
to find ourselves

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.020
in a situation in which
the gravity of the moment,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.210
the weight of the now, is so
powerful that we find ourselves

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.295
outside ourselves.

00:00:33.295 --> 00:00:36.540
You become what you
behold, so to speak,

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.430
so that our neurotic,
inner critic--

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.370
the voice in our head
that is nagging us,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.200
anxious about the future
or saddened by the past,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.490
paralyzed by the past--
instead goes silent,

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:52.810
and there is grace
in this moment.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:57.010
The weight of the now in all
of its gravity and splendor--

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.090
particularly in a
preconfigured, epic context--

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.910
can serve to purge
you of your angst.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.150
This is a transformative
experience.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.720
I think when I come to a
place like this, whenever

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.940
I put myself outside myself,
I am able to pierce the veil.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.500
I am able to see beyond my
concerns and my constraints,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.500
and I connect with something
larger than myself.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.660
It's something that
we can all relate to.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.200
It's something that
we seek out, right?

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.700
And these moments, these
moments do something to us

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.890
that is medicinal, right?

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.364
This is existential medication.

00:01:36.364 --> 00:01:40.560
We address the existential
panic, the ontological panic,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.200
and we push it out of our minds.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.860
Death goes from being
an imminent panic

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.420
to a deferrable abstraction.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.650
Thoughts of mortality
dissipate, and we

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.820
get to inhabit some kind of
eternal now-- immortality

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.990
now as we smash our sense
of separateness in temples

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.860
of fragmentation in what
Alan Harrington called

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.430
a form of electronic Buddhism.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.370
It doesn't matter if it's
the rave concert or Burning

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.300
Man or an opera theater or
an IMAX screen or an epic

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.000
ocean-- the point
being these vistas,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.170
these contexts, these stages
become rites of passage,

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.330
transformative experiences,
moments of reconciliation.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:25.010
We slay the dragon,
we move forth,

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.850
and then the angst is
gone, at least temporarily.
