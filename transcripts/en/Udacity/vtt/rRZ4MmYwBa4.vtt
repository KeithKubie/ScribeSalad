00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.200
The answer here is order n logn.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.860
The order n procedure a is
called logn times by b.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.750
So that takes n times logn time.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.370
Then, we do log squared n work.

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.060
But this term is dominated
by the other term.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.850
Hence, only the first term matters.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.680
If this sort of analysis
is not familiar to you,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.480
then it would probably be a good idea to
review these ideas in one of the classic

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.870
algorithms textbooks, like Cormen,
Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein.
