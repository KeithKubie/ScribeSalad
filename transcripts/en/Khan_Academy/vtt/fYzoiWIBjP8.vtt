00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.730
Let's say I have the
vector field v.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.920
The vector at any given point
is equal to minus-- or the

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.570
magnitude of my x direction
is actually dependent on y.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.280
So where we are in the y
coordinate and the xy plane.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.385
Plus-- and then my magnitude
in the y direction

00:00:21.385 --> 00:00:22.470
is dependent on x.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.920
Fair enough.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:29.210
So first, let's just
chuck through this, and

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.090
figure out it's curl.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.680
So the curl of v.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.160
It is equal to our del
vector operator, cross v.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.780
Which is nothing but this.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.200
And even though this looks like
a two dimensional vector field,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.480
we actually have to take the
cross product in 3 dimensions.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.420
Because a curl is just like
torque, and when you-- like we

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.410
did the right hand rule when we
studied-- well, I hope you

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.750
watched some of the videos on
magnetism and torque-- but the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.780
torque actually goes in a
direction that is perpendicular

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.060
to both of the vectors
in your cross product.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.550
If both of these only have x
and y components, your actual

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:13.640
result is going to be
in the z direction.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.210
It's going to be perpendicular
to both of these vectors.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.750
So when you take the cross
product, you still have to

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.730
do it in 3 dimensions.

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:31.660
So i j k, partial with respect
to x, partial with respect to

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.400
y, partial with respect to z.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.690
The x component is minus y.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.500
The j component is x.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.920
And we have no k component.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.110
This one should be a little
bit cleaner to calculate

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.370
than the last example.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.150
So this is going to be equal
to-- well, see the i

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.195
component-- let's cross out
its column and its row.

00:01:53.195 --> 00:02:00.180
So it's going to be the partial
with respect to y of 0

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.980
minus the partial with
respect to z of x.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.030
Minus that.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.140
And all of that times i
minus-- and now it's going

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.870
to be the j component.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.180
Remember, you do
plus minus plus.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.960
So minus and this is
the j component.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.880
Cross out its row and column,
the partial derivative

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.300
of x with respect to 0.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.550
Or partial derivative of 0
with respect to x, actually.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:32.450
Minus the partial
derivative of z.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.840
Or the partial derivative
of the [? vector ?]

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.540
z of minus y.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.860
That's its j component.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.820
And finally, plus
its k component.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.630
Row and column.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:50.740
So the partial derivative with
respect to x minus the partial

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.280
derivative of y with
respect to minus y.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.360
And I know you can't read it,
but that's that minus y there,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.900
and that's the k component.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.990
And now let's simplify it.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.810
I'll simplify it above it.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.220
So this term-- let's see,
partial derivative of 0.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.950
Well, that's 0.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.360
Partial derivative of
x with respect to z.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.310
Well, as far as z's concerned,
x is a constant, so that's 0.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.280
Partial derivative of 0
with respect to x, 0.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.550
Partial derivative of minus
y with respect to z.

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.740
As far as z's concerned,
y is also constant.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.010
So that's 0.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.530
So all we're left is
with this last term.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:26.270
That was pretty
straightforward.

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:28.320
Why don't we just cross
all of that out?

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.420
And that makes intuitive
sense, too, right?

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.000
Because at least from x's point
of view, the rotation is--

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.990
although, the rotation, if you
think about it, is going to be

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:47.080
in the direction perpendicular
to both the x direction and

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.380
perpendicular to the direction
in which it is changing.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.370
You could kind of view it
orthogonally, to its direction

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:55.650
of motion, which is y.

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.310
So it would be the z direction.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.860
If that confuses you,
don't worry about it.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:01.420
But if it doesn't, then
you could apply the same

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.350
argument to the j vector.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:05.270
But anyway, lets simplify this.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.890
So this is equal to the
partial derivative of

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.280
x with respect to x.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.510
Well, that's just 1.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.270
Minus the partial derivative
of y-- of minus y

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.130
with respect to y.

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:18.750
Well, that's just minus 1.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.560
So it equals 2.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.330
So the curl, at any point of
this vector field, is 2.

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.380
Let's see what this vector
field looks like, and let's

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.590
see if that gives us-- if
our intuition holds

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.610
in this example.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:38.360
And let me try to make
it a little bit bigger.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.650
Make the window bigger.

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:42.510
There you go.

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.150
Well, I think it's clear, you
know, right when you look at

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.010
it, that this vector field
looks like it's spinning.

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.760
If you were to stick something,
especially in the middle, it's

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.450
very clear that it would spin.

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.450
But what might be a little
unintuitive-- you might think,

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.870
wow, well, wouldn't something
spin faster near the center

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:57.280
than it would here?

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.660
Why is the-- you know,
the curl we got is 2.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:00.450
It's a constant.

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.150
The curl is the same throughout
this entire vector field.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.680
So you'll be like, whoa, that's
kind of implying that the field

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:09.440
is making something spin
equally, no matter where

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.210
you are in the field.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.950
Let's see if that makes sense.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.730
Well, in the middle, it
definitely makes sense that

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:14.970
something is spinning.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:17.360
If I had a little stick here,
I'd be pushing in this

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.890
direction, with not that much
of a magnitude in

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:20.790
that direction.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:23.720
And then I'd be pushing down to
the right in this direction,

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.570
so it would cause it to spin.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.900
But what if I had that
same stick here?

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.810
You'd say, well, on the
top right I'm pushing

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.020
up, up and to the left.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:37.180
And the bottom left, I'm also
pushing up and to the left.

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.270
You know, it wouldn't
spin as much.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.880
But it would.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.390
Because the difference in
magnitudes of these 2-- you

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:45.530
could almost view them as the
torque producing forces-- the

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:49.390
difference in magnitude is
enough that you'd still have

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.030
the same counterclockwise
rotation here as you

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:53.800
would have here.

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.110
So because the curl is a
constant positive number, when

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.410
we look at the xy plane like
this, if you put a twig-- that

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:04.390
same twig anywhere where you
put it on this plane--

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.370
it'll have the same
counterclockwise rotation.

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.370
I think that's pretty neat.

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.150
Now let's do a
little experiment.

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:18.600
What would have happened
if this was plus y.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.900
So let's just do
that experiment.

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:29.930
If this was plus y then this
would have been plus y, then

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.060
this final term-- we would have
taken the partial derivative

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.110
with respect to y of plus y--
and so this would have

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:37.260
been 1 minus plus 1.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.050
And then our curl
would have been 0.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.710
Which would have meant that we
would have had no rotation.

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.030
And what's the
intuition of that?

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.070
Well, if we just look at it
mathematically, if we have 0

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:50.770
curl, somehow, the rotation in
our x direction must be being

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.230
offset by a rotation
in the y direction.

00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:55.290
That the torques must
be just perfectly

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.210
offsetting each other.

00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:58.350
Let's see what happens
if I were to change.

00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.740
So this was our old graph.

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.000
Let me actually change it
to my new vector field.

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:08.160
So that's our new vector field.

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.700
This is our vector
field plus yi plus xj.

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:14.890
And now the curl
is 0 everywhere.

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.540
Which implies, or which means,
that I could put a twig

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:23.310
anywhere here and I'm not going
to get any kind of rotation.

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.160
Let's see if that makes sense.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.070
If I put a twig in the center,
or some kind of stick in

00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:30.740
the center, let's see.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:34.330
I would have the forces or the
fluids pushing in in this

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.860
direction, but they're not
helping to rotate, and pushing

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.280
out in that direction.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.870
Well, that's not going
to help me either.

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:42.110
So I'm definitely not
going to rotate there.

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.070
And actually, you could
put a twig anywhere.

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:46.240
And maybe a twig might be
pushed in a direction.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.520
For example, if I put a twig
here, it's going to be pushed

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.450
outward by the flow of the
water, by the velocity

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.350
of the water.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:53.920
But it's not going to rotate.

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.720
So the [? ink ?]

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.230
kind of holds.

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:59.740
That's even though I kind of
have curl in the x direction,

00:07:59.740 --> 00:08:01.300
or I have curl in the
y direction, they're

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:02.590
offsetting each other.

00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:04.720
So that in 2 dimensions,
I actually end up

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.990
having no rotation.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.070
And actually, this is called an
irrotational-- I think that's

00:08:10.070 --> 00:08:11.410
the word-- vector field.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.510
Where you're not going to
have any rotation here.

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:17.520
All of the-- if you think of it
as force or velocity of the

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:21.350
vector field-- is going to be
applying translation to

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.870
objects in that field.

00:08:23.870 --> 00:08:25.520
And actually, just for fun,
let's think about the

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.630
divergence of that field.

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:27.900
Just to, I don't know.

00:08:27.900 --> 00:08:30.250
Just because I have 2 minutes.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.180
So if I were to think about the
divergence of that field, it's

00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:35.340
fairly easy to calculate.

00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:37.920
Let me erase this real fast.

00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.240
It's always fun to just
interpret a vector

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.400
field to death.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.320
Let's do the divergence
of this one.

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.000
So the divergence of that
vector field, is just a

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.210
partial derivative of
this with respect to x.

00:08:50.210 --> 00:08:58.350
So div of v is the same thing
as our del operator dot

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:00.230
our vector field, v.

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:01.810
And that's the partial
derivative of this

00:09:01.810 --> 00:09:03.260
with respect to x.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:06.290
Well, the partial derivative of
y with respect to x is just 0.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:11.140
Plus the partial derivative
of x with respect to y.

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:12.860
So this is 0.

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.520
So the divergence of
this field is 0.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.430
And even in the other case,
when this was a minus, it

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:18.240
still would have been 0.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:20.590
And does that make sense?

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:23.110
Well, if we take a circle
anywhere here-- let's take it

00:09:23.110 --> 00:09:25.050
in the center, because the
center's the most interesting.

00:09:25.050 --> 00:09:26.300
Let's take a circle.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.690
So we do have some fluid or
particles coming in at a

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.940
certain velocity from the
bottom right and the top left.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.410
But just as much is coming
out through the top right

00:09:35.410 --> 00:09:38.100
and the bottom left.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.650
Whatever's coming in through
here and here is leaving

00:09:40.650 --> 00:09:41.490
through there and there.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:46.330
So if I had an infinitesimally
small circle, or sphere, in

00:09:46.330 --> 00:09:50.650
this vector field, I would have
no net density increasing.

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:53.500
Or nothing would be entering
into that circle, or in any

00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:55.880
given amount of time the
concentration of that

00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:57.060
circle wouldn't change.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:58.660
And that's true pretty
much anywhere.

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:03.060
If I were to draw a circle
here, because the divergence

00:10:03.060 --> 00:10:05.630
is 0, it's telling us that
whatever's coming in in 1

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.060
direction is coming out
in the other directions.

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:11.540
So I'm not getting any
denser, or any less dense.

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:15.080
I have no divergence
or convergence.

00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:16.040
So that's just interesting.

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:17.120
Well, now I've run of time.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:19.150
So we're done analyzing
this vector field.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:21.300
See you in the next video.
