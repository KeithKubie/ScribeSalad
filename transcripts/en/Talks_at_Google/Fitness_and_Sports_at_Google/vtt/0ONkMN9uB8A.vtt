[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.844 --> 00:00:08.119
SPEAKER: Thank you
all for being here.

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:09.670
We have a great guest today.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.410
We have AJ Edelman.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:14.110
AJ is a four-time
Israeli National Champion

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.670
in the skeleton event.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.586
And you represented Israel
in the 2018 Winter Olympics.

00:00:18.586 --> 00:00:19.336
AJ EDELMAN: I did.

00:00:19.336 --> 00:00:19.420
Yes.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.450
SPEAKER: So thank
you for being here.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.033
AJ EDELMAN: Thank
you for having them.

00:00:22.033 --> 00:00:26.410
I finally get the interview at
Google that I never got before.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.900
SPEAKER: So let's
start at the beginning.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.830
You grew up in Boston.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:30.580
AJ EDELMAN: I did.

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.630
SPEAKER: You grew
up playing hockey,

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.887
starting at three years old.

00:00:32.887 --> 00:00:33.970
So you've been on the ice.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.440
You've been involved
in athletics.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.400
What was childhood like,
being an athlete in the sport?

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.530
AJ EDELMAN: Well, I
started at age three.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.730
I started really young,
because my parents,

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.170
they believed in giving
my two brothers and myself

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.750
the opportunity to have an
active lifestyle if we chose.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.980
So getting on the ice in Boston
was very, very accessible.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.380
I got on the ice at age
three, and I thought to myself

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.257
at the time that--

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:58.840
this is probably the
first time I ever

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.880
thought in an
engineering kind of way--

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.930
but that the expected value
of playing time for a goalie

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.610
was a full game.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.390
So that was one right there.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.540
But the expected
value for somebody

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.320
who is a defenseman
or center was probably

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.640
like a quarter of a game.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.140
So it was a far better value
proposition to become a goalie.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.630
So I decided to become a
goalie, and played in net

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.550
for the next 20-plus years.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.570
And sports shaped a good deal
of how I viewed the world

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.070
and taught me a lot
of good lessons.

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.469
SPEAKER: So growing
up, you played at MIT

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:30.510
when you went to college?

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:31.260
AJ EDELMAN: I did.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.799
SPEAKER: Did you
kind of always know

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.840
that you want to stay in
sports and be an athlete

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.160
or was this just a fun thing
growing up and a hobby?

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.814
AJ EDELMAN: Originally
it started out--

00:01:40.814 --> 00:01:41.980
it kind of ebbed and flowed.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.984
So it started as a
serious endeavor.

00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:46.900
And around eighth grade,
I had the opportunity

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.010
to kind of take it
to the next level.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.030
I had some scholarship
opportunities for prep schools.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.530
That's the route
that you want to go

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.196
to take to get to a
D1 level of playing.

00:01:57.196 --> 00:01:59.320
And I thought to myself,
well, that's just not what

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.510
people from my back--

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.900
I'm a religious Jew.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.240
That's really not what
people from my background

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.990
generally do.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.747
I probably should just stick
to more academic pursuits

00:02:08.747 --> 00:02:09.580
and not pursue that.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.940
And so it kind of
ebbed away, where

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.200
it became far less serious.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.470
And then later on, during a year
off in Israel when I was 19,

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.030
I decided to rededicate
myself to athletics.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.040
SPEAKER: And so you took some
time off from the athletics,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.832
and you graduate, and you
move out to San Francisco,

00:02:26.832 --> 00:02:28.165
and you start working at Oracle.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.210
You have a promising
tech career.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.090
How did you decide
that being an Olympian

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.352
was going to be your goal?

00:02:35.352 --> 00:02:37.060
AJ EDELMAN: So it's
an interesting story,

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.160
but I decided actually in 2013,
when I was in my senior year

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:44.590
at MIT, that I wanted
to be an Olympian.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.280
But how I there was
more process of wanting

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.350
to accomplish something great.

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.230
It's a mindset that I've
had since childhood.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.620
When I was at age 10, I
moved to a new school,

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.090
and I was the odd kid out.

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.860
I experienced a lot of bullying
when I was at that school.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.330
And it really left
a lot of scarring.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.250
But when I was there,
one of the ways

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.910
that I coped with
the difficulties

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.080
was that I thought that, in 20
years, 30 years, none of this

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.650
would matter.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.720
None of that time
period would matter.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.220
What would matter is what
I accomplished out of life.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.130
And so I thought
every day, when I'd

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:26.982
experienced all this trouble,
that in 35 years, 30 years, 20

00:03:26.982 --> 00:03:28.940
years, I'm going to stand
on top of a mountain.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:30.523
I didn't know yet
that it was actually

00:03:30.523 --> 00:03:32.844
going to be a
mountain, but that I

00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:34.510
was going to stand
on top of a mountain,

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.640
having accomplished some
pretty good things, having

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.723
left my mark on the world.

00:03:37.723 --> 00:03:43.530
So over the course of
the 17 years since then,

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.380
when I've faced
certain challenges,

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.530
that essence of "be the best,"
"accomplish something great"

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.710
has come out.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.200
So it happened three
distinct times in my life.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.380
The first was in my
teenage years, when

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.020
I was extremely
academically unmotivated,

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.910
and I decided to make a shift
at trying to get into MIT.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.670
Because I wrote,
right now you're

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:06.880
unmotivated, make a goal.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:08.440
I tried to get into MIT.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.090
That was the level
of excellence that I

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.252
thought, of going to
an engineering school,

00:04:12.252 --> 00:04:13.210
that I wanted to go to.

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.890
So I got into MIT.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.920
The second was when I was
in a gap year in Israel 19,

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.400
I let myself go from
a physical standpoint.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:26.820
I'd reached about
200-plus pounds.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.740
I think I tipped the scale
one day at 203 pounds.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.030
And I looked down, I
couldn't see my toes one day,

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.290
and I thought, well,
where did that kid

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.780
go who said he was going
to be the best of the best?

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.450
Like, is this the best version
of you that you can be?

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.920
Is this what you really want?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.489
And so at that point, I wasn't
thinking about hockey anymore.

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:50.780
I wasn't thinking about sports.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.130
But I said the way
to deal with what

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.650
you're dealing with right now
is become an athlete again.

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:58.025
But don't just
become an athlete.

00:04:58.025 --> 00:04:59.390
Be a great athlete.

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.557
And so I took a deep
dive on everything

00:05:02.557 --> 00:05:04.390
that I could learn about
health and fitness,

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.530
lost 35 pounds in three
months, and decided

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.680
to try to make the
MIT hockey team.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.600
Made the MIT hockey team, and
then for the next few years,

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.130
played at MIT.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.120
But as I came to the end
of my hockey career at MIT,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.430
I was faced with, well,
what do I do next?

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:22.040
And if I'm going to
continue in sport,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.200
it has to be
something that, if I'm

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.615
going to sacrifice next
few years of my life,

00:05:26.615 --> 00:05:29.309
it has to have an actual impact.

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:30.600
It can't just be great for you.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.480
It has to be great
for the world, right?

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.820
It has to have some
kind of impact,

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.520
that people will look back
and say, that happened.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.300
And so, one night, I'm sitting--

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:45.050
I don't know if any
of you guys are aware,

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.790
but there's a dorm at
MIT called Burton Conner.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.370
I was sitting in the Burton
Conner suite lounge of my dorm,

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.240
and the news came on,
the 11 o'clock news.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.380
On that news segment was the
US team trials for Sochi.

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.300
And so I saw the
bobsled team going

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.820
and I thought, well,
that looks amazing.

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:06.410
Bobsled looks intense.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.670
Like, I'm in the gym all day.

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:08.753
I could push heavy things.

00:06:08.753 --> 00:06:12.050
I'm pretty good with my hands
and hand-eye coordination.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.490
I'll do that.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.110
And being an
Olympian would allow

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:19.670
me to speak with some
authority on sports.

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.730
And one of my passions is
getting more young Jewish kids

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:24.650
involved in sports, that
have those resources

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.500
available to them that may
not be available to them now,

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.290
but they can know
that they can be--

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.321
sports is a good
outlet for them.

00:06:32.321 --> 00:06:33.320
So I thought, all right.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.460
So I'm going to
become an Olympian,

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.690
and I'm going to become a
very proud Israeli Olympian.

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.820
SPEAKER: So was it
the gap year that you

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:42.920
decided you wanted to
become an Israeli citizen?

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:46.440
And what was that
process like for you?

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.170
AJ EDELMAN: In the year
2006, I went to Israel

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:54.350
on a summer tour.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:56.360
But that summer,
we were supposed

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.030
to travel with this group,
north and south across Israel

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:00.350
visiting all these sites.

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.830
But the second Lebanon
War abruptly broke out,

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:05.690
and we had to shelter
in place, so to speak,

00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:07.640
in Jerusalem for a long while.

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.180
There was rockets coming
over the border every day.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.920
I think it really
was the connections

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:18.320
I made during that time, and
just seeing the Israeli society

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:21.740
as they came under attack, that
I formed an immense connection,

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:23.840
like a very intense
connection, deep connection,

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:25.320
to the land of Israel.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.860
And I thought, one day, I'm
going to be an Israeli citizen.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.230
I want to be part
of this society.

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.800
And that was when I decided in
2006 that, one day, eventually,

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.730
I'd be Israeli.

00:07:34.730 --> 00:07:36.355
SPEAKER: And how did
you-- when did you

00:07:36.355 --> 00:07:37.460
become an Israeli citizen?

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.937
AJ EDELMAN: I officially
became Israeli in 2016.

00:07:39.937 --> 00:07:40.520
SPEAKER: 2016.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.186
AJ EDELMAN: Yes.

00:07:41.186 --> 00:07:42.650
SPEAKER: OK.

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:44.276
I want to talk a
little about skeleton,

00:07:44.276 --> 00:07:46.650
but I don't know if everyone
here who's going to see this

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:47.700
knows what that is.

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:47.870
AJ EDELMAN: Sure.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.670
SPEAKER: So can you
explain the sport

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.132
and what it's like to
experience that thrill?

00:07:53.132 --> 00:07:53.840
AJ EDELMAN: Sure.

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:59.210
So many people have seen
the movie "Cool Runnings."

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.354
Skeleton athletes, we kind
of have a bit of a complex,

00:08:03.354 --> 00:08:05.270
because everybody knows
bobsled, and everybody

00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:06.620
knows "Cool Runnings."

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:09.030
So we usually start out
our conversation with,

00:08:09.030 --> 00:08:10.790
oh, do you guys know
"Cool Runnings?"

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:12.373
And everybody will
nod their head yes.

00:08:12.373 --> 00:08:14.240
And they say, well,
do you know there's

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.490
another sport called skeleton?

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:16.660
They say no.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:23.510
So bobsled is where the vehicle
being driven down the track

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.237
is the bullet.

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:25.820
They said, let's
take a vehicle, let's

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.700
drive it as quick as possible
down a mile long track,

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:30.530
reach speeds of
90 miles an hour,

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:32.340
and somebody steers
with their hands.

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:36.230
Skeleton was, they said, let's
make the human the bullet.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:39.439
We'll put him on his stomach,
and he'll steer with his head.

00:08:39.439 --> 00:08:40.730
And so that's what skeleton is.

00:08:40.730 --> 00:08:41.938
You start from a dead sprint.

00:08:41.938 --> 00:08:43.820
You have a 70-pound sled.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:45.380
You put it on the ice.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.060
You sprint about 30
meters down a hill.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:48.320
You dive forward onto it.

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.740
And then you navigate
over a mile long track

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:55.250
under 5G forces,
towards the end.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.920
And whoever reaches the bottom
in the quickest time in one

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.090
piece is the victor.

00:09:01.090 --> 00:09:03.256
SPEAKER: So I think that's
a very kind of crazy

00:09:03.256 --> 00:09:04.630
and interesting
piece to that, is

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.970
that you grew up playing goalie,
so you weren't sprinting.

00:09:07.970 --> 00:09:09.987
You never really
participated in a sport.

00:09:09.987 --> 00:09:11.570
How did you decide
that this was going

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:14.150
to be the one that you were
going to be an Olympian in?

00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:17.780
AJ EDELMAN: So as I
mentioned, bobsled

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.580
was really the passion
sport of mine that I saw.

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.950
And I saw bobsled.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:23.990
I said, I want to do bobsled.

00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:28.550
So I messaged, I googled, is
there an Israeli bobsled team?

00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:30.200
It turned out that
there had been,

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.750
but they had kind of
hung up their spikes,

00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:38.597
so to speak, after trying to
qualify for the 2006 games.

00:09:38.597 --> 00:09:39.680
But I found their website.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:40.830
I messaged them.

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.670
I said, hey, I'm this kid.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:44.269
I'm in Boston.

00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:45.560
I'm about to graduate from MIT.

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:47.390
I really want to do
bobsled for Israel.

00:09:47.390 --> 00:09:50.110
I really want to start
an Israeli bobsled team.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:54.170
And so they messaged back,
and they said, listen,

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:57.020
nobody wants to do
this sport from Israel,

00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:59.990
and you have to get multiple
people to do it with you.

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.730
You can't just do it solo.

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:05.380
So your likely bet,
the best bet for you,

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:07.600
is to do a solo sport
called skeleton.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.832
Go check it out.

00:10:08.832 --> 00:10:09.790
So I YouTubed skeleton.

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:10.180
I saw it.

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.096
It looked pretty intense,
and I went to try it

00:10:12.096 --> 00:10:13.375
in Lake Placid, New York.

00:10:13.375 --> 00:10:15.250
And when I tried it in
Lake Placid, New York,

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:22.180
there's a bobsled track that
was used in the Olympics

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.440
back in the '80s.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:27.102
And you get to try it, but they
pad you up like a Michelin man,

00:10:27.102 --> 00:10:28.810
so you don't feel any
pain at that point.

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:31.210
If you hit a wall, it just
feels like, easy breezy,

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:31.870
like skydiving.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:34.210
It's perfect.

00:10:34.210 --> 00:10:36.580
You only feel the pain
later, but at that moment,

00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:39.370
I was just feeling like I was on
a roller coaster with no belts.

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:41.350
So I was like,
oh, this is great.

00:10:41.350 --> 00:10:43.930
I additionally tried speed
skating, and speed skating,

00:10:43.930 --> 00:10:45.340
I took to quite well.

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.360
But for reasons that were--

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.320
skeleton presented
a bigger challenge,

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.290
and so I decided
to pursue skeleton.

00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:54.730
SPEAKER: So I want to go
into a little bit about how

00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:55.605
you trained for this.

00:10:55.605 --> 00:10:57.640
There's only so many
tracks in the world.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.260
There's definitely
none in Israel.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:01.730
I don't believe there's one
in the middle of a desert.

00:11:01.730 --> 00:11:04.160
So how did you learn
to do this sport

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.862
and become good enough to
qualify at an Olympic level?

00:11:07.862 --> 00:11:08.570
AJ EDELMAN: Sure.

00:11:11.690 --> 00:11:14.837
There's a lot of moving parts
to training for an Olympics.

00:11:14.837 --> 00:11:17.170
There's a lot of moving parts
specifically for skeleton.

00:11:17.170 --> 00:11:20.920
Skeleton is broken down into
the sprinting component,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:22.630
and then the driving component.

00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:25.540
The driving component
is physical skill

00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:27.910
with your brain and
hand-eye coordination

00:11:27.910 --> 00:11:30.860
and knowing how to manipulate
yourself under 5G forces.

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:33.490
So for reference, 5G forces--

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.880
I was about 180 pounds
when I competed on average.

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:40.420
5G forces would feel like
somebody put a 900 pound

00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:44.590
human being on my back abruptly
when going through a turn.

00:11:44.590 --> 00:11:47.110
So under those heavy
loads, you have

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:51.876
to manipulate your shoulders and
your knees to torque the sled.

00:11:51.876 --> 00:11:53.750
And it's an incredibly
difficult thing to do,

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:57.477
because if you do it incorrectly
by a few fractions of a second,

00:11:57.477 --> 00:11:59.810
you can drive yourself to the
roof or down to the floor,

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.680
and you can severely--
you can concuss yourself.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:08.920
So I decided that the number one
way to become good at anything

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:11.070
is by dedicating the
entirety of your time to it

00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:14.130
and achieving 10,000 hours.

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.140
I was told originally that I
was really bad at the sport.

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:18.930
Like, really atrocious.

00:12:18.930 --> 00:12:21.380
I lacked all the skills
necessary for doing it.

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:23.750
The scouting report
originally was

00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:25.850
that I lacked the tools
necessary to become

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:28.220
a competitive skeleton
athlete, that I might

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:32.300
be on a small scale
developmentally competitive

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:33.920
on a lower circuit,
but would never

00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:37.070
achieve a measure of
success in the sport itself.

00:12:37.070 --> 00:12:38.930
So that, to me, was a challenge.

00:12:38.930 --> 00:12:41.600
And the reason that they said
that was because, unknown to me

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.620
at the time, when I entered a
corner in those early training

00:12:45.620 --> 00:12:49.160
runs in Lake Placid, , I
would always kink my body

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:50.150
to the right.

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:51.340
And I didn't know why.

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.820
But they said, you
should probably

00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:54.020
see a chiropractor for that.

00:12:54.020 --> 00:12:54.974
It's like, well, why?

00:12:54.974 --> 00:12:56.390
It wasn't until
years later that I

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.060
realized that I found out
after we did a body scan

00:12:59.060 --> 00:13:00.890
that I had some scoliosis.

00:13:00.890 --> 00:13:05.604
The second aspect of it
was that I couldn't sprint.

00:13:05.604 --> 00:13:07.520
I was an atrocious
sprinter, and the sprinting

00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.010
is more than one
third of your run,

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:12.690
essentially, because of
the compounded velocity.

00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.155
And so to overcome my
deficit in the sprint,

00:13:15.155 --> 00:13:17.030
I thought I was just
going to become the best

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.430
driver that I could be.

00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:22.940
So 10,000 hours over four years
is about eight hours a day

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:25.280
for seven days a
week for 365 days

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.480
a year for four straight years.

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:31.340
I had a job at the
time at Oracle.

00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.850
I had a real life.

00:13:32.850 --> 00:13:37.880
So what I did was I left a video
loop of YouTube on every day.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.610
I watched at least six to
eight hours of World Cup

00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.430
footage of skeleton, and
then I would mentally

00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:45.710
visualize myself going down
the tracks to create what

00:13:45.710 --> 00:13:47.000
are called neural pathways.

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.756
The neural pathways
we have in our brain,

00:13:48.756 --> 00:13:50.630
they're highways of
information, and the more

00:13:50.630 --> 00:13:51.860
you think about
something, the quicker it

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:53.400
is to make that connection.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.810
And so I would watch six to
eight hours of these videos.

00:13:56.810 --> 00:13:58.340
I'd put myself on
a skeleton set.

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:00.110
I'd lie down, and
I'd imagine myself

00:14:00.110 --> 00:14:02.810
going through the track,
six to eight hours a day,

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:05.840
every day, for 365 days
a year, over four years.

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.880
I reached 10,000 hours.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.770
That was how I
trained originally

00:14:09.770 --> 00:14:11.480
when I wasn't on the ice.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:13.760
When I was on the ice, I
took three to four times

00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:16.700
the recommended run volume
for a skeleton athlete.

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.700
So skeleton athlete is supposed
to take two to three runs a day

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.080
for head health reasons.

00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:25.130
I took about eight runs
a day, seven runs a day.

00:14:25.130 --> 00:14:29.060
It takes a tremendous
physical toll.

00:14:29.060 --> 00:14:31.610
But it also means
that you can speed up

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.530
that process of making
those connections.

00:14:33.530 --> 00:14:38.840
And I took to the sport because
of that, not very quickly,

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:41.390
but I reached a level that
I was looking to reach

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:42.770
in a short amount of time.

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:45.170
SPEAKER: You mentioned that
you used virtual reality too

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:45.836
as part of that.

00:14:45.836 --> 00:14:47.720
How did that play
into your training?

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:50.870
AJ EDELMAN: Those mental runs
that I was doing, at one point,

00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:52.950
I thought there was a
way to up that game.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:56.960
So I got myself a gear
headset for my phone,

00:14:56.960 --> 00:14:59.300
and I loaded up a
point of view video,

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.820
and I would lie down on
my sled and put the gear

00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:06.410
headset over my head, and just
for an hour at a time, just

00:15:06.410 --> 00:15:09.860
watch a running loop of myself
going down the skeleton track,

00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.520
and then practicing the
movements to familiarize myself

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:16.160
with what I would do if I was
in the track at various points

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.036
in time.

00:15:17.036 --> 00:15:18.410
SPEAKER: So you
knew 10,000 hours

00:15:18.410 --> 00:15:20.300
was going to take four years.

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.664
And you started four years
before the 2018 Olympics.

00:15:22.664 --> 00:15:23.330
AJ EDELMAN: Yes.

00:15:23.330 --> 00:15:25.460
SPEAKER: And when did you
realize that you actually

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.860
had a shot at making
this Olympics and not

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:28.610
the next Olympics?

00:15:31.672 --> 00:15:33.630
AJ EDELMAN: To put it
all into context, really,

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.130
the goal was to make
the 2022 Olympic Games.

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:40.820
So when I was told that
I lacked the components

00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:46.130
necessary to become a
competitive skeleton athlete,

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.910
I thought, well, it
was my 23rd birthday.

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:52.760
It was March 14 of 2014.

00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:56.300
I sat down in the cafeteria
at the Lake Placid Olympic

00:15:56.300 --> 00:15:58.640
Training Center, and I
googled how many days

00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:01.085
until the 2022 Olympic Games.

00:16:01.085 --> 00:16:04.410
It turned out that
there were 2,884 days.

00:16:04.410 --> 00:16:06.170
So I sat down at the
table and I said,

00:16:06.170 --> 00:16:10.040
wrote on a piece of paper,
2,884, I circled it.

00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:14.090
And I said that for 2,884
days, I wouldn't stop training,

00:16:14.090 --> 00:16:17.180
and if I didn't make the
Olympic Games in 2022,

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:20.750
only then could I
stop that journey.

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:24.596
In 2016, it was an incredibly
difficult year for me,

00:16:24.596 --> 00:16:26.470
but it was the first
time that I participated

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:28.184
in a world championships.

00:16:28.184 --> 00:16:29.600
And after the world
championships,

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.600
most people hang up their
spikes for the season.

00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.372
They're done.

00:16:32.372 --> 00:16:33.830
It occurs in
mid-February, and they

00:16:33.830 --> 00:16:36.110
think that it's their
last competition.

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:37.340
They go home.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:38.750
But I thought like--

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:43.610
I have a mindset that if you're
not training on Christmas,

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:44.990
your opponents are.

00:16:44.990 --> 00:16:49.250
So I had a month to
gain valuable experience

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.130
on my opponents that
they weren't taking.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.544
So I thought, well, where's
the latest track open?

00:16:55.544 --> 00:16:56.960
And it turned out
that it would be

00:16:56.960 --> 00:17:00.150
Sigulda, Latvia, was open
until March 16 of that year.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:01.999
So I had a month
to go to Sigulda.

00:17:01.999 --> 00:17:03.290
I had no experience in Sigulda.

00:17:03.290 --> 00:17:06.095
And Sigulda, it
turns out, that it

00:17:06.095 --> 00:17:09.440
is the probably most physically
punishing and dangerous track

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:10.730
on tour.

00:17:10.730 --> 00:17:13.150
So I headed to
Sigulda, and every day,

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:17.020
for three, four, or five
times a day, I'd run down,

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:20.020
you know, I'd take my rounds
down the Sigulda track,

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:24.060
I broke an ankle while
I was in Sigulda.

00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:25.839
It was an incredibly
painful time.

00:17:25.839 --> 00:17:28.240
It took a tremendous
mental toll.

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:30.790
On March 14, it was
two years after I'd

00:17:30.790 --> 00:17:34.360
made the 2,884 day commitment.

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:37.390
But that day, I spent it
alone at the bobsled track.

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:39.640
Nobody was there, but I was
working out late at night.

00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:42.310
And I just decided-- like,
I'd reached burnout point.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.709
So I decided like, I'm
just going to quit.

00:17:44.709 --> 00:17:45.250
I'm finished.

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.130
I'm done.

00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:49.960
So I was messaging Oracle at
the time, who had given me

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:50.920
a leave of absence.

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.503
So I was messaging them that I
was going to come back a little

00:17:53.503 --> 00:17:54.370
early.

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:58.255
But before I did that,
I watched the commercial

00:17:58.255 --> 00:17:59.630
that Procter and
Gamble puts out.

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:00.550
It's an amazing commercial.

00:18:00.550 --> 00:18:02.650
You guys should go YouTube
it when this is done.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.030
It's called "Thank You, Moms."

00:18:04.030 --> 00:18:06.760
And it's a really powerful
commercial that always moved me

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.780
to tears, because it goes
through these kids from when

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:14.890
they're extremely young, and
they're falling on their butts,

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:18.530
and it's a figure skater,
and she falls in competition.

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:19.990
It just goes
through their years.

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:21.760
Their mom's always
down on the sidelines.

00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:25.210
And then eventually it cuts
out, and the next scene

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:28.450
is the Olympians going through.

00:18:28.450 --> 00:18:31.600
And then they point to
their mom in the crowd,

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.060
you know, they're crying, and
I'm crying, everybody's crying.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:42.640
So that to me was like,
am I really going to quit?

00:18:42.640 --> 00:18:44.020
I should be that dude.

00:18:44.020 --> 00:18:47.680
So at that point,
I messaged Oracle

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.520
that I was going to leave
them and pursue skeleton

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:53.120
as a full-time endeavor.

00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:56.147
And that was when I made
the commitment that it

00:18:56.147 --> 00:18:57.355
wasn't just going to be 2022.

00:18:57.355 --> 00:18:59.472
It was going to be 2018.

00:18:59.472 --> 00:19:01.090
SPEAKER: So when
did you qualify,

00:19:01.090 --> 00:19:02.590
and when did you
know you were going

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:04.486
to be in the 2018 Olympics?

00:19:04.486 --> 00:19:06.110
AJ EDELMAN: The
qualification came down

00:19:06.110 --> 00:19:07.190
to the last two races.

00:19:07.190 --> 00:19:12.070
It was really-- the
season was in severe doubt

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:13.750
from the outset.

00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:15.970
From the beginning,
the athlete is

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.310
supposed to qualify the
country, not himself.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.620
And so it works on
a ranking system.

00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:24.550
If a skeleton athlete achieves a
rank that is of certain ranking

00:19:24.550 --> 00:19:27.520
relative to his peers,
then the country

00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.745
gets an invitation to
go to the Olympic Games,

00:19:29.745 --> 00:19:31.780
and they can send who they want.

00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:34.480
And so from the
beginning of the season,

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.620
we had myself and another
potentially competitive

00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:41.740
skeleton athlete, and
there were two circuits

00:19:41.740 --> 00:19:44.110
that we can compete on.

00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:45.580
One of the circuits
traditionally

00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.860
provided a better points
opportunity, a better

00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:51.700
ranking opportunity, for
which to get that invitation.

00:19:51.700 --> 00:19:55.600
The thing is is that everybody
took a look at the last cycle

00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:59.530
and said, OK, so that
one's far better.

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:01.439
So everybody is like--

00:20:01.439 --> 00:20:02.980
so we're all going
to go to that one.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.190
So all the competitive athletes
went to that mid-level circuit

00:20:06.190 --> 00:20:08.350
which I was training on.

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:10.280
Nobody showed up to
the lower level races.

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:14.290
So there was an
immediate option.

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:15.640
What do we do do?

00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:19.030
Do both' Israeli athletes
go to the lower level races,

00:20:19.030 --> 00:20:22.030
or do we go one to each
race to cover our bases,

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:26.080
and hold the other athletes at
the other race back from points

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:28.550
while the other one
accrued his points?

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:32.560
And so the team
leadership aspect

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:35.950
demanded that we split the time,
and that, I, as Israel's number

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:38.530
one, go to the more
difficult competitions.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.970
So for the entirety
of the season,

00:20:39.970 --> 00:20:43.630
I was actually down in
points, not in a position

00:20:43.630 --> 00:20:45.790
to qualify for the games
until the final two races.

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:50.410
So the cutoff for qualifying
for the Olympics was January 14.

00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.060
The Olympics started
on February 9.

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:54.250
The cutoff was January 14.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:58.660
Everybody would know if they had
kind of made it by January 16.

00:20:58.660 --> 00:21:02.830
January 10 and 11 where the
final two races in Lake Placid,

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.490
and I went not in the
top Israeli position

00:21:06.490 --> 00:21:09.310
and not in a position to
qualify for the games.

00:21:09.310 --> 00:21:13.930
The two races I needed to
pull Israel's best results--

00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:17.470
Israel had only ever
achieved one fifth place

00:21:17.470 --> 00:21:19.380
result in Placid.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:21.850
I needed to achieve two
medal results for Israel.

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:24.370
Top six are medal in
skeleton, because it's

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.280
considered a very
difficult criteria to meet.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.360
And so in the final two
races, I did pull two medals

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.880
and qualified-- we
found out January 16

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.940
that I had received the
invite for the Olympic Games.

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.950
SPEAKER: So now, you're
going to the Olympics.

00:21:38.950 --> 00:21:41.444
You're one of 10 athletes
representing Israel.

00:21:41.444 --> 00:21:43.360
What was the opening
ceremonies like, and then

00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:45.820
what was the event like, I
mean, being on the biggest world

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:46.510
stage?

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:48.250
AJ EDELMAN: A lot
of people asked

00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:50.200
what the Olympics
in general is like.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.174
And I essentially say
that the Olympics is,

00:21:53.174 --> 00:21:55.090
from an athlete's
perspective, at least to me,

00:21:55.090 --> 00:21:56.840
it was like a big summer camp.

00:21:56.840 --> 00:21:58.300
It's just a
televised summer camp

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.530
with lots of external
drama for the TV viewers.

00:22:01.530 --> 00:22:04.975
But walking into
the stadium was--

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:10.300
you know that it's a
momentous occasion.

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.950
You know that,
forever, when people

00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:15.184
look at opening ceremonies
for the 2018 games,

00:22:15.184 --> 00:22:17.350
they're going to see the
Israeli delegation walk in,

00:22:17.350 --> 00:22:19.490
and you are one of
those 10 athletes.

00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:25.700
It's a huge-- it's not a
weight, but you feel it.

00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:28.790
So walking into the stadium,
it was a Friday night.

00:22:28.790 --> 00:22:33.950
And Friday night is Sabbath,
and as I wasn't using my phone.

00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:35.840
And so, I'm probably
the only one

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:37.879
in that stadium
who wasn't videoing

00:22:37.879 --> 00:22:38.920
walking into the stadium.

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.336
Everybody else is like, walking
in with a flag in one hand

00:22:41.336 --> 00:22:42.650
and a phone in the other hand.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:45.870
And so, they're walking
both flags in both hands.

00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.470
But it was just
incredible experience

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:51.230
to walk into that same.

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.840
It's indescribable, the
feeling that you have,

00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:56.660
knowing that you are
there for your country.

00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:59.900
SPEAKER: And then, how did
the Olympics go for you?

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:03.920
AJ EDELMAN: That's a bit
more of a nuanced question.

00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.940
The Olympics, I treat
it as any other race.

00:23:07.940 --> 00:23:08.940
I was there to do a job.

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:09.440
All right.

00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:13.400
So the Olympics seem like a
great big party, and in a way,

00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:14.240
they are.

00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:19.040
Like, they're a massively
expensive, huge big party.

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:21.920
But for me, as a
skeleton athlete,

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.337
I'm sent there by my country.

00:23:23.337 --> 00:23:24.920
The only reason I'm
there is because I

00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:27.200
was given an invite
by my country to go

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.040
do a job on their behalf.

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.420
And so I approached the race
like any other race that I had.

00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.850
Spent all of my day
working on the track.

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:37.470
It was a new track, so I
didn't have any notes on it.

00:23:37.470 --> 00:23:41.360
I didn't have a coach there
who could help me out.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:44.870
And so it was just
trying everyday

00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:49.250
to work on how I could become
better during my skeleton run.

00:23:49.250 --> 00:23:53.720
It was a difficult
time, because it

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.970
seemed like there were all
these distractions that you

00:23:55.970 --> 00:23:57.650
could take part in.

00:23:57.650 --> 00:24:03.800
And to some extent,
I think that if I

00:24:03.800 --> 00:24:05.570
were to ever go to
another Olympics,

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:07.380
that I'd make more
of the distractions.

00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:10.250
Like, you should you should
partake in part of the party.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.010
But the Olympics
were not extremely--

00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:16.010
they didn't go as
expected, because it

00:24:16.010 --> 00:24:17.595
was all work and no play.

00:24:17.595 --> 00:24:19.970
SPEAKER: So I want to talk a
little bit about some themes

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:21.830
that you've kind
of mentioned today.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:24.440
Perseverance seems to be
the definition of you,

00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:26.150
being told so many
times that you're

00:24:26.150 --> 00:24:28.290
the wrong fit, wrong sport.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:31.550
How do you approach overcoming
some of the negativity that

00:24:31.550 --> 00:24:35.045
was brought in and to become
one of the best in your sports?

00:24:39.870 --> 00:24:42.000
AJ EDELMAN: I have two modes.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:43.570
If I'm passionate
about something,

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:45.260
there's really a 0 and a 1.

00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.200
I'm either off or on.

00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.280
So when I'm on, it's full on.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:52.920
If I'm being told that I
can't accomplish something,

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:56.940
then I'm going to go and
accomplish it whenever I can.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.550
A lot of that is
additional self-motivation,

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:03.210
like that commercial from P&amp;G.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:07.560
But for the most part, I
made a promise to myself

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:12.140
to do things in a certain way,
to achieve certain things.

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:14.360
And I never actually--

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:17.880
it's really one promise that
I never wanted to break.

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:21.780
SPEAKER: With a sport that's
so seemingly individualized,

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:24.060
how do you look at the
teamwork and leadership

00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:27.559
and different pieces to
such a kind of a solo sport?

00:25:27.559 --> 00:25:28.850
AJ EDELMAN: It is a solo sport.

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:32.910
So as I mentioned, skeleton, the
athlete qualifies the country,

00:25:32.910 --> 00:25:35.020
but he's not necessarily
the one to go.

00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:37.710
And so skeleton is very
aggressive in terms

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:42.327
of people needing to
jump places to get

00:25:42.327 --> 00:25:43.410
to where they need to get.

00:25:43.410 --> 00:25:45.900
Because all of us
as Olympic athletes,

00:25:45.900 --> 00:25:52.080
we eat, sleep, and
basically live,

00:25:52.080 --> 00:25:54.564
we breathe, for this
single point four years

00:25:54.564 --> 00:25:56.730
in the future or eight years
in the future, whatever

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:57.540
it might be.

00:25:57.540 --> 00:25:59.085
The Olympics is everything.

00:25:59.085 --> 00:26:04.110
And so you would do almost
anything to get there.

00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:09.030
The decision to sacrifice
potential points for myself

00:26:09.030 --> 00:26:12.420
in order to give Israel a
bigger chance of qualifying

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:16.380
was a really difficult one, but
it was the team aspect of it,

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:18.840
where if you have more people
on the different circuits,

00:26:18.840 --> 00:26:20.560
you can try to
cover those bases.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.190
So even though it
is a solo sport,

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:25.560
as somebody who was
leading our team,

00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:28.530
it was my obligation
to put in a policy that

00:26:28.530 --> 00:26:30.162
would help us as a team.

00:26:30.162 --> 00:26:31.620
SPEAKER: What advice
would you give

00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:33.412
to someone who's looking
to not just become

00:26:33.412 --> 00:26:34.995
maybe the best athlete
in their field,

00:26:34.995 --> 00:26:36.270
but the best in their field.

00:26:38.992 --> 00:26:40.450
AJ EDELMAN: Everybody
is different,

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:45.110
so it's difficult to
dispense very general advice.

00:26:45.110 --> 00:26:52.630
I'd say that if you set out to
actually accomplish something,

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:54.910
then there is--

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:56.680
I always talk to
kids, and I usually

00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:58.900
describe it as, there's is
an opening to your book,

00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.860
there's beginning to your book,
there's a table of contents,

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:04.477
and that table of contents
is not yet written.

00:27:04.477 --> 00:27:05.810
And there's an end to your book.

00:27:05.810 --> 00:27:07.660
And we know how the
story always ends.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:11.480
The story will end either when
we pass on, or when we stop.

00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:11.980
Right?

00:27:11.980 --> 00:27:13.702
And so what happens in between?

00:27:13.702 --> 00:27:15.160
So you get to write
all those pages

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.870
of what happens in between.

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:19.975
So for me, I knew that I
start as a skeleton athlete,

00:27:19.975 --> 00:27:24.100
and I was going to finish when
I retired as a skeleton athlete.

00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:25.750
Was there going to
be a chapter that

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:29.190
was called "Olympic
Games," or was there going

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:31.550
to be a chapter called
"The Decision to Quit."

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.090
And so for me, there
would never be a chapter

00:27:34.090 --> 00:27:36.280
called "The Decision to Quit."

00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:41.440
SPEAKER: So are you trying
to qualify for 2022?

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.700
AJ EDELMAN: I wish.

00:27:42.700 --> 00:27:46.090
No, not actually.

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:49.990
After the Olympics,
I kind of took

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:51.280
stock of where I was in life.

00:27:51.280 --> 00:27:53.270
I realized I was 27 years old.

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:58.720
And there was more
potential for fresh blood

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:02.800
to come in who did have the
components of being a far more

00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:04.430
competitive skeleton athlete.

00:28:04.430 --> 00:28:07.870
And so I shifted my focus to
recruiting a far better athlete

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:09.770
than myself to come
into the program.

00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.680
So thankfully,
after the Olympics,

00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:14.200
we got a lot of interest in
people joining the program.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:17.590
So we have four new athletes
in the program itself,

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.150
and I coach them.

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:21.760
Because when I was
doing the sport,

00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.490
I didn't actually have a coach
who traveled around with me.

00:28:24.490 --> 00:28:26.980
It was one of the
biggest drawbacks

00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.840
to being not part
of a big program

00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:31.670
is I didn't get that
developmental leg up.

00:28:31.670 --> 00:28:33.310
But for the new
athletes in our sport,

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:34.460
I get to act as that coach.

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:37.480
So I video them on
a constant basis.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.790
I'm in touch with them
almost every single day.

00:28:39.790 --> 00:28:41.880
And I'm their liaison to--

00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:44.660
I mean, that has become
my new passion project.

00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.630
SPEAKER: So there are
a lot of Olympians that

00:28:46.630 --> 00:28:49.360
struggle post-athletic career.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:50.830
You're now coaching.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.900
What else are you working
on, and how have you

00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:56.690
kind of approached
the post-Olympic life?

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:01.190
AJ EDELMAN: The post-Olympic
life is a difficult transition,

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:03.880
I think.

00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.790
The effect of coming down
from training every day

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:12.880
and living a mission that
completely defines your life

00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:16.390
is just too difficult
to describe.

00:29:16.390 --> 00:29:21.770
It becomes a really big mental
health problem to tackle.

00:29:21.770 --> 00:29:25.420
So I mean, we call it
the Olympic come down.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:27.550
So after the Olympics,
you're all hyped up.

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:30.910
You've just represented your
country, and now it's all gone.

00:29:30.910 --> 00:29:33.220
Like, to me, as I
described it, it

00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:36.070
felt like if somebody
was a surgeon,

00:29:36.070 --> 00:29:39.860
and somebody had removed their
ability to perform surgery.

00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:44.110
And so I lost my reason
almost for operating.

00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.450
So it's just
difficult to overcome.

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:49.990
And it's a continual effort to
find passions to replace that,

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:51.670
to find opportunity
to replace it.

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:54.010
So mentoring the
new Israeli athletes

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:57.100
and making sure that we have
a continuing Olympic team,

00:29:57.100 --> 00:29:59.320
that's something that
I've been working on.

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.890
Another thing is I'm looking
for a new opportunity in life

00:30:02.890 --> 00:30:04.790
back in tech, or otherwise.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:07.960
So that's where I am right
now, building the Israeli team,

00:30:07.960 --> 00:30:09.797
and finding my next opportunity.

00:30:09.797 --> 00:30:10.630
SPEAKER: As a coach?

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.024
Do you ever get the urge
to go down yourself?

00:30:13.024 --> 00:30:13.690
AJ EDELMAN: Yes.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:14.110
Yeah.

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:14.760
SPEAKER: Every single time?

00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:15.468
AJ EDELMAN: Yeah.

00:30:15.468 --> 00:30:18.117
In fact, I told my
parents couple weeks,

00:30:18.117 --> 00:30:19.200
I was like, OK, that's it.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:20.380
I'm going back to the sport.

00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:22.780
I'm going to do bobsled.

00:30:22.780 --> 00:30:26.050
But you realize
that's just like the--

00:30:26.050 --> 00:30:31.500
that's just the loneliness
of not having sport again.

00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:33.316
That's that talking that.

00:30:33.316 --> 00:30:34.690
You have to make
smart decisions,

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:37.960
and the smart decision is to be
supportive of the new athletes

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:40.840
rather than just
taking a joy ride again

00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.911
for the next four years.

00:30:41.911 --> 00:30:44.410
SPEAKER: And what's the outlook
for the Israeli bobsled team

00:30:44.410 --> 00:30:45.670
in 2022?

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:49.750
AJ EDELMAN: Oh, we have
these four new athletes.

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:54.005
The athlete who competed
alongside me last year,

00:30:54.005 --> 00:30:56.380
he's still doing the program,
he's still doing the sport,

00:30:56.380 --> 00:31:00.640
and he is Israel's hope
for the 2022 games.

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:03.190
The new athletes are
hope for the 2026 games.

00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:06.790
And they're looking incredibly
promising, actually.

00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:09.760
In fact, one is an incredible
100 meter sprinter.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.010
And so we have very
high hopes for him.

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:14.500
I'm also trying to put
together a female bobsled team

00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:17.440
and a female mono
bobsled team, which

00:31:17.440 --> 00:31:18.740
is a very brand new sport.

00:31:18.740 --> 00:31:21.198
Mono bobsled is just a single
person that sits in the sled.

00:31:21.198 --> 00:31:24.340
If mono bobsled had been around
when I was starting this sport,

00:31:24.340 --> 00:31:26.060
I definitely would
have done mono bob.

00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:28.959
But the female
version is now out,

00:31:28.959 --> 00:31:30.250
and so I'm recruiting for that.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.200
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:31:31.200 --> 00:31:32.800
So I do want to open it
up to audience questions.

00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:35.200
We're going to have a
microphone up there, if anybody

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.700
wants to ask one.

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:43.180
While people line up, I have one
kind of fun question for you.

00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:47.260
The Olympic Village is pretty
notorious and pretty famous.

00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:50.860
What's the best
family friendly story

00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:53.860
you can share from your
time in the Olympic Village?

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:56.310
AJ EDELMAN: The
family friendly story.

00:31:56.310 --> 00:32:00.474
So the Olympic Village
is our new homes.

00:32:00.474 --> 00:32:02.140
It's kind of like
living in a dorm room,

00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:04.300
and a pretty packed
dorm room at that.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:06.790
Athletes share each
room with each other.

00:32:06.790 --> 00:32:09.490
There's sometimes three
athletes to a room, sometimes.

00:32:09.490 --> 00:32:11.860
Very rarely does an
athlete get a single room.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:15.250
So we're all in close
quarters, sometimes

00:32:15.250 --> 00:32:17.410
with our heads of teams.

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:21.280
And so if you're working
on your equipment,

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:24.610
you're working on your equipment
basically on your dinner table,

00:32:24.610 --> 00:32:26.590
or where you might eat.

00:32:26.590 --> 00:32:31.600
And so for me, there
was actually a story

00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:33.400
that revolved around my helmet.

00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.940
And my helmet contained
an image of Samson.

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:41.360
And Samson is a religious
figure, so to speak.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.470
And so I was told by
the Olympic Committee

00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:46.480
after I started
training with his helmet

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.690
that I'd have to cover him up.

00:32:48.690 --> 00:32:54.100
It's against the Olympic Charter
to have religious propaganda

00:32:54.100 --> 00:32:54.830
on your person.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:58.780
So I ran around
Pyeongchang, which

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.610
is kind of like
nowheresville, looking

00:33:00.610 --> 00:33:02.516
for a can of spray paint.

00:33:02.516 --> 00:33:04.390
And I couldn't find the
spray paint anywhere,

00:33:04.390 --> 00:33:06.490
and so I traveled
to Gangneung, which

00:33:06.490 --> 00:33:09.280
is miles away where the
figure skaters were living.

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:11.950
I finally found a can of
spray paint, but I then

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:14.460
turned our closet into--

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:17.050
I turned our closet
in our dorm room

00:33:17.050 --> 00:33:20.710
into this very noxious like,
spray painting studio, where

00:33:20.710 --> 00:33:23.980
I was taking my helmet, and I
had a makeshift bandanna on,

00:33:23.980 --> 00:33:25.842
and I taped over, and
I was spray painting

00:33:25.842 --> 00:33:26.800
over this whole helmet.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.330
I never spray painted before.

00:33:28.330 --> 00:33:30.960
But it's something that
all these athletes do,

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.710
where they have to
modify their equipment,

00:33:32.710 --> 00:33:36.290
but they're doing it basically
like, on their tables.

00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:37.310
SPEAKER: Wow.

00:33:37.310 --> 00:33:38.400
Question?

00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.370
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:39.370 --> 00:33:40.120
Thanks for coming.

00:33:40.120 --> 00:33:43.900
So from my experience, I
played like, very high-caliber

00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.550
competitive tennis growing up.

00:33:45.550 --> 00:33:48.160
And so I really related
to your statement

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.470
about it being very individual.

00:33:50.470 --> 00:33:54.010
So I guess my question
is, how did you

00:33:54.010 --> 00:33:58.150
reconcile the whole like,
it's individual and very solo,

00:33:58.150 --> 00:34:00.960
but at the same time,
you're playing in a team,

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:03.790
but you're still trying to
take each other's places,

00:34:03.790 --> 00:34:04.660
in that sense?

00:34:04.660 --> 00:34:07.390
And how did you reconcile
that fact and deal

00:34:07.390 --> 00:34:08.292
with that pressure?

00:34:08.292 --> 00:34:09.500
AJ EDELMAN: It's really hard.

00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.420
It's incredibly
difficult, because when

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:16.360
you compete you're actually
also competing-- as you know,

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.790
you're competing with
them in the same races.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:22.870
So your success comes at
their expense, and vice versa.

00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:31.834
How I personally reconciled it
was that when I started out,

00:34:31.834 --> 00:34:33.000
I started out for a mission.

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.260
And that mission was to
try to accomplish something

00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:38.741
where Israel would get
to the Olympic Games.

00:34:38.741 --> 00:34:40.449
I had to keep that
mission in perspective

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:41.860
that Israel would get
the Olympic Games one

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:42.485
way or another.

00:34:42.485 --> 00:34:46.796
But at the same time, I
believed personally, internally,

00:34:46.796 --> 00:34:48.670
that I was the only
person who could do that.

00:34:52.389 --> 00:34:56.567
When I thought I was going to
quit in 2016, one of the things

00:34:56.567 --> 00:34:58.900
that I had said to myself
when I decided to unquit like,

00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:03.130
five minutes later, was that I'm
the only person who can proudly

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:05.020
represent us in
the way that I want

00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:07.610
us represented in the Olympics.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:09.220
Like, I have to be the one.

00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:11.800
And so I'm going to
support the rest of my team

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:14.614
in trying to get there,
but at the same time,

00:35:14.614 --> 00:35:16.030
I need to be that
standard bearer.

00:35:16.030 --> 00:35:19.480
And so it's difficult
to reconcile.

00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.120
I competed in multiple
races with the person who

00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:23.530
was directly challenging me.

00:35:23.530 --> 00:35:26.830
And so that led to a lot of--
it leads to difficult friction.

00:35:26.830 --> 00:35:29.320
But at the same time, if
you believe internally

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:31.660
that you are the
best suited to do it,

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:35.500
then it actually removes the
component of a them versus you,

00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.380
and makes it a you
versus the field.

00:35:38.380 --> 00:35:40.430
So they just become
part of that field.

00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:43.450
And so if I thought that I
myself was the best, the best

00:35:43.450 --> 00:35:46.591
Israeli, then I was really
just trying to qualify myself

00:35:46.591 --> 00:35:47.590
rather than to beat him.

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:53.100
AUDIENCE: AJ, thanks
for coming in.

00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.770
The main thing I'm wondering
about is the perseverance.

00:35:55.770 --> 00:35:58.380
You mentioned that one time,
that you were especially

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.920
considering dropping out,
but then you got reinspired.

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.970
And so I was just
wondering if kind of there

00:36:05.970 --> 00:36:08.670
were other times where
maybe very frequently,

00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:10.422
you were oscillating about it.

00:36:10.422 --> 00:36:11.880
It just seems very
impressive to me

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:16.110
to maintain a very continued
intensity and belief

00:36:16.110 --> 00:36:17.490
that you can push through.

00:36:23.517 --> 00:36:25.350
AJ EDELMAN: I wanted
to quit multiple times.

00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:27.750
That was a time that I
actually decided to quit.

00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:32.790
So the frequency with which
I suffered minor burnouts

00:36:32.790 --> 00:36:35.010
was quite high, because
the volume that I was doing

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:37.590
and the workload
that I had sustained.

00:36:37.590 --> 00:36:42.240
I think the Olympics
are a measure, not just

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:44.754
of this athletic
success, because there's

00:36:44.754 --> 00:36:46.920
an immense amount of gifted
athletic individuals all

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:47.595
over the world.

00:36:47.595 --> 00:36:50.040
And Lord knows, I'm far
from the most gifted

00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:52.080
athletic individual.

00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:57.990
But most of qualifying for
the Olympics, I believe,

00:36:57.990 --> 00:37:01.410
is that it's like
this unbroken belief

00:37:01.410 --> 00:37:03.250
that you can accomplish it.

00:37:03.250 --> 00:37:06.300
And so, every time
that I wanted to quit--

00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:07.530
it was really quite often.

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:09.510
It was a few times
per season, usually

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:14.880
if there was like a bad injury,
or a bad result. Then it

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.830
simply--

00:37:16.830 --> 00:37:20.140
it required, as I
mentioned before,

00:37:20.140 --> 00:37:23.540
the belief that I was the
only one who could do this.

00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.150
And so if I was the only
one who could do it,

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:29.400
then I was removing the
ability of Israel to qualify.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.290
I was actually taking
that away from them.

00:37:31.290 --> 00:37:32.956
I'd promised them
that I would give them

00:37:32.956 --> 00:37:36.990
that ability four years
before, two years before.

00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:40.650
But if I pulled out, it
would be like stealing.

00:37:40.650 --> 00:37:43.660
And so, I stealing my potential,
I was stealing their potential.

00:37:43.660 --> 00:37:47.400
And that's pretty much
how I kept from straying

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:50.160
too far into the quit mindset.

00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.010
SPEAKER: Any other questions?

00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:56.260
I have one more I want to ask.

00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:58.030
If you were going to be
in the summer Olympics,

00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:59.380
what sport would you
want to participate in?

00:37:59.380 --> 00:38:00.230
AJ EDELMAN: Weightlifting.

00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.490
SPEAKER: Weightlifting.

00:38:00.490 --> 00:38:00.750
AJ EDELMAN: Yeah.

00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:01.670
I love weightlifting.

00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:05.260
Lifting big things
is like, so much fun.

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:06.900
Part of our training is--

00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:08.722
so our training is
actually-- it consists

00:38:08.722 --> 00:38:10.180
during the summer--
a lot of people

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:11.719
ask how we train
during the summer.

00:38:11.719 --> 00:38:13.510
During the summer,
there's no ice anywhere.

00:38:13.510 --> 00:38:17.290
And you can only train in
skeleton on a skeleton on ice

00:38:17.290 --> 00:38:18.406
at a bobsled track.

00:38:18.406 --> 00:38:19.780
And bobsled tracks
are only built

00:38:19.780 --> 00:38:21.738
in places that have hosted
the Olympics before,

00:38:21.738 --> 00:38:23.860
because nobody wants to
build this $300 million

00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:27.940
waste of wasted concrete.

00:38:27.940 --> 00:38:31.364
And so during the summer, all
we do is we lift and we sprint.

00:38:31.364 --> 00:38:33.280
And so we do these Olympic
lifts, these cleans

00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.160
and snatches, and that develops
explosive hip movements,

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.030
and we sprint.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:40.240
And so I spent an
immense amount of time

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:42.550
in the gym just doing
this weightlifting.

00:38:42.550 --> 00:38:44.622
And at first, I was
actually really bad at it.

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:45.850
I didn't know how to clean.

00:38:45.850 --> 00:38:48.310
So it looked like, you know,
every time the bar would

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:51.580
go over the head, I actually
wouldn't be able to hold it.

00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:53.380
And so it'd fall back,
and I'd fall back.

00:38:53.380 --> 00:38:55.780
And it looked quite pathetic.

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:59.680
But over time, over
a lot of repetition,

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.250
it became quite second nature.

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:02.800
And so I thought
like, if I was going

00:39:02.800 --> 00:39:04.716
to do another Olympic
sport, it would probably

00:39:04.716 --> 00:39:05.522
be weightlifting.

00:39:10.830 --> 00:39:14.330
AUDIENCE: Thank you so
much for the stories.

00:39:17.305 --> 00:39:20.950
Really inspiring.

00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:25.085
I'm originally from Jamaica, so
thanks for the "Cool Runnings."

00:39:25.085 --> 00:39:26.980
AJ EDELMAN: I actually
trained in Jamaica.

00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:27.813
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:39:27.813 --> 00:39:30.290
We have to talk about that.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:33.790
But two things are
really impressive.

00:39:33.790 --> 00:39:36.730
Your ability to
set really stretch

00:39:36.730 --> 00:39:38.980
goals, like I'm
struggling in school,

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:42.520
so I'm going to get into MIT.

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:43.600
Or I'm overweight.

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.570
I'm going to become an Olympian.

00:39:45.570 --> 00:39:46.750
Like, how do you do that?

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:49.240
Those are really,
really strong goals.

00:39:49.240 --> 00:39:56.457
And the other question is I know
the ad, and it's very powerful.

00:39:56.457 --> 00:39:58.540
And if you could speak a
little bit about the role

00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:00.700
your parents played
in your experience?

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:00.820
AJ EDELMAN: Yeah, of course.

00:40:00.820 --> 00:40:02.560
My parents are
actually here today.

00:40:02.560 --> 00:40:04.396
[APPLAUSE]

00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:08.710
So a couple of--

00:40:08.710 --> 00:40:11.540
so I'll speak in order
of how you asked it.

00:40:11.540 --> 00:40:14.380
But I'll actually touch on the
"Cool Runnings" thing first.

00:40:17.200 --> 00:40:19.690
Every year was a
challenge to figure out

00:40:19.690 --> 00:40:21.910
where I was going to
spend my time training.

00:40:21.910 --> 00:40:24.170
And there was multiple options.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:27.250
I could train in
Israel, which had

00:40:27.250 --> 00:40:30.490
the advantage of being close
to my homeland, and very close

00:40:30.490 --> 00:40:31.880
to the mission at hand.

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:35.290
But in the final summer, when
it looked like it would be

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:36.700
an incredibly difficult push--

00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.240
I didn't know whether I was
going to make the Games at all

00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.031
during that summer.

00:40:39.031 --> 00:40:41.890
In fact, it looked
pretty doubtful.

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:45.220
And so I thought,
much in line with what

00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.010
you mentioned of
stretching goals,

00:40:47.010 --> 00:40:49.300
I thought what is the craziest--

00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:51.710
who are the craziest best
sprinters in the world?

00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:54.210
Now, the craziest best sprinters
in the world are Jamaicans.

00:40:54.210 --> 00:40:57.670
So certainly if I go
to Jamaica and learn

00:40:57.670 --> 00:41:00.670
from a Jamaican coach, they
have some tips and tricks

00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:02.440
to teach somebody
who has absolutely

00:41:02.440 --> 00:41:05.060
no skill at sprinting how
to be a good sprinter.

00:41:05.060 --> 00:41:05.560
Right?

00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:09.040
So I hooked up with my
Jamaican bobsled friends.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.231
And I said, do you
guys have a good coach?

00:41:11.231 --> 00:41:12.730
Like, do you have
a coach somewhere?

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:14.650
And they said, (JAMAICAN
ACCENT) yeah, man.

00:41:14.650 --> 00:41:15.330
Sorry.

00:41:15.330 --> 00:41:17.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.320
Yes, man.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.340
We can hook you up with this guy
in Spanish Town, right outside

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:25.480
of Kingston.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.810
And you'll stay with him.

00:41:26.810 --> 00:41:28.020
He's a great coach.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.470
And so I did.

00:41:29.470 --> 00:41:31.210
I went down there, I trained.

00:41:31.210 --> 00:41:35.050
And it was actually an
incredibly difficult summer

00:41:35.050 --> 00:41:38.160
for me, because on top of
the heat, a lot of times,

00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:39.160
we lacked running water.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:45.710
And Spanish Town is not
the safest place for me.

00:41:45.710 --> 00:41:48.100
But it was an
incredible experience.

00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:53.284
Speaking to why going to the
extremes, I feel that if--

00:41:55.969 --> 00:41:57.760
in engineering, you
guys are all engineers,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.960
so you know boundary conditions.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:41:59.530
Right?

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:02.800
So for me, it was about testing
ranges and boundary conditions.

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.520
I wanted to always
go to the extreme.

00:42:04.520 --> 00:42:06.440
If I wanted to do
something, I wanted to do it

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.460
to the utmost, best ability.

00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.260
And so there was no point
doing anything other than that.

00:42:13.260 --> 00:42:15.700
I don't think anybody starts
out and says, you know what?

00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:21.220
I want to be the 35,000th ranked
chess player in the world.

00:42:21.220 --> 00:42:23.272
They want to be the best, right?

00:42:23.272 --> 00:42:25.480
In the meantime, they'll
settle in at a certain rank,

00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.688
but they want to be the best.

00:42:26.688 --> 00:42:30.190
So for me, if I wasn't doing--

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:31.897
if I didn't have
any academic goals,

00:42:31.897 --> 00:42:33.480
what was the number
one academic goal?

00:42:33.480 --> 00:42:34.570
Get into MIT.

00:42:34.570 --> 00:42:36.700
If I wanted to be
accomplished in sport,

00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:38.290
the number one
way to do that was

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:41.140
by going to the Olympic Games.

00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:44.890
In terms of my parents,
who supported me,

00:42:44.890 --> 00:42:47.240
they supported me
in multiple ways.

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.050
The first is emotional.

00:42:50.050 --> 00:42:53.290
They were incredibly
supportive of the journey.

00:42:53.290 --> 00:42:55.930
I think it's very
difficult for parents

00:42:55.930 --> 00:42:59.380
who know their child
has the potential

00:42:59.380 --> 00:43:01.150
to accomplish
something in a more

00:43:01.150 --> 00:43:03.164
established industry,
and something

00:43:03.164 --> 00:43:04.080
a little more certain.

00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:11.650
Certainly, they didn't know
when I started my time at MIT

00:43:11.650 --> 00:43:14.740
that, after
graduating from MIT, I

00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:16.840
would actually just drop
everything and go and do

00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.930
sports.

00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:19.300
And so I think it came as
a bit of a shock to them,

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.190
but they were incredibly
supportive of it.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:23.740
And so that I appreciate
their support every day.

00:43:23.740 --> 00:43:25.360
It was incredible.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:29.350
Number two was, when I cut
the supply line to Oracle--

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:33.150
this was one of the extremes
that I did when I left Oracle.

00:43:33.150 --> 00:43:36.367
When I decide to stay in
the sport and to make 2018,

00:43:36.367 --> 00:43:38.200
the number one way of
doing that, I thought,

00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:42.310
was cutting off all lifelines
to my previous life.

00:43:42.310 --> 00:43:45.370
Whereas during that
season, I always

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.050
thought, well, if
this doesn't work out,

00:43:47.050 --> 00:43:50.320
I can go back to a really nice
salary and a very comfortable

00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:51.205
living in California.

00:43:51.205 --> 00:43:52.330
Like, it's available to me.

00:43:52.330 --> 00:43:53.080
The job's there.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.410
Supposed to go back
there that summer.

00:43:56.410 --> 00:44:00.100
When I decided to
not quit, I thought

00:44:00.100 --> 00:44:02.200
that the number one
way to stay on track

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.860
was not by completely
burning the bridge,

00:44:05.860 --> 00:44:08.670
but removing that potential.

00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:11.760
I could no longer
go back to that job.

00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:15.730
And so that involved
removing a source of income.

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:19.000
And so skeleton
is very expensive.

00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.217
And thankfully, my
parents helped support me

00:44:24.217 --> 00:44:25.300
on the rest of my journey.

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:28.300
And without them, I wouldn't
have been able to afford it.

00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.751
But I'm incredibly
thankful to them.

00:44:30.751 --> 00:44:31.750
They played a huge part.

00:44:34.495 --> 00:44:36.370
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
sharing your experience.

00:44:36.370 --> 00:44:41.790
Could you talk about the role of
religion in your Olympic story,

00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:45.322
and how did that play on
a day to day business?

00:44:45.322 --> 00:44:46.030
AJ EDELMAN: Sure.

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:52.150
Religion defined who
I was as an athlete,

00:44:52.150 --> 00:44:55.370
because I was competing
on behalf of a community.

00:44:55.370 --> 00:45:01.000
So one of the things that I
learned early on from somebody

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.570
who is a sports psychologist
was that you need to center

00:45:04.570 --> 00:45:06.330
yourself before a competition.

00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.900
So you need to always go
back to a specific markers,

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.550
so that you know where you are.

00:45:10.550 --> 00:45:13.580
And so that to me was a
saying, it was a mantra.

00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:16.610
And so the mantra I came up with
was for myself, for my people,

00:45:16.610 --> 00:45:17.940
and for my country.

00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.890
So I was representing
the country of Israel,

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:25.980
but I was representing
the people of Israel,

00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:28.640
the Jewish people, as well as--

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.310
there are non-Jewish Israelis.

00:45:30.310 --> 00:45:31.310
I was representing them.

00:45:31.310 --> 00:45:34.070
But I wore a kippah.

00:45:34.070 --> 00:45:37.820
Everywhere I went,
I wore a kippah.

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.680
When the directive
came-- a few years ago,

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:44.030
the directive came from the
Israeli security personnel--

00:45:44.030 --> 00:45:45.805
that the guidelines
for Israeli athletes--

00:45:45.805 --> 00:45:47.930
because it was quite
dangerous for Israeli athletes

00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:51.620
to travel, especially in Europe
while wearing Israeli gear,

00:45:51.620 --> 00:45:55.190
that we were not to travel
outside of competition venue

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:57.980
with markings of
an Israeli athlete,

00:45:57.980 --> 00:46:00.840
including potentially kippot.

00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:02.290
So this a kippah.

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:09.140
And so, instead of
actually removing that,

00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:12.950
I went to the extreme and
ordered a full kit of gear,

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:16.010
of a shirt that said Israeli
Bobsled and Skeleton Team,

00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:18.316
pants which said Israeli
Bobsled and Skeleton Team,

00:46:18.316 --> 00:46:20.690
and jackets which said Israeli
Bobsled and Skeleton Team.

00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:23.130
That way, every time I was
walking around on a plane,

00:46:23.130 --> 00:46:24.380
it would start a conversation.

00:46:24.380 --> 00:46:26.300
Oh, Israel has a bobsled
and skeleton team?

00:46:26.300 --> 00:46:30.420
So that, to me, it was a
central part of my identity.

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:33.989
And it helped
motivate me further.

00:46:33.989 --> 00:46:36.157
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:36.157 --> 00:46:37.990
SPEAKER: Well, AJ, thank
you for being here.

00:46:37.990 --> 00:46:39.448
Let's give him a
round of applause.

00:46:39.448 --> 00:46:42.520
[APPLAUSE]
