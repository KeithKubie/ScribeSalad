00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.630
 

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.100
We already know that
2 to the fourth power

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.200
can be viewed as
starting with a 1

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.450
and then multiplying
it by 2 four times.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:12.300
So let me do that.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.100
So times 2, times
2, times 2, times 2.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.010
And that will give us, let's
see, 2 times 2 is 4, 8, 16.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.220
So that will give us 16.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.080
Now I will ask you a more
interesting question.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:33.080
What do you think 2 to
the negative 4 power is?

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.659
And I encourage you to pause
the video and think about that.

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:39.450
Well, you might be
tempted to say, oh maybe

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.370
it's negative 16 or
something like that,

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.929
but remember what the exponent
operation is trying to do.

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:46.720
One way of viewing it
is this is telling us

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.770
how many times are we going to
multiply 2 times negative 1?

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.790
But here we're going to
multiply negative 4 times.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.850
Well, what does negative
traditionally mean?

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.190
Negative traditionally
means the opposite.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.840
So here this is how many times
you're going to multiply.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.640
Maybe when we make it
negative this says,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.306
how many times are
we going to, starting

00:01:04.306 --> 00:01:08.474
with the 1, how many times
are we going to divide by 2?

00:01:08.474 --> 00:01:10.140
So let's think about
that a little bit.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.040
So this could be
viewed as 1 times,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.580
and we're going to
divide by 2 four times.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.210
Well, dividing by 2 is the same
thing as multiplying by 1/2.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:25.090
So we could say that
this is 1 times 1/2,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.930
times-- let me just
do it in one color.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.000
So 1 times 1/2, times
1/2, times 1/2, times 1/2.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.960
Notice multiplying
by 1/2 four times

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.000
is the exact same thing as
dividing by 2 four times.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.010
And in this situation
this would get you,

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.820
well 1/2, well 1 times 1/2 half
is just 1/2, times 1/2 is 1/4,

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.200
times 1/2 is 1/8,
times 1/2 is 1/16.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.484
And so you probably see
the relationship here.

00:01:54.484 --> 00:01:56.900
If you're-- this is essentially
you're starting with the 1

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.310
and you're dividing
by 2 four times.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.160
You could also say that 2-- I'm
going to do the same colors-- 2

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:14.150
to the negative 4 is
the same thing as 1/2

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.110
to the fourth power.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.060
 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.730
Let me color code
it nicely so you

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.700
realize what the
negative is doing.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.117
So this negative
right over here--

00:02:23.117 --> 00:02:24.491
let me do that in
a better color,

00:02:24.491 --> 00:02:26.537
I'll do it in magenta,
something that jumps out.

00:02:26.537 --> 00:02:28.120
So this negative
right over here, this

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.680
is what's causing
us to go one over.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.750
So 2 to the negative
4 is the same thing,

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.590
based on the way we've
defined it just up right here,

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.320
as reciprocal of 2 to
the fourth, or 1 over 2

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:44.330
to the fourth.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.922
And so you could view this as
being 1/2 times 2 times 2 times

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:53.380
2, if you just view
2 to the fourth

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.470
as taking four 2's
and multiplying them.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.240
Or if you use this
idea right over here,

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.710
you could view it
as starting with a 1

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:02.770
and multiplying it
by 2 four times.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.270
Either way, you are
going to get 1/16.

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:10.440
 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.310
So let's do a few
more examples of this

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.290
just so that we make sure
things are clear to us.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:24.347
So let's try 3 to the
negative third power.

00:03:24.347 --> 00:03:26.180
So remember, whenever
you see that negative,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.693
what my brain
always does is say I

00:03:27.693 --> 00:03:29.200
need to take the
reciprocal here.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.200
So this is going
to be equal to, I'm

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.180
going to highlight
the negative again,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.700
this is going to be 1
over 3 to the third power.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.800
 

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:47.520
Which would be equal to 1/3
times 3 times 3, or 1 times

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.760
3 times 3 times 3,
is going to be 27.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.280
So this is going to be 1/27.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.150
Let's try another example,
I'll do two or three more.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.280
So let's take a negative number
to a negative exponent, just

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.350
to see if we can
confuse ourselves.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.457
So let's take the
number negative 4,

00:04:07.457 --> 00:04:10.040
and let's take it-- I don't want
my numbers to get too big too

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.540
fast.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:16.279
So let's just take
negative 2 and let's

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:20.290
take it to the negative 3 power.

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:23.840
I'll make my negatives in
magenta, negative 3 power.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.200
 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.750
So at first this
might be daunting,

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.750
do the negatives cancel?

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.770
And that will just be the
remnants in your brain

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.980
that are trying to think
of multiplying negatives.

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.640
Do not apply that here.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:39.590
Remember, you see a
negative exponent,

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.230
that just means the reciprocal
of the positive exponent.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:49.670
So 1 over negative 2
to the third power,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.600
to the positive third power.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:59.370
And this is equal to 1
over negative 2 times

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.640
negative 2 times negative 2.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.980
Or you could view it as
1 times negative 2 times

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.850
negative 2 times
negative 2, which

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.500
is going to give you 1 over
negative 8 or negative 1/8.

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:14.935
Let me scroll over
a little bit, I

00:05:14.935 --> 00:05:16.810
don't want to have to
start squishing things.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.850
So this is equal
to negative 1/8.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:21.860
Let's do one more example,
just in an attempt

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.750
to confuse ourselves.

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:42.320
Let's take 5/8 and raise
this to the negative 2 power.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:44.490
So once again, this negative,
oh I got at a fraction

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:45.290
is a negative here.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:49.900
Remember this just means 1
over 5/8 to the second power.

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.080
So this is just going
to be the same thing

00:05:52.080 --> 00:06:03.630
as 1 over 5/8 squared,
which is going

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:09.230
to be the same thing-- so this
is going to be equal to-- I'm

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:14.173
trying to color code it, 1 over
5/8 times 5/8, which is 25/64.

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:18.890
 

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.100
1 over 25/64 is just
going to be 64/25.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.630
 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.070
So another way to
think about it is,

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:29.320
you're going to take
the reciprocal of this

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:33.010
and raise it to the
positive exponent.

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.940
So another way you could
have thought about this

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:39.900
is 5/8 to the negative 2 power.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.090
Let me just take the
reciprocal of this, 8/5

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.670
and raise it to the
positive 2 power.

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:48.660
So all of these
statements are equivalent.

00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:50.201
And that would have
applied even when

00:06:50.201 --> 00:06:52.260
you're dealing with
non-fractions as your base

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:53.460
right over here.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.410
So 2, you could say well this
is going to be the same thing.

00:06:56.410 --> 00:06:57.840
2 to the negative
4 is going to be

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.579
the same thing as
taking my reciprocal.

00:07:00.579 --> 00:07:02.120
So this is going to
be the same thing

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.600
as taking the reciprocal
of 2, which is 1/2

00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.271
and raising it to
the positive 4 power.

00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:13.771
