00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.230
Getting the costume right is an integral part
of any comic book film.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.299
As we all know by now, fans will painstakingly
dissect each and every component of the suit

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:15.719
to ensure that it’s up to par.

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.200
The reaction to a superhero’s outfit could
make or break the movie before it’s even

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.200
released.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.090
And sometimes, the one seen in the final product
isn’t even the first design.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.930
As creators search for an iconic look for
their characters, they go through several

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.840
variations, some of which could have been
a disaster.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.610
Here are 10 most WTF unused superhero costumes
of all-time.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.610
Batman

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.480
Just about everything about Batman is ingrained
in pop culture.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.370
This of course includes the famous Batsuit,
which is meant to inspire fear in the hearts

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.920
of Gotham City criminals.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.410
But originally, the Dark Knight was going
to have a very different appearance.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.970
Co-creator Bob Kane presented Bill Finger
with one possibility, which saw Bruce Wayne

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.780
wearing a red leotard, two large wings, and
a typical “domino” mask instead of a cape

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.910
and cowl.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.470
Fortunately for everyone, Finger vetoed the
design and the one agreed upon is the one

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.339
viewers are still familiar with today.

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.950
Deadpool

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.070
After Fox screwed up Deadpool in X-Men: Origins
Wolverine, the filmmakers got a mulligan to

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.729
do the Merc With a Mouth justice.

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.030
The Deadpool solo movie features one of the
most page accurate costumes to date, but there’s

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.690
an alternate reality where fans didn’t get
to see it.

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.130
During the conceptual stage, artists designed
numerous suits for Wade Wilson, including

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.490
one that looked like a Jason Vorhees rip-off.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.760
Luckily, star Ryan Reynolds and director Tim
Miller were committed to getting everything

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.670
about the beloved character “right” for
the film, and the results paid off handsomely.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:39.330
If they went with something else, maybe the
movie doesn’t break records.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.170
Alien TMNT

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.220
When Michael Bay signed on to produce a Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles reboot, fans feared for

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.250
the worse, and the rumor mill didn’t do
much to calm them down.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.960
It was reported that the heroes in a half
shell would be aliens instead of the traditional

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.280
turtles, an unforgivable alteration of the
source material.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.180
Bay claimed that was false, but concept art
suggests otherwise.

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.869
In it, the Ninja Turtles appear extraterrestrial
in nature, resembling the stereotypical “green

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.110
man” alien with a turtle shell on the back.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.509
The Turtles’ actual design in the films
stirred up some controversy, but it’s worth

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.560
remembering that it could have been a lot
worse.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.390
Tech Spider-Man

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.431
Spider-Man has one of the most recognizable
costumes in all of comics, so filmmakers have

00:02:16.431 --> 00:02:18.920
a pretty good idea of what they have to stick
to for the movies.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.340
Sam Raimi’s trilogy featured a nice interpretation,
as did the Amazing Spider-Man reboot.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.200
But for the sequel, potential redesigns were
considered.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.340
One looked like something Spider-Man 2099
would wear, appearing futuristic.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.270
The overuse of blue is definitely a contrast
from the familiar color scheme, and the thin

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.840
spider logo across the front is barely noticeable.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.510
Not to mention, the eyes look robotic.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.880
Tom Holland’s Spidey is getting some tech
upgrades from Tony Stark, but nothing like

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.020
this.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.020
Colossus

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.629
Deadpool didn’t have too many X-Men cross
over into his solo film, but one main player

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:53.290
was Colossus, who was designed to be more
loyal to the comics than the versions seen

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.750
in previous movies.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.840
Fans were appreciative of this, but they would
have had a completely different reaction if

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.160
another version was used.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.200
The initial look from the earlier X-Men films
was meant to be carried over into Deadpool,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.660
giving the sleek Colossus a hood to make him
look cooler than ever before.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.840
Renderings of this highlights an unfortunate
comparison to Anakin Skywalker from Revenge

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.019
of the Sith, so luckily this was scrapped
for what we saw in the final product.

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.190
Superman Lives

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.269
Christopher Reeve, Brandon Routh, and now
Henry Cavill all definitely look the part

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.290
of Superman in their respective films.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.560
The Man of Steel could have gone down a bizarro
path if the planned reboot Superman Lives

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.950
had ever come into fruition.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:35.150
The story is infamous by now; none other than
Nicolas Cage was cast as Clark Kent, and he

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.840
got as far as costume testing.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.959
The suit was… different to say the least.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:44.800
It appeared to be made out of shiny plastic
and the iconic “S” on the chest was squished

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:45.800
up.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.629
It was a far cry from anything we’ve seen
on-screen to date and as much fun as it would

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.629
have been to see Cage playing Superman, we’re
happy this didn’t become a reality.

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:54.629
Falcon

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.040
Each installment of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
adds to the franchise’s vast roster of characters,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.180
and one new inclusion featured in Captain
America: The Winter Soldier was Falcon.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.320
For modern film audiences, his costume had
to be upgraded to be more mechanical and “Iron

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.410
Man like,” but it still maintained the general
appearance of a Falcon, complete with wings.

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.349
Initially, Sam Wilson was going to resemble
a plane more than a bird.

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:19.410
Concept art shows one variation that make
Falcon look like a fighter jet, which definitely

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:21.180
would have rubbed fans the wrong way.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.169
Even with the charismatic Anthony Mackie,
it would have been hard to make this seem

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.169
convincing.

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.379
Batman: Year One

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:30.789
Before Christopher Nolan got the keys to the
Batmobile, Darren Aronofsky was set to be

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.599
the auteur to bring Batman back to respectability.

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:37.379
His take on the property would have been very
unique, with a street orphan Bruce befriending

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.389
a mechanic named “Little Al.”

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:43.249
The director had his own idea for Batman’s
costume as well, and illustrations of it suggest

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:45.800
something like Victorian era steam punk.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.539
While they do resemble the traditional Batman
outfit somewhat, there are enough variations

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:53.389
– namely in the ears, neck, and utility
belt – that make it seem like an odd fit

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.389
for the screen.

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.180
Sometimes, you can’t mess with the classics.

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.180
Black Panther

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.180
T’Challa is a reserved and stoic leader,
and his simple suit is the ideal reflection

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.180
of that personality.

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.879
It’s so efficient that comics writers have
seen little reason to change it over the years,

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.889
and the appearance has generally stayed the
same since the character’s inception.

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.770
The original design for his costume could
not have been more of a polar opposite, with

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:18.830
bright yellow and red colors, an elaborate
cape, and even a “T” logo on his torso.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.219
It seems like something that’s totally out
of place and thankfully was changed before

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:23.389
the first comic was published.

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:28.120
Can you imagine this during the airport scene
in Civil War?

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.219
Tim Burton’s Robin

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.389
Before Tim Burton was removed from Batman
Forever, he did some pre-production work,

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:36.050
including figuring out a look for the Boy
Wonder, Robin.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.719
As one would expect, Burton had a different
idea from Joel Schumacher, something that

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:42.309
was grounded in realism and resembled riot
gear.

00:05:42.309 --> 00:05:46.389
The outfit doesn’t look half bad, but certain
elements raise and eyebrow or two.

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:50.219
Robin’s hairstyle seems to be pulled right
from Wolverine and his mask is too close to

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:52.009
the comics version of Scarlet Witch.

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.589
There’s no denying this seems weird, but
we have to admit, we’d take this over Bat

00:05:56.589 --> 00:05:58.680
nipples any day of the week.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.020
Those are our picks for some curious superhero
designs that were fortunately unused.

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:04.210
Are there any we missed?

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:07.819
