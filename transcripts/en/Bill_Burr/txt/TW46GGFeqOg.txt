Speaker 1:          00:00:01       Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr. It's time for the Monday morning podcast from Monday, May 2nd, 2016 and I know, I always make that joke like, oh my God, where is the year going? But seriously guys, seriously, where the fuck is this year going? What the fuck? May 2nd already may fucking second. But getting ready for the summer. Um, and the meg, I'm psyched. I'm psyched that we're into may cause may means we're closer to the middle of July and in the middle of the Jill of July I will be done writing, you know, helping to write the second season of f is for family and then I'm free. Not really, but sort of and uh, I'll have two weeks off and then I'll freckles. Rumor has it is going to be doing a, doing a nice run through Europe. So, uh, which you might may or may not start in Ireland. It's all a sort of loose at this point. But uh, we're slugging it out and um, I'm actually feeling much better by the way. Thank you for not asking with my Psi Attica. Sayada can, it sounds like a fucking speed metal band, you know, not a good one though, right?

Speaker 2:          00:01:16       Come see my band cy Attica. We're going to be down at the ground round on a Wednesday night. Okay. Yeah, I'll definitely see it. All right, so like you think maybe you could like bring some people, hey, you know, I'm going to do what I can. All right, so is that like, I definitely put you down

Speaker 1:          00:01:32       dude. Fuck off. I'm, I'll, I'll, if I get there, I'll get there. All right bro. Chill. Um, Shai Attica. I'm sorry. I actually, I got some, I found some new stretches. I found this fucking guy on a, on youtube, this doctor who is just sitting on a yoga mat, one of these fucking new agey guys, you know what I mean? One of those guys that's like straight, but we're still makes you uncomfortable. You know those, you know those straight guys? Like it's straight up. Gay Guy is not uncomfortable to be around, but there's a certain kind of straight guy that's coming off like he's gay, but he's straight. That is the most uncomfortable male to be around. I don't know why. You know what I mean? It's almost like they got in between the teeth and you just can't even hear what the fuck they're saying. Do you want to be like, could you just go and get the fuck Outta here so I can listen to you? Is there a word for that? The Gay Straight Guy. Um, yeah, Bill, it's called the gay guy in clock in, in the, in the closet. Well maybe it isn't some, some guys are just, uh, some guys are just a feminine.

Speaker 3:          00:02:39       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:40       Some guys just stand there and gym classes. One person after another,

Speaker 3:          00:02:44       yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:02:45       Is called to be on the team or to stereotype. Right. This gay athletes was that guy who played on a, the big 12 there in Missouri and then he went to a, that football team and then he got cut. There must have been hard to cut him. Right. All right. How bad is this guy? You have to suck before we won't get accused of being homophobic when we kind of, you know, that's always in the air, but that's not what I wanted to talk about. I'm here to talk about siren at Chi, but Worcester Centrum, um, turns out my hamstring was fucked up so I was doing like the touch your toe stretches, which is the exact opposite thing that you want to do because the nerve is like pinched or inflamed and you're just like, you're, you're, you're not stretching it out. It, I guess you stretch the muscles really, so whatever.

Speaker 1:          00:03:31       And usually yet, I don't know, stretches around the nerve. I have no idea. I'd never even heard of this fucking thing until I had this problem and God knows I didn't take any anatomy classes. So, um, I think when you don't have a nerve issue, you can then do that Ben. Cause well, what you're stretching really is just your muscle, your muscle fiber, the muscle tissue. Um, and the nerves are just sort of chilling around it. But when it gets pinched between the, the fucking interior crucial ligament of the lower fucking vertebrate tailbone, whatever the fuck it is all in, I was like, fuck it. Fucking pulling a balloon. Um, uninflated balloon. I have no fucking analogy. I don't know what Ellie I know is it hurts. So I put this guy on this hippy guy and he was just like, yeah man, what's she actually want to do is you don't they, there's certain stretches did you want, did you and your certain stretches that you don't want to do and you know, we're in an age right now.

Speaker 1:          00:04:26       It's, I'm so fucking impatient. I was trying to skip ahead by just had to sit there, you know, everything I could do just to get through a nine minute video. It's only nine minutes out of my day, but there's like a flat screen TV with NBA and Nhl playoffs going on. I got other videos I can click on. You know, as I'm sitting there trying to listen to this guy, I'm also looking at all the videos on the right, you know, there's free porn, there's all kinds of shit in this guy is just sitting there going, you know, okay, could, could stretch it. You want to do is is actually, if you should sit down on your buttocks, make sure your weight is on your, your pelvic bones. And it was just, it was driving me fucking insane, but whatever. I ended up doing the stretches and I, and I definitely feel better. So, um, thanks to that guy, whatever his fucking name is and I will definitely be posting those in case anybody else has that problem. If you just sitting down in a chair and like your feet go numb and shit, you could possibly have what I have.

Speaker 1:          00:05:29       Oh, you got a big dog sitting in your lap, one or the other. I have no fucking idea, but I'm just happy that it, uh, that it feels better. And um, I got to tell you all these fucking aches and pains that I'm having. I knew this a long time ago. There's nothing better than stretching now that I've gone out and I bought all this fucking rogue fitness shit. Um, you know, to lift weights and all the atomic grips and all that shit to do the a Ninja warrior stuff. The best thing I could be doing all that shit. That shit's all gonna be great. Provided I fucking stretch. But, um, I dunno. I wish I knew way, way, way, way fucking back in the day to stretch. There was no stretching in the 80s he went to Gold's gym. You just did the old, you know you did the stretch you did before you started lifting and Gold's gym back in the 80s you remember fucking Chevy Chase when he's about ready to jump in the pool of Christie Brinkley where he's going.

Speaker 1:          00:06:27       This is crazy. This is crazy. This is crazy. You know he's moving his fucking, that's what you did. You did a couple of those and then he did like, you stuck your arm to the side and you did those fucking, you know, touch your left hand or your right toe and up and down, you know, one to fucking those military things. One, two, three, four. Ah, Love Marine Corp you do on that shit, right without stretching and then you would just fucking work out. I fucked up myself so much. Fucked up my tricep. I tore a peck, you know, you know, it's funny. All of this shit's going to come back to haunt me the next time I lose my fucking eye. Health insurance is someone just listening to this podcast and list everything that I'm talking about is some sort of preexisting condition.

Speaker 4:          00:07:08       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:07:10       You know, you probably go home, Bill, you're doing well. How do you keep losing your health insurance? Well, because you'd do an acting gig. They pay you one time and then they start sending your residual checks for like a dollar 35 and you have to make 10 grand a year minimum to keep your, uh, every single year. You've got to make it. You got to make that or something like that to keep your fucking sag after fucking health insurance. And uh, you know, if one year goes by and you're writing a show, rather than being on the show, you fucking lose your a, you end up losing. I mean, I do anyways. I haven't done it

Speaker 4:          00:07:42       enough. Uh, you know,

Speaker 1:          00:07:45       I haven't done enough act work, I guess. You know, you'd think with 58 fast and furious, 47 Friday the 13th you'd think I could catch on enough to make 10 grand a year. You know what? I'm blaming the fuck it after. Sag Health, health insurance. I think I got to take this. Why? I've gotta take this one myself. I got to look myself in the fucking mirror and be like, you know what bill? It's your goddamn faults. Your own fucking fault. Not you just go out and get blue cross blue shield. That's what I should do and I should just walk away from sag after. Right. I don't fucking know. I'm a big advocate of that. You know, looking yourself in the mirror and being like, all right, you fucked up. As opposed to being like, you know, the world is unfair, which everybody knows it is.

Speaker 1:          00:08:29       Right. But if you say, all right, I fucked up and it actually gives you an option to be, okay, what can I do to lessen the fuck up? Because I know I'm going to fuck up again. You know, like if you're like Caitlyn Jenner right now, rather than fucking filming yourself taking a Piss and Trump's tower, you know, why don't you just look yourself in the mirror and be like, all right, how did I fuck this up? You know, for the first 66 years of my life, I had a definitive bathroom to go into. There wasn't any questions, nor did I have to fill myself. And then afterwards say, I didn't molest anybody. What has happened to that person? You know, that, that, that, that person is absolutely lost their fucking mind. Who's walking around filming themselves, taking a Piss and then talking about child molesters. And I know what people were saying, Oh, you can't have these fucking a former guys with boobs now they have, you know, if you know that transitioning people, they'd get a fucking molests somebody, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I know that that's what that whole fucking thing was supposed to be about. But you know,

Speaker 1:          00:09:31       I dunno, that just came off to me is shameless self promotion. I don't have anything against transgendered people, but that's fucking Ding Bat.

Speaker 1:          00:09:40       It's funny, you see the big bet is the proper word because you know, she identifies with the female sex of I think ding bet now works as opposed to Douche bags. See, I kept the D, I went, I went alliteration ice kid. Never fully see. You know what? I, I would never call Bruce a douche bag cause he was on the Wheaties box. You know, I don't know about this Katelyn though. That's the jury's still out. Oh Bruce did kill somebody. You don't accidentally, Caitlin has yet to accidentally killed somebody. So you know, there's a lot of mass to be done. You know what? I strike all that, I think. I think, uh, she was right to film yourself peeing in a skyscraper.

Speaker 5:          00:10:22       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:25       You know, whenever I see a video like that, I always wonder if people who are truly suffering around the world, if they ever get access to a laptop and just somehow that comes up on their fucking youtube page, you know what I mean? They're just living like in like those people that like Brazil that live in those fucking trash heaps. If somehow they see fucking Caitlyn Jenner walking around acting like a victim, you know, wearing shoes that they probably fucking sewed together at three o'clock in the fucking room

Speaker 5:          00:10:54       morning.

Speaker 1:          00:10:59       Oh, I know. I know. You're supposed to care about everything. Um, I don't, I don't give a fuck. You know what I give a shit about right now? Cheyenne? Anika calming to the Providence. Oh, so Wurster providence civic center. Wooster Civic Center. No.

Speaker 6:          00:11:17       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:18       Ah, fuck. I can't even remember. That's all I give a shit about. I give a shit about, um, I don't know, being able to fucking reach down and pick up a dirty sock. Don't have enough fucking bolt of lightning. Go down the back of my leg. That would be nice. Right. Maybe I'm transitioning, I'm transitioning into a fucking old man right before my very eyes, you know, my fucking dog has just been, he just sleeps all damn day. It's unreal. I know. I always bring this shit up, but it just blows me away. I want you around the block. That's it. It's all there was.

Speaker 4:          00:11:54       Um, anyways, so I've been watching as much as I can. Um, my wife's been on the road so I, uh, I immediately become a, a, a bachelor. However, I've kept this place pretty clean, you know, and that's a very important thing to do when you're married is when your spouse leaves, you have to fucking show them that you can live without them. I think that's a huge fucking thing. Like she so wants to come home and just see this fucking place in absolute like see that you couldn't live without me. You know what I mean? Which I couldn't, I would be fucking devastated if she fucking left or anything. Obviously I would be, but you know what I mean? You do have to have a little bit of self esteem. So I've gone back to the way I used to live. Like I have one plate, one fork, that's all I'm music and I just put it in the sink and if I need another one, I just watched that one. That's great. It's nice and quick. Saves a lot of water. Right? Ed Begley Jr would be so fucking happy with me right now. One plate, one fork. I'm really into that type of shit. And that's very hard to be into that type of shit when, uh, when you have a woman in your life, you know, not having a lot of stuff

Speaker 1:          00:13:06       because, uh, bitches be like and stuff. I don't know what it is. They can't get enough for fucking Amazon. I wonder what percentage of people, and you know, this sub fucking guy, but that doctor did a feminine straight doctor that helped me with Sayada. Um, I bet he's on Amazon all the time, you know, trying to find a new pair of fucking puffy pants to sandals. I'm, isn't it amazing that this guy helped me out the way he did? And I'm so fucking damage to the human as a human being that I still have to make fun of him.

Speaker 4:          00:13:38       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:39       And well, you know, what would you want from me? So anyways, the update with the gym. All right, I'll actually show you guys before and after pictures when, uh, when I'm done because, uh, it's just a fucking garage. I don't give a shit if you see that. So I got the pegboard up.

Speaker 4:          00:13:59       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:13:59       I actually, what I had before was, you know, those, um, you know those really long pegboards where your arms are really close together and they're like, they go on for fucking ever.

Speaker 4:          00:14:09       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:14:10       You know, my garage, you know, he has like a fucking eight foot ceilings, so that wasn't an option. So I bought two of those and mounted them sideways. So I used to just, just do the pegboard exercise sideways. You don't try to go all the way down and then come all the way back. And I'm now where they moved him, they actually cut them in half and put all four side by side. So the goal is eventually to go up one down the other, up the third and down the fourth. I got that up, I got the speed bag up. Uh, that's more for my wife. She's into that shit. Um, I don't give a fuck about that. You know, that's always, that was a big thing when I was growing up, having a heavy bag and all that shit, you know? And then people thought they were tougher because they were hitting the heavy bag that has no fucking arms or legs.

Speaker 1:          00:14:54       You know, you basically just, you, you beaten up, you know, you basically practicing to fight a cripple is all you are really doing. I mean, granted there was cardio involved, but actually I remember a long time ago seeing a fucking guy with no arms, no legs as a wrestler and nobody could beat him. They just, there was nothing to hook and he and he would just do it. I don't know what he was doing, but he would somehow flip these. It was like, can you just imagine wrestling just a rock, you know? But it was a long flat one and somehow it fucking could move. I don't know. And it had a head on it. I don't know how to describe this fucking kid. All I know is he was winning. So maybe, maybe there is something about that. You know, what, can I backtrack? I don't think I've had one at one point that I've made in this entire podcast that I haven't, I haven't retracted from, well you know what, it's a fucking election year.

Speaker 4:          00:15:48       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:15:49       What's the guy was, who was the other guy run other than Donald Trump? Hillary Clinton. Kidding. Ted Cruz. Ted Cruz. I don't know anything about Ted Cruz, but evidently he's really interested about where Caitlin Jenner drops a fucking deuce and Caitlyn made a fucking oh, snapchat fucking video of right. Is that what happened? Is that what happened on fucking Facebook this week? I'm so out of the loop. Everybody so out of the loop. Just can you guys just ride with me for the next couple of fucking months as I spend my entire waking hours in a fucking writer's room. I don't fucking see anything. I don't read anything. We just stare at a computer screen. I'm going to need fucking glasses by the time I'm done with this shit. My Act is drying up. Thank you. Know what I'm sitting is shitting on Caitlyn Jenner. Thank God she fucking made that video cause I ended up getting a great bit out of it this weekend. I fucked it up the first time. Um, and then the next time it, it, uh, it worked. So,

Speaker 4:          00:16:46       uh,

Speaker 1:          00:16:47       that's always great. You know, you gotta Love Topical Material. Topical material is like the Doritos of fucking stand up. You know what I mean? It's fucking, it's so fucking satisfying. But there's just no nutrition in it whatsoever.

Speaker 4:          00:17:02       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:17:03       But anyways, like I was saying before, I went down to the, the, uh, the comedy store and Doodie Kenny, I can't fucking believe it looks like a Goddamn nightclub. There's all these young people in there, there's beautiful women all dressed up and shit. Just having a great time. Like it's like, I don't know, I wasn't around during the 80s, but I don't know. Um, I dunno how it could have been any better just as far as the sheer amount of people coming out in there. And they are laughers too. So if you are in the La area,

Speaker 4:          00:17:35       mmm.

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       It's a good time to go down there. And, um, I was on, you know, the shows I was on was just fucking one monster fucking comic after another. That's probably another reason.

Speaker 4:          00:17:46       MMM.

Speaker 1:          00:17:47       Like one of my favorites, I consider a new guys, Chris Delea who goes down there. And what I love about that guy is just as a standup comic, I love seeing a legitimate headliner. You know, there's a lot of people that can sell tickets because they're on TV or they did a movie thing or they took a piss and Donald Trump's fucking tower, right? Caitlyn Jenner, which sell out a fucking Improv. But there's very few people that could basically follow anybody go out there and really level like the, the, the, the point at which that you have to level to really be considered a fucking headliner. And, uh, this guy fucking does it. So, um, yeah, man, there was a bunch of people who the fuck was on the show and went on up to Dane Cook. He fucking murdered. Um, I got there late on that one. And then the next show I was working with Chris Delea

Speaker 4:          00:18:43       and um,

Speaker 1:          00:18:47       Natasha Leggiero was on Bobby Lee, by the way, speaking to Natasha. Did anybody see the new dice clay fucking series? I love it. Did you see age? Oh my God, I'm a fuck up. His name is Adrian Brody. Why don't I know anybody's name? He did this whole fucking thing where he was playing himself and he was, uh, you know, and in his next acting role was to play dice clay, Andrew dice clay in a bio pic. So the whole episode, he's trying to get dice that, I don't want to ruin it, just fucking watch it. His dice clay is his fucking tremendous. And um, I don't know, speaking of the Worcester Centrum, I've always been a huge dice clay fan and I saw him, I know I've told this story before, but that's where I saw him in like 1988. I saw him, uh, at the Worcester Centrum, um, with an unknown Eddie Griffin opening up.

Speaker 1:          00:19:44       And uh, it was sick. He fucking murdered. He did a drum solo at the end of the end. It was one of the sickest shows I ever saw. And uh, I still didn't realize that I wanted to be a comedian, so fucking dumb. I was, when I was growing up, do you know, I used to memorize comedy albums and I would ride around my bicycle, you know, doing my paper route, reciting those at those albums, pretending I was doing them in the, in the school auditorium in front of the entire school. And it's still never dawned on me like, hey bill, that probably means that you want to be a comedian. Like I never, it never fucking done, it seemed like it was a million miles away. You know, we didn't have youtube,

Speaker 4:          00:20:25       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:20:28       could just film yourself taking a shit at a dairy queen and say, take that presidential candidate that you, you couldn't fucking do that back then. Um, anyways, so as always I'm going to talk about another car that I like and that I probably will never buy. I was watching something on that Tesla s and it's like the self driving fucking car and these two guys computer, look at guys, I'll say that because they both had glasses. So if you have glasses in my world that means you're smart and a lot of people's world that meets that you know, but you know I want to be politically correct. Maybe they were both a couple of fuck heads but anyways they were in this car and uh, they put on the self driving mode and according to the video they put blankets over themselves and they took a fucking nap. Now Tessa said that there's some alarming youtube videos of people doing shit in their cars that you're not supposed to be doing, but they basically took a nap and then somebody wrote in one of the comments underneath it like, would you get arrested if you got shit faced, put it on self driving mode and then sat in the back seat.

Speaker 5:          00:21:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:21:40       And you don't make, you don't know me, maybe you're thinking on me, but I'm always bitching about technology. I actually am coming around to the self driving car. Just provided that you could still drive it if you want to. Um, cause that is dead is pretty fucking cool. Do you realize, wow, how fucking artist shape in like the, you know, how bad like this is going to be for procrastinators, you know, the fact that they no longer have to drive themselves to work and they're going to be trying to finish their fucking presentation in their car. You know, you've seen people brushing their teeth or just people literally with an eye mask on, just fucking sleeping in the jam jams and then they pull up to work. You know, like you set your car alarm and that's like your fucking alarm to wake you up.

Speaker 1:          00:22:26       Like when it stops and it's in park, you know, maybe the horn just goes bad, bad, bad. That'd be too jarring. That'd be too jarring for people in the future. Right. They don't want to fuck a deal with anything. They just want to lay around. Right. So they fucking let you lay there in the car. And uh, you know those fucking creepy self vibrating fucking seats. When you get too close to something, maybe it does that you just lay in there, right? And it just sort of shakes you a little bit and some weird creepy computer voice. She could pick the voice too, right? You don't got no celebrities will jump all over that. They do the fucking voiceovers to make a little bit of cash because no one pays for movies anymore. And they're just sick of being in those mighty heroes. Fucking superhero movies, one after another. They're literally out of ideas. I mean, once you have like the superheroes fighting each other that they gotta be nervous in Hollywood just going like, where, where do we go from here?

Speaker 7:          00:23:24       You know,

Speaker 1:          00:23:26       can we reboot this thing again? Can we reboot the fucking joker and all that? We know what the funny thing is though, is people will keep showing up. I guess that makes sense, right? God knows they've had the comic books forever and people keep reading those. You know what, I'm, I'm taking that one back. I'm wrong about that one again. Have I been right? Fuck. Bunch of swings and misses. Um, so anyways, that Tesla as has another feature where you can like call the car like a fucking dog. Like if it's in a tight parking spot, you can just go, hey, Tesla, Tesla, Tesla, buddy. You want to go for a drive? Right. And, uh, the thing just slowly backs up. It comes to you. It's literally, it's like the fucking nitrite or car. And like I said, I am usually anti-technology and um, but every once in a while something comes along and I, and I even meet as much as of a fucking freckled content.

Speaker 1:          00:24:28       I am, I have to sit back and be like, you know what? That's cool. So here's the thing, the car costs like, I don't know, like $120,000. So I imagine 90% of the people, you know, not trying to talk down to you, okay, we'll say 80% of you that listened to this fucking thing, right? Just went like, oh Geez, I'll never be able to afford that. Yeah, you will. I'll tell you why. Okay. I'll give you, I'll give you fucking three examples. Calculators, rollerblades and flat screen TVs, all of those things. When they came out, they were fucking ridiculously expensive. And then by the end of it, they gave him away with like a free tank of fucking gas. Well maybe not the fucking flat screens, but you remember like we'll go back to California calculators first came out, they were a $100 each, something crazy like that.

Speaker 1:          00:25:17       And then they, they just kept dropping, dropping, dropping, dropping, dropping is more and more people bought them and then they had the solar ones in. The next thing you know you got a calculator with the fucking free Philip at the gas station. Roller blades were always over 100 bucks, right? And then everybody had them and then they're like, well what the fuck are we going to do with the rest of them? And next thing you know, they was 30 bucks, right? Flat screen TVs when they first came out. I F I for some reason remembered them to be about 11 grant when they first came out, you know, and they were about as thick as my fucking head. Let me look this up here. Original price, original price of flat screen TV's. I'm saying 11 grand for that screen. Flat screen falling costs of flat screens.

Speaker 1:          00:26:07       Wait, a farm, Jesus Christ. I'll never find it. Oh, the price was 14,090, almost 15 grand, $999 for a plasma TV, plasma display, TV, Yada, Yada, Yada. Advantages, disadvantages. Where the fuck was it history to, we'll go to the two thousands, 2000, the 40 inch TV cost. Uh, you know what? Go Fuck Yourself. I don't know where the fuck or was it actually came up and then I clicked on it and then the inflammation disappears. Um, sorry about that. I'm just so, I bet that the Tesla, that technology will, will, you know, it's like when airbags first came out, they run Mercedes. They protected the rich people first. And then once they got all the rich people's money, then they go, all right. You know what? Maybe we'll protect the middle class and then eventually it gets all the way down to like, you know, like there's starving kids in Africa. They probably have roller blades, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:27:11       And like a Chicago Blackhawks 2016, uh, advanced to the second round tee shirt. Right. You know, they always get those fucking get those hats. Like Boston Red Sox, 1986 world series champions. It's always somebody dig in for a blood diamond where in that shit buffalo bills four in a row, you know, that's like what is sexual a tee shirt, you know, sexually adwares over and fucking done on one of those sex slave countries. Are you making light of the sex trade and no, I'm just talking. I'll make in front of the buffalo bills there. I feel for the person that has two was sold into sex slavery, but I, I don't feel bad for the uh, buffalo bills. You know what I mean? You know why they lost all four of those cause nice guys finish last and Marv Levy is everything that Pete Carroll looks like he is.

Speaker 1:          00:28:08       Pete Carroll is is Marv Levy 2.0 both of them just look like you could just trust them. You know, I could leave, I can leave a stack of fucking cash here, right in front of him. My life savings, I will come back and I'm going to be fine. And, and that is true with Marv Levy and that's why he lost four Superbowls. Now if you were to leave that with Pete Carroll, you know, I, I'm, you know, I don't think I have to tell you that. You know, there'd be some Hooters chicks over there and teach God wing sauce on his face and be like, it's all there. Fuck you talking about. Um, why am I shitting on Pete Carroll and what you think of bill, what about your coach? What about fucking now, what about bill Belicheck? Well, he doesn't look wholesome. It looks like a mean dad doesn't eat like dad's home. God, he's such a Douche, you know, that's, that's what he looks like. Pete Carroll looks like, you know, be carrot. Looks like he goes to church, you know, and on the third day, Jesus will rise again and then he's in the back and go,

Speaker 8:          00:29:11       Woo,

Speaker 1:          00:29:13       that paid. He always gets excited during that part of the Jesus Story. Oh, JJ. Um, oh, what the fuck was with that guy? You know, I actually tweeted about that guy in the draft that got busted, you know, wearing in the fucking gas mass, taking the fucking we'd hit and uh, everybody gave me shit. Fuck, you didn't watch the draft. It's like, dude, it kind of became, it went viral. Actually. Uh, I was actually texted to me by a, uh, another comedian was letting me know. They said in real time this guy was getting blackmailed and uh, I ended up watching the clips do that was that guy should fire his fucking agent yesterday. That poor bastard, nobody, he had no advice. He was sitting there sweating. If nobody came out, it's, that woman didn't say, hey, that's enough. No more questions. If she didn't rescue him, that guy would still be sitting there like pouring sweat, answering ever every fucking question that they asked them. What's the most fucked up thing ever jerked off to? Well I would have to say, uh, you know, it's just like, I don't know where his agent was, but um, he was somewhere high fiving himself I think. Um, God dammit that Tesla's a good looking car from the side. I just hate the front end. It's just weird, you know, cause it doesn't need a fucking, doesn't need a grill cause it doesn't have a radiator because it doesn't have an engine to fucking,

Speaker 1:          00:30:44       you know, cool off or whatever. I was going to say, well it'd be cool if they just put it in there anyways, but then air would get trapped and then it was actually slow down to that's the fucking car. That's the car you want. That thing is, it's fast. It's actually beats a fucking Lamborghini. It beats a Ferrari zero to 60. It fucking smokes. That car literally smokes a fucking supercar. Now when they get up into the higher gears, this, you know, fucking 70, 80 miles an hour, the Ferrari overtakes them. Who gives a fuck?

Speaker 3:          00:31:14       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:31:15       Gives a fuck 80 90 miles an hour. I mean, I guess if you, the only reason to want a car going that fast, if you take it to the track, if you fucking drive a hundred miles an hour on a regular streets, you're a fucking asshole and you're going to kill somebody. So, um, you know what? God dammit, I think I'm going to get that car. Uh, Jesus. That's a good looking car and get it in black. Huh? With the red fucking cow. Nah, I'm too fucking, I'm too frugal. Can't blow her 120,000. What are they? What's the fucking car payment on that?

Speaker 1:          00:31:49       It's a fucking moron. You could buy a third of Detroit for the amount of money you're going to pay for a fucking Tesla. That's insane. You know, I watched the trashiest fucking youtube videos and I really have to stop doing it because everything like I, for some reason I was looking at the top 10 inappropriate police officer pictures posted online. And then once you do that, then you're just stuck in this thing. Top 10 things banned in the United States. Inappropriate family photos that will make you cringe. You know, most of them are staged, but you still sit there and watch at the top 10 fucking creepy things ever dug up. The top 10 weird things in the background is some Hor took a picture of her fucking ass in a thong. 10 most dangerous gangs in the world. All right, I'll look at this guys.

Speaker 1:          00:32:37       All fucking tattooed up holding the baby. As far as for sentence, 10 of the most dangerous gangs in the world. This is what I do when my wife's out of town. I watch playoff hockey and then I have that on. And then I fucking sit here and I look at this shit. 15 most poisonous animals in the world. You know what it is? I've seen every fail video at this point. I've seen every people are awesome video. Um, I've seen every fight video. I've seen every instant Karma bully thing. I, I've, I just, I just feel like I've seen everything that I give a fuck about. Instant Karmas fails five most dangerous people in the world. 10 acts, 10 acts, 10 actors who actually did it on screen. I didn't see that. Wait a minute. What the fuck is this one c and now I'm not going to watch the most dangerous gangs.

Speaker 1:          00:33:32       You know, it's funny. As much. Most of you will make fun of me right now on the other. The rest of you are googling the shit right now. Um, so anyways, uh, see if I got any questions that my fucking Andrew sent me the fucking questions yet cause I don't have any of the advertising. I ain't get nothing. I'm trying to get this shit out of the fucking way because I got to do a radio tour next week to hype all my dates coming up in Florida. Bill, you coming to Florida? You didn't mention that. Oh yeah, go on all the big cities too. I'm going to a Orlando right home of Disney world now. Like that small shit out here, right? Just Disneyland. This is Disney world. Uh, May 6th I'm going to be at the Seminole hard rock hotel and a casino in Hollywood, Florida.

Speaker 1:          00:34:23       Then I'm going to be at the hard rock live in Orlando, Florida doing two shows. And then on May 8th, I'll be at the Times Union Center for the Performing Arts, more in Moran Modal Theater in Jacksonville, Florida. Um, and hopefully I'll get their fucking early enough. I can go to a gun range in suits and fucking guns with silences. That's some fun shit. Um, God dammit. That's a good time. Jacksonville is underrated under fucking rated city to go to, I know a lot of people shit on, you know, northern Florida. But, uh, I gotta be honest with you. I love a shit town. You know, there's fun to be had. Anybody can go to fucking Miami, go to some fucking Botox party, whatever the fuck it is those people do down there. It's like you're not pretty enough. You gotta fucking laminate your face. You know, they're just weird. I like being in those, you know, Tampa, Clearwater, Tallahassee, Orlando, Jacksonville. Orlando is not even bad. Orlando's like, I'm sort of like Orange County. It just sort of a, I dunno, it has that mcmansion vibe, you know?

Speaker 1:          00:35:39       Um, I don't know, but a lot of people live out that way because there's no a state income tax. That's why so many Burt Reynolds ended up going out there. Oj Simpson, you know, all the people that had rough course cases, you know, double murders, divorces, all of that shit. You know, they all end up in Florida. That's when you know, you know, you know, as you get fucking older, I think he just, that's, that's one of the major signs that you were basically a very successful but married. The wrong person slash maybe killed somebody is you end up in Florida if you're not like indigenous to that area. Ooh, bell indigenous. Somebody learned a fucking word, Huh? All right. Let's see if I can read some advertising here for the Goddamn Week. The God damn week of May 2nd. You know, I always make like a, um, a mental note to myself, uh, at the beginning of May, even though I live out here in la in the fucking weather's always great cause like I'd always just remember like I always be working and I'd be site that was may. And then before I realized that it was in the August and I was thinking like, wow, the first light, 90 days of this shit.

Dear Bill, did you see the video going around this weekend of, uh, of the Brooklyn bike race pileup? No, I didn't. Uh, it really makes you question the hive mentality of those bikers.

Speaker 1:          00:43:39       I've been involved in some high speed activities and their inability to stop or slow down properly, properly is mind blowing. Give it a Google come down to San Diego once in awhile. Um, no I haven't seen that. But uh, I do know that people on a regular basis fucking die. I'm not on a regular basis. But you definitely diamonds. Yeah. The how fast those fucking guys goes. Yeah. You're riding a motorcycle without an engine and I'm, Oh, you get those fucking little shorts on, get that road rash. It's the exact same thing. It minus the muffler burned. Uh, but I actually am a big fan of bike racing though. I always used to watch the Tour de France and I love watching lance wind fucking seven in a row, which he did. He wants seven in a rough. Okay. Everybody from him all the way to the back of the race tested positive.

Speaker 1:          00:44:27       So I'll never, I'll never give up those seven. I'll always that he wanted those fucking things. And I gotta tell you something right now. I haven't watched it since then because it's been boring without, you know, it's like tiger woods ever since his wife fucking flipped out on him. You know, it took half his money. The fucking guy isn't one shit. And I never watch golf. I do like Phil Mickelson though. I like watching that guy, that guy. He's like a, the guy fucking goes for it. He doesn't give a shit. He's like, yeah, you're behind a tree. I don't give a fuck. I'm going to slice right around this thing. I'm going for the pin. Uh, I don't know. Maybe you should lay up. Hey, look at all this sweat. I got into my man tits. You think I'm laying up? I'm already ready for a fucking Arnold Palmer.

Speaker 1:          00:45:07       I'm going for the pin. It's what he does every time. All right, drum workout. Hey sir, billion big fan of the podcast and thought I'd share this with you because I know how much you love drums and talking about working out. Um, oh yeah, recently. Yeah. I don't know how I, I, I missed out on pan terror. I just, you know, I could never get into that fucking type of singing, you know what I mean? He's like, Jesus Christ, I heard this in my house growing up. I, I don't music used to take me away from this shit, but just undeniably Vinnie Paul is one of the great rock drums of all time without a fucking doubt. And I don't think he gets the credit. I was talking to my drum teacher about this where he's a lot like Alex van Halen, who's another one of the great drummers of all time, but both of them like Alex never got is do I feel because of Eddie.

Speaker 1:          00:45:53       Eddie was just so fucking insane that everybody focused on him and they didn't really even notice how great Alex was. And I feel like pan terrorists the same thing. It's kind of creepy how like they both have brothers, like, you know, there were innovated, innovative, you know, dying bag. The cab was just, there was nobody liked either one of those guitar players in fact. And then you are else is fucked to bring it full circle is unfortunately, when Dimebag was murdered, um, I always heard that Eddie donated one of his key loved Eddie van Halen and Eddie donated one of his guitars. Um, I think it was that black and yellow one and they actually buried with Dimebag. So, uh, I don't know, it's kind of a morbid way to go around and say, Vinnie, Paul's a fucking amazing drummer. But, um, I started listening to that song.

Speaker 1:          00:46:38       I'm broken and uh, you know, it's fucking killing me that I can't just sit down and try to figure that fucking song out. Cause I, you know, got to sit in this fucking writer's room. I'm really whining about the writer's room, you know, cause I'm used to just fucking have in my days to myself to just sit around, you know, staring at my dry me undies balls. Um, all right, drum workouts. So this new workout saw this new workout where you pretend to play the drums, which is currently available in the La area. See the video link. Wanted to hear your thoughts. Comment on these modern gym classes these days. Time to start soundproofing that garage gym. Thanks for la for the laughs and go fuck yourself. Well why, what I don't understand like guitar hero or even, I haven't even looked at this fucking workout class. Like why wouldn't you just learn how to play drums? Oh, they're not pretending to play drums. They have sticks. Oh God.

Speaker 5:          00:47:36       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:47:36       Is this going to be white people trying to be tribal? Oh yeah. It's sort of aerobics and then just playing beats with sticks and stuff. Oh my God, this, Oh this has given me Deuce Chels ah. They're like,

Speaker 5:          00:48:00       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:48:01       Oh God. And they always has to be the person wearing the hat inside the knitted hat.

Speaker 5:          00:48:09       Ah,

Speaker 1:          00:48:10       just when you thought that awful look went away. You know the guy with the fucking skinny jeans, the t shirt and then like, I'm going to have a snowball fight hat on. I'm pretending to play the drums is now a hot new workout. Well they weren't really pretending. They were actually hitting the floor with them and stuff and hitting the sticks. So he said there was already a dance from form in India called Dan. Yeah. Dan Dia, which has the same concept of dancing with sticks and a thousand plus years old tradition. Oh, what a surprise. What is surprised at? Somebody already come up with a little gift up, gets people in shape. It actually kind of looks like fun, but I my ears couldn't handle, I'd have to have fucking earplugs in. Um

Speaker 5:          00:48:56       hmm.

Speaker 1:          00:48:57       I Dunno, but everyone was making those guitar hero rocket, rocket out faces. But what would be cool is if that actually, you know, if you take one of those classes and you actually want to learn how to play drums, but you know, you can't really play because you have an apartment. I cannot recommend those Rolling v drums enough. They're fucking amazing. And uh, I told you when I had to two of those kits when I was in New York, it's kind of weird because it's like a computer, like it gets old and then the new one's better than you. Like, cause you know, if it was an acoustic, like a regular drum kit, you just keep it from the fucking drums. But they get the new brains and they're better. And I don't know, you just keep, just keep, I don't know. It's a lot of fucking money, but they're fucking awesome.

Speaker 1:          00:49:40       So if you live, if you live like the way I did where I had a neighbor underneath me, I went downstairs and I knocked on the guys doing, I said, listen, I practice drums. Uh, when do you work? I'll only practice during those hours. If you're ever home. When I'm practicing, here's my phone number, call me the second I pick up, you tell me to stop. I will immediately stop. And we, uh, we actually still had a problem because the first time you heard me play and he, I said, hello. He goes, can you knock it off? And I just fucking snapped on the guy. I was like, dude, don't fucking say that. Like you asked me 12 fucking times. It did all that shit. And then he never called me again fucking dickhead. Although you know, in defense of him, I can't imagine what that sounded like underneath, you know, not Jesus.

Speaker 1:          00:50:21       I'm just fucking, I'm just, just for attracting every fucking statement. Alright, shoot matches. Dear Billy bangers and Mash, you were talking about shoot, mashes, shoot matches on this Thursday's podcast. For those of you who didn't listen, uh, shoot match is a wrestling term where basically, you know, the sports entertainment, you know, it's a fake fight even though they really hurting each other, but you know, it's worked out. It's sports entertainment. So technically it's fake even though they're really throwing each other and getting hurt, it is fake. Um, what happens in a shoot match is somebody fucking snaps and becomes a real fight and starts beating the shit out of the person for real. So, um, he said if you're into those shoot matches, you should definitely look up a wrestler name New Jack. The psycho was known for frequently shooting on other wrestlers for the most minor things.

Speaker 1:          00:51:14       In one case, he thought a tag team was trying to steal his gangster image. So he hit them with chairs, full force, stabbed them in the head with forks, it's Cetera. And another match. He basically tries to murder a 60 something year old man. Those matches are brutal as fuck man. You should check them out. I actually saw those. Yeah, that guy has like psychological damages, damages, psychological damage. Um, I knew a guy liked that when I was growing up. He went to fucking cops. School surprise, surprise. You know, fucking maniacs. You like to be violent. Like they always end up somehow being bouncers and cops. I'm not saying they're all like that. I'm just saying it's like, you know, people that want to fuck kids, you know, they're all about volunteering to take them out into the woods. Not saying every cub scout master as well.

Speaker 1:          00:52:08       I'm just saying, you know, people who want to beat the fuck out of people in don't want to go to jail, get jobs where they have the authority to beat the fuck out of somebody. So this fucking lunatic. So he comes back from like his weekend at cops school and um, I don't know what he did and he never got accepted. They just were like try out thing. I don't know. I can't remember was so fucking long ago. So he wants to show me this move that he learned and he was doing it in slow motion. And then I remember he just fucking looked up at the ceiling, you know? Do you remember how like, uh, that dude in full metal jacket when he's like, I am in a world of shit. Try the joker, you know, that, that thing, right. He fucking looked up like that and just fucking full force did the move.

Speaker 1:          00:52:58       And I heard my fucking wrist snap and um, I forget how many times I punched him in the side of the head. I was so fucking mad at him and I was really just mad at myself because I knew that he was one of those guys, like he just fucking like, like he was one of those key was one of the exact type of personality that you do not teach that type of shit too. Because just he was a dope. He never felt like he had power in life and then he had this new move and he just couldn't handle it. It was like, you know the whole thing when they always talk like a baby poisonous snake is the worst, is worse than getting bit by an adult baby snake. Cause he dealt babies, snakes sort of rations out. The poison with the baby just gives you fucking both barrels. That's, that's what the fuck he did. He had the mentality of a fucking baby reptiles. What I'm saying? And he fucking jacked up my goddamn wrist and hey, and you know what? It became a fucking shoot match. That was probably as positive. Show it to me and I just fucking drilled him in the side of the head like fucking six times is hard as I fucking could. I was so fucking mad at him and I remember we were both drunk.

Speaker 6:          00:54:11       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:54:11       Yeah. Fucking idiot. God bless him. Um, anyways, moving ahead here. That was a throwback Thursday story. All right. Fight dear Billy boy band. Billy boy band. All right. Everyone's been asked. Everyone's always asking for advice. So here's a rhetorical, uh, who's, who wins in a fight to the death between a silver back gorilla and a grizzly bear. One's got Iq and Matt upper body, the other has razor sharp claws and skull crushing jars. Uh, thanks, uh, and go sit on it repeatedly. And I don't know what that means. Is that like a happy days, rest reference? Um,

Speaker 1:          00:54:56       I would say, uh, it depends on if it's a high, I'm rooting. I would go with the home team. All right. If it's a home game for the grizzly bear and they're out in an open field and there's no fucking tree for the gorilla to fucking go up and then come back down, go up. You don't do that fucking monkey shit where they slap you in the fucking head. Um, I would, I would say the grizzly wins because you know, the gorillas can ball up its fists, but you know, you're fighting, it's like you fight and Freddy Krueger and he's got two gloves for gloves. Actually, I would say. Um,

Speaker 6:          00:55:39       yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:55:39       I dunno. And I got to admit, like I think, I think grill is a chill, like I don't think they really like doing that stuff. And, um, I've watched him fight other fucking gorillas and, uh, you know, there's a lot of clutching and grabbing and shit and I've watched two gorilla grizzly bears go at it and it's fucking devastating. Where you like, how was one of them not dead? So I would say a grizzly bear. Um, I don't know. And I'm sure over in Asia that they have those fights on the weekends somewhere in Asia. They're doing that right now. Um, because when I go on Youtube, I'm just basing that on, you know, where you go on Youtube is actually black and white footage of like lions fighting tigers and shit like that and fucking cobras fighting these things and you know, it's not an alligator's first fucking cobras or whatever the fuck they was.

Speaker 1:          00:56:34       Just, you know, like over in Asia, like the original MMA, you know, UFC type of shit was actually animals versus animals, you know. I mean, you've got to give it up to them. I mean, I know that we, we ask those questions here over in Asia, they actually get it done. You know, which makes means that they're actually killing it more in the realm of a, don't tell me. Show me that. Taking the initiative is all I'm saying. Um, all right. Here we go. We get a couple more here. All right. Um, let me read the last two. Fucking advertising's really quick. Advertising's advertisements.

I've got the questions. The last two here. All right, Tom Brady and Jim, or say, all right, even I'm sick of this fucking story at this point. What are Billy boy, big fan of you by blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Of course the patch didn't beat the colts by 34 because of a deflated ball, deflated balls. That's not the point though. Here's an example. If a baseball player is on steroid but goes, oh for five on a particular day, what do you mean? That's not the point though. I don't know what point you made.

Speaker 4:          01:01:33       MMM.

Speaker 1:          01:01:35       I guess you're saying the deflated ball didn't affect the outcome of a baseball player is on steroids, but goes, oh, for five on a particular day. Does that mean he didn't cheat? Of course not. I hate people who do this who ask questions for me. Uh, the point I'm making is that it's not about the results. It's about breaking the rules. See, this is why I can't stand people. That's not, this is not what that decision was about Tom Brady's was, was his suspension was reinstated. Not because it was proven that he cheated. This last trial was all about does it corporation have a right to discipline? It's employee. That's what it was about. That's what the NFL was fighting. Cause Tom Brady opened up a can of worms, which was basically like where your boss and we said you're suspended. He appealed it outside of the NFL into a court of law, which of course it didn't fucking hold up cause it was a complete kangaroo court for shit fucking thing that happened.

Speaker 3:          01:02:41       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:02:41       You know where the owner of the other fucking team hires a guy to find dirt on the other fucking team, which you can do on anybody. Right. And then then one guy plays judge, jury and execution. You take it into a court of law. I knew that thing would get laughed out of court, which had fucking did. And Jim Irsay was looked to be a fucking moron. So then what happened, sir, is they changed their argument. They then went back to say, listen, we are the NFL, the corporation known as the national football league. Tom Brady is an employee. All right? We said that he's suspended. We are his boss. Do we w we, we argue that we have the right to suspend our own employees. That's what it was about. Okay. So this is what kills me about all these people, including Michael [inaudible], Michael Rappaport who texted me, right? He fucking texted me and he goes, hi mother fucker. Guilty until proven innocent. Like, like Tom Brady was recess. Like this suspension was reactivated, thus vindicating everybody that says, Tom Brady's a cheat. You guys are not paying attention to the fucking story. That's not what happened. What happened was the NFL in a court of law one the right to suspend Tom Brady because Tom Brady is a fucking, oh God. Is there anything more relentless than when your fucking wife calls Jesus Christ? I've got two more minutes here. Um, all right, I'll answer it here. Hang on a second.

Speaker 1:          01:04:14       I'll answer it. Hello. Hello. It's connecting. Hey, I'm finishing my podcast. That's why I have a microphone and headphones on. I'll try acquire right back. Qt By. Um, anyways, that's what happens. So I'll read the rest of this guy. Shit. Most buffalo wild wings dopes. Think what happened was the, uh, the NFL appealed it and it got proven that Tom Brady is in fact a cheater. That that was never proven. It was never proven. All right, so I don't know what, so he goes, if Brady broke the rule, then he should be punished. I don't know if he did or he didn't. I'm just tired of the argument that sends pads, the pads blew out the colts. It doesn't matter. Another thing, you always say that the colts owner got rules changed to benefit his teams. What rules were changed? As far as I know, he only asked that the league enforce rules that were already in place.

Speaker 1:          01:05:08       Now we sat on the rules committee when we beat him and we roughed up as receivers, he bitched to the referees and the referee said that's illegal. He then made a tape, he and a and Peyton manning made a tape, went to the NFL and the NFL said, that's legal. Jim Irsay got on the rules committee. He spearheaded a movement to make the way we covered their receivers, not legal. Okay. The cold set a better offense than we did at the time. We had a better defense. He made a rule change that tipped it in favor of him. This guy is fucking filthy. He's fucking filthy. Those laws were changed. And why do I have to tell you that? Why don't you fucking look it up like you can't find it anyways, he goes, as far as I know, he only asked for the no. Yeah, as far as you know yet because you didn't look it up.

Speaker 1:          01:05:53       The five yard rule for receivers has been around forever. No, it hasn't. No, it hasn't. That happened in my lifetime. The first thing that was was the Mel blunt rule. When he beat the shit out of Golden Richards in the super bowl. Don't fuck you. You're speaking in general out of these. I can't fucking, I can't stand people like this. Oh, and it's been around for rubber. Oh, this global blue. Oh, the, the, they don't even look it up. That's like version one verse. He fucking goes like, uh, you know, Joe Montana had Jerry Rice. It's like he didn't have him for his first two super bowls. He had nobody in 81 he had Freddy Solomon and Dwight Clark. Those were his number one and two receivers. And he had some guy, Earl Cooper is a fucking running back. He won with nobody. He won with people. But you want to start one of the people he won't stars, right? Fucking millennials. I don't understand that. Wherever the pre millennials, they just don't look at any of them. He said Earth or say simply wanted it enforced. What's wrong with that? Please respond on your podcast. Even if you shit on me, I'll remain a listen or you're funny, mother Fucker, Dude. That's not what fucking happened. And all of this shit happen in your lifetime. You're just having selective memory.

Speaker 1:          01:07:08       He fucking, he said to the referee's, look at this tape. Look what they did. They go, yeah, we saw it. That's legal. Unreal. Unreal. And then they made the tape, how do you forget this shit? There was, it was like a little over 10 years ago. Go look it up. That's what the fuck happened. And then it became, then it became, you can't touch them at all. It wasn't after five yards. It wasn't before the five yards. You're touching moves after them. The physical contact that they were having after that that they were bitching about, and then that's when it came, okay, you can do the five yard chuck. And then after that bullshit, you can't touch anybody at all. Used to be able to handshake. I'm not saying like, you know that, you know, 10 years ago you could fucking beat the shit out of me. I'm not saying that, but it's gradually kept moving towards what Jim Irsay finally had was like, okay, you can push the guy, you know, in the first five yards and then this is the gym or the gym or say ruled that his men after that you can't do anything.

Speaker 1:          01:08:16       Okay. Which is why right after that, all of a sudden all of Dan Marino's records started falling right and left. I remember one year there was like drew bullies, drew Brees, Peyton manning and like fucking Tom Brady were all on pace to break his like almost 30 year old record. Yes. Yards in a season. Um,

Speaker 4:          01:08:35       yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:08:35       because of those, those ridiculous things that we became almost a legal to cover a receiver. It was never like that when I was growing up ever. And if you don't believe me, do your homework, go look, go look at old NFL footage. This shit that you could do. The NBA is the same fucking way you could beat the shit out of somebody if they came down the fucking lane. I mean, what Kevin Mchale did, the Kurt Rambis, I mean back in the [inaudible] data, that would be like a 10 game suspension, um, or whatever it would be. You'd be suspended for a number of games in it. And as far as I know, nobody even got thrown out. Uh, but I am going back like 30 years, so please just, I don't give a fuck if you want to shit on my team, but just do your homework. That last trial was about a corporation's right to suspend an employee.

Speaker 1:          01:09:16       That's what it was about. It wasn't about whether Tom Brady was guilty. And, uh, and for all you concept out there who are just obsessed with this air pressure, what if Tom Brady had fucking steroids delivered to his fucking mailbox in his wife's name? Give me a fucking break already. And even then, I gotta be honest with you. I don't think steroids changed the outcome of the game. They help your personal performance. But if steroids just met you won the game, then you know, teams that did steroids, they're there, but they, when they just go on defeated. Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:09:47       okay.

Speaker 1:          01:09:47       I Dunno. It gives you a competitive edge. It does. And you know, whatever, I, I am not against steroids. I think steroids should be fucking legalize. They should be researched to the hilt and um, just for literally for the quality of life then everyone's going to have, I can't, I mean singers blow out their voices, they get to take a steroid and they go out to sing the fucking song. There'll be in the crowd says that they cheated. Right.

Speaker 1:          01:10:15       I Dunno. Anyways, what's flower head? Whatever. I'm, I'm fucking, I'm done arguing that especially at this point when all of that information that I just said is out there. I might've had a couple of things wrong cause I don't have the literally the documents in front of me. But basically what I'm saying is true and I just don't want to argue this shit anymore. Okay. No matter what, this guy's going to get suspended. Cause at the end of the day he works with his fucking corporation. And you know what the NFL is actually right. I think they're wrong to suspend Tom Brady. I think that the, the investigation and all of that was an absolute fucking witch hunt. I think all of that is bullshit. But I do think that the NFL is a corporation has to maintain the right to suspend somebody. So if the bus has to roll over Tom Brady, then so be it.

Speaker 1:          01:11:00       Cause it's gonna make for a better league because if he gets away with this, then everybody is going to appeal it outside of the NFL and then they lose control. And as much as I'm not a fan of monopolies, as a sports fan, it works out great. Like the UFC is to shit because the fighters have no options. I feel bad for those guys, but it's great for me as a fight fan because the best guys have to fight the best guys. Um, all right. Advice. I smell. All right. I have a car. I have a crippling health issues since I was a kid. I fucking stink. People tell me I smell moldy. No doctor knows why Colone deodorants can't mask it. Oh my God. He goes, the odor actually gets stronger when I use those things. Showering doesn't help. So I am left alone with the this issue I'm trying to eat as healthy as possible and exercise every day, which seems to reduce the problem by 50%, which sounds like a lot but still doesn't satisfy me.

Speaker 1:          01:12:00       I think it's a metabolic issue, which I don't even know what that is. And the body is trying to get rid of the toxins through the skin. Not sure though, either way. My whole life revolves around this shit and it led me through episodes of depression as a teenager and I even considered throwing myself off a bridge or in front of one of those great white trains, uh, US Germans are making, but life is actually decent despite this issue. I can't attend any college classes because of the anxiety, but I have a great amount of friends. I'm happy, funny, alright. Looking Guy. And my game is all right. So I still get my dick wet. Sometimes gross. Uh, can't lock down any girl though for obvious reasons. I don't even know why I wrote all of this, but I just wanted to tell you that this podcast and your comedy are really stimulating.

Speaker 1:          01:12:51       My Butt's thinking brain, please come to Germany so we can see your show and I can harass you nose. Thanks for reading and go fuck yourself and your dog. Just kidding. I like your dog. Just go fuck yourself. I'm all right dude. Um, I would just keep going to doctors if they, I bet they could figure something out. You know, it's gotta be some new agey type of thing, some sort of detox. If it's your body getting rid of a toxic, maybe you're allergic to something. I have no idea. I am not, obviously not a doctor here, but yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:13:23       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:13:24       Detox, fasting, changing your diet. Um, there's gotta be, there's gotta be a way to do that. I remember long time ago, there was some woman that just had, was talking about she had brutal Halitosis, which is, uh, you know, you breads fucking stinks. It was fucking brutal. And, um, it turned out she had some sort of sinus infection and then once they cleared that up for fucking, her breath was fine. So I bet you have.

Speaker 3:          01:13:54       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:13:55       I, you know, if I had to guess, there's something undiagnosed, you know. Oh God, I'm so in over my head. You got something maybe that you have some sort of fucking infection. I have no fucking idea. And I bet you know there's gotta be something that is if, if, if somebody can take a nap and drive to work and not kill anybody, they got to figure out why your moldy. I would just keep going to specialists and I, if you guys have nationwide healthcare over there, I would just, that would be my new hobby, you know, and just keep adding to your file and somebody comes in and somebody will finally crack the fucking case as to why you smelled moldy. I bet they can figure it out, you know? And then what would be great is you went to the alienation of this. See, you got the sense of humor that comes from feeling alienated and um, I, your life will be a fucking joke after that.

Speaker 1:          01:14:46       I mean, think about it too. If you could just stop smelling moldy, I would think that that's the number one thing. And then you'd be happy. You live your life would be at fucking joke. So if you have nationwide healthcare, I would be seeing a doctor like fucking every couple of days. All right buddy. It's like you're pulling people out of the crowd. He hit the half court shot. Eventually it's, the ball's going to go in, I believe in June. It's fuel. It's fucking Germany. You guys got you guys a fucking, you know, half our space program we stole from you guys. The whole seeds of it. Audio tape, all that shit. You guys had better machine guns that we did. Ours would overheat. Sophie killed you. We actually picked, we dropped our guns and picked up your machine. Guns is no fucking way in 2016 they can't figure out why your moldy. I feel bad for you, man. I'm rooting for you and I hope you figure it out before you come out to my shelf and a, I should probably know the answer if they didn't, you know. All right, go fuck yourselves. I have a great weekend. I'll check in on you on Thursday. Let's see you.
