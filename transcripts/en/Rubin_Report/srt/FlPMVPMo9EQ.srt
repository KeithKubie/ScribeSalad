1
00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:04,190
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:08,450
I want to shift to the book or you want
to keep going? No, no, no. Please, please.

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,990
I would much rather talk about this book.
All right. So it's called blueprint,

4
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:16,880
the evolutionary origins
of a good society. So let's
start with the tag there.

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,430
So we actually live in a good society.
I can't believe it.

6
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:23,300
I thought we live in the worst society
ever and I thought capitalism is evil and

7
00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:26,780
the patriarchy and so many terrible
things and we've done horrible things.

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,690
But you say this is
good. Yeah, I'm appalled.

9
00:00:29,691 --> 00:00:33,020
Can you please explain this
matter statement? Yes. Okay.

10
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:38,021
So I think there has been a long tradition
in the sciences and in the public

11
00:00:38,031 --> 00:00:40,700
domain as well of um,

12
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,460
focusing on the bad side of human nature,

13
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,050
on our propensity for tribalism or
selfishness or violence or hatred.

14
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:53,570
But equally we are natural selection of
our evolution has equipped us and shaped

15
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:58,220
us for love and friendship and cooperation
and teaching and all these other

16
00:00:58,221 --> 00:01:00,380
wonderful qualities.
And in fact,

17
00:01:00,381 --> 00:01:05,360
I would argue that these good qualities
and their benefits must necessarily have

18
00:01:05,361 --> 00:01:10,040
outweighed the bad qualities and their
costs. Because if I came near you,

19
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,650
I'm now speaking of
over evolutionary time,

20
00:01:12,651 --> 00:01:14,900
over tens or hundreds
of thousands of years.

21
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,700
If I came near you and you killed me or
filled me with lies or otherwise injured

22
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:23,540
me, I would be better off
living separately. So, so the,

23
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,230
so the fact that we live
socially suggest that on balance,

24
00:01:27,231 --> 00:01:31,310
the benefits of a connected
life must outweigh the costs.
So the books, the book,

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:34,640
what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to
push back at these claims that we are,

26
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,230
that humans are inexorably evil.
And these arguments I should make,

27
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,290
I should say, are
supplementary to the, uh,

28
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:45,980
the body of ideas that Steven pinker
and others had been advancing about the

29
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:49,910
sweep of history. So where Stephen
is interested in historical forces,

30
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:52,880
I'm interested in the books
over there. So yeah. And Amy's,

31
00:01:52,881 --> 00:01:57,350
I see in a bunch of other younger Steven
and give me all my friends Neil Neil

32
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,200
crew by data. So you want
to be a man? Yes, please.

33
00:02:00,201 --> 00:02:03,380
Put me over there with those guys. Yes,
exactly. You're like some of those guys.

34
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:08,310
Yes. And Schirmer's book. I can see.
Yeah. These are great. Um, okay. So, uh,

35
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,660
uh, yeah, the moral arc
that you know. Okay, great.

36
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:16,010
So I'll make sure you have a copy.
Okay. But anyway, um, so, so, um,

37
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:21,200
so, uh, uh, so Steven is
arguing that, uh, you know,

38
00:02:21,201 --> 00:02:25,700
basically since the enlightenment
philosophical principles in the scientific

39
00:02:25,701 --> 00:02:27,470
discoveries,
discoveries of the enlightenment,

40
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,520
the world has been getting better and
he's unquestionably bright. We are safer,

41
00:02:31,521 --> 00:02:35,030
less violent, healthier, live, longer,
wealthier, better off in every,

42
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:39,170
every possible dimension. And that is
largely a product of historical forces.

43
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,470
But what I'm arguing and
technological forces,

44
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:45,740
but when I'm arguing is that we don't
just have to look to our history to find

45
00:02:45,741 --> 00:02:48,560
this goodness.
We can look to our pre history.

46
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,190
And actually over tens of thousands
of years we've been shaped to be good.

47
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,330
We have been shaped to be able to live
together in productive ways, in, in, in,

48
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:59,680
in good ways, actually in morally
good ways. I even argue so,

49
00:02:59,681 --> 00:03:02,320
so the both work synergistically,
these two forces and in,

50
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:07,120
and in fact I would even argue that
these historical and technological forces

51
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:11,770
are actually just a thin veneer on
top of much more powerful forces.

52
00:03:11,771 --> 00:03:16,771
So is there a bizarre evolutionary force
that that inclines us to focus on the

53
00:03:18,071 --> 00:03:22,750
negative on? No, that's a good question.
I suspect if I had to, I get one per show.

54
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:27,460
No, no, no, no, no. Um, I would say right,

55
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:30,100
cause if you ask if you a
person are things good or bad,

56
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:33,400
people generally tend to bed. We watch
local news. That is all terrible news.

57
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,110
We're conditioned sort of. So there must
be something that's leading to that. Yes.

58
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:40,630
I think that, I think, I
know this has been studied,

59
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:44,420
I'm trying to quickly call
the literature to my mind. Um,

60
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,470
if I had to speculate on what the
conclusions of that literature would be,

61
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:51,220
it would be that there's more advantage
to paying attention to bad news and good

62
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:54,340
news that the fitness advantage
of survival advantage,

63
00:03:54,341 --> 00:03:57,250
the advantage to your wellbeing from,
um,

64
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:02,290
noting a fire in your vicinity
or a Predator or a killer,

65
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,560
uh, is more advantageous
to you than, than, uh,

66
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:10,620
than noted the noting that on average
the presence of water or a food or a

67
00:04:12,491 --> 00:04:14,260
kindly person.
So I think,

68
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:17,590
I think that that's probably why
we're hardwired to be pessimistic,

69
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,160
but actually we're not,
let me be clear. So,

70
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:26,130
so we have both pessimistic and
optimistic, uh, inclinations people,

71
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,020
and of course there's Inter individual
variation. People vary in this,

72
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,220
these personality traits.

73
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:34,450
But I think overall we are
definitely inclined to the good.

74
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:37,030
So when you described yourself
as an optimist before,

75
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:40,810
if you had to try to parse that out
between what you think human nature is

76
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:44,860
versus upbringing and everything else,
could you give it some percentages?

77
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:46,240
I mean where your parents,

78
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:50,950
optimists so that then push a well as
ideas to you or I think it's important not

79
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:53,560
to conflate personality traits,
uh,

80
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:58,650
which I am a optimist I think in
person by personality with um,

81
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:00,550
sort of,
um,

82
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:05,080
how to put this exactly the kind
of characteristics of our species.

83
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:08,410
So I think we, for example,
we are cooperative species.

84
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:11,140
We cooperate with strangers,
which is very unusual.

85
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:13,720
Other animals will cooperate with kin,

86
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:17,920
but we also cooperate with non-kin
rare in the animal kingdom.

87
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,870
So I don't know how you
would describe that.

88
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,280
I wouldn't call that optimism exactly.

89
00:05:21,281 --> 00:05:23,500
I would call that something
good cooperativity.

90
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,080
That's a characteristic of our species.

91
00:05:26,081 --> 00:05:28,240
And then above and beyond that
we also have personalities.

92
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,670
Some of us are optimistic, some of us
are not. But all of us, for example,

93
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:37,840
love our mates. So here's an
interesting idea why, why do we do that?

94
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,420
Other animals to have sex with each other.

95
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:44,020
We're not the only animals that do this,
but we also love each other.

96
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,800
We formed sentimental attachments to
the people we are having sex with.

97
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,030
We are also tend to be monogamous.
And that we can be by monogamous,

98
00:05:52,031 --> 00:05:54,820
I don't mean social monogamy
or even heterosexual monogamy.

99
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:58,490
I mean we form a longterm attachment
to the person we're having sex with.

100
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,810
Whether it's polygynous, polyandrous,
straight or gay, doesn't matter.

101
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:07,400
We love the person we're with. Why?
Why do we evolve this capacity? Well,

102
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,190
I talk a little bit about that. Why
would do that? And it's universal.

103
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:13,310
Everywhere in the world you go,
no matter what the marital system,

104
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,540
people love their partners instantly.
Plus we get too proud of ourselves. Birds.

105
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:21,200
90% of bird species are also monogamous.
But anyway,

106
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,320
so the point is is that there are all
these qualities we have or we befriend

107
00:06:24,321 --> 00:06:27,680
each other. Why do we do that? We, we
don't just reproduce with each other.

108
00:06:27,681 --> 00:06:32,570
We form longterm non reproductive unions
with other members of our species.

109
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,830
Namely, we have friends. This is very
rare in the animal kingdom. We do it.

110
00:06:37,250 --> 00:06:42,170
Certain primates do it, whales, orcas
and dolphins do it. And elephants do it.

111
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:47,870
Why? Well, there's a reason we do it and
it's a wonderful quality of our species.

112
00:06:47,871 --> 00:06:52,340
So do you think societies
should be organized to help
these institutions? I mean,

113
00:06:52,341 --> 00:06:56,980
this is where I could throw out Jordan
Peterson's enforced monogamy and you know,

114
00:06:57,150 --> 00:07:00,470
people had a field day with that and all
he really was saying was that societies

115
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,910
should kind of look at marriages,

116
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,460
it Justin thing because
it's a foundational thing
that will help you build a

117
00:07:04,461 --> 00:07:06,380
family,
has helped you build it for full of life.

118
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,450
Do you agree that that's part of what
would lead to a good society or which

119
00:07:10,451 --> 00:07:14,250
should be instilled? Well, I say
I talk about that in the book. Uh,

120
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:19,450
when I talk about is that we should be
very wary of efforts to engineer society

121
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:22,850
in opposition to our evolved proclivities.

122
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,280
So societies that try for example,
to prevent loving attachments.

123
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,350
I talk about communes,
for example,

124
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:34,550
communes have a problem because in a
commune they want you to feel loyalty to

125
00:07:34,551 --> 00:07:35,750
the group,
to the commune.

126
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,720
So therefore feeling of love
for your partner is a threat.

127
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:42,800
So many communes have gone
two opposite extremes,

128
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:44,880
both of which are attempting
to solve the same problem.

129
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:49,280
So on the one hand you have the shakers
who say no sex, no loving attachment.

130
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,040
On the other hand,
you have comments that say polyamory,

131
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:54,290
everyone loves everybody or
can have sex with everyone.

132
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:58,070
Both of those are attempting to sever an
individualistic connection between two

133
00:07:58,071 --> 00:07:59,690
people,
which therefore you,

134
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:03,200
and the same thing happens in eastern
Germany where they tried to several

135
00:08:03,201 --> 00:08:04,940
connections with friends,
right? You don't,

136
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:08,880
you who my friends could be spying on
me or ratting out to the Stazi. It's,

137
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,930
it's sitting there for a second
cause it's a fascinating idea.

138
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:16,010
The same force at work. Whether you say
to people don't have any release. Yes,

139
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,600
he's actually the same course as have
relations with everybody. I mean that's,

140
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,120
that's not something that the
average person is thinking about.

141
00:08:23,121 --> 00:08:25,390
But if you're just having relations
with everybody, yes, you're actually,

142
00:08:25,391 --> 00:08:28,580
I don't think there's want special
nobody. That's right. So they're both,

143
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:31,220
both of those extreme strategies
are tackling the same problem,

144
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:35,210
which is the threat to the collectivity
of individual relationships,

145
00:08:35,211 --> 00:08:37,160
whether it's with your partner,
your sexual partner,

146
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,650
or as I was about to say
with your friends or others.

147
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,980
So collectivist societies will often,
every week everyone call you comrade.

148
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:46,280
So everyone is your friend.
Same as having polyamory, right?

149
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:50,330
It's like the polyamorous equivalent
to everyone dresses the same.

150
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,970
We all call each other friend. No
individual identity. It's a kind of,

151
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:55,220
it's a kind of science fiction,
dystopia.

152
00:08:56,190 --> 00:09:01,140
So the argument I make is that we should
be very wary of efforts to engineer

153
00:09:01,141 --> 00:09:04,830
society in opposition to our interests.
There are bound to fail is my argument.

154
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,780
Now there are brief moments of time and
certain cultures where you can apply a

155
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:13,950
tremendous cultural force and suppress
some of these innate tendencies.

156
00:09:13,951 --> 00:09:15,990
So for example,
I talk about the not,

157
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:20,240
so if you look at societies around
the world that the, the, the,

158
00:09:20,241 --> 00:09:24,750
the expression of love for your is seen
universally except perhaps with one

159
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:25,261
exception,

160
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:30,261
which is the not people in the Himalayas
who've organized society around a brief

161
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:33,360
sexual encounters.
You're not supposed to love your partner.

162
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,660
And so this is a matrilineal society.
The women stay at home.

163
00:09:36,661 --> 00:09:40,890
The men will go out at night basically
cruising for dates. So there'll be like,

164
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:43,770
and it's not uncommon for every woman
to have had sex with every man in the

165
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:47,700
village. And, uh, the, the
men will be knocking on the
door, take me tonight, take me,

166
00:09:47,701 --> 00:09:50,220
and she'll pick this guy tonight
and they'll have a brief fling.

167
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:52,170
Maybe he can come back.
And at any moment,

168
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:55,210
either of them can break off the
relationship, but even in it.

169
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,280
And so there's a whole complex cultural
edifice. Marco Polo describes this.

170
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:00,810
When he gets to China,

171
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:04,200
the Chinese government thought
it was sapping productivity,

172
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,240
that everyone was having sex all the
time. They were, they were saying,

173
00:10:07,241 --> 00:10:12,010
and we need to stop this. They tried to
stamp it out, but it still has existed.

174
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:15,900
This, this culture, this, this cultural
set of rules. But even in this society,

175
00:10:15,901 --> 00:10:20,090
there are people who want the
forbidden fruit of having a,

176
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,660
a committed relationship and who flee
for because they want to be with each

177
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:26,040
other,
forsaking all others.

178
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,190
So even the society cannot fully
suppressed this desire for love.

179
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,080
And I look also at friendship and
show that there are some societies,

180
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:37,140
very few which seem to have no,
um,

181
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,050
experience of this notion of friendship.

182
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:44,160
But those societies are extremely rare
and also have certain idiosyncrasies.

183
00:10:44,550 --> 00:10:49,530
So the simple way of saying that there's
basically an evolutionary force that no

184
00:10:49,531 --> 00:10:53,940
matter how far you go to one extreme,
it has to sort of push you. Yes.

185
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,430
Or that it's extremely difficult
to entirely suppressed.

186
00:10:56,630 --> 00:11:00,180
You can through force of arms, you know,
you can slaughter populations, you can,

187
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:04,480
you can, you know, you can, uh, you
can um, have very elaborate, uh,

188
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,180
sort of autocratic governments.

189
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,260
You can have procedures or other highly
evolved stylized cultures that have

190
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:11,220
cotton to this.
For example,

191
00:11:11,221 --> 00:11:15,180
there's a play is universal and children
and there's one society that banning

192
00:11:15,181 --> 00:11:20,181
people who really think play is awful
and really try to suppress the innate

193
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,290
tendency of children to play.

194
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,710
So there's very little play among
children in that society, but it's,

195
00:11:25,711 --> 00:11:30,480
these societies are rare and they require
very large cultural forces to suppress

196
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,520
these innate tendencies.
You know,

197
00:11:32,521 --> 00:11:35,100
I was thinking as we've
been talking about this,

198
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:39,540
that there's something
also sort of related to our
political situation right now

199
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:42,300
about this, that it seems like we're
sort of going off the deep end.

200
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:45,630
I would say the argue more on
the left at the moment. Um,

201
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,810
but I guess if I'm an optimist here and
I described myself as a world weary opt

202
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,580
that you're saying at some point and
whether Jonathan Haidt says it's two years

203
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,630
down the road or whenever it is,

204
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,040
but at some point that will eventually
have to rebound. Right? Cause sure.

205
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,550
What is it? If it doesn't rebound
then, then that's just, no,

206
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:07,120
I don't think Jordan Peterson would say
is just chaos. Right? Yeah. I think,

207
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:11,020
I think, I mean, I, I can't,
I think we're in for another,

208
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:14,170
I think there'll be about five or 10
years our society is going to go through a

209
00:12:14,171 --> 00:12:18,370
long period of, of, of acrimony. No,

210
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,870
I have to say I'm not, you know, um, sort
of don't have a wig ish view of history.

211
00:12:22,871 --> 00:12:25,870
Like, oh, in the olden days, you know,
uh, everything was great. I mean,

212
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:29,680
let's not forget we had, we had
colonialism, we had slavery, we had a,

213
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:33,100
we had die anti immigrant sentiment
forever and are because even vote,

214
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:37,140
I mean women couldn't vote. Exactly. Do
you have gay rights? You know. Uh, so,

215
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:39,410
so there's always been this,
uh,

216
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:44,520
this incredible disconnect between our
wonderful principles in our society.

217
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,810
All men are created equal.
You know,

218
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,140
the bill of rights can bring tears
to your eyes if you read it, but a,

219
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:55,120
and the fact that we didn't always,
but we are, I think getting better.

220
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:57,370
This is the progressive in
me, you know, the society,

221
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,390
we're getting better and better.

222
00:12:58,391 --> 00:13:00,550
We are expanding the franchise
to more and more people.

223
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:04,720
We are opening up our democracy.
We are, we are extending rights,

224
00:13:04,721 --> 00:13:09,130
we are extending liberties. Um,
now of course the libertarian,

225
00:13:09,131 --> 00:13:13,300
we'll say the government doesn't grant
liberty. We are protecting liberties are,

226
00:13:13,301 --> 00:13:16,480
you know, we are trying to stay out, but
it took me right out of my head. Exactly.

227
00:13:16,481 --> 00:13:17,620
And I agree with that actually.

228
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:22,360
I don't think the liberties for the
governments to grant, but anyway, so,

229
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:25,940
uh, but I think our society's is
getting better in these regards. Um,

230
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:30,260
I don't think you can, you could
say otherwise. So I think that we,

231
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,800
we will get there.
It just is gonna take some time.

232
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:36,390
So how do you navigate through
a messy time like this?

233
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:40,390
If you're someone that's just kind of
awake to these ideas and you want to be

234
00:13:40,391 --> 00:13:42,400
able to express your individuality,

235
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:47,910
but there is a mob or a morphous
machine that is silencing things,

236
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:49,900
or as you just said before,

237
00:13:49,901 --> 00:13:52,870
that you don't want a society that's going
to push down things that were sort of

238
00:13:52,871 --> 00:13:55,840
always accepted for a long time.
I'm slightly paraphrasing, but,

239
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:58,390
so right now it's like
if you call a man a man,

240
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,270
they'll tell you you're a transfer.
These, these basic things that seem,

241
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,730
now we hear about them constantly as if,

242
00:14:03,731 --> 00:14:08,170
as if this is just the most
important thing happening. And No,

243
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:10,060
I think there are other, this is
the other thing. I think that,

244
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,940
I think there are certain segments of
Twitter and certain segments of our

245
00:14:12,941 --> 00:14:17,170
society that have made these particular
topics and others a very central,

246
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:19,150
and everyone, you know,
the people who want to,

247
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:21,670
who are concerned about climate
change or people who come as I am,

248
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:25,030
there are people who are concerned about
the private practice prison industry as

249
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:27,310
I am. These are two hot
topics at Harvard right now.

250
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:30,730
So there was a heckler situation
where the president of Harvard was,

251
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:32,320
was not allowed to speak about,

252
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:35,140
he was at an educational conference
and these groups that were opposed to

253
00:14:35,141 --> 00:14:39,250
private ownership of prisons, which I am
and, uh, concern about climate change,

254
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:43,000
which I also am, they shut the president
down, which is ridiculous, you know?

255
00:14:43,001 --> 00:14:45,880
And why did they shut him down?
Cause he thought he wasn't taking,

256
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:47,820
paying enough attention to their concerns.

257
00:14:47,821 --> 00:14:50,710
So you have this kind of
rule by minorities, right?

258
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:53,750
Where am I in a vocal minority can
hijack the conversation about whatever

259
00:14:53,751 --> 00:14:55,340
particular topic they have.

260
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:57,550
So everyone's entitled to
have their topics of interest.

261
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,920
But that doesn't mean you have
to go along with it right?

262
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:04,280
You can have your own ideas about the
topic or you can switch conversation.

263
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:06,530
Like I'm not interested in
talking about trans rights today.

264
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:08,240
Today I'd like to talk about,
uh,

265
00:15:08,270 --> 00:15:11,450
how motor vehicle accidents are the one
of the leading killers or the opioid

266
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:15,380
crisis is another important dilemma.
Or the guns. You know, we, we, we have,

267
00:15:15,410 --> 00:15:18,830
we have more people are killed by guns
in our society per capita than any

268
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:22,460
society in the world almost.
It's craziness. So, um,

269
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,820
so all of these are different
people have different, anyway,

270
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:28,370
the point I'm making is that if you
wish to engage in a conversation with

271
00:15:28,371 --> 00:15:30,320
someone about a topic
they feel strongly about,

272
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:33,890
I think it's incumbent on you to
listen to their arguments, think,

273
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:35,423
and then respond.

274
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:38,960
So do you think there's an evolutionary
reason that people either basically

275
00:15:38,961 --> 00:15:42,200
become sort of government
people or freedom people?

276
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,450
So the way you were laying out that
argument, it's not going to go,

277
00:15:44,451 --> 00:15:47,870
it's like you were telling me your
progressive, uh, sort of prayed,

278
00:15:47,871 --> 00:15:50,660
which I have to do all the time.
But then you basically said, yeah,

279
00:15:50,661 --> 00:15:54,050
but all these things can be accomplished
by libertarianism if you don't believe

280
00:15:54,051 --> 00:15:56,390
that it's the government's
job to give these things.

281
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:01,540
So that basically it sort of shows why
the progressive's are the ones screaming

282
00:16:01,551 --> 00:16:05,690
on campus all the time and in and in
larger society because they think the

283
00:16:05,691 --> 00:16:09,530
system can be perfected to
get it however they want it.

284
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:13,490
Where the Libertarians, I think
just say I'm very wearable. Yeah,

285
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:16,340
I don't think the system can be perfect.
So let's just keep it out of our lives.

286
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:19,010
I mean, I think, you know, which,
which idea I'm more sympathetic to,

287
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,600
but do you think there's a reason that,

288
00:16:20,910 --> 00:16:23,790
well, I heard that,
yes. Okay. So there are,

289
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,730
there are a set of ideas about where do,

290
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,590
where do so, so the content of
political beliefs, like whether,

291
00:16:31,591 --> 00:16:36,030
for example, you believe in, um,
whatever it is, pick, I know any,

292
00:16:36,130 --> 00:16:40,710
the, the, the belief you have about a
particular topic because of course not

293
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,120
evolutionarily shaped,

294
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,830
but there is a kind of evolutionary
shaping to whether or not you are more

295
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:49,680
conservative or liberal. Let's it,
that's what I'm trying to get. Yeah.

296
00:16:49,681 --> 00:16:54,030
So some people are more rule abiding and
there's an, there's a good, for example,

297
00:16:54,031 --> 00:16:57,180
children that learn children that listen
to their parents might be more likely

298
00:16:57,181 --> 00:17:01,560
to survive. So listening to your parents
is actually a good survival strategy.

299
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:05,430
On the other hand,
too much obedience is also bad.

300
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,530
You can be led like a lemming off a cliff.

301
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,860
So occasionally you need to not
listen to what everyone else is doing.

302
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,080
So both are advantageous and we're,

303
00:17:13,230 --> 00:17:17,160
we're equipped with both abilities and
there's variation across people and it's

304
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,090
a complicated topic.

305
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:21,570
So nobody thinks there's like a genetic
background to being a Democrat or a

306
00:17:21,571 --> 00:17:22,201
Republican.

307
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:26,310
But there is evidence that there is a
kind of genetic predisposition to certain

308
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,600
political polls.

309
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,520
But what I would say though is
that we live in a plural democracy.

310
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:36,240
So you're going to have to
compromise, you know, uh,

311
00:17:36,241 --> 00:17:38,870
if you're libertarian who
thinks x, Y, and Z and you're,

312
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:42,420
you're going to be in a society with
other people who think different things.

313
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:47,790
We have decided to come together as a
people and vote to resolve our disputes.

314
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,830
And t by the way,
not to vote,

315
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,700
but to educate ourselves and to teach
each other stuff. Right. To communicate.

316
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,830
Right. The founders recognize
that in order for us to
get to the wisest decision,

317
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,100
we have to have free and
open conversation. Right.
Well, I think that's why,

318
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,380
which I support. I do hear
of. Cool. Of course you do.

319
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,310
But that's why so many people are so
concerned about this at the college layer.

320
00:18:08,311 --> 00:18:10,590
You know, I'll hear some of
our critics will say, oh,

321
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:13,320
they're just obsessed with
what's happening on colleges
and they're handing over

322
00:18:13,321 --> 00:18:16,380
all this power to the, to the
mob oncologists. But then,

323
00:18:16,410 --> 00:18:18,990
but then every day we
see it then leak out.

324
00:18:18,991 --> 00:18:21,090
And also these people will
be the leaders of tomorrow.

325
00:18:21,091 --> 00:18:23,730
That's why I don't think it's,
I don't think it's overestimating.

326
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:26,130
And even if it is a small minority,
which we agree,

327
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,050
the amount of power they can extend,

328
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:33,120
they definitely used to be way
disproportionate to the numbers for sure.

329
00:18:33,121 --> 00:18:34,400
I would agree with that.
Uh,

330
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:37,620
I would agree that the vast majority of
students on any college campus just want

331
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:39,990
to get a good education. And, um,

332
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:43,620
and many of them have other political
concerns other than some of the ones that

333
00:18:43,621 --> 00:18:48,390
are getting a lot of attention. So, um,
you know, even for example, even with the,

334
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:52,320
you know, so you know, people are
concerned about the opiod crisis.

335
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:55,110
They're concerned about gun violence,
are concerned about police brutality.

336
00:18:55,111 --> 00:18:56,730
They're concerned about
the climate change,

337
00:18:56,731 --> 00:18:59,790
are concerned about all of these issues,
which I think warrant concerned.

338
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,660
We can perfect our society, we can be
better than we are. And I generally,

339
00:19:03,661 --> 00:19:07,140
we can perfect it. I, I do better than
we are. We think we can perfect it. No,

340
00:19:07,141 --> 00:19:08,940
I don't think we can
have a perfect society,

341
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:12,710
but I think we can make it better than it
is. So by perfect, I mean improve. Okay.

342
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:15,870
Um, so I think we can make
our society better and better.

343
00:19:15,871 --> 00:19:19,170
I don't think we're done
yet. I think there's still
deficits in our, for example,

344
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,430
our spending is crazy. I'm going to
think we do better fiscal fiscally. Um,

345
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:27,030
you know, I think we have, we have
a carceral state. We have, I think,

346
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:30,000
I think this number's right,
that upper on a per capita basis.

347
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:33,750
We have as many people in prisons as
Stalinist Russia. I mean it's insane.

348
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,141
You know,

349
00:19:34,141 --> 00:19:38,550
we have millions of Americans are in
prison and it's way out of proportion to

350
00:19:38,551 --> 00:19:42,000
other countries. Um, you know, there
are lots of things about our society.

351
00:19:42,001 --> 00:19:42,721
We have very high,

352
00:19:42,721 --> 00:19:46,020
we have century long heights of
income inequality in our society.

353
00:19:46,290 --> 00:19:49,680
There's a big debate about whether that
is an unavoidable side effect of growth.

354
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,940
You know,
everyone is better off.

355
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:52,980
So what do we care if the
income is unequally distributed?

356
00:19:53,310 --> 00:19:57,840
But I think I tend to be agree with the
critics that are concerned that this

357
00:19:57,841 --> 00:20:01,950
level of inequalities not sustainable
to have a common wheel to like have a

358
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,960
sense that everyone is
a part of the society.

359
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:06,430
We've had no income growth in the middle.
Uh,

360
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:10,410
like the meeting American has seen in a
generation and see no growth in wages.

361
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,710
Right? So the bottom actually has raised
and we've watched the top go bananas,

362
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:16,590
but the middle of it, no,
the bottom hasn't even gone
up that much either. Well,

363
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,560
let me, let me put it this way, they have
absolutely not been living standards,

364
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:23,250
right? So like a poor American today is
vastly better off than a poor American a

365
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:27,030
generation ago. But in terms of wage
growth, there's been very little growth.

366
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,810
My understanding of statistics and most
of the accumulation of wealth in the

367
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:35,280
last generation has gone to the top,
top 1% top 0.1% anyway,

368
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,340
there's a debate about why that happened.
The technological advance.

369
00:20:38,341 --> 00:20:39,960
Do we have the same thing during
the industrial revolution?

370
00:20:39,961 --> 00:20:42,060
These are important deep ideas,
which as a society,

371
00:20:42,061 --> 00:20:47,061
we should be debating and discussing
what's the best for our society anyway.

372
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,590
Third, these are all bunch more
important topics in my view,

373
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:54,580
and have much more bearing on the
wellbeing of our society than a lot of the

374
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:56,140
other crap that gets so much attention.

375
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,070
So what's the evolutionary
reason for that? I mean,

376
00:21:00,071 --> 00:21:03,010
your previous book was about social media,
right?

377
00:21:03,011 --> 00:21:06,400
And so there's gotta be some link there.
I mean,

378
00:21:06,401 --> 00:21:09,760
and that's where he gets back to what I
was saying about depressing local news.

379
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:13,150
I don't know. I mean, I'm trying to talk
about things that I think are important.

380
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:17,410
Um, you know, I, I, um, I'm
doing my part as best I can,

381
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:24,500
who's done a society in a more quote
unquote good way than we have right now.

382
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:28,810
So, uh, so the book, so I don't, I don't,
I'm not, it's not a work of history,

383
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:31,900
so I'm not, I'm not, I don't
primarily talk about, um,

384
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:37,480
like the last 200 or even 2000 years
of human evolution or experience.

385
00:21:37,481 --> 00:21:42,100
I'm much more interested in the long
arc of our history. And if you look at,

386
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,910
um, forge your societies around
the world as I do, and you,

387
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,260
and you look at their qualities,
you will see that again and again.

388
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:52,730
These societies have these
desirable properties. They,

389
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,660
there's variation of course,
and how cooperative they are.

390
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:59,830
And there's variation in marital systems
and there's variation in sustenance

391
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:03,370
systems. There's a lot of variation.
But also there's a lot of commonality.

392
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,700
And those common features I argue are
universal. See, here's the other argument.

393
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:12,670
So the argument is that there are these
universal qualities that are shared

394
00:22:12,671 --> 00:22:16,060
across all societies.
They are shaped by our evolution.

395
00:22:16,061 --> 00:22:17,880
They're not just a product
of historical forces.

396
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:20,390
Can you just list out a couple
of them again just so, so love.

397
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:25,090
So love a friendship. Uh, cooperation.
We're cooperative species.

398
00:22:25,091 --> 00:22:28,330
You will be kind to a stranger
on the first, you know, uh,

399
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,580
teaching the fact that we
teach each other stuff,

400
00:22:30,581 --> 00:22:33,760
which actually is the ultimate source
of all our wealth and wellbeing.

401
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:38,970
The fact that we can accumulate knowledge
and distributed across time and place.

402
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,320
So I can tell people far away something
and when I'm born I benefit from all the

403
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:46,270
other knowledge that has
been produced for the men.

404
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:48,520
Did hundreds of thousands
of years before me.

405
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:51,100
Is this punishing and I would
again argue this is why,

406
00:22:51,101 --> 00:22:54,610
what's happening on college. Yes. I
would argue, I would agree with that.

407
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:55,391
There's a connection there.

408
00:22:55,391 --> 00:22:59,050
Like our capacity to teach and to
create environments in which we foster

409
00:22:59,051 --> 00:23:02,680
teaching and learning are crucial anyway.
Also mild hierarchy.

410
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:06,310
We are a species that we cannot
survive with no hierarchy.

411
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,650
We need some leaders and I discussed
that but we also don't like too much

412
00:23:11,651 --> 00:23:14,140
hierarchy.
So when you get too autocratic of power,

413
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,110
the little guys down below band
together and basically kill.

414
00:23:17,111 --> 00:23:20,950
So Richard Wrangham has been making this
argument that we self domesticated as a

415
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:24,660
species that over millennia bands of
weaker members would say, you know,

416
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,640
that guy's too powerful and he's getting
all the dates and this we're going to

417
00:23:27,641 --> 00:23:31,270
kill him. And basically they did. So
we got more peaceful as time went by.

418
00:23:31,271 --> 00:23:34,810
Is One of the ideas mild
hierarchy in group bias.

419
00:23:34,811 --> 00:23:38,760
So some tribalism is
unavoidable in human beings. Um,

420
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:42,130
this capacity for identity that
we discussed at the beginning.

421
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,520
These are all qualities. So identity,
love, friendship, social networks,

422
00:23:46,521 --> 00:23:49,520
mild hierarchy, Ingroup bias,
teaching and social learning.

423
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:51,860
These are seen everywhere and they lie.

424
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:56,180
And I believe that the core of a
good society and, and institutions,

425
00:23:56,730 --> 00:24:00,860
uh, uh, try to suppress those
at their own peril. Yeah.

426
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,500
How can you be sort of,

427
00:24:03,501 --> 00:24:08,501
have a healthy dose of in group preference
without starting to fall into the

428
00:24:08,751 --> 00:24:12,390
trap of identity politics. So for example,
you're a Greek guys who grew up in a,

429
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,870
in a Greek family. Did I love Greek? My
best child friends growing up is great.

430
00:24:16,910 --> 00:24:18,740
We're still great friends.
Um,

431
00:24:18,741 --> 00:24:22,250
I love Greek culture and the way it
opened the Greek and the interest in

432
00:24:22,290 --> 00:24:24,830
intellectual wisdom and I love fed
cheese and all of those things.

433
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:27,830
SPANAKOPITA dialogue. Yes. Great. So,

434
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:30,040
and you can open a Greek
restaurant as far as I'm concerned,

435
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,070
I wouldn't object to that.

436
00:24:31,071 --> 00:24:36,071
That'd be [inaudible] that port,

437
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:38,210
that poor girl. It's insane. Yeah.

438
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,060
It's total Chinese restaurants without
being Chinese. And then they're coming in,

439
00:24:41,061 --> 00:24:43,290
not just that there was the,
there's the person in, in,

440
00:24:43,291 --> 00:24:45,620
in Oregon that had a Mexican restaurant.
Yes.

441
00:24:45,730 --> 00:24:49,810
There's so many examples
of this is unbelievable. So
how can you say love uncle?

442
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:52,280
I just told you all the reasons. I
love your history, but let's pretend,

443
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,590
let's say it's roughly the same
feelings about your own culture.

444
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:58,340
How can you embrace all of those
things without falling into the trap of

445
00:24:58,341 --> 00:24:59,210
identity politics?

446
00:24:59,211 --> 00:25:02,450
Because I think that's where a lot
of people are at these days. Okay.

447
00:25:02,451 --> 00:25:05,320
So I have a couple of ideas and responses
that the first thing I would say is,

448
00:25:05,321 --> 00:25:08,540
is that that this is one
of the both the most,

449
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:13,070
it's still not totally clear how
we evolve to have this capacity.

450
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,590
It's felt that this ingroup bias,
this I,

451
00:25:15,591 --> 00:25:19,760
this tribalism that we have was
crucial to our ability to cooperate.

452
00:25:19,761 --> 00:25:23,630
That the ability to draw a distinction
between us and them, the challenge,

453
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:27,410
the problem that, that this ability
that we evolved. So, so there's,

454
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,550
whether we cooperate with each other
and whether we are xenophobic or

455
00:25:31,551 --> 00:25:35,570
tribalistic or draw distinctions
between us and them. And this property,

456
00:25:35,571 --> 00:25:40,400
this tribalism property is a property
that reduces the scale of interaction.

457
00:25:40,401 --> 00:25:43,040
So instead of you having to
cooperate with everybody,

458
00:25:43,850 --> 00:25:48,320
you only cooperate with your guys.
And this is innate in human beings.

459
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:51,530
And it is felt that this ability to
draw distinction between us and then was

460
00:25:51,531 --> 00:25:56,000
crucial in the emergence of
the variability to cooperate
with other people. Okay.

461
00:25:56,270 --> 00:26:00,560
So they're tied, they're connected
to each other. What's depressing is,

462
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,760
is it necessary to hate the other group?
Why can't you just love your own group?

463
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:05,630
Right?

464
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:08,830
So why could you be indifferent to the
other group or even admire it and they've

465
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:10,880
got to them,
they're not us.

466
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:15,740
We like them or we are in different to
them, right? Why do we have to kill them,

467
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:18,840
right? Like why, you know, where does
the killing part come from? Right?

468
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:20,060
And this is complicated.

469
00:26:20,061 --> 00:26:23,390
We don't exactly know like where
the hostility comes in weather,

470
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,610
but we tend to see this hostility.
So for example,

471
00:26:25,611 --> 00:26:28,040
there are famous experiments that
have been done with little toddlers.

472
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,280
You can randomly assign toddlers
to different tee shirts.

473
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:34,640
You can test at the toddlers
understand that this was random,

474
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:38,270
that there was no merit to whether they
got the yellow t shirt or the green t

475
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:41,480
shirt. And yet as soon as you give
them the t shirts, the yellow t shirt,

476
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,850
kids say those green t shirt children,
they shouldn't have toys.

477
00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:49,590
They're bad children. They don't
deserve anything. It's insane.

478
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,080
Like you can see this is called
the minimal group experiments.

479
00:26:52,081 --> 00:26:56,250
So the most trivial of interventions
you can elicit in us this, this, this,

480
00:26:56,251 --> 00:26:58,800
dislike of the other.
However,

481
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,380
this is not the only tool that
evolution has given us to live together,

482
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:08,940
this disability to draw the
boundary between us and them. Uh,

483
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,230
there are a couple of other tools,

484
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:12,030
and before I tell you what
those two other tools are,

485
00:27:12,031 --> 00:27:15,480
let me just say one other thing.
So if you think of our society is,

486
00:27:15,481 --> 00:27:18,900
here's our whole society and
here's our groups in the middle,

487
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,850
and here are individuals at the bottom.

488
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,670
If you're struggling with
the problem of tribalism,

489
00:27:23,671 --> 00:27:25,380
there are basically two ways you can go.

490
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:30,690
You can go up a level and broaden
the boundary. And you can say,

491
00:27:30,691 --> 00:27:33,900
for example, we are all
Americans, right? You can say,

492
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:36,990
because we all have the
capacity to draw the boundary,

493
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,320
we are evolved to have that capacity.
Now you're just say,

494
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:42,810
actually these little group boundaries
that we were paying attention to,

495
00:27:42,811 --> 00:27:43,260
they're not,

496
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:47,430
they're not relevant and basically take
all the ethnic divisions or other than

497
00:27:47,431 --> 00:27:50,640
the religious or immigrant or whatever
it is, and we're all American.

498
00:27:50,641 --> 00:27:54,240
We're all Americans. Other group
at yes. At a higher level. Exactly.

499
00:27:54,330 --> 00:27:57,930
So you move up a level and [inaudible]
face tribalism by appeal to larger groups.

500
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,300
This has been part of our history
since the beginning to talk.

501
00:28:00,301 --> 00:28:02,670
They'll talks about this where
nature of joiners, you know,

502
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:06,090
anyone can be an American, that that
itself is part of the American project.

503
00:28:06,091 --> 00:28:06,930
It's astonishing.

504
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:11,700
The belief which I share that anyone can
be an American is a statement that the

505
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:12,630
groups don't matter.

506
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:16,350
Anyone can be an American and you just
have to buy our liberal principles and

507
00:28:16,351 --> 00:28:20,300
then you could be an American. Okay. Even
though there's a debate about that. Yes,

508
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:20,910
yes.

509
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:25,200
But there's also an interesting parable
to Trump here because at some level it's

510
00:28:25,201 --> 00:28:27,600
like he's talking about
a miracle all the time.

511
00:28:27,601 --> 00:28:29,610
So that is the higher
group for all of this.

512
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,480
And yet I suspect your feelings on
what he's doing. Some other things,

513
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:35,820
probably not. No, but I would be
like, anyone can be an American.

514
00:28:35,821 --> 00:28:40,821
If you come to our country and you work
and are productive and and obey our laws

515
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:43,890
and our constitution, you're an
American as far as I'm concerned.

516
00:28:44,250 --> 00:28:46,770
It didn't matter whether you
came from Mexico or you know,

517
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:51,360
one of the four Mexican countries
as he's, you know, anyway, okay,

518
00:28:51,361 --> 00:28:54,980
so a whole other video, whole other
show. Okay. So, so, okay, so, so,

519
00:28:54,990 --> 00:28:56,100
but another solution,

520
00:28:56,160 --> 00:29:00,090
okay to the group is of the
tribalism is trickle down a level.

521
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,950
Remember we talked
earlier about individuals.

522
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:04,980
So now you can say instead of looking
at people as which groups are they a

523
00:29:04,981 --> 00:29:07,320
member of,
you look at them as individual people.

524
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:09,300
And this too has been
a part of our history.

525
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:12,320
So Martin Luther King's
famous sentiment, I, you know,

526
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,450
I look forward to a society in which
people are judged by the content of their

527
00:29:15,451 --> 00:29:19,410
character rather than the color of their
skin isn't appeal to our individuality.

528
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,470
Seeing groups don't matter.
Individuals matter. So,

529
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,760
so if we're struggling with tribalism
and go up or we can go down both help,

530
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,410
however lateral to that point,
there's another set of ideas,

531
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:36,411
which is tribalism is not even the only
tool we have in order to reduce the

532
00:29:36,781 --> 00:29:38,460
sense of scale and to cooperate.

533
00:29:38,461 --> 00:29:41,800
So natural selection is also
equipped us with friendship.

534
00:29:42,790 --> 00:29:43,960
Friendship.
The real,

535
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:48,100
one of the reasons it is felt we evolved
the capacity for friendship is again,

536
00:29:48,101 --> 00:29:51,610
to reduce the sense of scale.
So instead of now being in a big group,

537
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:53,560
everyone has to cooperate with everyone.

538
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:58,390
Each of us has a subset of people who
are our friends that we cooperate with.

539
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:02,180
So it's similar to tribalism but different
because now instead of defining it by

540
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:06,040
group, membership is defined by each
person has their particular friends.

541
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:11,310
So this is another tool that we innately
have that we can use to sustain our

542
00:30:11,381 --> 00:30:15,520
cooperative instincts and
push aside the tribalism.

543
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:20,400
So how much do you think on a day, day,
day, and a day to day basis? Are We, uh,

544
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,870
normally I get the water for people.

545
00:30:21,871 --> 00:30:25,710
You have to be so wrapped up there that
I forgot, uh, on a day to day basis,

546
00:30:25,711 --> 00:30:30,711
how much movement do we as individuals
have to sort of either go around,

547
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,100
let's say go around are a evolutionary

548
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,660
behavior? Well, I don't think, okay.

549
00:30:39,661 --> 00:30:42,590
So I think I do believe in free
will. I mean, I think you have, um,

550
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,520
some capacity to self mastery and make
your own decisions in life and your own,

551
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:48,593
you know,
um,

552
00:30:49,050 --> 00:30:53,850
but you're also born with certain innate
qualities and you're also born a human

553
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:57,090
being, which is you're part
of a particular species
that has a particular set of

554
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:01,680
characteristics. Um, so I,

555
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:05,970
I think that as individuals, you know,
we, we have some control over how we act.

556
00:31:05,971 --> 00:31:10,971
I don't think our individual actions will
individually change the whole society.

557
00:31:11,671 --> 00:31:15,570
But I think if each of us is
attempting to do the right thing,

558
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:20,310
I think ultimately that
makes things better. Look,
there's a lot of famous ideas.

559
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:25,920
Uh, so a Viktor Frankl who was
in the concentration camps, his,

560
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:27,210
his wife was killed.

561
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:31,500
He survives the Nazi
concentration camps and he goes,

562
00:31:31,590 --> 00:31:35,670
and he writes a famous book called Man's
search for meaning after he's liberated

563
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,770
it right to 10 days after his liberation.

564
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,190
And he talks about how he came to the
recognition that even in this camp,

565
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:44,490
in the most vile possible circumstance
where his life was threatened every day,

566
00:31:44,491 --> 00:31:47,430
where people were dying all the time, he
was starving to death. He had no shoes.

567
00:31:47,431 --> 00:31:50,400
It was in the winter. I mean,
it was a slave. Even there,

568
00:31:50,401 --> 00:31:53,960
he recognized that he was the master
of his own internal state. You know,

569
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:58,800
that how he saw the world was
something that was in his own control.

570
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:03,210
So he was able to find a sense of
self discipline and mastery even in an

571
00:32:03,211 --> 00:32:08,040
environment in which the structures
around him were engineered to crush him,

572
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:12,530
um, to kill him. So, so
I think that there are,

573
00:32:12,540 --> 00:32:13,950
and there are many examples of this,
I mean,

574
00:32:13,951 --> 00:32:18,951
another one of my favorite examples is
Buddhist monks that were studied at MIT

575
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,000
years ago. I think I'm going to get
the facts of this work correct. So, so,

576
00:32:24,001 --> 00:32:27,360
so they were very interested in how
meditation changes the structure of your

577
00:32:27,361 --> 00:32:32,361
brain and how are these monks so able to
be so peaceful in these very stressful

578
00:32:33,571 --> 00:32:35,520
circumstances.
And they scan them,

579
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:37,920
they put them in the MRI scanner and
they looked at different parts of their

580
00:32:37,921 --> 00:32:42,921
brain in which parts were enhanced or
diminished compared to other more ordinary

581
00:32:44,091 --> 00:32:46,190
mortals. And uh, and then,

582
00:32:46,191 --> 00:32:48,950
and they saw the different parts of the
brain and Buddhist monks were different

583
00:32:48,951 --> 00:32:49,910
than the rest of us.

584
00:32:50,270 --> 00:32:53,540
But what interested me was not even the
neuroanatomical discoveries that were in

585
00:32:53,541 --> 00:32:55,580
that paper,
but it was the interviews with the monks.

586
00:32:56,030 --> 00:32:57,860
And so at the monks would
say was that for example,

587
00:32:57,861 --> 00:33:02,861
let's say you and I are in traffic and
someone cuts us off a normal response.

588
00:33:03,130 --> 00:33:06,200
And certainly one that I often have
is who is that Jerky? You know,

589
00:33:06,201 --> 00:33:09,390
you'd be really pissed off and your
blood pressure would rise and maybe you

590
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,740
would race that guy and uh, you know,
you would, you would think ill of them.

591
00:33:12,741 --> 00:33:15,260
That would be our natural goto thing.
That's a thoughtless,

592
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:18,830
maybe they're idiotic or
they're inattentive or you
would have all these bad

593
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:23,300
thoughts about this person who you know
in a road rage kind of way amongst don't

594
00:33:23,301 --> 00:33:26,600
do that with amongst do is is they
train themselves to re narrate.

595
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:28,610
So when that happens to them,
they say,

596
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:32,840
maybe that's a man who's taking his
wife to the hospital because she's

597
00:33:32,841 --> 00:33:36,830
delivering the baby. The baby's
being born in the car in front of me.

598
00:33:37,010 --> 00:33:41,300
Isn't that amazing? There's a new life.
I should help that man to get to the Ha.

599
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,540
I mean, and they're doing it
not for the sake of that person,

600
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:49,850
but for their own wellbeing. You
see, so, so I think it's possible to,

601
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,730
to, to, to read, even
though it's difficult,

602
00:33:53,210 --> 00:33:58,160
is very difficult to exercise
some internal self control.

603
00:33:58,190 --> 00:34:02,570
I think you're mostly saying that there
are no monks on Twitter. Yes, very few.

604
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,400
The Dalai Lama, my things
on Twitter, I think I follow
on. I think I have to check.

605
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,080
Yeah, he's on Facebook, I'm pretty sure.

606
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:12,890
What else do you think sort of the average
person that's watching this can do to

607
00:34:12,891 --> 00:34:16,210
help order a good society?
Because I think people, you know,

608
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,170
everything's become so political.
Yes.

609
00:34:18,171 --> 00:34:21,920
I think people think that's the only
solution to sort of help make a better,

610
00:34:21,921 --> 00:34:24,710
I think granting charity to your
enemies I think is important.

611
00:34:24,711 --> 00:34:29,270
I think listening to them,
cultivating, listening, you know, um,

612
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:32,020
that's pretty big of you to
say after everything. Well,

613
00:34:32,030 --> 00:34:34,430
I was listening in the clip
you showed I was listening.

614
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:37,070
I thought that was so ridiculous.
Like the young woman who said,

615
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:40,230
I'm not listening to her. I
was really listening. I mean,

616
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:44,090
I was listening then and before and after.
Um,

617
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:47,360
I don't agree with what she was saying,
but I heard what she was saying.

618
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:49,190
I could summarize what she
was saying. Anybody, but,

619
00:34:49,470 --> 00:34:52,040
but what do you do in that case
then? It just sort of, yeah,

620
00:34:52,070 --> 00:34:54,400
we don't have to bring it back to that
specific instance, but in general,

621
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:55,970
because I think a lot of
people are going through this.

622
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:57,290
You're being berated by somebody.

623
00:34:57,291 --> 00:34:59,960
They're saying all the worst
things about you and your motives.

624
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:03,380
They're attacking you as a person.
All of those things now you can listen,

625
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:07,010
you can absorb, you can ignore,
you can ignore, which is also good.

626
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:11,750
Ruth Bader Ginsburg says survival in life
is ignoring a lot of the stupidities,

627
00:35:11,751 --> 00:35:14,870
which I also think is good. I think that's
the answer. And what was it we ignore?

628
00:35:14,871 --> 00:35:19,490
And also who was that famous actress that
found this guy in Texas that had said

629
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:22,420
horrible things to her. And
then, or him I can't remember,

630
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,550
was an actor or an actress and it was
an actress and made it her business to

631
00:35:25,551 --> 00:35:29,600
find out about this guy's life. And he
had lost his health insurance and he,

632
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,860
and then she intervened and raised
money for his healthcare and, and,

633
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:38,920
and he felt seen and heard and don't
know which one. It's an incredible story.

634
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:43,110
And um,
and I think that a lot of times people,

635
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:47,100
and I think anonymity is a real,
it can contributes to bad behavior online.

636
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:49,710
So I think sort of as Jordan
Peterson says, you know,

637
00:35:49,711 --> 00:35:53,460
man up as it were a woman up and have
the strength of your convictions.

638
00:35:53,461 --> 00:35:56,310
This is what I think, this
is what I'm going to say.
But is there a problem there?

639
00:35:56,311 --> 00:35:56,761
I mean Jordan,

640
00:35:56,761 --> 00:36:01,140
I've done this many times where then
depending on how that hierarchal structure

641
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:05,310
is operated, you are saying something
that's an politically correct.

642
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:06,601
Well,

643
00:36:06,601 --> 00:36:10,110
I mean you have to have the strength or
revise your opinions or stick to them or

644
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:13,170
make good arguments. But
listen, let's don't engage.

645
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,220
Let's say you were a Trump supporter.

646
00:36:14,221 --> 00:36:16,470
You just don't want to lose your job
because you think if you say that

647
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:19,500
[inaudible] simple as that I'm against
people losing their jobs for their

648
00:36:19,501 --> 00:36:22,620
opinions. Yeah. So, uh, so
you know, so I think that,

649
00:36:22,621 --> 00:36:25,470
I think there is a thing where
I think a little bit of bravery,

650
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,840
a little bit of civil discourse,

651
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:32,700
a little bit of commitment to
granting charity to our opponents. Um,

652
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:33,900
a little bit of like for example,

653
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,570
when I would have an argument with
people who are opposed to vaccination,

654
00:36:37,230 --> 00:36:41,880
I think there is no merit to their ideas.
I understand their fears.

655
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:45,900
I understand that there have been either
some actual cases of vaccine induced

656
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:49,830
neurological conditions, one in a
hundred thousand one and 500,000 cases,

657
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:51,150
which is awful.

658
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,780
And I understand that there are a lot
of coincidences where people think that

659
00:36:54,781 --> 00:36:57,150
there's a relationship, but no,
it's just that you have, you know,

660
00:36:57,151 --> 00:36:59,250
you have lot of vaccines
are being administered,

661
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:00,390
there are a lot of illnesses occurring.

662
00:37:00,391 --> 00:37:03,120
There's going to be an overlap
in those two sets. But,

663
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,090
and I also know the data
on how that's very been a,

664
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:08,630
how vaccination is like a 20 20th in 2020.

665
00:37:08,631 --> 00:37:11,730
It's actually more than like even a 19th
century triumph. I mean, you know, we've,

666
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:13,680
we've mastered these diseases.
We humans,

667
00:37:13,681 --> 00:37:16,620
it's astonishing what we've done through
our capacity to teach and learn and

668
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:21,010
engage in science and so forth. But I
would engage that person. I would try,

669
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,440
I would talk to them.
I would say, you know,

670
00:37:22,441 --> 00:37:25,410
let me talk to you about your beliefs
and because I think that that's the only

671
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:26,970
way to get them to revise their beliefs.

672
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:31,080
I think telling them they're
fools doesn't, doesn't help. Um,

673
00:37:31,430 --> 00:37:35,530
a true liberal. I am a liberal. Yes
I am. I am. I am a liberal. Yeah.

674
00:37:35,610 --> 00:37:37,560
But do you think one side is a little,

675
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:40,560
it's a little bit easier to do that
right now. And does that flip over time?

676
00:37:40,561 --> 00:37:44,010
So for example, right now I find
it much easier to go to consider.

677
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:47,310
I get invited by conservative glyphs.
Libertarians is no problem,

678
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:51,570
but let's say conservatives that I
disagreements on abortion and gay marriage

679
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:55,020
and legalizing marijuana and the
death penalty. And so wait, hold on.

680
00:37:55,021 --> 00:37:59,070
So I'm for legalization of marijuana. Yes.
What is your position on death penalty?

681
00:37:59,190 --> 00:38:03,370
I'm against the death. Me
Too. What were the other that
gay marriage? Yes. Yeah. Uh,

682
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:07,470
legalizing weed. Yes. Um, so I,
but yes. So I hate to tell you,

683
00:38:07,471 --> 00:38:10,890
I'm guessing that you
only would get invited by
conservative groups to basically

684
00:38:10,891 --> 00:38:15,510
to college as well. I don't know. Um,
I don't know. I don't get that many.

685
00:38:15,511 --> 00:38:18,360
I mean usually my invitations are
scientific. Like I am a scientist.

686
00:38:18,361 --> 00:38:20,010
Like I give talks about my science.

687
00:38:20,250 --> 00:38:24,810
So I have not historically
been very politically right.
So, but what I'm getting,

688
00:38:24,811 --> 00:38:28,140
I really is that at the moment
it seems very obvious to me.

689
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,590
Like I don't know that I could be clear
or anything that's on the center right

690
00:38:31,591 --> 00:38:32,660
there.
There is a,

691
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:38,170
an ability and a d actually a desire to
discuss ideas would agree to disagree

692
00:38:38,171 --> 00:38:41,620
and that just isn't happening right now.

693
00:38:41,621 --> 00:38:44,800
And I would suspect or argue and I'm
sure he can give me examples where that

694
00:38:45,530 --> 00:38:47,620
during McCarthyism for
example, I think, you know,

695
00:38:47,621 --> 00:38:51,050
it was very difficult to be a
communist for sure. And even, you know,

696
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:54,750
left where they were so they weren't
inviting Communist. That's right.

697
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,000
Talk to them. And, uh, so I think, um,

698
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:00,100
I honestly don't know the
answer to that question.

699
00:39:00,101 --> 00:39:04,510
I think there are subgroups on campus
which are still committed to debate the

700
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:08,890
get the political unions. These guys
love to argue these young people. Um,

701
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,700
I think there are other vocal minorities
on campus that don't want to hear

702
00:39:12,701 --> 00:39:15,700
opinions that they don't agree with and
they think that even the hearing of it,

703
00:39:15,701 --> 00:39:19,180
there's this, there's this very sloppy
conflation of speech with violence,

704
00:39:19,181 --> 00:39:23,200
which I think is ridiculous, um, which
seems to really be ramping up. Yes,

705
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:26,830
I would agree with that. And you also see
it, for instance, in Pakistan, they will,

706
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:30,190
they will kill apostates that's
answering speech with violence.

707
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:33,790
If you actually think that
someone believing in a
different God and expressing

708
00:39:33,791 --> 00:39:38,170
that belief is violence, then then the
country justifies killing that person.

709
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:43,180
Or in Brunei. Recently they had the
same kind of situation. I think this,

710
00:39:43,181 --> 00:39:46,540
this is, I, I strongly reject
that belief. There's, there's, uh,

711
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,780
we have different words and there's a
totally different meeting between speech

712
00:39:49,781 --> 00:39:54,490
and violence. So, uh, so I don't
know how we got onto that topic, but,

713
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:56,350
oh, so, so I think that,

714
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,160
I think there are groups
of people on campus who do
conflate speech and violence.

715
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:03,760
I think that's a problem. Um, but there
are also many groups that are very,

716
00:40:03,761 --> 00:40:06,610
very vigorous political debates.
I think one thing that is different,

717
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:11,530
so I'm in my fifties when I was
in college in my, in the eighties,

718
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,950
we would stay up late and argue
about politics with our friends,

719
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,710
with our friend's notice. I said, yeah,

720
00:40:17,170 --> 00:40:21,320
my friends and I would argue with
my friends about politics and uh,

721
00:40:21,370 --> 00:40:24,820
and they were my friends. I don't
think that happens very much anymore.

722
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:27,370
It does in the political unions
and the debates societies.

723
00:40:27,371 --> 00:40:29,110
But in the broader college,

724
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:33,490
I think if you have a different opinion
about abortion, for example, um,

725
00:40:33,610 --> 00:40:35,370
you really can't express that.

726
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:38,380
But the weird thing is that it
is happening with conservatives.

727
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,600
Well pleased because they do believe,

728
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:43,000
I mean I go to these things
and I have these debates with,

729
00:40:43,001 --> 00:40:46,240
he has kids overall and they're better
debaters cause they have more experience.

730
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:49,090
Yes. Arguing with people
they disagree with. Yes.

731
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:53,110
They get a better education in some ways
because they have to constantly defend

732
00:40:53,111 --> 00:40:56,860
their opinions. It's a weird
thing like this will happen
to say that. Yes, yes, yes.

733
00:40:56,861 --> 00:40:59,770
I think, well, it'd be if you, this
is the thing why in the martial arts,

734
00:40:59,771 --> 00:41:01,660
for example,
why do we bow to our opponent?

735
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:06,160
You'll learn more from the people you
disagree with and from the people you

736
00:41:06,161 --> 00:41:09,280
agree with. Right. And Jay is
mill's famous saying, you know,

737
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:13,630
he who knows only his side of the
case knows little of it. Um, so,

738
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,130
you know,
I think,

739
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:20,110
I think that's where your ideas
get better when they are tested.

740
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:25,120
Um, when you argue with
someone you disagree with, um,

741
00:41:25,510 --> 00:41:27,520
and, and, and I think,

742
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,330
and I think cultivating
those kinds of conversations,

743
00:41:31,331 --> 00:41:34,520
disciplining yourself to be able to have
arguments with people you disagree with,

744
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:39,200
uh, improves your ideas and actually
you should be grateful to that person.

745
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:41,540
There's more interesting
person in some ways. Um,

746
00:41:41,670 --> 00:41:43,790
now you don't have to be best
friends with that person necessarily,

747
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,950
although you can be.
Um,

748
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:51,490
but I think it makes you smarter that my
friend is a nice closing statement and

749
00:41:51,591 --> 00:41:52,940
you've lived through it.
I mean,

750
00:41:52,941 --> 00:41:57,770
that's the way you lived through the
forces that so many of us see now as,

751
00:41:57,771 --> 00:42:00,260
as such dangerous forces in designing.
And now that you live through it,

752
00:42:00,470 --> 00:42:03,530
you flourish and you've got another
book out and all of those things. Well,

753
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,650
I would say, I mean, yeah, well, I
would close with saying, you know,

754
00:42:06,651 --> 00:42:11,210
I really believe that, um, that
the arc of our evolution as long,

755
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,470
but it bends towards goodness.
Sounds good to me.

756
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:20,540
