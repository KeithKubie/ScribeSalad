mathematics were popularized more the

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:13.930
mathematics were popularized more the
 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:15.900

but you also get some some idea of what

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750
but you also get some some idea of what
 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.530
but you also get some some idea of what
higher math is like and I feel that that

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540
higher math is like and I feel that that
 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.140
higher math is like and I feel that that
gives a sort of way of thinking and

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150
gives a sort of way of thinking and
 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:04.010
gives a sort of way of thinking and
intuition which which can help you a lot

useful in competitions math later but
 

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:12.710
useful in competitions math later but
also like the way they teach us how to

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720
also like the way they teach us how to
 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.300
also like the way they teach us how to
approach problems and like think about

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310
approach problems and like think about
 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.100
approach problems and like think about
problems it's also really useful in real

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110
problems it's also really useful in real
 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:18.590
problems it's also really useful in real
life so like if you're facing a problem

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600
life so like if you're facing a problem
 

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.000
