00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.240
Franchises are a big part of Hollywood�s
DNA with new sequels coming out every year.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.500
There are so many series that making a list
of the best part twos isn�t that hard.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.880
But things get a little harder when you�re
looking for comedy sequels that were just

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.140
as funny as their predecessor.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:22.660
Looking at you, Hangover II.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.520
Here are Screen Rant�s 5 Hilarious Comedy
Movie Sequels

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.369
22 Jump Street

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.950
Phil Lord and Chris Miller defied expectations
by successfully rebooting the Jump Street

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.800
property as an R-rated comedy, but based on
previews, some thought the sequel would just

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.360
be a retread.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.980
Instead, the film used that to its advantage
and became a skewering satire of Hollywood

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:49.540
franchise building, offering more self-referential
jokes than you could think of.

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.760
Thanks to the skills of the actors and sharp
writing in the script, the gag never got old

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.730
and 22 Jump Street served up as many laughs
as the first one did, if not more.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.520
Plus, the end credits sequence was pretty
sweet as well.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.980
Naked Gun 2 ?: The Smell of Fear

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:07.510
Though this second installment wasn�t as
well received critically as the first Naked

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.770
Gun, it was still a strong box office hit
that made more than its predecessor and was

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.380
a worthy successor.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.060
Leslie Nielsen continued his trademark deadpan
humor by returning to the Frank Deblin role,

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.240
showing why he�s one of comedy�s most
iconic heroes with jokes and hysterically

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.799
inept police work aplenty throughout the run
time.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.770
The funny visual gags are enough to recommend
this film, but Frank�s romance with Priscilla

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.159
Presley�s Jane gave audiences some emotional
stakes to care about and balanced out the

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.979
slapstick in a heartfelt way.

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:35.979
Hot Shots!

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:36.979
Part Deux

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.569
A worldwide box office hit, Hot Shots continued
its memorable brand of action spoof humor

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.170
that also doubled as biting political satire
with a plot revolving around Operation Desert

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.530
Storm and Saddam Hussein.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.829
Primarily poking fun at Rambo III, the film
also expanded to the realm of sci-fi, �recreating�

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.849
legendary bits from Star Wars and Terminator
2 to craft standout action sequences and jokes.

00:01:57.849 --> 00:02:01.579
It also didn�t hurt that talented comedians
like Charlie Sheen and Lloyd Bridges were

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.219
back in the fold, once again delivering hilarious
turns as their fan-favorite characters.

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.539
Never mean spirited, but always on-point,
Hot Shots Deux is a parody done right for

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.810
several reasons.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.210
Harold &amp; Kumar Escape from Guantanamo Bay

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.900
The first film showed what a pair of stoners
would do to get some burgers, and now the

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.700
stakes have been raised considerably.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.250
Arrested on a flight to Amsterdam, our heroes
must find their way out of the titular prison

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.310
before it�s too late.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.260
The premise was ripe for social commentary
on America in the post-9/11 world, using the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.190
franchise�s trademark racial stereotypes
to its full advantage.

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:47.830
Not too mention, misadventures featuring a
KKK rally, Neil Patrick Harris, and even former

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:51.550
US president George W. Bush were all incorporated
to gut-busting results.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:54.760
Who knew that a prison break could be this
wildly entertaining?

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.150
Horrible Bosses 2

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.490
After living out our craziest work-related
fantasies in the first film, this sequel sees

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.580
Nick, Kurt and Dale launch their own business
so they can be their own bosses.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:08.320
Things go wrong after they get screwed on
a deal by Christoph Waltz�s Burt Hanson,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.730
launching another series of unfortunate events
for the gang.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.280
A kidnapping scenario involving Burt�s son
Rex goes awry when Rex turns the tables on

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.810
our heroes, with Chris Pine gleefully chewing
scenery in one of his sleaziest roles to date.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:24.860
Plus, the returning cast � even the old
bosses � are back and firing on all cylinders,

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.920
making Horrible Bosses 2 a fun time that�s
easy to watch.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.020
Those are our picks for some of the funniest
comedy movie sequels.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.550
