00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:03.730
Native Americans, you can mind control really fast. Pull-ups,

2
00:00:03.731 --> 00:00:06.760
just typing out shows that YouTube, all the main stuff's put up on top.

3
00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.370
We're helping the rest fall on gung and sell their Oregon.

4
00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.680
<v 1>I'm kind of retarded. Half of Brazil has the,</v>

5
00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.900
he has the brain worm that makes you basically psychotic.

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.760
Well it doesn't make you psychotic.

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.480
You risk taking crazy and affects your judgment. This is toxic programs.

8
00:00:24.481 --> 00:00:26.730
You'd want to have more cats. Mel. Yes.

9
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.840
She old wives tales where like you get demon possessed by that cat and it

10
00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:32.010
really, it's a damn brain worm.

11
00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.100
Well that's probably also why they told you not to eat and that's a real brain

12
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:37.640
worm programming you like you were saying earlier, it's true. I looked at,

13
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.921
it's true.

14
00:00:37.921 --> 00:00:41.400
I didn't know that that the top soccer's teams have the highest level of brain

15
00:00:41.401 --> 00:00:43.280
worm infestation and I don't necessarily,

16
00:00:43.281 --> 00:00:45.900
I'm not saying I agree with this cause I don't, it's more Apple juice.

17
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.580
Get some Apple juice and your system fella.

18
00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.730
When I started to have people come to the office Shang that I'm a Beau bridges

19
00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.363
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

20
00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.220
<v 1>or that I'm Jeff Bridges</v>

21
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.680
or that I am bill Hicks

22
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.610
and people in restaurant screaming FQ bill, we know it's you. It's,

23
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.900
it's kinda like Dan router the guy threatening me or what's the signal? Dan?

24
00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:11.280
What's the signal? What

25
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.930
when I had the globalist 15 years ago, 20 years ago,

26
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.410
tried to buy me off 10 million a year, you know, whatever. Um, by the way,

27
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:23.550
cheers your chair's brother anyway. True. But this is what they're saying.

28
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.490
What they're about that Joe, let me, let me, okay.

29
00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.370
They have human animal hybrids. 30 years ago.

30
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.150
They've got giant human tissue farms. You know, you hear, Oh your,

31
00:01:33.151 --> 00:01:37.050
your Achilles is torn. We've got a grown in a lab attended.

32
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.880
It's not a fricking 10 and grown in a lab. It's a fricken deal. A humanoid.

33
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.520
These aren't humans. The way they get around it is they made me wait,

34
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.940
wait a minute. We're saying so many things. This is, listen,

35
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:51.450
I love you to death, but you, since the whole million dollars human oyster rail,

36
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.230
I believe they are. But you say so many different things without stopping.

37
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.440
It's hard cause I'm reporting to the government agency so they'll listen to

38
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:01.860
investigate. Um, decompartmentalize. Okay. But it will be studied for years. So,

39
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.830
right. Aliens are real.

40
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.520
They're creating human animal hybrids that are a new creature,

41
00:02:08.521 --> 00:02:13.050
never here on earth. It's alien. So the aliens are already here.

42
00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.060
AI is alien. It kind of mirrors our alien aliens are already here.

43
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.670
Show them. My dad was like the doctor to, you know, these guys.

44
00:02:20.671 --> 00:02:23.190
And I remember sitting around the kitchen table and I'm like Chevy and he's like

45
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.770
Carol, I can't tell you all about it,

46
00:02:25.771 --> 00:02:30.270
but it's a classified program in Maryland and an underground base. And uh,

47
00:02:30.271 --> 00:02:32.670
they won't give me all the details, but it's double the money I'm making now.

48
00:02:32.671 --> 00:02:35.880
This is for national security, but I think, I think it's basically, you know,

49
00:02:35.881 --> 00:02:36.480
we're going to,

50
00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.050
we're building cyborgs and we've got special forces that have volunteered so we

51
00:02:40.051 --> 00:02:43.620
can infiltrate the Russians and get to codes and systems and I believe it's

52
00:02:43.621 --> 00:02:46.210
implanting, but messages in their teeth and I,

53
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.270
and then I also take aside to implants.

54
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.400
I think it's a brain surgery program for microchips.

55
00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.280
And so I'm hearing it and my Carol's like, David,

56
00:02:53.281 --> 00:02:56.220
I'm sick of these people and you've already done so much for the cause.

57
00:02:56.221 --> 00:02:58.890
It's cut government and look what they've already done to you. And Amanda,

58
00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.410
my brother, you're not going to be, you know, I want you out of this.

59
00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.420
So this is like, you know, seven, eight years old.

60
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.610
You're not hearing about the car, you're hearing about the cyborgs.

61
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.150
And so that's the big giant race. When Elon Musk came in and told you,

62
00:03:10.151 --> 00:03:12.220
cause he goes, these billionaire functions and he has a conscience.

63
00:03:12.221 --> 00:03:13.054
So he's freaked out.

64
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.370
We're not gonna have people play video games and party all day.

65
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.750
We're going to set up a world government.

66
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.530
We're going to slowly titrate the dose and poison the public, dumb them down,

67
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.860
put electromagnetic radiation out with five G the scrambles, their DNA,

68
00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.970
lowers their IQ.

69
00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:28.480
We're going to cause massive mental illness and a controlled societal collapse

70
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:33.340
that'll then be organized and controlled in the mop up crew by robots controlled

71
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:38.370
by the globalist programmers who believe with the Offworld entities.

72
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:39.970
They're in communication with that.

73
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.110
They're going to be given the operation to upload and be in that larger kind of

74
00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.320
Borg cube system if they see if they sell the country out.

75
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:50.980
You've got to hit the brakes. Plenty. Did we take this back too? I'm so baffled.

76
00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.160
What's the matter? One of these things, MIT,

77
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:59.190
MIT technology review estimates that about 20 pregnancies of pig human or sheep

78
00:03:59.291 --> 00:04:03.220
human cameras have been established during the last 12 months in the U S total.

79
00:04:03.221 --> 00:04:06.640
I launched in 2016 I hundred percent believe it. Look,

80
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.080
I think that as this was going on in 1985 I'm sure they tried to recruit my dad

81
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.680
to a DARPA program. I believe that in college and then when he was a dentist,

82
00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.930
I believe that Jesus Christ. So Joe,

83
00:04:16.931 --> 00:04:20.260
that's what I'm telling you is where you at the kitchen table when you were

84
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:24.370
eight hearing about cyborgs. So I'm saying no, no, no.

85
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.710
I believe it happened. Stop saying,

86
00:04:26.711 --> 00:04:29.410
I said it didn't happen and stop shaking that.

87
00:04:29.411 --> 00:04:34.000
I'm saying no kids died because I want to talk about human animal hybrids.

88
00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.320
Oh no. I know that the U S air force tried to destroy the atmosphere in 1968.

89
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.330
Yes. Uh, operation starfish prime. They actually did a nuclear bomb.

90
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.750
They adopted a detonate, a nuclear bomb in the upper,

91
00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.120
I'm trying to blow up the Randall and radiation, but yes, they've,

92
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:51.520
they've done a lot of goofy shit. See that's the thing.

93
00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.020
That's why I got mad at you and I love you.

94
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.170
You're a smart guy and everything is, I knew, listen, you got mad at me.

95
00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:58.031
All this stuff.

96
00:04:58.031 --> 00:05:01.420
I know you're even better at saying it and then you sit there cause you can't

97
00:05:01.421 --> 00:05:03.730
handle it and you shit. It's not going to go now.

98
00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.280
It's not that I can't handle it. It's, there's two factors. One,

99
00:05:06.281 --> 00:05:09.850
I don't have any time. I don't have enough time to go into it as much as you do.

100
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.000
You asked why I flipped out and got mad at you. That's it right there. You,

101
00:05:13.001 --> 00:05:16.120
every time I bring up a fucking subject, you know all about it.

102
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.270
I dunno all about fucking know all about the shit.

103
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:21.340
Don't know all about little shit. You're a smart guy.

104
00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.840
[inaudible] Joe. Joe just is a PO bull shit. You know exactly what you're,

105
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.890
I don't think you're a bad guy.

106
00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:32.560
You're trying to survive you and your family and do good, okay,

107
00:05:32.561 --> 00:05:35.740
but [inaudible] your family. None of us are going to make it.

108
00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.520
There's a post human error coming. The breakaway civilization,

109
00:05:39.521 --> 00:05:42.820
the deal has been made. It's not, it's not the third dimension.

110
00:05:42.821 --> 00:05:47.650
They've made fricking deals with interdimensional aliens and noticed the media

111
00:05:47.651 --> 00:05:49.540
never attached it for that cause. That's the truth.

112
00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:53.980
So that's what I'm telling you is it's been in the newspaper that the cell

113
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:57.340
towers are being used for mind control. That sounds like a schizophrenia.

114
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.630
So see, here's the, here's what schizophrenia want to see that.

115
00:05:59.631 --> 00:06:03.200
How do they use the cell type? Pull up probably. Look, here's the thing. Listen,

116
00:06:03.201 --> 00:06:04.310
here's the deal right here.

117
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.790
You've got a total schizophrenia that thinks the son is following him around

118
00:06:07.791 --> 00:06:11.030
town and thinks their dog is watching them and works for the aliens.

119
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.390
That's not happening. You've got someone over here,

120
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.160
someone over here that believes everything they see on Fox news. Yes. Okay. Yes.

121
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:21.260
Now questioning is good. Science is good.

122
00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:23.960
Trying to figure out what's real and all of us get freaked out.

123
00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.030
The nature of the world. No one knows what the universe is.

124
00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.020
We don't have all the answers. So it kind of, people can't handle that bigness.

125
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:33.140
They can't handle that question, especially low IQ.

126
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.750
So they have to differentiate and create a model that allows them to put it in

127
00:06:38.751 --> 00:06:41.720
boxes so they can make it make sense cause they can't handle it.

128
00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:43.350
<v 0>The media is not [inaudible]</v>

129
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.210
<v 1>well, they'll cover that was on the show. They're not going to cover this,</v>

130
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.370
the meat. Okay. Because this is not my opinion.

131
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:52.450
This is the real research that I have heard that,

132
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.310
that I have talked to army generals, commanding generals, major generals,

133
00:06:57.311 --> 00:07:01.690
general generals, CIA, everybody. And they're all 100%.

134
00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:05.080
Uh, and I thought it was a sigh out before. And then I've researched it.

135
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:07.900
I've talked to hundreds of people now, not on air,

136
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.770
but I'm gonna make a film on this who take taken Iowasca in DMT.

137
00:07:11.771 --> 00:07:16.570
I have not taken it. And B for obvious reasons. And,

138
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:19.510
<v 0>uh, [inaudible]</v>

139
00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:23.740
<v 1>and it's unbelievable because I mean they a hundred percent in San Francisco is</v>

140
00:07:23.741 --> 00:07:28.741
the main project site literally have an alien base and they are literally

141
00:07:29.441 --> 00:07:33.940
communicating and they've got like astronaut level people taking super hardcore

142
00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:37.270
levels of drugs and going into meetings with these things and making

143
00:07:37.271 --> 00:07:39.970
intergalactic deals and that, and again,

144
00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.980
that's what the government believes and says they're doing.

145
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.760
<v 0>Me getting into this show is just because people need to understand that I've</v>

146
00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.240
known about this for a long time and I just don't think people are ready for it.

147
00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:55.350
But a lot of folks who, uh,

148
00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:01.140
have low oxygen and, and how, who, and I hope brains well,

149
00:08:01.141 --> 00:08:04.740
well who have, um, you know, sleep apnea, big Macs,

150
00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:06.510
big hedge tongues go back like you and me,

151
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:11.510
<v 1>you go down to 62% oxygen. That's another time that the brain releases DMT.</v>

152
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.120
So my whole life since I was about my first memories were every night

153
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:21.880
<v 0>was a DMT trip show. I basically,</v>

154
00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:24.050
I don't know, I don't want

155
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:26.750
<v 1>this to sound arrogant. It's not, I've seen everything.</v>

156
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:32.030
Or will you do research programs on babies where we tell poor women, uh,

157
00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:35.560
that, Oh, your baby died right when they were born. Romeo,

158
00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:38.090
keep the baby alive and sometimes kill them. Sometimes harvest them,

159
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.730
sometimes do experiments on them. So that's why they've not,

160
00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.170
a lot of nurses have noticed now that baby's disappeared at birth and I tell

161
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:44.871
him, Oh, your baby died.

162
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:48.320
That's why the governor said he was actually an orphan harvesting doctor.

163
00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:52.760
He goes, we keep the babies in love. I've blue bloom, have a discussion.

164
00:08:52.970 --> 00:08:56.490
They are getting caught now cause we've be compartmentalized. Wait a minute,

165
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.730
I'm confused what you're saying. See how it just never ends you.

166
00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:01.890
You saw the governor of Virginia Shay,

167
00:09:01.891 --> 00:09:03.900
we keep babies alive after they're born and kill them. Right?

168
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.560
Well I didn't sleep to keep him comfortable. I am very,

169
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.480
very concerned with late term abortions. I bet you 10 millions.

170
00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.920
Pull that up Jamie. We've got to figure it out.

171
00:09:13.921 --> 00:09:15.600
I know the listeners won't believe me. I'm telling you didn't.

172
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.870
What'd you go crazy posts about this? But it says that he did.

173
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:24.150
It's been taken out of context. What does that media matters? Nos,

174
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:26.730
Huffington post, is that Snopes? It's mostly false.

175
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:30.900
Huffington Snopes said this is above 1 million. I don't have 10 million.

176
00:09:31.890 --> 00:09:35.310
I will give before I got in country to Jamie's.

177
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:41.160
Uh, I'm not kidding. I will give $1 million to your charity of choice.

178
00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:46.320
Wow. No, listen to me. This is serious. Jamie [inaudible] children.

179
00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:52.670
I'll give you $1 million if you can prove that I'm making up that the governor

180
00:09:53.371 --> 00:09:55.560
said we keep babies alive after they're born.

181
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.070
We keep them comfortable and then it turns out he's an organ harvesting thing

182
00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:01.200
and that's what they're doing. You don't want none of that? No.

183
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.780
I already figured out what George Soros is putting in it. Right.

184
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:09.570
<v 3>Um, the infant would be delivered. Uh, the infant would be kept comfortable.</v>

185
00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:12.190
The infant would be resuscitated if,

186
00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:15.180
if that's what the mother and the family desired.

187
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:19.560
And then a discussion would ensue between the physicians and the mother. So,

188
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:23.390
<v 1>so this is saying, Oh the government not involved. This is the medical system.</v>

189
00:10:23.510 --> 00:10:25.880
You sharping if they can kill a baby after it's born.

190
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:29.540
Cause sometimes they deformed, you know she has sometimes they the phone,

191
00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.500
cause the nurses are freaking out and they're saying we're keeping babies alive

192
00:10:33.501 --> 00:10:35.510
and they get put in a van and drive away what's going on. They're like,

193
00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.000
well kids are comfortable.

194
00:10:38.270 --> 00:10:41.750
Show the baby's worth $500,000 but,

195
00:10:41.751 --> 00:10:44.180
but if you kill him right on the spot, they're like,

196
00:10:44.181 --> 00:10:46.880
why are we wasting this seven pounds of meat?

197
00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:51.620
They have wings where they go, Oh we consider the baby dead.

198
00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:53.930
The mother decided it didn't live.

199
00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.710
If she decides we resuscitate and it lives,

200
00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:02.210
but it didn't resuscitate, it's flesh. It's illegal EAs.

201
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:07.390
It's passed into a special ward with doctors that make a few million a year and

202
00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:13.030
the little foolish bowl is kept alive and comfortable until all the orders come

203
00:11:15.111 --> 00:11:18.410
in, the planes land and they take the organs,

204
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:23.330
then they take the blood and they take the skin. Joe,

205
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.370
you see now you know his voice. No, no,

206
00:11:28.371 --> 00:11:31.100
but see, it's a Southern loving voice. I mean,

207
00:11:31.101 --> 00:11:33.820
I remember when I was growing up in Rockwall, Texas, I ran into like a say call.

208
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.770
I was like, God, this girl is a senior in high school. She's super hot. I'm in,

209
00:11:36.771 --> 00:11:39.830
I'm in, I'm in a, I'm in ninth grade.

210
00:11:39.831 --> 00:11:43.940
And like she's picking me up in her Mercedes and I'm taking me some mansion and

211
00:11:43.941 --> 00:11:45.080
the sex with her is incredible.

212
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:48.560
And I'm walking out of the house cause I looked like I was about 16 when I was

213
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.380
13 and the dad goes, you like screwing my daughter? Yeah, I screw her too. Whoa.

214
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.750
I just, as soon as you join us, you love Lucifer.

215
00:11:55.751 --> 00:11:59.260
You get all the what we'll tell you want boy. Cause we want you. But,

216
00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:03.760
but Oh yeah, but that's, yeah man. I have an incredible life look also to now.

217
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.880
But the point is, is that, Oh, you're in LA, you know about all this.

218
00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:10.090
George Soros is the, is the art type of James Bond villains.

219
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:14.880
And the fact that his money show, I remember being a kid when I was like, uh,

220
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.820
eight years old. My mom always had a color TV in the kitchen,

221
00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.540
but she cooked three meals a day. Can I stop you? What are you,

222
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:26.870
what are you saying that he's like crashing economies and when I was a kid

223
00:12:27.191 --> 00:12:29.560
watching PBS, maybe they were lying. Maybe he's great.

224
00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:32.890
George Soros was the international currency speculator.

225
00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:36.280
Who overthrew governments. The reason, the reason, the globalists. Well,

226
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:38.950
if you want the, you want to get the shaker to hit, but I'm saying boy,

227
00:12:39.210 --> 00:12:41.440
Hitler's sacred. Hold on a second. Oh my God. Eddie Bravo's here.

228
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:48.683
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

229
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:56.480
<v 1>we're having a great time talking about a two dimensional beans. What's up bro?</v>

230
00:12:56.660 --> 00:12:58.040
Fuck. I'll choke you out with the shirt.

231
00:12:58.760 --> 00:13:01.400
NASSA I'm going to make you regret wearing this fucking shirt.

232
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.820
Listen to high school. We used to choke each other out. That's like a DMD.

233
00:13:04.821 --> 00:13:07.520
Peter, go ahead and hook me up on it. No, no, no, no, no. Please don't.

234
00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.330
Please don't. I'm not scared. Let's do it. No, no, no. Eddie, don't do it.

235
00:13:11.331 --> 00:13:14.060
Please don't choke them unconscious. No, no. Please try. Let's go.

236
00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.480
He can't do it. You know, you think I'm afraid of this. Let's know.

237
00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:19.520
I definitely don't think you're afraid of this,

238
00:13:19.521 --> 00:13:23.810
which is why I don't want them to do it. Not be pussy. Choke me out.

239
00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:29.960
Have a setter. Choke me out. Alex, please. [inaudible] high school.

240
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:32.990
I know you did. You told me grab each other and you fall down.

241
00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.090
Hit your heads and I, I respect you.

242
00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.550
I want you guys to yell at each other for three minutes while I go pee.

243
00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.330
I gotta pee too. Okay. As you don't talk to yourself, just hold.

244
00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.250
We'll do it and shit. We'll do it. Shit. I'll go first.

245
00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:47.780
You know my was a joke for y'all. Of course. Of course. Of course. I know.

246
00:13:47.781 --> 00:13:52.160
I understand. What I'm telling you is what if I finance a research ship,

247
00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:56.360
large ship and make a documentary. I can't go away for three months. I will pay.

248
00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:01.040
Okay. You raise the money for a trip to the South. Raise the money. Okay.

249
00:14:01.041 --> 00:14:01.874
You got them on

250
00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:09.260
the ice wall. He's the ambassador.

251
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.790
He's the ambassador. [inaudible] astronauts.

252
00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:18.710
The guy that just got P man, big ice field. That guy's going to be in this one.

253
00:14:18.711 --> 00:14:23.450
We're going to do Alex [inaudible]. Give me 27 entire crew.

254
00:14:24.890 --> 00:14:27.560
No, no. You are going to the edge of the flatter arm. Go pee, man.

255
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:30.860
COPI don't you have to go? We're going to send someone else. Alex

256
00:14:35.650 --> 00:14:37.370
[inaudible] to be the one that goes here in a minute.

257
00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:40.400
I came here and I pleased they're keeping babies alive and taking their organs.

258
00:14:40.430 --> 00:14:41.360
How did you prove that?

259
00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.880
Jamie pulled some shit up on Google and they admitted them. Normalizing it. No,

260
00:14:46.881 --> 00:14:51.200
the fucking the governor. You really think,

261
00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:56.210
do you really think there's people out there campaigning for late term

262
00:14:56.211 --> 00:14:58.220
abortions? You think that shit's real.

263
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.030
You don't think that it's routed Monday to kick my leg?

264
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:06.080
Who would campaign for that ain't

265
00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:11.990
[inaudible], man. They're fucking killing RD. More cats.

266
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:14.120
So you're telling me it isn't real. What?

267
00:15:14.121 --> 00:15:17.480
I had a fucking folk in the goddamn fucking Senate.

268
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.460
That's a conspiracy theory. [inaudible] you're fucking top.

269
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:27.020
You're about to get it already born babies. Stop fucking lying.

270
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:30.830
God fucking dad. I'm going to pass now. Come on at you in my psychosis.

271
00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.020
He is so crazy that I always thought I was so tough. Get up to pee anymore.

272
00:15:36.980 --> 00:15:39.130
Piss a little bit out point. The point is,

273
00:15:39.131 --> 00:15:44.131
is that you heard that piece of shit fucking KKK guy fucking governor say we're

274
00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.110
going to keep alive after they're fucking born. He's like,

275
00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:52.580
cause they want to fucking take their organs. It's incredible. He's a KKK guy.

276
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:55.430
It's incredible. I've called fuck. It's so incredible.

277
00:15:55.431 --> 00:15:59.030
Then I did a picture with a guy, a KKK outfit in blackface.

278
00:15:59.090 --> 00:16:01.760
They elected him cause he's black males. They had that shit

279
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:04.980
<v 0>and when he messed up and said we keep them alive to get their fucking organs,</v>

280
00:16:05.130 --> 00:16:08.070
they used that to deactivate him. Jeez.

281
00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:10.950
Why do you think fraternities have you screw sheep and all this and you know,

282
00:16:10.951 --> 00:16:14.460
give guys blowjobs that's why I never joined them because they want to go back,

283
00:16:14.461 --> 00:16:16.500
go back. Say that again.

284
00:16:16.530 --> 00:16:21.510
The first time I got chucked out was like this 17 year old super hot chick and I

285
00:16:21.511 --> 00:16:25.470
was like 13 tied up and she lived down the street. No, no. And she goes,

286
00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:29.310
I already, I got permission. So I was pretty young like 12 and she goes,

287
00:16:29.311 --> 00:16:31.530
I'll have sex with you. There's a true story.

288
00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:35.400
I'll have sex with you if you let me put makeup on. So I'm not in the case.

289
00:16:35.401 --> 00:16:38.280
Everything show the girl puts the makeup on it.

290
00:16:38.281 --> 00:16:42.300
I have sex with her and she's super hot and then she goes,

291
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.860
now I'm going to chose you out.

292
00:16:45.930 --> 00:16:49.260
And that relationship went really well until I'm like 30 year old boyfriend

293
00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:53.130
caught me at her place once cause her mom was always working and trying to kill

294
00:16:53.131 --> 00:16:57.630
me in the parking lot. Oh my God. No, no, no.

295
00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:02.710
You have to do it. We're talking fricking AutoZone abuse number one. No, no, no,

296
00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:07.500
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. There's no need to try to Sue me and shit.

297
00:17:07.501 --> 00:17:10.650
This is one of the first things that I swept it up and jumped up once we,

298
00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:12.510
once we made up on the phone,

299
00:17:12.540 --> 00:17:15.960
one of the first things you wanted me to do is choke him out in the air. No,

300
00:17:15.961 --> 00:17:18.210
you might need to go to them. SMN those, uh,

301
00:17:18.220 --> 00:17:21.870
those SNM the pain dungeon choked out.

302
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.690
You'd like go somewhere and I've got a little dream and then you come right

303
00:17:24.691 --> 00:17:28.350
back. DMT. You hate that shit, James on point as all right.

304
00:17:28.351 --> 00:17:33.210
Well let's get serious. The CIA's OSS, that's all on record. Okay.

305
00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:35.730
I'm glad you questioned me now, but I don't know what that meant.

306
00:17:36.150 --> 00:17:40.630
What is OSS again? Uh, office of special plans or office.

307
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.850
That was before the CIA.

308
00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:47.730
The office of strategic services you've got, you've got,

309
00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.690
but German intelligence came to Eisenhower and say, listen,

310
00:17:52.650 --> 00:17:55.830
you don't need to do all this. We haven't given them the real technology.

311
00:17:56.760 --> 00:18:00.600
We're in contact with aliens and they've dealt with the whole plan.

312
00:18:00.601 --> 00:18:02.940
Where do you getting this from? The stadiums so confidently.

313
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:06.720
It's in the literature, man. Hitler like would go literature,

314
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:12.240
mainline historical books about [inaudible] castles where they go,

315
00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:15.540
the aliens want blood so they'd kill like 20 kids and everything today he leaves

316
00:18:15.630 --> 00:18:17.730
with like, she'll come in and he'll kill, they take the blood,

317
00:18:17.790 --> 00:18:21.120
brings him in like sharks and then they give them technology. They go,

318
00:18:21.121 --> 00:18:21.901
this is how it works.

319
00:18:21.901 --> 00:18:24.480
You build the atomic weapons this way you build it and they would like show him

320
00:18:24.481 --> 00:18:27.510
bombers and like the aliens are like telepathic. I don't even believe this.

321
00:18:27.511 --> 00:18:28.700
This is what the Nazis believe and the,

322
00:18:28.701 --> 00:18:31.650
and the aliens with mind-meld and give them the technology. They're bad aliens.

323
00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.980
So are you surprised the Nazis were influenced by demons?

324
00:18:36.030 --> 00:18:37.590
They get even deeper.

325
00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:41.820
They turn your heart off for five minutes and they pump oxygen into your blog

326
00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:45.690
and you're in the meetings. I've talked to people that involve me,

327
00:18:45.700 --> 00:18:50.010
top scientists, and you're in the meetings with frickin aliens.

328
00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:54.480
Elves is the main group. The heart goes out, the body thinks it's dead, right?

329
00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:58.230
So you can stay in longer. I don't know all the science behind it. I understand,

330
00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:03.780
but let's explain this. Lucky DMT or Iowasca 200 times.

331
00:19:04.110 --> 00:19:06.180
Like most of our astronauts test pilots are flying planes.

332
00:19:06.300 --> 00:19:09.870
Those are robots count. It's all mind war. So these dudes are like,

333
00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:12.600
it stops working once you've taken it hundreds of times.

334
00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:17.340
So then they start taking their most psychic people who are able to do this and

335
00:19:17.341 --> 00:19:20.400
they turn their heart off and then they put them into these,

336
00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:23.700
these events and it's like the things the aliens tell them,

337
00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:25.740
they come out and they tell scientists. And it works.

338
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:30.300
Show like what kind of shit? They didn't tell. Let me tell you,

339
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:31.260
get killed for this stuff, Joe.

340
00:19:31.261 --> 00:19:34.200
This is not the only thing they want me off the air because when I finally

341
00:19:34.201 --> 00:19:36.000
figured this out, cause I never touch aliens,

342
00:19:36.001 --> 00:19:38.550
I kind of knew the whole thing already. So you go back thousands of years,

343
00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:43.380
Merlin, you know the archetypal or or, or, or these magicians or these,

344
00:19:43.560 --> 00:19:48.560
these wizards are taking drugs in these temples and interfacing with these

345
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.450
pallet tears, these crystal balls, which aren't really crystal balls.

346
00:19:51.451 --> 00:19:54.660
It's their psychic focus of an interdimensional connection while they're on

347
00:19:54.661 --> 00:19:54.931
drugs,

348
00:19:54.931 --> 00:19:59.580
looking into glass to then be able to see the future and understand what's

349
00:19:59.581 --> 00:20:03.570
happening to give them temporal power over this planet. Let's just say this.

350
00:20:03.571 --> 00:20:07.770
I'm not in the CIA. Me neither. I'm not in the NSA meeting either,

351
00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.250
but they've been tracking me my whole life. I need to hear about aliens.

352
00:20:13.170 --> 00:20:15.990
Marijuana. Yeah. Marijuana and

353
00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:20.400
some of your body. A little tip watching, attack me,

354
00:20:20.401 --> 00:20:23.520
lie about me and go to the top. But you lose your soul and any I,

355
00:20:24.330 --> 00:20:26.880
I love you to death. And you're awesome. That's why I asked for you to be here.

356
00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.610
If you want to believe in aliens, I'm cool with that. I still love you.

357
00:20:29.611 --> 00:20:33.870
I don't care. I don't care about that. I said I'm, this is not what I believe.

358
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:38.220
Okay? I love you for who you are. I'm trying to tell you something.

359
00:20:38.490 --> 00:20:41.850
Listen man, let me tell you something. Let me tell you something. Okay?

360
00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:46.680
I want to get all your points cause here's the deal. What points?

361
00:20:46.890 --> 00:20:51.400
That's all I got back. 100% yeah, 100%. I ain't got no points. Okay?

362
00:20:52.090 --> 00:20:53.740
It'd be the biggest documentary in history.

363
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:56.110
It only costs like a million dollars. Okay?

364
00:20:56.111 --> 00:21:01.060
Let's take it a 50,000 ton big ship and to have it circumnavigate the planet,

365
00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.510
okay? You will be there with GP and I'm not going to be there.

366
00:21:06.370 --> 00:21:09.490
No one's going to make, get someone to no, don't end the podcast.

367
00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:10.870
And I'll keep going. I gotta pee. I gotta be,

368
00:21:10.871 --> 00:21:15.670
I'm not gonna work you gotta pee again. [inaudible] go first.

369
00:21:15.671 --> 00:21:18.450
Let me go first and I know what your question is. You're not a psychotic demon.

370
00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:22.450
Daymond person. Thanks you. You told me this morning,

371
00:21:23.770 --> 00:21:26.320
not this morning, yesterday. Nobody this morning. Oh,

372
00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:33.090
you said you shed basically that there was no way to prove any of this.

373
00:21:35.410 --> 00:21:39.950
Approve any of what? What are you talking about? This? What's this

374
00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:45.590
space? You're, you're saying trees, you're generalizing. No,

375
00:21:45.591 --> 00:21:47.420
I'm not mad at you questioning. I think it's great

376
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:54.270
to talk about 12 dimensions. 11 known, 12 being omnipresent.

377
00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.560
So we don't say it actually exists

378
00:21:58.130 --> 00:22:00.350
to say that is arrogant. So I won't say that,

379
00:22:01.070 --> 00:22:05.630
but I have had dreams my whole life that come true.

380
00:22:06.170 --> 00:22:07.220
And the weirdest thing,

381
00:22:07.221 --> 00:22:11.990
like a lady drops a thing of pickles at the store for five years I had the dream

382
00:22:11.991 --> 00:22:15.350
and then one day I'm there and it's the woman in the pickles break or,

383
00:22:15.351 --> 00:22:19.600
or when was this chicken? When I was a kid.

384
00:22:19.601 --> 00:22:23.830
It was more intense. Is fucking crazy. If this is your real life experience,

385
00:22:23.831 --> 00:22:28.600
I want to know what the fuck that is. You are you, are you on the periphery?

386
00:22:28.990 --> 00:22:33.400
Do you have your finger on a membrane that maybe other people can't totally

387
00:22:33.401 --> 00:22:35.130
touch and they'll use it against me.

388
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:37.270
But notice they don't touch it because it's their whole religion and they can't

389
00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:41.050
stand up talking about it. By the time I was like three years old,

390
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:46.510
I would have this dream that God has because God knows everything is this super

391
00:22:46.511 --> 00:22:49.120
intelligent, omnipresent, unlimited dimensions,

392
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:50.680
but God doesn't know where God came from.

393
00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.770
So just like we're trying to find out where we came from,

394
00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:56.950
God is like a virtual reality simulation as well,

395
00:22:57.310 --> 00:23:01.870
and God is constantly running every program, every operation, turning evil,

396
00:23:01.871 --> 00:23:05.650
loose, good, loose, everything show. I would have these dreams,

397
00:23:07.210 --> 00:23:08.920
but the earliest memories like two,

398
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:13.510
three years old where I would fly out to the edge of infinity and

399
00:23:16.590 --> 00:23:19.470
it was a, it was a continual message. Find out where we came from,

400
00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:23.310
find out what it is, and it would just be this big giant spinning black vortex,

401
00:23:23.311 --> 00:23:25.710
like a black hole. Okay, 30 more minutes. I want to give up.

402
00:23:25.711 --> 00:23:29.580
You're going to be fucked up, dude. I'm fine, man. Hours. Look,

403
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:32.160
here's the thing. Listen, I'll be honest with you.

404
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:37.620
I'm kind of retarded in that.

405
00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.490
No, no, no, no. That's going to be a soundbite.

406
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:45.620
They're going to put that to mariachi music. True. False.

407
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:50.090
The Mayans smoked penis blood. They did. They did.

408
00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:53.960
What they did was I made that shit up. I appreciate it.

409
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:57.560
I thought you were just being silly. That's they took,

410
00:23:57.590 --> 00:23:59.150
they took long lines of leather,

411
00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:04.330
Jaguar leather and it had it had it had nails on it and it,

412
00:24:04.850 --> 00:24:09.320
or had like spiky things, a glass and they would put it in their genitals.

413
00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:14.000
Oh, the most skilled Jesus, the high priest, whatever.

414
00:24:14.001 --> 00:24:18.110
Sacrificing people for hours thinking hallucinogen JSON would,

415
00:24:18.111 --> 00:24:22.220
would like not try to cut his testicles off, but only the most skilled,

416
00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:24.260
which sit there and draw them through their [inaudible] smoke.

417
00:24:24.261 --> 00:24:28.880
The blood consciousness and the universe is an interdimensional spacecraft.

418
00:24:29.150 --> 00:24:29.990
Beyond that,

419
00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:35.390
it looks like a comment from my research and it has,

420
00:24:35.420 --> 00:24:39.560
it has its head, it has its Corona. That's consciousness consciousness.

421
00:24:39.650 --> 00:24:44.090
It carries evil in the tail end. So consciousness has a location. No,

422
00:24:44.091 --> 00:24:46.640
there is this giant consciousness. This God. Okay.

423
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:51.320
Swimming in a giant system of survival.

424
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:54.600
The fitness that God has created a test God shelf. Okay.

425
00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.940
And it looks like a comment.

426
00:24:56.270 --> 00:24:58.220
So you've got God's conscious and all the good things,

427
00:24:58.221 --> 00:25:01.130
the knowledge going forward, but God knows that everybody has to be tested.

428
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:05.210
So the tail goes out and at the end of the tail is basically evil.

429
00:25:05.300 --> 00:25:09.920
That's why Christ says get behind me and it's always trying to test God and

430
00:25:09.921 --> 00:25:12.950
infiltrate up into it to sabotage you.

431
00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:16.940
You were telling me that it fucks with your head the certain amount of it after

432
00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:20.870
awhile it just fucks with your head. Yeah, the negativity. Yeah.

433
00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.580
And I like to have dreams. I like dreams are like 20 years long. Like you said.

434
00:25:25.581 --> 00:25:29.000
What DMT where I'm a farmer and like it's a,

435
00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.970
it's like 500 years ago and I'm just like planning things,

436
00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:35.510
eating food and like putting my kids to sleep and like, you know,

437
00:25:35.511 --> 00:25:38.330
cutting trees down and like, and there's no, there's,

438
00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:41.390
there's on average 35,000 feet. This is NASA statistics.

439
00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:43.580
Probably not true faith.

440
00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.480
You didn't give into the pressuring of the threat.

441
00:25:47.870 --> 00:25:51.350
It was more than nagging like a siren, like a bitching woman. Not against women.

442
00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:57.020
But I mean I get it. I gotta pee so bad. What, go. Go, go pee, pee.

443
00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.670
Come back and we'll finish five more minutes cause I want to,

444
00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:02.420
I want to get into the tub. Talk to Eddie, talk some sense of know how to pitch.

445
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:08.450
Tell about buzz algae telling me about boy buzz algin you know I'll tell you

446
00:26:08.451 --> 00:26:13.310
about all he told me. I know where you go.

447
00:26:13.790 --> 00:26:17.990
Okay. It's going to be around. So that's where we're all going.

448
00:26:17.991 --> 00:26:21.380
Just what is the system? We'll get rid of free speech, right to self defense,

449
00:26:21.381 --> 00:26:25.640
the family to fend those things and ask yourselves what are we about to discover

450
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:29.570
men I believe in that. You can say that shit again. What was it?

451
00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:34.550
Right to bear arms. Free speech. And what was the third one? Family. Family.

452
00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:39.410
What were the sneeze? Big sneezing. John asks the question,

453
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:40.820
who is the big three? Say that again.

454
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:50.630
Is it possible that it collapsed because of those gigantic diesel fires?

455
00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:54.150
Right. And then that was tower one to two sevens is on building.

456
00:26:54.151 --> 00:26:59.151
Seven seven had a diesel diesel tanks in the basement and they caught fire and

457
00:26:59.521 --> 00:27:02.760
they said it was an Inferno and they said it cooked through these towns.

458
00:27:03.450 --> 00:27:04.530
Hold on a second. It's always been,

459
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:09.150
but I want to ask you this cause I don't know. Oh yeah, right. Bill,

460
00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:14.280
the CIA, the FBI, all of it wasn't an NSA as well. Everything. See,

461
00:27:14.281 --> 00:27:15.990
he always says, Oh, I know. He goes,

462
00:27:17.050 --> 00:27:21.870
I'm not just kissing his ass like he's beyond what's up. He's no, it's bullshit,

463
00:27:21.871 --> 00:27:26.610
man. No, you know every fucking thing. Just fucking say yourself.

464
00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.570
Know what GS played it to everybody when I was a little kid and I was having all

465
00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:35.100
of these visions when I was asleep, I hadn't seen Conan the destroyer yet.

466
00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.850
Or Conan the barbarian was the first one. I was ready. I remember.

467
00:27:38.851 --> 00:27:41.460
I like the demons, like laying on the sides, which is good looking guy.

468
00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:44.160
It turns to this big fucking goblin tax her buddy.

469
00:27:44.580 --> 00:27:47.220
And when I was a kid that was like a thing. Like I would like try to,

470
00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.720
in these dreams, these I go way back to as universe. You'd be like, I was like,

471
00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:52.740
it's a gay dude.

472
00:27:52.741 --> 00:27:56.580
Like sitting there on his side like this and then a few years later I saw Conan.

473
00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:57.840
So the shorter, I'm like,

474
00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:01.410
that's the thing from the drain did show what I'm saying is they know shortens.

475
00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:04.420
Okay. You seen like the Hobbit remake? Yeah.

476
00:28:04.650 --> 00:28:09.540
Where Gandalf goes to the castle and shore. Ron's not made his body yet. Right.

477
00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:14.160
And he, he looked, looks like that. He liked that fire. I've seen exactly that.

478
00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:19.200
So you want to talk about what that real controllers of the grays are?

479
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:22.560
It looks like sorrow. Have you ever had a significant head injury?

480
00:28:24.450 --> 00:28:26.190
You have? What happened to you?

481
00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.840
How old were you? It was about 13 1314 somebody pile drives you in your head.

482
00:28:33.841 --> 00:28:34.920
Did it change your personality?

483
00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:37.650
I got up and punched him in the throat and they had drank anatomy almost dad.

484
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:40.890
Wow. So was it,

485
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:45.630
it was like the state wrestling champion mental light and he his cousin or

486
00:28:45.631 --> 00:28:49.380
something and the Dallas was like, this is like, you know, got me down.

487
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.660
I was never starting fires, man. These people. Here's the thing,

488
00:28:51.661 --> 00:28:53.670
I'm out a victim of racial attacks.

489
00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.060
I'm not like Jeffrey or Jesse Smollett is,

490
00:28:57.061 --> 00:29:00.060
I fought rednecks and I got my leg broken, you know by,

491
00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.530
so this guy pile drives you on your head. You knew you're 13. Yeah.

492
00:29:04.531 --> 00:29:06.660
And then what did it do to your personality then?

493
00:29:06.661 --> 00:29:10.380
I had to fight his whole family fight most his family. It was a janky danger.

494
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:14.220
Did it change, but did you have any significant change from that head injury?

495
00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:18.450
Sometimes when people have entered juries especially it seems like young new

496
00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.910
stuff just got better after the real, Oh

497
00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:27.000
go ahead Joseph. Man, what you think that he's a conspiracy theorist?

498
00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:29.610
Cause he got dropped on his head. Uh, I think,

499
00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:33.330
I think there's something like the average 150 pound guy,

500
00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:34.253
you're probably kicking my ass.

501
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:37.080
But when like a bunch of people are coming after me,

502
00:29:37.290 --> 00:29:42.290
it's like Darth Vader and sometimes it's cracked out.

503
00:29:43.450 --> 00:29:46.480
I would see like numbers. Like I was a robot, like red,

504
00:29:46.481 --> 00:29:50.370
I would see like members, he sees red. It was like, he was like,

505
00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.740
no, I'm not kidding. I remember like somebody choking me and like,

506
00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:59.410
guys are like somebody who's like pulling a knife out and you see that knife

507
00:29:59.411 --> 00:30:01.600
pulling out. You're like [inaudible].

508
00:30:01.780 --> 00:30:06.780
And like at that point you are see everything from only those minutes when

509
00:30:07.931 --> 00:30:11.290
everything's clear, it's like show survival emotions.

510
00:30:12.010 --> 00:30:16.390
But then you see like, like the Wars and the attacks,

511
00:30:16.930 --> 00:30:21.190
the submarines of the spacecraft. And like, it's like when you dial into that,

512
00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:23.050
it's like total war. It's like,

513
00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:25.480
didn't you say that when your friends would choke you out,

514
00:30:25.481 --> 00:30:30.130
you'd have like these long dreams? Oh yeah, no, no, no. In junior high,

515
00:30:30.131 --> 00:30:31.870
sixth, seventh, eighth grade. Cause we,

516
00:30:31.930 --> 00:30:34.570
when I got choked out a couple of other times, I finally stopped.

517
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:37.630
I remember this one time I, they choked me out.

518
00:30:37.631 --> 00:30:41.680
And also it was like a black Knight with a sore goes and like attacks me on this

519
00:30:41.681 --> 00:30:42.514
horse.

520
00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:47.350
And then like it was and then I was like in England thousands of years ago and I

521
00:30:47.351 --> 00:30:47.970
had this wife,

522
00:30:47.970 --> 00:30:52.240
these kids and it was a whole lifetime like taking care of them and like growing

523
00:30:52.241 --> 00:30:54.910
food and like a kid starved to death and died.

524
00:30:55.810 --> 00:31:00.250
It was like just those moments where like whole lives,

525
00:31:00.730 --> 00:31:02.920
dead kids, everything. That's what I'm saying,

526
00:31:02.921 --> 00:31:07.900
like you dial into all those ancestors and it was like my kids and kids starving

527
00:31:07.901 --> 00:31:10.300
to death and like people attacking us.

528
00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:13.900
And so you think all that information from your ancestors somehow or another

529
00:31:13.901 --> 00:31:18.340
encoded somewhere [inaudible] Joe you've seen like a,

530
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:24.070
was that stupid Tom cruise movie where stupid Tom cruise. How dare you,

531
00:31:24.850 --> 00:31:28.810
how dare you Jack Reacher Jack Ruthie to oblivion.

532
00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:33.490
They've got these giant Landers selling up. Oh yeah, for a second. The ocean of,

533
00:31:33.610 --> 00:31:37.600
I was a dope movie outsiders and he doesn't even know he's working for the

534
00:31:37.601 --> 00:31:40.750
system. Like a women. Like I love black women, I love white women,

535
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:43.930
love Hispanic women. I love mall. Like if a woman's cool,

536
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:46.660
like I know a bunch of black women that are bitches, black women that are cool.

537
00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:49.870
What about Swedish bitches? Oh, I'm off. The point is let's just say I'm,

538
00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.600
I'm super gay, but the point is what I'm getting,

539
00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:55.510
what I'm getting at here though, not unlike sweetest.

540
00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:00.340
I don't know. Let's wrap this up. No, we need to wrap it up,

541
00:32:00.341 --> 00:32:02.350
but I got to make this point. I don't know what it is.

542
00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.890
How is that getting into that? Oh, the racism thing. Oh, when?

543
00:32:05.891 --> 00:32:08.980
What is inside your bag? You're more tobacco. I do have more tobacco,

544
00:32:09.130 --> 00:32:11.980
but I'm just a little bit more tobacco. Yes, for sure.

545
00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:15.370
100% I believe you that the backhoe was amazing by, that's pretty good stuff.

546
00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.090
Here's like a thing at Alun last year where the guy comes in with tattoos,

547
00:32:19.091 --> 00:32:21.400
a big beard and it was in the police report.

548
00:32:21.490 --> 00:32:26.260
The guy had like a foot long cock and he goes, do a cervix jam.

549
00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:30.970
What kind of police report is this? And the nurse said, uh, sir, uh,

550
00:32:31.570 --> 00:32:35.290
I don't see a vagina. And it was in the report.

551
00:32:35.320 --> 00:32:39.200
The man had a foot long Dick. The Japanese said, Hey, uh,

552
00:32:39.230 --> 00:32:42.710
you don't get the trans designation unless you chop the Johnson and the way it

553
00:32:42.711 --> 00:32:46.400
goes off. And it's like, Hey, you get tax payers will pay for it.

554
00:32:46.401 --> 00:32:48.980
You get that vagina bill and then you sit there and do it.

555
00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.700
And so I'm sitting there walking out of this mall right after Trump got elected

556
00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.950
in Houston. I remember, cause I was hearing my wife,

557
00:32:54.951 --> 00:32:57.170
she wanted like a Burberry coat or something.

558
00:32:58.050 --> 00:33:01.850
I was out visiting family and these black guys go, we're going to kill you.

559
00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.450
I didn't hate them because they were black guys. They were literally Nazis.

560
00:33:05.810 --> 00:33:08.960
And I remember sitting there in that parking lot walking across and I said,

561
00:33:08.961 --> 00:33:12.730
well if you such big men kill me now, and it wasn't my,

562
00:33:12.860 --> 00:33:15.440
my wife's eyes slow down,

563
00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.890
I'm going to kill tough. They're saying,

564
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:22.580
you white book a hole. Okay, we going to kill your last,

565
00:33:22.581 --> 00:33:24.080
I want to end this show on a positive note.

566
00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.030
I'm not against black people don't know. You know,

567
00:33:26.031 --> 00:33:27.890
no one wanted the black people are like that.

568
00:33:28.010 --> 00:33:31.850
But I think in the spectrum of like one to a hundred we're in the 95th

569
00:33:31.851 --> 00:33:34.490
percentile of really being woke. Let me ask you this,

570
00:33:34.730 --> 00:33:35.960
cause I've been talking way too much.

571
00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:40.670
Ain't closing here at the end of this transmission. We should talk about

572
00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:42.980
a lot of things.
