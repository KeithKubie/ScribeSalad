00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.229
Just like linear equations, we can also Check a Quadratic Equation. After we

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:08.934
solve for our two answers, negative 2 and negative 3, we can plug them back into

00:00:08.934 --> 00:00:12.683
our original equation to make sure we're correct. I want you to check our two

00:00:12.683 --> 00:00:16.553
solutions by plugging in the appropriate numbers into the parenthesis.
