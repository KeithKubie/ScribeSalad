Hi YouTube. All the friends. I'm Jet Li. I'm
in Davos. This is the first time for me to

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.499
come here and meet a lot of new friends. I
just had the meeting with, I'm very proud

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:19.580
that I met, like brother, Bill Gates. And
why I come here? And I am making a movie for

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:26.539
sure. So I started a foundation called "ONE",
because--. What is "ONE"? People live on the

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:32.460
earth, have different cultures, have different
religion, different languages. But we're human.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.910
That's the first one. Second one; we have
the same value about our family. You know

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.640
everybody work very hard. Why? Take care family,
mother, sister, brother, younger brothers.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.949
So I think that's the value of human being
stand. When we talk about philanthropy everybody

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:55.613
talks about money, money, money. If we have
a lot of money we can solve a lot of problems.

00:00:55.613 --> 00:01:03.230
I think money is a great thing we have but
on the other hand it's mentally, the heart

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:11.580
and the resource. Also very important, my
belief is if you believe we are this global

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.460
family, this earth is our home. Everybody
do a little bit to take care of this home.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.460
Rich people they need to do their job, governments
need to do their jobs. We are just normal

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.860
human being , we can do a little bit like
volunteer one hour per month, donate one yuan,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.220
one dollar per month put it on the pool. Take
care of this home, make sure this home is

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:43.850
fresh, healthy; maybe 50 years later give
this home to the next generation. That's what

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:53.869
I called the 21st century philanthropy culture.
That's my belief. Everybody do together. All

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.710
the family, now we are the one. We change
together. I hope you join me. "ONE Foundation"

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.040
One family. Thank you.
