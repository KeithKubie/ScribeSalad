00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.840
&gt;&gt; I'm Nancy Knowlton, the CEO of Smart Technologies
and I believe role models are incredibly important

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:25.070
for particularly women here in the Middle
East. I think that it's challenging enough

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.140
for people, young people to figure out a career
today, but maybe more so for young women where

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.189
they haven't had such strong participation,
particularly in business or perhaps science.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.560
So seeing successful women and having those
women share what has been their key to success

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:46.280
I think will be very important for young women
as they chart their course. And if you look

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.120
at the number of young people, particularly
in the region, the percentage of those young

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.420
people who are women, it's very important
to engage them, to show them that they've

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.150
got a role to play and exactly what that role
could be. I think back to my own time when

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:08.090
I was graduating from university, there were
very few female role models and I really had

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.480
to chart my own course and so today I'm very
generous with my time and sharing incites

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.480
and whatever I can with young women so they
get the sense of whatever they can dream is

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.483
in fact possible.
