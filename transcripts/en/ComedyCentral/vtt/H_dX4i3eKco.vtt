00:00:01.034 --> 00:00:03.136
- What is something
everyone looks stupid doing?

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:05.638
- Oh, like walking in a pool?
(laughter)

00:00:05.671 --> 00:00:06.672
For sure.

00:00:06.706 --> 00:00:08.274
- Yeah, that's dumb.
Like, who are you, Jesus?

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:09.275
(laughter)

00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:11.978
- Sitting on a high stool or a
low chair.

00:00:12.011 --> 00:00:13.112
- Yeah, that's dumb.

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.714
- I just know all of these
are all fat guy problems.

00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:15.548
(laughter)

00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:17.383
(guitar riff)

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:18.918
- What's up everybody?
I'm Chris Destefano,

00:00:18.951 --> 00:00:20.520
this is called Stupid Questions,

00:00:20.553 --> 00:00:22.622
I got Big Jay Oakerson you know
him

00:00:22.655 --> 00:00:25.425
from Comedy Central Radio's 'The
Bonfire'.

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:28.795
And we're two straight white
males, what is this, 2011?

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.530
(electronic drums)

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.298
(laughter) Alright, what
would you rather have,

00:00:32.331 --> 00:00:34.233
no nipples or no fingernails?

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:36.436
- (inhale) No nipples.
- Yeah.

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:37.737
- I'm a fingernail-biter.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:38.571
- Sames.

00:00:38.604 --> 00:00:40.807
- So, I love that.
- Yeah.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.376
- I know it's destroying my
teeth day by day (laughter)

00:00:43.409 --> 00:00:44.477
I love biting those nails.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.145
Not a big fan of biting my own
nipples.

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:47.280
- I would love to have the
flexibility

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:48.381
to bite my own nipples though.

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:50.116
- You can get the flexibility
or you take my path

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.118
where you can get your tits
big enough to reach your mouth.

00:00:52.151 --> 00:00:53.820
(laughter)

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:55.088
(guitar stab)

00:00:55.121 --> 00:00:56.356
- Alright, another stupid
question.

00:00:56.389 --> 00:01:00.393
Would you rather be the worst
player on a championship team

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:01.928
or the best player in the last
place team?

00:01:01.961 --> 00:01:03.930
- I'd rather be the worst
player on a championship team--

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:05.765
- Really? You wanna win the
championship?

00:01:05.798 --> 00:01:07.733
- Yeah, I mean when you
show the ring at the bar

00:01:07.766 --> 00:01:08.868
you're still gonna get the same
love.

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:09.702
- That's true.

00:01:09.735 --> 00:01:10.903
(laughter)

00:01:10.936 --> 00:01:12.772
- If you always wear your
jersey they'll recognize you.

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:14.774
- I've been on so many last
place teams.

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:16.075
- I've also never been like,

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:17.743
there's two seconds
left, look in the crowd

00:01:17.776 --> 00:01:19.178
and went: give me the ball.

00:01:19.211 --> 00:01:20.313
(laughter)

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:21.347
I got this.
- I got this.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.548
(guitar riff)

00:01:22.581 --> 00:01:24.117
What set of items would you buy

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.985
that would make the
cashier most uncomfortable?

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:27.553
- I know what makes me most
uncomfortable

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:29.088
is never buying Magnum condoms.

00:01:29.121 --> 00:01:30.356
(laughter)

00:01:30.389 --> 00:01:33.326
'Cause they always point
at them first, like these?

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:34.894
They should let you buy
condoms on your own,

00:01:34.927 --> 00:01:36.963
you shouldn't have to tell
someone which box that is.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:37.897
(laughter)

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.699
- I was helping my Dad out, and
I bought,

00:01:39.732 --> 00:01:41.868
I had to go in the same cashier,

00:01:41.901 --> 00:01:44.804
I got my Dad's colonoscopy prep
medication

00:01:44.837 --> 00:01:47.373
for the next day, and condoms
and the lady was like,

00:01:47.406 --> 00:01:48.674
what the fuck, what's going on
tonight?

00:01:48.707 --> 00:01:49.541
(laughter)

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:50.843
I was like, you don't even know,
lady.

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:52.178
Have you gotten a colonoscopy
yet?

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:53.146
- Not a colonoscopy--

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.980
- I have.

00:01:54.013 --> 00:01:54.814
- Really?

00:01:54.847 --> 00:01:55.882
- Oh yeah.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:56.682
- I've had plenty of
doctor's fingers up my ass.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:57.583
At least he said we was a
doctor.

00:01:57.616 --> 00:01:59.018
(laughter)

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:00.086
(guitar stab)

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.420
- Alright bud. Do you have
a name for your penis?

00:02:01.453 --> 00:02:02.255
- No.

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:03.122
- No?

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:04.957
- I've had a girl say the word
'chode',

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.260
watch we get one sad tear
forming

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.095
and then go: no it's a good
thing.

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:10.863
- Know what I call my penis?
Little Italy!

00:02:10.896 --> 00:02:12.565
(laughter)

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:13.966
That's what it is!

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.468
(guitar stab)

00:02:15.501 --> 00:02:17.203
Jay we both have daughters,
so what would you

00:02:17.236 --> 00:02:19.172
rather have your daughter come
home with?

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:20.606
Would you rather have her come
home

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:22.975
with a professional athlete
or a professional singer?

00:02:23.008 --> 00:02:26.212
- You know what? I'll say,
this is in my own interests,

00:02:26.245 --> 00:02:28.981
I'm gonna go with musician,
rock star musician.

00:02:29.014 --> 00:02:30.182
- Yeah.

00:02:30.215 --> 00:02:33.519
- Because you could always
have access to that world then.

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:35.521
With sports, if it's not my home
team,

00:02:35.554 --> 00:02:36.455
I don't want her dating someone
from

00:02:36.488 --> 00:02:37.423
- Yeah.

00:02:37.456 --> 00:02:39.325
- some other team that might
beat my team.

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:40.192
- Yeah, that's true.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:41.327
- I don't want her dating like a
Piston.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.161
- Yeah.

00:02:42.194 --> 00:02:43.229
- Or a Houston Rocket.

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:45.531
- (grunts) Yeah, that's a good
point.

00:02:45.564 --> 00:02:48.067
- What if I have to go
Cleveland for a playoff game?

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.735
(disgusted grunts)

00:02:49.768 --> 00:02:51.237
(guitar stab)

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.205
- Alright Jay, thanks so much

00:02:52.238 --> 00:02:53.706
for being a part of Stupid
Questions.

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:54.840
- Thank you for having me.

00:02:54.874 --> 00:02:55.575
- You know, you're my boy,
I appreciate it you know.

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:56.909
I wanna give you a stupid gift.

00:02:56.942 --> 00:02:58.143
- OK.

00:02:58.177 --> 00:02:59.345
- Is that cool? I got two stupid
gifts 'cause you're my boy.

00:02:59.378 --> 00:03:02.081
- I got so much room in my
stupid house for stupid gifts.

00:03:02.114 --> 00:03:05.685
- First thing is, you always
wear fingerless gloves,

00:03:05.718 --> 00:03:07.220
so toeless socks.

00:03:07.253 --> 00:03:08.121
- What!

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:10.156
- There you go cuz, with the
grippings.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:12.058
And then also, last time we were
hanging

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.193
you said that, you know,
you were like cutting carbs,

00:03:14.226 --> 00:03:15.695
so I just got you hot dogs.

00:03:15.728 --> 00:03:16.596
- Straight up hot dogs?

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:17.563
- Straight up just the meat,
cuz.

00:03:17.596 --> 00:03:18.430
- Raw?

00:03:18.464 --> 00:03:19.665
- Yeah, and we were also talking
a lot

00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:21.234
about our penises today,
so I got you a second

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:22.068
bag of hot dogs.

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:22.902
- Oh, what!

00:03:22.935 --> 00:03:24.103
- There you go, man.
- That's great.

00:03:24.136 --> 00:03:24.937
- Is that stupid or what?

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.305
- Raw too, it's like baloney
sticks.

00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:27.273
(laughter)

00:03:27.306 --> 00:03:28.340
- Alright everybody,

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.476

Big Jay Oakerson, Comedy
Central Radio's Sirius XM,

I appreciate you being here,

00:03:36.615 --> 00:03:38.851
I gave you hot dogs and toeless
socks.

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:39.685
- Stupid fart.

00:03:39.718 --> 00:03:40.553
- Good night.

00:03:40.586 --> 00:03:41.988
