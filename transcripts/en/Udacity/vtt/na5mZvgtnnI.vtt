00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.800
So here's a machine that is sometimes referred to

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.750
as Pavlov named after the Russian psychologists who was

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.810
studying gastric juices and then figured out how animals

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:11.690
learn. So I don't know why it's called that

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.190
in this particular case but, here's what the machine

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.780
looks like. It says start off cooperating and as

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.112
long as the opponent keeps cooperating, then cooperate. So,

00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:20.490
so far it sounds a lot like tit for tat.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.010
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.675
&gt;&gt; If you defect the then move to the defect state. So,

00:00:24.675 --> 00:00:27.465
okay still looks like tit for tat. And

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:30.065
again, this defect state has two arrows coming

00:00:30.065 --> 00:00:34.310
out of it. But their reversed from what they were in tit for tat. Here it

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.390
says, if you cooperate with me, I will

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.830
continue to defect [LAUGH] against you. But if

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.420
you defect against me, then I'm willing to

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.550
cooperate with you. So, that's a little strange, right?

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.030
&gt;&gt; That is a little strange, yes.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.300
&gt;&gt; So, you know, the way to get me to stop defecting against

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.540
you is to defect against me. And then, I I become cooperative again.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.500
&gt;&gt; So, in other words, take advantage of you

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.740
until you sort of, pull a trigger on me.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.420
&gt;&gt; Seems like it. Yeah.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.180
&gt;&gt; It's a funny thing. So so again, so tit for tat is like repeat

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.680
what the opponent did. Pavlov is basically cooperate

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.690
as long as we're agreeing. If we both

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.810
defect, I'll cooperate. If we both cooperate, I'll

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.290
cooperate. But if we disagree, if I dis,

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.760
if I defect and you cooperate or you cooperate and I defect, then I will defect

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.200
against you on the next round. That sort of makes sense.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.930
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.590
&gt;&gt; Yeah, right? I mean, it says: if you're cooperating, I'm going to

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.290
cooperate. If, we're both going to start out cooperating. And then if you ever

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.860
defect on me, then you have basically attacked me, and so I'm going

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.920
to defect on you. Unless you start cooperating again, in which case I think

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.470
that you're, you're being reasonable, because of what I

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.770
did, and so now we're going to start cooperating again.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.507
&gt;&gt; Except that's tit for tat [LAUGH].

00:01:49.507 --> 00:01:51.010
&gt;&gt; No, you're right. You're right, I, I take

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.350
it back. It doesn't make any sense, too many.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.490
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's weird. It's a little bit weird.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.780
&gt;&gt; too many V's. Too many V's.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.490
&gt;&gt; Too many V's?

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.691
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:56.691 --> 00:01:57.320
&gt;&gt; In Pavlov.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.800
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.490
&gt;&gt; Two V's. Yeah, but you can think of them being like arrowheads.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.310
&gt;&gt; Oh well then that makes much more sense.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.080
&gt;&gt; Yeah, exactly.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.620
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.170
&gt;&gt; Yeah, so it's this weird thing where I'm going

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:10.660
to continue to defect against you until you realize I'm hurting you, you punch

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.670
me once. [SOUND] And now okay, good, we're even again. We good? Yeah we're good.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.820
&gt;&gt; Oh this is like men on a basketball court.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah, sure but, now here's the question.

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.120
Is this Nash? So, we'll make that a quiz.
