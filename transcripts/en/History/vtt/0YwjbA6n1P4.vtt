00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:03.903
MIKE: Danielle is
sending us to see Bob.

00:00:03.903 --> 00:00:08.007
Apparently his grandson says
he's got a ton of stuff.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:09.275
MIKE: This dude is
off the beaten track.

00:00:09.275 --> 00:00:10.543
FRANK: I know.

00:00:10.543 --> 00:00:14.314
I don't even see any signs.

00:00:14.314 --> 00:00:16.750
Hey, what's this up here?
A bunch of buildings.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.817
MIKE: This is mega.

00:00:17.817 --> 00:00:19.519
FRANK: Let me get a flyer out.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.855
[dog barking]

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.223
MIKE: Well, there he is,
right here.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:26.259
Must be the grandson.
[dog barking]

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:28.828
MIKE: Hey-hey!

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:30.563
Man, you guys are off
the beaten path a little bit.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:32.565
DAVE: Oh, a little bit.
MIKE: Nice to meet you.

00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:33.967
DAVE: Dave; nice to meet you.
FRANK: How're you doing?

00:00:33.967 --> 00:00:35.168
DAVE: My grandpa's farm.
He's got, uh...

00:00:35.168 --> 00:00:36.703
a little bit of everything
for you guys to look at.

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:38.304
MIKE: Yeah, I see he's got
a lot of stuff outside.

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.639
DAVE: Yeah, he doesn't
go anywhere without

00:00:39.639 --> 00:00:41.174
bringing back something.
MIKE: No kiddin'.

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.243
DAVE: These barns are just
getting fuller by the day.

00:00:43.243 --> 00:00:44.644
He has trouble letting
go of some stuff.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:46.813
FRANK: Sure.
DAVE: Right through here.

00:00:46.813 --> 00:00:48.248
MIKE: Hey-hey.
FRANK: Hello.

00:00:48.248 --> 00:00:50.049
BOB: Hello.
MIKE: How are you?

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:51.117
BOB: Wonderful.

00:00:51.117 --> 00:00:52.285
DAVE: This is my
grandfather, Bob.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:53.953
MIKE: Hey , Bob.
FRANK: Hey, Bob, I'm Frank.

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:55.355
BOB: Hi, Frank.
FRANK: Nice to meet you, sir.

00:00:55.355 --> 00:00:56.656
MIKE: Alright.

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:58.625
So, you were told
we were coming, right?

00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:02.362
BOB: I heard someone was coming
that might buy some of my junk.

00:01:02.362 --> 00:01:05.565
MIKE: Alright, well,
we buy a lot of junk.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:08.802
BOB: It's easier for me to
tell you what I don't collect

00:01:08.802 --> 00:01:10.603
than what I do collect.
MIKE: Choo!

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:11.871
FRANK: You got a lot
to look at here.

00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:13.573
DAVE: We can't go
to a garage sale

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.008
without him filling the truck.

00:01:15.008 --> 00:01:16.443
MIKE: Can we look
around a little bit?

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:17.610
BOB: You bet.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.912
MIKE: Whoa.

00:01:18.912 --> 00:01:21.781
BOB: I can't stand to see
anybody throw anything away.

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:24.851
If I see things selling
ridiculously cheap,

00:01:24.851 --> 00:01:28.455
I have to buy it, whether I got
any interest in it or not.

00:01:28.455 --> 00:01:31.658
FRANK: So you collected
a little bit of axes and saws

00:01:31.658 --> 00:01:33.426
and primitives and tools.

00:01:33.426 --> 00:01:36.162
BOB: I now refer
to it as a disease.

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:38.364
FRANK: Bob, what
about this gauge?

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:39.365
BOB: It's for sale.

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:40.967
FRANK: It's for sale.
BOB: Yeah.

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:44.204
FRANK: It's a brass gauge.

00:01:44.204 --> 00:01:45.905
Alright, someone has put...

00:01:45.905 --> 00:01:48.007
somebody's put a clock
mechanism in the back there...

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:50.944
and turned it into a clock.
BOB: [laughs]

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.679
FRANK: 40 bucks.

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:54.848
BOB: You got a deal.
FRANK: Alright, you got it.

00:01:54.848 --> 00:01:57.116
MIKE: Bob, there
was something here,

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:58.918
and that was probably signage.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.654
You know, the paper sign
or the cardboard sign

00:02:01.654 --> 00:02:03.223
would drop to the top of that.
BOB: I understand.

00:02:03.223 --> 00:02:04.557
MIKE: And that would hold that.

00:02:04.557 --> 00:02:05.892
45.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:07.360
BOB: Okay.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.895
MIKE: Alright, I appreciate it.

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:10.396
FRANK: Bob is in the mode
for selling.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:13.266
He's got over 70,000
articles in here.

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:14.767
He's ready to
get rid of stuff.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.135
FRANK: Hey Bob.
BOB: Yeah.

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:17.670
FRANK: This is
a little box here.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.507
And I found this, this is
a dry chem fire extinguisher.

00:02:20.507 --> 00:02:22.509
These two items,
would you sell it?

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:25.044
BOB: Of course.
FRANK: Okay, so 40 on the box.

00:02:25.044 --> 00:02:26.746
BOB: Yeah.
FRANK: 20 on the extinguisher?

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:28.448
BOB: Alrighty.
FRANK: Good deal.

00:02:28.448 --> 00:02:30.617
BOB: I'm getting
a little long in the tooth.

00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:33.520
If this stuff stays here,
the kids will probably end up

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.788
selling them for
10 cents on the dollar.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.490
MIKE: Let me see this chair.

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.392
Put that on the ground,
let me see if the legs...

00:02:39.392 --> 00:02:40.560
FRANK: It's wooden.
MIKE: Yeah, I know.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.794
That's what's
interesting about it.

00:02:41.794 --> 00:02:44.430
The backrest part right here...
FRANK: Adjustable.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.532
MIKE: ...is wood.

00:02:45.532 --> 00:02:47.800
The bottom of it adjusts too.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.102
FRANK: Oh, I see.
MIKE: Oh, look at that.

00:02:49.102 --> 00:02:50.403
Whoa.
You see that, Bob?

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:51.938
BOB: Holy smokes,
the price just went up....

00:02:51.938 --> 00:02:53.106
MIKE: [laughs]
BOB: ...about $50.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:54.374
FRANK: As it went up,
the price went up.

00:02:54.374 --> 00:02:55.508
MIKE: 100 bucks.

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:56.876
BOB: Each?

00:02:56.876 --> 00:03:00.446
MIKE: No.
[laughs]

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:02.549
[laughter]

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:04.117
FRANK: You know, you
always hope you're gonna

00:03:04.117 --> 00:03:06.386
meet great people,
and you also hope

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:08.621
you're gonna meet somebody
that has a great collection.

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.890
Well, today, we got both.

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:11.891
[honks horn]
FRANK: See you, Dave!

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.594
See you, Bob!
