00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.083
In Odessa when someone’s house settles oddly

00:00:03.208 --> 00:00:04.959
or their water line breaks

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:06.542
or their pet goes missing

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:10.458
It’s not uncommon for them to curse
those goddamn catacombs

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:18.001
Underneath Odessa is the largest catacomb system

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:19.166
in the world!

00:00:19.166 --> 00:00:22.001
with over a 1000 miles of unexplored tunnels

00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:26.000
and a total length of 2500 kilometers

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.208
That is more than the distance from Odessa to Paris

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.792
From the end of the 1700s on people have been

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:39.166
mining and quarrying limestone out of the catacombs

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.125
both legitimately and illegitimately

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:45.500
the catacombs also became the preferred hideout of

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.166
eccentrics, smugglers, criminals of any kind

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:52.875
during the wars, especially world war II

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:56.083
huge groups of soldiers lived in these catacombs for over a year

00:00:56.083 --> 00:01:00.458
in the 1960s they became home to catacomb explorers

00:01:00.458 --> 00:01:05.959
every year the founding catacombs exploration group called “Poisk" or “the search”

00:01:05.959 --> 00:01:07.667
performs a huge mapping expedition

00:01:07.667 --> 00:01:10.000
they take forty people below ground

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.291
they cook dinner down there, they spend four days underneath the surface of Odessa

00:01:14.291 --> 00:01:17.417
and they map an unexplored part of the catacombs

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:20.667
but it’s slow work, it’s ten, twenty, thirty kilometers at a time

00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:26.875
which at thirty kilometers a year, they should be finished in about thirty years

00:01:26.875 --> 00:01:30.250
that catacombs of course, for these explorers

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.583
are dangerous places

00:01:32.583 --> 00:01:38.792
in 2005 a group of Ukrainian teenagers went into the catacombs to celebrate New Years

00:01:38.792 --> 00:01:40.709
they were hanging out, they were drinking

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:43.709
and a young girl named Masha wandered off

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:46.166
and they couldn’t find her

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.750
in fact the catacombs are so large,

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.291
they didn’t retrieve her body for two years

00:01:53.291 --> 00:01:56.625
the catacombs are a problem for Odessa

00:01:56.625 --> 00:02:00.875
people are channeling their sewage directly into the catacombs

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:04.583
which makes exploring them potentially extremely gross

00:02:04.583 --> 00:02:07.375
that sewage weakens the limestone

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:09.667
and can cause the tunnels to cave in

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:13.667
left to their own devices they are all going to slowly dissolve

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.122
taking down the city of Odessa with them...
