00:19:24.930 --> 00:19:24.940 align:start position:0%
so on so very basically I guess there
 

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.539 align:start position:0%
so on so very basically I guess there
are<00:19:24.970><c> a</c><00:19:25.419><c> two</c><00:19:25.929><c> two-way</c><00:19:26.650><c> relationship</c><00:19:26.770><c> going</c><00:19:27.400><c> on</c>

00:19:27.539 --> 00:19:27.549 align:start position:0%
are a two two-way relationship going on
 

00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:29.970 align:start position:0%
are a two two-way relationship going on
right<00:19:27.850><c> so</c><00:19:28.630><c> what</c><00:19:28.780><c> we</c><00:19:28.929><c> expect</c><00:19:29.020><c> to</c><00:19:29.350><c> put</c><00:19:29.710><c> in</c><00:19:29.799><c> place</c>

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:29.980 align:start position:0%

00:20:18.299 --> 00:20:18.309 align:start position:0%
would act you would have access to some
 

00:20:18.309 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
would act you would have access to some

of the greatest minds on campus some of

00:20:22.169 --> 00:20:22.179 align:start position:0%
which were and display earlier this
 

00:20:22.179 --> 00:20:24.630 align:start position:0%
which were and display earlier this
afternoon<00:20:22.240><c> on</c><00:20:22.809><c> the</c><00:20:22.960><c> faculty</c><00:20:23.500><c> panel</c><00:20:24.070><c> and</c><00:20:24.220><c> then</c>

00:20:24.630 --> 00:20:24.640 align:start position:0%
afternoon on the faculty panel and then
 

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:27.090 align:start position:0%
afternoon on the faculty panel and then
access<00:20:24.970><c> to</c><00:20:25.120><c> some</c><00:20:25.870><c> of</c><00:20:25.960><c> these</c><00:20:26.080><c> students</c><00:20:26.920><c> right</c>

00:20:27.090 --> 00:20:27.100 align:start position:0%
access to some of these students right
 

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:27.990 align:start position:0%
access to some of these students right
so<00:20:27.190><c> I</c><00:20:27.220><c> guess</c><00:20:27.370><c> that</c><00:20:27.520><c> was</c><00:20:27.580><c> mentioned</c><00:20:27.790><c> earlier</c>

00:20:27.990 --> 00:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
so I guess that was mentioned earlier
 

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.299 align:start position:0%
so I guess that was mentioned earlier
one<00:20:28.660><c> of</c><00:20:28.720><c> the</c><00:20:28.809><c> biggest</c><00:20:29.050><c> assets</c><00:20:29.230><c> on</c><00:20:29.590><c> campus</c><00:20:30.190><c> are</c>

00:20:30.299 --> 00:20:30.309 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest assets on campus are
 

00:20:30.309 --> 00:20:31.650 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest assets on campus are
really<00:20:30.490><c> the</c><00:20:30.610><c> students</c><00:20:30.970><c> that</c><00:20:31.030><c> we</c><00:20:31.179><c> have</c>

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:31.660 align:start position:0%
really the students that we have
 

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
really the students that we have
so<00:20:32.110><c> basically</c><00:20:32.380><c> otherwise</c><00:20:32.710><c> that</c><00:20:33.160><c> but</c><00:20:33.580><c> we'll</c>

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:33.730 align:start position:0%
so basically otherwise that but we'll
 

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:35.790 align:start position:0%
so basically otherwise that but we'll
put<00:20:33.910><c> this</c><00:20:34.030><c> framework</c><00:20:34.540><c> very</c><00:20:35.320><c> formally</c><00:20:35.740><c> in</c>

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:35.800 align:start position:0%
