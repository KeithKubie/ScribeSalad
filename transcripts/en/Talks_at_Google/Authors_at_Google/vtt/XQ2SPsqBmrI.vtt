[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.340
SPEAKER: I'm very excited
to have Professor Erika

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.020
Lee with us today to discuss
her widely acclaimed book,

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.640
"The Making of Asia American."

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.820
This book has been featured
in the "New York Times,"

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.630
"LA Times," and also
"The New Yorker."

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.230
Professor Lee, we
are really honored

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.520
for you to be here today.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.980
And welcome home, and
welcome to Google.

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.280
And everyone please welcome
Professor Erika Lee.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.525
Thank you so much.

00:00:34.525 --> 00:00:36.850
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:40.370
ERIKA LEE: Hi, everyone.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.520
Thank you so much for coming.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.800
You have to also
thank George and Amy.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.190
They are very, very persistent.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.420
They invited me to come out to
Google a couple of months ago,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.410
I think.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.560
And after several conversations,
they wore me down.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.880
And here I am.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.840
It's really a
pleasure to be here.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:09.120
I'm going to start with
two different stories.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.510
And it's also a little
bit of family history.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.080
My family's history is
the story of America

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.900
as a nation of
immigrants, a country that

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.090
has welcomed immigrants
and helped them

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.941
achieve their American dreams.

00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:26.440
From the beginning of the 19th
century through the beginning

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.570
of the 20th century,
the United States

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.920
welcomed over 3/5 of
the world's immigrants.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.620
It remained the world's largest
immigrant-receiving country

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.330
during the 20th century.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:40.750
Today, the United States
admits more immigrants

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.930
than any other
country, over a million

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.720
per year, which is about
20% of the world's migrants.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.000
My grandfather,
[INAUDIBLE], was one

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.040
of the millions who came
to the United States

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.410
in the early 20th century.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.140
He had been an orphan
struggling to make

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.300
ends meet as a farmer on a tiny
plot of land in southern China.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.979
Generations of Lees had
farmed these rocky hills

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.220
in [INAUDIBLE]
Village right outside

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.900
of Guangzhou, southern China.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.050
But by the early
1900s, Grandfather

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.410
told me he was killing
himself for nothing.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.780
And he was not alone
in his struggle.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.870
Entire villages in
the Pearl River Delta

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.360
of Guangdong Province emptied
out as working-age men

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:30.886
sought their futures elsewhere.

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:32.260
They went to
Southeast Asia, they

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.320
went to Australia, Canada,
Mexico, and the United States.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.010
What the hell kind
of life I have,

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.200
Grandfather remembered thinking.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.100
I suffer.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.500
My eye is just looking
for a way to get out.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.040
I want to live.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.970
So I came to the United States.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.490
He arrived in San
Francisco on June 30, 1918.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.550
And life was a struggle.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.200
He suffered and shuffled from
one low-paying job to another.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.650
He worked as a domestic
servant in San Francisco

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.020
and also as a cook.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.600
He perfected a
recipe for apple pie

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.030
when I was doing an oral
history with him in college.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.150
He went on and on about how
good this apple pie was.

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.880
The secret, he told
me, is butter crust

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.320
with a little bit of lemon zest.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.980
And another recipe
for roasted pork.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.482
He followed a cousin
out to Philadelphia,

00:03:23.482 --> 00:03:24.940
where the wages
were higher, and he

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.940
worked in a Chinese restaurant.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:31.550
He saved up enough money
to return to China,

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.470
marry my grandmother, and
bring her over on a first class

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:37.270
steamship ticket.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.890
They then moved to
Buffalo, New York,

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.670
where they worked day and
night in the restaurant

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.980
and also in laundries, all
while raising seven children.

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.260
Grandfather proudly became a
naturalized US citizen in 1946.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.270
At a time when
the model minority

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.190
image of Asian
Americans was just

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.490
becoming part of
American popular culture,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.910
my grandparents came to
represent the epitome

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.820
of American success.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.390
My grandmother was even named
mother of the year in Buffalo

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.090
in the late 1950s.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.880
Three sons became
doctors, one became

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.959
a dentist, another an engineer.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.860
A daughter became a pharmacist
and another one an educator.

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.620
My grandparents loved America.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.770
They were thankful for the
country that had allowed them

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.990
to live their American dreams.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.350
And by the 1980s, my grandfather
was an unabashed supporter

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.530
of President Ronald Reagan
and his hope-filled vision

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.610
of America.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.970
You could not enter their
house without passing

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.380
by this framed portrait
of President Reagan.

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.140
So that's one part of the story.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.930
The other part is another
story, and that is America

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:58.560
as a nation of xenophobia.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.870
My family's history is also the
story of American xenophobia

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.630
and its hatred of immigrants.

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.570
Anti-immigrant sentiment
and immigration restriction

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:14.160
have been a constant feature
of our American history.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:15.840
Over the decades,
we have gradually

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.710
closed our doors to an
expanding number of immigrants--

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.170
the poor, the
disabled, those who

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:24.600
are considered
mentally inferior,

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.420
persons with suspect
morals, including

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.850
homosexuals, polygamists,
anarchist, Asians, and now

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.390
Muslims.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.310
Today, only those with family
already in the United States

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.820
or those with needed
professional skills--

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.820
targeted as those with
exceptional ability--

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.500
can easily enter the country.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:49.890
Otherwise, the
waiting time for many

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.310
is not just years
long, but decades long.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:55.410
Those who somehow make
it into the United States

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:59.190
without documentation
or overstay their visas

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:03.540
are under constant threat
of arrest and deportation.

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:06.000
Since 2008, the
United States has

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.560
deported a record 3.8
million immigrants.

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:16.710
In 2016 alone, the United
States deported 240,000 people.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.740
That same year, Donald
Trump was elected president

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.030
on a platform to build
the wall, deport millions

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:28.350
of undocumented immigrants, and
ban all Muslims from entering

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:31.070
the country.

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.610
My grandfather, [INAUDIBLE],
was unlucky enough

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:36.710
to try to immigrate
to the United States

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:40.160
during this high
point of xenophobia

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.640
when the US's Chinese Exclusion
Act was the law of the land.

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.230
This is a law that was passed
in 1882, May 6th, 1882.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:52.190
We're actually getting ready to
recognize the 135th anniversary

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.440
of that law.

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.820
And this is a law that--
it was a temporary ban,

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.890
a temporary ban on
Chinese laborers.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:02.300
It did still allow
certain exempt classes

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.370
to still come into
the United States--

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.370
merchants, teachers, travelers,
diplomats, and students.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.820
But the vast majority of
Chinese-- mostly working

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.150
class and unskilled
laborers-- were banned.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:19.880
This is the first
time in US history

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:24.020
that we've singled out an
immigrant group for exclusion

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:27.352
on the basis of their
race and their class.

00:07:27.352 --> 00:07:29.060
So remember, my
grandfather is an orphan.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:30.260
He's a farmer.

00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.520
He is not a merchant.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.940
He's not a student, a teacher,
traveler, or diplomat.

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.160
The only way for him
to enter the country

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:42.980
during the exclusion era is
to come with false papers.

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:45.590
He came under the
name of Yee Shew Ning.

00:07:45.590 --> 00:07:49.220
You can see that on
his arrival certificate

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:54.860
here-- the son of a merchant who
was, in fact, not his father.

00:07:54.860 --> 00:07:57.530
The Chinese refer to
immigrants like my grandfather

00:07:57.530 --> 00:08:00.340
as paper sons.

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:05.470
Under law, he was
an illegal alien.

00:08:05.470 --> 00:08:07.840
When interrogated by US
immigration officials

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.110
in San Francisco at the Angel
Island Immigration Station,

00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:15.580
Grandfather was
asked 145 questions.

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:18.780
And his answers were
checked and rechecked

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.720
in cross-examinations
with his relatives.

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:26.100
How many rows in
your home village,

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:31.580
asked Inspector [? Hemstreit ?]
on July 10th, 1918.

00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:36.720
Who lives in the third house
from the head of the village?

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.020
Give the names of husband,
wife, and children

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:43.470
who all live there.

00:08:43.470 --> 00:08:47.790
He was also sent to the hospital
for a medical examination.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:50.790
He was stripped naked, and
physicians meticulously

00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:55.950
examined his teeth, his skin,
his hair, his sexual organs,

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:59.070
and his bones and
noted their findings

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.410
in his immigration file.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:05.770
He was detained in the crowded
and unsanitary barracks

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:09.380
of the immigration
station for two weeks.

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:13.130
For the most part, his
answers, as part of those 145

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:17.150
different questions, matched
those of his paper father,

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:21.540
and grandfather was allowed
to enter the United States.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.540
Before he left Angel
Island, however, he

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:27.880
was required to register
with the government.

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.500
He was issued what was called
a certificate of identity,

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.420
a form of identification
only required of Chinese

00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:40.380
and Chinese-Americans
in the United States.

00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:45.000
He was instructed to keep
it with him at all time,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.360
because he might be
stopped on the street.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.790
Immigration officials might
demand to see his papers.

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:56.770
And if he did not have them, he
could be arrested and deported.

00:09:56.770 --> 00:10:01.750
In 1947, Grandfather became
a naturalized citizen.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.190
This was important
for two reasons.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:08.710
First, he was no longer
an illegal alien.

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:11.980
He benefited from a
pathway to citizenship

00:10:11.980 --> 00:10:15.280
that was made possible when
President Franklin Delano

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.480
Roosevelt signed the repeal
of the Chinese Exclusion Act

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:22.190
in 1943.

00:10:22.190 --> 00:10:24.350
The second reason
why this is important

00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:28.520
is because he was able
to take back his name.

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:31.010
If you can see that
document up on the screen,

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:35.930
you can see that it says that
the petitioner is changing

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:42.950
his name from Shew Ning Yee,
his paper name, to Wallace Lee.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:47.040
My grandfather is
quite a character.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:51.890
He was very proud, of course,
to be in the United States.

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:56.000
But he wanted to be here
under his real name.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.230
And so he told the judge, when
he was becoming naturalized,

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:03.140
that while they were doing
this whole American citizenship

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:06.560
thing, might we not
change my name to-- this

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.780
is very common for
immigrants when they're

00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:13.070
becoming naturalized, to take
on an Americanized first name.

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:17.300
But he's changing his last
name, which is not as common.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:21.000
And when the judge asked why,
my grandfather, of course,

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.440
did not say because I
came in with false papers

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.760
under this different name.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:30.380
He said, Judge, I
have seven kids,

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:33.880
and the teacher makes
them sit alphabetically

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:34.940
in the classroom.

00:11:34.940 --> 00:11:36.440
So they're all the
way in the back.

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:39.110
They can't see the board.

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.260
So I'm going to
change our last name--

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:47.930
maybe something in the middle
of the alphabet, like Lee.

00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:50.300
That's the story he told,
and I don't doubt it.

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:58.480
Decades later, after he
became a naturalized citizen

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.750
in the 1980s, the president that
grandfather admired so much,

00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:05.950
President Ronald Reagan,
would grant a pathway

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:08.950
to citizenship-- grant amnesty--

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:11.020
to over three
million undocumented

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:16.050
immigrants, mostly from
Mexico and Central America.

00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:21.320
So I've just told two different
versions of the same family

00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:22.760
history--

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.380
one that is very
uplifting and positive,

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:31.100
fulfilling America's promise
as a nation of immigrants,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:34.250
but another that is a
little bit less positive,

00:12:34.250 --> 00:12:39.080
one that focuses on closed
doors, gates, deportation,

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:43.370
registry, living
under false papers.

00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:47.960
How do these two
stories fit together?

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:51.110
This is the history of
American immigration.

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:53.360
It's the story of
immigrant dreams turning

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.080
into American realities,
but it is also

00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:02.600
a story of xenophobia and
immigrant scapegoating.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.680
It's neither one or the other.

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.320
They coexist.

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:10.010
They intersect with each
other in a complicated way.

00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.160
They both speak
truths about America,

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:17.030
and they work in
tandem together.

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.160
As a country, the
United States, we

00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:20.710
have depended on immigration.

00:13:20.710 --> 00:13:22.400
We have recruited immigrants.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.890
We have welcomed them.

00:13:24.890 --> 00:13:29.790
And we have also evacuated and
resettled refugees in need.

00:13:29.790 --> 00:13:33.450
Yet throughout our history,
we have also banned many

00:13:33.450 --> 00:13:37.020
immigrants-- the poor, the
illiterate, and entire groups--

00:13:37.020 --> 00:13:41.400
based on their
nationality or religion.

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.100
We have established
an ideological test

00:13:44.100 --> 00:13:46.440
for immigrant admission.

00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:49.290
We have been slow to
answer the call of refugees

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:50.970
fleeing persecution.

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:54.030
We forcibly relocated
and incarcerated

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:57.170
120,000 Japanese-Americans
during World War

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:01.320
II on the mistaken basis
of military necessity,

00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:04.890
or in today's language,
national security.

00:14:04.890 --> 00:14:08.250
We have required certain
groups to register with the US

00:14:08.250 --> 00:14:10.680
government so that we can
better track their movements

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.220
and keep them under
surveillance--

00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:15.600
Chinese-Americans,
like my grandparents

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:21.030
in the early 20th century,
and Muslims 100 years later.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:24.210
Our immigration laws have
not kept up with the times

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:28.290
and cannot flexibly respond
to changing labor and societal

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:29.160
needs.

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.170
As a result, we
have a long history

00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:34.080
of undocumented immigration.

00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.180
We have depended on the labor
of undocumented immigrants.

00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:39.980
But when we don't
need them, we've

00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:42.500
also deported them
in the millions,

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:46.280
sometimes under the guise
of voluntary repatriation,

00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.130
sometimes by brutal force.

00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:51.530
And those that are forced
to leave the country

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:54.170
include longtime
residents, US citizens,

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:58.340
and parents of US citizens.

00:14:58.340 --> 00:15:02.960
I'm sure that we know that
history, that Ellis Island

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:07.250
history, of America's
welcome to immigrants.

00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:10.220
That's something that is
taught in fourth grade,

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:13.670
and also in sixth grade, and
throughout our high school

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.580
years in the US.

00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:21.710
But we know less about our
history of banning immigrants.

00:15:21.710 --> 00:15:23.900
With the US debate
over immigration

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:28.280
at an all time high and
with drastic new changes

00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.450
on every aspect of
immigration underway,

00:15:32.450 --> 00:15:34.700
there's never been a
more important time

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:37.460
to explore this
forgotten history

00:15:37.460 --> 00:15:42.740
and to consider what
it means for us today.

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:44.960
The history of Asian-Americans
that I write about

00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.240
in "The Making of
Asian America" is

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:50.180
especially important
to understanding

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:53.510
these two different sides
of the United States.

00:15:53.510 --> 00:15:57.380
Asian-Americans are an
extremely diverse conglomeration

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:03.390
of peoples who make up 23
different ethnic groups.

00:16:03.390 --> 00:16:05.700
But together,
they've experienced

00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:11.230
both the limits and the
possibilities of America.

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:14.050
So let's go back to that
nation of immigrants part

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:16.960
of the story one more time.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:20.890
It can be argued that no
other group has represented

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:25.360
the vast complexity and scope
and diversity of immigration

00:16:25.360 --> 00:16:28.360
to America than Asian-Americans.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.630
Asians, for example,
have been recruited.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:32.770
They have been brought.

00:16:32.770 --> 00:16:33.880
They've been sent.

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:35.410
They've willingly gone.

00:16:35.410 --> 00:16:36.760
They've married into.

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.890
They've been adopted into.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:41.950
They've been accepted,
rejected, repatriated,

00:16:41.950 --> 00:16:45.100
and deported from
the United States.

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.520
They have come as refugees,
as international students,

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:53.020
as undocumented immigrants
and picture brides as well as

00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:56.470
high-tech workers.

00:16:56.470 --> 00:17:01.390
In the mid 19th century up
through the mid 20th century,

00:17:01.390 --> 00:17:06.000
Chinese, then Japanese, Koreans,
Filipinos, and South Asians

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.670
were recruited to help
build the United States.

00:17:09.670 --> 00:17:11.650
They blasted through
mountains to build

00:17:11.650 --> 00:17:13.869
the country's first
transcontinental railroad.

00:17:13.869 --> 00:17:15.530
They mined for gold and silver.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:18.819
They worked in the lumber
mills in the Pacific Northwest

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:21.730
and on the sugar
plantations in Hawaii.

00:17:21.730 --> 00:17:25.150
They turned this
land that was once

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.359
barren into the
agricultural empire

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:31.270
that California is today.

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:34.120
And in the 20th century,
an even greater diversity

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:38.560
of Asian immigrants have come
to the United States as well.

00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:40.780
Following World War
II, the United States

00:17:40.780 --> 00:17:43.940
increased its presence
throughout Asia,

00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:46.480
especially in places
like Japan and Korea,

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.670
as part of the Cold War.

00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.690
As a result, new Asian
immigration journeys began.

00:17:52.690 --> 00:17:57.520
[INAUDIBLE] Swartz married an
American soldier, left her home

00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.190
in Okinawa in 1966.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.970
That same year, [INAUDIBLE]
was adopted from Korea

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:08.450
and brought to Palo Alto, where
she grew up as Deann Borshay.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:11.470
Deeann Borshay is now a
very well-known filmmaker

00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:19.900
whose films on Korean adoption
are quite powerful and popular.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:23.230
These new arrivals
married into or were

00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:26.170
adopted into American
families and came

00:18:26.170 --> 00:18:28.810
to represent a new
Asian America that

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.830
was less threatening,
able to become American,

00:18:32.830 --> 00:18:35.380
and represented a
sign of more positive

00:18:35.380 --> 00:18:40.650
US-Asian international
relations.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:43.530
The aftermath of the
wars in Southeast Asia

00:18:43.530 --> 00:18:48.540
sent 1.2 million Vietnamese Lao,
Hmong, and Cambodian refugees

00:18:48.540 --> 00:18:52.800
to the United States
fleeing war and persecution.

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:57.150
130,000 Vietnamese were
evacuated from April

00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:00.880
to December of 1975 alone.

00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:05.580
That's a massive
humanitarian effort, 130,000

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.620
in those few short months.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:12.750
We had not established a
concrete, centralized refugee

00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:14.220
resettlement program before.

00:19:14.220 --> 00:19:17.780
So the fact that we did
that in those months

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:20.250
is quite staggering.

00:19:20.250 --> 00:19:22.890
A million more from
Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia

00:19:22.890 --> 00:19:26.700
fled on their own to
refugee camps in Thailand

00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:30.790
and elsewhere over
the next few decades.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:36.560
These are stories that we're
just beginning to know.

00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:41.030
The trauma of war have kept
many of those stories hidden

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:42.360
within families.

00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:49.390
They're slowly leaking out and
becoming more widely known.

00:19:49.390 --> 00:19:52.330
I direct the only immigration
history research center

00:19:52.330 --> 00:19:53.760
in the country.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:58.750
It's at the University
of Minnesota.

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:01.930
And we've been working
for several years

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.860
to try to preserve the
histories of the communities

00:20:05.860 --> 00:20:11.320
around us, but also of the most
recent immigrants and refugees.

00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.140
To do this, we decided
to do something

00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:16.510
different than the
traditional oral history

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:19.240
where we come with a
clipboard and ask questions.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:23.440
We wanted to give the power
of storytelling to immigrants

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:25.100
and refugees themselves.

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:27.180
I know I'm at a tech
company, and it's

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:31.230
a little awkward for a historian
to be pitching a tech idea.

00:20:31.230 --> 00:20:35.120
But we just launched this
wonderful digital storytelling

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.690
website last week.

00:20:37.690 --> 00:20:44.320
It's a place where anyone
can write, create, and edit

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.070
their own digital story and
submit it to our collection

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.370
to be publicly accessible.

00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:55.900
We started out with
just a few stories.

00:20:55.900 --> 00:21:00.340
We were especially interested
in documenting and preserving

00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:04.840
the histories of the elder
Southeast Asian refugees

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:06.100
in the Twin Cities.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:12.250
We now have 215 stories
representing over 50 groups.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.950
And there is one story
from the community

00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:22.460
that I especially feel connected
to, and that is [INAUDIBLE].

00:21:22.460 --> 00:21:26.810
She is a Mong refugee whose
family were closely allied

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:29.870
with American soldiers in Laos.

00:21:29.870 --> 00:21:31.700
In fact, her family
not only fought

00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:35.150
on behalf of the United States
during the so-called Secret

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:39.860
War, during the wars
in Southeast Asia,

00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:43.790
but also, her family,
on numerous occasions,

00:21:43.790 --> 00:21:47.630
helped to rescue
downed American pilots

00:21:47.630 --> 00:21:52.280
after they had crashed in the
area where they were living.

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:55.340
Because of that alliance
with the United States,

00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.590
after the Lao government
fell and became communists,

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:03.080
the [? Zhangs ?] were
targeted for persecution.

00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:06.290
And so they had to
flee their homeland.

00:22:06.290 --> 00:22:09.980
And she spent the next 20
years in a refugee camp waiting

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:12.720
to come to the United States.

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.570
She's older now.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:19.880
She has not told
her story that much.

00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:25.730
But when we talked to her, she
felt extremely enthusiastic

00:22:25.730 --> 00:22:29.750
that someone was willing
to ask and that we

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.600
were going to preserve
that story-- not

00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.640
only for her children
and grandchildren,

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.530
but also for the greater public.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:39.530
So you can see she came
to our interview session

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:44.330
with photographs and the
[INAUDIBLE] that she had sewn.

00:22:44.330 --> 00:22:46.580
But the thing that really
struck me about her story

00:22:46.580 --> 00:22:51.620
was how important and timely
it was to preserve them.

00:22:51.620 --> 00:22:54.620
She said, I'm over 60 now.

00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:59.380
If I don't share this
with you, it will die,

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:02.190
and no one will know.

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:05.430
So these are the
stories that are

00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:08.610
going to continue to help
us understand, again,

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.650
America's relationship
to immigration

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:15.000
and the ways in which we
have fulfilled our promise

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.120
as a nation of immigrants.

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:22.860
Another part of that story
is the 1965 Immigration Act,

00:23:22.860 --> 00:23:28.140
passed almost exactly 50
years ago last October.

00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.810
This law ushered in
the greatest numbers

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:36.450
of new Asian immigrants,
14.7 million since 1965.

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:40.860
This act, signed by President
Johnson on Liberty Island

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.110
with the Statue of
Liberty behind him,

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:45.240
was a hallmark of the
Civil Rights Movement

00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:49.830
as well as a strong diplomatic
statement during the Cold War.

00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:55.350
We were just ending a period of
great immigration restriction.

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:58.080
We had discriminatory
immigration quotas.

00:23:58.080 --> 00:23:59.910
And during the Cold
War, as we were

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:03.360
trying to spread this message
that American democracy,

00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.430
freedom, and capitalism is
superior than Soviet communism,

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:12.630
that discrimination in
our immigration laws

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.880
was a constant sign
of our hypocrisy.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.810
And it was used against
us in many ways.

00:24:18.810 --> 00:24:24.030
So Johnson signed
this law not only as

00:24:24.030 --> 00:24:25.930
a measure of
international diplomacy,

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:29.280
but also to respond to the
American Civil Rights Movement

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.770
that was happening within
our borders as well.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:38.240
What has happened
since '65 is that now,

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:41.390
our system of immigration is
based on family reunification

00:24:41.390 --> 00:24:43.550
and on professional skills.

00:24:43.550 --> 00:24:47.420
This is still the system
that remains in place.

00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:51.650
For Asian-Americans, this has
meant a major transformation

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:57.020
in American society with record
levels of new immigration.

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:01.530
One of the most important
shifts is, as you can see,

00:25:01.530 --> 00:25:03.890
a historic shift away from
immigration from Europe

00:25:03.890 --> 00:25:07.970
to immigration from
Latin America and Asia.

00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:11.300
The post-1965 pathways
to the United States

00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.410
have been especially important
to perspective Asian immigrants

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:17.810
from places like
Taiwan, India, Korea,

00:25:17.810 --> 00:25:20.330
and more recently,
China, places that

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:24.140
have increased
educational attainment

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:28.850
but whose economies have not
kept up with the new educated

00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:30.530
population.

00:25:30.530 --> 00:25:33.600
Seeking better
economic opportunities,

00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.400
many of these high-skilled and
highly-educated professionals

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.220
have come to the United States.

00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.580
In fact, it can be argued that
no other group has benefited

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:47.030
more from these recent
changes in immigration laws

00:25:47.030 --> 00:25:52.140
than Asian immigrants
and Asian-Americans.

00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:56.580
In 1960, the total
Asian-American population

00:25:56.580 --> 00:26:00.900
was just under 1 million
people, or about 1%

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:04.230
of the total US population.

00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:06.390
Since then, Asian immigration
to the United States

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:09.190
has grown exponentially.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:11.530
And it is increasingly diverse.

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:15.910
The 21 million Asian-Americans
now in the United States

00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:20.770
make up over 6.5% of
the total US population.

00:26:20.770 --> 00:26:25.270
Between 2000 and 2010, the
Asian-American population

00:26:25.270 --> 00:26:28.480
increased by a
staggering 46%, making

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.920
them the fastest-growing
group in the country.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:35.500
And they're part of America's
larger transformation

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.340
from into a majority
minority country,

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.670
estimated to be around
2044 with an increase

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:47.860
of 130% in the coming decades.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.170
Asian immigrants
receive about 3/4

00:26:50.170 --> 00:26:54.130
of the H-1B visas granted to
highly skilled guest workers,

00:26:54.130 --> 00:26:56.200
including Indians.

00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:58.180
Like what I'm doing here?

00:26:58.180 --> 00:27:02.110
Sundar Pichai now leads some of
the biggest high-tech companies

00:27:02.110 --> 00:27:04.210
in the country, like Google.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:06.400
And Chinese are now the
single largest group

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:09.520
of international students
coming into the country.

00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:14.740
So the face of new immigration
to the United States is Asian.

00:27:14.740 --> 00:27:17.170
And many of these new
immigrants' experiences

00:27:17.170 --> 00:27:21.700
reflect the US's welcome
and its enduring history

00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:25.000
of a nation as immigrants.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.310
Recent reports predict
that Asian immigrants

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:29.830
will be the largest
immigrant group in the US,

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:33.030
surpassing Hispanics.

00:27:33.030 --> 00:27:35.370
They're settling in places
that have traditionally

00:27:35.370 --> 00:27:40.590
welcomed immigrants, like New
York and San Francisco and LA.

00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:44.040
But they're also in places where
such new immigration is new--

00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:48.540
Las Vegas, Charleston,
Houston, Phoenix,

00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.940
and Minneanapolis St. Paul.

00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:53.040
Along with Latinos,
Asian-Americans

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.790
are transforming
the United States.

00:27:56.790 --> 00:27:59.550
So that's the nation
of immigrants story.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:03.810
It runs through the
history of Asian-Americans.

00:28:03.810 --> 00:28:05.940
They intersect with each other.

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:09.210
It remains true today.

00:28:09.210 --> 00:28:14.280
But the other side is also
part of the story as well.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.240
As today's headlines bring news
of deportation raids, President

00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.290
Trump's executive orders, a
halt to the refugee resettlement

00:28:22.290 --> 00:28:26.880
program, and the travel ban
on non-citizens from now

00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:30.150
six majority-Muslim
countries, we

00:28:30.150 --> 00:28:32.850
know that Asian-Americans
have been part of this story

00:28:32.850 --> 00:28:34.860
as well.

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:38.190
Before the US tried to institute
a travel ban on Muslims,

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:39.420
we banned Asians.

00:28:39.420 --> 00:28:42.150
Before we focused on the
so-called Mexican illegal

00:28:42.150 --> 00:28:45.450
immigration problem,
we patrolled the border

00:28:45.450 --> 00:28:48.840
and raided cities in the
search for undocumented Chinese

00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:49.800
immigrants.

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.250
The first border patrol agents
along the US-Mexico border

00:28:53.250 --> 00:28:58.860
in the early 1900s called
themselves Chinese catchers.

00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:01.920
In fact, Asian immigrants
were amongst the most reviled,

00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:05.640
feared, and hated in US history.

00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:11.820
This is an early 20th-century
advertisement for soap.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:18.630
This is how widespread the image
of the despised Chinese laborer

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:26.550
was, that it would be put
on a package for soap.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:29.740
Asians were valued as laborers.

00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.460
But soon after their arrival
in the United States,

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.235
they became targets of massive
anti-immigrant sentiment,

00:29:35.235 --> 00:29:39.270
a xenophobia that was
inextricably connected

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:43.110
to the already
racial discrimination

00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:47.010
that African-Americans, American
Indians, and Mexicans faced

00:29:47.010 --> 00:29:48.270
in the United States.

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:51.750
They were treated as peoples
unfit for US citizenship

00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:55.380
and as outsiders to
American society.

00:29:55.380 --> 00:29:58.680
They were barred from
becoming naturalized citizens,

00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:01.680
prohibited from owning
or leasing land,

00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:04.530
and marrying whites
in some states.

00:30:04.530 --> 00:30:07.560
They were harassed,
driven out and segregated

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.270
from the rest of America.

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:12.900
This is a cartoon
that was published

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:17.070
in 1881 in a San Francisco
illustrated magazine called

00:30:17.070 --> 00:30:18.570
"The Wasp."

00:30:18.570 --> 00:30:21.600
And for many, many
decades, San Franciscans

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:25.740
had been trying to convince
their fellow citizens

00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:29.580
on the East Coast that Chinese
immigration was a huge problem,

00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:33.870
and that if we did not act,
the country would be invaded,

00:30:33.870 --> 00:30:36.870
overrun by the teeming
millions of Chinese,

00:30:36.870 --> 00:30:42.690
this despised, undesirable
immigrant population.

00:30:42.690 --> 00:30:46.710
And in this cartoon, you can see
that what the Californians are

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:50.700
trying to say is you
on the East Coast,

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:53.370
you have the Statue of
Liberty, the one that

00:30:53.370 --> 00:30:56.670
is welcoming the right kind
of immigrants from Europe.

00:30:56.670 --> 00:30:59.610
On the West Coast,
we have this statue,

00:30:59.610 --> 00:31:01.800
this statue for our harbor.

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:06.070
And instead of a woman
representing equality, freedom,

00:31:06.070 --> 00:31:10.530
and democracy, we have
this Chinese coolie labor.

00:31:10.530 --> 00:31:17.100
He is wearing bedraggled Robes
he's got a rat-tail-like queue.

00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:20.040
He's an unassimilable foreigner.

00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:25.920
And he's bringing, as
the rays of light show

00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:27.510
emanating from his head--

00:31:27.510 --> 00:31:31.590
he's bringing filth and
immorality, disease,

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:34.590
and ruin to white labor.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:38.640
He's also holding an opium
pipe in his left hand,

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.390
and he's resting
on a human skull.

00:31:42.390 --> 00:31:47.010
So Chinese immigration
represents the destruction

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:49.500
not only of everything
that we hold dear,

00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:54.960
but American
civilization itself.

00:31:54.960 --> 00:32:00.000
By the 1880s, the debate
over Chinese immigration

00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:02.400
had become nationwide.

00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.190
On February 28th,
1882, as Congress

00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:08.940
is debating this ban
on Chinese laborers,

00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:10.890
Senator John Miller
of California

00:32:10.890 --> 00:32:13.560
introduced in the
United States this bill

00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:16.470
to exclude Chinese
immigrant laborers.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:20.010
The California Republican
spelled out the imminent danger

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:22.620
that Chinese immigration
posed, including

00:32:22.620 --> 00:32:24.210
the fact that
according to Miller,

00:32:24.210 --> 00:32:28.620
Chinese immigrants were, quote,
a degraded and inferior race.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:30.900
Chinese immigrants
competed with white workers

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:35.130
with their, quote, machine-like
ways and their muscles of iron.

00:32:35.130 --> 00:32:37.770
Miller proclaimed that a
vote for Chinese Exclusion

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:42.150
was a vote for both white
labor and for the public good

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:42.960
of the country.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.680
Public good.

00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:46.410
I want you to keep that in mind.

00:32:46.410 --> 00:32:51.060
The Chinese Exclusion Act became
law on May 6th, 1882, and marks

00:32:51.060 --> 00:32:52.830
the first time
that we've singled

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:56.635
out a group for exclusion
based on race and class.

00:32:59.170 --> 00:33:01.720
Part of the story of
Chinese immigration

00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:03.820
during the exclusion
era takes place

00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:06.700
at the Angel Island
Immigration Station

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:09.190
right in San Francisco Bay.

00:33:09.190 --> 00:33:12.580
Open from 1910 to
1940, it processed over

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:17.440
1 million immigrants from
over 80 different Countries

00:33:17.440 --> 00:33:21.580
on their way into and
out of the United States.

00:33:21.580 --> 00:33:25.120
It's especially important
for Chinese immigrants who

00:33:25.120 --> 00:33:28.000
are coming, because
this is a place that

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.700
was designed to
enforce the Chinese,

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:34.090
and then later, other
Asian exclusion laws.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:39.070
So instead of being processed
through Ellis Island,

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:41.887
like so many European
immigrants were,

00:33:41.887 --> 00:33:43.720
the immigrants who came
through Angel Island

00:33:43.720 --> 00:33:49.450
countered their detention time
in weeks rather than hours.

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:53.110
They experienced the invasive
medical examinations,

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:58.030
the grueling interrogations,
and they also

00:33:58.030 --> 00:34:02.200
were detained in immigrant
barracks that were overcrowded,

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:09.420
unsanitary, and were more like
prisons than anything else.

00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.420
The policies that were put
in place of Angel Island laid

00:34:12.420 --> 00:34:16.080
the foundation for how we
would process immigrants--

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.780
not just Chinese,
but all immigrants--

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:21.870
through the 20th century.

00:34:21.870 --> 00:34:24.210
Once admitted into the
United States, for example,

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:26.280
Chinese immigrants
were still suspect

00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.080
and were placed
under surveillance

00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:29.730
wherever they went.

00:34:29.730 --> 00:34:37.290
This is a page from a California
immigration official's journal.

00:34:37.290 --> 00:34:39.750
He's based in
Downieville, California.

00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:42.659
And he's keeping track of
every Chinese immigrant who

00:34:42.659 --> 00:34:44.730
is within his town.

00:34:44.730 --> 00:34:47.889
As you can see, he's got
their photographs, their age,

00:34:47.889 --> 00:34:51.540
their name, any physical
marks, and whether they're

00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:53.699
in the country or
if they've left.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:35:00.830
Chinese immigrants
were also required

00:35:00.830 --> 00:35:03.410
to mandatory registration
with the government.

00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:05.900
This is one of the
certificates of identity

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:08.690
that my grandfather had
to apply for as well.

00:35:08.690 --> 00:35:11.600
And it wasn't just
Chinese immigrants.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.230
It was also required
of Chinese Americans

00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:17.930
born in the United States.

00:35:17.930 --> 00:35:21.320
This is racial profiling.

00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:23.810
This is the
certificate of identity

00:35:23.810 --> 00:35:29.480
for a very well-known actress
in the early 20th century, Anna

00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:30.650
May Wong.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:33.470
Some of you may know that name.

00:35:33.470 --> 00:35:39.560
She is really the only
Asian-American actor or actress

00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:41.780
who was a Hollywood star.

00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:46.460
Now, she was only
allowed to play roles

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:50.510
like Fu-Manchu's daughter,
the evil oriental overlord's

00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:53.390
suffering daughter.

00:35:53.390 --> 00:35:57.170
But she was a
well-known presence.

00:35:57.170 --> 00:36:05.070
But even she, whose face was
so commonly known, so famous

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:08.580
around the world, had to carry
one of these certificates

00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:11.580
of identity as well.

00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.890
The Chinese Exclusion
Act was just

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:16.890
the beginning of a
decades-long movement

00:36:16.890 --> 00:36:19.470
to exclude all Asian immigrants.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:22.410
Given President Trump's
recent executive order,

00:36:22.410 --> 00:36:26.580
the 1917 Immigration Act
is especially noteworthy.

00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:28.890
The act involved
several provisions,

00:36:28.890 --> 00:36:33.060
including a literacy test for
all prospective immigrants.

00:36:33.060 --> 00:36:35.490
But the act also
identified a region

00:36:35.490 --> 00:36:38.970
that Congress called the
Asiatic Barred Zone, from which

00:36:38.970 --> 00:36:41.800
all immigrants were prohibited.

00:36:41.800 --> 00:36:44.340
So what this meant
was that immigrants

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.890
from almost the
entire Asian continent

00:36:46.890 --> 00:36:50.890
were prohibited from
entering the United States.

00:36:50.890 --> 00:36:53.590
In addition to
China, Japan, Korea,

00:36:53.590 --> 00:36:57.250
the zone included
India, Siam, Indochina,

00:36:57.250 --> 00:36:59.710
parts of Siberia,
Afghanistan, and Arabia,

00:36:59.710 --> 00:37:03.220
the islands of Java, Sumatra,
Ceylon, Borneo, New Guinea,

00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:06.900
[INAUDIBLE], and
various lesser groups

00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:11.730
with a total population
band of over 500 million.

00:37:11.730 --> 00:37:18.030
The law was in
effect until 1952.

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:24.780
The 1917 act was built on a
series of Asian exclusion laws.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:32.140
As you can see, we're barring
an expanding number of groups,

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:37.090
not only of general
immigration laws barring groups

00:37:37.090 --> 00:37:39.220
like idiots and
lunatics and poppers,

00:37:39.220 --> 00:37:43.870
but also every single
Asian immigrant group,

00:37:43.870 --> 00:37:46.930
until we get to the
1924 Immigration Act,

00:37:46.930 --> 00:37:51.700
when, in addition to the
restrictions and bans placed

00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:57.350
on Asians by the 1917 act,
we ban all Asians completely.

00:37:57.350 --> 00:38:01.700
This is followed by restrictions
on Southern and Eastern

00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.630
European immigration as
well as mass deportations

00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:07.790
of Mexican immigrants
and Mexican-Americans

00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:11.000
during the 1930s.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:14.450
Anti-Asian sentiment
peaks during World War II

00:38:14.450 --> 00:38:18.020
with many Americans, led by
politicians and the media,

00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:20.840
believing that
Japanese-Americans represented

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:24.170
a national security
threat, that they could not

00:38:24.170 --> 00:38:27.050
be trusted, that despite
outward appearances

00:38:27.050 --> 00:38:29.510
and claims of loyalty
to the United States,

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:33.770
they were, in fact, working
for the Japanese Empire.

00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:40.710
Does anyone recognize the
artist behind this cartoon?

00:38:40.710 --> 00:38:45.720
Dr. Seuss was very prolific
during the early 20th century.

00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:51.390
He created a lot of cartoons
during World War II,

00:38:51.390 --> 00:38:55.920
many of which had an
anti-Japanese bent.

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:59.520
And in this one, called "Waiting
for the Signal from Home,"

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:03.540
you can see masses of
Japanese-Americans, all up

00:39:03.540 --> 00:39:06.780
and down the West
Coast, who are,

00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:10.950
on outside appearances,
perfectly assimilated.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:13.500
They're wearing Western suits.

00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:15.390
But they also all look the same.

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:17.910
You can't distinguish
one from the other.

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:23.490
And it's clear that once
that signal comes from home,

00:39:23.490 --> 00:39:26.670
they will be called
to action and called

00:39:26.670 --> 00:39:33.160
to destroy the United States
with dynamite from within.

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:36.820
These are common perceptions
of Japanese-Americans

00:39:36.820 --> 00:39:39.520
during the war.

00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.960
And on February 19th, 1942,
almost exactly 75 years ago,

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.910
President Franklin Roosevelt
signed an executive order

00:39:48.910 --> 00:39:51.310
requiring the mass
removal of all persons

00:39:51.310 --> 00:39:54.580
of Japanese ancestry
from the West Coast.

00:39:54.580 --> 00:39:59.050
This executive order, which
was not put before Congress,

00:39:59.050 --> 00:40:02.080
directed the Secretary of War
and other military commanders

00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.840
to identify certain
military areas,

00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.930
certain sensitive
military zones,

00:40:07.930 --> 00:40:14.230
and gave them the power to
expel anyone from those areas.

00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:16.600
Placing the responsibility
with the military,

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.970
this executive order--

00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:23.650
Executive Order 9066-- used the
premise of military necessity

00:40:23.650 --> 00:40:26.710
or national security that
allowed the government

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:29.350
to round up and expel
entire communities

00:40:29.350 --> 00:40:32.560
without compensation
and without due process

00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:35.580
or proof of wrongdoing.

00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.580
Japanese-Americans were
never listed by name

00:40:38.580 --> 00:40:41.160
in Executive Order 9066.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:45.840
But discriminatory intent was
clear from previous government

00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:48.840
actions and statements
by officials.

00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:50.790
If you're following
any of the news

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:55.140
around the legal challenges
to the executive orders,

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:59.340
this language of
discriminatory intent

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:03.950
is one of the foundations that
the cases are resting upon--

00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:08.610
that the travel ban
is a Muslim ban based

00:41:08.610 --> 00:41:14.400
on discriminatory intent,
based on previous statements

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.950
by President Trump
and other officials.

00:41:19.870 --> 00:41:21.760
So they're not listed
in the executive order,

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.670
but we know from officials
that Japanese-Americans

00:41:24.670 --> 00:41:25.930
were the targets.

00:41:25.930 --> 00:41:28.390
For example, Lieutenant
General John Dewitt,

00:41:28.390 --> 00:41:31.510
head of the newly created
Western Defense Command,

00:41:31.510 --> 00:41:34.870
is in charge of defending
the entire West Coast.

00:41:34.870 --> 00:41:37.660
He consistently
and publicly stated

00:41:37.660 --> 00:41:41.470
that, quote, the Japanese
race was an enemy race.

00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:44.320
I have no confidence in
their loyalty whatsoever,

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:46.900
he wrote in January of 1942.

00:41:46.900 --> 00:41:50.590
Racial affinities are
not severed by migration.

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:53.500
It makes no difference whether
he is an American citizen.

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:56.430
He is still Japanese.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:59.940
Thus, in his reckoning,
American born Japanese

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.330
remained, quote, potential
enemies at large.

00:42:03.330 --> 00:42:08.080
Or, in other words,
a Jap is a Jap.

00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.250
Within weeks of Executive
Order 9066 being signed,

00:42:11.250 --> 00:42:13.570
the US government began
what it euphemistically

00:42:13.570 --> 00:42:16.780
called evacuation.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.930
On March 1st, 1942,
General Dewitt

00:42:19.930 --> 00:42:22.180
issued the first
public proclamation

00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:26.320
officially notifying all
persons of Japanese ancestry

00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:31.240
that they were to be removed
and evacuated from, or excluded,

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:34.520
from the Western parts of
Washington state, California,

00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:36.850
Oregon, and parts of Arizona.

00:42:36.850 --> 00:42:39.400
A curfew was also put
into place requiring

00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:42.850
all persons of Japanese
ancestry to remain at home

00:42:42.850 --> 00:42:48.220
from the hours of
8:00 PM to 6:00 AM.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:50.500
Once an exclusion
order was issued,

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.660
residents were generally
given just one week

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:56.850
to prepare themselves
for removal.

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:59.310
They were allowed to
bring with them only what

00:42:59.310 --> 00:43:01.670
they could carry.

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:06.800
Families were rushed to sell
stores, cars, farm equipment,

00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.580
farms, furniture,
clothes, valuables,

00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:14.350
often at huge losses.

00:43:14.350 --> 00:43:17.030
On the designated
evacuation days,

00:43:17.030 --> 00:43:20.300
all persons of Japanese
ancestry within specific zones

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:24.620
were ordered to assemble
at central locations

00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:28.330
where they were met
by armed US soldiers.

00:43:28.330 --> 00:43:33.880
You guys know the Tanforan
Mall in San Bruno, right?

00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:37.420
Do you know that it used to be
the Tanforan Racetrack or horse

00:43:37.420 --> 00:43:38.470
track?

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:42.430
And the Tanforan horse track
was the gathering point,

00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:46.780
the evacuation center
for Japanese-Americans

00:43:46.780 --> 00:43:47.590
in the Bay Area.

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:55.720
Each individual wore
a US government-issued

00:43:55.720 --> 00:43:58.900
identification tag.

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.970
They were given these tags.

00:44:00.970 --> 00:44:03.550
They were sent with
all of their belongings

00:44:03.550 --> 00:44:08.410
to places like the
Tanforan Racetrack, which

00:44:08.410 --> 00:44:14.230
had only recently been cleared
of its former inmates, i.e.

00:44:14.230 --> 00:44:14.920
horses.

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:19.570
So Japanese-Americans were
placed in the horse stalls that

00:44:19.570 --> 00:44:24.580
had still the remnants
of what horses

00:44:24.580 --> 00:44:25.730
do in their horse stalls.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:29.480
It was extremely humiliating.

00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.710
Once assembled,
Japanese-American evacuees

00:44:31.710 --> 00:44:34.860
were transported to 16
hastily-erected assembly

00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:38.890
centers in California, Oregon,
Washington, and Arizona.

00:44:38.890 --> 00:44:42.180
These new homes were hastily
refurbished fairgrounds

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:44.790
or racetracks where
the inmates were kept

00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:46.620
in former stalls and barracks.

00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:52.200
Barbed wire fences, and guard
towers surrounded the centers.

00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:55.950
120,000 individuals-- 2/3--

00:44:55.950 --> 00:45:01.790
2/3 of them American citizens,
children, school-age children--

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:04.190
were forced to leave school,
abandon their businesses

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:07.490
and homes, and were uprooted
from their communities.

00:45:07.490 --> 00:45:10.940
There were no individual
hearings or trials.

00:45:10.940 --> 00:45:14.520
They were vilified as a group.

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:19.200
They were relocated to camps
unfit for human habitation

00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:24.000
and incarcerated for
the duration of the war.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:30.090
Not one Japanese-American
was ever charged or convicted

00:45:30.090 --> 00:45:30.940
of espionage.

00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:36.420
It would take
decades of activism,

00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.750
investigative
research, and lobbying.

00:45:39.750 --> 00:45:43.020
But in 1976, President
Gerald Ford officially

00:45:43.020 --> 00:45:45.540
declared the wartime
removal and relocation

00:45:45.540 --> 00:45:48.480
of Japanese Americans a tragedy.

00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.580
In 1982, the Commission
of Wartime Incarceration

00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:56.370
issued a final report
and a scathing rebut

00:45:56.370 --> 00:45:59.040
of the government's actions.

00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.520
Executive Order 9066,
it wrote, was not

00:46:02.520 --> 00:46:05.160
justified by military necessity.

00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:09.810
Instead, race
prejudice, war hysteria,

00:46:09.810 --> 00:46:12.360
and a failure of
political leadership

00:46:12.360 --> 00:46:15.030
led to an egregious policy.

00:46:15.030 --> 00:46:19.740
A grave injustice was done to
American citizens and resident

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:24.900
nationals of Japanese ancestry,
the commission concluded.

00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:29.430
In 1988, the Civil Liberties
Act was approved by Congress

00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:32.550
and signed into law
by President Reagan.

00:46:32.550 --> 00:46:35.050
The act authorized,
among other things,

00:46:35.050 --> 00:46:42.320
a formal US apology for
removal and incarceration.

00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.040
We could end on that note--

00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:50.220
a recognition of a historical
injustice and reparations

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:57.600
and a coming to our senses about
what we've done in the past

00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.540
and how we should never
repeat that again.

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:08.400
But unfortunately, 13 years
after that law was signed,

00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:11.070
the tragic attacks on
the World Trade Center

00:47:11.070 --> 00:47:15.030
and the Pentagon on
September 11th, 2001,

00:47:15.030 --> 00:47:19.050
and the United States'
ongoing global war on terror,

00:47:19.050 --> 00:47:22.320
ushered a new wave of
xenophobia and prejudice

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.770
reminiscent of the
post-Pearl Harbor treatment

00:47:25.770 --> 00:47:28.940
of Japanese-Americans.

00:47:28.940 --> 00:47:32.010
In the search for perpetrators,
entire Middle Eastern,

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:35.040
South Asian, and Muslim
immigrant communities

00:47:35.040 --> 00:47:39.100
were made vulnerable to blanket
racially motivated charges

00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:41.550
that they were
either terrorists,

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:45.810
potential terrorists, or
terrorist sympathizers.

00:47:45.810 --> 00:47:48.810
Racial profiling, heightened
government scrutiny,

00:47:48.810 --> 00:47:54.920
deportation, and hate crimes
all increased dramatically.

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.650
Within days of the attacks,
law enforcement officials

00:47:57.650 --> 00:48:00.500
had arrested more
than 1,200 people,

00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:02.510
only a handful of
whom were proven

00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:05.900
to have any links to terrorism.

00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:07.460
Reflecting the
United States' belief

00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:10.760
that Pakistan, for example,
was a national security

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.660
risk, as a terrorist
feeder state, almost 40%

00:48:14.660 --> 00:48:17.360
of the detainees
arrested were believed

00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:19.760
to be Pakistani nationals.

00:48:19.760 --> 00:48:22.940
Like Japanese immigrants
taken into custody

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.710
after the attack
of Pearl Harbor,

00:48:24.710 --> 00:48:27.800
Muslim men began to
disappear from their families

00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:30.360
and communities.

00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.280
Mandatory registration
with the government

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:36.720
was put into effect for all
non-citizen men, 16 years

00:48:36.720 --> 00:48:42.030
or older, from 25 predominantly
Muslim countries and North

00:48:42.030 --> 00:48:42.990
Korea.

00:48:42.990 --> 00:48:48.180
So when you hear this
talk of no Muslim ban,

00:48:48.180 --> 00:48:50.720
you should be aware
that we've been-- sorry,

00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.730
no Muslim registry-- you should
be aware that we have been

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:58.230
registering Muslims since 2001.

00:48:58.230 --> 00:49:01.740
This system, known as the
National Security Entry Exit

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.590
Registration System,
was only just ended

00:49:04.590 --> 00:49:08.130
before President
Obama left office.

00:49:08.130 --> 00:49:11.000
Over 85,000 people registered.

00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:15.030
14,000 were found to be
out of immigration status

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:17.820
and were placed into
deportation proceedings.

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:25.760
Zero were found to be convicted
of terror-related activities.

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.610
Still, many Arab-American,
Muslim, and South

00:49:28.610 --> 00:49:31.010
Asian-American
communities continue

00:49:31.010 --> 00:49:35.780
to be treated as if they were
already guilty or disloyal

00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.550
to the United States.

00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:41.390
In the weeks and months
following the terrorist attacks

00:49:41.390 --> 00:49:45.560
on 9/11, hate crimes directed
at all of these groups increased

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:49.790
by 1,600%.

00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:52.940
And the trend has
continued in recent years.

00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:59.020
In just the past three weeks,
three Indian immigrants

00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:01.960
have been shot, two of
them fatally, in incidents

00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:06.190
that investigators are
considering as hate crimes.

00:50:06.190 --> 00:50:09.400
Computer software engineer
Srinivas Kuchibhotla

00:50:09.400 --> 00:50:13.000
was fatally shot in
Kansas on February 20th.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.950
Store owner Harnisch Patel
was killed in South Carolina.

00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:21.700
Deep Rai was shot in front of
his house outside of Seattle

00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:24.820
after an attacker shouted
go back to your country.

00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:30.450
During the divisive 2016
presidential election,

00:50:30.450 --> 00:50:34.950
anti-Muslim assaults rose
to their highest levels

00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:37.640
since 2001.

00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:39.830
And we know that so
many of the candidates

00:50:39.830 --> 00:50:42.830
called for either a
total ban on Muslims

00:50:42.830 --> 00:50:48.800
or for surveillance
of Muslim communities.

00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:53.630
The FBI has reported 257
incidents of anti-Muslim hate

00:50:53.630 --> 00:51:00.380
crimes in 2015, a 67% increase
from the previous year.

00:51:00.380 --> 00:51:03.380
The Southern Poverty Law
Center reported more than 30

00:51:03.380 --> 00:51:07.160
in the first five days after
the presidential election.

00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:13.420
Today, we're in the
midst of a brand

00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:16.120
new debate over immigration.

00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:18.340
During his first
two weeks in office,

00:51:18.340 --> 00:51:21.670
President Trump signed
three executive orders.

00:51:21.670 --> 00:51:24.140
I know you know about them.

00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:26.740
First were two orders on
immigration and border

00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:30.910
security, which included
actions on his campaign

00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:35.410
promises to build that wall
and to step up deportations

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:37.994
and immigration enforcement.

00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:45.280
The Border and
Enhancing Public Safety

00:51:45.280 --> 00:51:47.920
in the Interior
executive order also

00:51:47.920 --> 00:51:52.450
calls for the additional hiring
of 10,000 immigration officers,

00:51:52.450 --> 00:51:55.300
increased immigrant
detention, increased removal

00:51:55.300 --> 00:51:59.740
of undocumented immigrants,
stripping federal funding

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:03.880
to so-called sanctuary
cities, levying sanctions

00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.030
against recalcitrant
countries who will not

00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:10.060
cooperate with the United
States' immigration deportation

00:52:10.060 --> 00:52:14.380
orders, and publicizing
crimes committed

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:17.560
by undocumented immigrants.

00:52:17.560 --> 00:52:21.370
On January 27th, President
Trump signed an executive order

00:52:21.370 --> 00:52:24.400
that indefinitely
suspended the resettlement

00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:28.510
of Syrian refugees, paused the
overall refugee resettlement

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:31.780
program, temporarily
banned non-citizens

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:35.310
from seven majority
Muslim nations.

00:52:35.310 --> 00:52:38.520
This law, as we all
know, was the subject

00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:42.990
of massive national
protests at airports

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:46.080
as well as numerous
legal challenges.

00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:48.390
It was temporarily blocked.

00:52:48.390 --> 00:52:51.570
The president signed, last
week, a new order that

00:52:51.570 --> 00:52:54.090
supersedes the original one.

00:52:54.090 --> 00:52:58.260
It no longer bans
immigrants from Iraq.

00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:00.330
And the Syrian Refugee
Resettlement Program

00:53:00.330 --> 00:53:04.920
is not singled out for
indefinite detention.

00:53:04.920 --> 00:53:07.470
Green card holders
are also exempt.

00:53:07.470 --> 00:53:13.970
But all of the other aspects
of that ban are still in place.

00:53:13.970 --> 00:53:17.780
So what does this mean
for Asian-Americans?

00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.180
For many of us, these
actions remind us

00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:23.000
of older policies and
government actions that

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.910
separated our families,
devastated our communities,

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:28.820
and disregarded
the Constitution.

00:53:28.820 --> 00:53:31.940
The Chinese Exclusion Act
and Executive Order 9066

00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:37.650
were presented as measures for
the public good and military

00:53:37.650 --> 00:53:40.230
necessity, when
really, such laws were

00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:43.280
a cloak for discrimination.

00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:47.180
For me personally, it
frustrates me and angers me

00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:50.630
to no end to realize
that we are repeating

00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:52.430
these mistakes of the past--

00:53:52.430 --> 00:53:56.450
mistakes that so many
of our former leaders

00:53:56.450 --> 00:54:03.290
came to apologize for or came
to regard as historic mistakes

00:54:03.290 --> 00:54:06.440
that should not be repeated.

00:54:06.440 --> 00:54:08.630
But what is happening
today is not

00:54:08.630 --> 00:54:11.210
just about what happened
to us in the past.

00:54:11.210 --> 00:54:15.380
It's imperative to remember that
these actions directly impact

00:54:15.380 --> 00:54:18.770
Asian-Americans today as well.

00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:20.900
Asians are the
fastest-growing group

00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.180
of undocumented immigrants.

00:54:23.180 --> 00:54:25.250
Since 1990, for
example, the number

00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:30.440
of undocumented immigrants
from India grew by 300%,

00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:37.160
from South Korea by
250%, from China by 150%.

00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:41.720
In California alone, 16% of
all undocumented immigrants

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:44.360
are Asian-American.

00:54:44.360 --> 00:54:48.350
So the time to act is now.

00:54:48.350 --> 00:54:51.860
When we're thinking about
our long history of not only

00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:55.910
what was done to us, but
also what we did in response,

00:54:55.910 --> 00:55:00.550
we should remember this
man, Fred Korematsu.

00:55:00.550 --> 00:55:04.000
He refused to comply
with executive Order 9066

00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:07.420
in San Leandro, which is
where his family was living

00:55:07.420 --> 00:55:09.820
and ran a nursery.

00:55:09.820 --> 00:55:11.770
When his family went
to the assembly center,

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:13.720
he stayed behind.

00:55:13.720 --> 00:55:17.830
He was hiding out in San
Leandro until May of 1942,

00:55:17.830 --> 00:55:22.510
and officials arrested him
and sent him to prison.

00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:26.050
The ACLU came to his defense.

00:55:26.050 --> 00:55:28.630
Ernest Bessig, a
lawyer for the ACLU,

00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:31.090
approached Korematsu
and asked him

00:55:31.090 --> 00:55:33.580
whether he'd be willing
to put his case forward

00:55:33.580 --> 00:55:37.660
as a test case to consider
whether the executive order was

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:39.460
constitutional or not.

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:41.140
Korematsu agreed.

00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:44.980
As he explained later,
I didn't feel guilty,

00:55:44.980 --> 00:55:46.660
because I didn't
do anything wrong.

00:55:46.660 --> 00:55:49.060
Every day in school, we
said the pledge of the flag

00:55:49.060 --> 00:55:51.190
with liberty and
justice for all,

00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:53.710
and I believed all of that.

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:57.520
I was an American citizen,
and I had as many rights

00:55:57.520 --> 00:55:58.840
as anyone else.

00:56:01.410 --> 00:56:04.580
A federal district
court did not agree.

00:56:04.580 --> 00:56:08.540
It convicted Korematsu of
defying the military orders.

00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:11.210
And in September of
1943, he was forced

00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:15.320
to move to a camp in Utah.

00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.410
From within the camp, Korematsu
continued his legal battle,

00:56:18.410 --> 00:56:21.560
and the case went all the
way to the US Supreme Court.

00:56:21.560 --> 00:56:26.160
In December of 1944, the
court issued its ruling.

00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:30.490
A majority of justices
upheld the constitutionality

00:56:30.490 --> 00:56:33.400
of incarceration of
Japanese-Americans.

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:35.470
Justice Hugo Black,
a former member

00:56:35.470 --> 00:56:40.330
of the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama,
delivered the court's opinion.

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:43.690
The high court accepted
the Army's position

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:46.990
that removal and incarceration
of Japanese-Americans

00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:50.380
was a military necessity,
and in essence,

00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:55.930
justified bowing to military
demands during a time of war.

00:56:55.930 --> 00:57:01.880
This ruling still stands
as legal precedent.

00:57:01.880 --> 00:57:05.240
After 9/11, Korematsu
was an outspoken critic

00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:07.640
of the US government's
national security measures

00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:11.180
and warned that they were
reminiscent of civil liberties

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:14.280
violations in the past.

00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:17.130
Even in times of
crisis, he wrote,

00:57:17.130 --> 00:57:19.920
we must guard against
prejudice and keep

00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:23.960
uppermost our commitment
to law and justice.

00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:28.190
For Korematsu, this was about
civil rights for all Americans

00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:30.890
and human rights for all.

00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:34.520
No one should ever
be locked away simply

00:57:34.520 --> 00:57:38.090
because they share the same
race, ethnicity, or religion

00:57:38.090 --> 00:57:40.400
as a spy or terrorist.

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.170
If that principle
was not learned

00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:44.480
from the internment
of Japanese-Americans,

00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.910
then these are
very, very dangerous

00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:49.190
times for our democracy.

00:57:52.210 --> 00:57:54.700
Today, Asian-Americans
are recognizing

00:57:54.700 --> 00:57:57.250
that they have a
special responsibility

00:57:57.250 --> 00:58:03.100
to speak out against these hate
crimes, growing xenophobia,

00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.980
and anti-Muslim rhetoric.

00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:09.850
Just a few weeks ago
on February 19th,

00:58:09.850 --> 00:58:13.640
the 75th anniversary of the
signing of Executive Order

00:58:13.640 --> 00:58:18.250
9066, dozens of Day
of Remembrance events

00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:20.980
took place across the country.

00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:22.720
In the wake of
deportation raids,

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:26.680
the travel ban, the end to the
refugee resettlement program,

00:58:26.680 --> 00:58:31.660
many were asking
could it happen again.

00:58:31.660 --> 00:58:34.590
It already is was the
answer from many corners.

00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:39.170
Some Japanese-American
organizations

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:42.770
went even further than
the traditional day

00:58:42.770 --> 00:58:45.440
of remembrance
activities and called

00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:51.196
on direct acts of solidarity
with Muslim-Americans.

00:58:51.196 --> 00:58:52.820
I attended the Day
of Remembrance event

00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:55.840
in St. Paul, Minnesota.

00:58:55.840 --> 00:59:00.070
And there, the Japanese-American
Citizens League and the Council

00:59:00.070 --> 00:59:02.530
of American-Islamic
Relations for Minnesota

00:59:02.530 --> 00:59:07.060
came together to read
a joint statement.

00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:10.770
These two communities
were important.

00:59:10.770 --> 00:59:15.510
One had suffered through
racial discrimination

00:59:15.510 --> 00:59:18.240
and incarceration
during World War II.

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:21.240
The other, whose members
include the largest

00:59:21.240 --> 00:59:24.450
Somali-American population
in the United States,

00:59:24.450 --> 00:59:29.130
are being racially profiled
and religiously profiled today.

00:59:29.130 --> 00:59:34.140
Came together and closed
the events with these words.

00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:36.540
"The legally sanctioned
discrimination

00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:38.610
targeting Americans
of Japanese descent

00:59:38.610 --> 00:59:41.160
during the World
War II era mirrors

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:43.710
the current
demonization of Muslims

00:59:43.710 --> 00:59:47.250
and the governmental
legitimization of Islamophobia

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:50.310
through executive orders
and proposed legislation

00:59:50.310 --> 00:59:52.350
targeting Muslims.

00:59:52.350 --> 00:59:55.170
While Japanese-American and
American Muslim histories

00:59:55.170 --> 00:59:57.820
and experiences
are not identical,

00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:00.630
we share in a common
and parallel struggle

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:03.930
in seeking a just
and inclusive future.

01:00:03.930 --> 01:00:08.250
We will resist, oppose,
defy, and intervene

01:00:08.250 --> 01:00:12.480
in any and all acts of
racism, xenophobia, misogyny,

01:00:12.480 --> 01:00:15.210
Islamophobia, and
oppression targeting

01:00:15.210 --> 01:00:21.510
our own or other marginalized
and oppressed communities.

01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:24.390
These words and
statements of solidarity

01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:26.670
could not be more timely.

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:29.580
They remind us that
Asian-American history

01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:33.660
offers more than just
lessons of the past.

01:00:33.660 --> 01:00:35.840
It's a call to action.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:39.830
Our history of being welcomed
into as well as rejected

01:00:39.830 --> 01:00:43.850
from the United States
requires us to stand up,

01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:49.910
to speak up, and act up today
as more immigrants are targeted

01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:51.920
once again.

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:56.030
This is the time to insist
that our history matters,

01:00:56.030 --> 01:01:00.320
and to proclaim never again.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:01.675
Thank you very much.

01:01:01.675 --> 01:01:06.040
[APPLAUSE]

01:01:06.040 --> 01:01:08.840
SPEAKER: Thank you
so much, Erika Lee,

01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:13.410
for providing historical
context, your family history,

01:01:13.410 --> 01:01:17.010
as well as calling for action
in contemporary society.

01:01:17.010 --> 01:01:19.830
AUDIENCE: But just wanted to ask
one question before we wrap up.

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:21.381
This one got a lot of votes.

01:01:21.381 --> 01:01:23.880
How can we help spread awareness
of the different challenges

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:27.120
faced by highly educated
East/South Asian communities

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.620
versus Southeast
Asian communities,

01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:31.890
Hmong Cambodian, which may face
different educational economic

01:01:31.890 --> 01:01:33.429
experiences.

01:01:33.429 --> 01:01:35.970
ERIKA LEE: So one of the things
I mentioned earlier before is

01:01:35.970 --> 01:01:38.880
how diverse the
Asian-American community is--

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:40.682
23 different groups.

01:01:40.682 --> 01:01:42.390
And of course, that
diversity is not only

01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:45.510
based on ethnicity, national
origin, immigration status,

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:48.660
generation, class,
education, as well.

01:01:48.660 --> 01:01:51.990
And I know you have a
program later this week

01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:55.740
on battling that image
of the model minority.

01:01:55.740 --> 01:01:58.170
One of the challenges
is lumping everybody

01:01:58.170 --> 01:02:00.780
into that model
minority stereotype

01:02:00.780 --> 01:02:05.220
and how that disadvantages
groups who are still struggling

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:13.110
economically and also to achieve
and have equal access to higher

01:02:13.110 --> 01:02:15.180
education.

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:18.280
I think that one of the
situations where we are today--

01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:22.320
this rise in hate crimes and
this demonization of people

01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:28.050
who either are immigrants
or look like they don't

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:30.210
belong in the United States--

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:35.250
kind of erases this
idea that class

01:02:35.250 --> 01:02:37.770
and education and
professional status

01:02:37.770 --> 01:02:43.590
can protect us from xenophobia.

01:02:43.590 --> 01:02:50.310
This murder of the computer
software engineer in Kansas

01:02:50.310 --> 01:02:52.990
is just one example.

01:02:52.990 --> 01:02:57.790
The epithets, go back
to your own country,

01:02:57.790 --> 01:03:00.120
is another example.

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:07.020
People are seeing just race
or perceived religious status.

01:03:07.020 --> 01:03:12.510
They're not looking for your
diploma or your employee ID

01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:13.950
card.

01:03:13.950 --> 01:03:15.930
This is a time--

01:03:15.930 --> 01:03:19.980
and I think we've experienced
this over the past 15,

01:03:19.980 --> 01:03:21.870
16 years or so--

01:03:21.870 --> 01:03:26.670
where many, many groups of
Asian-Americans-- again,

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:29.730
regardless of class status
or national origin--

01:03:29.730 --> 01:03:32.970
are being targeted
under xenophobia.

01:03:32.970 --> 01:03:37.920
So I think to better
understand, again,

01:03:37.920 --> 01:03:39.720
what is happening
in the wider world

01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.330
and how this really
is impacting a larger

01:03:42.330 --> 01:03:45.840
group of Asian-Americans is
one first step towards that.

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:47.630
SPEAKER: Thank you so
much for being here.

01:03:47.630 --> 01:03:50.680
[APPLAUSE]
