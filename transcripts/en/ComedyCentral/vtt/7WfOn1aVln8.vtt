I said if my kid ever told me
he wanted to be a comic,

00:00:02.101 --> 00:00:03.470 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I would go in the other room
and get a gun

00:00:03.503 --> 00:00:04.771 size:78% position:39% line:91%
and I'd walk back
in the living room

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:06.039 line:85%
and just look him in the eyes

00:00:06.072 --> 00:00:07.640 size:78% position:39% line:91%
and go be funny
and fucking end it.

00:00:07.673 --> 00:00:09.275 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Oh yeah.
[crosstalk 00:00:08]

00:00:09.308 --> 00:00:12.078 line:91%
fucking sell out. That kid
would be on top of comedy.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.652 line:91%
Joining us, he'll be headlining
Go Bananas in Cincinnati

00:00:19.685 --> 00:00:22.922 line:91%
tomorrow through
Saturday gobananascomedy.com,

00:00:22.955 --> 00:00:24.224 align:start position:0% line:85%
Sean Patton.

00:00:24.257 --> 00:00:25.892 line:91%
How are you?
Hey, welcome back to the show.

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:27.761 size:84% position:42% line:85%
Hey, yeah I think last time

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:29.429 size:81% position:41% line:91%
I was here you were both
going to Cincinnati.

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:30.630 align:start position:0% line:85%
Whoa.

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.232 size:88% position:44% line:91%
The next day
because we had a flight.

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:33.466 align:start position:0% line:85%
We were.

00:00:33.499 --> 00:00:37.203 size:88% position:44% line:91%
And we both got upgraded
and I was shocked by how,

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:39.339 size:88% position:44% line:91%
and I don't mean to put
your business out there,

00:00:39.372 --> 00:00:40.807 line:85%
how nervous of a flyer you are.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:42.075 size:84% position:42% line:85%
Yeah, [inaudible 00:00:42].

00:00:42.108 --> 00:00:43.343 align:start position:0% line:85%
I didn't know that.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:45.645 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I was surprised, surprised.
I was surprised.

00:00:45.678 --> 00:00:46.880 size:81% position:41% line:91%
So surprised.
[crosstalk 00:00:47].

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:48.081 align:start position:0% line:85%
Super surprised.

00:00:48.114 --> 00:00:49.582 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Because I'm a nervous flyer
but I hide it well.

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:50.784 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.152 size:78% position:39% line:91%
I hide it pretty well
unless it gets ...

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:53.520 size:88% position:44% line:91%
That might have been
a particularly rocky ride

00:00:53.553 --> 00:00:54.788 align:start position:0% line:85%
or something-

00:00:54.821 --> 00:00:56.723 size:84% position:42% line:91%
So if it gets rocky at all,
you get tense?

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:58.024 align:start position:0% line:85%
I feel like but you-

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:00.760 align:end size:94% position:94% line:91%
Look I hold it in pretty good
but if it starts going ...

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:04.097 line:91%
Also depending on my mood.
Sometimes I'm ready to die.

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:07.834 size:72% position:36% line:91%
If I'm having a bad day
on the land,

00:01:07.867 --> 00:01:09.369 size:75% position:38% line:91%
put me in the sky,
see what happens.

00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:12.072 size:81% position:41% line:91%
I get up there, I go today
it's gonna happen.

00:01:12.105 --> 00:01:13.807 align:start position:0% line:85%
Bring it on, air bitch.

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.042 size:81% position:41% line:91%
That was a good week then,
because you seemed

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:17.377 size:81% position:41% line:91%
pretty nervous.
I don't want to die.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.611 line:85%
I don't want to die that week.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:19.846 line:85%
Things are going well this week.

00:01:19.879 --> 00:01:21.581 line:85%
That week I was not into dying.

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:25.051 line:91%
I don't like that guy though,
who in those moments

00:01:25.084 --> 00:01:28.521 line:91%
they'll say there's ...
You're safer up here than ...

00:01:28.554 --> 00:01:30.323 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Shut the fuck [crosstalk
00:01:30].

00:01:30.356 --> 00:01:32.559 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Stop being negative
to make this a positive.

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.462 line:91%
One of them, with a bunch
of other random people on it

00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:39.065 line:91%
were driven into a fucking
building, so shit happens.

00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.101 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Yeah. Sometimes that fucking
plane does go down

00:01:41.134 --> 00:01:43.570 size:88% position:44% line:91%
and then you can't find
that guy to be like hey.

00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:47.273 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Isn't it funny what you
put on it though?

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:49.742 line:91%
Like the city also, you're like
the one that's gonna go ...

00:01:49.775 --> 00:01:51.411 align:start position:0% line:85%
Forget even terrorism.

00:01:51.444 --> 00:01:54.647 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Let's just talk the thing,
the big national story,

00:01:55.415 --> 00:01:58.351 size:88% position:44% line:91%
you're like it's never gonna
be going from Greensboro,

00:01:58.384 --> 00:01:59.586 align:start position:0% line:85%
South Carolina-

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.787 align:start position:0% line:85%
It is though.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.256 size:81% position:41% line:91%
To like ... In your mind,
it's not going to be,

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.526 align:start position:0% line:91%
but exactly.
It's Malaysian flight whatever.

00:02:06.559 --> 00:02:08.728 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Just a random flight
that you just fucking ...

00:02:08.761 --> 00:02:12.465 line:91%
That guy who's not afraid
of flying and talks about it,

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:14.934 size:78% position:39% line:91%
I hope that person
is in a plane crash

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:16.703 align:end size:69% position:69% line:91%
and everyone survives
except him.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.204 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Isn't that an Alanis
Morissette lyric?

00:02:18.237 --> 00:02:19.439 align:start position:0% line:85%
No, that's-

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:20.673 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Isn't it ironic?
Don't you think?

00:02:20.706 --> 00:02:22.041 align:end size:72% position:72% line:91%
One of her non ironic,
ironic ones.

00:02:22.074 --> 00:02:23.309 align:start position:0% line:85%
Non ironic, ironic.

00:02:23.342 --> 00:02:26.279 line:91%
The only ironic part
of that song is its existence.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.448 size:78% position:39% line:91%
That's the whole thing.
It's a whole work.

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:29.682 align:start position:0% line:85%
It actually is-

00:02:29.715 --> 00:02:30.884 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Thank you, Becky [inaudible
00:02:31].

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:35.355 line:91%
Thank you. From a straight up
grammatical sense,

00:02:35.388 --> 00:02:37.323 line:85%
it is a perfect lesson in irony.

00:02:37.356 --> 00:02:39.025 size:88% position:44% line:91%
She was attempting
to be ironic and failed-

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:41.794 line:91%
Do you think she was
that obtuse with the song?

00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:43.263 line:85%
I think that's probably how dumb

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:44.597 size:78% position:39% line:91%
a lot of the record execs
are too.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:45.999 size:84% position:42% line:91%
They don't know
what irony actually ...

00:02:46.032 --> 00:02:47.433 size:84% position:42% line:91%
They're like this is great,
this is smart-

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:48.635 size:81% position:41% line:85%
I love it. She's an angel.

00:02:48.668 --> 00:02:50.103 size:81% position:41% line:91%
People are gonna learn.
People are learning.

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:51.404 line:85%
People are learning about irony.

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:53.840 line:91%
We're learning about platinum
albums,

00:02:53.873 --> 00:02:55.208 size:81% position:41% line:85%
because she's making them.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:57.944 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Jagged Little Pill
[crosstalk 00:02:56].

00:02:57.977 --> 00:03:00.246 line:91%
Here's a spoon.
He goes, isn't that ironic?

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.514 align:start position:0% line:85%
I need a knife.

00:03:01.547 --> 00:03:05.418 size:84% position:42% line:91%
He goes, I just met the guy
of my dreams

00:03:05.451 --> 00:03:07.353 align:start position:0% line:85%
and his beautiful wife.

00:03:07.386 --> 00:03:08.688 align:start position:0% line:85%
That's his wife.

00:03:08.721 --> 00:03:09.889 align:start position:0% line:85%
Are you gay? Yes.

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:11.324 align:start position:0% line:85%
Is that ironic?

00:03:11.357 --> 00:03:13.159 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Don't you think?
It's like rain ...

00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.796 size:75% position:38% line:91%
I'm trying to think
about the lyrics.

00:03:17.964 --> 00:03:20.266 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Why would I get in this cab?
I'm already late.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:24.037 size:81% position:41% line:91%
My plane's crashing.
I go isn't that nice?

00:03:25.572 --> 00:03:26.806 size:88% position:44% line:85%
I've been afraid to do this.

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:28.141 size:69% position:34% line:91%
We were talking before
the break,

00:03:28.174 --> 00:03:29.342 size:78% position:39% line:85%
before you came in about-

00:03:29.375 --> 00:03:30.543 align:start position:0% line:85%
Porn?

00:03:30.576 --> 00:03:31.744 align:start position:0% line:85%
No. That was yesterday.

00:03:31.777 --> 00:03:35.081 line:91%
I do also hate it when you find
a no smoking sign

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.650 size:75% position:38% line:85%
on your cigarette break.

00:03:37.683 --> 00:03:39.886 size:88% position:44% line:85%
Just go smoke anywhere else.

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.889 align:start position:0% line:91%
Knowing my luck, I'll win the
lotto and then die the next day.

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:44.224 align:start position:0% line:85%
Right?

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:45.425 align:start position:0% line:85%
Am I right?

00:03:45.458 --> 00:03:46.893 size:78% position:39% line:85%
Am I right or am I wrong?

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:49.229 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Before the break,
we were talking about men

00:03:49.262 --> 00:03:52.565 size:78% position:39% line:91%
with dual families,
with two families.

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:56.035 size:84% position:42% line:91%
We were talking about
having a shitty father-

00:03:56.068 --> 00:03:58.638 line:91%
You mean like Gambion Bonanno,
you belong to both-

00:03:58.671 --> 00:04:00.840 size:75% position:38% line:91%
No, not crime families.
Actual platonic-

00:04:00.873 --> 00:04:04.544 line:91%
Having a shitty father like me
and Dan and Isabella over here.

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:06.980 size:69% position:34% line:91%
I think you've seen
the recipient

00:04:07.013 --> 00:04:08.715 line:85%
of the second generation award.

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:10.583 size:75% position:38% line:91%
You've seen what my work
has done there.

00:04:10.616 --> 00:04:11.884 align:start position:0% line:85%
There it is.

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:15.021 line:91%
We're talking about if you have
shitty dad, you want to be-

00:04:15.054 --> 00:04:16.823 line:91%
Like you have step siblings,
is that what you're saying?

00:04:16.856 --> 00:04:18.258 size:78% position:39% line:91%
No. I'm saying you want
to be a better ...

00:04:18.291 --> 00:04:21.828 line:91%
If you were to have a kid ...
Luis was an example of that.

00:04:21.861 --> 00:04:24.697 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Luis J. Gomez, great father.
Really tough.

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:26.933 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Had a dad that got murdered,
was not in his life

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:30.270 line:91%
and then he's a great dad.
We were saying how fucked up-

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:31.537 size:84% position:42% line:85%
He's at least a living dad.

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:32.805 size:66% position:33% line:91%
He's a living dad.
He's alive.

00:04:32.838 --> 00:04:35.041 size:81% position:41% line:91%
My thought was, I think
what would fuck me up

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:38.311 line:91%
psychologically more than having
a dead dad would be having a dad

00:04:38.344 --> 00:04:41.681 line:91%
that's alive with another family
and hiding it from you,

00:04:41.714 --> 00:04:43.483 size:69% position:34% line:91%
like living with you
at your house

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.918 line:91%
and with your mom and then goes
and has another family.

00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:47.220 align:start position:0% line:85%
Like Lifetime movie-

00:04:47.253 --> 00:04:49.756 line:91%
There's a character on Billions,
dollar bill, that has that.

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.491 align:start position:0% line:85%
My dad dd do that ...

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:56.162 align:start position:0% line:91%
Your dad went out
and was a single swanky swinger.

00:04:56.195 --> 00:04:57.664 size:69% position:34% line:91%
Dude, he fucking was
an indoor cat

00:04:57.697 --> 00:04:59.766 size:88% position:44% line:91%
and they let him outside
and he did not come home.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:02.068 size:84% position:42% line:91%
[crosstalk 00:05:01]
I'm an outdoor cat now.

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:06.139 line:91%
Dan's dad, he wore sunglasses
at night for sure.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:08.508 size:78% position:39% line:91%
My dad definitely had ...
I remember-

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:09.876 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Is your dad still alive,
do you know?

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:11.144 line:85%
No. My dad died when I was 14.

00:05:11.177 --> 00:05:12.412 align:start position:0% line:85%
Oh shit.

00:05:12.445 --> 00:05:13.946 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah. He went out.

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:15.481 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Him and Luis's dad
killed each other.

00:05:15.514 --> 00:05:17.250 line:85%
Yeah, in a duel. It was pretty-

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:18.551 size:81% position:41% line:85%
Of age, or another STD or-

00:05:18.584 --> 00:05:20.453 align:start position:0% line:85%
I wish. Not far.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:21.888 size:72% position:36% line:91%
Hep C that turned

00:11:25.951 --> 00:11:29.155 line:91%
I go around jaunt in sweatpants

00:11:29.188 --> 00:11:31.290 size:88% position:44% line:91%
A lot of jackets,
I'm dressing for scurvy.

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:34.760 align:start position:0% line:85%
Get some lime.

00:11:35.528 --> 00:11:37.763 align:end size:78% position:78% line:91%
My dad didn't wear socks
and no underwear.

00:11:37.796 --> 00:11:39.865 size:78% position:39% line:91%
I believe it.
Were his feet ripe?

00:11:39.898 --> 00:11:41.600 size:81% position:41% line:91%
No. He had like
tough islander feet.

00:11:41.633 --> 00:11:44.403 size:88% position:44% line:91%
They don't smell anymore
because they don't sweat

00:11:44.904 --> 00:11:47.707 align:start position:0% line:91%
[crosstalk 00:11:44].
He burned all the sweat glands.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:49.608 align:end size:75% position:75% line:91%
Also he's just drinking
enough alcohol

00:11:49.641 --> 00:11:51.544 size:81% position:41% line:91%
to sterilize
anything on his body.

00:11:52.912 --> 00:11:54.146 size:88% position:44% line:85%
I'm surprised my dad didn't-

00:11:54.179 --> 00:11:55.481 align:start position:0% line:85%
Your dad sweats iodine.

00:11:55.514 --> 00:11:59.485 line:91%
I'm so surprised it didn't cure
the Hep C the second

00:11:59.518 --> 00:12:01.887 size:88% position:44% line:91%
it touched his fucking
alcohol rich bloodstream.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:03.122 align:start position:0% line:85%
Just catches on fire.

00:12:03.155 --> 00:12:05.758 align:start position:0% line:91%
Hep C, you say?
I'll knock that out by tonight.

00:12:05.791 --> 00:12:07.093 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:12:07.126 --> 00:12:08.594 size:72% position:36% line:91%
Sometimes I get it
when I'm bored.

00:12:08.627 --> 00:12:09.862 align:start position:0% line:85%
I just watch it-

00:12:09.895 --> 00:12:11.130 size:75% position:38% line:85%
To have something to do.

00:12:11.163 --> 00:12:12.865 align:start position:0% line:85%
I heal like Wolverine.

00:12:13.699 --> 00:12:16.569 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I go out there, give myself
lockjaw just for fun.

00:12:16.602 --> 00:12:17.870 align:start position:0% line:85%
Just do it.

00:12:17.903 --> 00:12:19.338 size:72% position:36% line:91%
What's your dad's name?
Dean?

00:12:19.371 --> 00:12:21.207 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Gary. That's why
we're sons of Gary.

00:12:22.374 --> 00:12:24.110 size:72% position:36% line:91%
He has a shitty dad
named Gary too.

00:12:24.677 --> 00:12:25.978 size:81% position:41% line:85%
That's why we're so close.

00:12:26.011 --> 00:12:27.713 size:75% position:38% line:91%
My dad's name is Tim.
He's pretty cool.

00:12:27.746 --> 00:12:29.014 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Tim does sound
like a good dad name.

00:12:29.047 --> 00:12:30.349 align:start position:0% line:85%
Tim's a good dad name-

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:31.550 align:start position:0% line:85%
Tim Patton?

00:12:31.583 --> 00:12:32.785 align:start position:0% line:85%
Tim Patton. Good guy.

00:12:32.818 --> 00:12:34.120 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Tim Patton and his kids

00:12:34.153 --> 00:12:35.488 size:78% position:39% line:91%
I'd be like
I fucking love Tim.

00:12:35.521 --> 00:12:38.090 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Were either of you guys
doing moon tower

00:12:38.123 --> 00:12:40.760 size:84% position:42% line:91%
that year that they gave
everyone flesh lights?

00:12:40.793 --> 00:12:42.061 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:12:42.094 --> 00:12:43.262 size:78% position:39% line:85%
I wasn't there that year.

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:44.463 size:69% position:34% line:91%
I was there that year.
You were.

00:12:44.496 --> 00:12:46.031 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Everybody pretended like
they didn't

00:12:46.064 --> 00:12:47.867 size:88% position:44% line:91%
go immediately
to their room and use it.

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.301 size:78% position:39% line:85%
I was very open about it.

00:12:49.334 --> 00:12:51.036 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Everyone pretended,
like no I didn't.

[crosstalk

00:12:51.069 --> 00:12:52.304 line:92%

00:12:52.337 --> 00:12:54.273 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I was embarrassed that
I didn't finish in it.

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:57.343 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I think I've owned two.
I think I've owned two.

00:12:57.376 --> 00:12:59.779 size:84% position:42% line:85%
I've never utilized either.

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:01.413 size:88% position:44% line:85%
I felt like a serial killer.

00:13:01.446 --> 00:13:02.681 align:start position:0% line:85%
I bet.

00:13:02.714 --> 00:13:05.718 size:88% position:44% line:91%
You see the rubber moving.
You're like what is this?

00:13:05.751 --> 00:13:07.520 line:91%
Is this an organ?
Is this a dead person's organ?

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:08.754 align:start position:0% line:85%
It's fucking weird.

00:13:08.787 --> 00:13:10.890 size:75% position:38% line:85%
Which mount did you use?

00:13:10.923 --> 00:13:12.191 align:start position:0% line:85%
What do you mean?

00:13:12.224 --> 00:13:14.126 line:85%
They had the vaginal opening,

00:13:14.159 --> 00:13:15.628 size:84% position:42% line:91%
the anal opening
and then just the slit.

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:16.862 align:start position:0% line:85%
I didn't know that.

00:13:16.895 --> 00:13:19.431 line:91%
I just opened the top like

00:13:19.464 --> 00:13:20.933 align:end size:69% position:69% line:91%
You must have not got
the deluxe.

00:13:20.966 --> 00:13:22.301 size:75% position:38% line:91%
I didn't get the deluxe.
Damn dude.

00:13:22.334 --> 00:13:23.602 line:91%
That's when you're a headliner
at moon tower.

00:13:23.635 --> 00:13:24.870 align:start position:0% line:85%
Then every-

00:13:24.903 --> 00:13:27.173 align:start position:0% line:91%
I was also at the Radisson.
Did all the Radisson people get-

00:13:27.206 --> 00:13:28.741 align:start position:0% line:85%
I was at the Radisson.

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:30.476 size:75% position:38% line:85%
It's like a Rambo knife.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:33.279 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Oh my god, there's a compass
on the bottom.

00:13:33.312 --> 00:13:35.014 size:84% position:42% line:91%
There's a whole sewing kit,
tweezers.

00:13:35.047 --> 00:13:36.348 size:81% position:41% line:85%
You can stitch up a wound-

00:13:36.381 --> 00:13:39.285 line:91%
There's a corkscrew in there.
You can open-

00:13:39.318 --> 00:13:40.719 size:78% position:39% line:85%
There's one single match.

00:13:40.752 --> 00:13:42.321 line:91%
A blue tip though.
You can light it on anything.

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:44.089 align:start position:0% line:85%
Strike anywhere.

00:13:44.122 --> 00:13:45.724 size:88% position:44% line:91%
They recommend you open
a bottle of wine with it,

00:13:45.757 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0% line:85%
while using it.

00:13:46.992 --> 00:13:49.228 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Don't you understand,
this dildo is the best?

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:51.630 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Everyone just left them
in the hotel rooms?

00:13:51.663 --> 00:13:53.766 size:84% position:42% line:91%
It can fuck things

00:13:54.967 --> 00:13:56.202 size:88% position:44% line:85%
I know because I trained it.

00:13:57.603 --> 00:13:59.972 size:75% position:38% line:91%

00:14:02.041 --> 00:14:05.244 line:91%
Of course, you know that knife.
That dildo is built by the best.

00:14:06.545 --> 00:14:08.280 line:85%
Was that Stallone you just did?

00:14:08.313 --> 00:14:10.216 align:start position:0% line:85%
That was his Rambo.

00:14:10.249 --> 00:14:11.517 align:start position:0% line:85%
Particularly my Rambo.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.286 size:81% position:41% line:91%
It's Stallone
in the key of Rambo.

00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:17.590 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Key of. Can't even get a job
parking the fucking cars.

00:14:17.623 --> 00:14:19.191 size:75% position:38% line:91%
I still have never seen
the first Rambo.

00:14:19.224 --> 00:14:20.425 size:69% position:34% line:91%
You've never seen
First Blood?

00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:23.162 line:91%
I know. I've only seen the one
where he's in the jungle.

00:14:23.195 --> 00:14:24.396 align:start position:0% line:85%
No.

00:14:24.429 --> 00:14:26.799 line:91%
We had one of the most fun ...
Best one is First Blood-

00:14:26.832 --> 00:14:28.667 size:69% position:34% line:91%
First Blood is easily
the best one.

00:14:29.268 --> 00:14:30.469 align:start position:0% line:85%
Don't blow it yet.

00:14:30.502 --> 00:14:32.137 size:75% position:38% line:91%
We just do a fun thing

00:14:32.170 --> 00:14:33.372 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:14:33.405 --> 00:14:34.874 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Joe DeRosa has a very
interesting take on

00:14:34.907 --> 00:14:36.108 align:start position:0% line:85%
First Blood.

00:14:36.141 --> 00:14:38.210 line:91%
That's a little preview
for the lost at sea tapes,

00:14:38.243 --> 00:14:40.679 line:91%
that we recorded on
the Impractical Jokers cruise.

00:14:40.712 --> 00:14:41.914 size:78% position:39% line:85%
Were you guys both there?

00:14:41.947 --> 00:14:43.148 align:start position:0% line:85%
Yeah.

00:14:43.181 --> 00:14:46.385 line:91%
Just living ...
Do you want to talk about it?

00:14:46.418 --> 00:14:48.587 line:91%
We have a bunch of episodes
that we recorded on the boat.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:49.822 align:start position:0% line:85%
Fun hang though.

00:14:49.855 --> 00:14:51.023 align:start position:0% line:85%
DeRosa was there?

00:14:51.056 --> 00:14:52.291 align:start position:0% line:85%
Fun hang.

00:14:52.324 --> 00:14:53.492 align:start position:0% line:85%
He didn't jump off?

00:14:53.525 --> 00:14:54.894 size:75% position:38% line:91%
We thought he might have
Saturday night.

00:14:54.927 --> 00:14:56.896 size:84% position:42% line:91%
I thought last night
he was gonna go for it.

00:14:56.929 --> 00:14:59.431 line:91%
He was sad. He was sad drunk and
he's like everyone's mad at me-

00:14:59.464 --> 00:15:01.133 size:84% position:42% line:91%
He drunkenly thought
everyone was mad at him

00:15:01.166 --> 00:15:02.468 align:start position:0% line:85%
at different times.

00:15:02.501 --> 00:15:04.136 line:91%
Then you'd be like I don't think
it's that big of a deal

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:06.605 size:78% position:39% line:91%
and he'd go
what did I do, man?

00:15:06.638 --> 00:15:09.708 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Why me? Why always me?
I'm like it's fine.

00:15:09.741 --> 00:15:11.110 size:88% position:44% line:91%
I don't think
it's that big of a deal.

00:15:11.143 --> 00:15:13.712 size:84% position:42% line:85%
He goes what did I do, man?

00:15:13.745 --> 00:15:15.281 size:81% position:41% line:91%
Then he'd always come back
15 minutes later

00:15:15.314 --> 00:15:18.217 align:start position:0% line:91%
and go they said they were
joking, they weren't mad at me.

00:15:19.151 --> 00:15:21.053 size:88% position:44% line:91%
Then every time
you talked to Nate or I,

00:15:21.086 --> 00:15:23.722 line:91%
it was like do you want to play
craps or go get ice cream?

00:15:23.755 --> 00:15:26.392 align:end size:75% position:75% line:91%
Yeah, we lived on craps
and ice cream.

00:15:26.425 --> 00:15:29.395 line:91%
I heard this story about him
at Edinburgh a few years ago-

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:30.596 align:start position:0% line:85%
Nate?

00:15:30.629 --> 00:15:31.897 align:start position:0% line:85%
No, about DeRosa,

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:36.869 line:91%
that his roommates kept
putting dead bees in his room

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:38.971 size:84% position:42% line:85%
just to hear him freak out.

00:15:39.004 --> 00:15:41.540 size:84% position:42% line:91%
That's really funny.
Who were his roommates?

00:15:41.573 --> 00:15:42.741 align:start position:0% line:85%
Ari was one of them.

00:15:42.774 --> 00:15:44.109 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Ari is the one
who told me this story

00:15:44.142 --> 00:15:46.712 line:91%
and then I forgot the other, two
Brits I think-

00:15:46.745 --> 00:15:47.947 align:start position:0% line:85%
Just some Scottish guy.

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.181 align:start position:0% line:85%
They had-

00:15:49.214 --> 00:15:53.018 align:end size:88% position:88% line:91%

loses his shit hearing

00:15:53.051 --> 00:15:54.586 align:start position:0% line:85%
a dead bee in his bed.

00:15:54.619 --> 00:15:57.022 size:88% position:44% line:91%
He can't handle a wasp.
Let's find one of those.

00:15:57.890 --> 00:15:59.825 size:78% position:39% line:91%
Damn near throws
his glasses at it.

00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:03.896 size:81% position:41% line:91%
You can literally hear
a man's head explode.

00:16:03.929 --> 00:16:06.065 size:66% position:33% line:91%
Come here [crosstalk

00:16:06.098 --> 00:16:07.333 align:start position:0% line:85%
Bees.

00:16:07.366 --> 00:16:09.068 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:10.836 align:start position:0% line:85%
Bees.

00:16:10.869 --> 00:16:12.104 align:start position:0% line:85%
It's great.

00:16:12.137 --> 00:16:14.106 size:81% position:41% line:91%
You want to see a man
fly through the roof?

00:16:14.139 --> 00:16:15.708 align:start position:0% line:85%
Like a bee himself.

00:16:15.741 --> 00:16:18.210 size:75% position:38% line:91%
Hey. You should leave
a comment below.

00:16:18.243 --> 00:16:20.179 line:91%
One of us might be in a

00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:21.380 align:start position:0% line:85%
Oh.

00:16:21.413 --> 00:16:23.115 size:75% position:38% line:91%
It might just push us

00:16:23.148 --> 00:16:26.051 size:84% position:42% line:91%
Yeah. Yeah.
I can get pretty dark.
