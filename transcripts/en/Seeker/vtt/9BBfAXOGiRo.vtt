00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.840
There’s a bunch of rocks floating up there
in space.

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:10.620
What separates “ohhh, pretty lights,”
from “ahhhh we’re all gonna die!!!”?

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.400
Hey everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.020
Shooting stars have a magical ethos.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.140
We’re told to make a wish when we see them
streak across the sky, but you should probably

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.010
already thank your lucky stars.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.920
If we didn’t have an atmosphere, they would
be a lot more dangerous.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.760
First of all, “shooting stars” is a misnomer,
because they’re not stars zipping about.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.840
They’re meteoroids, bits of dust usually
left by comets or asteroids.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:38.070
We see them at 70 to 120 km away, when they’re
just starting to dip into our mesosphere and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.780
the air starts becoming dense enough to give
the meteoroid some resistance.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.370
And it only gets more dense the closer to
Earth they get.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.930
These meteoroids are traveling fast, between
11 and 71 km per second, and the friction

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.850
from rubbing against all that air at those
speeds heats them up as much as 1600 degrees

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.710
celsius, causing them to burn up and leave
a streak of light called a meteor.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.000
Meteoroids the size of sand grains and smaller
enter our atmosphere every day by the truckload.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.790
NASA estimates a hundred tons of dust hits
us every single day.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.960
But they’re so small they don’t have enough
momentum to keep up their speed when they

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.070
hit the air.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.189
Instead they slow down and make it all the
way to earth.

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.250
If you want to see a show, there are about
a dozen major meteor showers a year, and they

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.869
happen predictably because the Earth keeps
passing through the wake of the same comets.

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.890
Some particles the comets left behind are
about the size of pebbles, so they’re big

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.920
enough to keep up their speed and ignite.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.759
It’s pretty impressive that we can see them
as far as 120 km away.

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:35.750
That should tell you a little bit about how
much energy they have at those speeds, even

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.219
though they’re itty bitty.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:41.369
So imagine how much energy meteoroids have
when they’re the size of a car.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.299
They cause huge fireballs, brighter than the
planet Venus.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.749
Meteoroid size varies a lot, they can be up
to a hundred meters across before they’re

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:53.270
classified as asteroids, but so long as they’re
less than 25 meters across, the atmosphere

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.990
usually burns them up.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.249
Sometimes upon entry they break apart with
a bright terminal flash, called a bolide.

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:03.039
Bolides are harmless, but the optical energy
they give off as light can be in the rage

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:07.439
of a hundred thousand gigajoules, a hundred
times more energetic than the bomb dropped

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.709
on Nagasaki.

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.340
Bolides are detected about 28 times a year.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.739
So obviously our atmosphere is doing us a
solid.

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:17.760
More than just giving us the air we breathe
and protection from UV rays, the atmosphere

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.099
is running interference on meteoroids and
asteroids too, making sure our planet isn’t

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.650
as cratered as my face was in high school.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.650
But who watches the watchmen?

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.269
Turns out the atmosphere needs a little help
too from earth’s magnetic field.

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.040
The magnetic field produced by the spinning
iron core diverts the charged particles the

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.280
sun is constantly shooting into space away
from our atmosphere.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.900
If we didn’t have it, our asteroid shield
would be blown away by the solar wind.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.510
So the Earth is shielding the atmosphere which
is shielding the Earth.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.510
Isn’t that sweet?

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.909
Mars doesn’t have much of an atmosphere
because it has no magnetic field, and would

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.630
you look at that, it gets hit with meteorites
200 times a year.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.049
Even with the atmosphere intercepting most
space rocks before they can impact the surface,

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:58.349
Earth still gets hit with a biggie every now
and then.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.299
NASA estimates an asteroid the size of a football
field gets through and causes significant

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:04.840
damage to the local area once every 2000 years.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.209
If it’s over a kilometer wide it could have
global impacts; the meteorite that wiped out

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.500
the dinosaurs was estimated to be 10 km across.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.080
NASA isn’t leaving our fate to chance, and
is working to track dangerous Near Earth Objects.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.450
They hope to one day send astronauts to study
a dangerous asteroid before sending said asteroid

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.469
into a harmless orbit around the moon.

00:03:23.469 --> 00:03:27.440
Yes, it sounds like NASA got the idea from
a Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck movie.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.150
So now you know why meteoroids burn up, but
what if they make it all the way to earth?

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:47.060
Trace has the scoop on meteorites here.
