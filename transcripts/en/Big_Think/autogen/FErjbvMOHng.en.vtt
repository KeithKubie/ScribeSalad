00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
chronological so it was you know it was
just<00:05:33.940><c> this</c><00:05:34.210><c> mental</c><00:05:34.720><c> block</c><00:05:34.750><c> in</c><00:05:35.080><c> my</c><00:05:35.199><c> head</c><00:05:35.440><c> and</c>

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 align:start position:0%
just this mental block in my head and
 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.339 align:start position:0%
just this mental block in my head and
and<00:05:35.949><c> I</c><00:05:36.430><c> found</c><00:05:36.699><c> that</c><00:05:36.880><c> very</c><00:05:37.449><c> very</c><00:05:38.080><c> challenging</c>

00:05:38.339 --> 00:05:38.349 align:start position:0%
and I found that very very challenging
 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:40.890 align:start position:0%
and I found that very very challenging
but<00:05:38.770><c> I</c><00:05:38.800><c> think</c><00:05:38.889><c> what</c><00:05:39.370><c> happened</c><00:05:39.820><c> ultimately</c><00:05:40.030><c> was</c>

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 align:start position:0%
but I think what happened ultimately was
 

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.529 align:start position:0%
but I think what happened ultimately was
that<00:05:41.139><c> I</c><00:05:41.430><c> began</c><00:05:42.430><c> to</c><00:05:42.490><c> feel</c><00:05:42.789><c> like</c><00:05:42.940><c> my</c><00:05:43.150><c> father</c><00:05:43.300><c> was</c>

00:05:43.529 --> 00:05:43.539 align:start position:0%
that I began to feel like my father was
 

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:46.770 align:start position:0%
that I began to feel like my father was

on stage with me for the duration of the

on stage with me for the duration of the
performance<00:05:47.380><c> so</c><00:05:47.880><c> I</c><00:05:49.500><c> tried</c><00:05:50.500><c> to</c><00:05:50.530><c> flip</c><00:05:50.889><c> it</c><00:05:51.039><c> so</c><00:05:51.070><c> it</c>

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
performance so I tried to flip it so it
 

00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.620 align:start position:0%
performance so I tried to flip it so it
was<00:05:51.400><c> like</c><00:05:51.520><c> a</c><00:05:51.550><c> positive</c><00:05:51.820><c> thing</c><00:05:52.270><c> that</c><00:05:52.419><c> I</c><00:05:52.449><c> was</c>

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:52.630 align:start position:0%
was like a positive thing that I was
 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
was like a positive thing that I was
with<00:05:52.870><c> him</c><00:05:54.210><c> for</c><00:05:55.210><c> the</c><00:05:55.330><c> whole</c><00:05:55.510><c> hour</c><00:05:55.810><c> and</c><00:05:56.169><c> 40</c>

with him for the whole hour and 40
minutes<00:05:56.710><c> and</c><00:05:56.949><c> I</c><00:05:57.820><c> think</c><00:05:58.000><c> that</c><00:05:58.150><c> helped</c><00:05:58.419><c> a</c><00:05:58.510><c> little</c>

00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:58.570 align:start position:0%
minutes and I think that helped a little
 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:00.089 align:start position:0%
minutes and I think that helped a little
but<00:05:58.750><c> it</c><00:05:58.870><c> was</c><00:05:58.960><c> it</c><00:05:59.229><c> was</c><00:05:59.320><c> definitely</c><00:05:59.830><c> difficult</c>

00:06:00.089 --> 00:06:00.099 align:start position:0%
