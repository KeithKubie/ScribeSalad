00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:01.777
Narrator: What I want to do in this video

00:00:01.777 --> 00:00:03.869
is think about why it's so hard for

00:00:03.869 --> 00:00:08.473
a monopolistic competitor to make money

00:00:08.473 --> 00:00:11.480
in the long run.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.917
Just as a reminder, a
monopolistic competitor

00:00:12.917 --> 00:00:15.420
is much closer to perfect
competition then it is

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.362
to a monopoly.

00:00:16.362 --> 00:00:17.571
What it means is that you have a monopoly

00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:19.888
in your differentiated product,

00:00:19.888 --> 00:00:21.728
but eventually other
people are going to make

00:00:21.728 --> 00:00:22.886
substitute products.

00:00:22.886 --> 00:00:24.328
They can't make exactly your product,

00:00:24.328 --> 00:00:26.398
it can't be identical and it might eat

00:00:26.398 --> 00:00:27.599
into your demand.

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.995
To understand that, let
us draw the demand curve

00:00:30.995 --> 00:00:37.330
for a market in which
monopolistic competition

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.933
is going on.

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.530
I will draw it nice and big.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.576
In this axis right over
here I'm going to plot

00:00:42.576 --> 00:00:47.536
dollars per unit and so price is revenue

00:00:47.536 --> 00:00:49.198
per unit and we'll have cost per unit

00:00:49.198 --> 00:00:50.534
and things like that.

00:00:50.534 --> 00:00:52.697
And in this axis I'm going
to have quantity produced

00:00:52.697 --> 00:00:54.203
in an given period of time.

00:00:54.203 --> 00:00:55.864
We're going to speak
in fairly general terms

00:00:55.864 --> 00:00:56.795
over here.

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:01.125
Now, let's assume that our
monopolistic competitor

00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:05.160
right over here is Apple and it's iPad's.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.705
(writing) Apple, iPad's.

00:01:06.705 --> 00:01:09.737
I want to emphasize, I'm
not making any accusations

00:01:09.737 --> 00:01:12.210
that Apple is a monopolist here.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.134
They just have a differentiated product

00:01:14.134 --> 00:01:16.625
and so they are monopolistic
competitors here,

00:01:16.625 --> 00:01:18.930
they have a monopoly in iPad's.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.333
They don't have a monopoly
in Tablet computers

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:23.332
or computers in general, but only they can

00:01:23.332 --> 00:01:24.869
sell iPad's.

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.961
So, let's draw the demand
curve in the short run

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:29.406
for iPad's and I'll make it linear to

00:01:29.406 --> 00:01:31.467
make things simple.

00:01:31.467 --> 00:01:32.735
Let me draw a little bit better than that.

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:34.570
Let's say the demand curve looks something

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.521
like that.

00:01:35.521 --> 00:01:39.588
That is our demand curve
and we know that if that's

00:01:39.588 --> 00:01:42.250
the demand curve and
remember we're talking about

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.258
the market for iPad's,
not the market for Tablet

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:47.059
computers, Apple is the
monopolist in the market

00:01:47.059 --> 00:01:50.408
for iPad's, so it's
marginal revenue will have

00:01:50.408 --> 00:01:53.660
twice the slope of this demand curve.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.576
So, it will look something like that.

00:01:56.576 --> 00:01:59.668
That is Apple's marginal revenue curve

00:01:59.668 --> 00:02:02.185
and then think about its
short run economic profit

00:02:02.185 --> 00:02:03.854
in a given period of time,
whatever this quantity

00:02:03.854 --> 00:02:05.784
per period of time is.

00:02:05.784 --> 00:02:09.084
Let's draw its cost,
so first I'll draw ...

00:02:09.084 --> 00:02:11.498
Let me draw its marginal cost,

00:02:11.498 --> 00:02:14.587
so its marginal cost might
look something like this.

00:02:14.587 --> 00:02:18.582
That is their marginal
cost and then to do average

00:02:18.582 --> 00:02:22.166
total cost, up here when
you have very low quantity,

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:24.165
most of your costs are fixed cost,

00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:26.076
but you're dividing it
by a very small quantity

00:02:26.076 --> 00:02:27.787
so you're going to have a very high

00:02:27.787 --> 00:02:29.061
average total cost.

00:02:29.061 --> 00:02:30.743
It's going to get lower
and lower and lower

00:02:30.743 --> 00:02:32.826
as long as the cost on
each incremental unit

00:02:32.826 --> 00:02:34.779
is lower than the average

00:02:34.779 --> 00:02:36.591
and the cost on each incremental unit is

00:02:36.591 --> 00:02:38.716
a marginal cost curve.

00:02:38.716 --> 00:02:41.332
As long as an average total cost is higher

00:02:41.332 --> 00:02:46.526
than the marginal cost
curve, that's going to be

00:02:46.526 --> 00:02:48.856
downward sloping, and at
some point they're going

00:02:48.856 --> 00:02:50.254
to be equal to each other.

00:02:50.254 --> 00:02:52.794
Now, each incremental unit that you add on

00:02:52.794 --> 00:02:54.123
is going to increase the average

00:02:54.123 --> 00:02:56.394
because each incremental
unit's cost is more

00:02:56.394 --> 00:02:58.856
than the average, so it's
going to cause everything

00:02:58.856 --> 00:03:01.787
to average up.

00:03:01.787 --> 00:03:03.510
This actually right
over here should be the

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.258
minimum point on our
average total cost curve.

00:03:07.258 --> 00:03:09.818
Given the way I've drawn
things, what is Apple's

00:03:09.818 --> 00:03:12.524
short run economic profit?

00:03:12.524 --> 00:03:14.821
We just have to think
of its optimal quantity

00:03:14.821 --> 00:03:16.186
to produce.

00:03:16.186 --> 00:03:18.071
It's definitely going to produce one,

00:03:18.071 --> 00:03:20.080
so the marginal revenue
much higher than the

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.531
marginal cost is going
to make economic profit

00:03:21.531 --> 00:03:23.132
on that unit, it's going to keep producing

00:03:23.132 --> 00:03:25.932
because that continues
to be true all the way

00:03:25.932 --> 00:03:27.731
until this point right over here.

00:03:27.731 --> 00:03:29.824
It doesn't want to produce
more than that because

00:03:29.824 --> 00:03:33.455
the opportunity cost on
each incremental unit

00:03:33.455 --> 00:03:35.595
is higher than the revenue on that,

00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:37.479
so you're going to take an economic loss.

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:39.594
So, you're going to
produce right over there

00:03:39.594 --> 00:03:43.396
and at that quantity, I'll call that Q*

00:03:43.396 --> 00:03:44.481
right over there.

00:03:44.481 --> 00:03:46.325
At that quantity this
is the price that they

00:03:46.325 --> 00:03:47.731
can charge in the market going in to

00:03:47.731 --> 00:03:48.792
the demand curve.

00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:50.421
I just went straight
up to the demand curve

00:03:50.421 --> 00:03:51.198
over there.

00:03:51.198 --> 00:03:53.696
This is the price that they can charge

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:56.803
in the market and there
average or you could view

00:03:56.803 --> 00:03:59.034
that as their average revenue per unit.

00:03:59.034 --> 00:04:01.467
Then we have our average cost per unit

00:04:01.467 --> 00:04:04.099
right over here, an average total cost.

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:07.465
This is their average
economic profit per unit.

00:04:07.465 --> 00:04:10.891
If we multiply that times
the total number of units.

00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:13.603
If we multiply times the
total number of units

00:04:13.603 --> 00:04:16.640
the area of this rectangle right over here

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.969
is going to give total economic profit.

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:23.665
(writing) total, total,
economic, economic,

00:04:23.665 --> 00:04:25.935
economic profit.

00:04:25.935 --> 00:04:29.005
Now, in all things, if
the rest of the world sees

00:04:29.005 --> 00:04:30.804
economic profit they're just like,

00:04:30.804 --> 00:04:33.225
wow that's a good ...
people are doing better

00:04:33.225 --> 00:04:35.640
in that market than
their opportunity cost.

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.736
So other competitors say
well I can't produce iPad's

00:04:37.736 --> 00:04:40.205
but I can start making
competitive products,

00:04:40.205 --> 00:04:43.326
so you'll see players like Samsung

00:04:43.326 --> 00:04:46.144
and we are seeing this,
sitting here in 2012

00:04:46.144 --> 00:04:48.470
and this is a work in progress for these

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:49.933
competitors right over here.

00:04:49.933 --> 00:04:54.970
Samsung htc, HP, all the
tablet manufacturers,

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:56.400
all the computer manufacturers
and they're pairing

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.640
up, they're pairing up
with the operating system

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:05.341
manufacturers like Microsoft
and Google's Android

00:05:05.341 --> 00:05:07.302
and they're making competitive products.

00:05:07.302 --> 00:05:10.325
And on top of it they are marketing it,

00:05:10.325 --> 00:05:12.403
they are marketing it heavily.

00:05:12.403 --> 00:05:14.133
(writing)they are marketing.

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:15.604
They are trying to market the products

00:05:15.604 --> 00:05:17.139
as aggressively as possible.

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:19.602
So, as their products become more and more

00:05:19.602 --> 00:05:21.600
comparable to an iPad,
or maybe even better

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.553
in certain dimensions,
either cost or features

00:05:23.553 --> 00:05:25.182
and they market heavily.

00:05:25.182 --> 00:05:26.967
In the long run what's going to happen to

00:05:26.967 --> 00:05:28.809
Apple's demand curve?

00:05:28.809 --> 00:05:31.403
Well, at any given price
less will be demanded

00:05:31.403 --> 00:05:34.127
and so the demand curve will shift.

00:05:34.127 --> 00:05:36.143
The demand curve will shift to the left

00:05:36.143 --> 00:05:38.894
and so we could end up
with a new demand curve.

00:05:38.894 --> 00:05:40.554
I'll do it in a different shade of blue,

00:05:40.554 --> 00:05:44.516
that looks something ...
that looks something like,

00:05:44.516 --> 00:05:46.207
(writing) That looks something like that.

00:05:46.207 --> 00:05:49.376
This is our new demand curve,

00:05:49.376 --> 00:05:51.754
or we should say, maybe
our long run demand curve

00:05:51.754 --> 00:05:53.465
after these people have
made their products

00:05:53.465 --> 00:05:55.525
better and have marketed heavily.

00:05:55.525 --> 00:05:57.794
If that's the new long run demand curve

00:05:57.794 --> 00:06:00.528
then our long run marginal revenue curve

00:06:00.528 --> 00:06:02.926
was going to have twice the slope of that,

00:06:02.926 --> 00:06:04.857
so it's going to look something like this.

00:06:04.857 --> 00:06:06.501
If it's twice the slope it's going to hit

00:06:06.501 --> 00:06:10.667
right about ... it's going to look ...

00:06:10.667 --> 00:06:12.260
I can do a better job than that.

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:14.292
Our new marginal revenue
... let me do it in a

00:06:14.292 --> 00:06:16.061
slightly different color,
I'll do it in pink.

00:06:16.061 --> 00:06:19.061
Our new marginal revenue curve will look

00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:20.453
something like that.

00:06:20.453 --> 00:06:22.984
This is long run marginal revenue.

00:06:22.984 --> 00:06:26.359
(writing) long run marginal revenue curve.

00:06:26.359 --> 00:06:29.609
Now what is the optimal quantity for Apple

00:06:29.609 --> 00:06:30.858
to produce?

00:06:30.858 --> 00:06:33.785
Now it's going to make economic profit,

00:06:33.785 --> 00:06:36.277
economic profit, economic
profit, all the way until

00:06:36.277 --> 00:06:38.453
this point right over here.

00:06:38.453 --> 00:06:41.118
Now we have this new,
I'll call it long run,

00:06:41.118 --> 00:06:43.532
long run quantity.

00:06:43.532 --> 00:06:45.387
Maybe I'll call it ... let me
do it in a different color.

00:06:45.387 --> 00:06:46.910
I'm using that pink too much.

00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.847
Long run quantity right over there

00:06:49.847 --> 00:06:52.066
and to figure out the revenue per unit

00:06:52.066 --> 00:06:55.149
or the price at that
quantity we just go up to

00:06:55.149 --> 00:06:57.117
the demand curve, our new demand curve.

00:06:57.117 --> 00:06:58.512
Remember our long run demand curve,

00:06:58.512 --> 00:06:59.989
it's right over there.

00:06:59.989 --> 00:07:01.399
It looks like, at least
the way I've drawn it,

00:07:01.399 --> 00:07:03.245
that the price hasn't changed much.

00:07:03.245 --> 00:07:05.580
We've got the same price,
but now what is our

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.785
average economic profit per unit?

00:07:07.785 --> 00:07:10.583
The way I've drawn it,
the average total cost

00:07:10.583 --> 00:07:14.117
right over there are right
about what that price is.

00:07:14.117 --> 00:07:17.513
So, our average economic profit per unit

00:07:17.513 --> 00:07:19.180
goes down to zero.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:21.736
Over here we had this nice green height

00:07:21.736 --> 00:07:23.369
and now we have no height anymore.

00:07:23.369 --> 00:07:24.718
Even though we're selling
a good number of units

00:07:24.718 --> 00:07:27.784
our average economic
profit per unit is zero.

00:07:27.784 --> 00:07:29.715
Instead of an area over there,

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:31.522
we're going to have the area of a line,

00:07:31.522 --> 00:07:33.282
which is essentially zero.

00:07:33.282 --> 00:07:36.936
Now we have zero economic,

00:07:36.936 --> 00:07:39.446
(writing) zero economic, economic,

00:07:39.446 --> 00:07:41.782
zero economic profit.

00:07:41.782 --> 00:07:43.364
The important thing to
realize for a monopolistic

00:07:43.364 --> 00:07:45.694
competitor and this wont
happen over night ...

00:07:45.694 --> 00:07:47.859
some would argue that
sitting here in 2012,

00:07:47.859 --> 00:07:50.857
early 2012, Apple is still
generating economic profit

00:07:50.857 --> 00:07:52.570
and it's always important to realize

00:07:52.570 --> 00:07:55.004
economic profit is different
than accounting profit.

00:07:55.004 --> 00:07:56.534
Accounting profit can be positive,

00:07:56.534 --> 00:08:00.003
economic profit can be
zero when accounting profit

00:08:00.003 --> 00:08:01.142
is positive.

00:08:01.142 --> 00:08:05.055
You can even have an economic loss

00:08:05.055 --> 00:08:06.936
and still have accounting profit.

00:08:06.936 --> 00:08:08.871
Some people would argue that right now

00:08:08.871 --> 00:08:10.870
Apple is still making
profits above and beyond

00:08:10.870 --> 00:08:13.571
even their opportunity
cost and this is actually

00:08:13.571 --> 00:08:15.936
a work in progress right now in 2012,

00:08:15.936 --> 00:08:18.582
that the demand curve
is shifting to the left,

00:08:18.582 --> 00:08:21.870
but eventually all of the
economic profit will be

00:08:21.870 --> 00:08:23.811
eaten up and there will be less incentive

00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:26.471
for all of these players
to be as aggressive.

00:08:26.471 --> 00:08:28.070
The important thing to realize with a

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:32.277
monopolistic competitor is
sure, they're curves look

00:08:32.277 --> 00:08:34.806
like a monopolist, but the competition

00:08:34.806 --> 00:08:37.773
doesn't happen in terms
of supply of iPad's.

00:08:37.773 --> 00:08:39.869
None of these players can supply iPad's

00:08:39.869 --> 00:08:42.609
the competitive part happens
with all of these people

00:08:42.609 --> 00:08:44.607
producing substitutes and being aggressive

00:08:44.607 --> 00:08:47.357
about it and eating in to the monopolistic

00:08:47.357 --> 00:08:49.902
competitor's demand.
