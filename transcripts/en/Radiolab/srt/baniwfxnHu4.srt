1
00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:03,240
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. This is more perfect

2
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:09,000
a series about the cases that land in
front of the Supreme Court and in this

3
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:13,110
episode, which we might as
well call penny on part two.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,420
We're going to take a deep dive into
what might be the most horrible supreme

5
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:19,560
court decision ever.

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,500
An attempt 160 years after the
fact in a Hilton hotel ballroom

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,180
to finally set it right.

8
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:36,090
[inaudible] do I know about the
USA? I know about the government.

9
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,970
Can you tell me about the constitution?

10
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:44,370
This is a case that split
the United States into

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,070
[inaudible] to the case in
question is the dred Scott Case,

12
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,530
which if you ask people,

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,070
I was wondering if you've ever
heard of the dread Scott Court case.

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,300
The dread Scott sounds
familiar, doesn't go well.

15
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,230
Nothing coming up, man. I don't know.

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:05,230
My high school history teacher
would be really mad at me right now.

17
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:08,140
I don't know. I don't remember
anything. I remember nothing.

18
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:12,060
We get a lot of people who are like,
what's that like a civil rights thing?

19
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:16,820
Probably something to do with segregation.
You're warm. I'm warm. What was it?

20
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:20,840
Obama like? The name had some
familiarity? Yes, yes. Straight. Okay,

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,970
that's great. What does that mean?
Dred Scott? It's a name. I don't know.

22
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:27,100
This is the first Emma here.

23
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:38,540
So what happens a lot of times is that
people don't actually understand why

24
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,374
they're free.

25
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:44,260
I'm so dred Scott is one of those
fundamental decisions that is,

26
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:49,300
that blazed the groundwork for the
reasons why we can live in a multicultural

27
00:01:49,971 --> 00:01:53,570
society. This is Ellie, Ms
Doll. More perfect legal editor.

28
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,310
But to really understand the case,

29
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,890
you've got to go to a
place called Fort Snelling.

30
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:05,590
It's a small army base, about 15 minutes
north of the Minneapolis airport,

31
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,160
freshly laid on the
ground. And our producer,

32
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:12,820
Julia Longoria took a trip there
right over here. And this guy,

33
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:13,660
I'm Richard Josey,

34
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,020
manager of programs here at the Minnesota
historical society gave her a tour.

35
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:18,730
Yup. So what are we walking into now?

36
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:23,530
So what you're getting ready to see right
now is, uh, the space that we think,

37
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:27,610
you know, it's probably weird dreading
area. Scott, you know, where they live.

38
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,740
Before we go in. Can you just sort
of set up, when in time are we,

39
00:02:31,741 --> 00:02:33,720
what's happening is the 1830s,

40
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:37,000
we're 30 years out from
the civil war, 1830s,

41
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:39,850
about half the states in the union
have slavery about half don't.

42
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:43,720
So it's this question that's kind of
still an answered like should we be a free

43
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:45,520
nation or should we be a slave nation?

44
00:02:45,521 --> 00:02:50,521
So there is a real tension here and there
is a real understanding here that this

45
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:56,620
might not work. And just as we're
about to reach this breaking point,

46
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,700
an army doctor named John Emerson,
a white guy, definitely a white guy,

47
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,780
slave owner,

48
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,350
steps into free territory and arrived here

49
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,360
to this army base, um,

50
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:15,470
on a hill and he brings
with him his one slave,

51
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,330
dred Scott. Um, and now we're
actually inside the fortress,

52
00:03:20,331 --> 00:03:24,860
if you will. And um, you
know, all of the stone,

53
00:03:24,861 --> 00:03:27,830
all of the will windows, um, it's,

54
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,270
it's Kinda like whenever I come
here, I have this kinda cold feeling.

55
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,070
Even when it's hot outside,

56
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,080
he walks his up to the back of this one
squat building on the far end of the

57
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:41,924
base.

58
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,050
Can you describe the, the room?

59
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,600
I think we're probably looking at a
maybe seven and a half foot ceiling.

60
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:58,953
Um,

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,420
what grain floor? Wood clapboard
floor. Um, wood stone walls.

62
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,830
It's a tiny room. A little bigger
than a king bed. There's a fireplace,

63
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,970
little tables and redwood cabinets. So
this is, uh, this is a, this is a home.

64
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,790
This is a kitchen. This is a
laundry place. This is, you know,

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,960
your one stop shop.

66
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:19,453
Uh,

67
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:25,100
and the reason this room is so important
is because dred Scott living in this

68
00:04:25,411 --> 00:04:29,040
room for the first time in
his life, he got a taste

69
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:30,850
[inaudible]

70
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:35,560
of what it might be
like to be free. I mean,

71
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:36,940
obviously he was still asleep,

72
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:41,590
but Dr. Emerson would leave the fort for
months at a time and have him work for

73
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:42,460
other people.

74
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,620
He had a degree of autonomy and Harriet
and dread met here, right? Yeah. Yeah.

75
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:52,960
When he was here, he met a girl,
1836, seven. Jeff, they met here.

76
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,650
Richard, Josie likes to stand here and
imagine just how that might've went down.

77
00:04:57,730 --> 00:05:01,780
I can imagine, you know, Harriet, uh,
you know, haven't been here and uh,

78
00:05:01,781 --> 00:05:04,120
and dread being over by the store and,

79
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,230
and having a conversation with some of
the other black guys that was here. And,

80
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,790
uh, I can imagine him saying,

81
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:14,520
did you see the new girl s here
is she comes walking by Geo?

82
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:18,850
Who is that? I'm going to make her mind

83
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:26,090
like, I can imagine him saying
that over the next few years,

84
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:30,650
dred and Harriet had two kids, both
of them girls. And I personally,

85
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:34,700
I think that what happened was
children seem to change everything.

86
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:37,120
[inaudible]

87
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,120
so what ends up happening is that Dr.
Emerson moves dred Scott and his family

88
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:45,070
back to Missouri.

89
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,330
They're back in a slave state and
Dr. Emerson ends up passing away

90
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:51,413
[inaudible]

91
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:55,920
and it seems like his wife is gonna
maybe sell dred Scott's daughters.

92
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:57,980
So what

93
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,590
dred and Harriet Scott
ended up deciding to do.

94
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:05,620
The whole reason we know dread Scott's
name is that they decide to sue for their

95
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:07,484
own freedom.

96
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,490
That's a lawsuit that dred Scott had
every right to believe that he would win.

97
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:16,980
There was a doctrine called
once free, always free,

98
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,330
that the minute your foot
landed in the snow of the north,

99
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,690
the minute you and your owner
walked into free territory,

100
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:30,260
you were free and you could not
be returned to a state of bondage.

101
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:34,220
This was a well known
legal argument and in fact,

102
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:36,140
dred Scott won at a lower court.

103
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:40,970
So it goes all the way up to the Supreme
Court and the Supreme Court says,

104
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,090
no, you're still property. And the
chief justice of the Supreme Court,

105
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:48,020
Roger Tawny,

106
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:52,490
very famously, he says, the
black man has no rights,

107
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,520
that the white man is bound to respect
tawny in a amazingly broad decision,

108
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:03,110
not only slams the door
on dred Scott's freedom,

109
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:08,560
he slams the door on the potential for
any African American free or not free to

110
00:07:10,251 --> 00:07:13,700
ever have full citizenship
in this country.

111
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:17,660
And at that point in time at the
highest court of the land to make that

112
00:07:17,661 --> 00:07:18,494
decision.

113
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:23,530
That was putting a period on sort of
this overarching battle between um,

114
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:27,410
the north and the south. The for
slavery and the abolition is,

115
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,600
and so when this happens,

116
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,120
now you start seeing civil war popping up

117
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:42,750
[inaudible]

118
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:47,160
now as far as dred Scott, that case
is concerned, but speaking legally,

119
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:51,900
the 13th and 14th amendments did come
along and overturn it. But like that line,

120
00:07:51,901 --> 00:07:55,440
like the black man has no rights
that a white man is bound to respect.

121
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:59,160
Like you can't overturn that
line. And these days, you know,

122
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,040
as depending on swings
and we see a rise in

123
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:04,980
blatant,

124
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:09,980
overt white nationalism more than scream
does when people injured and violence

125
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:14,670
over statues. This car plowed into
a crowd of people. But that line

126
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,630
still hovers above us all.

127
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,530
But suppose you're a direct descendant
of that case, of that history.

128
00:08:31,531 --> 00:08:34,680
Suppose your name is Scott,
your last name is tawny.

129
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,710
What do you do with that particularly now?

130
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,940
Like what do you do with that
history? Do you ignore it?

131
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,970
Is it not your problem or do you
address it? And if you do, how

132
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:55,530
coming up next after the break we walk
into a hotel lobby in St Louis and get an

133
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:57,600

I answer your questions about what's
really happening in Washington.

140
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:44,300
I wonder if it is legal for president
Trump to initiate north hairy action

141
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,650
against North Korea. What
happens if Mueller returns?

142
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,810
I'm indictment again, the president.

143
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,070

Now we come to the reunion as she was
reporting this story producer Julia

147
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,020
Longoria is doing a little googling,

148
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,370
located a couple of Scott
Tawny descendants and then
found out that they were

149
00:10:19,371 --> 00:10:24,371
actually planning to meet up to
have this kind of historic summit,

150
00:10:26,210 --> 00:10:28,220
which was like, we thought it was bananas.

151
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,700
So she went and it was bananas.

152
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,230
And as soon as she came back she sat
down in the studio and told Elly Ms Doll

153
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:39,350
and I all about it. Um, so where to start?

154
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:47,260
[inaudible] so I locked into this
Hilton Frontenac hotel in St Louis?

155
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,560
No, your classic hotel atrium.

156
00:10:51,561 --> 00:10:55,730
With like a very weird
carpet pattern like,

157
00:10:55,820 --> 00:11:00,050
and I walk in and it's like, oh, drove
in or you, it's almost like a conference

158
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:04,910
and I'm greeted by the great,

159
00:11:04,911 --> 00:11:09,740
great granddaughter of Dred Scott. Wow.
And uh, yeah, it's just amazing. I mean,

160
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,640
literally this is our inaugural sons
and daughters of reconciliation events.

161
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,810
Names Lynn Jackson.
She's the main organizer.

162
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,690
This was always a dream that I
had about 12 years ago. There's,

163
00:11:20,691 --> 00:11:22,850
I couldn't meet other descendants.
Wouldn't that be cool?

164
00:11:23,090 --> 00:11:25,940
Then she immediately tells me,
I'm a networker. I'm a networker.

165
00:11:25,970 --> 00:11:29,750
I'm going to connect you with everyone
here. That's what I like doing.

166
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:31,220
And this is a blow family right here.

167
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,270
And immediately she introduces me to
these three people. What's your name?

168
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,860
Mimi laboratoire.

169
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:41,510
John Lavar Schwab mashed in the bourgeois
one who are descendants of the blow

170
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:45,500
family, the first family who
owned her. Great. Great Grandpa.

171
00:11:45,650 --> 00:11:49,290
Here's some more fun gas.
Hello guys. Come on in.

172
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:53,950
She also introduced me to the
great, great, great, great, great.

173
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:58,330
Sixth grade grandson. Thomas Jefferson.
Yeah. Grandson of Thomas Jefferson.

174
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:01,900
I met, what's your name?
I'm Bertram Hayes Davis.

175
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,300
Hyphenate at descendant
of Jefferson Davis.

176
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:09,130
You know the guy who led the confederacy
against the union in the civil war and

177
00:12:09,131 --> 00:12:12,190
everybody's hugging and laughing.

178
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:14,860
It was wild. Almost like,

179
00:12:14,861 --> 00:12:19,780
it sounds like almost like a
meaning of the Utopian society. Yes,

180
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:24,460
exactly. And the whole idea, everyone
kind of wanted reconciliation,

181
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:27,430
reconciliation, reconciliation.
That was like the word of the day,

182
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:29,470
reconciliation,
reconciliation. So the nation,

183
00:12:29,471 --> 00:12:31,660
I think they got a lot of the
country needs that now. You know,

184
00:12:31,661 --> 00:12:36,370
so I think a lot of people here and so
I'm wandering around and reading these

185
00:12:36,371 --> 00:12:38,920
people, like going up, shaking
hands with random people.

186
00:12:39,010 --> 00:12:43,360
And then I meet this one guy,
Scott Madison. Lynn introduced us.

187
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,240
Oh yes, your name dread
Madison. I'm the great,

188
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:48,250
great grandson of dread and Harry Scott.

189
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,790
And I look in his eyes and I was like,

190
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,920
Holy Shit. Those are dred Scott's eyes.

191
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:58,641
I mean,

192
00:12:58,641 --> 00:13:03,110
there's really only one picture of dred
Scott that exists and it's from around

193
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:08,111
1857 he's wearing a suit staring straight
at the camera and his eyes are like

194
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,490
almost glassy. Ms Pupils are
really big. And it's just striking.

195
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,630
I felt like I was looking
bright into those same eyes.

196
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,550
And have you always known that you're
related to dread Scott? I imagine? Yes.

197
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,770
And what, what's your relationship
to that history? What do you,

198
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,070
when you think about it, what
do you, what do you feel?

199
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:34,310
I have mixed feelings
based on what [inaudible]

200
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,980
chief justice tardy said and
the decision they made. A,

201
00:13:37,010 --> 00:13:39,440
you are subhuman species
with no rights, a whiteness

202
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:43,370
boundary respect. Blacks have no rights
that white men are bound to respect.

203
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,650
That still resonates today in my opinion.

204
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:49,560
[inaudible]

205
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,660
what really hit me the hardest, and I,

206
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,110
I it's hard meeting with
think about this cause it,

207
00:13:54,111 --> 00:13:58,880
it just bothers me was the
Trayvon Martin right on the line,

208
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,040
a teenager was shot
down by one name or one,

209
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:06,510
one self defense. This kid was walking
home from school, from a store,

210
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:10,650
wasn't bothering, wasn't breaking any
laws. Someone decided to follow him,

211
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:15,720
pull up on him and he ended up
murdering him. That guy parked his car,

212
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:16,770
got out of his car,

213
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,690
invaded the show me a space and murdered
him and used to stand your ground law.

214
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:26,190
And that's a perfect example
of Ma, your ground is yours.

215
00:14:26,191 --> 00:14:27,450
Until I decided it's not.

216
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:32,700
I meet dread just as he is about to
shake hands for the first time with the

217
00:14:32,701 --> 00:14:36,120
family who owned his family. A whole lot
of stuff that goes through your mind.

218
00:14:36,121 --> 00:14:38,220
Are they going to be, are
they going to be buddy heads?

219
00:14:38,221 --> 00:14:41,870
I think arrogance did that all
go through your head, but you,

220
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:43,650
you know you have to approach people.

221
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,810
You have to approach
people for who they are.

222
00:14:46,030 --> 00:14:49,740
You've got to have open mind and one of
the most striking things I learned from

223
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,090
dread Scott Junior, junior and
also from my sister Barbara,

224
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,240
I'm Barbara McGregory,
I'm dread. Scott's great,

225
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,790
great granddaughter is that the dred
Scott history was actually something that

226
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,290
was kind of kept from them.

227
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:04,400
It was hush hush thing because
the dred Scott decision,

228
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:06,380
I don't know if you are
understanding what that was,

229
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:10,520
that that was the last straw that
sparked the civil war. My Dad,

230
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,060
when they were growing up,
they had death strips, right?

231
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,520
So they couldn't tell anybody who
they were related to your dad.

232
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,630
That generation.

233
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,320
This was like a hundred years after the
decision that generation had to keep it

234
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:24,770
a secret. That's his great
grandfather. His grandmother was dread.

235
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,560
Scott's daughter, great
dread junior. Junior,

236
00:15:27,561 --> 00:15:32,561
junior told me that his dad was
actually partially raised by dread.

237
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:35,780
Scott's daughter, Lizzy,
whose name was Lizzie,

238
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,160
try to hide the fact. In
fact, someone told me she was,

239
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,920
she might've been kind
of mad when, um, my, uh,

240
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,160
grandfather and grandmother named my
father dred Scott because she was in

241
00:15:44,161 --> 00:15:48,450
hiding. You gotta remember when
she was, uh, six years old.

242
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,480
They wouldn't hiding for five years
during the trial earner sister because the

243
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:57,090
whole basis of trial was he
didn't want his family split up.

244
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,490
So when he lost the second appeal,

245
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,050
he sent the girls into hiding because
he didn't want them sold away.

246
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:08,320
So Lizzy stayed pretty much undercover.

247
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:13,680
She lived in a, a little, little room,
but she always had the shades close,

248
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:18,400
so dread. And Barbara told me their
parents never talked about dred Scott.

249
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,080
They never had a picture up in the house.

250
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:22,960
They never even knew what he looked like.

251
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:29,870
In fact, as we were standing there
in the lobby of the Hilton, dread,

252
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:34,550
pulls out his phone photos
of dred Scott. Okay.

253
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:38,630
Pictures of dred Scott. And he
brings up the photo on Google.

254
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:45,140
That's the actual photographs. That's
the actual photograph, which looks,

255
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:48,560
let's see. Looks like this. That's
it. Yeah. So can you describe it?

256
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:54,040
Uh, really dark eyes.
Um, he's wearing a suit.

257
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:59,560
Like he was impressed, I think. Like you
wouldn't expect a slave to be dressed.

258
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:02,860
So Nice. Wait, is that the first time
you've seen the picture of dred Scott? No,

259
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:03,910
it's not the first time,

260
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,930
but it seemed like he was noticing
things in it for the first time.

261
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:11,980
It looks really dignified and stern
in that picture, but he looks,

262
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:15,220
he looks like a man who's going through
it and is ready to go through some more.

263
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:17,363
He does.

264
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:26,033
[inaudible]

265
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:37,670
[inaudible] she has to have a
separate project. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

266
00:17:37,671 --> 00:17:42,110
So at the end of the night, I ended up
at the hotel bar with another descendant,

267
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:46,280
so I let her answer that.

268
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:50,040
Uh, no, I think you should answer that. So

269
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,620
the dred Scott Case is a famous supreme
court case and the chief justice who

270
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:59,370
ruled in that case was named
Roger Protonix. And so I'm a tiny

271
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:04,700
Charlie Tani is the great, great
grand nephew of Roger Brooke. Tony,

272
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,010
who is the chief justice who basically
denied dred Scott his freedom, right?

273
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:14,270
He's kind of a tall guy. White hair. I'll
take one more topic. Okay. Glasses on.

274
00:18:14,271 --> 00:18:15,650
Tip of his nose. You know,

275
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:20,651
we had an 11 about original copy of that
decision and he was actually sitting

276
00:18:22,731 --> 00:18:26,750
next to three descendants from the
family who originally owned dread Scott.

277
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,730
They were like, come join us.

278
00:18:28,731 --> 00:18:33,731
And so to my left is the descendant of
the people who own dread Scott into my

279
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:37,390
right are the people who
kept dred Scott and slaved,

280
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,720
are you not going to eat one of those?

281
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,490
And they were all just like
having gin and tonics and crap.

282
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,840
Kate's outlet strategy.

283
00:18:44,841 --> 00:18:49,460
Remember that father
says you have never dad.

284
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:54,380
It's not even as packs.
That's great. Can you,

285
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,200
can you describe the first
images you saw of Tony?

286
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:01,130
Eventually I steer the conversation
back to Charlie. Tanya's ancestor,

287
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,100
Roger Tawny. The Supreme Court
justice? Well, we had, we had, uh,

288
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,610
we have pictures of them hanging on
our hat on. I grew up in the house.

289
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:11,820
It was up on the wall and it had, I
remember it had this a light over it,

290
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,720
unlike the dread Scott family,
Charlie Tawny and his daughter Kate,

291
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:19,830
Kate Tani Billingsley grew up knowing
exactly what Roger looks like.

292
00:19:19,831 --> 00:19:24,690
His skin flapped over and
he had these long jowls,

293
00:19:24,691 --> 00:19:27,450
but he was also a thin
man. He was very sickly.

294
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,980
That's something I really recall.
He looks like, um, spooked me.

295
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,460
That shriveled up little, okay

296
00:19:33,510 --> 00:19:36,920
man who lives up in the house on the
hill that hardly ever comes out of his

297
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:41,500
house. And all the kids are scared
of you grew up, man, you know,

298
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:45,770
in the once the first time you study the
civil war, probably like fifth grade,

299
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:46,993
sixth grade,

300
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:50,480
and you're like sliding down in your
seat when they get to the dred Scott

301
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:53,120
decision because you know, this is
really terrible. And that's my family.

302
00:19:53,121 --> 00:19:56,390
And I'm like, God, they did that. So
that you're very aware of it. Yeah.

303
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,810
And we're also, I mean, and we're
also, you know, while while you're, um,

304
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:03,320
well that's a black mark on our family.

305
00:20:03,470 --> 00:20:07,760
He also ran one of the most productive
courts and it was during a time of

306
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:09,290
explosive growth in the country.

307
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,400
So we're very proud of his
role and helping form America.

308
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,380
What he's known for is the single worst
decision ever made by the Supreme Court.

309
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:24,160
If you're a family member,
it's, it's, um, a little,

310
00:20:24,190 --> 00:20:26,170
a little difficult to have
that be the only focus

311
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,410
fully sitting there.

312
00:20:29,411 --> 00:20:33,070
It was pretty clear that Charlie Tawny
was kind of like dread. Scott Madison.

313
00:20:33,130 --> 00:20:35,050
He also had some mixed feelings.

314
00:20:35,430 --> 00:20:38,420
Well, having read, having read a
number of his letters, I, you know,

315
00:20:38,421 --> 00:20:40,640
I think he was, I think, you know, he,

316
00:20:40,641 --> 00:20:44,870
I think he really loved his wife and his
family and I think he was a very loving

317
00:20:44,871 --> 00:20:48,010
father and he was against
slavery is pretty clear.

318
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:49,840
He thought it was a blot
on the national character.

319
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:55,120
He thought slavery was wrong. Are
we talking about tiny still? Yeah.

320
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:58,360
He, yeah, he felt it was wrong and
should eventually be just done away with.

321
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:00,760
He told me that in one
of his legal arguments,

322
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,840
tawny totally railed against
slave drivers. He said
something to the effect of,

323
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,880
uh, these people are reptiles who deal
in the trafficking of human flesh.

324
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:11,990
Sitting there,

325
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:16,990
Charlie tells me that Roger Tawny
was trying to save the Union,

326
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:23,320
that somehow if he ruled that America
was a slave ocracy once and for all

327
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,020
really, that might somehow
delay the civil war

328
00:21:27,140 --> 00:21:30,950
and he was trying to solve the issue of
slavery in America. That might be true,

329
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,140
but you can't look for, look yes.

330
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:37,970
When you read that language
that he was a stone racist,

331
00:21:37,971 --> 00:21:38,804
I mean just was,

332
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,940
and um, and I asked them like,

333
00:21:44,030 --> 00:21:48,170
when you met the Scott's like, what
did you feel like, what did you,

334
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,560
did you feel like you wanted to
communicate something to them?

335
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,930
And the blow descendant, you know,

336
00:21:53,931 --> 00:21:58,810
the family who originally
owned dred Scott said, yeah,

337
00:21:58,820 --> 00:22:02,180
like we're sorry. And I
was like, have you ever,

338
00:22:02,210 --> 00:22:05,510
I turned to Tanya and said like,
have you ever actually apologized?

339
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,250
And he was like, I don't know.

340
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:11,470
I don't know if I ever use those words.
I don't recall ever using those words.

341
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,433
[inaudible]

342
00:22:20,650 --> 00:22:21,730
[inaudible] next day.

343
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,540
Well, welcome to the drags car
reconciliation forum. I know,

344
00:22:25,541 --> 00:22:27,760
well these two at the forum,

345
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:32,790
about a hundred people crammed into
the grand ballroom of the Hilton and a

346
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,340
preacher, so to forget into
median today in our proceedings,

347
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,350
I'd like to ask if you'd stand with me
and go to the Lord repaired the blessed

348
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:44,950
these proceedings today. Let the
group in prayer. Heavenly father,

349
00:22:44,951 --> 00:22:49,030
we come to you this day seeking your
blessings in this room and we ask,

350
00:22:49,031 --> 00:22:53,710
Lord that this reconciliation would
begin today in a profound way each of our

351
00:22:53,711 --> 00:22:57,250
hearts as we learn from our
past to move to our future

352
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:02,250
Les Esis Day and board, we give
you praise. In Jesus name we pray.

353
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,980
Amen. You may be, see at this time,

354
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:11,820
we would like for all of
the descendants if you will,

355
00:23:11,821 --> 00:23:15,630
to please just stand with these
descendants. Get up on stage.

356
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:18,120
Thank you and good morning everyone
one by one. I'm so happy to be here.

357
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:21,270
As part of the reconciliation conference
and they keep like a little schpiel

358
00:23:21,271 --> 00:23:23,260
about, oh, thank you so much. Thank you.

359
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,770
They are what reconciliation
means to them.

360
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,860
And a lot of people don't know
the Thomas Jefferson's wife.

361
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:31,770
Martha is the half sister of Sally Hemet.

362
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:34,470
Things you might not know about
their ancestors. They had,

363
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,420
they had the same father John Wells.

364
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,050
After about five people had spoken.
Please welcome Charlie for the stage.

365
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,010
Charlie Tani got up to talk morning. So

366
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:50,240
the first thing I like to do is tell
you all how glad I am to be here.

367
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:55,610
Real honor and privilege to be here. So
let me start with Roger Burke. Tonya,

368
00:23:55,611 --> 00:23:59,720
what it was like to grow up as somebody
to grow up as a tawny in terms of how we

369
00:23:59,721 --> 00:24:01,880
feel about him. It's a
real, it's a mixed bag.

370
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:06,430
It's a very mixed thing because
on the one hand, as a tiny,

371
00:24:06,431 --> 00:24:07,730
you're proud of him.

372
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,830
He was one of the longest serving
chief justices, the Bible.

373
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:14,060
He swore Lincoln and with,

374
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,400
it's the same Bible that
President Obama was sworn in on.

375
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,290
However, that's not what he's known for.

376
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:25,450
What he's known for is one thing he's
done for the dred Scott decision.

377
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:30,590
And just so we all want
to get a handle on that.

378
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:34,740
Let me read you a sentence that he wrote

379
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:40,970
was his opinion at the
time of the constitution

380
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:44,500
that African-Americans,

381
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:49,000
here's the quote for more than a
century had been regarded as beans of an

382
00:24:49,001 --> 00:24:50,020
inferior ordering

383
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:58,650
unfit to associate with white,

384
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:01,620
the right race so far inferior.

385
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,000
They had no rights, which the
white man was bound to respect.

386
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,800
So you might be proud of him

387
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:22,940
but you can't talk that
you can talk about.

388
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:29,790
So, uh, I looked up reconciliation,

389
00:25:30,890 --> 00:25:34,230
I lift up this morning the
process of reconciliation

390
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:39,300
and there are three steps.
The first step is apology.

391
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,690
The second step is forgiveness.

392
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:48,000
And the third step is a new
trust. It grows out of that.

393
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,640
But some, someone asks Kate about this
issue, apology. And what Kate said was,

394
00:25:53,641 --> 00:25:57,720
my daughter said, well, she
said, you know, autonomy,

395
00:25:57,750 --> 00:26:02,460
bringing an apology to a Scott is like
bringing a bandaid to an amputation.

396
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,310
It just, it is not
enough. But he was like,

397
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,930
you got to start somewhere. So let's let
them, let's make a little history today

398
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,880
on the tonics. So all the scotch

399
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:22,420
you have our apologies. Nope.

400
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:38,520
[inaudible] [inaudible]

401
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:43,410
I spoke to Scott descendants afterwards.
How was that? What did you of that?

402
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:44,220
I'm still

403
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,270
emotion. Very much more emotional
than I thought. That's great.

404
00:26:48,271 --> 00:26:51,930
Great granddaughter, Barbara
Gregory. No one's ever apologize.

405
00:26:52,170 --> 00:26:56,040
Clinton made an apology some years ago,

406
00:26:56,670 --> 00:26:59,430
but coming from him didn't mean much.

407
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:04,460
But here when tawny got emotional,

408
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,420
when he was reading that letters,

409
00:27:06,930 --> 00:27:10,920
that was more heartfelt
to me than anything else.

410
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,670
The apology was okay, but, but
his emotion really touched me.

411
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,610
Barbara, that dred Scott
descendant was like

412
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,590
when he choked up reading
that I could feel that like,

413
00:27:20,591 --> 00:27:23,350
that felt like healing.

414
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:26,440
You're doing hello.

415
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,520
Then I pull aside her brother and I
ask you what you're thinking about.

416
00:27:30,521 --> 00:27:35,140
How did you respond to all of that? Dread,
Scott Madison, the one with the eyes,

417
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,370
everything was fine. It's just,
ah, to be honest, the last part,

418
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,180
pupil was Catholic. Uh, I didn't like it.

419
00:27:43,930 --> 00:27:45,970
I don't think somebody should
have to apologize for something.

420
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:49,270
They didn't do this. I just,

421
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,310
I was very uncomfortable with that.

422
00:27:53,350 --> 00:27:55,270
That's the fact that they're here.

423
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:59,440
Is apology enough apologizing
for something your ancestor did?

424
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,040
You're part of a gene pool. Usually
you're judged by your works,

425
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:07,480
not someone else's. Show me that you care.

426
00:28:07,481 --> 00:28:11,590
Don't tell me that you're sorry. Tell
me that you're going to do better.

427
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:14,443
That's the only

428
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,320
couple of final notes. When we
talked to dread Scott Madison later,

429
00:28:24,321 --> 00:28:28,940
he was pretty clear that like Charlie
Tawny is already doing a lot of good.

430
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:31,910
He's helping the dred Scott
Foundation to raise money.

431
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:36,940
That's why he felt the trail. He
didn't need to apologize. Also,

432
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,170
when we started the story,

433
00:28:38,171 --> 00:28:43,120
there were statues of Roger Book
Tawny in Annapolis and in Baltimore,

434
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:44,410
both in front of courthouses.

435
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:48,850
This is actually how the town is and
Scott's one of the first ways that they'd

436
00:28:48,851 --> 00:28:49,421
come together.

437
00:28:49,421 --> 00:28:54,421
They had decided collectively on a plan
to amend those two statues rather than

438
00:28:54,731 --> 00:28:55,564
take them down.

439
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:01,200
They had decided to put a dread Scott
statue next to them that had been the

440
00:29:01,211 --> 00:29:05,650
plan. They'd been working on it.
They had met with politicians.

441
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,450
They've met with the mayor of Baltimore,

442
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,760
but then as we were
finishing up the story,

443
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:16,290
good morning, Maryland begins now with
breaking news. Charlottesville happened,

444
00:29:17,690 --> 00:29:18,870
and in the wake of Charlottesville,

445
00:29:19,050 --> 00:29:21,900
and we certainly do have some breaking
news that's more than Roger Brooke Tawny

446
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:26,340
statue is no longer standing outside
the Maryland State House in Annapolis.

447
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,810
It's the latest dementia of a pro
slavery icon to come down in the wake of

448
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:34,090
violent racial clashes in
Charlottesville, Virginia. Yes.

449
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,110
Both statutes were taken
down in the same, yeah,

450
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:39,860
it was really, it was really
weird out here, I have to say,

451
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:43,150
in about 25 to people out
here, here's what happened.

452
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:46,780
They started the rope off the street
and then at 1220 they started and they

453
00:29:46,781 --> 00:29:48,130
hoisted tawny up.

454
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:53,260
There was a golf clam when Tawney came
off the pedestal here and was removed.

455
00:29:53,261 --> 00:29:56,980
But other than that, everybody was
quiet. Nobody had an opinion on this.

456
00:29:56,981 --> 00:29:58,900
And if they did, they
kept it to themselves.

457
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,380
Heart and 45 year history gone here
tonight, and I'll get out of the way.

458
00:30:02,590 --> 00:30:05,830
This is all this left. This
is the pedestal that is left

459
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:25,753
[inaudible],

460
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:30,270
Eh,

461
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,483
[inaudible] [inaudible]

462
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:50,990
oh, Yay.

463
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:57,940
[inaudible] more perfect is produced
by me. Jad Abumrad, Susie Lichtenberg,
