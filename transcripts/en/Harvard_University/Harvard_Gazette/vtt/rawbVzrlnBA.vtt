00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.160
It's taken me a long time to think of myself as a writer.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.160
I first turned to writing as a way of

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.780
representing El Salvador as I
knew it,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.780
my parents homeland, a beautiful country
full of stories,

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.160
the home to abuelita's farm.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.380
Like many immigrant parents, my
parents really valued education

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.620
but I'd never really thought about life in
college. Let alone Harvard.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.200
My cousin's in El Salvador aren't even able to go to school every day.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.220
At Harvard, I have early endless resources.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.060
People often
think of writing as a lonely endeavor

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.020
but for me writing has always been about
being conversation with others.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.700
I've learned here that writing is stronger
when it's rooted in a sense of community

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.219
that's how my writing led me to
classmates with similar pride in being

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.960
immigrants or the children of immigrants.
It was the inspiration for Palabritas,

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.640
a latin ex literary publication i
co-founded this past semester.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.480
If you write, you're a writer

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.640
I hope that being
published in Palabritas helps people

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.360
especially those who have never shared
their work begin to call themselves writers.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.400
My dream is to build a career as
a writer and an educator.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.300
When I'm finishing a book manuscript, I know I won't be doing it alone.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.840
It'll be on abuelita Carmen's farm

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.960
in El Salvador, a place of story

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.080
in the homeland of so many of the people

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:28.460
who've gotten me where I am today.
