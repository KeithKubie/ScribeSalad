00:09:50.589 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
and yeah it's a kind of a cold wind and
for<00:09:51.589><c> me</c><00:09:51.770><c> as</c><00:09:51.950><c> a</c><00:09:51.980><c> photograph</c><00:09:52.550><c> I</c><00:09:52.700><c> it</c><00:09:52.760><c> was</c><00:09:52.970><c> always</c>

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:53.210 align:start position:0%
for me as a photograph I it was always
 

00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:55.540 align:start position:0%
for me as a photograph I it was always
kind<00:09:53.630><c> of</c><00:09:53.839><c> tricky</c><00:09:54.230><c> to</c><00:09:54.260><c> have</c><00:09:54.620><c> to</c><00:09:54.920><c> deal</c><00:09:55.130><c> with</c><00:09:55.190><c> so</c>

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:55.550 align:start position:0%
kind of tricky to have to deal with so
 

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
kind of tricky to have to deal with so
much<00:09:55.730><c> fog</c><00:09:56.120><c> I</c><00:09:56.390><c> didn't</c><00:09:57.050><c> reckon</c><00:09:57.380><c> with</c><00:09:57.589><c> that</c><00:09:57.830><c> and</c>

00:09:58.800 --> 00:09:58.810 align:start position:0%
much fog I didn't reckon with that and
 

00:09:58.810 --> 00:10:01.870 align:start position:0%
much fog I didn't reckon with that and
yeah<00:09:59.810><c> I</c><00:09:59.839><c> had</c><00:10:00.140><c> to</c><00:10:00.350><c> somehow</c><00:10:00.950><c> live</c><00:10:01.490><c> with</c><00:10:01.700><c> that</c>

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I had to somehow live with that
 

00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:04.090 align:start position:0%
yeah I had to somehow live with that
because<00:10:02.270><c> they</c><00:10:02.780><c> always</c><00:10:02.960><c> always</c><00:10:03.350><c> some</c><00:10:03.589><c> sort</c><00:10:03.860><c> of</c>

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:04.100 align:start position:0%
because they always always some sort of
 

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.150 align:start position:0%
because they always always some sort of

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.160 align:start position:0%

00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:10.570 align:start position:0%

and<00:11:46.910><c> it's</c><00:11:47.980><c> difficult</c><00:11:48.980><c> to</c><00:11:49.160><c> put</c><00:11:49.580><c> that</c><00:11:49.790><c> in</c><00:11:49.970><c> scale</c>

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:51.790 align:start position:0%
and it's difficult to put that in scale
 

00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:55.720 align:start position:0%
and it's difficult to put that in scale
so<00:11:52.790><c> now</c><00:11:53.000><c> I</c><00:11:53.690><c> change</c><00:11:54.350><c> the</c><00:11:54.410><c> position</c><00:11:54.710><c> to</c><00:11:55.310><c> exactly</c>

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:55.730 align:start position:0%
so now I change the position to exactly
 

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.970 align:start position:0%
so now I change the position to exactly
where<00:11:55.940><c> that</c><00:11:56.150><c> man</c><00:11:56.420><c> stand</c><00:11:56.870><c> and</c><00:11:57.200><c> we</c><00:11:57.380><c> see</c><00:11:57.710><c> in</c><00:11:57.890><c> the</c>

00:11:57.970 --> 00:11:57.980 align:start position:0%
where that man stand and we see in the
 

00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
where that man stand and we see in the
back<00:11:58.280><c> far</c><00:11:58.760><c> these</c><00:11:59.830><c> little</c><00:12:00.830><c> stalls</c><00:12:01.190><c> but</c><00:12:01.580><c> these</c>

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:01.850 align:start position:0%
back far these little stalls but these
 

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:04.060 align:start position:0%
back far these little stalls but these
are<00:12:02.120><c> the</c><00:12:02.300><c> big</c><00:12:02.450><c> ones</c><00:12:02.780><c> we</c><00:12:03.050><c> have</c><00:12:03.230><c> seen</c><00:12:03.500><c> in</c><00:12:03.680><c> just</c><00:12:03.920><c> in</c>

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:04.070 align:start position:0%
are the big ones we have seen in just in
 

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:07.870 align:start position:0%
are the big ones we have seen in just in
the<00:12:04.160><c> last</c><00:12:04.370><c> frame</c><00:12:04.790><c> so</c><00:12:05.600><c> it</c><00:12:06.560><c> just</c><00:12:07.010><c> gives</c><00:12:07.280><c> you</c><00:12:07.520><c> an</c>

00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:07.880 align:start position:0%
the last frame so it just gives you an
 

00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
the last frame so it just gives you an

00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:12.770 align:start position:0%
idea how big these rooms are and that is
 

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:16.660 align:start position:0%
idea how big these rooms are and that is
half<00:12:13.160><c> a</c><00:12:13.339><c> mile</c><00:12:13.630><c> to</c><00:12:14.630><c> these</c><00:12:14.839><c> big</c><00:12:15.200><c> stars</c><00:12:15.560><c> and</c><00:12:15.950><c> we</c>

half a mile to these big stars and we
 

00:12:16.670 --> 00:12:19.390 align:start position:0%
half a mile to these big stars and we

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:19.400 align:start position:0%
needed like 14 people to light this
 

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:23.350 align:start position:0%
needed like 14 people to light this
gallery<00:12:20.230><c> that</c><00:12:21.230><c> was</c><00:12:21.410><c> very</c><00:12:22.190><c> very</c><00:12:22.460><c> tricky</c><00:12:22.820><c> and</c><00:12:23.089><c> to</c>

gallery that was very very tricky and to

00:12:25.690 --> 00:12:25.700 align:start position:0%
lighting in that way that the fog
 

00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
lighting in that way that the fog
doesn't<00:12:26.000><c> reflect</c><00:12:26.420><c> the</c><00:12:26.720><c> light</c><00:12:26.900><c> so</c><00:12:27.320><c> it</c><00:12:27.560><c> was</c>

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:27.770 align:start position:0%
doesn't reflect the light so it was
 

00:12:27.770 --> 00:12:31.270 align:start position:0%
doesn't reflect the light so it was
pretty<00:12:28.670><c> challenging</c><00:12:28.970><c> to</c><00:12:29.570><c> to</c><00:12:30.560><c> make</c><00:12:30.740><c> that</c><00:12:30.950><c> shot</c>

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:31.280 align:start position:0%

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:34.360 align:start position:0%
and we had of course a lot of problems
 

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:37.150 align:start position:0%
and we had of course a lot of problems
also<00:12:35.360><c> in</c><00:12:35.600><c> terms</c><00:12:35.810><c> of</c><00:12:35.960><c> communication</c><00:12:36.830><c> with</c>

there were a lot of Vietnamese you can
 

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of Vietnamese you can

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:42.410 align:start position:0%
imagine what what it means to get that
 

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:47.980 align:start position:0%
imagine what what it means to get that

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
first sinkhole and it the the pictures
 

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.700 align:start position:0%
first sinkhole and it the the pictures
changed<00:13:04.970><c> from</c><00:13:05.210><c> the</c><00:13:05.570><c> natural</c><00:13:05.990><c> light</c><00:13:06.200><c> setting</c>

00:13:06.700 --> 00:13:06.710 align:start position:0%
changed from the natural light setting
 

00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
changed from the natural light setting
towards<00:13:07.730><c> a</c><00:13:08.060><c> little</c><00:13:08.720><c> artificial</c><00:13:09.730><c> ads</c><00:13:10.810><c> which</c>

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:11.810 align:start position:0%
towards a little artificial ads which
 

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:14.130 align:start position:0%
towards a little artificial ads which
which<00:13:12.170><c> shows</c><00:13:12.470><c> you</c><00:13:12.770><c> how</c><00:13:12.980><c> big</c><00:13:13.280><c> some</c><00:13:13.760><c> of</c><00:13:13.910><c> these</c>

00:13:14.130 --> 00:13:14.140 align:start position:0%
which shows you how big some of these
 

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.780 align:start position:0%
which shows you how big some of these
rocks<00:13:15.140><c> are</c><00:13:15.500><c> which</c><00:13:15.770><c> are</c><00:13:15.890><c> just</c><00:13:16.250><c> falling</c><00:13:16.640><c> from</c>

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:16.790 align:start position:0%
rocks are which are just falling from
 

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.450 align:start position:0%
rocks are which are just falling from
the<00:13:16.940><c> ceiling</c><00:13:17.180><c> yeah</c><00:13:17.600><c> they</c><00:13:18.110><c> are</c><00:13:18.290><c> several</c><00:13:18.980><c> storey</c>

00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:19.460 align:start position:0%
the ceiling yeah they are several storey
 

00:13:19.460 --> 00:13:21.430 align:start position:0%
the ceiling yeah they are several storey
buildings<00:13:20.150><c> which</c><00:13:20.420><c> just</c><00:13:20.720><c> fall</c><00:13:21.020><c> from</c><00:13:21.320><c> the</c>

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
buildings which just fall from the

00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:24.770 align:start position:0%
ceiling so these dimensions are really
 

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.030 align:start position:0%
ceiling so these dimensions are really
unbelievable<00:13:24.920><c> and</c><00:13:25.790><c> then</c><00:13:26.170><c> just</c><00:13:27.170><c> these</c><00:13:27.320><c> little</c>

00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
unbelievable and then just these little
 

00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
unbelievable and then just these little

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:30.890 align:start position:0%
stalls next to the person you you can
 

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:33.580 align:start position:0%

figure<00:13:31.130><c> out</c><00:13:31.250><c> how</c><00:13:31.640><c> big</c><00:13:31.940><c> it</c><00:13:32.090><c> is</c><00:13:32.210><c> and</c><00:13:32.990><c> then</c><00:13:33.380><c> there</c>

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:33.590 align:start position:0%
figure out how big it is and then there
 

00:13:33.590 --> 00:13:36.010 align:start position:0%
figure out how big it is and then there
was<00:13:33.740><c> something</c><00:13:34.190><c> very</c><00:13:34.220><c> very</c><00:13:34.820><c> strange</c><00:13:35.540><c> what</c><00:13:35.990><c> I</c>

00:13:36.010 --> 00:13:36.020 align:start position:0%
was something very very strange what I
 

00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:38.710 align:start position:0%
was something very very strange what I
have<00:13:36.230><c> never</c><00:13:36.470><c> seen</c><00:13:36.830><c> before</c><00:13:37.310><c> like</c><00:13:37.490><c> that</c><00:13:37.790><c> it's</c>

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
have never seen before like that it's
 

00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
have never seen before like that it's
it's<00:13:39.080><c> a</c><00:13:39.230><c> so-called</c><00:13:39.860><c> phyto</c><00:13:40.190><c> cost</c><00:13:40.640><c> and</c><00:13:41.120><c> these</c>

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:41.810 align:start position:0%
it's a so-called phyto cost and these
 

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:48.520 align:start position:0%
it's a so-called phyto cost and these
are<00:13:43.450><c> microorganisms</c><00:13:44.450><c> who</c><00:13:45.410><c> actively</c><00:13:47.530><c> yeah</c>

00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:48.530 align:start position:0%
are microorganisms who actively yeah
