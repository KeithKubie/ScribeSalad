1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,350
Right? So if you're Dana, you're like,
listen, look at Conor like getting ideas.

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,040
When they get this boatload of money,
we can't give them to fight.

3
00:00:08,170 --> 00:00:12,840
They have power. The sports
too hard. They won't do it. Hm.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,940
That's interesting. I know. So to keep, to
keep 'em hungry, we got to pay him this.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:20,820
It's so fucked up.
I'm not saying it's the right thing to do,

6
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:23,620
but I'm saying if your day,
and from his standpoint you're like,

7
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,670
when they get fat highly, they don't
fight way. They really think that way.

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,410
I don't think that's the case.

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,960
You don't think it's a side effect
of making boat loads of money.

10
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:33,300
But I think they try to make boatloads
of money cause it doesn't happen very

11
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:33,910
often.

12
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,460
It only happens with a Rhonda Rousey
or Conor McGregor or some gigantic huge

13
00:00:38,461 --> 00:00:42,510
star like a Nate Diaz. Did. You have to
be a gigantic from site. Yeah, but that's,

14
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:46,080
that's rare. There's so few of
those guys. There's so few of those.

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:50,370
The idea that you would try to pay
people less because you want to keep them

16
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:54,720
hungry. Because if they become giant
superstars and they're not hungry,

17
00:00:54,721 --> 00:00:57,580
then they stopped fighting. They were
not pay him more. So they had him.

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,110
What you're saying is pretend you're
not there, not giant superstars.

19
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,080
Even when they are know the
giant superstars still get paid,

20
00:01:04,081 --> 00:01:06,820
but they also have crazy
demands. They, they,

21
00:01:06,821 --> 00:01:08,310
they want to find who they want to fight.

22
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,870
They want to do it when
they want to do it.

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,950
And there's all sorts of jockeying
going on back and forth. I mean,

24
00:01:13,951 --> 00:01:17,580
I don't know what happened with
Nate Diaz and Dustin Poirier,

25
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:21,000
but they were supposed to
fight, let's fight. And then,
and Dustin got injured, but,

26
00:01:21,001 --> 00:01:24,900
so Nate was scheduled for a fight and
he's never pulled out of a fight that he's

27
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:26,470
been scheduled for as
far as I can remember.

28
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,370
He was going to fight that fight and
then went to an APP and that made other

29
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:30,840
offers. You just like, I'm good. Right?

30
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:35,040
But let's imagine that if Dustin poray
did not pull out of that fight, would,

31
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:38,460
if he did fight Nate Diaz and would,
if Nate Diaz beat him,

32
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:43,560
the Nate Diaz could very well have fought
Max Holloway maybe Saturday night. Yes.

33
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:47,110
Maybe. Maybe. Yeah. If you
paid them enough, it might
may be. I'm sure he would aid.

34
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:50,400
They might've decided to make that shit
happen, you know? And you know what?

35
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,520
I bet it would have been. Yeah, that
was it. That was the face to face off.

36
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:58,200
I bet out would've been a very
entertaining fight to God. Oh my God.

37
00:01:58,201 --> 00:02:03,201
Acts and Nate Diaz with both Simon's
insane cardio insane volume striking.

38
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,190
That would be an incredible fight,
man. Fuck. That would be a great fun.

39
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,000
That'd be a great fight. Yeah. Max
and Nick would have been insane,

40
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,500
but Max was going to fight Dustin
Poirier and you know, he could be looked.

41
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:18,780
That'll be a big fight. Dustin
Poirier. If he doesn't fight Khabib,

42
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:22,620
if for whatever reason they decide to
go with Nate over could be, they're not,

43
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:26,410
they're going to do, could be
next. Yeah, in September. Wow.

44
00:02:26,411 --> 00:02:30,660
Maybe could be fights the winter
or the winter, rather fights Nate.

45
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,260
That could be possible too.
If he really still weren't Tony Ferguson,

46
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,520
Tony Ferguson.
