00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.780
 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.410
Cases like Cablevision, in
which the parties struggle over

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.710
whether what the defendant has
produced constitutes a copy, are rare.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.580
Much more common are cases in
which the parties struggle over

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.420
whether the character
and amount of material

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.600
copied by the defendant from
the plaintiff's work rise

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.790
to the level necessary to
constitute infringement.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.620
Once again, the burden
is on the plaintiff.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.430
The plaintiff must
show not only, as we've

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.220
seen, that the defendant copied from
the plaintiff's copyrighted work,

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:48.810
but also that the copying,
assuming it to be proved,

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.825
went so far as to constitute
improper appropriation.

00:00:51.825 --> 00:00:54.340
 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.290
There are three more or less discreet
ways in which the plaintiff can do so.

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.380
First, he could show
that the defendant made

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:04.230
a verbatim copy of his entire work.

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:09.280
This is what Melville Nimmer helpfully
refers to as comprehensive copying.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.500
This happens more often
than you might think.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.550
Examples include peer to peer
sharing of sound recordings

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.980
and the comprehensive replication
of digital copies of films

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:24.440
that were at issue in the Cablevision
case, which we just discussed.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.090
So long as the plaintiff's work
qualifies for copyright protection,

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:31.280
applying the standards we
discussed in the first lecture,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.820
comprehensive copying
of this sort easily

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.266
gives rise to a violation
of section 106(1).

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:39.200
 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.590
Things get a bit more complicated when
what the defendant has copied verbatim

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:50.120
is not the entire work but a piece
or slice of the plaintiff's work.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:54.000
Nimmer refers to this as, quote,
"fragmented literal similarity,"

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.420
close quote.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.110
An example can be found in this lecture.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.960
You'll recall that I illustrated the
principle of subconscious copying

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.260
by playing for you a segment of the
Chiffons recording of Donald Mack's

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.550
composition "He's So Fine."

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.130
In order to enable you
to hear that recording,

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.970
I had to create a copy of that segment
in the recording of this lecture, which

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.550
you are now watching and listening to.

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:22.770
I did not copy the entire song.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.530
So I've not engaged in
comprehensive copying.

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.895
Instead, I copied a
piece of it, specifically

00:02:27.895 --> 00:02:32.670
a piece long enough for you to assess
the plausibility of the court's

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.880
conclusion that George Harrison had
innocently copied Mack's composition.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.200
Thus I have engaged in, quote,
"fragmented literal copying,"

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.470
both of Mack's composition
and of the Chiffons sound

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.320
recording of that composition.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.070
 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.010
To prevail in a fragmented
literal similarity case,

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.770
the plaintiff must show
two things in addition,

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.530
as we've seen, to the fact of copying.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.690
First, he must show that
the slice the defendant took

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.390
includes some copyrightable
expression, not merely ideas or facts.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.510
All the factors we discussed
in lecture number one

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.700
concerning the idea-expression
distinction become relevant here.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.060
For example, if the
slice the defendant took

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.970
consists of a sentence that is the
only effective way of conveying

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.180
a particular idea, then
pursuant to the merger doctrine,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.660
the taking of that sentence does not
constitute a copyright infringement.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.467
Can I escape liability on this basis
for copying a slice of "He's So Fine"?

00:03:36.467 --> 00:03:41.025
No, there's plenty of copyrightable
expression in the 30 second slice

00:03:41.025 --> 00:03:44.490
that I appropriated.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.720
Second, the plaintiff must show that
the slice that the defendant took

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.620
is big enough.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.470
How big is that?

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.470
The adjective most often used
by the courts is substantial.

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:01.850
The portion taken must be a substantial
part of the plaintiff's work measured

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:05.180
both qualitatively and quantitatively.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.015
Relatively small slices have been deemed
sufficient to pass this test provided

00:04:10.015 --> 00:04:14.080
that they're sufficiently important
to the plaintiff's creation.

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:20.589
For example, in the 1980 Iowa State
research case, the defendant, ABC,

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:23.530
broadcast as part of its
coverage of the Olympics

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.250
two brief excerpts from the
plaintiff's documentary film

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:29.720
examining the life of a wrestler.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.270
One expert was 2 and 1/2 minutes
long, the other 12 seconds.

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.470
In the judgment of the Second
Circuit, that was plenty.

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:43.580
A willingness to find liability upon
the taking of relatively small excerpts

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.090
is not limited to the United States.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.400
For example, the courts
in Australia have

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.650
proven to be similarly
protective of plaintiffs.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:56.270
In a recent high profile
case, the plaintiff

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:00.470
owned the copyright of "Kookaburra,"
a nursery rhyme originally written

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.410
by Marion Sinclair in 1932.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:07.160
It was popular in Australia for decades.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:12.380
And indeed, I can remember my mother
singing it to me in the United States.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.480
The key segment of the
song goes like this.

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.190
I'm going to do my best here.

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:28.640
[MUSIC - "KOOKABURRA"] My
apologies to Ms. Sinclair.

00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:33.390
In the late 1970s, the
Australian rock group Men at Work

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.870
composed and recorded an equally
famous, perhaps more famous,

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.430
song called "Down Under."

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.450
I'm going to play a short
passage of that song.

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.694
Listen carefully for the flute
riff that comes near the end.

00:05:46.694 --> 00:05:51.167
[MUSIC - MEN AT WORK, "DOWN UNDER"]

00:05:51.167 --> 00:06:13.070
 

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:17.490
The same riff appears several
other times in "Down Under,"

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:20.710
and each time is equally short.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.240
George Ham, one of the members of Men
at Work, added this riff to the song

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.400
in order to inject some, quote
"Australian flavor," close quote,

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.340
into it.

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.520
In the ensuing copyright litigation, Ham
testified that, like George Harrison,

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.920
he was not aware that he was lifting
this segment from "Kookaburra."

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.810
Somewhat more specifically, here's how
Judge Jacobson, who oversaw this case,

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.740
summarized Ham's affidavit.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.860
Quote, "He said that the
flute section, which he added,

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:58.200
fitted rhythmically to 'Down
Under' and the percussion

00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:02.530
drum section at the start of the song,
which is in fact played on beer bottles

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.220
with different amounts of water in them.

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.380
Mr. Ham pointed out that the lyrics,
vocal melody, chords, and bass lines

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:12.420
were already established
when he heard "Down Under."

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.090
He looked for a complimentary
part for his instruments,

00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:20.080
and especially one which fell into the,
quote, 'tongue in cheek,' close quote,

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:22.320
nature of the song.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:28.010
He described the flute line as an
Aussie cliche melody, or what he thought

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:33.205
was an Irish Australian style melody."

00:07:33.205 --> 00:07:36.620
Now, Judge Jacobson did not
definitively resolve the question

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.680
of whether Ham had been aware
when he inserted the riff that

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.620
had been taken from
"Kookaburra," apparently assuming

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:45.220
that, as we saw in the
George Harrison case,

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:49.190
subconscious copying is actionable.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:56.440
The decisive issue in Judge Jacobson's
judgment was the amount taken.

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.440
Here's how the court expressed
the relevant standard.

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.340
Copyright infringement arises
when a defendant, quote,

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.730
"has copied a substantial
part of the copyrighted work.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:10.680
The question whether he has
copied a substantial part

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:15.860
depends much more on the quality than
on the quantity of what he has taken,"

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:17.860
close quote.

00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.840
That standard, the judge ruled,
had been met in this case.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.870
The remedy?

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.760
The defendants had to
pay the plaintiffs 5%

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:35.370
of the royalties they had earned on the
song since 2002 and into the future.

00:08:35.370 --> 00:08:38.470
In 2011, the highest
court in Australia refused

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.879
to hear an appeal from the ruling,
leaving Jacobson's decision intact.

00:08:42.879 --> 00:08:45.390
 

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.990
This case had a tragic coda.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:54.420
In April of 2012, George Ham died at
age 58 of an apparent drug overdose.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:58.820
It seems that one factor in
his decline was his dismay

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.300
that his legacy had been permanently
tarnished by the judgment

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:08.080
that he had copied another musical work,
suggesting that, more important for him

00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:11.070
than the financial liability
arising out of this case

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:14.035
was the reputational harm it generated.

00:09:14.035 --> 00:09:16.870
 

00:09:16.870 --> 00:09:21.680
So to summarize, in a case involving
fragmented literal similarity,

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.630
the plaintiff must prove that the
defendant took a substantial portion

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:30.640
of the plaintiff's work measured
qualitatively and quantitatively.

00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:33.410
In practice, that requirement
is forgiving, permitting

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:38.150
plaintiffs to recover for the
taking of quite small pieces.

00:09:38.150 --> 00:09:40.180
There's a limit, however.

00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:44.770
That limit is sometimes referred to
as the, quote, "de minimis doctrine."

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.540
An excellent description
and illustration

00:09:46.540 --> 00:09:50.290
of this doctrine to be found in Judge
Leval's 2001 opinion in the case

00:09:50.290 --> 00:09:53.360
of Davis versus The Gap.

00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:58.820
Quote, "The de minimis doctrine is
rarely discussed in copyright opinions.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:02.960
Because suits are rarely brought
over trivial instances of copying.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.770
Nevertheless, it's an important
aspect of the law of copyright.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:10.630
Trivial copying is a
significant part of modern life.

00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:13.060
Most honest citizens in
the modern world frequently

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.480
engage without hesitation
in trivial copying

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.740
that, but for the de minimis
doctrine, would technically

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.130
constitute a violation of the law.

00:10:21.130 --> 00:10:23.480
We do not hesitate to make
a photocopy of a letter

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:28.070
from a friend to show to another
friend, or of a favorite cartoon

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.250
to post on the refrigerator.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.350
Waiters at a restaurant sing "Happy
Birthday" at a patron's table.

00:10:34.350 --> 00:10:36.250
When we do such things,
it's not that we are

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:41.070
breaking the law, but unlikely to be
sued given the high cost of litigation.

00:10:41.070 --> 00:10:45.160
Because of the de minimis doctrine
in trivial instances of copying,

00:10:45.160 --> 00:10:47.890
we are in fact not breaking the law.

00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:51.860
If a copyright owner were to sue
the makers of trivial copies,

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:54.840
judgment would be for the defendants.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.290
The case would be dismissed.

00:10:56.290 --> 00:11:01.400
Because trivial copying
is not an infringement."

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.050
Now, one warning about this
otherwise illuminating passage.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:08.950
Judge Leval's example in the middle
of this paragraph about recording

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:13.000
television programs while we are
out is not, strictly speaking,

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.350
an example de minimis copying.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:18.630
Rather, as I mentioned in connection
with the Cablevision case,

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:22.760
that's an example of fair use, a
doctrine that Judge Leval himself has

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.550
done more to reshape and
invigorate than any other judge.

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:31.570
But if you exclude that one
instance, the passage in front of you

00:11:31.570 --> 00:11:35.600
nicely illustrates the general
and unsurprising principle.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.530
The law will not penalize the
taking of trivial amounts.

00:11:39.530 --> 00:11:42.620
 

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.570
There's one important exception
to the de minimis doctrine.

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:51.540
It's illustrated by the facts of
the 2005 case of Bridgeport Music.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.790
The plaintiff in that
case owned the copyright

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:58.120
in a sound recording of the
song "Get Off Your Ass and Jam,"

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.400
which was originally made by George
Clinton Jr. and the Funkadelics.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:08.350
Clinton is pictured in
the slide on your screen.

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:12.320
The Funkadelics' recording of
"Get Off" opens with a solo guitar

00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:17.340
riff that contains three notes
and lasts a total of four seconds.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.411
Here it is.

00:12:18.411 --> 00:12:20.411
[MUSIC FUNKADELICS, "GET OFF YOUR ASS
 AND JAM"]

00:12:20.411 --> 00:12:23.130
 

00:12:23.130 --> 00:12:27.260
Gangsta rap group NWA,
depicted on this slide,

00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:31.780
subsequently recorded a song
entitled "100 Miles and Runnin,"

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.430
which contained a sample from
the Funkadelics recording.

00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:41.670
Specifically, NWA copied two
seconds of the four second riff,

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:48.950
lowered the pitch, looped that
slice, and extended it to 16 beats.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:53.900
The loop, created by NWA,
lasts a total of seven seconds.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:58.090
That seven second segment derived
from the original recording

00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:01.920
appears in five places in "100 Miles."

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.400
I'm going to play one of
those five appearances.

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.230
Listen carefully, because the
segment appears in the background.

00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:11.790
And it's hard to hear.

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:14.430
A word of warning, in the
foreground of this excerpt

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.440
are some explicit lyrics that
may offend some listeners.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:20.040

them, you should skip over

[MUSIC - NWA, "100 MILES AND RUNNIN"]

00:13:26.825 --> 00:13:42.900
 

00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:47.200
Despite the brevity of the sample
taken from the Funkadelics recording,

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.960
the copyright owner brought
an infringement suit.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.080
Really, you may think.

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.760
To be sure, as the district court
that heard the case observed,

00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:00.990
the segment taken by the
defendants, though tiny,

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:04.220
was arguably important
to the defendant's work.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:07.450
In the court's words, quote,
"The portion of the song at issue

00:14:07.450 --> 00:14:12.990
here is an arpeggiated chord, that is
three notes that, if struck together,

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.520
comprise a chord, but
are instead played one

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:18.840
at a time in very quick
succession, that is repeated

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.750
several times at the
opening of 'Get Off."

00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:25.960
The arpeggiated chord is played on
an unaccompanied electric guitar.

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:29.180
The rapidity of the notes
and the way they are played

00:14:29.180 --> 00:14:34.100
produce a high pitched whirling sound
that captures the listener's attention

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:40.070
and creates anticipation of
what is to follow," close quote.

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:44.230
Well maybe, but the fact remains that
the excerpt taken is very short--

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:47.570
to repeat, two seconds
long, much shorter

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:52.010
than the excerpt in the Kookaburra
case, and much less distinctive.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:54.850
Indeed, if I hadn't pointed
it out, almost surely

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:56.980
you would not have noticed it.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:01.350
This would thus seem to be an easy
case of de minimis copying, taking

00:15:01.350 --> 00:15:05.540
an amount too small to warrant
the attention of the law.

00:15:05.540 --> 00:15:08.750
And the district court so ruled.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:11.220
Surprisingly, the Sixth
Circuit Court of Appeals

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:16.360
reversed, holding broadly that
the de minimis defense is not

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:20.480
available to a defendant who
samples sound recordings.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:24.730
Taking even a tiny piece of someone's
sound recording will trigger

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:32.010
a violation of section 106(1). ) The
rule, announced in Bridgeport Music,

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:33.580
was widely denounced.

00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:35.800
And it may well be a bad rule.

00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:39.300
But it's somewhat less
shocking than it first appears.

00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:45.100
The reason is that in US law, sound
recordings get narrower protection

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.690
than other sorts of copyrights.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:50.140
Here's the relevant provision.

00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.620
As you can see, imitating
a sound recording

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:55.976
does not constitute infringement.

00:15:55.976 --> 00:15:58.600
With respect to all other types
of copyrighted works, including

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.350
musical compositions, imitation
does constitute infringement,

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:05.510
but not for sound recordings.

00:16:05.510 --> 00:16:09.480
Only capturing the actual
sounds fixed in the recording

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.170
gives rise to liability.

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:16.960
Dubbing is actionable,
but not imitation.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:21.020
This provision explains why, as we
discussed in lecture number three,

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:25.400
musicians are free to make covers
of commercially released songs.

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.590
As we saw there, musicians have to
pay the composers of those songs

00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:33.670
or their assignees a
modest compulsory fee.

00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.440
But they don't have to get
the composer's permission.

00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.820
Even more strikingly, they
don't have to pay anything

00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.640
to the owners of the copyrights
in the sound recordings embodying

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.650
the original rendition of the song.

00:16:45.650 --> 00:16:50.600
Because they're not
capturing its actual sounds.

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.970
Now, the reason why this rule
is relevant to digital sampling

00:16:54.970 --> 00:16:58.330
is that, as the Sixth
Circuit observes, it

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:02.410
creates an inexpensive
alternative to sampling.

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:05.050
As the court explained,
quote, "It must be

00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:07.900
remembered that if an
artist wants to incorporate

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:11.619
a riff from another work
in his or her recording,

00:17:11.619 --> 00:17:15.980
he's free to duplicate the sound
of that riff in the studio.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:21.290
The market will control the license
price and keep it within bounds.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:25.869
The sound recording copyright owner
cannot exact a license fee greater than

00:17:25.869 --> 00:17:30.010
what it would cost the person
seeking the license to just duplicate

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:35.180
the sample in the course of making
the new recording," close quote.

00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:37.680
In other words, the
court argues, a blanket

00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:41.510
rule that all digital
sampling, no matter how small,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:44.075
gives rise to liability
would not, quote,

00:17:44.075 --> 00:17:46.890
"stifle creativity," close quote.

00:17:46.890 --> 00:17:51.480
Because rap artists and others
can either imitate the sounds

00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:57.130
they want or can obtain a license,
the fee for which will be low.

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:00.040
Because the licensor is aware
that imitation is lawful.

00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.080
 

00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:07.660
The court's last argument in
support of its ruling is different.

00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:12.230
Not only would a blanket prohibition
on sampling not stifle creativity,

00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:13.370
said the court.

00:18:13.370 --> 00:18:15.100
It's fair.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:15.970
Why?

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:20.270
Because, quote, "Sampling
is never accidental.

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.800
It's not like the case of a composer
who has a melody in his head,

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:27.310
perhaps not even realizing that
the reason he hears the melody

00:18:27.310 --> 00:18:31.410
is that it's the work of another
which he had heard before.

00:18:31.410 --> 00:18:33.882
When you sample a sound
recording, you know

00:18:33.882 --> 00:18:39.620
you are taking another's
work product," close quote.

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:44.130
Notice here the echoes of the fairness
theory of copyright in general.

00:18:44.130 --> 00:18:47.630
Intentionally taking someone
else's, quote, "work product,"

00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:54.770
the court suggests, is wrong, morally
wrong, and deserves to be punished.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:58.445
I leave to you the question of
whether these arguments in combination

00:18:58.445 --> 00:18:59.070
are convincing.

00:18:59.070 --> 00:19:02.050
 

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.640
I hasten to add that the
elimination of the de minimis

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:07.170
defense for sound recordings
does not necessarily

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:10.000
mean that all digital
sampling is unlawful.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.410
It's still in principle
possible for samplers

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.670
to avoid liability on
the basis of fair use.

00:19:15.670 --> 00:19:19.920
We'll take up that option in two weeks.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.720
Incidentally, the fair use
doctrine as you'll see also

00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:27.530
provides the best line of defense
for me if the Funkadelics or NWA

00:19:27.530 --> 00:19:33.005
or the Chiffons object to my use in this
lecture of pieces of their recordings.

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:35.790
 

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:39.520
The seemingly absolute position, taken
by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals

00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:43.216
in the Bridgeport case, is not
limited to the United States.

00:19:43.216 --> 00:19:49.660
In the 2008 Metall auf Metall case,
the Federal Supreme Court of Germany

00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:53.960
similarly ruled that the sampling
of any part of a digital recording

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:59.030
gives rise to infringement of the
neighboring right in the recording.

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:01.080
If you follow this link
on your screen, you

00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:05.370
can read an English translation
of the German decision.

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:11.160
So the Bridgeport Music doctrine, for
better or worse, seems to be spreading.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:16.170
The third path to a demonstration
of improper appropriation

00:20:16.170 --> 00:20:19.160
is the most interesting and complicated.

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:21.790
It involves situations in
which the defendant has not

00:20:21.790 --> 00:20:25.800
copied any portion of the
plaintiff's work verbatim,

00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.430
but has instead created a
different but similar work.

00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:34.889
Such cases of, to use Nimmer's phrase,
comprehensive nonliteral similarity,

00:20:34.889 --> 00:20:37.305
are governed in the United
States by the so-called, quote,

00:20:37.305 --> 00:20:41.290
"substantial similarity,"
close quote, test.

00:20:41.290 --> 00:20:45.470
As you might expect, the defendant is
liable under this approach if and only

00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:51.080
if his work is substantially
similar to the plaintiff's.

00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.530
Before considering what
that phrase might mean,

00:20:53.530 --> 00:20:56.680
we need to confront two
threshold questions.

00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.250
First, are additions relevant?

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.250
In other words, can a
defendant escape liability

00:21:02.250 --> 00:21:05.910
by showing that he added sufficient
things to the plaintiff's work

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.570
to make the two works different?

00:21:08.570 --> 00:21:11.010
The canonical answer is no.

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:14.580
As Judge Hand once put
it, quote, "No plagiarist

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:19.370
can excuse the wrong by showing how
much of his work he did not pirate,"

00:21:19.370 --> 00:21:21.280
close quote.

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:23.340
However, as we'll see,
courts don't always

00:21:23.340 --> 00:21:26.970
adhere strictly to that guideline.

00:21:26.970 --> 00:21:31.150
Second, what happens when the
plaintiff's work contains some material

00:21:31.150 --> 00:21:34.250
protected by copyright law
and some material that's

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:39.840
not protected, for example that
consists of facts or scenes a faire?

00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:44.050
Cases of this sort present courts
with an analytical challenge.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:47.540
Similarity that arises because
the defendant has mimicked

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:52.620
unprotected material should of
course not give rise to liability.

00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:57.290
On the other hand, if the courts or
juries ignore the unprotected material

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:01.420
altogether, they may fail to give
the plaintiff appropriate protection

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:07.000
for the original way in which he
has arranged the unprotected pieces.

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.580
No single way of handling this
problem governs all cases.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:15.810
Instead, one can find in the case
law a spectrum of approaches.

00:22:15.810 --> 00:22:20.200
At one extreme is what is sometimes
called the totality approach.

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.830
As that label suggests, it
urges the trier of fact,

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:28.980
whether a judge or a jury, to compare
the two works in their totality

00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:35.270
and decide if they are, viewed in
this way, substantially similar.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:40.460
At the opposite extreme is the
so-called filtration approach.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:45.330
The essence of this strategy is that the
trier of fact is instructed to remove

00:22:45.330 --> 00:22:50.280
all unprotected material from the
plaintiff's work before comparing it

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:52.640
to the defendant's.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:57.480
The context in which the filtration
approach is most consistently applied

00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.010
is computer software.

00:23:00.010 --> 00:23:05.460
I'll spend a bit of time exploring
how filtration works in that setting.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:10.320
You'll recall from lecture three
that some, not all, software firms

00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.030
seek to control four sorts
of behavior-- reproduction

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.460
by consumers of the object
code embodying their works,

00:23:19.460 --> 00:23:24.590
reproduction by commercial enterprises
of the object code of their works,

00:23:24.590 --> 00:23:29.170
incorporation of parts of their
source code into new programs,

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:33.420
and finally, nonliteral copying,
namely the production and distribution

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:36.400
of programs that have the
same structure, sequence,

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.060
or organization, even though they have
none of the original source or object

00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:43.870
code.

00:23:43.870 --> 00:23:47.260
The first two of these
activities, I hope you now see,

00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.680
are forms of comprehensive
literal similarity.

00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:54.260
The third is an example of
fragmented literal similarity.

00:23:54.260 --> 00:23:59.700
And the fourth is an example of
comprehensive nonliteral similarity.

00:23:59.700 --> 00:24:04.740
It's in this fourth and last setting
that the question of filtration arises.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:07.970
When does a program that resembles
another program in structure

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:11.340
and function, but contains
none of the same source code,

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.750
give rise to infringement?

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:15.550
The courts that first
addressed this issue

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:19.010
analyzed it using essentially
the same tools that they employed

00:24:19.010 --> 00:24:23.670
when analyzing nonliteral similarity
between two films or photographs.

00:24:23.670 --> 00:24:27.830
As a result, the plaintiffs,
with some frequency, won.

00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:31.980
Then in 1992, the influential
Second Circuit Court of Appeals

00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:34.790
adopted a sharply new approach.

00:24:34.790 --> 00:24:38.200
In the Altai case, the
Second Circuit adopted

00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.950
what has come to be called the
abstraction filtration comparison

00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:46.990
test for cases involving
nonliteral similarity of software.

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:50.210
As its name suggests,
this test has three parts.

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:54.730
Part one, abstraction, is adapted from
the test formulated by Judge Learned

00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:59.370
Hand long ago for determining
when the plot of one literary work

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:03.090
is too close to the plot of another.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:09.520
Here's how Judge Hand described
that test in the 1930 Nichols case.

00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:14.020
Quote, "Upon any work, and
especially upon a play,

00:25:14.020 --> 00:25:16.880
a great number of patterns
of increasing generality

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:22.590
will fit equally well as more and
more of the incident is left out.

00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:26.280
The last may perhaps be no more than
the most general statement of what

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:31.440
the play's about, and at times
might consist only of its title.

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:34.700
But there's a point in
this series of abstractions

00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.800
where they are no longer protected since
otherwise the playwright could prevent

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.200
the use of his ideas, to which,
apart from their expression,

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:46.330
his property is never extended.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:48.720
Nobody has been able
to fix that boundary.

00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:51.120
And nobody ever can.

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:53.130
In some cases, the
question has been treated

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:57.650
as though it were analogous to lifting
a portion out of the copyrighted work.

00:25:57.650 --> 00:25:59.510
But the analogy is not a good one.

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:03.250
Because though the skeleton
is a part of the body,

00:26:03.250 --> 00:26:06.190
it pervades and supports the whole.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:11.370
In such cases, we are rather concerned
with the line between expression

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:15.080
and what is expressed."

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:19.650
Graphically, this approach
might be represented as follows.

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:22.490
At the lowest level of
abstraction, in other words

00:26:22.490 --> 00:26:27.310
the level with the most detail, the plot
of a play might be depicted like this.

00:26:27.310 --> 00:26:32.030
Long lines represent major events,
shorter lines minor events.

00:26:32.030 --> 00:26:36.550
Abstracted one level, in other words
removing some of the minor incidents,

00:26:36.550 --> 00:26:39.000
the plot would look like this.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:43.230
Abstracted another level, it would
look like this, and so forth.

00:26:43.230 --> 00:26:45.750
At the highest level of
abstraction, the plot

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:50.540
is extremely general, something like boy
meets girl, they quarrel and separate,

00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:54.010
they make up, and live
happily ever after.

00:26:54.010 --> 00:26:57.510
Somewhere in this sequence
of nested patterns

00:26:57.510 --> 00:27:02.370
lies a line, hard to discern
but nevertheless present.

00:27:02.370 --> 00:27:06.840
Formulations of the plot sufficiently
abstract to fall above the line

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:11.050
constitute, within the language
of copyright law, mere ideas.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:15.480
Formulation sufficiently
detailed to fall below the line

00:27:15.480 --> 00:27:18.290
consist of protected expression.

00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:22.460
Only if the defendant's plot parallels
the plaintiff's at a level of detail

00:27:22.460 --> 00:27:28.450
below the line has the defendant
infringed the plaintiff's work.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:33.450
In the Altai case, the Second Circuit
adapted the so-called pattern test,

00:27:33.450 --> 00:27:38.250
originally develop to deal
with plots, to software.

00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.910
A software program,
the court held, can be

00:27:40.910 --> 00:27:45.760
arranged into levels of
abstraction just like a plot.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:48.440
The highest level consists
of a general description

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.150
of the function of the program.

00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:54.200
At the next level down are
major modules or subroutines.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:59.140
At the next level are finer
divisions among parts of modules,

00:27:59.140 --> 00:28:03.350
until one reaches at the
lowest level the source code.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:07.270
Once the various levels of the program
have been separated in this fashion,

00:28:07.270 --> 00:28:11.410
the Altai test requires the trier
of fact to remove, in other words

00:28:11.410 --> 00:28:17.450
to filter out, features that do
not enjoy copyright protection.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:19.360
With respect to software,
the court ruled,

00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:23.050
there are many reasons for
disqualifying features.

00:28:23.050 --> 00:28:27.410
First, the court should
identify and then filter out

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:30.860
elements of the plaintiff's program
that are necessary for the program

00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.000
to operate efficiently.

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:36.760
For example, anything necessary to
enable the program to sort and search

00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:39.780
efficiently should be removed.

00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.950
Next to go are features that are
dictated by external factors.

00:28:43.950 --> 00:28:47.740
These include features necessary
to meet mechanical specifications

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:52.370
of the computer, the compatibility
requirements of other programs,

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:55.870
the design standards of
the computer manufacturers,

00:28:55.870 --> 00:28:59.150
demands of the industry being
served-- in other words, the demands

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:04.890
of customers-- and widely
accepted programming practices.

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:10.590
Finally, and least surprisingly, it
should identify and eliminate features

00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:15.600
that the original programmer had
taken from the public domain.

00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.620
The net result is an
abridged pattern of features,

00:29:19.620 --> 00:29:24.080
like a comb missing many teeth.

00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.610
The third and last step in
the Altai test is comparison.

00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:31.320
The features of the
defendant's program are

00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:35.880
laid alongside the now filtered
version of the plaintiff's program.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.990
And the two are compared.

00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:42.650
If and only if they appear substantially
similar is the defendant liable.

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:45.190
 

00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:49.500
Since 1992, most courts confronted
with cases of this general sort

00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:52.220
have employed the Altai test.

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:53.550
It's not quite universal.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:57.650
And the Supreme Court has never
lent Altai its imprimatur.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:30:00.630
But it is surely dominant.

00:30:00.630 --> 00:30:04.390
As you might surmise, the Altai
approach favors defendants.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:08.300
Its adoption made it significantly
more difficult for software developers

00:30:08.300 --> 00:30:15.520
to recover against competitors who
deployed structurally similar programs.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.250
The Altai approach has many critics.

00:30:18.250 --> 00:30:20.620
Executives in major
software firms sometimes

00:30:20.620 --> 00:30:23.300
point to this decision
as one of the reasons

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:25.950
why they've turned
increasingly to patent law

00:30:25.950 --> 00:30:28.360
to protect their innovations.

00:30:28.360 --> 00:30:32.360
And some scholars, like
Dennis Karjala, point out

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:36.050
that the relationship between the
idea-expression distinction that

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.410
underlies the abstraction
portion of the test

00:30:39.410 --> 00:30:44.560
and the filtration portion of
the test is far from clear.

00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:50.100
But for better or worse,
the test seems here to stay.

00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:52.860
Now, let's return to the main road.

00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:55.280
The fundamental problem
I've noted is how

00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:59.490
to separate protected
from unprotected material

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:04.400
when applying the
substantial similarity test.

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:09.850
The approach most generous to
copyright owners is totality analysis.

00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:15.500
The least generous approach is the
abstraction filtration comparison test

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:20.060
now applied by most US courts
in the context of software.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:25.937
In between these two is the, quote,
"more discerning observer test."

00:31:25.937 --> 00:31:27.770
The way in which that
approach works is best

00:31:27.770 --> 00:31:32.240
explained after we've explored the
meaning of substantial similarity.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:34.860
So to that troublesome
concept we now turn.

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.990
 

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:43.440
The courts have had great difficulty
defining exactly how much similarity

00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:45.970
between a defendant's work
and a plaintiff's work

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:48.810
is necessary to trigger liability.

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:52.170
They're agreed that it's
not a mathematical question.

00:31:52.170 --> 00:31:55.370
The percentage of
overlap is not decisive.

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:58.930
The standard is much more
impressionistic than that.

00:31:58.930 --> 00:32:03.720
But the courts have trouble capturing
in words the level required.

00:32:03.720 --> 00:32:06.830
Various formulations can
be found in the case law.

00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:11.070
Listed on a map in front of
you are the most important.

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:13.070
You should not think
of these formulations

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:18.080
as distinct tests analogous to
the avowedly distinct tests that

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.280
are used to determine conceptual
separability with respect

00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:23.280
to useful articles.

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:25.850
Rather, they at least
purport to be different ways

00:32:25.850 --> 00:32:27.325
of describing the same standard.

00:32:27.325 --> 00:32:30.800
 

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:36.500
Often, courts say that two works are
substantially similar if they have,

00:32:36.500 --> 00:32:40.510
quote, "the same aesthetic
appeal," close quote.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:44.390
For example, in the 2001
Boisson case, the Second Circuit

00:32:44.390 --> 00:32:48.280
said, quote, "Generally, an
allegedly infringing work

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.480
is consider substantially
similar to a copyrighted work

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:57.530
if the ordinary observer, unless he
set out to detect the disparities,

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:01.920
would be disposed to overlook them
and regard their aesthetic appeal

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:04.620
as the same."

00:33:04.620 --> 00:33:08.140
You may recall that in
the 2005 Mannion case,

00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:10.700
the district court relied
on this test to rule

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:15.630
that a jury could find substantial
similarity between this magazine

00:33:15.630 --> 00:33:22.020
photo of Kevin Garnett and this photo
prepared for a billboard advertising

00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.362
Coors beer.

00:33:24.362 --> 00:33:26.200
Here they are side by side.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.220
 

00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:34.380
Another slightly different
formulation-- in the Ideal Toy case,

00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:36.930
the same court defined
the relevant test as,

00:33:36.930 --> 00:33:40.100
quote, "whether an
average lay observer would

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:44.400
recognize the alleged copy as having
been appropriated from the copyrighted

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:47.010
work," close quote.

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:51.650
Applying this language, a lower
court in the 1987 Steinberg case

00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:56.090
concluded that this famous
magazine cover, suggesting

00:33:56.090 --> 00:33:59.690
the myopia of residents
of New York City,

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:05.370
was infringed by this poster publicizing
the movie Moscow on the Hudson.

00:34:05.370 --> 00:34:07.090
Again, here they are side by side.

00:34:07.090 --> 00:34:10.010
 

00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:13.100
Yet another variation--
sometimes courts contend

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:15.650
that attention should
be focused on, quote,

00:34:15.650 --> 00:34:20.830
"the overall concept and
feel of the two works."

00:34:20.830 --> 00:34:24.270
For example, in the Kroft
case, the Ninth Circuit

00:34:24.270 --> 00:34:28.710
relied on that phrase in ruling
that the characters, flora, fauna,

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:33.679
and layout of an imaginary land depicted
in an advertisement for McDonald's

00:34:33.679 --> 00:34:37.969
restaurants resembled sufficiently
the corresponding features

00:34:37.969 --> 00:34:42.730
of the imaginary land depicted
in the Fun Stuff children's show,

00:34:42.730 --> 00:34:46.900
sufficiently closely to
give rise to liability.

00:34:46.900 --> 00:34:50.710
Individual features, the court
noted, were very similar.

00:34:50.710 --> 00:34:53.330
For example, quote,
"both lands are governed

00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:57.430
by mayors who have disproportionately
large round heads dominated

00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:00.960
by long, wide mouths," close quote.

00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.610
But the real basis of liability
was the overall judgment

00:35:04.610 --> 00:35:08.650
that McDonaldland, quote,
"captured the total concept

00:35:08.650 --> 00:35:14.470
and feel of the Fun
Stuff show," close quote.

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:18.070
In a similar vein, a district
court in the Kisch case

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:21.170
concluded that a rational jury
might find substantial similarity

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:26.160
in the, quote, "underlying tone
or mood," close quote, of the two

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:30.330
photos depicted on your screen.

00:35:30.330 --> 00:35:34.390
From what perspective should
these judgments be made?

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:37.940
In other words, through whose
eyes should the trier of fact

00:35:37.940 --> 00:35:43.010
view the two works when determining
whether they're substantially similar?

00:35:43.010 --> 00:35:47.690
The dominant answer to that question
is the average lay observer--

00:35:47.690 --> 00:35:52.150
in other words, not an expert in the
field of art or literature at issue,

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:55.530
but an ordinary lay person.

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:59.170
That answer is subject to
two qualifications, however.

00:35:59.170 --> 00:36:02.710
First, on occasion, courts
will adopt the perspective

00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:06.770
of the members of the intended
audience for the two works.

00:36:06.770 --> 00:36:09.760
For example, in the Kroft
case, which I just mentioned,

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.270
the Ninth Circuit at one
point sought to assess

00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:16.630
the degree to which the Fun
Stuff show and McDonaldland would

00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:23.530
have looked similar to the children at
which both works were primarily aimed.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:25.530
For those of you familiar
with trademark law,

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.730
this maneuver should remind you of
the ways in which courts sometimes

00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:30.970
assess the likelihood
of consumer confusion

00:36:30.970 --> 00:36:33.640
that arises when two
trademarks are similar.

00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.210
 

00:36:36.210 --> 00:36:38.910
The second qualification is
that courts will occasionally

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:42.530
adjust their glasses when
the plaintiff's work contains

00:36:42.530 --> 00:36:49.020
some unprotected material, as
well as some protected material.

00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:52.880
As you'll recall, I described
the two polar positions taken

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.940
by courts when dealing with such
cases-- the so-called totality

00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:02.470
analysis and the filtration approach
exemplified by the Altai case.

00:37:02.470 --> 00:37:07.150
In between those two positions is the
so-called more discerning observer

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.460
test.

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:16.835
The Second Circuit in the Boisson case
explained this approach as follows.

00:37:16.835 --> 00:37:20.830
"In the Folio Impressions case,
part of the plaintiff's fabric

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.760
was not original, and
therefore not protectable.

00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.520
We articulated the need for an
ordinary observer to be, quote,

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:32.470
'more discerning in such circumstances.'
The ordinary observer would compare

00:37:32.470 --> 00:37:36.540
the finished product that the fabric
designs were intended to grace,

00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:40.640
women's dresses, and would be
inclined to view the entire dress,

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:44.970
consisting of protectable and
unpredictable elements, as one whole.

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:49.480
Here, since only some of the
design enjoys copyright protection,

00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:54.120
the observer's inspection
must be more discerning.

00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.645
Shortly after Folio Impressions was
decided, we reiterated that a, quote,

00:37:57.645 --> 00:38:02.790
'more refined analysis,' close quote,
is required where a plaintiff's work is

00:38:02.790 --> 00:38:07.160
not wholly original, but rather
incorporates elements from the public

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.720
domain.

00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:13.840
In these instances, quote, 'What must be
shown is substantial similarity between

00:38:13.840 --> 00:38:17.970
those elements and only those
elements that provide copyrightability

00:38:17.970 --> 00:38:21.470
to the allegedly infringed compilation.'

00:38:21.470 --> 00:38:24.450
In contrast, where the plaintiff's
work contains no material imported

00:38:24.450 --> 00:38:29.460
from the public domain, the more
discerning test is unnecessary.

00:38:29.460 --> 00:38:33.150
In applying this test, a court
is not to dissect the works

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:35.150
at issue, and to separate
components and compare

00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:37.030
only the copyrightable elements.

00:38:37.030 --> 00:38:41.570
To do so would be to take the more
discerning test to an extreme, which

00:38:41.570 --> 00:38:44.290
would result in almost
nothing being copyrightable.

00:38:44.290 --> 00:38:47.600
Because original works broken
down to their composite parts

00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:51.840
would usually be little more than
basic unprotectable elements,

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:54.640
like letters, colors, and symbols.

00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.060
This outcome, affording
no copyright protection

00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:01.030
to an original compilation
of unpredictable elements,

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:07.740
would be contrary to the Supreme
Court's holding in Feist Publications."

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:09.590
OK, that's a lot of language.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:12.840
And after all that, it's
still not entirely clear

00:39:12.840 --> 00:39:15.090
what the court has in mind.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:19.120
The bottom line seems to be
when comparing the two works,

00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:23.510
don't filter out the unprotected
material as the court did

00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:26.910
with software in Altai,
but instead adopt

00:39:26.910 --> 00:39:30.970
a more skeptical stance than the
hypothetical ordinary observer.

00:39:30.970 --> 00:39:34.430
 

00:39:34.430 --> 00:39:36.920
As we've seen, the emphasis
in all of these cases

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:41.480
is on some variant of an
ordinary lay observer.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:45.960
Does that mean that expert witnesses
have no role in substantial similarity

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.670
determinations?

00:39:47.670 --> 00:39:49.490
Not quite.

00:39:49.490 --> 00:39:51.740
Although the ultimate
judgment must always

00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.980
be made from the standpoint
of an ordinary observer,

00:39:54.980 --> 00:39:59.180
experts can help in framing
the ultimate judgment.

00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.930
The Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit

00:40:00.930 --> 00:40:04.110
has developed the most
elaborate-- some scholars say,

00:40:04.110 --> 00:40:09.970
convoluted-- system for combining
expert and lay analysis.

00:40:09.970 --> 00:40:12.880
In the Ninth Circuit,
there are now two steps

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:16.160
to a determination of
substantial similarity--

00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:20.760
an extrinsic test and an intrinsic test.

00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.560
With respect to the
first, expert opinion

00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:28.020
is relevant, but not with
respect to the second.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:32.080
To win, the plaintiff
has to satisfy both.

00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:36.930
So what do these two terms,
extrinsic and intrinsic, mean?

00:40:36.930 --> 00:40:39.920
It's not entirely clear, in part
because the Ninth Circuit's usage

00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.330
has changed over time.

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:45.880
In the Kroft case, where this
approach was first deployed,

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:51.100
the extrinsic test was defined
as, quote, "similarity in ideas."

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:56.280
Intrinsic was defined as, quote,
"similarity in expression."

00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.310
This formulation, you
probably noticed, is

00:40:58.310 --> 00:41:00.500
hard to reconcile with
the fundamental principle

00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:04.460
that copyright law doesn't
protect ideas at all.

00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:07.400
Perhaps sensing that
problem, in subsequent cases

00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:10.790
the Ninth Circuit has formulated
the approach differently.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:13.570
For example, in the
Cavalier case, extrinsic

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:18.150
is treated as, quote, "an objective
comparison of specific expressive

00:41:18.150 --> 00:41:21.310
elements," close quote,
while intrinsic is,

00:41:21.310 --> 00:41:25.050
quote, "a subjective comparison of
the total concept and feel," close

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:27.530
quote, of the two works.

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:30.900
In the Swirsky case, the
court backed up a bit,

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.040
defining the issue addressed
by the extrinsic test as,

00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:39.900
quote, "whether the two works share
a similarity of ideas and expression

00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:43.820
as measured by external
objective criteria,"

00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:49.770
while the intrinsic test again
focused on total concept and feel.

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:54.730
Even the Ninth Circuit acknowledges
the clumsiness of these maneuvers.

00:41:54.730 --> 00:41:57.540
In Swirsky, for example,
the judges admitted, quote,

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:01.190
"The extrinsic test provides
an awkward framework

00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:05.010
to apply to copyrighted works
like music or art objects, which

00:42:05.010 --> 00:42:08.490
lack distinct elements
of idea and expression.

00:42:08.490 --> 00:42:13.600
Nevertheless, the test is our law,
and we must apply it," close quote.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:17.493
So too must litigants when they appear
in the courts of the Ninth Circuit.

00:42:17.493 --> 00:42:20.810
 

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:25.360
This concludes our review of the
doctrine of substantial similarity.

00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.450
In closing, I would urge you
not to put too much stock

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:32.120
in the language the courts
employ when setting forth

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.840
these various formulations.

00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.940
At least as good a guide
to the law in this area

00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:41.430
is the pattern of results
reached in the cases.

00:42:41.430 --> 00:42:44.910
That's the main reason, aside
from simple entertainment,

00:42:44.910 --> 00:42:48.390
that during our tour, I've been telling
you the central facts of several

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:52.017
of these cases and how
they were resolved.

00:42:52.017 --> 00:42:54.600
This is not to say, of course,
that the results in these cases

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:55.600
are entirely consistent.

00:42:55.600 --> 00:42:57.670
They surely are not.

00:42:57.670 --> 00:43:00.810
But from them, you can
distill an impression

00:43:00.810 --> 00:43:06.410
of the degree or kind of similarity
that will likely get you in trouble,

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:09.220
and the degree or kind that will not.

00:43:09.220 --> 00:43:12.470
More guidance than
that may be impossible.

00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:14.283
