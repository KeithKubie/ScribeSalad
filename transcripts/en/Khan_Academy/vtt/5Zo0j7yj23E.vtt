00:00:01.043 --> 00:00:03.429
- [Sal] Steve, what are doing here?

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:04.262
- [Steve] Hey, Sal.

00:00:04.262 --> 00:00:07.428
We're gonna look at this
question of, why do empires fall?

00:00:07.428 --> 00:00:10.106
- [Sal] And for those of you
who don't know Steve Schraeder,

00:00:10.106 --> 00:00:12.609
he is a World History
Fellow here at Khan Academy

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:15.536
and also a former World History teacher.

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:18.044
- [Steve] So what we want to
do here is use this big ideas,

00:00:18.044 --> 00:00:21.389
these big factors that are
somewhat common across empires,

00:00:21.389 --> 00:00:24.683
to sort of understand how
specific empires fell.

00:00:24.683 --> 00:00:28.745
- [Sal] Let's start in Achaemenid Persia.

00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:31.450
So, Achaemenid Persia,
it's an empire that lasts

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.894
for roughly 200 years.

00:00:33.894 --> 00:00:36.641
And I guess the obvious thing
about Achaemenid Persia,

00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:38.671
it gets taken over by Alexander the Great.

00:00:38.671 --> 00:00:42.782
So I'll just go ahead and
throw invasion on that list

00:00:42.782 --> 00:00:44.615
for Achaemenid Persia.

00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:46.903
So, outside of invasion,
if we go through the rest

00:00:46.903 --> 00:00:50.148
of this list, it clearly
was a large empire,

00:00:50.148 --> 00:00:52.828
so maybe there was an
element of over expansion.

00:00:52.828 --> 00:00:55.848
It was governed in a fairly federated way

00:00:55.848 --> 00:00:57.885
through these satraps.

00:00:57.885 --> 00:01:01.462
You might have had bad
leadership be a role.

00:01:01.462 --> 00:01:04.263
Darius III, famous for
deserting his troops

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:05.478
on the battlefield.

00:01:05.478 --> 00:01:06.459
- [Steve] Yeah, and on top of that,

00:01:06.459 --> 00:01:08.394
we might throw in economics as well,

00:01:08.394 --> 00:01:11.356
because as Alexander conquers
bits and pieces of the empire,

00:01:11.356 --> 00:01:13.694
he's also depriving them of the resources

00:01:13.694 --> 00:01:15.685
that those areas would provide.

00:01:15.685 --> 00:01:19.518
- [Sal] So, now let's
move on to Maurya India.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.384
Once again, a significant empire,

00:01:22.384 --> 00:01:24.662
lasts definitely over 100 years

00:01:24.662 --> 00:01:27.220
and it's actually the
largest unified empire

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.187
over the Indian subcontinent.

00:01:29.187 --> 00:01:33.033
And it starts with three
fairly strong rulers

00:01:33.033 --> 00:01:35.150
and it's known, especially
with Ashoka the Great,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.716
for spreading of the Buddhist religion.

00:01:37.716 --> 00:01:41.017
So why, in your mind, Steve, did it fall?

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:43.384
Which of these factors
played most strongly?

00:01:43.384 --> 00:01:44.377
- [Steve] Well, the
first one that jumps out

00:01:44.377 --> 00:01:45.699
is over expansion.

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:48.307
Once Ashoka dies, you see
the empire really lose

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:50.529
a lot of that northwestern territory.

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:52.544
What we did see is some religious strife.

00:01:52.544 --> 00:01:54.216
You mentioned that
Ashoka worked really hard

00:01:54.216 --> 00:01:56.840
to spread Buddhism and he did follow that

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.047
in some of his policies
which led to some tension

00:01:59.047 --> 00:02:02.162
between some of the Hindu
population in the empire.

00:02:02.162 --> 00:02:04.886
- [Sal] And so you could also
call that division as well.

00:02:04.886 --> 00:02:06.053
So, moving on.

00:02:06.957 --> 00:02:08.606
Go to Han China.

00:02:08.606 --> 00:02:11.801
It began to fall the end
of the second century CE

00:02:11.801 --> 00:02:14.561
and then falls in the third century CE.

00:02:14.561 --> 00:02:19.108
Which of these factors led
to its eventual demise?

00:02:19.108 --> 00:02:19.941
- [Steve] Right.

00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:21.845
So I think we want to start
looking at the fall of Han China

00:02:21.845 --> 00:02:24.523
from the lens of the
Yellow Turban Rebellion.

00:02:24.523 --> 00:02:27.716
And that is partly a religious movement

00:02:27.716 --> 00:02:31.191
and it also is partly sparked
by environmental factors

00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:33.798
leading to food shortages.

00:02:33.798 --> 00:02:35.662
- [Sal] And food shortages
might affect the economy.

00:02:35.662 --> 00:02:36.755
- [Steve] Absolutely.

00:02:36.755 --> 00:02:38.637
And there's a lot of internal migration

00:02:38.637 --> 00:02:42.423
to look for better jobs within
Han China because of this.

00:02:42.423 --> 00:02:43.821
- [Sal] Do you think
leadership played a role?

00:02:43.821 --> 00:02:44.654
- [Steve] Yeah.

00:02:44.654 --> 00:02:46.859
There was a lot of dissatisfaction
with the Han emperor

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:49.668
and how he was sort of dealing
with some of these problems.

00:02:49.668 --> 00:02:51.393
And over time, efforts
to defeat the rebellion

00:02:51.393 --> 00:02:53.795
led to regional warlords
gaining more power

00:02:53.795 --> 00:02:56.176
and then they eventually
carve out their own kingdoms

00:02:56.176 --> 00:02:57.428
from the Han domain.

00:02:57.428 --> 00:02:58.261
- [Sal] Okay.

00:02:58.261 --> 00:03:01.424
And then, overlapping
in time with Han China,

00:03:01.424 --> 00:03:04.094
we of course have the famous Roman Empire.

00:03:04.094 --> 00:03:05.434
And on my timeline
here, this first section

00:03:05.434 --> 00:03:07.931
is the Roman kingdom, then Roman republic,

00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.104
and then you have the formal Roman empire

00:03:10.104 --> 00:03:14.150
that collapses at the
end of the fifth century.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.005
So which of these factors
do you think played...

00:03:17.005 --> 00:03:18.600
In the Western Roman empire is collapsed,

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.260
the Byzantine empire, the
Eastern Roman empire continues on

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.383
for roughly a thousand years more.

00:03:23.383 --> 00:03:25.006
- [Steve] Well, let's start
with the obvious point there

00:03:25.006 --> 00:03:26.106
that there is a division.

00:03:26.106 --> 00:03:27.758
There's a formal political division

00:03:27.758 --> 00:03:30.042
that's gonna weaken both
halves of the empire

00:03:30.042 --> 00:03:31.904
in terms of the resources available.

00:03:31.904 --> 00:03:34.241
We also have, at the same
time as that division,

00:03:34.241 --> 00:03:36.380
religious issues going on.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.023
We have Christianity being
declared the official religion

00:03:39.023 --> 00:03:40.990
of the Roman empire at this time

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:42.556
and that leads to internal conflicts

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.766
between those who are Christians
and those who are not.

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:47.542
- [Sal] You have migrations and invasions.

00:03:47.542 --> 00:03:51.732
You have famously the Huns
migrating into Eastern Europe

00:03:51.732 --> 00:03:54.435
and then putting pressure
on the Germanic tribes

00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:58.547
to oftentimes come into the
Roman empire, but that led to...

00:03:58.547 --> 00:04:01.566
So that was both migrations and invasion.

00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:03.331
- [Steve] Yeah, and in this
case, it's sometimes hard

00:04:03.331 --> 00:04:05.533
to separate invasion from migration.

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:07.460
- [Sal] And I would throw in economy

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.264
since the Roman empire, in
its expansionary period,

00:04:11.264 --> 00:04:13.495
was constantly getting new territory

00:04:13.495 --> 00:04:17.757
which would add tax
revenues to Rome's coffers.

00:04:17.757 --> 00:04:21.321
It allowed for more and more
slaves who could work for Rome.

00:04:21.321 --> 00:04:24.998
Once you get into the
third, fourth century CE,

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:27.145
that expansion starts to stop

00:04:27.145 --> 00:04:30.170
and so it stops that
ever-growing pile of money

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.267
and ever-growing pile of labor.

00:04:32.267 --> 00:04:34.736
So, I'd argue economy played a role.

00:04:34.736 --> 00:04:36.881
You can never point to just one factor.

00:04:36.881 --> 00:04:39.689
Empires are these very complicated things

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:41.626
but there are these general themes

00:04:41.626 --> 00:04:43.809
and as a student, it's
valuable to think about them

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:45.812
in a framework something like this.

00:04:45.812 --> 00:04:47.264
- [Steve] So all these factors won't apply

00:04:47.264 --> 00:04:49.248
to every single empire you look at.

00:04:49.248 --> 00:04:51.296
They're a good starting point
when you start thinking about

00:04:51.296 --> 00:04:54.895
those questions of why did
this particular empire fall?

00:04:54.895 --> 00:04:55.728
- [Sal] Awesome.

00:04:55.728 --> 00:04:56.561
Thanks, Steve.

00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:57.676
- [Steve] Thanks, Sal.
