Speaker 1:          00:02          Go ahead.

Speaker 2:          00:07          Okay. Is your mic on? Yeah, I'm getting, this is making me nervous. Maybe I should get my epipen. Are you allergic to radio greatness that I know of. I haven't been really exposed to it yet. Anyway, let's go. Are we rolling? We're good. We're going, we're rolling. Okay.

Speaker 3:          00:27          I'm Robert Krulwich. This is Radiolab and today we're going to begin with a conversation between Dan Pashman. Okay. Um, post of a podcast here at w NYC called the Sporkful. It's about food and Amy Pearl. Amy. Yes. A digital producer here at the station who likes food. And the conversation they had was about something that happened to Amy, which she never expected, certainly didn't want. And yet it could happen to any of us at any time.

Speaker 2:          00:54          So years ago, before any of this happened to you, just tell me what was your relationship with meat? My relationship with meat? Yeah. Well, you know how when you're little and your mom is like, you could have any special dinner for your birthday. My dinner was meatballs and she was like, except me. Balls are so hard to make. So it was pot roast. And then Peter Lucchino, Peter Luger's mistake house in Brooklyn. Yeah, I used to go there quite often and I live there and I have a Peter Liquor credit card, so all those hard to get I, you know, I don't, I don't know how they give them out, but nobody seems to have one. I don't think they give them out anymore. But I mean I was very interrupted. Like I was living in Williamsburg and it just, it opened at like one o'clock every day and you could just walk in at one that had an amazing bar.

Speaker 2:          01:46          There's no tablecloths on the table. These old German waiters, they bring out your porterhouse for three. They put a little plate upside down and then put the big platter on top of it. So it's tilted and all the juice runs to the end. And then they like have the special double spoon thing that they somehow like scoop juice onto your steak and oh, so good. And also like the smell of burning fat from a hamburger. What do I mean? Dogs? Oh my God, I love hotdogs so much. When you bite into them and they're like, I'm have like a snap and like having a weenie roast out in the open air is just at, it's like the, Oh God, so good. Anyway, I, I was always very intimate. What changed? Oh my God, it was terrible. It was, what happened was I was having this beautiful, it was spring time.

Speaker 2:          02:40          I was having a beautiful leg of lamb with some neighbors and we'd like put it on the grill and it was just a delicious, beautiful dinner. And I had served with it some ramps that I foraged in my mom's yard for ramp by the way, is just a wild onion. And so, so we had this delicious meal and then, you know, I went home and I was going to sleep at like midnight, like few hours later and I just felt weird. I was like, Oh God, something's wrong. I feel like really anxious, like something's wrong with me. And I went in the bathroom and I like look in the mirror and my face was like all weird looking. And I was like, I kept laying down and be like, I'll just sleep it off, whatever it is. But every time I laid down, I felt like I was going to faint.

Speaker 2:          03:23          So I was like prop myself up and I was like, Oh God does having terrible like stomach cramps and just like a weird feeling of impending doom, you know? But just like anybody, I'm just like, just get a good nights sleep. This'll pass. I like splash a little water on my face. I mean, I'm tell him, made me think this, but I thought like maybe a snail, a tiny snail was on one of them ramps that I ate and it was like poisoning me somehow, you know, snails, I mean they probably poisonous. So I called my friends in the morning. I was like, hey, how are you guys doing? How was dinner? They were like, oh, so great. I was like, really so great. Nothing weird like panic attacks. And they were like, and they were like, oh, that was so lovely. Thank you so much.

Speaker 2:          04:11          Let's do it again. Blah, blah, blah. I was like, wow. I really had a rough night and, but I didn't think anything of it. And I went on with my life, you know, just like whatever. And then about a week or two later I made some cheeseburgers and I ate a cheeseburger and I was watching 'em goodbye Mr Chips, really teared jerking movie and a good book too. And um, about a couple of hours after I ate, I was like, started to feel really weird again. I was like feeling like I was like, had to stand up. I was like, I think I'm gonna Faint. I feel really lightheaded, I can't catch my breath. I feel like really woozy. But if anytime I laid down, I really felt like I was going to faint. So I was like trying to say sitting upright and I was like, oh my God, this is very slim.

Speaker 2:          04:56          Or I've ran into the bathroom and I was like looking in the mirror and lo and behold, I had hives all over my stomach and then they started coming out in my hands and I was like, oh my God, something's happening. And at one point I did get up and unlock my door because I did feel like I'm going to pass out, call an ambulance and then they're not going to be able to get in. So I mean I was in a little bit afraid of what was happening and when I woke up in the morning, the first thing I did was Google sudden meat allergy cause I was like this seems like an allergy. And the only thing that was the same was meat. And I'm going through and like the second thing that came up was this article that was like Florida man has sudden meat allergy.

Speaker 2:          05:37          I was like, oh my God, I think it's a possible I could have this. And so I made an appointment with my doctor. I brought in the article, I'm like, I'm going to be this person, but I can do it. I had the article in my pocket, you know, the person who goes to their doctor was something I found on the Internet. So I brought the article, it was in my pocket and like I got through the like checkup and I was too chicken. I went when I was paying the receptionist, I pulled it out and gave it to the receptionist and I was like, could you give this to the doctor? So that was like the best I could do. And then I did call my doctor and had a conversation with them on the phone asking him if I could get tested. And he was like, no, there's no such thing as a meat allergy, blah blah blah.

Speaker 3:          06:21          So some people think allergies are just like in your head and people, this is science writer, Peter Smith. We got in touch with him after Lee heard Amy's story because Peter is an investigator of many things including strange allergies and people are like, mushrooms hurt them or they think wifi hurts them. Yeah, Wifi hurts them. And I don't know. And when our producer left, if NASA and I got into the studio and we told them about Amy story, he said, yeah, all right. I know exactly who you need to talk to. Hello? Yeah. Hi Thomas Platts mills. This is Thomas Plant smells. That's right. How are you? I'm very well. Dr [inaudible] Mills is down at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. He's a professor and he works at an allergy clinic, donut allergy clinic. We are constantly sifting through stories, which not only you don't believe, but are actually nonsense simply.

Speaker 3:          07:12          And he told us in the last 10 years or so, he started hearing lots of stories, just like Amy, right? Somebody shows up at the office, convinced that they're allergic. All of a sudden for no apparent reason to red meat. The first time I heard it was probably as early as 2004 and every single time he heard the story, he would tell the patient exactly what Amy's doctor told her. Nope, no way. No, no, no. It's not possible. Right? So what was wrong with these complaints? You know, uh, you know, in an Orthodox medical way, oh, everything. Everything. Adults don't become allergic to something they've eaten for 40 years out of the blue and certainly not red meat. So you're basically saying to these patients, I think you must be making this up because I can't explain it. I don't use language like that. I said, I say that.

Speaker 3:          08:03          I was saying I was trying to give you your inner voice. Oh, you don't want to know what doctors are thinking in their inner voices. You know? You often think in the middle of an interview. Is it possible that he's got, you know, some ghastly disease? Mad Cow. Yeah. You know, the point is that when he'd hear a story like Amy's, he just didn't believe it, but then everything changed. Thanks. Oddly enough to cancer drug, this new cancer drug called Cetuximab in New York. Today, Martha Stewart was indicted on criminal charges relating. This is the very drug that got Martha Stewart in all that trouble for insider trading. It. Remember that I went to jail for six months. Yeah. Anyway, very promising, exciting new drug, but then doctors were giving people this injection and I would just end up on the floor of the doctor's office in shock.

Speaker 3:          08:56          Yeah. That would be an NF lactic shock. Their hearts would start beating faster. They'd get short of breath and get stomach cramps. Their immune system would start to overreact to something new and alien that came in with the drug. Basically a classic allergic reaction. So the industry lands on Thomas pots. Mills his desk. Yes. So we were asked to look at Cetuximab to see if they could figure out what was causing the reaction. And He tests two groups of blood, a control sample, and then people that have this allergy and he quickly zeroed in on a particular molecule. The sugar, it was part of the drug. This sugar Galack Toes Alpha one three gallon toes. Oh, Alpha Alpha Gal. Yeah, as in a particularly great lady. Yeah. Better than the Beta or gamma gallons like Alpha male Alpha female didn't quite have a ring to it for Alpha. The alpha. Anyway, it seemed like Alpha Gal was the culprit. Yeah. And if you'd told me four years earlier that there's a whole lot of people out there who are allergic to this sugar, I'd have thought you were smoking. You know vaping again, because not only does this sugar Alpha Gal show up in the cancer drug, and this is where we get back to Amy, it also shows up in the blood of mammals.

Speaker 4:          10:17          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          10:17          all non primate mammals. So every time you eat lamb or beef, goat, camel, even tripe or pig's kidneys, you're also eating Alfa Gallo.

Speaker 4:          10:31          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          10:33          So I'm reading this article and it says like, it's this thing called Alpha lactase or Alpha gala.

Speaker 3:          10:39          So it made no sense that someone like Amy who'd been eating meat all her life would suddenly somehow be allergic. The AlphaGo,

Speaker 2:          10:45          I just was like, this was so stupid. The whole show. One day it's getting to be barbecue season. I usually have like a couple of barbecues where I'd just do a whole park bought and brisket and like hang out all day doing it. And I was like very wanted to do that and I was like, I'm just going to not eat meat and not even know. So I was like, forget it. My doctor all tests me, I'm gonna test myself. So I was like going to be very careful. I got a thing of Benadryl and I was like, I'm not going to do it alone. I'll do it with my mom, my poor mom. And so I went up to my mom's and she's like really into food too. So she was like, oh this is so exciting. I got two porterhouse steaks on Salads, dues zoos explained to her what testing he had dead.

Speaker 2:          11:33          Cause I had talked a little bit about it with their so like fire up the grill do the porter has, I even think I like Instagram that as a joke like ha ha ha this might be the last time you hear from me. But so you know we're having a nice summer day. Just me and my mom having our steak. I ate like a couple of bites cause I was slightly nervous and I was like sitting in the grass with my dog and reading a book and trying to think like do I feel normal? Which try it folks. It's hard to figure out when you start asking yourself do I feel normal? Does this, am I breathing? Oh it's my stomach hurt or something wrong. And I was like, after a while I was like Ugh, I feel pretty good. And the neighbor came over and was like chatting with us and it was in the middle of that conversation where I was like, oh, I kind of feel like I have to go to the bathroom, but maybe I just have to go to the bathroom.

Speaker 2:          12:31          So I went to the bathroom. I was sitting there and I was like, Oh God, something feels bad. And then I was like, Oh God, I definitely, this is not right, something's wrong. And I went in to get the Benadryl and I took the Benadryl and I went on my bed and at the guestroom at my mom's and I was like sitting on there and I was like, oh, I just don't feel right. Oh, maybe I just take a deep breath. I'll just stand up. Maybe I just put my hands over my head like this. Hi. That does feel slightly better I think. And then I was finally like, I think we should go to the hospital. And I went out side. I was like, mom, I think you have to drive me to the hospital. She was like talking to her neighbor like, what?

Speaker 2:          13:13          Oh my God, let me go change my clothes, change my clothes. I'm like, mom, you know she's not wearing the hospital level clothes, so I'm like, okay, hurry up mom, mom, are you ready mom? And then I was like, while she was changing your clothes, I suddenly was like, oh my God, I got my wallet out and my Cell Phone and I've like threw it towards my mom's bedroom door and I was like, here's my insurance card. Call an ambulance and I just like hit the floor. Eventually the ambulance arrives and I got stabilized. I was strapped to the thing. I was in the emergency room like they were shooting. They full of, I don't know what Epinephrin and adrenaline and the little like 12 year old mercy room doctor runs in and he was like, I looked it up on the Internet, Africa. Fascinating. What? That's terrible. I've never heard of that. Could it be true? Yes, it's true. Like they're all having this discussion there. Then when I went back to my doctor after that and I was like, Hey, just get out of the emergency room, because they tested me for Alpha gout. I'm allergic to meat.

Speaker 3:          14:18          So this is an allergy. Yeah. So all of a sudden you're looking at the quote crazies and they're not so crazy anymore. Absolutely. We suddenly had a blood test and of course what turned out is all these patients who'd been telling us this story were allergic to AlphaGo, but, but it's still like a mystery. Right? There are Thomas Platts mills couldn't figure out why people like Amy, who had lived for 40 years eating porterhouse steaks at Peter Luger's a credit card. Why would she suddenly develop an allergy? Now there's gotta be some kind of trigger. Yes. Two we were looking for anything that could explain it. It could be a mold, it could be a nematode worm or a fungus. But then he looked again and noticed that all the people who had had bad reactions to the cancer drug, they were in a particular area of the country

Speaker 5:          15:13          that was Virginia, North Carolina, southern Missouri, Arkansas. No cases in Salt Lake City, no cases in Denver. Smatterings down the west. So he turned to his technician, Jake, and he said, I said, you've got to Google every map you can find and say what matches that area,

Speaker 3:          15:32          cures or diseases that appear where ever the allergy appears. So Jake starts googling, googling and googling and googling. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          15:41          And eventually he comes across a map that matches where the cases are very beautifully. The maximum area for rocky mountain spotted fever.

Speaker 3:          15:50          So he made this little map and it's like the shaded dark areas of the country are at places with rocky mountain spotted fever. And then there's like some stars where you know this, this allergy hit appeared. Yeah. And they, they overlap. Ah, very interesting. And then all of a sudden it clicks. Rocky mountain spotted fever is a tick borne disease. This is the distribution of the Lonestar tick. And actually just a little before this, it turns out and allergists down in Australia, Sheryl van Noonan, first name Cheryl is h Goyo, the Noonan, v I n and then nun e n and I'm from the Tikkun juiced. Allergies, research and awareness center in Sydney, Australia. She says she was now being visited by all kinds of people who claim suddenly to be allergic to meat. And whenever I take a history, so for example, I'd ask them, was there a family history of rhinitis, Eczema, asthma, a stinging insect allergy. And they say they've all been bitten by ticks. When we started asking patients, we suddenly heard the stories just out the Kazoo

Speaker 6:          16:57          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          16:58          but at this point, Dr Platz Mills, all he has is a map, some stories and a hunch, right? So, so what does he do? He decides, well maybe I'll just do this to myself. He does what? He decides to test it on herself. Oh my God. He sort of like [inaudible] like

Speaker 5:          17:14          the nihs that he did it intentionally. I know I had no intention. I mean he, I think he also likes to walk and amble and think about things, right? So he goes for a long walk and along the Blue Ridge Mountain. And I knew I wanted to be off trial because I'm actually rather allergic to humans. So he's walking and walking and walking. And along the way, ah, he bumps into a whole bunch of texts and if you walk into a nest of those things, oh my God, this sounds like a nightmare. Yeah, absolutely. I got 200 seat ticks a boy and then in of that

Speaker 3:          17:50          year I was taken out to dinner and the lamb chops were particularly delicious and the French wine was delicious and six hours later I woke up, covered in hives.

Speaker 4:          18:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          18:00          he's got an allergy to red meat all just because of the tick by tick bite. That's right.

Speaker 7:          18:10          [inaudible] you're right back after this. Hi, this is Sarah calling from Asheville, North Carolina. Radiolab is supported in part by the Alfred p Sloan Foundation enhancing public understanding of science and technology in the modern world. More information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

Speaker 3:          18:31          when the legendary rapper prodigy died after being hospitalized for sickle cell anemia last year. His friends, his fans were shocked in a cemetery like you're talking about this sunny day right here that we have right now, man making beats Friday g is dead right now. I'm Mary Harris and I'm Christopher Johnson. The realness is a new podcast from w NYC studios. It takes you inside prodigy's music and asks why he couldn't escape a single recessive gene. Listen and subscribe to the realness wherever you get your podcasts.

Speaker 5:          19:03          I'm Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab. Now we go back to Amy just when she's discovered that the allergy to meat that she's developed comes from a tick bite,

Speaker 2:          19:14          a tick bite. Hang on a second. Because like a few weeks before all this started happening, as I said, I was forging for ramps in my mom's backyard and I had a tick on my, on my arm.

Speaker 5:          19:30          Now it turns out that not only was that tick bite a terrible thing for Amy, it was a kind of double tragedy from [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          19:38          amongst the trees. I didn't, the undergrowth, and I think it's only right at this point to backup is a fascinating world of wonders and consider the story from the tics point of view.

Speaker 4:          19:53          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          19:53          okay. So, uh, I'm Graham heckling. I am a wildlife disease ecologist at the University of Tennessee. So I was wondering if you could help us, uh, tell the story of a, in this case, the lone star tick that bit Amy. Oh yeah, sure. So they start off on this little pile of eggs, perhaps a massive 2000 eggs under the leaves. The proud mom who just gave birth at that point, she's just a kind of a withered husk meaning dead. But anyway, a few weeks later, those eggs will hatch and this massive 2000 baby techs emerge from under the leaves. Could I see them with my naked eye? If you ran into a mass of them all up together, you would feel like you've got a little smudge of dirt and then the dirt starts walking. And so they'll just climb up and they'll know potentially all be on the same leaf, all the same looking for something to feed on.

Speaker 5:          20:49          Now, one teeny little tiny problem for these teeny little tiny ticks is that they dry out. So when they come up from under the leaves, they come up briefly and then they go back down, get a little water, come back up, get thirsty, go back down. And rehydrate. So they like commute. Exactly. And we refer to the behavior as questing Ah, restless thing. So if you were one of these little baby ticks questing for food while you're up there, you are essentially velcro because on each one of your little legs you have little kind of hook like structures. And so you're flat against the leaf, sort of sniffing in the air with your two little front legs I can detect you see a two heat movement. So let's say one day you're sitting there on your leaf and you pick up the scent, I mean nearby mouse mice of the potato chips or the ecosystem, everything he gets them.

Speaker 5:          21:37          You might be about to have the very first meal. So you basically stand up, stretch out all your little legs and do a tick dons. And so it's kind of interpretive dance like movements while you're waiting for that mouse to come just close enough that you can grab onto it. So you're dancing and you're waiting and you're dancing and you're waiting and you're dancing and you waiting and you're dancing on your way to, to be honest, you are probably going to wait your entire life and die unfulfilled because there are 2000 of you starting off and a stable tick population. There's only going to be two of you that survive. Oh my gosh. So 1,998 little baby ticks are born and then that's it for them. But let's say that you're one of the lucky ones and one sunny day. There you are hanging out on your little leaf. When you detect two incoming mammals, one is a 40 year old hominid, the other is her dog. So you perk up to rest your legs out, wave, do the tech docs and say that you're waving and you're dancing and you're hoping and you're waving you. You're dancing and you're hoping and you're waving and you're dancing and you're hoping and slowly the dog getting closer and closer and closer and you reach out with one of your tiny little little, so you get [inaudible] grab and eat and survive.

Speaker 2:          23:05          But the reason that tick ended up on me was I slept in bed with my dog naked. I mean, she's always naked, but I was also naked. I mean, that's not gross. I don't, I mean, does that sound weird? No, but what, but how do you know that's what had happened? Because I know that like I did a good tick check on myself and I took a shower and everything. And then in the middle of the night I woke up with the itching sensation and I went to the bathroom and I couldn't really see what was on, like something was on the back of my arm and was a tick. So it's the

Speaker 5:          23:40          tick is biting in the Amy, what is it giving Amy that's gonna make her allergic meat? [inaudible] I need to stop you there, Robert. Difficult one. Robert. I don't know the answer to that. Um, that's Peter Smith and well we joining us is Cheryl Vanden in the scientist a it's all up for speculation. We don't really know [inaudible] here's the theory. So normally when you eat a piece of meat, you put Alpha Gal in your stomach and your stomach digest it and it's in your body. It is no big deal. But the tick cunningly will drill into you poke and you and inject its saliva. We'll call that tick spit tick spit into its victims, straight into its victims, largest organ, the skin and ticks. But it has an anti clotting factor, anesthetic, anti inflammatory compounds and we think the AlphaGo. Now Peter says the thing about the skin is the skin is like this enormous, it's like surveillance system.

Speaker 5:          24:34          It's always on the lookout for invaders. So when the Alf Gal comes through your skin covered by all that bad, they had tick spit stuff that's going to really like set off your immune system. The immune system freaks out like oh [inaudible] and the Alpha Gal covered now in bad spirit almost sort of by mistake gets labeled bad and now it's on the bad guy. Watch list, so therefore the next time you eat meat, the meat comes in and then the body unleashes wave upon wave upon wave of chemical attacks to do battle against this AlphaGo and this reaction gets way out of hand. You've got so many antibodies multiplying and multiplying, multiplying, making you rather in this case, Amy feel just [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          25:20          Ah,

Speaker 2:          25:21          right. I mean it's very weird. It sounds like a science fiction movie. It sounds like the beginning of a science fiction at least kids book, let's not go to movie, but like it's, it's just strange,

Speaker 5:          25:34          which all goes to say that this really is a kind of double tragedy for Amy and her tech. Yeah. [inaudible] texting evolve to bite humans, right? We're a mistake. Like we have opposable thumbs. We're either going to pull them off. I actually woke my mom up and she helped get it off. Or if they drop off, they're going to drop off in a airport terminal or a Walmart carpark or somewhere like that. Shag carpet or shag carpet in doors and, and the doomed and for us, well we lose something that historically anyway is a big part of who we are. Yeah. Because we, we have, we, we adapted in the grand evolutionary scheme of things to like eat flesh to eat meat. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 2:          26:20          I mean I'm actually sitting here picturing a steak, but actually the thing, I mean hot dogs like wrap ramps around a weenie and ruts. Yama sounds so good. My mouth's water. We need linis and ramps. Yeah. But I am going my allergist tomorrow cause I did, you know, I was reading this allergy a lot when I first got it and I read that for some people the allergy can fade away. So I'm going to get a blood test to see what my blood level of Alpha gala is. So I'm a little already hoping for it tomorrow. I want to be normal again.

Speaker 8:          27:00          Hmm.

Speaker 5:          27:04          That was the end of the Dan Amy conversation. She was going to go to the doctor, get herself tested, find out whatever. So we asked her back in, okay, that's fine. You know what happened?

Speaker 2:          27:17          So I actually did get an appointment with my allergist, Dr [inaudible] name is Dr Korn. She's really nice. Um, so I got the plan when I got the blood draw, whatever. And a few days later my doctor called me and she said that my numbers were still really high and I was like, well how high are they? And she was like three and I was like three, that's not high. And she's like, they're supposed to be like one or something. So they had gone down but they were still, you know, many times more than they should be. So when you left and you were waiting for the call, where you waiting with the hope that one that you would soon be eating a bit of hotdog? I mean honestly I was hoping, no, no, no, I don't wish it. You are, you are the big, the great you, you now that I was afraid that she would be like, oh my God, your numbers are so low.

Speaker 2:          28:11          I think you could probably eat meat. Let's do a food challenge. I'd be like, ah. Cause like that's such a scary memory. Yeah. I don't, you know, actually just the other night I was eating at an Indian place and I was eating vegetarian but like I felt something and I pulled it out and in the dim light of an Indian restaurant, like why are they all let like that? I was like, was this bacon ice? And I suddenly, you know, like you just get this drop in your stomach. And I'm like, what time is it four hours from now if I, you know, cause it's, there's something about it being delayed that makes it so difficult at just as like, like a suspense movie with, it's like it could happen in the next three hours or maybe not. I don't know. I mean honestly, the only thing that, the real reason I want to be able to eat meat is so that I will be prepared to eat it in case of emergency.

Speaker 2:          29:05          I mean I went on a canoe trip in the Adirondacks and I was like, well what happens if I get to try it out here? And like what if I have to hunt but I can't even eat meat out. I have to on fish, but then when the lake freezes over, what would I eat? I can't survive. Something's wrong with me. I feel evolutionary lead challenged. This is what I think about before I go to bed every night. Would I be able to survive if I had just what's on me right now, upenn underwear, my dog. And so, yeah, I mean that's a real issue. It's like it's not a real issue. Obviously it's never going to happen and live in Brooklyn, but I, I do for some reason I always think like I want to be prepared in case, but um, yeah, you know, I don't think I would go back to eating me necessarily.

Speaker 5:          29:53          Like you are still more, more frightened than game,

Speaker 2:          29:58          so to speak. Well also like I wish I could be a vegetarian for ethical reasons because it's not so much just the eating meat, but just like, you know, the, the, the factory farming and that kind of stuff. So I feel like morally superior now I can be like, well, I don't eat red meat. Of course I'm forced to not eat it. But at the same time, I would, if I had the, if I had the willpower, I'd probably go that way anyway. And then also I think it's great. It's like we're all evolving to be on this planet, which is getting harder to be on and we know that meat takes a lot of resources and like now I don't, now I'm not doing that. So like the tic is helping me evolve into a better human being.

Speaker 6:          30:41          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          30:43          so one could, instead of thinking of the tick as your teeny weeny irritating enemy, you could think of it as a guiding light, making the world safer to share with your fellow earthlings. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          31:00          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          31:00          so you may have lost your relationship with meat, but at least you have your moral superiority.

Speaker 2:          31:05          Yeah. I mean, hi, I'm superior.

Speaker 5:          31:10          Yeah.

Speaker 9:          31:19          [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          31:19          so huge thanks to Amy Pearl for telling a story which never stopped, never stopped being scary and wonderful and to the fellow who brought her into the room, Dan Pashman, whose podcast the Sporkful is, it's, it's all about food in every conceivable way.
