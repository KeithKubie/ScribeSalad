00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.440
I'm thrilled and delighted
to welcome you to the Library

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.570
of Congress National
Book Festival

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:08.510
and to our fourth
annual Youth Poetry Slam.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.210
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:19.570
This year we have
slammers from two teams

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.480
who traveled quite long
distances to compete.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.930
So I'm going to announce them.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.770
Please join me in
welcoming, first,

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.510
from somewhat nearby
Boston, Mass LEAP.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.050
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.520
And from the other
coast in Sacramento,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.510
the Sacramento Area
Youth Speaks.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:47.240
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.800
These two teams made
the final stage

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.510
of the 2018 Brave New Voices
International Youth Poetry

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.510
Festival this last July.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.110
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.250
And we are very happy to feature
representatives from both.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.000
We are also thankful
to Youth Speaks

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.370
and to their new
executive director,

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.190
Christy Limon Johnston [sic],

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.560
they are the organization behind
the festival, for their help

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:21.020
in bringing final stages
teams and poets to the slam.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.360
I'm sorry to say that the
slammers from Dew More Poetry,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.730
the 2018 Brave New Voices Slam
champions from nearby Baltimore,

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.720
were scheduled to be
here tonight, but,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.760
unfortunately, had to cancel.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.550
But we do want to honor them
and their championship team,

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:40.050
so we have a video from
this year's performance

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:41.850
that we'd like to show.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.150
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:51.570
&gt;&gt; [exhales loudly] Fatherhood
left my mother pregnant

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.500
with absence.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.610
&gt;&gt; Breastfed me broken promises.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:59.500
&gt;&gt; [in unison] My
father knows the neck

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.440
of liquor bottles better
than he knows my name.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.790
My Father loves his spirits just

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.460
like he loves being
one in my life.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.060
But now poetry has
been the best father

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.540
since the biological one left.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.490
&gt;&gt; Having an addict for a father
and a soldier for a mother,

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.420
the war on drugs will
happen on my homeland.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.300
While she shot up people,
he shot up himself,

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.910
and I'm the one left for dead.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.890
&gt;&gt; Having a coffin for a mother

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.000
and a criminal for
a sperm donor --

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.550
&gt;&gt; [in unison] You learn
to live outside the box.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.510
&gt;&gt; You become so
numb, like a robot.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.500
But how do you explain
to the world

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.590
that you have a barely
functioning motherboard?

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.710
&gt;&gt; [in unison] And
then poetry came

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:47.970
and raised me from
my broken home.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.020
Words became magical.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.730
Maybe that's why they
call it spelling.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:57.040
Through this American horror
story we coveted our pain.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.930
But poetry taught us to
drop houses on our sorrows.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.490
&gt;&gt; Meaning we used to
live in our depression --

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.790
&gt;&gt; [in unison] Now we fight it.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.540
Boxed out my black out
for the title champion.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.660
&gt;&gt; All the times he told me I
wasn't man enough blaming the

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.790
women in my life
for my female traits

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.510
&gt;&gt; [in unison] He liked
to talk with his fists,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.850
but got mad when I
talk with my hands.

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:18.580
&gt;&gt; Only appears to appease.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.300
Becomes a vanishing act
when it's time to raise.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.600
&gt;&gt; Never taught me how to fight,

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.820
so I got jumped more
times the amount

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.070
of times I prayed
for you to save me.

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.310
Changed my praying
hands into fists.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.480
&gt;&gt; [in unison] Became
my own guardian angel

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.960
when you had no more to give.

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.260
Dad, you are no savior.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.050
You just think you're God.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.590
That's why we can't
see or hear you.

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.770
And our family forces
us to praise you.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.310
&gt;&gt; I remember when
my mother died.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.630
I couldn't tell which
was more cold --

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.870
my mother's or my father's
shoulder, or my mother's body.

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.210
I just didn't want to lose
all this joy in the morning.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:07.520
But --

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.490
&gt;&gt; [in unison] And
there's always a but.

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:23.250
Poetry taught me commas in place
of periods, taught me resilient

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:31.560
in place of malecide,
taught me metaphors

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.950
in place of self-mutilation.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.250
And isn't that what it
means to be a father?

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.550
When I'm slammed, I'm not
doing it for the points,

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.850
I'm doing it for all the love.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.150
&gt;&gt; I remember when I
wrote my depression poem.

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.450
Four people told me I gave them
the strength to finish theirs.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.750
&gt;&gt; I remember [inaudible]
me and [inaudible]

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.050
to perform our abortion poem.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.350
Our tears and smiles
was all I needed,

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:45.650
after having a life sucked out
of me, only took three minutes

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:46.950
to breathe it back in.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.250
&gt;&gt; [in unison] Meaning
we were fatherless,

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:49.550
but now our poetry
family raises us.

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:50.850
If it takes a village,
then I got that.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.150
Fatherhood left my mother
pregnant with absence.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.450
Breastfed me broken promises.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.250
But what's a deadbeat
dad to a self-love poem?

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:03.040
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.710
&gt;&gt; Although we wish Baltimore
was here with us, we are happy

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.650
to have our local slam team
and our hometown pride.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.470
So as with every National Book
Festival Youth Poetry Slam,

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.370
we are excited to introduce
the D.C. Youth Poetry Slam team

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.670
members and the team.

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.510
Please give it up for them.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.500
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.910
Before I turn things over
to our emcee, Joseph Green,

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:35.550
who's done this poetry slam
for the last three years,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.060
I'd like to say a few words

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.020
about our slam partner,
Split This Rock.

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:41.810
It's hard to imagine
where poetry

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.780
across the country would be
today without the organization.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.780
And, of course, the
organization would not exist

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:49.690
without all the hard
work of co-founder

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.510
and executive director,
Sarah Browning.

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.140
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.240
After ten incredible years,
Sarah has decided it's time

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.500
to turn the reins
over to another leader

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.400
as she goes off and
studies poetry.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.930
Sarah, you have been a
force of good in my life,

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:11.210
and in the lives
of so many others.

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.790
And you've wowed the
Librarian of Congress, too.

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:15.590
She's hoping to make
it here tonight

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.960
to catch a little bit
of the poetry slam.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.530
One of her first official acts
as the Librarian of Congress was

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:25.420
to come here and
be a judge in 2016.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.210
But she did give me a little
something to pass along to you.

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:31.510
So if you could come
up onto the stage?

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:39.040
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.300
So Sara this is a
rare harD.C.over copy

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:46.610
of "American Journal:
Fifty Poems for Our Time."

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:49.530
This is Tracy K.
Smith's anthology

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.560
that is just coming out, part
of her second term project,

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.760
signed by the Librarian herself
with great love and affection.

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.330
So thank you, Sarah.

[ Laughter ]

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:02.970
I don't feel like you
made enough noise.

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.290
Let me put that in perspective.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:11.250
Today, as you just witnessed,
you are about to listen to some

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:14.270
of the most powerful
voices of a generation.

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:18.990
Young people who have been given
a space and a stage and a pen

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.130
to write down the story
that they already had,

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:25.900
but we too often do not listen
to, they're going to come

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.770
up here, and something
miraculous is going to happen.

00:08:30.770 --> 00:08:34.890
You're going to feel connection
without anybody touching you.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:41.820
There's going to be something
profound going on in this room.

00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:47.230
I was raised in the south during
the summer times, and I would go

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.980
to church with my grandma.

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:52.550
And they would sing,
better than I can sing,

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.340
because I can't sing, "Are
You Ready for a Miracle?"

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:59.160
And the church would sing
back, "Ready as I can be."

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.900
Are you ready for a miracle?

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:04.190

Ready as I can be.

I have a co-host, who
will be sitting over here.

She is the director of youth
programs at Split This Rock.

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.060
Her name is Chelsea.

up" to everybody.

connection, right?

five minutes before the show.

Things that you guys need
to know about, this program,

you not only by the Library

by Split This Rock.

that you need to know

may I suggest a follow-up
movie, a sequel, if you will.

The movie will be about a

We can call her Super

that we feed the world, and

So give us a movie, Marvel, and
let it be called "Afrowoman."

can be the personification

reversing the bullets,

revolution of invisibility.

Also, hypervisibility.

00:21:50.770 --> 00:21:53.840
The metaphor being that black
women are always ignored

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.140
or exploited.

00:21:55.140 --> 00:21:58.280
Her invisibility powers are
on a set of bangle bracelets.

The metaphor being that
black women can be heard,

but not seen, like screams
or ghosts or gunshots.

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:08.640

defeats the villain,

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.650
because she will
defeat the villain,

00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:15.550
for once, she will be the hero.

knots and combat boots,

and a million black
women march behind her.

00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:40.700

every great black woman is a

thousand other great
black women.

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.810

or an explanation for anything.

You know? The glorified
mistakes.

00:26:59.510 --> 00:27:03.040
Until, eventually, my teacher
came and told me to stop writing

on my textbook, you know,
'cuz it's not "mine to claim."

through the faded
ink on the pages

piece of this, you see.

not written for me.

banner to some,

flip onto my skin like embers.

All I see are dead, white men
I'm supposed to mold into God,

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.950
to the floor.

Concept attempting to tear
open my skull 'cuz kids strive

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:01.460
to be open-minded, or
as open as they want,

00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:03.410
as open as these
textbooks can go.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:05.890
And we were never supposed to
test the limits of this binding.

00:28:05.890 --> 00:28:10.110
I constantly feel my knowledge
pressed against the walls

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:13.610
of this curriculum, amazed
with narrow passages,

00:28:13.610 --> 00:28:15.450
every page a bob-wired sentence.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:16.950
And I'm a heathen for believing

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:19.250
that there's something
on the other side.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.950
No. For learning things that
came through between the pages

00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:27.670
of a book, or into square math,
minds like -- like, dang --

00:28:27.670 --> 00:28:30.640
like, how the U.S.-led genocide
on the indigenous people

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:35.400
of this land [inaudible],
and how it still sanctions

00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:39.020
such slaughter, so why do we
have to glorify your forefathers

00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:41.140
in this home of the
slave, land for the free?

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:46.890
It's funny how they teach
white kids about conquering,

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:49.040

about confinement.

space for people of color

00:28:59.030 --> 00:29:06.350

always been in the margins.

00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:25.410
&gt;&gt; So one of the things
about being the host

00:29:25.410 --> 00:29:27.870
of a poetry slam is that
you're not allowed to speak

00:29:27.870 --> 00:29:30.640
about the poems,
because it, you know,

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.940
could sway the judges
or the audience.

00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:38.400
So I have the ability to
think some of the people

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.530
who made this happen, and also
tell you about Split This Rock

00:29:41.530 --> 00:29:43.120
and some of the amazing
things that happen there.

00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.640

some folks real quick.

round of applause as we attempt

to all -- judges, rather.

me to go to school

of taking our identity.

But I won't let them
chain my mental.

so clearly these classes

00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:46.820

helping us in real life.

I remember when education
was actually meant to educate

00:32:51.750 --> 00:32:55.330
and uplift the youth and help
us elevate, but now all it seems

to read or write.

in these classrooms

brainwashing to me.

supposed to lead us to success?

00:37:48.170 --> 00:37:51.400
Women become the ash without
having ever been cold,

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.320
without having ever seen
the light in our lives,

00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:58.090
without having ever seen warmth,
only becoming the darkness.

00:37:58.090 --> 00:38:00.100
The wedding is the auction.

00:38:00.100 --> 00:38:02.240
The sell-off becomes
the funeral.

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:03.830
The price tag, my eulogy.

00:38:03.830 --> 00:38:08.110
Father taught me to never
wear my heart on my sleeve,

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:09.550
but rather in my hands

00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.840
so I could crush my heart
before you get the chance to.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.960
Shh, don't think too loud.

00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:19.320
Remember, the opposite
of marriage is death.

00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:22.860
The price of speaking is flesh,
unless you crave the black

00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:26.050
and blue being bruised
onto bones.

00:38:26.050 --> 00:38:27.960
I heard if you throw a woman

00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:31.420
into a steel corset wedding
dress, her ribcage will crack

00:38:31.420 --> 00:38:32.720
and you'll never
hear her scream.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:36.120
Now, loo, isn't this
wedding ring pretty?

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:38.710
Now, look, isn't this
wedding ring pretty?

00:38:38.710 --> 00:38:41.810
Admire the sleeves of henna
wrapped around my wrists,

00:38:41.810 --> 00:38:44.520
watch these blossoms turn
to cuts because the pain

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:47.550
of a woman has always been
such a beautiful thing to you,

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:51.290
Middle Eastern in fighter,
Middle Eastern in strength.

00:38:51.290 --> 00:38:53.760
But when did adding woman
to Middle Eastern mean less

00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:58.790
of a survivor of war,
of rape, of womanhood?

00:38:58.790 --> 00:39:00.390
I guess father never realized

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.650
that a woman must shine
bright before she is ash,

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:05.990
must bring warmth
to all cold hearts.

00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:07.470
Woman holy enough.

00:39:07.470 --> 00:39:08.770
Sixteen years old.

00:39:08.770 --> 00:39:10.750

Smart, despite bereft
of education.

00:39:16.550 --> 00:39:19.800
The paradox of our eyes are that
they burn [inaudible] in a fire,

00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:22.810
so the rest of the body melts
while you watch it happening.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:25.640
Watch me stir up a
revolution, peeling the shells

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:29.650
of the patriarchy, mixing your
ego, insecurity, drowning them

00:39:29.650 --> 00:39:31.360
in the oil that I cook in,

between the bonfire.

above your body's ashes.

&gt;&gt; You got this!

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.290
&gt;&gt; I've been experiencing
writer's block.

00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:32.570
But not the kind
where you can't write.

00:41:32.570 --> 00:41:33.870
But when you can't feel.

00:41:33.870 --> 00:41:36.890
&gt;&gt; Mmm, come on, poet.

00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:40.050
&gt;&gt; When words fail to be seen,
and my tongue can assist me

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:45.150
like it once did, often I
wonder if this pen has lost all

00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:47.680
of its courage to keep writing.

00:41:47.680 --> 00:41:49.580
But I carry my ancestor's
bravery.

00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:54.420
So when I get writer's
block, I find inspiration

00:41:54.420 --> 00:41:57.530
in dancing trees,
ponding my release

00:41:57.530 --> 00:42:00.040
from my chained mentality.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:04.080
And I realize that time is
complacent, that surviving

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:07.960
as a black artist with anxiety
can be a suicide mission.

00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.980
Some days I feel my body being
swallowed up into the belly

00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:16.830
of white supremacy where I
am dead weight in oceans full

00:42:16.830 --> 00:42:20.220
of bodies floating,
refusing to become ebony.

00:42:20.220 --> 00:42:22.450
See, that's how I be.

00:42:22.450 --> 00:42:26.110
Too afraid to swim, so I
become a wade in the water.

00:42:26.110 --> 00:42:29.420
Too worried to be -- too
worried in being misunderstood,

00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.720
so I become statuesque.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:35.010
See, I was forsaken by the
same hands that birthed me,

00:42:35.010 --> 00:42:38.380
so poetry is more than
sustaining a legacy,

00:42:38.380 --> 00:42:39.740
but creating a family.

00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:41.040
&gt;&gt; Come on.

00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:42.980

is surviving.

00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:45.530
It's allowing each metaphor
to drip off the tongue.

are being used as anchors,

to be the first big chop.

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:46.150

of our survival could be
seen through our roots

00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:49.580
with some days, I question

00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:53.150
if this hair has ever truly been
ours 'cuz white people have been

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:54.450
picking at our locks.

Like in 1979, when Bo Derek wore
cornrows for the first time.

And soon after, many other
white women copied the style.

00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:14.900
Before this, they called it
hair-kinky, called it nappy,

00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:22.060
called it dirty, dreadful and
unkempt, but never beautiful.

00:47:22.060 --> 00:47:24.480

Kylie's out here trying

00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:26.930
to hold a candle to my roots.

00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:30.920

filter heat source, edges laid

with the walls.

00:56:37.240 --> 00:56:38.540
I got lost in the
thrill of it all.

00:56:38.540 --> 00:56:39.840
I let it linger.

00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.140
It's the only way
I've ever remembered

00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:42.440
that I am my father's son.

00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:44.280
It's the only sliver of manhood
I haven't learned from him.

00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:46.250
See. the men in my family
don't really get it like that.

00:56:46.250 --> 00:56:47.550
But Frank does.

00:56:47.550 --> 00:56:48.970
See, the men in my
family are children

00:56:48.970 --> 00:56:50.470
of the sun with obsidian hearts.

00:56:50.470 --> 00:56:51.890
Meaning they're black
and beautiful

00:56:51.890 --> 00:56:53.190
and cold and hard to crack.

00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:54.490
I ain't never seen
my father cry.

00:56:54.490 --> 00:56:57.700
I only seen my brother cry once.

00:56:57.700 --> 00:56:59.000
I ain't cried since
the death of me.

00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:00.350
My grandfather, past tense,

00:57:00.350 --> 00:57:02.720
Frank Ocean has that
project, right?

00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:04.020
"Boys Don't Cry."

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:07.430
But I'm learning that tears tear
away the turmoil of any trauma.

00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:09.230
And, because of that, I'm
making peace with my soul.

00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:11.360
Because of that, I'm
praying for peace

00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:12.660
of mind, of rain from the sky.

00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:14.120
Like, man, I guess
what I'm trying

00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.620
to say is Frank Ocean taught
me how to love myself,

00:57:16.620 --> 00:57:17.920
taught me to take my time,

00:57:17.920 --> 00:57:20.690
taught me that not being okay
is okay, because I never looked

00:57:20.690 --> 00:57:22.350
at myself as anything
more than a burden.

00:57:22.350 --> 00:57:24.950
I always thought myself to
be a Kinder Atlas holding

00:57:24.950 --> 00:57:26.250
up the weight of the world

00:57:26.250 --> 00:57:27.710
on strained shoulders
and straight knees.

00:57:27.710 --> 00:57:30.800
I've reprised my
desire to do it solo.

00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:32.860
But I'm learning to take
care of myself in a way

00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:34.420
that won't worry my mom,

00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.800
or while turning my
casket's scratched ceiling

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:40.170
into an open door, I'm learning
that this is a sweet life.

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:42.820
That I'd rather chip my pride
than lose my mind out here.

00:57:42.820 --> 00:57:44.120
It wasn't Frank Ocean

00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:46.000
that I thought would help
me experience this epiphany,

00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:50.080
because, in all honesty,
[singing] I'm used

00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:53.040
to being closed off, yeah.

00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:56.240
Ain't used to being wrong.

00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:58.710
Now you are and I
am madly involved,

00:57:58.710 --> 00:58:01.510
madly involved [end singing.]

just have to let it.

Chelsea, are we ready
with the scores?

00:58:29.550 --> 00:58:30.850
&gt;&gt; Yes, sir.

00:58:30.850 --> 00:58:32.150
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:58:32.150 --> 00:58:33.450
&gt;&gt; From low to --

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:34.750
&gt;&gt; Yeah, no, that's
some good time.

00:58:34.750 --> 00:58:36.050
I don't know why.

00:58:36.050 --> 00:58:37.350
Yeah.

00:58:37.350 --> 00:58:38.650
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:58:38.650 --> 00:58:39.950
&gt;&gt; Yeah, we're gonna
work it out.

00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:41.250
We got five --

00:58:41.250 --> 00:58:42.550
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:58:42.550 --> 00:58:43.850
&gt;&gt; More to go.

00:58:43.850 --> 00:58:45.150
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:46.450
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:58:46.450 --> 00:58:47.750
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:58:47.750 --> 00:58:49.050
I'm gonna go.

00:58:49.050 --> 00:58:50.350
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:58:50.350 --> 00:58:51.650

9.2, a 9.3 and a 9.4.

the poet, please!

&gt;&gt; Yay?

the bathroom set up.

00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:08.170
&gt;&gt; Dirty. Eww.

00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:10.470
&gt;&gt; Go, poet.

00:59:21.050 --> 00:59:25.450
We pray that no harm on thy
children may fall, that blessing

00:59:25.450 --> 00:59:28.650
and peace may descend on us all,

00:59:28.650 --> 00:59:33.220
so that we may serve thee
ever alone land that we love,

00:59:33.220 --> 00:59:36.720
our Sierra Leone -- for whom.

00:59:36.720 --> 00:59:41.320
Africa produces three-quarters
of the world's diamonds,

00:59:41.320 --> 00:59:46.330
but not all come cut, cleaned
and polished into perfection.

00:59:46.330 --> 00:59:49.270
Some grow black spots
we call graphite.

00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:51.650
They say the clarity
of these stones depends

00:59:51.650 --> 00:59:53.350
on the size of their impurities.

00:59:53.350 --> 00:59:56.480
But the most prized diamonds
are not usually found

00:59:56.480 --> 00:59:58.070
in poorer colors.

00:59:58.070 --> 01:00:01.110
The irony in this is that
they're cultivated in its reign

01:00:01.110 --> 01:00:04.510
as jagged as mountaintops,
dug up by people with eyes

01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:07.820
like ivory and skin
the color of obsidian,

01:00:07.820 --> 01:00:11.110
in a continent whose
pain is often overlooked.

01:00:11.110 --> 01:00:13.050
It's safe to say that
like these stones,

01:00:13.050 --> 01:00:15.970
my mother's land has been
flawed since the beginning.

01:00:15.970 --> 01:00:17.270
When I think of home,

01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:19.590
my sweat-slicked chest
become speckled with blood

01:00:19.590 --> 01:00:22.880
as hand turns to stump
and white owner see's sun.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:27.210
For the first time, I am a
girl dripping with the history

01:00:27.210 --> 01:00:30.860
of a war-torn country,
but my people don't bleed.

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:33.150
Our diamonds do it for us.

01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:35.330
When the conflict
ensued, my parents fled.

01:00:35.330 --> 01:00:38.520
So I can't tell you what it was
like to have grown up there.

01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:40.000
So I've seen the severed hands

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:42.470
or witnessed the
limp lifeless bodies,

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:49.390
but even as an Acasa I can tell
you of fear, I can tell you

01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:57.640
that the fear of being
forgotten in a land made foreign

01:00:57.640 --> 01:01:02.520
to you scares us more than
your Ebola virus is doing.

01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:05.750
All I have left to ask
is to the employees

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:08.170
of De Beers Mining Company,
what do you have to say

01:01:08.170 --> 01:01:10.240
for yourselves when the
wellbeing of a group

01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.960
of people can matter less
to you than the amount

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:15.400
of rough you are able to pocket?

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:20.570
And Sierra Leone translates
to the Lion Mountains

01:01:20.570 --> 01:01:24.910
in Italian then Pedro
de Centre [phonetic].

01:01:24.910 --> 01:01:26.670
Just how quickly are we

01:01:26.670 --> 01:01:29.790
to become the pride
of a dying breed?

01:01:29.790 --> 01:01:32.810
Words reduced to remnants and
human beings turned beasts

01:01:32.810 --> 01:01:34.120
of no nation to Americans.

01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:38.080
Do you know what
it's like to live

01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.140
in a country that
loves you back?

01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.650
I'm both black and Muslim,
and learning more as the more

01:01:44.650 --> 01:01:48.980
in America that not all men
were created equal if the death

01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:50.610
of one can outweigh
that of another.

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:52.960
If Sheila Abdus-Salaam can
show up dead in a river,

01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.690
and have her passing
be called a suicide.

01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:56.740
I stand as the fifth
of six children

01:01:56.740 --> 01:02:00.840
of two third-world
immigrant parents

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:03.400
who have never let me forget

01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:06.140
that words are sharper
than swords.

01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:13.160
So as Sierra Leone
stands as number 180

01:02:13.160 --> 01:02:14.780
on the World Health Organization
list of disparaged countries,

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.080
as I call my grandmother
from the privileged end

01:02:16.080 --> 01:02:17.570
of a Boss telephone card to
speak for only ten minutes,

01:02:17.570 --> 01:02:18.980
and a savagery continues
to run through the pinnacle

01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:20.280
of these veins in a [inaudible]
community, I am reminded

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.770
that this is not for the
32-carat wedding band sitting

01:02:21.770 --> 01:02:23.070
happily ever after
on your finger.

01:02:23.070 --> 01:02:24.370
This is for the people suffering
every day just so it can happen.

01:02:24.370 --> 01:02:25.670
This is for the jollof
rice would taste

01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:26.970
so tantalizing it
surpasses every other.

01:02:26.970 --> 01:02:28.270
But, most of all, this
is an elegy written

01:02:28.270 --> 01:02:29.570
for the people whose
names I don't know,

01:02:29.570 --> 01:02:30.870
but whose country I come
from, because this is

01:02:30.870 --> 01:02:32.170
for Sierra Leone, and you trying
to turn diamonds into dust,

01:02:32.170 --> 01:02:33.970
but forgetting we are resilient.

do, like, an open mic,

of a group of people,

can go to to pursue that dream.

you can go every third Saturday,

from the unknown,

me an abnormality.

looked this way.

But he, with his light
brown eyes and silver smile,

told me I was too
cute for a black girl.

skin wasn't passed

down by solid kings
and beautiful queens.

symbol for the metal in my back,

the sass in my hips,
the ocean in throat.

01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:55.850

to Trayvon Martin for dying

in the horizons of the sun,

and afro baby blues, our skin.

runs through our veins,

me obituary, call me quick,

slowly becoming "I was,"

What if every time
I looked at you,

I'd watch your eyes unearth
all the wrong parts of me,

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:35.230

from the basement of my belly,

hear his contempt echoing

the emptiness you fill?

And I'm taking the
middle-school snowstorm.

with every show I
ever binge-watched

to be breaking

You'd have thought me
by now an empty man.

I fill my body up with
my voice some days just

01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:43.360
to remind myself what I
have left to hold on to.

01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:51.570
And prom night 2017,
I arrived alone.

Fear lacing the inside
of my collar,

01:18:56.470 --> 01:19:00.170
standing like a last-second
decision waiting

01:19:00.170 --> 01:19:02.250
to shrink back into oblivion.

01:19:02.250 --> 01:19:06.540
But then I see my friends.

High school was a hurricane.

01:19:15.780 --> 01:19:19.720
And we were always
caught standing outside.

01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.480
They still make me smile,

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.740
like this is just
another Saturday night.

01:19:25.740 --> 01:19:32.170
And after the music ends,
after we step back outside

01:19:32.170 --> 01:19:33.890
into the cool mouth of
night and make peace

01:19:33.890 --> 01:19:35.870
with our toes stuffed
inside these dress shoes

01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:40.940
and our laughter, like a
dandelion finding the slivers

01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:45.900
of light, finding its way into
every corner of every eye in us,

01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.880
a flock of smiles
breaking fly for winter,

like we're trying to let the
whole world inside our part.

After the music ends, after
the dance floor clears

like a holiday tabletop,
you find your forehead wet

01:20:03.700 --> 01:20:05.050
with whatever your
footwork managed to kick up.

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:08.140
The magic dissolved means the
house lights, the doors open

01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:09.440
and let all that stank out.

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:12.530
We step up, come from out of the
cut again, and this is our part,

01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:15.430
plays like PlayStation
and school bell,

01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:17.510
and anime and awkward.

And however we learn to cope
with the world to familiar

01:20:23.780 --> 01:20:25.150
with a bend of our
backs, and too eager

01:20:25.150 --> 01:20:27.990
to see the way we drop
belonging, is to only ever come

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:29.510
when the night is
over, when we're left

in the corner of
everyone's eyes.

and ninjutsu all
in one pose chop.

like this is GTA 5 Million,

like it's about that time
at Asgard to Ragnarok.

way our steps fill up,

to an IHOP, we are glowing,

had all calendared with dread,

with cynicism and regret.
