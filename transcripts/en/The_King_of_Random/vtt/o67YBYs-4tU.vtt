[Captions by Y Translator]
In today's video,

00:00:01.011 --> 00:00:03.750
we're testing out what happens
if we put Orbeez

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:04.872
into a microwave.

00:00:12.842 --> 00:00:15.362
Cal is strangely
attached to her Orbeez.

00:00:15.362 --> 00:00:16.828
Have you seen them?

00:00:16.828 --> 00:00:19.722
I think just
because they're colorful.

00:00:19.722 --> 00:00:20.722
They're so shiny.

00:00:20.722 --> 00:00:22.872
Can you explain to us
the simplified version

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:23.944
of what Orbeez are?

00:00:23.944 --> 00:00:25.750
They're kind of
a children's toy,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.072
they're also used for types
of plants to keep them watered.

00:00:29.072 --> 00:00:30.100
Very, very simple.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.800
They come in tiny little packets
and little bead forms.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.032
You put them in water
and four hours later,

00:00:35.032 --> 00:00:36.899
you have a jar full
of colorful beads.

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.803
So just so you guys know,
as pretty as these are,

00:00:39.803 --> 00:00:41.246
you don't want to eat them.

00:00:41.246 --> 00:00:43.582
No, really, that was
my first thought was...

00:00:43.582 --> 00:00:44.738
She tried to eat them.

00:00:44.738 --> 00:00:45.950
I did try to eat them.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.948
They are full of copolymer
of sodium acrylic acid.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.775
It's not really good for you.

00:00:50.775 --> 00:00:53.540
The polymer that these
are made of absorbs water

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.150
at a fairly astounding rate.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.162
And that's what happens.

00:00:56.162 --> 00:00:57.962
That's what change
them from the tiny

00:00:57.962 --> 00:01:01.162
little plasticy-looking beads
to these much larger,

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.012
almost gelatinous beads.

00:01:03.012 --> 00:01:07.150
And I thought microwaves do
a very good job of exciting

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.650
the energy in water.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.450
So since these have
absorbed so much water.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.432
What would happen
if we put them in a microwave?

00:01:14.432 --> 00:01:16.785
So, of course this experiment
of putting them

00:01:16.785 --> 00:01:20.040
in the microwave will absolutely
not hurt my Orbeez, will it?

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.220
They're gonna die.

00:01:21.842 --> 00:01:23.842
Why would you do that?

00:01:23.842 --> 00:01:27.100
Oh, no, I have to resort them
before we can start.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.278
The idea is pretty simple.

00:01:28.278 --> 00:01:30.758
We're going to try
putting a lot of Orbeez.

00:01:30.758 --> 00:01:33.786
A small amount of Orbeez
and then just a few Orbeez

00:01:33.786 --> 00:01:36.450
into a microwave and see
what happens to him.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.372
Let's take this jar of Orbeez
and pop them in the microwave.

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:46.978
The back of the microwave is
just a single metal plate,

00:01:46.978 --> 00:01:49.102
and we actually cut
a small hole into it

00:01:49.102 --> 00:01:52.350
and have attached a cell phone
back there using some duct tape.

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.784
We're hoping that this way
we're going to be able to film

00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:57.350
the inside of the microwave
and really see what's happening.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.412
This is like $10 total
and I am very entertained.

00:02:02.412 --> 00:02:05.000
All right, let's start
with I'd say...

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.600
Two minutes!

00:02:05.763 --> 00:02:07.148
See how that goes.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.400
Nothing yet.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.880
Well, not much happened.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.900
It looks like a jar
full of Orbeez.

00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:33.022
Are they warm
to the touch at all?

00:02:33.022 --> 00:02:34.253
The jar is warm.

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:36.150
Yes!

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.200
Protip: that's not the way
you should test

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.208
if something's hot.

00:02:39.208 --> 00:02:41.850
We didn't get too much
of result with two minutes.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.140
Let's try longer.

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.740
My jar is
considerably hotter now.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.448
That's that's impressive.

00:02:55.448 --> 00:02:57.010
Oh wait, this is weird.

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:58.900
There's bubbles in them now.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:01.642
Did we start boiling
the water within?

00:03:01.642 --> 00:03:02.223
There were bubbles

00:03:02.223 --> 00:03:02.740
and then before.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.000
We're going to go ahead
and try a smaller container.

00:03:06.003 --> 00:03:06.832
The big ones,

00:03:06.832 --> 00:03:09.249
they are so many that it takes
a long time for it to heat up.

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:11.650
That has run for what,
five minutes now, I think?

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.192
About that.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.942
How long should I
put these ones in?

00:03:13.942 --> 00:03:16.096
Five minutes?
We can try.

00:03:19.657 --> 00:03:20.657
Five minutes.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.311
Oh, I hear
things happen already.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.240
What?

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.560
Is that the water?

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.840
Is that actually them?

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:31.840
I don't know.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.500
Something's sizzling.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.040
Oh, one popped.

00:03:36.042 --> 00:03:37.050
Sounds like popcorn.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.838
No, one actually...

00:03:37.838 --> 00:03:38.693
Did you see that?

00:03:38.693 --> 00:03:39.850
You can see the pieces.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.480
One actually just burst.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.320
Whoa!

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.763
Are there any
more in the jar?

00:03:48.763 --> 00:03:49.800
I don't know.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.800
That was like a baby
explosion of orbs.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.440
Probably enough time.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.250
That was like one minute.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.280
Put it in for five,
and it hasn't even been one.

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.140
Okay, don't put Orbeez
in the microwave.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.740
It's been about 20
minutes of cleanup.

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:12.980
So now we're going to try
an even smaller amount,

00:04:12.991 --> 00:04:14.060
see if we can make

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.732
that happen in an even
shorter amount of time.

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.260
It's making plasma.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.340
Oh my gosh,
that was set on fire?

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.420
It's plasma.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.700
Is that what that was?

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.200
Yes.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.498
That was insane.

00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:34.344
They just lit up
the entire microwave.

00:04:36.472 --> 00:04:38.977
Oh the ones on top,
were actually fried.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:39.752
What?

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.040
Can I grab them?

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.950
They didn't explode
the same way as before,

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.042
but, like, they're torn open.

00:04:45.042 --> 00:04:45.840
Be careful.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.152
They're hissing
when I touch them,

00:04:49.152 --> 00:04:50.850
but they're not that hot.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.740
Let's try just setting them
on the tray without the bowl.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:55.872
All right, that should be weird.

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.920
Let's try that.

00:05:01.062 --> 00:05:02.012
That took no time.

00:05:02.012 --> 00:05:02.982
There's that plasma.

00:05:02.982 --> 00:05:04.522
They are already gone.

00:05:04.768 --> 00:05:05.650
Wait, nope.

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.619
It's just like the arcing.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:10.580
Yeah, like, they're
like all connecting.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.860
There goes another.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.460
I know.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.380
Whoa, okay, that one.

00:05:19.393 --> 00:05:21.852
That one actually
was at the wall.

00:05:21.852 --> 00:05:23.223
Like, jumped back.

00:05:23.223 --> 00:05:24.900
And now there's smoke.

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:26.553
Might be steam.

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.120
Is it so?
Might be.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.300
What does that look like?

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.600
They look relatively fine.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.200
I think these kind
of fused together.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.032
That's awesome.

00:05:42.792 --> 00:05:43.492
But look at all

00:05:43.492 --> 00:05:45.512
the little fissures
running through them now.

00:05:45.512 --> 00:05:46.312
Yeah, right.

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:47.249
I want to try again.

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:49.071
But this time,
let's separate all of them,

00:05:49.071 --> 00:05:50.542
so none are touching each other.

00:05:50.542 --> 00:05:53.092
Because I think that's
what makes the plasma happen.

00:05:53.092 --> 00:05:54.354
Okay, it's taking longer

00:05:54.354 --> 00:05:56.932
than it did when we had
them all clumped together.

00:05:57.252 --> 00:05:58.692
Nothing yet.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:01.108
Okay, so nothing
happened that time.

00:06:01.108 --> 00:06:03.082
So we're going
to tip the microwave,

00:06:03.082 --> 00:06:04.950
see if we can get
them to collide,

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.081
see what happens.

00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:08.742
I would have waited
just a little longer.

00:06:11.662 --> 00:06:13.372
That did it.

00:06:13.962 --> 00:06:16.376
So the plasma only happens
when they're touching.

00:06:16.380 --> 00:06:17.040
Yeah.

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.400
But weirdly it didn't really
happen much in the bowl.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.594
They exploded in the bowl.

00:06:20.594 --> 00:06:23.104
Yeah, I think that was just
too many in one place.

00:06:23.104 --> 00:06:24.841
I think it just
built up too much,

00:06:24.841 --> 00:06:27.632
but one or two touching,
you're getting that little...

00:06:27.632 --> 00:06:29.072
That arc of some kind.

00:06:29.072 --> 00:06:29.872
Yeah.

00:06:30.372 --> 00:06:32.649
Okay, you can see the ones
that ran into each other.

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:34.428
They're almost glued
together now.

00:06:34.428 --> 00:06:36.100
I wanna see them explode again.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:37.971
Yeah.
Here goes.

00:06:39.892 --> 00:06:42.800
At this point we just want
to watch something else go boom.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.500
Popcorn sounds, popcorn sounds.

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.180
Well, things are popping.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:58.300
It's like a bowl of popcorn
just explodes, but in color.

00:06:58.548 --> 00:07:00.933
Nothing, nothing, nothing, pop!

00:07:02.382 --> 00:07:04.380
Anything else you want
to see us do with Orbeez?

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.280
Anything else you want to see
us film inside the microwave?

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.622
Let us know down
in the comments.

00:07:08.622 --> 00:07:09.887
We've got a couple minutes.

00:07:09.887 --> 00:07:11.950
We're going to take
some time and do some Q&amp;A

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:13.051
Jasmine Higgins asks,

00:07:13.051 --> 00:07:15.672
are you getting closer
to getting a female co-host?

00:07:16.472 --> 00:07:17.422
Yes.

00:07:17.422 --> 00:07:19.752
I don't know if we'll keep
that in but...

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:25.080
Shalayla Wesh....

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.680
I think that's the name here.

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.750
Shalayla Wesh asks,

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:30.122
"Why is it on some
of the videos you list

00:07:30.122 --> 00:07:33.800
where to get certain items for
a project, but not all the items?

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.900
Like the magic faucet.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.580
You listed

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.950
where to get everything
except the clear tubing.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.264
That would be a fun
project to try, but not

00:07:40.264 --> 00:07:41.732
if I can't get the parts."

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.660
We do try.

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:43.640
When it's a project build,

00:07:43.642 --> 00:07:46.053
and we're trying to give sort
of instructions on how you

00:07:46.053 --> 00:07:47.303
can complete the project.

00:07:47.303 --> 00:07:49.900
We tried to give instructions
and where to get everything.

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.526
The real answer
there is probably

00:07:51.526 --> 00:07:53.000
that sometimes I just forget.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.615
In the case
of that plastic tubing,

00:07:55.615 --> 00:07:57.230
where did I get that?

00:07:57.230 --> 00:08:00.350
I got that at
a specialty plastics store–

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.300
that happened to be about
two miles from where I live.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:05.700
That was after ordering
some clear plastic tubing

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.100
on Amazon that...

00:08:07.100 --> 00:08:09.200
I got tubing on Amazon.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.620
It ended up being just

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.140
a little bit too big, then I went
to the plastic store,

00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.080
and they said

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.240
that they could get it for me
like the next day,

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.900
so I was like,

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:19.750
"Oh, that's even faster
than Amazon Prime!"

00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:22.138
And Amazon Prime had
the smaller tubing...

00:08:22.138 --> 00:08:24.238
Sorry, Amazon had
the smaller tubing but it

00:08:24.238 --> 00:08:25.612
wasn't available with Prime.

00:08:25.612 --> 00:08:26.977
So it was gonna be
like five days.

00:08:26.977 --> 00:08:27.918
So I was like,

00:08:27.918 --> 00:08:29.718
"Okay, so I'll just
get it from them."

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:30.360
And then,

00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:32.640
it ended up taking them
like five days anyway, but...

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.250
So the real answer is

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:38.225
that sometimes I forget
and that you should go

00:08:38.225 --> 00:08:43.050
to reddit.com/R/TheKingofRandom
and make a post saying,

00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:44.368
"Hey, where did you get this?"

00:08:44.368 --> 00:08:45.950
And I checked
that pretty regularly,

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.750
and I'm likely
to see that question

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.350
and answer it for you.

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:52.420
So yeah, it's I forget and...

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:54.120
Just search on the internet

00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:57.040
because that's
how I find things.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:57.980
I look online.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:08:59.440
If I look online and I see

00:08:59.450 --> 00:09:01.000
that it's available
at a local store,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.100
off to the local store
because it's faster.

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:05.602
If I looked online and I
don't see it anywhere local,

00:09:05.602 --> 00:09:06.950
then I order it from online.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:08.582
User Paul Sun says

00:09:08.582 --> 00:09:11.980
"How do you upload daily
with very hard projects?"

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.940
I think we've answered
pretty similar to this before.

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.200
We have a team,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:17.479
so I don't have to come up
with all the ideas myself.

00:09:17.479 --> 00:09:18.950
I have Grant help with that,

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:21.912
and I talked with Grant about
how best to present the ideas.

00:09:21.912 --> 00:09:23.030
I have a cameraman.

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:24.450
I have a team of editors.

00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:25.911
I have an animator.

00:09:25.923 --> 00:09:27.000
And so it's...

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000
That's how we're able
to do is we have enough people

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.350
that lightens the workload,

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:33.618
so no one person
is bogged down too heavily.

00:09:33.618 --> 00:09:34.690
So it does make it

00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.282
so we're able to put
out five videos a week.

00:09:37.282 --> 00:09:39.517
We actually don't
usually do every day.

00:09:39.517 --> 00:09:40.947
Most of the time we do five,

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:43.650
and then sometimes we have
like a little bonus month

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:45.630
where we'll do a video
every day for that month.

00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:46.572
Stuff like that.

00:09:46.572 --> 00:09:47.884
That's the Q&amp;A for today.

00:09:47.884 --> 00:09:50.131
If you've got more Q's,
send 'em our way.

00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:51.200
We will A them.

00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:54.392
Hey guys, you probably noticed
that since we introduced Callie

00:09:54.392 --> 00:09:56.330
and our Captain
America shield video,

00:09:56.330 --> 00:09:58.215
every new video
has had secret codes

00:09:58.215 --> 00:10:01.500
and graphic glitches and other
secret elements hidden into it.

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:02.800
Keep track of what you see

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.750
in the time stamps
of when you see it.

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.758
We've got some big
prizes to give away,

00:10:06.758 --> 00:10:09.582
and finding the codes
might make you our next winner.

00:10:09.582 --> 00:10:10.222
