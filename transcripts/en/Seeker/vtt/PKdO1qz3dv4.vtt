00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.650
Women go through a world of changes during
pregnancy...hormones fluctuate, organs move

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.380
and shift, and for many women, their libidos
go into overdrive with some saying their orgasms

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:11.220
are the best they’ve ever had…

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.090
But is sex during pregnancy safe for mom and
baby?

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.150
Hey it’s Natalia Reagan for DNews!

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.960
We got this great question from ---- on Reddit
who asked “Does having sex while you're

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.850
pregnant affect a baby's health or personality?”

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:27.850
This is ---- SECOND question, so excellent
job on keeping us employed!

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:28.850
And everyone else, please send us your questions!

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.279
First, there have been no scientific studies
on if sex affects a baby’s personality,

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.650
maybe just ask your parents.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.110
But, we can answer the question of if it’s
safe for mother and child.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.149
First let’s talk about what happens during
pregnancy and how the baby is protected from

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.829
the world at large, including a prodding penis.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.500
A fetus develops in an amniotic sac filled
with fluid inside a woman’s uterus.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.149
This resides behind the cervix at the end
of the vaginal canal.

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:56.270
About a month into pregnancy a thick, gelatinous
mucus plug is formed and fills the cervical

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.510
canal and contains anti-bodies to protect
the fetus from infection.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.340
Thus, no matter the size of your tallywacker,
the fetus is well-protected.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.049
Which is a good thing, because studies show
women get extra randy while there’s a bun

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.049
in the oven.

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.520
In a report from “The Journal of Sexual
Medicine”, 40% of women interviewed said

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.380
their sex drive increased since getting pregnant.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.259
Which again, might be a good thing because
not only is it safe, there are actual health

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:19.209
benefits to boning down.

00:01:19.209 --> 00:01:23.679
Doctors have reported that sex during pregnancy
can have a calming effect, help women fall

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:25.850
asleep, AND lower blood pressure.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.039
And some women have even confessed that they’ve
experienced more intense orgasms while pregnant.

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.969
These O-mazing climaxes are thought to be
because the pelvic region is more sensitive

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.990
and engorged in blood during pregnancy.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.740
Additionally, during orgasms there is an extra
release of oxytocin, AKA the love or cuddle

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.170
hormone.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.299
Oxytocin has been shown to help build trust
in relationships so getting busy can also

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.560
strengthen bonds between partners during an
already stressful time.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.829
And it’s not just the act of sex, it’s
also the byproduct that can be helpful.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.249
A study done in Denmark found that a unique
protein in semen could actually help reduce

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:04.460
a woman’s risk of developing pre-eclampsia,
a potentially fatal illness that affects 3-5%

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.039
of pregnant women.

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.979
The illness develops when the placenta doesn’t
get enough blood.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.459
The seminal protein helps to regulate the
body’s immune system, thus lowering rates

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:14.459
of preeclampsia.

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.280
Now, in the past there had been concerns that
having sex while pregnant would potentially

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.900
induce preterm labor.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.250
And while the release of endogenous oxytocin
and the pro-taglandins in semen do aid in

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.219
the ripening of the cervix, there’s no evidence
that sex directly affects the Bishop score,

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:35.260
which is the scale used to determine if the
cervix is ready for vaginal delivery.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.430
Even though sex while pregnant has many benefits,
there are instances when abstaining from intercourse

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.130
is recommended, particularly when it’s during
a high risk pregnancy.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.510
Women who have previously gone into early
labor, or if their water has already broken,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.790
as well as those who have a compromised cervix,
placenta previa or have a herpes outbreak

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.200
or feel one coming onare warned to abstain
from sex.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.769
Obviously this is different from woman to
woman and if you have any questions about

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.959
safety, just talk to your doctor.

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.360
Despite these potential complications, pregnancy
sex is considered safe, fun, and beneficial

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.549
for most women- so get to it!

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:11.239
Just because you’re housing a nutrient sucking
parasite doesn’t mean you’re shouldn’t

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:16.310
be scragging, screwing, bumping uglies, whittling
the love branch, sticking the llama’s head

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:23.269
up the lift shaft, jamming the clam, thacking
the ferret, laying pipe, bending her over

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:32.120
a barrel and showing her the fifty states,
gallivanting in the Bridget’s bushes, or

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.379
making love…

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.900
What do you think?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.131
