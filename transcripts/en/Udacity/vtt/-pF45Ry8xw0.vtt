00:00:03.642 --> 00:00:08.141
Now let's see how the definition of
a problem maps onto the root founding

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:08.740
domain.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.660
First, the initial state we're given.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.536
Let's say we start of in Arad.

00:00:15.536 --> 00:00:20.163
And the goal test,
let's say that the state of being in

00:00:20.163 --> 00:00:24.580
Bucharest is the only state
that counts as a goal.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.000
And all other states are not goals.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:32.180
Now the set of all the states here
is known as the states space.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.436
And we navigate the states
space by applying actions.

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:39.200
The actions are specific to each city.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.240
So when we're in Arad,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.200
there are three possible actions, to
follow this road, this one, or this one.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.740
And as we follow them we build paths or
sequences of actions.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.250
So just being in Arad is
the path of length zero.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.580
And now we could start
exploring the space and

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.590
add in this path of length one.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.600
This path of length one and
this path of length one.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.020
We can add in another path,
here of length two and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.720
another path here of length two.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.730
Here's another path of length two.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:25.400
Here's a path of length three,
another path of length two, and so on.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.870
Now at every point, we want to separate
the state out into three parts.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.280
First, the ends of the paths,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.660
the farthest paths that have been
explored, we call the frontier.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.790
And so
the frontier in this case consists

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.450
of these states and
are the furthest out we can explore.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.710
And then,
to the left of that in this diagram,

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.670
we have the explored part of the state.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.850
And then off to the right
we have the unexplored.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.704
So let's write down
those three components.

00:02:08.704 --> 00:02:12.865
We have the frontier,

00:02:12.865 --> 00:02:21.194
we have the unexplored region,
and we have.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.037
Explored region.

00:02:25.037 --> 00:02:27.520
One more thing.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:33.350
In this diagram, we've labeled the step
cost of each action along the route.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.490
So the step cost of
going between Neamt and

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:42.610
Iasi would be 87, corresponding
to a distance of 87 kilometers.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.590
And then the path cost is just
the sum of the step cost.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.200
So the cost of the path of
going from Arad to Oradea

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.654
would be 71 plus 75.
