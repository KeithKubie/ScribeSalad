00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.901
(crowd yelling)

00:00:01.901 --> 00:00:02.902
- People! People please!

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:04.337
I know you're all upset.

00:00:04.337 --> 00:00:07.941 align:start size:88% position:13%
As you all know, at 6:15
PM yesterday evening,

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:12.345
a train derailed and hit a
man named Jamaal Crenshaw,

00:00:12.345 --> 00:00:14.381
killing him instantly.

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:18.084
Now, I know that safety is
your number one concern,

00:00:18.084 --> 00:00:20.120
which is why we decided

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.290
to temporarily suspend train
432 from operational status.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.260
(crowd yelling)

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:28.728
- This is outrageous!

00:00:28.728 --> 00:00:30.497
- I don't know about y'all,
but the way I was raised

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:32.232
if you don't wanna
get hit by a train,

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.634
don't take the steps
to get hit by a train.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:35.902
- What?

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:37.370
- I stand near the
tracks all the time

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.339
and trains never
fly off and hit me.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.041
- It's interesting you
should bring that up,

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.942 align:start size:81% position:19%
because a study
was just conducted

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:46.846 align:start size:94% position:6%
that said people like
Jamaal are approximately,

00:00:46.846 --> 00:00:48.948
let me get this number right,

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:52.185 align:start size:84% position:16%
one billion times
more likely to get hit

00:00:52.185 --> 00:00:56.056
by a malfunctioning train
than someone like you.

00:00:56.056 --> 00:00:57.223
- We don't want data!

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:58.491
We want answers!

00:00:58.491 --> 00:00:59.993
- Look, we have a video
of it hitting the man.

00:00:59.993 --> 00:01:01.795
- We don't know what happened
before that video started.

00:01:01.795 --> 00:01:03.296
(crowd agreeing)

00:01:03.296 --> 00:01:06.332
- We are suspending the
train, and that is final!

00:01:06.332 --> 00:01:07.834
An innocent man was killed!

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.335
- Innocent, huh?

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:12.439
Well I don't believe he's
so innocent, after all!

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:13.273
Age 19:

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:15.508
Jaywalkin'!

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:16.743
(crowd gasps)

00:01:16.743 --> 00:01:17.577
Age 22: Litterin'!

00:01:17.577 --> 00:01:19.612
(crowd gasps)

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:21.181
Age 23: Jaywalkin' again!

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.382
(crowd yells)

00:01:22.382 --> 00:01:25.718
Mr. Man, this man is
possessed by the devil!

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:27.487 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Are you saying that
this man deserved

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:28.588
to get hit by a train
because he committed

00:01:28.588 --> 00:01:30.490
a few misdemeanors?

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.724
- You hate trains!

00:01:31.724 --> 00:01:33.159
(crowd yells in agreement)

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.129 align:start size:81% position:19%
- No I don't! I
don't hate trains!

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:39.265
Look. Ignoring the fact
is not helping anyone

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:40.500
in this situation.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.869
We need to learn
from the situation.

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.003
Y'know, work together,

00:01:44.003 --> 00:01:45.505
and move forward.

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:48.174
If we can institute
some sort of policy

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:49.576
make some changes,

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:51.711
then maybe, just maybe,

00:01:51.711 --> 00:01:55.882
less black people will be shot
by the police for no reason!

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:58.485
- Who's getting shot?

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:00.954
- Big city, smart lookin'...

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.021
- Nevermind.
