the question of nature and nurture is I
wouldn't call it settled but I would put

it like this we are all born with a
 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.290
it like this we are all born with a
genetic inheritance and that genetic

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300
genetic inheritance and that genetic
 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.319
genetic inheritance and that genetic
inheritance sets boundaries on what we

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:22.329
inheritance sets boundaries on what we
 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.319
inheritance sets boundaries on what we

sense of establishing about one quarter

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:28.480
sense of establishing about one quarter
 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.210
sense of establishing about one quarter
of the variation of what we might become

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:30.220
of the variation of what we might become
 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.640
of the variation of what we might become
and that when it comes to intelligence

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:32.650
and that when it comes to intelligence
 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.130
and that when it comes to intelligence
or personality it's some minority of

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140
or personality it's some minority of
 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.380
or personality it's some minority of
what we could become and then against

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390
what we could become and then against
 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.479
what we could become and then against
that genetic background then our

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:39.489
that genetic background then our
 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.240
that genetic background then our
genetics and environment the experiences

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.250
genetics and environment the experiences
 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.009
genetics and environment the experiences
that we have and the nutrition that we

00:00:44.009 --> 00:00:44.019
that we have and the nutrition that we
 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:46.320
that we have and the nutrition that we
get interact with one another and that

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:46.330
get interact with one another and that
 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.670
get interact with one another and that
then shapes us over the course of

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680
then shapes us over the course of
 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.520
then shapes us over the course of
childhood and a lifetime and so most of

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530
childhood and a lifetime and so most of
 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.939
childhood and a lifetime and so most of
the variation is so most of the

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949
the variation is so most of the
 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.689
the variation is so most of the
variation turns out to be believed to be

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699
variation turns out to be believed to be
 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.890
variation turns out to be believed to be
environmentally induced or you know

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:58.900
environmentally induced or you know
 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.049
environmentally induced or you know
based on experience and so it's some

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059
based on experience and so it's some
 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.700
based on experience and so it's some
interplay between the two that makes us

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:02.710
interplay between the two that makes us
 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.899
interplay between the two that makes us
who we are

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909
 
 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.910
 
one thing that's interesting about child

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920
one thing that's interesting about child
 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.950
one thing that's interesting about child
development is that so much of it there

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
development is that so much of it there
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.330
development is that so much of it there
are so many changes that take place in

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340
are so many changes that take place in
 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.330
are so many changes that take place in
children's brains not only from birth to

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340
children's brains not only from birth to
 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.249
children's brains not only from birth to
the age of six is when people think of

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259
the age of six is when people think of
 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.990
the age of six is when people think of
brain change but also even through

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000
brain change but also even through
 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.219
brain change but also even through
childhood and into adolescence so one

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
childhood and into adolescence so one
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.020
childhood and into adolescence so one
thing that probably does not help is

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030
thing that probably does not help is
 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.330
thing that probably does not help is
passive experiences for the child and

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340
passive experiences for the child and
 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.680
passive experiences for the child and
the classic example of this is the

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690
the classic example of this is the
 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:32.300
the classic example of this is the
Mozart myth the idea that playing Mozart

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310
Mozart myth the idea that playing Mozart
 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.639
Mozart myth the idea that playing Mozart
or the classical music to a baby will

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649
or the classical music to a baby will
 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.560
or the classical music to a baby will
make the child smarter what seems to be

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570
make the child smarter what seems to be
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.870
make the child smarter what seems to be
important is active engagement so for

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880
important is active engagement so for
 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.980
important is active engagement so for
instance learning to play a musical

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
instance learning to play a musical
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.160
instance learning to play a musical
instrument is associated with improved

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
instrument is associated with improved
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.260
instrument is associated with improved
spatial reasoning and that seems to be

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270
spatial reasoning and that seems to be
 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.719
spatial reasoning and that seems to be
something that really helps a lot

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729
something that really helps a lot
 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.760
something that really helps a lot
another thing that helps is talking to

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770
another thing that helps is talking to
 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.380
another thing that helps is talking to
children it's been shown that there's a

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390
children it's been shown that there's a
 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.969
children it's been shown that there's a
positive relationship between the the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979
positive relationship between the the
 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.130
positive relationship between the the
number of words a child hears per day

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140
number of words a child hears per day
 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.190
number of words a child hears per day
and IQ scores and this is true even when

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
and IQ scores and this is true even when
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.980
and IQ scores and this is true even when
you correct for socioeconomic status and

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990
you correct for socioeconomic status and
 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.559
you correct for socioeconomic status and
so just simply speaking to a child

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:03.569
so just simply speaking to a child
 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:06.139
so just simply speaking to a child
playing with her talking with her that

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149
playing with her talking with her that
 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.749
playing with her talking with her that
kind of cognitive stimulation seems to

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
kind of cognitive stimulation seems to
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.699
kind of cognitive stimulation seems to
have a lasting positive effect on the

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709
have a lasting positive effect on the
 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.500
have a lasting positive effect on the
child's development and that's something

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510
child's development and that's something
 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.539
child's development and that's something
that that I think any parent can and

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549
that that I think any parent can and
 

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.580
that that I think any parent can and
should do

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590
 
 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.620
 
well it's certainly the case that some

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630
well it's certainly the case that some
 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:21.600
well it's certainly the case that some
people who are called geniuses have the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610
people who are called geniuses have the
 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.670
people who are called geniuses have the
ability to link unconnected ideas in

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680
ability to link unconnected ideas in
 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.740
ability to link unconnected ideas in
ways that other people can't see but one

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:25.750
ways that other people can't see but one
 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.570
ways that other people can't see but one
important fact of that that's sort of I

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580
important fact of that that's sort of I
 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.360
important fact of that that's sort of I
would call that isn't so romantic is

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370
would call that isn't so romantic is
 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.620
would call that isn't so romantic is
this idea that Gladwell talks about

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630
this idea that Gladwell talks about
 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.720
this idea that Gladwell talks about
which is just the hard work of having

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730
which is just the hard work of having
 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.130
which is just the hard work of having
all that information on hand and

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140
all that information on hand and
 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.110
all that information on hand and
developing expertise through thousands

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120
developing expertise through thousands
 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.150
developing expertise through thousands
and thousands of hours of practice we

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160
and thousands of hours of practice we
 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.580
and thousands of hours of practice we
talked earlier about Google making us

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590
talked earlier about Google making us
 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.699
talked earlier about Google making us
dumber well look if Google removes the

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709
dumber well look if Google removes the
 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.380
dumber well look if Google removes the
need for us to have all that knowledge

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390
need for us to have all that knowledge
 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.830
need for us to have all that knowledge
on hand and then that removes us from us

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840
on hand and then that removes us from us
 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.509
on hand and then that removes us from us
the ability to have these facts in our

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519
the ability to have these facts in our
 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.789
the ability to have these facts in our
heads on hand and so I think that this

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799
heads on hand and so I think that this
 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.650
heads on hand and so I think that this
is one area where we can think about

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660
is one area where we can think about
 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.090
is one area where we can think about
something that maybe gets lost a little

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100
something that maybe gets lost a little
 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.390
something that maybe gets lost a little
bit right geniuses are people who are in

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400
bit right geniuses are people who are in
 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.770
bit right geniuses are people who are in
many cases are people who have a lot of

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780
many cases are people who have a lot of
 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.890
many cases are people who have a lot of
information directly at their at their

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:04.900
information directly at their at their
 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.630
information directly at their at their
beck and call and they think about it

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640
beck and call and they think about it
 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.610
beck and call and they think about it
and they start putting it together so

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620
and they start putting it together so
 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.830
and they start putting it together so
you know one component of genius is

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840
you know one component of genius is
 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.650
you know one component of genius is
sticking together things in unexpected

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660
sticking together things in unexpected
 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.070
sticking together things in unexpected
ways

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080
ways
 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.839
ways
but another component is having those

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:15.849
but another component is having those
 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:18.089
but another component is having those
things to stick together right and I

00:03:18.089 --> 00:03:18.099
things to stick together right and I
 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.280
things to stick together right and I
think that there's a element of truth to

this idea of thousands of hours of
practice making a creative scientist or

practice making a creative scientist or
 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:27.720
practice making a creative scientist or
artist or writer or whatever it is that
