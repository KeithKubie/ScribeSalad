00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.550
Previously, we discussed how to
generate notifications on the phone,

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:04.640
like this here.

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.590
And how they're automatically
synchronized over to

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.400
the wearable device.

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.400
However, you might run into
a situation where you want to generate

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.070
a notification on a wearable,
but not on the phone.

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.850
This is not possible with the code
that we went through earlier.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.020
The solution to this,

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.000
is to create a notification on
the wearable device itself.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.680
If you create it on the wearable
from within the wearable APK,

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.680
it will only appear on the wearable.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.433
It is never synchronized
over to the phone.

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:36.162
A notification generated on a wearable
uses exactly the same code as done on

00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:37.260
the phone.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.730
You can use all the same code
that you did previously.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.440
I just wanted to point this all out now,
since you did not know

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.000
about wearable apps when we
previously discussed notifications.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.130
There are two great samples that you
should refer to in the sample browser.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:53.400
Synchronized notifications is the first
and notifications is the other.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.050
In synchronized notifications,
let's load that one up.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.140
Input sample and
synchronize notifications.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.230
It's in the wearable project in
notification updateservice.java.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.840
The method we're looking for
is BuildWearableOnlyNotification.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.880
In this method you can see the code
used to make a notification

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.880
is exactly the same as
what you've seen before.
