Hey Anthony.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.420
How is project compass coming along.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.150
&gt;&gt; It's going really well actually.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.430
I just finished my front end and

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.590
I even managed to integrate
the google maps API.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:12.900
Great job.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.850
So what's your next step?

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:15.450
&gt;&gt; Well.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.980
I was thinking I want to start adding
pictures of the places I've been to.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.100
That's a great idea.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.010
So if you do this one of two ways.

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.800
You can hard code images into your HTML,
or

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.440
you can create a database to
store thousands of images.

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.680
&gt;&gt; Well I definitely want to add as
many pictures as I possibly can.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.410
&gt;&gt; Sounds like that will require some
knowledge on back end programming.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:34.760
Let's check it out.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.710
Have you ever thought about what happens
when you post data to the internet?

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.840
Like a SaaS update?

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.760
We take for granted that our
content actually shows up.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.930
Like, how does that happen?

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.230
Process that occurs behind the scenes
requires interactions between clients.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.350
Which is your device or
computer and servers.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.990
A gigantic computer that processes data.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.560
Whenever I log into my Twitter account,
my account is the client.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.620
And I'm interacting
with Twitter servers.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.990
When I compose a tweet and
click this button.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.520
I'm creating a post request.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.590
It's as if the twitter bird
carried my tweet to their servers.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.780
My tweet is then saved
in the Twitter database.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.470
And then sent back to my computer and
loaded on my twitter feed.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.820
This is a post request,
I'm creating content in data and

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.240
posting it to Twitter's database.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.050
Their servers then return
it back to my browser.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.680
Whenever I see my Twitter feed with all
the tweets I've created in the past.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.970
I'm creating a get request and getting
all the data from Twitter server.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.100
When I go to my Twitter home page.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.900
I'm creating a get requests to get all
the tweets associated with my account.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.500
It's then sent back to my computer and

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.390
all of those sweets
are loaded on my browser.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.919
This is a get request because Iâ€™m
getting all the data associated with my

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.520
account and
retrieving it back to my browser.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.400
Understand that the client server model
is essential for backend programmers.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.040
Okay, that was a lot of information.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.750
Let's just take a moment to
review posts and get requests.
