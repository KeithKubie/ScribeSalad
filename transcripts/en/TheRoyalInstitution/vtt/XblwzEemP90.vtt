00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.240
You mentioned the various
types of accelerators

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.996
such as the proton-proton,
proton-electron,

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:17.790
electron-positron.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.430
What are the differences
between those?

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.470
What will they do for you?

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.510
Quite apart from the technology,
what does the proton-proton

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:31.420
do for you as opposed to
electron-positron and so on?

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.837
Yeah, would you
like to take that?

00:00:32.837 --> 00:00:33.336
Yeah.

00:00:33.336 --> 00:00:33.870
Yeah.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.940
OK, so is the mic on?

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.410
Yeah, OK.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.450
I mean, in a way there isn't
really a dispute among those,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.230
I think, because the
different facilities

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.480
that have been discussed
here have different pluses

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.250
and minuses in terms
of their ability

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:50.640
to attack new physics,
which is what we're really

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.910
trying to get at.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.800
And so they're
complementary in many ways.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.150
So, as Frank
correctly said, it's

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.280
easy to accelerate
protons compared

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.930
with electrons or
positrons in a big ring

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.440
because they don't
emit synchrotron

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.564
radiation in the same way
because they're much more

00:01:06.564 --> 00:01:07.420
massive.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.790
The problem is-- so you
can get proton beams

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.050
to very high energies.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.130
But when you slam
protons into one another,

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.070
protons are not
elementary particles,

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.080
they're bags of
quarks and gluons.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.400
And so a little
bit of one proton

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.490
will hit a little
bit of another proton

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.230
and they will scatter
from one another.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.200
So although you have a
very high beam energies,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.310
the energies of the
interacting particles

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.890
typically are very much lower
than the maximum beam energy

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.025
available because it's a
bit of one proton that's

00:01:39.025 --> 00:01:40.150
hitting a bit of the other.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.680
And then you have the rest of
the proton which causes a mess.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.340
So, in fact, the
center of mass energy

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.410
of a proton-proton machine,
the effective center

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.610
of mass energy, is not
as high as the beam

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:51.010
energy written on the tin.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.680
It's roughly an
order of magnitude

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.960
lower than the notional
twice the beam energies.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.630
And then you have a
lot of background,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.890
but you can get the beams to
really high energies using

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:02.970
that technique.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.730
With electrons and
positrons there's

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.940
a fundamental point
like particles.

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.139
And so when an electron
and positron annihilate

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:10.570
you just get the energy.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.950
That energy condenses
into the new things.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.900
You know everything
about the collisions

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.780
because the momentum
is zero and you

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.900
can measure the energies
of the beams coming in.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.690
And so you have complete
understanding of the kinematics

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.990
of these interactions.

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.180
And so when you make Higgs
particles, for example,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.250
there's the Higgs boson and the
zed boson in the final state

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.240
and nothing else.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.290
So from an experimental
point of view,

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.400
they're really quite
complementary ways

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.841
of attacking the physics.

00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:38.090
And, of course, the physics
is the same for all of us.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.110
It's the physics of top
quarks, Higgs boson,

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.220
dark matter, supersymmetry, or
whatever it may be out there.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.740
So is that a sort
of a first clue

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.246
as to some of the differences
in what these things do,

00:02:51.246 --> 00:02:53.620
the pluses and minuses of all
these different techniques.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.460
So I sometimes say
with that as well

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.190
that the hadron
machines are kind

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.240
of discovery machines because
of that mix up of momentum.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.420
You can get all kinds
of stuff flying out.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.330
Whereas the electron and muon
machines may be more precision

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.620
machines, is that?

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.800
Another analogy, I don't
know if it's helpful,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.180
is that these very high
energy proton-proton machines,

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.977
they're instruments which give
you a very broad field of view.

00:03:17.977 --> 00:03:20.310
So there's a lot going on,
and you have a big landscape,

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.900
and you get a look
at the landscape.

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.649
And then when you've
realized that there's

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:26.370
a mountain in the distance
in the landscape, a Higgs

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.060
boson for example,
you want to home

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.880
in with a precision microscope.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.060
And that's where an electron
positron machine is exactly

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.560
the instrument you want to make
Higgs bosons and nothing else.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.740
Could I just-- could I make?

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.910
Yes, go ahead.

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.760
So this is absolutely
correct, of course.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.530
Just two points to
pick up at the end.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.730
So once you've
scanned the landscape,

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.450
it can be that the nature
that you're looking at

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.010
has a particle in it which has
a quantum number of an electron

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.890
as well as a quantum
number of a quark.

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.220
And that would be
a real motivation

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.280
for doing an electron
proton collider,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.360
because you're putting
those two things together

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.040
and you see what comes out.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.020
In the muon case you've
got one extra piece which

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.040
is that it makes neutrinos.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.910
There isn't a theory that
describes the neutrino,

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.548
and therefore you are studying--
using the neutrinos directly

00:04:14.548 --> 00:04:16.089
you are studying
physics which is not

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:19.769
described in the standard
theory, the standard model.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.680
So you have a path
there that you can now

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.920
articulate where you can
start small and grow big.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.154
So that's an extra piece.

00:04:27.154 --> 00:04:29.710
OK.

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.990
Yep, there's a lot more
questions popping up.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.665
I think this gentleman was first
if we can have the microphone

00:04:34.665 --> 00:04:36.470
over to this side.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:37.750
Thank you.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:41.010
Yeah, thanks very much
for the great talks.

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:43.750
In the battle between the
linear and the circular collider

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.280
between Frank and Phil.

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.670
Complementary battle, which is--

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:52.750
Obviously there is a
technological barrier in terms

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.600
of the superconducting magnets.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.155
Frank did mention it
in passing that there

00:04:58.155 --> 00:04:59.780
has been some sort
of proof of concept,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.895
but really that's not
completely sorted out yet.

00:05:02.895 --> 00:05:04.270
And you will need--
there will be

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.270
need to be a technological
shift in the magnets

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:11.360
to get them to the higher,
to 100 kilometers in terms

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.950
of scale.

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:13.960
And I wonder whether
if, again Phil,

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.570
is the ILC ready, effectively,
technologically, ready to go?

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:21.510
Could we, apart from
funding, obviously,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.620
are we ready to look at the
Higgs mechanism with that?

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.920
So, maybe I'll let Frank
address the magnet question

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.880
quickly first.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.360
And then maybe Phil--

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.920
We are quite lucky
with the magnets

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.870
because we have the
high luminosity LHC

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.860
upgrade which I showed which
will come in the early 2020s.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.600
And for that upgrade
we need about 40

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.320
superconducting magnets based
on the new technology already.

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.910
Not with 16 Tesla field,
but around 12 Tesla field.

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.680
So that will be a rather large
scale use of such magnets

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.296
already as the next
step of the LHC upgrade.

00:05:53.296 --> 00:05:54.670
And that will be
the step that is

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:57.770
needed to go from there to
the production of thousands

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.560
of magnets for
the next collider.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.420
But we will use several
tens of these magnets

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.780
in the upgrade of the LHC.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.180
And that is an approved project.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.250
And the prototypes,
they're working beautifully

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.420
with a peak field
above 12 Tesla.

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:13.360
So by the time that
project's done,

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:16.710
that technology is demonstrated
that that's ready, right?

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.780
Not at 16 Tesla, but--

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:19.980
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:23.310
But it's a new technology that
is demonstrated at 50% higher

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:24.970
fields than the LHC magnets.

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.460
So that's a very important
step in the evolution

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:28.940
to the next collider.

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:32.050
So about the technology
readiness of ILC?

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.690
We promised Suzie
that there would

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:35.626
be no fisticuffs on stage.

00:06:35.626 --> 00:06:36.334
They promised me.

00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:36.917
Not on camera.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.730
So we will maintain that rule.

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:42.944
But you may have wondered about
the order of the presentations.

00:06:42.944 --> 00:06:44.860
And they were, of course,
ordered in maturity.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.939
[LAUGHTER] So that
is to say that--

00:06:46.939 --> 00:06:48.480
Of the technology,
not the presenter.

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.740
The maturity of the
technology, not the maturity

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.050
of the speaker.

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:57.490
So the international linear
collider has a 10% scale

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.950
model prototype that is
sitting there in Hamburg

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.360
that has been built.
The technology

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.160
has been built in industry,
mainly European industry,

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.250
as a matter of fact.

00:07:07.250 --> 00:07:09.120
It's not magnets
in this case, it's

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.650
the superconductor
niobium radio frequency

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.030
accelerating technologies,
the things that we

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.900
need to provide the 30
odd megavolts per meter

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.140
that Stuart introduced to
actually get the particles up

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.120
to high energies.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.930
There are a hundred of these
modules sitting in a two

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.800
kilometer tunnel in Hamburg.

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.310
They'll be beaming that machine
by the end of this year.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:32.530
That is roughly 1/16 of the
entire number of modules

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:36.110
that we would need to do the
real international linear

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.690
collider.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:37.780
It's there.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.400
It's ready to turn on.

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.070
It's a 10% scale model,
the technological issues

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:44.530
have been solved, the technology
has been industrialized.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.140
So we really believe that
that is a shovel ready project

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.310
and we are waiting for
our Japanese colleagues,

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:52.680
hopefully, to give
the green light.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.260
OK, there was another question
up the back on that side,

00:07:55.260 --> 00:07:56.051
as well, over here.

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:10.240
Thank you for a very
interesting talk.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:12.110
I've got two questions.

00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:15.957
One, if muons are so
great, why not use taus?

00:08:15.957 --> 00:08:16.540
Good question.

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:21.960
And two, the plasma thing,
can you actually get something

00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.580
from one end to the other
without it hitting something

00:08:24.580 --> 00:08:25.700
in the middle?

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:27.980
Or is that one of the problems?

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.240
Let's tackle those one
at a time, shall we?

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.170
So why not taus, Ken?

00:08:31.170 --> 00:08:37.230
So the tau is heavier,
1.7 GeV or so,

00:08:37.230 --> 00:08:41.080
compared to the muon
which has 106 MeV.

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.290
So it's an order of
magnitude or more different.

00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.550
The rate of decay is going
at some power of the mass.

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:55.500
So the lifetime of a tau is way
smaller than it is of a muon.

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.550
And then because it's heavy it's
also more difficult to produce.

00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:00.850
So you get a lower rate
when you produce them,

00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:03.250
and they decay
more quickly, which

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.200
means that the intensity of
the beam decays more quickly.

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:09.450
So much, much harder.

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:12.550
There's one more disad--
so the advantages

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:14.800
you would get in the synchrotron
radiation all of that

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.340
would be better because
they are heavier.

00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:20.160
The disadvantages,
because it's so heavy

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:22.280
it decays into all
sorts of things.

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.304
So you cannot do the neutrino
science with it because it

00:09:26.304 --> 00:09:27.470
decays into too many things.

00:09:27.470 --> 00:09:30.650
So you don't get the
clean [INAUDIBLE] beam

00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:33.950
out of the tau.

00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:38.390
OK, the second half of that
is, the question was, kind of,

00:09:38.390 --> 00:09:40.310
can you get a beam
out of the thing

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:43.060
without ruining
your accelerator?

00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:44.890
Is that, kind of, the question?

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:46.680
Yeah, I'm getting a nod.

00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:49.800
Well, so you were talk-- maybe I
could paraphrase your question,

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.370
which is if we can make
something that's got a 10,000

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:55.290
megavolts per meter, why don't
I just make a meter long plasma

00:09:55.290 --> 00:09:56.990
accelerator and--

00:09:57.152 --> 00:09:57.860
We'll go on home.

00:09:57.860 --> 00:09:59.730
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:04.450
So there are some real
problems with that, actually.

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:10.780
Not problems, but-- one is-- so
the way that's been done so far

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:14.970
is to drive this, to create a
wave that the charged particles

00:10:14.970 --> 00:10:17.671
can surf on inside the plasma.

00:10:17.671 --> 00:10:19.170
And to do that you
need to, sort of,

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:21.080
send something
through the plasma

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:22.560
to create a wave in its wake.

00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:24.030
That's why it's
called a wakefield,

00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:25.927
it's traveling
behind the driver.

00:10:25.927 --> 00:10:27.510
And so one of the
most successful ways

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.680
that that's been done so
far is using a laser pulse

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:30.480
to drive it.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:33.066
Now, these relativistic
particles all

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:34.690
travel at basically
the speed of light.

00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:38.140
So it's 99.9999% of
the speed of light.

00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:41.540
The problem with
a laser is as soon

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.404
as you put a light
which travels in vacuum

00:10:44.404 --> 00:10:46.820
at the speed of light, as soon
as you put it into a medium

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:49.160
it travels a little bit slower
than the speed of light.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:51.850
And so when I do that in a
laser plasma accelerator,

00:10:51.850 --> 00:10:55.240
my driver is traveling a
little bit slower, maybe

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:57.320
99.9% of the speed of light.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:58.230
So pretty close.

00:10:58.230 --> 00:11:03.690
But that difference
between 99.9% 99.99999%

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:07.330
is enough that the electrons
are actually traveling faster

00:11:07.330 --> 00:11:10.270
than the wave which goes at the
same speed as the laser pulse.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.950
And so just like a
surfer on a water wave

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.934
starts at the top of the wave
and ends up at the bottom,

00:11:15.934 --> 00:11:17.350
and once he's got
to the bottom he

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:19.920
can't gain any
more energy, that's

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:22.790
exactly what happens in a
laser driven plasma wave.

00:11:22.790 --> 00:11:24.730
So we start at the
top of the potential

00:11:24.730 --> 00:11:26.600
and we really drift down it.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:31.420
And once we get to that point,
we can't get any more energy.

00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.910
And so the maximum
energy that people

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:36.920
are getting per in a single
stage of acceleration

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.920
is limited by that process.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:42.590
So that's why even though it's
10,000 megavolts per meter,

00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:47.900
the limit is only 4 GeV in
less than 10 centimeters.

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:50.050
There are some ways
around this, there

00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:53.820
are some really key
ways around this.

00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.690
One of the most obvious ones
is you just build another one.

00:11:57.690 --> 00:12:00.680
OK, so you got to 4
GeV in 10 centimeters.

00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.561
Somehow you have
another laser pulse,

00:12:02.561 --> 00:12:04.060
and you have another
10 centimeters,

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.520
and you get up to 8 GeV,
and you keep doing that.

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:08.644
So you can do that, and
you can look at the numbers

00:12:08.644 --> 00:12:11.550
and still, as long as you
don't have too much space

00:12:11.550 --> 00:12:14.910
in between these modules, then
your average accelerating rate

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:19.490
is still much better than
the conventional ones.

00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:22.470
There are many issues with
that, many technical problems

00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:24.420
with that as well.

00:12:24.420 --> 00:12:28.090
Another way of doing this,
and this is quite cool,

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:31.830
I mentioned that we use lasers
to drive the plasma wave.

00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.330
But the problem with a laser
is it travels a little bit less

00:12:34.330 --> 00:12:35.600
than the speed of light.

00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:38.100
But a charged particle beam
at a high enough energy

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.640
is traveling at
the speed of light.

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:41.499
And actually as a
charged particle beam,

00:12:41.499 --> 00:12:43.540
if it's intense enough,
travels through a plasma,

00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.480
it also drives this
wave, this plasma wave,

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.980
that will accelerate it.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.480
And some very
successful experiments

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.630
have been done on SLAC
over the last 10 years

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:55.855
or so where they've used the
electron beam, and the positron

00:12:55.855 --> 00:12:57.230
beam for some of
the experiments,

00:12:57.230 --> 00:13:01.259
to drive a plasma
wave and accelerate

00:13:01.259 --> 00:13:02.300
some particles from that.

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.990
And they've been doing
some great stuff.

00:13:03.990 --> 00:13:05.760
One of the, sort of,
key headline results

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.370
happened a good
few years ago which

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:11.050
was where they took the--
before SLAC was turned

00:13:11.050 --> 00:13:15.970
into an x-ray machine-- they
took the 40 GeV electron beam,

00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:19.770
so it's gone all, it's got taken
two miles, it's got to 40 GeV,

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:23.430
then they put it into
a meter long plasma.

00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:25.350
That beam drove a plasma wave.

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.130
Most of that beam slowed down
because it's energy was lost

00:13:28.130 --> 00:13:29.430
into driving the plasma wave.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.894
But right at the back
of the plasma wave,

00:13:32.894 --> 00:13:35.060
the back of the beam was
sitting in the accelerating

00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:37.420
part of the plasma wave,
and it doubled in energy

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:39.350
in a plasma that was
just a meter long.

00:13:39.350 --> 00:13:43.270
So it took-- so really a few,
it wasn't a nice quality beam,

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:45.230
but it really demonstrated
that these plasma

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:46.640
waves have a huge potential.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.826
So two miles to
get up to 40 GeV,

00:13:48.826 --> 00:13:51.700
and another meter
to get up to 80 GeV.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.740
And so I think, I would say,
I'm a laser wakefield guy,

00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:58.890
that's what I
specialize in, but I

00:13:58.890 --> 00:14:00.600
don't want to put
too much money on it,

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.239
but I think if you really
want to go for the high energy

00:14:03.239 --> 00:14:04.780
frontiers, so the
particle colliders,

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:08.070
I think maybe the
beam driven stuff

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.397
has a bit of an edge on that.

00:14:10.397 --> 00:14:11.480
Hopefully that was useful.

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:14.590
OK, thanks.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:18.370
Are there more questions at
the moment coming from up here?

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:20.140
Yep, there's one right
at the back there.

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:32.500
Hi, thank you very
much for amazing talks.

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.210
I just had a question
for Professor Zimmerman.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:37.840
Sorry, it's late.

00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:43.616
You talk like accelerators
have expiry dates on them,

00:14:43.616 --> 00:14:45.490
as in they only last a
certain amount of time

00:14:45.490 --> 00:14:46.989
and then we have
to build a new one.

00:14:46.989 --> 00:14:48.530
I was just wondering
why is that?

00:14:48.530 --> 00:14:50.340
Does the technology
just become obsolete?

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.140
Or do they wear out and
become dangerous to use?

00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:56.120
Or, yeah, sorry, it's probably
a stupid question, but--

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:57.460
Did you get the question?

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.560
Yeah, it's why the
accelerators have a lifetime.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:04.080
Yes, so do they have a
physical lifetime, or is it

00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:06.470
something else is the
reason why we are wanting

00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:10.480
to continually build new ones?

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.762
To paraphrase your question.

00:15:11.762 --> 00:15:13.720
I guess the physics
program ends at some point.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:18.380
You deliver, you produce
a certain number of data

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.700
and you try to
increase the data rate

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.680
by improving the performance.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.530
And at some point
you reach a limit

00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:27.152
and then you are kind of
at the maximum performance.

00:15:27.152 --> 00:15:29.610
For example, limit could be
the cooling of the accelerator,

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.770
of the IF power.

00:15:32.770 --> 00:15:34.837
So you reach some
limit in intensity

00:15:34.837 --> 00:15:36.920
and a limit in the data
rate that you can produce.

00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:39.770
And then it becomes
uninteresting for the particle

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:40.800
physicists after awhile.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.060
If you collect 10 years
of data, then running

00:15:44.060 --> 00:15:46.650
another 10 years just
doubles the number of data,

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:48.770
so I guess it gives you,
in fact, a square root

00:15:48.770 --> 00:15:49.855
in the statistics.

00:15:49.855 --> 00:15:53.730
So at some point it
takes too much time

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:56.100
to improve the statistics.

00:15:56.100 --> 00:15:58.360
At that point you like to
have another accelerator.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:16:00.661
Either you improve the
performance by an upgrade,

00:16:00.661 --> 00:16:02.410
like the high luminosity
LHC, it gives you

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:05.280
a factor of 10 in the
data rate so that you

00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.640
can double the amount
of data in one year

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.370
or so instead of
waiting 10 years.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:14.727
And then, in the
end we have seen

00:16:14.727 --> 00:16:17.060
we have seen better get the
physics at that energy range

00:16:17.060 --> 00:16:18.380
and we like to go
to higher energy.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.880
It's more interesting for, at
least for the hadron collider,

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.716
it's more interesting to
go up in energy again.

00:16:24.716 --> 00:16:26.090
When you go up in
energy you also

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:27.950
produce a lot more
events at low energy

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:31.860
because you have these
constituents of quarks

00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:33.180
and gluons which collide.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:35.742
By going up in energy you
also produce a lot more Higgs

00:16:35.742 --> 00:16:36.700
particles, for example.

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:39.520
In fact some small
factor of energy

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:42.440
gives you one or two orders of
magnitude more Higgs particles

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:42.940
per second.

00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:47.360
So you gain in the energy reach,
and you also gain at low energy

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.180
when you include.

00:16:48.180 --> 00:16:49.510
I think Kevin was going to
jump in on that, as well--

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:51.593
There's also physical, by
the way, just to finish,

00:16:51.593 --> 00:16:52.985
there's also a physical limit.

00:16:52.985 --> 00:16:55.318
The collisions in the LHC,
in the large hadron collider,

00:16:55.318 --> 00:16:57.190
are quite intense.

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.030
And after 10 years
or so we will have

00:16:59.030 --> 00:17:00.840
destroyed the final
quadruples which

00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.200
are hit by the debris
from the collision point.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.121
So at that point we have to
replace these final quadruples,

00:17:06.121 --> 00:17:08.329
and the idea is that we
replace them with better ones

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:10.564
to improve the performance
at the same time,

00:17:10.564 --> 00:17:11.730
and not just build the old--

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:13.940
So there is kind of a
performance enhancing aspect

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.339
over time as you get
to know the machine,

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:18.630
but there are some physical
limitations as to how long.

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:20.255
There's also some
physical limitations.

00:17:20.255 --> 00:17:22.990
And luckily they happen
at about the same time.

00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:25.660
So we make an upgrade which
will give a higher data rate

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:30.014
and also will maintain the
functionality of the x-ray.

00:17:30.014 --> 00:17:31.680
The message I get is
that it's primarily

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.570
driven by the particle
physics needs, what

00:17:35.570 --> 00:17:38.540
the community actually wants
to look for in the data.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.110
That would be your
main motivation.

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:41.070
I mean, otherwise--

00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:43.440
Another limit, if
there is a competition.

00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.880
Like I showed you the
Tevatron collider in Chicago,

00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:48.810
it was turned off one year
after the LHC had turned

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:51.590
on because LHC was producing
at higher energy 10 times

00:17:51.590 --> 00:17:54.414
more data and there was
no reason to continue

00:17:54.414 --> 00:17:55.580
with the machine in Chicago.

00:17:55.580 --> 00:17:57.524
So it was not
competitive anymore.

00:17:57.524 --> 00:17:59.690
That could be another reason
to stop an accelerator.

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:04.440
The comment I wanted
to make-- so frank

00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:05.860
is, of course, completely right.

00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:11.150
However, the new thing
is often, or most often,

00:18:11.150 --> 00:18:13.640
built on what has
been there before.

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.960
So the LHC, for example, reuses
the whole proton accelerator

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:21.050
complex at CERN starting with
the proton synchrotron, which

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:24.200
was one of the first machines,
and using the other things.

00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:27.060
There are then limits
in operating those.

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:29.960
For example, the
technology is too old.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:35.560
So we have the jewels in the
accelerator activity in the UK

00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:40.600
that Stuart was mentioning
at Rutherford lab.

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:44.950
So ISIS, diamond, and
then of course the laser.

00:18:44.950 --> 00:18:47.290
Also in the north of England
the Daresbury Laboratory

00:18:47.290 --> 00:18:49.380
with the electron
accelerators there.

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.730
So ISIS actually is older,
no it's not older than me,

00:18:52.730 --> 00:18:55.890
but it has been going
global for longer

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:57.555
than I have been
going in science.

00:18:57.555 --> 00:19:02.679
And the early part of that is
now a problem of maintenance,

00:19:02.679 --> 00:19:05.220
because the things are not being
built. So that's one reason,

00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:07.206
those things have
to be upgraded if we

00:19:07.206 --> 00:19:09.580
want to do the great science
that is coming out of there.

00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:10.876
Can I pitch in at
this stage and say

00:19:10.876 --> 00:19:13.042
one of the short films you
made in this accelerators

00:19:13.042 --> 00:19:15.530
for humanity series that
Martin mentioned at the start

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:18.060
is actually about upgrading
that technology on ISIS.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:19.540
So do check it out afterwards.

00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:20.206
Sorry, continue.

00:19:20.206 --> 00:19:22.120
So the other thing that
we have to look at,

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.810
and the kind of
things that Stuart

00:19:23.810 --> 00:19:27.320
is doing as part of the solution
but not all of the solution,

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.130
is that the economics of doing
this science is changing.

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.870
And the copper and
the ways in which

00:19:33.870 --> 00:19:37.740
we create the accelerating
fields are quite energy greedy.

00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.990
They were created
in the '60s and '70s

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:43.120
when, perhaps, the cost of
electricity was different.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:45.030
And so there's a
whole theme there

00:19:45.030 --> 00:19:47.100
that we have to
get to grips with

00:19:47.100 --> 00:19:50.720
to reduce the running
costs of those machines.

00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.610
Really good point which has
spurred a whole lot more

00:19:53.610 --> 00:19:55.662
questions, it would appear.

00:19:55.662 --> 00:19:57.620
I didn't see who was
first, so I will come back

00:19:57.620 --> 00:19:59.880
over this side I
think if someone

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:01.980
could run a microphone down.

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:09.760
Yes, thank you.

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:12.310
Yes, perhaps just taking
up that point on economics,

00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:15.880
one of the great
improvements in technology

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.420
is obviously fusion reactors.

00:20:17.420 --> 00:20:19.740
And part of the off spin
of what you are doing

00:20:19.740 --> 00:20:23.540
is the technology to make
fusion reactors much better,

00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:25.480
and then the cost of
electricity to everyone

00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:27.840
goes down, of course.

00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:29.740
We were listening to
a lecture about ITER,

00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.860
I think, about
this time last year

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:35.560
and they were saying
fusion reactors are perhaps

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:36.360
20 years away.

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.140
Well, they've been
20, 25 years away

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:40.170
for the whole of my lifetime.

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:43.520
Is the technology
that, the engineering,

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.030
that goes behind the particle
physics and the expenditure

00:20:46.030 --> 00:20:49.290
on that has got this
tremendous offshoot

00:20:49.290 --> 00:20:52.184
to improve the engineering
of fusion reactors.

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:54.600
And I was wondering whether
the plasma one, in particular,

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.670
is an improvement on this.

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.000
So to me, just to interpret
that question, to me

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.260
the fusion reactors
and accelerators

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.479
are interrelated
physics, but sort

00:21:05.479 --> 00:21:06.770
of a slightly different stream.

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.120
Would you like to
tackle that one, Stuart?

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.900
Yeah, can I have a go?

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:15.780
So, my quick question would
be-- well not question,

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.420
but my first
thought would be how

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:21.120
do particle accelerators
directly impact on fusion.

00:21:21.120 --> 00:21:22.970
Well, there's a couple of ways.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:26.130
So one is-- so in a fusion
reactor-- as a plasma physicist

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:28.690
as well as an acceleration
physicist I go to one or two

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:32.070
seminars on fusion, as well.

00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:34.940
One of the things they do is
they fire a beam of particles

00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:38.820
into a fusion reactor to
make the plasma spin around

00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:40.550
and heat it.

00:21:40.550 --> 00:21:45.950
And so, actually the very
large fusion reactor ITER

00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:48.910
that's being built
in Bordeaux, there

00:21:48.910 --> 00:21:51.510
is an equally large
neutral beam accelerator

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.750
next to it, which is
quite interesting.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:55.600
Another thing that
particle accelerator

00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:58.620
is going to impact
on fusion reactors

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:05.360
is there is-- in fusion you
have a huge amount of neutron

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.976
flux hitting the
walls of the chamber

00:22:07.976 --> 00:22:11.940
and that gets damaged
because of radiation damage.

00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:14.390
And so there are people
looking at new materials

00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:16.605
to make the structures out of.

00:22:16.605 --> 00:22:18.230
And actually there
is, there are plans,

00:22:18.230 --> 00:22:21.127
I'm not sure where it's
going to happen or if,

00:22:21.127 --> 00:22:23.460
but there's a machine called
IFMIF which is specifically

00:22:23.460 --> 00:22:26.566
designed for testing materials
that are going to withstand

00:22:26.566 --> 00:22:28.690
really high radiation
fluctuations inside something

00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:29.750
like a fusion reactor.

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:31.730
So, yeah, there is a
crossover between those.

00:22:31.730 --> 00:22:33.281
I can add maybe something.

00:22:33.281 --> 00:22:33.780
Please do.

00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:35.340
Also, we have a strong
correlation between CERN

00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:37.400
and the ITER project, of
course, for cryogenics

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.300
and for the magnets.

00:22:38.300 --> 00:22:39.080
Yeah, absolutely.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.600
And, in fact, our
[INAUDIBLE] collider profits

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.690
from the magnet
development for ITER

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:45.750
because a superconductor
[INAUDIBLE]

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:48.110
was pushed for the
ITER fusion project.

00:22:48.110 --> 00:22:50.310
And 600 tons that
was the first mass

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.270
production of the
[INAUDIBLE] superconducter

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.910
we want to use for the FCC.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:58.550
So we're very lucky because now
these companies have produced

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:00.900
around the world
material for ITER,

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:04.840
and they are quite eager to now
join and produce superconducter

00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.710
for the accelerators, also.

00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:09.360
So we are lucky that we can
follow up on this production.

00:23:12.530 --> 00:23:13.030
Great.

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:16.440
So there was-- sorry, I
don't recall if this person--

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.550
was there one up here before?

00:23:18.550 --> 00:23:20.232
No, maybe it was
in the front here.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.150
I'll get you next,
yeah, thank you.

00:23:26.150 --> 00:23:27.870
Thank you.

00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:31.383
Suppose-- this is a sort of
antiaccelerator question--

00:23:31.383 --> 00:23:33.280
Oh, devil's advocate.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:36.330
Suppose I said to you that
I could give you some higher

00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.610
energy particles
without any accelerator.

00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.960
No energy use, you don't
have to build anything,

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.954
you don't need to dig up half of
Switzerland to build anything.

00:23:44.954 --> 00:23:46.620
But the only problem
is I can't tell you

00:23:46.620 --> 00:23:48.910
where it's going to arrive.

00:23:48.910 --> 00:23:51.710
So I'm talking
about cosmic rays.

00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:53.430
I know you're going
to say statistics,

00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:55.190
you won't get enough
of them, perhaps.

00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:57.340
But we can get higher
energy and you could just

00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:01.040
spend your money building
a big detector, perhaps.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.540
Is cosmic rays giving
you higher energy now,

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.980
are they at all
useful in this regard?

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.185
So maybe Phil would you like to?

00:24:08.185 --> 00:24:09.310
Thank you very much, Suzie.

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.060
You're welcome.

00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:14.042
I'm instructing,
but I'm not meant

00:24:14.042 --> 00:24:15.625
to be answering the
questions tonight.

00:24:15.625 --> 00:24:16.124
Sorry.

00:24:16.124 --> 00:24:17.545
That's OK.

00:24:17.545 --> 00:24:21.410
So, without doubt the
most powerful accelerators

00:24:21.410 --> 00:24:25.930
around are out there
in the universe.

00:24:25.930 --> 00:24:27.980
We don't understand
how they work.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:28.920
Probably plasmas.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:29.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:29.660 --> 00:24:37.470
Well, but they-- we can record
on Earth cosmic rays arriving

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:40.300
with incredible energies, I
think, what 10 to the-- I've

00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:42.340
forgotten what
the power is, now.

00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:43.810
16?

00:24:43.810 --> 00:24:46.060
17?

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:52.720
You know, electron
volts, 10 with 16 zeros

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:56.640
volts equivalent of
accelerated beam energy.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:24:59.330
And we don't really understand
how those particles are

00:24:59.330 --> 00:25:01.130
accelerated out
there in processes

00:25:01.130 --> 00:25:05.410
that are going on in
black holes, or whatever,

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.020
centers of galaxies, and so on.

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.330
But they certainly
arrive on Earth,

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.210
and there are detectors
on Earth which

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:14.240
measure the impact
of these cosmic rays.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:17.720
And so what we can do
is we can count them.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.710
OK, now that's
interesting at some level.

00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:21.210
And you can make
a graph, you know,

00:25:21.210 --> 00:25:23.810
of number of cosmic
rays versus energy.

00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:25.580
And, you know, it
plummets down like this,

00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:28.940
and you can see some interesting
features on the graph.

00:25:28.940 --> 00:25:31.411
But it starts to become
very tricky when you get

00:25:31.411 --> 00:25:32.660
to higher and higher energies.

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.949
Because the area of detectors
that you need to build in order

00:25:35.949 --> 00:25:37.490
to be sensitive to
the highest energy

00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:41.226
cosmic rays starts to become
tens of square kilometers.

00:25:41.226 --> 00:25:43.350
And that's, sort of, the
size of the biggest arrays

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:44.940
that we have on
Earth at the moment.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.800
They're of the order
of a few, 1 to 10,

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.280
square kilometers for
collecting information

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.020
from the cosmic
rays which basically

00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:53.610
amounts to counting them.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:25:55.190
I'm not saying that
isn't giving you

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:58.420
useful information about
the number of cosmic rays,

00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:00.050
of high energy
that are coming in.

00:26:00.050 --> 00:26:02.150
But that's not quite
the same as what

00:26:02.150 --> 00:26:05.650
we try to do in accelerators
which is to make particles

00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:09.120
in the lab, and measure
them in the lab,

00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:12.280
and understand their properties
in microscopic detail.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:15.610
So it's a really-- we're
limited in the energies

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:19.130
that we can do that by modern
technology, but what we can do

00:26:19.130 --> 00:26:20.990
is make powerful and
incisive measurements

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:23.940
and really learn things at the
microscopic level about what's

00:26:23.940 --> 00:26:25.330
happening.

00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.540
It's a bit trickier
to sit on the ground

00:26:27.540 --> 00:26:30.750
with a massive detector
counting these things coming in.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:33.140
And what you measure,
of course, are the sort

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.280
of secondary and
tertiary products

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:38.120
of these things hitting
atoms in the high atmosphere

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:40.830
and spraying products
onto the ground.

00:26:40.830 --> 00:26:45.440
So it's a bit harder to get at
this fundamental information

00:26:45.440 --> 00:26:47.300
by counting particles
that are coming

00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:50.180
in by mechanisms unknown
out there in the cosmos.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.480
So it's not-- it's
very valuable science,

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:54.840
but it's telling you
things about astrophysics

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.920
and what's happening
in galaxies, and stars,

00:26:56.920 --> 00:27:00.030
and energetic processes out
there in the universe more

00:27:00.030 --> 00:27:03.310
than the microscopics of what
matter is actually made of

00:27:03.310 --> 00:27:04.854
and what are the
forces that interact

00:27:04.854 --> 00:27:06.020
between the building blocks.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:07.940
So you could do it, but it would
give you different science,

00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:08.470
is that?

00:27:08.470 --> 00:27:10.400
It's complementary science.

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.280
The cosmic rays are
really telling you

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:14.500
about astrophysics, and
galaxies, and stars,

00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.490
and black holes.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.670
I think Ken, sorry, you were
going to pitch in at one point?

00:27:18.670 --> 00:27:21.460
Yeah, well I, but Frank also
wanted to say something.

00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.450
So was Frank.

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:27.070
If I member right, I think these
max, highest energy cosmic rays

00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:30.280
of energy, one EEV
which is, I forgot,

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.871
is something like 10 to the 20.

00:27:31.871 --> 00:27:33.120
I thought it was 10 to the 20.

00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:33.650
Maybe it's 10 to the 20.

00:27:33.650 --> 00:27:34.724
Yeah, it's a huge number.

00:27:34.724 --> 00:27:36.890
And they cannot have higher,
I think this is limited

00:27:36.890 --> 00:27:40.520
by interaction with the cosmic
microwave background scattering

00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:42.257
in outer space.

00:27:42.257 --> 00:27:44.090
But these particles,
when they hit the Earth

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:48.290
they hit some-- they can make
some reaction with a fixed

00:27:48.290 --> 00:27:49.520
target on the Earth.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.389
But the center of mass energy
in that collision, the energy

00:27:52.389 --> 00:27:54.180
available to put to
new particles, I think,

00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:57.970
is lower than the energy that
we have in the LHC proton proton

00:27:57.970 --> 00:27:59.081
collisions.

00:27:59.081 --> 00:28:01.080
I'm not sure that's true,
Frank, but never mind.

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:01.870
It's similar.

00:28:01.870 --> 00:28:02.820
We can work it out.

00:28:02.820 --> 00:28:04.010
It's not higher, no.

00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:05.860
If they hit the proton energy--

00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:08.235
If you've got a pen and paper
you can tell us at the end.

00:28:08.235 --> 00:28:10.106
--10 to the 12th, right?

00:28:10.106 --> 00:28:11.860
So, maybe it's
similar, it's similar.

00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.660
It's not much higher.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:17.150
And the rate is 10 to the
42 times-- of the flux-- 10

00:28:17.150 --> 00:28:18.750
to the 42 times low.

00:28:18.750 --> 00:28:20.720
Yeah, so you'd want to
build a new one, right,

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.200
so that you can get a higher--

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.741
With this I have
the ambition that we

00:28:23.741 --> 00:28:26.720
will develop accelerators
which can reach the same energy

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:27.560
as a cosmic ray.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.380
Yes, certainly that's
one of the goals.

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:31.570
We need 10, 8 orders of
magnitude to get there.

00:28:31.570 --> 00:28:35.601
Maybe with the plasmas we make
a big jump in that direction.

00:28:35.601 --> 00:28:38.670
With plasmas and crystals we can
get four orders of magnitude,

00:28:38.670 --> 00:28:41.030
then there's only another
four orders missing

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.080
to reach the cosmic rays.

00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:43.121
He's ambitions, isn't he.

00:28:46.307 --> 00:28:47.390
Sorry, you were going to--

00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:48.980
My comment was going
to be, actually

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:52.440
we are looking at the
cosmic ray sources.

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.160
So with the neutrinos there are
obviously three neutrinos, OK.

00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:58.973
So that means
there are two gaps.

00:28:58.973 --> 00:29:01.350
I've got three neutrinos,
I've got two gaps.

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.040
With the experiments
that I was talking about

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.850
you can measure the differences.

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:09.580
So we can tell that what
we call the second neutrino

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.220
is heavier than
the first, but we

00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:13.560
don't know if the
third is heavier

00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:16.329
or lighter than those two.

00:29:16.329 --> 00:29:18.370
Those measurements that
are made with cosmic rays

00:29:18.370 --> 00:29:20.036
can, in principle,
tell that difference.

00:29:20.036 --> 00:29:21.190
So we are studying that.

00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:24.270
It does have an impact on
the terrestrial accelerator

00:29:24.270 --> 00:29:25.930
program.

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:27.990
The measurements that
Phil was talking about,

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:29.656
they are getting
really, really precise.

00:29:29.656 --> 00:29:33.160
And if you look at the data
it is, over the last 20 years,

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.940
it has become precise
enough that the people are

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:40.410
doing sky surveys of where
these things are coming from.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:45.040
They are trying to correlate the
different sources of particles

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:47.655
coming to the Earth, so
the optical astronomy,

00:29:47.655 --> 00:29:50.030
and the cosmic ray astronomy,
and the neutrino astronomy,

00:29:50.030 --> 00:29:52.280
and now of course
gravitational wave astronomy.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.050
So that whole thing
is coming together.

00:29:55.050 --> 00:29:56.650
We need to understand
the particles

00:29:56.650 --> 00:30:00.510
so that the astro
part of our community

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.650
is able to understand
the universe.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:04.275
And because the
universe is complicated

00:30:04.275 --> 00:30:07.570
and we don't understand
it, it is not a priori

00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:10.670
the best way to
study the particles.

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:15.200
So we have to use that beam, if
you want, where it is useful.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.147
And we definitely do study that.

00:30:17.147 --> 00:30:19.480
But then we need to make the
measurements of the details

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.980
that Phil was talking
about in order

00:30:20.980 --> 00:30:22.370
to understand the
universe, which

00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:25.240
is another fantastic goal.

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:26.210
Thank you.

00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:31.120
So we had one more question
waiting just in here somewhere.

00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:32.738
Yep, thanks, Martin.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.290
The assembled
panel has talked us

00:30:37.290 --> 00:30:39.360
through a number
of technologies.

00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:43.330
But are there others not
represented here tonight

00:30:43.330 --> 00:30:45.090
that it would be
interesting to know

00:30:45.090 --> 00:30:49.600
about, perhaps work in Russia,
or Japan, or somewhere else.

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:52.197
Can the panel tell us
if there is something

00:30:52.197 --> 00:30:53.030
that we are missing?

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:57.280
So I'm going to
address that to start

00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.696
with saying that most of the
collaborations that are being

00:30:59.696 --> 00:31:03.130
represented here are fully
international collaborations,

00:31:03.130 --> 00:31:05.840
as Phil mentioned.

00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:09.600
So I assembled the panel,
so I'm the one who,

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.805
sort of, chose which
panel members we had here.

00:31:12.805 --> 00:31:14.680
Do any of you, would
anyone like to pitch in?

00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:16.500
Is there anything
that you feel is--

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:18.597
As I said on
[INAUDIBLE], maybe that's

00:31:18.597 --> 00:31:20.430
somewhere between the
conventional structure

00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:23.330
and the plus, but in between
these micro structure

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.090
devices also driven by
lasers, potentially.

00:31:26.090 --> 00:31:27.590
That's what I was
going to bring up.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:28.250
OK.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:32.082
So this is where-- lasers
have really, really

00:31:32.082 --> 00:31:33.040
strong electric fields.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:36.050
I was talking about the electric
fields in the plasma waves

00:31:36.050 --> 00:31:38.150
I generate being
tens of thousands

00:31:38.150 --> 00:31:42.042
of megavolts per meter.

00:31:42.042 --> 00:31:43.500
But the electric
field in the laser

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.860
that we use to
generate it is actually

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.760
many teravolts per meter.

00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.542
It's just it's not
pointing-- the laser

00:31:49.542 --> 00:31:51.750
going in that direction,
the electric fields pointing

00:31:51.750 --> 00:31:53.166
in that direction
and oscillating.

00:31:53.166 --> 00:31:56.890
So you can't use it to
accelerate particles.

00:31:56.890 --> 00:32:00.240
It just makes them wiggle
around up and down.

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:03.579
There is a way that you can
create, take some of that laser

00:32:03.579 --> 00:32:05.620
field and make it point
in the forward direction,

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.120
in the direction
of the accelerator.

00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:11.100
And that's by putting
it into a cavity.

00:32:11.100 --> 00:32:13.180
So it's actually very
similar to the way

00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:15.940
when you put a radio frequency
wave inside a cavity.

00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.330
So if I have a radio wave
out in vacuum in free space,

00:32:19.330 --> 00:32:22.455
it's also the electric field
is just pointing perpendicular

00:32:22.455 --> 00:32:24.080
to the direction of
the waves traveling

00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:25.500
and it won't do
any accelerating.

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:29.670
By putting it inside a cavity
which creates a boundary

00:32:29.670 --> 00:32:31.650
effect, you actually get
an accelerating field

00:32:31.650 --> 00:32:33.010
in the direction that you want.

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:36.340
And there is a technique which
is a dielectric acceleration

00:32:36.340 --> 00:32:41.730
where you create very small
channels in a high damage

00:32:41.730 --> 00:32:44.200
threshold piece of
glass, basically.

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.956
And that effectively channels
the-- it's like a cavity,

00:32:47.956 --> 00:32:48.580
but for lasers.

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:50.640
So instead of using
radio frequency

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:52.670
you're using laser
frequency, but you're

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.941
getting a longitudinal thing.

00:32:54.941 --> 00:32:57.190
I think there are other-- I
don't know a lot about it,

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.350
so I don't want to
talk too much about it,

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:02.491
but there are-- you could get
very high gradients, and things

00:33:02.491 --> 00:33:04.490
like that, but you're
talking about accelerating

00:33:04.490 --> 00:33:06.910
a few particles in
each channel at a time.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:09.990
So it's not obvious how you turn
that into a high intensity beam

00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:13.350
that you need for a big
particle accelerator, maybe.

00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:16.280
We're not hiding
anything from you.

00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:18.630
If it were easy, you
know, we'd already

00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:21.230
have accelerators taking
us to the energies

00:33:21.230 --> 00:33:23.090
of these cosmic rays
that are coming in.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.350
It's intrinsically
very difficult.

00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:28.530
And so I think,
with that exception,

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:31.220
I can't think of any other
revolutionary technology that's

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:34.359
out there that isn't actually
being represented on the panel

00:33:34.359 --> 00:33:34.900
this evening.

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:35.730
It's very hard.

00:33:35.730 --> 00:33:37.580
So that's probably a
good point to actually,

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:39.288
for me to just throw
in a question, which

00:33:39.288 --> 00:33:41.166
is to say that most
of these projects now,

00:33:41.166 --> 00:33:42.790
because we're talking
about big science

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:45.440
now-- well, apart
from maybe your lab.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.880
A little bit smaller.

00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:49.920
But very big projects,
usually rather expensive

00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:51.379
projects, and
usually with interest

00:33:51.379 --> 00:33:53.669
from all around the world,
so they're normally very big

00:33:53.669 --> 00:33:54.980
international projects.

00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.340
So I thought I might throw
the question at you of,

00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:03.060
how do decisions get made in
this international community?

00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.620
How does the structural
work of, you know, is it

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.730
the guy who shouts
the loudest who

00:34:07.730 --> 00:34:09.400
gets their accelerator built?

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:11.969
Or maybe some of you
who are more involved

00:34:11.969 --> 00:34:15.070
in that international decision
making process could comment.

00:34:15.070 --> 00:34:15.949
Phil, do you?

00:34:15.949 --> 00:34:18.730
I'm happy to start,
Suzie, thank you.

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:21.080
Particle physics
accelerator science

00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:25.040
is genuinely a sort
of bottom up activity.

00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.750
The community is not that
large, probably 20,000,

00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:30.449
I would estimate,
particle physicists,

00:34:30.449 --> 00:34:32.650
accelerator physicists
in the world.

00:34:32.650 --> 00:34:36.170
That's a large number, but it's
still a well defined community.

00:34:36.170 --> 00:34:38.969
There is genuine cooperation
in our community.

00:34:38.969 --> 00:34:41.199
We genuinely-- I mean,
we've all worked together

00:34:41.199 --> 00:34:43.699
over the decades, and so on.

00:34:43.699 --> 00:34:46.610
So I would say that
fundamentally the discipline

00:34:46.610 --> 00:34:47.449
is bottoms up.

00:34:47.449 --> 00:34:49.530
People have good ideas.

00:34:49.530 --> 00:34:52.170
They try and sell those
ideas to their colleagues.

00:34:52.170 --> 00:34:55.190
You try and gather a team of
people to pursue these ideas.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:57.160
You ask your funding
agency for some money

00:34:57.160 --> 00:35:00.410
to support some R&amp;D to
do experiments and push

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:01.740
technology, and so on.

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:05.450
If ideas look promising, bigger
international collaborations

00:35:05.450 --> 00:35:06.080
form.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:09.800
The one that I'm
privileged to lead

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:11.980
has been going for
about 15 years now.

00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:15.250
We have 50 institutes from
around the world because people

00:35:15.250 --> 00:35:18.760
think, people believe that this
is a technology that really

00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.670
is very promising
and it's worth them

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:23.010
dedicating their
scientific lives

00:35:23.010 --> 00:35:24.420
to trying to make it work.

00:35:24.420 --> 00:35:28.770
And we've been able to achieve
funding for the project.

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:30.400
But, of course,
at some point you

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:33.170
have to move from
an R&amp;D enterprise

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:37.580
to a real major facility that
is actually going to be built.

00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:42.400
And those are, these days,
billion pound, dollar,

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.690
euro class facilities.

00:35:44.690 --> 00:35:47.160
And that's where it becomes
a little bit more exciting,

00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:48.730
because then the
world, of course,

00:35:48.730 --> 00:35:53.330
cannot possibly afford to have--
if the money were unlimited,

00:35:53.330 --> 00:35:55.650
we'd have all of these things.

00:35:55.650 --> 00:35:58.720
We'd have electron positron,
proton proton, muons,

00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.420
and a super duper plasma
wakefield accelerator.

00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:04.340
These projects are now
of a sufficient scale

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:08.350
of technical complexity
and cost that it's

00:36:08.350 --> 00:36:10.120
very difficult to
have more than one

00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:12.550
or two running in the world.

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:15.770
And people come together
globally to collaborate,

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:17.680
to try to realize and
bring the resources

00:36:17.680 --> 00:36:20.620
together to realize
multi-billion projects.

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:23.430
And they get spread out
over a long time scale.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:25.050
That's why you saw
in Frank's slide,

00:36:25.050 --> 00:36:29.040
I think, 20 years gestation
period for the Large Hadron

00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.050
Collider.

00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:32.820
And, hence, you've got to
run the thing for 20 years

00:36:32.820 --> 00:36:36.070
in order to fully exploit
it, and get all of the data,

00:36:36.070 --> 00:36:38.912
and all the information to make
that investment worthwhile.

00:36:38.912 --> 00:36:41.120
So I think I'm straying from
the question now, Suzie.

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.860
Maybe I'll let somebody
else have a go.

00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:44.990
But it's fundamentally
bottoms up.

00:36:44.990 --> 00:36:46.950
And at some level you've
got to get serious,

00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:48.990
and you've got to get
quite a lot of money.

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:52.110
And that's when politics, of
course, and global politics

00:36:52.110 --> 00:36:54.010
starts to enter
into the picture.

00:36:54.010 --> 00:36:56.720
So maybe we can continue
on that, actually,

00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:59.680
about the politics and the
international community

00:36:59.680 --> 00:37:00.280
of science.

00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:04.260
There's been a lot of articles
and Information said about CERN

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:07.084
bringing together people
who might traditionally not

00:37:07.084 --> 00:37:09.500
have worked together and how
that's had a positive effect.

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.440
And I know you've all worked in
very international communities.

00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:15.840
So would any of you like
to comment on the, sort of,

00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:18.880
positive aspects of the very
international cooperation

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.830
that happens in this field?

00:37:20.830 --> 00:37:23.850
Maybe Ken, would you
like to comment on that?

00:37:23.850 --> 00:37:26.200
Or disagree with the statement?

00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:27.700
I don't disagree
with the statement.

00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:31.720
So I think CERN is a very,
very special organization.

00:37:31.720 --> 00:37:37.370
So it created in the '50s
when, obviously, Europe

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:39.820
was recovering after the war.

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:41.600
It's an international
treaty organization,

00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.890
that's very special, I think.

00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:49.130
To create the conditions in
which such a treaty could

00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:54.430
be negotiated and signed you
would need special conditions.

00:37:54.430 --> 00:37:55.950
And they existed.

00:37:55.950 --> 00:37:58.170
The value of that is
seen across the world,

00:37:58.170 --> 00:38:04.520
and CERN continues to
attract more countries.

00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:07.980
And there's a negotiation period
there because they have to,

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.670
the treaty has to be agreed
by all the other members,

00:38:11.670 --> 00:38:15.160
and there are, you have to
contribute to the budget,

00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.660
and that's an international
treaty obligation

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:18.860
once you're a member.

00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.460
So that brings in
inertia, because clearly

00:38:23.460 --> 00:38:26.480
to get all the governments
to agree to a treaty change

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:27.490
takes time.

00:38:27.490 --> 00:38:28.900
But it's robust.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.640
Because with the
international treaty

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:34.195
comes some kind of
collective responsibility

00:38:34.195 --> 00:38:36.070
of all those governments
that have signed it.

00:38:36.070 --> 00:38:40.820
And that's why CERN is as
successful and as stable

00:38:40.820 --> 00:38:41.766
as it is.

00:38:41.766 --> 00:38:45.310
It is driven by science,
wants the best science

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:46.480
that can be done.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.380
And that, actually, I think is
a unique combination of things.

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:53.330
The international
treaty organization

00:38:53.330 --> 00:38:57.620
which is there to deliver
fundamental science.

00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:02.850
That's a jewel in our collective
crown and we should protect it.

00:39:02.850 --> 00:39:05.530
So, basically I agree.

00:39:05.530 --> 00:39:06.530
Maybe I can add to that.

00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:09.600
I think that especially
British accelerators have made

00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:11.570
enormous contributions to CERN.

00:39:11.570 --> 00:39:15.820
John Adams commissioned the PS,
and he built the SPS collider.

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.210
And then Lyn Evans
built the LHC.

00:39:18.210 --> 00:39:20.610
So, actually Britain
has a proud history in--

00:39:20.610 --> 00:39:24.040
Yeah, it was Mike Lamont is
leading the LHC operation.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:27.320
It's just a wonderful,
wonderful collaboration

00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.440
between the different nations
of Europe and around the world.

00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.220
And it's working very
well, the system.

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:36.570
I think it's kind of a model
for successful international

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:37.450
cooperation.

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:41.110
Many people complain about
ITER and the fusion development

00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:43.390
because it maybe looks
less successful and not so

00:39:43.390 --> 00:39:43.900
efficient.

00:39:43.900 --> 00:39:46.150
But the CERN model
is quite efficient.

00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:49.000
Of course, we do live in
interesting times with regard

00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.640
to European treaty organization.

00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:56.710
But it is worth pointing out
that CERN predates the European

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.366
Union by three years.

00:39:58.366 --> 00:40:00.490
And it's a completely
separate International treaty

00:40:00.490 --> 00:40:02.250
organization.

00:40:02.250 --> 00:40:04.050
And so we're often
asked, you know,

00:40:04.050 --> 00:40:07.670
what does Brexit mean for the
UK's involvement with CERN.

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:11.220
Well, hopefully, to the extent
that Her Majesty's government

00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:12.950
continues to pay
our subscription

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:15.340
to the international
organization,

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:17.810
we will continue to be
full members of CERN.

00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:19.560
And as Frank has
very generously said,

00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.920
play a very important role
in this greater entity.

00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:25.920
So we've only got a
couple of minutes left.

00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:27.461
So I'm going to ask
if there is maybe

00:40:27.461 --> 00:40:30.990
one more question from the
audience before I wind up.

00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:34.020
Is there one more going?

00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.370
There's one right up the
back in the middle, I think.

00:40:36.370 --> 00:40:38.490
If I can, you're
just below a light,

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.186
so that was very
difficult to see.

00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:48.730
There we go.

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:53.310
Hello there, I was wondering,
you know for electron colliders

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:55.760
you have the electron
and positron colliders.

00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:00.730
Is there any muon-antigluon
or tau-antiatu colliders

00:41:00.730 --> 00:41:01.840
that exist?

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:07.726
And if there are, is it perhaps
influential in discovery

00:41:07.726 --> 00:41:12.510
for a new powerful
collider, for instance?

00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:14.360
So, do any muon colliders exist?

00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:19.050
No they don't.

00:41:19.050 --> 00:41:21.530
So people have made muon
beams, many, many muon

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:24.920
beams around the world, a muon
beam at Rutherford Appleton

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:27.120
Laboratory, for example.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:30.400
The difficulty is making
the beams intense enough.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:35.450
So I had a slide which was
intense cold muon beams, cold

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:39.640
is a jargon for this small beam.

00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:43.200
So if you want to get
collisions at a large rate,

00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:46.950
you have to have either an
enormous number of particles,

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:49.020
or you bring them into
a tiny, tiny spot.

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:53.570
So both ILC, CLIC, FCC,
they all make the particles

00:41:53.570 --> 00:41:55.420
into a tiny, tiny spot.

00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:56.880
So to do the
neutrino science, you

00:41:56.880 --> 00:41:59.110
need a cucumber of particles.

00:41:59.110 --> 00:42:01.030
If you want a muon
collider, you've

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:04.920
got to have something less
than the thickness of a hair.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.380
That's the size of the
beam that has to collide.

00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:09.050
So the difficulty
is that you have

00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:13.800
to reduce the size
of the beam such

00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.940
that you can get
enough collisions.

00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:18.220
And that's what this
cooling business is about

00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.000
that we're building the
experiment at Rutherford Lab.

00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:23.630
And we need to demonstrate
that technology,

00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:26.350
and then we can discuss
making the muon collider.

00:42:26.350 --> 00:42:29.150
OK, so I have one final
question for each of you

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:32.597
just before we leave
which is for the younger

00:42:32.597 --> 00:42:34.430
people in the audience
tonight, or for those

00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:36.910
who are particularly
interested in this field,

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:38.370
do you have any
advice for people

00:42:38.370 --> 00:42:40.230
who might be
interested in working

00:42:40.230 --> 00:42:45.510
on these future machines that
might come along in very soon,

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:48.770
or 10, 20 years time,
40, 50 years time?

00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:50.850
Any sage words of
advice before we go?

00:42:50.850 --> 00:42:53.880
I'm going to start on this end.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:57.500
Well, I'm sorry, the
trite answer in the UK

00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.065
is, of course, that you've
got to do physics at a level.

00:43:01.065 --> 00:43:04.720
And especially if you are a
female member of the audience,

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:07.200
we desperately want you
to do physics at a level.

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:10.410
And I can see there's a
budding accelerator physicist

00:43:10.410 --> 00:43:12.250
on the front row here.

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:13.980
Yeah, physics at a level.

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.280
Go and do your physics degree.

00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:19.260
Go and get a summer intern
at CERN, for example,

00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:23.150
and go and spend eight or
10 weeks during your summer

00:43:23.150 --> 00:43:26.470
vacation working on
a project at CERN.

00:43:26.470 --> 00:43:27.180
Get excitement.

00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:27.920
Get fired up.

00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:33.360
And then come to the John Adams
Institute and do your PhD.

00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:35.180
Frank, anything to add to that?

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:39.340
Yeah, I'm doing accelerator
physics in 27 years, or so.

00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.660
I did my diplomacies,
and then PhD,

00:43:41.660 --> 00:43:44.170
and I already studied with
accelerators and colliders.

00:43:44.170 --> 00:43:46.670
And I enjoyed very much that
you can do all kinds of things.

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:49.430
You can be in the control
room playing with the beam,

00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:50.760
and optimizing the operation.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.620
Can I just check,
do you actually

00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:52.578
get to control the LHC?

00:43:52.578 --> 00:43:54.336
Is that part of your job?

00:43:54.336 --> 00:43:55.460
Not at the moment any more.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.460
But you have?

00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.020
In the past, yes.

00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.170
How cool is that?

00:43:59.170 --> 00:44:00.310
Sorry, I get jealous.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:03.200
For some experiments we
can control the LHC, yes.

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.050
So it's fun career?

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:09.810
Yeah, you can do
computer simulations.

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:10.930
I do a lot of
computer simulations.

00:44:10.930 --> 00:44:12.460
You can do analytical
calculations

00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.610
and you are more or
less free to choose.

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:17.850
And I like the combination,
it never gets boring.

00:44:17.850 --> 00:44:19.849
I can spend some day
in the control room

00:44:19.849 --> 00:44:21.640
with the operators, I
can spend another day

00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:24.680
in my office doing simulations,
or you can have meetings,

00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:25.450
or whatever.

00:44:25.450 --> 00:44:27.777
But you can do many
different things.

00:44:27.777 --> 00:44:30.110
You are more flexible than
many other fields of physics,

00:44:30.110 --> 00:44:31.070
I think.

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:34.450
And we need a lot, we need
more accelerator physicists.

00:44:34.450 --> 00:44:37.810
We have never enough applicants
for doctoral students,

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:39.230
or for post docs.

00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:41.200
We never find candidates.

00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:44.160
We have many more
posts than applicants.

00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:44.990
So anybody--

00:44:44.990 --> 00:44:47.380
OK, if you want a job
at CERN, now you know.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.960
I must say, yeah,
it's very difficult.

00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:50.940
They're oversubscribed.

00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.731
Last year the post docs
were oversubscribed

00:44:52.731 --> 00:44:54.120
by a factor of 10, or so.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:56.141
10 different groups asked
for the same candidate

00:44:56.141 --> 00:44:57.640
because there are
so few candidates.

00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.070
So that's why FCC is not faster,
because we cannot get all

00:45:01.070 --> 00:45:02.290
the post docs that we need.

00:45:02.290 --> 00:45:04.200
So we need smart people.

00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:08.974
And then maybe also, maybe the
time scale is a bit worrying.

00:45:08.974 --> 00:45:11.140
You don't want to wait 20
years for the next machine

00:45:11.140 --> 00:45:11.430
accelerator.

00:45:11.430 --> 00:45:13.170
But I enjoyed very
much, I can always

00:45:13.170 --> 00:45:16.090
work on an operating machine,
work on the next generation,

00:45:16.090 --> 00:45:18.780
and also look at the
generation beyond the next.

00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:19.890
So I like this very much.

00:45:19.890 --> 00:45:22.939
And you can learn, you always
learn from the existing machine

00:45:22.939 --> 00:45:25.230
what to improve and what to
do better for the next one.

00:45:25.230 --> 00:45:26.313
Long term, long term view.

00:45:26.313 --> 00:45:28.900
You can do the things
at the same time.

00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:31.700
Yeah, that's a good
point, actually.

00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.140
Anything to add over this side?

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:34.725
I might just have
one thing, sorry.

00:45:34.725 --> 00:45:35.350
Yeah, go ahead.

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:37.808
Which is that, so one of the
good things about doing plasma

00:45:37.808 --> 00:45:39.990
based acceleration certainly
is, as a PhD student,

00:45:39.990 --> 00:45:42.460
is the time scale of the
way things are moving

00:45:42.460 --> 00:45:45.790
is much faster and the
experiments are much smaller.

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:49.020
So you almost get
to own a large part

00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.370
of the project all of your own.

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:52.470
Whereas if you get involved
in very big machines

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:55.580
you can be very, very focused on
a really important part that's

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:58.475
making a big contribution
to something very important,

00:45:58.475 --> 00:45:59.850
but it can be kept
very detailed.

00:45:59.850 --> 00:46:02.400
Whereas I think when you're
doing the plasma based stuff

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:05.010
it's quite fun because
you do everything

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:08.530
from building the machine, to
designing it with simulations,

00:46:08.530 --> 00:46:10.564
to doing all of the
data analysis and stuff

00:46:10.564 --> 00:46:11.230
all on your own.

00:46:11.230 --> 00:46:14.000
So it's kind of fun
like that as well.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.190
And not to be left out,
Ken, anything to add?

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:24.102
So I've been thinking, so
this it's-- I'm going to say

00:46:24.102 --> 00:46:26.310
something which is personal,
which I never really do.

00:46:26.310 --> 00:46:28.350
I have two daughters,
one of whom

00:46:28.350 --> 00:46:31.390
is genuinely considering
particle physics.

00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:33.400
And therefore this is
a real question for me

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.030
not an academic question.

00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:37.300
And what I say to her
is follow your heart.

00:46:37.300 --> 00:46:39.184
And I've had a
great time, right,

00:46:39.184 --> 00:46:40.850
I've never done a
day's work in my life.

00:46:40.850 --> 00:46:45.010
What I do beats working
for a living, really great.

00:46:45.010 --> 00:46:49.270
If she falls in love with
another area, follow that.

00:46:49.270 --> 00:46:51.790
Because that's what
will make you work.

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:55.220
Particle physics, accelerator
science is fantastic.

00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:58.927
If you love something
else, do that.

00:46:58.927 --> 00:47:00.510
I think that's a
nice point to end on.

00:47:00.510 --> 00:47:01.509
Do what makes you happy.

00:47:01.509 --> 00:47:04.970
And I think for the panel down
here working on accelerators

00:47:04.970 --> 00:47:08.230
has made us all, given us all
a really enjoyable career.

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:11.100
I'm obviously just starting out
in my career in accelerators,

00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:13.460
and I certainly enjoy it
for many of the elements

00:47:13.460 --> 00:47:14.472
that you've said.

00:47:14.472 --> 00:47:15.930
So just to wind up
I'd like you all

00:47:15.930 --> 00:47:18.600
to please give a massive
round of applause

00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:20.030
to my illustrious panel.

00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:22.160
Thank you.
