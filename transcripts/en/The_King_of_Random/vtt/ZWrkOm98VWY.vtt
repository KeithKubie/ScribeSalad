What's up guys, it's Grant here and I'm giving away a Galaxy S9+ smartphone to one of you.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.960
There's a link down the description to get your name on the list to qualify, it's a little subscriber appreciation for you

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.979
Love you guys. Appreciate your support, go get your name on the list to get qualified and all the best.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:17.580
Hey guys. Today, we're gonna be finishing up the gear project that we started in a previous video

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.330
We managed to make a mold around a piece of foam using some drywall

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.729
Texturing paste and then we stuck that into some sand and we cast copper down into it

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.980
We got this great copper gear, but it still looks very messy. So today we're gonna see what it takes to clean this up

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.058
We've got a bunch of sandpaper. We've got files. We've got metal brushes

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.940
We've got polishing wheels and we've got metal polish and we are just going to hit this thing with everything we've got until

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.420
We can get it nice and clean and just shiny. Like I want to be able to see my reflection and then this bad boy

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.020
Will it work? I don't know. This is an experiment and we're gonna find out.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.272
I've got a 60 grit belt on our belt sander here

00:00:59.272 --> 00:01:04.100
We're gonna see how much of this copper we can smooth down using the belt sander

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.629
It might be a little bit tricky because I do have quite a bit to get through before it's nice and smooth

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.729
But I think that's gonna be our best tool for this job. If this doesn't work, we'll see about moving on to something else

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.249
All right, that's just a few seconds on the belt sander

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.779
You can already see the progress we're making we can also see that our copper is apparently like swiss cheese full of holes,

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.350
Not exactly sure what caused that or how deep those bubbles go. I'm just going to keep on going

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.669
We might be able to sand right through those or maybe one side of our gears can have a really cool

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:46.340
Decoration all over it. Think theres only one way to find out.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.630
Still getting flatter, you still see those holes.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.120
Does look like some of them are pretty shallowing, I think we've almost gone all the way through them

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.419
I bet some of them are deep enough that they'll still show up in our final service

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.699
But even just that I really like how the copper is starting to show up there. It looks pretty cool

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.550
My wheel is also getting nice and hot I'm gonna have to grab some water to cool this off and after a couple minutes of

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.869
Sanding because it's gonna get warm doing this, but I'm liking it it's working

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.410
I have only been doing this for like less than a minute already and it's definitely making progress

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.040
So this sandpaper on the belt sander seems to be the way to go

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.780
All right and kind of just like that it is getting

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.550
Too warm to hold on to so I'm just gonna get some cold water that I can cool this off in

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.709
And dry it off and throw it back on the belt sander

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.619
Copper does conduct heat better than

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.039
Most if not all metals, it might not be the very best heat conducting metal, but it's really high up there

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.570
This has spread so much sanded copper out on the work bench. Look at this. You can just like

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.499
Making a pile back to the grind. Literally.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.280
And then we've made pretty good progress on this side, we've definitely flattened it all out

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.319
You can see that the shiny copper is exposed all the way through a lot of these bubbles on this side

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.469
But I think that's actually going to be a pretty cool looking effect

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.938
We'll see how I decide to go about cleaning those up time to move on to the other side

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:30.239
Which is already quite a bit flatter

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.449
So I think it'll go pretty quick and we'll see if there's any bubbles on this side, too. I'm not sure yet.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.820
We've got both sides of our gear partially sanded down and they are looking good.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:51.409
Now I want to try getting into the teeth of this. I'm not gonna be able do that on the belt sander

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.859
So I'm gonna move over to our bench vise and start using some hand files

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.169
And see if I can clean up those edges a bit.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.000
We may come back to the files in a little bit for some more detail work

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.200
But for now, we're gonna move on to using the wire brushes on this rotary tool

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.609
And we've got something that should fit in our regular drill chuck

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.840
So we'll try and see if we can clean up some of the edges that are harder to hit with a file

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.850
This little attachment may not be the sturdiest built thing ever

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:54.160
I think 60% of the wires have just torn themselves off polishing that copper right there

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.969
At the end of the drill I now have what is a wheel made of cotton or maybe muslin disks

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:35.700
And then I've got some polish which I will apply to the cloth

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:39.779
and then I'll use that to try and really bring out a nice shine on the copper

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:05.288
My goal is to make a copper gear so shiny that I could see myself

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.518
How do you think I did? This method of casting copper is not 100 percent perfect

00:06:09.859 --> 00:06:11.259
By pouring it in the way

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:16.118
We did we ended up with a lot of large bubble marks on the backside and a lot of small ball marks on the front

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:18.939
side
but it was still able to be flattened down smoothed out and

00:06:19.219 --> 00:06:26.300
Polished and like I could use this thing as a copper colored mirror. It's a little small, but overall it looks really good.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.120
