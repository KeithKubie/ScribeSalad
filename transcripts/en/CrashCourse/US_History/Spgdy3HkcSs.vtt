00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.759
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course:
US History, and today we’re going to continue

00:00:03.759 --> 00:00:06.519
our look at the Gilded Age by focusing on
political science.

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:10.040
Mr. Green, Mr. Green, so it’s another history
class where we don’t actually talk about

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.440
history?
Oh, Me From the Past, your insistence on trying

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.010
to place academic exploration into little
boxes creates a little box that you yourself

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.860
will live in for the rest of your life if
you don’t put your interdisciplinary party

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.120
hat on.
So the Gilded Age takes its name from a book

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.790
by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner that
was called The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.809
It was published in 1873 and it was not that
successful, but while The Gilded Age conjures

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:40.199
up visions of fancy parties and ostentatious
displays of wealth, the book itself was about

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.769
politics, and it gives a very negative appraisal
of the state of American democracy at the

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.429
time.
Which shouldn’t come as a huge surprise

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.089
coming from Twain, whose comments about Congress
included, “Suppose you were an idiot. And

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:54.679
suppose you were a member of Congress. But
I repeat myself.”

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.550
And also, “It could probably be shown by
facts and figures that there is no distinctly

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.140
Native American criminal class except Congress.”
So when faced with the significant changes

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.140
taking place in the American economy after
the Civil War, America’s political system

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.400
both nationally and locally dealt with these
problems in the best way possible: by becoming

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:20.400
incredibly corrupt.
intro

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.170
Stan says I have to take off my party hat.
Rrrr rrrr rrrrr....

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.540
So House Speaker Tip O’Neill once famously
said that all politics is local and although

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.740
that’s not actually true, I am going to
start with local politics today, specifically

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.560
with one of America’s greatest inventions,
the urban political machine.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.140
So a political machine is basically an organization
that works to win elections so that it can

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.810
exercise power. The most famous political
machine was New York City’s Tammany Hall,

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.110
which dominated Democratic party politics
in the late 19th century, survived until the

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.350
20th, and is keenly associated with corruption.
Oh, it’s already time for the Mystery Document?

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.120
This is highly unorthodox, Stan. Well, the
rules here are simple.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.510
I guess the author of the Mystery Document.
I’m usually wrong and I get shocked with

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.329
the shock pen.
Alright, let’s see what we’ve got here.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.999
“My party’s in power in the city, and
it’s going to undertake a lot of public

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.599
improvements. Well, I’m tipped off, say,
that they’re going to lay out a new park

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.459
at a certain place and I buy up all the land
I can in the neighborhood. Then the board

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.219
of this or that makes its plan public, and
there is a rush to get my land, which nobody

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:28.659
cared particular for before. Ain’t it perfectly
honest to charge a good price and make a profit

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:33.030
on my investment and foresight. Of course
it is. That’s honest graft.”

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.540
Stan, I know this one. It’s about machine
politics. It’s from New York. It doesn’t

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.499
say it’s from New York, but it is because
it is George Plunkitt. Yes! How do you like

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.909
them apples?
Oh, you wanna know the name of the book? It’s

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:49.909
“Plunkitt of Tammany Hall.” Stan, transition
me back to the desk with a Libertage, please.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.219
Plunkitt became famous for writing a book
describing the way that New York City’s

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.799
government actually worked, but he was a small
fish compared with the most famous shark-like

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:06.139
machine politician of the day, William “Boss”
Tweed, seen here with a head made of money.

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:11.260
“Boss” Tweed basically ran New York in
the late 1860s and early 1870s, and his greatest

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.249
feat of swindling helps explain how the machine
system worked.

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:18.700
It revolved around the then-new County Courthouse
that now houses the New York City Department

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.499
of Education.
Building the courthouse was initially estimated

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:28.400
to cost around $250,000, but ended up costing
$13 million by the time it was finished in

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.219
1871.
Included in that cost was a bill of $180,000

00:03:32.219 --> 00:03:39.219
for three tables and forty chairs, $1.5 million
for lighting fixtures, and $41,000 for brooms

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.060
and cleaning supplies.
A plasterer received $500,000 for his initial

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.810
job and then $1 million to repair his shoddy
work.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.419
The standard kickback in these situations
was that Tammany Hall received two dollars

00:03:51.419 --> 00:03:56.359
for every one dollar received by the contractor.
That may seem like a bad deal for contractors,

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.999
but remember: That plasterer still got to
keep half a million dollars, which is worth

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:04.889
about $9 million in today’s money.
Now of course that makes it sound like political

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:09.669
machines were pure evil, especially if you
were a taxpayer footing the bill for that

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:12.010
courthouse.
But machines also provided valuable services

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.449
to immigrants and other poor people in cities.
As Plunkitt explained, Tammany could help

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.370
families in need:
“I don’t ask whether they are Republicans

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.780
or Democrats, and I don’t refer them to
the Charity Organization Society, which would

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.139
investigate their case in a month or two and
decide they were worthy of help about the

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.740
time they are dead from starvation. I just
get quarters for them, buy clothes for them

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.639
if their clothes were burned up, and fix them
up until they get things running again.”

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.610
In return for this help, Tammany expected
votes so that they could stay in power. Staying

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.150
in power meant control of city jobs as well
as city contracts. Plunkitt claimed to know

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.110
“every big employer in the district – and
in the whole city, for that matter --- and

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.020
they ain’t in the habit of saying no to
me when I ask them for a job.”

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:55.150
But with all the corruption, sometimes even
that wasn’t enough. Fortunately Tammany

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.669
politicians could always fall back on fraud.
Tammany found bearded men to vote, then took

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.979
them to the barber to shave off the beard,
but left the moustache, so that they could

00:05:02.979 --> 00:05:07.229
vote a second time. And then, they would shave
off the ‘stache so they could vote for a

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.080
third.
And then of course, there was always violence

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.000
and intimidation. By the end of the century
a Tammany regular lamented the good old days

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.830
when, “It was wonderful to see my men slug
the opposition to preserve the sanctity of

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.129
the ballot.”
But, corruption wasn’t limited to big cities

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:24.409
like New York and Chicago. Some of the biggest
boondoggles involved the United States Congress

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:27.210
and the executive branch under president Ulysses
Grant.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.960
The first big scandal, dubbed the “King
of Frauds” by the New York Sun, involved

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.849
Credit Mobilier, the construction company
that did most of the road building for the

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:39.080
Union Pacific Railroad.
This two pronged accusation involved, first:

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.139
overcharging the public for construction costs
and siphoning off profits to Credit Mobilier,

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:47.840
and second: bribery of Congressmen.
Now, this second charge was, of course, much

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:52.889
juicier and also more partisan because only
Republican congressmen, including the Speaker

00:05:52.889 --> 00:05:57.389
of the House, were implicated in it.
Eventually Massachusetts Congressman Oakes

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:02.889
Ames was found guilty of giving bribes, but
no one was ever found guilty of receiving

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.349
those bribes. As you can imagine, that did
wonders for the reputation of Congress.

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:11.550
The second major scandal involved the so-called
Whiskey Ring, which was a group of distillers

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.740
in St. Louis who decided that they didn’t
like paying excise taxes on their product,

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:20.490
perhaps a slightly more noble cause than that
of the 2009 Bling Ring, who just wanted to

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:24.389
dress like Paris Hilton.
John McDonald, a Grant administration official,

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:29.949
helped distillers reduce their taxes by intentionally
undercounting the number of kegs of booze.

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:35.050
But then in 1875, the tax evasion grew out
of control. And McDonald eventually confessed

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:39.699
and was convicted, thereby tainting the presidency
with corruption just as Credit Mobilier had

00:06:39.699 --> 00:06:42.159
tainted Congress.
That leaves the Supreme Court untainted, but

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:46.000
don’t worry, the Dred Scott decision is
worth at least, like, eighty years of tainting.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.830
So with all this distrust in government, after
Grant served two terms, presidential elections

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:54.939
featured a series of one-termers: Hayes, Garfield
(whose term was filled out by Chester Arthur

00:06:54.939 --> 00:07:00.349
after Garfield was assassinated), Cleveland,
Benjamin Harrison, and then Cleveland again.

00:07:00.349 --> 00:07:03.539
McKinley, who was elected twice, but then
he was assassinated.

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:08.169
As for their parties, Gilded Age Republicans
favored high tariffs, low government spending,

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:12.639
paying off national debt and reducing the
amount of paper money – or greenbacks – in

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:17.099
circulation. Democrats opposed the tariffs
and were often linked to New York bankers

00:07:17.099 --> 00:07:19.939
and financiers.
In short, both parties were pro-business,

00:07:19.939 --> 00:07:24.110
but they were pro-different-businesses.
Despite that and the widespread corruption,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.780
some national reform legislation actually
did get passed in the Gilded Age.

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:32.039
The Civil Service Act of 1883 – prompted
by Garfield’s assassination by a disgruntled

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:36.439
office seeker – created a merit system for
10% of federal employees, who were chosen

00:07:36.439 --> 00:07:39.280
by competitive examination rather than political
favoritism.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:43.810
But, this had an unintended effect. It made
American politicians much more dependent on

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:48.849
donations from big business rather than small
donations from grateful political appointees,

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:52.759
but, you know, nice idea.
And then in 1890 the Sherman Anti-Trust act

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:57.590
forbade combinations and practices that restrained
trade, but again it was almost impossible

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:00.909
to enforce this against the monopolies like
U.S. Steel.

00:08:00.909 --> 00:08:04.449
More often it was used against labor unions,
which were seen to restrain trade in their

00:08:04.449 --> 00:08:07.610
radical lobbying for, like, health insurance
and hard hats.

00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:11.259
But all in all the national Congress was pretty
dysfunctional at the end of the 19th century,

00:08:11.259 --> 00:08:14.969
stop me if that sounds familiar. So state
governments expanded their responsibility

00:08:14.969 --> 00:08:20.069
for public health and welfare. Cities invested
in public works, like transportation, and

00:08:20.069 --> 00:08:24.789
gas, and later, electricity, and the movement
to provide public education continued.

00:08:24.789 --> 00:08:29.919
Some northern states even passed laws limiting
the workday to 8 hours. “What is this, France?”

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:32.779
is what courts would often say when striking
those laws down.

00:08:32.779 --> 00:08:37.169
Reform legislation was less developed in the
South, but they were busy rolling back reconstruction

00:08:37.169 --> 00:08:41.690
and creating laws that limited the civil rights
of African Americans, known as Jim Crow Laws.

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:46.120
In the west, farmers became politically motivated
over the issue of freight rates. Wait, are

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.790
we talking about railroads? Let’s go to
the ThoughtBubble.

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:52.790
In the 1870s, farmers formed the Grange movement
to put pressure on state governments to establish

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:57.570
fair railroad rates and warehouse charges.
Railroads in particular tended to be pretty

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:01.920
monopolistic: They owned the track going through
town, after all, so it was hard for farmers

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.649
to negotiate fair shipping prices. The Grange
Movement eventually became the Farmer’s

00:09:06.649 --> 00:09:11.540
Alliance movement, which also pushed for economic
cooperation to raise prices, but was split

00:09:11.540 --> 00:09:15.470
into Northern and Southern wings that could
never really get it together. The biggest

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:20.170
idea to come out of the Farmers Alliance was
the subtreasury plan. Under this plan, farmers

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:26.230
would store grain in government warehouses
and get low-rate government loans to buy seed

00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:31.089
and equipment, using the stored grain as collateral.
This would allow farmers to bypass the banks

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:36.149
who increasingly came to be seen, along with
the railroads, as the source of all the farmers’

00:09:36.149 --> 00:09:38.240
troubles.
Eventually these politically motivated farmers

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:42.670
and their supporters grew into a political
party, the People’s Party or Populists.

00:09:42.670 --> 00:09:47.760
In 1892 they held a convention in Omaha and
put forth a remarkably reform minded plan,

00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:50.649
particularly given that this was put forth
in Omaha, which included:

00:09:50.649 --> 00:09:54.360
The Sub-Treasury Plan, (which didn’t exactly
happen, although the deal farmers ended up

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.130
with was probably better for them) Government
Ownership of Railroads (which sort of happened,

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.779
if you count Amtrak)
Graduated Income Tax (which did happen, after

00:10:01.779 --> 00:10:05.620
the passage of the 16th amendment)
Government Control of the Currency (which

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.839
happened with the creation of the Federal
Reserve System)

00:10:07.839 --> 00:10:11.560
Recognition of the Rights of Laborers to Form
Unions (which happened both at the state and

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:15.510
federal level)
and Free Coinage of Silver to produce more

00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:18.380
money, which we’ll get to in a second
The People’s Party attempted to appeal to

00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:23.540
a broad coalition of “producing classes”
especially miners and industrial workers,

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:28.060
and it was particularly successful with those
groups in Colorado and Idaho. As the preamble

00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:30.089
to the party platform put it:

00:10:30.089 --> 00:10:34.910
“Corruption dominates the ballot box, the
Legislatures, the congress and touches even

00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:39.680
the ermine of the bench … From the same
prolific womb of governmental injustice we

00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:43.880
breed the two great classes – tramps and
millionaires.”

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.910
Thanks, Thought Bubble. So, some western states
were so Populist, they even granted women

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:52.600
the right to vote in the 1890s, which added
tremendously to the Populist’s electoral

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.800
power.
But most American voters stuck with the two

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.610
main parties. Industrial workers never really
joined in large numbers because the Populist

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:04.500
calls for free coinage of silver would lead
to inflation, especially in food prices, and

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:07.589
that would hurt urban laborers.
But if it hadn’t been for that threat of

00:11:07.589 --> 00:11:11.370
silver inflation, we might have three major
political parties in the U.S. today. Or at

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:15.360
least two different ones. Stupid inflation,
always ruining everything.

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:17.940
Populist leaders also struggled to unify because
racism.

00:11:17.940 --> 00:11:22.209
Some Populist leaders, like Tom Watson, argued
that black and white poor farmers were in

00:11:22.209 --> 00:11:26.380
the same boat, but Southern populists were
not inclined to take up the fight against

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.570
segregation, and even Watson himself later
began spouting anti-Semitic rhetoric.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:35.130
But, in the halcyon Populist days of 1892,
their presidential candidate, James Weaver,

00:11:35.130 --> 00:11:41.269
gained 1 million votes as a third party candidate.
He carried 5 western states and got 22 electoral

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:44.410
votes, which is better than Mondale did.
But the best known Populist candidate was

00:11:44.410 --> 00:11:49.149
actually the Democratic nominee for president
in 1896, William Jennings Bryan.

00:11:49.149 --> 00:11:53.829
Bryan, who once spoke of America as being
crucified on a cross of gold, firmly supported

00:11:53.829 --> 00:11:58.490
free coinage of silver in the hopes that increasing
the amount of money in circulation would raise

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:02.110
prices for farmers and make it easier for
people to pay off their debts.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.709
Williams Jennings Bryan is probably better
known for the anti-evolution stance he took

00:12:05.709 --> 00:12:09.660
in the famous Scopes “Monkey Trial,” where
he was up against none other than Clarence

00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.269
Darrow.
But he did almost become president. So, the

00:12:12.269 --> 00:12:15.940
Populists were really wary of Bryan as a Democrat,
because they feared that their ideas would

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:19.699
be reduced to simply “free silver,” but
they voted for him anyway.

00:12:19.699 --> 00:12:23.440
But Bryan still lost the 1896 election to
William McKinley in what has become known

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:28.110
as the first modern political campaign, because
the business classes gave McKinley’s campaign

00:12:28.110 --> 00:12:32.810
an unprecedented $10 million.
Which these days will buy you nine ads in

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.860
Iowa. But back then, it won you an entire
presidential election. He won the electoral

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:42.790
college in a landslide 271-176.
Bryan’s defeat in 1896 effectively put an

00:12:42.790 --> 00:12:47.440
end to the Populist Party. The corruption
in government, both federal and local, continued,

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.310
and new journalists called Muckrakers began
exposing it in the press.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.940
Even though they were defeated at the polls,
Populist ideas, especially direct election

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:58.250
of senators and a progressive income tax,
quickly became mainstream.

00:12:58.250 --> 00:13:02.449
Now, these days we don’t necessarily associate
those ideas with Populists, which suggests

00:13:02.449 --> 00:13:05.850
that maybe they were right to worry about
hitching their wagon to Bryan’s star.

00:13:05.850 --> 00:13:10.070
But in the end, would you rather have your
name survive or see your ideas enacted?

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:13.860
But of course many of the problems that the
Populists were concerned with persisted, as

00:13:13.860 --> 00:13:17.709
did the scourge of Jim Crow. We’ll discuss
those next week when we look at the Progressive

00:13:17.709 --> 00:13:22.300
Era. Thanks for watching.
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.399
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith
Danko. The associate producer is Danica Johnson.

00:13:25.399 --> 00:13:28.980
The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer, Rosianna Rojas, and

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:32.389
myself. And our graphics team is Thought Café.
Okay, I’ll make the transition, but I think

00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:35.750
you’ll want to keep filming this. Every
week there’s a new caption for the Libertage.

00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:38.910
If you’d like to suggest one in comments,
you can do so where you can also ask questions

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:42.660
about today’s video that will be answered
by our team of historians.

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:46.720
Thank you for watching Crash Course and as we
say in my hometown, don’t forget to be awesome.
