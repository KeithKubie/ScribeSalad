00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.890
First consider the
expression for negative 5

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.620
plus the quantity of 4 times x.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.650
Now, take the product of
negative 8 and that expression

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:11.160
and then add 6.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.930
So let's do it step by step.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.340
First, we're going to have
this expression-- negative 5

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.040
plus something.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.115
So it's going to be negative 5
plus the quantity of 4 times x.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.730
Well, that's just
going to be 4x.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.510
So it's going to be
negative 5 plus 4x.

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.520
So that's this
expression up here.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.770
Now, take the product
of negative 8,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.120
so were going to
just take negative 8,

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.500
and we're going to multiply
the product of negative 8

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.595
and that expression.

00:00:39.595 --> 00:00:40.970
So we're going to
take negative 8

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.390
and multiply it
so that expression

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.290
is this thing right over here.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.150
So if we say the product of
negative 8 in that expression

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.520
is going to be negative
8 times that expression,

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.180
that expression is negative 5
plus 4x, so that's negative 8.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.640
That's that expression.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.269
The product of the two, so
we could put a multiplication

00:01:08.269 --> 00:01:10.060
sign there, or we could
just leave that out

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.210
and implicitly it would
mean multiplication,

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.720
take the product of negative
8 and that expression

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.170
and then add 6.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.550
So that would be then
adding 6 right over here.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:27.860
So we could write it as negative
8 open parentheses negative 5

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.370
plus 4x and then add 6.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.360
Let's do one more.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.920
First, consider the expression
the sum of 7 and-- so

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.710
that's going to be
7 plus something--

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.590
and the product of
negative 2 and x.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.690
The product of negative
2 and x is negative 2x.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.020
So it's 7 plus negative 2x.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.150
We could write
that as 7 minus 2x.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.300
So this is equal to 7 minus 2x.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.350
These are the same expression.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.420
What expression would be 4 plus?

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.830
So now we're saying
4 plus the quantity

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.460
of 2 times that expression?

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.200
So it's going to be
4 plus some quantity.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.570
I'll put that in parentheses.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:20.680
The quantity of 2
times-- I'll do this

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.610
in magenta or in yellow.

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.920
2 times that expression--
let me do this in blue--

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.720
that expression is this
thing right over here.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.230
So 4 plus the quantity of 2
times that expression, 2 times

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.340
7 minus 2x.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.408
And we are done.
