1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,400
This is Jocko podcast number
one 87 with David Burke and me,

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:08,970
Jocko Willink. Good
evening Dave. Good evening.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,880
And in case anyone was wondering
where Echo Charles is at this time,

4
00:00:14,881 --> 00:00:18,510
echo is actually in Hawaii

5
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,840
trying to get back in touch with,

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:28,000
I know the land as we used to call
it and he will be back in a few more

7
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:32,220
episodes. In the meantime, I've got
Dave Burke here who now lives in the

8
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,470
AOT of San Diego, and if
you don't know about Dave,

9
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:42,950
he was on this podcast number 69 in number
one 35 he was a Marine Corps fighter

10
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:47,250
pilot through the f 18
he was a top gun pilot,

11
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,910
top gun instructor, top
gun, senior instructor,

12
00:00:50,911 --> 00:00:53,910
F 16 pilot f 22 pilot f 35 pilot

13
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,380
the first and still only one of a few
pilots qualified on all those platforms.

14
00:01:01,721 --> 00:01:06,100
He was the first commanding officer
of an f 35 operational squadron.

15
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:08,290
And on top of that,

16
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:13,470
he was the commander of ANGLICO salt six
on the ground with us in the battle of

17
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,793
Ramadi.

18
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:19,800
And he and his team did
scores of operations with u
bruiser and he is now with

19
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:27,321
us on the team at echelon front where
he leads the long range leadership

20
00:01:28,441 --> 00:01:30,840
development and alignment program.

21
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,410
Okay.

22
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:36,420
So Dave, thanks for coming on and filling
in for echo. It's good to be here,

23
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:37,254
man.

24
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,530
Have you been brushing up on your video
games and eighties and nineties movies?

25
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,050
Unfortunately, no, I'm not gonna
be able to fill in for that check.

26
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,050
Well actually it's a good thing that
you do have the experience that you have

27
00:01:55,051 --> 00:01:58,230
and it doesn't have very much to do with
Super Mario brothers cause I want to

28
00:01:58,231 --> 00:02:02,770
talk tactics and it's
one of my, all right,

29
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,140
I wrote that it was one of my favorite
Marine Corps doctrinal publications.

30
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:08,550
That's, that's kind of a,

31
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,240
that's really a big statement
as if I sit around and grade,

32
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:15,780
which one's my favorite, but it
definitely is up. There it is.

33
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:19,410
M C D p One tack three tactics.

34
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,830
So let's get into it.

35
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:30,590
How long, how long were you in the Marine
Corps for Dave? 23 years. 23 years.

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,700
And you retired as what a lieutenant
colonel, 10 o'clock check.

37
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:38,270
Did you, so you went to
the basic school? I did.

38
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,290
Did you guys cover this in
the basic school? Absolutely.

39
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,630
And actually when I went to the basic
school in 1994 it was the predecessors,

40
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:47,990
basically the same pub, uh, the
one dash three at a different,

41
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:50,000
slightly different name but
pretty much the same stuff.

42
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:55,460
And I actually looked at this
one is dated July of 1997.

43
00:02:55,461 --> 00:03:00,130
I looked for a, a newer one and
there isn't one. This is it. Yup.

44
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:05,110
And it's interesting cause
you'll, everyone will see
there's examples in here.

45
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:09,580
They don't have examples obviously
from Iraq and Afghanistan or Iraq too.

46
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:12,430
And then Afghanistan. I'm
sure at some point they will.

47
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:18,300
They will do that because they got
a lot of Gulf war examples and I I,

48
00:03:20,051 --> 00:03:20,291
you know,

49
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,800
obviously they were just looking for some
recent examples when they did it in 97

50
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:27,910
that was the last big
war. So there you go.

51
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:29,613
But we'll get into it

52
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:35,970
and the book starts with a forward
and because it's the marine corps,

53
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,060
the Marine Corps, even when they
write a forward, it sounds good.

54
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:42,420
So this is how it starts off.

55
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:46,710
[inaudible] this publication
is about winning in combat.

56
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,713
Yeah.

57
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:53,300
Is there any better way to
start this manual? Nope.

58
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:57,170
This publication is about winning in
combat. Winning requires many things,

59
00:03:57,171 --> 00:04:01,100
excellence in techniques and appreciation
of the enemy, exemplary leadership,

60
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:03,710
battlefield judgement
and focused combat power.

61
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,880
Yet these factors by themselves
do not ensure success in battle.

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Many armors armies,

63
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:13,700
both winners and losers have possessed
many or all of these attributes.

64
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:18,290
When we examine closely the difference
between the differences between Victor

65
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:21,200
and vanquished, we draw one conclusion.

66
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:27,010
Success went to the army's whose leaders
senior and junior could best focus

67
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:33,170
their efforts, their skills, and
their resources toward a decisive end.

68
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,080
Okay.

69
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:38,820
Sounds like the Marine Corp is a saying
that leadership is the most important

70
00:04:38,821 --> 00:04:41,460
thing on the battlefield.
Repeatedly. When you're at TBS,

71
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,970
you're there to learn to be a leader.
That is what you hear every single day.

72
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,930
Leadership is the difference there.

73
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:52,860
Success arose not merely from
excellence in techniques, procedures,

74
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:54,870
and material, but from their leader,

75
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:00,060
but from their leaders abilities to
uniquely and effectively combine them.

76
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:06,040
Winning and combat depends upon tactical
leaders who can think creatively and

77
00:05:06,041 --> 00:05:07,000
act decisively.

78
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:13,290
So taking all of these techniques and
these procedures and the material and

79
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:19,390
being able to take those things and
mix them up and combine them together,

80
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:24,310
that is what makes, that's the
winning combination, the creativity.

81
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:28,420
How often did people at TBS
talk about being creative?

82
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,110
Believe it or not, they, they never
used those. They didn't say be creative.

83
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:32,350
They,

84
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,650
they would say think they'd give you all
these doctrine and pubs and all these

85
00:05:35,651 --> 00:05:36,880
rules, but they would say,

86
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:39,340
you actually need to think and think
of what makes the most sense here.

87
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,270
And they bred a lot of flexibility. I
never remember anybody saying be creative,

88
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,880
but they said, think about
it, think of this makes sense.

89
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:48,910
And if it doesn't do something else,
and these are the rules, the guidelines.

90
00:05:48,911 --> 00:05:51,730
But there was always as maneuvering
around there to bring all those pieces

91
00:05:51,731 --> 00:05:52,564
together.

92
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,800
I say that combat is an
exercise in creativity

93
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,660
and people,

94
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:03,500
especially people that don't know
anything about combat or war or anything,

95
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:08,000
they always kind of, that
always surprises them, right?

96
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:13,030
Because they think creative being
creative is writing a song or painting a

97
00:06:14,451 --> 00:06:16,400
picture. But for me,

98
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,040
being a creative is positioning your
machine gunners effectively. Yeah.

99
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,000
Right. I mean that's, that's
like true creativity. Yeah.

100
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:27,110
I mean the mind
leadership's not a template.

101
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,720
It isn't just here's what to do in
this situation. You have to think,

102
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:31,670
you have to think creatively
and come up with the best idea.

103
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,580
I see that in mixed martial
arts. So one of, uh,

104
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:37,250
one of my favorite mixed
martial artists of all time.

105
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:41,090
Do you know who fade or Emelianenko
is? I do. You do? I do. Okay.

106
00:06:41,091 --> 00:06:45,920
I'm impressed with your knowledge.
So two things about fake door.

107
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,360
Number one, he was completely stoic
and never showed any emotions.

108
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,830
Win or lose, didn't matter.

109
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:55,100
You could look at him after a fight and
you wouldn't know if he just won the

110
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:59,150
pride GP or if he just lost his first
match in his life. He looked the same.

111
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,740
And so that's one very good lesson learned
from fade or the other lesson learned

112
00:07:06,561 --> 00:07:11,561
from fate or is it fade or would take
the skills that he had and apply them in

113
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:17,300
very creative ways where
you'd say, oh, he just did,

114
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,400
you know, a judo throw
followed by a submission,

115
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,810
a sambos submission attempt to followed
by just dropping bombs of ground and

116
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,730
pound and, and those are
all three separate things.

117
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,080
And he would just mix them up all really
well together. And that when you see,

118
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:38,380
that's like the new level of mixed
martial arts is the older generation,

119
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,600
hey, I was really good at Jujitsu, or
hey, I was really good at wrestling.

120
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:41,931
Or Hey,

121
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:44,870
I was really good at striking and I would
kind of stay in my lane and if I could

122
00:07:44,871 --> 00:07:48,650
bring you into my world, I could
beat you. Now it's just who has,

123
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:52,790
who can take all these tools and get
creative with them and apply them to this

124
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,280
scenario that they're in.
Same thing with leadership.

125
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,010
Same thing with combat
leadership. And by the way,

126
00:07:58,011 --> 00:08:02,000
same thing with all leadership. It
doesn't only apply to combat check.

127
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:06,800
All right. Moving on. This book
pertains equally to all marine leaders.

128
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,190
Whether they're duties entail, combat,
service, support, combat support,

129
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,300
or combat arms.

130
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:15,270
All Marines face tactical decisions
in battle regardless of their role.

131
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,560
As tactical leaders must develop and
hone their war fighting skills through

132
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:19,610
study and practice.

133
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,790
This publication serves as a guide
for that professional development.

134
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,690
It addresses the theory of tactics
and its application in a chaotic and

135
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,920
uncertain environment.

136
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,720
The concepts and ideas
within this publication are
battle tested throughout our

137
00:08:34,761 --> 00:08:35,151
history.

138
00:08:35,151 --> 00:08:38,150
One of the most important reasons for
the success of the United States Marine

139
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:41,930
Corps has been the military skill of
our leaders at every level level of

140
00:08:41,931 --> 00:08:45,710
command. Through their tactical
skill and battlefield judgment.

141
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:50,810
Our commanders achieve tactical and
operational advantage at the decisive time

142
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:55,950
and place, and they talk a lot
about the chaotic and environment,

143
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,810
which as we know, that's what combat
is. And by the way, that's what life is.

144
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,180
That's what businesses,
that's what the world is.

145
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:11,250
So getting into chapter
one, understanding tactics,

146
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,673
Huh?

147
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,880
Such a straight forward, the marine corps,

148
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,130
the Marine Corps doctrines,

149
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,730
doctrinal material is so
straightforward and so simply written.

150
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,960
It's just outstanding.

151
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,890
Starts off with a couple of quotes

152
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:35,030
in tactics. The most important thing
is not whether you go left or right,

153
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,890
but why you go left or right,

154
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,280
and that's when General Al Gray,

155
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:47,090
29th commandant of the Marine Corps,
41 years, three Purple Hearts,

156
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,630
Korea, Vietnam, a Mustang
officer by the way, get some.

157
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,850
He's the only one. He's the only,

158
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,970
he's the only commandant
that's pictured in his,

159
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,550
in his official picture as the commandant
of the Marine Corps in his cabinet

160
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:04,670
scam. He's absolutely
get some, he's a legend.

161
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,490
I think I had like a maybe a year or two
overlapped with him where I was in and

162
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:11,300
he was in,

163
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:16,300
I think he retired in like 91 or
92 or something like that and yeah,

164
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,380
so there you go. The most important
thing is why understanding why this is

165
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,480
underlying tenant, really of decentralized
command but of of all leadership.

166
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,540
Next one is next quotas.

167
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,690
There is only one principle
of war and that's this.

168
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,620
Hit the other fellow as quick
as you can, as hard as you can,

169
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,320
where it hurts him the
most when he ain't looking.

170
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:46,310
That's Sir William Slim,
who's actually a Brit

171
00:10:48,550 --> 00:10:50,500
fought world war one and World War II.

172
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:54,730
What's up with fighting in World War
One and World War II? Totally mad.

173
00:10:55,690 --> 00:10:56,523
It's just,

174
00:10:56,910 --> 00:11:00,790
it's like we've talked about world
war one on this podcast a few times.

175
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,950
You and I have and did what?

176
00:11:02,951 --> 00:11:05,900
A savage experience and to the roll
right back and do it again, you know,

177
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:10,720
25 years later. Yeah. Yeah. What's
up with that? Hey, yeah. You know,

178
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:15,130
you barely survived. Guess what? Go
get some more and my, the way he,

179
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:17,680
he like led the fight in Japan.

180
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:21,550
I led the fight against Japan and in
Burma. I mean that guy was no joke.

181
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:24,520
So there's the principle go hard,

182
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,810
go fast and when they're
not looking. All right.

183
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,390
Continuing on this book is
about winning in combat.

184
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:34,780
Winning requires a thorough understanding
of and knowledge of tactics.

185
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,790
But what is tactics?

186
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:42,490
An art and a science tactics is the art
and science of winning engagements and

187
00:11:42,491 --> 00:11:46,300
battles. It includes the use
of firepower and maneuver,

188
00:11:46,690 --> 00:11:51,580
the integration of different arms and
the immediate exploitation of success to

189
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:56,581
defeat the enemy as well as the
sustainment of forces during combat.

190
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:01,000
So think about that right there you
got, you got the art and science,

191
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,560
it includes firepower, firepower,
maneuver, covered, move, fire, maneuver,

192
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,130
right. Different arms,
taking all the different,

193
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,490
all the different assets that you
have and applying them correctly.

194
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:14,380
And then on top of that,

195
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:17,540
the immediate exploitation of
success to defeat the enemy.

196
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,810
So when things are going good and
you see the enemy start to crack,

197
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,250
it's time to go drop the hammer. Yup.

198
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:27,670
It also includes the technical
application of combat power,

199
00:12:27,671 --> 00:12:32,380
which consists of those techniques and
procedures for accomplishing specific tax

200
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:33,670
within a tactical action.

201
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,020
So I guess they're saying technical
application of combat power.

202
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,420
This is like one level below tactics.

203
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:42,910
This is like you're going to
shoot correctly, you're gonna.

204
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,440
Yeah. And you actually have to know
how all of your equipment works.

205
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,640
This machine gun will,

206
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:50,520
we'll go this far and be effective
at this range and beyond that range.

207
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,840
You need another piece of equipment.

208
00:12:51,841 --> 00:12:53,790
So you have to actually know
all these technical things.

209
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,140
It's no different in an airplane.

210
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,650
You have to have all the understanding
of how these things work.

211
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:02,340
But that by itself isn't enough. That's
where the creativity comes in and hey,

212
00:13:02,341 --> 00:13:05,070
I'm going to use this machine gun to get
this reaction and they're going to move

213
00:13:05,071 --> 00:13:07,530
in some other direction and then
I'm going apply other combat power.

214
00:13:07,531 --> 00:13:10,410
I have to know what that power
can do and where and how it works.

215
00:13:10,890 --> 00:13:13,260
And that's the art that they're talking
about is bringing all these things in

216
00:13:13,261 --> 00:13:15,480
together and the good commanders
recognize they see it go.

217
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,800
Now it's time for this.

218
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,740
Not because the book says the range
because they see it as a leader.

219
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:20,933
And to apply that.

220
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:26,310
I was in the talk for the first,

221
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,340
the five oh six in Ramadi and their
battalion commander was just like such a

222
00:13:30,341 --> 00:13:35,341
legit guy and there was a lot of mayhem
going on and he's sitting there in a

223
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,120
chair in the talk, just, you
know, just a normal whatever,

224
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:44,680
crappy chair and any, they're
getting questions from the field,

225
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,010
they want to drop like a building.
They wanted to call queue off.

226
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,670
There's a bunch of things going
on. And this guy, he was just an I,

227
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,590
one day he's going to be on
the podcast. He was just,

228
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:56,080
but I'm just watching him and this
was when I first got to her money.

229
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,660
I'm watching this guy and they're
going, they're going, hey sir,

230
00:13:58,661 --> 00:14:00,010
they want to bring
tanks down to this area.

231
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,680
They got through there was even
fire and he'd like look at it,

232
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:06,130
kind of glance over at the map
and he'd be, he'd say, do it

233
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,220
just as calm as you could possibly be.
Pretty awesome. Yeah. That guy had some,

234
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,430
uh, some serious he had,

235
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:18,820
he had a good handle on the art
and the science back to the book.

236
00:14:18,821 --> 00:14:22,870
Tactics were first the concepts and
methods we use to accomplish a particular

237
00:14:22,871 --> 00:14:23,650
military.

238
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:28,120
I made a particular objective in either
combat or military operations other than

239
00:14:28,121 --> 00:14:29,380
war in war.

240
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:33,460
Tactics is the application of combat
power to defeat the enemy and engagements

241
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,443
and battles.

242
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,740
Combat power is the total destructive
force we can bring to bear against the

243
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:39,520
enemy.

244
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:43,900
It is a unique product of a
river of a variety of physical,

245
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:48,980
moral and mental factors. C,

246
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:52,460
so this, so this is when you start
talking about leadership, right? Because,

247
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:55,730
because, okay, the physical thing
we get, we get what guns are,

248
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:59,000
we get what airplanes are, we
get what tactical maneuvers are.

249
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,940
But then when you start talking about the,

250
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,000
the moral and the mental factors and how
are you going to get a bunch of human

251
00:15:06,021 --> 00:15:09,530
beings to do something that is
going to be dangerous to them.

252
00:15:10,770 --> 00:15:10,900
Yeah.

253
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,280
Yeah. And to expect that from
a 19 year old marine. He's,

254
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,160
they said at the beginning,
this is leadership at every
level. Lance corporals,

255
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:23,310
fire team leaders and
expecting and demanding that
they behave morally in what's

256
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:27,340
going to be maybe the most brutal physical
situation there'll be in their lives

257
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:30,490
and recognizing that without that
you're going to lose in the long run.

258
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:34,630
It's a losing plan to be devoid of
morals in doing this. In combat,

259
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:39,880
it's pretty amazing. That's the
s the super strategic picture.

260
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,590
Yeah, the long game.

261
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:45,070
They realize without it in the end
we will lose if we don't have that,

262
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,750
if we don't have the moral
high ground. Right. Loose

263
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:53,410
tactics results in the actions and
counteractions between opposing forces.

264
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:58,300
It includes the use of maneuver supported
by the application and coordination of

265
00:15:58,301 --> 00:16:03,010
fires to gain advantage in order to
defeat the enemy in military operations.

266
00:16:03,011 --> 00:16:06,520
Other than war tactics may be the schemes
and methods by which we perform other

267
00:16:06,521 --> 00:16:10,090
missions such as to control a crowd or
provide a secure environment for the

268
00:16:10,091 --> 00:16:14,800
delivery of food medicine or supplies
to a nation or people in need.

269
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:16,523
Okay.

270
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:19,670
As stated in the definition.
I wonder if this one,

271
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:23,810
when this gets rewritten right
now, if they'll tone back,

272
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:27,410
if they won't mention as much like the
military operations other than war.

273
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:30,930
Cause that in 1997 there was a lot of,

274
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,130
it kind of seemed like what
the world was going to be.

275
00:16:34,131 --> 00:16:36,080
Now you know it's going to be, hey look,

276
00:16:36,081 --> 00:16:39,950
we might not be fighting a war
ever again, but we at least,

277
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:41,870
you know we're going to be
doing things that will require,

278
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:43,280
that's what they called
it a military first.

279
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:45,620
For those of you that are
wondering what that is,

280
00:16:45,621 --> 00:16:47,240
military operations other than the war.

281
00:16:47,241 --> 00:16:49,730
This is like a humanitarian
assistance mission.

282
00:16:49,731 --> 00:16:53,600
This is like a security and stabilization
mission. So those kind of things,

283
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,310
crowd control, those kinds of things or
what they're talking about. And in the,

284
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,700
this was written in 97
so, and it certainly,

285
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:06,260
you certainly could have, if you
had a naive view of the world,

286
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,420
you certainly could have
fought yourself. You know,

287
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,030
all we really gonna fight another
like actual war are. We Really gonna

288
00:17:14,530 --> 00:17:15,363
do that

289
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,010
and that it,

290
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:22,010
it's really easy to look at it
from a logical perspective and say,

291
00:17:22,690 --> 00:17:24,490
lessen America's just this giant country.

292
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,600
We have this super military force and
technology and no one is going to step up

293
00:17:31,151 --> 00:17:33,280
to the plate. Yeah. Try
and get some. Right,

294
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,740
so let's just focus on these other things.

295
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:37,170
Okay.

296
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:38,470
He pretty easy to think that. Yeah.

297
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,970
I actually remember when I got in the
Marine Corps in 94 Desert Storm was in the

298
00:17:42,971 --> 00:17:45,880
rear view mirror. I kind of missed
that big hop and I remember thinking,

299
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,130
I wonder if I'm ever really
going to get into combat.

300
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:53,040
You and a lot of years went by before
the opportunity was there and a lot of us

301
00:17:53,310 --> 00:17:57,660
thought that might ever happen in my
career. Yeah. A lot of people never did.

302
00:17:57,661 --> 00:18:01,140
They spent that decade in between 91 2001
they did eight nine 10 years and they

303
00:18:01,141 --> 00:18:02,700
got out and never saw anything like that.

304
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:07,970
Our newer guys that did 25 30 years came
in in 97319741975 know 1971 like if you

305
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:13,141
join,

306
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:18,141
if you got to the seal teams
in 1971 or 1972 you didn't you,

307
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,660
you know you didn't go to Vietnam. Yeah.
Well actually, so let's look at it.

308
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:25,190
You, if you went straight into
the seal, the seal teams, you,

309
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:30,070
you joined in 1970 it took
you, it took you, you know,

310
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,620
to go through bootcamp.
Next thing you know,

311
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:36,480
it's 1971 and a half and then you show
up at a seal team and now it's 1972 and

312
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:39,170
there's no, they're not deploying platoons
anymore. Yeah. So there's a couple,

313
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,670
there's some, some odds and
ends are still going over,

314
00:18:41,671 --> 00:18:44,670
but they're not deploying straight
up platoons. Or if you're a new guy,

315
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,890
you don't go. And now if you didn't
do anything in the Gulf, which was,

316
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:52,980
there's a couple of platoons in the Gulf,
there was a couple platoons in Panama,

317
00:18:52,981 --> 00:18:54,990
there's a couple platoons in Grenada,
there were, you know what I mean?

318
00:18:54,991 --> 00:18:57,180
It's like if you weren't
one of those people,

319
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,650
you could easily have gone through
30 year career. Next thing you know,

320
00:19:01,651 --> 00:19:03,990
you look up it's 2001 you're you, well,

321
00:19:03,991 --> 00:19:08,010
it's the year 2000 and you're
retiring from 1970 to 2000 yeah.

322
00:19:08,011 --> 00:19:12,510
And people sometimes forget the Gulf
War was like four days. You know, the,

323
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,630
the sustained combat operations, it
was like 96 hours, something like that.

324
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:19,080
And if you miss that, which a lot of
people did, that was the big show.

325
00:19:19,590 --> 00:19:21,900
A an entire generation. Yeah. Yeah.

326
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,330
Going back to the book as the,
as stated in the definition,

327
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,130
tactics is a combination of art and
science to gain victory over the enemy.

328
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:33,530
Yeah.

329
00:19:33,530 --> 00:19:38,530
The Art of tactics lies in how we create
creative creatively form and apply

330
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,170
military force in a given situation.

331
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:44,493
Okay.

332
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:50,180
I really like talking about
that creatively form and
apply military force in a

333
00:19:50,181 --> 00:19:53,330
given situation. It involves
the creation, positioning,

334
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:55,130
and maneuver of combat power.

335
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:58,820
When do we flank the enemy
and when do we ambush him?

336
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,680
When do we attack and when
do we infiltrate? How do
we use speed and momentum?

337
00:20:03,681 --> 00:20:06,290
To achieve a decisive advantage.

338
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:11,000
This creativity is developed
as a developed capacity,

339
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:15,560
acquired through education,
practice and experience.

340
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,680
How much more?

341
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,520
How much more qualified are you
right now to be on the battleground,

342
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:31,170
be on the battlefield in Ramadi in 2006
how much more qualified are you now than

343
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:35,290
you were then? The things
that I would see now,

344
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:39,110
the things that I would know to look for
now that I didn't even think of then w

345
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,460
and what you just said, that that, that
last comment that that's everywhere,

346
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,400
that, that, that training piece,

347
00:20:46,430 --> 00:20:50,890
all the pieces go into that and and any
one of them without the other doesn't

348
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:53,440
work. You can't just be
awesome at one thing.

349
00:20:53,441 --> 00:20:56,290
You can't just be all about
the size of these things.

350
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:57,910
And when you usually work creativity,

351
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:00,790
I mean when you see people do things
like that and it where it's like,

352
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:01,990
it's like artistry.

353
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:05,260
You see just the flow and the maneuvers
and the things that are coming in.

354
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:08,050
And I'm sure that that first, the
five or six when he said do it,

355
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,040
he's actually looking up and seeing
this is the reaction that I'm gonna get.

356
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,780
This is what's going to happen
when it happens. You know,

357
00:21:13,781 --> 00:21:16,030
he's seeing those things. Uh,

358
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:18,850
and I love that image of him just
sitting there in the chair and like,

359
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:20,500
okay,

360
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:24,070
Yup, do it. And No, and knowing
what's going to happen, you know,

361
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,020
wellbeing beyond what,

362
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,980
what people can see in real
time and knowing that you
can't know what's going to

363
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:31,290
happen. For sure. I mean,

364
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,730
at the same time you're saying you gotta
do it and then you're thinking, okay,

365
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,630
I know there's a, at least an 80% chance
that this goes the way I'm thinking.

366
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:37,990
Oh, go.

367
00:21:37,990 --> 00:21:40,750
And there's also a 20% chance that this
isn't something completely different

368
00:21:40,751 --> 00:21:44,710
happens. And he's also totally
relinquished control of what happens next.

369
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:47,110
I mean, there's nothing he
can do once he says do it,

370
00:21:47,770 --> 00:21:51,100
he's totally relinquished control of
what's gonna happen at that point with his

371
00:21:51,101 --> 00:21:55,690
guys. And that's it and
the the best leaders,

372
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:58,240
they're completely comfortable doing that
because they know what their guys are

373
00:21:58,241 --> 00:22:00,340
going to do because they
have trained them so hard.

374
00:22:00,341 --> 00:22:04,930
They have repeated that situation so
many times that they are for all the cast

375
00:22:04,931 --> 00:22:07,300
that is definitely going
to ensue. He's extremely,

376
00:22:07,330 --> 00:22:09,640
he knows exactly what his guys are
going to do and how they're gonna react.

377
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,510
Back to the book, the Science of tactics
lies in the tactical application,

378
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:18,880
the technical application of combat power.

379
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:21,940
It includes mastering the techniques
and procedures that contribute to the

380
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:25,720
development of war fighting such
as mark marksmanship, navigation,

381
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:27,280
gunnery and close air support.

382
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:31,750
The execution of these techniques and
procedures must become second nature for

383
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:32,470
us.

384
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,030
This requires intensive and continuous
training without mastery of basic war

385
00:22:37,031 --> 00:22:37,960
fighting skills,

386
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:42,940
artistry and creativity in their
application are impossible.

387
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,520
Discipline equals freedom.

388
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:50,390
You've got to have the discipline on
the little things and then you can get

389
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:51,260
creative with them.

390
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:52,483
Huh.

391
00:22:56,130 --> 00:22:59,480
Now that we've examined the
art and science of tactics,

392
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,050
let us look at how we can use tactics
to compliment strategy and campaigning

393
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:07,200
strategy and campaign and bring our forces
to a particular place at a particular

394
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:09,630
time. We use tactics to win in combat.

395
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:14,460
A war typically involves many individual
engagements that form a continuous

396
00:23:14,461 --> 00:23:15,660
fabric of activity.

397
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,320
War typically involves many individual
engagements that form a continuous fabric

398
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:28,560
of activity. There is
so much going on in war.

399
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:34,230
You know, when we did
our first big push into,

400
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:39,590
I guess it was cop iron and there was 50
armor pieces that were getting ready to

401
00:23:40,681 --> 00:23:45,530
go and like one of them, oh look,

402
00:23:45,531 --> 00:23:49,640
someone from the one three, seven
was just talking about, okay,

403
00:23:49,641 --> 00:23:53,450
well here's where we're at with
fuel. And of course, you know,

404
00:23:53,451 --> 00:23:56,900
we had fuel for our home views,
humvees or whatever, you know,

405
00:23:56,930 --> 00:24:01,850
like we drive around, but they had 50
armor pieces that drink like diesel.

406
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:05,450
Like what do you think they get
to? I mean it's just something,

407
00:24:05,451 --> 00:24:06,710
it's just something completely crazy.

408
00:24:06,711 --> 00:24:09,740
Probably two miles to the gallon
or something like that. Yeah,

409
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:13,820
I think it's gallons per mile. Yeah. I
think it's that much worse that much.

410
00:24:13,830 --> 00:24:16,940
Yeah. But here we were
just thinking, okay,

411
00:24:16,941 --> 00:24:19,130
well the armor just going to be where
the arm is going to be and that's all

412
00:24:19,131 --> 00:24:21,950
good. But they're
thinking, oh, actually no.

413
00:24:21,951 --> 00:24:26,780
We need to have whatever thousands and
thousands of gallons of diesel fuels

414
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:28,730
gotta be here and it's gotta be
there and it's gotta be delivered.

415
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:32,000
It's gotta be good. And it's
coming from where it's coming from,

416
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:36,510
some totally different place and all that
stuff has to be orchestrated and boom.

417
00:24:36,620 --> 00:24:38,450
And there you go. And then we're
going on this combat operation.

418
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:44,160
There's so much going on. And by
the way, convoys get hit fuel,

419
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:47,030
big fuel trucks that have 28,000 gallons,

420
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:51,560
they get hit on an ambush and they
don't even make it to Ramadi like that

421
00:24:51,561 --> 00:24:56,250
happened regularly. Yup, absolutely.
And on the other side of that, when he,

422
00:24:56,450 --> 00:24:58,160
that phrase, that continuous fabric,

423
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:02,270
you also have to get the
folks at your lowest level,

424
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,740
the folks out there with a rifle,

425
00:25:03,950 --> 00:25:07,370
maybe the guys driving the tank
to recognize how everything hell,

426
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:11,780
every individual thing they do actually
affects this whole campaign and that

427
00:25:11,781 --> 00:25:16,220
even those small individual actions that
seem like there's nothing else going on

428
00:25:16,221 --> 00:25:18,980
in the world other than you and maybe
that that sniper on the roof for that

429
00:25:18,981 --> 00:25:19,814
position,

430
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:24,140
that even your interaction with that
one thing will have implications all the

431
00:25:24,141 --> 00:25:27,560
way down to the entire campaign to
the strategic level. The Marine Corps,

432
00:25:27,561 --> 00:25:28,580
I don't think they say it anymore.

433
00:25:28,581 --> 00:25:32,000
They used to have a phrase called the
strategic corporal with the recognition

434
00:25:32,001 --> 00:25:33,170
that even this engagement,

435
00:25:33,530 --> 00:25:37,220
you are influencing so many other things
at this broad level that you actually

436
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:40,430
have to be aware of your actions and
that gets back to that comment about even

437
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:41,330
the moral behavior.

438
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:45,860
Think of the Times that we saw guys do
things that we knew or were wrong and how

439
00:25:45,861 --> 00:25:49,340
it totally undermined the big strategy
because everything got shifted away from

440
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:52,610
the war and they got shifted
towards whether we did
something right or wrong and

441
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:56,110
got them the news and all this [inaudible]
was the one I was talking about I

442
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,880
regret for sure, but a couple. So
people acting like knuckleheads. Yep.

443
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:02,000
And next thing you know that,

444
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:05,870
that that had event completely
fueled the insurgency for sure.

445
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:09,980
If that tiny tactical deputy like tiny
tactical event had massive think of how

446
00:26:09,981 --> 00:26:13,820
many enemy fighters that recruited and
made our job strategically that much

447
00:26:13,821 --> 00:26:14,654
harder.

448
00:26:18,050 --> 00:26:20,900
Back to the book in combat,
our objective is victory

449
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:24,823
check.

450
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,330
Sometimes this involves the complete
destruction of an of the enemies forces.

451
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,111
At other times,

452
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:35,111
achieving victory may be possible by
attacking the enemies of will to fight the

453
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:39,710
Marine Corps must be equally prepared
to win during both situations.

454
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:44,670
Those in which the enemy forces must be
completely destroyed as during World War

455
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,330
II and those in which the complete
destruction of the enemies forces.

456
00:26:48,331 --> 00:26:50,970
It may not be necessary or even desirable.

457
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:56,760
As the commanding general of the First
Marine Division in Desert Storm stated,

458
00:26:56,761 --> 00:26:59,100
our focus was not on
destroying everything.

459
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:03,060
Our focus was on the Iraqi
mind and getting behind it.

460
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:07,200
He knew that the path to victory did not
lie in the total destruction of Iraqi

461
00:27:07,201 --> 00:27:10,740
forces, but an undermining
their will to fight,

462
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,220
which they certainly did
very effectively. Yeah.

463
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,380
The environment. Next section.

464
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,040
The tactical arena is a dynamic
ever changing environment.

465
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:27,120
The complexity of this environment
makes combat chaotic and unpredictable.

466
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:29,060
Yeah.

467
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,970
As an example of confusion
and chaos on the battlefield,

468
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:36,710
consider the amphibious assault on
the island of Tarawa in November,

469
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:39,740
1943 during the assault, the
combination of high casualties,

470
00:27:39,890 --> 00:27:44,030
lack of effective communications and
disruption of the second and eighth marine

471
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:44,481
regimens.

472
00:27:44,481 --> 00:27:49,481
Landings on the assault beaches led
to a chaotic and nearly disastrous

473
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:52,100
situation. For the Second Marine Division.

474
00:27:52,730 --> 00:27:55,970
Units were decimated under heavy fire.

475
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:01,480
Surviving Marines huddled together under
a coconut log seawall in inner mingled

476
00:28:03,201 --> 00:28:07,640
units without effective
communications. Landing craft,

477
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:12,260
carrying reinforcements and supplies
could not make it over a core reef to the

478
00:28:12,261 --> 00:28:17,180
landing beaches only through daring
leadership initiative and teamwork where

479
00:28:17,181 --> 00:28:22,181
marines able to get off the beach and
annihilate the defending Japanese force.

480
00:28:23,150 --> 00:28:27,620
The violence of combat only increases
the level of confusion and chaos.

481
00:28:28,910 --> 00:28:29,743
Okay.

482
00:28:30,310 --> 00:28:30,580
Robert Shirad,

483
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:35,580
a time in life correspondent
at [inaudible] Jima gave
testimony to this chaos in

484
00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:38,560
what he called war at its worst.

485
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:40,723
Okay?

486
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:45,840
The first night on Elo Jima can only be
described as a nightmare in hell about

487
00:28:47,621 --> 00:28:50,410
the beach in the morning. Lay the dead.

488
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,310
They had died with the
greatest possible violence.

489
00:28:55,390 --> 00:28:59,410
Nowhere in the Pacific have I
seen such badly mangled bodies.

490
00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:00,840
Okay.

491
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:05,840
Many were cut squarely and half legs
and arms lay 50 feet from any body.

492
00:29:07,930 --> 00:29:08,763
Okay.

493
00:29:09,370 --> 00:29:12,810
Battle is the collision of
opposing forces animate,

494
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,730
interactive and unpredictable.

495
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,930
Unpredictable in behavior
performance varies from week to week,

496
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:25,020
day to day and even hour to hour as a
unit interacts with its environment and

497
00:29:26,021 --> 00:29:26,854
the enemy

498
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,133
[inaudible]

499
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:37,160
rough. I know you and I often
joke about our complete and utter.

500
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,250
Our experience just pails. I
mean obviously in comparison

501
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:45,240
to a, the guys that fought at Tarla,

502
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,810
the guys that fought at evo gene with
the guys that fought Europe in World War

503
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:54,580
II and you get in those
environments, right?

504
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:58,030
Those environments and it is this,

505
00:29:58,031 --> 00:30:03,031
this idea of this dynamic and complex
and ever changing battlefield.

506
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:04,863
There it is.

507
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,333
Okay.

508
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:11,330
Yeah, I've said it a few times
and I still feel this way.

509
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,020
I'm embarrassed sometimes to call
what I did in an airplane combat.

510
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:19,430
I read these books and I listen to the
podcast and I listen to these stories and

511
00:30:19,431 --> 00:30:23,810
it's almost hard for me to even try
to relate to the idea of that I was in

512
00:30:23,811 --> 00:30:26,960
combat and in an airplane, you know,
given what these things sound like.

513
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:31,880
What'd you think about those king
B pilots from, from till? Yeah,

514
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:35,220
I'll, I'll, I'd love to share, swap
stories of those guys. You know, what did,

515
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:37,310
what did I do compared to
what way they did? You know,

516
00:30:37,311 --> 00:30:40,650
there's a quote that I didn't read
and I don't know why I didn't,

517
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,860
I had it marked but I just didn't read it.

518
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:45,800
But there was like a
situation on the ground,

519
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:51,160
there was total enemy fire everywhere
and like one aircraft approached and got

520
00:30:53,391 --> 00:30:57,690
shot out and the team on the
ground, this is, this was one,

521
00:30:57,890 --> 00:30:59,120
it was either one or two, it's one of the,

522
00:30:59,121 --> 00:31:02,420
one of the sod crews was down on the
ground and they're just trying to get

523
00:31:02,421 --> 00:31:03,254
extracted

524
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:05,443
and

525
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,060
did basically all the pilots
are like, hey, we can't go in.

526
00:31:10,061 --> 00:31:11,710
You guys need to move
to a different extract.

527
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:14,170
You need to move to different extracts.
You needed to go somewhere else.

528
00:31:14,171 --> 00:31:18,340
Like we need more fires but we can't
get in there. And this one pilot,

529
00:31:18,341 --> 00:31:22,810
this one can be pilot comes on and he
just comes on the mic and says, can be,

530
00:31:22,811 --> 00:31:27,040
goes down, meaning, Hey, I'm
going in. Yeah, whatever.

531
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:29,260
There's enemy fire. Cool. Watch this.

532
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,730
So legit. I love how this
book is called tactics.

533
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,050
This book about tactics.

534
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:40,630
And I think that section we're on
is called understanding tactics.

535
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:44,410
And they're talking
about the chaos of war.

536
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:49,470
It's not a book, just about tactics do
this, do that. This is what worked. It's,

537
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:52,750
it's about war. And, and you
said it a couple of times,

538
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,090
success in combat is the only measurement
the marine corps ever given their

539
00:31:58,091 --> 00:31:59,770
marines to be successful in combat.

540
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:04,510
And to remind them of just how hard that
actually is and the things that you're

541
00:32:04,511 --> 00:32:08,980
going to see and smell and feel and endure
in combat is well beyond what we can

542
00:32:08,981 --> 00:32:11,440
replicate in training. And
this serves as a reminder.

543
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:15,020
You know day one of you would
Jima and it gets back to,

544
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:20,100
we said it would be pretty arrogant to
think that a day like that could never

545
00:32:20,351 --> 00:32:23,140
happen again in the future that we're
never going to have something like that

546
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:25,330
ever again. I had a guy,

547
00:32:25,331 --> 00:32:30,331
I was working for a guy and
doing a project where were
the brief that was given

548
00:32:30,401 --> 00:32:35,401
was listen we need as seals to kind
of like move in a different direction

549
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:40,010
because since we have, you

550
00:32:40,010 --> 00:32:43,580
know, satellite coverage, we don't
need to do reconnaissance anymore.

551
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:48,620
And since we have t lambs we don't need
to do direct action cause we could just

552
00:32:48,621 --> 00:32:50,840
send a GPS guided missile. Like,

553
00:32:50,841 --> 00:32:54,080
why would you send troops
on the ground to go do that?

554
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:57,290
Like there's no reason to.
And, and this was, you know,

555
00:32:57,291 --> 00:32:58,580
this was around the same time period.

556
00:32:58,581 --> 00:33:03,350
This was like 96 97 and
the theory was, look,

557
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,370
we will not,

558
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:08,750
we as seals are not going to do
a direct action mission again.

559
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,260
It's just not gonna happen.
And you know, I mean I,

560
00:33:11,261 --> 00:33:13,430
I was sitting there listening,
I was disappointed to hear that,

561
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:17,960
but it was hard for me to think
what could bring that about, right?

562
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:21,440
Because every scenario I could
think of was, oh, well you just,

563
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,320
you just send an a a t lamp.
Right? That's what you do. Okay.

564
00:33:24,321 --> 00:33:27,770
Maybe I was thinking maybe like
a hostage rescue scenario. Okay.

565
00:33:27,771 --> 00:33:32,300
That's the one now how often
does that happen? Right? So like,

566
00:33:33,290 --> 00:33:35,720
yeah. And then you know, you
fast forward, what was it,

567
00:33:35,721 --> 00:33:38,570
five or six years from
there and I was doing it,

568
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,930
I was doing a direct action rate almost
every night of the week in Baghdad.

569
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:46,100
And we had been for 15
years. Yes, yes, exactly.

570
00:33:46,130 --> 00:33:50,320
When I got to the fleet in 1998, my first
fighter squadron combat capable squad,

571
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,310
when we got introduced to GPS weapons,

572
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:55,130
first squadron in the Marine
Corps to get a GPS weapon.

573
00:33:55,131 --> 00:33:59,810
And the brief that I was given was
you'll never overfly the target again.

574
00:34:00,350 --> 00:34:03,740
You now have a weapon that you can release
from standoff range that will guide

575
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:06,260
itself to the target. You'll
never have to overfly the target,

576
00:34:06,261 --> 00:34:09,950
which meant the risk goes down. You'll
never have to be worried about smaller,

577
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,270
never overfly the target again. And,
and, and it was three years later,

578
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:14,481
you know,

579
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:17,690
we kicked things off and think of how
many times we had an aircraft directly

580
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:22,470
overhead in every one of those missions,
you know, exposed to the enemy. Uh,

581
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:25,790
and that complacency that came in from
technology will solve these problems for

582
00:34:25,791 --> 00:34:30,110
us. What was the threat to your aircraft
when you were supporting troops on the

583
00:34:30,111 --> 00:34:34,880
ground in Afghanistan? The threat was
small arms and, and shoulder fire, uh,

584
00:34:34,910 --> 00:34:38,060
iron man pads, they call it, you know,
[inaudible] see short range missiles,

585
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:41,960
which the thing of it is, is that if you
get outside the three, four mile range,

586
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:43,760
there are no, there are
literally no threat at all.

587
00:34:43,970 --> 00:34:45,320
But if you get inside that range,

588
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:48,710
almost anybody in the world could
pick one of those things up,

589
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:52,190
look through a little optic and shoot
it and the missile goes after the heat

590
00:34:52,191 --> 00:34:53,840
signature. And they were,
they were everywhere.

591
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:58,250
I went to Stinger missile school.
Yeah. And yeah, it's, it's not,

592
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,080
it's not a hard weapon to know to work.

593
00:35:00,770 --> 00:35:03,920
I mean the school is like a week long.

594
00:35:03,921 --> 00:35:07,760
I mean it's not a long school and you go
to that school and then you can pick up

595
00:35:07,761 --> 00:35:10,160
one of those things and like
you just said, I mean if,

596
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,650
if I pulled out the manual
right now, I could PR,

597
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,380
I could shoot down an
aircraft pretty easily.

598
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:20,000
And if you had spent the last 10 years
fighting against the Russians and yet you

599
00:35:20,001 --> 00:35:21,740
could definitely shoot
out an American airplane.

600
00:35:21,741 --> 00:35:24,320
And that's what we're dealing with is
guys that had actually a lot of experience

601
00:35:24,321 --> 00:35:28,340
with it and that stuff
was everywhere. Um, yeah,

602
00:35:28,370 --> 00:35:31,250
never over find the target to
your, a directly over overhead,

603
00:35:31,251 --> 00:35:33,680
the target at very low altitudes because
you needed to be a little while to,

604
00:35:33,681 --> 00:35:37,890
to provide the support at huge risk. Um,
look and there's certainly a balance.

605
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,050
Technology has allowed us to do a
whole bunch of things and that's,

606
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:44,910
that's good stuff. But Hey, we'll
never have this happen to us again.

607
00:35:44,911 --> 00:35:48,060
Meaning are human beings are never going
to be put in those situations again,

608
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:51,780
it's, and I love how this manual is,
that's what it's telling the marines, hey,

609
00:35:51,781 --> 00:35:55,250
read this book. Oh by the way, this
is what's happened and it's going,

610
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:56,640
we know what's going to happen again.

611
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:59,730
I don't know when or where it's going
to happen again. For sure. And you know,

612
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,370
you were pointing out that,
and this is, this is actually,

613
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:03,240
I'm gonna point this out later.

614
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:06,030
I think I'm going to point this out
later as a short fall to this book.

615
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:10,590
But what you're pointing out right now
is is you know it's not about do this or

616
00:36:10,591 --> 00:36:13,620
do that because think about it. What have
they told you? What have they taught?

617
00:36:13,650 --> 00:36:16,380
What tactics have they
talked about? So far? Zero.

618
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,060
They've talked about zero tactics.

619
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:20,970
What they've told you is
get ready for mayhem. Yeah.

620
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:24,930
Learn the fundamental tactics and
then get ready for total mayhem.

621
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,020
That's what they've told you so far.
Be Creative. That's what they've,

622
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,920
they've used the word creativity
like over and over again. Yeah.

623
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:34,050
That's what they're trying
to get into your heads.

624
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:38,130
They haven't even told
you any tactics yet. So,

625
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:42,750
and I think part of that reason is because
there is a fundamental baseline that

626
00:36:42,751 --> 00:36:47,460
all marines have that they assume and
so they don't really talk about it in

627
00:36:47,461 --> 00:36:48,180
here.

628
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:52,140
And maybe that's the reason why I pictured
it as a little bit of a shortfall of

629
00:36:52,470 --> 00:36:53,600
hey, this is tactical. What you'd like.

630
00:36:53,610 --> 00:36:55,770
If you've read the book
the last hundred yards,

631
00:36:55,771 --> 00:36:59,400
which gets very in the weeds on tactics,

632
00:36:59,430 --> 00:37:02,670
like the actual
maneuvering small elements.

633
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,310
And this doesn't really have it.

634
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,750
And I think the reason it doesn't
really have it is because of the assumed

635
00:37:09,751 --> 00:37:13,590
knowledge of every marine. Yeah, for sure.

636
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:16,590
And I think to put some
context around this,

637
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,210
the Marine Corps knows and expects the,

638
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:23,480
the actual tactics are going to be
taught at school. At school. Yeah.

639
00:37:23,481 --> 00:37:27,630
And then what the Marine Corps I think
is really trying to get the youngest

640
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,900
junior marines, whether it's a junior
marine leader, an officer, a lieutenant,

641
00:37:30,901 --> 00:37:34,950
or or or young private,
is what tactics means.

642
00:37:34,951 --> 00:37:37,110
Not the application of the tactic itself,

643
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,380
but what does it mean to be
part of the tactic for winning?

644
00:37:40,770 --> 00:37:44,670
And it's everything from understanding
the nomenclature of your weapon to the

645
00:37:44,671 --> 00:37:45,930
brutal nature of war.

646
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,650
And they know that what's required is
actually going to learn the tactics that

647
00:37:49,651 --> 00:37:53,400
you will apply as an artilleryman or
infantry man or a supply officer or a

648
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:57,690
logistician. But tactics make no mistake,

649
00:37:57,750 --> 00:38:02,310
that is the brutal application of
war. You know what this reminds me of?

650
00:38:02,430 --> 00:38:05,430
So when we're, we're, we're working with,

651
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:08,070
when we are working with a
company at echelon front,

652
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:13,820
it seems like oftentimes what
people learn about business,

653
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:19,580
like let's say they get their
MBA from somewhere or they are,

654
00:38:19,650 --> 00:38:22,440
even if they've gone through some kind
of a program, whatever kind of program,

655
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:26,310
what they learn is actually the
maneuvering on the battlefield.

656
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:30,810
Like they learn how to, they
learn that technical part of it.

657
00:38:31,170 --> 00:38:34,620
And the part that they don't
often know is all this, oh,

658
00:38:34,621 --> 00:38:36,730
there's going to be complete
and total mayhem. Yeah.

659
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,970
Like things that you had no
idea what w oh by the way,

660
00:38:41,070 --> 00:38:44,320
old leadership, what you need to do is
surround yourself with some good people.

661
00:38:44,321 --> 00:38:45,340
Okay. And by the way,

662
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,370
half those good people are going to be
crazy and the other half are going to be

663
00:38:48,371 --> 00:38:51,220
insane. Yeah. Right. Like every,

664
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,500
every like that's what's missing.

665
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:58,530
So what they focus on here is kind
of what we focus on at echelon front,

666
00:38:58,571 --> 00:39:00,190
working with companies. Oh.

667
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,300
Like there's going to be things
that aren't going the way you,

668
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:08,080
the way they were gonna be going on
paper when you made that hire or when you

669
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:11,970
opened that branch or whatever
you did. It's interesting. No,

670
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:17,170
I think it's exactly the same for
sure. Check. Going back to the book,

671
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:22,780
military forces are complex systems
consisting of individuals and equipment.

672
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,370
They interact internally and externally
in seemingly chaotic ways as clouds that

673
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:29,260
we, it's wrote,

674
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:34,260
a battalion is made up of individuals
the least important of whom may chance to

675
00:39:34,391 --> 00:39:36,970
delay things or make them go wrong.

676
00:39:38,950 --> 00:39:43,950
That's what I was just saying like that
that sentence is the least important

677
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:49,780
person. Yes. Can literally
destroy your plan. Yes. Yeah.

678
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:53,360
As Marines, we believe in,

679
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:57,160
we believe the actions of
single individuals can have
great impact in combat and

680
00:39:57,161 --> 00:40:00,070
can also make things
go right. For example,

681
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:05,050
Sergeant John Basilone as a machine
gunner at Guadalcanal contributed,

682
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:10,530
and this is a quote in large measure to
the virtual annihilation of a Japanese

683
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,040
regiment.

684
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:13,400
Yeah.

685
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:17,530
He steadfastly manned his position in
the face of repeated wave type of salts

686
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:21,700
and was instrumental in breaking the
enemy's ability to press the attack,

687
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:24,550
forcing them to retreat
without achieving their goals.

688
00:40:26,610 --> 00:40:28,140
Medal of honor for that situation.

689
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:33,150
Navy cross later where when he was
killed at [inaudible] but virtual

690
00:40:33,151 --> 00:40:36,510
annihilation of a Japanese regiment

691
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:42,420
Bazi yeah. The legend

692
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,190
battle is also influenced by a
variety of external conditions.

693
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:51,620
Okay.

694
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:54,620
Directions and missions established
by authorities, terrain,

695
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:58,700
whether attitudes of the civilian
populace that often cannot be foreseen.

696
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:04,100
The outcome of combat can only be
anticipated in terms of probabilities.

697
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:10,260
All those things, authorities to reign.

698
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:15,340
Whether attitudes of this really
terrain you're looking at,

699
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,590
you're looking at a map,

700
00:41:17,190 --> 00:41:21,990
a one to 50,000 map or even a one
to 24 map, which is twice as good.

701
00:41:23,070 --> 00:41:27,030
Sometimes that terrain doesn't even
reflect anything that you've seen that you

702
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:31,550
thought it was going to look like.
Yeah. The people that, that part of the,

703
00:41:31,551 --> 00:41:34,220
the people, I mean, that's
the, to think about that.

704
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:38,930
I'd like you to consider the attitudes
of the people in the application of this

705
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:43,160
plan and like the amount of chaos is
embedded just in that comment. Yeah. Uh,

706
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:45,470
it's, it's, it's
staggering. And then again,

707
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,850
relinquish control of your people and
have them go deal with that as it happens

708
00:41:49,851 --> 00:41:53,600
in real time. Yeah. We were
going to send you into a city

709
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,910
that's,

710
00:41:55,910 --> 00:42:00,290
that's been under a regime that's
now got an insurgence in there.

711
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:03,020
There's people getting killed.
They're trying to survive.

712
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:06,610
They're from a totally different culture.
Consider that and just, you know,

713
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:10,150
plan around Matt. You just had that as
one of the factors and the weather too.

714
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:14,480
So yeah. And that happens in
the business world too. Totally.

715
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:19,600
You get things completely wrong. Get
things completely wrong. Oh, this will,

716
00:42:19,820 --> 00:42:22,850
I'm sure everyone's going to love
this new product we're making. No,

717
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,860
no one likes it. Doesn't sell anything.

718
00:42:26,090 --> 00:42:31,090
Or I was working with a company and
they made something and they anticipated

719
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:38,081
selling between two and four per shop,

720
00:42:38,091 --> 00:42:41,870
that they were going into
a massive spread of shops,

721
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:44,060
a very large chain of shops.

722
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:48,920
And they made this something they were
anticipating selling between two and four

723
00:42:49,070 --> 00:42:49,720
per shop.

724
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:54,380
They ended up selling on
average 34 per shop per day.

725
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,240
Yeah. It like crazy. Yeah.

726
00:42:57,590 --> 00:43:02,590
Who predicted that no one then they're
spending $20 million on a new factory

727
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:07,460
immediately check

728
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,290
back to the book. Technology also
affects the tactical environment,

729
00:43:12,291 --> 00:43:14,240
but not always. As anticipated,

730
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:19,160
technology may reduce uncertainty
and it may also increase it.

731
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,690
The Spartans organized into Phalanxes
attacked and close formation,

732
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:27,200
making it easy to see
and control one's forces.

733
00:43:27,201 --> 00:43:31,910
Today tactical formations are less well
defined as distances between elements of

734
00:43:31,911 --> 00:43:36,911
increased complicating command
and control in increased weapons.

735
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:41,540
Lethality communications range and tackle
mobility causes us to disperse forces

736
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:42,890
over greater distances,

737
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:48,290
wars more fluid as a result of technology
while the machine gun bogged down

738
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:52,130
warfare and world war one.
Tactical innovations like the tank,

739
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,050
the airplane and the aircraft carrier
made warfare more rapid and free flowing

740
00:43:57,051 --> 00:43:59,960
in World War II. So that's,

741
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:02,210
that's what you just talked
about with technology.

742
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:06,590
The the GPS guided bomb. Yeah.

743
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:11,680
And as a pilot I was on pretty much on
the leading edge of tactical evolution

744
00:44:12,770 --> 00:44:15,470
in, in, in aviation. And it was,
it was awesome. There were some,

745
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,570
what did you guys start
flying? Night Vision Goggles.

746
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,700
So I have a very similar story to you.

747
00:44:19,701 --> 00:44:24,701
I had my first night vision goggle flight
in the summer of 1998 and they were

748
00:44:25,761 --> 00:44:29,630
pretty new at the time. And
I so get this, I go on my,

749
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:32,070
we do like a simulator
dual brief. I learned how

750
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:33,900
it works in a, in like a
dark room and everything,

751
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:37,020
but you can't replicate it till you get
in an airplane and the first airplane

752
00:44:37,021 --> 00:44:39,060
you have an instructor in the
back. We get in the airplane,

753
00:44:39,061 --> 00:44:41,580
go do the whole thing. We
get airborne, we're out here.

754
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:42,750
Southern California I've taught,

755
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,930
took off out of at an El Toro before
it closed just over the water.

756
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:51,420
And I'm looking up and I'm looking to all
the airplanes at lax lined up hundreds

757
00:44:51,420 --> 00:44:51,630
of miles away.

758
00:44:51,630 --> 00:44:55,560
And I can see this with my night vision
goggles and I ask the instructor, Hey,

759
00:44:55,561 --> 00:44:57,000
is this, is this pretty
common? He's like, well,

760
00:44:57,001 --> 00:45:01,380
I can't actually see what you're
looking at. S said, how come he says,

761
00:45:01,381 --> 00:45:04,890
I'm not wearing my goggles? And
this was a kind of a really old,

762
00:45:04,891 --> 00:45:08,330
really kind of senior crusty guy if I
think it was originally an ace six pow,

763
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,200
the transition. He goes, I don't like him.

764
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:13,370
And I remember I was a really
young student at times.

765
00:45:13,390 --> 00:45:17,070
I certainly wasn't going to have, I'm
just, you know, Roger that and go to that.

766
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,770
It didn't really occur to me until
years later talking, you know,

767
00:45:19,771 --> 00:45:23,490
conversation we had about when the seals
were trying to introduce goggles and

768
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,610
guys like, hey, we don't need
that kind of stuff. Yeah.

769
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:29,460
And just thinking how
being in it. And I'm like,

770
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:33,420
that is the most insane thing
I've ever heard. But, but,

771
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,030
but just something to think
about. I have been on flights.

772
00:45:36,990 --> 00:45:37,920
It happened actually twice,

773
00:45:37,921 --> 00:45:42,150
once in a combat mission in Afghanistan
where my wingman took off and he didn't

774
00:45:42,151 --> 00:45:43,170
have his bracket.

775
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,750
He forgot his bracket that attached to
the helmet where you put the goggles on.

776
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:46,880
So he reached down, uh,

777
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:50,070
to get the night vision goggles to mount
him on his helmet airborne. He's like,

778
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:54,240
dude, I don't have my bracket weight,
which means there's no goggles period.

779
00:45:54,270 --> 00:45:55,650
So we're going to go
do seven hours without,

780
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:59,460
without him having night vision goggles.
And he was kind of paralyzed by that.

781
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,380
Oh yeah, I'll just like Frankie. Yeah.

782
00:46:02,230 --> 00:46:06,030
So he had put himself in this technology
and then the moment that technology

783
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:09,030
technological thing he'd been asked
to cooked custom to was gone. He,

784
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,540
he didn't know what to do and
was like, hey man, we're good.

785
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,350
We'll put in a couple of risk mitigators.
We'll just some out to Delta and will.

786
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:16,320
A couple of very easy things we could do,

787
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:20,730
but it was hard for him and that
the technology ended up itself,

788
00:46:20,731 --> 00:46:24,200
doesn't solve your problems unless you
can a know how to use it and react to

789
00:46:24,201 --> 00:46:27,040
when it's not giving you
what you want. And um,

790
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:29,280
I've seen that in airplanes all the time,

791
00:46:29,281 --> 00:46:33,330
that all of a sudden gps gps goes down
in an airplane and what you want to do is

792
00:46:33,331 --> 00:46:36,780
say, hey, let's just go home.
Like, we can't go home, we're,

793
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,220
we're here to support it.

794
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,660
And I've seen guys get paralyzed by losing
that technological thing that they've

795
00:46:42,661 --> 00:46:43,351
become accustomed to.

796
00:46:43,351 --> 00:46:46,650
And that's kind of the beauty of
what this is saying here is hey,

797
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,440
there's a basic thing that's going to
go on here that you have to be able to

798
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:50,303
execute.

799
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:54,300
They can't replicate the invasion of
Tarla being pinned down and watching a

800
00:46:54,301 --> 00:46:55,290
regiment get decimated.

801
00:46:55,291 --> 00:46:58,200
You can't replicate that in combat
and you can't replicate telling a guy,

802
00:46:58,350 --> 00:47:02,760
get up in a hail of gunfire and
lead your men, but you can actually,

803
00:47:02,790 --> 00:47:05,640
you can actually get people to recognize
that that's what you need to do in

804
00:47:05,641 --> 00:47:09,490
those situations. And that's why those
marines actually got up and did that. Um,

805
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:11,160
there's, the contrast is incredible.

806
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,800
The dichotomy of that is
incredible to think about.

807
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:18,090
They're the technology
thing. The GPS, you know,

808
00:47:18,091 --> 00:47:21,750
like there wasn't gps when
I first got in. There was,

809
00:47:21,751 --> 00:47:26,751
but it wasn't a feasible thing to use
because it was slow and it just didn't

810
00:47:26,851 --> 00:47:30,130
work. And I remember getting
told, Hey, we, with this piece

811
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:34,120
of equipment, we, we can know exactly
where we are and it weighed 28 pounds.

812
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,460
And I said, hey, I know exactly where I
am and I have a map and compass. Yeah,

813
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:41,090
so next question, let's move on. And, and,

814
00:47:41,091 --> 00:47:45,220
and there's definitely are guys
that have become reliant on gps.

815
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,870
They do not know how to do land Nav.

816
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:50,230
Atlanta Nav is an absolutely critical
skill. If you know land have,

817
00:47:50,231 --> 00:47:52,360
you don't need to look at your gps.
And in fact if you know it well,

818
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:54,180
you don't even need to
look at your map, right?

819
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,720
You remember the terrain features,

820
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:58,330
you're keeping track of your pace
and you know exactly where you are.

821
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:04,290
I didn't use a gps or a map in Ramadi
after the second week inside the city,

822
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:07,780
except on very rare occasions.
But every spirit Jolie,

823
00:48:08,170 --> 00:48:12,520
I knew where I was because, well we did
it all the time. But that was actually,

824
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:16,770
if I had to say, hang on one second,
let me Orient Myself to this city.

825
00:48:17,050 --> 00:48:20,140
It's over. She's like, let me break
out my gps and see where we are.

826
00:48:20,141 --> 00:48:24,790
So those fundamental skills are actually
required to be able to take advantage

827
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:28,750
of the technology. When I looked
back at my first deployment to Iraq,

828
00:48:29,410 --> 00:48:31,150
once we were in Ramadi for like a month,

829
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,970
I realized because my first appointment
we'd be going all over the place.

830
00:48:33,971 --> 00:48:36,560
You know, we did a lot of work in
Baghdad, but Baghdad is huge. Right?

831
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:39,670
And we wouldn't do the same
neighborhood even, you know,

832
00:48:39,671 --> 00:48:43,090
maybe we do the same neighborhood one or
two times, but most of the time I was,

833
00:48:43,091 --> 00:48:44,350
hey, we just never been here before.

834
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:49,650
And I realized how much better
I should have known the,

835
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,600
the terrain. Like I would be looking
at the battle map going into,

836
00:48:54,760 --> 00:48:57,370
on my first deployment, we'd be going
into some random town and I'd be like,

837
00:48:57,371 --> 00:49:00,340
okay, here's a major landmark.
There's a mosque over here, there's a,

838
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:03,460
there's a a bridge over here.
Cool. I got that. Oh yeah,

839
00:49:03,461 --> 00:49:04,900
this building looks pretty particular.

840
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:07,720
Our target building is right
next to that building. So, okay.

841
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,330
So I'd kind of have that
level of familiarization,

842
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,400
but I wouldn't know it
like what we knew when,

843
00:49:14,401 --> 00:49:18,190
when in Ramadi where you're looking at
the same thing all the time and that's

844
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:19,130
how you should know the train.

845
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:22,030
That's how you should study the trade and
then when something doesn't fit in the

846
00:49:22,031 --> 00:49:26,230
way it is, the way you, the way it's
supposed to, then you will recognize it.

847
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:28,600
Like if you're looking at
a in a rural environment,

848
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,000
because rural environments
I think are tougher to read,

849
00:49:31,310 --> 00:49:33,520
I guess clearly they are tougher
to read than city environments.

850
00:49:33,550 --> 00:49:35,350
Although you can get turned
around in the city as well,

851
00:49:35,980 --> 00:49:38,450
but you know a stream or
a, you know, you, you, you,

852
00:49:38,451 --> 00:49:40,930
you hit a little stream that wasn't on
the map and you think you were at the big

853
00:49:40,931 --> 00:49:43,540
one and blah, blah blah blah.
You can just get brushed up.

854
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:47,740
But if you are tracking it, then you can,

855
00:49:47,741 --> 00:49:50,200
you can make sense of it
if you've studied it more.

856
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:55,390
So be careful of completely
relying on technology.

857
00:49:55,810 --> 00:49:58,390
It can is not always your
friend back to the book.

858
00:49:58,391 --> 00:50:01,690
Future battles likely to
become even more chaotic? Well,

859
00:50:01,691 --> 00:50:03,790
they'll combat in operation.

860
00:50:03,791 --> 00:50:08,791
Desert Storm was between fairly well
defined forces in well-defined space.

861
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,990
The forces and operating areas in Vietnam,

862
00:50:10,991 --> 00:50:14,320
Somalia and Greneda were
far less well defined.

863
00:50:14,590 --> 00:50:18,730
Enemy units were dispersed and often
hidden with within the civilian population

864
00:50:18,731 --> 00:50:21,790
making them hard, hard to
detect and harder to target.

865
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:25,480
They converge at a time and
place of their choosing.

866
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:30,440
Future opponents may choose to fight in
this manner to offset our overwhelming

867
00:50:30,441 --> 00:50:34,180
superiority and firepower.
Little foreshadow,

868
00:50:35,690 --> 00:50:37,460
yes, they may choose to fight that way.

869
00:50:39,230 --> 00:50:40,063
[inaudible]

870
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:45,460
continuing on this chaotic
environment also brings opportunity.

871
00:50:47,050 --> 00:50:48,970
Klaus Ritz wrote about combat.

872
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:54,300
No other human activity is so
continuously bound up with chance.

873
00:50:58,540 --> 00:51:01,780
The challenge is to recognize opportunity
when it occurs in the midst of chaos

874
00:51:01,781 --> 00:51:05,050
and uncertainty and to
seize it to obtain a clear,

875
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:08,890
unambiguous victory when
viewed through time.

876
00:51:08,891 --> 00:51:13,810
Even the most chaotic of systems may
reveal recurring patterns that may look

877
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,940
that may then be exploited.

878
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,410
The experienced tactician will look for
these reoccurring patterns that can be

879
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:24,930
exploited to advantage. I mean,

880
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,560
when is that not true? That
statement and, and that,

881
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:31,920
and that's combat in a
nutshell, but I mean,

882
00:51:31,921 --> 00:51:34,650
I talk about the Ooda loop all
the time in aviation and, and,

883
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:37,080
and in business too,
when you see the people,

884
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:39,660
when you're working with folks and
it's their first time, maybe they,

885
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:43,350
they've gotten, uh, their, their
first team and, uh, you know,

886
00:51:43,351 --> 00:51:45,260
they introduce themselves in
the first couple of weeks and,

887
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,620
and very immediately,

888
00:51:46,621 --> 00:51:48,960
things don't go the way that they want
and they're on their heels and they don't

889
00:51:48,961 --> 00:51:51,510
know how to react. And it's not
because they're a bad leader.

890
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,240
It's not because they don't possess
it's, they'd never seen it before.

891
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:58,260
And if you never seen it before, a lot
of times you don't know what to do.

892
00:51:58,261 --> 00:52:02,730
So you, you freeze or you do or you do
nothing or you make the wrong decision.

893
00:52:02,731 --> 00:52:06,090
But it's really that sense of being
overwhelmed and right next to might be

894
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:08,730
someone that they're doing it for
10, 15 years, I'm okay, hey man,

895
00:52:09,390 --> 00:52:12,880
I've seen this a thousand times and they
react them completely differently. Eh,

896
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:14,670
I've never seen a place
where that isn't true.

897
00:52:15,270 --> 00:52:19,770
I mean that experience of doing things
over and over again to find a pattern go,

898
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:25,040
this is how I think this is going to
work out. That's what lets you go do it.

899
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:28,340
Because you can anticipate what that
outcome is going to be because you've seen

900
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:30,080
it so many times. Yeah, and there's,

901
00:52:33,450 --> 00:52:38,450
there is a way of looking at things and
overlaying your knowledge that allows

902
00:52:41,261 --> 00:52:46,261
you to see things that other people don't
see and it's hard to do and not many

903
00:52:48,341 --> 00:52:51,520
people do it. Not many
people take what their,

904
00:52:51,550 --> 00:52:56,550
the knowledge that they have and overlay
it onto what they're looking at and you

905
00:52:56,711 --> 00:52:57,544
can't,

906
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:02,350
what you can't do is you can't let what
you're overlaying block what's behind

907
00:53:02,351 --> 00:53:03,390
it. You have to overlay it.

908
00:53:03,391 --> 00:53:06,410
It has to be transparent because you
have to be able to see through it.

909
00:53:06,411 --> 00:53:07,990
You have to be able to see the changes,

910
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:13,500
but if you can take your experience and
you can overlay it onto what's happening

911
00:53:14,381 --> 00:53:19,030
onto what's happening, it gives
you this massive advantage.

912
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:21,340
It's a huge advantage.

913
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:26,460
We talk about when flying having a
mental Rolodex of literally a billion

914
00:53:27,031 --> 00:53:27,660
different,

915
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:30,930
almost like screen captures of what
you're seeing out your windscreen in your

916
00:53:30,931 --> 00:53:35,430
world that you're looking at as a pilot
and having however much experience you

917
00:53:35,431 --> 00:53:38,370
have back there in your head
to go. I've seen that before.

918
00:53:38,371 --> 00:53:42,420
I can pull from my memory
or my recollection of things
I've thought about kind

919
00:53:42,421 --> 00:53:45,420
of overlay that just like you said and
look through it almost transparently and

920
00:53:45,421 --> 00:53:46,020
go,

921
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:50,400
these are the same and it
doesn't guarantee that you
know exactly what's gonna

922
00:53:50,401 --> 00:53:54,690
happen next and put it narrows down to
such a small margin of what the likely

923
00:53:54,691 --> 00:53:57,150
outcomes are going to be that your,

924
00:53:57,240 --> 00:53:59,260
that's how you start thinking
ahead of your opponent or,

925
00:53:59,261 --> 00:54:02,410
or the person even next to you is being
able to pull that experience and say

926
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,370
that I've seen this and I think this is
what's going to happen because of all

927
00:54:05,371 --> 00:54:08,520
these other things. But just like you
said too, you don't get to freeze time.

928
00:54:08,550 --> 00:54:09,630
You don't, there's no pause button.

929
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,390
Their airplanes are moving hundreds
of miles an hour and dynamically.

930
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,960
And the guys that do that really
well pull those pictures out and go,

931
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:17,930
I've seen this and they're making
moves. And you looking at how,

932
00:54:17,980 --> 00:54:21,540
how did you know to do that? And
it's exactly what you just described.

933
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:23,410
I was at,

934
00:54:23,690 --> 00:54:27,420
at the training command and I was
running training and we got tasked with

935
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:32,640
training the guys in a new
mission. And so we get,

936
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:37,670
we tasked the guys with this new mission
and they come up with a plan to execute

937
00:54:38,161 --> 00:54:39,690
this new mission. And so when,

938
00:54:39,691 --> 00:54:42,000
whenever we were taking the guys
on a field training exercise,

939
00:54:42,030 --> 00:54:47,030
they would give the brief to their task
unit or their troop or their platoon and

940
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,460
you know, US training cadre
would sit there and we'd look,

941
00:54:50,461 --> 00:54:52,680
take notes and say like, hey
this is a bad part of the plan.

942
00:54:52,681 --> 00:54:55,320
Hey you should've thought about this.
Hey this won't really work. You know,

943
00:54:55,321 --> 00:54:59,250
so we, we'd give them critiques
and then, and you know,

944
00:54:59,251 --> 00:55:02,370
I would go last, you know what I mean?
Cause I was the guy in charge. So they,

945
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:04,080
they let me go last. So
everyone kind of, you know,

946
00:55:04,081 --> 00:55:06,330
there'd be two or three guys that would
kind of pick apart the plan and then I

947
00:55:06,331 --> 00:55:08,940
would go and mentioned maybe, you
know, four or five other things, right?

948
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:14,080
Because my guys would cover most of
them. So these guys get up and they're,

949
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:17,280
they brief this new mission and how
they're gonna execute this new mission.

950
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,220
And they go, okay, you know, we're done.

951
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:23,430
They wrap up their mission and now we
got the leadership in there to debrief

952
00:55:23,431 --> 00:55:25,050
them on their, on their brief.

953
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:28,890
And my guys like didn't have anything.

954
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:34,290
And so they get to me and I was like,
okay, here's what's going on. Boom, boom.

955
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:38,780
And I just rattled off
like 19 things and the,

956
00:55:38,790 --> 00:55:40,320
the senior enlisted guy that was there,

957
00:55:40,350 --> 00:55:43,740
we got done and we walked out
and he was like, when you leave,

958
00:55:43,741 --> 00:55:48,210
no one's going to be able to do this.
And, and I was like, no man, he's just,

959
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,720
but when I think about what just
occurred, what occurred during that time,

960
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:54,030
all I was doing was taking
what I knew already.

961
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:57,000
What would my senior listing I
knew as well. I just overlayed it.

962
00:55:57,210 --> 00:56:00,860
He didn't ovulate it. It didn't look
the same. So he wasn't quite sure.

963
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,570
So I just overlayed what I
knew and said, oh yeah, here's,

964
00:56:03,630 --> 00:56:06,990
here's what doesn't make sense. Cause
guess what? Cover moves still applies.

965
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:10,050
Decentralized command still
applies. We want to keep it simple.

966
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:11,610
That still applies.
Prioritize and execute.

967
00:56:11,611 --> 00:56:14,520
So applies who w that's those things.

968
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,210
The terrain taking advantage of
the train that still applies.

969
00:56:18,330 --> 00:56:21,180
So even though the mission
has a totally different name,

970
00:56:21,570 --> 00:56:23,650
the fundamental principles
don't, don't change.

971
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:27,760
So if you can take an overlay what
you know you're going to do well,

972
00:56:27,761 --> 00:56:32,410
and that's actually, that's actually
what good leaders do. What good leaders,

973
00:56:32,560 --> 00:56:35,290
they take, what they
know about humans. Oh,

974
00:56:35,291 --> 00:56:37,090
I've worked with a guy like that
before. You know what's funny?

975
00:56:37,091 --> 00:56:38,500
We do our role playing people.

976
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:42,760
And one of the characters that we talk
about in our role play at echelon front,

977
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:48,780
one of the characters that we
talk about is a grumpy old Arnold,

978
00:56:49,450 --> 00:56:50,060
right?

979
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:53,620
Grumpy old Arnold who's been doing this
for 25 years and he's really good and

980
00:56:53,621 --> 00:56:58,120
he's really respected and, and
he likes to do things his way

981
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,200
and he doesn't like, you know, he
doesn't like being told what to do.

982
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:05,740
And when we, whenever we bring
up this character that I made up,

983
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:09,360
but of course like I made
it up, but everybody says,
oh well does this based on,

984
00:57:09,361 --> 00:57:12,340
on my computer. Yeah. So
everybody has an Arnold.

985
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:16,110
And then we go to the next role play.
And the next role play is, you know,

986
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,960
this guy who's, you know, young
buck and what's young buck like?

987
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:24,280
Young buck is super fired up and
he's just ready to go get after it.

988
00:57:24,281 --> 00:57:27,220
But he also doesn't like following what
the rules are because the rules are

989
00:57:27,221 --> 00:57:30,010
impeding his progress and
everyone goes, oh yeah,

990
00:57:30,011 --> 00:57:32,710
we got young buck over here where
it would actually say it's so funny.

991
00:57:32,711 --> 00:57:35,210
Like at the muster we'll walk around
with people that go, this is yes,

992
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:38,920
here's our no there we all, you know
it's always funny. It's always good.

993
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:44,140
But what good leaders do is they,
they take now, now when someone says,

994
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:47,440
hey this is Arnold, or hey we
have an Arnold. I don't know,

995
00:57:47,441 --> 00:57:48,640
it's not exactly the same.

996
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:52,840
But you can certainly overlay some of
the knowledge that you have onto that

997
00:57:52,841 --> 00:57:55,750
person. You can't overlay it
completely cause that's a mistake.

998
00:57:55,780 --> 00:57:59,980
As a leader it's a mistake
to treat Arnold. This Arnold
the same as that Arnold.

999
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:03,820
Cause they have the same, some similar
characteristics but they're not the same.

1000
00:58:04,660 --> 00:58:07,420
And what you did with this one won't work.

1001
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,600
May Not necessarily work with that when
you're going to have to modulate it a

1002
00:58:10,601 --> 00:58:14,620
little bit. And so what you do
as a leader, if you can take,

1003
00:58:14,621 --> 00:58:19,210
and you can overlay your knowledge onto
situations that you haven't seen before,

1004
00:58:19,330 --> 00:58:23,050
but you recognize what
similarities there are and how to,

1005
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:27,730
how to handle those scenarios that's
going to make you infinitely better. Nope,

1006
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:31,630
totally. And the thousands of
flights that I had in my career,

1007
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:35,380
no two are exactly the same. I never
had two flights are exactly the same.

1008
00:58:35,590 --> 00:58:38,980
And that's with any insert, any
job, anything we've ever done,

1009
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:42,500
nothing is exactly the same. And I had,

1010
00:58:42,501 --> 00:58:46,360
I've had that same experience of people
saying this is that guy that you're

1011
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:50,620
just, this is our Arnold or this is
our, our young buck. Um, but if you,

1012
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:54,060
if as a leader you start getting
more and more successful,

1013
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:57,730
you kind of racking up wins and you start
to figure that out and you think that,

1014
00:58:57,731 --> 00:59:02,590
you know how everything is going to play
out, that that's a killer too. And um,

1015
00:59:03,380 --> 00:59:06,850
we, we had, in aviation we
have, we track mishap rates,

1016
00:59:07,300 --> 00:59:11,200
which obviously has expensive airplanes
and airplanes crashes, catastrophic.

1017
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:15,310
And there's two spikes in a
person's career. The mishap rates.

1018
00:59:15,311 --> 00:59:17,710
And one is about the
200 to 300 hour range,

1019
00:59:17,740 --> 00:59:19,900
which is we're literally just
learning how to fly an airplane.

1020
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,370
So it stands a reason a lot of people
crash airplanes when they're first

1021
00:59:22,371 --> 00:59:24,920
learning how to fly. And
then after about 500 hours,

1022
00:59:24,921 --> 00:59:29,060
that mishap rate falls really
low and then does it very,

1023
00:59:29,061 --> 00:59:31,310
very low mishap rate. And then,

1024
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:34,910
and then it spikes again and it
spikes at about the 2000 hour mark.

1025
00:59:35,000 --> 00:59:38,210
And that's a really experienced
squad commander kind of level,

1026
00:59:38,211 --> 00:59:40,870
really experienced. And it's because
they fall into that trap as they,

1027
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:45,770
I've seen it all. And the reality is
that some of those things never change.

1028
00:59:45,771 --> 00:59:48,050
Actually the principles,
they never change.

1029
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:50,450
But the outcomes are always
moving around. And that book,

1030
00:59:50,451 --> 00:59:53,420
the tiered is different than buck over
there. And when you get complacent,

1031
00:59:53,421 --> 00:59:56,450
think I've got this figured out.
It's same thing happens in aviation.

1032
00:59:56,480 --> 00:59:57,740
That's where the mishaps go up again.

1033
00:59:57,830 --> 01:00:01,460
And it's the same thing for a leader is
recognizing that all of these problems

1034
01:00:01,461 --> 01:00:03,110
are different. All of these
problems are the same.

1035
01:00:03,111 --> 01:00:08,040
But you do not know the outcome.
You do not know the outcome, Eh,

1036
01:00:08,490 --> 01:00:12,530
that's, that's that. That
is like a fire in my brain.

1037
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:17,360
Every problem that I look at,
I'm simultaneously looking at it.

1038
01:00:17,930 --> 01:00:20,150
At the same time I'm saying, okay,
I think I've seen this before.

1039
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:23,180
I also have a louder voice in my head
that's saying you don't actually know.

1040
01:00:23,630 --> 01:00:26,520
You don't actually know anything. You
should actually just be quiet yet.

1041
01:00:26,530 --> 01:00:28,820
Listen and try and figure this
thing out because you don't know.

1042
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:34,040
So that's definitely right and you can
see when people get to that 2000 hour

1043
01:00:34,041 --> 01:00:34,790
mark,

1044
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:39,320
they start to think they've got it all
figured out and that's not going to be

1045
01:00:39,321 --> 01:00:41,750
good. Overlay your knowledge.

1046
01:00:43,550 --> 01:00:47,420
Next section is called how we
view combat and how we fight.

1047
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:48,820
Oh,

1048
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:49,750
how we view combat,

1049
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:53,770
how we view the combat environment in
large part determines how we operate in

1050
01:00:53,771 --> 01:00:56,830
it. There are two
competing views of combat.

1051
01:00:58,330 --> 01:01:03,330
Some see it in simple terms as if the
battle and the environment represented a

1052
01:01:03,551 --> 01:01:05,470
closed mechanical system.

1053
01:01:05,710 --> 01:01:09,880
This deterministic view argues
that combat is predictable.

1054
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:15,300
Among the advocates of this view are
military theorists who seek prescriptive

1055
01:01:15,911 --> 01:01:20,911
rules for battle and analyst who predict
battle outcomes based upon force ratio.

1056
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:29,790
The other view is that combat is
chaotic and uncertain in this problem.

1057
01:01:30,850 --> 01:01:35,440
In this probabilistic view battle is
seen as complex a complex phenomenon in

1058
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:39,520
which participants interact with one
another and respond and adapt to their

1059
01:01:39,521 --> 01:01:44,020
environment. The probabilistic viewpoint
sees combat, it's unpredictable.

1060
01:01:44,110 --> 01:01:47,650
The distinctions between these
two views of combat are important.

1061
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:51,550
They drive the choices
commanders make in combat.

1062
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,473
Okay,

1063
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:58,920
so this is again, I was with a client,

1064
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:04,600
a new client the other day echelon front
and meeting the CEO for the first time

1065
01:02:05,970 --> 01:02:09,360
and it was interesting.
He was asking me in a very

1066
01:02:09,630 --> 01:02:10,463
okay

1067
01:02:10,910 --> 01:02:14,850
positive way and not a negative way.
He was asking me in a very curious way.

1068
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:20,040
Basically the question was like,
like what do you teach? What

1069
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:22,580
are you, what are you teaching that that,

1070
01:02:22,581 --> 01:02:27,270
that other people don't teach? What is it?

1071
01:02:27,510 --> 01:02:28,710
How, how, you know,

1072
01:02:29,160 --> 01:02:32,460
there's this high demand signal at my
company for you to be here and I get it

1073
01:02:32,461 --> 01:02:34,680
and that's why you're here
and I appreciate it, but well,

1074
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:38,510
what are you talking about? Like what can
I expect to see and you don't. I said,

1075
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:42,870
and I ended up going and doing the
kind of the introduction to the laws of

1076
01:02:42,871 --> 01:02:46,260
combat and extreme ownership.
So he, that's when he kind of,

1077
01:02:46,410 --> 01:02:47,730
when I got done with that, he said, oh,

1078
01:02:48,840 --> 01:02:51,690
I think this is what people,

1079
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:54,030
from a leadership perspective,

1080
01:02:54,330 --> 01:02:58,920
if you have a deterministic
viewpoint of leadership,

1081
01:02:58,921 --> 01:03:03,620
hey, when the person does this, Oh,
here's the prescription for that. Yeah,

1082
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:09,120
it doesn't work. It doesn't work. And yet
that's an easier thing to sell, right?

1083
01:03:09,180 --> 01:03:13,160
If I'm trying to sell you my leadership
instruction, the easiest thing, reason,

1084
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:14,640
well, what problems do you have? Okay,

1085
01:03:14,641 --> 01:03:18,420
well I'll just tell you
what the prescription for
that type of problem is the

1086
01:03:18,421 --> 01:03:20,870
problem. The problem of that
is it's a lie. It doesn't true.

1087
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:23,910
It doesn't work at all.

1088
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:28,230
We've been working with companies for
the last couple of years and one of the

1089
01:03:28,231 --> 01:03:31,470
things that a lot of companies are
dealing with is growth. Economy is good.

1090
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,340
Everybody's dealing with growth and and I,

1091
01:03:34,350 --> 01:03:36,990
you can see the difference in the leaders
that have these two different points

1092
01:03:36,991 --> 01:03:40,140
of view and the ones that think they have,
they kind of have it all figured out.

1093
01:03:40,141 --> 01:03:41,280
This prescriptive mindset,

1094
01:03:42,450 --> 01:03:46,350
there's nothing in them that feels like
they need to push and relinquish control

1095
01:03:46,351 --> 01:03:49,260
down in the organization because they
think they have the template and they

1096
01:03:49,261 --> 01:03:53,030
might've small started small and they
believe that they can control everything.

1097
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:56,440
It's a very, it's centralized. It's
just, it's at their core. They, they've,

1098
01:03:56,610 --> 01:04:00,600
they are the leader and they did control
things when there was 27 people and

1099
01:04:00,601 --> 01:04:03,450
they saw them every day and they can try,
hey, everything worked awesome. Yeah,

1100
01:04:03,451 --> 01:04:06,150
it's really, you can do that with a
small group, especially at the beginning.

1101
01:04:06,170 --> 01:04:10,340
It's actually not that hard to kind
of control 1520 people and as the,

1102
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:11,460
as it grows,

1103
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,060
it's those leaders that
think that everything is
predetermined by this matrix,

1104
01:04:15,061 --> 01:04:17,580
this if this then that,
that that whole approach,

1105
01:04:18,030 --> 01:04:21,540
they're the ones that are struggling the
most and ironically you don't see it in

1106
01:04:21,541 --> 01:04:24,960
the beginning but the
ones that are willing to
decentralize everything and give

1107
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:28,710
those the ones that actually don't have
nearly as much problem with the growth,

1108
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:30,450
not because they know
it's all figured out.

1109
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:34,740
It's because they know that there's no
way I can figure this out and I can't

1110
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:38,520
solve any of these problems by myself
and the best thing they can do is get

1111
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:41,400
their folks that when you have a
problem and here are some guidelines,

1112
01:04:41,401 --> 01:04:42,234
here's some things we do,

1113
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:44,490
here are some foundational things
that we do at this company,

1114
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:47,370
but I actually don't have the
answer for you. As a matter of fact,

1115
01:04:47,940 --> 01:04:51,180
I am not as good as you are at knowing
this particular situation because you're

1116
01:04:51,181 --> 01:04:53,220
living in it and every day I'm
off over here to do other things.

1117
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:58,410
The leaders that recognize that everything
is chaotic. Nothing is predetermined,

1118
01:04:58,411 --> 01:05:00,120
no matter how good or
experienced they are.

1119
01:05:00,300 --> 01:05:03,660
They're the ones that are
the most successful and the
ones that think it's all

1120
01:05:03,661 --> 01:05:04,380
figured out,

1121
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:07,080
they try to control everything and
they're the ones that are most likely to

1122
01:05:07,081 --> 01:05:10,290
fail. And from the outside, when
you walk in, you look and go,

1123
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:13,710
oh, all you have to do is let them,

1124
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:17,440
let this person make that decision
on their own and it's going work out.

1125
01:05:17,470 --> 01:05:18,070
And if it doesn't, he'll

1126
01:05:18,070 --> 01:05:20,490
learn from it and we'll
figure out the next time. A,

1127
01:05:20,690 --> 01:05:22,960
it's easy to see from the outside.
You see these two different leaders.

1128
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:24,530
It's not just competence, it's everywhere.

1129
01:05:24,710 --> 01:05:28,150
When you sit and approach absolutely
everywhere, it's absolutely everywhere.

1130
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:33,580
Prescriptive leadership, I'm putting
that one in my, uh, in my notebook.

1131
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:39,310
We're not selling prescriptions.
[inaudible] health leadership, health

1132
01:05:41,230 --> 01:05:41,891
continue on.

1133
01:05:41,891 --> 01:05:45,370
The deterministic view of combat often
leads to centralized control. Hmm.

1134
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:49,220
It can be a recipe for micromanagement.
Stifling the initiative.

1135
01:05:49,221 --> 01:05:52,900
Subordinates need to deal with
combat, inevitable uncertainties,

1136
01:05:53,560 --> 01:05:57,430
overly prescriptive orders and plans
inhibit a unit's ability to cope with

1137
01:05:57,431 --> 01:05:58,420
uncertainty and change.

1138
01:05:58,421 --> 01:06:03,421
Eventually the unit inflexible and unable
to adapt may be overwhelmed by events

1139
01:06:03,700 --> 01:06:08,530
and I'll change that. Maybe overwhelmed
to will. How's that for deterministic?

1140
01:06:08,890 --> 01:06:11,320
If you have that, if you
have that micromanagement,

1141
01:06:11,500 --> 01:06:15,220
you will end up in a bad situation.

1142
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,200
The probabilistic view

1143
01:06:19,030 --> 01:06:23,620
of combat recognizes that the complexity
and uncertainty of war leads to a more

1144
01:06:23,621 --> 01:06:25,210
decentralized approach to control.

1145
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:28,540
We placed greater trust in subordinates
to achieve the desired result.

1146
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:30,970
Through the use of mission
orders and commanders intent,

1147
01:06:30,971 --> 01:06:35,200
subordinates are able to handle unforeseen
situations and exploit opportunities

1148
01:06:35,201 --> 01:06:36,034
that arise.

1149
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:40,510
Marine Corps tactics are based on
the probabilistic view of combat.

1150
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,440
Must be shocking for some people
to hear that. Yeah, I bet too.

1151
01:06:44,441 --> 01:06:47,170
They have a totally different viewpoint
that that did. They just think, oh,

1152
01:06:47,171 --> 01:06:49,820
the what you're doing. You're in
charge that day. Boston. Yeah.

1153
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:50,980
Come in and tell everyone what to do.

1154
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:57,310
We must be able to cope with uncertainty
and operate in an everchanging combat

1155
01:06:57,311 --> 01:07:01,750
environment. We must be flexible and
responsive to changes in the situation.

1156
01:07:01,780 --> 01:07:06,780
There are no fixed rules that can be
applied automatically and every situation

1157
01:07:07,721 --> 01:07:10,030
is different. That's so legit.

1158
01:07:10,031 --> 01:07:13,480
Picture that scene you described of being
in Tarla and all those years and look

1159
01:07:13,481 --> 01:07:16,450
around, your squad leaders gone,
your fire team isn't there anymore.

1160
01:07:16,451 --> 01:07:17,800
Your battalion commanders gone.

1161
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,130
None of the things that you
anticipated or prepared or trained for,

1162
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:22,900
they don't even exist anymore.
They're not even there.

1163
01:07:23,500 --> 01:07:26,740
What are you going to do now when
in this predetermined preordained,

1164
01:07:26,741 --> 01:07:30,370
coordinated plan? It
doesn't work. Yeah. Yeah.

1165
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:33,400
That is the, the, the,

1166
01:07:33,401 --> 01:07:37,450
the things that you
expected are literally gone.

1167
01:07:39,370 --> 01:07:44,020
Your plan is, is completely evaporated.

1168
01:07:44,021 --> 01:07:45,340
It is nothing. Yeah.

1169
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:50,080
The plan that you had is
completely and utterly gone.

1170
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:55,270
And if you don't do anything
about that, you will be too. Yeah.

1171
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,153
Very soon.

1172
01:07:58,870 --> 01:08:00,850
There are no fixed rules

1173
01:08:04,490 --> 01:08:08,420
as one tactics manual, put it
more than a half century ago.

1174
01:08:08,421 --> 01:08:12,530
The leader who frantically strives to
remember what someone else did in some

1175
01:08:12,531 --> 01:08:17,531
slightly similar situation has already
his feet on a well traveled road to ruin.

1176
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:19,880
Yeah.

1177
01:08:19,880 --> 01:08:22,430
And that's actually from the book
and for in battle. So this is,

1178
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:24,440
so this is where you have to,

1179
01:08:25,490 --> 01:08:30,170
this is why that overlay that you put,
it's the camp block, what you see.

1180
01:08:30,350 --> 01:08:32,720
It's an overlay. And for
those of you who don't know,

1181
01:08:32,721 --> 01:08:35,180
speaking of speaking of
just going old school, yeah.

1182
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:40,240
In the old days when we used to have
maps and not these incredibly advanced

1183
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:44,630
software programs that put overlay,
they're still called overlays,

1184
01:08:44,900 --> 01:08:47,000
but you'd put a transparent,

1185
01:08:47,450 --> 01:08:49,180
what was that piece of plastic
vein or something like that,

1186
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:53,180
like of transparency and you would draw
little things on it and you'd say, okay,

1187
01:08:53,181 --> 01:08:55,490
this is, here's the terrain, here's
where the target's going to be,

1188
01:08:55,580 --> 01:08:57,260
and you could put another
overlay that showed the enemy,

1189
01:08:57,290 --> 01:08:58,380
suspected any musicians,

1190
01:08:58,470 --> 01:09:00,470
and he put another overlay that
showed your friendly positions.

1191
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:04,490
So that's what I'm talking about. You
can see through it if you block it out.

1192
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:07,070
That's not gonna work.

1193
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:12,380
Leaders must remember that there are no
fixed rules and no precise checklists,

1194
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,070
but there are bounds here.
We get in the dichotomy.

1195
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:19,490
That is why successful leaders study,

1196
01:09:19,550 --> 01:09:23,090
train and exercise their minds
to improve tactical proficiency.

1197
01:09:23,960 --> 01:09:28,820
We study examples of successes and
failures not to emulate someone else's

1198
01:09:28,821 --> 01:09:32,540
scheme, but to increase our own
tactical understanding and competence.

1199
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:36,320
Why do we do that? Why
do we, why do we study?

1200
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:37,670
Yeah.

1201
01:09:37,670 --> 01:09:39,050
Train and exercise.

1202
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:42,230
It's so that we can put those
overlays in our mind and then we can,

1203
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:45,500
we can increase our own tackle.
Understanding and competence.

1204
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:47,223
Okay.

1205
01:09:48,630 --> 01:09:50,520
Next section. Marine Corps tactics.

1206
01:09:50,820 --> 01:09:54,660
The successful execution of Marine
Corps tactics hinges on the thoughtful

1207
01:09:54,661 --> 01:09:58,710
application of a number of tactical
concepts so as to achieve success on the

1208
01:09:58,711 --> 01:10:03,420
battlefield. Key among these
concepts are achieving a decision,

1209
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:08,460
gaining advantage, being
faster, adapting, cooperating,

1210
01:10:08,550 --> 01:10:10,320
and exploiting success.

1211
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:15,210
Each of these concepts is discussed
in detail later in this publication.

1212
01:10:15,450 --> 01:10:19,860
Creative and practical employment of
these ideas throughout the planning and

1213
01:10:19,861 --> 01:10:23,970
execution of tactics leads to
success. Creative is number one.

1214
01:10:23,971 --> 01:10:26,700
That's going first.
Yeah. That's going first.

1215
01:10:26,820 --> 01:10:29,880
Creative and practical employment of
these ideas throughout the planning and

1216
01:10:29,881 --> 01:10:31,950
execution of these
tactics leads to success.

1217
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:36,900
These concepts are not standalone ideas
but are to be combined so as to achieve

1218
01:10:36,901 --> 01:10:38,340
an effect that is greater
than their separate.

1219
01:10:38,341 --> 01:10:43,341
Some part of the art and science of
tactics lies in knowing where and when to

1220
01:10:43,501 --> 01:10:48,300
apply these concepts and which
combinations to use to achieve the desired

1221
01:10:48,301 --> 01:10:50,520
effect. How often does somebody
asks you what, what, what,

1222
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:55,320
what law of combat do you think is most
important for us from right for us?

1223
01:10:55,770 --> 01:10:57,840
And it's like, well, this one's
really important, but guess what?

1224
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:02,760
You can't get one without the other.
Right? They're all woven together.

1225
01:11:05,180 --> 01:11:07,220
The number one definition
of these concepts,

1226
01:11:07,310 --> 01:11:10,970
the number and definition of these combat
concepts are not fixed and their order

1227
01:11:10,971 --> 01:11:13,440
of presentation does not
indicate their value.

1228
01:11:13,590 --> 01:11:17,910
Marines may find in their studies new
or slightly different ideas that may be

1229
01:11:17,911 --> 01:11:18,960
just as important.

1230
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:23,550
These ideas are presented
in this publication so that
readers will think about

1231
01:11:23,551 --> 01:11:25,080
how to achieve success on the battlefield.

1232
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:26,693
Okay.

1233
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:29,780
I wonder if the marines at
the basic school when you
went through were afraid to

1234
01:11:29,781 --> 01:11:32,720
use the word creative. I guarantee
you I guarantee kissed the,

1235
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:35,330
because the word I'm
telling you, they use they,

1236
01:11:35,630 --> 01:11:38,270
they said think for sure and
that's what they meant to be.

1237
01:11:38,271 --> 01:11:40,910
They meant to be creative and yeah,
we'll find the word is the word,

1238
01:11:40,911 --> 01:11:45,440
but that's exactly what they're getting
at is the answer isn't in this book.

1239
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:50,450
The answer isn't that we're going to go
do one week of combat and the defense

1240
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,580
and all of a sudden you've
got all the life experience.

1241
01:11:52,581 --> 01:11:55,280
You need to be defensive
and you have to think

1242
01:11:57,170 --> 01:12:01,670
these concepts help to provide a framework
for developing a tactical mindset

1243
01:12:01,850 --> 01:12:06,530
that has long been the hallmark of marine
leaders from corporal through general.

1244
01:12:07,860 --> 01:12:08,000
Okay,

1245
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:09,710
and here's the conclusion to tactics.

1246
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:13,490
Tactical excellence is the
hallmark of a Marine Corps leader.

1247
01:12:13,700 --> 01:12:17,960
We fight in winning combat through our
mastery of both the art and science of

1248
01:12:17,961 --> 01:12:21,380
tactics. The Art of tactics
involves the creative.

1249
01:12:22,750 --> 01:12:23,080
Okay.

1250
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:27,910
Once again, and innovative, once again,
use of maneuver warfare concepts.

1251
01:12:27,911 --> 01:12:31,600
While the science of tactics requires
skill and basic war fighting techniques

1252
01:12:31,601 --> 01:12:35,530
and procedures. For sure. Yeah, because
let's face it, if you don't have the,

1253
01:12:35,740 --> 01:12:39,790
if you don't know the techniques,
you can't apply them creatively.

1254
01:12:39,910 --> 01:12:41,110
You don't even know one. That's right.

1255
01:12:42,460 --> 01:12:46,870
It is our responsibility as marine leaders
to work continuously to develop our

1256
01:12:46,871 --> 01:12:49,600
own tactical proficiency
and that of our marines.

1257
01:12:50,200 --> 01:12:53,650
Understanding the concepts presented in
this publication provides a foundation

1258
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:54,850
for that development.

1259
01:12:56,640 --> 01:12:57,473
Boom.

1260
01:12:59,370 --> 01:13:02,250
Chapter two. That was one
chapter two by the way,

1261
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:06,540
that's one chapter g awesome and
we're staring at it over an hour.

1262
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:10,410
That's awesome. Some chapter
two achieving a decision.

1263
01:13:12,090 --> 01:13:15,150
It follows then that the leader
who would, and this is a quote,

1264
01:13:15,690 --> 01:13:19,800
it follows then that the leader who
would become a competent tactician must

1265
01:13:19,801 --> 01:13:24,801
first close his mind to the alluring
formula that well meaning people offer in

1266
01:13:26,011 --> 01:13:27,270
the name of victory.

1267
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:28,410
Okay.

1268
01:13:28,410 --> 01:13:33,030
To master his difficult art, he must
learn to cut to the heart of a situation,

1269
01:13:33,240 --> 01:13:38,160
recognize its decisive elements
and basis course of action on these

1270
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:42,130
and that once again, that's
from this book, infantry battle,

1271
01:13:42,131 --> 01:13:45,820
which infantry battle is an awesome
book and what's really interesting about

1272
01:13:45,821 --> 01:13:48,250
infantry and battle, and I'm going to
cover it on the podcast probably in,

1273
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:50,020
I don't know, I've got it in the queue,

1274
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:55,800
but what's interesting about infantry
and battle the book is it was written in

1275
01:13:56,021 --> 01:14:01,021
1939 or it came out in
1939 so it's not based on,

1276
01:14:02,860 --> 01:14:05,410
it's not based on what we
learned in World War II.

1277
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:07,990
It's what we did in World War II.

1278
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:11,050
It's based on world war one
and like these things worked.

1279
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:13,840
These things didn't work and they don't,
they don't. They don't say it that way,

1280
01:14:13,841 --> 01:14:18,670
but that's basically what it is.
It's a great book and there's some,

1281
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:22,720
and this is when you see a,
when you see a leader do this,

1282
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:25,000
caught to the heart of a situation,

1283
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:28,240
recognize its decisive elements and
basis course of action on these.

1284
01:14:28,450 --> 01:14:30,880
That's like the most
pleasurable thing to see as a,

1285
01:14:31,330 --> 01:14:35,170
as an observer or as a trooper.
When you see someone go, hey,

1286
01:14:35,171 --> 01:14:37,060
here's what's going on. This
is what we're going to do.

1287
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:39,760
A lot of people will be talking and all
of a sudden the leader will go, hey,

1288
01:14:40,450 --> 01:14:43,710
this is what's happening. This is what
we're going to do. And you go, oh,

1289
01:14:43,930 --> 01:14:45,190
thank God for this guy

1290
01:14:47,930 --> 01:14:49,700
going on another quote.

1291
01:14:50,580 --> 01:14:51,210
Okay.

1292
01:14:51,210 --> 01:14:53,520
We must be ruthlessly opportunistic,

1293
01:14:53,850 --> 01:14:58,350
actively seeking out signs of weakness
against which we will direct all

1294
01:14:58,351 --> 01:15:02,130
available combat power when the decisive
opportunity arrived and we must exploit

1295
01:15:02,131 --> 01:15:05,790
it fully and aggressively committing
every ounce of combat power we can muster

1296
01:15:05,791 --> 01:15:08,100
and pushing ourselves to
the limits of exhaustion,

1297
01:15:10,510 --> 01:15:14,200
which is the way you should actually
live your life as well. No big deal.

1298
01:15:14,340 --> 01:15:17,800
That's from, that's from FM FM one.

1299
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:19,593
Yeah.

1300
01:15:19,940 --> 01:15:23,210
Warfighting which I don't know when
I covered that on this podcast,

1301
01:15:23,211 --> 01:15:27,560
but it was like podcast five
or something like that. So yes,

1302
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,960
ruthlessly opportunistic.

1303
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:31,170
Okay.

1304
01:15:31,170 --> 01:15:33,720
Fully and aggressively.
That's what I'm talking about.

1305
01:15:33,930 --> 01:15:38,490
And also recognizing that the number
of times you're going to get that

1306
01:15:38,520 --> 01:15:43,260
opportunity to exploit something to
win it might be once in a battle.

1307
01:15:43,470 --> 01:15:46,950
Yeah. It might be once and that
window may last four minutes.

1308
01:15:46,951 --> 01:15:50,400
It may last an hour, it may last
a day, but it might be gone. Yeah.

1309
01:15:50,670 --> 01:15:51,660
And when you see it,

1310
01:15:52,350 --> 01:15:56,160
you're gonna have to step and you're
gonna have to make that decision and

1311
01:15:56,161 --> 01:15:57,570
there's going to be risk in that decision.

1312
01:15:57,810 --> 01:16:00,870
And you're not guaranteed and
outcome in any way, shape or form.

1313
01:16:01,380 --> 01:16:04,320
But here's the counterpoint.
If you don't maneuver well,

1314
01:16:04,830 --> 01:16:08,640
that opportunity can be lost.
Yeah. And there, this is a,

1315
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,880
there's a huge discussion about the
dichotomy. I don't use the word dichotomy,

1316
01:16:11,910 --> 01:16:14,550
but they, they definitely
talk about it all the time.

1317
01:16:14,910 --> 01:16:17,430
Just because we're saying you've gotta
be opportunities to can take advantage of

1318
01:16:17,431 --> 01:16:17,730
those things.

1319
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:20,430
That doesn't mean that you just run to
your death doesn't mean to charge into

1320
01:16:20,431 --> 01:16:24,330
every bunker that you see because you
think it's the decisive bunker. No,

1321
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:28,890
we talk about this all the time.
He, you even think, you know, the,

1322
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:30,510
the dichotomy that comes to mind here,

1323
01:16:30,650 --> 01:16:32,710
the idea of being brave
and not foolhardy. Yeah.

1324
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:37,290
And then you even talked about it in Q
and a recently about recognizing that

1325
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:41,130
being default aggressive. Obviously
that's a really good thing, but,

1326
01:16:41,190 --> 01:16:44,400
but you can't be like that all the time
because if you're over aggressive and

1327
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:47,790
you've explained the wrong opportunity
or you or you're actually so aggressive

1328
01:16:47,791 --> 01:16:50,850
that you haven't had a chance to bring
all your forces to bear when it actually

1329
01:16:50,851 --> 01:16:51,960
is most effective.

1330
01:16:51,990 --> 01:16:56,990
That's everybody as destructive as
being so disconnected or being so

1331
01:16:58,340 --> 01:17:00,570
unaggressive that you missed those
opportunities as well and the answer,

1332
01:17:00,571 --> 01:17:01,760
like you said, it always it's,

1333
01:17:01,780 --> 01:17:04,200
it's in that middle and
just saying be aggressive.

1334
01:17:04,410 --> 01:17:08,040
That doesn't solve your problems. You
actually have to know when to do that.

1335
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:12,290
I remember that the podcast I was talking
about when I started thinking about

1336
01:17:12,291 --> 01:17:14,810
the dichotomy of leadership,
this was a big deal because,

1337
01:17:15,650 --> 01:17:19,730
because what I had to do
to to come up with that,

1338
01:17:19,731 --> 01:17:21,740
to allow my brain to get around that,

1339
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:24,170
I had to say that I was
rubbing into your wrong, yeah,

1340
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,390
that I was wrong like this.
This isn't right all the time.

1341
01:17:26,810 --> 01:17:29,930
It's not always good to be aggressive.
It's not always good to go forward.

1342
01:17:30,020 --> 01:17:31,520
It's like all those things.

1343
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:36,410
It's not always good to step up and lead
all the time. No, actually it's not.

1344
01:17:36,680 --> 01:17:39,680
There's some times when you should
follow like for me to sit there and I

1345
01:17:39,681 --> 01:17:42,560
remember it was one of those situations,
this is what we just talked about.

1346
01:17:42,950 --> 01:17:47,950
There was some time when I was watching
something unfold and the the thought

1347
01:17:49,371 --> 01:17:52,820
was, well they should have been
more aggressive. And I was like,

1348
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:57,890
that's what I want to say. Cause
that's what big tough Jocko says.

1349
01:17:58,430 --> 01:18:01,550
But guess what? That's not the right
answer. The right answer is actually,

1350
01:18:01,551 --> 01:18:03,140
that would have been the
wrong time to be aggressive.

1351
01:18:03,141 --> 01:18:06,320
And they actually did a good job by
sitting back and letting that situation

1352
01:18:06,321 --> 01:18:10,700
develop. So what is this? And I
was thinking about this in my head,

1353
01:18:10,750 --> 01:18:14,090
you know what is going on here? Oh,
because you can't be too aggressive.

1354
01:18:14,360 --> 01:18:17,090
You can't be aggressive all
the time. Oh and by the way,

1355
01:18:17,480 --> 01:18:20,710
there's every trait that you look
at. Yeah, there's a counter to it.

1356
01:18:20,750 --> 01:18:22,970
If you go too far with any of
them, you're wrong for sure.

1357
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:28,220
And that's why the things that we teach,
we don't teach the answers of saying,

1358
01:18:28,250 --> 01:18:32,960
oh, your answers be default aggressive,
that that by itself doesn't work.

1359
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:36,470
So you actually have to
understand not just what it means,

1360
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:42,230
but when to do that and know that there
is actually an un limit to doing that,

1361
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:46,130
that it will become ineffective
if you're just, I'm aggressive.

1362
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:50,570
That's how I lead get on board.
And that you lead your team to, to,

1363
01:18:50,580 --> 01:18:55,570
to destruction because you're thinking,
I got to be aggressive. And like,

1364
01:18:55,820 --> 01:18:59,150
yes you do. But you have to actually
have to know when to be aggressive.

1365
01:18:59,151 --> 01:19:02,450
And actually sometimes the best thing
is to be the exact opposite of that and

1366
01:19:02,451 --> 01:19:05,690
let the situation unfold until
you see that opportunity. Yeah,

1367
01:19:05,710 --> 01:19:09,500
and I mean did it's flanking, right?

1368
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:13,550
Flanking is an aggressive movement,

1369
01:19:13,610 --> 01:19:16,670
but it's not as aggressive as charging
up the middle. Right? Right, right.

1370
01:19:16,671 --> 01:19:18,820
The frontal assault, frontal
assault is more aggressive. It,

1371
01:19:18,950 --> 01:19:22,850
I'll give you credit, but it's not
going to work out better. That's right.

1372
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:27,440
And then the other funny thing
from a leadership perspective is,

1373
01:19:28,160 --> 01:19:31,370
Hey, am I,

1374
01:19:32,840 --> 01:19:37,220
am I being weak? Am I
being fearful if I don't,

1375
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:38,180
if I'm not aggressive.

1376
01:19:39,050 --> 01:19:42,680
But here's the answer and this is a
real simple way to look at it. When you,

1377
01:19:42,681 --> 01:19:44,180
when you deal with another human being,

1378
01:19:44,870 --> 01:19:47,930
are you building the relationship
or are you breaking it? Are you,

1379
01:19:47,931 --> 01:19:49,820
are you moving it forward or
you're moving it back? Yeah,

1380
01:19:50,000 --> 01:19:54,440
that's the question and, and
the answer is the answer.

1381
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:55,400
The answer is if you're,

1382
01:19:55,401 --> 01:19:58,220
if what if I'm going to
have a conversation with you
and it's going to move our

1383
01:19:58,221 --> 01:20:01,130
relationship forward? Cool.
That's probably the right answer.

1384
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:03,380
If I'm going to have a conversation
with you and it's going to move our

1385
01:20:03,381 --> 01:20:05,870
relationship backwards, that's
probably not the right answer.

1386
01:20:06,900 --> 01:20:08,020
So we for for sure, eve,

1387
01:20:08,410 --> 01:20:13,410
if you d came up with a bad plan
and my approach with you on that is,

1388
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:18,960
hey Dave, your plan sucked and I
don't think you're cut out for this.

1389
01:20:19,360 --> 01:20:20,193
Yeah.

1390
01:20:20,430 --> 01:20:25,410
Or Hey, your plan socks in. I don't, I'm
going to, you have to use my plan now.

1391
01:20:25,740 --> 01:20:29,010
Which both of those have a
negative outcome? Both of those.

1392
01:20:29,011 --> 01:20:31,650
You're looking at me going, okay,
so Jocko doesn't trust me. He did.

1393
01:20:31,740 --> 01:20:36,180
He doesn't think my plan is any
good. Instead of me going, hey man,

1394
01:20:36,270 --> 01:20:37,380
can you explain to me,

1395
01:20:37,381 --> 01:20:41,820
I want to understand like how you're
going to execute this thing because it's

1396
01:20:41,821 --> 01:20:44,880
important for me to understand what
you're thinking so I can give you the

1397
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:48,660
support that you need. W W can you,
can you kind of walk me through your,

1398
01:20:48,750 --> 01:20:51,900
your thought process and how this
is going to go down? Well, that,

1399
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,400
what does that do with our relationship?

1400
01:20:53,610 --> 01:20:55,110
Now you're going to
explain something to me.

1401
01:20:55,380 --> 01:21:00,380
I'm going to subtly and smoothly point
out the little mistakes in the plan that

1402
01:21:00,751 --> 01:21:03,990
you had and I'm going to actually
let you come to the conclusion.

1403
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:07,290
You're the one that's going to be
telling me that you know what has thought

1404
01:21:07,291 --> 01:21:10,560
about, I'm actually gonna change this
a little bit. And then I go, oh wow.

1405
01:21:10,680 --> 01:21:13,260
I would have never caught that. And Boom,

1406
01:21:13,440 --> 01:21:17,550
all of a sudden our relationship
got stronger. So yes,

1407
01:21:19,420 --> 01:21:22,580
there's a dichotomy. There
is, and there's actually,

1408
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:27,470
there actually is a time sometimes
that the frontal assault does work.

1409
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,410
That's why there's a frontal assault.
Absolutely. If it never worked,

1410
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:32,060
it wouldn't be a thing. Absolutely.

1411
01:21:32,390 --> 01:21:36,260
But the time and the place
to do that, first of all,

1412
01:21:36,290 --> 01:21:38,060
it's a lot less common than people think.

1413
01:21:38,061 --> 01:21:40,760
The frontal assault should be
the exception by a huge margin.

1414
01:21:40,790 --> 01:21:42,800
But there are times that
the frontal assault works.

1415
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:45,500
And sometimes when the frontal
assault with another person,

1416
01:21:46,130 --> 01:21:50,390
the Times that it is most effective is
when you've spelled spent a lifetime and

1417
01:21:50,570 --> 01:21:54,350
built a lifetime of a relationship
that you can go, Dave, this is stupid.

1418
01:21:54,380 --> 01:21:57,350
We're not doing it. And I go, okay, Yup.

1419
01:21:57,380 --> 01:22:02,060
And I trust you and I don't get defensive
and I don't shrink back down because

1420
01:22:02,300 --> 01:22:03,133
I'm cashing in.

1421
01:22:03,260 --> 01:22:06,560
Are you cashing in on a lifetime of
not having done it over and over again?

1422
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:08,660
I'm going to just roll over when
you say that. And I'm going,

1423
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:09,770
it's gonna make it worse for me.

1424
01:22:09,771 --> 01:22:13,310
But there are times that actually the
frontal assault does work for sure.

1425
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:17,390
And it only works when you've
not done it a thousand times.

1426
01:22:17,570 --> 01:22:18,403
After the one time it happens,

1427
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:21,920
the guy is willing to listen to what's
being said. Yeah. And, and there's,

1428
01:22:22,340 --> 01:22:26,330
there's other times where the funnel salt
is good and the frontal assault can be

1429
01:22:26,331 --> 01:22:30,640
good because you're setting up other
avenues of approach that you're not gonna

1430
01:22:30,650 --> 01:22:33,380
actually follow it. Yeah,
yeah, sure. There's, I've,

1431
01:22:33,381 --> 01:22:37,640
I've used that approach sometime where
I've gone ballistic about something that

1432
01:22:37,641 --> 01:22:38,421
wasn't a big deal,

1433
01:22:38,421 --> 01:22:41,270
but what I was really doing was
prepping the battlefield for something,

1434
01:22:41,271 --> 01:22:43,910
something else. So yeah, there's
maneuvers that have to happen for sure.

1435
01:22:46,100 --> 01:22:49,970
Moving back to the book, tactics is
the employment of units and combat.

1436
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:51,490
Okay.

1437
01:22:51,490 --> 01:22:54,730
The objective of tactics is to achieve
military success through a decision in

1438
01:22:54,731 --> 01:22:59,650
battle using tactical actions to do
to achieve what decision is central to

1439
01:22:59,740 --> 01:23:02,620
marine corps tactics. In the past,

1440
01:23:02,621 --> 01:23:07,621
military forces have also have often
only incremental gains when they thought,

1441
01:23:09,550 --> 01:23:10,540
when they saw it victory.

1442
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:15,810
Taking a hill here or a town there pushing
the front forward a few kilometers or

1443
01:23:16,121 --> 01:23:17,200
adding to the body count,

1444
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:22,290
sometimes these incremental gains were
the result of a competent enemy or the

1445
01:23:22,541 --> 01:23:23,740
chaotic nature of war.

1446
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:27,190
Meaning what they're saying there is
like sometimes you're only making these

1447
01:23:27,250 --> 01:23:31,120
incremental gains because the enemy is
super competent or nature's crazy. Okay,

1448
01:23:31,420 --> 01:23:35,050
so we get that. That can happen and
then it continues many times. However,

1449
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:39,360
commander's saw incremental gains
as a means to achieve victory. Yeah.

1450
01:23:41,180 --> 01:23:44,140
Thinking about that, you're looking
at the battlefield and you go,

1451
01:23:44,141 --> 01:23:46,810
you know what? We're
going to get this house.

1452
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:49,440
We're going to get that house right
there and we're going to do what?

1453
01:23:49,450 --> 01:23:49,991
No matter what,

1454
01:23:49,991 --> 01:23:52,300
we're going to get that house and you're
not looking at this whole battlefield,

1455
01:23:52,301 --> 01:23:54,940
this whole city, this whole
region, this whole province.

1456
01:23:56,020 --> 01:24:00,730
So we look at these little tactical
incremental gains as a means to achieve

1457
01:24:00,731 --> 01:24:01,480
victory.

1458
01:24:01,480 --> 01:24:06,480
This incremental is to view sees war as
a slow cumulative process and it is best

1459
01:24:07,630 --> 01:24:11,890
and is best exemplified by the grinding
attrition tactics seen on the western

1460
01:24:11,891 --> 01:24:13,120
front in World War One

1461
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:18,040
there the opponents were more or
less evenly matched in their tactics,

1462
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:22,690
resulted in indecisive action in Vietnam
where the case where the opposing

1463
01:24:22,691 --> 01:24:26,150
forces were quite dissimilar in
their military capabilities. Both.

1464
01:24:26,200 --> 01:24:30,110
The incremental approach led to
the u s is overreliance on fire,

1465
01:24:30,120 --> 01:24:31,300
power and body counts.

1466
01:24:31,510 --> 01:24:35,260
This in turn led to the conduct of
military operations that were often

1467
01:24:35,261 --> 01:24:36,760
irrelevant to the outcome of war.

1468
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:42,090
Even though a comparison of casualty
ratio ratios appeared favorable.

1469
01:24:42,420 --> 01:24:43,253
Think about that.

1470
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:48,300
You're conducting operations that were
irrelevant on the outcome of the war.

1471
01:24:48,390 --> 01:24:53,040
How often do I see that in
leadership, in businesses, in life,

1472
01:24:53,250 --> 01:24:58,250
people are doing thing that are either
relevant to the outcome of the war and

1473
01:24:58,471 --> 01:25:03,471
committing so much time and so many
resources to that and so much individual

1474
01:25:03,961 --> 01:25:05,640
human stress. Yeah,

1475
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:13,590
the body count thing in Vietnam, you
know, the more I learn about that,

1476
01:25:13,890 --> 01:25:15,770
the more the,

1477
01:25:15,870 --> 01:25:20,730
it's such a clear mistake when you
look at it from, from now. Right.

1478
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:22,140
With our hindsight,

1479
01:25:22,890 --> 01:25:27,300
and I was just reading an article the
other day from a Vietnam guy, he's like,

1480
01:25:27,301 --> 01:25:30,530
yeah, and he's like, yeah, I
think we killed too. I would.

1481
01:25:30,690 --> 01:25:35,130
We reported 20 like that was cause
that way, hey, you know, hey everyone,

1482
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:38,910
get the pat on the back. No one else
knows. No one cares. And how many,

1483
01:25:39,090 --> 01:25:42,840
how many platoon commanders did that?
Well, every platoon in the company,

1484
01:25:42,930 --> 01:25:46,140
so it was 60 it was 60 we killed 60

1485
01:25:46,930 --> 01:25:47,440
okay,

1486
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:51,400
and guess what? Even if we did kill 60
guess what? The Vietcong didn't care.

1487
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:54,340
Yeah, they were there
for the long war. Yeah,

1488
01:25:54,341 --> 01:25:57,670
but on some spreadsheet 60
means we're winning. Yup. Yup.

1489
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,250
60 versus we took two
casualties. Cool. We're going to,

1490
01:26:00,251 --> 01:26:04,610
we're going to beat them. We're going to
win. Yup. Back to the book. Therefore,

1491
01:26:04,611 --> 01:26:06,650
the Marine Corps has
embraced a more flexible,

1492
01:26:06,651 --> 01:26:10,070
imaginative and effective way
to wage war maneuver warfare.

1493
01:26:12,740 --> 01:26:16,700
That is the way you should picture every
thing that you do in your life should

1494
01:26:16,701 --> 01:26:17,750
be maneuver warfare.

1495
01:26:18,170 --> 01:26:22,670
Marine success with this approach has
been demonstrated in places like Greneda

1496
01:26:22,671 --> 01:26:23,960
and the Persian Gulf.

1497
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:28,520
In contrast to tactics based on an
incremental attrition tactics and maneuver

1498
01:26:28,521 --> 01:26:32,390
warfare always aim at decisive action.

1499
01:26:35,690 --> 01:26:39,050
That's what you want your, that's
what you want to be looking for.

1500
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:44,750
This is what Echo Charles refers
to as the long war. He says, well,

1501
01:26:44,810 --> 01:26:46,940
I mean he doesn't, he
does refer to that boats,

1502
01:26:47,060 --> 01:26:52,060
but he says that that's the biggest thing
that he's learned and if he wishes he

1503
01:26:52,221 --> 01:26:57,110
knew one thing from sitting in here
for all these hours listening to me,

1504
01:26:57,800 --> 01:27:01,910
he wishes that he knew that he wishes
that he understood the long war at a

1505
01:27:01,911 --> 01:27:06,020
younger age. For sure. I feel, I think
everybody probably feels like that.

1506
01:27:06,021 --> 01:27:11,021
I certainly feel like that and the reason
life mirrors that is because life is

1507
01:27:12,471 --> 01:27:17,180
life. Life has a campaign. Life is
life is as long as it is and you have,

1508
01:27:17,210 --> 01:27:20,510
maybe in life you might have four or
five culminating events in your life.

1509
01:27:20,540 --> 01:27:21,680
You might get, if you get lucky,

1510
01:27:21,681 --> 01:27:24,950
you just get a handful of those and
if you miss those, if you don't,

1511
01:27:25,070 --> 01:27:27,410
if you're not aware that you're
working towards those, you'll do it.

1512
01:27:27,410 --> 01:27:31,380
A lot of people do is look back and
say, boy, I wish I had dot, dot, dot,

1513
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:32,210
whatever that is.

1514
01:27:32,210 --> 01:27:36,230
And that recognition that it's the same
thing as the campaign and you have to

1515
01:27:36,231 --> 01:27:36,591
actually,

1516
01:27:36,591 --> 01:27:39,980
everything you do affects something
else and you need to be working towards

1517
01:27:39,981 --> 01:27:42,590
whatever that culminating event is.
And if you're lucky, you get a few.

1518
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:45,950
And if you miss them, you spend a
lifetime looking back, wishing you hadn't.

1519
01:27:45,980 --> 01:27:50,840
And in combat, if you miss a culminating
event, you can lose, you can lose,

1520
01:27:50,930 --> 01:27:53,210
you can lose your guys, you can lose the
war, you can, you can lose everything.

1521
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:57,710
You and I were with a client
and I actually, I actually like,

1522
01:27:57,711 --> 01:28:02,711
we were with a date with them for a day
and I was like gonna close out the day.

1523
01:28:02,960 --> 01:28:05,300
And I had like some little thing, um,

1524
01:28:05,630 --> 01:28:07,610
that I had talked about
at the end of the day.

1525
01:28:08,600 --> 01:28:10,670
And as soon as I got done,

1526
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:13,820
I realized I wish I would've
said something else.

1527
01:28:14,480 --> 01:28:16,400
And here's what I would've said. Cause we,

1528
01:28:16,401 --> 01:28:21,401
you and I were reading the surveys and
one of the things that we read on the

1529
01:28:23,241 --> 01:28:26,900
survey, someone said,
Hey, uh, this training,

1530
01:28:27,110 --> 01:28:29,990
because you'd worked with this
client before, someone said, hey,

1531
01:28:30,110 --> 01:28:32,240
the training with, you
know, Dave was cool,

1532
01:28:33,050 --> 01:28:37,370
but it was kind of like seeing a rocky
movie and at the end of a rocky movie,

1533
01:28:37,760 --> 01:28:39,210
everybody wants to go home and,

1534
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:43,890
and box and train and work out
and then two days later you're,

1535
01:28:43,891 --> 01:28:48,891
you're not doing any of those things
and I what I should have done and I,

1536
01:28:49,941 --> 01:28:52,520
it hit me as soon as I walked off stage.
It's just one of those bad timings.

1537
01:28:52,790 --> 01:28:55,910
I should have said, hey, I should have
brought up those surveys and said,

1538
01:28:55,911 --> 01:28:57,590
I'm gonna read you what someone said.

1539
01:28:58,220 --> 01:29:02,370
And what someone said is this is like a
rocky movie and everyone wants to train

1540
01:29:02,371 --> 01:29:05,520
boxing and then two days later you're
back to normal and I should just sit the

1541
01:29:05,521 --> 01:29:08,340
person who, whoever wrote that in this
room, and I'm not going to call you out,

1542
01:29:08,460 --> 01:29:11,250
whoever wrote that is 100% right.

1543
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:16,790
You are 100% right because
this is not an inoculation.

1544
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:19,770
You're, we know you're
going to be fired up,

1545
01:29:19,890 --> 01:29:24,630
but you the what it takes
to change leadership inside
of a Co company is not one

1546
01:29:24,631 --> 01:29:28,470
brief or two briefs from
Dave. What it takes,

1547
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,260
it's a campaign that you have
to think about every single day.

1548
01:29:31,410 --> 01:29:33,660
You have to think about the long
war. You're not going to go,

1549
01:29:33,720 --> 01:29:38,130
you can't sit through a three hour
briefing and expect that, oh, now,

1550
01:29:38,131 --> 01:29:40,860
well now our leadership is good
to go. No, it's not like that.

1551
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:44,460
It's a campaign that you have to get
on. You have to think about it everyday.

1552
01:29:44,490 --> 01:29:48,030
You have to train it every day
and actually the same group,

1553
01:29:48,570 --> 01:29:50,580
we had done some physical training
with them in the morning, you know,

1554
01:29:50,581 --> 01:29:53,490
we put them through like a PT
program. I should've said, okay,

1555
01:29:54,090 --> 01:29:58,920
now that we did that PT this morning for
40 minutes who is now in good shape and

1556
01:29:58,921 --> 01:30:02,400
no one want to raise their hand.
And I would've said, that's right.

1557
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:05,070
Just because you sat through
three hours with Dave and I,

1558
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:10,320
does this mean that your, your leadership
is now honed and sharp? No, not true.

1559
01:30:10,440 --> 01:30:12,420
Just like you have to
continue to workout everyday.

1560
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,910
You have to continue to train
and study every single day.

1561
01:30:15,050 --> 01:30:19,710
You've continued to be reflective and
look at yourself and see and look at your

1562
01:30:19,711 --> 01:30:22,470
peers and talk to each other and see
what you can improve and see what you can

1563
01:30:22,471 --> 01:30:25,560
do better. That's what
you need to do. So yes,

1564
01:30:26,280 --> 01:30:30,390
in two days you're going to be back
to normal if you allow yourself to be.

1565
01:30:31,290 --> 01:30:35,370
But if you get in the game and if you see
this as a campaign and if you see this

1566
01:30:35,371 --> 01:30:37,500
as a working out that you
need to do every single day,

1567
01:30:37,501 --> 01:30:40,560
and if you look at yourself
for the mistakes that you're
making as a leader and

1568
01:30:40,561 --> 01:30:44,160
what mistakes your organization
is making as leaders,

1569
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,910
that is when you will become better
at, you can become a champion.

1570
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:51,390
Just like rocky. Unfortunately.

1571
01:30:51,391 --> 01:30:56,100
I thought of it like through
like literally 15 seconds
after I walked off. But,

1572
01:30:56,350 --> 01:31:00,180
um, you know, and what I
told them was similar but

1573
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:06,270
it wasn't the same. It wasn't
the same. So yeah, I remember,

1574
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:07,920
I remember that conversation. And,

1575
01:31:08,290 --> 01:31:11,370
and it also gets to the point to
that no matter where you are in an

1576
01:31:11,371 --> 01:31:15,780
organization, you actually can have
massive influence from that position.

1577
01:31:15,810 --> 01:31:16,980
If you, if you do that,

1578
01:31:17,220 --> 01:31:20,310
you don't have to be the CEO of a company
to steer the company in a particular

1579
01:31:20,311 --> 01:31:23,040
direction. And if you actually
recognize, okay, maybe not today,

1580
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,390
maybe not turn up, but if I get on
this path and I stay on this path,

1581
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,910
I'm going to start to cultivate
a little more influence.

1582
01:31:29,911 --> 01:31:32,490
I'm going to get more success.
I'm going to eventually,

1583
01:31:32,790 --> 01:31:37,170
you can be the driving force behind
the Organization of the team being

1584
01:31:37,171 --> 01:31:41,340
successful. Yes. At
any level, yes you can.

1585
01:31:42,060 --> 01:31:43,110
You have so much more.

1586
01:31:43,111 --> 01:31:46,710
Just like you have so much more
ownership of things like in your world.

1587
01:31:46,910 --> 01:31:47,760
Yet people,

1588
01:31:47,761 --> 01:31:52,590
people don't realize how much control and
power they have over their life. Okay.

1589
01:31:52,770 --> 01:31:55,800
I get it that there's exceptions. I
get it that there's horrible diseases.

1590
01:31:55,950 --> 01:31:58,890
I get it. There's accidents
happen. I get it. I get it. And,

1591
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:04,360
and the sympathy and empathy
that I feel for those situations.

1592
01:32:05,050 --> 01:32:06,130
Absolutely. I get it.

1593
01:32:07,060 --> 01:32:11,800
There's also so much that you
have control over in your life.

1594
01:32:12,130 --> 01:32:15,310
So you have this impact over your life
and it's the same thing in an in an

1595
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:17,800
organization. You Think,
oh, I'm dumb them.

1596
01:32:17,860 --> 01:32:22,750
I'm just a middle manager or I'm
just a front line soldier. Okay,

1597
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:26,740
let's see what happens. Let's see
what happens if you get in the game,

1598
01:32:28,510 --> 01:32:31,660
I'll tell you what happens. Al Gray. Amen.

1599
01:32:31,780 --> 01:32:35,230
He started off as whatever he won
in the United States Marine Corps.

1600
01:32:36,340 --> 01:32:38,680
That's what I'm talking
about. How did he do that?

1601
01:32:38,681 --> 01:32:42,760
By sitting back and complaining and
pointing his finger at other people. No,

1602
01:32:42,940 --> 01:32:47,620
by stepping up and making things
happen. That's how you do it. Hackworth,

1603
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:50,950
young kid, enlisted kid.

1604
01:32:52,980 --> 01:32:53,040
Whoa.

1605
01:32:53,040 --> 01:32:55,950
Well what did he do? Sit back
and complain or sit back and say,

1606
01:32:55,951 --> 01:32:58,980
he didn't have any control. No, he
stepped up. Took ownership of things,

1607
01:32:58,981 --> 01:33:01,050
made things happen. Got
a battlefield commission.

1608
01:33:01,890 --> 01:33:03,420
You can make these things happen,

1609
01:33:03,720 --> 01:33:05,190
whether you get a battlefield
commission or not,

1610
01:33:05,191 --> 01:33:08,040
you can make these things happen. I
just see that all the time when I was,

1611
01:33:08,310 --> 01:33:09,460
when I was on that training, there'd be a,

1612
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,610
if there's a platoon with
like a weak leadership,

1613
01:33:11,670 --> 01:33:14,400
like weak platoon commander or
weak platoon chief and it happens,

1614
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:18,570
but there'd be some pipe
hitting e five in there,

1615
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:24,120
just a hard dog and he would have
good leadership skills and he,

1616
01:33:24,510 --> 01:33:28,200
I, I had one kid, he was such a beast and,

1617
01:33:28,650 --> 01:33:30,390
but he wasn't like letting it out.

1618
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:34,770
They were going through their urban
training and their all pinned down and the

1619
01:33:34,860 --> 01:33:37,500
leaders are making no decisions
and I walk over to this kid,

1620
01:33:37,501 --> 01:33:42,270
he's pinned down by the wall, it's like
a saw and I'm like, I'm like, hey bro.

1621
01:33:42,540 --> 01:33:44,160
And he's like, what's
up sir? And I was like,

1622
01:33:44,190 --> 01:33:46,440
you just going to sit here and let
the all this happen. He's like,

1623
01:33:47,790 --> 01:33:48,623
w

1624
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:51,780
yeah, kind of like, what do you mean?
And I said, make something happen Bro.

1625
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:54,150
You know what to do. And the the,

1626
01:33:54,180 --> 01:33:59,160
the light in his eyes as he just started
to get some and that's all it takes.

1627
01:33:59,250 --> 01:34:02,400
Somebody step up and lead so it
doesn't matter where you are in that

1628
01:34:02,401 --> 01:34:05,940
organization. If you, if
you look at where you're at,

1629
01:34:05,941 --> 01:34:08,730
if you look at where you want to
go longterm, you'll get there.

1630
01:34:08,760 --> 01:34:11,490
You will have it, but then
it's not going to be easy. Man.

1631
01:34:11,491 --> 01:34:14,220
There were things that I fought for in
the seal teams that I took years and

1632
01:34:14,221 --> 01:34:17,400
years and years and some of them
I wasn't successful completely.

1633
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:20,940
I planted seeds that are
still trying to take root,

1634
01:34:21,360 --> 01:34:22,860
but that's what you got to do

1635
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:30,040
back to the book. This
does not mean however,

1636
01:34:30,041 --> 01:34:33,280
that combat should be viewed as
a bloodless ballet of movement.

1637
01:34:33,700 --> 01:34:34,960
I should have read that in of voice.

1638
01:34:35,260 --> 01:34:39,730
This does not mean however that combat
should be viewed as a bloodless ballet of

1639
01:34:39,731 --> 01:34:41,560
movement. Combat,

1640
01:34:41,561 --> 01:34:46,180
especially at the tactical level of war
will be characterized by tough, brutal,

1641
01:34:46,181 --> 01:34:47,740
and desperate engagements.

1642
01:34:47,860 --> 01:34:52,390
We must remember that war is a violent
clash of two opposing wills in which each

1643
01:34:52,391 --> 01:34:54,850
side is trying to rest
advantage from the other.

1644
01:34:55,720 --> 01:34:59,270
Our Future enemies may not
allow us to gain, maintain,

1645
01:34:59,271 --> 01:35:02,690
or employ technological
or numerical superiority.

1646
01:35:02,870 --> 01:35:07,870
The future battle may be bloody and
tough and that makes it vitally important

1647
01:35:08,690 --> 01:35:13,690
that we marine leaders strive
to develop tactical proficiency.

1648
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:15,190
Yeah.

1649
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:17,410
What do we mean by achieving a decision?

1650
01:35:17,590 --> 01:35:22,120
Take a moment to compare these two
historical examples and Anzio a model of

1651
01:35:22,121 --> 01:35:24,070
tactical in decisiveness.

1652
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:27,640
Late 1943 the allies were searching
for a way to alleviate the stalemate.

1653
01:35:28,090 --> 01:35:31,240
Natally the campaign installed
around the Casino Wharf,

1654
01:35:31,300 --> 01:35:35,620
the Casino Front and resembled the trench
war trench warfare of world war one in

1655
01:35:35,621 --> 01:35:39,850
order to keep pressure on the Germans
bypass the stubborn German defenses at

1656
01:35:40,210 --> 01:35:41,043
Cassie. No.

1657
01:35:43,020 --> 01:35:43,240
Okay.

1658
01:35:43,240 --> 01:35:46,150
And capture room. A bold
operation was envisioned.

1659
01:35:46,510 --> 01:35:51,010
The U s armies third division and the
British Army's first division would make

1660
01:35:51,011 --> 01:35:55,270
an amphibious landing at Anzio
about 35 miles south of Rome.

1661
01:35:58,110 --> 01:36:03,030
The allies achieved complete surprise
by landing an Anzio on January 22nd,

1662
01:36:03,030 --> 01:36:05,520
1944 under the command of the
u s armies Major General Lucas,

1663
01:36:05,521 --> 01:36:08,850
the Americans and British
quickly established a
beachhead and rapidly advance

1664
01:36:08,851 --> 01:36:13,640
three miles inland by mid morning
against light German resistance with the

1665
01:36:13,641 --> 01:36:17,370
majority of their forces concentrated
further south around casino.

1666
01:36:18,570 --> 01:36:23,150
The Germans could not possibly reinforce
the NGO beach had until the January

1667
01:36:23,150 --> 01:36:25,320
23rd to 24th if the allies
press their advantage,

1668
01:36:25,321 --> 01:36:28,050
the road to Rome lay virtually undefended.

1669
01:36:28,980 --> 01:36:32,880
The seizure of Rome would have had the
effect of isolating the German defenders

1670
01:36:32,881 --> 01:36:36,480
in the south and firmly establishing
allied control over Italy.

1671
01:36:38,070 --> 01:36:42,360
Pretty straight forward situation yet
general Lucas delayed concerned about

1672
01:36:42,361 --> 01:36:46,590
being overextended and wanting to build
up his logistics as to our Lucas failed

1673
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:50,310
depresses initial advantage of surprise
and allow the Germans to reinforce the

1674
01:36:50,700 --> 01:36:51,180
Anzio area.

1675
01:36:51,180 --> 01:36:56,180
Not until January 29th did Lucas feel
strong enough to make an offensive bid,

1676
01:36:56,911 --> 01:36:58,110
but by that time it was too late.

1677
01:36:58,111 --> 01:37:02,190
The Germans had arrived in force and
had seized the dominating high ground in

1678
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:07,080
the beachhead area. Not only was the
ally defensive and Angio stalled,

1679
01:37:07,081 --> 01:37:09,870
but the Germans had seize the initiative
and quickly threatened to drive the

1680
01:37:09,871 --> 01:37:14,130
Americans and British back
into the sea. As a result,

1681
01:37:14,131 --> 01:37:17,820
the allies did not complete the reduction
of German defenses in southern Italy

1682
01:37:18,000 --> 01:37:20,850
and capture Rome until
several months later.

1683
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:27,150
General Lucas lost a
tremendous opportunity to
exploit an initial success and

1684
01:37:27,151 --> 01:37:29,400
gain a decisive result

1685
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:32,970
pretty straight forward. Yeah,

1686
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:37,163
it's,

1687
01:37:38,550 --> 01:37:40,170
it's easy to sit here
too and be like, cool.

1688
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:43,920
I obviously would've just put
some homework. Right. There's,

1689
01:37:44,100 --> 01:37:47,340
and that's what you got to think about.
You got to think about, okay, what,

1690
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:50,790
what did he see, you know, and
how much intelligence did he have?

1691
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:53,610
He might not have known
all this. That being said,

1692
01:37:54,060 --> 01:37:56,830
this is one of those
situations where you go, look,

1693
01:37:56,860 --> 01:38:01,720
we just made it a shore pretty easily.
We've got, we're doing pretty good.

1694
01:38:02,500 --> 01:38:04,540
The Germans aren't in position yet,

1695
01:38:04,541 --> 01:38:07,450
and you'd figure that out pretty quickly
and let me tell you something else.

1696
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:11,860
Here's, here's what my mentality
would have been. The Germans. Okay.

1697
01:38:11,861 --> 01:38:16,240
Let's say we don't know 100% that the
Germans aren't set up on us, right?

1698
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:19,180
How are we going to find out? You
know how I'm going to find out?

1699
01:38:19,240 --> 01:38:21,730
I'm going to go and not sitting here
and I'm not going to sit here and wait.

1700
01:38:21,730 --> 01:38:23,200
I'm going to find out.
I'm going to push forward.

1701
01:38:23,201 --> 01:38:26,830
I guess what if we push forward and we
meet massive resistance that requires

1702
01:38:26,831 --> 01:38:30,220
this extensive logistic train that
I'm waiting for? Cool. Guess what?

1703
01:38:30,340 --> 01:38:31,510
It looks like we're going to wait for it,

1704
01:38:31,750 --> 01:38:34,990
but if I push start to push through and
all of a sudden I realize that that we

1705
01:38:34,991 --> 01:38:37,120
get through, well, guess what? Cool.

1706
01:38:37,150 --> 01:38:39,550
We're going to move a little bit further
and I'm going to continue to push,

1707
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:40,331
you know, I talk about,

1708
01:38:40,331 --> 01:38:44,710
I've been talking a lot about
this incremental decision
making idea and that's a

1709
01:38:44,711 --> 01:38:47,980
great example, right?
It's not okay. We landed,

1710
01:38:48,010 --> 01:38:51,370
we're going to go straight to
Rome, but guess what? We landed,

1711
01:38:51,490 --> 01:38:53,980
we're three miles in. Guess
what we're going to do tomorrow?

1712
01:38:54,130 --> 01:38:56,830
We're going to go five miles in. Guess
what we're gonna do today? After that,

1713
01:38:56,860 --> 01:38:59,050
we're going go seven miles
in. Oh, and by the way,

1714
01:38:59,110 --> 01:39:00,970
if we start to see like an open road,

1715
01:39:01,000 --> 01:39:03,100
we're gonna go until we
meet some resistance.

1716
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:08,340
So I'm not committing 100% day one because
we don't know what we're up against.

1717
01:39:08,711 --> 01:39:11,620
We don't know. Because if we run out of
ammunition, we're screwed. We get that.

1718
01:39:12,190 --> 01:39:16,510
So I'm gonna make these incremental
decisions that are going to lead me toward

1719
01:39:16,511 --> 01:39:18,250
my final objective. But it's going to,

1720
01:39:18,340 --> 01:39:23,340
it's going to prevent me from getting
stagnant and waiting and not gaining any

1721
01:39:24,131 --> 01:39:26,860
new information. Because
when we're sitting still,

1722
01:39:26,861 --> 01:39:29,350
we're not getting any new
information. In a matter of fact,

1723
01:39:29,500 --> 01:39:31,660
the enemy's maneuvering, I say it all
the time. If you're sitting still,

1724
01:39:31,661 --> 01:39:32,590
the enemy is maneuvering on you.

1725
01:39:32,591 --> 01:39:35,560
Here's a classic example and what do
you think the Nazis are going to do?

1726
01:39:36,040 --> 01:39:39,160
But the Nazi's aren't going to maneuver
on you. These are the blitz Craig.

1727
01:39:39,161 --> 01:39:40,690
People remember them for sure.

1728
01:39:41,070 --> 01:39:44,200
We're not sitting back and waiting for
this to happen. We need to go forward.

1729
01:39:46,450 --> 01:39:49,210
And obviously again, you
know, this is all for us.

1730
01:39:49,211 --> 01:39:51,820
We can sit here and in hindsight and
listen to this and read this and recognize

1731
01:39:51,821 --> 01:39:56,200
that, but that's the first
two pages of this book.

1732
01:39:56,201 --> 01:40:00,280
That's the leader's job is to recognize
that when you have those culminating

1733
01:40:00,281 --> 01:40:01,720
events, when you have the opportunity,

1734
01:40:01,721 --> 01:40:05,260
you have to see it and you bring all
your forces to bear to attack that.

1735
01:40:05,410 --> 01:40:09,040
Now that doesn't mean that
you just get online and push.

1736
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:11,530
In this case you just pushed the
$30 from. That's not what it means,

1737
01:40:11,560 --> 01:40:14,500
but it means that this is our time
to take the things that we have,

1738
01:40:14,501 --> 01:40:16,940
the all the things available
to us to do that. And we,

1739
01:40:17,000 --> 01:40:18,610
we get aggressive when we attack in it.

1740
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:24,120
And what I'm saying is I'm actually
giving away a pragmatic tool that you can

1741
01:40:24,641 --> 01:40:29,620
technically use with, cause I'm not
saying you, we can look back and say,

1742
01:40:29,621 --> 01:40:32,860
Hey, the decision should have been
this or this. What I'm saying,

1743
01:40:32,890 --> 01:40:37,240
here's a pragmatic tool that you can
use as a leader, which is the following.

1744
01:40:37,570 --> 01:40:42,130
You see an opening press press.
You don't need to go crazy. No.

1745
01:40:42,131 --> 01:40:43,570
You press and you evaluate. Yes.

1746
01:40:43,590 --> 01:40:46,990
See what happens in that room and
actually that's a better chance to reveal

1747
01:40:46,991 --> 01:40:49,000
what's actually happening.
Then not pressing,

1748
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:52,330
which is different than everybody get
on and run. That's not what I'm saying,

1749
01:40:52,840 --> 01:40:57,670
but moved to the next one and the best
intelligence you're going to get is that

1750
01:40:57,671 --> 01:41:01,720
the point of friction and if there's
not a lot of friction here, good chemo,

1751
01:41:01,920 --> 01:41:05,010
hey, there's way more friction
than we expected or can deal with.

1752
01:41:05,470 --> 01:41:09,820
Now we know and we can actually
respond to that as well. Check

1753
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:15,640
another example. Kenai,

1754
01:41:16,350 --> 01:41:21,350
the clear tackle decision
achieved on August 2nd two 16 BC,

1755
01:41:22,300 --> 01:41:26,230
the Carthaginian General Hannibal fought
the Roman army under the command of

1756
01:41:27,570 --> 01:41:32,080
Terentino's Gerontius Varo near the
city of Kenai and southern Italy.

1757
01:41:32,170 --> 01:41:33,003
Hannibal based.

1758
01:41:33,040 --> 01:41:37,180
His tactics on the specific
characteristics of both
forces and on the aggressive

1759
01:41:37,181 --> 01:41:39,790
personality of the Roman commander. Oh,

1760
01:41:39,791 --> 01:41:44,330
I highlighted that in
my notes because listen,

1761
01:41:44,450 --> 01:41:49,450
that handle basis tactics on the specific
characteristics of both forces and on

1762
01:41:49,511 --> 01:41:52,480
the aggressive personality
of the Roman commander. Yeah,

1763
01:41:53,170 --> 01:41:57,700
he knows borrows Varo. He knows that
that dude likes to get aggressive. Yeah.

1764
01:41:58,210 --> 01:42:01,570
Cool. I got you pegged.
Here we go. As dawn broke,

1765
01:42:01,571 --> 01:42:05,560
Hannibal drew up his force of
50,000 veterans with his flank,

1766
01:42:05,590 --> 01:42:07,480
with his left link anchored on

1767
01:42:09,490 --> 01:42:14,490
the Aphid Dis River secured from
envelopment by the more numerous Romans.

1768
01:42:14,560 --> 01:42:16,360
So you've got on your left leg,
you're protected, you've got a river,

1769
01:42:16,540 --> 01:42:19,780
they're great. His center line
contains only a thin line of infantry.

1770
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:23,440
His main force was concentrated on the
flanks, is his left and right wings.

1771
01:42:23,441 --> 01:42:26,080
Each contained deep
Phalanxes of heavy infantry.

1772
01:42:26,290 --> 01:42:30,070
8,000 cavalry tied to his left line to
the river are tied his left leg to the

1773
01:42:30,071 --> 01:42:33,250
river, 2000 cavalry protected
his open right flank.

1774
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:38,280
8,000 men guarded his camp in the
rear Varo and more than 80,000 Romans.

1775
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:43,660
So they're out numbered by
Hannibal's out numbered by 30,000

1776
01:42:45,350 --> 01:42:48,790
Varo and more than 80,000 Romans
accepted the challenge seeing the

1777
01:42:48,791 --> 01:42:53,140
well-protected Carthaginian flanks
Varo dismissed any intent to envelop.

1778
01:42:53,650 --> 01:42:56,260
He decided to crush his opponent
by sheer weight of numbers.

1779
01:42:56,261 --> 01:42:59,720
He placed 65,000 men in a
center, 2,400 cavalier owners,

1780
01:42:59,900 --> 01:43:04,660
his 4,800 calvary on his left and sent
11,000 men in to attack the Carthaginian

1781
01:43:04,661 --> 01:43:06,850
camp. Following preliminary skirmishes.

1782
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:12,210
Hannibal moved His light center line
forward to a salient against the Roman

1783
01:43:13,660 --> 01:43:17,910
center. And when they say salient,
that's like a, it's like a PR.

1784
01:43:17,950 --> 01:43:20,500
It's like a projection. It's like a
a group that's gonna move forward.

1785
01:43:20,501 --> 01:43:23,650
It's like a point, almost like a point
element, but it's a big point element.

1786
01:43:24,610 --> 01:43:28,930
Then his heavy calvary on the left

1787
01:43:30,640 --> 01:43:34,570
crushed the opposing Roman cavalry and
swung completely around the Roman to

1788
01:43:34,630 --> 01:43:37,360
Roman rear to attack the Roman
cavalry on the other flank.

1789
01:43:37,361 --> 01:43:39,520
The Roman cavalry fled the field.

1790
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:44,290
The Carthaginian heavy casualty cavalry
then turned back to assault the rear of

1791
01:43:44,291 --> 01:43:46,960
the defense, the rear of
the dense Roman infantry,

1792
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:51,070
who had pressed back handles thin
center line at the same time, Hannibal,

1793
01:43:51,470 --> 01:43:53,660
his right and left wings into
the flanks. The Roman center,

1794
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:55,430
the Romans were boxed in,

1795
01:43:55,640 --> 01:44:00,640
unable to maneuver or use their weapons
effectively between 50,000 and 60,000

1796
01:44:01,941 --> 01:44:05,900
Romans died that day as borrows.

1797
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:08,030
Army was destroyed. So battle,

1798
01:44:08,031 --> 01:44:11,750
the Psalm had 60,000
casualties in one day.

1799
01:44:11,930 --> 01:44:14,450
This is 60,000 dead.

1800
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:20,280
No, your opponent don't be.

1801
01:44:20,281 --> 01:44:23,220
This is don't be over aggressive
to Varo was over aggressive.

1802
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:27,420
Wasik IC your thin line. Watch
this. Yeah, watch this as right.

1803
01:44:28,680 --> 01:44:29,880
Understanding decisiveness.

1804
01:44:29,910 --> 01:44:33,120
What did these examples tell us
about achieving a decision at first?

1805
01:44:33,121 --> 01:44:36,420
Achieving decision is
important and indecisive,

1806
01:44:36,421 --> 01:44:39,540
but battle waste the lives of
those who fight it and die in it.

1807
01:44:40,110 --> 01:44:43,890
It wastes the efforts of those who
survive as well. All the costs, the desks,

1808
01:44:43,891 --> 01:44:46,740
the wounds, the sweat and effort,
the equipment destroyed or used up,

1809
01:44:46,741 --> 01:44:49,410
the supplies expended or
suffered for little gain.

1810
01:44:50,520 --> 01:44:54,750
Such battles have no meaning except for
the comparative losses and perhaps an

1811
01:44:54,751 --> 01:44:56,790
incremental gain for
one side or the other.

1812
01:44:59,340 --> 01:45:04,340
I've been talking about being a black
belt in Jujitsu and how a black belt in

1813
01:45:04,411 --> 01:45:08,220
Jujitsu, when you grabbed something
that doesn't matter, they don't care.

1814
01:45:08,700 --> 01:45:12,390
What they want is the decisive
thing. That's what they want.

1815
01:45:12,391 --> 01:45:15,030
They want the decisive position.
They want the decisive movement,

1816
01:45:15,810 --> 01:45:18,860
and that's the difference. And that's
what they're talking about here. You,

1817
01:45:18,930 --> 01:45:23,880
when you do things that are indecisive,
that they're not, they're not gonna,

1818
01:45:24,150 --> 01:45:26,820
they're not gonna make or break the
battle. That's what's happening.

1819
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:28,410
It's not gonna make or break the battle.

1820
01:45:28,470 --> 01:45:31,460
It's just you're just wasting
wasting energy wasting.

1821
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:34,950
And in war you're wasting
humans and you're wasting
equipment and you're wasting

1822
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:39,240
ammunition and supplies. And for a
leader, think about what that means.

1823
01:45:39,270 --> 01:45:43,470
When you do things that
waste your people's Times,
and certainly in this case,

1824
01:45:43,740 --> 01:45:46,380
waste their lives. Obviously
that's an extreme situation,

1825
01:45:46,381 --> 01:45:50,880
but even just wasting their efforts when
you do things that wasted their effort

1826
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:52,433
over time,

1827
01:45:53,190 --> 01:45:56,820
your credibility as a leader and even
your opportunity to be successful in the

1828
01:45:56,821 --> 01:45:59,460
long run, every single time
you do that, it goes down.

1829
01:45:59,760 --> 01:46:02,730
And that failure to recognize
that this tactical thing,

1830
01:46:03,330 --> 01:46:06,210
we're going to stay late to do this
one thing because this thing needs to

1831
01:46:06,211 --> 01:46:08,550
happen. And there are
times it's actually true,

1832
01:46:08,970 --> 01:46:12,300
but there are times that
if you continually wasted
your people's efforts of

1833
01:46:12,590 --> 01:46:12,591
venture,

1834
01:46:12,591 --> 01:46:16,350
they recognize you actually don't care
about what it is that we're doing.

1835
01:46:16,710 --> 01:46:21,270
And over time your credibility leader
goes away because you don't recognize that

1836
01:46:21,271 --> 01:46:24,390
these tactical things you're trying
to get solved are all leading you down

1837
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:28,430
towards, in this case, the
destruction of an army. Yeah.

1838
01:46:28,650 --> 01:46:30,750
And here's what you just said and
I'm going to add something to you,

1839
01:46:30,751 --> 01:46:35,580
said you don't care about what we're
doing and what's even going to drive these

1840
01:46:35,581 --> 01:46:40,100
people into a worse situation from a
leadership perspective is they're going to

1841
01:46:40,101 --> 01:46:43,230
realize that you don't care about them,

1842
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:46,080
you don't care about them.

1843
01:46:46,230 --> 01:46:50,670
And y'all haven't done a good job
when when general Mooka Yama was milk,

1844
01:46:51,030 --> 01:46:56,030
he put this massive emphasis on caring
about your people and like making sure

1845
01:46:57,901 --> 01:46:58,950
they understand. And if you,

1846
01:46:59,340 --> 01:47:02,340
cause when you ask him why he loved
Hackworth so much, it's like, oh,

1847
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:07,230
because Hackworth care. Care about
me. Yeah. So the most important thing,

1848
01:47:08,190 --> 01:47:10,930
the most important thing is like,
oh yeah, we, we, I get, I'm,

1849
01:47:10,931 --> 01:47:12,810
I'm definitely concerned
about what we're doing.

1850
01:47:12,990 --> 01:47:15,240
The most important thing I
care about is you troops.

1851
01:47:15,241 --> 01:47:16,830
Now we have a mission
to do. And by the way,

1852
01:47:16,890 --> 01:47:18,660
the mission that we're going
to do is going to benefit us,

1853
01:47:18,661 --> 01:47:21,180
all of us in the long run
because when we win this war,

1854
01:47:21,480 --> 01:47:23,550
our kids don't have to go to war
and we're going to have stability.

1855
01:47:23,551 --> 01:47:25,410
We're going to have security.
And that's what our goal is.

1856
01:47:25,411 --> 01:47:27,840
So it benefits us and there's going
to be sacrifice in the short term.

1857
01:47:28,020 --> 01:47:29,700
But that's what we're here to do.

1858
01:47:30,330 --> 01:47:35,070
We're not here to make any sacrifices
that aren't required. Yeah. At all.

1859
01:47:35,580 --> 01:47:39,660
Ever. That's the most important thing.

1860
01:47:39,990 --> 01:47:43,740
I care about you, my
troops. I care about you.

1861
01:47:43,770 --> 01:47:47,820
I want you to win. I want you to survive.

1862
01:47:47,821 --> 01:47:52,020
I want you to be taken care of and we
have a mission to do and we're gonna do

1863
01:47:52,021 --> 01:47:55,920
it. But the men, if they put the
mission, benefits you as well, right?

1864
01:47:55,921 --> 01:48:00,540
It's not just, hey, you're
going to die for me. No,

1865
01:48:00,541 --> 01:48:02,190
that's not what we're
talking about at all.

1866
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:06,540
We're going to put our lives at risk
because we have something we're trying to

1867
01:48:06,541 --> 01:48:09,300
accomplish that is going to benefit each
and every one of our families in our

1868
01:48:09,301 --> 01:48:10,230
lives, in our country.

1869
01:48:10,380 --> 01:48:14,610
That that idea in business
and that idea is so important,

1870
01:48:14,970 --> 01:48:16,140
that belief that

1871
01:48:17,900 --> 01:48:21,060
that you care about your people so much,

1872
01:48:22,020 --> 01:48:25,620
that they recognize the point that they
would be willing to do anything for you.

1873
01:48:26,070 --> 01:48:28,680
And it doesn't mean you don't ask
your people to go do hard things.

1874
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:32,070
It doesn't mean you don't put them in
very difficult situations by which their

1875
01:48:32,071 --> 01:48:33,090
lives might actually be lost.

1876
01:48:33,120 --> 01:48:35,580
That's not what it means to care about
you means I don't put you at risk.

1877
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:39,330
Sometimes I actually do put
you at risk, but if a leader,

1878
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:43,830
and it's not just an,
it's actually believing.

1879
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:48,390
If a leader actually believes that
his people are that important and as a

1880
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:52,500
subordinative I work for someone and
go, holy cow, this guy actually he,

1881
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:54,720
he cares about me that much.

1882
01:48:55,440 --> 01:48:58,590
I would literally be willing
to do anything for that person,

1883
01:48:58,860 --> 01:49:03,210
but it actually comes from
that understanding that
this person I worked for,

1884
01:49:03,510 --> 01:49:07,050
he doesn't just care about the mission
being accomplished for the mission sake

1885
01:49:07,080 --> 01:49:10,470
or even for his own sake,
that he recognizes it
actually in my best interest.

1886
01:49:11,130 --> 01:49:12,180
That's a rare thing.

1887
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:17,720
That's what cultivates young marines or
young people willing to do anything for

1888
01:49:18,211 --> 01:49:21,690
you and leaders get that backwards
all the time. They don't.

1889
01:49:21,750 --> 01:49:22,680
They recognize that.

1890
01:49:22,740 --> 01:49:24,900
They fail to recognize that they're the
thing that will allow them to do the

1891
01:49:24,901 --> 01:49:29,790
hardest things they need to do is by
having those people believe in them that

1892
01:49:29,791 --> 01:49:30,624
much.

1893
01:49:30,750 --> 01:49:35,750
Yet I'm going to put up an actual
quantifiable amount cause you,

1894
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:39,270
you, you, you just said it
twice. You said that much.

1895
01:49:39,540 --> 01:49:41,520
You said the leader cares
about you that much.

1896
01:49:41,521 --> 01:49:44,400
You said it sort of in the beginning of
your statement and you just said it at

1897
01:49:44,401 --> 01:49:45,234
the end.

1898
01:49:45,510 --> 01:49:49,480
I'm going to quantify what much
means cause it's really easy to do.

1899
01:49:50,470 --> 01:49:54,370
The way you quantify how much a leader
has to cook care. How much is it?

1900
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:59,760
It's the leader cares more
about the person than they
do about themselves and if

1901
01:50:00,311 --> 01:50:04,390
that's what the troops see, if that's
what they see, that's when you get,

1902
01:50:04,750 --> 01:50:09,520
as you said, young marines, young or
employees or soldiers, sailors, airmen,

1903
01:50:09,521 --> 01:50:13,450
marines, up linemen,
uh, construction guys,

1904
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:16,450
manufacturing people, whoever it is.

1905
01:50:16,930 --> 01:50:20,470
When they see that they
will know and that,

1906
01:50:20,770 --> 01:50:22,630
that then they will go that
extra distance for you.

1907
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:24,580
Hey is it every single
one of those guys? No,

1908
01:50:24,610 --> 01:50:27,610
because you've got people that are self
centered and now we're gonna look at you

1909
01:50:27,611 --> 01:50:30,100
and go, cool, I'm going to take
advantage of this guy. That happens.

1910
01:50:30,250 --> 01:50:33,580
It does happen. Got Up. You gotta be
where you got to not even be wary of it.

1911
01:50:33,581 --> 01:50:37,920
You just need to understand it for sure,
but that's what you need to do. Yeah,

1912
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:40,590
and you can't fake that, that no,

1913
01:50:40,660 --> 01:50:42,490
you can't fake that it
don't make no money there.

1914
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:44,650
That is a leader is something
you have to believe.

1915
01:50:44,800 --> 01:50:48,820
You have to believe that feeling of they
are actually more important than those

1916
01:50:48,821 --> 01:50:52,870
things in some places come very naturally
with your kids. That comes naturally,

1917
01:50:53,620 --> 01:50:56,770
but you can't fake that and they
will see right through that and that,

1918
01:50:56,771 --> 01:51:00,870
that feeling as a leader, that's hard,

1919
01:51:01,740 --> 01:51:02,573
but

1920
01:51:03,360 --> 01:51:04,193
okay.

1921
01:51:04,470 --> 01:51:06,030
It's actually, it's possible.

1922
01:51:06,120 --> 01:51:11,120
I have worked for people that I've come
to realize they care about me more than

1923
01:51:11,250 --> 01:51:11,280
them.

1924
01:51:11,280 --> 01:51:15,060
They are willing to endure more of
themselves for my benefit and it's almost

1925
01:51:15,061 --> 01:51:16,350
always the other way
around and those people,

1926
01:51:16,351 --> 01:51:20,910
those few times I've worked for people
like that, I would literally do anything.

1927
01:51:21,330 --> 01:51:25,020
Anything for that person work.

1928
01:51:28,740 --> 01:51:32,160
Second, achieving a decision is not easy.

1929
01:51:32,820 --> 01:51:34,720
History is littered
with indecisive battle.

1930
01:51:34,721 --> 01:51:37,620
Sometimes it was enemy skill and
determination that prevented a Vic,

1931
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:41,220
even a victorious commander from
achieving the the decision he sought.

1932
01:51:41,490 --> 01:51:42,420
In other cases,

1933
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:46,050
commanders fought a battle without
envisioning a larger result for their

1934
01:51:46,051 --> 01:51:46,884
actions.

1935
01:51:47,460 --> 01:51:47,670
Yeah.

1936
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:52,130
Again, this is long war. Sometimes even
with the vision of making the decisive,

1937
01:51:52,160 --> 01:51:53,370
making the battle decisive,

1938
01:51:53,550 --> 01:51:58,170
they cannot achieve their goals due to
the chaos and friction that is the nature

1939
01:51:58,171 --> 01:52:01,170
of war and make decisive
victory so difficult.

1940
01:52:02,790 --> 01:52:07,710
That leads to the third lesson. Our
examples point out to be decisive,

1941
01:52:07,770 --> 01:52:12,690
a battle or an engagement
must lead to a result

1942
01:52:14,190 --> 01:52:15,210
yawned itself.

1943
01:52:17,290 --> 01:52:18,123
Okay.

1944
01:52:18,530 --> 01:52:21,860
Must lead to a result beyond itself.

1945
01:52:23,120 --> 01:52:23,870
Within a battle.

1946
01:52:23,870 --> 01:52:28,870
An action that is decisive must lead
directly to winning in the campaign or war

1947
01:52:30,020 --> 01:52:32,960
as a whole. For the battle to be decisive,

1948
01:52:32,961 --> 01:52:37,610
it must lead directly to a larger
success in the war as a whole.

1949
01:52:38,170 --> 01:52:39,003
Okay.

1950
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:44,530
Don't really even need to comment
on that except for to say,

1951
01:52:44,531 --> 01:52:49,531
how often do people and businesses
do things and fight battles?

1952
01:52:50,840 --> 01:52:55,840
They fight battles that have no bearing
and no result beyond the battle itself.

1953
01:52:58,490 --> 01:53:03,490
You see people shooting themselves all
the time with this very idea they're

1954
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:07,460
going to win that war. They're going
to win that argument with their wife,

1955
01:53:07,940 --> 01:53:10,610
right? Oh yeah. They're going to win
that battle. What does it lead to?

1956
01:53:11,300 --> 01:53:11,930
They're going to lead.

1957
01:53:11,930 --> 01:53:14,390
They're going to win that
argument with their subordinate,

1958
01:53:14,840 --> 01:53:16,580
or if they're going to win
that argument with their boss,

1959
01:53:16,581 --> 01:53:19,460
where does it lead them? Oh yeah.
Well, that worked out great for you.

1960
01:53:19,850 --> 01:53:23,600
It actually sets you back
in your campaign. You don't
think about that though.

1961
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:27,060
Okay.

1962
01:53:27,060 --> 01:53:30,630
On the other hand, we must not seek
decisiveness for its own sake. Oh,

1963
01:53:30,631 --> 01:53:33,960
by boom dichotomy coming at
you. We do not, after all,

1964
01:53:33,961 --> 01:53:36,510
seek a decision if it is
likely to be against us.

1965
01:53:36,690 --> 01:53:40,980
We seek to insure in so far as this is
possible given the inherent uncertainties

1966
01:53:40,981 --> 01:53:44,040
of war, that the battle will go our way.

1967
01:53:44,890 --> 01:53:45,270
Okay?

1968
01:53:45,270 --> 01:53:50,270
We have stacked the deck in our favor
before the cards are laid on the table.

1969
01:53:50,730 --> 01:53:54,510
Otherwise, to seek decisive bond
battle is an irresponsible gamble.

1970
01:53:56,240 --> 01:53:57,073
Okay?

1971
01:53:57,660 --> 01:54:02,430
If you're, if you see
me, Jocko, if you see me

1972
01:54:04,590 --> 01:54:05,790
engaged with someone,

1973
01:54:07,140 --> 01:54:07,720
okay.

1974
01:54:07,720 --> 01:54:12,340
I already know the outcome.
Like when I'm talking,

1975
01:54:12,341 --> 01:54:14,530
when I'm discussing someone, some
of them I already know the outcome.

1976
01:54:15,590 --> 01:54:16,423
Yeah.

1977
01:54:16,630 --> 01:54:18,730
Because I've already laid that
out in my head. Otherwise,

1978
01:54:18,731 --> 01:54:19,564
I'm just listening to you.

1979
01:54:19,960 --> 01:54:22,840
I'm just going to listen to you
because I'm learning and I'm not gonna.

1980
01:54:22,930 --> 01:54:25,090
I'm not going to step onto
the battlefield. Right.

1981
01:54:25,210 --> 01:54:30,210
I'll talk to you and we'll discuss
possibilities and outcomes and plans and

1982
01:54:30,821 --> 01:54:31,780
that's, that's great.

1983
01:54:32,230 --> 01:54:37,230
I will not take a stand until I actually
know what the outcome is going to be.

1984
01:54:39,780 --> 01:54:44,460
Just FYI and you've done all the things
that you need to do prior to that up to

1985
01:54:44,461 --> 01:54:48,600
including that conversation. Yes. To
know what that is. Yes. Because if not,

1986
01:54:48,660 --> 01:54:51,960
then you're just arguing for argument
arguments sake and then you might win the

1987
01:54:51,961 --> 01:54:56,190
argument, which is great. Yeah. Only it
won't actually help you in the long run.

1988
01:54:56,520 --> 01:54:59,280
Exactly. When we seek battle,

1989
01:54:59,310 --> 01:55:02,760
we must seek victory accomplishment
of the assigned mission.

1990
01:55:02,761 --> 01:55:07,020
That leads to further significant gains
for the forest as a whole. At Anzio.

1991
01:55:07,021 --> 01:55:09,300
The allied aim was to break
the stalemate in the south,

1992
01:55:09,301 --> 01:55:12,390
opening up a southern front that would
force Germany to move additional forces

1993
01:55:12,630 --> 01:55:13,210
from the defense.

1994
01:55:13,210 --> 01:55:17,100
Enormity this weakening
of normally defenses would
support our planned invasion

1995
01:55:17,101 --> 01:55:22,101
of France later that same year at
Kenai cartridge one cartridge one,

1996
01:55:22,741 --> 01:55:23,430
one round.

1997
01:55:23,430 --> 01:55:26,370
And it's long contention with Rome for
the domination of the Mediterranean.

1998
01:55:26,371 --> 01:55:30,420
These tactical battles were planned
for their overall operational strategic

1999
01:55:30,840 --> 01:55:31,200
effect.

2000
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:35,520
The consequences of a tactical engagement
should lead to achieving operational

2001
01:55:35,521 --> 01:55:40,440
and strategic goals. Please everyone,

2002
01:55:41,010 --> 01:55:45,990
please don't fight battles unless
they're gonna help you win strategically.

2003
01:55:48,300 --> 01:55:48,940
Okay?

2004
01:55:48,940 --> 01:55:53,890
Yeah. The battle for the battle sake
doesn't help you in those examples too.

2005
01:55:54,550 --> 01:55:59,550
We're not doing an amphibious landing
on Tarawa to do an amphibious landing on

2006
01:55:59,950 --> 01:56:00,490
Tara one.

2007
01:56:00,490 --> 01:56:03,730
We're doing an a feminist landing on Toro
to salvage the beachhead specifically.

2008
01:56:03,731 --> 01:56:05,050
So the next,

2009
01:56:05,080 --> 01:56:07,210
the final thing we'll do is push
the enemy off the island or kill it.

2010
01:56:07,750 --> 01:56:09,570
And it's that saying that
we got here, we established,

2011
01:56:09,571 --> 01:56:12,220
we accomplished this mission and this,
this tactical thing, this battle.

2012
01:56:12,460 --> 01:56:15,490
That's actually not what we're
doing. That's a step. In fact,

2013
01:56:15,491 --> 01:56:17,680
we're not even just pushing him
off. Tarwater. That's not the goal.

2014
01:56:17,950 --> 01:56:20,430
The goal isn't to push some other
goal four years down the road. Yeah.

2015
01:56:20,790 --> 01:56:23,020
Absolute goal is two years down the
road. The goal is we're going to put a,

2016
01:56:23,140 --> 01:56:25,840
we're going to put airplanes
here that we can then bomb Japan.

2017
01:56:25,841 --> 01:56:26,980
That's what we're doing. Yes.

2018
01:56:28,770 --> 01:56:29,300
Okay.

2019
01:56:29,300 --> 01:56:30,920
Next section. Military judgment.

2020
01:56:30,921 --> 01:56:35,240
Once we understand what is meant by the
term decisive and why does it important

2021
01:56:35,241 --> 01:56:38,720
to seek a decision? A question
naturally arises, how do we do it?

2022
01:56:38,721 --> 01:56:40,580
There is no easy answer to that question.

2023
01:56:40,581 --> 01:56:45,050
Each battle will have its own unique
answers. As with so much in warfare,

2024
01:56:45,051 --> 01:56:47,720
it depends on the situation.
Know formula, process,

2025
01:56:47,780 --> 01:56:50,390
acronym or Buzzword
can provide the answer.

2026
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:52,273
Okay.

2027
01:56:53,300 --> 01:56:56,780
No formula, process, acronym or
Buzzword can provide the answer.

2028
01:56:57,410 --> 01:57:01,850
Rather the [inaudible] and you wouldn't
guess that if you saw, if you saw,

2029
01:57:01,910 --> 01:57:05,720
if you go online, even with the,
even what they do with like me,

2030
01:57:06,080 --> 01:57:10,490
they'll do an article on me. Three
things a leader needs to do. It's, yeah,

2031
01:57:10,620 --> 01:57:13,580
there's three. That's definitely a three.
Those are three? Yup. There's three.

2032
01:57:14,390 --> 01:57:18,890
But guess what? You need to actually
learn the art behind the science. Rather.

2033
01:57:18,891 --> 01:57:23,570
The answer is in military judgment
and the ability of the commander to

2034
01:57:23,571 --> 01:57:26,930
understand the battlefield and act
decisively. Military judgment is to,

2035
01:57:27,050 --> 01:57:31,310
is a developed skill that is honed by
the wisdom gained through experience

2036
01:57:31,580 --> 01:57:33,530
combined with situational awareness.

2037
01:57:33,650 --> 01:57:37,040
Military judgment allows us
to identify emerging patterns,

2038
01:57:37,220 --> 01:57:41,720
discern critical vulnerabilities,
and concentrate combat power.

2039
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:45,720
The beauty of that is the Marine Corps,

2040
01:57:46,050 --> 01:57:50,520
the Marine court understands that those
traits, that attribute of judgement,

2041
01:57:50,730 --> 01:57:55,080
that attribute of decisiveness,
those can be developed.

2042
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:56,520
Those can be learned.

2043
01:57:56,730 --> 01:58:00,090
Those aren't just innate natural capacity
that we just happen to bring these

2044
01:58:00,091 --> 01:58:01,080
people into the Marine Corps.

2045
01:58:01,290 --> 01:58:04,710
That's one of the traits that the Marine
Corps recognizes that we have to teach

2046
01:58:04,711 --> 01:58:09,711
people to learn decisiveness and teach
people the quality of judgment and they

2047
01:58:10,381 --> 01:58:13,770
breed that in their marines and they
train and teach them. Now, yeah,

2048
01:58:13,820 --> 01:58:16,740
some are better than others, no
doubt about it, but these qualities,

2049
01:58:16,741 --> 01:58:18,570
these things, and we're talking
about how important these are,

2050
01:58:18,600 --> 01:58:21,660
not just in the military but in the
private sector. These can be learned.

2051
01:58:21,720 --> 01:58:24,630
These can be evolved and
developed inside everybody.

2052
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,570
T to what degree is it
certainly different,

2053
01:58:27,660 --> 01:58:29,730
but everybody can get better
at this, almost everybody.

2054
01:58:30,600 --> 01:58:31,433
Okay.

2055
01:58:32,130 --> 01:58:35,230
True. Right. Yeah, no, you're
right. Absolutely. And I,

2056
01:58:35,310 --> 01:58:37,530
I'm speaking in absolutes
and, and, and everybody,

2057
01:58:37,590 --> 01:58:41,200
and really what I should be saying
is not just, I shouldn't say it,

2058
01:58:41,260 --> 01:58:42,700
that everybody has to
say almost everybody,

2059
01:58:43,300 --> 01:58:48,300
but I should say we have so much more
capacity to evolve these things than we

2060
01:58:48,851 --> 01:58:51,340
think we do. Yeah. And by the way,

2061
01:58:51,341 --> 01:58:54,850
just in case no one was paying attention
to what I've been saying for the last

2062
01:58:54,851 --> 01:58:57,430
25 years. When I say
almost everybody, the,

2063
01:58:57,431 --> 01:59:00,040
almost the person that
I can't teach this to,

2064
01:59:00,041 --> 01:59:03,130
the person that can't improve
their military judgment
is the person that already

2065
01:59:03,131 --> 01:59:06,400
thinks they have good days and no one
knows it all yet is the person that thinks

2066
01:59:06,401 --> 01:59:09,310
that they already have the
wisdom that that person,

2067
01:59:09,400 --> 01:59:11,950
they're not going to
get any better. In fact,

2068
01:59:11,951 --> 01:59:15,040
they're going to get worse because
they'll reinforce their ideas.

2069
01:59:15,820 --> 01:59:20,490
So if you have an open mind, you can
get way better at this stuff. Yeah.

2070
01:59:21,070 --> 01:59:22,960
If you don't have an open
mind, you won't get any better

2071
01:59:24,880 --> 01:59:26,080
understanding the situation,

2072
01:59:26,081 --> 01:59:28,690
the first requirement of commanders
to understand the situation.

2073
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:32,080
You would think that that was just so off,

2074
01:59:32,081 --> 01:59:34,690
so self evident that you
wouldn't even say it in the book,

2075
01:59:35,590 --> 01:59:39,340
but how often am I dealing with
the leader, military, civilian,

2076
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:41,230
another human being
just going through life.

2077
01:59:41,231 --> 01:59:42,970
They don't even understand
the situation that they're in.

2078
01:59:42,971 --> 01:59:46,330
That's why we have to save
this out loud in a book.

2079
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:49,810
The first requirement of commander
is to understand the situation.

2080
01:59:50,350 --> 01:59:53,650
The successful tacticians studies the
situation to develop it as mind to clear

2081
01:59:53,651 --> 01:59:56,050
picture of what is happening,
how it got that way,

2082
01:59:56,051 --> 01:59:59,740
and how it might develop further
considering the factors of mission, enemy,

2083
01:59:59,741 --> 02:00:03,580
terrain and weather troops and
support available. This has met,

2084
02:00:03,610 --> 02:00:08,610
met t the commander must think through
all actions determine the desired result

2085
02:00:09,911 --> 02:00:12,100
and ascertain the means
to achieve that result.

2086
02:00:12,340 --> 02:00:15,970
Part of the commander's thinking should
also include assuming the role of the

2087
02:00:15,971 --> 02:00:16,540
enemy,

2088
02:00:16,540 --> 02:00:20,230
considering what the enemies best course
of action may be in deciding how to

2089
02:00:20,231 --> 02:00:24,940
defeat it. Thinking through these elements
helps the commander develop increased

2090
02:00:24,941 --> 02:00:28,510
situational awareness. So yes,

2091
02:00:29,470 --> 02:00:31,720
study the situation,

2092
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:34,750
study how it got that way,

2093
02:00:35,230 --> 02:00:37,660
study how it might further develop.

2094
02:00:40,060 --> 02:00:42,530
It's interesting when we work
with companies cause you,

2095
02:00:42,550 --> 02:00:45,460
you get with the first thing you
get is kind of where they're at.

2096
02:00:45,940 --> 02:00:50,940
Like here's where we're at right now and
then you start getting filled in on on

2097
02:00:51,460 --> 02:00:55,720
how it got the out there. And those
are some interesting stories often.

2098
02:00:56,170 --> 02:01:00,610
And then we're looking at how it could
develop because one thing we know is if

2099
02:01:00,611 --> 02:01:03,070
we develop leaders and we
start to get on the path,

2100
02:01:03,430 --> 02:01:05,680
it's going to develop in a great
way and if we don't do that,

2101
02:01:05,681 --> 02:01:07,120
it's going to be problematic. Yeah.

2102
02:01:09,400 --> 02:01:11,110
Based on this understanding
of the situation,

2103
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:14,500
the commander can begin to form a
mental image of how the battle might be

2104
02:01:14,501 --> 02:01:14,921
fought.

2105
02:01:14,921 --> 02:01:17,800
Central to the commander's thinking
must be the question and this situation,

2106
02:01:17,860 --> 02:01:20,050
what efforts will be decisive?

2107
02:01:21,610 --> 02:01:26,110
The commander asked this one, this
question, not just once, but repeatedly.

2108
02:01:26,110 --> 02:01:27,700
As the battle progresses,

2109
02:01:27,880 --> 02:01:31,540
the commander must also address the
possible outcomes and the new situations

2110
02:01:31,541 --> 02:01:34,810
that will result from those
possibilities. As the situation changes,

2111
02:01:34,811 --> 02:01:38,770
so will the solutions and the
actions that derive from it.

2112
02:01:40,460 --> 02:01:43,820
You always have to
reassess what's going on.

2113
02:01:45,740 --> 02:01:46,610
For every situation,

2114
02:01:46,611 --> 02:01:50,720
the leader must be able to decide which
of the countless and often confusing

2115
02:01:50,721 --> 02:01:52,820
pieces of information are
important and reliable.

2116
02:01:54,290 --> 02:01:57,890
The leader must determine what the enemy
is trying to do and how to counter his

2117
02:01:57,891 --> 02:01:58,724
efforts.

2118
02:01:58,790 --> 02:02:03,790
The leader's skill is essentially
one of pattern recognition.

2119
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:07,400
The ability after seeing only a few pieces
of the puzzle to fill in the rest of

2120
02:02:07,401 --> 02:02:08,234
the picture correctly.

2121
02:02:08,420 --> 02:02:11,840
Pattern recognition is the ability to
understand the true significance and

2122
02:02:11,841 --> 02:02:14,300
dynamics of a situation
with limited information.

2123
02:02:14,750 --> 02:02:17,900
Pattern recognition is a key skill
for success on the battlefield.

2124
02:02:18,980 --> 02:02:20,420
Get those overlays out.

2125
02:02:21,890 --> 02:02:26,300
Tack tactics requires leaders to make
decisions and leader must make decisions

2126
02:02:26,301 --> 02:02:29,840
in a constantly changing environment
of friction, uncertainty and danger.

2127
02:02:29,990 --> 02:02:33,980
Making effective decisions and acting
on those decisions faster than the enemy

2128
02:02:33,981 --> 02:02:36,500
is a crucial element of
Marine Corps tactics.

2129
02:02:37,680 --> 02:02:37,850
Okay.

2130
02:02:37,850 --> 02:02:40,670
Making decisions faster.
Sometimes there are some of them.

2131
02:02:40,671 --> 02:02:44,180
There may be time to analyze situations
deliberately and consider multiple

2132
02:02:44,181 --> 02:02:44,780
options.

2133
02:02:44,780 --> 02:02:48,260
Comparing several options and selecting
the best one is known as analytical

2134
02:02:48,261 --> 02:02:48,921
decision making.

2135
02:02:48,921 --> 02:02:51,830
When time allows a commander to
apply analytical decision making,

2136
02:02:52,010 --> 02:02:54,470
usually before an engagement
or before battle begins,

2137
02:02:54,560 --> 02:02:59,270
the commanders should make the most of
it absolutely once engaged. However,

2138
02:02:59,570 --> 02:03:03,770
the commander finds time is short and
the need and the need for speed is

2139
02:03:03,830 --> 02:03:05,510
paramount. In some cases,

2140
02:03:05,511 --> 02:03:09,200
speeding up the analytical decision
process may be sufficient. However,

2141
02:03:09,201 --> 02:03:10,280
in most cases,

2142
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:15,520
intuitive decision making is needed
to generate and maintain tempo.

2143
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,990
Intuitive decision making relies on a
commander's intuitive ability to recognize

2144
02:03:20,991 --> 02:03:24,980
the key elements of a particular problem
and arrive at the proper decision

2145
02:03:25,190 --> 02:03:28,220
without having to
compare multiple options.

2146
02:03:28,460 --> 02:03:33,440
Intuition is not some mysterious
reality, not some mysterious quality.

2147
02:03:33,560 --> 02:03:37,100
Rather, it is a developed skill grounded,

2148
02:03:37,101 --> 02:03:41,720
firmly inexperienced and one that can be
further developed through education and

2149
02:03:41,721 --> 02:03:43,970
practice is not without
some risk. However,

2150
02:03:44,090 --> 02:03:48,080
and leaders should use the decision
making style that works for them.

2151
02:03:50,510 --> 02:03:53,330
Learn to detach, learn
to take a step back,

2152
02:03:53,960 --> 02:03:58,670
make the intuitive decision making
credible, incremental decisions.

2153
02:04:01,270 --> 02:04:02,103
Okay.

2154
02:04:02,150 --> 02:04:04,660
You know, Brian Stann when
Brian San was on here,

2155
02:04:05,170 --> 02:04:08,470
I'll have to go listen to it again.
But one thing I noticed is he always,

2156
02:04:08,530 --> 02:04:13,390
he was really into the tempo and, and
I, I paid attention to that. He said,

2157
02:04:13,420 --> 02:04:17,920
Yo, I wanted to keep the temple when
you, you, you, you know, certain people,

2158
02:04:18,490 --> 02:04:21,580
they sort of, they sort of
grasp onto a tenant and,

2159
02:04:21,610 --> 02:04:23,620
and it makes really good sense to them.

2160
02:04:24,400 --> 02:04:29,100
And when Stan was on like
I could see, oh yeah. He,

2161
02:04:29,110 --> 02:04:31,510
the way he talked about
maintaining that temple, you know,

2162
02:04:31,511 --> 02:04:34,320
he had a good instructor at that
block of the basic school. Yeah.

2163
02:04:34,420 --> 02:04:37,410
He really explained it well and
he said, okay, I get this. I can,

2164
02:04:37,560 --> 02:04:40,270
I can see if I can go, if
I can keep that speed up,

2165
02:04:40,290 --> 02:04:43,860
if I can keep that operational
tempo up, I can overcome my enemy.

2166
02:04:46,470 --> 02:04:46,800
Yeah.

2167
02:04:46,800 --> 02:04:51,800
I love how they described the idea of
being intuitive is not magic or mystery.

2168
02:04:52,650 --> 02:04:53,940
Yeah. And people write that off like, oh,

2169
02:04:53,941 --> 02:04:57,630
he's got people that are naturally
intuitive actually aren't naturally

2170
02:04:57,631 --> 02:04:57,990
intuitive.

2171
02:04:57,990 --> 02:05:01,650
They've cultivated and developed that
through a ton of experience at and the

2172
02:05:01,651 --> 02:05:05,160
discipline to put themselves in those
situations over and over and over again.

2173
02:05:05,640 --> 02:05:10,020
And for those of us on the outside
looks like it's just natural. Yeah.

2174
02:05:10,170 --> 02:05:14,190
But it's really a byproduct of all the
Times that they've done that. So it is,

2175
02:05:14,370 --> 02:05:17,460
it is natural to them only because of
what they've done to put those on that

2176
02:05:17,461 --> 02:05:18,150
position. Yeah.

2177
02:05:18,150 --> 02:05:22,440
And there's like pragmatic things that
you can do to make yourself seem super

2178
02:05:22,441 --> 02:05:26,640
intuitive. And I do them all
the time there. For instance,

2179
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:28,230
and I was just writing about this,

2180
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:33,720
I'll sit there and there'll be a group
of my subordinates talking about whatever

2181
02:05:33,750 --> 02:05:38,610
thing we got to decide on and I'm not
saying a damn word and I'll listen and

2182
02:05:38,611 --> 02:05:41,880
I'll get all this great information
from all of them about all the different

2183
02:05:41,881 --> 02:05:44,400
possibilities of things, way
things go in a way. Things,

2184
02:05:44,430 --> 02:05:47,220
the outcomes we could have and the
resistance we could meet in these various

2185
02:05:47,221 --> 02:05:50,460
areas. And I get done listening
to all that for 28 minutes.

2186
02:05:50,910 --> 02:05:51,743
Then I haven't said anything,

2187
02:05:52,020 --> 02:05:55,620
but guess what I've done is I've taken
all those things and by being detached

2188
02:05:55,621 --> 02:06:00,621
and by listening and by not
having a preformed opinion
and by letting my ego not

2189
02:06:01,021 --> 02:06:03,570
drive my decision making.
When I finally say, Hey,

2190
02:06:05,120 --> 02:06:05,350
okay,

2191
02:06:05,350 --> 02:06:07,390
here's the best way to go forward.

2192
02:06:08,660 --> 02:06:09,080
Okay.

2193
02:06:09,080 --> 02:06:12,320
It seems like, oh, the bubbles was both.
He made that decision really easily.

2194
02:06:12,740 --> 02:06:15,350
No, actually it's, it's
because I just listened.

2195
02:06:15,500 --> 02:06:19,790
There's pragmatic things you can do
that can make you seem more intuitive.

2196
02:06:20,120 --> 02:06:22,880
An incremental decision is one of those
things as well because you can make an

2197
02:06:22,881 --> 02:06:26,390
incremental decisions very easily
because there's less risk in it.

2198
02:06:27,490 --> 02:06:27,840
Okay,

2199
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:29,160
so when you say, Hey, listen,

2200
02:06:29,400 --> 02:06:33,150
we just landed and the the Germans,

2201
02:06:33,180 --> 02:06:36,390
we haven't had many resistance.
We're going forward.

2202
02:06:36,990 --> 02:06:40,920
We're going to go forward three more
miles. That seems like a really bold,

2203
02:06:40,921 --> 02:06:41,820
intuitive decision,

2204
02:06:42,150 --> 02:06:46,620
but really you haven't met any resistance
and it's pretty easy to make because

2205
02:06:46,621 --> 02:06:50,960
you're not over committing, so,
so you seem like the super cool.

2206
02:06:51,090 --> 02:06:54,630
You're not saying, hey, we're going all
the way to Rome. You're just saying,

2207
02:06:54,660 --> 02:06:56,910
hey, we're just going to go three
more miles. We made it three,

2208
02:06:56,970 --> 02:07:00,830
we're going to double it. Let's go at
different things. Damn, that's bold. Yeah,

2209
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:03,780
but the reality is you haven't
met any stern resistance. Cool.

2210
02:07:03,781 --> 02:07:04,680
Let's rock and roll.

2211
02:07:05,860 --> 02:07:06,040
Okay.

2212
02:07:06,040 --> 02:07:08,560
Am I super intuitive?
No, I'm just detached.

2213
02:07:08,770 --> 02:07:13,000
I'm assessing and making a
decision or, well, you know,

2214
02:07:13,060 --> 02:07:14,740
I find myself kind of
laughing. I'm hearing you.

2215
02:07:14,920 --> 02:07:17,140
You read it and I kind of
chuckled to myself a little bit.

2216
02:07:18,230 --> 02:07:23,140
There is the reason these seemingly
totally simple and obvious statements need

2217
02:07:23,141 --> 02:07:28,141
to be said like you need to assess the
situation and figure out how we got here

2218
02:07:28,690 --> 02:07:32,530
like that. It's so easy to listen to that,

2219
02:07:32,531 --> 02:07:36,020
but in reality it's really
hard people to do that and the

2220
02:07:36,020 --> 02:07:36,910
people that do that,

2221
02:07:36,911 --> 02:07:41,260
the worst are the ones that
are most emotional about
what's going on to the most

2222
02:07:41,290 --> 02:07:45,970
inside. We we talk about at echelon
front, when we talk with companies,

2223
02:07:46,120 --> 02:07:49,390
we talk about detach. When we're
talking about prioritize and execute,

2224
02:07:49,540 --> 02:07:51,010
and if I say prioritize and execute,

2225
02:07:51,190 --> 02:07:55,570
the first thing that people jump to is
I've got to get the right resources and

2226
02:07:55,571 --> 02:07:57,490
make sure I know what the right
priorities are. That is true,

2227
02:07:57,970 --> 02:08:02,260
but actually individually what you need
to do is you need to detach from what's

2228
02:08:02,261 --> 02:08:06,730
going on and make sure that what seems
to be a priority for you isn't a priority

2229
02:08:06,731 --> 02:08:10,090
because you're so inside that
and so emotional about that,

2230
02:08:10,091 --> 02:08:13,150
that you can't see that
actually this thing changed.

2231
02:08:13,600 --> 02:08:16,420
Step beat took us to this and and things
are different now we have to shift our

2232
02:08:16,421 --> 02:08:20,170
priorities and it isn't just people out,

2233
02:08:20,280 --> 02:08:22,000
the resources allocated to the
right things. Those are true.

2234
02:08:22,001 --> 02:08:26,170
It's are you detached from the situation
so you're actually doing that correctly

2235
02:08:26,380 --> 02:08:30,100
so you don't stay in one place too long
or pushed too far forward or anything in

2236
02:08:30,101 --> 02:08:34,920
between and sounds right at the say
you needed to attach and pay attention.

2237
02:08:35,130 --> 02:08:36,130
Look what's going on around you.

2238
02:08:36,460 --> 02:08:39,190
And we kind of laugh that it's
so hard for some people to do,

2239
02:08:39,250 --> 02:08:41,730
especially when it's your thing
that you're living on the inside.

2240
02:08:41,830 --> 02:08:44,980
And when you do that as a commander and
do that as a leader in an organization,

2241
02:08:44,981 --> 02:08:48,490
you can crush organizations by being so
committed to the thing that you're doing

2242
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:51,580
in one direction or another because
you're simply just not detached.

2243
02:08:52,270 --> 02:08:55,600
And when you can show people
what detachment looks like
and just pull them out a

2244
02:08:55,601 --> 02:08:58,510
little bit and you look around,
I was at an FTX two weeks ago,

2245
02:08:59,260 --> 02:09:02,200
so we do this FTX it's in there. They
can be very chaotic, very dynamic.

2246
02:09:02,201 --> 02:09:03,880
There's things going on
in more often than not,

2247
02:09:03,881 --> 02:09:06,250
when you're leading your team
in this FTX is field training.

2248
02:09:06,550 --> 02:09:09,250
You're getting slaughtered by
the enemy. There's 15 of you,

2249
02:09:09,310 --> 02:09:12,100
there's three of them and
they're destroying you because
they'd see what's going

2250
02:09:12,101 --> 02:09:14,740
on. And the leaders run around
and they try to make decisions.

2251
02:09:14,741 --> 02:09:18,610
And I grabbed someone who was, who was
dead. So he puts out hate, sat them down,

2252
02:09:19,330 --> 02:09:19,781
pull them up.

2253
02:09:19,781 --> 02:09:22,780
And I sat him next to me and I took about
20 steps away from the action. I said,

2254
02:09:23,350 --> 02:09:26,080
what do you see? Just tell me
what you see. And they say, Oh,

2255
02:09:26,081 --> 02:09:29,800
I see a group over here running.
I see someone getting cover.

2256
02:09:30,130 --> 02:09:32,230
I see two enemy running
behind that building.

2257
02:09:32,350 --> 02:09:35,710
And they went on and said
about 15 different things
that they saw. And I said,

2258
02:09:35,711 --> 02:09:38,770
you know what you see
actually you see everything.

2259
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:42,170
You're just standing here looking around
cause you're totally detaching and

2260
02:09:42,740 --> 02:09:44,680
what, what do you think
we should do? He said,

2261
02:09:45,190 --> 02:09:47,740
oh those people need to get from
behind that building and run over here.

2262
02:09:47,980 --> 02:09:50,050
Like that's what a good leader does.

2263
02:09:50,680 --> 02:09:53,230
And when they can see that from the
outside instead of the inside out,

2264
02:09:53,231 --> 02:09:55,510
all this stuff becomes obvious
and we're listening, you know,

2265
02:09:55,511 --> 02:09:57,280
leading reading it and
sort of laughing about it.

2266
02:09:57,281 --> 02:10:00,820
But it's actually really hard to do when
you're inside that. Yeah, that's the,

2267
02:10:01,300 --> 02:10:02,800
that's the classic Seth Stone Story.

2268
02:10:02,801 --> 02:10:06,670
I tell him when he had his neck brace
on during land warfare and he wasn't

2269
02:10:06,671 --> 02:10:07,810
allowed to participate and he said,

2270
02:10:07,811 --> 02:10:12,210
they're watching is his to ask you to
get annihilated. And he says, you know,

2271
02:10:12,250 --> 02:10:13,420
can I help them? And I said, well,

2272
02:10:13,421 --> 02:10:16,250
hold on a minute and then they're going
to be annihilated anymore. And I says,

2273
02:10:16,330 --> 02:10:18,190
can I help them? And I said, all
right, go ahead and help him.

2274
02:10:18,191 --> 02:10:18,791
And he gives them, you know,

2275
02:10:18,791 --> 02:10:22,660
one quick immediate action drill
and they executed and they're gone.

2276
02:10:22,661 --> 02:10:26,020
And he says to me, man, it's so
easy when you're way up here.

2277
02:10:26,080 --> 02:10:30,170
And we were literally six
inches above the task dude.

2278
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:34,040
But when you're, and then I told
him, you know, when we were going

2279
02:10:34,040 --> 02:10:35,600
through this training,
it was like this for me.

2280
02:10:35,601 --> 02:10:39,500
Every time I could see everything because
I was detached, I wasn't in the weeds.

2281
02:10:40,160 --> 02:10:41,270
And that's gives you,

2282
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:46,780
gives you this in car ratable power
and visibility and it happens,

2283
02:10:46,850 --> 02:10:50,510
does it? We're not only, here's the
thing, we're not only talking about,

2284
02:10:50,910 --> 02:10:52,850
well the battlefield or
the trainings and Arrow,

2285
02:10:52,851 --> 02:10:56,420
we're talking about any situation.
We're talking about business and yes,

2286
02:10:56,421 --> 02:11:00,350
we're talking about life
as well. Take a step back.

2287
02:11:01,850 --> 02:11:06,850
I had a friend that was falling
off the cliff with addiction,

2288
02:11:07,850 --> 02:11:09,740
alcohol, alcohol addiction.

2289
02:11:10,370 --> 02:11:15,370
And he was briefing me on another person
that we knew that was fallen off the

2290
02:11:15,771 --> 02:11:17,630
cliff of drug addiction.

2291
02:11:18,560 --> 02:11:22,480
And he's sitting there explaining this
to me. Like, I can't believe your kids.

2292
02:11:22,520 --> 02:11:26,360
He doesn't even see what's happening.
It's so bad. And he doesn't get it.

2293
02:11:26,361 --> 02:11:30,020
He can't see how bad it is for himself.
And I'm sitting there and I was,

2294
02:11:30,021 --> 02:11:33,890
I was going to the extreme. I was
good. I know. I can't believe how hard,

2295
02:11:33,980 --> 02:11:37,950
I can't believe he can't see that.
And I was describing him. Yeah.

2296
02:11:39,680 --> 02:11:40,640
Cause we can't detach.

2297
02:11:40,650 --> 02:11:44,750
We get caught in relationships and jobs
and scenarios that are bad because we

2298
02:11:44,751 --> 02:11:47,300
can't attach and we'd get
emotional, so don't let it happen.

2299
02:11:49,790 --> 02:11:53,240
Leaders with strong situational awareness
and broad experience can act quickly

2300
02:11:53,241 --> 02:11:55,850
because they have intuitive
understanding of the situation,

2301
02:11:55,851 --> 02:11:58,490
know what needs to be done
and know what can be done.

2302
02:11:59,150 --> 02:11:59,983
Okay.

2303
02:12:00,290 --> 02:12:03,740
This insight has often
been called Ku, do we?

2304
02:12:04,770 --> 02:12:05,020
Yeah,

2305
02:12:05,020 --> 02:12:07,630
which is a French term and we've
talked about it on this podcast,

2306
02:12:07,631 --> 02:12:08,950
which literally means a stroke the I,

2307
02:12:08,951 --> 02:12:12,400
which means you take a quick glance at
something and you can understand it.

2308
02:12:13,480 --> 02:12:18,480
It's also been called Tactical Sense
Union army re-did General John Buford's

2309
02:12:19,301 --> 02:12:22,840
approach to the battle of Gettysburg
offers a good example of understanding the

2310
02:12:22,841 --> 02:12:27,370
battle so that it leads to a decision
arriving at Gettysburg with a division of

2311
02:12:27,371 --> 02:12:30,340
cavalry. In the morning of June 30th,

2312
02:12:30,340 --> 02:12:33,760
1863 Buford saw confederate
forces approaching from
the northwest with the bulk

2313
02:12:33,761 --> 02:12:36,100
of the union forces still some miles away.

2314
02:12:36,101 --> 02:12:41,101
Buford was able to conceptualize
the coming battle in his
mind from his position

2315
02:12:41,471 --> 02:12:43,930
on a hill outside of town.

2316
02:12:44,810 --> 02:12:45,643
Okay.

2317
02:12:46,200 --> 02:12:47,670
He's defacto detached.

2318
02:12:48,120 --> 02:12:51,630
He could see that early seizure of
the high ground west at Gettysburg was

2319
02:12:51,631 --> 02:12:55,650
critical to giving the army of the
Potomac time to mass its forces.

2320
02:12:55,890 --> 02:12:59,640
Op occupation of this high ground would
also preserve tactical advantage of the

2321
02:12:59,641 --> 02:13:03,090
high ground to Buford's rear for the
Union army once they arrived on the

2322
02:13:03,091 --> 02:13:03,924
battlefield.

2323
02:13:04,650 --> 02:13:09,650
Buf Buford also knew that
if the confederates were
allowed to mass forces first

2324
02:13:10,050 --> 02:13:13,440
around the high ground to the south and
west Lee would have the advantage over

2325
02:13:13,441 --> 02:13:17,940
the arrive Union forces quickly spreading
out one brigade west of town along

2326
02:13:17,941 --> 02:13:22,941
Macpherson's Ridge General Buford
settled in to defend Gettysburg until the

2327
02:13:23,221 --> 02:13:26,970
arrival of union reinforcements
on July 1st the following day,

2328
02:13:26,971 --> 02:13:29,790
he held his ground against the
division of confederate infantry,

2329
02:13:29,791 --> 02:13:34,110
supported by artillery until John Reynolds
second core came up and reinforced

2330
02:13:34,111 --> 02:13:36,780
the line. General Buford's ability
to foresee the coming battle,

2331
02:13:36,960 --> 02:13:40,320
take quick action in the disposition
of his forces and hold the high ground

2332
02:13:40,600 --> 02:13:44,340
until reinforcers one of the different
decisive actions that defeated the army

2333
02:13:44,341 --> 02:13:45,260
of Northern Virginia.

2334
02:13:45,360 --> 02:13:49,440
At the battle of Gettysburg Buford's
actions at Gettysburg demonstrated an

2335
02:13:49,441 --> 02:13:53,160
exceptional ability to grasp the essence
of a tactical situation through the

2336
02:13:53,161 --> 02:13:57,060
skills of pattern
recognition, recognition, and
intuitive decision making.

2337
02:13:58,470 --> 02:14:02,490
I'm going to say that when you get up
on the high ground and you look around,

2338
02:14:02,550 --> 02:14:04,980
you can see things that
other people aren't going to
see and you can make really

2339
02:14:04,981 --> 02:14:08,100
good decisions. Now, this
is a physical example,

2340
02:14:08,220 --> 02:14:11,400
but you can mentally do this
as well and you have to,

2341
02:14:11,730 --> 02:14:15,570
you have to mentally step back, detach,

2342
02:14:16,200 --> 02:14:17,120
acting decisively.

2343
02:14:17,130 --> 02:14:20,400
Our ability to understand the situation
is useless if we're not prepared to act

2344
02:14:20,401 --> 02:14:22,710
decisively when the opportunity arrives,

2345
02:14:22,711 --> 02:14:24,840
we must exploit it fully and aggressively.

2346
02:14:24,841 --> 02:14:29,760
Committing every ounce of combat power
we can muster and pushing ourselves to

2347
02:14:29,761 --> 02:14:31,110
the limits of exhaustion.

2348
02:14:31,260 --> 02:14:34,770
The keys to this effort are identifying
enemy critical vulnerabilities,

2349
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:37,320
shaping the operation
area to our advantage.

2350
02:14:37,470 --> 02:14:42,470
Designating a main effort to focus our
combat power and acting in a bold and

2351
02:14:43,501 --> 02:14:44,760
ruthless manner.

2352
02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:49,370
Critical vulnerabilities
for battlefield success.

2353
02:14:49,450 --> 02:14:51,860
It is not enough to generate
superior combat power.

2354
02:14:52,010 --> 02:14:55,970
We must focus that combat
power. Hmm, interesting.

2355
02:14:56,600 --> 02:14:58,940
We must concentrate our
efforts on a critical,

2356
02:14:58,970 --> 02:15:03,140
critical vulnerability that
is a vulnerability which
permits us to destroy some

2357
02:15:03,141 --> 02:15:06,620
capability without which the
enemy cannot function effectively.

2358
02:15:08,510 --> 02:15:12,170
Seeking the enemies of vulnerabilities
means striking with our strength against

2359
02:15:12,171 --> 02:15:16,810
his weakness rather than his
strength and at a time in the end,

2360
02:15:16,950 --> 02:15:19,040
he's not prepared. This
is where we can often

2361
02:15:20,580 --> 02:15:23,510
cause the greatest damage at the lowest
cost to ourselves. In practical terms,

2362
02:15:23,511 --> 02:15:25,490
this means avoiding his front.

2363
02:15:26,690 --> 02:15:27,000
Yeah.

2364
02:15:27,000 --> 02:15:30,720
The frontal assault where his attention
is focused and striking his flanks and

2365
02:15:30,721 --> 02:15:32,520
rear we did not, does not expect us.

2366
02:15:33,770 --> 02:15:34,190
Yeah,

2367
02:15:34,190 --> 02:15:38,200
so yes, the frontal assault, it
does exist and it can be used.

2368
02:15:39,320 --> 02:15:39,670
Yeah.

2369
02:15:39,670 --> 02:15:42,700
Not the best option. Very
often. Not the best option.

2370
02:15:42,940 --> 02:15:45,910
Just because a target is vulnerable
does not however mean that it's worth

2371
02:15:45,911 --> 02:15:46,391
attacking.

2372
02:15:46,391 --> 02:15:50,440
We must direct our resources and strike
those capabilities that are critical to

2373
02:15:50,441 --> 02:15:52,870
the enemy's ability to
function, to defend, attack,

2374
02:15:52,871 --> 02:15:55,120
or sustain himself or
to command his forces.

2375
02:15:55,180 --> 02:15:58,390
We must focus our efforts on
those critical vulnerabilities
that will bend the

2376
02:15:58,391 --> 02:16:00,430
enemy most to are well, most quickly.

2377
02:16:01,220 --> 02:16:03,700
You know what that makes me think
of when that makes me think.

2378
02:16:05,020 --> 02:16:10,020
When I see leaders get focused
on things that don't matter,

2379
02:16:10,900 --> 02:16:13,570
that they're going to get
critical about. So you know, Dave,

2380
02:16:13,571 --> 02:16:15,610
you're doing 10 things, six,

2381
02:16:15,640 --> 02:16:18,490
three of them are really
important for our organization.

2382
02:16:19,270 --> 02:16:22,240
There's two of them that are at the
bottom end that aren't really like a big

2383
02:16:22,241 --> 02:16:25,690
impact at all. You're doing
your top three pretty well.

2384
02:16:26,530 --> 02:16:30,130
You're letting one of your bottom
two just like doing it horribly.

2385
02:16:30,520 --> 02:16:33,100
I might mention a little something
about it just to make sure it doesn't go

2386
02:16:33,101 --> 02:16:34,900
completely off the rails, but I've seen,

2387
02:16:34,980 --> 02:16:38,140
I see leaders that they take all that
focus in and focus on something that

2388
02:16:38,141 --> 02:16:40,350
doesn't matter. They want
to get mad about you,

2389
02:16:40,351 --> 02:16:43,210
you should've done this or you
should've done that. And I'm thinking,

2390
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:46,900
where are you really going to expend your
leadership capital on that thing that

2391
02:16:46,901 --> 02:16:50,710
barely even matters? You know, going
back to the patches with me and life,

2392
02:16:50,711 --> 02:16:53,110
you know, hey, I'm not going to
expend a bunch of liters of capital.

2393
02:16:53,111 --> 02:16:55,540
And the fact that you are aware
of these patches. You know what,

2394
02:16:55,780 --> 02:16:59,740
I don't like it, but cool. Let's,
let's move on. I what I want you to do,

2395
02:16:59,741 --> 02:17:02,860
life and Seth, I want you guys to
plan an execute awesome missions.

2396
02:17:02,861 --> 02:17:06,040
I want you to take the fight to the enemy
that that's the top things I want you

2397
02:17:06,041 --> 02:17:09,250
to do. Do I want you to dress
professionally? Yes, I do.

2398
02:17:09,730 --> 02:17:13,300
But that's pretty low on the totem pole
given where we are in this situation

2399
02:17:13,301 --> 02:17:17,590
right now. Yeah. And leaders, we'll,
we'll create this, this scenario by which,

2400
02:17:17,660 --> 02:17:21,550
okay, if I, if I acquiesce
on that one little thing,

2401
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:24,910
that's a weakness and they're going to
see that I don't hold the line on that

2402
02:17:24,911 --> 02:17:28,300
and so it's gonna effect everything
else. And so they, they'll,

2403
02:17:28,330 --> 02:17:33,220
they'll overdo that one thing because
I hold the, that's how I lead.

2404
02:17:33,221 --> 02:17:35,290
I hold the line on
everything when in reality,

2405
02:17:36,070 --> 02:17:40,240
the exact opposite will happen is,
is they'll recognize it. John Goes,

2406
02:17:40,241 --> 02:17:41,500
actually a human being, hey,

2407
02:17:41,501 --> 02:17:44,830
and I'm not going to just completely
GAF off Jocko and ignore what he says.

2408
02:17:44,831 --> 02:17:46,450
He's kind of these give me
a little indication, hey,

2409
02:17:46,660 --> 02:17:49,540
don't let this thing fall solar off
the rails that it then starts to affect

2410
02:17:49,541 --> 02:17:49,961
everything else,

2411
02:17:49,961 --> 02:17:54,170
but what actually is important is what
we're focusing on and the inflexibility

2412
02:17:54,310 --> 02:17:56,110
we see leaders like, well, I'm going
to hold the line on everything.

2413
02:17:56,110 --> 02:17:56,920
Well guess what?

2414
02:17:56,920 --> 02:18:00,430
Not Everything is the same importance
and not everything will have the same

2415
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:03,970
impact on the outcome and what you need
to focus on the most is a things that

2416
02:18:03,971 --> 02:18:05,950
are most impactful. Things
that are most important,

2417
02:18:09,460 --> 02:18:12,760
patches, patches, patches on good job life

2418
02:18:14,320 --> 02:18:16,300
at the, at the lower tactical level,

2419
02:18:16,690 --> 02:18:19,630
this may mean using fire maneuver
to take out machine gun position.

2420
02:18:19,631 --> 02:18:22,180
That is backbone event. That is
the backbone of enemy defenses.

2421
02:18:22,510 --> 02:18:27,010
It may mean using a gap in the enemy's
field of fire that allows us to get into

2422
02:18:27,011 --> 02:18:28,960
his rear, get to the rear of his position.

2423
02:18:29,110 --> 02:18:33,100
It may mean exploiting the enemy's lack
of air defenses by calling in close air

2424
02:18:33,101 --> 02:18:38,050
support. It may mean taking advantage of
an enemy's lack of mobility by rapidly

2425
02:18:38,530 --> 02:18:40,600
overrunning a key position
fashion that you can respond.

2426
02:18:40,900 --> 02:18:43,300
It made me an interdicting
enemy. Re Re supply routes.

2427
02:18:43,300 --> 02:18:44,620
When his supplies are running short,

2428
02:18:44,680 --> 02:18:49,420
they may mean exploiting a lack of long
range weapon tree by employing standoff

2429
02:18:49,421 --> 02:18:50,254
tactics.

2430
02:18:50,860 --> 02:18:54,850
When whatever we determined the
enemy's critical vulnerability to be,

2431
02:18:54,910 --> 02:18:57,520
we must be prepared to
rapidly take advantage of it

2432
02:18:59,530 --> 02:19:02,560
in the business world. That's,

2433
02:19:02,760 --> 02:19:06,670
that's something you should always be
paying attention to cause we got our

2434
02:19:06,671 --> 02:19:09,520
business and that's cool. We're going
to do our thing, but what where,

2435
02:19:09,710 --> 02:19:14,710
what weaknesses do those our competitor
have and are we ready to exploit those

2436
02:19:15,491 --> 02:19:16,324
weaknesses?

2437
02:19:17,200 --> 02:19:21,490
There is no formula for determining
critical vulnerabilities.

2438
02:19:21,730 --> 02:19:23,170
Each situation is different.

2439
02:19:23,320 --> 02:19:26,920
Critical vulnerabilities
will rarely be obvious.

2440
02:19:27,760 --> 02:19:27,870
Okay.

2441
02:19:27,870 --> 02:19:32,040
This is one of the things that make
mastery of tactics so difficult and one

2442
02:19:32,041 --> 02:19:34,950
reason that so few actions
achieve a decisive outcome.

2443
02:19:35,100 --> 02:19:39,060
Identifying critical vulnerabilities is
an important prerequisite to achieving a

2444
02:19:39,061 --> 02:19:39,894
decision

2445
02:19:42,220 --> 02:19:44,200
shaping the operating area.

2446
02:19:44,201 --> 02:19:48,460
Once we have developed an understanding
of the situation and have determined

2447
02:19:48,461 --> 02:19:50,590
enemy critical vulnerabilities to attack,

2448
02:19:50,740 --> 02:19:55,000
we try to shape the operating
area to our advantage.

2449
02:19:55,840 --> 02:20:00,160
Shaping includes both lethal and non
lethal activity such as planning fires to

2450
02:20:00,161 --> 02:20:03,220
fix the enemy using acts of
advanced to facilitate movement,

2451
02:20:03,460 --> 02:20:07,330
designating objectives to focus our combat
power or using deceptive measures to

2452
02:20:07,331 --> 02:20:09,400
reinforce enemy expectations.

2453
02:20:09,600 --> 02:20:14,600
I like that using deceptive measures
to reinforce enemy expectations because

2454
02:20:15,081 --> 02:20:17,320
they already have that idea,
we're just going to reinforce it.

2455
02:20:17,980 --> 02:20:21,070
Shaping activities can make
the enemy vulnerable to attack.

2456
02:20:21,071 --> 02:20:23,020
And Peter Divert his attempts to maneuver,

2457
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:26,950
facilitate the maneuver of friendly
forces and otherwise dictate the time and

2458
02:20:26,951 --> 02:20:31,630
place for decisive battle shaping forces
the enemy to adopt courses of action

2459
02:20:31,631 --> 02:20:32,980
favorable to us.

2460
02:20:33,160 --> 02:20:37,870
We attempt to shape events in a way that
allows us several options so that by

2461
02:20:37,871 --> 02:20:39,400
the time for the moment,

2462
02:20:40,090 --> 02:20:43,420
so that by the time the moment
for decisive action arrives,

2463
02:20:43,900 --> 02:20:47,860
we have not restricted ourselves
to only one course of action.

2464
02:20:49,140 --> 02:20:49,740
Okay.

2465
02:20:49,740 --> 02:20:52,650
Through shaping, we gain the
initiative, preserve momentum,

2466
02:20:52,800 --> 02:20:54,720
and controlled the temple combat. So yeah,

2467
02:20:55,150 --> 02:20:56,760
we got multiple things
that we're going to do.

2468
02:20:57,920 --> 02:20:58,470
Okay.

2469
02:20:58,470 --> 02:21:00,720
And we'll pick that course of
action when it develops. Yeah.

2470
02:21:00,750 --> 02:21:03,150
We haven't determined ahead of
time which one we're gonna use.

2471
02:21:03,180 --> 02:21:04,430
Is it going to be air power artillery?

2472
02:21:04,440 --> 02:21:06,240
We haven't actually
made that decision yet,

2473
02:21:06,270 --> 02:21:09,660
but we're going to do things that will
reveal their vulnerability and then I'm

2474
02:21:09,780 --> 02:21:11,340
gonna apply whatever
that is to crush them.

2475
02:21:11,580 --> 02:21:15,960
Now some people might be wondering in a
day to day or in a business environment

2476
02:21:15,961 --> 02:21:18,900
or in life, what is it? What are we
talking about? Shaping operations,

2477
02:21:18,960 --> 02:21:23,960
and this is a very clear
translation of what this means,

2478
02:21:25,140 --> 02:21:30,140
how you shape operations in the
business world and in and in your life.

2479
02:21:30,900 --> 02:21:34,590
What shaping operations means is that
you're out building relationships with the

2480
02:21:34,591 --> 02:21:37,170
other human beings that you're
going to be working with.

2481
02:21:38,400 --> 02:21:38,870
[inaudible]

2482
02:21:38,870 --> 02:21:43,010
that's what it means.
We build up alliances,

2483
02:21:43,130 --> 02:21:44,540
we build up trust,

2484
02:21:44,541 --> 02:21:49,541
we build up relationships so that
when the things start to unfold,

2485
02:21:49,821 --> 02:21:52,910
we know who we can count
on, we know where we stand.

2486
02:21:53,570 --> 02:21:54,403
Yeah.

2487
02:21:54,810 --> 02:21:59,810
And also recognizing they might be the
one that delivers the most critical

2488
02:22:00,820 --> 02:22:04,200
event, the most critical action. They
might be the one that at the right time,

2489
02:22:04,470 --> 02:22:08,040
at the most critical moment, do the
thing we need them to do. Absolutely.

2490
02:22:08,041 --> 02:22:11,340
And if your plan is wait for that moment
to start building that relationship,

2491
02:22:11,670 --> 02:22:14,820
it's, it won't work there.
If that's not how it works,

2492
02:22:14,821 --> 02:22:18,060
you have to go back in time and you have
to build that with the anticipation and

2493
02:22:18,061 --> 02:22:20,790
not even knowing which one
it's going to be at that time,

2494
02:22:21,450 --> 02:22:24,060
but their relationship has to be
available. Then you realize it's here.

2495
02:22:24,090 --> 02:22:26,010
We need to do this now,
and they're onboard.

2496
02:22:29,480 --> 02:22:30,200
Main effort.

2497
02:22:30,200 --> 02:22:34,460
The main effort is the central maneuver
is a central maneuver warfare concept.

2498
02:22:34,461 --> 02:22:37,610
Concentrating efforts on achieving
objectives that lead to victory.

2499
02:22:38,640 --> 02:22:38,960
Yeah.

2500
02:22:38,960 --> 02:22:41,510
Of all the actions going
on within our command,

2501
02:22:41,511 --> 02:22:45,680
we recognize one as the most
critical to success at that moment.

2502
02:22:45,800 --> 02:22:48,560
The unit assigned responsibility for
accomplishing this key mission is

2503
02:22:48,561 --> 02:22:49,790
designated as the main effort,

2504
02:22:50,120 --> 02:22:55,120
the focal point upon which converges
the combat power of the force.

2505
02:22:55,500 --> 02:22:56,333
Okay.

2506
02:22:57,080 --> 02:23:01,370
The main effort receives priority
for support of any kind. It must be.

2507
02:23:01,430 --> 02:23:02,660
So you've got to look at
your life and say like,

2508
02:23:02,661 --> 02:23:04,370
what's your main effort
in your life? Right.

2509
02:23:04,430 --> 02:23:07,370
And you got to make sacrifices in other
areas that aren't as important in that

2510
02:23:07,371 --> 02:23:08,204
particular time.

2511
02:23:09,050 --> 02:23:11,570
And they're going to talk about this to
your main African change. Like it can,

2512
02:23:11,700 --> 02:23:14,180
you can adapt. Hey, my main effort right
now, I'm focusing on this thing. Oh,

2513
02:23:14,181 --> 02:23:16,910
that change. You know,
I was finishing a book.

2514
02:23:17,900 --> 02:23:18,280
Yeah.

2515
02:23:18,280 --> 02:23:22,790
I was finishing a book and guess what?
That was my main effort for like, uh,

2516
02:23:23,020 --> 02:23:26,080
you know, oh, I actually, it was
the main effort when I was editing.

2517
02:23:26,560 --> 02:23:31,090
So you get edits back from
your, from your, uh, editor,

2518
02:23:31,240 --> 02:23:36,040
right. And they've got little ideas.
There's a time frame that that's doing.

2519
02:23:36,220 --> 02:23:38,890
So I've got, you know,
whatever 80,000 word book,

2520
02:23:39,630 --> 02:23:40,451
it's when I'm writing the book,

2521
02:23:40,451 --> 02:23:43,510
it's not the main effort because
it's just part of what I'm doing.

2522
02:23:43,540 --> 02:23:45,520
It's an hour a day, it's a
thousand words a day. Boom.

2523
02:23:45,521 --> 02:23:48,550
I look up in three months and
I've got 80,000 words. Good. Okay.

2524
02:23:48,551 --> 02:23:49,420
There wasn't a main effort.

2525
02:23:49,840 --> 02:23:54,840
Then all of a sudden I get back my edits
from my editor and now I've got to in,

2526
02:23:55,871 --> 02:24:00,340
that's due in six days. That becomes
my main effort. 100% because I can't,

2527
02:24:00,341 --> 02:24:03,310
I don't have time. It's gonna take
like three, four hours a day to do the,

2528
02:24:03,340 --> 02:24:06,160
to do those edits. So it
has to be the main effort.

2529
02:24:06,370 --> 02:24:08,440
So your main effort can
change in your life,

2530
02:24:08,860 --> 02:24:11,380
but what you do is you
sacrifice other things.

2531
02:24:11,440 --> 02:24:14,560
Like during that time period I was
kind of lucky cause I hurt my knee,

2532
02:24:14,840 --> 02:24:17,770
come from beautifully hurt my knee,
couldn't train Jujitsu. I was like cool,

2533
02:24:18,190 --> 02:24:22,270
there's that editing needs to get done.
Did it? So your, your main effort can,

2534
02:24:22,690 --> 02:24:25,000
can change and adapt. And the same
thing happens on the battlefield.

2535
02:24:26,010 --> 02:24:26,843
Yeah.

2536
02:24:27,750 --> 02:24:30,000
Faced with a decision, we ask ourselves,

2537
02:24:30,030 --> 02:24:33,540
how can I best support the main effort?

2538
02:24:34,730 --> 02:24:35,140
Okay,

2539
02:24:35,140 --> 02:24:37,810
so the main effort receives
priority for support of any kind.

2540
02:24:37,811 --> 02:24:41,530
It must be clear to all of the units in
the command that they must support that

2541
02:24:41,531 --> 02:24:43,090
unit in the accomplishment of the mission.

2542
02:24:43,510 --> 02:24:47,140
The main effort becomes a harmonizing
force for subordinates initiative.

2543
02:24:47,350 --> 02:24:51,160
Faced with a decision we ask ourselves,
how can I best support the main effort?

2544
02:24:52,090 --> 02:24:53,740
And if you want to be a good,

2545
02:24:53,800 --> 02:24:56,380
if you want to create a good
reputation for yourself as a,

2546
02:24:56,560 --> 02:25:00,100
as a leader and as a human being,
when you're not the main effort,

2547
02:25:00,130 --> 02:25:03,100
instead of complaining and worried
that you don't have the spotlight,

2548
02:25:03,490 --> 02:25:05,350
what you do use, you look at the person
that's the supporting effort. You say,

2549
02:25:05,351 --> 02:25:07,480
how can I help you win? Yeah.

2550
02:25:08,760 --> 02:25:09,140
Okay.

2551
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:11,900
A good leader says when they
recognize somebody else's,

2552
02:25:11,960 --> 02:25:15,350
the main effort is what can I do to help
and all the time we see it where when

2553
02:25:15,351 --> 02:25:17,600
you're not the main effort, you
know what the bad leaders do.

2554
02:25:17,960 --> 02:25:21,500
They complain that they're not the main
effort and they argue and they fight and

2555
02:25:21,501 --> 02:25:24,850
they stamp their foot to say, I
should be main effort and even worse,

2556
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:28,270
they undermine the main shirt because
they want to see the main effort fail.

2557
02:25:28,720 --> 02:25:30,970
Dave shouldn't had this.
I'm going to undermine Dave.

2558
02:25:30,971 --> 02:25:33,670
Watch him fail and then
I'll get the leg up. Yeah.

2559
02:25:33,790 --> 02:25:36,880
How does that help you in the long run?
Oh wait, it does. Oh, that's right.

2560
02:25:37,060 --> 02:25:38,110
Because you're playing the short game.

2561
02:25:39,580 --> 02:25:42,770
Some actions may support the main
effort indirectly. For example,

2562
02:25:42,771 --> 02:25:46,390
a commander may use other
forces to deceive the enemy
as to the location of the

2563
02:25:46,391 --> 02:25:46,931
main effort.

2564
02:25:46,931 --> 02:25:51,220
Marine forces used this
concept extensively and
conducting a series of combined

2565
02:25:51,221 --> 02:25:54,100
arms rates prior to the ground
offensive and Operation Desert Storm.

2566
02:25:54,101 --> 02:25:58,630
The raids were to confuse the Iraqis as
to the true position and intention of

2567
02:25:58,631 --> 02:25:59,500
allied forces.

2568
02:25:59,680 --> 02:26:03,130
The raid force appeared in the middle of
the night and fired from positions the

2569
02:26:03,131 --> 02:26:06,070
enemy had every right to
believe were unoccupied.

2570
02:26:06,400 --> 02:26:10,090
Use of a main effort implies
the use of economy of force.

2571
02:26:10,450 --> 02:26:15,450
This term does not mean that we use as
little force as we think we can get away

2572
02:26:15,881 --> 02:26:16,714
with.

2573
02:26:17,540 --> 02:26:17,960
Okay.

2574
02:26:17,960 --> 02:26:18,381
Rather,

2575
02:26:18,381 --> 02:26:23,381
it means that we must not fail to make
effective use of all the assets available

2576
02:26:23,451 --> 02:26:24,020
to us.

2577
02:26:24,020 --> 02:26:28,430
Forces not in a position to directly
support the main effort should be used to

2578
02:26:28,550 --> 02:26:29,960
indirectly support it.

2579
02:26:30,560 --> 02:26:33,740
Such forces might be used to distract
the enemy or tie down enemy forces that

2580
02:26:33,741 --> 02:26:36,530
might otherwise reinforce
the threatened point.

2581
02:26:37,350 --> 02:26:40,550
Uncommitted forces can be used in this
effort by maneuvering them in faints and

2582
02:26:40,551 --> 02:26:42,650
demonstrations that keep
the enemy off balance.

2583
02:26:44,130 --> 02:26:44,390
Okay,

2584
02:26:44,390 --> 02:26:48,050
and this is something that I think you
mentioned earlier is like, oh yeah,

2585
02:26:48,540 --> 02:26:51,530
like the the person that's not the
main effort has a huge impact on what's

2586
02:26:51,531 --> 02:26:52,364
happening.

2587
02:26:53,640 --> 02:26:56,760
So just because you're not the main
effort doesn't mean you shouldn't do

2588
02:26:56,761 --> 02:26:59,370
everything in your power
to support the main effort.

2589
02:27:00,180 --> 02:27:02,370
While a commander always
designates a main effort,

2590
02:27:02,371 --> 02:27:03,990
it may shift during the course of battles.

2591
02:27:03,991 --> 02:27:06,960
Events unfold because events
and the enemy are unpredictable.

2592
02:27:06,961 --> 02:27:11,010
Few battles flow exactly as the
commander is planned. Isn't that funny?

2593
02:27:11,050 --> 02:27:15,000
Few battles flow exactly as the
commander is planned. As a result,

2594
02:27:15,001 --> 02:27:16,530
the commander must make adjustments.

2595
02:27:18,120 --> 02:27:20,640
How often do I see a commander,

2596
02:27:20,760 --> 02:27:24,480
a leader have their plan in their head
and that's what they're sticking to.

2597
02:27:25,760 --> 02:27:27,060
Yeah, we see it all the time.

2598
02:27:27,210 --> 02:27:31,110
I'm sticking to the plan
and yet few battles flow.

2599
02:27:31,111 --> 02:27:35,010
Exactly as the commander you, it's
okay. It's by definition is missing.

2600
02:27:35,400 --> 02:27:38,790
You should not stick with your plans
because it's going to change. Yes.

2601
02:27:41,360 --> 02:27:43,910
One way is by re-designated
the main effort. For example,

2602
02:27:43,911 --> 02:27:46,760
if a company is designated as the
main effort but runs into heavy enemy

2603
02:27:46,761 --> 02:27:48,020
resistance while adjacent,

2604
02:27:48,021 --> 02:27:51,500
company B makes a breakthrough that as
exploits a critical vulnerability that

2605
02:27:51,501 --> 02:27:53,870
battalion commander may designate
company B as the main effort.

2606
02:27:54,380 --> 02:27:57,920
This new designation of company B
as a main effort must not however,

2607
02:27:57,921 --> 02:28:02,780
be merely nominal. It means
that the combat power,

2608
02:28:02,840 --> 02:28:07,840
which was supporting company
a now shifts to company B.

2609
02:28:08,710 --> 02:28:08,710
Identifying

2610
02:28:08,710 --> 02:28:12,340
the main effort is the principle and
most important answer to the question,

2611
02:28:12,490 --> 02:28:14,500
how do we achieve a decision?

2612
02:28:17,290 --> 02:28:17,890
Bold

2613
02:28:17,890 --> 02:28:21,710
boldness and ruthlessness. You wanna
know how you achieve a decision.

2614
02:28:21,711 --> 02:28:22,544
Here's how you do it.

2615
02:28:22,670 --> 02:28:27,530
Forcing a successful decision requires
the commander to be bold and ruthless.

2616
02:28:27,770 --> 02:28:32,060
Boldness refers to daring and
aggressiveness in behavior.

2617
02:28:32,240 --> 02:28:35,750
It is one of the basic requirements
for achieving clearcut outcomes.

2618
02:28:36,080 --> 02:28:39,470
In order to try for victory
must dare to try for victory.

2619
02:28:39,710 --> 02:28:44,710
We must have a desire to win big even if
we realize that in many situations that

2620
02:28:45,351 --> 02:28:47,360
conditions for victory
may not yet be present.

2621
02:28:47,930 --> 02:28:52,250
Ruthlessness refers to pursuing the
established goal mercilessly and

2622
02:28:53,300 --> 02:28:57,020
singlemindedly this doubly
important. This is doubly important.

2623
02:28:57,021 --> 02:28:59,870
Once we gain an advantage,
once we have an advantage,

2624
02:29:00,050 --> 02:29:02,840
we should exploit it to the
fullest. We should not ease up,

2625
02:29:02,841 --> 02:29:04,580
but instead increase the pressure.

2626
02:29:04,720 --> 02:29:08,210
Victory in combat is really your
product of it, of the initial plan,

2627
02:29:08,420 --> 02:29:11,810
but rather of ruthlessly
exploiting any advantage,

2628
02:29:11,811 --> 02:29:14,720
no matter how small until it succeeds.

2629
02:29:17,570 --> 02:29:19,670
And that's where a lot of
people want to stop listening.

2630
02:29:20,480 --> 02:29:20,740
Okay?

2631
02:29:20,740 --> 02:29:24,940
Just that, that cause that sounds
so fired up that they think cool,

2632
02:29:25,500 --> 02:29:28,210
bold and ruthless. That's
[inaudible] from now on.

2633
02:29:29,440 --> 02:29:31,450
And then we get into the dichotomy.

2634
02:29:31,720 --> 02:29:36,720
Bold and ruthless boldness and ruthless
ruthlessness must be accompanied by

2635
02:29:37,810 --> 02:29:41,620
strong leadership and
tempered by sound judgment.

2636
02:29:42,250 --> 02:29:42,800
Yeah.

2637
02:29:42,800 --> 02:29:44,330
Without these qualities,

2638
02:29:44,450 --> 02:29:49,450
boldness can become a recklessness
and ruthlessness can be distorted into

2639
02:29:50,270 --> 02:29:51,103
cruelty.

2640
02:29:52,630 --> 02:29:53,190
Okay.

2641
02:29:53,190 --> 02:29:58,080
So yes, there is a dichotomy
in every aspect of leadership.

2642
02:29:58,490 --> 02:30:00,870
And if you go too far in
one direction or the other,

2643
02:30:01,620 --> 02:30:03,720
you will fall apart and fail.

2644
02:30:04,950 --> 02:30:05,410
Okay.

2645
02:30:05,410 --> 02:30:09,580
Can you have, can you have
too much sound judgment?

2646
02:30:10,180 --> 02:30:13,810
Oh yes you can. You can sit there and
wait to make the perfect judgment.

2647
02:30:14,580 --> 02:30:15,060
Yeah.

2648
02:30:15,060 --> 02:30:19,880
That, that, that's, that's what's
gotta be balanced. So be careful.

2649
02:30:20,780 --> 02:30:21,613
Conclusion.

2650
02:30:22,810 --> 02:30:23,080
Okay.

2651
02:30:23,080 --> 02:30:27,610
As marine leaders, whether of fire teams
or of a Marine Expeditionary Force,

2652
02:30:27,611 --> 02:30:31,210
we are responsible for achieving
success. As you pointed out earlier,

2653
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:34,630
what are you gonna get graded
on? How if you're successful,

2654
02:30:35,110 --> 02:30:39,460
that's how we're grading you. We
don't care how you did it in combat.

2655
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:42,610
The success we seek is victory,

2656
02:30:42,820 --> 02:30:47,410
not merely a partial or marginal outcome
that first stalls the final reckoning,

2657
02:30:47,590 --> 02:30:51,370
but a victory that settles
the issue in our favor.

2658
02:30:52,250 --> 02:30:52,510
Yeah.

2659
02:30:52,510 --> 02:30:53,291
To be victorious.

2660
02:30:53,291 --> 02:30:58,150
We must work ceaselessly in peace time
to develop in ourselves a talent for

2661
02:30:58,151 --> 02:31:02,710
military judgment. The ability to
understand a situation and act decisively.

2662
02:31:02,860 --> 02:31:07,180
Military judgment results from
the wisdom gained from experience.

2663
02:31:07,270 --> 02:31:11,680
It allows us to identify patterns of
activity and to concentrate our efforts

2664
02:31:11,710 --> 02:31:16,120
against a critical vulnerability
that will bend the enemy to our will.

2665
02:31:17,580 --> 02:31:20,010
We must sharpen our
ability to make decisions

2666
02:31:20,010 --> 02:31:24,180
intuitively based on our
understanding of the situation.

2667
02:31:26,180 --> 02:31:29,090
Boom. So we just did two chapters.

2668
02:31:29,620 --> 02:31:32,270
I've thought we were going to
get through three, but we did.

2669
02:31:34,850 --> 02:31:39,020
So we'll, we'll hit the other five.

2670
02:31:39,410 --> 02:31:42,530
What is there? Eight, nine?
No, there's eight chapters.

2671
02:31:42,620 --> 02:31:44,690
There's eight chapters in
this book we got through to,

2672
02:31:45,860 --> 02:31:49,460
we'll do the next two on the next one. Um,

2673
02:31:51,530 --> 02:31:56,530
all kinds of things that sort
of lessons learned inside this.

2674
02:31:57,530 --> 02:31:58,363
Okay.

2675
02:31:58,920 --> 02:32:02,830
And, and you know, we covered that
part. That was about stacking.

2676
02:32:03,970 --> 02:32:04,500
Okay.

2677
02:32:04,500 --> 02:32:08,580
The deck in your favorite
skilled commander seeks
victory from the situation.

2678
02:32:09,000 --> 02:32:11,520
That's what we're trying to do. We're
trying to stack the deck in our favor.

2679
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:14,250
I'm trying to be ready,
trying to be prepared.

2680
02:32:15,240 --> 02:32:16,073
Okay.

2681
02:32:18,020 --> 02:32:22,370
Not just for combat obviously,
but for life, for business,

2682
02:32:22,520 --> 02:32:24,080
for family.

2683
02:32:27,610 --> 02:32:28,070
[inaudible]

2684
02:32:28,070 --> 02:32:29,600
any recommendations from you Dave?

2685
02:32:31,220 --> 02:32:35,690
I do have some recommendations
on being prepared and yeah,

2686
02:32:36,350 --> 02:32:40,280
combat for sure. Business for sure. Uh,

2687
02:32:40,610 --> 02:32:44,510
and in life for sure. Um,

2688
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:46,410
okay.

2689
02:32:46,410 --> 02:32:51,330
Origin USA. Origin.

2690
02:32:51,960 --> 02:32:53,640
Main. Open to Farmington. So

2691
02:32:55,440 --> 02:33:00,270
you started Jujitsu how long ago?
Just over a year ago. That really,

2692
02:33:00,271 --> 02:33:03,630
it's only been a year, probably
a year and four months I guess.

2693
02:33:04,140 --> 02:33:08,930
So just not maybe about two months
before the origin camp. Okay.

2694
02:33:09,150 --> 02:33:12,420
Last year. Got It. Which
is coming up next month.

2695
02:33:12,480 --> 02:33:17,480
How often do you overlay what you see
in Jujitsu over everything else that

2696
02:33:17,851 --> 02:33:18,690
you're doing in your life?

2697
02:33:19,520 --> 02:33:19,990
Okay.

2698
02:33:19,990 --> 02:33:20,823
All the time.

2699
02:33:21,140 --> 02:33:26,140
Now I'm always a little cautious about
talking about it because you're an

2700
02:33:26,860 --> 02:33:28,570
experienced, I'm an experienced. Um,

2701
02:33:29,050 --> 02:33:31,810
but if you're asking me how often I
think about it and how often I make the

2702
02:33:31,811 --> 02:33:34,390
connection to it, it's,
and I say all the time,

2703
02:33:34,391 --> 02:33:37,960
I mean it all the time and now
there's another layer to that.

2704
02:33:38,410 --> 02:33:42,720
So I've got my kids started on Jujitsu
about probably about six months ago and

2705
02:33:42,730 --> 02:33:45,670
we had a little, we moved cross
country, there's a little gap in there,

2706
02:33:45,671 --> 02:33:49,470
but I got him set up pretty quickly here
and last week they actually did a week

2707
02:33:49,870 --> 02:33:54,870
long Jujitsu camp check where I'm
actually making my money now is how much

2708
02:33:56,531 --> 02:34:00,550
better I am at helping my kids starting
to figure things out because they're

2709
02:34:00,700 --> 02:34:04,300
doing the Jujitsu and I'm
actually starting to make
connections for them about

2710
02:34:05,020 --> 02:34:08,380
their lives and it look, they
don't see it all, they don't.

2711
02:34:08,890 --> 02:34:13,220
But the impact of that on my life goes
well beyond my personal life right now.

2712
02:34:13,221 --> 02:34:13,390
It's,

2713
02:34:13,390 --> 02:34:18,280
it's my kids and how impactful that is
and added to the long of regret in my

2714
02:34:18,281 --> 02:34:23,110
life. If I had started when I, when
I was six years old, like my son,

2715
02:34:23,630 --> 02:34:27,880
how different my life would be.
But um, it is, it is awesome man.

2716
02:34:28,150 --> 02:34:29,530
It's awesome. Yeah,

2717
02:34:29,590 --> 02:34:34,590
it's good to be able to discuss
things and be able to explain things.

2718
02:34:36,311 --> 02:34:40,870
You have this incredible
metaphor for everything. Yes.

2719
02:34:41,200 --> 02:34:45,100
If you get that Jujitsu won't, I
can't give my kids combat metaphors,

2720
02:34:45,820 --> 02:34:50,820
but I can give them Jujitsu metaphors
that they actually understand and I'm

2721
02:34:51,671 --> 02:34:55,360
amazed at how much more they understand
than I thought because how they're

2722
02:34:55,361 --> 02:34:58,870
young, that they understand things and
they understand things. And you know,

2723
02:34:58,871 --> 02:35:02,610
the other thing is you can explain things
to them that they might understand.

2724
02:35:02,630 --> 02:35:05,590
They don't, they don't understand it.
They understand it subconsciously.

2725
02:35:05,980 --> 02:35:10,720
And when you make it conscious for
them and they go, oh, oh, I see. Oh,

2726
02:35:10,721 --> 02:35:13,480
so I shouldn't just try
and stay in this position.

2727
02:35:13,481 --> 02:35:16,420
I should let that person move a little
bit. And look for an opening. Oh, okay.

2728
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:19,840
Kind of like when mom's telling me to
do something, I shouldn't just get,

2729
02:35:20,230 --> 02:35:23,710
just trying to hold position. I should
actually maneuver a little bit. Okay.

2730
02:35:23,711 --> 02:35:27,370
I get it. I get it. Oh, I should. I
should try and get in a good position.

2731
02:35:28,480 --> 02:35:33,450
Yeah. If you start Jujitsu, which you
absolutely should go to origin main,

2732
02:35:33,460 --> 02:35:36,160
you're going to need a
g, go to origin Maine,

2733
02:35:36,970 --> 02:35:41,200
get a a g for Jujitsu, get
a rash guard for Jujitsu,

2734
02:35:41,410 --> 02:35:44,620
get workout clothes, tee shirts,

2735
02:35:45,700 --> 02:35:49,840
get some jeans. We have
origin jeans now and

2736
02:35:51,700 --> 02:35:54,880
they're super, they're just super
comfortable and super kicked ass,

2737
02:35:55,150 --> 02:35:58,480
so get yourself some of
that. We have supplements,

2738
02:36:00,040 --> 02:36:03,940
joint warfare. I just got an
email yesterday from some,

2739
02:36:04,690 --> 02:36:05,530
somebody that said,

2740
02:36:06,010 --> 02:36:11,010
my mom wanted me to send you an email
to say thank you because she's 71 years

2741
02:36:13,841 --> 02:36:17,530
old and she's feeling awesome.

2742
02:36:18,550 --> 02:36:23,410
And I was like, all right, cool. Just
grandma's little again. So drone warfare,

2743
02:36:23,411 --> 02:36:27,220
Krill oil discipline, discipline, go.
I saw you take some discipline. Go.

2744
02:36:27,610 --> 02:36:30,430
Prior to us starting this
podcast, discipline go.

2745
02:36:30,640 --> 02:36:35,460
I might have developed a small addiction
to discipline and discipline go. Uh,

2746
02:36:35,700 --> 02:36:38,940
it's honestly the first supplement
that I've taken where I'm like, Eh,

2747
02:36:39,100 --> 02:36:44,020
we'll see that, that
it, it just works. This,

2748
02:36:44,021 --> 02:36:47,410
it works. And, uh, it's, I you,

2749
02:36:47,440 --> 02:36:51,310
so I travel a lot. I don't
get a ton of sleep, you know,

2750
02:36:51,311 --> 02:36:53,140
the lifestyle we live right
now. We're, we're, we're,

2751
02:36:53,230 --> 02:36:57,370
we're moving pretty aggressively and I
have to be in the game, man. I can't, I,

2752
02:36:57,880 --> 02:37:00,430
I can't show up and be like, Hey,
I'd love to give you my best today,

2753
02:37:00,431 --> 02:37:04,810
but I'm tired. That's not part
of the deal. And, um, you know,

2754
02:37:04,850 --> 02:37:08,560
you can go with the frontal assault power
through a method or you can actually

2755
02:37:08,680 --> 02:37:12,700
take, something's gonna help you out.
This stuff is legit, man. It is legit.

2756
02:37:12,701 --> 02:37:13,750
And yeah, I took it before this,

2757
02:37:13,930 --> 02:37:18,930
cause you know what I wanted to be in the
game and how much on the mock train is

2758
02:37:20,871 --> 02:37:23,440
the Burke family at this
point? So here's another,

2759
02:37:23,480 --> 02:37:26,300
I went to your house and like
open the book and I was like, oh,

2760
02:37:26,301 --> 02:37:28,400
this dude's got a problem.
So here's the thing, man,

2761
02:37:28,401 --> 02:37:31,430
is every time I think I'm on the train,
I'm like, man, I'm still on the train.

2762
02:37:31,431 --> 02:37:32,720
And I'm like, oh. And then the mint,

2763
02:37:32,721 --> 02:37:34,550
I'm like still on the mint
and then the peanut butter,

2764
02:37:35,810 --> 02:37:40,810
it actually took the strawberry milk to
make me realize what it really means to

2765
02:37:42,201 --> 02:37:46,660
be on the MOC train because I, you know,
and I, I keep a little low profile job.

2766
02:37:46,820 --> 02:37:48,920
Uh, you know, uh, echoes,

2767
02:37:49,010 --> 02:37:52,160
I'm not the key spokesperson
for [inaudible] Bro.

2768
02:37:52,161 --> 02:37:56,430
When we got strawberry Mulcair that
has a whole nother level man. Um,

2769
02:37:56,900 --> 02:38:00,110
and I was, you know, I did peanut butter
and like Ah, I kind of went back to,

2770
02:38:00,620 --> 02:38:05,150
I have not gotten off the strawberry
mold train yet. It is still just, it's,

2771
02:38:05,480 --> 02:38:08,660
it's so good and everybody in the house,
nobody wants the other stuff right now.

2772
02:38:08,661 --> 02:38:11,240
And I was, you know, I go back to this
stuff cause it's, it's good. I like,

2773
02:38:11,250 --> 02:38:15,530
I really liked the other
stuff but strawberry right
now is still at the top of

2774
02:38:15,531 --> 02:38:17,630
the list and it hasn't
moved for a while. Yeah.

2775
02:38:17,690 --> 02:38:20,780
I finally got off the strawberry
train. Cause you know,

2776
02:38:20,980 --> 02:38:25,730
cause I got it before everyone else
and then I was just so deep into it.

2777
02:38:25,731 --> 02:38:28,510
And plus I was the, I was on the
warrior kid, Strawberry Mobile.

2778
02:38:28,540 --> 02:38:31,670
That's where it started. So I
was already on that. So yeah,

2779
02:38:31,790 --> 02:38:35,330
maybe like a week ago
I was having a little,

2780
02:38:35,390 --> 02:38:40,390
little lunchtime hitter and I and I
had some peanut butter and so anyways,

2781
02:38:42,500 --> 02:38:46,070
hey, if you want to get some extra
protein in your life, check out the milk.

2782
02:38:46,850 --> 02:38:50,180
Any of those flavors are really delicious.
And we got warrior kid milk too,

2783
02:38:50,660 --> 02:38:52,490
which is awesome for your kids.

2784
02:38:52,580 --> 02:38:55,850
It's actually crazy that no one made it.

2785
02:38:56,360 --> 02:39:00,500
It's actually crazy that no one made
warrior kid milk before we did because

2786
02:39:00,890 --> 02:39:04,850
here, oh, you want your kids to drink
poison? That sounds like a good plan.

2787
02:39:05,300 --> 02:39:08,720
No one's feeding their kid poison except
for everyone that's feeding their kid

2788
02:39:08,721 --> 02:39:12,790
chocolate milk filled with sugar. No
one thought of it. Cool. I did. Well,

2789
02:39:12,820 --> 02:39:16,670
we'll just go as water can
Paulk you'll taste awesome.

2790
02:39:16,760 --> 02:39:18,830
Your kids are gonna love it. And
you've got Jocko white tea too.

2791
02:39:19,190 --> 02:39:23,930
You can even get the dry Pete tea bags
or you can get into can and you can crack

2792
02:39:23,931 --> 02:39:27,560
that open. And by the way, right now,
we're drinking, actually at this time,

2793
02:39:27,561 --> 02:39:29,710
the, or I'm drinking the,

2794
02:39:30,060 --> 02:39:33,950
the Jocko discipline
go in a can. And it's,

2795
02:39:35,690 --> 02:39:37,010
so here's the thing, same thing.

2796
02:39:37,011 --> 02:39:40,550
If you are a parent and you
know that [inaudible] exists,

2797
02:39:40,820 --> 02:39:44,540
you should not buy anything else because
it's not good for your kids. It's not.

2798
02:39:45,260 --> 02:39:50,260
I got the early sample of the go and
a can got to try that a couple about a

2799
02:39:50,480 --> 02:39:54,350
month ago. If you, when this
happens and you drink it,

2800
02:39:55,100 --> 02:39:59,540
there is no reason to ever
buy a carbonated beverage
or any other type again,

2801
02:40:00,070 --> 02:40:01,670
ever. You should not have the seven up.

2802
02:40:01,850 --> 02:40:04,880
You should never buy a seven up ever
again. No, you won't buy seven up.

2803
02:40:04,881 --> 02:40:06,980
You won't buy a red bull or
you won't buy a coke. You know,

2804
02:40:06,981 --> 02:40:10,040
you'll just buy this cause it's actually
good for you and it tastes awesome,

2805
02:40:10,041 --> 02:40:12,410
blah, blah, blah. All
right, cool. So that's that.

2806
02:40:13,170 --> 02:40:16,620
And also we do have a store
that's called Jocko store.

2807
02:40:17,160 --> 02:40:22,160
That is Jocko store.com and there we got
rash guards and tee shirts and hats and

2808
02:40:24,660 --> 02:40:27,690
in hoodies. You get some women's
gear too. By the way. My wife,

2809
02:40:27,720 --> 02:40:32,010
every article of clothing she now owns
has the origin logo on it like everyone

2810
02:40:32,011 --> 02:40:33,390
and now that we're out in the west coast,

2811
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:37,830
the winter deer winter gear here
is a Hoodie. Yeah, that's it. Sure.

2812
02:40:37,831 --> 02:40:42,780
And the women's hoodies are lightweight
Hoodie or we are still just regular

2813
02:40:42,781 --> 02:40:45,600
hoodies. No lightweight hoodies
yet. When he's still a little,

2814
02:40:45,780 --> 02:40:48,150
she doesn't do lightweight and says
she's cold. She puts on the Hoodie.

2815
02:40:48,180 --> 02:40:50,100
I'm a lightweight guy now.
I got, I got both hoodies.

2816
02:40:50,101 --> 02:40:53,280
I transitioned though like the medium
way or those? The lightweight one. Yup.

2817
02:40:53,430 --> 02:40:57,870
Which you were all echo that
put you on the spot. Yeah Bro.

2818
02:40:57,871 --> 02:41:00,600
How do you like that? Right in
front of me, he did as he wants to,

2819
02:41:00,750 --> 02:41:05,170
he is a valley. He will looking for some
validation that echo turtles. So yeah,

2820
02:41:05,340 --> 02:41:08,570
you can get all that stuff. You
can support the podcast Jocko,

2821
02:41:09,330 --> 02:41:12,180
store.com represent, what does echo say?

2822
02:41:12,300 --> 02:41:15,990
Represent while being on the
path. That's what he says.

2823
02:41:16,110 --> 02:41:20,640
He says it in like a um, sort
of a really super dramatic way.

2824
02:41:21,650 --> 02:41:21,820
Okay.

2825
02:41:21,820 --> 02:41:25,960
If you want to represent, sometimes
echo takes long pauses like I do,

2826
02:41:26,440 --> 02:41:28,240
but there's no sensibility to them.

2827
02:41:29,560 --> 02:41:34,110
They'll just say if you want to
represent wall, you're on the path.

2828
02:41:35,930 --> 02:41:40,160
But Hey, that's my brother. I called
Charles a m we have this podcast,

2829

you subscribe to. Podcasts,

kid podcast Dave. Good.

2831
02:41:48,891 --> 02:41:51,600
Three more just came out a couple
of weeks ago. Yeah, burn through.

2832
02:41:51,601 --> 02:41:56,450
My kids were so fired up because I had
episode 14 on repeat in the car cause

2833
02:41:56,451 --> 02:41:57,020
they will listen.

2834
02:41:57,020 --> 02:42:00,020
Literally listened to those storied
pot podcasts over and over again.

2835
02:42:00,021 --> 02:42:00,854
Even if they'd heard them.

2836
02:42:01,400 --> 02:42:04,010
And we just got through three new ones
in the last week and they were fired up

2837
02:42:05,390 --> 02:42:07,310
the stories from Uncle Jake.

2838
02:42:08,910 --> 02:42:09,743
Okay.

2839
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:10,753
So good. We,

2840
02:42:10,850 --> 02:42:15,850
the one we just did it just just today
was the kid had the car and the two other

2841
02:42:18,231 --> 02:42:21,200
kids wanted that radio controlled
car, but it was expensive and they,

2842
02:42:21,350 --> 02:42:25,040
there's two paths down to getting that
car and one which was a little discipline

2843
02:42:25,041 --> 02:42:27,770
with your money, save your money, save
a little bit here, a little bit there.

2844
02:42:27,771 --> 02:42:28,820
And at the end you know what you get,

2845
02:42:29,540 --> 02:42:34,460
you get the thing that you want and his
other kid and you use an example of ice

2846
02:42:34,461 --> 02:42:36,230
cream on Fridays at school for a dollar.

2847
02:42:36,320 --> 02:42:41,000
That literally is exactly what my kids
get from realizing said yes and they saw

2848
02:42:41,001 --> 02:42:45,080
that little delayed
gratification. Yeah. Kids, kids,

2849
02:42:45,170 --> 02:42:48,440
kids understand that man. I know
they're young, but they, these stories,

2850
02:42:48,441 --> 02:42:51,300
they make sense to them. They
internalize it, they understand it.

2851
02:42:51,301 --> 02:42:53,660
They're not too young to
figure out these life lessons,

2852
02:42:53,870 --> 02:42:58,630
the classic parables of life that
every kid, you just wish and,

2853
02:42:58,680 --> 02:43:03,680
and I think they get so ingrained with
the kids when they hear these stories,

2854
02:43:03,820 --> 02:43:06,650
they're so relatable and they
go, oh yeah, it's, it's like,

2855
02:43:07,400 --> 02:43:12,160
it's like embedded in them now. They
understood. They truly understand

2856
02:43:12,900 --> 02:43:15,910
would that it that you have to delay
gratification sometimes. For example,

2857
02:43:16,300 --> 02:43:18,280
they truly understand that you
have to make the right decisions.

2858
02:43:18,340 --> 02:43:20,350
They truly understand that the
world doesn't sound around them.

2859
02:43:20,440 --> 02:43:24,310
They truly understand that you have
to work the embeds in their brains.

2860
02:43:24,910 --> 02:43:28,960

2868
02:43:59,620 --> 02:44:02,320
Do you think echo goes overboard
from time to time? Yes, I do.

2869
02:44:03,010 --> 02:44:05,590
I absolutely get out of
balance every now and then.

2870
02:44:06,190 --> 02:44:09,400
How many explosions
can there be? You know,

2871

2876
02:44:28,600 --> 02:44:32,740
which not everyone has time to do.

little short statements from me.

2879

and you can get that as well.
Got Some books. Yeah. Yeah.

2895
02:45:45,880 --> 02:45:50,470
Another thing that's on repeat in
my house are the warrior kid books,

2896
02:45:51,130 --> 02:45:53,080
so yeah, he knows there's,

2897
02:45:53,110 --> 02:45:55,810
there's three of them out there way of
the warrior kid and Mark's mission or

2898
02:45:55,811 --> 02:45:58,090
your kid three is out there
at where there's a will.

2899
02:45:58,450 --> 02:46:01,450
That book has been read
repeatedly. I get to the end,

2900
02:46:01,451 --> 02:46:04,900
we go back to the beginning every now
and there'll be a detour back to one of

2901
02:46:04,901 --> 02:46:06,220
the other books, one or two,

2902
02:46:06,250 --> 02:46:10,400
but right now three is on repeat
into the three kids. Those books are

2903
02:46:10,790 --> 02:46:15,080
are legit and even Mikey and
the dragons. Even that book,

2904
02:46:15,110 --> 02:46:18,680
even though it's for younger kids,
another book that my kids love,

2905
02:46:18,681 --> 02:46:20,390
not just because they
can read it themselves,

2906
02:46:21,130 --> 02:46:26,120
but because the actually understand the
message of the story. It's so legit.

2907
02:46:26,121 --> 02:46:28,970
Those books. Those books are awesome.
And those books are our must,

2908
02:46:29,030 --> 02:46:33,380
not just for the kids, but for the parents
who are reading a man. We've got the,

2909
02:46:33,580 --> 02:46:37,160
uh, the discipline equals freedom field
manual. If you want to check that out,

2910
02:46:37,250 --> 02:46:41,570
it's one of it's, it's a book that
people take pictures of the book,

2911
02:46:42,440 --> 02:46:47,300
like they'd take pictures of the
book. Yeah. And I'll tell you,

2912
02:46:47,301 --> 02:46:50,030
let me tell you a little something about
this book. I'll tell you, you know,

2913
02:46:50,240 --> 02:46:52,460
have you ever heard me talk
smack about my publisher before?

2914
02:46:53,330 --> 02:46:56,630
Your current publisher? My
current publisher? Yeah.
Yeah. So yeah, yeah, yeah.

2915
02:46:56,630 --> 02:46:59,030
So occasionally I do that. Here's
one example of me doing that.

2916
02:46:59,031 --> 02:47:03,910
So inside when you open
it up, they give the, uh,

2917
02:47:04,370 --> 02:47:09,370
they give the credit to the design cover
design and they get like somebody that

2918
02:47:11,661 --> 02:47:13,940
works there and I'm sure
they did, they hooked it up.

2919
02:47:13,941 --> 02:47:16,700
But like I sent him this
picture and said, okay,

2920
02:47:16,701 --> 02:47:20,570
this is what it's going
to look like. So it's a,

2921
02:47:20,600 --> 02:47:24,710
but they did do a great job
with it and it came out solid.

2922
02:47:24,770 --> 02:47:26,690
It has black pages.

2923
02:47:27,080 --> 02:47:32,050
They have to dye the edges
black. It's a black book dude.

2924
02:47:32,060 --> 02:47:33,620
It's called discipline of
course. Freedom field manual.

2925
02:47:33,770 --> 02:47:37,670
The publisher told me he was the biggest
risk he ever took with publishing a

2926
02:47:37,671 --> 02:47:41,480
book. Really? Yeah. He
said, he said, I said,

2927
02:47:41,481 --> 02:47:44,360
is this the riskiest book you've ever
cooked? He was, oh my God. Not even close.

2928
02:47:44,390 --> 02:47:47,960
Nothing's even close because there's no
preexisting book, anything like that.

2929
02:47:48,560 --> 02:47:53,560
So you're doing something completely
outside uncharted territory.

2930
02:47:54,860 --> 02:47:58,250
I hope it worked out for him. It worked
out well for them. It worked out well.

2931
02:47:58,610 --> 02:48:01,010
It actually worked out awesome and I
appreciate everyone checking that out.

2932
02:48:01,100 --> 02:48:02,680
It's a book that you know what you want.

2933
02:48:02,750 --> 02:48:07,750
You see the big spike in sales
is toward a graduation time.

2934
02:48:08,780 --> 02:48:12,550
People get it for Elliot,
everyone's graduating school.
Oh, here you go. Here's,

2935
02:48:12,560 --> 02:48:14,840
here's what you should do now that you're
done with high school and get on the

2936
02:48:14,841 --> 02:48:18,260
path. So that's a, the freedom
discipline. It was freedom field manual.

2937
02:48:18,500 --> 02:48:22,190
The audio version of that is not
on audible. It's on MP3. So iTunes,

2938
02:48:22,191 --> 02:48:26,260
Amazon music, Google play, whatever.
And then extreme ownership. Dude,

2939
02:48:26,261 --> 02:48:30,020
the beginning man, a lot of
folks have read it. I know. Um,

2940
02:48:30,170 --> 02:48:35,170
so here's the thing about
extreme ownership has to be
read also good for younger

2941
02:48:35,390 --> 02:48:39,500
kids. I actually read part of that stuff
to my kids. They get it, but it's not,

2942
02:48:39,680 --> 02:48:44,270
it's not. Everything that, and
dichotomy together are art. They have,

2943
02:48:44,300 --> 02:48:46,800
they go together. You have to
read them both. Uh, they're,

2944
02:48:46,840 --> 02:48:47,673
they're critical and they,

2945
02:48:47,740 --> 02:48:50,480
it explains how actually even with
the lessons in that first one,

2946
02:48:50,481 --> 02:48:52,520
you can go too far on
any of those principles.

2947
02:48:52,521 --> 02:48:56,450
You can go too far and you gotta bring
dichotomy into that understanding of

2948
02:48:56,451 --> 02:49:01,340
extreme ownership. Lafe was telling
me maybe like a year ago, he goes,

2949
02:49:01,630 --> 02:49:04,310
Yo, I was just rereading
extreme ownership. He goes,

2950
02:49:04,370 --> 02:49:06,980
I've been like trying to
fake. He's, he's like, I just,

2951
02:49:07,030 --> 02:49:09,570
I was trying to figure out a way to say
something and then I read it and I was

2952
02:49:09,571 --> 02:49:13,250
like, oh wait, it's in there. Like the,
the actual answers in there. He's like,

2953
02:49:13,251 --> 02:49:16,770
I was trying to recreate a way or craft
a way to say something. He's like, man,

2954
02:49:16,771 --> 02:49:20,910
I forgot that I even wrote this section
or whatever. So yeah, check that out.

2955
02:49:21,750 --> 02:49:24,120
And what about echelon?
Front echelon front,

2956
02:49:26,250 --> 02:49:30,420
the good deal, Dave story continues
because I am, I'm part of that team now.

2957
02:49:31,280 --> 02:49:33,970
Uh, the, the lessons, all those
things we just talked about, uh,

2958
02:49:34,080 --> 02:49:37,750
not just on this podcast but
in those books, Jocko and, uh,

2959
02:49:38,100 --> 02:49:41,370
lave actually put together this company
that I'm a part of that takes all those

2960
02:49:41,371 --> 02:49:44,610
leadership principles and we
help companies solve problems.

2961
02:49:44,670 --> 02:49:48,240
Every problem is solved
through leadership. Everyone.

2962
02:49:48,600 --> 02:49:52,200
And I'm part of a team that is not
just carrying just a good message,

2963
02:49:52,201 --> 02:49:56,730
but a message that can actually impact
everybody's life. Business, personal,

2964
02:49:56,790 --> 02:49:59,840
every aspect of it. Uh,
obviously you and Lafe, uh,

2965
02:49:59,880 --> 02:50:04,170
putting this together came on board with
JP, uh, Flint cocker and Mike Sorelli,

2966
02:50:04,560 --> 02:50:07,620
Mike [inaudible], Jason Gardner.
The team has grown. Man,

2967
02:50:07,621 --> 02:50:11,340
I'm so stoked to be on this team with
those guys, man. It is, it is legit.

2968
02:50:11,940 --> 02:50:12,840
How about you if online,

2969
02:50:13,680 --> 02:50:17,520
if online is turned out to be even more
important of a resource than I thought

2970
02:50:17,700 --> 02:50:19,620
because one of the hardest
things we have to chat,

2971
02:50:19,830 --> 02:50:23,370
one of the hardest challenges we have
is when we leave a company is we want to

2972
02:50:23,371 --> 02:50:25,950
stay as connected to them as we can
and look you're not there everyday.

2973
02:50:26,220 --> 02:50:30,220
Oh you mean it's not like a rocky movie
or we just get Paul pumped up that

2974
02:50:30,330 --> 02:50:33,630
amazingly sometimes takes more training
than just just just the rocky movie.

2975
02:50:33,660 --> 02:50:36,270
Yeah. What it takes is reps,

2976
02:50:36,630 --> 02:50:38,890
hundreds and thousands
of reps and what he,

2977
02:50:38,900 --> 02:50:42,450
if online lets people do
is get reps, rep after rep,

2978
02:50:42,451 --> 02:50:46,170
after rep and that resource has proven,
I knew it was going to be important.

2979
02:50:46,200 --> 02:50:48,060
I didn't realize how
important it was going to be,

2980
02:50:48,180 --> 02:50:50,880
not just to reach folks that
can't spend time with us,

2981
02:50:51,120 --> 02:50:52,620
but even once they spend time with us,

2982
02:50:52,680 --> 02:50:56,550
what they need to do to reinforce the
things that we're talking about ETF online

2983
02:50:56,551 --> 02:50:59,400
is works in both directions. If
we're not working with you know,

2984
02:50:59,401 --> 02:51:01,440
factor it's there and if
we are working with you,

2985
02:51:01,930 --> 02:51:04,810
they are realizing how important that
is to stay connected to you. Man.

2986
02:51:04,840 --> 02:51:09,330
It's legit. And then the muster,

2987
02:51:10,950 --> 02:51:15,600
I like listening to you talk about this
stuff. What about the muster muster?

2988
02:51:16,230 --> 02:51:19,980
I probably said the word legit too many
times, but I'm going to say it again.

2989
02:51:20,640 --> 02:51:23,840
As a, as a leadership conference,
there's nothing like it. You,

2990
02:51:23,870 --> 02:51:28,870
you have said every single podcast
the muster is going to sell out.

2991
02:51:30,420 --> 02:51:34,450
And yet there are still people that
towards the end of signing up and we put

2992
02:51:34,670 --> 02:51:37,590
some ask if they can go. Not
only did the last one sell out,

2993
02:51:37,740 --> 02:51:40,740
we got Denver coming
up in September. It's,

2994
02:51:41,130 --> 02:51:43,950
it's almost sold out in September
and we're actually looking,

2995
02:51:43,951 --> 02:51:47,010
so we've got mustard in
September, uh, coming up in, um,

2996
02:51:47,490 --> 02:51:50,730
in Denver on September 19th
20th. We also have Sydney,

2997
02:51:51,270 --> 02:51:55,980
December 4th and fifth asked me how close
we are to selling out Sydney through

2998
02:51:56,490 --> 02:51:56,610
close.

2999
02:51:56,610 --> 02:51:59,970
We're going to sell at Sydney and our
first overseas muster in December 4th and

3000
02:51:59,971 --> 02:52:04,680
fifth. Uh, these events. Yeah. Do the
these are, these are the things that put,

3001
02:52:05,710 --> 02:52:05,980
these are

3002
02:52:05,980 --> 02:52:09,040
things that make the things we talk about.
They make them real, they make them.

3003
02:52:09,370 --> 02:52:13,660
So really you can take back from those
two days and have so much to go do for

3004
02:52:13,661 --> 02:52:16,630
yourself to make your life
in your company better. Uh,

3005
02:52:16,660 --> 02:52:21,010
there is not a better way to truly
understand what it is that we're teaching

3006
02:52:22,210 --> 02:52:23,043
than the master.

3007
02:52:23,110 --> 02:52:27,220
It is legit from beginning to end and
it is made huge impact on folks lives.

3008
02:52:27,221 --> 02:52:28,720
I can't tell you how many emails I get.

3009
02:52:28,930 --> 02:52:33,070
I get God only knows what you're getting
of what the muster meant to their life,

3010
02:52:33,190 --> 02:52:35,320
to their, to what it
did for, for their life.

3011
02:52:35,550 --> 02:52:37,930
They're all the next one
coming up in Denver in Denver.

3012
02:52:38,680 --> 02:52:41,770
Go while you're still can go,
you're also going to be close.

3013
02:52:42,100 --> 02:52:43,570
And then there's the f Overwatch,

3014
02:52:43,960 --> 02:52:47,890
which is where we're taking proven
leaders from special operations and from

3015
02:52:47,891 --> 02:52:52,891
combat aviation and we are placing
them into civilian companies that need

3016
02:52:53,921 --> 02:52:58,090
leadership. These guys are
tested, they are proven,

3017
02:52:58,240 --> 02:53:01,450
they've been in charge,
they've led people,

3018
02:53:01,600 --> 02:53:03,040
they've been under stress and pressure.

3019
02:53:03,550 --> 02:53:06,070
And now they're looking
for their next career.

3020
02:53:06,340 --> 02:53:09,340
Why not have their next
career be with you?

3021
02:53:09,520 --> 02:53:13,960
Taking the principles that we talk about
all the time and implementing them into

3022
02:53:13,961 --> 02:53:15,400
your organization.

3023
02:53:16,510 --> 02:53:17,343
Okay.

3024
02:53:18,180 --> 02:53:18,401
Yeah.

3025
02:53:18,401 --> 02:53:22,110
F overwatch.com if you want
to get involved with that
and if you want to discuss

3026
02:53:22,140 --> 02:53:26,190
any of these topics further, you can
actually find us on the interwebs,

3027
02:53:27,420 --> 02:53:32,030
on Twitter, on Instagram
and on Dine Foz in walking.

3028
02:53:33,360 --> 02:53:36,690
Dave is at David R. Burke,

3029
02:53:36,691 --> 02:53:41,190
B. E. R. K. E. N. I am at jockowillink.
Dave, any closing thoughts?

3030
02:53:41,940 --> 02:53:45,930
My closing thoughts is that I'm so stoked
that I'm here right now here on the

3031
02:53:45,931 --> 02:53:47,400
west coast and get to
be a part of this man.

3032
02:53:47,460 --> 02:53:52,460
Thank you Jack and to all you folks out
there in uniform that are executing the

3033
02:53:54,121 --> 02:53:57,900
tactics that we've been talking about
today in order to keep our country free.

3034
02:53:59,250 --> 02:53:59,911
Thank you.

3035
02:53:59,911 --> 02:54:04,911
And to our police and law enforcement
and firefighters and paramedics and mts

3036
02:54:05,460 --> 02:54:08,520
and dispatchers and correctional officers
in border patrol and secret service

3037
02:54:08,521 --> 02:54:10,100
and all first responders. You know, I, I,

3038
02:54:10,101 --> 02:54:13,530
I've heard a statement that when you
hear an ambulance or you hear a fire,

3039
02:54:13,531 --> 02:54:16,890
it's a reminder to you
that you know, you're,

3040
02:54:16,920 --> 02:54:18,480
someone's having a worse day than you.

3041
02:54:19,660 --> 02:54:19,930
Okay?

3042
02:54:19,930 --> 02:54:22,430
It, and that's certainly true, but
let me take it one step further.

3043
02:54:22,550 --> 02:54:25,910
Cause I actually don't think
that when I hear that siren,

3044
02:54:26,900 --> 02:54:30,650
I think about the people that are
responding, those firefighters,

3045
02:54:30,651 --> 02:54:34,070
those paramedics, those police,

3046
02:54:34,340 --> 02:54:36,350
and they're going to put
themselves into harms away.

3047
02:54:36,980 --> 02:54:37,280
Okay?

3048
02:54:37,280 --> 02:54:39,140
That's what I think about
when I hear those sirens.

3049
02:54:39,200 --> 02:54:42,590
So for those of you that
do those jobs for a living,

3050
02:54:42,740 --> 02:54:46,730
thank you for keeping our homeland
safe and to everyone else out there,

3051
02:54:47,640 --> 02:54:48,473
right?

3052
02:54:49,940 --> 02:54:54,590
You gotta remember we're at war and you
were at war and maybe not a war in the

3053
02:54:54,591 --> 02:54:59,591
classic sense of the word that you're
out there with a weapon and you're

3054
02:54:59,601 --> 02:55:01,880
fighting against a uniformed enemy,

3055
02:55:04,330 --> 02:55:07,960
but make no mistake, life ran.

3056
02:55:07,961 --> 02:55:11,830
I know this might sound harsh, but
life is war. It's a war against time.

3057
02:55:11,831 --> 02:55:14,590
It's a war against weakness.
It's a war against the ego.

3058
02:55:14,680 --> 02:55:19,680
It's a war against the most base
part of you as a human being.

3059
02:55:24,290 --> 02:55:27,740
So as the Marine Corps doctrine says,

3060
02:55:27,980 --> 02:55:32,150
actively and aggressively seek it
out, and when the opportunity arrives,

3061
02:55:32,210 --> 02:55:35,360
level every ounce of power you can muster,

3062
02:55:37,110 --> 02:55:37,943
pushing

3063
02:55:38,230 --> 02:55:40,080
beyond the limits of exhaustion

3064
02:55:41,510 --> 02:55:45,200
to achieve total victory.

3065
02:55:46,830 --> 02:55:47,380
Okay.

3066
02:55:47,380 --> 02:55:50,770
And until next time,
this is Jocko and Dave

3067
02:55:52,060 --> 02:55:52,360
out.
