00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
In this unit, we're going to talk about forms and how you get data

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
from your browser to a web server, and we're not going to spend a whole lot of time here

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
on the sketch pad today, but first things first.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
What I want you to do is open a text file in your editor of choice

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and put some text in it.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I'm in my editor here, and I'm just going to add some text, kind of standard text.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I save this file as play.html,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and the next thing I want you to do is open this file in your web browser of choice.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
What we have here is the text that I entered in the editor here in the browser,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and if we were to go back to the editor and change something--

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
we'll change our word here--save it and then go back to the browser and reload,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
you can see it live updates, so this is a handy way for kind of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
playing with and experimenting with HTML in a real browser,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and we're going to be doing a fair amount of this today.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
The first thing I want to teach you about is HTML forms

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
and the elements required to make them.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We have another tag called "form," and it looks like this.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And like many HTML tags, it has a closing form.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We're going to go back and forth here, between our editor and our browser

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
and here while I'm explaining things.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Let's enter this in our editor.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Here we are in our editor.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm going to replace this text with that basic HTML tag I just showed you,

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Okay, there we go.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
We're going to save this, and we're going to go back to our browser and reload the page.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Nothing is there. And why is that?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Because we didn't enter any content.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Let's talk about the content that goes in an HTML form.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
There are a few things that can go in here, one of which is an element called input,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
which looks like this.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Let's enter that in our HTML editor.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Okay, now we go back to our browser, and we reload this.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
A-ha.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Now we have an input box, and we can type things in this box.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Pretty cool, huh?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
The input tag can take a couple of attributes,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
one of which is called "name," and name looks like this.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
It's like all attributes.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
We have the actual attribute, which in this case is called "name,"

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and then the value, which I've written here in red.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.466
This can be whatever we want.
