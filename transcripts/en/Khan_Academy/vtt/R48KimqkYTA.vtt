00:00:00.372 --> 00:00:02.496
- [Voiceover] Lola asked her classmates

00:00:02.496 --> 00:00:05.735
their favorite type of movie
and graphed the results.

00:00:05.735 --> 00:00:09.717
All right so it says that 20 people

00:00:09.717 --> 00:00:12.132
said their favorite type
of movie was comedy.

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:15.197
Six people said their favorite
type of movie was scary.

00:00:15.197 --> 00:00:18.110
10 people said their favorite
type of movie was adventure.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.049
10 people also said their favorite

00:00:20.049 --> 00:00:21.814
type of movie is cartoons.

00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:23.671
And then 16 people said their favorite

00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:25.215
type of movie is a mystery.

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:27.096
All right, so let's
read the questions here.

00:00:27.096 --> 00:00:29.174
So which of the following types of movies

00:00:29.174 --> 00:00:32.018
were picked by fewer than 14 people?

00:00:32.018 --> 00:00:34.607
So fewer than 14 people.

00:00:34.607 --> 00:00:38.194
So more than 14 picked comedy or mystery.

00:00:38.194 --> 00:00:41.212
So this line right over here would be 14.

00:00:41.212 --> 00:00:44.649
So fewer than 14 were
scary, adventure, cartoon.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:46.936
This was six people, 10
people, and 10 people.

00:00:46.936 --> 00:00:49.629
Scary, adventure, and cartoon.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.164
So we wanna pick scary,
adventure, and cartoon.

00:00:54.164 --> 00:00:57.763
These three had less
than 14 people pick them.

00:00:57.763 --> 00:01:00.247
So let's do a couple more of these.

00:01:00.247 --> 00:01:02.261
Let's do a couple more.

00:01:05.444 --> 00:01:08.880
Puppy Party Place graphed
the number of dogs

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.656
that came in each weekday.

00:01:10.656 --> 00:01:13.303
So let's see, 80 dogs came in on Monday,

00:01:13.303 --> 00:01:17.215
160 dogs came in on Tuesday,
80 dogs came in on Wednesday.

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:19.699
140 dogs came in on Thursday,

00:01:19.699 --> 00:01:21.499
and then Friday was a very popular day,

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:25.260
180 dogs came in to the
Puppy Party Place on Friday.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.338
All right, so what are they asking us?

00:01:27.338 --> 00:01:29.741
On which day did the same number of dogs

00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:31.773
come to Puppy Party Place,

00:01:31.773 --> 00:01:35.012
as on Monday and Wednesday combined?

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:38.448
All right, so let's see,
Monday and Wednesday combined.

00:01:38.448 --> 00:01:43.288
So on Monday we had 80 puppies
come there, or 80 dogs.

00:01:43.288 --> 00:01:45.706
And on Wednesday we had 80 dogs.

00:01:45.706 --> 00:01:47.923
And they're saying which day had the same

00:01:47.923 --> 00:01:50.709
as Monday and Wednesday combined?

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.623
So Monday and Wednesday
combined would be 80

00:01:53.623 --> 00:01:56.711
plus 80, which would be 160.

00:01:56.711 --> 00:01:59.544
So on which of these
days did 160 dogs come?

00:01:59.544 --> 00:02:02.086
Well we see it right over here, 160 dogs,

00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:05.731
that was on Tuesday, and only on Tuesday.

00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:09.667
So Tuesday, let's do a few more of these.

00:02:12.728 --> 00:02:17.329
Dessert Zone asked its customers about

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.233
their favorite ice cream flavor,

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:20.997
and graphed the results.

00:02:20.997 --> 00:02:25.478
So 175 customers said
vanilla, 225 said chocolate,

00:02:27.693 --> 00:02:31.186
75 said strawberry, and
200 said cookie dough.

00:02:31.186 --> 00:02:33.496
All right, how many more customers picked

00:02:33.496 --> 00:02:36.561
the most popular flavor than
the least popular flavor?

00:02:36.561 --> 00:02:39.417
All right, so the most
popular flavor was chocolate,

00:02:39.417 --> 00:02:43.118
that was 225, and the
least popular flavor...

00:02:44.963 --> 00:02:49.099
To the least popular flavor,
it's a tongue twister, was 75.

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:51.405
So how many more picked the most popular

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:52.798
than the least popular?

00:02:52.798 --> 00:02:56.295
Well the most popular was
225, the least popular was 75.

00:02:56.295 --> 00:03:00.137
So what's 225 minus 75?

00:03:00.137 --> 00:03:03.539
Let's see, 225 minus 25 would be 200,

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:05.884
minus 50 would be 175.

00:03:05.884 --> 00:03:08.635
Minus 75 would be 150.

00:03:08.635 --> 00:03:11.978
So we get 150 customers.

00:03:11.978 --> 00:03:13.522
And once again, we're saying that

00:03:13.522 --> 00:03:16.355
150 more customers picked chocolate,

00:03:16.355 --> 00:03:19.559
the most popular flavor,
than the least popular.

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:21.080
Another way you could do it is you could

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.659
look at the least popular
and the most popular

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:23.878
and say well how many
more do I have to add

00:03:23.878 --> 00:03:26.397
to the least popular to
get to the most popular?

00:03:26.397 --> 00:03:30.959
And you see 25, 50, 75,

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.886
100, 125, 150.

00:03:34.886 --> 00:03:38.067
Each of these lines is 25 more.

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:41.085
So there you have it, 150 more customers

00:03:41.085 --> 00:03:43.988
liked the most popular flavor, chocolate,

00:03:43.988 --> 00:03:46.041
than the least popular flavor.
