00:00:06.657 --> 00:00:09.077
Here are two images of a house.

00:00:09.077 --> 00:00:11.347
There’s one obvious difference,

00:00:11.347 --> 00:00:13.807
but to this patient, P.S.,

00:00:13.807 --> 00:00:16.607
they looked completely identical.

00:00:16.607 --> 00:00:20.367
P.S. had suffered a stroke that 
damaged the right side of her brain,

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:24.017
leaving her unaware of everything 
on her left side.

00:00:24.017 --> 00:00:27.557
But though she could discern no difference
between the houses,

00:00:27.557 --> 00:00:30.947
when researchers asked her 
which she would prefer to live in,

00:00:30.947 --> 00:00:33.787
she chose the house that wasn’t burning—

00:00:33.787 --> 00:00:36.897
not once, but again and again.

00:00:36.897 --> 00:00:40.317
P.S.’s brain was still processing 
information

00:00:40.317 --> 00:00:42.437
from her whole field of vision.

00:00:42.437 --> 00:00:44.097
She could see both images

00:00:44.097 --> 00:00:46.077
and tell the difference between them,

00:00:46.077 --> 00:00:47.837
she just didn’t know it.

00:00:47.837 --> 00:00:50.547
If someone threw a ball at her left side,

00:00:50.547 --> 00:00:51.527
she might duck.

00:00:51.527 --> 00:00:54.777
But she wouldn’t have any 
awareness of the ball,

00:00:54.777 --> 00:00:57.457
or any idea why she ducked.

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:58.877
P.S.’s condition,

00:00:58.877 --> 00:01:01.147
known as hemispatial neglect,

00:01:01.147 --> 00:01:05.987
reveals an important distinction between 
the brain’s processing of information

00:01:05.987 --> 00:01:09.164
and our experience of that processing.

00:01:09.164 --> 00:01:13.034
That experience is what 
we call consciousness.

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:18.044
We are conscious of both the external 
world and our internal selves—

00:01:18.044 --> 00:01:19.815
we are aware of an image

00:01:19.815 --> 00:01:23.685
in much the same way we are aware of 
ourselves looking at an image,

00:01:23.685 --> 00:01:26.455
or our inner thoughts and emotions.

00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:28.965
But where does consciousness come from?

00:01:28.965 --> 00:01:31.815
Scientists, theologians, and philosophers

00:01:31.815 --> 00:01:35.625
have been trying to get to the bottom of 
this question for centuries—

00:01:35.625 --> 00:01:38.225
without reaching any consensus.

00:01:38.225 --> 00:01:39.935
One recent theory is that

00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:44.865
consciousness is the brain’s imperfect 
picture of its own activity.

00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:46.335
To understand this theory,

00:01:46.335 --> 00:01:47.965
it helps to have a clear idea

00:01:47.965 --> 00:01:52.795
of one important way the brain processes 
information from our senses.

00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:54.404
Based on sensory input,

00:01:54.404 --> 00:01:55.764
it builds models,

00:01:55.764 --> 00:01:59.164
which are continuously updating,
simplified descriptions

00:01:59.164 --> 00:02:02.104
of objects and events in the world.

00:02:02.104 --> 00:02:05.454
Everything we know is based 
on these models.

00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:09.044
They never capture every detail of 
the things they describe,

00:02:09.044 --> 00:02:13.097
just enough for the brain to determine 
appropriate responses.

00:02:13.397 --> 00:02:16.877
For instance, one model built deep 
into the visual system

00:02:16.877 --> 00:02:20.137
codes white light as brightness 
without color.

00:02:20.137 --> 00:02:21.197
In reality,

00:02:21.197 --> 00:02:22.987
white light includes wavelengths

00:02:22.987 --> 00:02:26.337
that correspond to all the 
different colors we can see.

00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:30.027
Our perception of white light is wrong 
and oversimplified,

00:02:30.027 --> 00:02:32.487
but good enough for us to function.

00:02:32.487 --> 00:02:35.127
Likewise, the brain’s model of the 
physical body

00:02:35.127 --> 00:02:37.797
keeps track of the configuration 
of our limbs,

00:02:37.797 --> 00:02:40.987
but not of individual cells 
or even muscles,

00:02:40.987 --> 00:02:44.967
because that level of information 
isn’t needed to plan movement.

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:48.707
If it didn’t have the model keeping track 
of the body’s size, shape,

00:02:48.707 --> 00:02:50.677
and how it is moving at any moment,

00:02:50.677 --> 00:02:53.087
we would quickly injure ourselves.

00:02:53.087 --> 00:02:55.797
The brain also needs models of itself.

00:02:55.797 --> 00:02:56.667
For example,

00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:01.187
the brain has the ability to pay attention
to specific objects and events.

00:03:01.187 --> 00:03:03.358
It also controls that focus,

00:03:03.358 --> 00:03:05.268
shifting it from one thing to another,

00:03:05.268 --> 00:03:06.758
internal and external,

00:03:06.758 --> 00:03:08.368
according to our needs.

00:03:08.368 --> 00:03:10.578
Without the ability to direct our focus,

00:03:10.578 --> 00:03:15.318
we wouldn’t be able to assess threats, 
finish a meal, or function at all.

00:03:15.318 --> 00:03:17.497
To control focus effectively,

00:03:17.497 --> 00:03:20.907
the brain has to construct a model 
of its own attention.

00:03:20.907 --> 00:03:24.867
With 86 billion neurons constantly 
interacting with each other,

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:28.657
there’s no way the brain’s model of its 
own information processing

00:03:28.657 --> 00:03:31.117
can be perfectly self-descriptive.

00:03:31.117 --> 00:03:32.787
But like the model of the body,

00:03:32.787 --> 00:03:34.897
or our conception of white light,

00:03:34.897 --> 00:03:36.527
it doesn’t have to be.

00:03:36.527 --> 00:03:40.337
Our certainty that we have a 
metaphysical, subjective experience

00:03:40.337 --> 00:03:42.647
may come from one of the brain’s models,

00:03:42.647 --> 00:03:46.377
a cut-corner description of what it means
to process information

00:03:46.377 --> 00:03:49.197
in a focused and deep manner.

00:03:49.197 --> 00:03:51.867
Scientists have already begun trying 
to figure out

00:03:51.867 --> 00:03:54.787
how the brain creates that self model.

00:03:54.787 --> 00:03:59.517
MRI studies are a promising avenue 
for pinpointing the networks involved.

00:03:59.517 --> 00:04:02.497
These studies compare patterns 
of neural activation

00:04:02.497 --> 00:04:07.507
when someone is and isn’t conscious 
of a sensory stimulus, like an image.

00:04:07.507 --> 00:04:10.947
The results show that the areas needed 
for visual processing

00:04:10.947 --> 00:04:14.916
are activated whether or not the 
participant is aware of the image,

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:17.677
but a whole additional network lights up

00:04:17.677 --> 00:04:21.387
only when they are conscious 
of seeing the image.

00:04:21.387 --> 00:04:24.237
Patients with hemispatial neglect, 
like P.S.,

00:04:24.237 --> 00:04:28.467
typically have damage to one particular 
part of this network.

00:04:28.467 --> 00:04:32.789
More extensive damage to the network 
can sometimes lead to a vegetative state,

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:35.719
with no sign of consciousness.

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:38.499
Evidence like this brings us closer 
to understanding

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:41.249
how consciousness is built into the brain,

00:04:41.249 --> 00:04:43.149
but there’s still much more to learn.

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:44.009
For instance,

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:46.859
the way neurons in the networks 
related to consciousness

00:04:46.859 --> 00:04:49.399
compute specific pieces of information

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:52.369
is outside the scope of our 
current technology.

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:55.449
As we approach questions of consciousness 
with science,

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.979
we’ll open new lines of inquiry 
into human identity.
