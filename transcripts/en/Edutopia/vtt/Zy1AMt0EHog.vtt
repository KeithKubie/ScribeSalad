00:00:09.566 --> 00:00:13.916
My name is Jessica Blandin,
and the title of this poem is,

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:15.756
"I Was Told Mama Had
All The Answers."

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:22.596
I feel as if I were conceived
in a cacophony of imperfections,

00:00:22.596 --> 00:00:25.136
holding lies that were neatly
hidden in my whole existence

00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:27.216
from my image to my first name.

00:00:27.566 --> 00:00:30.356
Missing pieces as if I had
left them in the womb at birth.

00:00:30.976 --> 00:00:33.846
Mama, I need you and
your nimble words,

00:00:33.846 --> 00:00:36.316
because fingers can no longer
trigger the gag reflex,

00:00:36.316 --> 00:00:38.896
and all I want to do
is become a woman.

00:00:39.136 --> 00:00:42.406
That woman, and I know I'm not
an artist, but for a while now,

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:45.686
I've been trying to paint a portrait
of the truth, finding it impossible

00:00:45.686 --> 00:00:48.866
to paint a picture of something
you don't understand here, Mama.

00:00:49.106 --> 00:00:51.006
The truth paints a
picture that I can't see,

00:00:51.006 --> 00:00:53.806
because I've been sitting too
close up to my television screen.

00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:55.206
Mama, where are you?

00:00:55.266 --> 00:00:57.976
See, the teen years are here now,
and I find myself feeling bewildered,

00:00:58.066 --> 00:01:00.716
see, half of the things I deal
with on a day-to-day basis,

00:01:00.716 --> 00:01:03.446
leave me confused, and no, I'm
not talking about trying to figure

00:01:03.446 --> 00:01:04.906
out how to tie my shoes
at four, confused.

00:01:04.906 --> 00:01:07.026
No this is far from that.

00:01:07.026 --> 00:01:08.966
And though you have never
heard my lips whisper words

00:01:09.026 --> 00:01:10.716
of an insecure child,
when I asked you

00:01:10.716 --> 00:01:12.986
for colored eye contacts,
you should have known.

00:01:13.256 --> 00:01:15.286
When I told you that curly
hair wasn't quite what appealed

00:01:15.356 --> 00:01:18.506
to my classmates' eyes, and asked
you for a perm, which, by the way,

00:01:18.506 --> 00:01:21.196
made my hair fall out,
you should have known,

00:01:21.356 --> 00:01:23.446
or maybe even the time I
cried because I couldn't fit

00:01:23.446 --> 00:01:26.806
into a size three, Mama, weren't you
watching out for your only baby girl?

00:01:27.656 --> 00:01:31.036
Mama, I need you to write me a
letter that can explain why teens

00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:33.196
across the nation find blood
to be the color of solace,

00:01:33.196 --> 00:01:35.816
after dealing with problems
far beyond their understandings

00:01:35.816 --> 00:01:37.616
and why I am one of them.

00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.526
Sing me lullabies that
can wash demons

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:41.796
of media's causings away,
Mama, are you listening?

00:01:42.066 --> 00:01:43.606
Are you listening?

00:01:43.656 --> 00:01:46.376
See, nowadays, I feel as if the only
thing I have to offer this world,

00:01:46.376 --> 00:01:49.616
are the words I manage to squeeze out
of a pen I found inside my book bag,

00:01:49.836 --> 00:01:52.466
and lately, those words
haven't been worth much.

00:01:53.026 --> 00:01:55.416
A hundred and thirty
pounds at five-three.

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:59.586
Fifteen years of age, dang, Mama,
I'm overweight thighs rubbing

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:01.106
to the tune of many insecurities.

00:02:01.106 --> 00:02:03.456
My arms jiggle when I
wave, hanging face first

00:02:03.456 --> 00:02:05.976
over a toilet bowl tonight is more
than what yesterday couldn't fix,

00:02:06.036 --> 00:02:07.636
but what tomorrow will
have to deal with.

00:02:07.846 --> 00:02:10.916
Nothing, but another pair of jeans,
European cut so they can't fit,

00:02:10.916 --> 00:02:12.906
and though I hate math, the
numbers never lie, right?

00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:15.766
And I can never turn a size
five into a three, overnight.

00:02:15.886 --> 00:02:20.096
So yes, Mama, here I am,
holding on to a self esteem

00:02:20.096 --> 00:02:23.426
that isn't even knee-high, trying
to understand if beauty lies

00:02:23.456 --> 00:02:26.266
in silicone implants,
facelifts and tabloids -- Mama,

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:28.986
all I want to do is
dream unsightedly.

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:32.626
Look into my mirror, and
not ask my television screen

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:34.606
if I fit its vision of perfection.

00:02:34.606 --> 00:02:38.836
See, at 15, the only thing I'm
aiming for is to become a woman,

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:44.236
and I swear that the announcer guy on
Channel 52, just called Paris Hilton

00:02:44.416 --> 00:02:46.046
and Nicole Ritchie, women.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:49.226
Beautiful, perfect women.

00:02:50.026 --> 00:02:50.726
Thank you.
