00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:06.490
Being unhappy is never wholly to be recommended,
but if there is any period of life in which

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.520
if the mood may be justified and in certain
ways important, then it is roughly between

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:19.610
the ages of 13 and 20. It is hard to imagine
going on to have a successful or even somewhat

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.050
contented next six decades if one has not
been the beneficiary of a good deal of agonising

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:33.270
introspection and intense dislocation in this
span. At the root of adolescent sorrow and

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.940
rage is the recognition that life is hugely
harder, more absurd and less fulfilling than

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.170
one could ever hitherto have suspected – or
had been led to suppose by kindly representatives

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.310
of the adult world. The sentimental protection
of childhood falls away – and a range of

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:59.760
searingly malevolent but profoundly important
realisations strike. For a start, one recognises

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.560
that no one understands. That isn’t quite
true, but of course, the more complicated

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:12.280
any human being is, the less likely they are
to be easily and immediately understood. Therefore,

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.600
as a child develops into an adult, the chances
of those around them exactly sympathising

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.600
with and swiftly grasping their inner condition
necessarily decreases sharply. The first response

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.190
of the teenager is to think themselves uniquely
cursed. But the better eventual insight is

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.830
that true connection with another person is
possible yet astonishingly rare. This leads

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.510
one to a number of important moves. Firstly,
to a heightened and more appropriate gratitude

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:49.950
towards anyone who does understand. Secondly,
to greater efforts to make oneself understood.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.160
The sullen grunts of early adolescence can
give way to the enormous eloquence of the

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:02.009
poetry, diaries and songs of later teenagehood.
The most beautiful pieces of communication

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.619
humanity has ever produced have largely been
the work of people who couldn’t find anyone

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.079
in the vicinity they could talk to. And lastly,
the sense that one is different from other

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:18.519
people, though it may be searingly problematic
at the time, represents a critical moment

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:25.420
when a new generation starts to probe at and
selectively improve upon the existing order.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.669
To be 16 and find everything perfect as it
is would be a terrifyingly sterile position to adopt.

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:40.189
A refusal to accept the folly, error and evil
of the world is a precondition of later achievement.

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:45.659
There really seems no alternative but to be
miserable in mid-adolescence if one is to

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:52.409
stand any chance of making a go of the rest
of one’s life. Another key realisation of

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:58.110
adolescence is that one hates one’s parents.
Yet it is truly an enormous tribute to the

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.340
love and care of parents if their teenage
children turn around and tell them at the

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.779
top of their voice that they loathe them.
It isn’t a sign that something has gone

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:13.639
wrong, it’s evidence that the child knows
they are loved. The really worrying teenagers

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:18.739
aren’t those who misbehave around their
parents and take out their random misery upon

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.699
them, it’s those who are so worried about
not being loved, they can’t afford to put

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:29.560
a foot wrong. To develop proper trust in other
human beings, it can be deeply important to

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.651
be able to test a few examples, to tell them
the very worst things one can think of, and

00:03:34.651 --> 00:03:40.359
then watch them stick around and forgive one.
You have to have few gos at breaking love

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:46.529
to believe it can be solid. And, of course,
one’s parents really are rather annoying

00:03:46.529 --> 00:03:51.909
in many ways. But that too is an important
realisation. We would never leave home and

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.859
become parents ourselves if we weren’t at
some level compensating for the problems,

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:04.150
mistakes and vices we had first identified
in our own parents at fourteen and a half.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.419
Another source of teenage sorrow is how many
big questions suddenly fill one’s mind,

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:16.079
not least: what is the point of it all? This
questioning too is vital. The sort of questions

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:21.190
that adolescents raise tend to get a bad name,
but that is more to do with how they answer

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.340
them than with the questions themselves. What
is the meaning of life? Why is there suffering?

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.080
Why does capitalism not reward people more
fairly? Adolescents are natural philosophers.

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:38.320
The true end-point of adolescence is not,
as it’s sometimes suggested, that one stops

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.950
asking huge questions and gets on with the
day to day. It’s that one acquires the resources

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:50.060
and intelligence to build an entire life around
the sort of big questions that first obsessed

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:58.090
one at seventeen. Lastly, and most poignantly,
teenagers tend to hate themselves. They hate

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:02.680
the way they look, how they speak, the way
they come across. It feels like the opposite

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:10.110
of being loved, but in fact, these isolated,
self-hating moments are the start of love.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:14.710
These feelings are what will, one day, be
at the bedrock of the ecstasy we’ll feel

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:21.840
in the presence of that rare partner who can
accept and desire us back. Tenderness will

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:29.250
mean nothing to us unless we first spent many
nights alone crying ourselves to sleep. Nature

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:34.380
appears to have so arranged things that we
really can’t get to certain insights without

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:40.550
suffering. The real distinction is between
suffering with a purpose and suffering in

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:46.020
vain. For all the horrors of adolescence,
one of its glories is that the suffering it

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:52.550
inflicts is largely securely rooted in some
of the most crucial developments and realisations

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:59.010
of adulthood. These fascinatingly miserable
few years should be celebrated for offering

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.240
us suffering at its best.
