JENNIFER OPENSHAW: Thank you.

00:00:06.883 --> 00:00:07.924
It's so great to be here.

00:00:07.924 --> 00:00:12.180
I've got to ask you,
like, am I in Googleland?

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.240
Like, are you guys
really Googlers?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.100
Because you know you're like
kind of famous out there?

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.800
And whether you
realize it or not, you

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.840
hold an incredible
amount of influence,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.020
you really do, we're
going to talk about that.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.710
How many of you want to
change your career trajectory

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.970
in some way?

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.720
Raise your hand.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.680
How many of you want to change
your personal trajectory

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.720
in some way?

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.900
How about your legacy
trajectory that you

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.019
want to leave in some way?

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:44.310
And how many of you wouldn't
raise your hands no matter

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.980
what I said?

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.180
All right, I think
we're pretty good.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.780
So great to be here, thank
Danielle and Stephanie Redish

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.480
Hofman, who's actually on
our advisory board for Girls

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.040
With Impact, so she's awesome.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.740
DANIELLE: Yeah, she's
a Googler in New York.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.340
So if you don't mind, I'd love
to start when you were young.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.440
This idea that you decided to
go get a job as a motel maid

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.660
at the age of 14--

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.520
what on Earth inspired you to
do that and to do that job?

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.170
JENNIFER OPENSHAW:
You know, my mom

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.840
found herself single
when I was five years old

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.380
and she was single with
no formal education--

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.450
three little kids, 1, 4, and 5--

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.330
and she had to work two
full time jobs as a waitress

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.830
to make ends meet.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.770
And that had a
huge impact on me.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.670
And when I was 12
years old riding home

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.940
from school one day on my
navy blue Schwinn bike,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.900
I had this epiphany
and it was a vision

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.420
that three things became
really clear which

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.350
was I wanted my own
financial independence,

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.470
I wanted to have a big
impact, and I had this sense

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.330
because nobody was there for
my mom that it was all up to me

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.960
and I was going to have to pull
myself up by the bootstraps.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.120
So I was really
focused on trying

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.820
to make something of myself
and I didn't care what it took.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.770
I wanted to put myself
through college,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.790
and so that was the
job down the road,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.140
and at least I can say I can
make a bed the Holiday Inn way

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.329
still to this day.

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:13.370
DANIELLE: That's awesome.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.570
I mean, I completely
resonate with the idea

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.710
of financial independence.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.310
That was a very early
driver for me as well.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.970
And as I just mentioned,
I found myself kind

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.490
of jumping around trying
to find that thing that's

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.150
going to generate interest,
but also have a huge impact,

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.910
and also help my pocketbook.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.360
So when you're deciding
to make these shifts,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.730
how do you know when
it's the right time?

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.771
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: Yeah,
it's really hard, right?

00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:43.530
I mean, sometimes, you're
forced to make a shift

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.510
and I hear a lot of
that from some people.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.310
But an interesting
story, I used to work

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:50.010
in California government
for Governor Jerry Brown's

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.960
sister, Kathleen Brown.

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.100
And she was running for governor
and I was her press secretary

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.530
and I had an aha moment.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:01.650
And I thought, you know, I could
spend the rest of my career

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.200
promoting somebody
else's ideas, or I

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.690
could develop my own ideas.

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.615
And it was a moment where I--

00:03:08.615 --> 00:03:10.740
and I think this is really
important for all of you

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.840
is to look at the
path you're on.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.374
Is the path you're on can it
get you to where you want to go?

00:03:16.374 --> 00:03:18.540
And at that point, I sort
of decided, you know what?

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.150
I think I'll be pigeonholed
if I stay in state government

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.780
too long.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.939
So I moved into the
financial industry.

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.480
And then the other
thing that I think

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.760
is really important
in deciding when

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.430
do you make that change is
looking at trends and data.

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.894
And so kind of fast
forward a little bit.

00:03:34.894 --> 00:03:36.810
I was in business school
and working full time

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.690
at a large bank
and I was noticing

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.925
a lot of data and trends.

00:03:40.925 --> 00:03:42.300
And those trends
at the time were

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.730
that women were building
wealth, but they were not

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.970
going to places like Yahoo
Finance to invest their money.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.452
And so I had an aha and
in short develop this idea

00:03:52.452 --> 00:03:53.910
for Women's Financial
Network which

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.820
is the first financial
site for women.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.284
My boyfriend at the time,
though, said, you know, Jen?

00:04:00.284 --> 00:04:01.950
I mean, it's a really
good idea but like

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.340
Charles Shwab could come in
and take you over tomorrow.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.082
And he was sort of
right about that.

00:04:07.082 --> 00:04:08.290
But I thought, you know what?

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.060
They're not doing it now, I've
got my business plan in hand,

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.070
I had started to form a team,
and I was like, you know what?

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.070
I'm going to go for it.

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.796
And it completely changed
the trajectory of my career.

00:04:21.796 --> 00:04:23.670
I was working at a
financial firm at the time

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.419
and my boss invites me over for
dinner, whole different thing.

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:29.960
I mean, I felt like
all of a sudden I

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.570
had climbed like 10 rungs
up the career ladder.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.720
I ended up doing a book,
becoming Microsoft Money's

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.850
spokesperson, it completely
changed my career.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.350
So what I would say is
look at the path you're on.

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:45.000
Is it getting you
where you want to go?

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.267
Is it building you the kinds
of skills that you want,

00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:49.350
getting you the kind of
connections that you want,

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.060
getting you the credibility
that you need to move forward?

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.170
And also think about the
data or trends taking place.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.619
I think it's really want
to stay at the forefront.

00:04:57.619 --> 00:04:59.910
And then there's little gut
that comes into play there.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.580
DANIELLE: Yep, yep, but
all that can be pretty darn

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:03.289
stressful, right?

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.163
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: It
can be stressful, yeah.

00:05:05.163 --> 00:05:07.320
DANIELLE: They say that,
what, the top stress

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.870
makers are getting
married, moving,

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.960
and changing your career maybe.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.840
So how do you manage all that?

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.340
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: Well, you
know, it's really tough, right?

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.710
I mean, I actually
had an experience

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.950
where I adopted a
philosophical approach.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:26.520
So a long time ago when I worked
for another elected official

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.830
as I was coming out
of UCLA, I got a job--

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:33.750
got close to a job as
the assistant press

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.400
secretary for then
mayor Tom Bradley of LA,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.200
a very famous mayor.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.357
And they basically
told me I had the job,

00:05:40.357 --> 00:05:42.190
and I went back to my
day job, and I'm still

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.270
wrapping up college.

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:46.840
And they called me up and
they said, you know what?

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.250
Sorry, but the mayor wants
more diversity on the team.

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.220
And I actually
completely got it.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.190
I was a woman, but he
wanted really more diversity

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.870
and it was kind of OK.

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:01.510
And so I sat back, and
then a couple of months

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.730
later I ended up getting,
through the boss at that time

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:09.550
connection, to ultimately
become the press secretary

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.060
to Kathleen Brown, Governor
Jerry Brown's sister,

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.550
and at the age of 25.

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:17.890
That was an amazing opportunity.

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.380
And so I really now
feel-- and some of this

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:23.020
comes from age--
that things happen

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.060
at the right time
for a reason and it's

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.730
really easy to get impatient.

00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.940
And so still to this
day, I will force myself

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.010
to breathe and say, the time--

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:36.410
when the right opportunity is
there, it's going to happen,

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:39.160
but it's also important to keep
yourself out there and open

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:40.690
to those opportunities.

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:43.780
DANIELLE: Yeah, I mean, you've
done such an amazing job, which

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:47.580
is really evident in your
book where she's interviewed

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.560
hundreds of highly,
highly influential people

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.390
all over the world.

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:56.740
How did you build your influence
and your personal brand

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:59.200
so that you could
have these interviews

00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:02.540
and really gain those
insights and connections?

00:07:02.540 --> 00:07:05.180
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: So I think
credibility is so important,

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.940
especially here in the Valley.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.580
And I saw the power of that
when I worked in government

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.040
for Kathleen because they
were sort of considered

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.080
the Kennedys of the West
Coast and the media--

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.910
and so I saw the
influence of media.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.400
And then when I was starting
to build my first company

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.270
and I had just a business
plan in hand, I went to then--

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.400
ultimately ended up
meeting with the CEO

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.490
of CBS Market Watch,
financial site in town,

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.500
and I had this idea.

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.422
And a long story short, he
wasn't willing to invest in it,

00:07:32.422 --> 00:07:34.630
but he said, why don't you
become our Women And Money

00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:35.607
columnist?

00:07:35.607 --> 00:07:37.190
And I scratched my
head and I thought,

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.780
oh my gosh, another thing to do.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:39.430
How am I going to do this?

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.980
But I thought, you
know, it's going

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:42.430
to give me some credibility.

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:47.050
As I'm out building this
business, I'm going to do that.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.560
And so there's so much
power in credibility,

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:52.540
but the other piece
of it-- there's

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:57.460
a couple of pieces-- is, number
one, is having a niche focus.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:07:59.440
Look at yourself
and the expertise

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:02.260
that you have that's
really unique to you

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.400
and build off that.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:05.500
I mean, everybody has that.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.660
And trust me, I've had
to go through exercises

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.410
with myself to really think
about what is it that I know.

00:08:11.410 --> 00:08:13.540
For me, it's the
nexus of finance,

00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:15.760
technology, and women
I would say, right?

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:17.200
It's somewhat unique.

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:18.440
So look at that.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:21.070
And then the other is
don't underestimate

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:23.350
the power of confidence
because a lot of people,

00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:25.030
no matter what level you're at--

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.520
you might think, oh,
I'm not good enough.

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:28.812
I can't be talking to a CEO--

00:08:28.812 --> 00:08:29.520
I'm not whatever.

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:34.100
But if you don't deliver
a message with confidence,

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.440
you're never going
to go anyplace.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:39.320
You all know something
extremely well.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.570
You wouldn't be here
working if you didn't.

00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:43.850
I don't care what area it
is-- content, marketing,

00:08:43.850 --> 00:08:45.920
digital data, analytics.

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:48.200
And so when you
present something,

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.990
the power of presenting it with
authority and credibility--

00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:54.050
it will make all the
difference in your ability

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.130
to move forward.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:57.980
The last thing is that I do--
and I've had to learn this.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:00.230
I mean, I came from
completely nothing--

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:04.190
is pulling those threads
that build that credibility

00:09:04.190 --> 00:09:05.210
foundation for you.

00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:08.360
So there have been times
when I'm talking to somebody

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.910
or wanting to form a
partnership or whatever

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.420
and I built an advisory
board with some name people

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:15.980
to give me that credibility.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.770
So people said, oh yeah,
that's you know-- now

00:09:18.770 --> 00:09:20.730
that's interesting to me.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:25.010
So those are some
ways that you can--

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:27.260
the last thing that's
worth mentioning

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:30.362
is connecting with people
on a personal level.

00:09:30.362 --> 00:09:32.070
It doesn't matter who
you're talking to--

00:09:32.070 --> 00:09:35.650
CEO, janitor, or whatever,
everybody is a person.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:38.020
And a good example
is back when I

00:09:38.020 --> 00:09:40.480
was building Women's
Financial Network

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.230
and wanting to connect with very
influential people to endorse

00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:47.590
or whatever, one was Debbie
Fields of Mrs. Fields Cookies.

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:52.450
And the reason she
came back is that she

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.130
saw what happened
with her mother,

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:56.650
couldn't even
balance a checkbook,

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.450
and she was dealing
with her own daughter.

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.630
So that personal
connection, no matter

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:05.440
who you're talking to, pitching,
building relationships, wanting

00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.420
to form a
partnership-- honestly,

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.300
I think it comes down to that
personal connection almost more

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.770
than anything.

00:10:11.770 --> 00:10:13.300
DANIELLE: Yeah,
that's good advice.

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:15.460
I mean, given that I
came from the news space

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.690
and I know how
finicky media can be,

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:24.500
you say it as if it's so easy
to get the attention of media.

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.100
But how do you do that?

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:29.650
How did you-- how
do you get someone

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:32.160
to say, yes Jennifer,
we'll have you on CNN?

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.642
Or how did you get on Oprah?

00:10:33.642 --> 00:10:35.350
JENNIFER OPENSHAW:
There's really a power

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:37.220
in things building upon things.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:41.920
So that I also huge
believe in the power of--

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.360
boy, there's so
many good examples

00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:45.193
and we'll talk about
one a little bit later.

00:10:45.193 --> 00:10:48.640
But when something
happens is to build upon--

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:51.650
I mean, a few examples
would be, for example,

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:56.170
when Martha Stewart was
going through her crisis,

00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:58.300
I had a really
interesting message.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.520
I said, you know what?

00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.920
Despite what she
has or has not done,

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:07.480
she has still delivered
products of great value

00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:09.370
that everyday people can use.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:12.700
I think she might
withstand this crisis.

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.257
And I went on CNN the next thing
and I was doing live shows.

00:11:15.257 --> 00:11:17.340
And the next thing is like
Fox and the other media

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:18.280
are seeing that.

00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:20.470
Here in Silicon Valley
when I was here, actually

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:24.460
what happened is I got profiles
in the San Francisco Chronicle

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:26.194
and I had been
thinking about a book.

00:11:26.194 --> 00:11:27.610
And the agent said,
you know what?

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:30.940
Now we've got that profile, we
can take it to the publisher.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:33.510
They like seeing it
because it's credibility.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:35.290
Oh, and you also have a company.

00:11:35.290 --> 00:11:37.300
And then that led to
a lot of other things.

00:11:37.300 --> 00:11:40.000
And also, understanding how
to tell a good story helped,

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.280
or how to communicate.

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:44.980
In my case, it was educating
people about finances.

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:48.820
So when I started
building this company,

00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:51.506
I said, gosh, I want to
help build our brand,

00:11:51.506 --> 00:11:53.380
but I don't want to
spend gazillions of money

00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.030
like a lot of companies
do sometimes, I

00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:56.650
think, not so wisely.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.810
And I thought, I'm going
to try to position us

00:11:58.810 --> 00:12:01.450
as the authority
on women and money.

00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.940
You know, I'm not bad on TV, I'm
not great, done a little bit.

00:12:04.940 --> 00:12:07.900
I was not as good as a lot
of other people when I tried.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.510
And when I were on, good
enough to be asked back on.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:14.920
And so all of that created this.

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:15.970
And then what happened?

00:12:15.970 --> 00:12:19.494
Then Microsoft then-- because
I was out in the media,

00:12:19.494 --> 00:12:21.160
then Microsoft saw
me out there and they

00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:23.891
wanted to do a campaign
across the country educating

00:12:23.891 --> 00:12:24.640
women about money.

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:26.840
And they came to me and I
worked for them for three years.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:28.256
DANIELLE: So it
was really finding

00:12:28.256 --> 00:12:33.610
that niche, that unique thing,
and then getting the one media

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:36.700
outlet to pick you up, and
then start generating interest

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:40.450
with other outlets once
you use your ability

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.782
to pick up a trend,
and then that leads

00:12:42.782 --> 00:12:43.990
to so many new opportunities.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.427
I mean, it's really smart.

00:12:45.427 --> 00:12:48.010
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: And a couple
other things you guys can do--

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:49.120
and I talk about people.

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:50.930
So let's say you have
a particular niche

00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:52.930
and you have something
to say because there's so

00:12:52.930 --> 00:12:55.060
many interesting
trends going on.

00:12:55.060 --> 00:12:56.320
You could write a byline.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.260
You could partner with
somebody of great authority

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.010
at another organization
and do a byline,

00:13:02.010 --> 00:13:03.460
and then you can
take that byline

00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.770
and take it to a media outlet.

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:08.170
Truth be told though,
media is a lot harder today

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.450
than it was 10 years ago.

00:13:09.450 --> 00:13:11.992
DANIELLE: Yeah, especially the
state of everything right now.

00:13:11.992 --> 00:13:13.616
JENNIFER OPENSHAW:
Oh it's so different

00:13:13.616 --> 00:13:14.690
to get your message out.

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.800
And so I wouldn't discount
some of the big influencers

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:20.654
on social media channels
as well and events.

00:13:20.654 --> 00:13:22.070
DANIELLE: So I
think a lot of us--

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:25.060
I don't know if I can speak for
everybody-- but at some point

00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:27.970
have been interested
in starting something,

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:31.840
whether that be a nonprofit, or
a company of our own one day,

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.360
but making the shift
from a major corporation

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.624
to starting your own business
just seems so overwhelming.

00:13:38.624 --> 00:13:39.790
How did you make that shift?

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:43.925
How did you-- what was the thing
that sort of helped to you to

00:13:43.925 --> 00:13:44.800
make that transition?

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:48.550
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: Yeah, I think
it's really important to have

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.150
a plan before you make a leap.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.120
I see people who don't think
through the basic things,

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.160
so clearly like
a business plan--

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.720
but also what I
mean that I think

00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:01.390
can make a difference if
you're going to make a change,

00:14:01.390 --> 00:14:05.484
let's say, is to
have a team with you.

00:14:05.484 --> 00:14:07.900
I mean, one of the lessons I
learned that led to that book

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.169
is don't go it alone.

00:14:10.169 --> 00:14:11.710
For too much of my
career, I actually

00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:14.270
went it alone and I learned--

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.040
and that's again
why did the book.

00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:18.850
I learned in looking at really
wealthy people or financially

00:14:18.850 --> 00:14:22.180
successful people, whether it's
Mark Zuckerberg or Bill Gates

00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:23.520
or Oprah--

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:28.010
you think from the media that
they did it all by themselves,

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.320
but they really didn't.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.350
They had a core partner
in there with them,

00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:35.560
and then they leveraged their
networks to extend externally.

00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:39.390
And by the way, those folks do
leverage their networks more

00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:40.260
than other people.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.390
And women tend to not
leverage their networks

00:14:42.390 --> 00:14:46.110
and relationships as much
as men, believe it or not.

00:14:46.110 --> 00:14:48.787
So in making the
leap, I think one way

00:14:48.787 --> 00:14:51.120
to think about it is you want
to build a moat around you

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:54.870
so that you're as in a steady
foundation as possible.

00:14:54.870 --> 00:14:58.260
And ways that you can do
that is having a team,

00:14:58.260 --> 00:14:59.670
having a deal in hand.

00:14:59.670 --> 00:15:03.920
I could give an example too
of when I was at Bank One

00:15:03.920 --> 00:15:05.100
actually.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.080
I knew I wanted to
start another venture,

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:11.600
and I had an idea for some
versions of Quicken software,

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.220
but a little bit more
simplified for consumers,

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:16.200
and I had started
building this budget kit.

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.740
And before I left, l I went
to the credit card division.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:20.857
I said, you know what?

00:15:20.857 --> 00:15:22.440
I'm going to try to
get a deal on hand

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:25.260
to market, distribute my
products through there,

00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:26.310
and I did.

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:29.706
So I would leave
with things in place.

00:15:29.706 --> 00:15:31.080
I would never
leave-- like if you

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.240
need funding for your
venture, I would never

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.880
leave without funding in place.

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:38.220
I would try to have a
deal or two in hand.

00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:40.260
I would have a core team
and I would make sure

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.980
that your team doesn't look
and reflect just like you,

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:47.310
because you want somebody who
can go into those other areas

00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:49.690
or bring those other skills
that you don't have, right?

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:51.720
That's the power
of having a team.

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:54.930
So those are a few things--
and then always a plan B.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.550
What if it doesn't work out?

00:15:56.550 --> 00:16:01.770
Or what if I decide to stay here
and I'm going to go to China

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:03.070
and take on a role?

00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:04.000
And then what if?

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:07.410
A lot of people don't think
and plan through the what if.

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:08.820
I would say how--

00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.630
if you have spouses or dear
friends, talk that through

00:16:12.630 --> 00:16:14.280
so you are really
thinking through, OK,

00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:18.570
if something falls apart--
if a leg in the stool falls,

00:16:18.570 --> 00:16:20.377
what's my game plan?

00:16:20.377 --> 00:16:21.960
DANIELLE: Yeah, I
mean one of the keys

00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:24.580
that you mentioned in your
book is make them want it.

00:16:24.580 --> 00:16:27.420
And I think here at Google,
we have 20% Projects

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.550
and we're trying
constantly to get

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.280
everybody interested in
our new product idea.

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.922
And of course, with
physical products,

00:16:35.922 --> 00:16:37.380
you can get those
out on the market

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:39.963
and you can test them which you
talk a lot about in your book.

00:16:39.963 --> 00:16:42.150
But one thing that
I've struggled with

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.350
is, what if it's a service?

00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:45.380
What if it's something
like consulting?

00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:50.160
Then how do you test what
you can offer if it's you

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.170
that you're offering?

00:16:51.170 --> 00:16:52.510
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: Yeah,
yeah, so that's a good one.

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:54.780
Actually, I've had some friends
from some big companies right

00:16:54.780 --> 00:16:56.310
here come to me on
that very issue,

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:58.210
but I'm going to use
Mario as a good example.

00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:04.950
So Mario headed up Quicken
money way back in the day, OK?

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:06.640
And he did exactly that.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.050
And I think he did
it the right way.

00:17:10.050 --> 00:17:14.940
Ultimately, what his business
is is outsourced web development

00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:17.160
in South America.

00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:19.139
When you're thinking
about making a change,

00:17:19.139 --> 00:17:21.180
particularly in consulting--
because there are so

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:22.050
many people out there.

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:23.424
There are people
leaving McKinsey

00:17:23.424 --> 00:17:25.470
to start up consulting
businesses in technology,

00:17:25.470 --> 00:17:25.680
right?

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:27.359
That's who you're
going up against.

00:17:27.359 --> 00:17:28.860
I would think a few things.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:32.530
One is, is what you
are delivering really

00:17:32.530 --> 00:17:33.550
differentiating?

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:34.960
Is it powerful?

00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.280
I think Mario had that.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:38.050
Because you know what he had?

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:42.480
Lower cost, English
speaking, same time zone.

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:44.790
Many people were going to a
lot of other places, right?

00:17:44.790 --> 00:17:48.230
So definitely a compelling--
and on top of it,

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:49.480
he knows software development.

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.520
He was doing it for Intuit, OK?

00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.150
So have something-- it's
got to be a compelling.

00:17:55.150 --> 00:17:57.460
If you want to stay in
business-- secondly,

00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:00.760
I would think about bringing
really powerful people

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:02.230
to your team.

00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:05.680
When you have the strength of
the Google name behind you,

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:09.910
it's not nearly as difficult
as a lot of other people.

00:18:09.910 --> 00:18:13.200
So I believe in the power
of brand association.

00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:14.050
What are some of--

00:18:14.050 --> 00:18:15.490
you want to bring
oomph to this team,

00:18:15.490 --> 00:18:17.323
like caliber, so that
when you go and you're

00:18:17.323 --> 00:18:21.160
pitching business, they go,
God, they've been at Google

00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:22.960
and they've been at
McKinsey, whatever.

00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:25.220
And oh gosh, they
know data analytics

00:18:25.220 --> 00:18:26.680
and they've built these models.

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:27.550
OK, so that's that.

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:31.630
And then I would test the
waters with potential clients.

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:35.410
And I would actually try to have
a client or two ready to go.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:37.360
And the last is
again have a plan

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:42.760
B. So in your plan,
set some clear goals.

00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.460
By the first six months,
we need to achieve x and y

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:47.890
for this to make sense for us.

00:18:47.890 --> 00:18:53.620
And I've seen the power of
people setting real markers.

00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:55.450
Sometimes, we set
like small goals,

00:18:55.450 --> 00:18:58.390
but it's recently
with a team of people

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:03.490
and with a big global company
and revenue kind of down.

00:19:03.490 --> 00:19:07.180
And this particular team
although on a Saturday had met.

00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.372
And they're thinking,
yeah, you know,

00:19:09.372 --> 00:19:11.080
so what should our
goal be for this year?

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:11.860
Well, it could be [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:11.860 --> 00:19:13.272
They said, you know what?

00:19:13.272 --> 00:19:14.230
Let's like stretch it .

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.615
Let's make 60--

00:19:15.615 --> 00:19:16.990
I'm picking the
number, but these

00:19:16.990 --> 00:19:19.570
are the range of numbers--
$65 million is our goal.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:21.220
We're going to go for $65.

00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:23.230
They went for $65.

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:24.940
They exceeded it.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:27.330
The following year, they
in the $100 million plus.

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:29.480
And in the following year,
they're $200 million.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:33.280
So if they hadn't set those kind
of markers, the following years

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:35.920
they would not have achieved
what they achieved, right?

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:37.160
They wouldn't have.

00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.950
So it's the power
of thinking big.

00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:41.860
I really love the power
of thinking big, even

00:19:41.860 --> 00:19:42.790
here at Google.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.550
And in one of my
roles, I remember

00:19:45.550 --> 00:19:47.890
thinking I'm going to focus.

00:19:47.890 --> 00:19:50.380
And you've all heard
the advice of focusing,

00:19:50.380 --> 00:19:53.380
but I was-- it actually
was right before I started

00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:54.490
Women's Financial Network.

00:19:54.490 --> 00:19:57.100
I was working at another
financial firm, Bank

00:19:57.100 --> 00:20:00.960
of America, really
great, loved it.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:01.840
But I had this idea.

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.720
But I also thought, when I
went to that firm, I was like,

00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:03.990
you know what?

00:20:03.990 --> 00:20:04.930
I'm going to achieve.

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:06.460
I'm going to focus
on two or three

00:20:06.460 --> 00:20:08.800
big rocks that are going
to make a difference.

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.620
It's really easy to get caught
up in the minutia all day.

00:20:11.620 --> 00:20:13.130
It's really easy.

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:17.230
But if you move one or two
big rocks, it gets noticed.

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:19.510
And that goes back to
building your personal brand

00:20:19.510 --> 00:20:21.944
and increasing your worth.

00:20:21.944 --> 00:20:23.860
And I know you guys have
a chance for projects

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.880
here in innovation.

00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:30.460
If you led something, your--

00:20:30.460 --> 00:20:33.400
DANIELLE: Oh, yeah, we have
a thing here called OKRs.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.930
And I feel like they can always
end up being 50 lines long.

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.220
So consolidating that to
just what are the top three

00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.510
things that you really
want to focus on

00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.062
is something that I feel
like we all could work on.

00:20:44.062 --> 00:20:45.770
JENNIFER OPENSHAW:
And then stay focused.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.410
Because I ended up
getting a deal--

00:20:47.410 --> 00:20:51.460
long story short is this company
has an index like the S&amp;P 500

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:53.510
index but it really
measures the whole market.

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:54.460
Nobody knew about it.

00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.670
Long story short, it ended
up doing a deal with CNBC

00:20:57.670 --> 00:20:59.510
to use it on TV.

00:20:59.510 --> 00:21:02.470
I'm not-- and I never
said anything to anybody.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:07.300
Keep it quiet until
things are buttoned up.

00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:08.860
And that was a really big win.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.660
The CEO even years
later remembered that.

00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:15.280
So focusing on the
big kills, when

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:17.530
you have the strength of
Google like you all do.

00:21:17.530 --> 00:21:19.950
DANIELLE: Yeah, there
was a piece of advice

00:21:19.950 --> 00:21:22.200
that you gave in your book--

00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.310
Maya Angelou was one
of the contributors.

00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:27.610
And you had said this is
something that really resonated

00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:31.900
with you and gave you
the ability to go out

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:33.880
there and meet anyone.

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.266
What was that advice
that you just--

00:21:36.266 --> 00:21:37.390
that really stuck with you?

00:21:37.390 --> 00:21:38.200
JENNIFER OPENSHAW:
Wait, her advice?

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.910
DANIELLE: Maya Angelou, yeah.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:44.500
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: Oh, she
said that people should not

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:49.480
look at themselves no less
than the CEO and no greater

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:51.370
than the babysitter
whom she pays,

00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:53.650
but truly an equal person.

00:21:53.650 --> 00:21:55.340
And I think maybe
more importantly,

00:21:55.340 --> 00:21:58.750
she said that there is a way
that you walk into a room.

00:21:58.750 --> 00:22:01.750
It's not that you're so
braggadocios, she said,

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.000
but there's a way that
you carry yourself

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.530
with some felicity,
some warmth, and people

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:12.530
feel like I can be
OK with this person.

00:22:12.530 --> 00:22:15.180
And so the example would be--
and I don't know if some of you

00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:18.810
have had it with leaders,
and I've had to learn it,

00:22:18.810 --> 00:22:23.740
but it makes you feel kind of
powerful is working with CEOs.

00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:27.100
And when you really know
what you're talking about

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.154
and you say it with authority--

00:22:29.154 --> 00:22:30.820
because they are
looking for good advice

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:31.870
themselves, by the way.

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:33.220
They can't do it all--

00:22:33.220 --> 00:22:36.610
they will listen, and they
will then come to rely on you,

00:22:36.610 --> 00:22:38.110
and they'll come back.

00:22:38.110 --> 00:22:43.730
And so it's like taking a
breath, getting in your power.

00:22:43.730 --> 00:22:45.830
And I've used the power
of visualization a lot

00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:47.780
in my life, a lot.

00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:49.430
We could talk about that, but--

00:22:49.430 --> 00:22:51.080
DANIELLE: Yeah, I
mean, I'd actually

00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:53.300
love to go there for
a moment, because I

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:55.460
think a lot of people--
and you had mentioned

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:57.830
this in your book-- have
this mantra that they say

00:22:57.830 --> 00:22:59.840
to themselves or this
thing that just changes

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:01.880
their entire
presence in a meeting

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.240
or while they're talking
to a business leader

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:07.460
or you have that pitch
that you're trying to make.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.130
What is your process
and what tips

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.500
can you give to
people to develop what

00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:13.750
they can use in those moments?

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.500
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: So
I'm going to go to--

00:23:15.500 --> 00:23:17.730
I'll give you like a
really good example.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.987
So after I sold
my company here, I

00:23:20.987 --> 00:23:22.820
was thinking about what
I wanted to do next.

00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:24.830
I figured I'd start something
again, wasn't quite sure.

00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:25.871
I thought, you know what?

00:23:25.871 --> 00:23:27.500
Maybe I'll work at
a large company.

00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:32.210
I ended up pitching
Jamie Dimon who was then

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.000
the CEO-- is the CEO
of JPMorgan Chase now,

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:38.150
pitching him, exploring
working with him.

00:23:38.150 --> 00:23:40.070
He was the CEO of
Bank One at the time.

00:23:40.070 --> 00:23:41.860
And I ended up getting
a meeting with him.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.490
And I'm sitting there
like-- and I was prepared.

00:23:44.490 --> 00:23:46.370
We'll get to the
tips in a second.

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.030
And I was just thinking,
what am I going

00:23:49.030 --> 00:23:50.700
to say when I go in there?

00:23:50.700 --> 00:23:53.420
But in all honesty,
my suggestions

00:23:53.420 --> 00:23:55.700
are-- number one is to
always do your homework

00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:57.980
and know something
about the person.

00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.500
I think there's so
much power in making

00:24:00.500 --> 00:24:02.930
a personal connection
with somebody

00:24:02.930 --> 00:24:05.150
and you can do that by--

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:06.890
there's a lot can find online.

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:08.600
You can pick up
something in an office

00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.040
and it can tell you a lot.

00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.530
You can start from a
conversation from there.

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:16.490
I like to-- when I'm--

00:24:16.490 --> 00:24:19.160
somebody recently was
looking for advice.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.820
She was looking for a promotion
in her company actually

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.850
and she needs to
sell herself more.

00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:30.350
And I said, you know what I
would do is a one pager that

00:24:30.350 --> 00:24:33.230
very clearly and
somewhat visually--

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:34.520
not a bunch of text--

00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:38.510
crystallizes your brand and
the impact you've had here--

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:40.160
and she did that--

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:43.100
and then go have conversations
with all the key stakeholders.

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:44.750
And she's doing that right now.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.770
So back to my meeting.

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:50.210
I ended up having a one
pager on some specific ideas

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:53.630
to build the business that, of
course, leveraged what I knew.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.220
So that's the other thing.

00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:00.650
And then the last is to try
to offer something of value

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:02.720
to somebody when you're
meeting with them.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:06.290
And it sort of depends
on the situation.

00:25:06.290 --> 00:25:08.120
But in a lot of
cases, it can be as

00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:12.380
simple as looking on LinkedIn
at the connection points

00:25:12.380 --> 00:25:14.984
that you have and having
a conversation where

00:25:14.984 --> 00:25:16.400
at some point
you're saying, gosh,

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:19.107
do you know so-and-so at
such and such company?

00:25:19.107 --> 00:25:19.940
And they'll say, no.

00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:22.189
And you say, well, would you
like me to introduce you?

00:25:22.189 --> 00:25:24.480
A lot of people like to do that.

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:26.940
They appreciate that.

00:25:26.940 --> 00:25:31.580
And then lastly is you've
picked up some personal things

00:25:31.580 --> 00:25:34.040
or things in that meeting
with somebody, anything

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:37.580
from their dislikes
to personal items

00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.850
to things they share,
remember that or tuck it away

00:25:40.850 --> 00:25:45.740
as I do and include something
personal in a follow-up note.

00:25:45.740 --> 00:25:47.484
I think it makes
a big difference.

00:25:47.484 --> 00:25:50.150
Like, I really liked it when you
said that, it really stood out,

00:25:50.150 --> 00:25:51.792
or I think one of
the things that

00:25:51.792 --> 00:25:53.750
could help you move the
needle on such and such

00:25:53.750 --> 00:25:56.420
that you talked
about was da da da.

00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:57.962
It makes a difference
in your ability

00:25:57.962 --> 00:26:00.628
to connect with that person, and
then to come back to them later

00:26:00.628 --> 00:26:01.250
you need to.

00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:03.416
DANIELLE: To get to your
point about how many people

00:26:03.416 --> 00:26:05.726
want to leave a legacy,
Jennifer's company

00:26:05.726 --> 00:26:07.100
and working with
a bunch of girls

00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:11.660
trying to help develop them
into future female leaders.

00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:13.400
So what are some of
the things that you

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:19.310
think are critical to developing
in our youth to really propel

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.577
women to the top?

00:26:20.577 --> 00:26:22.160
JENNIFER OPENSHAW:
Well, look at-- you

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:25.370
can't open the newspaper without
reading about future of work,

00:26:25.370 --> 00:26:28.880
getting everybody ready
for AI and cryptocurrency

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:32.010
and all this stuff,
diversity, talent pipeline.

00:26:32.010 --> 00:26:35.060
And it's strange that you know
here we are today and only 6%

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:36.480
of CEOs are women.

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:38.600
So we want to change that.

00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.210
And oddly, while
there's a lot of stuff

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:42.830
in this STEM and
coding space, when

00:26:42.830 --> 00:26:45.650
you look at entrepreneurship
or business,

00:26:45.650 --> 00:26:49.280
there isn't anything that
equips teen girls in this case

00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:51.500
to actually build those skills.

00:26:51.500 --> 00:26:54.560
And so over 12 weeks, they
go through a mini-MBA,

00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:56.990
they do it after school,
we offer it year round,

00:26:56.990 --> 00:26:59.851
and they go from ideation
to an actual business plan

00:26:59.851 --> 00:27:01.100
and they're launching benches.

00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:05.360
We just made-- one of them
made international headlines

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:06.320
a couple of weeks ago.

00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:07.454
DANIELLE: That's awesome.

00:27:07.454 --> 00:27:08.870
JENNIFER OPENSHAW:
So we're moving

00:27:08.870 --> 00:27:12.410
the needle in their
confidence, in giving them

00:27:12.410 --> 00:27:16.790
a leg up, scholarships, but
at the same time allowing

00:27:16.790 --> 00:27:18.620
people like you to really--

00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:22.070
my hope is that all
of you will join us

00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:26.040
in creating the next
generation of real leaders

00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:27.830
and playing a role
in that with us

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:30.170
because you can do it
on a personal level.

00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.610
I mean, there's so many
different ways to be involved,

00:27:32.610 --> 00:27:34.360
but it's been
incredibly exciting what

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:35.510
these girls are doing.

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.950
DANIELLE: Yeah, yeah
it's really awesome.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:39.116
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: And for
companies like Google too

00:27:39.116 --> 00:27:42.790
who are looking to
build a talent pipeline,

00:27:42.790 --> 00:27:44.440
this is really important.

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:47.200
And to take what they're
learning at STEM--

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.990
you know, they can't take
what they're learning at STEM

00:27:49.990 --> 00:27:53.110
or coding if they don't have
the business or entrepreneurship

00:27:53.110 --> 00:27:56.590
skills to create
companies and jobs.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.144
DANIELLE: Well, thank you.

00:27:58.144 --> 00:27:59.560
I'd now like to
turn the audience.

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.830
If anybody has any
questions for Jennifer.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.530
AUDIENCE: So from
Emily in Tech Corners,

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:07.000
sometimes the
power of confidence

00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.080
of delivery outweighs the
power or expertise or skill.

00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.960
Have you run into that before?

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.650
If so, how do you manage it?

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:16.960
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: So I
have been in those roles.

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:19.024
So two things that
I do-- one is there

00:28:19.024 --> 00:28:21.190
have been moments where
I've taken somebody's advice

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:26.620
and I just go, get in your
power, and I stand up tall.

00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:29.860
One time when I was hosting
some shows, the producer,

00:28:29.860 --> 00:28:32.350
the guy said some
advice he had gotten

00:28:32.350 --> 00:28:34.750
was to love your audience.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:36.460
And I think there's
real power in putting

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:37.810
a smile on your face.

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:39.520
It just puts you in the mood.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.920
I think dressing
the role actually

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.860
can give you a lot of
confidence, much more

00:28:44.860 --> 00:28:46.180
so than you might give credit.

00:28:46.180 --> 00:28:48.410
I mean, it has for me.

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:50.870
And the last thing is the
power of visualization.

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:55.085
So I to show kind
of a fun story is

00:28:55.085 --> 00:28:57.470
I had a little bit
of TV background.

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.449
And when I was
really young, it was

00:28:59.449 --> 00:29:00.740
what I thought was a dream job.

00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:05.410
But long story short, I end up
getting called by CBS TV in LA

00:29:05.410 --> 00:29:12.100
to come in for an audition
tomorrow to be their live money

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.970
expert on TV, tomorrow.

00:29:13.970 --> 00:29:17.220
And I was like, oh my, God I
haven't done this in a year

00:29:17.220 --> 00:29:19.520
and I'm not really that good.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:20.770
And oh my gosh.

00:29:20.770 --> 00:29:21.985
But you know, it'd be cool.

00:29:21.985 --> 00:29:22.960
So I get on the phone.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.390
I said, can we do this Thursday?

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:26.690
I'm like, I need to buy time.

00:29:26.690 --> 00:29:28.121
I was like, oh my gosh.

00:29:28.121 --> 00:29:29.620
And then I just
said, you know what?

00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:31.244
Because this was kind
of like my dream.

00:29:31.244 --> 00:29:33.950
I said, you are
going to get this.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:35.170
You are going to get this.

00:29:35.170 --> 00:29:38.410
And I just focused and I
was like I am pulling out

00:29:38.410 --> 00:29:42.139
the stops to get this, and
I am just going to focus,

00:29:42.139 --> 00:29:43.180
and I'm going to deliver.

00:29:43.180 --> 00:29:47.170
And I visualized
myself-- and actually,

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.910
that little experience I
shared when I was 12 years old,

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.720
the epiphany, really was a
visualization about impacting

00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:54.490
people on a large scale.

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.505
I ended up going
into the station.

00:29:57.505 --> 00:30:00.100
I'm next to the TV
anchor I grew up with.

00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:02.380
How weird is that, right?

00:30:02.380 --> 00:30:04.420
And it's after the morning show.

00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:06.470
And they go, OK, let's
do a dry run, Jen,

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:07.890
and let's see if she can do it.

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:09.490
And so we do a dry run.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:13.330
And they say, OK, tape
is rolling, we're live.

00:30:13.330 --> 00:30:16.480
And we do the schtick,
I'm talking about money,

00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:20.690
and I was out of the park
and you sort of know that.

00:30:20.690 --> 00:30:24.260
So I really think you have
to visualize yourself.

00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.620
And I've seen this
countless times.

00:30:26.620 --> 00:30:30.370
Visualize yourself delivering
it or speaking with authority.

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:36.100
Picture yourself doing that
and then go in and do it.

00:30:36.100 --> 00:30:37.420
DANIELLE: Right.

00:30:37.420 --> 00:30:40.480
I mean, it's sort of similar to
another theme in the book that

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:42.100
really resonated,
so I'm going to jump

00:30:42.100 --> 00:30:43.870
in with one more question.

00:30:43.870 --> 00:30:46.650
But you talk about
redefining your comfort zone.

00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:49.420
And what I found so interesting
is everybody says, take a leap,

00:30:49.420 --> 00:30:51.130
take a leap, just
go do this thing,

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.700
but it's not really taking
that big of a leap, right?

00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.090
You're still-- I'd love to hear
sort of what you're [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:00.390
because I thought
I was so helpful.

00:31:00.390 --> 00:31:04.000
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: And so
first off, 45% of millionaires

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.260
experienced fear and
2/3 of them though yet

00:31:08.260 --> 00:31:10.590
said that they had to move
outside their comfort zones

00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.427
in order to build their
financial success, right?

00:31:13.427 --> 00:31:14.260
It just makes sense.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.174
You can't stay where you are
and get to where you want to go.

00:31:17.174 --> 00:31:19.465
You cannot stay where you
are and get to where you want

00:31:19.465 --> 00:31:20.260
to go.

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:24.760
You can't, to our friend,
have the expertise

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:26.680
and not deliver it
with confidence.

00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:27.970
You're holding yourself back.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:28.720
Why?

00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:29.980
There's nothing to be afraid--

00:31:29.980 --> 00:31:32.350
we hold ourselves back.

00:31:32.350 --> 00:31:34.390
And so one way when
you're making a change

00:31:34.390 --> 00:31:37.990
is to realize you're never
going to something completely

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:39.100
unfamiliar.

00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:43.150
You're almost always
leveraging your skill set.

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.084
It could be a network
that's around you.

00:31:45.084 --> 00:31:47.500
It could be some people that
are working with you that you

00:31:47.500 --> 00:31:48.790
worked with before.

00:31:48.790 --> 00:31:52.395
There's some familiarity to it.

00:31:52.395 --> 00:31:54.020
And then the last
thing is in the book.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.770
There's a story about
[? Trisha Cramer. ?]

00:31:55.770 --> 00:31:58.450
She was a schoolteacher
actually, made like $100,000,

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:00.834
but she had this cosmetics
business on the side,

00:32:00.834 --> 00:32:02.500
and she wanted to
make the leap, and she

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:05.710
was kind of nervous about it,
and she had a couple of kids,

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:08.350
and she had this aha moment.

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:10.510
She was afraid of losing
her paycheck, right?

00:32:10.510 --> 00:32:12.370
It makes sense, right?

00:32:12.370 --> 00:32:16.300
And she said, you know, but I'm
actually not really guaranteed

00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:17.540
a paycheck.

00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:20.980
I have to show up every
day and I have to do it.

00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:24.370
And there's lots of ways--
and I just had a conversation

00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:26.990
this weekend with a good friend
who has sold two companies,

00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:28.100
a woman.

00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.730
She has a young child, so
she's decided she intentionally

00:32:30.730 --> 00:32:32.110
wants to keep
things ramped down,

00:32:32.110 --> 00:32:35.730
but her innovative mind has
two other business ideas.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:37.690
So what she's going
to do is she's

00:32:37.690 --> 00:32:40.450
going to prep them to
take to other companies

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:42.010
for them to run
with and she might

00:32:42.010 --> 00:32:45.370
get a licensing piece of
it or help them get it

00:32:45.370 --> 00:32:46.660
off the ground or something.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:50.080
Good idea, way of staying
in what she's doing,

00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.450
but still being able
to maybe see her ideas

00:32:52.450 --> 00:32:54.845
come to life which you can
do to some extent at Google.

00:32:54.845 --> 00:32:56.470
DANIELLE: Yeah, I
mean getting creative

00:32:56.470 --> 00:32:58.250
about the things
you're not great at

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.090
and using what you
are great at it.

00:33:01.090 --> 00:33:05.260
When looking back at some of the
changes I've made successfully,

00:33:05.260 --> 00:33:08.365
it was all things that
weren't huge leaps,

00:33:08.365 --> 00:33:10.240
that I was doing something
that I had already

00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:11.990
been doing before.

00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:13.480
And the that didn't
go so well, I

00:33:13.480 --> 00:33:15.700
tried to make too far
of a leap and that's

00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.060
kind of where things go wrong.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:18.768
So this was the first
time I'd ever heard

00:33:18.768 --> 00:33:21.130
it crystallized in that way.

00:33:21.130 --> 00:33:23.230
Any other questions
in the audience?

00:33:25.830 --> 00:33:27.580
AUDIENCE: So first and
foremost, thank you

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.390
so much for joining us today.

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:33.160
My question is around comfort
zones as we talked about.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.190
When we speak on wealth
generation, people look at that

00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:38.230
and they look at
millionaires and billionaires

00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:40.720
and think, wow, that must
have taken a long time

00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:42.370
or they had a very
innovative idea,

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.440
and how did they
get in that space?

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.750
What would you say to
people who are looking

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:50.660
to build wealth or become
more financially sound

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.420
but see it's so far
off in the distance

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:54.970
that they're kind of stuck
in place, if you will,

00:33:54.970 --> 00:33:57.550
like their caution
to move they think,

00:33:57.550 --> 00:33:59.770
oh, it's such a long
journey and I have

00:33:59.770 --> 00:34:01.470
to do so much to get there?

00:34:01.470 --> 00:34:04.790
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: Yeah,
so it's a great question.

00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:05.500
I think people--

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:08.510
I've seen people can get
there faster than you think.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:12.100
So two examples-- big story
over this past weekend

00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.770
about people who had
become millionaires

00:34:14.770 --> 00:34:17.770
in their 30s and they
made a conscious decision

00:34:17.770 --> 00:34:20.159
because they wanted to
live a different life.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.489
So they basically didn't
want to be beholden.

00:34:22.489 --> 00:34:27.159
And there's so many ways that
you can live below your means.

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:27.760
I did it.

00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:31.420
I mean, I was always about
living below your means.

00:34:31.420 --> 00:34:34.330
Because every time
you're spending money,

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:36.389
it's going to somebody
else and not yourself

00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:39.880
and the power of compounding
that over the years.

00:34:39.880 --> 00:34:42.550
There's definitely things
like completely taking

00:34:42.550 --> 00:34:44.530
advantage of your 401(k).

00:34:44.530 --> 00:34:46.270
Whenever you come
across any kind

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:51.550
of windfall or extra money,
tucking it aside all the time.

00:34:51.550 --> 00:34:53.620
I got lucky when
I sold my company.

00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:57.460
Well, not lucky I paid
attention is made some money

00:34:57.460 --> 00:34:59.830
and really thought about
how I was going to grow it

00:34:59.830 --> 00:35:02.770
and I put it in real estate
and tripled it in five--

00:35:02.770 --> 00:35:06.000
literally tripled
it in five years.

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.810
The other really
interesting story

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:12.770
is that my stepfather found
himself completely out of money

00:35:12.770 --> 00:35:15.100
at like about 60.

00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:18.730
He had never saved,
generation hadn't learned.

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:22.000
He started his own
business and it

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:24.430
was about to get a contract
with the city of LA.

00:35:24.430 --> 00:35:27.760
And long story short,
didn't get that contract,

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:30.500
probably because of some
other political stuff.

00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:33.170
And he didn't know what to do.

00:35:33.170 --> 00:35:37.790
And I actually ended up
moving in with my parents

00:35:37.790 --> 00:35:40.220
and I was actually in
business school at the time.

00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:42.070
And I feel like
there was a reason

00:35:42.070 --> 00:35:44.080
I was living down in that area.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.460
And he reinvented himself,
which is something

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:51.610
that everybody has to be
continuously at the forefront.

00:35:51.610 --> 00:35:56.980
He amazingly learned CAD skills,
all the software, internet.

00:35:56.980 --> 00:35:59.950
I mean, here's a guy who is 60
and this was like 10 years ago.

00:35:59.950 --> 00:36:01.700
I mean, it was
really impressive.

00:36:01.700 --> 00:36:05.380
And then when he had nothing,
so then he ended up getting--

00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:07.020
he's an engineer by background.

00:36:07.020 --> 00:36:11.140
He's an engineer for
public facilities and stuff

00:36:11.140 --> 00:36:15.400
and he ended up getting
hired by a solid construction

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.350
company that's been
around many years

00:36:17.350 --> 00:36:20.620
and he ended up putting aside
like a half million dollars

00:36:20.620 --> 00:36:22.390
in not that long a time.

00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:25.630
And they still had a
fairly normal lifestyle.

00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:32.530
They had to make a big shift
and a change, but it's OK.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:35.680
The world makes us feel like
we have to be living large.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:37.480
I could care less
about having a bigger--

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.320
and I don't have a
big house, by the way.

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.100
I actually don't
want a bigger house.

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:45.430
But there is some
confidence and freedom

00:36:45.430 --> 00:36:49.900
that really comes from
putting it aside and feeling

00:36:49.900 --> 00:36:51.010
in control.

00:36:51.010 --> 00:36:55.560
And if you're married,
having conversations about--

00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:57.350
and I do this very regularly.

00:36:57.350 --> 00:37:00.340
In fact, every year
I set my own plan.

00:37:00.340 --> 00:37:02.980
I've done this for probably
20 years and I used to do it.

00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:05.497
In fact, I wrote it up,
like a buddy system.

00:37:05.497 --> 00:37:07.330
But every year at the
beginning of the year,

00:37:07.330 --> 00:37:09.370
I always think about
my goals for the year

00:37:09.370 --> 00:37:13.660
and I lay them out from a
financial perspective, career,

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:18.390
and personal, including
building friends or networks

00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:20.890
because I haven't been doing
that and I know it's important.

00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:23.530
I want to share the Alex story
because it's a great one.

00:37:23.530 --> 00:37:26.230
So this past weekend, this
friend of mine is at my house.

00:37:26.230 --> 00:37:30.060
And I said, gosh, Giselle--
kids are with the kids.

00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:33.250
Gosh, Giselle, my husband
and I were kind of talking.

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.397
It's very interesting.

00:37:34.397 --> 00:37:36.230
We have dinner parties,
we have people over,

00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:38.470
but people don't
reciprocate a whole lot.

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:40.690
And she says, you know,
Jen, let me share something.

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:45.310
When I was married to Alex,
and Alex is 49 right now--

00:37:45.310 --> 00:37:47.950
nice looking guy, she
works for a hedge fund.

00:37:47.950 --> 00:37:50.560
We lived in a 7,000
square foot house.

00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:52.010
He made great money.

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:55.040
And I said, Alex, why don't
we have your team over?

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:57.209
Why don't we have
the analysts over?

00:37:57.209 --> 00:37:58.000
We have this house.

00:37:58.000 --> 00:37:59.620
Like, what are we paying for?

00:37:59.620 --> 00:38:01.420
And he just wasn't
comfortable with it.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.840
He was like an introvert.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.460
He lost his job.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:08.250
It is three years
later and he now

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:14.200
has verbally recognized
the shortfall

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:16.690
of just failing to reach out.

00:38:16.690 --> 00:38:19.164
And I want to go to something
about networking too which

00:38:19.164 --> 00:38:21.330
is rather than feeling, oh
God, I've got to network,

00:38:21.330 --> 00:38:25.090
I've got to do this, I would
take a different twist to it.

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:27.230
I would view it as--

00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:31.390
I'm like I just want to have
good impact on the world.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:33.040
I want to talk to
this person, see

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.470
if I can be helpful in some
way and impart what I know.

00:38:35.470 --> 00:38:39.404
And by the way, I learn so
much back now from people.

00:38:39.404 --> 00:38:41.320
I used to sit on an
airplane and I would maybe

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.810
like not be so open,
but you pick up

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:47.830
so much and opening yourself
to the possibilities of what's

00:38:47.830 --> 00:38:52.600
around you can take you to
where you want to go, internally

00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.821
and externally.

00:38:53.821 --> 00:38:54.820
DANIELLE: Yeah, I mean--

00:38:54.820 --> 00:38:55.720
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: There's
so much more to talk about.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:56.830
DANIELLE: I know.

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:58.330
What you were saying
earlier totally

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:00.050
reminded me of
mom's advice where

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:03.790
she had said everything
you buy owns a part of you.

00:39:03.790 --> 00:39:08.430
And when you said save and
you don't have a large house,

00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:10.540
I think that that
constricts you and might

00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:12.580
reduce your confidence
to take that step.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.870
So having that safety
net really does impact

00:39:15.870 --> 00:39:18.370
your ability to maneuver
in ways because you

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:19.480
know you have a cushion.

00:39:19.480 --> 00:39:21.100
AUDIENCE: I just a
very quick question

00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.180
about identifying your needs.

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:24.430
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: About what?

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.180
JENNIFER OPENSHAW:
Identifying your needs,

00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.000
if you can give us some
guidance about how you did it

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.200
and any advice on
that would be helpful.

00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.590
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: If you
know the space you're in--

00:39:34.590 --> 00:39:36.700
and I would kind of
imagine all of you

00:39:36.700 --> 00:39:39.190
do because you're like in it.

00:39:39.190 --> 00:39:42.490
By the way, the best ideas
in business and stuff

00:39:42.490 --> 00:39:46.620
come from your experience,
you stumble across something.

00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:53.080
So your niche-- for me, it was
I really sort of stepped back.

00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:56.260
I have done grids
before, like OK--

00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:58.870
but if I were boiling it
down to the three things

00:39:58.870 --> 00:40:01.240
that are really me
that are unique--

00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:05.080
so I want them to be unique,
compelling, and kind of

00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:09.040
at the forefront of where trends
in industry is going, right?

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:12.700
So much now is like data
and AI and automation

00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.830
and what else people and
talent, I mean, right?

00:40:15.830 --> 00:40:17.890
So but there's so many.

00:40:17.890 --> 00:40:20.140
Food is going in all
sorts of different places,

00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:21.310
crazy different places.

00:40:21.310 --> 00:40:25.270
So I would literally
crystallize it

00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:30.190
to the words that define
the space that you know

00:40:30.190 --> 00:40:33.280
and that you're
good at and that--

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:37.450
where there's value to
be had in the market.

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:40.916
So an overlap between a trend
that's happening and something

00:40:40.916 --> 00:40:42.040
that you're really good at?

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.206
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: Yes, yes.

00:40:43.206 --> 00:40:44.124
Does that makes sense?

00:40:44.124 --> 00:40:45.790
And then the other
way to think about it

00:40:45.790 --> 00:40:48.730
too is if you were going
to write an article right

00:40:48.730 --> 00:40:50.920
now in the New York Times
or the Wall Street Journal

00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:52.676
and you were going to like--

00:40:52.676 --> 00:40:53.800
what would you write about?

00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:55.420
What would the headline be?

00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:56.710
And what would you talk about?

00:40:56.710 --> 00:41:00.790
And I bet your three
themes should be like--

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:04.220
they'll be floating
in there, right?

00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:05.240
DANIELLE: Interesting.

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:07.720
AUDIENCE: I heard you said
you started off as a maid

00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.890
when you were 14.

00:41:08.890 --> 00:41:10.300
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: I was.

00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:13.660
AUDIENCE: How did you, I
guess, go from that situation

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:17.682
to even knowing to go into real
estate or knowing about stocks?

00:41:17.682 --> 00:41:19.390
JENNIFER OPENSHAW:
That's a really good--

00:41:19.390 --> 00:41:21.430
I mean, I feel so blessed today.

00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:23.680
I mean, I really--

00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:26.000
so when I'm having
my bad days, I

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:31.180
go, God, like, I could have been
in a very different situation.

00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:34.390
There's power in
education and that's

00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:36.550
why we do Girls With
Impact because I

00:41:36.550 --> 00:41:39.160
feel like if I
didn't go to college

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.230
and even business
school really changed

00:41:41.230 --> 00:41:44.620
my thinking to a whole
more sophisticated level,

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:48.730
changed my income like that
too, for most people it does.

00:41:48.730 --> 00:41:52.570
And it changes your ability to
operate with people on a higher

00:41:52.570 --> 00:41:54.700
plane, sort of.

00:41:54.700 --> 00:41:56.874
You can sort of argue
in business school

00:41:56.874 --> 00:41:57.790
there's so much, but--

00:42:00.370 --> 00:42:03.520
and I think watching and paying
attention to a lot of people--

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:06.010
So small little example,
I'm just pulling something--

00:42:06.010 --> 00:42:08.444
a long time ago, I remember
when I was working in politics

00:42:08.444 --> 00:42:10.360
and a lawyer we worked
with and he had written

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:12.520
a book on going to meetings.

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:14.410
And I read that book
and something really

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:17.780
stood with me which is now
whenever I go to a meeting,

00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.620
I jot down, what do I
want to come away with?

00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:23.140
And even if I'm going to get
rejected, which I've been

00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:25.120
rejected a gazillion times--

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.080
it hurts, but I know
it's going to happen

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.500
and I just hope for the best
and prepare for the worst--

00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.610
is I still try to come out of
something with that meeting.

00:42:33.610 --> 00:42:37.674
And that could be a
relationship with them.

00:42:37.674 --> 00:42:38.590
Because you know what?

00:42:38.590 --> 00:42:42.716
That person has a gazillion
relationships themselves, OK?

00:42:42.716 --> 00:42:43.840
And that's happened before.

00:42:43.840 --> 00:42:46.240
I met with somebody, a VC
guy, and he introduced me

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.390
to somebody else.

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:50.890
It could be that they're going
to introduce you to somebody.

00:42:50.890 --> 00:42:53.140
OK, that's great.

00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:56.170
By the way, would you-- do
you think there's somebody--

00:42:56.170 --> 00:42:58.810
I'm meeting here with folks
about Girls With Impact

00:42:58.810 --> 00:43:01.180
and I'm having that
very conversation

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:03.820
because it's a really
small world, like it's

00:43:03.820 --> 00:43:06.430
a crazy small
world, and you never

00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:09.190
know who you're
going to bump into.

00:43:09.190 --> 00:43:12.790
So back to your question,
it's like watching people

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.620
wanting to do something bigger.

00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:17.230
And it's a combination
of luck I think.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:20.410
It was also partly,
intentionally looking

00:43:20.410 --> 00:43:22.800
at the big picture,
the trends and feeling

00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:25.210
like I think we can be an
authority in this space

00:43:25.210 --> 00:43:26.750
because I see the trends.

00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:28.810
There is no authority
on women and money.

00:43:28.810 --> 00:43:30.290
They're making more money.

00:43:30.290 --> 00:43:31.900
Everybody cares about women.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.850
They're writing the checks.

00:43:33.850 --> 00:43:35.470
By golly, maybe
I have something.

00:43:35.470 --> 00:43:37.660
I'm not great, but maybe
it'll be good enough.

00:43:37.660 --> 00:43:40.090
And I knew the strategy
of how to come up

00:43:40.090 --> 00:43:41.830
with a good story, a good angle.

00:43:41.830 --> 00:43:43.540
And so I'd go on and
I was good enough

00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:46.570
for that they-- so things
feed on themselves.

00:43:46.570 --> 00:43:51.460
And I guess I would say, no
matter where you're going, is--

00:43:51.460 --> 00:43:54.700
actually, we talked about this--
is the power of telling a good

00:43:54.700 --> 00:44:01.010
story, a good whatever it
is succinctly, not too long,

00:44:01.010 --> 00:44:03.549
visually when it makes sense--
the visual identity of Girls

00:44:03.549 --> 00:44:04.090
With Impact--

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.690
the guy who did that made all
the difference in the world,

00:44:06.690 --> 00:44:10.420
like it's the difference between
looking like you have a product

00:44:10.420 --> 00:44:13.412
and you're professional
versus something else.

00:44:13.412 --> 00:44:14.620
Find somebody if you need to.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:18.620
Put your best foot forward.

00:44:18.620 --> 00:44:20.150
DANIELLE: Yeah, I love that.

00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:22.685
So we'll take one more question.

00:44:22.685 --> 00:44:24.880
AUDIENCE: So my question
is about skill development.

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.880
So when we you want
to grow in our life,

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.190
either in the personal
life or in the career,

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:31.250
there's so many skills
that you need to learn.

00:44:31.250 --> 00:44:34.330
And then given a time, we don't
have too much time in a day.

00:44:34.330 --> 00:44:36.450
So how do we choose
the best skill

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:38.480
that's most important to us?

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.270
And how do we
strategize to ensure

00:44:40.270 --> 00:44:43.360
that we are not missing out
in some other skill that

00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:46.977
may later to be important and
we may end up in some issues?

00:44:46.977 --> 00:44:48.310
This is a big issue that I face.

00:44:48.310 --> 00:44:50.268
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: Yeah,
that's a really good--

00:44:50.268 --> 00:44:52.600
so how do you develop
the best skill given

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:55.090
that you have limited
time to keep yourself

00:44:55.090 --> 00:44:56.290
current and moving forward?

00:44:56.290 --> 00:44:58.810
I mean, I'm going to come
back to it more crystal.

00:44:58.810 --> 00:45:02.920
But even with Girls With
Impact for me, I was in Davos

00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:08.050
and saw the trends and felt
like this also keeps me

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:10.314
personally at the
forefront of innovation

00:45:10.314 --> 00:45:11.480
and where things are headed.

00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:13.780
So for you, I
would be thinking--

00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:16.487
I would be looking at, what
do I actually like doing?

00:45:16.487 --> 00:45:18.070
I think you've got
to really like what

00:45:18.070 --> 00:45:20.470
you're doing because forget it.

00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:22.780
And then I would force
yourself to narrow it down

00:45:22.780 --> 00:45:24.640
to three to five of those.

00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.750
I really like these.

00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:28.220
Then I would
probably look at, OK,

00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:30.520
where are the trends
going, the skills that

00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:32.390
are going to be in demand?

00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:35.750
And you could-- you might know
that off the top of your head.

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:40.420
You could look at where Google
is placing money and training

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.670
or looking to buy up companies.

00:45:42.670 --> 00:45:44.410
That's a way of
doing that, right?

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:46.160
DANIELLE: A company who cares.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.690
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: To hardcore
research reports, right?

00:45:49.690 --> 00:45:51.970
Or where money is going,
so like cryptocurrency

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:53.950
is a big example.

00:45:53.950 --> 00:45:56.950
That would be sort of the other
way I would look at doing it.

00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:59.800
And then I would think
like, you could even

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:04.570
have a conversation with
somebody, like seeing could you

00:46:04.570 --> 00:46:08.650
apply, could you develop
a skill and apply it

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:12.265
to something that would be of
value here in a new effort?

00:46:12.265 --> 00:46:13.390
That's kind of interesting.

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:14.500
Because what does that do?

00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:17.650
You build your skill, you
increase your value potentially

00:46:17.650 --> 00:46:22.780
here, and you increase kind of
your potential monetary earning

00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:25.960
potential, and
then hopefully it's

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.964
kind of a skill
that's in demand.

00:46:28.964 --> 00:46:30.880
DANIELLE: Yeah, I think
that overlap with here

00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.690
you really have to
like it is such a key.

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:33.635
JENNIFER OPENSHAW:
I think you do.

00:46:33.635 --> 00:46:34.970
You have to really enjoy it.

00:46:34.970 --> 00:46:37.332
If you love models--

00:46:37.332 --> 00:46:38.290
I've got to share this.

00:46:38.290 --> 00:46:39.831
This is great and
then we'll wrap it.

00:46:39.831 --> 00:46:46.250
But I had this young woman
from another country who--

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:47.042
it's a great story.

00:46:47.042 --> 00:46:48.208
She ended up working for me.

00:46:48.208 --> 00:46:49.720
She works for my
husband now and she

00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.570
has her colleague who
frankly doesn't really

00:46:52.570 --> 00:46:54.670
speak much English, OK?

00:46:54.670 --> 00:46:58.750
But she is a math wizard.

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:02.680
I mean, they-- and by the
way, the CEO of this company--

00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:04.340
it's a division of
a large company,

00:47:04.340 --> 00:47:06.590
I mean very sophisticated.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:09.980
They have seen nothing of what
this girl has pulled together

00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:13.680
allowing them to see competitors
and where money is going.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:14.890
It's unbelievable.

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:18.220
So like for example,
that is a great example.

00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.400
If you were a genius
in one particular place

00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.850
and you liked it, I would
explore that and then go

00:47:24.850 --> 00:47:27.640
where the future
demand or the trends

00:47:27.640 --> 00:47:29.410
are going with things
that we're seeing

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:31.000
and we read about
in the headlines.

00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.100
DANIELLE: Yeah, double down on
the thing that you're good at.

00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:35.410
I've been on so many teams
where other people are

00:47:35.410 --> 00:47:37.680
more passionate maybe
in a particular area

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:39.430
and there's no way you
can compete, right?

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:40.510
Because they're talking
to their friends

00:47:40.510 --> 00:47:42.190
about that subject
in the evenings,

00:47:42.190 --> 00:47:44.980
they're doing something
about it on the weekends,

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.860
and here you are just trying to
recover from the week, right?

00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:49.570
So having that thing
you're interested in

00:47:49.570 --> 00:47:51.097
is so, so helpful.

00:47:51.097 --> 00:47:53.430
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: And set a
marker again even for that.

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:55.929
So OK, so it's not going to be
in the next two months maybe,

00:47:55.929 --> 00:47:58.390
but over the next year each
quarter I'm going to do x

00:47:58.390 --> 00:48:01.330
or I want to get a
certificate in x.

00:48:01.330 --> 00:48:03.049
Or if Google is really--

00:48:03.049 --> 00:48:04.840
let's just say they
were covering something

00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:08.080
or they wanted
something, maybe--

00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.660
it can make a difference
in putting you

00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.810
into a different role,
having a certain skill set.

00:48:12.810 --> 00:48:14.140
DANIELLE: Yeah, definitely.

00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.020
Well, thank you so
much for joining us.

00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:17.020
We really appreciate it.

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.307
If people here, on the
live stream, or on Youtube

00:48:19.307 --> 00:48:21.140
want to get involved
with Girls With Impact,

00:48:21.140 --> 00:48:21.800
how can they do that?

00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:23.966
JENNIFER OPENSHAW: Oh, so
I want and need all of you

00:48:23.966 --> 00:48:28.270
join us at Girls With Impact,
please, boys and girls.

00:48:28.270 --> 00:48:30.520
Look it, we are all
in this together.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:32.560
So you can either--

00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:34.330
just help amplify
what we're doing.

00:48:34.330 --> 00:48:35.710
Please go to Girls With Impact--

00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:37.240
we're going to
send out an email.

00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.790
You can play a role
in supporting a girl

00:48:39.790 --> 00:48:41.260
to go through the training.

00:48:41.260 --> 00:48:43.720
You could also, if you
want, mentor a girl.

00:48:43.720 --> 00:48:46.300
And we keep it pretty
flexible, not heavy duty

00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:48.820
because people are
all over the place.

00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:51.850
But it's a great way to
have a personal legacy

00:48:51.850 --> 00:48:54.760
and to really join us in
hopefully having a really

00:48:54.760 --> 00:48:56.080
big legacy.

00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:56.914
I hope you all will.
