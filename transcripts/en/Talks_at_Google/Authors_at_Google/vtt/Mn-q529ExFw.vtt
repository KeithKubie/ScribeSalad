00:00:00.416 --> 00:00:02.540
AL PITTAMPALLI: Welcome,
everybody.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:03.930
It's an honor to be here.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:06.370
I wanted to start off
with this story.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.740
Charles Duhigg has this great
story in his book "Power Of

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.280
Habit." It's about this guy.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.350
You might recognize this guy,
because this is Paul O'Neill.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.605
Paul O'neill was the former
Secretary of the Treasury.

00:00:17.605 --> 00:00:19.940
But what you might not know is
before Paul O'Neill was the

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.380
Secretary of the Treasury, was
the president of a company

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.370
called Alcoa.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.280
Alcoa is a big steel
manufacturer, and at the time,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.610
when he first came on board,
Alcoa wasn't doing too well.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.020
In fact, Alcoa was
floundering.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.440
So Paul O'Neill was supposed to
be the guy who was going to

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.650
turn the entire thing around.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.600
So at his very first investor's
meeting, investors

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.630
packed the room in high
anticipation, because they

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.420
wanted to know what this
guy had to say.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.540
What was his plan?

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.680
He was supposed to be this
savior to right this sip.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.850
So as Duhigg tells the
story, Paul O'Neill

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.840
comes up to the podium.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.470
It's this really dramatic
moment, and the audience is

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.530
waiting with baited breath.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.520
And Paul O'Neill says something
to this effect.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.550
He says, "Ladies and gentlemen,
today I want to

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.879
talk to you about
worker safety.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:07.260
Worker safety is going to be
the number one priority at

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.380
this company going forward."

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.240
And the audience is shocked.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.230
They're like, what is this
guy talking about?

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.050
I mean, we have real
problems here.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.910
We thought he was going to talk
about financials, and

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.730
profit margins, and bottom
line stuff, and here is

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.890
talking about something trivial
like worker safety.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:22.510
So they challenged him.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.180
They said, Paul, are you sure
you want to be talking about

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.300
worker safety right now?

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.870
And he says, I don't think you
understand me correctly.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.430
Worker safety is going to be
the number one priority at

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.470
this company going forward.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.020
And so the story goes, the
investors leave the room

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.790
thinking Paul O'Neill's crazy.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.930
They're calling up their
clients, telling them to dump

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.300
the stock, and all
this mayhem.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.540
So the question is, was
Paul O'Neill, in

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.510
fact, really crazy?

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.910
And the answer, if you
judge by results, is

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.530
a resounding no.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.610
It turns out over the course
of his tenure, Alcoa

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.080
experienced amazing growth.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.260
It was this remarkable
transformation story.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.810
It's actually one of the reasons
he became tapped to

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.280
become the Secretary
of the Treasury.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.290
So what did Paul O'Neill know
that no one else did?

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.240
Well, if you ask Charles Duhigg,
the answer is what he

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.810
calls the keystone habit.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.320
What a keystone habit is, it's
a habit that when you change

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.210
it, it has cascading
effects and changes

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:21.100
other habits as well.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.110
And what Paul O'Neill understood
about worker safety

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.500
is that when you fix worker
safety, when you work on

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.910
worker safety, there's all
these other things

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:29.630
that have to happen.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.870
When you focus on worker safety,
in order for that to

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.615
be good, you got to have good
communication between the

00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:36.180
staff and the managers.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.560
In order for worker safety to
be good, you have to be

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.370
innovative, and good problem
solving, and pay attention to

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.000
detail and processes.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.470
All things that are so
important for a steel

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.240
manufacturing company.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.640
So Paul we understood that the
worker safety had this

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.830
disproportionate impact.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.010
If they could focus on that,
they would create this

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.350
cascading effect across the
entire organization.

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.170
I tell you this story
for two reasons.

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.490
The first is because I think
meetings, like worker safety,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.250
is the ultimate keystone
habit in organizations.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.270
If you think about meetings,
what they are, they're at the

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:12.590
intersection of how we
communicate, how we

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.990
collaborate, how we make
decisions on the most

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:16.780
important issues of the day.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.880
So when we talk about meetings,
it's not just these

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.380
30 minutes things that are on
our calendar that we attend

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.280
every single day.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.180
What they are is an access
to changing the entire

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.635
organization, to change
the way we think and

00:03:27.635 --> 00:03:28.510
the way we do business.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.625
So I think that's important to
realize, and I do believe that

00:03:31.625 --> 00:03:32.950
this culture gets this.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.250
I mean, your CEO clearly
gets it.

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.250
Larry Page famously sent out
that memo when he first

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.490
started at Google, when he first
joined us the CEO, and I

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.460
think that this is a priority
of this company, so I really

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.150
feel privileged to
talk to you guys.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.450
The second reason I've told
you this story is because

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.490
that's the approach I
want to take today.

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.070
Rather than giving you an
entire map of radical

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.710
overhaul, which sometimes and
often fails, what I want to do

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:05.940
is just give you three specific
habits, three

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.020
specific behaviors, that are
actionable, that seem almost

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:12.330
simplistic, but have the
potential to have

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.360
disproportionate impact.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:18.220
By changing just these small,
little things, you'll create

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.899
cascading effects that might
actually change a lot of other

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:24.340
things, and ultimately
the culture.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.330
So that's what I want to do.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.990
I want to talk about these three
habits, but I also got

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.680
to talk about why I'm
prescribing these habits.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.280
I want to talk about the
forces that cause

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.340
meetings to be broken.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.930
So let's talk about the first
keystone habit, and then I'll

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.170
explain what it is or
why it's there.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:45.650
We want to identify one decision
owner before any

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.610
decision-oriented meeting
convenes.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.420
Sounds pretty simple.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.760
The key word as "before,"
by the way.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.470
And I'll explain that
in a moment here.

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.960
But the reason why this is so
effective and so important,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.980
because it's so rarely done,
is because of something we

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.000
call diffusion of
responsibility.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.620
This is my poster child for
diffusion of responsibility.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:05.360
This is a picture of
Parkland Memorial

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.330
Hospital in Dallas, Texas.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.940
One of the biggest hospitals
in the country.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:12.600
Last year, Parkland had this
problem, which is they

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.700
needed a new CEO.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:15.340
The past CEO had resigned.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.220
They needed a new one
to take their place.

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.010
This is a pretty big decision
for an organization.

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:22.900
So Parkland did what
you'd imagine any

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:24.680
organization would do.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.960
They called a meeting.

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.690
They got the entire board in a
room together, and they asked

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.056
this question, so what
are we going to do?

00:05:32.056 --> 00:05:34.510
Now that seems like the
right approach, right?

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.940
It seems like the smart
thing to do,

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.230
but there was a problem.

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.150
45 minutes into the 90 minute
meeting, they had no idea why

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.640
they were in the room.

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.560
They had no idea what
they're deciding.

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.290
They had no idea what the
action items were.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:49.630
So 45 minutes into the meeting,
somebody made a

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:50.060
suggestion.

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.540
They said, well, why don't we
hire an executive search firm?

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.150
Great idea.

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:55.420
They couldn't decide on
which firm to hire.

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.650
So someone else had
a brilliant idea.

00:05:56.650 --> 00:05:59.500
They said, why don't we hire a
consultant to help us hire the

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.440
executive search firm?

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.930
You didn't hear this wrong.

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.220
They were thinking about hiring
a consultant to hire a

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.970
consultant, which I think is
absurd, but they thought it

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.010
was pretty good idea.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.510
But they couldn't even decide
on what consultant to hire.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.250
So what they did was they
ended up appointing a

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.630
subcommittee to come up with a
list of five candidates of

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.190
potential consultants
that would be

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.220
reviewed at the next meeting.

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.620
And this sounds funny, right?

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.800
Because it's absurd.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.350
One of the things you can
do is you can blame the

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:27.900
individuals.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.260
And trust me, I have.

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:31.530
You can blame the individuals
in that meeting and say

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:33.650
there's something
wrong with them.

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:36.480
But when you see this, like I
have, across so many different

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.440
organizations, all across the
country-- the world, even--

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.280
you realize that there's
something else going on here.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.440
There's some social forces
at play here.

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.010
We know what some of the
social forces are.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:51.810
The entire field of social
psychology is dedicated to

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.060
these phenomena.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.910
Bibb Latane and John Darley did
these famous experiments--

00:06:57.910 --> 00:06:59.590
you probably know about them--

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.540
50 years ago.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.460
They were called smoke filled
room experiments.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.060
They'd get students into a room
together to take a test.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.060
The test was a guise, because
really what they did was they

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:12.930
were pumping smoke into the room
while they were taking

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:15.650
the test, trying to figure out
how long it would take them to

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:18.570
report what was supposed
to look like a fire.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:21.770
When they had one student in the
room, what they found was

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.560
the performance was fine.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:27.310
One person in room, about 75% of
the time or so, you got to

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:31.660
students report the fire in
a really timely basis.

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.480
What happens when you put just
two more people into the room?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:37.740
Performance drops
dramatically.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:41.730
You go from 75% of the time to
38% of the time students

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.920
report the fire.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.200
Almost a comical effect.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:46.660
You have the students with smoke
filling their eyes, and

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:49.330
they're crying, and they're
still not reporting this fire.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:52.410
And so we learn something from
that experiment, which is that

00:07:52.410 --> 00:07:55.130
groups are really good at
solving problems, but that is

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:57.060
not without exception.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.220
When responsibility is
ambiguous, groups can actually

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:06.190
perform abysmally, particularly
when we don't

00:08:06.190 --> 00:08:09.370
understand what the decision is,
what we're deciding, who

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:11.430
should be deciding.

00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.740
Think about what we do so
often in organizations.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.490
Whenever there's a problem,
whenever there's ambiguity on

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.440
what we should be doing, we get
into a room together and

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.090
try to sort it all out.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.280
And that's precisely what
the diffusion of

00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.500
responsibility wants.

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.640
It magnifies the effect, so we
end up doing nothing, or it

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.990
ends up taking a
very long time.

00:08:31.990 --> 00:08:34.530
Now if we drill down on this,
what we realize that one of

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.809
the primary, driving
forces behind

00:08:36.809 --> 00:08:39.110
this is social etiquette.

00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:40.990
We all have these social
boundaries around us.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:43.090
We hate breaking them.

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:44.630
You walk into an elevator,
everybody's

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:46.230
facing in one direction.

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:48.080
You don't dare face
the other way.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.120
We know this.

00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:54.720
In organizations that have clan,
communal cultures, flat

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.800
organizational structures, we
find this even more present,

00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.840
where everybody's equal
so it's hard to

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.440
really impose yourself.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:03.740
It's hard to own up
to a decision.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.540
It's hard to take responsibility
because we're

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:10.210
afraid of infringing on other
people's territory and stuff.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.850
So what are the consequences
of this?

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:13.160
Well.

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:15.410
We get massive delay.

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.860
A decision that should
take five

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:19.235
minutes takes five months.

00:09:19.235 --> 00:09:21.800
A decision that's supposed
to take one meeting

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.380
ends up taking 10.

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:27.350
We also get compromise, which
sometimes is good, but in a

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:30.340
world that's blending all
together, compromise decisions

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:32.740
often get ignored.

00:09:32.740 --> 00:09:35.790
Designed by committee often
leads to horrible things that

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.440
we don't want.

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.670
So we need to figure out how we
can solve this diffusion of

00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:43.370
responsibility problem.

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:47.040
Well, what we know is that
leadership is the antidote to

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:51.110
the bystander effect, and that's
why decision owner is

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.890
so important.

00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.550
When someone stands up, it
breaks the force field.

00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:59.880
We all know, for example, when
you're on a subway car, and

00:09:59.880 --> 00:10:02.640
there's a panhandler, and they
might do a good performance.

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.990
And everybody wants to give, but
nobody does because nobody

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:06.390
else is giving.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.035
We all know what happens
when one person gives.

00:10:08.035 --> 00:10:10.085
When one person gives, the force
field is broken, and

00:10:10.085 --> 00:10:11.330
then everyone gives.

00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:13.370
By the way, panhandlers have
gotten really smart.

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.550
If they worked in pairs, they
get a confederate to be the

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:17.900
first one that gives, and
that starts the process.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.580
Well, we can do the same thing,
and that's why this

00:10:21.580 --> 00:10:24.270
idea of making sure that we
have a decision owner-- an

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.520
explicit decision owner--

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.060
before we get into the room
has cascading effects.

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.750
If we have a decision owner,
we have accountability.

00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:33.010
If we have accountability,
we're going

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:34.300
to clarify the decision.

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:37.420
If we clarify the decision,
then we know what decision

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:40.690
we're making, and we can
actually make it.

00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.600
And the key word here, like I
alluded to before, is the word

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:47.660
"before." It has to happen
before we get into the room,

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.060
because if we wait until we get
into the room to decide

00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:52.550
who's the decision owner, we're
already in the matrix.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:54.450
We've already lost the game,
because we've already

00:10:54.450 --> 00:10:58.440
succumbed to the diffuse
of responsibility.

00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.590
The second keystone habit that
I want to talk about is this

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:05.310
idea of replacing meetings
with the one-on-one

00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.830
conversations.

00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:08.670
Not all meetings, by the way.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.060
But I don't even call one-on-one
conversations

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:13.770
"meetings." I think they're
fundamentally different than

00:11:13.770 --> 00:11:16.180
what we traditionally
think of as meeting.

00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:18.650
So what's the impetus
for this?

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:20.210
Well, it's this idea that--

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:21.670
some of you are probably
familiar with this-- it's the

00:11:21.670 --> 00:11:23.490
idea of the tragedy
of the commons.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:26.070
Tragedy of the commons
is a parable which

00:11:26.070 --> 00:11:27.980
I'll share with you.

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.270
Eight farmer's share
this plot of land.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.470
That's how they make
their livelihood.

00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:35.380
They allow the cows to
graze, and that's how

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:36.160
they make their living.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:39.270
Well, these farmers have it
short term problem and a long

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.680
term problem.

00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.440
Long term problem is obvious.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:45.920
If too many cows are allowed to
graze the grass, then the

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.850
grass is ruined for everyone,
and no former wants that.

00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:53.750
But there's the short term
problem faced by each

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:54.470
individual farmer.

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.700
It's a little bit less obvious,
but it's actually

00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:57.400
more interesting.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.500
And that individual
dilemma is this.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.320
If I'm one of the farmers, I'm
thinking to myself, well, I

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:04.480
know I'm not supposed to have
one more cow in the grass, but

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.740
if I did, I would get all the
benefits of that cow, but

00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:11.150
everybody else would have
to share the cost.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:15.340
That asymmetry is a pretty
irresistible deal, and so what

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:17.700
happens is farmers
end up taking it.

00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:20.430
And if one farmer does it,
every farmer does it.

00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:23.990
And so what ends up happening
is one, two, three more cows

00:12:23.990 --> 00:12:27.040
for every one, and the reason
why the tragedy of the commons

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:30.120
is a tragedy is because farmers
end up working in

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.420
their selfish, short term
interest at the expense of the

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:35.790
long term interests
of the group.

00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:37.780
Now this is a widely known
social phenomenon.

00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:39.690
We see this in overfishing.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:40.670
We see this in pollution.

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:42.780
I would argue we see this
right here in the

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.700
organization.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:50.000
Because if you think about how
a meeting works so often,

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.250
let's say I call a meeting of
eight people for one hour,

00:12:53.250 --> 00:12:57.110
well, I get eight hours of
productivity from the people

00:12:57.110 --> 00:13:01.570
in that room, and I only have
to spend one hour myself.

00:13:01.570 --> 00:13:03.840
That's a pretty irresistible
deal.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:05.760
It's one that's easy
to exploit.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.270
I'm not saying that people
do is intentionally or

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:11.735
nefariously, but it happens,
and we have to realize that

00:13:11.735 --> 00:13:13.180
that is going to create
a problem.

00:13:13.180 --> 00:13:15.600
It's going to create a system
where you have tons and tons

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.590
of meetings, and that's
what happens.

00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.860
I call it the tragedy
of the calendar.

00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.200
That's why I talk to
organizations all the time,

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:24.270
and this is what people's
calendars look like, and it's

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:26.990
largely because this
phenomena.

00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:31.560
I think that one of the reasons
the justification for

00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:35.015
this is something that
isn't talked about.

00:13:35.015 --> 00:13:36.250
Especially in hierarchical

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.020
organizations, it's almost assumed.

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:39.510
And I think we should talk
about the justification

00:13:39.510 --> 00:13:41.430
because I think it's
a justification.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.090
I don't think it makes
mathematical sense.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:46.610
And what that justification
is, is if you're in a big

00:13:46.610 --> 00:13:49.450
organization, the people higher
up the food chain will

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:50.680
say, hey, listen--

00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:52.390
off the record, they
say, well, listen.

00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:54.460
My time is extremely valuable.

00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:56.490
and I need to do
this sometimes.

00:13:56.490 --> 00:13:58.830
If it takes me five hours
to write a memo, that's

00:13:58.830 --> 00:13:59.970
not good for me.

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.500
It might be advantageous for the
organization if I can get

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:06.510
people in a room together
and use their

00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:07.610
time instead of mine.

00:14:07.610 --> 00:14:09.100
They won't say it that way,
but that's kind of the

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:10.510
implicit justification.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:12.670
And I'm going to argue that
that is the wrong

00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:15.030
justification, because
let's look at the

00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:18.300
extreme of that example.

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:20.280
Who has the most expensive
time in the world?

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:21.840
Who's got the move valuable
time in the world?

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.630
I would argue it's
the President

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.400
of the United States.

00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:25.920
It turns out that the President
of the United

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:30.720
States, every morning since, I
think, 1947, has received this

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:34.030
report, which is the President's
Daily Briefing.

00:14:34.030 --> 00:14:39.720
It's a report of the day's
intelligence, and this report

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.860
corresponds with the meeting
that follows it.

00:14:42.860 --> 00:14:43.690
Most of the time.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.700
Most times, you have a meeting
that follows it where you

00:14:45.700 --> 00:14:47.170
discuss the report.

00:14:47.170 --> 00:14:49.540
Well, there's one present a
particular, which is the

00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.410
George W. Bush--

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:52.980
I'm not picking on anybody
politically here, but this

00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:54.120
happens to be factual--

00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.640
that George W. Bush didn't
want to read the memo

00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.290
beforehand.

00:14:57.290 --> 00:15:00.220
He actually showed up to the
meeting and preferred that he

00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:02.010
be briefed in person.

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:05.460
So the first 15, 20 minutes of
the meeting or so was spent

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:10.170
actually, orally briefing the
President on what was already

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.440
in this memo.

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.460
You think to yourself, if
anybody could justify this,

00:15:14.460 --> 00:15:16.330
it's the President of
the United States.

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:18.280
It's the person who's got the
most valuable time in the

00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.270
world where we're trying
to maximize his time.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.130
But then you think
to yourself, who

00:15:23.130 --> 00:15:24.830
else is in that meeting?

00:15:24.830 --> 00:15:27.410
And it turns out the other
people in that meeting are the

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:33.300
top of the top CIA officials,
Top of the CIA, and Department

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:34.120
of Defense.

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:36.110
I mean, these are the people
that have the second most

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.110
valuable time in the world.

00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:40.280
And that's why this
justification doesn't work,

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.120
because if you think about
relatively speaking, the

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:47.220
people we have meetings with
are people who have similar

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:50.260
valuable time as we do.

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:54.030
So the consequences of this is
you get, like we said, tons of

00:15:54.030 --> 00:15:57.280
meetings that are
often one sided.

00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:58.920
You go into a meeting sometimes,
you feel like, wow,

00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:00.550
that was a waste of my time.

00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:03.560
And you were right, because
it was intended that way.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.000
And we need to fix this.

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.270
We need to stand up and realize
that although this

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:10.020
happens, and implicitly, it's
not the way that an

00:16:10.020 --> 00:16:11.850
organization should run.

00:16:11.850 --> 00:16:14.710
So the question is,
how do we fix it?

00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:18.590
Well, in the example of the
tragedy of the commons with

00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:22.490
the farmer parable, one of the
things you can do is you

00:16:22.490 --> 00:16:25.810
separate the plot of land into
eight separate plots, because

00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:27.680
what you're trying to do is
you're trying to fix this

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.310
asymmetry problem.

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:33.120
If each individual farmer has
his own plot, what happens is

00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:37.200
that every cow now that I let
onto the grass, I get all the

00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.530
benefits, but I also
share the costs.

00:16:40.530 --> 00:16:42.590
Well, what's the equivalent
in the organization?

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:45.270
Well, the answer is the
one-on-one conversation.

00:16:45.270 --> 00:16:48.570
The one-on-one conversation's
an amazing tool, because

00:16:48.570 --> 00:16:49.955
unlike a meeting, it's
really personal.

00:16:49.955 --> 00:16:50.790
It's direct.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:53.040
It's free from group think.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.520
But the other great thing about
a conversation is it's

00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:57.450
beautifully symmetrical.

00:16:57.450 --> 00:17:00.270
I spend one hour, you
spend one hour.

00:17:00.270 --> 00:17:03.610
And this reduces the incentives
of the meeting, or

00:17:03.610 --> 00:17:05.109
the tragedy of the
commons effect.

00:17:05.109 --> 00:17:08.960
So I think we need to switch to
one-on-one conversations as

00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:10.630
the primary fuel.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:13.300
Not to say that we can do
everything that way, but a lot

00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:16.319
of meetings we can do as
one-on-one conversations.

00:17:16.319 --> 00:17:21.890
And that produces amazing,
cascading effects because when

00:17:21.890 --> 00:17:24.400
you use one-on-one
conversations, you're forced

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.450
to think really hard about
who you're having these

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.050
conversations with.

00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.390
Because now instead of using the
meeting as this weapon of

00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:33.950
mass interruption, where you
get eight people in a room

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:37.140
together and it's easy for you,
try having the eight one

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:38.900
hour conversations
with people.

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.690
It's not as easy.

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:41.230
So there's friction.

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.300
It improves the quality of the
conversations, and it reduces

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:46.240
the quantity.

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:49.370
And that creates a culture
that's free from interruption,

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:52.370
or where there's less
interruption.

00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:55.130
Final keystone habit, and then
I want to move into the

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:57.390
question and answer.

00:17:57.390 --> 00:18:01.760
Make all standing meetings
tentative.

00:18:01.760 --> 00:18:04.010
So what that means is that
any standing meeting, any

00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:07.870
regularly occurring meeting,
does not exist unless we

00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:10.720
initiate it every single time.

00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:13.840
I'll concede that sometimes
maybe you want to have a

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.260
regular meeting, and you can
carve out time with your team

00:18:17.260 --> 00:18:18.630
where there might
be a meeting.

00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:22.240
But every week before
that meeting meets,

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.160
it's got to be initiated.

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:25.160
The default should
be no meeting.

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:27.950
And the reason why this is
so crucial, and why this

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:31.890
specific, small habit has
disproportionate impact, is

00:18:31.890 --> 00:18:34.270
something I call meeting
institutionalization.

00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:38.012
The meeting has become
this institution.

00:18:38.012 --> 00:18:40.220
A great example is with NASA.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:43.250
I did some work with NASA, who
were brilliant, by the way,

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.750
and great folks.

00:18:44.750 --> 00:18:47.680
But one of the groups I worked
with, they have this meeting

00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.560
that they have every
single week.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.230
It's called the ICB meeting.

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:52.890
The Internal Control
Board meeting is

00:18:52.890 --> 00:18:53.490
what they call them.

00:18:53.490 --> 00:18:55.020
And it's a very important
thing.

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:59.440
They spend a lot of time making
sure that we're talking

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:01.100
about the right things,
but there's

00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:02.180
problems with that meeting.

00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.190
They go on too long.

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:06.820
There's too many things
that are discussed.

00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.220
And I interviewed some
people beforehand.

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:11.285
I said, what's the purpose
of this meeting?

00:19:11.285 --> 00:19:13.790
And no one can really give
me a clear answer.

00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:17.380
They say, well, it changes all
the time, and it's kind of

00:19:17.380 --> 00:19:18.520
difficult to explain.

00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.345
And then I said, well, if you
don't know what the purpose

00:19:21.345 --> 00:19:22.690
is, why don't you
get rid of it?

00:19:22.690 --> 00:19:23.610
And the gasped.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:26.350
I mean, they almost threw
me out of the room.

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:29.020
I'm kidding, they're
wonderful people

00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:32.680
But they couldn't even fathom
the idea of getting rid of

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:33.812
this thing.

00:19:33.812 --> 00:19:34.930
I'm not saying they
should have.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:36.570
I just said, why don't
you consider it?

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:39.470
And the reality is it was clear
to me that this meeting

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:40.700
was no longer a meeting.

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:42.780
It was an institution.

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:46.080
See, the meeting is supposed
to be this tool, right?

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:48.710
You start out with a problem,
and you say, OK, is the

00:19:48.710 --> 00:19:50.750
meeting the right tool
to fix this problem?

00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:51.650
Maybe it's email.

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:53.160
Email is another tool.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:55.540
But that's not what happens
very often.

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.480
What happens often is we start
with the meeting, and we say,

00:19:58.480 --> 00:20:01.250
OK, what problems do we
fix at the meeting?

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:02.580
That's what was happening
with the Internal

00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:03.410
Control Board meeting.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.030
Every week they had this
question, which is what do we

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:07.640
need to talk about
at this meeting?

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.480
And this backwards
justification

00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:12.130
creates a lot of problems.

00:20:12.130 --> 00:20:14.650
It creates what I call
the CNN problem.

00:20:14.650 --> 00:20:16.410
CNN has this problem.

00:20:16.410 --> 00:20:18.820
They need 24 hours of
news every single

00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:20.176
day, no matter what.

00:20:20.176 --> 00:20:23.060
What happens on the day where
there is no news?

00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.190
That's when you see stories
about cats.

00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:26.426
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:26.426 --> 00:20:28.630
AL PITTAMPALLI: The stories
about otters that they taught

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:29.285
to play basketball.

00:20:29.285 --> 00:20:34.070
Which is adorable, by the
way, but it's not news.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:36.780
But that's what happens when
the meeting becomes an

00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:39.290
institution and you
backwards justify.

00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.350
You end up talking about trivial
things or things that

00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:45.070
you wouldn't otherwise talk
about if you had started the

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:46.820
other way around.

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.780
Now the interesting thing is
this is not a phenomenon we

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:51.770
see, for example, in email.

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.740
Email's another tool, but we
don't see this phenomenon

00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:55.080
really often in email.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.770
And I think the reason
is because meetings

00:20:57.770 --> 00:20:59.720
are a social event.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.940
And social events get
ritualized, and if you're not

00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:05.230
careful, they get
institutionalized.

00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:08.270
A great example of this is
the State of the Union.

00:21:08.270 --> 00:21:09.130
Which I love, by the way.

00:21:09.130 --> 00:21:10.735
I mean, I'm a geek, I
love watching the

00:21:10.735 --> 00:21:11.350
State of the Union.

00:21:11.350 --> 00:21:14.430
But the reality is most people
don't know that before the

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.820
State of the Union was
this big, live

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.490
address, it was a memo.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.870
For the longest amount of time,
the President wrote the

00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:24.520
State of the Union, and he
sent it out to Congress.

00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.110
And somewhere along the way--

00:21:27.110 --> 00:21:29.400
I forget when it was, I think
50 or 60 years ago-- they

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.630
started doing it at
this live address.

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:35.070
It was easy to go from that
memo to meeting, but it's

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:38.370
almost impossible to go from the
meeting back to the memo.

00:21:38.370 --> 00:21:40.530
Because now when you think of
State of the Union, it's

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.030
synonymous with meeting.

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.580
We can't even think of
the State of the

00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:45.440
Union without the meeting.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.340
If you propose to somebody, you
say, hey, maybe we should

00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:52.350
go back to a memo, they're going
to think that you are

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.030
committing treason.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:54.490
They think that you want to get
rid of the State of the

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:57.510
Union altogether, because they
can't fathom it as a memo.

00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:59.190
And that's what happens when
the meeting becomes

00:21:59.190 --> 00:22:02.530
institutionalized, and we have
to be careful of that.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.930
So the reason why we want to
make all standing meetings

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:09.230
tentative is because we want
to start the process of

00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:11.320
deinstitutionalizing
the meeting.

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.150
This is just one small way to do
it, because if every single

00:22:15.150 --> 00:22:18.530
week, like if it's a weekly
meeting, and every single week

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:20.920
somebody has to initiate
the meeting--

00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.390
it's on the calendar, but unless
somebody stands up and

00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:26.540
says, we should have this
meeting, it doesn't exist--

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:28.110
well, then you have
this problem.

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:31.290
Which is somebody has to put
themselves on the line, and

00:22:31.290 --> 00:22:34.450
somebody has to justify this
meeting's existence every

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:35.870
single time.

00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:38.410
It may be a formality.

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:39.420
You may still have
the meeting.

00:22:39.420 --> 00:22:42.100
But at least you have some
accountability, and you have

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.320
this sense that there is a
purpose to this meeting.

00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.450
A meeting is a form, it's
not a function.

00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:55.095
So these are the three
keystone habits.

00:22:55.095 --> 00:22:57.540
They're not the only habits, but
they're a really great way

00:22:57.540 --> 00:23:01.130
to make a huge dent
in the culture.

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.950
Because remember, all that
culture is, is it's a

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:05.300
collection of habits.

00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.910
It's a collection of the way
people think and the way

00:23:07.910 --> 00:23:09.400
people behave.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:12.590
And the greatest thing, I think,
about meetings is that

00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:15.700
they're the perfect
marketing tool.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.020
It's a viral phenomenon.

00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:21.285
You cannot have meetings
without other people.

00:23:21.285 --> 00:23:24.280
It sounds daunting to change an
entire department or entire

00:23:24.280 --> 00:23:27.880
organization, but just focus on
your corner of the world.

00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.360
Focus on meetings
that you have.

00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:31.190
Focus on the meetings
that you attend.

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:35.130
Try to change those, because
if you do, there's a chance

00:23:35.130 --> 00:23:36.530
that it might spread.

00:23:36.530 --> 00:23:40.760
And when habits spread, that's
how cultures change.

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.950
Well, thank you to listen to the
presentation part of this.

00:23:43.950 --> 00:23:45.800
I'd love to take
some questions.

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.650
Yes?

00:23:50.650 --> 00:23:53.317
AUDIENCE: Sometimes the
difficulty is in trying to get

00:23:53.317 --> 00:23:55.015
a decision maker in the room.

00:23:55.015 --> 00:23:59.380
For whatever reason, they're not
available, or originally

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:02.744
they said they would make it,
and they can't make it, or

00:24:02.744 --> 00:24:03.680
something like that.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.991
How do you address that?

00:24:05.991 --> 00:24:10.140
AL PITTAMPALLI: Well, I think
that's why making it explicit

00:24:10.140 --> 00:24:11.330
is really important.

00:24:11.330 --> 00:24:13.445
First of all, let's distinguish
decision maker

00:24:13.445 --> 00:24:16.710
form decision owner.

00:24:16.710 --> 00:24:20.820
I like the term "decision owner"
because it implies that

00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.540
that person could be the
decision maker, but he doesn't

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:24.830
necessarily have to be
a decision maker.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:27.670
So for example, I know one of
the Google creeds is to strive

00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:30.890
for consensus, which is
important, and I think that's

00:24:30.890 --> 00:24:33.580
usually a good thing.

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:36.750
So a decision owner can say,
I'm not the decision

00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:37.700
maker in this case.

00:24:37.700 --> 00:24:40.260
What I am is I'm kind
of the conduit.

00:24:40.260 --> 00:24:42.520
We're going to decide this
by group consensus.

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:45.820
And if a consensus can't be
reached, then I become the

00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.300
unilateral decision maker.

00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:51.800
The other thing about decision
owner is there's

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:52.480
no bones about it.

00:24:52.480 --> 00:24:54.360
You own the decision.

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.460
It's kind of this territorial
phenomenon

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:57.910
that is really important.

00:24:57.910 --> 00:25:01.550
And the reason why making it
explicit is really important

00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:04.710
is because as soon as you become
the decision owner, you

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:07.690
can't even dream of not being
at the meeting where this is

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:09.330
being talked about.

00:25:09.330 --> 00:25:11.070
Because you're the decision
owner, how are

00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:12.490
you not at that meeting?

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:16.070
So it's this framing problem
that we're creating for that

00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:20.750
person, and so way before the
decision even happens, we need

00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:22.240
to figure out, OK,
who is the owner?

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.990
Who's a person, for all intents
and purposes, is

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:27.400
responsible for making
this decision?

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.920
Which is a great time to talk
about it, because the further

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:34.020
you are away from the actual
decision, the less anxious

00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.830
people are, the less afraid
people are of taking

00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:36.830
responsibility.

00:25:36.830 --> 00:25:40.070
So if you catch people in the
very beginning and make sure

00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:44.710
that they sign their name as a
decision owner, well, now you

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:47.240
have some accountability, it's
going to be way easier to get

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:48.507
that person involved.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.930
Yes?

00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.894
AUDIENCE: What are your thoughts
on the value that--

00:25:55.894 --> 00:25:59.846
like for example, my team
[INAUDIBLE] we just talk about

00:25:59.846 --> 00:26:06.268
[INAUDIBLE], and there's
often [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:06.268 --> 00:26:07.518
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:10.220 --> 00:26:13.678
why not somebody else
[INAUDIBLE] something that

00:26:13.678 --> 00:26:15.654
[INAUDIBLE]

00:26:15.654 --> 00:26:20.300
the idea of always
[INAUDIBLE].

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:22.480
AL PITTAMPALLI: Well,
there's two things.

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:28.050
The first is I think that those
type of typical kind of

00:26:28.050 --> 00:26:30.470
staff status meetings, we might
call them or something,

00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:32.450
the one thing that's
clear to me is that

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.860
they should be optional.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:38.320
I understand there's value to
these types of meetings, but

00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:42.540
as we learn from, for example,
Susan Cain's book, "Quiet,"

00:26:42.540 --> 00:26:44.390
that there are different
type of people.

00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:46.600
There are introverts, there
are extroverts.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.330
People are creative differently,
people are

00:26:48.330 --> 00:26:50.195
productive differently.

00:26:50.195 --> 00:26:52.400
An introvert, for example,
might not want

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:54.490
to attend the meeting.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.350
Maybe it might be more
beneficial for them just to

00:26:56.350 --> 00:26:59.860
stay in their pod and just do
work during that time and not

00:26:59.860 --> 00:27:01.040
be interrupted.

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:05.130
And so I don't know if it's
beneficial to force people to

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:08.730
come to the meeting if they
don't want to be there, so I

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:12.160
think the first step is
to make them optional.

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:14.950
Because the reality is whether
we force people or not, the

00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:19.720
presumption in organizations,
the implicit contract, is

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.580
you're coming to the meeting.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.690
If I invite you, you
got to come.

00:27:22.690 --> 00:27:24.520
It's almost like being
subpoenaed

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:25.540
to testify in court.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.990
It's like punishable
by jail time.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:31.150
That's usually the kind of
ethos in an organization.

00:27:31.150 --> 00:27:35.350
The other thing is
I agree that--

00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:38.450
this is kind of an indirect way
to answer your question--

00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:43.500
which is that the term
"collaboration" is almost

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.840
meaningless now.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:49.470
It's virtually a meaningless
word because we don't know

00:27:49.470 --> 00:27:54.080
exactly what we mean or
what we talk about.

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:56.590
one of people's objections is
always, well, meetings are a

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.340
great collaborative tool.

00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.840
Now you come into a room, you
rub elbows with people,

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.500
there's all these ideas, and
there might be some type of

00:28:04.500 --> 00:28:07.040
spark of inspiration, or
creativity, or some overlap

00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.740
that will get us for me
to be more productive.

00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:11.660
And that's valid.

00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.020
That's a valid concern, but
there's millions of different

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:16.540
types of collaboration.

00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:20.040
There's indirect collaboration
where you go into a room, and

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:22.370
you brainstorm, and somebody
kind of gets

00:28:22.370 --> 00:28:24.110
some idea out of something.

00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:26.080
But then there's the direct
collaboration where you go

00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:28.480
into room, and like a writer
and an editor, you give

00:28:28.480 --> 00:28:31.210
somebody an idea, and you say,
hey, what's my feedback on

00:28:31.210 --> 00:28:33.710
this

00:28:33.710 --> 00:28:35.660
I guess what I'm saying-- this
is a circuitous way of

00:28:35.660 --> 00:28:38.310
saying-- that we need to figure
out what exactly we're

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.390
aiming for here.

00:28:39.390 --> 00:28:42.350
So if you invite people into a
status meeting for the hope

00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:45.600
that there's going to be some
collisions, there might be

00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.780
better ways to do that.

00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:49.140
I mean, an asynchronous
collaboration tool in the

00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:51.360
cloud, which you guys are
really good at, that

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:55.010
oftentimes yields more of those
types of collisions.

00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:56.880
Sometimes it can be the
in-person meetings.

00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:57.400
I don't know.

00:28:57.400 --> 00:29:01.080
But the answer is we have to
design these meetings and

00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:05.470
these sessions with a purpose
in mind, and the accidental

00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:08.280
phenomenon I don't think is a
really good justification

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:11.020
because there's always
an opportunity cost.

00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:14.710
It's a really expensive way
to deal with some of these

00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:17.590
problems, so you've got
to just do a kind of a

00:29:17.590 --> 00:29:19.115
cost-benefit analysis.

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:26.875
AUDIENCE: How do you feel about
letting people from

00:29:26.875 --> 00:29:29.785
doing stuff on their laptops
during meetings?

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.850
AL PITTAMPALLI: I think that
all laptop should be out of

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:40.370
the room, unless there's
a real specific--

00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:44.130
I mean, you guys are obviously
technology companies, so you

00:29:44.130 --> 00:29:47.980
guys may take notes on laptops
and stuff like that, so for

00:29:47.980 --> 00:29:51.370
this culture, that might
be kind of heresy.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:54.230
For example, I did a training
for some folks at one of these

00:29:54.230 --> 00:29:57.900
Fortune 500 organizations.

00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:01.570
And I had a little tray outside,
and before they came

00:30:01.570 --> 00:30:05.450
in, we literally confiscated
their phones, and their

00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:09.750
laptops, and all their
electronic devices.

00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:11.200
And I can get away with that
because that's kind of my

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.480
shtick and stuff.

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:15.090
I'm not saying that's exactly
what you should be doing, but

00:30:15.090 --> 00:30:15.830
you should think about it.

00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:20.100
Because one of the things that
does is it sends a signal.

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:22.320
It may do nothing else but just
send a signal that this

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:23.930
is a different type
of meeting.

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:26.010
When you come into this room,
we're actually going to do

00:30:26.010 --> 00:30:28.420
business, we're going to talk
about important stuff, we're

00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:30.940
not going to get distracted, and
the goal is to get out of

00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.215
this room as quickly
as possible.

00:30:33.215 --> 00:30:35.920
If we can do this in 20 minutes
instead of 60 minutes,

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.810
let's do it.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:39.960
And so one of the things I think
we need to do as meeting

00:30:39.960 --> 00:30:42.760
facilitators and leaders is send
these signals to people

00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:44.590
to make sure that they
understand that this is a

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:46.620
different type of meeting.

00:30:46.620 --> 00:30:49.210
And so that's kind of
one way to do that.

00:30:49.210 --> 00:30:51.580
But if it's not a problem,
it's not a problem.

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:55.700
If it is, you know,
confiscate.

00:30:55.700 --> 00:30:58.693
AUDIENCE: Do you make any kind
of distinction between

00:30:58.693 --> 00:31:03.112
meetings and brainstorming
sessions which, you know, you

00:31:03.112 --> 00:31:06.256
get an email like, hey, all
get into this room and

00:31:06.256 --> 00:31:07.252
brainstorm about this.

00:31:07.252 --> 00:31:11.236
And of course it looks exactly
like a meeting [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:11.236 --> 00:31:12.990
is.

00:31:12.990 --> 00:31:15.635
[INAUDIBLE] something different,
but a lot of times,

00:31:15.635 --> 00:31:18.363
because there's no owner of
the brainstorming session

00:31:18.363 --> 00:31:22.131
[INAUDIBLE] any kind of
[INAUDIBLE] just, bleh.

00:31:22.131 --> 00:31:25.160
AL PITTAMPALLI: It's
a great question.

00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.980
I realize I'm supposed to be
repeating these questions.

00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:31.210
He asked about the difference
between a meeting and a

00:31:31.210 --> 00:31:33.270
brainstorm.

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:38.020
One of the things that I think
we've failed at is to

00:31:38.020 --> 00:31:41.420
distinguish different
types of meetings.

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.730
Just like I said that
collaboration, that word is

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:46.930
virtually meaningless, so is
the word "meeting." We call

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:47.640
everything a meeting.

00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:49.470
I mean, is this a meeting?

00:31:49.470 --> 00:31:51.560
I went to one of these
conferences they spoke at and

00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.580
like a lot of people at it.

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:53.650
They call those meetings.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:55.800
The people who plan
those meetings are

00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:56.860
called meeting planners.

00:31:56.860 --> 00:31:59.580
So we just have this horrible
vocabulary when it comes to

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.600
meetings, so one of the
things I do my book--

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:03.910
not enough of, but I
do it in my work--

00:32:03.910 --> 00:32:06.190
is distinguishing what are
these different type of

00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:09.540
sessions called, and what are
the corresponding purposes?

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:12.170
So when you think about
brainstorms, for example,

00:32:12.170 --> 00:32:14.750
brainstorms are very different
than what I would think of as

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.130
a traditional meeting.

00:32:16.130 --> 00:32:18.990
I think meetings are
about reducing

00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:20.740
and coming to decisions.

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:21.700
Brainstorms are the opposite.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.980
They're about imagination and
actually generating a lot of

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:25.730
possibilities and options.

00:32:25.730 --> 00:32:30.800
But to your point, if I'm
walking down the hall, and I

00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:32.840
see in the conference room, I
can't tell whether you're

00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.860
doing a meeting or
a brainstorm.

00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:36.570
That's a problem.

00:32:36.570 --> 00:32:39.390
One of the corollaries to that
is that when we think about

00:32:39.390 --> 00:32:42.460
problem solving, we
usually try to do

00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.160
both at the same time.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.860
Like if you're a writer, for
example, and you're a

00:32:46.860 --> 00:32:49.730
productive writer, every
productive writer usually

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.440
knows that you can't write and
edit at the same time.

00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:55.190
If you try to come up with a lot
of stuff and edit at same

00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:56.840
time, you're going to
end up with nothing.

00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:00.820
But that's how we approach
problem solving a lot times.

00:33:00.820 --> 00:33:02.550
We try to come up with a lot
of options, and at the same

00:33:02.550 --> 00:33:03.880
time we try to delete them.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.170
So I say let's have the
brainstorm, the first part of

00:33:07.170 --> 00:33:10.730
the problem solving, phase where
you just generate a lot

00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:13.700
of options, and then the second
phase is the meeting

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:16.120
where we traditionally
reduce the options

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:17.030
and come to a decision.

00:33:17.030 --> 00:33:19.730
It doesn't always work that
clean, but we should ideally

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:21.290
separate those two.

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:24.480
And we should organize the
session in a way that lends

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.030
itself to those things.

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:28.120
So if we organize a brainstorm,
we should make

00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.050
sure that people are active.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:32.320
Take a page from IDEO.

00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.660
IDEO's the best brainstorming
company

00:33:34.660 --> 00:33:35.670
in the world, arguably.

00:33:35.670 --> 00:33:39.140
You guys might be the second,
third, I don't know.

00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:41.930
What they do is they have
Post-its all over the place.

00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:48.070
They're active, they're up,
they're all over the place.

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:51.470
Just visually, if you look at
what they're doing, it's just

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:56.060
very different than what most
of corporate America does.

00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:59.860
So I think let's not even call
them the same thing.

00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:03.820
Let's distinguish the two and
organize them in a way that

00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:05.156
serves their function.

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:12.300
AUDIENCE: Sort of on that same
point further, sometimes

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:15.230
there's value in holding certain
types of meetings in

00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.754
other places.

00:34:15.754 --> 00:34:18.610
So if this is a conference room
where we have certain

00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:21.469
types of meetings, like a
brainstorming session might

00:34:21.469 --> 00:34:24.679
always be done in a different
kind of room, a specific place

00:34:24.679 --> 00:34:27.175
where people sort of mentally
attach, that that's where you

00:34:27.175 --> 00:34:28.210
to brainstorm.

00:34:28.210 --> 00:34:29.810
Maybe it's all whiteboards
or--

00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:31.440
AL PITTAMPALLI: Yeah.

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.989
I think that's absolutely
right.

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:37.210
Basically you're trying to get
people to stop filtering.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:40.219
We're filtering every single
day, in every single meeting.

00:34:40.219 --> 00:34:42.889
We're watching what we say.

00:34:42.889 --> 00:34:44.560
We're watching what
we even think.

00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:49.960
And so anything you can do to
anchor people to a different

00:34:49.960 --> 00:34:51.860
emotional state is
really good.

00:34:51.860 --> 00:34:53.070
That's why offsites
work really well.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:56.780
You take somebody up to a
resort or a cabin in the

00:34:56.780 --> 00:34:59.150
county, they're probably going
to be more creative because

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:01.260
the culture's different, the
environment is different.

00:35:01.260 --> 00:35:03.930
I mean, we can't always go to an
offsite, but we can do that

00:35:03.930 --> 00:35:04.540
in the organization.

00:35:04.540 --> 00:35:07.880
We can have a separate room
dedicated to brainstorming.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.620
We can organize the
room differently.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.160
These are all things that really
promote creativity.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.123
I believe that.

00:35:16.123 --> 00:35:19.052
AUDIENCE: I think to follow up
a little bit on what you said

00:35:19.052 --> 00:35:21.615
about bringing laptops to
meetings, I sometimes find

00:35:21.615 --> 00:35:26.281
that if I'm invited to say, an
hour long sync up meeting that

00:35:26.281 --> 00:35:30.193
is maybe two minutes [INAUDIBLE]
actually have

00:35:30.193 --> 00:35:31.905
anything to do with me.

00:35:31.905 --> 00:35:35.328
But rather than like-- there's
like social pressure to go.

00:35:35.328 --> 00:35:40.080
So I would typically rather
bring my laptop and continue

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:42.979
to do work, and wait for someone
to say something that

00:35:42.979 --> 00:35:45.841
has something to do with me
rather than not show up to the

00:35:45.841 --> 00:35:47.034
meeting at all.

00:35:47.034 --> 00:35:48.890
I'd like to hear your
thoughts about that.

00:35:48.890 --> 00:35:55.090
AL PITTAMPALLI: I think that's
justified, but let's get to

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:56.800
the root of the problem.

00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:58.100
Why are you in the meeting
to begin with?

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:00.070
Let's get you out
of the meeting.

00:36:00.070 --> 00:36:03.930
Like if you don't need
to be there, then you

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:04.660
shouldn't be there.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.760
You should be productive
by yourself.

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.710
There's great article--

00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:14.653
maybe some of you have read
it-- by Paul Graham.

00:36:14.653 --> 00:36:16.095
He founded Y Combinator.

00:36:16.095 --> 00:36:17.640
He's big in the startup world.

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:19.790
And he wrote this article called
"The Difference Between

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:23.020
Managers Versus Makers, And
Why Meetings Are So

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.030
Contentious." I'm getting
some head nods here.

00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:28.520
Because managers and makers have
just these two completely

00:36:28.520 --> 00:36:30.590
different world views when
it comes to meetings.

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:33.880
Manager's days are broken up
into kind of hourly slots

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.250
because they're used to
going from meeting

00:36:35.250 --> 00:36:36.770
to meeting to meeting.

00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:37.730
So they're used to
the meetings.

00:36:37.730 --> 00:36:39.760
They probably even
enjoy meetings.

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:40.910
Makers, on the other hand--

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:43.640
programmers, engineers, artists--

00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:44.630
they don't work that way.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:47.130
They need long stretches of
time to do their work.

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:50.280
So when they get invited to a
meeting, it's like you've shot

00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:51.380
their entire day.

00:36:51.380 --> 00:36:54.350
One meeting, 30 minutes,
and their entire day's

00:36:54.350 --> 00:36:55.270
productivity is lost.

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:57.360
And a manager doesn't understand
that because they

00:36:57.360 --> 00:36:59.700
don't share that world view.

00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:04.780
So it's important, I think, in
organizations, in competitive

00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:10.730
organizations, to realize that
we need to make sure that we

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:12.340
fill that communication gap.

00:37:12.340 --> 00:37:15.420
Because in a world where makers
are so important-- we

00:37:15.420 --> 00:37:18.140
need creativity, we need
productivity--

00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:22.070
and people are just willfully
going to these meetings even

00:37:22.070 --> 00:37:23.237
though they're not being
productive, we

00:37:23.237 --> 00:37:24.460
need to stop that.

00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:27.800
We need to start organizing
our work habits in a very

00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:28.530
different way.

00:37:28.530 --> 00:37:31.140
A manager might need to start
having simple, one-on-one

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.270
conversations with their
engineers and their

00:37:33.270 --> 00:37:35.300
programmers.

00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.220
Maybe they have office hour.

00:37:37.220 --> 00:37:40.060
Maybe it's an office hours
format where between 2:00 and

00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:43.380
4:00, you can stop in any
time you want for 10

00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.535
minutes with that.

00:37:44.535 --> 00:37:45.900
I don't know what the
answer is, but the

00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:47.690
first step is the dialogue.

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:49.500
Unless we talk about this--

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:52.760
and I know it's tough, because
there are our bosses and the

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.120
people above us-- but there are
companies that are doing

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.510
it, and they're winning
because they're

00:37:57.510 --> 00:37:58.280
changing the culture.

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:00.872
And so, we need to
do that too.

00:38:05.336 --> 00:38:07.380
Any other questions?

00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:11.792
AUDIENCE: What about quarterly
status updates?

00:38:11.792 --> 00:38:14.070
Things that are, first of all,
very virtualized and must

00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:18.273
happen every quarter, and some
manager organizes an entire

00:38:18.273 --> 00:38:21.920
agenda which involves basically
presentations to the

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.565
organization and at the
beginning of the quarter, it

00:38:24.565 --> 00:38:26.230
seems as though these
happen on every

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:28.230
level of the hierarchy.

00:38:28.230 --> 00:38:31.290
So, yeah, the first week or two
of the quarter is lost to

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:33.590
these meetings.

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.510
AL PITTAMPALLI: The question
was about quarterly status

00:38:36.510 --> 00:38:41.000
meetings, and I'm very skeptical
of any meeting that

00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.850
meets with regularity.

00:38:42.850 --> 00:38:45.360
Because again, a meeting is
supposed to be designed as a

00:38:45.360 --> 00:38:46.890
tool to fix a problem.

00:38:46.890 --> 00:38:49.110
A regular meeting presupposes
that there's some type of

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:52.780
problem that just comes up
consistently every single

00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:54.670
quarter for some reason,
and I don't know

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:57.160
that to be the case.

00:38:57.160 --> 00:38:59.100
I'm not saying we shouldn't have
them, but the first thing

00:38:59.100 --> 00:39:01.950
we should do is be skeptical
of them, and say, well, why

00:39:01.950 --> 00:39:04.810
exactly is that there?

00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:05.970
And we need to work backwards.

00:39:05.970 --> 00:39:09.640
We need to say, OK, well,
what is this for?

00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.950
Not backwards, forwards.

00:39:10.950 --> 00:39:12.760
We need to figure out what's
the problem, what are we

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:16.050
trying to solve, and is this
the right way to do it?

00:39:16.050 --> 00:39:18.930
What exactly is this
status meeting for?

00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:21.250
I mean, presentations, there's
lots of ways to do

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:22.760
presentations.

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.770
You guys have pioneered
some of them.

00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:28.310
You can videotape it, you can
put it on YouTube, and you can

00:39:28.310 --> 00:39:30.390
sent it out to everyone.

00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:32.500
One of the reasons why we do
presentations in front of

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:36.110
everybody is to make sure
everybody comes, because we're

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:39.120
afraid if we do a presentation
online, and they don't watch

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.920
it, or they're not going
to watch it.

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.870
And that's a band aid.

00:39:42.870 --> 00:39:47.300
There's some fundamental problem
if people aren't

00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.000
watching the presentation.

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:52.520
Just forcing people into
a room to watch your

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:55.430
presentation is not
a good practice no

00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:56.730
matter where you are.

00:39:56.730 --> 00:40:01.430
So again, I think that whenever
there's some type of

00:40:01.430 --> 00:40:03.950
meeting with some type of
regularity, we should be

00:40:03.950 --> 00:40:04.240
suspicious.

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:07.640
We can really try to figure out
what the meeting is for,

00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.590
and if there's no good
purpose, then we

00:40:09.590 --> 00:40:11.402
should just not do it.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:19.850
OK, well, listen, I really
am honored to

00:40:19.850 --> 00:40:21.640
have spoken here today.

00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:23.050
I'll be around for a little
while, so if you have any

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:24.830
questions, I'd love
to answer them.

00:40:24.830 --> 00:40:25.940
Thank you very much.

00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:31.198
[APPLAUSE]
