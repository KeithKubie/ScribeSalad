00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.950
Hitler was a Vegetarian

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.730
Now he wasn’t always a vegetarian.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.110
In fact, it was later in his life that he
became one.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.590
Around the same time he was killing millions
of Jews and millions more from other cultural

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.200
backgrounds and trying to take over the world.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.200
Coincidence?

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:24.200
I think not!

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.019
According to transcripts translated by Hugh
Trevor-Roper, apparently on November 11, 1941

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.760
Hitler said, “One may regret living at a
period when it’s impossible to form an idea

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.440
of the shape the world of the future will
assume.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.760
But there’s one thing I can predict to eaters
of meat: the world of the future will be vegetarian.”

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.010
In further conversations on January 12, 1942,
he said, “The only thing of which I shall

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.010
be incapable is to share the sheiks’ mutton
with them.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.850
I’m a vegetarian, and they must spare me
from their meat.”

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.580
He also liked to bombard dinner guests with
graphic descriptions of slaughter houses he

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.979
had visited in the Ukraine as a way to turn
them off meat.

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:08.040
In addition to this, while watching movies,
any scene in a movie that had the killing,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.770
slaughtering, or otherwise abuse of an animal
in it, he would look away and have someone

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:15.570
tell him when it was over as he couldn’t
bare to watch.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.590
In fact, he couldn’t bare it so much, that
the Nazi party banned such scenes in film.

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.439
If this isn’t enough irony for you, consider
the amazing number of animal rights laws the

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.360
Nazi’s created and enforced.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.310
The Nazi’s banned commercial animal trapping
and vastly restricted hunting among other

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.079
things like restricting the shoeing of horses
and banning boiling of lobsters.

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.439
One fisherman was even sent to a concentration
camp for cutting up a frog for use as bait.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.060
After passing many of these animal rights
laws, Hermann Goring, a prominent Nazi party

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.619
member, said those who “still think they
can continue to treat animals as inanimate

00:01:51.619 --> 00:02:14.940
property” will be sent to concentration
camps…
