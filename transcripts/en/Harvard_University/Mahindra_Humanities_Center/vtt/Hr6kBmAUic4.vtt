00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.029
Welcome, everybody.

00:00:02.029 --> 00:00:03.370
Good evening.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.798
Hi.

00:00:04.798 --> 00:00:06.702
Hi.

00:00:06.702 --> 00:00:11.950
I'm Claire Masood, and I
have the joy and privilege

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.160
this evening to welcome
Jenny Erpenbech to Harvard.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.670
For many of us who have read
and admired her work for years,

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.180
to have her with us in person
is a particular delight.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.420
I want to thank Jenny for making
the long journey of course, not

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.520
least when she's been
battling the flu.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.980
So yes, so we may all be--

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.110
I've heard Jenny's
cough, and it's for real.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.940
So we all just have to
beam soothing thoughts

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.570
to Jenny's throat I guess.

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.360
And I also want to say a
special thanks to [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.030
of Brookline Booksmith--

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.450
are you here?

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:54.934
Hi-- Without whom this evening
would not have come to pass.

00:00:54.934 --> 00:00:57.100
And to let you know that
Jenny will be reading there

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.440
in Brookline tomorrow evening.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.080
I also want to thank Jenny's
publishers, New Directions.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.360
Her editor Declan Spring
has come all the way

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.040
from New York this evening.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.290
In addition, I'd like to
thank the team at the Harvard

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:10.870
bookstore who, as always, are
great supporters of the writers

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:11.950
speak series.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.530
While we don't have books
for sale at the event here,

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:17.842
Jenny will be signing
copies tomorrow morning

00:01:17.842 --> 00:01:18.550
at the bookstore.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.670
And they're available
unsigned right now.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.350
They'll be available
signed tomorrow

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.610
after 11 at the bookshop
just right around the corner.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.670
And as ever, many thanks
to Professor Homi Bhabha

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.460
and the Mahindra
Humanities Center,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.440
as well as to Sarah Razor
who makes everything happen.

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.620
And of course, thanks
to you all for coming.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.100
Without you we wouldn't be here.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.070
Jenny Erpenbech is a
writer who wastes no words.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.980
From the publication
of her first book,

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.170
The Old Child and Other
Stories almost 20 years ago,

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.620
she has been recognized
and acclaimed in her native

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.590
Germany, dubbed by the
news magazine Der Spiegel,

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.770
one of GÃ¼nter Grass'
grandchildren and photographed

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.460
alongside several other writers
with her head on an actual tin

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.800
drum.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.620
International
recognition ensued.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.931
The Old Child was published
in the states in 2005.

00:02:11.931 --> 00:02:12.805
I think that's right.

00:02:12.805 --> 00:02:14.200
Is that right?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.840
Followed by her novels
The Book of Words,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.580
2007 Visitation, 2010
End of Days 2014,

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.140
and most recently Go Went
Gone published last year.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.600
She is routinely a
best seller in Germany,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.970
and Go Went Gone
was no exception.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.940
She's been the recipient of too
many prestigious prizes for me

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.020
to name.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.870
So here are just the ones
from the past four years--

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.600
the Hans Fallada Prize, the
Independent Foreign Fiction

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.300
Prize, shared with her
longtime longtime translator

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:46.540
Susan Bernofsky, the Thomas
Mann prize, the [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.540
European prize, and the
Order of Merit of the Federal

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.950
Republic of Germany.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.540
As my former
teacher at Cambridge

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.240
might have said with a
sardonically raised eyebrow,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.910
will that do?

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.860
When you read Jenny's
work, several things

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.450
are swiftly apparent.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.020
She is stylistically original,
her prose fiercely vivid,

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.140
but also taut, even spare.

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.390
She is frequently
formerly inventive,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:14.800
and her texts, richly conceived,
operate on multiple levels.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.010
Two of her books are carefully
constructed around conceits--

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.100
in Visitation, the history of a
lake house, and in End of Days,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.140
the various possible
trajectories of a woman's

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.330
life through the 20th century.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:27.520
Whatever she chooses
to write about,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.140
Jenny addresses only the
most urgent subjects,

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.080
whether in the
present, as in Go When

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.690
Gone, which involves the
relationship that develops

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.460
between a retired
classics professor

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.100
named Richard and a
group of African refugees

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.190
seeking asylum in Germany,
or in recent history,

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.500
as in Visitation or End
of Days, both of which

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.950
trace individual histories
through the tumultuous darkness

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.560
of Germany's 20th
century, from the fall

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.020
of the Austro-Hungarian
empire and the First World

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.440
War through interwar privations
to the rise of Hitler

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.440
and the Holocaust and then
on to the wrenching division

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:02.350
of Germany and the
bitterness of the Cold War

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.430
that march to Jenny's
own childhood.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.300
She was born in 1967.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.520
Her books are eventful and
dramatic, but never histrionic.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.460
They have about them
the adamantine precision

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.600
of authenticity, lived or very
carefully researched truth

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.690
as assessed by a
penetrating intellect.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.060
Indeed, there is a
neutrality and almost godlike

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.100
detachment about
her narration that

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.820
makes the most intolerable
scenes both utterly immediate

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.250
and only the more
agonizing as when

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.740
she writes the murder of a
young Jewish girl in Visitation.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.350
And I quote, "for three years,
the girl took piano lessons.

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.270
But now, while her dead body
slides down into the pit,

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:49.970
the word piano is taken
back from human beings.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.060
Now the backflip on
the high bar the girl

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.280
could perform better
than her schoolmates is

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.060
taken back along with all
the motions a swimmer makes.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.340
The gesture of
seizing hold of a crab

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.610
is taken back, as well
as all the basic knots

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:05.230
to be learned for sailing.

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:08.620
All these things are taken
back into uninventivedness.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.470
And finally, last of
all, the name of the girl

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:16.540
herself is taken back, the name
no one will ever again call her

00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.890
by, Doris."

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:22.730
As Flaubert would have
had it, Jenny Erpenbech

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.450
is in her work the way God
is in nature, everywhere but

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.740
invisible.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.600
She has drawn on her
family's histories

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.760
for inspiration on
numerous occasions,

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.760
but her work is far
from autobiographical.

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.370
She takes her East German
legacy as neither a cudgel

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.250
nor a plaint, but instead
as a frame of reference

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.440
that better enables her to
understand the wider world.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.090
She has said, I do believe
that East German authors have

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:49.400
an experiential
advantage from having

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:52.640
lived through a period
of such radical change.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:55.580
I grew up constantly being
reminded that I lived

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:57.920
on the poorer side of Germany.

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.960
Then the whole thing
gets turned upside down,

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.190
and you suddenly belong
to the wealthier side.

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.860
But you can't forget.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.380
You can't forget what
it felt like to be

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:08.240
on the other side of history.

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.130
It allows you to
relate differently

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:13.370
to other people, especially
those for whom things haven't

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.970
always fallen into their laps.

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:18.920
Jenny's East German
legacy has never

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:21.180
been more relevant
than it is today.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.650
And we, in this current United
States, should take notice.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.230
People don't tend to believe
me, she said in an interview

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.500
already several years ago, but
our default mode in the east

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:33.030
was skepticism towards
the government,

00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.200
especially among those who still
believe that socialism deserved

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.610
a better chance.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:40.070
When we read a newspaper,
the first question

00:06:40.070 --> 00:06:43.110
was always, what does
that really mean.

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.050
It gave us a much
better training

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:47.960
and alertness to
potential manipulation.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.060
Sometimes I think that
people in the West

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.610
were much more streamlined,
much more easily

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:56.390
manipulated with their
100% faith in democracy

00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:58.610
while remaining
largely unquestioning

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.730
of the economic system.

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:04.520
We will, I hope, discuss
such broader questions

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:06.930
afterwards among other things.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:08.750
But let us never lose
sight of the fact

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:10.790
that Jenny's
brilliance is to create

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:14.060
vital, enduring art
rather than news

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.580
out of what matters most now.

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:19.730
As she has said with
regard to Go Went Gone,

00:07:19.730 --> 00:07:22.010
we are living side
by side with stories

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.490
like I grew up with, stories
out of the deep experience

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.770
of trying to survive.

00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:29.300
In the stories I
grew up with, it

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:31.910
was Jews trying to
survive the fascists.

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:35.850
But now too we are living with
stories that will make history.

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:38.780
These are in our own
city in a parallel world

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.740
just under the surface.

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:45.680
And again, people are
simply trying to survive.

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.978
Please join me in
welcoming Jenny Erpenbech.

00:07:48.978 --> 00:07:52.464
[APPLAUSE]

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.780
Is this OK?

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:12.190
This is my water?

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.930
This one is yours?

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:19.000
So it's a great honor
for me to be here,

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.500
to be introduced
by Claire Masood.

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:26.080
And first, there
will be a reading.

00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:35.130
I'm going to start with the
beginning of the book, just

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:37.100
the first 2 and 1/2 pages.

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:45.170
And then I read a bit of
some part about a refugee.

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.470
Perhaps many more
years still lie

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:54.200
before him or
perhaps only a few.

00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:56.540
In any case, from
now on, Richard

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.520
will no longer have
to get up early

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:00.950
to appear at the institute.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:05.270
As of today, he has
time, plain and simple,

00:09:05.270 --> 00:09:11.390
time to travel people say, to
read books, Proust, Dostoevsky,

00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:13.740
time to listen to music.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.740
He doesn't know how
long it will take them

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.110
to get used to having time.

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:23.400
In any case, his head still
works just the same as before.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:26.580
What's he going to do with the
thoughts still thinking away

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.840
inside his head?

00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.330
He's had his share of success.

00:09:31.330 --> 00:09:36.190
And now at least what
passes for success.

00:09:36.190 --> 00:09:39.430
He has published books and
been invited to conferences,

00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:42.010
his lectures always filled up.

00:09:42.010 --> 00:09:45.910
Students were assigned his books
to read, highlighting passages

00:09:45.910 --> 00:09:49.200
to learn by heart
for their exams.

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.810
Where are his students now?

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.570
Some have a junior
faculty positions,

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:57.060
two or three are even tenured.

00:09:57.060 --> 00:09:59.850
Others, he hasn't
heard about in years.

00:09:59.850 --> 00:10:01.800
There's one he's
too friendly with,

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.590
and a few others drop
him a line periodically.

00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:06.390
That's how it is.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:10.590
From his desk, he sees the lake.

00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:12.570
Richard makes coffee.

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:15.480
Cup in hand, he goes
out to the backyard

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.600
to check for a new mole hills.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:23.730
The lake lies placid before
him as it has all summer long.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.710
Richard's waiting but he
doesn't know for what.

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:31.340
Time is now completely
different, suddenly different,

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:33.020
he thinks.

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.300
And then he thinks
that obviously he

00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.760
can't stop thinking.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.350
The thinking is what he is.

00:10:40.350 --> 00:10:44.910
And at the same time, it's
the machine that governs him.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.200
Even if he's all alone
with his head now,

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.430
he can just stop
thinking obviously,

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:57.000
even if no one gives
a hoot what he thinks.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.110
For a brief moment he
imagines an owl using its beak

00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:05.280
to flip the pages of his
study, the concept of the word

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.630
and work of Lucretius.

00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:10.680
He goes back in.

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:15.570
He asks himself whether it's
too warm to be wearing a Blazer.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:18.120
Does he even need a Blazer
or if he's just puttering

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:21.260
around the house alone?

00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.590
Years ago, when he
learned by chance

00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.080
that his lover was
cheating on him,

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.680
the only thing that helped him
get over his disappointment

00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:33.950
was turning this
disappointment into work.

00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:38.360
For months, he made her
behavior his object of inquiry.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.750
He wrote almost 100
pages investigating

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:45.230
all the factors that
led up to the betrayal,

00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:49.950
as well as the way in which the
young woman had carried it out.

00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.690
His work had no particular
impact on their relationship

00:11:53.690 --> 00:11:58.260
as she left him for
good not long after.

00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:01.620
But still, these labors got
him through the first months

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.710
after his discovery,
months in which he'd

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:07.400
felt truly miserable.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:11.950
The best cure for love is,
as Ovid knew centuries ago,

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:14.160
is work.

00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.920
But now he's being
tormented, not

00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:22.880
by time filled with pointless
love, but by time itself.

00:12:22.880 --> 00:12:27.490
Time is supposed to
pass, but not just dead.

00:12:27.490 --> 00:12:31.960
For an instant, he has a vision
of a furious owl tearing apart

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:39.930
a book entitled On Waiting
with its beak and talons.

00:12:39.930 --> 00:12:42.380
Maybe a cardigan
is more appropriate

00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.550
to his new condition, more
comfortable at any rate.

00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:56.620
And seeing that he
no longer goes out

00:12:56.620 --> 00:12:59.570
in human society
on a daily basis,

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:02.500
it's surely no longer
necessary for him

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:05.610
to shave every single morning.

00:13:05.610 --> 00:13:07.920
Let grow what will.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.310
Just stop putting up resistance.

00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:13.970
Or is that how dying begins?

00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:17.980
Could dying begin with
this kind of growth?

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.550
No, that can't be
right, he thinks.

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:25.180
They still haven't found the
man at the bottom of the lake.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:26.920
It wasn't suicide.

00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:29.760
He died in a swimming accident.

00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:34.410
Ever since that day in June,
the lake has been placid.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:38.490
Day after day, it's been
perfectly calm, calm in June,

00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:40.170
calm in July.

00:13:40.170 --> 00:13:45.240
And even now with autumn on
the way, it remains calm.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:50.420
No rowboats, no shrieking
children, no fisherman.

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:54.020
This summer anyone diving
head first off the dock

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:56.630
at the public beach
could only be an outsider

00:13:56.630 --> 00:13:59.060
who hasn't heard yet.

00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.060
While this bather is
drying off after his swim,

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:05.480
a local might address
him who's walking her dog

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:09.440
or a bicyclist who dismounts
for a moment to ask,

00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:11.870
so you don't know.

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.730
Richard has never
mentioned the accident

00:14:13.730 --> 00:14:16.680
to an unsuspecting visitor.

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:18.530
What would be the point?

00:14:18.530 --> 00:14:21.140
Why ruin things
for someone who's

00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:24.010
just trying to enjoy the day?

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:28.270
Strangers who walk past his
garden gate on their outings

00:14:28.270 --> 00:14:31.670
return just as
happy as they came.

00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:36.155
But he can't avoid seeing the
lake when he sits at his desk.

00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:47.650
Then in the course of
some circumstances, walks

00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:51.850
through the city and an
encounter on the Alexanderplatz

00:14:51.850 --> 00:14:59.140
first, and yeah,
following other things,

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:08.950
he starts researching on the
issue of refugees and off--

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.500
he's researching about
African countries

00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:14.400
for the first time, what
are the capitals of these.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.860
And he has not much
of an idea about it.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:33.320
And his idea is
that he might find,

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:35.870
in the refugees,
the right persons

00:15:35.870 --> 00:15:40.760
to ask about the problem of
time, of how to spend time

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.730
without being allowed to work.

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:45.800
They are young men mostly.

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:50.230
He is a not a young man anymore.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.390
But the problem is
the same problem.

00:15:52.390 --> 00:16:00.750
And so the reason for research
is that he wants to meet them

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:06.670
and to interviewing them
for a project about time.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:10.110
And so, he is
working out a catalog

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:21.020
of questions that could
make clear the transition,

00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:26.000
to explore what the transition
is from one part of life

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.500
to another one, which
is hard to stand.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:33.220
So this just a catalog
of his questions

00:16:33.220 --> 00:16:37.585
he prepares for the
first real meeting.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.170
Where did you grow up?

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:45.180
What's your native language?

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:48.330
What's your religious
affiliation?

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.510
How many people
are in your family?

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:55.260
What did the apartment or
house you grew up in look like?

00:16:55.260 --> 00:16:57.700
How did your parents meet?

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.470
Was there a TV?

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:01.010
Where did you sleep?

00:17:01.010 --> 00:17:02.500
What did you eat?

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:05.859
What was your favorite hiding
place when you were a child?

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.780
Did you go to school?

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.210
What sort of clothing
did you wear?

00:17:10.210 --> 00:17:11.800
Did you have pets?

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:13.660
Did you learn a trade?

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:16.240
Do you have a
family of your own?

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.819
When did you leave the
country of your birth?

00:17:18.819 --> 00:17:20.140
Why?

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:22.900
Are you still in contact
with your family?

00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:25.480
What was your goal
when you left home?

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:28.130
How did you say your goodbyes?

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:30.530
What did you take with
you when you left?

00:17:30.530 --> 00:17:34.440
What did you think
Europe would be like?

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.020
What's different?

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:38.720
How do you spend your days?

00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:40.310
What do you miss most?

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.440
What do you wish for?

00:17:42.440 --> 00:17:45.320
If you have children who
were growing up here,

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.740
what would you tell them
about your homeland?

00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.720
Can you imagine
growing old here?

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.070
Where do you want to be buried?

00:17:59.630 --> 00:18:06.880
And now I am I'm just
reading one of the stories.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.770
He's told by one--

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:12.360
by actually, by
the first refugee,

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:18.040
he's meeting alone
for an interview.

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:22.180
So actually he's meeting
him in a former house

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:28.000
for elderly people, in which the
refugees were put by the Berlin

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.740
Senate for a short while.

00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:36.940
And there he starts
with his talks.

00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:43.120
Avat was born in Ghana.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:47.350
His mother died giving
birth to him, just

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.200
like [INAUDIBLE],,
which are things just

00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:53.930
like the mother of Tristan.

00:18:53.930 --> 00:18:55.700
The first day of
my life, Avat says,

00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:57.860
is also the day
I lost my mother.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:18:59.075
And your father?

00:18:59.075 --> 00:19:01.310
Avat doesn't answer.

00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:04.490
Until the age of seven, he
says, he lived with his Nana,

00:19:04.490 --> 00:19:06.350
his grandmother.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:08.420
Is your grandmother still alive?

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:11.440
Have you seen her since then?

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:13.320
Do you remember
what she looks like?

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:16.060
No.

00:19:16.060 --> 00:19:18.070
When Avat was seven
years old, his father

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:20.510
brought him to live in Libya.

00:19:20.510 --> 00:19:23.230
This grandmother whose
daughter died giving birth

00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:26.770
to her first child
whose grandson learned

00:19:26.770 --> 00:19:29.320
to speak from her
and was washed by her

00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:33.100
every evening before going
to bed, standing on a board

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.910
so that the hot earth
wouldn't burn his feet,

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:40.570
this now very old and
possibly even deceased woman

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:42.820
tries to fight her
way out of the memory

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.970
free zone surrounding
her grandson,

00:19:45.970 --> 00:19:49.300
fight her way into the world
of all that can be told,

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.100
but she doesn't succeed.

00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:55.120
Her grandson called her Nana
as Ghanaian grandmothers

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.500
are called.

00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.630
And beyond that,
she has no name.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:02.080
She remains trapped
in this lower stratum

00:20:02.080 --> 00:20:05.590
and silently sings
back down again.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:09.250
What will the man in the lake
do when the lake freezes over

00:20:09.250 --> 00:20:11.190
soon?

00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:13.440
Did you ever go back to Ghana?

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.880
No, never.

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:20.180
His father worked in Tripoli
as a driver for an oil company.

00:20:20.180 --> 00:20:22.060
Avat was sent to school.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:24.970
They lived alone in
an eight room house.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:26.380
Often there were guests.

00:20:26.380 --> 00:20:28.330
And when his father
got home from work,

00:20:28.330 --> 00:20:30.610
he cooked for everyone.

00:20:30.610 --> 00:20:34.150
His father played soccer
with him and bought him toys,

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.000
gave him pocket money--
quite a lot actually.

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.300
He flew with him to
Egypt on vacation.

00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:43.060
The flight to Cairo
only took 30 minutes.

00:20:43.060 --> 00:20:47.200
I know my way around Cairo
really well, Avat says.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.900
We went over there a lot.

00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:55.740
Over there is what West Germany
was called back in GDR times.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:58.770
Avat's waited until
evening to raise the blinds

00:20:58.770 --> 00:21:01.050
on the southern
side of the house

00:21:01.050 --> 00:21:03.720
where the sun
shone all day long.

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:07.530
His father taught him how to
dry his bed after a shower

00:21:07.530 --> 00:21:09.990
with a towel stretched diago--

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.850
oh, this is one of
my favorite words--

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.920
diagonally, diagonally.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:18.240
OK, sorry.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:20.820
You know, it's not
my mother tongue.

00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.290
You perhaps realized
that already--

00:21:25.290 --> 00:21:27.270
diagonally cross it.

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:29.790
His father taught him
to cook and gave him

00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.550
his first electric razor.

00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:36.360
My father told me
who I am, Avat says.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:39.720
And then, Avat just sit
silently for a moment,

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:44.060
gazing at the fake wood
vener on the table surface.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.240
This table too may
have stood 25 years ago

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:51.590
in a [SPEAKING GERMAN] office or
in the house of Germans Soviet

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:53.280
Friendship.

00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:56.030
But Avat has no way
of knowing this,

00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:58.190
and he certainly has
no way of knowing

00:21:58.190 --> 00:22:03.410
what [SPEAKING GERMAN] or
German Soviet friendship was.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:05.200
And then?

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:07.840
I started to work
as an auto mechanic.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:09.640
I had friends.

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:11.560
It was a good life.

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:13.450
And then?

00:22:13.450 --> 00:22:16.070
On the street outside,
a truck was backing up.

00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:18.210
You can hear the
warning signal--

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:21.730
a high pitched beeping
sound over and over.

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:24.980
In Morse code, it would be zero.

00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.070
Every odd week in the
calendar, the plastic recycling

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:30.500
is picked up or maybe
it's a furniture delivery

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:35.570
truck trying to turn
around and in the driveway.

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:39.080
Then my father was shot.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:41.720
Richard would like to say
something at this point,

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:45.060
but he can't think of anything.

00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.110
A small yellow label
is affixed to the table

00:22:47.110 --> 00:22:50.870
leg, inventory number 360/87.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:57.750
Richard had seen his father
one last time in the hospital

00:22:57.750 --> 00:22:59.520
after his death.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.880
The nurses had bound the
dead man's jaw to his skull

00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:07.710
with a bandage to keep his mouth
hanging open for all eternity.

00:23:07.710 --> 00:23:10.650
The bandage made his
father look like a nun.

00:23:10.650 --> 00:23:14.300
Richard had barely
recognized him.

00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:18.850
Avat had bent over,
propping himself on his arms

00:23:18.850 --> 00:23:22.040
and gazing ever deeper
into the table surface

00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:25.140
as he goes on speaking.

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.990
A friend of my
fathers called me.

00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:29.640
They were here at the office.

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:31.390
He shouted, your father.

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.100
That's all.

00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:35.650
I said, I didn't
understand what he meant.

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:39.430
Then he started shouting again,
this man who never shouted,

00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:41.860
who was always friendly to me.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:44.080
Now he was shouting
at me and said

00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:48.070
I should run home as fast as
I could and lock the door.

00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:52.700
Then the connection was broken
off, and I started running.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:54.340
But when I got
home, the front door

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.770
was already ripped
off its hinges,

00:23:56.770 --> 00:23:58.470
the windows were shattered.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:01.540
Inside everything was
destroyed in the hallway,

00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.060
two rooms, the kitchen.

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:06.010
There were shots everywhere.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.200
The furniture was upside down.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:11.490
The TV was messed, everything.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:14.070
I climbed out one
of the back windows

00:24:14.070 --> 00:24:16.980
and tried to call my
father's friend again.

00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:21.300
I tried again and again,
but I couldn't get through.

00:24:21.300 --> 00:24:27.320
Once I also dialed my
father's number, nothing.

00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:28.930
That's how the end was.

00:24:39.050 --> 00:24:41.650
Sorry, I'm a bit sick too.

00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:49.650
Until night came, I
waited on the street.

00:24:49.650 --> 00:24:52.080
Where was I supposed to go?

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:54.690
It was the same street
I walked to go to school

00:24:54.690 --> 00:24:57.160
and later to work.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.030
Then a military patrol came.

00:25:01.030 --> 00:25:03.130
They forced me to get
in the back of a truck,

00:25:03.130 --> 00:25:06.710
and brought me to
a barracks camp.

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:09.410
I saw there people lying
on the street, some of them

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.780
shot, others stabbed.

00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:15.220
On this day, I saw the war.

00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:18.260
On this day, I saw the war.

00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:21.320
There were already hundreds
of people in the barracks.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.300
Most of them were
black Africans,

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:28.220
but there were also some Arabs
from Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt--

00:25:28.220 --> 00:25:33.410
not only men, but also women,
children, babies, old people.

00:25:33.410 --> 00:25:37.850
They took everything away from
us-- money, watches, phones,

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.780
even our socks, he says--
and starts laughing.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.480
He laughs and laughs.

00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:47.900
It's not easy, he says,
and stops laughing.

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:51.650
It's not easy, he says
again, shaking his head.

00:25:51.650 --> 00:25:57.180
It's not easy, as if this
were the end of the story.

00:25:57.180 --> 00:26:00.270
And then, when I
tried to complain,

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:03.750
he says they hit me in the
head with a rifle butt.

00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:06.580
You can still see the scar.

00:26:06.580 --> 00:26:08.710
Avat parts his hair
with his fingers

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:12.070
and shows the car to
the Professor Emeritus

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:16.380
with whom he is speaking today
for the first time in his life.

00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:20.560
If you want to arrive somewhere,
you can't hide anything,

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.140
he had said to Richard
at the beginning

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:26.281
of their conversation.

00:26:26.281 --> 00:26:27.780
If you are lucky,
you'll get beaten.

00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.610
If you're unlucky,
you'll get shot,

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:32.570
someone said to console me.

00:26:32.570 --> 00:26:35.180
Then they took the Sim
cards out of all phones

00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.140
and destroyed them
before our eyes.

00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:41.210
They broke the
memory, Avat says.

00:26:41.210 --> 00:26:44.600
None of us had anything
left except a t-shirt

00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.160
or pants or a skirt.

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:50.220
For two days, we sat
there in the barracks

00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:53.580
while the European
bombs fell on Tripoli.

00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:56.460
We were afraid one of
the bombs would hit us

00:26:56.460 --> 00:26:59.330
since it was a military camp.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:01.520
On the third day, they
brought us to the harbor

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.100
and made us get on a boat.

00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:08.230
Who among you knows how
to steer a boat like this.

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:11.140
Two or three Arabs
said they did.

00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:13.300
They raised the Gaddafi
flag and our boat,

00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.500
Avat says laughing,
a Gaddafi flag.

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.300
So whether they're
Gaddafi people or rebels,

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.830
we didn't know.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:26.030
They all had the same uniforms.

00:27:26.030 --> 00:27:29.480
Before this moment, Richard
had never really thought

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:33.110
that members of the military who
turned against the government

00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:37.030
would still be viewing
their country's uniform.

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:41.350
In any case, no one
was on our side.

00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:45.950
Even though I grew up in
Libya, Libya was my country.

00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:47.410
Avat nods to himself.

00:27:47.410 --> 00:27:50.500
And for a while, he
says nothing more.

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:55.210
And then, then they shot a
salvo in the air and said to us,

00:27:55.210 --> 00:27:58.870
anyone who tries to
swim back will be shot.

00:27:58.870 --> 00:28:01.670
We didn't know where the
boat was going, maybe

00:28:01.670 --> 00:28:04.750
to Malta or Tunisia.

00:28:04.750 --> 00:28:08.500
Only later did we understand
it was going to Italy.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:11.350
We were squeezed in so
tight you could only

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:13.300
get up for a few minutes.

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:17.320
Then you sat down again right
where you were sitting before.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:20.940
The woman behind me
peed without getting up.

00:28:20.940 --> 00:28:25.340
When I tried to prop myself
up, everything was wet.

00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:28.280
We were in the
boat for four days.

00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:30.590
There were only a
few bottles of water,

00:28:30.590 --> 00:28:33.570
and we gave them
to the children.

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:39.360
When things got too bad,
we adults drank salt water.

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:40.440
It's not easy, Richard.

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:42.450
It's not easy.

00:28:42.450 --> 00:28:44.700
We made a bigger hole in
an empty plastic bottle

00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:46.120
with our teeth.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.360
And then we tied together
a couple of shoelaces,

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.410
attached the bottle,
and let it over the side

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:55.350
to scoop up the seawater.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:29:01.550
You have to drink a
few people [AUDIO OUT]

00:29:05.010 --> 00:29:09.580
My head, my head, and then
bent his head like this.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:12.770
And then the next
moment he was dead.

00:29:12.770 --> 00:29:15.475
When people died, we
threw them in the water.

00:29:18.390 --> 00:29:20.640
Richard thinks about
all the airplanes

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:25.380
from which he's looked out over
window at some sea or other,

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:30.730
how the waves seen from above
appear not to be moving at all

00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:33.950
and the white foam
looks like stone.

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:36.230
In the middle of the
previous century,

00:29:36.230 --> 00:29:39.650
the Libyan coast briefly
belonged to Italy.

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:42.420
Now Libya is a
different country.

00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:44.840
And to refugees
who leave by boat,

00:29:44.840 --> 00:29:49.160
Italy appears first in form
of a small, rocky elevation

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:52.680
surrounded by a
great deal of water

00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:57.200
if it appears to them at all.

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.660
War destroys
everything, Avat says--

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.590
your family, your friends,
the place where you live,

00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.110
your work, your life.

00:30:07.110 --> 00:30:11.380
When you become foreign, Avat
says, you don't have a choice.

00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:12.960
You don't know where to go.

00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.530
You don't know anything.

00:30:15.530 --> 00:30:19.040
I can't see myself anymore,
can't see the child

00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:21.090
I used to be.

00:30:21.090 --> 00:30:24.570
I don't have a picture
of myself anymore.

00:30:24.570 --> 00:30:26.980
My father is dead, he says.

00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:31.710
And me, I don't know
who I am anymore.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:35.940
Becoming foreign to
yourself and others,

00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:39.950
that's what the
transition looks like.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:43.600
What's the sense of all this,
he asks, looking back at Richard

00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.610
again.

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:48.220
Now Richard is the one
who's supposed to answer,

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:50.780
but he doesn't know how.

00:30:50.780 --> 00:30:53.420
Isn't it like this, Avat says--

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:58.110
every adult human being,
man or woman, rich or poor,

00:30:58.110 --> 00:31:00.530
if he has work or not,
if he lives in a house

00:31:00.530 --> 00:31:03.320
or is homeless,
it doesn't matter.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.290
Every human being has
a few years to live,

00:31:06.290 --> 00:31:08.900
and then he dies?

00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:14.020
Yes, that's how it
is, Richard says.

00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.430
Thank you.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.895
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:51.070
Now you can hear us.

00:31:51.070 --> 00:31:52.300
Everybody can hear us?

00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:53.127
Me, too?

00:31:53.127 --> 00:31:54.410
Yeah?

00:31:54.410 --> 00:31:55.190
OK.

00:31:55.190 --> 00:31:55.690
Good.

00:31:55.690 --> 00:31:56.290
Let's hope.

00:31:56.290 --> 00:31:58.240
Let's hope.

00:31:58.240 --> 00:31:59.800
Can you hear Jenny?

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.870
No.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:04.368
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:32:12.627 --> 00:32:16.322
I cannot hear you.

00:32:16.322 --> 00:32:17.610
Ah, yes.

00:32:21.170 --> 00:32:22.886
You'll have to talk
into your chin.

00:32:27.786 --> 00:32:30.110
Wait.

00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:33.710
I put it a bit closer, otherwise
I will have to speak like this.

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:35.542
And that's not very polite.

00:32:35.542 --> 00:32:36.250
Wait, wait, wait.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:40.690
Doesn't look so bad.

00:32:40.690 --> 00:32:43.800
OK, now it's a bit better.

00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:45.230
[SPEAKING GERMAN] a bit?

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:48.710
No, it's not quite
perfect, but it's better.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:49.210
That's good.

00:32:49.210 --> 00:32:54.005
I try my best to speak like this
like someone from the Secret

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:54.505
Service.

00:32:57.676 --> 00:33:00.250
You want put it on inside
so when you're talking--

00:33:00.250 --> 00:33:01.796
My inside?

00:33:01.796 --> 00:33:05.246
On the other side so that
when you're speaking to the--

00:33:05.246 --> 00:33:06.780
That's a good idea.

00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:08.170
Then you'll be
turning naturally.

00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.410
This was quite clever.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.010
I hope it doesn't fall down.

00:33:17.010 --> 00:33:18.816
OK, it's good.

00:33:18.816 --> 00:33:20.330
Now it's perfect.

00:33:20.330 --> 00:33:22.752
I can hear me speaking.

00:33:22.752 --> 00:33:23.460
You can hear you.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:24.120
Good.

00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:27.070
So I guess you can hear me, too.

00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:30.190
Sorry for you.

00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:35.470
It's not unpolite to this
side, but to the mic is here.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:37.480
Thank you for that
wonderful reading.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.070
And there are so many
things to talk about.

00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:44.800
Maybe that's as good a place--

00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.690
how about the story is as
good as any to start perhaps?

00:33:49.690 --> 00:33:55.690
And to ask you, I know you did
a lot of research for this book.

00:33:55.690 --> 00:33:57.130
How did this book come to be?

00:33:57.130 --> 00:33:58.300
What was the germ of it?

00:33:58.300 --> 00:33:59.800
Where did it start?

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:04.640
And how did you embark on
discovering and telling--

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:05.770
I mean-- these stories?

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:07.300
And how fictionalized are they?

00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:09.790
And all of those questions.

00:34:09.790 --> 00:34:11.739
Where did the book come from?

00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:13.250
Let's start there.

00:34:13.250 --> 00:34:18.130
[SPEAKING GERMAN],, actually
the reason for starting

00:34:18.130 --> 00:34:27.219
was, I was about to write
another book in autumn 2013.

00:34:27.219 --> 00:34:32.480
And there was one of
the first big accidents.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:36.489
One of those refugee
boats capsized,

00:34:36.489 --> 00:34:38.560
and hundreds of people drowned.

00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:42.670
And the next day, I opened
a German newspapers.

00:34:42.670 --> 00:34:48.960
And I thought that they would
write something like, that's

00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.139
a tragedy, of course.

00:34:53.139 --> 00:34:57.230
And they wrote a bit like
this, but only a bit.

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:04.470
And mostly they said, yes, but
accidents like these cannot be

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:08.770
a reason to accept all of
the refugees in Europe,

00:35:08.770 --> 00:35:11.950
that all people think
they can come to Europe.

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:16.930
And for me, this seemed to
be an inappropriate reaction.

00:35:16.930 --> 00:35:18.930
And I thought, this was--

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:28.960
it shocked me because it made
so clear that the value of life

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.980
is so different, that the
value of a life of a refugee

00:35:32.980 --> 00:35:35.820
much less--

00:35:35.820 --> 00:35:43.760
or is considered to be much
less than life in Europe

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:49.120
or in the world we know.

00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:54.390
We-- OK, we could speak
about it, how we too.

00:35:54.390 --> 00:35:57.746
But we don't do so now.

00:35:57.746 --> 00:36:02.750
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
and then, I thought,

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:10.410
as you said in your introduction
also, in Germany and of course

00:36:10.410 --> 00:36:17.340
also in the US, we grew up with
these stories of surviving,

00:36:17.340 --> 00:36:23.310
of people that only survive
because one single person had

00:36:23.310 --> 00:36:27.690
helped them to be in
a place or somewhere,

00:36:27.690 --> 00:36:32.310
all the fascist
time stories, these

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:36.960
were the stories that
like made my education.

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.350
And so I thought
there's not much

00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:44.270
of a difference, especially
this chapter I've read.

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:51.030
I was told the
story by a refugee,

00:36:51.030 --> 00:36:57.760
and this story reminded
me of many, many stories

00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:01.090
s for instance, the trains in
which the Jews were brought

00:37:01.090 --> 00:37:02.440
to the concentration camps.

00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:05.450
It's not much of a
difference in the suffering,

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:08.550
and during that transport.

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:11.560
So I thought, it's
time that someone

00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:20.770
from out of the middle of the
society starts to deal with it

00:37:20.770 --> 00:37:26.030
and to ask, who are
these people and what

00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:29.050
are they really are
thinking and doing

00:37:29.050 --> 00:37:38.100
while waiting in Europe for a
chance to be allowed to work,

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.416
that the main problem is that
they are not allowed to work--

00:37:41.416 --> 00:37:42.790
not that they
don't want to work,

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:46.414
but that they are not allowed.

00:37:46.414 --> 00:37:47.955
Only in the country
where they'll end

00:37:47.955 --> 00:37:49.830
up first, which in most cases--

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:50.470
Is Italy.

00:37:50.470 --> 00:37:53.740
Is Italy, Greece,
or Spain, and we all

00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:57.460
know that these are not the
countries with the strongest

00:37:57.460 --> 00:37:59.040
economy.

00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.840
And in Germany, we
are lacking people,

00:38:01.840 --> 00:38:07.610
but we don't want to have these
refugees because they are not

00:38:07.610 --> 00:38:11.030
well educated enough
in most of the cases.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:15.290
And somehow there's
no idea of giving them

00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:20.980
some years for perhaps
learning something, which--

00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:23.950
[SPEAKING GERMAN] we
can can do this later.

00:38:23.950 --> 00:38:26.090
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
so I thought, OK, I

00:38:26.090 --> 00:38:28.680
put aside the book I
already had started.

00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:32.390
And then I thought,
OK, I just started.

00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:35.672
And then I went--

00:38:35.672 --> 00:38:38.990
So did you know right away--

00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:41.960
when you read that article
in the paper and you felt,

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:44.740
what then must we do,
was your first thought,

00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:47.952
I must like Richard go and
find out who these people are

00:38:47.952 --> 00:38:49.910
and what's going on or
was your first thought I

00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:53.270
must write a novel?

00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:54.540
What was the thinking one?

00:38:54.540 --> 00:38:56.080
I must write a novel.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:01.220
[SPEAKING GERMAN] yeah, my
idea was, I must write a novel.

00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:05.160
So I could also
give German lessons.

00:39:05.160 --> 00:39:06.930
But I thought I should do--

00:39:06.930 --> 00:39:07.850
But you do.

00:39:07.850 --> 00:39:14.729
--what I like to do and
what I'm here for, perhaps.

00:39:14.729 --> 00:39:15.270
I don't know.

00:39:19.350 --> 00:39:20.320
You never know.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:22.990
Only in the end.

00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:29.100
[SPEAKING GERMAN] and then I
went into the middle of things.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:33.825
I just started to make contact
with a group of refugees.

00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:40.440
They had been living
in tents for 2 years

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:47.230
by then on a square in Berlin,
in the middle of Berlin.

00:39:47.230 --> 00:39:50.160
And this was where
I first met them.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:52.720
And I'm--

00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.440
Sorry, and this would be 2013?

00:39:55.440 --> 00:39:57.840
This was 2014.

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.790
So first, I asked Richard.

00:39:59.790 --> 00:40:05.520
I did some reading
and researching.

00:40:05.520 --> 00:40:15.270
And then it's like you cannot
imagine how far it is even

00:40:15.270 --> 00:40:23.160
if it's in your own city to
make a contact or to just appear

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:26.670
and say, hello, I'm going to
write a novel or something like

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:30.750
that, which really seems to be
a completely stupid sentence

00:40:30.750 --> 00:40:33.620
in this surrounding.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:39.270
And the refugees,
they had been object

00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:43.440
to films, documentary
films or short interviews

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:46.380
before, or like
sometimes journalists

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:50.300
would pass by and write an
article or something like that.

00:40:50.300 --> 00:40:53.130
They knew that there are
some people also interested

00:40:53.130 --> 00:40:55.800
in their fears.

00:40:55.800 --> 00:41:01.560
But they had no idea
what a novel is for.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:04.920
And so they thought,
after a few weeks,

00:41:04.920 --> 00:41:09.230
they thought the novel
should be finished soon.

00:41:09.230 --> 00:41:11.600
Some weeks passed, and
I come again and again.

00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.890
And what's going on?

00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.590
The real talks
started when I went

00:41:23.590 --> 00:41:25.530
in the house for
the elderly people,

00:41:25.530 --> 00:41:28.220
were Richard also
meets them by chance.

00:41:32.310 --> 00:41:36.291
And so they spent some
months in this house,

00:41:36.291 --> 00:41:38.040
and then they were
brought somewhere else.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:45.470
And then they were sent out
to the street, back to Italy.

00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:50.730
And I always followed them
to all of these places.

00:41:50.730 --> 00:41:52.830
And then when they were
sent out to the streets,

00:41:52.830 --> 00:41:56.640
some would applied to
the church for help,

00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:03.530
and they provided some shelter.

00:42:03.530 --> 00:42:05.390
At church?

00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:08.390
[INAUDIBLE] places at
church, but only for a few.

00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:10.300
And then we would also--

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:15.020
me and my friends would
also try to do our best to--

00:42:15.020 --> 00:42:19.310
[SPEAKING GERMAN],, meanwhile we
knew all of them quite well--

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:23.960
so like 10, 15
people were known.

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:30.880
And of course, if someone
who was your kind of friend

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.920
and he's calling you,
saying, this night

00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:38.090
I have to leave the house
and I don't know where to go,

00:42:38.090 --> 00:42:41.170
you also have a problem.

00:42:41.170 --> 00:42:45.150
And so it was much
less stress than they

00:42:45.150 --> 00:42:50.210
had because I was lying in
my bed in my nice apartment

00:42:50.210 --> 00:42:54.060
and with a nice
family and everything.

00:42:54.060 --> 00:42:56.100
But even for me,
it was stressful.

00:42:56.100 --> 00:43:00.410
And for them, it was, of
course, even more stressful.

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:03.560
So in the course of all this--

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:06.200
and this was the idea
also of the book.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:12.290
It was not only about collecting
refugees, dramatic refugees,

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:15.260
stories, and putting
them into a book.

00:43:15.260 --> 00:43:19.190
The idea was to connect
both worlds that

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:23.480
are so far away from each
other even when in one city.

00:43:23.480 --> 00:43:30.980
So I could feel, when
writing the book in German,

00:43:30.980 --> 00:43:37.350
it took me 30 pages before
the first encounter could

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:38.830
take place.

00:43:38.830 --> 00:43:42.520
And for me, this was a sign
that it's really far away.

00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:45.120
So 30 pages, that's
for a first encounter

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.080
of the main characters.

00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:49.090
It's long.

00:43:49.090 --> 00:43:50.230
I was writing and writing.

00:43:50.230 --> 00:43:54.520
And writing is always, you don't
know how long the way will be.

00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:57.250
You just start until
you see it takes time.

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:00.030
It cannot be like this.

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:05.470
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
in the beginning

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:13.100
it was Richard or in a way
me interviewing the refugees.

00:44:13.100 --> 00:44:22.030
But after some weeks and months,
it became a new kind of present

00:44:22.030 --> 00:44:23.420
that we were sharing--

00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:30.140
so experiences that connected
in a way both worlds.

00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:34.550
Of course I'm
always much happier,

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:37.760
and after the worst
experiences, I

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:41.330
could always go and have
a nice [SPEAKING GERMAN]..

00:44:41.330 --> 00:44:41.890
What is it?

00:44:41.890 --> 00:44:42.390
Dinner.

00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:53.100
But it was funny,
not really funny.

00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:58.860
But in a way, also funny
that by accompanying

00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:03.750
the refugees to all these
offices and the lawyer,

00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:10.500
and doctors, and
the asylum seekers

00:45:10.500 --> 00:45:13.470
office, or the
foreigners office,

00:45:13.470 --> 00:45:20.130
or whatever office Germany
has invented for this problem,

00:45:20.130 --> 00:45:25.830
I explored my own
society, the own society

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:28.560
was the foreign country.

00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:31.860
This was funny in a way.

00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:34.710
And so this that
this became the book.

00:45:34.710 --> 00:45:37.590
I put that the
talks into the book,

00:45:37.590 --> 00:45:41.320
but I also put all these
experiences into the book.

00:45:41.320 --> 00:45:50.180
And Richard, to start, as a
very proper German professor,

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:57.570
retired professor, interviewing
people, all of a sudden

00:45:57.570 --> 00:46:00.360
he finds himself
involved in things

00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:04.050
he never had dreamed of before.

00:46:04.050 --> 00:46:10.520
So for him, it's kind of a
new life of a strange kind.

00:46:10.520 --> 00:46:16.000
It also makes him rethink or
recast his entire conception

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.760
of his profession.

00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:19.480
I mean, he's a
classics professor.

00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:22.540
And suddenly, he's
revisiting all of the myths

00:46:22.540 --> 00:46:25.540
and the classical characters.

00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:29.110
And his whole world, his whole
understanding of the world,

00:46:29.110 --> 00:46:33.290
has shifted by these encounters.

00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:36.880
Yeah, he remembers all of a
sudden that the Greek gods--

00:46:36.880 --> 00:46:38.920
some of them are
based in North Africa.

00:46:43.060 --> 00:46:48.100
So he sees there always has
been a connection of his culture

00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:50.190
to the culture of
the people that

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:55.750
now come from the Northern
African countries.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:47:01.970
He starts thinking about
the Greeks having learned--

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:08.285
he's [INAUDIBLE] saying so that
they learn the art of horse--

00:47:12.480 --> 00:47:13.252
Charioteering.

00:47:13.252 --> 00:47:15.670
Yeah, this, I think that--

00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:16.780
Charioteering.

00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.500
Yeah, [SPEAKING GERMAN].

00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:26.340
They learned it from
the [? Baba ?] people.

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:30.720
So even the Greeks
weren't first at all.

00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:34.280
So there was a
beginning earlier.

00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:41.950
And so he's learning much about
the like 3,000 or 4,000 years

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:54.230
of culture of the [? Tourek. ?]
And just weeks ago, I

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:57.030
was in Morocco and I saw a map.

00:47:57.030 --> 00:48:02.810
And perhaps you know this map,
by [? Idriso, ?] from the 10th

00:48:02.810 --> 00:48:07.730
century, around 1000.

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:12.020
He has made a map which
has not the north on top

00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:17.420
but the south on top,
which is really good to see

00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:21.380
for our point of view.

00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:25.310
And this is a bit
like what Richard

00:48:25.310 --> 00:48:27.190
is experiencing in the book.

00:48:27.190 --> 00:48:34.360
So South Africa is on top,
and Europe is somewhere

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:35.894
on the bottom.

00:48:35.894 --> 00:48:41.860
Si it's not that important
anymore if it's down.

00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:46.730
That makes me think
of a line that I

00:48:46.730 --> 00:48:49.730
think is Richard's
thought in the novel--

00:48:49.730 --> 00:48:52.790
to understand what a
person means or says,

00:48:52.790 --> 00:48:55.430
it's basically necessary
to already know what

00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:57.980
that person means or is saying.

00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:02.000
So is every successful dialogue
just an act of recognition

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:06.704
and is understanding not
a path but a condition?

00:49:06.704 --> 00:49:08.120
And I wanted to
ask you about that

00:49:08.120 --> 00:49:13.880
because, if that were
true, there wouldn't

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:16.620
be a lot of hope for all of us.

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.720
For your professors.

00:49:18.720 --> 00:49:22.640
But just generally, I
mean, our nation right now,

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.360
for the world--

00:49:25.360 --> 00:49:32.150
but it seems as though the
novel has a more optimistic view

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:36.110
in a way because, I mean,
they're living in translation.

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:38.360
Half the time they're speaking
Italian to one another.

00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:46.380
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
it's not optimistic?

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:47.210
No.

00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:54.950
I think it's always like waiting
for the right moment to happen.

00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:59.760
So that reflection
is an optimistic one?

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:00.260
Yeah.

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:03.770
OK, because that's not how
I was reading it as saying

00:50:03.770 --> 00:50:06.380
that basically unless you--

00:50:06.380 --> 00:50:12.110
so if you and I mean something
different by dinner or love

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:15.440
or family, we have
different meanings.

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:19.520
Then I took that
statement to be saying

00:50:19.520 --> 00:50:21.200
we could never
understand one another

00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:25.760
because we would have
to already understand

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:27.234
what that person, what you--

00:50:27.234 --> 00:50:28.650
I would have to
already understand

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:32.190
what you were saying in
order to understand you.

00:50:32.190 --> 00:50:37.490
This would mean it always
has to be exactly the same

00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:39.690
to make it possible to
understand someone else.

00:50:39.690 --> 00:50:41.480
But this is not what I mean.

00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:47.030
What I mean is that you
are like prepared or open

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:56.180
to think in the pattern
of someone else, to--

00:50:56.180 --> 00:50:57.640
So it is optimistic.

00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:58.610
Yeah, it's optimistic.

00:50:58.610 --> 00:51:00.040
It's optimistic.

00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:00.620
OK, good.

00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:04.820
OK, well, that's a relief.

00:51:04.820 --> 00:51:08.450
Because another thing
going through the--

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:11.360
I mean, certainly established at
the beginning from the section

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:14.870
that Jenny read, there's
that body in the water.

00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:17.330
There is that body
under the lake.

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:20.330
And very soon after that,
there's the reference

00:51:20.330 --> 00:51:27.320
to the subterranean passages
under Alexanderplatz and also

00:51:27.320 --> 00:51:30.370
in the Polish village, the
name of which I cannot say.

00:51:30.370 --> 00:51:31.790
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:51:31.790 --> 00:51:33.770
R-Z, it involves--

00:51:33.770 --> 00:51:34.880
I wrote it down.

00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:37.190
[INAUDIBLE] what's the name?

00:51:37.190 --> 00:51:42.830
[SOUNDS] It involved
many s's and z's.

00:51:42.830 --> 00:51:43.590
Wait, wait, wait.

00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:49.980
You spell it R-Z-E-S-Z--

00:51:52.970 --> 00:51:59.240
RzeszÃ³w, RzeszÃ³w,
RzeszÃ³w, RzeszÃ³w, RzeszÃ³w.

00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.570
But he thinks about
that the [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:04.540
like underneath Alexanderplatz.

00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:13.370
Somebody calls to us from afar
there from underneath the lake.

00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:20.720
There are the vestiges
of preexisting towns,

00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:24.230
really subterranean towns
where people have taken

00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:26.390
refuge in difficult times.

00:52:29.110 --> 00:52:31.340
But what abides
for this reader is

00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.450
the sense of the
world under the world,

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:36.200
this world under the surface.

00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:42.380
And then the question is
how you have access to it

00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:44.737
and whether just
listening is enough.

00:52:44.737 --> 00:52:45.570
Is listening enough?

00:52:50.980 --> 00:52:56.580
[SPEAKING GERMAN] so when we
are speaking about how to learn,

00:52:56.580 --> 00:52:59.010
I think listening is not enough.

00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:10.820
So my father is a philosopher,
and his special issue just now

00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:16.110
is competence, which might
sound very common nowadays.

00:53:16.110 --> 00:53:22.440
But he says it's learning
always only takes place or is

00:53:22.440 --> 00:53:25.320
done by own experience.

00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:31.290
If the thing or the subject
or whatever you are learning

00:53:31.290 --> 00:53:34.770
is not connected
to your emotion,

00:53:34.770 --> 00:53:36.450
it will not stay with you.

00:53:36.450 --> 00:53:41.080
So you can be in love
with your professor,

00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:43.620
but you can also
be very interested

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:48.900
because of your family's
history or whatever reason might

00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:53.220
be the connection but
to be mostly emotionally

00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:56.260
connected to you
to make you learn.

00:53:56.260 --> 00:54:02.920
And so it'd be your
own experience.

00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:09.950
So for me, it was only to--

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:13.100
you can read the
refugee stories also

00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:16.730
in newspapers-- well
written, well written,

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:20.570
and moving and everything.

00:54:20.570 --> 00:54:24.440
But when you start sharing--

00:54:24.440 --> 00:54:29.540
no, not sharing, not
sharing, but taking

00:54:29.540 --> 00:54:31.860
parts of the life
of refugees, you

00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:36.865
see all the waiting, all the
empty time they have to spend,

00:54:36.865 --> 00:54:44.900
and all the really complicated
and, in my eyes, a bit or a bit

00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:48.800
more stupid laws
that forbid them

00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:54.110
to work or to make an
apprenticeship or go to school.

00:54:54.110 --> 00:54:57.830
If they arrive
older than 18, they

00:54:57.830 --> 00:55:00.980
are not allowed to
go enter a school

00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:02.570
and to be taken care for.

00:55:02.570 --> 00:55:06.650
But if they come in the age of
17, they are put in the school

00:55:06.650 --> 00:55:08.570
and they get people
caring for them.

00:55:08.570 --> 00:55:12.320
And then 18, OK, we
want to get rid of you.

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.580
Please leave and go
home in your country.

00:55:14.580 --> 00:55:21.410
So do these things, if you are
experiencing by seeing them

00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:24.950
again and again like I did,
it makes a big difference

00:55:24.950 --> 00:55:32.940
because it's so really
really, really hard to--

00:55:32.940 --> 00:55:37.820
and the surviving is not
only the moment of being safe

00:55:37.820 --> 00:55:40.010
at this or that cost.

00:55:40.010 --> 00:55:44.075
It's the surviving
stays hard for years.

00:55:49.310 --> 00:55:55.910
Some of my refugees, they
would get weird ideas.

00:55:55.910 --> 00:56:05.300
One of them said to me, I think
here is no one wanting me.

00:56:05.300 --> 00:56:09.560
I have no place where I
can put my head for sleep.

00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:13.260
I will go to the
[SPEAKING GERMAN]..

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:19.330
The Foreign Legion,
the Foreign Legion.

00:56:19.330 --> 00:56:22.160
Foreign Legion.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:26.130
It's one of the worst
troops one could go it.

00:56:26.130 --> 00:56:27.690
But also, because
then they'd want

00:56:27.690 --> 00:56:29.640
to go back and be
a mercenary in--

00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.460
[SPEAKING GERMAN],, and then
I said, what do you want?

00:56:32.460 --> 00:56:34.590
And he said, ah,
a friend told me

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:37.850
they have such a
good sports program.

00:56:37.850 --> 00:56:43.890
OK, that's a reason for a young
man to join this kind of force.

00:56:43.890 --> 00:56:45.720
And he's a lovely boy.

00:56:45.720 --> 00:56:51.720
So he has no idea that he's
a killer or someway, who

00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:54.090
wants to shoot people.

00:56:54.090 --> 00:56:57.440
And I pretended to be
his mom and forbid.

00:57:01.570 --> 00:57:06.390
But there are many, many others
that no one is listening to,

00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:07.480
no one is taking care.

00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:11.610
No one is saying, like
a mom, you don't do so.

00:57:11.610 --> 00:57:15.720
Many of them have either
left their families

00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:17.400
or they have lost
their families.

00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:20.730
They have no one
taking care for them.

00:57:20.730 --> 00:57:22.830
They have no money of course.

00:57:22.830 --> 00:57:25.020
They cannot found a family.

00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:29.720
They have often very strict
ideas about first having a job,

00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:32.400
then having money,
then founding a family.

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:35.460
And if they can't do so,
they won't have a family.

00:57:35.460 --> 00:57:39.040
They are missing
children in their lives.

00:57:39.040 --> 00:57:41.250
These are all big,
big problems that are

00:57:41.250 --> 00:57:43.740
growing in the course of years.

00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:49.520
So you referred to them as your
refugee, my refugees, you said.

00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:55.146
So your refugees, now four
years later, where are they now?

00:57:55.146 --> 00:58:05.350
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:58:05.350 --> 00:58:10.260
One became mad.

00:58:10.260 --> 00:58:14.380
And I think he ended--

00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:16.010
ended, I don't know--

00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:20.580
but he's in psychiatry in Italy.

00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:24.600
But I couldn't find
out where exactly

00:58:24.600 --> 00:58:27.240
and how he is because
I'm not a family member

00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:30.180
and I'm not given
information about it.

00:58:30.180 --> 00:58:33.300
So I guess he's still there.

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:39.150
And his father didn't
send the papers for him

00:58:39.150 --> 00:58:45.180
that he could be returned
to his home country

00:58:45.180 --> 00:58:49.320
because his father has
the opinion that it would

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:52.390
be better for him in Europe.

00:58:52.390 --> 00:58:53.660
So this is of the--

00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:56.715
So he's institutionalized
in Italy.

00:58:59.400 --> 00:59:04.770
And it seemed to the
church people and to me

00:59:04.770 --> 00:59:12.900
that his madness somehow has
to do with abuse in Europe,

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:17.580
that he was abused by some man.

00:59:17.580 --> 00:59:19.770
Sometimes he was
full of fear when

00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:23.280
he was alone with
this very nice man

00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:25.650
from the church
who cared for him.

00:59:25.650 --> 00:59:27.720
Then he would ask him,
what do you want from me.

00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:35.390
And so, it was our impression
that he experienced bad things

00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:39.480
in Europe, not only in
Africa, during the war.

00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:46.930
And then my main character
of the group, who I always

00:59:46.930 --> 00:59:51.890
used to call the president of
this group, [SPEAKING GERMAN]

00:59:51.890 --> 00:59:55.460
in the refugees heaven.

00:59:55.460 --> 00:59:55.960
Zeus?

00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.600
Zeus?

00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.540
Zeus?

00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.010
In English we say Zeus.

01:00:00.010 --> 01:00:01.370
That's who you mean?

01:00:01.370 --> 01:00:03.080
Yeah, Zeus.

01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.280
I speak ancient Greek, Zeus.

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:12.040
And unfortunately he died.

01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:22.570
He died 1 and 1/2 years ago by
a heart stroke, heart attack.

01:00:22.570 --> 01:00:32.740
And this was also not
what we really wanted

01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:34.750
him to experience in Europe.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:44.650
And then some others,
now in last autumn

01:00:44.650 --> 01:00:51.280
they got permission to stay
with a license to look for work.

01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:52.510
This is the happy.

01:00:52.510 --> 01:00:56.594
So that's three years it
took them, three years.

01:00:56.594 --> 01:00:59.370
No, now it's eight--

01:00:59.370 --> 01:01:02.440
he's 17, four years.

01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:06.490
Four years, or four or
five years for some.

01:01:06.490 --> 01:01:13.460
And only because the church
fought so hard for them

01:01:13.460 --> 01:01:18.340
and there are some
commissions and so--

01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:25.980
but it was, as
far as I know now,

01:01:25.980 --> 01:01:32.040
it's perhaps for 50 of
450, something like that.

01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:33.900
It's a small percentage.

01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:41.550
And the poor guy who was
given a set by us privately--

01:01:41.550 --> 01:01:45.940
so he was not a member of
the so-called church group.

01:01:45.940 --> 01:01:51.970
So he will never,
ever get a document.

01:01:51.970 --> 01:01:52.470
Oh, really?

01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:57.860
So on and so on.

01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:05.380
And one got here, Avat,
he got a kind of a-- it's

01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:06.880
called [SPEAKING GERMAN]
in Germany.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:11.580
This means that he's
allowed to stay,

01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:19.560
but only because of his bad
mental health condition,

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.920
he has been traumatized.

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:25.590
So it's like saying,
we don't want you here

01:02:25.590 --> 01:02:27.970
and you are not really
allowed to work.

01:02:27.970 --> 01:02:29.700
And the foreign
office can always

01:02:29.700 --> 01:02:33.780
say no to whatever
offer he gets.

01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:36.050
He has to apply with an offer.

01:02:36.050 --> 01:02:38.460
And they can say no, and
they don't have the reasons.

01:02:38.460 --> 01:02:40.590
And then he goes
to the next job--

01:02:40.590 --> 01:02:41.900
And applies and they say no.

01:02:41.900 --> 01:02:44.320
And takes the offer in the
asylum seekers foreigners'

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:46.840
offices, no, and
so on and so on.

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:51.950
So we organized a nice
apartment for him,

01:02:51.950 --> 01:02:54.372
and there's he just sitting.

01:02:54.372 --> 01:02:55.080
He's hanging out.

01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.640
But there's not much
of a perspective.

01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.240
And this is one of
the stupid things.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:08.970
It's nice to give someone
who has a problem of whatever

01:03:08.970 --> 01:03:14.700
kind to give him the
permission to stay,

01:03:14.700 --> 01:03:20.290
but of course you can wait for
years that this person will

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:23.330
become well again.

01:03:23.330 --> 01:03:28.110
If you are saying that the next
thing we will do as soon as you

01:03:28.110 --> 01:03:30.600
are well again is
sending you back home.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:33.210
Right, is deport you.

01:03:33.210 --> 01:03:35.460
This doesn't make sense.

01:03:35.460 --> 01:03:39.100
There's one alcoholic.

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.520
It's so funny.

01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:44.100
The German system is really--

01:03:44.100 --> 01:03:46.950
it's nice in a way,
but so the alcoholic

01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:52.530
got permission to stay
because he's ill with his

01:03:52.530 --> 01:03:54.840
being an alcoholic.

01:03:54.840 --> 01:03:58.460
But of course, they can
wait for a 100 years to--

01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:01.230
But he has not much
incentive to quit the habit.

01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:03.910
[INAUDIBLE]

01:04:03.910 --> 01:04:10.410
But it's a recurring
line from the book

01:04:10.410 --> 01:04:14.020
about dead men on a holiday--

01:04:14.020 --> 01:04:18.380
it's citing, was he
a French communist

01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:20.760
or was he a German
communist who was being--

01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:23.490
Yeah, he's a French name.

01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:27.090
--who was arrested
and sentenced to death

01:04:27.090 --> 01:04:29.130
and who described
his fellow communists

01:04:29.130 --> 01:04:31.230
and himself as dead
men on holiday.

01:04:31.230 --> 01:04:34.440
And that's an analogy in
the book to the situation

01:04:34.440 --> 01:04:37.350
of the refugees who have lost--

01:04:37.350 --> 01:04:39.780
what's the difference
between dying on the boat

01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:41.690
and living afterwards?

01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:45.810
This rift between your
former life and everything

01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:51.240
that you knew and this
stateless, contextless

01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:55.770
situation of uncertainty
that you live in?

01:04:55.770 --> 01:05:02.840
I mean, there's
so much to discuss

01:05:02.840 --> 01:05:05.710
in terms of the reality
of the situation.

01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:10.650
I also want to talk, though,
about the making of art

01:05:10.650 --> 01:05:14.850
about this situation and whether
it was a different experience

01:05:14.850 --> 01:05:19.110
than writing your other books,
whether structurally you

01:05:19.110 --> 01:05:20.490
approached it in
a different way,

01:05:20.490 --> 01:05:24.540
whether you were able to write
about it while you were also

01:05:24.540 --> 01:05:28.080
dealing with people
in their lives

01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:30.870
or whether you had to
step back from that

01:05:30.870 --> 01:05:33.030
and have some
distance from the work

01:05:33.030 --> 01:05:37.180
you were doing with the refugees
in order to write about it.

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:41.520
[SPEAKING GERMAN] the luxury
of waiting for the distance,

01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.150
I didn't have.

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:42.816
You didn't have.

01:05:46.300 --> 01:05:50.780
But as a writer, you always
have a bit of a difference--

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:51.590
a distance.

01:05:56.500 --> 01:06:00.870
Yeah, there are some differences
between the former book

01:06:00.870 --> 01:06:08.240
and this book, but in my eyes
the things they have in common

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:16.970
is like my interest in
the way of biography,

01:06:16.970 --> 01:06:29.260
the way of the difference of
which is made just by chance,

01:06:29.260 --> 01:06:34.153
by chance [SPEAKING GERMAN]?

01:06:34.153 --> 01:06:36.659
Chance, you mean literally
like you might turn left

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:38.950
or you might turn right and
that can change everything.

01:06:38.950 --> 01:06:44.410
[SPEAKING GERMAN] and
this I saw clearly also

01:06:44.410 --> 01:06:47.500
in dealing with these
biographies of the refugees.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:55.840
And if you mentioned that
some people are drowning

01:06:55.840 --> 01:06:59.770
and some people are
saved, you will always

01:06:59.770 --> 01:07:04.080
see the dead and the living
and the living and the dead.

01:07:04.080 --> 01:07:05.680
So it's not for me.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.920
It's not like two worlds apart.

01:07:08.920 --> 01:07:11.680
I see it in the same moment
that all these people

01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:19.150
that I met as real persons,
that they could have easily

01:07:19.150 --> 01:07:21.760
been also on the ground
of the Mediterranean Sea

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:25.600
and that at the ground
of the Mediterranean Sea

01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:28.720
there are so many
like my friends

01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.200
that I know so well now.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:40.030
And yeah, and the
question of transition.

01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:50.500
Perhaps I will never
understand what a transition is

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:57.550
and how it happens
because one is living

01:07:57.550 --> 01:08:00.040
a normal life in
Libya, for instance,

01:08:00.040 --> 01:08:02.380
and then he's crossing
the Mediterranean Sea.

01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:04.040
And then he's someone else.

01:08:04.040 --> 01:08:07.845
But he's still
himself or herself.

01:08:10.990 --> 01:08:16.290
So he keeps something
with him or with her,

01:08:16.290 --> 01:08:20.970
which what makes his identity.

01:08:20.970 --> 01:08:26.689
But he loses so many things that
also are part of his identity

01:08:26.689 --> 01:08:31.100
that it's very
hard to say who is.

01:08:31.100 --> 01:08:34.760
This was one of the main
points Avat made clear for me.

01:08:34.760 --> 01:08:38.490
And it's worth talking to
people that have so much life

01:08:38.490 --> 01:08:40.229
experience because it's--

01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:46.359
this I only understood
when I talked to him

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:52.319
that you're not only losing
your country or your family,

01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:53.819
which is bad enough.

01:08:53.819 --> 01:09:00.660
You are also losing yourself
and the system in which

01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:02.560
makes sense.

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.100
And this is a problem.

01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:09.710
If there's no new structure
you can start with,

01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:15.390
it will be very, very
hard to build you anew

01:09:15.390 --> 01:09:22.176
from all the tiny
things around you,

01:09:22.176 --> 01:09:24.369
as you wrote in your book--

01:09:24.369 --> 01:09:25.470
the puzzle, the puzzle.

01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:27.249
Yeah, it's all the
pieces that go--

01:09:27.249 --> 01:09:28.290
The pieces of the puzzle.

01:09:28.290 --> 01:09:31.840
Yes, that go together
to make you who you are.

01:09:31.840 --> 01:09:35.700
There are so many
things that come

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:38.520
to mind and so many stories.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:45.359
And I mean, I feel the case of
the refugees is an extreme one.

01:09:45.359 --> 01:09:48.050
It is an extreme case
of that situation.

01:09:48.050 --> 01:09:51.960
But of course it's true,
I mean, in this country

01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:54.870
where almost everyone
comes from somewhere else,

01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:59.010
if not in the first
generation, then before.

01:09:59.010 --> 01:10:03.420
It's an ongoing-- it's
less radical a rupture,

01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:10.980
but it's an ongoing complication
of how do you communicate

01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:14.940
or can you communicate what
is beneath the surface.

01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:16.020
Does it matter?

01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:17.820
And I think often--

01:10:17.820 --> 01:10:22.320
the novel ends with
Richard saying,

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:25.590
I'd look at the surface, I
realize, because I can't bear--

01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:27.691
I wrote the line down.

01:10:27.691 --> 01:10:29.190
I think that's when
I realized, says

01:10:29.190 --> 01:10:31.300
Richard, that the
things I can endure

01:10:31.300 --> 01:10:34.680
are only just the surface of
what I can't possibly endure,

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.680
like the surface of the sea,
asked [? Khalil. ?] Actually,

01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:41.520
yes, exactly like the
surface of the sea.

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:46.200
And there's some way in
which in our lives each day

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:53.490
we deal only with that
surface because we somehow

01:10:53.490 --> 01:10:56.670
can't contend with all
that lies beneath it.

01:10:56.670 --> 01:10:59.940
In the case of the refugees,
that brings you back

01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:02.910
to the quote I was
citing earlier, which

01:11:02.910 --> 01:11:06.000
I was saying was pessimistic.

01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.570
But I want to hold
onto your optimism,

01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:15.510
but it is this question
of how can these--

01:11:15.510 --> 01:11:18.210
when you lose all that context--

01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:21.930
when we were outside before
and I said two words in German,

01:11:21.930 --> 01:11:23.400
you said, oh, I
see you differently

01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:26.988
when you speak in German.

01:11:26.988 --> 01:11:31.860
And what translation
does to each of us.

01:11:35.220 --> 01:11:36.940
My father was French,
and I speak French.

01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:39.660
But I'm just not
very funny in French.

01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:42.570
And I feel like being
funny is important to me.

01:11:42.570 --> 01:11:45.900
So I always want
who am I, who am

01:11:45.900 --> 01:11:48.440
I in French when I'm not funny.

01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:55.650
But imagine, for Avat, how
much is not translatable

01:11:55.650 --> 01:11:58.230
and especially when he
and Richard or he and you,

01:11:58.230 --> 01:12:00.310
I don't know, but are
speaking in Italian,

01:12:00.310 --> 01:12:05.250
say, in a language
that is foreign to--

01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:07.740
that is a mediated language,
a sort of foreign language

01:12:07.740 --> 01:12:11.170
for both of them.

01:12:11.170 --> 01:12:14.160
It's both miraculous and--

01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.655
Yeah, but the understanding
is bigger than the language.

01:12:21.210 --> 01:12:24.270
So if you are able
to understand it all,

01:12:24.270 --> 01:12:28.780
you can understand just
by looking at someone.

01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.560
Or you will understand.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.880
It's not a question of language.

01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:34.830
In a way, it's also a
question of language,

01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:47.720
but it's [SPEAKING GERMAN]

01:12:50.810 --> 01:12:54.800
There where these small pieces
of sugar in Germany, and there

01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.274
would be written something
like a prophecy, what you are

01:12:59.274 --> 01:12:59.940
and it depends--

01:12:59.940 --> 01:13:01.740
Sort of like a fortune
cookie or something.

01:13:01.740 --> 01:13:03.260
--which pieces of sugar you got.

01:13:03.260 --> 01:13:04.590
And I got one.

01:13:04.590 --> 01:13:06.560
I got a piece of sugar,
and there was written,

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.040
you are good mediator.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:12.750
A good medium, a medium, a
good medium, a good medium.

01:13:12.750 --> 01:13:17.780
And so, perhaps I think
sometimes [INAUDIBLE] the one

01:13:17.780 --> 01:13:19.760
who wanted to join the Foreign--

01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:20.320
Legion.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:23.450
Foreign Legion.

01:13:23.450 --> 01:13:29.300
He normally would say
words like, oh, cool, wow.

01:13:29.300 --> 01:13:31.800
So he's a normal young man.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:37.910
But I can see behind this.

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:40.050
I can see behind and sometimes--

01:13:43.730 --> 01:13:49.320
also by language, but somehow
he told me his life story.

01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:52.340
And then he was very serious.

01:13:52.340 --> 01:13:58.600
And then there was a moment when
he got his birth certificate.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:02.060
And for the first time, he
saw the names of his parents.

01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:04.650
He never knew his parents.

01:14:04.650 --> 01:14:09.950
And this was like he doesn't
need to tell me a story.

01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:12.320
He just comes with
his birth certificate

01:14:12.320 --> 01:14:16.090
showing me the names of her
parents saying, and look,

01:14:16.090 --> 01:14:20.420
I'm a year younger than
I thought, like this.

01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:23.520
And then there's a
whole world behind it,

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:24.740
and you can understand it.

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:31.330
And you see that behind this
person who's saying, hey, cool,

01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:32.300
there's someone else.

01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:37.550
And he has a lot of
experience in the way he's

01:14:37.550 --> 01:14:42.910
dealing with the difficult
situations in his group,

01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:48.080
in which he's staying
now for four years,

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.590
like 10 people in one room
at the moment now and so on.

01:14:52.590 --> 01:14:54.780
And here you could
see that in a way

01:14:54.780 --> 01:14:59.160
he's wise, but not
in terms of language,

01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:00.830
not in terms of language.

01:15:00.830 --> 01:15:02.870
And that's good.

01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:14.890
And so if someone
is touching you,

01:15:14.890 --> 01:15:17.160
then your experience
is also growing

01:15:17.160 --> 01:15:18.690
and you just understand.

01:15:18.690 --> 01:15:20.200
You get with the question.

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:21.640
You get the instrument.

01:15:21.640 --> 01:15:24.280
But it's also-- I think I'm
reminded as you're talking--

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:28.520
I remember as a
child playing with--

01:15:28.520 --> 01:15:30.260
I remember playing
for hours with a girl,

01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:32.390
and she and I didn't
speak the same language.

01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:35.310
But we didn't feel as
though we didn't when

01:15:35.310 --> 01:15:37.660
an entire day went by and we
had a great time together.

01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.210
And we felt as though we
spoke the same language,

01:15:40.210 --> 01:15:44.680
even though we didn't
have any words in common.

01:15:44.680 --> 01:15:46.960
In a minute, I want everybody
here to have a chance

01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:48.240
to ask questions.

01:15:48.240 --> 01:15:51.740
But I just wanted to--

01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:53.530
just thinking
about another thing

01:15:53.530 --> 01:15:58.810
that you've said in an interview
actually seems relevant to me

01:15:58.810 --> 01:16:04.510
here because history is so
important in all your work.

01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:06.940
And here it's these
histories that

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:10.810
come out as if from
under the surface

01:16:10.810 --> 01:16:14.170
that Richard hasn't known and
he does this extra research.

01:16:14.170 --> 01:16:16.670
Because he's an academic, he
goes and reads about the Torah,

01:16:16.670 --> 01:16:18.580
and he learns about things.

01:16:18.580 --> 01:16:23.260
But you've said, I
think history infects

01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:25.960
the lives, the very
private lives of people.

01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:28.420
So you cannot remove
something from history,

01:16:28.420 --> 01:16:31.525
even if you just
want to tell a story.

01:16:34.990 --> 01:16:37.630
And I suppose for me that
raises all sorts of questions

01:16:37.630 --> 01:16:41.290
that I'd love to
hear you speak about.

01:16:41.290 --> 01:16:43.877
One is whether you think it's--

01:16:43.877 --> 01:16:46.210
I mean, I think you're saying
it's not possible to write

01:16:46.210 --> 01:16:48.700
something that's outside--

01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:52.450
that doesn't have the great
weight of history around it.

01:16:52.450 --> 01:17:00.260
And I wonder if that feels
to you a general state.

01:17:00.260 --> 01:17:03.370
We sit here in a room
full of Americans

01:17:03.370 --> 01:17:10.840
for whom this regarding history
is a sport and a pastime.

01:17:10.840 --> 01:17:14.440
And I've only spent
one year in Berlin,

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:18.400
but history is all around.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.320
You can't turn away from it.

01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.440
You can't escape it.

01:17:23.440 --> 01:17:29.335
And I guess I wondered
to what extent you feel--

01:17:29.335 --> 01:17:30.710
this will seem a
pivot in a way--

01:17:30.710 --> 01:17:34.540
that you feel that you are not
just a contemporary writer,

01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:35.980
but a contemporary
German writer,

01:17:35.980 --> 01:17:39.060
whether you feel you're
a contemporary writer--

01:17:39.060 --> 01:17:43.930
a German writer with an
East German heritage,

01:17:43.930 --> 01:17:46.930
whether you feel that all
of those things shape you

01:17:46.930 --> 01:17:51.340
or whether you feel you're
a freer agent in a way--

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:58.930
it's just how that
presence of history

01:17:58.930 --> 01:18:02.800
plays for you in your work and
in your conception of your work

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.640
and of yourself.

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:08.410
Just a little question.

01:18:08.410 --> 01:18:11.740
When I started writing,
I didn't know that I

01:18:11.740 --> 01:18:13.910
was interested in history.

01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:24.720
And I always started at
some very concrete point

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:28.270
that interested me, and
it turned out to be--

01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:38.740
as you said, I ended
up in the middle

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:41.580
of the European
or German history.

01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:43.390
And this might also be because--

01:18:47.170 --> 01:18:50.470
so one side of my
family, my mother's side,

01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:54.270
they were living
in nowadays Poland.

01:18:54.270 --> 01:18:59.830
And at the end of
the war, the women

01:18:59.830 --> 01:19:05.770
moved to the
nowadays German part.

01:19:05.770 --> 01:19:14.360
And my grandmother, was before
she was taken and brought

01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:20.150
to a prisoners camp in Siberia,
or just taken from the street

01:19:20.150 --> 01:19:21.800
and put into a train.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.440
And she spent like
half a year in Siberia,

01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:28.140
and she made it
back, fortunately.

01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:30.560
So this was one
part of my family.

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:33.260
The other part was
my father's side.

01:19:33.260 --> 01:19:35.450
My grandparents were communists.

01:19:35.450 --> 01:19:39.974
This is one of the
bigger sins in the US.

01:19:39.974 --> 01:19:45.890
But I always felt very proud
to have had grandparents

01:19:45.890 --> 01:19:49.520
that fought against
the fascist regime,

01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:53.120
and I'm still proud of it.

01:19:53.120 --> 01:20:00.330
And they had to leave Germany
right from the beginning.

01:20:00.330 --> 01:20:04.960
When Hitler was elected,
they left for Prague

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.120
and then went to
the Soviet Union.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:14.530
And they also survived the
Stalin time, the dark years

01:20:14.530 --> 01:20:21.790
of the 30s when
communists were killed

01:20:21.790 --> 01:20:26.720
by other communists, which
didn't make any sense at all.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.240
And they made it back.

01:20:28.240 --> 01:20:35.650
So in both parts of my family,
there is the German history--

01:20:35.650 --> 01:20:36.520
Right there.

01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:37.260
--right there.

01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:41.320
So even if I would like
to avoid these stories,

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:45.460
I couldn't because they are
stories of leaving things

01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:52.600
behind, of only taking one
suitcase, and the question

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:58.210
how to save the children and
who will make it back and how

01:20:58.210 --> 01:21:00.490
and also the question
of surviving.

01:21:00.490 --> 01:21:02.740
My father was born
in the immigration,

01:21:02.740 --> 01:21:05.360
and not many babies
survived this time.

01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:11.200
So it was always the
luck that made us.

01:21:14.560 --> 01:21:20.050
Yeah, so as it turned out,
this is part of my life too.

01:21:20.050 --> 01:21:24.957
And do you feel, in some
way, do you feel at all--

01:21:24.957 --> 01:21:26.540
these are obviously
personal stories--

01:21:26.540 --> 01:21:30.500
but do you feel, in some
way, a sort of responsibility

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:32.660
as a German writer to
tell certain stories

01:21:32.660 --> 01:21:38.430
or to fill in certain gaps
in the literary history?

01:21:38.430 --> 01:21:40.700
Or do you feel you're
part of a community

01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:44.140
or a chorus of writers or?

01:21:44.140 --> 01:21:46.670
[SPEAKING GERMAN]
I must confess,

01:21:46.670 --> 01:21:52.140
the only responsibility I feel
is to write what interests me.

01:21:52.140 --> 01:21:58.370
So I think if I'm lucky, someone
else is also interested in it.

01:21:58.370 --> 01:22:00.690
It seems like we are.

01:22:00.690 --> 01:22:09.490
[SPEAKING GERMAN] but the main
thing for me is that there is

01:22:09.490 --> 01:22:15.110
something that is interesting
enough to need time to think

01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:24.270
about, and the writing is a way
to deal with it and to add to--

01:22:24.270 --> 01:22:28.770
like build a
complex, what is it?

01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:34.140
Entity of things that
are working together

01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:37.350
in a sense that perhaps
no one expected.

01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:42.000
So at the end of days or--

01:22:46.700 --> 01:22:51.510
yeah, I think the
most interesting thing

01:22:51.510 --> 01:22:54.240
is to change the
perspective again and again

01:22:54.240 --> 01:23:03.330
and again and not to
put your attention only

01:23:03.330 --> 01:23:08.280
to the things in the
middle, like that someone is

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:11.890
politically engaged and
he's suffering whatever.

01:23:11.890 --> 01:23:14.470
Perhaps there's a
tiny little detail

01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:18.360
in the beginning of the
life of the main character

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:20.500
and there's a tiny
little detail.

01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:25.260
And perhaps this makes the
sense of the whole life

01:23:25.260 --> 01:23:29.890
and to the end when she is 90
and all the things in between,

01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:33.590
like the love, and the
political engagement,

01:23:33.590 --> 01:23:37.650
and being famous, and
sitting in Harvard.

01:23:37.650 --> 01:23:41.170
All this perhaps it's not
the most important thing,

01:23:41.170 --> 01:23:43.690
and perhaps it was
important that I

01:23:43.690 --> 01:23:47.660
put a stone from the
earth, when I was a child--

01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:48.960
I don't know.

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.430
You never know.

01:23:50.430 --> 01:23:52.090
And this interests very much.

01:23:52.090 --> 01:23:53.850
It's going to make
me ask one l--

01:23:53.850 --> 01:23:55.470
sorry, everybody, one last
question, and then I'm

01:23:55.470 --> 01:23:56.678
going to turn it over to you.

01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:01.080
Now where did they go?

01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:02.280
Where did it go?

01:24:02.280 --> 01:24:08.745
It's on page-- it's where it
says, where he says, page 16.

01:24:12.890 --> 01:24:16.610
And I want to ask you
about the balance between--

01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:18.770
as writers, we
deal in the matter

01:24:18.770 --> 01:24:24.620
of sort of chairs and tables and
cups of coffee and underwear,

01:24:24.620 --> 01:24:26.960
and then also
somehow in the matter

01:24:26.960 --> 01:24:30.680
of the metaphysical or
the existential questions

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.680
or the great themes of history.

01:24:33.680 --> 01:24:41.600
And he says-- I'm just going
to read you guys a little bit--

01:24:41.600 --> 01:24:43.400
he slices onions for the salad.

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:45.440
He's been slicing
onions all his life,

01:24:45.440 --> 01:24:47.780
but just recently he saw
in a cookbook the best way

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:50.240
to hold the onion to
keep it from sliding out

01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:51.470
from under the knife.

01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:53.760
There's an ideal
form for everything,

01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:55.910
not just in matters
of work and art

01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:59.360
but also for the most
mundane ordinary things.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:01.220
When it comes down
to it, he thinks

01:25:01.220 --> 01:25:03.260
we probably spend
our entire lives just

01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:05.280
trying to attain this form.

01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:08.060
And when you finally achieved
it in a few different areas,

01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:11.312
you get wiped off the planet.

01:25:11.312 --> 01:25:15.770
So, again, I feel like
you're going to tell me

01:25:15.770 --> 01:25:18.140
that's an optimistic statement.

01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:21.080
And I am going to believe you.

01:25:21.080 --> 01:25:25.610
But I just wanted to ask you
about navigating because you

01:25:25.610 --> 01:25:27.330
really are tackling--

01:25:27.330 --> 01:25:31.430
I mean, you have a very
complex sentence of form.

01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:34.380
You have a complex sentence
of the use of metaphor.

01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:38.270
You're writing novels
that, in each case,

01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:46.670
involve chopping onions or
moving stools or wearing coats

01:25:46.670 --> 01:25:53.890
or whatever it is but are also
about these much bigger themes.

01:25:53.890 --> 01:25:56.090
And I just wanted to
ask you how much--

01:25:56.090 --> 01:26:00.510
how consciously you have
to strike that balance

01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:05.860
or whether it's intuitive,
whether it just comes naturally

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.360
or whether there's
something you can

01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:13.076
impart to the audience
about how you go about it.

01:26:13.076 --> 01:26:14.920
[SPEAKING GERMAN]

01:26:19.100 --> 01:26:25.500
Mostly just right, and it
just comes as it comes.

01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:35.040
But sometimes-- I remember
complaining to my husband,

01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:40.740
saying, oh, today now
it's really enough.

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:42.570
I wrote too much plot.

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:48.940
I have to get rid of
this writing plot.

01:26:48.940 --> 01:26:51.830
It's enough.

01:26:51.830 --> 01:26:53.810
It's so boring,
and it's so banal.

01:26:53.810 --> 01:26:56.670
So, OK.

01:26:56.670 --> 01:27:03.300
But of course, a book a needs a
kind of people doing something

01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:06.660
or like entering the room
before they can speak at least

01:27:06.660 --> 01:27:08.520
or whatever.

01:27:08.520 --> 01:27:11.310
Reinhard was pretty good at
having people do very little.

01:27:11.310 --> 01:27:13.130
You can have a whole book
where somebody opens the door

01:27:13.130 --> 01:27:14.470
and goes into a
room and that's it.

01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:16.469
[SPEAKING GERMAN] But
there were other days when

01:27:16.469 --> 01:27:20.460
I would complain about the
opposite, saying, oh, god

01:27:20.460 --> 01:27:22.230
there was too much philosophy.

01:27:22.230 --> 01:27:24.450
I can't stand the
philosophy anymore,

01:27:24.450 --> 01:27:25.840
and this is really boring.

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:28.930
And it's [INAUDIBLE],,
and I have to stop it.

01:27:28.930 --> 01:27:33.960
So it's a mixed of both,
and I think it's always

01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:40.880
good to come back to--

01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:45.060
first, to have a
good imagination,

01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:49.120
but to leave out everything
which is not really necessary.

01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:51.720
So I was studying
theater in the beginning,

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:56.930
and we learned that every
scene that is not necessary you

01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:58.380
can be cut.

01:27:58.380 --> 01:28:02.400
So all of my novels are also a
cut version of a theater play,

01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:03.730
so to say.

01:28:03.730 --> 01:28:06.930
So I only leave
inside what I really

01:28:06.930 --> 01:28:10.920
need because all other
things are boring

01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:14.640
and are slowing the whole thing.

01:28:14.640 --> 01:28:17.800
And it's not good.

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:24.700
And yeah, yeah.

01:28:24.700 --> 01:28:28.550
So do you write do you
write longer and then cut?

01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:30.522
Or do you just cut as you go?

01:28:30.522 --> 01:28:31.605
You know it's dispensable.

01:28:31.605 --> 01:28:33.060
I cut in my head.

01:28:33.060 --> 01:28:34.000
That's very efficient.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:34.886
That's great.

01:28:34.886 --> 01:28:37.280
I do.

01:28:37.280 --> 01:28:42.780
Yeah, this is my thickest book.

01:28:42.780 --> 01:28:46.100
In Germany, it's a bit bigger.

01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:50.880
And yeah, I like to cut.

01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:53.530
And I don't want to be bored.

01:28:53.530 --> 01:28:55.470
I'm my first reader.

01:28:55.470 --> 01:28:59.400
And if I get bored,
something is wrong.

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:07.330
And yeah, my mother
always used to say,

01:29:07.330 --> 01:29:08.890
so what did you want to say.

01:29:08.890 --> 01:29:10.810
This and that.

01:29:10.810 --> 01:29:11.690
Then say it.

01:29:11.690 --> 01:29:12.380
Then tell it.

01:29:15.900 --> 01:29:17.710
Be clear and not--

01:29:17.710 --> 01:29:19.370
Or my husband once--

01:29:22.810 --> 01:29:23.750
he's Austrian.

01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:25.420
Sometimes he's in Austria.

01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:28.200
So we are calling each other,
and then I'm reading him

01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:31.250
some passages I have finished.

01:29:31.250 --> 01:29:34.920
And I read to him a
passage, and then he

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:37.250
would say, ah, it's good.

01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:38.290
It's good.

01:29:38.290 --> 01:29:43.090
But somehow it's a
bit too much art.

01:29:43.090 --> 01:29:44.530
There's something wrong with it.

01:29:44.530 --> 01:29:46.480
It's too much art.

01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:54.880
And I kept this in mind because,
if there's too much art,

01:29:54.880 --> 01:29:55.810
I'm happy.

01:29:55.810 --> 01:30:01.850
I can do a lot if I
want to, but I wouldn't.

01:30:01.850 --> 01:30:04.200
If it's not necessary,
you shouldn't--

01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:11.330
tell the people what you
want to tell and that's it.

01:30:11.330 --> 01:30:16.010
As a friend of mine says, state
your needs and move to closure.

01:30:16.010 --> 01:30:17.980
Not quite, but thank you.

01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:19.610
So now maybe it's time--

01:30:19.610 --> 01:30:22.820
if you guys would like to
come to the microphones,

01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:29.097
if people have questions, by
all means come and ask away.

01:30:34.950 --> 01:30:38.000
Some people may need to leave.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:39.985
If people don't have a
question, beware, I'm

01:30:39.985 --> 01:30:40.860
going to ask another.

01:30:40.860 --> 01:30:41.360
Do come.

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:50.300
Sorry.

01:30:54.600 --> 01:30:56.180
Thank you very much.

01:30:59.750 --> 01:31:03.230
A number of things
came to my mind.

01:31:03.230 --> 01:31:10.250
And amongst them, I wanted
to know, first of all,

01:31:10.250 --> 01:31:21.110
what do you think the Germans
learnt from the Nazi period?

01:31:21.110 --> 01:31:23.270
What do you think the
lessons of the Nazi period

01:31:23.270 --> 01:31:29.720
were for this particular
refugee moment where--

01:31:29.720 --> 01:31:32.280
this is a question I was
asked on Munich Television.

01:31:32.280 --> 01:31:35.210
So I'm asking you
now how to answer.

01:31:35.210 --> 01:31:38.180
I don't think did a good job,
but I was asked this in Munich.

01:31:38.180 --> 01:31:40.490
So what do you think
that experience has done?

01:31:40.490 --> 01:31:46.580
Because looking at the
situation from America

01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:49.640
or the Gulf or many
other countries other

01:31:49.640 --> 01:31:51.470
than the African
countries, we think

01:31:51.470 --> 01:31:57.680
that the Germans have done
better than most in this way.

01:31:57.680 --> 01:32:04.070
The whole hospitality to
the refugees is problematic,

01:32:04.070 --> 01:32:09.680
but I think that there was
something that they learnt

01:32:09.680 --> 01:32:14.060
deeply about minorities.

01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:15.710
Doesn't mean that
it's disseminated

01:32:15.710 --> 01:32:17.030
through the country.

01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:20.880
But the fact that Germany
stands out in Europe

01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:24.110
says something to me
about that past history,

01:32:24.110 --> 01:32:27.170
given the history that
you also talked about,

01:32:27.170 --> 01:32:31.070
and how it might have
created a change now

01:32:31.070 --> 01:32:35.910
despite the absurdities of
the law that you mentioned.

01:32:35.910 --> 01:32:38.190
So that's the first
question I wanted to ask.

01:32:38.190 --> 01:32:41.150
And the other one goes
from the other side, which

01:32:41.150 --> 01:32:45.230
is that you have very
carefully shown in the book,

01:32:45.230 --> 01:32:47.630
but also in this
conversation, how

01:32:47.630 --> 01:32:51.440
in order to be
able to empathize,

01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:55.170
the issue is not simply about
translation and language,

01:32:55.170 --> 01:33:00.050
it's about a kind of existential
or phenomenological empathy,

01:33:00.050 --> 01:33:02.800
that somebody shows
you something small

01:33:02.800 --> 01:33:05.900
and you see what's behind it.

01:33:05.900 --> 01:33:13.250
How can that be communicated to
people who are anti refugees?

01:33:13.250 --> 01:33:17.290
What work must be
done to create that?

01:33:17.290 --> 01:33:20.300
What institutions
must put in place?

01:33:20.300 --> 01:33:22.370
You talked about the Church.

01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:25.520
What other kind-- and that
is an institutional moment.

01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:27.920
What other kinds
of things do you

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:34.370
think society must do to be
able to create this unspoken,

01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:38.370
not necessarily
accurately translated

01:33:38.370 --> 01:33:41.904
relationship of coexistence.

01:33:41.904 --> 01:33:45.040
OK, these are really--

01:33:45.040 --> 01:33:49.050
Two, small, light questions.

01:33:49.050 --> 01:33:54.790
The first question I
would say that it's

01:33:54.790 --> 01:34:02.310
true the Germans seem to
have learned a lot from what

01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:09.180
their ancestors did wrong
some 50, 60, 70 years--

01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:10.590
no, a bit more--

01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:11.550
70 years ago.

01:34:14.230 --> 01:34:20.160
The problem was that somehow it
was left to the private people

01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:21.750
to be solved.

01:34:21.750 --> 01:34:35.680
And of course, the things
that are not enabled by law,

01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:39.780
cannot be enabled
by private persons.

01:34:39.780 --> 01:34:44.650
All help doesn't make any
sense if someone is not allowed

01:34:44.650 --> 01:34:47.910
to stay and to apply for work.

01:34:47.910 --> 01:34:49.750
[INAUDIBLE]

01:34:49.750 --> 01:34:55.660
And many, many private people
that did very, very good

01:34:55.660 --> 01:35:00.950
work and started
teaching refugees.

01:35:00.950 --> 01:35:09.480
All of them came to this
border off of the law

01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:15.580
because there were not--

01:35:15.580 --> 01:35:19.750
for the Assyrians, we made some
exceptions, but because they

01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:24.880
were educated of course also.

01:35:24.880 --> 01:35:28.860
But for the Africans were
not made any exceptions.

01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:31.620
And there was not even--

01:35:31.620 --> 01:35:38.880
I wouldn't say it was
not even because nobody

01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:41.280
knew about Libya,
but it was also

01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:43.590
because people, like
the politicians,

01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:45.990
knew what happened in Libya.

01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:51.000
And the Africans, at
least my group, they

01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.400
were the victims
of the wrong side

01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:56.850
because, in Libya, the
revolution started.

01:35:56.850 --> 01:36:01.240
This was something glorious,
and that the revolution

01:36:01.240 --> 01:36:05.610
produced victims, nobody
didn't want to hear.

01:36:05.610 --> 01:36:08.490
They were the victims
of the wrong side,

01:36:08.490 --> 01:36:13.470
which is also something one
can think about a long time.

01:36:13.470 --> 01:36:23.350
And the other question is
more difficult to Answer.

01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:37.630
It's not so easy to say we
know what is right and wrong,

01:36:37.630 --> 01:36:43.800
and we only have to bring all
people to our state of mind,

01:36:43.800 --> 01:36:46.460
which is the right one.

01:36:46.460 --> 01:36:49.390
This is a difficult thing to do.

01:36:52.210 --> 01:36:57.160
The people that are
aggressive against refugees,

01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:00.470
now especially in East Germany,
and also in West Germany,

01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:05.720
but more unfortunately
East Germany,

01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:12.790
I think this is not a
question of teaching.

01:37:12.790 --> 01:37:16.360
This is a question of how--

01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:21.580
so what experiences they made
during the fall of the wall,

01:37:21.580 --> 01:37:29.590
after the fall of the war,
how little the respect was

01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:34.300
for their have biographies,
how little their respect was

01:37:34.300 --> 01:37:42.090
for their achievements, and
how little their chances where

01:37:42.090 --> 01:37:46.300
on the West German market.

01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:51.280
So this is not just
about speaking to them,

01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:54.250
telling them you should
accept the refugees.

01:37:54.250 --> 01:37:59.110
Also it should start earlier,
or we should go back in history.

01:37:59.110 --> 01:38:00.420
But we can't.

01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.540
This is a problem.

01:38:01.540 --> 01:38:03.070
But there is--
sorry, [INAUDIBLE]

01:38:03.070 --> 01:38:05.250
there is a problem
with that, as much

01:38:05.250 --> 01:38:09.530
as I agreed with you,
that these conditions have

01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:12.205
effects, when you
yourself had treated

01:38:12.205 --> 01:38:14.892
your own country
like a foreigner,

01:38:14.892 --> 01:38:18.110
as many East Germans
were [INAUDIBLE]..

01:38:18.110 --> 01:38:20.530
They were treated as if they
came from the global south,

01:38:20.530 --> 01:38:22.600
they were foreigners,
they were outside.

01:38:22.600 --> 01:38:24.610
Of course, it's going
to have an effect.

01:38:24.610 --> 01:38:29.470
But when you lay so much
store on experience,

01:38:29.470 --> 01:38:34.150
I can see that working
brilliantly in a novel.

01:38:34.150 --> 01:38:36.610
But it's difficult
always to say as you just

01:38:36.610 --> 01:38:40.890
said that [INAUDIBLE]
has to start much before

01:38:40.890 --> 01:38:46.140
or be that we've got to be able
to have the experience in order

01:38:46.140 --> 01:38:49.740
to be able to create a politics.

01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:53.200
So I think that is
difficult. And by the way,

01:38:53.200 --> 01:38:58.350
the example of the onion
was a platonic allegory--

01:38:58.350 --> 01:39:01.990
there has to be perfect
way of cutting the onion.

01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:08.460
So I just think that this notion
of how experience is structured

01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:13.420
into change, or transformation,
in a moment of crisis

01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:16.790
is very important idea
of yours on trying

01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:20.789
to understand transition.

01:39:20.789 --> 01:39:21.289
Yeah.

01:39:26.720 --> 01:39:31.860
It's difficult.
The difficult thing

01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:40.130
is that, if you have 100 people
that make the same experience,

01:39:40.130 --> 01:39:44.901
they will behave themselves in
100 different ways afterwards.

01:39:44.901 --> 01:39:45.650
And this is also--

01:39:48.620 --> 01:39:52.490
for Richard as it is
for me, the experience

01:39:52.490 --> 01:39:59.940
of being somehow like a stranger
after the fall of the wall

01:39:59.940 --> 01:40:03.670
just turned me into someone
who feels empathy for people

01:40:03.670 --> 01:40:07.160
that are strange somewhere.

01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:10.070
But other people,
they would just

01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:15.020
keep the fear of a
breakdown, of a break

01:40:15.020 --> 01:40:17.900
down of a whole society.

01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:20.750
And it's also a family
question of generations.

01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:23.960
And this is also what brought
me to write the book because I

01:40:23.960 --> 01:40:27.620
think it's so short-sighted
to think only about

01:40:27.620 --> 01:40:30.620
now, how to solve
the problem, where

01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:32.360
to put all these refugees.

01:40:32.360 --> 01:40:36.110
The best would be that
they stay in Africa.

01:40:36.110 --> 01:40:39.700
It's a problem of generations,
of the next three and four

01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:43.250
and five generations, as I can
see from my family's story.

01:40:43.250 --> 01:40:48.140
And it's also how the
experience is communicated

01:40:48.140 --> 01:40:50.160
within the families.

01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:54.380
So if someone his job
after the fall of the war,

01:40:54.380 --> 01:40:57.660
he will have been
full of disappointment

01:40:57.660 --> 01:41:02.000
about the West and his
hopes and perhaps he

01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.440
was happy in the first moment.

01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:06.350
And then he was the
idiot in the end,

01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:09.380
and he would communicate this
experience to his children,

01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:16.520
to his grandchildren, and there
will be a hatred kept alive

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:17.600
in the families.

01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:19.400
And this was very
hard-- for instance,

01:41:19.400 --> 01:41:23.160
there was never ever, in a
way I was happy about it,

01:41:23.160 --> 01:41:25.850
but in a way, I was also
disappointed-- there was never

01:41:25.850 --> 01:41:28.880
ever a Nazi in one
of my readings,

01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:32.510
and I really had a lot
of readings in Germany.

01:41:32.510 --> 01:41:37.530
And there was no one to
really discuss against me,

01:41:37.530 --> 01:41:41.510
which was in a way a relief.

01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:47.560
But it was also a pity that
there is not even a talk.

01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:50.120
Thank you.

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:54.140
You were speaking-- one of the
things that really moves me

01:41:54.140 --> 01:41:58.430
about the book is that
Richard is from GDR,

01:41:58.430 --> 01:42:02.810
and you're speaking
now to what's

01:42:02.810 --> 01:42:08.780
on my mind, which is that
dynamic between the East

01:42:08.780 --> 01:42:15.320
European who's swallowed
up in a larger Germany

01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:22.660
and that matter of displacement,
internal displacement, that I

01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:27.890
think is a part of that
history of yours and his.

01:42:27.890 --> 01:42:32.570
I mean, even the things that
the refugees go through,

01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:37.360
sitting in offices for
hours, or the wasted time.

01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:41.120
And I myself lived in a
post-communist country

01:42:41.120 --> 01:42:43.970
in those days for
a long time and was

01:42:43.970 --> 01:42:45.980
a psychotherapist there.

01:42:45.980 --> 01:42:51.680
And there were
such vestiges, even

01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:58.040
after the change of regime,
of the earlier regime.

01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:01.400
So if there is
just more that you

01:43:01.400 --> 01:43:07.980
want to say about that dynamic
between the East European story

01:43:07.980 --> 01:43:12.520
and the immigration story,
I would be interested.

01:43:16.440 --> 01:43:19.810
[SPEAKING GERMAN] I think
that the problem was

01:43:19.810 --> 01:43:28.270
that there were many good people
in the GDR, in East Germany

01:43:28.270 --> 01:43:33.070
and that were hoping,
in the first moments

01:43:33.070 --> 01:43:36.410
of the so-called
peaceful revolution

01:43:36.410 --> 01:43:40.960
and so on, that
they even started

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:47.480
this peaceful revolution
in order to have a way

01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:55.540
of founding a GDR where the
right people are in the right

01:43:55.540 --> 01:44:06.250
places to get rid of the old
and old fashioned and rigid

01:44:06.250 --> 01:44:15.490
government and to have their
own new system in a better way.

01:44:15.490 --> 01:44:20.410
The problem was that
there was no time.

01:44:20.410 --> 01:44:24.240
The West said, OK,
we will accept you.

01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:25.990
Sorry.

01:44:25.990 --> 01:44:27.550
Now the medication--

01:44:27.550 --> 01:44:29.020
Is wearing off.

01:44:29.020 --> 01:44:31.050
--is stopping.

01:44:31.050 --> 01:44:36.940
[SPEAKING GERMAN] and then
there was the reunification

01:44:36.940 --> 01:44:41.890
of two countries of which one
had 40 years of a completely

01:44:41.890 --> 01:44:42.770
different history.

01:44:45.470 --> 01:44:47.900
And until now, the
problem is not solved.

01:44:51.960 --> 01:44:53.227
I'm sorry.

01:44:53.227 --> 01:44:54.060
I think we have to--

01:44:54.060 --> 01:44:54.990
Perhaps, I'm sorry.

01:44:54.990 --> 01:44:56.490
And I know you have
a question, too.

01:44:56.490 --> 01:44:57.120
I apologize.

01:44:57.120 --> 01:44:58.320
Thank you, Jenny, very much.

01:45:03.420 --> 01:45:04.620
Would you like a lozenge?

01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:06.470
A little bit.
