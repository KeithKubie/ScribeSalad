writers don't realize what a process it
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.440
writers don't realize what a process it
is from the moment you have a brilliant

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450
is from the moment you have a brilliant
 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.210
is from the moment you have a brilliant
idea to when you get to the point and

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220
idea to when you get to the point and
 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.180
idea to when you get to the point and
that book completely falls apart and

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190
that book completely falls apart and
 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.490
that book completely falls apart and
every single book you write you have a

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500
every single book you write you have a
 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.700
every single book you write you have a
brilliant idea it falls apart every

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710
brilliant idea it falls apart every
 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.610
brilliant idea it falls apart every
single book and then you have to start

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620
single book and then you have to start
 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.430
single book and then you have to start
scaffolding and building the story again

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440
scaffolding and building the story again
 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.710
scaffolding and building the story again
and starting to ask yourself the big

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720
and starting to ask yourself the big
 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.450
and starting to ask yourself the big
questions about what this book is trying

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460
questions about what this book is trying

how are they going to get what they want
 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.780
how are they going to get what they want
so that's the process and then the next

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790
so that's the process and then the next
 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.150
so that's the process and then the next
process is going out into the world with

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160
process is going out into the world with
 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.240
