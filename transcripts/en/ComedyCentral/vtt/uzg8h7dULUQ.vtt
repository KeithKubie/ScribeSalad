Gronk is good.
We love Gronk around here

00:00:02.903 --> 00:00:05.205
because he's a sports man
you can make jokes about,

00:00:05.239 --> 00:00:07.074
even if you don't know anything
about sports.

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:09.076
'Cause you don't really
have to know anything

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.277
about sports to get Gronk.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.578
He seems kind of harmless,
right?

00:00:11.612 --> 00:00:14.047
Just a lovable NFL star
next door who hates shirts!

00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:16.583
He hates 'em! Aah!

00:00:16.617 --> 00:00:19.219
Grrr. Maybe he hates Florida.

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:20.988
I don't know.
Maybe that's what he hates.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.389
-Nobody wears shirts...
-Yeah, he thinks...

00:00:22.422 --> 00:00:24.391
he thinks he's gonna
get out of Florida this way.

00:00:24.424 --> 00:00:26.894
-I'm gonna get out of here!
-Yeah. That's right.

00:00:26.927 --> 00:00:28.896
Well, now there's
a fun new article in <i>GQ</i>

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:30.697
detailing Gronk's party rules.

00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:32.432
Surprisingly, there's no rule
about having no rules.

00:00:32.466 --> 00:00:34.635
There are a lot of rules here.
Rule number three:

00:00:34.668 --> 00:00:36.103
"Take off your shirt."
We covered that.

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.571
Rule six: "Dance on tables."

00:00:37.604 --> 00:00:40.040
Rule seven:
"Just because everyone wants

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:42.042
"to have sex with you
doesn't mean

00:00:42.075 --> 00:00:43.944
you should have sex
with everyone."

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:46.580
-(laughter) -HELLER: I wish
I'd known that in college.

00:00:46.613 --> 00:00:49.016
-(laughter) -HARDWICK:
There was no Gronk then.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:50.551
-Now he's here to tell you.
-Yeah.

00:00:50.584 --> 00:00:52.319
Comedians, what are
some other rules to observe

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:53.854
when partying with Gronk?

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:57.424
-Janelle. -Uh, formal wear is
a three-popped collar minimum.

00:00:57.457 --> 00:00:59.259
-Yeah, all right. All right.
-(laughter)

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:00.761
Points. Emily.

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:04.298
Uh, no hanky-panky-- you
have to call it Gronky-ponky.

00:01:04.331 --> 00:01:06.233
(laughter)

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:09.069
-(applause)
-Mom! Mom!

00:01:09.102 --> 00:01:11.171
Come on, Mom!

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:14.441
Mom, just drop me off
a block from the mall!

00:01:14.474 --> 00:01:16.009
Points. Kurt.

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:18.579
Uh, when feeding Gronk,
make sure to hold the food

00:01:18.612 --> 00:01:21.281
in the palm of your hand
and keep your fingers out flat

00:01:21.315 --> 00:01:22.850
or else he might
nibble your fingers

00:01:22.883 --> 00:01:22.950
-by accident. -Doesn't want to
bite the fingers, yeah, yeah.
