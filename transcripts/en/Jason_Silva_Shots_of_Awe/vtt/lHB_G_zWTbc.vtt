00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.510
SPEAKER: We live in a world
of exponential technological

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:05.630
advancements.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:08.640
What this literally means is
that we have new construction

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.400
kits for our reality,
new tools with which

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.290
to probe at the
adjacent possible.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.030
So consider the implications.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:18.840
As Marshall McLuhan used to
say, first we build the tools,

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.900
and then the tools build us.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.860
We are designed by
what we have designed.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.970
There are these feedback loops
of mind, tool, and world that

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.690
radically redefine our
boundaries, that radically

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:32.950
transform what it
means to be human.

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.760
To be human today is to
criss-cross the skies.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.700
To be human today is to create
technosocial wormholes ,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.228
mind-to-mind communication that
overcomes the limits of time,

00:00:42.228 --> 00:00:43.620
the limit of space,
and distance.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.560
So what do we do?

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:47.910
Well, we need to radically
reach out to one another

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.430
in ways we haven't before.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.950
There's a great line that
says, empathy rarely extends

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.490
beyond our lin-of-sight.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.700
In other words, if it's out
of sight, it is out of mind.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.590
But if anything, these wireless
communication technologies

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:03.270
are radically extending
our line-of-sight.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.680
They provide new ontological
maps of the real.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.838
They're giving us the
astronaut overview effect.

00:01:08.838 --> 00:01:10.324
We are seeing the
big picture; we

00:01:10.324 --> 00:01:13.280
are seeing that we are the
captains of spaceship earth.

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.120
And what shall we do?

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.850
We need to extend our
hands to one another.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.686
We never had such
tools to overcome

00:01:19.686 --> 00:01:21.310
all of the limitations
of our humanity.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.262
We have the power,
we have the will,

00:01:23.262 --> 00:01:25.702
we have the capacity,
the creative capacity,

00:01:25.702 --> 00:01:28.142
to overcome our limits.

00:01:28.142 --> 00:01:31.558
And so today, billions of
us linking to one another,

00:01:31.558 --> 00:01:34.150
creating a global
node, a global brain.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.146
What is the new
definition of billionaire?

00:01:37.146 --> 00:01:38.520
The new definition
of billionaire

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.310
is he who will positively affect
the lives of a billion people.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.165
He or she who will
reach out and say I

00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:48.684
will positively affect the
lives of a billion people.

00:01:48.684 --> 00:01:50.460
This should be our goal.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.160
This is our responsibility.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.510
Here's our chance.
