CHRISTMAS ABBOTT: In
my road, in my life.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.220
I was [INAUDIBLE], and
I think that adolescence

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.092
is very influential.

00:00:06.092 --> 00:00:07.550
I'd already been
smoking cigarettes

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:09.650
since I was nine,
kind of experimenting.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:12.680
But I started regularly
smoking at the age of 13

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.240
because my parents smoked.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.370
And so it was there.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.280
It was easy access.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.270
At 13, I also started
drinking excessively

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.380
and doing a lot
of drugs, whatever

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.410
I could get my hands on.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.080
I didn't really care
about what it was.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.290
I continued this lifestyle
all through my teens

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.340
and into my early 20s.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.200
And during this time
in my early 20s,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.170
my mother ended up
taking a job in Iraq

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.924
as a civilian contractor.

00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:38.340
This was the first
time in history

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.776
that the civilians were
embedded with the military

00:00:41.776 --> 00:00:43.400
for the operation
that they were doing.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.170
So that was Operation
Iraqi Freedom.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.992
And she kept telling
me, Christmas, this

00:00:48.992 --> 00:00:49.950
is what you need to do.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:50.866
You need to come over.

00:00:50.866 --> 00:00:53.660
This is going to be an amazing
culture experience for you.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.050
You'll be able to have some
money to pay for school.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.900
And at the time, I
was working at a bar,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.190
drinking excessively, doing
drugs, and having a party

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.680
lifestyle as a 21, 22-year-old
should-- or at least I thought.

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.098
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:12.310
And she recognized the
path that I was on,

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.940
and she was willing to put
me into an active war zone

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.630
to save my life.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:18.300
That's a mama's love.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.140
So I harassed the
company for six months.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.620
I applied every week for six
months until they hired me.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.862
And I got hired on as
a laundry attendant.

00:01:25.862 --> 00:01:28.070
You brought me your laundry,
and I gave you a ticket,

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.850
and hopefully three
days later, it

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.970
came back clean and not lost.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.838
We had a lot of claims.

00:01:34.838 --> 00:01:39.110
So I went overseas in Iraq, and
this was actively a war zone.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.600
So this is in
January 2004, where

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.730
we were just kind of getting
our feet on the ground.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.230
You would think
that I was prepared.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.860
You know, I quit drugs
enough to pass the drug test

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.410
and would sit in
class-- true story,

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.220
it's funny-- sit in class
and listen to what we

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.660
had to do when we had incoming.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.895
And I know that I heard
what I was supposed to do,

00:02:03.895 --> 00:02:05.520
but there was no
practical application,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.620
so we didn't practice it.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.740
I should have paid
attention a little closer.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.980
Within the first two
weeks of being in country,

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.570
we had incoming, meaning
mortars or rockets

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.580
coming into your camp.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.070
And the close-- it was
so close in proximity,

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.930
it was about 200-- it was
about 300 to 400 meters

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.500
from where I was sleeping.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.321
And there are specific sounds
that you are familiar with,

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:30.320
and I didn't understand.

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.210
I didn't recognize
any of these sounds.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:34.220
And so it's kind of like
when you're sleeping

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.850
and you hear a noise in
your house that's not right,

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:40.880
and the quietest noise will
take you out of a dead sleep.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.010
This was my first
experience with incoming.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.170
The boom and the
crash was deafening.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.731
I immediately, knee-jerk
reaction, jumped out of bed,

00:02:48.731 --> 00:02:50.480
landed on both my feet,
and looked around.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.540
Did everything wrong.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.060
I was supposed to
roll out of bed.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.518
I was supposed to
put on my Kevlar.

00:02:54.518 --> 00:02:57.000
I was supposed to
radio in that I was OK.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.400
Did everything absolutely wrong.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.680
I'm standing there,
looking around.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.110
And in this moment, I had
such a clear thought process.

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:12.040
It was grossly apparent
to me, a few things.

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.750
One, you always sleep with
clothes on in a war zone.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:16.682
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:16.682 --> 00:03:21.040
Two-- you've got to be
able to run fast. [LAUGHS]

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.050
Priorities happen.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:27.170
And two, I recognized the
behaviors of my lifestyle

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.090
were setting me up to
end up killing myself.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.960
And it sounds drastic
for me to declare that,

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.580
but that's absolutely
what went through my mind.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:36.670
I thought, oh, my God.

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.490
I am going to die
of my own choices.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.020
I was smoking, and civilians
had a different rule,

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.166
so I was also
drinking in country.

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:48.290
We had a bar that we could
bring our own bottle to.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.610
And then three, I'm
in an active war zone,

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.620
and I'm still making
these really poor choices

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.370
about my lifestyle.

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.940
And it just-- it
came to me that I

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:05.140
needed to not necessarily become
a superhero fitness freak,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:07.900
but I needed to make a
better decision for myself.

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.050
And that stemmed from my
desire of not wanting to die.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.450
In life, wherever
you are, you're

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.990
either pushed away
from something

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.149
that you don't want
to be associated with,

00:04:18.149 --> 00:04:21.390
or you're drawn toward something
that you want to emulate more.

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.750
And at this point in
my fitness pendulum,

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.360
it was the first step
to be pushing away

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.710
from that bad lifestyle of
choices, negative choices

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:34.640
that I was making.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.020
It didn't happen overnight.

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.260
This was what we call
the awareness process, is

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.210
I was aware of the bad
choices that I was making,

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.270
so I finally wanted
to make a change.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.659
And I had to build some
confidence to make that change.

00:04:47.659 --> 00:04:49.700
It took me-- the first
thing that I decided to do

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.150
was to quit smoking.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.410
And given I had almost
been smoking for a decade.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.172
It was pretty-- yeah, regularly.

00:04:57.172 --> 00:04:59.130
People were like, oh, you're 22.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:00.150
You'll be fine.

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.694
Well, a decade is a
decade of bad behavior.

00:05:03.694 --> 00:05:05.610
So I decided that I was
going to quit smoking.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.690
It took me three months
to build my confidence

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.110
and to prepare
mentally for this.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:12.780
Three months, and
I quit cold turkey.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.702
I warned everybody.

00:05:13.702 --> 00:05:14.410
I was like, look.

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.137
I'm just going to be a
raging B. Deal with it.

00:05:17.137 --> 00:05:18.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:22.110
So I set everybody
up for success, OK?

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:22.900
Quit smoking.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.577
A couple months later, I decided
that I was going to run a mile.

00:05:25.577 --> 00:05:27.910
Because I hadn't done that
since I was in middle school,

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.155
and I was forced to, so I
really only did it-- like,

00:05:30.155 --> 00:05:34.020
I kind of sped walked in order
to get a passing grade, barely.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.140
And the smartest
thing that I did

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.470
was recruit a friend,
which was also

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:40.410
the stupidest thing that I did.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:43.480
So we'd go into the gym.

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.270
And in Iraq, you
don't run outside.

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:46.660
You run on treadmills.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:48.190
And on treadmills,
you can actually

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.210
set the pace where all you have
to do is pick up your feet.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.850
Right?

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.710
It kind of works for you.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:55.560
The beautiful thing
about treadmills.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:57.865
And I decided I was going
to go run this mile.

00:05:57.865 --> 00:05:59.150
So he ran his mile beside me.

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.530
He finished his mile.

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:02.720
And I was, like, halfway
through with mine.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.730
And I was like,
this is-- I'm done.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.230
I'm done.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.920
And he was like, no, Christmas.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.940
You have to finish.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.990
You started this,
you finish this.

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.430
I was like, OK, fine.

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:11.310
Slow it down.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.102
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:13.102 --> 00:06:15.310
I ended up-- you know, you
could have walked the mile

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.200
that I ran that day.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.780
I was 22 years old.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:20.464
I wasn't grossly overweight.

00:06:20.464 --> 00:06:21.880
I was actually
pretty underweight.

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.770
And I should have been
able to handle this.

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.630
I got off.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:26.540
I hated him.

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:28.650
I was like, we're not
fitness friends anymore.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:30.804
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:30.804 --> 00:06:32.720
I went home, and it took
me a week to recover.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.845
I hobbled around like a broken
little girl for a whole week.

00:06:36.845 --> 00:06:37.886
And that was devastating.

00:06:37.886 --> 00:06:39.270
So I was like, I hate fitness.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.010
This is not for me.

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:44.780
I quit smoking, I'll eat some
grilled chicken, we're good.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.670
So I was pretty discouraged with
any kind of exercise regimen,

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.280
because my first
experience was traumatic.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.370
And I talk about this
especially for you

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:54.810
guys that are curious
about CrossFit,

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:57.331
because it's the
coach's responsibility

00:06:57.331 --> 00:06:59.330
to make sure that they
water it down and put you

00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.900
in the shallow end, that you
leave feeling successful,

00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:05.370
and that you leave
wanting to come back.

00:07:05.370 --> 00:07:08.620
Because I didn't want to go
back, and it was just a mile.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:09.380
A mile.

00:07:09.380 --> 00:07:09.970
[LAUGHS]

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:11.280
It's funny.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:14.480
So I took a hiatus from any
kind of fitness whatsoever,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.980
and then three months later, out
of pure boredom and harassment

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.420
from my friends
of being like, you

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.340
need to get in the
gym, Christmas,

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.200
you're eating too
many cheesecakes,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.350
that I ended up going
to the gym again.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.450
But I found the elliptical.

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.647
And I loved the elliptical.

00:07:30.647 --> 00:07:31.855
I was good at the elliptical.

00:07:31.855 --> 00:07:33.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:33.190 --> 00:07:34.699
It's funny because it's true.

00:07:34.699 --> 00:07:36.240
And people were
like, the elliptical?

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:37.140
Really, Christmas?

00:07:37.140 --> 00:07:39.815
It was my gateway fitness drug.

00:07:39.815 --> 00:07:41.860
I got on the elliptical,
and I was good.

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.680
So I'd pump.

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.880
And it was just something
that I could do passive.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.310
You know, just get on there.

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.208
I got on there for 20, 30
minutes, couple days out

00:07:49.208 --> 00:07:51.420
of the week, and it was it.

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.620
And I found the first
motivation of my life

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:56.850
where I would be there cruising.

00:07:56.850 --> 00:07:59.100
And then of course
I'm in this, you know,

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:02.091
military area, and these
cute Marines would walk by,

00:08:02.091 --> 00:08:04.526
and then I'd just
start pumping, right?

00:08:04.526 --> 00:08:05.500
Motivation.

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:06.474
External motivation.

00:08:06.474 --> 00:08:08.363
Cute boys make you
want to work hard.

00:08:08.363 --> 00:08:09.087
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:09.087 --> 00:08:10.295
And I'm just, like, sweating.

00:08:10.295 --> 00:08:13.206
And as soon as they turn around
and walk away, I'm like, shit.

00:08:13.206 --> 00:08:13.706
OK.

00:08:13.706 --> 00:08:15.081
Oh, thank God they
turned around,

00:08:15.081 --> 00:08:16.170
and I'd just almost stop.

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:19.474
It's like coaches perusing
the gym floor, you know?

00:08:19.474 --> 00:08:21.851
As soon as your coach
comes by, you're

00:08:21.851 --> 00:08:23.100
the best athlete in the world.

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:23.986
You're an Olympian.

00:08:23.986 --> 00:08:24.651
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:24.651 --> 00:08:26.650
They turn their back, and
you're like, I'm done.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:27.149
I'm retired.

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:28.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.900
So that was the first
time that I ever

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.530
kind of wanted to apply myself.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.110
And, yeah.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:36.179
You know, cute people
are a good motivation.

00:08:36.179 --> 00:08:39.750
But after a few weeks, I
saw a difference in my body.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:41.320
It wasn't apparent.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.789
It wasn't like, oh, my gosh.

00:08:42.789 --> 00:08:44.340
I have, like, all
these biceps now.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:45.400
It's crazy.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.920
But it was just
something different.

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:47.990
My body felt different.

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:50.310
My clothes were
fitting different.

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:51.679
I was sleeping better.

00:08:51.679 --> 00:08:53.470
And I was like, well,
this is kind of neat.

00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:54.790
I like what's happening.

00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:58.860
And then I found that my
real motivation was internal.

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.020
It was something
that I was doing

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:05.630
that was eliciting a
positive result to my body,

00:09:05.630 --> 00:09:08.940
and ultimately my mental
and emotional state as well.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.130
And that's when I
discovered that I really

00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.730
love what I'm doing, and
I want to do it more.

00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:14.554
So I was like, OK.

00:09:14.554 --> 00:09:15.470
I love the elliptical.

00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:17.220
What do we do with
these things over here?

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.760
And I had to literally
have somebody

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.090
take me around and tell
me what a dumbbell was.

00:09:22.090 --> 00:09:23.742
And tell me--
because at that point

00:09:23.742 --> 00:09:25.700
it was just all machines
and then free weights.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:30.260
It wasn't this combination
of what I do now as CrossFit.

00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:32.907
And they were like,
OK, Christmas.

00:09:32.907 --> 00:09:34.490
It's like you guys
talking to somebody

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:36.710
that doesn't understand
any kind of IT stuff.

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:38.740
You're like, you
turn the computer on,

00:09:38.740 --> 00:09:39.938
this is your mouse.

00:09:39.938 --> 00:09:41.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:44.010
Very primitive explanation.

00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:45.950
And I just got into it.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.210
A couple months of really kind
of being consistent and really

00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:52.610
loving what I see with
the changes in my body,

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:53.877
I discovered CrossFit.

00:09:53.877 --> 00:09:55.710
And my friend was like,
you need to do this.

00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:57.240
And I was like,
that-- I don't even

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.570
know what you're talking about.

00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.445
He showed me a video.

00:09:59.445 --> 00:10:02.079
It was these three girls
the same size as I am,

00:10:02.079 --> 00:10:03.370
and they were getting after it.

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:05.661
They were doing things that
I'd never seen done before.

00:10:05.661 --> 00:10:07.470
They were air squatting,
below parallel.

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:11.100
And they were doing these
cleans that I-- I was like,

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.540
they were lifting
such big weights

00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:16.071
and then doing these
gymnastic things, muscle-ups.

00:10:16.071 --> 00:10:17.570
And if you're
familiar with CrossFit

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.910
and you watch this
movie or this video,

00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:24.380
make sure you Google
CrossFit nasty girls.

00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:26.537
Make sure that that
CrossFit is in there.

00:10:26.537 --> 00:10:28.945
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:28.945 --> 00:10:30.820
Can't promise what else
you're going to find,

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:33.012
but you guys are smart
enough to figure it out.

00:10:33.012 --> 00:10:34.340
OK?

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:37.380
And I loved it, because
these girls were my size,

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:38.510
they still were feminine.

00:10:38.510 --> 00:10:40.468
Because at this time,
you were either a runner,

00:10:40.468 --> 00:10:41.915
or you were a bodybuilder.

00:10:41.915 --> 00:10:44.040
You either looked like you
needed to eat something,

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.968
or you look like you
just ate a runner.

00:10:45.968 --> 00:10:49.314
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:49.314 --> 00:10:50.748
There was no middle ground.

00:10:50.748 --> 00:10:51.704
I didn't know.

00:10:51.704 --> 00:10:53.519
And so I was like,
well, I kind of

00:10:53.519 --> 00:10:55.060
don't want to be
either one of those,

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:57.850
and then here I found that these
girls were this middle ground,

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.190
and it was beautiful.

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.562
And they were teeny,
and they were badass.

00:11:01.562 --> 00:11:03.270
And I was like, that's
what I want to do.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:04.720
Because the girl cries at
the end, and I was like,

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:06.428
I want to do a workout
that makes me cry.

00:11:06.428 --> 00:11:07.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:09.934
Be careful what you wish for.

00:11:09.934 --> 00:11:13.170
This might be a little TMI,
but every year I do a workout

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.934
that-- sometimes several
times a year-- that

00:11:15.934 --> 00:11:17.880
elicits, like, a crying.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:21.460
But not because it's terrible,
but because your body

00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.540
has reached its full
capacity physically

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:28.190
that you have no other release
other than an emotional cry.

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:31.930
And it's pretty incredible that
you can actually physically

00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:34.290
push yourself to that level.

00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:37.240
So I started doing CrossFit
on my own about a year,

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:39.870
and then I got into Baghdad
with some of these guys.

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.210
And these guys were
prior military.

00:11:42.210 --> 00:11:44.480
The company that I worked
with was prior military,

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.960
all Special Forces.

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.570
So you're talking about
Marine recon, SEALs, Rangers,

00:11:49.570 --> 00:11:52.080
I mean the alpha of the alpha.

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:52.947
And then here I am.

00:11:52.947 --> 00:11:54.030
And I walk up to this guy.

00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:56.610
I heard that there was one guy
in the camp that did CrossFit.

00:11:56.610 --> 00:11:58.430
So I was like, hey.

00:11:58.430 --> 00:12:00.360
I hear you do CrossFit.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.860
And, you know, like,
testosterone is

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.230
an amazing thing.

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:03.980
(DEEP VOICE) Yeah.

00:12:03.980 --> 00:12:05.460
I'm like, great.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.190
I do CrossFit.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:08.400
Can we CrossFit together?

00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:09.280
(DEEP VOICE) Maybe.

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:12.360
OK.

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.000
Turned around.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.460
The next day, they
watched me try and do

00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:18.580
this CrossFit workout,
Diane, which is handstand

00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:19.960
push-ups and deadlifts.

00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:22.800
My handstand push-ups were
like-- like, I was just, like,

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:23.620
raising the roof.

00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:24.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.620
And I think I was
using 85 pounds

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.436
for the deadlift
with a prescribed--

00:12:28.436 --> 00:12:31.640
or what's suggested
as 155 for women.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:33.380
And it was atrocious.

00:12:33.380 --> 00:12:35.606
I wouldn't have invited
me to work out at all.

00:12:35.606 --> 00:12:38.760
I'm like, let that
girl by herself.

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:42.880
And I ended up-- they took me
into their group, but really

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:46.460
only to see how much I could
tolerate before I quit.

00:12:46.460 --> 00:12:49.500
And little did they know
that I'm really stubborn.

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:51.940
[LAUGHS] And I kept coming back.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.880
And they're the
ones that taught me,

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.320
like I was saying
earlier before,

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:58.350
is that once you start
something, you finish it.

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:00.330
You hold yourself
accountable to your actions.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:05.030
So you apply integrity, and
you always, always just keep

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:06.300
your head high.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:09.260
There's no other option
other than to finish.

00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:14.000
And I took that into not only
my workouts, but my life's work

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:20.520
with my gym, my relationships,
and my businesses.

00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:23.340
And that's where I've really
been able to thrive and find

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:24.310
success.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.060
And success isn't because you're
instantly good at something.

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.660
I was terrible, OK?

00:13:29.660 --> 00:13:31.800
10 years in, you
eventually find your niche.

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.410
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:36.720
But it was through
failure after failure

00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.960
after failure-- and my
hashtag is relentlesslife

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.320
because I refused to quit.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.110
I refused to give up.

00:13:43.110 --> 00:13:50.710
And it's through that due
diligence that I found success.

00:13:50.710 --> 00:13:52.140
I finally got a muscle-up.

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.940
I finally was able to
deadlift over 200 pounds.

00:13:54.940 --> 00:13:56.940
I was finally able to
build my own business.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.350
I was finally able to write
my own nutrition seminar,

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:01.800
and have the confidence
to go out and teach it.

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.740
I was finally able
to write my own book

00:14:03.740 --> 00:14:05.950
and now dictate my own schedule.

00:14:05.950 --> 00:14:07.348
[LAUGHS]

00:14:07.348 --> 00:14:08.280
Right?

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:11.550
And it's because of those guys
that I have such gratitude for.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.300
So one small soap box that
I always kind of include

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.510
in whatever kind
of talk that I do

00:14:16.510 --> 00:14:19.140
is that the servicemen
of our country

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.120
don't decide where they
go and why they go there.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:26.210
They just execute
somebody else's command.

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.286
So please support your troops.

00:14:29.286 --> 00:14:30.660
And they're the
reason that we're

00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:35.090
able to sit here and
talk about it today.

00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:41.010
So I came home, and
through force, my friend

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:43.549
told me that I needed to
apply and do a competition.

00:14:43.549 --> 00:14:44.340
And I was like, no.

00:14:44.340 --> 00:14:45.040
I'm not an athlete.

00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.915
I'm not a competitor.

00:14:45.915 --> 00:14:47.020
I just like to CrossFit.

00:14:47.020 --> 00:14:47.990
He was like, no, Christmas.

00:14:47.990 --> 00:14:48.410
You're going.

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:49.180
I'm driving you there.

00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:49.888
I'm entering you.

00:14:49.888 --> 00:14:51.320
Just go have a good time.

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.560
And I was like, I hate you.

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.060
Fine.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:54.730
But I'm only going to have fun.

00:14:54.730 --> 00:14:56.540
I'm not going to apply myself.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.510
And he was like, OK, great.

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:01.090
I went, and the
first workout I'm,

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:02.522
like, waving to my friends.

00:15:02.522 --> 00:15:03.910
And they're like, Christmas, go.

00:15:03.910 --> 00:15:04.870
You're supposed
to be working out.

00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:06.703
And I'm like, I'm
supposed to be having fun.

00:15:06.703 --> 00:15:08.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:11.360
But the point of that is that
he wanted me to try something.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.980
I didn't want to do it.

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.070
I had already this
preconceived notion

00:15:15.070 --> 00:15:16.767
of what I was going
to experience.

00:15:16.767 --> 00:15:18.350
I knew that I wasn't
going to like it.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:20.030
I knew I wasn't a competitor.

00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:21.350
But he was like, just do it.

00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:22.240
And I did it.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:25.020
And then this magical
thing happened.

00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.830
This little monster
inside of me woke up,

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.580
and it wanted to eat souls.

00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:32.390
It wanted to win.

00:15:32.390 --> 00:15:32.890
You know?

00:15:32.890 --> 00:15:36.380
And it wasn't against one
person, but it was for myself.

00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:39.810
I wanted to show myself what I
was truly capable of in hitting

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:41.310
my true potential.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.307
And that's magical.

00:15:43.307 --> 00:15:45.140
And that can be applied
not just to fitness,

00:15:45.140 --> 00:15:48.520
but to your own life's work.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.390
And since then-- I still
call it my little monster.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:53.980
But something happens on
that competition floor

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:58.770
or when I'm approached with any
kind of competition situation,

00:15:58.770 --> 00:16:02.380
or like where I need to
excel and do my best.

00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.060
That little monster
wakes up, and there

00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:08.730
is nothing else that is
between me and that goal

00:16:08.730 --> 00:16:10.480
other than myself.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.570
You know, like, how
bad do I want this?

00:16:12.570 --> 00:16:14.387
And it's a beautiful,
beautiful thing.

00:16:14.387 --> 00:16:15.970
And I thank him all
the time for that.

00:16:15.970 --> 00:16:19.699
He's actually my business
partner with Invoke now.

00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:21.490
Same thing happened
when I got into NASCAR.

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:21.990
I was duped.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.073
They called me and they
were like, hey, Christmas.

00:16:24.073 --> 00:16:25.480
You want to come play NASCAR?

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:27.215
They said play NASCAR.

00:16:27.215 --> 00:16:28.090
And I was like, yeah.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.518
I'm going to drive
some fast cars.

00:16:29.518 --> 00:16:30.514
You know?

00:16:30.514 --> 00:16:31.510
Assumed.

00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.640
[LAUGHS] I got there,
and they were like,

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.390
we're going to do this
pit crew challenge,

00:16:35.390 --> 00:16:36.806
and you're going
to change a tire.

00:16:36.806 --> 00:16:38.080
And I was like, mm-mm.

00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.560
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:40.440
No.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:43.520
I knew-- I had that
preconceived conviction

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.720
of what was going to happen.

00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.340
I knew that I wasn't
going to like it,

00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:47.822
even though I never
experienced it.

00:16:47.822 --> 00:16:48.780
And they were like, OK.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.675
And I was there.

00:16:49.675 --> 00:16:52.050
I had already driven all the
way over there, three hours.

00:16:52.050 --> 00:16:53.716
And I'm like, well,
I can't just bounce.

00:16:53.716 --> 00:16:56.592
And I was like, I'll go in and
then find a reason to leave.

00:16:56.592 --> 00:16:58.300
And as soon as I heard
what was going on,

00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:02.786
I saw this crazy orchestra
of people and chaos,

00:17:02.786 --> 00:17:04.911
and I was like, (WHISPERING)
I want to be in there.

00:17:04.911 --> 00:17:05.849
Can I go play?

00:17:05.849 --> 00:17:07.099
They're like, that's what
you're going to be doing today,

00:17:07.099 --> 00:17:07.460
Christmas.

00:17:07.460 --> 00:17:08.540
And I was like, well,
why didn't you tell me

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:09.623
we were going to have fun?

00:17:09.623 --> 00:17:10.599
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:10.599 --> 00:17:14.020
And I did it, and I loved it.

00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:15.420
Beat the boys.

00:17:15.420 --> 00:17:17.920
And the hand speed of
a NASCAR Sprint Cup--

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:20.000
so that's the highest
level you can go.

00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:21.680
That's what you
actually see on TV.

00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:26.220
And a standard hand speed is
1.2 seconds for five lug nuts.

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.650
That's pretty-- and you have
to have, like, accuracy.

00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:30.983
It's all-- I could geek out
about that for another three

00:17:30.983 --> 00:17:33.150
hours.

00:17:33.150 --> 00:17:34.140
It's intense.

00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:37.020
And my hand speed that
day was 1.7 seconds.

00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:38.650
So I was only half
a second from being

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:42.338
at the highest level first day
I tried it, fourth attempt.

00:17:42.338 --> 00:17:43.546
I got a call two weeks later.

00:17:43.546 --> 00:17:44.720
They were like, hey, you
want to come play NASCAR?

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.280
And I was like, do I
get to change tires?

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.113
They were like, yes.

00:17:47.113 --> 00:17:48.270
I was like, I'm there.

00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:49.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:49.050 --> 00:17:51.680
So I made-- I
jumped through hoops

00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:55.080
to make it work to where I
could pursue this interest.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:58.899
And I had no intention on
what it was really happening.

00:17:58.899 --> 00:18:01.190
I thought I was just going
to go play NASCAR for a year

00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:04.300
and kind of experience
it and then go back home.

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:06.370
But the reason I
didn't say no is

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:10.880
because, one, I just-- I had
such an obsession with it

00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:12.810
the same way I had an
obsession with CrossFit,

00:18:12.810 --> 00:18:14.674
and it had been so good to me.

00:18:14.674 --> 00:18:15.840
And I just wanted to try it.

00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.620
So I started to not
say no and say yes,

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.636
even though my life
didn't exactly permit it.

00:18:21.636 --> 00:18:23.760
It wasn't saying, hey, you
have nothing else to do.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.700
Go play NASCAR.

00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:27.920
I forged it into my life.

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.280
And you know, had a lot of
great benefits from that.

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.290
The point of this
is that there is

00:18:35.290 --> 00:18:38.140
going to be a lot of things
that come up in your life

00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.320
that you are certain,
without a doubt, conviction,

00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:45.500
that you do not
like, or you know

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:47.120
that you're not
going to appreciate,

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.280
or you know you're
not going to enjoy.

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:52.650
And I ask you to
challenge yourself

00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:59.880
to reserve that thought or that
experience until you try it.

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.620
You don't know until you try it.

00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:05.320
And I know that we always
hear that, but the few things

00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:10.030
that I was certain in my
life that I did not like--

00:19:10.030 --> 00:19:12.393
and I'd even tried one
and I didn't like it.

00:19:12.393 --> 00:19:14.880
Running-- fitness
was not for me.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.350
But those are the
few things that

00:19:16.350 --> 00:19:19.200
actually changed the
entire course of my life

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.610
and made me a better
person, and cultivated

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.840
this positive lifestyle
that I live today.

00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:28.480
So before you knock
it, you better

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:31.070
try it, because you don't
know if that is going

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.040
to be a fork in your road.

00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:36.860
Or at least then, you can
have an educated decision

00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:40.720
or an educated
experience on that topic.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.610
And you can say with
conviction and experience

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.890
that you don't like it.

00:19:46.890 --> 00:19:48.900
Peanut butter on eggs.

00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.890
It's delicious.

00:19:50.890 --> 00:19:52.390
Don't scrunch your
nose at me, baby.

00:19:52.390 --> 00:19:53.431
You haven't tried it yet.

00:19:53.431 --> 00:19:55.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.829
Anyway, so I say this talking
about food because people--

00:19:59.829 --> 00:20:02.370
you know, they look at the diet
regimen and they're like, no.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.495
I'm not going to like that.

00:20:03.495 --> 00:20:04.550
That isn't going to work.

00:20:04.550 --> 00:20:06.400
Well, have you tried it?

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.410
Did you apply yourself?

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:11.470
Did you give it a certain
amount of time period

00:20:11.470 --> 00:20:15.020
to educate yourself and
have that experience?

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.360
Probably not.

00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:19.640
So before you say no and
close the door on something

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:24.310
that could be absolutely
amazing, then at least go in,

00:20:24.310 --> 00:20:26.640
and you haven't
really lost much.

00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.180
It won't derail your life to
give something a little try.

00:20:30.180 --> 00:20:34.410
Unless you're going to go,
like, base jumping or something.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:36.590
That might be a little
bit more adventurous

00:20:36.590 --> 00:20:38.880
than a diet regimen.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.030
So I just ask and
beg of that of you.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:44.420
And that's really-- I like
to dive into my background.

00:20:44.420 --> 00:20:46.560
The reason the book
was created was

00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.530
because I just got-- I
kept getting questions

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.030
on my diet regimen.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:53.380
And I have experimented
with myself

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:56.070
on diet regimens
for years and years.

00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.140
And that's how this
was created, was

00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:01.990
it was cherry-picked from other
diet regimens that I tried.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:05.940
And I took what I liked,
left what I didn't, and I've

00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:09.550
been practicing this
for 10 years as well.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:11.910
Eventually, I got tired of
answering emails, created

00:21:11.910 --> 00:21:15.272
the nutrition seminar, and from
there, the book was spawned.

00:21:15.272 --> 00:21:18.380
So there you have the book.

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:19.925
Thank you so much for listening.

00:21:19.925 --> 00:21:22.913
You guys were-- you
laughed at my jokes.

00:21:22.913 --> 00:21:23.820
So I appreciate that.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.590
Sometimes people don't and
I'm just kind of up here,

00:21:26.590 --> 00:21:27.630
entertaining myself.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:29.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.850
I know that we didn't
talk much about the food,

00:21:31.850 --> 00:21:35.840
but if you do nothing
else, just take

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:40.120
the foundation of balancing
your protein, carbohydrates,

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:40.770
and fats.

00:21:40.770 --> 00:21:42.383
Educate yourself
on what they are.

00:21:42.383 --> 00:21:44.460
It's in the book.

00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:49.290
And then emphasizing that on
the quality scale of the premium

00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.630
foods versus acceptable foods
versus really bad foods.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:55.010
And if you do nothing else
but to kind of balance

00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:58.270
those three-- every meal,
every snack, that triplet,

00:21:58.270 --> 00:22:01.639
that trifecta with a
balance of the food scale,

00:22:01.639 --> 00:22:04.180
then you're going to be leaps
and bounds better than somebody

00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:04.800
else.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.310
That was me getting
on the elliptical.

00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:10.600
If you want to get into
the food CrossFit concept,

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.350
then weigh and
measure and dial it

00:22:12.350 --> 00:22:14.680
in for approximately
three weeks.

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:16.430
You don't have to
do it all the time.

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:19.280
I barely ever weigh and
measure my food now anymore,

00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:21.530
because I've been
applying this for so long

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:23.380
that it's second
nature to me now.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:24.890
It will get easier.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:26.500
I promise.

00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:27.928
Thank you.

00:22:27.928 --> 00:22:32.374
[APPLAUSE]

00:22:34.219 --> 00:22:34.844
First question?

00:22:34.844 --> 00:22:35.772
Let's go.

00:22:35.772 --> 00:22:37.480
AUDIENCE: So it sounds
like you advocated

00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.430
balancing your macros per meal.

00:22:39.430 --> 00:22:42.456
I usually hear of people
balancing it like per day.

00:22:42.456 --> 00:22:44.870
You know, like IIFYM, et cetera.

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:46.500
Anything you can
say about trying

00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:47.777
it one way versus the other?

00:22:47.777 --> 00:22:48.735
CHRISTMAS ABBOTT: Pfft.

00:22:48.735 --> 00:22:50.580
It's like I set this up for you.

00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.210
I love it.

00:22:52.210 --> 00:22:54.350
So balancing your
macros per meal

00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:57.102
is going to a elicit a
positive hormonal response

00:22:57.102 --> 00:22:58.810
and keep you balanced
throughout the day.

00:22:58.810 --> 00:23:01.900
Versus if you balance your
macros throughout the day,

00:23:01.900 --> 00:23:04.530
you can still have a carb
overload and an insulin

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:07.960
response to foods, so
your hormonal response

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.970
is going up and down.

00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.200
Versus if you couple
it for every meal,

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:17.280
it's going to keep that hormonal
response in the same layer.

00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.510
Does that make sense?

00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:23.440
So I love the concept of
balanced macros per day,

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:25.850
but I like to break
it down even further.

00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:27.780
Because you can still
have some major health

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:32.244
issues if you're spiking your
insulin on a daily basis.

00:23:32.244 --> 00:23:34.660
AUDIENCE: So it sounds like
that applied more to the carbs

00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:36.729
than to the protein versus fat.

00:23:36.729 --> 00:23:38.270
CHRISTMAS ABBOTT:
You know, the carbs

00:23:38.270 --> 00:23:42.860
are really the dominant
hormonal response that kind of

00:23:42.860 --> 00:23:44.270
is what people struggle with.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:46.370
It's what we want most, right?

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.160
I mean, a recovering
heroin addict

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:51.030
doesn't walk around
with grilled chicken.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:53.840
It walks around with
sugar and sweets.

00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:57.160
It makes us feel good,
which is why we love it.

00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:59.330
So isolating that,
then it's going

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:02.960
to be much more disruptive than
your proteins and your fats.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.460
However, they work
best together.

00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:08.530
It's like this trifecta, this
team of three or triplets

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.850
that you really don't
want to separate.

00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:15.333
They work in a good synergy
together versus separated.

00:24:15.333 --> 00:24:16.280
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.546
CHRISTMAS ABBOTT: Thank you.

00:24:17.546 --> 00:24:19.420
That's like the first
time that nobody's ever

00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:21.810
hesitated on asking a question,
especially in the front row.

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:22.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.960
Only at Google.

00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:26.160
I love it. [LAUGHS]

00:24:26.826 --> 00:24:28.450
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I
was just curious on--

00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:30.450
so whenever you first
started working out,

00:24:30.450 --> 00:24:32.270
it sounded like the
way your body looked

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.330
and your fitness kind of went
hand in hand on the same road.

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:38.560
But I'm kind of
curious on the way you

00:24:38.560 --> 00:24:40.820
see CrossFit women going a lot.

00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.570
They're getting, like, bigger
and stronger-- which is fine.

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:44.690
But my--

00:24:44.690 --> 00:24:46.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:46.580 --> 00:24:47.476
You're not big.

00:24:47.476 --> 00:24:49.268
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:49.268 --> 00:24:52.795
But what would you say
whenever those roads start

00:24:52.795 --> 00:24:55.960
to diverge where, say, a woman
wants to look a certain way,

00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.327
but if she wants to
get better at CrossFit,

00:24:58.327 --> 00:25:00.410
and you can't do both,
what would you say to that?

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:01.826
CHRISTMAS ABBOTT:
You know, that's

00:25:01.826 --> 00:25:05.470
such a-- people get so
wrapped up into this.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.517
My body has changed tremendously
over the last 10 years,

00:25:08.517 --> 00:25:09.600
but I'm still very petite.

00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.740
I actually still wear
the same size of clothes

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.500
that I did when I
started CrossFit.

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.740
So my clothes didn't change.

00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:19.140
Just my bubbly body did change.

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:23.120
And often we see the CrossFit
Games, which just happened.

00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:25.870
We see the female competitors
of the CrossFit Games,

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:27.380
and they are the exception.

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:30.650
They are the 1% of
CrossFitters that

00:25:30.650 --> 00:25:32.170
are going to go to the games.

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:34.860
They made their training
and their food regimen

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:37.820
in order to be able to
perform at a certain level.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.570
It is the same thing
for any other sport.

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:41.700
It's a specialty.

00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:45.350
They are at the top
of the pyramid there.

00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:48.342
Where women generally
look at, they're like, oh,

00:25:48.342 --> 00:25:50.800
I don't want to CrossFit because
I don't want to get bulky.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:53.680
And they see the
CrossFit Games athletes,

00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:58.830
who are beautiful bodied because
their body-- they're demanding

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:02.220
work of their body, and that's
the response that they're

00:26:02.220 --> 00:26:05.320
eliciting is the
aesthetics, right?

00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.240
So I think what
you're asking is women

00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.480
that want to have a little
bit of a leaner frame,

00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:13.770
but they want to be badass
in Crossfit-- right? [LAUGHS]

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.970
Yeah.

00:26:15.970 --> 00:26:21.780
You're going to-- over time,
that psychological aspect is

00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.600
going to change for a female.

00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:27.760
They're going to get stronger,
but not get super bulky.

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:29.500
So as soon as they
start to realize

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:32.510
that they can keep their
aesthetics pretty close to what

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:34.960
they started with,
with a little bit more,

00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:39.430
like, abs and nice
butt, you know,

00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:44.350
like, it's just a good
response, that they are just

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:49.420
going to keep this nice,
slim, but muscular look

00:26:49.420 --> 00:26:52.530
without looking like
a Games competitor.

00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:56.420
I am the strongest that
I've ever been in my life,

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.880
but I still keep
a very sleek body.

00:26:58.880 --> 00:27:02.050
And it's not changing
my workout regimen.

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:03.850
You can change your
workout regimen

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:08.410
to appeal to the aesthetics
that you're looking for.

00:27:08.410 --> 00:27:10.590
But I just tell
people to keep lifting

00:27:10.590 --> 00:27:13.930
and to keep doing the
workouts, and allow your body

00:27:13.930 --> 00:27:16.000
to work for you.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.950
It's amazing what we
can push our bodies to.

00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:23.680
And the byproduct is a
gorgeous, muscular body.

00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:26.225
They won't get to that level
unless it's intentional.

00:27:26.225 --> 00:27:27.600
Same thing as like
a bodybuilder.

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:30.440
You can go in and do
curls, bicep extensions.

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.950
You're not going to look
like Arnold Schwarzenegger

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:36.780
unless you start pumping
things into your body that

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.790
are-- shouldn't be
pumping into, right?

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:40.502
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.160
And I'm not saying that CrossFit
athletes at the highest level

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.470
do that rampantly, but they
change their entire lifestyle

00:27:48.470 --> 00:27:52.109
to get that-- not look,
but that performance.

00:27:52.109 --> 00:27:54.650
So really, I just tell them to
keep doing what they're doing,

00:27:54.650 --> 00:27:55.750
and they'll be OK.

00:27:55.750 --> 00:27:57.432
They'll survive.

00:27:57.432 --> 00:27:59.640
And if they start getting
to a point where they think

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.410
that they're a
little bit larger,

00:28:01.410 --> 00:28:03.580
then you can change
the programming

00:28:03.580 --> 00:28:07.610
to complement the
aesthetic that they want.

00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:09.746
It's really in their control.

00:28:09.746 --> 00:28:10.890
Yeah?

00:28:10.890 --> 00:28:13.815
AUDIENCE: So what is your
current training regimen like?

00:28:13.815 --> 00:28:16.690
CHRISTMAS ABBOTT: Well, carrying
my suitcase through the airport

00:28:16.690 --> 00:28:17.294
right now.

00:28:17.294 --> 00:28:18.222
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:18.222 --> 00:28:20.740
But it depends on
the time of the year.

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.990
Right now I'm preparing
for nationals,

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.700
which is a weightlifting
competition in August.

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:28.360
And so I'm doing a
lot of weight lifting,

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:32.180
a lot of explosive
power movements,

00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.250
and just trying to get
my lifting numbers up.

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:39.660
And when I go home, I'll
train six days a week

00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:43.850
and do two to three
workouts each of those days.

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:47.194
During my off season,
I only attend class.

00:28:47.194 --> 00:28:49.620
One day-- you know,
like, once a day, I just

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:51.270
do the class workout.

00:28:51.270 --> 00:28:54.880
So I personally, I ebb
and flow the workload

00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.380
because I want to be able
to be in my 80s or 90s

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.940
and chasing my grandchildren.

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.750
The shelf life of a competitive
athlete is very, very short.

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.420
And you're seeing this kind
of-- even happening this year,

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.430
you know, Annie
Thorisdottir was injured,

00:29:10.430 --> 00:29:12.000
and she had to bow out.

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.130
Look how long she
reigned supreme

00:29:14.130 --> 00:29:17.370
before you start seeing injuries
at that high of a level.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:21.635
And I prefer to have a longevity
in my athletic career versus be

00:29:21.635 --> 00:29:22.820
the top for three years.

00:29:22.820 --> 00:29:24.300
So it ebbs and flows.

00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.925
AUDIENCE: So in that
two to three days,

00:29:25.925 --> 00:29:28.383
are you doing, like, strength
training in the morning, then

00:29:28.383 --> 00:29:30.956
your CrossFit-style workouts,
like, your intensity

00:29:30.956 --> 00:29:31.982
intervals at night?

00:29:31.982 --> 00:29:33.440
CHRISTMAS ABBOTT:
You know, I don't

00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.434
like to go to the
gym twice in a day.

00:29:36.434 --> 00:29:39.100
And so what I
normally will do is

00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:42.590
in an hour-- now it's taking
about two hours or so-- I'll go

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:46.330
and I'll do a weight
lifting component, just

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:47.880
some kind of a complex.

00:29:47.880 --> 00:29:50.320
And then I do a
strength component.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.630
And after that,
I'll do auxiliary.

00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:56.100
So it's kind of like a
sled push and GHD sit-ups,

00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.020
something to really
get me gassed.

00:29:58.020 --> 00:30:01.460
And then at the end, I'll do
some mobility, stabilizing.

00:30:01.460 --> 00:30:03.740
And that's pretty
standard or skill work.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:07.170
That's pretty standard
for at least twice a week.

00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.090
That volume is very
difficult for me,

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:11.660
because I just don't
need the volume anymore.

00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:12.500
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.690
CHRISTMAS ABBOTT: Thank you.

00:30:13.690 --> 00:30:15.050
I like the technical questions.

00:30:15.050 --> 00:30:16.309
[LAUGHS]

00:30:16.309 --> 00:30:18.350
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you
so much for being here.

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.950
CHRISTMAS ABBOTT: Thank you.

00:30:18.950 --> 00:30:20.700
FEMALE SPEAKER: There's
books in the back.

00:30:20.700 --> 00:30:22.600
[APPLAUSE]
