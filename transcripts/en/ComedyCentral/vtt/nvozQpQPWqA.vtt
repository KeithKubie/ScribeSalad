my notebook on me,

00:01:45.038 --> 00:01:46.706
just so anytime I have an idea,

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:48.575
I can write it down, you know?

00:01:48.575 --> 00:01:50.743
- I have my notes right
here, I'm in a bathtub

00:01:50.743 --> 00:01:52.378 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I have my notes,

have like writing sessions,

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.717 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'll go over ideas
that I've written down

in the moment of
inspiration then edit later.

00:02:01.121 --> 00:02:02.622

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:05.391
Write it down, take that
joint, take that bong hit

00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:08.261

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:27.547

00:02:27.547 --> 00:02:29.949

00:03:01.114 --> 00:03:02.382
Brody's gotta eat!

00:03:02.382 --> 00:03:03.750
We can do it together.
