00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Y will always be less extreme.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The key to understanding this simply is this equation.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000
This is what tells us that the standard scores have a regression coefficient â‰¤ 1.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We said it's 1, and so because it's not 1 it must be less than that.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
That means the standard score shrinks.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If the standard score shrinks that means if it's negative it moves this way.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
If it's positive it moves this way.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That means there is more area under here,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
so this has to be a little more area than this.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Therefore, y will always be less extreme.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
This is the concept of regression.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
That is regression to the mean.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
If someone is exceptional in one thing,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
we will always predict that person to be a bit less exceptional

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
in that other thing if there is any error.
