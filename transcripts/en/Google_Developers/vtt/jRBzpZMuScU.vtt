00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:06.090
Millions of websites and apps
are using the Google Maps API

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.300
today, whether helping
users book a hotel

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.670
or find a great restaurant.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.910
However, these maps have
always been isolated.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:14.430
Favorite places saved
on one map won't show up

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.079
anywhere else on the web.

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:17.900
With the Google
Maps API signed-in

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.640
experience and attributed
save, your users

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.210
have the option to sign into the
map with their Google account.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.740
Their saved places, such as
their home or work address,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.342
will appear automatically
when they look at your map.

00:00:29.342 --> 00:00:30.800
Additionally, with
attributed save,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.440
you can allow users to
star places from your app

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.972
and display them on other
Google maps throughout the web.

00:00:36.972 --> 00:00:38.930
When a user clicks on
one of your saved places,

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.180
they'll see a link
back to your site.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.177
It's easy to get started with
just a single line of code.

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:46.260
See the tutorial on our
blog to get started today.
