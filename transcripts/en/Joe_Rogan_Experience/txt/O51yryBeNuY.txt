Speaker 1:          00:00:00       Three two, one. Boom. Hello Abby. Hello Joe. What's going on? Nothing much. I saw you chilling with Oliver Stone the other day. Yeah. What does that like? It's pretty cool. He's an interesting guy. Very interesting guy. Yeah. He likes to support radical politics. So he came out for this screening of the new film that we did. Yeah. He's a very unusual character in that regard. Right. Cause he's like this blockbuster movie maker Guy, but he's also pretty radical guy in the way in his politics and when he supports and yeah, he was kind of like the black sheep of Hollywood for awhile, you know, doing all the radical, kind of the radical outlier of Hollywood basically. Yeah. But the do you saw the JFK movie, right? Yeah, of course. That was a weird one, right? It's like, I kind of like it, but I've kind of like, hey man, that fucking general wasn't even a real person.

Speaker 1:          00:00:48       Like you. You made up a real person. Like you put them in there. I think I didn't exist like a lot of really? Yeah. Very good. Very, very good. But I get it. He kind of needed to move it along for a 90 minute or two hour movie or whatever it was. I get it. You kind of needed like this little character to like be dishing out the inside scoop that Donald Sutherland character, but in real life there was no guy. I didn't know that. Yeah. God Damn it all her. If you knew, would you tricked again? Would you be like, hey mother fucker, what'd you do? Why'd you add that guy? Because it's weird because like people talk about that. They said, hey, you know when the Oliver Stone movie, they detailed all these things that happen. Like, yeah, yeah. But they also added a guy.

Speaker 1:          00:01:30       It wasn't a real guy. Right? Like as at the end of the day, it's a fictional, you know, is it, if it's a real president who was shot by someone and you trying to explain who in your, your movie, and you have all these real characters, but then you've got this one guy who just kind of shoved in there. Yeah. To fill the, the professor, what was, what did he call himself in the movie again? The [inaudible] character? I do not remember. I haven't seen in years. I don't know cause I, if I remember correctly, it was him kind of just filling in the gaps and kind of tying the narrative together as, yeah, they used him as a tool to kind of move the movie. Come on isn't another way to do that. And the makeup a dude. Brilliant asked movie though, right? Very good movie. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:02:16       What do you think happened? The Oliver Stone and even have right off the bat, let's look talk about five k a I don't know. I mean I think you had, yes. If I give you a hundred bucks you said. All right, Abby Quinn put bet on red or bet on black. Did you think Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone or do you think that there was some sort of conspiracy involving various nefarious groups? I think Oliver Stone's movie is closer to the truth than obviously what the official narrative is. I think that if you look at all those high pro profile assassinations and that era, I think a lot of them are highly questionable. I mean, yeah, it doesn't just stop at JFK were talking about RFK. I show her leave that story at all. Um, Martin Luther King, you know, I mean all of your, sure.

Speaker 2:          00:03:01       There is really, really sketchy things about all of them. And if we were conducting, the CIO is conducting basically an assassination program around the world to expedite us foreign policy and imperialism. Why would we not have been doing that here at home? [inaudible] you know, I mean, we know that Fred Hampton was killed outright at the, the leader of the Black Panther party. So all of these things are kind of make more sense when you look back at history and see how kind of out of control the CIA was at that time.

Speaker 3:          00:03:27       Yeah. I mean, it only makes sense that they would want to get rid of certain characters that were causing trouble. Right. You know, I had Mike Baker on, uh, from who used to work. He was a CIA operative and he looked into the JFK, or excuse me, the, um, Martin Luther King assassination. And he said that one more than any other one that he looked into seemed like something was really, cause James Earl Ray was like a loser or to like the shift he guy. And then before the assassination, all of a sudden you had money. All of a sudden he like, he was, he was, it looked like he was being steered. And uh, he went into great detail about it. I don't remember all the details, but he was shaking his head about, he's like that one out of any of them. One that I looked into had the fingerprints of manipulation on it.

Speaker 2:          00:04:08       Well, you know about his family, obviously Martin Luther King, his family that had that civil trial and basically concluded that the u s government had to have been involved for the circumstances to have happened the way they did. And if you look at how Martin Luther King at the time was considered the most dangerous, quote unquote and Negro in the country. That's what the government was saying about him. I mean, he was hated. He was loaded. He was trying to basically end the meant like a poor people's campaign to occupy DC to get poor people economic rights. That was a, that was really, really threatening I think, to the establishment. And

Speaker 3:          00:04:39       at that time also, you know, it's hard for us when we're thinking back about that era. I mean, we weren't really, I mean, I was, I was born in 67. You warn laughed at that. It wasn't, we don't understand that era. That's a hundred years after slavery. Just a hundred a person's life. Person's lifetime. Yeah. Kind of crazy. Right. You know, and things still hadn't been resolved. And then when you look at it now, I mean, Juneteenth, they had the, uh, congressional hearings, they're talking about reparations and you see just the, the different polarized sides of how people look at it. Even today, whether or not reparations should be given or whether or not there should be any, any sort of effort to rectify the obvious. If you look at the, the, the economic strife that's in these southern cities that are primarily African American, that are really from slavery. I mean, this is literally the remnants of slavery and it's never been fixed. It's almost like any other problem that would be in our infrastructure or any other problem that would be in, you know, anything with, you know, Po, po pollution or any, anything else that people clearly did where someone did and fucked it up. There's efforts made to fix it and there's discussions it, but this is so much

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       resistance. Right? Tena has the coats, I think his name is, he was testifying there. Um, and he was saying that, you know, the argument is we had nothing to do with this because again, it was more than a person ago. Why should we have anything to do with what slavery did? And it's beyond that though, as you're mentioning. I mean, this was an institutionalized racism that we still see the effects of very shortly within the prison community within, I mean, all these things. And he said we were still paying out civil war soldiers, families, pensions, decades after that. So like why, why do that? But not actually try to, you know, provide some economic justice to the black community. It's a weird

Speaker 3:          00:06:39       conversation because it's not just a conversation about whether or not something wrong was done, but it's also a racial conversation. Like I've seen some weird posts like you know, chuck Woolery, the guy who was from the love connection, we'll be right back in to, and to remember that guy, that guy is turned into this like serious hardcore right wing pundit. And I think it was him that was tweeting about reparations for union soldiers, for their families that died. So he was saying writing in the civil war. It was like, how about these people? And then like not saying, how about the fucking people who's like brought over here from Africa and chains and their great grandchildren are alive today in the same community.

Speaker 2:          00:07:25       Well, as the basis of our capitalist society. I mean that's why we're the richest country in the world. And because it was predicated on the, and you know the enslavement of Africa, Africans,

Speaker 3:          00:07:34       yeah. I don't know if you can fix it by giving people money today, but I do think the money should be spent to try to fix those communities and I think that can be engineered and done. And I don't hear anybody talking about other than Tulsi gabber talks about it and I think Bernie Sanders in mate has made some indications that something should be done. Although I don't know if anybody has like a real definitive plan, but when you talk to people that have like, um, Michael Wood who was a Baltimore police officer, I've told this story before, but it's a crazy story. He, when he was a cop in Baltimore, they found these papers that showed that the exact, it was papers from the 1970s the exact same crimes in the exact same areas and the exact same problem areas they were dealing with in the 70s there were dealing with in the two thousands and he was like, what the fuck?

Speaker 3:          00:08:27       Like wow. Imagine that feeling like, here you are, you're police officer, right? You're putting your life on the line literally, and you're out there dealing with the same problems that existed in the same exact areas and no one's ever done anything to fix it all. They don't ever get to the rest of arresting people. Yeah. Yeah. Don't get to the root. I mean Tulsa and Bernie are they only candidates worth giving a shit about? What about put a g,G , G, G, G, g. G. I think that dude, that fucking town hall suck. That is

Speaker 1:          00:08:56       how many candidates are there now? I feel like two, two other ones just jumped in the race. Now we have like, I don't fucking know their names. You know anyone other beyond [inaudible] on the way out though. He's too close to Beta. It's too close. He does. He does look like he would be called that, but his dad actually just openly said in an interview. He's like, yeah, I called them Baito cause I wanted him to get the Mexican vote cause I knew who would eventually run for office. Why is real names like Robert Robert own horses crust? That sounds like a stroll. People. I mean, these people are like a hundred shades of Hillary. I mean every single one of them other than Tulsi and Bernie just seem like they're, uh, just like Hillary Clinton light. We'll, they've also done this weird thing where they're like, no straight white men.

Speaker 1:          00:09:46       I'm like, okay, like there's like straight white men. We're not voting for straight white men. That's just as bad as saying you're never voting for a woman. It's just as bad as saying you're never voting for a black person age. You'd need, I mean, I get it. There's been a lot of straight white men. They've been present. I get it. Right. You're right. But to say no straight went to disqualify someone based on something they have no control over whatsoever is a form of discrimination. I know you don't think it's a form of discrimination because so many of these people have already had that job. I get it. It seems unfair. You're right. But you can't say that because that's a shitty way of thinking. It's, it's piss poor logic and thinking. It's discriminatory. It's identity. Politics. Yes. It reigned supreme and, and I saw there was like a combating supporters from Kamala Harris and Bernie at some rally or something.

Speaker 1:          00:10:35       And then they just kept shouting, we need a woman president. It's like, that's, that's like the only reason why you like Kamala Harris, you know, I mean, Kamala Harris, um, I saw this one speech that she was giving what she was talking about, forcing children to attend school by holding their parents accountable where she instituted a policy where if the kids miss school, the parents could be arrested. Do you know about that now? It was super disturbing. It was super disturbing. And she was talking about how, how effective it was and that, you know, they had cops show up at the door of the woman's house who was a single mom who had these children. The kids weren't going to school like, Hey, no, she was a cop. I mean, she's a top cop. Exactly. But that authoritative, yeah. Authoritarian nonsense. Like that way of thinking. You know why you do that?

Speaker 1:          00:11:28       Because no one's ever done that to you. Right. So I'm never knocked on your fucking door and said, hey, we're going to lock you up in jail because your 16 year old boy when you have three kids, right? And if you're a single mom, anyone who's a single mom who has a boy knows and that fucking boy hits puberty. If they run with the wrong crowd, good fucking luck trying to control them. Good luck. It's hard. It's real hard. And if she's got a job or two jobs, maybe because she's trying to put food on the table and keep the fucking lights on and you're going to arrest her because their kid doesn't show up at school. Holy Shit. Can you imagine looking at all the problems in our country and being like, you know what? We need to arrest parents if their kids are truant.

Speaker 1:          00:12:01       Yeah, it's, it's insane. I mean, make sure [inaudible] I'm 99% sure I'm correct about that. They're talking about her like regret about this policy and [inaudible] running for fucking president. You should regret something like money or another in the same pool policy going back to a row, Robert or Robert is the human cost of C'mon on truancy. The progressive prosecutor wanted to transform how California responding to students. Busy school parents like uh, I don't know how to say her name. Sheree. Sheree people's wound up paying the price. So she, this lady, I read that, I remember reading this one. I'm going to fucking child. Yeah, so I'm, I'm correct. There was a good reason her kid was sick or something and she so Beto no, let's not call them Beto anymore. His name is Robert. Robert. Yeah. Robert actually has a really great idea. Joe. He wants to tax non military families to pay for veterans' healthcare.

Speaker 1:          00:12:55       Pay For veterans. Yeah. Isn't that nice? So punish the people who don't want to join the military. What very smart. Robert [inaudible], the fucking people who make the weapons influence the politicians hacks the defense contract. Find out what the military industrial complex is really made of. Find out how much money they're really making and saying, Hey, look at you guys. You made x amount of billions of dollars and look at all these guys that, you know, we have, we have to fund, we have to rely on charities and we have to rely on things like the wounded warrior project and all these foundations that are taking care of these veterans when you're the ones who are profiting and, yeah, I mean that, that's where the money should come from. Yeah. Sound like they're poor. And since these are fucking insanely rich organizations, yeah. They're stocks of like tripled in the last four years there.

Speaker 1:          00:13:41       They're doing real well. When we had that situation where Dick Cheney, who was the CEO of how Burton was giving Halliburton, no bid contracts to go over and fix places that we bombed. It's like what? Yeah, that, that is like a doctor breaking people's legs so he can fix them so it's so crazy and then drive it around in a Porsche. It's fucking crazy. Yeah. Well, Trump was sitting down at some table with all the head defense contractors a couple months ago and it was after the [inaudible], you know, dismemberment and the embassy. And, uh, he was openly talking about how we can not stop that $110 billion weapons deal and you should see that just the glee on these people's faces. I mean, it was just, it's just unbelievable how transparent it is, especially under Trump. That was a weird conversation. Where, who was he being interviewed by? Oh, Steve. Steve Hilton, my friend. I know Steve Hilton. Oh my God. Forever. Um, we're actually family friends. Our families have gone on vacations together and Shit. It's a good guy. Is that the Fox Hilton error or is that just uh, no, no. Uh, it's uh, one of the fuck is named Paris group Dad. Oh no, he's British. But um, he was, um,

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       Trump and they were talking about the mill in Trump was openly discussing how these people want to go to war. The military industrial complex wants to go to war. I mean, Trump saying that he didn't want to have anything to deal with this, but that they want to go to war and it's like, I get it. Trump has a weird guy because he's such a loose cannon that he says shit like that, that you don't, that Obama would keep it his cards, you know, Obama would hide his cards, but Trump hate him or love him. He, he gives you glimpses that you're not gonna get as far as like what kind of influence does the military industrial complex really have on policy change and decision making and whether or not they take action and he was openly discussing it.

Speaker 2:          00:15:35       He removes the mask. You know, it's, it's interesting because he, I think that he's talking out of both sides of his mouth because on one hand he says that kind of stuff. But then on the other hand, I mean, he hired all the most rabid war generals in his cabinet and also just John Bolton. I mean, come on, this is like a maniacal neoconservative who been for war with Iran since the day he was born. So it's like, if you don't want war with Iran, I mean he campaigned on it, so we know that he, he hates Iran. He campaigned on abolishing the nuclear deal with Iran, but then he picks John Bolton to lead all of these efforts. I mean, it's like, it's like starting a fire and then getting applauded and, and congratulated when you stop the fire at the last minute before it erupts and takes over the whole planet.

Speaker 2:          00:16:18       And that's what would happen if we actually did balmy run. I think that people don't understand how precarious the situation is that Trump and these cronies have laid out, not just his, but came so close to being a reality just a week ago. You mean you don't think we should go to war after for bombing oil tankers and, um, Saudi oil tankers, you know, that we should go to war over that shooting down a robot. Yeah. They shot our robot. I would die from Saudi oil tankers and I'd be the first one I put my body on the line. There was a lot

Speaker 3:          00:16:48       people that were saying, this seems like the Gulf of Tonkin too. They're like, I don't, I'm not buying this at all. There were so many people that were like really kind of credible people who were openly saying, this stinks. Like it just seems staged. It's, it seems like some, some bay, like why would they do that?

Speaker 2:          00:17:03       Total false flag shit going on over and over and over again. They're just trying so hard because they want to provoke Iran to the point where he, Ron will be forced to respond. And this is after suffocating x fixating the sanctions that have, that are causing people's lives. I mean, what is it for the folks that haven't been paying attention to this, what is it that makes them want to go to war with Iran? So we have to just look at what Iran is. I mean, Iran just won its independence less than a hundred years ago in a, you know, an era of an, a wave of anti colonial struggles. And we immediately the [inaudible] as well as the CIA. CIA instigated a coup. So we always talk about how we want Iran to have democracy. They had democracy. They had a revolution, a people's revolution that was overthrown. We overthrew Mohamed Duck and instated a absolute monarchy for decades.

Speaker 2:          00:17:53       And at the time it had the highest human rights abuses documented in the world. It was pretty unique in that sense. And you know, you can only imagine why Iran is the way it is today. And there was such a suppression of the Left and of the Communist Party in Iran that the Islamic revolutionary revolution happened in the ayatollah was the leader of that political movement. And that's why Ron has the political system it has today. But it's about the oil man. It is, it's always about the oil and it's always about the foreign domination of the region. They hate that Iran, um, is an independent country and doesn't bow down to us. Imperialism and us capitalism and Iran also his allies with a lot of states that is real in the u s and Saudi Arabia do not want it to be allies with, you know, Hezbollah, Hamas.

Speaker 2:          00:18:41       Um, and so that's, that's a big problem for the u s and it's getting in the way of a lot of kind of goals in the region. But it's really fascinating when you look at what actually happened, because you know, the nuclear deal was amazing. It was huge. I mean, Trump keeps belaboring the fact that he, Ron should not have nuclear weapons. They didn't have nuclear weapons, they never did. And they were agreeing to never have them. That was the whole Iran nuclear deal. But I'm Trump just immediately rescinded that slapped insane sanctions on Iran and now, you know, sanctions every month, just continuing to constrict their economy and even basically sanctions on threatening sanctions on China and India and other countries that actually do deals with the Ron now too, which is totally insane. So once you do that, um, and then you say, well, you know, you're hitting yourself, you're hitting yourself, why you doing this?

Speaker 2:          00:19:33       It's like, no, you're doing this to them. And on top of that, John Bolton keeps saying, you know, there's all these unique threats coming from Iran. We need to surround them with all these warships and they keep sending thousands of more troops, thousands more troops. So you're getting to a position now and now the drone, right? We're flying a drone into Iranian airspace and expecting that they're not going to shoot that down. Why the fuck are we flying a drone and Iran the fuck would we do if you, Ron flew a drone in here, right? I mean it's just unbelievable. The chauvinism and arrogance of the US to be doing all this shit and then be like, okay, now you guys are a belligerent threat. We have to do something. And it's like, no, you guys are the ones and circling them and closing all of their, you know, basically just encapsulating their entire territory and threatening them over and over and over again.

Speaker 2:          00:20:18       Basically hoping for something to happen. And if you look back at the Gulf of Tonkin, there was a guy who was actually on the USS Maddox, the ship that was eventually attacked and got us into the war with Vietnam. And he even said, um, my dad was on the ship and he said, we had no idea why we were there. And one of the generals are captains on the ship just said they want us to be hit. They want us to be a tax. So they can get into a war that they want to get into. And that's exactly what's going on. And what's sad is whoever's in the navy circling Iran, they're going to be the ones who fucking die when he, Ron does launch back. They're sacrificing themselves for these generals and defense contractors. Profits.

Speaker 3:          00:20:58       Now, there's some reason to believe that I ran is not being honest about its nuclear program. Right. I mean, that was one of the reasons why it wasn't that, what was the virus that the United States, stuxnet, stuxnet virus that they put on the Iranian nuclear program to, to kill it while they were in the middle of, um, um, doing whatever they do to uranium. Right.

Speaker 2:          00:21:18       It's for the enrich. Enrich uranium. Yeah. I mean, yeah, that, that was, uh, that was also crazy. It's cyber attacks, right?

Speaker 3:          00:21:24       Right. But the cyber attacks, weren't they effective though in stopping the nuclear program? There was like a secret nuclear program that they were doing.

Speaker 2:          00:21:32       I don't know what exactly they, I don't think that there ever was a nuclear program, but I know that that was another crazy thing that the US did was basically in fact their thing and destroy all of this technology. But I mean basically all we need to know is that they agreed to not develop nukes and it was all agreed from the international community and then Trump gets in there and just unravels at all. And it's so dangerous because Iran would make a rock look like child's play. Yeah. It's not a joke. And I mean it's literally so precarious at this point that anything can happen any erupt into a full blown war. And then when Trump says, oh, I pulled back the airstrike because I wanted to save 150 lives. No Dude, you're starting fires all over the world and then you get a plotted and you want to congratulate yourself because somehow he's still kind of appealing to this like non interventionist lion, which is just fake to me because you don't appoint the most rabid war hungry people to surround you and to carry out these policies. If you don't want that to a certain,

Speaker 3:          00:22:28       well it also created is really weird ideological rift where people were complaining that he didn't do anything and people were upset that he was going to take action. He didn't. There was even about drone. Yeah, well that he will about the drone and about the attacking of the oil tankers and that he was ready to launch. Then he didn't and what wasn't the one on the Fox guys? It was talking about the consequences of taking no actions like Brian Kilmeade or one of those guys. The media is insane,

Speaker 2:          00:22:58       but the media has been attacking him and the Democrats do and the media and the Democrats always attack this administration from the right. Whenever there's some sort of military involvement, they always want him to bomb and go to war. It's pretty shocking. I mean, I guess not too shocking when you realize the corporate media is literally subsidized by like oil companies and banks and defense contracts.

Speaker 3:          00:23:18       No, I know you didn't. That's pretty crazy. You didn't have to deal with that at our ti, but what do you think happens when someone is a pundit and they're on a television show and they're talking about something that has his global implications? Do you think they get talking points? Do you think they're allowed to express their own personal opinions or are they informed that they're supposed to tow a certain line?

Speaker 2:          00:23:41       I think there's varying levels. I think that it would be naive to, okay, these people are paid to lie. I think that the vast majority of people working in corporate media are lackeys for the empire. They really truly believe that, you know, they believe that America's the greatest country in the world. They believe that we're the world's policemen. They actually believe that these countries are evil and they need to be taken out to in state, kind of global, have Gemini. I've truly believe that they cater to the line of American exceptionalism and that's pretty sad, but also pretty dangerous because they're the perfect mouthpieces for us. Foreign policy. I mean they, they essentially are stenographers for whatever the government is laying out, which is really disturbing because the premise of journalism is to actually challenge power and challenge the U s government. Especially when you are working in America, you're an American citizen and there's all this destruction going on from on behalf of your government and you're not challenging that, especially when it's war claims, especially when you have assholes like John Bolton claiming, you know, all of these things are happening in these channels and bodies of water and people are just like, okay.

Speaker 2:          00:24:46       I mean, God damn you should see when fucking Mike Pompeo was talking about how Hezbollah was in Venezuela and these people will just just printed it. They're like, well, Hezbollah in Venezuela now. It's like, what are you talking about? You're literally just printing what the Trump administration saying without even questioning these claims.

Speaker 3:          00:25:04       Hmm. That's disturbing. Do you think that the people that are talking about on TV or just saying it because they really don't understand what they're talking about? And this just seems to be a way to cover the subject in sort of a, a way that zig acceptable to the network and acceptable to the party and acceptable to this sort of idea whether it's left or right, whether whatever ideology there they're participating in.

Speaker 2:          00:25:30       Yes. That there, there is definitely that as well where they know kind of the line that they can't cross. So even if you individually believe, you know, you think that climate change is an existential threat, you think that the war in Yemen is a serious thing that you should address. I think that you definitely get kind of knocked down in the editorial meeting. Yeah. Before and you're just like, okay, no, I can't do that. But what I can do is just, you know, talk about whatever. That's, it's so weird the advertisers will agree with, in

Speaker 3:          00:25:58       this day and age, there's not like a really respected independent source of news, right. That you've got some, the online stuff which is mono, there's some online stuff is very good, but some online stuff is so entangles with insults and, and, and bullshit and, and emotions and distorted perceptions. And Ego that it's like it sort of discredits whatever they're trying to promote whenever, whatever ideas or trying to get across. There's no Walter Cronkite. There's no, there's no one person who, or no one organization who you emphatically trust with their on the news. Everything is either left or right. Everything is like flavored by an ideology. Right. Of a place that I go to that I know I can get clear, unbiased emotion free objective analysis of any international issue. Right. It doesn't exist. I don't mean unless you can tell me if one do you, what do you,

Speaker 2:          00:27:06       well I mean I go to a real news, I go to democracy now and the only reason

Speaker 3:          00:27:11       no super left wing, right, left wing leaning, but yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:27:13       left, left leaning. I mean I go to places that are not, this is the problem like with capitalism and try and have an independent media, is that you need funding and you need funding from like donors and grassroots sources. Because once you get funded by these right wing billionaires and corporations and states and governments, then it becomes very ideologically driven and then you're kind of just catering toward what those interests want you to present. And I, I'm, that's why the empire files does what it does. It's, we're basically based on donations now because Trump sanctions on Venezuela shutdown the show a year ago. So we did a big donation drive and that's my husband Atrio Patrion we're on go fund me and I'm just paypal. But we're just trying to survive on a very minimal budget because I don't want to take, you know, I don't want to like lobby to corporations or states or, or go that route because I don't want to, I don't want to answer to anyone other than myself.

Speaker 2:          00:28:09       But then you just come with a whole host of problems. You're not getting your message out there. I mean, that's why it's incredible for you to have me on. But that's why the fake news mantra resonated so much with the Trump campaign because people are extremely disillusioned with the corporate media. You know, New York Times, Washington Post, these so called beltway publications that pretend to be like the arbitrators of, uh, our objective reality. They, um, they are the premiere advocates of fake news when it comes to us foreign policy, you know, American exceptionalism and corporations and like the corporate line, they're always the ones towing the things that basically prop up the system. And so I think people, you know, became really, really, uh, just attracted to that whole fake news mantra that Trump was saying because people have an extreme distrust in the corporate media because of the Iraq war, because of all these things that have happened.

Speaker 2:          00:29:03       But as you know, and as you've talked about extensively, Joe, this wave of censorship that has happened in the last two years since Trump got elected because of Russian propaganda and fake news hysteria. Yeah. And it's just propped up these same institutions. Um, and it's really just gone after a lot of alternative and independent media that have gone by the wayside. Yeah. Um, and you know, people who have been propped up by right wing billionaires and billionaires in general are not going to be effected at the end of the day. But all of the people who've been caught up in this censorship with the algorithms, with the d platforming, um, it's really scary. It's really, really scary what's happened. It

Speaker 3:          00:29:42       is scary to me because the Internet in my eyes is this unique place where people can get information and distribute information. And then on top of that, you have this almost parasitic entity that is allowing you to distribute information and gather information through it, but also controlling the flow of information and then controlling the flow in its own ideological bend like it to Sorta match its own ideas of what should and shouldn't happen. I think they feel justified by having a guy like Trump in office, having a guy like Trump coming into office and go, well, we have to do something about that. So what we're gonna do is we're going to silence conservative voices. We're going to silence conservative pundits were going to silence w call people outright and just change our algorithms to make it much more difficult for them to get propagate for them to propagate their ideas.

Speaker 3:          00:30:44       I just find that really distressing because I think that in the marketplace of ideas, you, you're supposed to be able to combat a bad idea with a better idea. And this is how we, this is how ideas evolve. This is how people get to communicate. You got to look at what someone's saying, look at someone, how someone's dissecting what someone's saying and then for yourself, figure out what you believe and what you don't believe. And there should be a free exchange of information so that you could figure that out. And when you show, when someone's shown to be a bad actor or a liar or show, have deceptive news, fake news, whatever you want to call it, the, okay, now we know and this is a clear example of that. So now take it with a grain of salt whenever they say anything about anything else.

Speaker 3:          00:31:29       But when you d platform them and shove them aside, they say, see, they're trying to silence us because they don't believe us or are they? They don't. They don't want us to be in power because they're trying to prop up whatever left wing socialist economy that are dictated that they want to put into place and it's this weird sort of situation where you've got people dictating and almost engineering our culture, right. Curating our reality. We, you know what's going on in Toronto with Alphabet, the parent company of Google. Now this is a very disturbing thing to a lot of people where they're essentially setting up blocks and they're putting cameras in these places and they're gathering data and information and the trying to engineer a utopian city. Yeah. I was reading about it yesterday and I was like, no, like this is a terrible idea.

Speaker 3:          00:32:19       It was like, what if terrifying. What if these people don't want to be filmed? What if these people don't want information gathered about them? Like they're still doing it under the guise of here it is. Alphabets plan for Toronto depends on huge amounts of data. Yeah, we need more data collection, data mining, their ideas that they're going to make it easier for people to get around and smoother. But how facial recognition, I love how they always say, oh, people are being sex trafficked and this will help. It's like, no dude, this is like 0.0001% of all the people that you're, you know, data mining. So sidewalks, labs released more detailed plans for Toronto, the site of Google sister companies first attempt to bring its technophile digital forward sensibility to a full scale development project. The sidewalks lab, sidewalk labs projects dates to 2017 when the Canadian city welcome to company to an undeveloped section of its waterfront.

Speaker 3:          00:33:15       Now after 18 months of speculation work, Oh God, I am. These motherfuckers especially can work in backlash from local advocates. The company has a 1,524 page master plan for the 1212 acre lot called quayside. First of all, I hate that fucking name wayside. That was quite [inaudible] for volume plan, highlights ambitious and sometimes flashy innovations from sidewalk labs, which has played pledged to spend 1.3 billion on the project. If it goes forward, the company hopes to construct all the buildings with timber, which says is better for the environment. It also catches fire and build an underground new modic pneumatic tube system for garbage removal and wants residence to lean on public transit, walking and biking rather than personal vehicles. Good luck. It's fucking zero degrees in Toronto. You assholes and plans to build streets with autonomous vehicles, perhaps from a sister company. Waymo there. Listen, every robots with dealing with Waymo is no, no, I don't need a delivery.

Speaker 3:          00:34:15       Robots might trundle down. It's wide sidewalks at your strategic use of large, very large umbrella like coverings might make outdoor spaces comfortable all year round. No small feet and lake shore Canada sidewalks, sidewalk wants to designate 20% of its of the apartments to as affordable and another 20% as middle income. So they're, they're engineering city, right? This is by people who are really just openly social justice warriors. I mean these are the people that censored that James Damore guy and fired him for having this memo of what that really kind of discussed women in tech based on evolutionary biology based on studies. And they, they said that he was highlighting or harmful gender stereotypes, which it's not true. It's not accurate. If you look at what he actually said and what he actually wrote, even at a page and a half dedicated in that memo trying to come up with strategic ways to encourage women to get into technology. This study that the paper that James Damore has no relation to, the way he's been framed and the way people talk about him. And this is a direct result of Google and Google's social justice warrior or um, sort of ethos, like the way they operate as a company. Well, Google pretends to be, you know, don't be evil. This is, this seems like style. Don't make shave up on, don't be evil. It took that down by the day. Why the fuck would you ever take that?

Speaker 2:          00:35:38       Now they're like, okay, where are you evil now, but this, this just seems like it. They like plugged in some shit in algorithm and they're like, all right, this is our city now. Like when they're creating sims, I mean Google, I agree with David Pac man's kind of depiction on Google. I think that they're a giant corporation. They have billions off shore in tax havens and they are not liberal. They, they appear to be liberal because that's capitalism. You're trying to basically adapt to where society is at and you want to pretend like you are socially conscious. But when you look at their actual policies, they're conservative as fuck. I mean, they actually fund a lot of crazy like Koch Brother, um, Alec, they fund, um, a lot of right wing organizations, the federalist society, they've given a huge grants to. So I think that they're kind of playing both sides, deregulation to lobby for kind of the deregulation of their industry. So I think that all of the perception and the mantra of Google and youtube and you know, catering to like the social consciousness and, and you know, what you're talking about, I think is honestly just to make more money.

Speaker 3:          00:36:43       Well, I'm sure they're going to make more money in the process of doing this, but the idea that they're going to engineer a city to me is terrifying. That's insane. I just don't, I don't like it. You know there was a great podcast that Sam Harris did with the guy who was explaining, um, what Google as essentially done and what they've done with data. The data is essentially a commodity that we didn't know as a commodity and we all gave up our rights to this commodity and this commodity turns out is worth billions and billions of dollars and no one had any idea and they just took it and now they have it and they have it. And what are they giving you for this? Right? They'll let you search things like what are they giving you for this? So let's use their email. Like it's, it's kind of crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:37:25       Yeah. They search your email for certain keywords and all of a sudden you know you're looking for a patio chair and you're like, I'm am looking to buy a patio chair and also sudden your fucking Google mentions to fill the patio chairs. Cause you sent an email really, really creepy or just talk about something and it talks about, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, my, my guest yesterday, my friend will Harris, he was talking about a trading in his car and he got a fucking text message, a text message that said, hey, I hear you're looking to trade in your car so you know, here, here's a, here's a link as to what you could get for it. He goes, I'm not clicking that fucking link. Like a text message with a link showed up on his phone because of something he was talking about. He wasn't even talking on the phone. That's what's crazy. Really, really scary. It's fucking insane. Yeah. No, that's fine. How does that happen? Does anybody know how that happens? Right? Like if you and I were talking right now and you said, ah, I need a new laptop and you started getting laptop ads and your Google feed, what is happening? Is your phone listening to you say that? Yeah. Yup.

Speaker 2:          00:38:27       No, I mean it, it comes through everything. I mean that's what's so fucking scary

Speaker 3:          00:38:31       and that apple is the best at it in terms of like not up your data.

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       It's one of the reasons why I still use an iPhone and support apple. Apple goes out of their way to not share your data when you use maps. That's why apple maps suck. It's one of the reasons why it's not good. She was a fucking great article that was written about it. Uh, they called apple maps. The being of a, of of navigation tools. It's like, you know, bing, the search engine for the fuck uses that. I use a windows laptop. Use being the fuck out of here with that. Google is better. Right? So you just got automatically use it. But Google just go and Google fucked. I mean no and all the,

Speaker 2:          00:39:10       well going back to this whole like tech censorship thing, they preemptively changed the algorithm. That's what so scary to me is that there wasn't even a law. You know, like China, we are, we all know that China's sensors, the Internet, we've done the same thing here. But people just think that we still have freedom of information, that we can all access all these things. No, I mean Google, youtube, because youtube is owned by Google now, but they preemptively changed the algorithms. They backpage all of this progressive media, independent media. So it wasn't just about what they're saying it's about, I mean, this, this was targeted to basically all extreme views. Everything that they felt like was too radical. I mean, going back to the DNI report, which is where this all started from, this kind of conclusive report that they said, these 17 intelligence agencies, you know, here's, here's all the evidence of how Russia colluded and costs the election for Hillary. They cited my show on breaking on breaking the set. The, you did it? Yeah. They said I was part of the conspiracy of Russian

Speaker 1:          00:40:07       Madeline. Did you rush in metal mean are you a Russian? Putin told me to do, man. I mean, I'm sorry, take that as a snippet. But in the, in the room

Speaker 2:          00:40:18       poured it said, um, she fomented radical discontent. And when you look at what all this is sowing discord, all of these, um, you know, the black box algorithm from a Hamilton 68 dashboard like this US government funded Twitter crawler that just like determines what's Russian propaganda, what's fake news. And then you have, you know, Facebook working with the Atlantic Council, which is an organization stacked with the literal spooks, cops, CIA heads and defense contractors, UAE, US, government. Um, that's who's like curating our reality now. And it's all about expunging the most radical views on the Internet to prop up essentially the system and the establishment. And that's why I know it's not a liberal or conservative thing. It's literally just extremists thought and radical thought that challenges the status quo. Um, because sowing discord just means disagreement. That's what they said. This was about these websites. So discord, Joan, I mean that's, I thought that was a fundamental thing about American democracy is that you talk about what we disagree on and when you look at what the report says of what breaking the set covered DMT, that wasn't in the report you were on there talking about Dan

Speaker 1:          00:41:29       that's talked about aliens. Fuck we wanted, but because I talked about things like inequality and occupy Wall Street and Hillary Clinton, that was all part of this grand conspiracy to sow discord on behalf of the Russian government. So it becomes very comical once you, you know, kind of poke at the underlying narrative driving this way but sends a share of a Renee to rest his work. Did you ever pay attention to know? She was on my podcast and she detailed what the IRA did, the Internet research agency right in Russia and it was really fascinating. They, it's set up like a fake black lives matter account and then they would talk about how as black Americans, we can't vote for Hillary Clinton because of this. And they started, did they develop these communities, these really large online pages, whether it was on Facebook or Instagram or whatever it was, where they spoke as like a southern separatists or as a Muslim.

Speaker 1:          00:42:31       But yeah, I mean they would have dozens of them and they developed these communities and they developed these communities and they would set up these organizations and then they would have events where they had one where they had a Texas secession, uh, event directly across the street from, uh, a Muslim pride event. And they did it on purpose so that they would fight. They put him across the street from each other. They organize these Facebook pages and these events and these people show up these people that are Texas a sec, we should leave the union. You know, we can Texas as a republic. And then they have these other people on, they want like Muslim rights and they want the Sharia law and they put them right next to each other and they're there. They're literally engineering argument and their engineering fighting. And the idea was that someone wanted this to this idea of promoting discord, right?

Speaker 1:          00:43:19       They wanted arguments. They wanted to fuck with our democracy and that they could shift it just a little bit. By doing this, by having these arguments, by pretending that they're there for Lbgtq rights, but they're really not. But they're really just, some Russians are just, you know, talking shit and that this is what we need to do. We need to radicalize the head. ANTIFA groups. They had all these different groups. I mean, Israel and Saudi Arabia do the same thing except we analyze dramatic. Yes. I shouldn't be governments unit right now. It's fascinating that we just focusing on Russia when my God, this is happening on every front. I mean look at going back to Pete, Buddha's judge, judge, judge, you say his name, but he has like a hundreds of sock puppet accounts that are all like propping each other up on dress. Oh my God.

Speaker 1:          00:44:00       I just saw it's like blacks for Pete. Buddha's judge, gaze for Pete Boucher. It's like all these making these his, I mean, I guess he thought that that was a, I dunno, injected with corporate money that he's just like, all right, make a hundred sock puppet accounts. It's like, Oh God, everyone does this shit. But when we focus in on just Russia, and then of course you have, um, the removal of, you know, Syrian accounts. You have the removal of pro Maduro accounts on Twitter. Why is it only that we're talking about our so called enemies that these are the people who are sowing discord and fomenting radical discontent. What about all the other countries that, you know, we do it all over the world. What about all the other countries that are doing the same thing? So if he really does have the sock puppet accounts that are doing this, that are pretending that these are just fans, you know, that's, that's some sleazy shit.

Speaker 1:          00:44:45       Yeah, it's sleazy as hell. I mean, that's a sleazy, it gets, in my opinion, that's dirty shit. You're pretending you're a person who's just an independent person who supporting you when really just is an employee who's there for some propaganda purposes. Especially like the identity politics thing, like all of the different groups, you know, marginalized groups support you. Yeah. It's all fake. While the craze Astros, you saw that um, town hall after the shooting a cow, my top shot sky and then everyone saying, how the fuck are you going to run for president when you can't even run a city? Yeah. Doesn't even job this one. I'm confused. Like have jobs running for president giant jobs. Who's running the city while he's there? What's going on? Yeah. Imagine if I just say, Hey, during this I'm not going to do this podcast anymore. Uh, I'm going to go get a Brian Cowen.

Speaker 1:          00:45:37       He's going to be meeting here now on and a I want to run for president. Might as well Brian callow for Joe Rogan experience. Like what? People would be like, what the fuck is happening here? It's like you have a fucking city to run. Yeah. Why are you running for president? How can you, the fucking Metro's falling apart too much time. Do you spend actually being married Pussy Shit. Damn money back, dude. They just want the book deals. They want to go on the view. They want to have a reason to be relevant views. It's disgusting. It's pretty gross. It should be illegal, Megan Mccain. It really should be. If you really, really shouldn't, you should quit your fucking job, whatever you have and dedicate 100% of your time to doing that. If you think that you could have that, first of all, everyone knows what a grueling thing it is to run for president.

Speaker 1:          00:46:19       It is a fucking time consuming. Massive commitment to your energy. How can you do that and also be the mayor of South Bend? Yeah. You just have to be on the phone begging for donations when you're not jumping on tables like Robert O'Rourke is all over the country. It's a lot of work. Yeah. There's no way you run in that city and how fucking crazy are these people's egos? I mean they say that Trump is this existential threat that he's the next Hitler. He's mentally incapacitated. Yet they all jump in the race because they think they're the smartest people in the world. So it's like two Blasio. It's like, really? Yeah, they're pulling so low drop out, dude. This is all to try to prevent Bernie from winning does. It really is who makes sense to you? Is Bernie makes sense. Bernie is my guy. Bernie's my guy through and through. And I'll tell you why. Because a, we need medicare for all. We need to abolish student debt and that shit. You just Tax Wall Street gambling done medicare for all, cut the military budget done. I don't want to live in a country where people are rationing insulin. I don't want to live in a country where half of the go fund me campaigns are because people are going to die if they don't get donations for healthcare. What is wrong with this country? Um, but back to Bernie, I mean, you look at the last 30 years

Speaker 2:          00:47:30       of political advocacy. This is a guy who's been the saying the same thing for 30 straight years. No matter if it's veteran's rights about Gulf War Syndrome, um, about just a political revolution as needed. I mean, he's been talking about that since he won the Senate seat initially. And you can't really say the same thing about any other candidate. And I do like what Tulsi Gabbard is saying. And I do like some of the things Elizabeth Warren, the, but it seems like she's just making it up on the fly and adopting kind of burning light policies. And I think this is all a strategy to, to siphon all the delegates away from Bernie because we already know this Third Way Corporate Wall Street funded organization that's like Corporate Democrats have said they want anyone but Bernie. Bernie is the biggest threat to the establishment by far.

Speaker 1:          00:48:14       Did you see when a Charlemagne called Elizabeth Warren the original Rachel Dolezal Oh my God, sure. Facey she's not, she doesn't have a chance. Not, she doesn't have a chance with the trumps shit. No. Trump has to say as Pocahontas over and over again, and it's hilarious to me. As I say, Pocahontas is racist. Um, it's a fucking Disney movie. How can Pocahontas be racing flats up? She really, really screwed up. That's a big fuck off. It's a really wound up getting the DNA test. I am 200 times more African than she is native American. Um, I'm 1.6 for example, man. The Ego of these people, it's like she's just so upset that Trump, yeah, I mean I so nuts that she went and got jobs saying she was native American.

Speaker 2:          00:49:01       I mean, yeah. It's one thing to say I have native American blood. It's another thing and I don't know how much you know, ancestry native American ancestors you has, but I do know that she was, you know, that was on like her Harvard yeah. Bio and all this stuff and it's just like, what is going on?

Speaker 1:          00:49:16       Well Jamie is going on. James talked about it. He didn't get them done. [inaudible] he got into school, Ohio state. You're a professor. He's got an iris, but he thought he was, a lot of people thought he was my, my wife thought she was, my wife thought she was part native American, so she got her DNA. Don's like, hmm. Fucking bunch of fucking liars. You know what, with Warren's more native American than that wife, that was a thing. I think my life's still more native American. She's a little bit, but that was a thing where, um, people were like, they wanted it to be spiritual. They would say they were part native American. They wanted to be extra cool. Well my native American blood, oh I can, I smell and wolves are coming. Like you can put your ear to the ground. He know what it's going to rain. Just they felt like they were more connected to nature. It's like some weird thing I remember in high school, like when kids wanted it, we cool. They would say they were part native American and you're like, ah, wow. Well the native American community immunity

Speaker 2:          00:50:14       came out after she got the DNA test and they said, this is not, this does not make you native native as much more than like whatever percentage of your blood. I mean, native is, uh, you know, it's a way of life. It's a culture. And it was really kind of, um, gross. That whole thing was just bizarre.

Speaker 3:          00:50:33       What was gross is even after the testing, she was trying to use that as proof that she was correct and then people will analyze the data, like, are you fucking crazy? You know, small this percentages, this is an insanely small percentage. But she was saying that Trump needs to give her $1 million. Yeah. Because of the fact that she did take the test. Like

Speaker 2:          00:50:51       it was insulting to the native community. It was embarrassing all around. And it was also just weird that she even did it at the behest of Trump. Like why did you do that? Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:51:01       Gotcha. But he had, she had to do it cause he kept saying it over and over and over. Right. Yeah. I feel like she's a politician, you know, and, and I say that in the most unflattering of terms. I feel like she's one of those people that just says what needs to be said in order to get electronically. That's what it seems like we're, I don't get that impression from Tulsi at all. I don't, I don't feel like that's who she is. I feel like she's a, a veteran who did two tours in the Middle East and who's a congresswoman from Hawaii who really wants to do good. I mean, I really do think that what she said, she doesn't take any corporate money. None. She wants this, she wants this job because she thinks she can do a better job than what has been done before and the other people that are running for it.

Speaker 3:          00:51:42       I really believe her. I mean she's, she makes sense to me. What do you think about Bernie? I like a lot of things. Bernie says, you know, one of the things interesting now that people are mad at him and he's rich, right, let he met a lot of money off his book, is that you go write your own book, your own money. I mean, and the, there's a lot of, you know, criticisms that people lobby against him. What I like about him socially is that what he is standing for is the downtrodden he's standing for the people that are dead don't catch a good break. When he starts talking about things like income inequality only say I'm like, okay, I understand what you're doing and why you're saying you put what is the cause of income inequality. Like what? That's what we need to find out. We need to find out what's the cause, like why, why are these poor communities the way they are and why that needs to be helped. That needs to be fixed. There's so much that can be done that's not being done and right. At least he seems to be. He seems to be calling out to the people that are, that are ignored, that you aren't, aren't being served by Wall Street.

Speaker 2:          00:52:51       Right. I mean, a big problem is one automation happened, um, wages stopped going up with inflation and then credit subsidized all of the wages. And that's why people are just indebted to credit card companies where you know, up to our ears in debt and that, and he does talk about that and he talks about the solutions to that. But you're totally right. I mean what other candidates have these 25 people are discussing things that are going to reach like a populist, you know, have a populous

Speaker 3:          00:53:19       Andrew that are reaching people. Andrew Yang is like what Andrew Yang saying and I, and I, he again, Tulsi does not seem like a politician. I believe him. He's an entrepreneur and a businessman and he's warning everyone. He's, he's like the fucking Paul revere of automation. He's like, you know, look, artificial intelligence is coming and you're going to be out of jobs. The fucking half the country is going to be out of jobs and we can actually figure out a way to get through this. And there's a bridge that we can make and through this universal income, universal basic income, you can develop a bridge where you can give people their basic needs, food, water, shelter, give them food. Like make sure that no one's starving, that we, even though people were out of jobs, make sure that their needs are met. So then they can go and find a way through this mess and then figure out a way to contribute and make an income and make a, make a living and adjust, but to have nothing to have nothing.

Speaker 3:          00:54:10       Like what, what is that? Like you can't just have people out of work because of automation and people go back to the industrial age, well, hey that happened during this and that and yeah, okay, did it didn't, but it didn't work out well for all those fucking people that lost those jobs back then. We should, we shouldn't have to go through that massive chaotic situation again. If there's a way to engineer a better way through it. I don't know if universal basic income works. Um, you know, I've talked to a lot of people that think like, uh, Nevada, uh, he was on my podcast recently and his perspective is it doesn't give people meaning and it's not a good idea cause you need a life. If you want people to be happy and you want the to be able to do something, they need to have meaning in their time and what they do. Just to give people money, it's not going to make people happy. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:54:56       Yeah. I think it's a bandaid. Yeah. I think it's a bandaid. I agree with the concept that Yang proposes about ubi, but yeah, I think that if we give people like healthcare and and have their basic needs met than not, it's going to give them the ability in them like to maneuver, to find their passion and to be able to have that space where they can fulfill their lives.

Speaker 3:          00:55:16       Yes, and I think there's a way to do both. There's a way to find meaning and have your needs kept. I mean, the idea is that Jay, you know, it's, I don't think that people should get free money to the point where they could live a, a full rich life and go on vacations and have a nice car, a nice house, and never have to work again. It doesn't make any sense. You should, you should contribute, right? Everyone should contribute. But if you're in a job that's going to be completely annihilated by automation and artificial intelligence, it makes sense that as a community, as a culture, we should figure out a way to give people money so that they can have a place to live and food and then try to come up with and sort of engineer some sort of a program to help people find new ways of income, new ways of making living. I don't know what that would be. You know, and, and when I talked to Tulsi about that, she didn't know what that would be either or this idea of trying to promote new jobs. People say that we're gonna, we're gonna create new jobs. Like I hate that expression. Like what does that mean? If there's not a job, how are you going to create a new journal? Our infrastructure?

Speaker 2:          00:56:20       I mean, God damn takes like that. I mean, good God, we've been given an

Speaker 1:          00:56:24       f like every year by the army corps of Engineers and shit's falling apart, dude. I mean, look at the new deal. Look at what Fdr did and that's what Bernie keeps saying. He's like, I am literally in stating and economic bill of rights that FDR did a hundred years ago. Why am I considered radish a radical extremist when I'm just trying to give people basic economic rights and trying to propose jobs to rebuild this country? What happened to that promise that Trump lovey during the campaign? We want to, you know, he talked about our infrastructure crumbling. What the hell's been done on that front and also there was the big one is the economy like the the debt rather like how much we're in debt. We're in debt and more. Oh my God. Yeah. Crippling one point 6 trillion for student debt alone. That's insane. What do you think about the people that are calling out to try to eliminate student?

Speaker 1:          00:57:10       I am 100% on board because as possible, absolutely. And you just tax Wall Street gambling literally that can do it alone. You do not have to pay me by Wall Street gambling. Bernie laid it all out. He, I just read this morning on the way here, so I don't know the full proposal, but Wall Street just makes you know, billions of dollars. I don't know how often, but just like betting on these trading and shit like Wall Street just make so much money and if we just taxed Wall Street or you know, like you're talking about taxing, these defense contractors are actually trying to change the laws to not have these corporations hide billions of dollars off shore and tax havens. It solves all of these problems pretty quickly. Um, and it's not a matter of how can we do it. It's a matter that we have to do it because students are totally crippled.

Speaker 1:          00:57:59       There's no opportunities in this country inequalities the highest that it's been since the great depression and that's a huge problem. We're not going to be able to get people opportunities at all or a better life. It's also so crazy that you do that to people that are 17 years old, right? They don't have any idea what it's going to be like to be 35 and be quarter million dollars a year. Parents have student debt. Yeah, they did. Yeah. My step, my step father was in debt when he, when he graduated from school. It just seems like it's getting so exponentially worse. Yeah. I mean he handled it, but it's what you have today if you don't have any, if you don't have any grants and you just try to go to school based on, you know, on loans. Greg Fitzsimmons was here. What was he saying? His kids were, it was 60 plus thousand dollars a year for each one of those kids, I think a year.

Speaker 1:          00:58:50       And then there's each one of his kids and there's no jobs once you go and you know, go to school. Right. I mean especially if you have anything technologically related to the idea that at the end of four years the technology is going to be relevant. It's, it's great. Right? Exactly. Then here's the crazy thing, like we all know that kids, human beings, their frontal cortex isn't even fully developed by the time they're 25 until they're 25 wow. I smoked way too much. We had four then we saw much smarter than I am. So lucky that I always smoke weed like maybe six times before I was 30 I get super late. Yeah. Yeah. When I was 30 I became a stoner. I was, was not a pod headed. I thought it was for losers. I thought it just made me, because in a lot of people that don't smoke pot think that they think it just makes you lazy and stupid, but being lazy and stupid, it turns out it makes you lazy and stupid.

Speaker 1:          00:59:37       Right. It's not actually apply. It turns out it was not the pot. But yeah, I tell everybody just don't do it when you're a kid or if you do do it. Don't do it often. I mean, if you, I don't think it's, you know, like if you're fucking 18 years old, you smoke weed once in a while with your friends. I don't think you're gonna get fucked up. But, but like every day, stoners, it's terrible for you. It's just, you're, you're in a fog. Like you need to be able to deal with reality. But what in it? Like I always say it's a tool. Use it. Use it correctly. Don't, don't, you know, don't try to do everything with a fucking hammer. Sometimes you need a screwdriver, sometimes you need a saw. John, she has a battery your fucking life with weed. But occasionally you smoke, uh, weed, smoke a joint rather than, you know, you have a meal with a friend and you feel like more close to them.

Speaker 1:          01:00:25       The Communications Fun, you're warm and friendly. It's like, it's a great, I don't want to call it a drug cause I don't like that expression. This blanket throw over amphetamines and sedatives and all these different things and you throw marijuana in there. It's, it's a sacrament and I think it should be used in the most general and the lightest use of that term as a sacrament. I like to use it, I like to use it for certain things, but it's definitely not something you should use all the time. It's just, it's definitely not something you should use as, as a kid, you know? And I, I see a lot of kids that are smoking every day. I'm like, man, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, it's used as a crutch more and more because I think people are just trying to numb out what the shore, but pay better that than pills.

Speaker 1:          01:01:08       Right. You know better that than alcohol. God, dude, I just read something about how death by suicide is going up in the US and it's going down and almost every other country in the world. It's like, what does it really fucked up problem everything, man. I mean, it's the same reason why so many people are, it's the same reason why people are dying on, you know, Dean on prescription pills. It's like America's uniquely fucked in so many reasons and I think it's, it can be the lack of health care. It's, it's that we're, you know, the center of global capitalism. I mean, there's a lot of reasons why essentially the empty pursuit. Realistic, Yup. Yup. It's an empty pursuit. Right? And when you get there, it doesn't, doesn't feel good. You just like, you just keep trying to chase in more and gather more things.

Speaker 1:          01:01:55       Just like that study that shows that there's a cap on happiness. It's like, it doesn't make you happier when you have more money in certain points. Yeah. 100%. And I'm in agreement with that. Doing something you love is what makes you happy. Having good friends and having family and people that you love, that makes you happy. Doing things that you find rewarding, you know, and helping people. That's the weird one. Like helping people makes people happy. And this, it's so kind of like, people are like, yeah, you got to look out for yourself to take your business. Right. It turns out no. Yeah, no, no. For other people is like super rewarding. Like it's a selfish thing to be generous and kind selfish in lot of ways because it really helps yourself. Well, that's the whole mantra of, of growing up in America as you need to help yourself and you're a loser if you don't get rich and all this shit.

Speaker 1:          01:02:45       It's all these impossible, um, you know, goals that we can't do without actually help from each other. No. The biggest losers, rich people who are sad, right? God Damn Right. You're rich and you're still depressed. You're super successful and you're still depressed. I've, wow, you built a shitty house. Like your foundations sucks. You know what I mean? Cause like your foundation, like who you are as a person, like the way he treat people, the way you view the world, the way you love your friends and your family, that's your foundation. And if you become successful and you have that foundation, I feel like you can still be happy. But if you become successful and you just shit that foundation away because you just wanted to make it, I'm just going to make it fuck all that stuff. I don't need that then I don't need love.

Speaker 1:          01:03:32       I don't need any of that. And then you make it and you just sitting there alone. Yes. It's like a fucking tomb. That's why I think that's why a lot of people like Trump because they think of him and like, I've actually heard this term like a blue collar billionaire. It's like what? He was given a million, if everyone's given $1 million from their, pappy is a couple million. Yeah, a couple, a few, couple of million from their daddy. Um, yeah, you'd probably have it a lot better off. Small loan of a couple of million bucks. No big deal. Unbelievable dude. To him, that is a small loan now. That's what's really bizarre. He, yeah, he's someone, I think Matt Taibbi described it best. He's like, what a stupid poor person thinks of as a rich person. Oh my God. Yeah. And his, and his idea is just to throw money at everything. Like the Palestine Israel thing.

Speaker 1:          01:04:15       Did you see Jared Kushner's whole layout of like this is the new peace plan? No. Oh my God. It's literally just let's give them jobs, meaning let's have corporations like basically profit off. The occupation was interesting to me is that even right wing Trump supporters in particular should say right wing Trump supporters do not seem to like them, do not seem to like Jared Cushner or they don't like the fact that his daughter is working in the White House and that the southern law is, they're running things like they're very disturbed by that. They don't like that. Yeah. Nepotism. I mean, well, what's weird is they just blow at the fucking wind. Man. I saw fair and had 11 nine totally recommend it to everyone that is listening. Michael Moore's newest documentary. Oh my God, it's amazing. But the first 20 minutes just shows like how Hillary lost and it shows that Jared Cushner actually lobbied to have sicko in theaters all across the, I mean he was forced socialized medicine and he was like working hand in glove with Michael Moore to roll this out. It just shows you how fickle they are and like how they just have no actual value trying to make money.

Speaker 2:          01:05:18       Yeah, just try and make money. This is a great idea. You know his voice is really high. He's like,

Speaker 1:          01:05:24       it's weird. Yeah, it's super weird. I'm sure the two of them together, it makes, it's very strangely they have sex. I think they do. No, I think jerks off with a cop. She gets up, she squirts it in there and shit. She kicks him never out in fair night, 11 nine

Speaker 2:          01:05:45       he shows a just how bizarre and inappropriate Trump is with the Banca, but there's this one talk show where the host is just like Ivanka. She's like, what are what? What do you have most in common with your dad? And she's like real estate and golf and she's like, Trump, what do you have most in common? The bunk. And he's like, well I would say second.

Speaker 1:          01:06:01       Whoa. Yeah, that's like w w what father says that? Well like what do you have most in common with your baby sec comment, your move. A lot of uncommon cuts. It just in common in common. That's such a crazy super just Friday and like I want to fuck her but I can't because she's my daughter. He just says so many crazy things. I just, I think that guy is just always talking, you know? And when you're always talking to him for a good chance to really contemplate what you're saying, you're just always just talking. And then once you're taught like so many times during the campaign trail, it just seems like you would say things and then you would just have to like justify what he said. You know, I've done that. When I was younger, I would say something stupid and then I would have to try to figure out how to make that stupid thing makes sense. Right, right. In Trump's just constantly goes 27 year old man. I'm like, yeah, it's here. Play Ivanka, what's the favorite thing you have in common with your father? Either real estate or Gulf. Donald's with your daughter. Well, I was going to say sex, but I can't relate that, that's the crazy thing is he thought about it and decided he wasn't going to say. Yeah, I was going to say.

Speaker 2:          01:07:21       And everyone's like,

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       yeah, cause he's on Wendy Williams and he wanted people to scream. I want to say just a good opportunity to say sex like crazy. He's out of his mind.

Speaker 2:          01:07:37       Oh, there's a whole montage of creepy shit that he said like he would date her, you know, when she was a baby, he was like, she's gonna grow up and hopefully have big tits or whatever. Like he said, really? And he hates Tiffany. He hates Tiffany because she is not, because she's not attractive.

Speaker 1:          01:07:54       Oh, that's the the one. Yeah, with Marla maples. Does that the other daughter. Good, good point. I don't actually know who Tiffany is. I mean, I think he had her with the was very attractive, so it's weird. That is weird. Oh, something happened. Some sort of cross inbred lighting, but he just pretends like she doesn't exist. It's kind of sad. Wow. Are you to do these? Look, I don't know how the fuck you can pay attention to anything other than I don't understand how a president, it's still a job. I mean, it was a great job when Lincoln was running things, you know, and probably extremely chaotic. But with today's economy, when you're dealing with all these different threats to the environment, cyber threats, the economy, all the shit, they have to deal with. The idea that one person that's supposed to be the general manager of the country, the company.

Speaker 1:          01:08:44       That's absurd. Absurd. It's absurd. And the pardoning power, usually that's supposed to be like sympathy pardons for people like Chelsea manning. Yeah. Not for war criminals who have killed a bunch of civilians. Like what is, I mean basically saying, has he done that yet? Is He, is he, he's, he's talking about as the seal. This is like more than just the seal. I mean he's, he's contemplating actually partnering the No Service Square Massacre Blackwater employees. It's like what the fuck is going on here? But that's to me that's like sending a message to soldiers like act like Isis and you'll be fine all part in you. Meanwhile look at what he's doing. A Julian Assange. Yeah. This is like going beyond the Japan. Sean's things weird cause I thought that he would be a guy that would want Julia the Sonjay out talking out of both sides of his mouth. He said how many times during the campaign trail, wikileaks, I love wikileaks, but then you look back before the campaign, he said Julian Assange to get the death penalty on Fox and friends back in the day.

Speaker 1:          01:09:41       But again, I think he probably thought about that a micro second before he said it and then how to justify it. Right. What I mean he's just like, he's just talking to crazy. You probably had eight cups of coffee, four red bulls to diet pills. I just went out there and that, that doll so scary though. I mean a Sanje, um, that it's beyond the Pale because now you're not just prosecuting whistleblowers with the espionage act, you're actually prosecuting publishers. That's like a whole level of a direct assault on the first on journalism press. Yeah. He's a legitimate journalist in that regard. Right. What he's doing is he's distributing information people that is literally when it changed the way people view the way the government and the military works. It's, I mean, it's incomprehensible how much the world has changed and what we are aware of because of wikileaks revelations in the past 10 years.

Speaker 1:          01:10:30       I mean, even just the film that I just made Gaza fights for freedom, I cite a wikileaks cable about how Israel wanted Hamas to win and Gaza and um, they said that they were strategizing for that to happen so then they can regard Gaza as a hostile territory and then just relentlessly bombed them. That was because of wikileaks. I found that out because of that. I mean, I can't believe what is going on because people, um, I didn't, I don't think that, that people really knew that Trump would take these powers and becomes so authoritarian with them. Well, what's disturbing to me is wikileaks used to be something that people on the left would cite as evidence at the military was out of control or that the military industrial complex is of control then because feel like somehow

Speaker 3:          01:11:14       or another, the wikileaks was involved in helping Trump. They became a Russian mouthpiece and a, and a trader. I mean like the left over the last few years in particular, since the, since 2016 wikileaks has been sort of read, sort of redefined.

Speaker 2:          01:11:33       They're conflating Julian Assange, just personal politics. And I don't know what those are. I know that he had those private dams with Trump jr, which looked bad, but what did he say to Trump jr he was talking to him about, you know, we need your tax returns. So then people don't think of us as like a biased organization and the, and it would look good and kind of like, you know, a little too buddy buddy with Trump jr. But that does not take away from the importance and validity of what wikileaks is as an organization. It's awesome. What's curves area? Talk to another person giving their opinion, which makes sense. People just really don't like join us on [inaudible] as a person. And it doesn't matter how much you hate Julian Assange, this is completely beyond the Pale what's going on to him. And um, it's, it's, he needs to be defended, his rights need to be defended and very few people are defending him.

Speaker 2:          01:12:21       That's even more interesting. What's crazy is these charges, um, that just got unveiled what the Trump administration, they're trying to extradite hinder the u s of course, and he'll just be sitting in a cell for the rest of his life if he doesn't face the death penalty. But the charges have nothing to do with the 2016 election at all. Do they all have to do with the, um, the massacre, the collateral, the collateral murder video. That's what it has to do with it has to do with the same thing that Chelsea manning was in jail for releasing to him. And so they've just trumped up all these charges based on him publishing war crimes. And that's really what this is. It's publishing war crimes and embarrassing the US empire. And what is the, what, what are they saying? What are they calling it? Like what is the, the actual chairs saying that he helped Chelsea manning hack into, I forget. It's like some sort of charge that it's basically concocted. Um, they're saying that he helped, Chelsea manning basically released the information to him and that's how he's part of the conspiracy. It's total bullshit. Completely concocted. He, he's a political prisoner and he needs to be freed. And it's absolutely astounding that the Trump administration is doing this and that people are going along with it. I see people applauding this. It's sick. It's weird. It's weird.

Speaker 3:          01:13:33       It's weird that shift in how people used to defend him and now no longer do. And nothing really has changed in terms of what he's actually,

Speaker 2:          01:13:40       dawn, it was a traumatic election and people's reptile brain's got activated hardcore. Yeah. And they think everything is Russia and they think join us on just Russia. And I think anyone who's talking about what us foreign policy is towing the Russian line, towing the Kremlin line. It's not about the people who control this government. It's the dark evil forces behind your friends and family and the people who are talking about, you know, sowing discord and shit. And that's, it's a disturbing time because it's hard to relate and actually have these discussions with people.

Speaker 3:          01:14:08       Yeah. I think you nailed it when you said the 2000 elections

Speaker 2:          01:14:12       of sort of they've awakened this reptile brain because that's what it seems like you're seeing. He's seeing so many people that think that there's a war going on like a war in this country. Right. Instead of discussing things, they don't want any discussion, they want to shut things down. And that's part of, I think, some of the motivation behind this and justification for d platforming people, wiping them out, like remove them, get them out. You know, we are at war right now, we have to fix this. We have to get a woman president, we have to be a gay man. We have to get, you know, it's like this kind of shit that you see, like they feel like they're in an ideological war. That's why identity politics is so fascinating because it's just been adopted by the establishment, by the liberal wing of the establishment to try to like trick people that were somehow a progressive society that it's all just like corporatism with, you know, under the flag and the banner of like social politics and identity politics.

Speaker 2:          01:15:03       And it's completely absurd. I mean, with Barack Obama, we thought that we were in a post racial society because we had a black president and we know that that's absolutely a falsehood. So I just think that we're just going down the wrong path here and I'm, Neo liberalism has really, uh, done a number on this country in the world and we're going to see kind of more authoritarian fascist policies take root because people are really down and out with, with how capitalism has morphed and um, has strangled basically the economy. It's really disturbing because you know, you're looking at like left identity politics but it's under the banner of capitalism. So really it's just about privatization. Neo Liberalism has just about privatization. So it's not about like leftist, you know, socialist politics and even you look at someone like Bernie Sanders, he's not a socialist, he's a democratic socialist.

Speaker 2:          01:15:58       Um, which means that he just wants social democracy. He's not talking about abolishing private industry's not talking about nationalizing anything. He's just talking about having workers have a seat at the table and getting the fair share. So we're just kind of, we've gone off the wayside of like rhetoric and we just have no idea how to talk about these things in like a fair way because things are so heated and ideological and people are just blinded I think and and don't really understand these issues well enough and it's really disturbing because we're at a point in our country where we need to have conversations. We don't just want soundbites, but going back to the the censorship stuff and the consolidation of corporate media, people don't have the platform. They don't have the voice to get these ideas out there, which is why your show is so important. I mean having people like me like Tulsi, I mean bringing out these concepts and and shifting the consciousness is very, very important. Well I think that when people are hearing the same thing over and over and over again from one side and then an opposite view over and over again from another side, it's, it's very difficult to have an understanding

Speaker 3:          01:17:10       of what the fuck is going on. It's very confusing to most people and I think they tend to either just give up or they tend to just find whatever side seems to get them the most social credit or the most most a reasonable perspective in their terms, like whether it's left wing or right wing and then just support that. Just just given to that and then just have this pattern that they adopt this, this conglomeration of opinions they adopt and then they're so busy with their jobs are so busy with their family, they're so busy with her life and then all this other shit when you're seeing, you know, deregulation, all this other shit you're seeing when the stuff that caused the banking crisis, this stuff, all this stuff is going on and it's going on without their knowledge. It's all happening underneath the surface and then something erupts like the economic collapse of 2007 2008 and they were like, what the fuck is happening right now?

Speaker 3:          01:18:04       This happened, I didn't see this coming and now the economy crashes and then we have to buy out all these fucking banks. And then, and then it rebuilds back up and people were still doing the same goddamn thing. They're still working and trying to get ahead and try it. And then all this is happening behind the scenes and it's so incredibly difficult to pay attention to all of it. Of course, to really develop a nuanced perspective of what the problems are, how to fix them, and then who is actually going to support a real tangible solution versus who's just saying some Elizabeth Warren type shit to get elected.

Speaker 2:          01:18:36       Well, that's why we need a real mobilization in the streets because there's no person who's going to change this. There's no top down, you know, implementation that's really gonna Revolutionize Society and get people living wage and get people healthcare. Even Bernie said, I'm not going to be able to do this. I need you to come out to get my back. Right. Um, but yeah, I mean there's nowhere in the country that you can live if you're living on minimum wage and actually afford a two bedroom apartment. I mean, that's the reality here. But when we bailed out the banks in 2008, um, no one had a fur had fretted about how we're going to pay for that. I mean, it was just, it was just kind of understood. Okay, we're going to pay and give the banks the bailout. What about fucking us? Yeah. Don't we deserve a bailout? What about the people?

Speaker 3:          01:19:21       Yeah,

Speaker 2:          01:19:25       thanks too big to fail. The banks failed in the people fail. It's unbelievable, man. And all this shit that were spent, I mean, the Venezuela's shit, all these sanctions, uh, it is the Venezuela coup. I mean, where are you following that? That was insane.

Speaker 3:          01:19:40       Falling in as much as you were sort of putting all as much. You are putting a very alternative view, uh, as opposed to like what we're seeing in either left or right wing publications. You were in the, and you face a lot of resistance because of that. Right? Right. But you were there.

Speaker 2:          01:19:58       Yes, yes, I was there. And that's why I knew with my own, I mean I saw with my own eyes, the reality on the ground. And what do you think is over there? So what is happening over there? I mean, if you pull Venezuelans themselves, they will say that their quality of life has less than two because of US sanctions. So back in 2015 Obama declared Venezuela in national security threat. Very random. There was no threat, obviously posed to the u s but it was just to kind of start the sanctions on them. But when the truncation, who knows, who knows? Pressure. I mean there's always been pressure because of course the US has always hated Maduro and hated you go Chavez and the US empire doesn't forget and it doesn't forgive. And you know, going back to 2002 Bush tried to engineer a coup against who goes Chavez.

Speaker 2:          01:20:45       That didn't work. And so what we've done with these civil society organizations is try to foment radical discontent on the ground in Venezuela to try to, you know, get some sort of uprising. Um, the guy won Ypo was just some guy plucked from obscurity who was just well known in Georgetown in Washington DC. Much more well known there and then he wasn't even in Venezuela. So, you know, this was completely engineered. It was totally concocted. No Venezuelans really knew who he was. I think like 80% of Venezuelans had no idea who [inaudible] was, but um, you know, the economy went into a spiral because oil prices dropped and they would've been able to pick back up their economy. But unfortunately the sanctions were so debilitating that it went to complete freefall. Um, Venezuela's not a socialist country. That's actually the vast majority is private industry and a lot of those, um, private CEO's are very anti government.

Speaker 2:          01:21:41       Um, long story short is that the coup was initiated, you know, during the Trump administration after he slept like 70 sanctions on Venezuela. And we're talking about medicine, food, all the things that they're saying that they need, right. That they're trying to stage these fake aid caravan deliveries, that was all bullshit. What they're doing is actually preventing the delivery from food and medicine from getting the Venezuelans. And this coup was a failure because the resilience of the Venezuelan people, they believe that they have a democracy. They do have a democracy. It's actually more free than, than our democracy. There's not a dictatorship there. Um, Maduro won a presidential election last year. He won a presidential election. The US lobbied the opposition candidates to not run against him. So then they can say it was illegitimate, that it was a dictatorship. And so he won. He won the popular vote, and they tried to implement all these things and they've been blocked.

Speaker 2:          01:22:30       And you know, the opposition keeps crying to the US that they need help, that they need to be invaded. It's pretty disturbing when you have opposition candidates saying, slap sanctions on us and Vader, our country help us. Trump help us. I mean, it's absolutely ridiculous. But when I was on the ground, I saw a flourishing democracy. I saw dozens of people, hundreds of people who said that they love the process there, that they believe in the bullet Varian movement and that they're Chubbies mode til death. And we don't understand because those people's voices are totally censored from corporate media. The only Venezuelans that we hear from an corporate media are rich opposition. Either you know, expats or people who just have fled. And what do we hear from corporate media? What does, what does the corporate take? So this is even Elizabeth Warren, even Bernie Sanders has been terrible on this.

Speaker 2:          01:23:18       Um, I mean it's, it's really bad. I mean their take on corporate media, if you're looking at like Fox News, they'll say we need to overthrow Maduro and, and you know, everyone's starving and it's a failed state. Um, they never mentioned the sanctions. They never mentioned. The fact that US sanctions just from 2017 alone has killed 40,000 Venezuelans. This was just a study out by seper 40,000 Venezuelans have died from Trump's sanctions, from insulin shipments not getting there primarily. Um, um, a lot of other things, um, medicine wise that people have not been getting. And they are dying. So that is absurd. You know, we, we like to think of sanctions as kind of like the soft power that just targets elites of the country. No, it's an act of war. And that's exactly what's happening to Iran. And Trump's implemented sanctions all over the world and a really devastating way.

Speaker 2:          01:24:09       But, but the corporate media, we'll say we need to overthrow them. They're a failed state. They're, you know, they're a dictatorship. Um, and reality, no, they're not. They're democracy and they don't like their politics. That's really what it is. We don't like the fact that their politics, their politics are that they nationalize the oil. And that's really where it comes from. This fake ambassador that was trying to get into the embassy here, Carlos Vecchio, he's an ex Exxon lawyer and you see all of these people who were involved in Exxon mobile and all of the oil industries that, um, were flourishing in Venezuela before Chavez got, uh, got elected and they just want their profits back. They want their money back. They don't like the fact that Chavez took the profits from the oil companies. That's what the, that's what the crux of the problem is, Joe.

Speaker 2:          01:24:55       Um, and it's amazing. It's amazing how transparent it is. So ever since these failed coup attempts over the last decade, the u s has been foment in regime change through the civil society organizations, USA ID offshoots in the country and um, and basically trying to foment violent unrest, violent unrest to the extent that they burned down streets. There's lynch mobs. I mean when I was there during the height of the violence in 2017, like 200 people died and the news just kept saying, Ma, like insinuating that Maduro was going out there with police forces and actually gunning down people in the streets. It couldn't be farther from the truth. We looked at all the deaths, we broke them all down. We looked at death records and um, we found out that the opposition Lynch mobs were actually responsible for the overwhelming majority of deaths in the streets. So that's happening. People get lynched for being black. They get lynched for being Chubbies mode. These people are targeting maternity clinics, hospitals, basically any enclave of government services, because that's what this is really about. It's about of kind of a fascistic bent of the opposition wanting to take back the power from the poor. The poor people got power and they didn't it, and

Speaker 4:          01:26:04       that's what the crux of the problem is, but when you're looking at the corporate media, it's an absurdly cartoonish brush that's being painted. And then if you look at the liberal media with Maddow and all these other people, they either don't talk about it or they say Maduro needs to let the Aden. You even saw Bernie and Elizabeth Warren. Zane Maduro needs to let the Aden let the aid in Maduro. The aid was the COO. The aide was, was a trick. They're getting aid every day from countries that are not trying to actively overthrow them, but we staged this big stunt on the border. I'm of Columbia, and by the way, Columbia is actually suffering more than Venezuela. Columbia is in dire poverty. There's people getting assassinated every week who are labor leaders and teachers. I went there and I talked to a teacher who's living in exile because he's scared for his fucking life.

Speaker 4:          01:26:48       Um, but we don't hear about that, right, because they're allies with the US. Um, so it's, it's cynical stunt to try to get this humanitarian international outcry to say, Oh my God, people are dying. People are hungry. It's not a matter of that there's no food. It's that food is very expensive because there's an actual economic war being waged by massive corporations in the country and just external entities, whether it be the Trump administration or us multinationals that are ex fixating, preventing aid and food from coming in. And the aid that they're, they're claiming that they need to accept is basically a hoax. It's a stunt, um, to try to get regime change to, to happen. Um, we just saw Richard Branson stage some ridiculous, um, big concert on the border of Colombia. And they had like what they said were aid trucks on this big bridge and you had CNN on the ground being like, all right, they need to let the aid.

Speaker 4:          01:27:44       And the one that they let the Aden and the aid was, it was fake. It was just a truck full of like, I don't know, like very minuscule things, but they wanted to try to ram these trucks through just to get the soldiers up in arms and to try to get them to defect. It hasn't worked. They've been trying over and over again to try to get something going. And basically at the end of the day, what happened was just a giant money grab. It was basically a money laundering scheme. You look at these people who are the opposition leaders now won wide. Oh, Carlos Vet Geo. They've just stolen all the money back. Um, maybe they realize the coup wasn't going to go forward, but they basically ended up stealing at least $70 million in just putting it right in these people's bank accounts. It's pretty shocking. I mean, you have international, it's an international conspiracy to try to take the money back from, from the people whose monies was, was basically, um, administered by Maduro for social services is nationalizing Theo oil, nationalizing the oils, the root of it all.

Speaker 4:          01:28:41       And also just uplifting the poor. I mean, poor people got a voice and they never had a voice in that country their entire lives. And that country was, you know, it was a colonial holdover. And so the bullet, Varian movements started this pink tide all across Latin America. And um, it was scary. It was a giant threat to the u s establishment. And actually that's why Telesur was founded. Tell us or the, the, the organization that I used to sell the show too, it was started as kind of a counter to this global hegemony in this corporate narrative trying to overthrow these democratically elected leaders. But it's shocking when you see like the Bank of England seized all of this gold that was rightfully Maduro's. They seized it illegally. All of these, these banks and international bodies just stole all this money and they just gave it to these opposition leaders.

Speaker 4:          01:29:28       So even though the opposition leaders weren't able to take, you know, take the power back in the country, they still have taken all the money and no one's talking about that. And everyone just acting like this is some crazy dictatorship that needs are saving. How dare you? Who the fuck do we think we are? We're uninformed, right? Yeah. Is that what it is? Yeah. You should check out. Everyone should check out our empire files. Um, Youtube channel cause we've done extensive coverage on the ground, really going into the nuts and bolts of what the economic crisis really is. And my partner Mike prisoner did this epic take down of John Oliver. You know, the liberal media is just as bad. John Oliver did some fucking absurdly false kind of like analysis of the whole Venezuela situation and we just went through and debunked every single line of it. I mean it was extremely disingenuous.

Speaker 3:          01:30:16       I bet he had someone who wrote all right. Right. So I bet he probably has no real knowledge of it nor could you really, unless you extensively studied it the way you have and especially if you have feet on the ground. Right. I think that most people just in order to understand a complex nuanced problem like some sort of an international conflict that we're involved in that has to do with nationalizing oil. Like God damn, you got to do a lot of work do you do and if you run in a show like last week tonight or whatever the fuck this show's called, you have producers doing everything for you. Yeah, someone else is doing that. I mean you, you find that with a lot of these so called online experts when you talk to them one on one and you get them off the record without notes like they're just people.

Speaker 4:          01:31:03       Well there's this guy that's un human rights investigator named Alfred [inaudible] that I did this big interview with and he said he tried to propose this to the UN saying there is new no humanitarian crisis there. This is all fake. Yes, people are suffering and dying, but it's not because of Maduro is policies and corruptions because of us sanctions that have excess, fixated the economy and prevented any sort of recovery from taking place. And the economy is still in free fall. They can't work with international bodies. Again, we have the threats of sanctions with institutions that now work with Venezuela. So they've been isolated, they've been isolated from the world. So was the idea that they just

Speaker 3:          01:31:39       put the sanctions in place, allow this political unrest, take place, support the opposition and then just have a slow burn until it all collapses, come in and swoop in and fix everything and make it a part of the United States government. And

Speaker 4:          01:31:52       then those people will not have a voice any longer. And um, another thing that they hate is that Maduro has given 2 million free homes people. That's something that's completely unheard of to maybe Americans. But that's one thing that one why doe said that he would do, he immediately implemented a new hydrocarbons law or he was proposing to implement a new hydrocarbons law, which is again, you know, reprioritizing the oil. And also just immediately privatizing all of the social services that Maduro and Chavez did. So it's, it's pretty shocking what would happen. Um, and pretty devastating what would happen if, if windows crew did succeed and the whole Trump administration, I mean it's not just Venezuela, it's Nicaragua and Cuba too. I mean we can't go to Cuba anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:32:35       Yeah. That's a new one, right? Yeah. One of that happened a couple of weeks ago. Right. What was the purpose of what was the rational, because socialism is terrifying and we can't just let this small island nation just live its life. We have to create some genocidal blockade that prevents food and medicine from getting in there too. But what was the, the, was there a justification? Did they say why they were doing this while are imposing these new laws? No, it just, John Bolton's bizarre speech about the troika of tyranny number, that number, the axis of evil. Remember that? Yeah. But now it's a troika of Tierney, Nicaragua, Cuban, Venezuela. And it's like, wait, I thought that I thought that we are fighting a war on terrorism. We're going off to Nicaragua too. Yeah. Cause of Ortega. Yeah. They hate anyone who leans left. They want to crush crush. Mm. It's pretty fucking nuts. What's happened is a weird one, right? The Cuba ones. Cause what, what has happened over there? Nothing. There's no, they're not. Yeah. Right. The only thing they just did was actually give out free HIV prevention pills and they, that's where they fucked up big Pharma. That's really fucked up and we're not into that.

Speaker 4:          01:33:43       Yeah, no, it's the Venice where the thing's a mess. It's so difficult because it's so nuanced. But that's, you know, I encourage everyone to maybe check out Venezuela analysis and empire files and tell us or if they want to learn more about that situation.

Speaker 1:          01:33:55       Have you encountered any demonetization of your channel from discussing these complex issues?

Speaker 4:          01:34:01       Yes, we have. Um, so we actually stopped monetizing altogether. So we are added free. But we would, we would have been demonetized I'm, I'm absolutely sure. And we also are slapped with age restrictions and sensitive content bans on almost every single video that we put up, whether it be Israel, Palestine or Venice.

Speaker 1:          01:34:20       Really. And then what would cause you to get an age restriction or a sensitive content bent? Like is there anything that is like a fairly innocuous video that you guys have put out that I was also gotten a clue? Absolutely.

Speaker 4:          01:34:33       Like Mike [inaudible] video about John Oliver was just literally taking clips from John Oliver and then critiquing them and they said that was sensitive content van. It's like, well what do you mean? Why is that sensitive content band? Um, but I think it has to do with an issue because you're criticizing an HBO show. Uh, no, no, because it's happened with some, with almost every single one of our videos. And so you have to make sure that you're logged in, that you prove your age. Just all these different steps and gatekeeping

Speaker 1:          01:34:58       methods to prevent people from, from getting access to our channel. And another crazy thing about it is if you just search like empire files, Venezuela, like it will take you a really long time to actually find our work. Even if you type in the channel name Abby Martin and, and these subjects, it's, it's really difficult to find. And they've made that difficult to find on purpose. I have no doubt. What's also weird, like how they determine what is trending. Right. You know, cause it's not real. Right, right. Trending. Right. Really? What is trending like? Uh, Alex Jones freaked out. I was like, they're their key cause of video. You've got millions and millions of hits. Like they're, they're censoring us from trending. I'm like, dude, I got news for you. I've never trended ever. Really zero. You know, that's fake. That's where it's fair. Yeah. Right. Zero times a channel of dummies.

Speaker 1:          01:35:45       But shouldn't they be building your channel up? No. Some people like it, some people over there like it. I think it's too fucked up. You know, I think there's like, they don't know what I'm doing. Like there's not, it's not, you can't put it in a clear box and there's too much, too many comedians on and there's too much weed and people get drunk and they, you know, they talk crazy shit and it's uncensored. I just think I don't, it's a very complex thing. This sort of, but you know, it's happening. There's, you know, someone has made a choice to never have it trend. It's trended zero times how many views we had total. You're talking about that one report the guy did. That's in earlier times we have trended but it's been like a very few amount of times, like over five years. That report was like over a one year period he'd but we haven't trended in years.

Speaker 1:          01:36:40       The main channel as our clips channel pops up there every so often. Let's channel this. Yeah, it's a weird slip. I wouldn't know. It's hard to now trending page. You have only the only one that's up now is our pages in a good gauge to mark stuff I don't like. Well it's not like this is the news of the day kind of page does help people like see people that are trendy seemed to look at. I know that he's your friend to Peter Joseph who's been on this show before his, you know zeitgeists and the Zike guys trilogy was like one of the most popular videos online and that was totally fucking censored. Yeah. 100% well can barely find that anymore. This is the issue that people have with Facebook and Google in any of these gigantic online corporations that are deciding what is and isn't popular and, and, and using algorithms to steer people in directions. You know, one of the more fascinating discussions that's happened over the past few years is this understanding that there are algorithms, favor people arguing about things. Like if you want to have a subject like say abortion and you put up a, uh, you know, if you're a pro choice or pro life person, you're going to get steered towards things you disagree with so that you didn't, you'd engage with them more because that's where the money

Speaker 3:          01:37:56       is. The money is in you being upset and engaging. And that's where people, that's where people really get into it. So the more you engage, the more profitable it is for our Facebook and the more they encourage that type of behavior. So they're, their algorithm actually encouraged, pisses you, encourages pissing you off and wants you to stay on youtube and just go down the rabbit hole, particularly um, Facebook. But with youtube, that was one of the weird New York Times piece, the radicalization of some soft minded child who got online and was turned into a right winger and then was subsequently turned into a left winger by another, another video. And they're like, finally he was saved. Like, are you sure I didn't read it? Yeah, it's just nonsense because it sort of connected a lot of people that aren't even right wing, including me with the radicalization of this young man.

Speaker 3:          01:38:48       And they did link some websites that or some youtube channels that are right. You know, that are right leaning and even far right. But they also threw in a bunch of other ones that like Philly d right, who's not right wing at all. Me and a few other folks. Well that's the algorithm. The algorithm just takes you down, down, down. Yeah. But they were New York Times article was suggesting that we all were right wing cause it was a sloppy article. Just wasn't resident really well done. But what's interesting is the conclusion, ultimately he was saved by this by their algorithm. Their algorithm led him, led him to an opposition of that left wing person. Youtube employee wrote it or assumption that idea that this is the thing that drives me crazy. Save you believe something, right, and then if you go online and you read something else and that something else is contrary to what you believe and you start believing in that something else somehow or another, that's bad.

Speaker 3:          01:39:49       This is one of the great arguments against censorship is like you have to figure out what the fuck makes sense. The only way to figure out what makes sense is to read all kinds of things, to engage with all kinds of content. The idea that we're supposed to protect people because we know what's right. We know it's correct. Well, who are you? Let me, let me talk to you. If you think you know what's correct, you're the arbiter of free speech are the arbitrator of of, of logical discourse and and and common sense in this world. Let me ask you things. Let me talk to you. Let me get to the heart of how you feel. How do you feel about trans kids transitioning when they're six? How do you feel about all sorts of crazy weird things that have just been propped up as logical and makes sense?

Speaker 3:          01:40:35       How do you, how do you feel about war? How do you feel about abortion? How do you feel about ghosts? How old are you? Who are you and you just, you just get to choose whether or not someone lean or information that comes to them leans left or right. I think it's preposterous. I just think it's incredibly dangerous because you have to have an unbelievably complex and nuanced perspective in order to be able to dictate what makes or does not make sense and you, you have to have a lot of information at your disposal. You have to have a lot. If you're talking about something like Venezuela, let's look at that, for example, to look at what you know and then look what you see in what you would call progressive, left wing media. That to your knowledge is incorrect and it's basically propaganda points. It's being read distributed in this way that is palatable. Now imagine if the people decide that you, Abby Martin or somehow or another part of some right wing conspiracy now and they, they're going to censor your voice and sense of Europe because it doesn't fit in to this narrative that there, because you need so much information to be able to really understand what's happening in this one part of south South America. The word right. Exactly. It's so complex. Well, they treat us like children.

Speaker 4:          01:41:55       Um, and they think that we're not smart enough to actually discern what is information that we need. And I mean, I want the Russian perspective. I want the Venezuelan perspective. I want the Chinese perspective because I feel like we're smart enough to really determine our own reality based on all the available information.

Speaker 3:          01:42:12       Well, this is where we're fucked, is that we don't have a reliable independent source that's not filled with hyperbole and emotion and, and, and dunking on people and screaming and insulting. And I want someone who can break things down logically and clearly with no ideological bend. They, you're not leaning left. You're not leaning right. What, where is that and why? Why doesn't that exist?

Speaker 4:          01:42:39       Because it's not necessarily human. And, and you know, people have opinions and they have biases and either they couch those biases in like these think tanks and pretend like they're these unbiased journalists or are they just kind of wear it on their sleeve? Like I do, um, with empire files and media roots, which is my, you know, my news organization that I do with my brother Robbie, but I mean, we try to lay it out, but we also don't hide where we're coming from. I almost appreciate that more than, than a lot of these journalists so called journalists who are really kind of stenographers who pretend like they are unbiased and they're like, I'm just giving it to you straight. And at the end of the day, they're, they're really not, they're trying to tow a line and they're trying to push a certain perspective, but it's just not obvious. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:43:22       It's just, we live in such a strange time where we are overwhelmed with data. I mean, right. Overwhelmed. Do you, you cannot get away from it. And there's no way, there's not a fucking human alive that understands all of it. It is impossible. It really is impossible. And it's so hard to find out what is true and what, what is bullshit,

Speaker 4:          01:43:47       right? Oh my God. What you posted about how you can now change people's,

Speaker 3:          01:43:51       like you can make a picture talk. Yes. Oh, that crazy

Speaker 1:          01:43:57       way. Mona Lisa of a wave of lies. I know. I was like, oh, that's what the Monalisa looked like. Cool. [inaudible] it's unbelievable. I like to do coke planes even though they like you could have the Mona Lisa say anything really disturbing

Speaker 3:          01:44:13       what we're in for. What, like what's coming? Buckle up. Buckle up. Yeah. Right. Imagine the fourth, fifth, and sixth generation of this technology beyond lies by government, you know? Oh my God. And then being utilized by someone to sort of, I mean, you could easily justify assassinations if you can prove that someone's saying something fucked up, you killed them, and then you release a tape of them saying something fucked up. Totally. That this person was trying to overthrow the government. Yeah, sure. For sure. For sure. Oh my God. Just a drone strike anyone. What I'm hoping is that if you look at what this technology is doing with technology in general is doing particularly like information technology, Internet, cellular phones and smartphones and all these devices and then all the various new incarnation that are coming out. What they seem to be doing is they seem to be creating portals for which information is more quickly accessed.

Speaker 3:          01:45:09       It's more and more transparent, like ideas are getting to people quicker. There's less. And I think this is one of the things that these companies like Google and Facebook and Twitter and also that they're trying to like figure out a way to manage this like, well this is just too crazy. We have to figure out how to manage information and get it right people, things that they want to say. But I think ultimately it's going to fail. And I think ultimately as technology, as all these innovations keep coming down the pipe, we're going to get closer and closer to this time where everyone has an instantaneous and equal access to information. And I think that when that time does come, lying will be virtually impossible. I really do believe that because I think we're, we're probably a decade away from implementing some sort of a device or an ability to read minds or, wow, I believe that that's kind of terrifying.

Speaker 3:          01:46:02       I think they're going to develop some sort of technology that allows us to link up together and through some, some sort of, some new way of communicating that we did. We don't foresee now, but if you just look at this trend, like what is the trend? That trend was, oh, you go to the library and get a book. Well now you can get a book online. Well now you get a book on your phone. Well now you could have that book read to you on your phone. And now, I mean it's all this now, the Australian accent, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. It keeps getting closer and closer to you. And I think there's going, I mean, when Elan Musk, he's been very vague about it. He won't really discuss what he's doing, but there's neuro link thing that he's doing that he thinks is going to radically increase bandwidth between human beings and information.

Speaker 3:          01:46:45       And he thinks it's going to literally change humanity. Wow. What the fuck that means? But if he's working on something like that, he's not the only one. And if you're wearing some sort of a device that allows you to access information that this radical paid what, what the next step would be was to, is to make it so that you can tap into some sort of a universal language. And this universal language would not be dependent upon the various languages that we use were Spanish or Chinese or whatever it is, but some sort of a new language that kids learn in a new language. It's a universal language that's distributed through online platforms and have this all go straight to your fucking brain. Wow. It's going to happen. We're, we're becoming cyborgs and some sort of a weird way. And that's the other thing that Ellen said, we're already sideboard were just carried around with us and that's what your phone is, right? We're so dependent upon these devices. It just seems to make sense that the general direction that all this is going is to becoming more and more invasive. And more and more inclusive, more and more invasive in terms of it's, it's the way it's sort of ingrained in your body and becomes a part of your life. Put becomes more and more a part of everyone's life and then more inclusive in terms of more access to this information and more access to thoughts and I just think we're, we're just a few years away from someone making a breakthrough.

Speaker 5:          01:48:16       Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:48:17       I think in some ways it's probably oh Joe and says he's going to do this. If I showed you this before, this thing is called alter ego where he can talk to it without moving as a mouth and it communicates with a computer. This is a, this is over a year old, so I don't know what the developments they've made sense then. Yeah. I sent this to Ilan and he says, it's just a trick. You said, this is basically like a trick. He said, yeah, this has given you information. You don't need to talk to it. But he said, well, he's doing is far more complex. And then I asked him questions and he went radio silent on me. I'm just going this, this has gotta be the first step for that. Look at that guy. Looks like a Dork wearing that thing that my two scientist, he probably figured out himself.

Speaker 1:          01:48:54       Yeah, probably. But that looks like some iron man type shit. He's going to wear a football helmet that does that. And if I just go one step, this is like, then the next thing they get is on a Bluetooth thing. Just touched your ear that like everybody's been already been walking around with for the last 25 years. So he's essentially essentially calculating his groceries as he walks around. Yeah, he's just, this is just probably the connected to his phone. I was just sort of showing you this, this is already may be available and like they're showing this as proof of concept. Go back this up cause it was, let's read the narration because it just said something there. So without it right there without any voice or just go back to witness. Okay. Really right there

Speaker 3:          01:49:29       without any voice or discernible movements, enabling the user to communicate with devices. Just let it play. Um, AI assistance applications or other people in a silent and it's too fast. Yeah. So bad video wrote. Yeah. How will the fucking read that fast? I'm reading

Speaker 6:          01:49:48       it pretty good. That very simply by vocalizing their eternally subutex faster than me. That's insane. You'd be wearing one of these devices to tell your brain.

Speaker 4:          01:49:58       They're trying to tell you you're stupid. You're stupid. Do you need this please? Can I play? We have a little trailer for the film. Could I play it real quick? Short, where's the checkout empire files and it's the most recent thing. How long have you guys been a independent, like ad free? Basically a year. Um, since I came on, I, right after I came on last year, um, the sanction shutdown our show and so we had to do this giant fundraiser and it was just absolutely, um, very difficult to do that. Here it is. Yep. Okay. Let's check it out.

Speaker 3:          01:50:31       Empire files, Gaza fights for freedom. And this is,

Speaker 6:          01:50:33       this is the little trailer for a film that just came out. [inaudible] what does [inaudible] our oldest daughter, she was my first choice and she was killed. She's a medic. You want to read this first? I'm female to field volunteer girl. She was the first to go to the margin camp mints and everyone participated. I participated, the whole family did. My husband, my children, my neighbors, my siblings did too. All Palestinians participated. It was up there are marches peacefully if we do not carry weapons. And we showed there with her big chests. We stand before a huge force of afford to fight army with tanks. Gus and war planes or marches, peaceful reasked for our rights. I have the right to have a country. I have the right to have a home. How all those refugees have the right to return to their homes. Yeah. During this protest, is this when these people were shot? What we're seeing here? Yeah. So it's a lot of people who are getting carried out clean little kids. Yeah. And they're shooting at them. And this is um, isn't it time yet? She says, everyone around the world is sitting there watching us and they're all comfortable with our lives. Here we are under siege. We have no borders, no life. Where are we supposed to go?

Speaker 4:          01:52:05       So this is coming out in a couple of weeks. We're, we're fine tuning it. But we just had a big theatrical release in downtown and it was, uh, it was really cool. That's where you saw the Oliver Stone yesterday or, but yeah, it's, it's, it's sick. I mean, you texted me that video of the kid, you know, another medic was just shot. So

Speaker 3:          01:52:23       yeah, there was something crazy Balaam, Mohammad, who's one of the UFC fighters had on his Instagram. And I texted you that it's, it's, so again, this is another thing, it's so difficult to understand what's actually going on. There's so many pro Israel people that put their head in the sand and don't want to look at some of these atrocities and don't want to look at some of the videos that you sent me of soldiers shooting at people that are not doing anything. Right.

Speaker 4:          01:52:52       I mean, yeah, I mean, their whole argument is that it's all Hammas and their human shields. I mean, we looked through hundreds of hours of footage that these people gave us and it's mind blowing footage. It looks absolutely cinematic and epic. Um, but the footage is heroin and I didn't see one weapon. I didn't see one militant, not one weapon. It was literally people with slingshots throwing rocks at tanks. It's kind of a rite of passage. It's very symbolic. They're not trying to hurt anyone. No Israeli soldiers had been hurt or killed. Um, you know, during 2018, which is what the film looks at is, is through 2018 of the great march of return and there's not any weapons. There is no militants. Hamas has nothing to do with these, with the march. And um, it just shocking. I mean it's shocking how many war crimes were committed on camera and it's just amazing the propaganda. Um, that's just told to us about what this is and why they have the right to kill people that pose no threat to them.

Speaker 3:          01:53:50       When you were on last time when you talked about this, one of my email accounts was flooded with literally a chain letter, the same letter like denouncing you and your lies and your anti semetic perspective and your anti Israelis perspective. It was, it was weird because it was the same email,

Speaker 4:          01:54:13       astro turf guy was fake. Yeah. You know, that's a campaign, you know, that that has a lot of money behind it. Yeah. There's a lot of money behind that. I mean the film is mindblowing. Go to Gaza fights for freedom.com if you want to check it out when it rains, when it gets released. And it's just a really on in controvertible Joe. I mean they're, you know, even if it were a war between armies, all of these things that Israel has done are still documented war crimes in very grievous violations of international law. And we're talking about direct targeting and assassinations by Israeli snipers of disabled people have children, medexpress and medics. And that's what, who resigned was, she was a medic. And as you mentioned, another medic just passed away. Um, was killed rather. I hate to use the passive voice because you always hear Palestinians died.

Speaker 4:          01:55:01       No, they were murdered. They're all being murdered by snipers and they pose no threat to them. And so the film looks at this, you went investigation basically during the march in 2018 and documents all of the grievous, um, crimes and atrocities conducted by the Israeli military. And I mean, you know, Palestine is a right to defend itself and this isn't even what that is. Um, but if you look at the UN Charter of 1978, they say that, you know, occupied people's and besieged peoples have the right actually for armed self defense. And the fact that this is not even what that is, that there's literally people going out there and peace with their bare chests holding flags and they're getting killed in sniped. There's so many amputations. I mean, just in 2018 alone, there was 35 kids who were killed. 900 shot Jesus. Yeah. That's children. And, and you know, some of these stories or heroin, a kid hiding behind a trash can who was sniped a kid who went up to the fence and just put a Palestinian flag and she was shot in the head and died instantly.

Speaker 4:          01:56:05       It just, it goes on and on and on. And so, you know, we're just trying to document this to really kind of push the needle for accountability because these laws have been agreed upon by the international community, some of them a hundred years ago and to have kind of a rogue state acting with complete impunity, knowing that it has total protection from the u s empire and given more freedom than ever under Trump with this goal on a heights thing and the moving of the Jerusalem embassy or the moving of the embassy to Jerusalem. I mean it's just, it's a bismal and it needs to be stopped and um, you know, they can't control the narrative any longer because we're seeing this with our own eyes and that's what this film does is really lays it all out.

Speaker 3:          01:56:45       Abby, you concentrate and focus on so many different fucked up parts of the world, but you, so you're very friendly and upbeat. Like see, like you're laughing at this. How do you manage to maintain your sanity? Cause I, I I have a hard time if I just watch one of your pieces, right? I watched one of your clips and I just go, what the fuck? I'm just want to cry and I don't know what to do and I want to hug my kids. But you're in this, you're in the trenches every day and you go to these places all the time. How do you, how do you do it?

Speaker 4:          01:57:19       Well, I think that, well first of all, I, I go and camp a lot. I get into nature a lot, which is also kind of depressing knowing that, you know, climate change and blah, blah blah. But I try to get out and see the beauty of the world and understand my privilege, especially as an American citizen because I don't have, we can't afford to not be aware and we can't afford to not be educated and talking about these issues, especially when our government is subsidizing this around the world. $10 million every day with our tax dollars, you know, I mean this is, this is going on and it's so close to home and we have to acknowledge our privilege and acknowledge the situation, which is we have agency, we have agency to lobby our government to change this and to stop these criminal acts.

Speaker 3:          01:58:08       But do you ever feel that it's almost like you're absorbing too much because you are looking at all the problems of all the people, seven plus billion around the world and all these different horrific injustices.

Speaker 4:          01:58:22       I try to focus on what I can do and what I can do is, is challenge my own government and you know, as an American citizen living in this society, I think that the US empire in the Pentagon is the source of a lot of problems around the world. I look at the world as complex. I mean you have to understand the issues are going on, especially

Speaker 2:          01:58:42       with foreign policy in terms of the colonized and colonizers, the oppressed and oppressors and the US, his role as well as other previous empires role in shaping the world as it is today. And a lot of the problems that have arisen are because directly us foreign policy, whether it be the global war on terrorism, whether it be terrorism in general, I mean that, you know, drone strikes basically caused terrorism, whether it be the environmental crises, the Pentagon is actually the largest polluter in the world, more than 140 countries. That's essentially every country in the world almost, um, a bigger polluter than the top four chemical companies combined. So it all kind of stems back from this notion that, you know, the u s is the world's largest empire that's ever existed and it needs to be stopped to save humanity. And so as an American citizen, I look at all of the problems that I understand that there is like a very common route and I can do something about this common root.

Speaker 2:          01:59:37       And if you're looking at domestic problems, the lack of healthcare, the lack of education, I mean, Martin Luther King called it decades ago. He says, uh, you know, a mill, a nation that spends more and more on military spending is facing social death. I probably butchered his quote, but that's essentially the spiritual death. I think he is what he said. But I mean that's exactly what's happening is when we're squandering all of our money, bolstering up this huge global empire, we're not taking care of our people at home are brothers and sisters at home. My empathy extends as an internationalist all around the world. I, I, you know, I feel for my brothers and sisters in Palestine, Yemen, everywhere. But I can only do what I can do based on what my government is doing and, and you know, it's doing a lot. It's doing a lot of horrible things and it's time for us to really acknowledge what those horrible things are because we need to reinvigorate an antiwar movement in this country.

Speaker 3:          02:00:30       And when you're saying that drone strikes create terrorism, what you're really saying is that, well, what people, if they don't understand drone strikes primarily kill civilians, right? 98% yeah. It's a, it's a really crazy number and it's this very strange, sanitized way of handling an issue where if you had a person and you had some Rambo character, you send them overseas, you said, hey, I want you to go get this isis terrorist. And uh, in the process, kill everybody. The fuck that you see everybody that's in front of them, that person would be a war criminal. All right? If you had a guy, and he knew that some isis guy was in a, an apartment building, so he just started gunning down men, women, and children in that apartment building until he got to the terrorist, that guy would go to jail. But if you do it with a remote control and you launch how fire missiles out of a drone and it blows up the apartment building and kills all these innocent people, but also gets the terrorist, it's mission accomplished. And it's crazy. It's crazy that we're signing off on that, right? And what gives us the right, it's to kill people. It's, it's a thing

Speaker 1:          02:01:40       because we're not there. Where there's this weird sort of, uh, uh, just, uh, there's a bridge that we're allowed to cross into this really sickening act. It's a very, when you have anything that's ineffective to the point where most of the people, it kills our good people, or at least are innocent people should say. That's crazy. I mean, this is not saying that there's not terrorism. It's not saying there's not horrible people in Iceland is absolutely right. The it, look, I'm a pro military person. I think we need military and I think just like the same I need, we need cops. But to deny that cops sometimes are bad is fucking crazy. To not deny that. Sometimes when you allow the military industrial complex to do things like have drones that launch missiles into wedding parties because you think one of the people might be a terrorist and are often incorrect, often to the tune of 90 plus percent.

Speaker 1:          02:02:37       Yeah. It's crazy. Yeah. And you look at, you know, the last 10 years, you look at some of these terrorists who have conducted terrorist acts. You look at actually what their intention was in a lot of them, the vast majority of literally cite us foreign policy, revenge, US foreign policy. I mean, every time you kill 98% innocent people, whoever survives, if you lost your whole family and that you have an incredible amount of motivation to get back at whoever did it right and that whoever did it is the United States. We need to stop normalizing this. And um, you know, militarily speaking, Trump actually, you know, it's not just Trump. I mean this is a bipartisan effort throughout the entire Congress. If there's one thing congress can agree upon, it's to make nonviolent bds efforts against Israel legal and also to just keep ramping up the military and ageing on whoever is sitting in the Oval Office to be more militaristic.

Speaker 1:          02:03:32       And that's exactly what's happened with Trump. Um, in a bizarre way. I mean, Congress approved to like a seven, uh, near trillion dollar defense budget and the increase alone in the last year was basically Russia's entire military budget more than Russia's entire military budget. That's how much this shit's ramping up. And then you have the space for us. I mean it's just like how far is this going to go? This society is collapsing. If you looked at the argument against this, you would say, we need this in order to keep people safe here. That would be the argument against it. I, my question would be what are we, what threat is there isis? When has isis ever done anything here other than, I mean there was like a truck. I mean, come on. We already know the statistics on terrorism in this country and they're are very low, right? I mean you're, you're basically more likely to die from like furniture falling on you or sharp Harmon. Yeah, yeah, and the whole isis thing. I mean, as we know, isis of rose out of us foreign policy, the failed and Libya,

Speaker 4:          02:04:38       the Iraq war, that's still criminally ongoing. I mean, Trump announced this indefinite extension of the criminal occupation of Iraq. It's just crazy how normalize this is, you know, far longer than Vietnam were in Afghanistan. Fatalities that aren't all time high. All of these things are a direct result of US foreign policy. And look at the refugee crisis, look at immigration, the Honduras cool, all of this shits connected and that's what we need to start like expanding our consciousness and our empathy worldwide to understand all of these things are linked and the struggle is all linked and our world is shrinking really rapidly. What candidate speaks in this way? What, what candidate do you think understands and recognizes all these things that you're talking about? I mean, micro vel is the only one who's like, we need to end the u s empire Bernie and see Mike Ravel was uh, he was the guy who basically read the Pentagon papers and do record.

Speaker 4:          02:05:34       He, he's, he's a good guy. He has, yeah, he has like this online campaign that's really awesome. But I mean Tulsi is speaking a lot about regime change wars, which is extremely important, but she still believes in drone strikes. She basically has a little bit of Obama's foreign policy that I don't agree with that fundamental understanding, limited drone strikes. Like maybe if there's an isis camp somewhere. I mean, I can't believe that she believes in some sort of a just broad brush use of it. I haven't looked into the nuances of that, but I do think that, um, no one is saying what I want them to about us empire, about, you know, scaling back the US empire and stopping all of this civil society movements because it's not just about invasions anymore. It's about, you know, you surfing the democratic processes of all of these countries like what we've done in Venezuela, what we're doing all around the world to try to foment unrest.

Speaker 4:          02:06:30       Um, all of this needs to be stopped. Do you foresee a time where our dependence on foreign oil is radically reduced to the point where it doesn't justify these regime change wars in our dependence on these resources that these people have? I mean, this is almost every conflict in the world. You can boil down to the acquisition of resources and also the protection of capital and that's like what a lot is. What a lot of it is now is actually just capital interests needing to expand and grow and continuing to up increase the profit structure of these corporations. And that's exactly why we've seen imperialism, you know, kind of go out of control and the way that it has, I don't know. I mean I thought that we were more independent oil wise. I don't think it's good. I think that climate change, yeah, I think that, and it hasn't stopped, you know, it hasn't stopped the imperialist, um, misadventures of the u s government. So I think there just needs to be a really big shift in consciousness and people to stop thinking that it's our right and that we have, you know, the right and the duty to do this around the world. It doesn't give us the right, we don't have, it's not right, man. It's really not. And, uh, we need to really reinvigorate the masses here because again, I'm, society is collapsing. That's pretty fucking obvious.

Speaker 3:          02:07:53       Well, if it is, if it's not obvious, what is obvious is that we're not evolving, right? In terms of if we're still involved in drone strikes that kill 98% of people, if we're still involved in regime change. Wars were still involved in these unnecessary military actions against Iran. It's these things that people freaking out about. This is all the same kind of shit that people have been fighting against forever. That we don't want our brothers and sisters and husbands and wives to die for nonsense. We don't want them to die for some people that live in these air conditioned rooms that are making billions of dollars that are profiting off of the actions of these, these noble people who think that they're doing it to protect America. I mean this is the narrative that they're being served. This is what they're being told and when they're going to these places, then are going to those places to act as evil as, as, as the, the, the boots of some empire. They're going over there because they think they're protecting freedom. They think to protect them, their family and their loved ones back home. That's why they're doing it. If we're still doing that, we're not evolving.

Speaker 4:          02:09:04       Well, I mean, I, that's what's so scary about the Iran thing because the people who are surrounded in Iran and being directed to go out there, they're the ones who are going to be the sacrificial. Exactly. For these defense contractors. And I don't think that you can argue any more that this is for freedom. I mean, how can you, what threat does he Ron pose to the top cellmates

Speaker 3:          02:09:24       so a tough sell. I don't, I don't understand what threat they serve either. And what, what benefit would it be for them to start some shit with us and is that is the craziest idea ever. I mean, it's like my, you know, a nine year old kid trying to pick a fight with Mike Tyson.

Speaker 4:          02:09:38       It's fucking crazy. It doesn't make any sense. Like what are you trying to do? Trying to get killed? I mean inevitably we're trying to get to the global confrontation with China and Russia, I guess. I mean that's, it's scary to think that we only have a couple independent states left to knock down to be under complete subjugation from the u s military in global capitalism. It's pretty nuts.

Speaker 3:          02:10:00       Well, not only that, even if we do move into some sort of a, some sort of a situation where we're in control, then we're a bigger target. And with the amount of nuclear weapons that are possessed by these countries that were, I mean, just what North Korea has just this one small fucked up country could ruin life on earth. Just this one country and forget about Russia. We could literally annihilate each other. Right? That's right. That's a possibility. Right? I mean, if, if someone chose to launch an attack, if they decided that they have the justification to launch an attack and then all of a sudden we're in a real war. Yeah, like a fucking war war.

Speaker 7:          02:10:49       We're invading us. Shit's getting knocked down.

Speaker 3:          02:10:52       Buildings and bombs blow up. I mean, over what? This can't be avoided. This is the only way. The only way his missiles and bombs,

Speaker 4:          02:11:02       like you said, we're not evolving or devolving. I mean it's, it's unbelievable. We have the capacity to provide for everyone. We have the capacity to cooperate, to innovate, and we're stuck. We're stuck dehumanizing the other. We're stuck with this mass conditioning to basically perpetuate these, these injustices and a, it's really a shame. I mean, we have all the information at our fingertips, but we still keep reverting back to what's the myths? These myths that underpin our society. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:11:32       These conversations I have with you are so depressing because it's always, I always leave going, what,

Speaker 7:          02:11:37       Huh?

Speaker 3:          02:11:38       What can be done? What can we do? What at? Where does it end? Where does it go? You know, these are, these are the big questions. And then also the, what we discussed before, it's impossible for anyone to really have a deep nuanced understanding of all these different issues.

Speaker 4:          02:11:56       Right? Right. I mean, I think focusing on what you can do, we can only do what we can do, right? And you have to understand that, you know, you can't get debilitated or disillusion with, you know, the, the influx of information or just the complete, you know, the heaviness of it all. You just have to do what you can do. You're doing what you can do. You have me on to, to help spread awareness about these issues. And that's when you will freak out

Speaker 7:          02:12:21       and you're about to, you're about to get spammed with a lot of Hasbro and they don't have my real email. Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:12:27       But that's, that's what we can do, Joe. And, and you just have to live your life and provide for your kids and love what you have and, but also just understand your place, you know, and, and just extend the empathy that you can and just, yeah, I mean it's, it's hard because I don't have the answer. All I know is what's needed and what's needed is we need a movement of the masses. It's not going to come from the top down. Um, it's going to come from a grassroots, mobilized effort to try to change these policies. That's the only way things have ever changed in the past. And I absolutely have hope and optimism that we're going to change things and that we're going to correct this horrible path that we're on.

Speaker 3:          02:13:06       Do you think that the 2020 elections can have a real significant impact of any of this? Do you think that whoever gets into office can really have an effect on the kinds of policies that we're talking about with the kind of influence of the military industrial complex, of all these lobbyists of Wall Street, off of all, all these like ma monstrous machines that just pure good fashioned democracy can actually step in and turn the ship away from the rocks.

Speaker 4:          02:13:38       Bernie, I really do think that he's one of our last chances, not because I think that he's going to completely do some revolutionary upheaval from the top down. As we know, Congress is stocked with a lot of terrible people who will block a lot of these efforts, but I think that, um, he's going to mobilize the masses and reinvigorate the labor movement and reinvigorate unions and help workers understand that they need to fight for these rights that had been eviscerated, you know, over the last hundred years. One thing that does inspire me as well as seeing people like Elon, Omar, you know, she is incredible. She's a Somali refugee. She advocates bds against Israel and she does not fucking back down. I love that woman. What an incredible woman. She got visceral, viciously attacked for re-tweeting, um, one of my episodes from empire files. And I think it just shows how scared people are of, of her and her ideas. And you saw how hard everyone came down on her for just saying that Israel has an influential lobby in DC.

Speaker 3:          02:14:35       Yeah, well the, she's also wearing religious garbs that people are scared of that. Right. Right away the job. And then, um, there was something, some hit piece on her yesterday. They're saying they think she married a brother. Oh, that's ridiculous. Yeah. They think ridiculous to get into this country that she had a, a religious marriage, but then she had another, yeah. I don't know.

Speaker 4:          02:14:56       She's the only one in Congress other than [inaudible] and of course AOC and um, you know, some other very few people, but she's out there every day speaking against the military industrial complex, speaking against the wars. I think as a refugee, she understands the effects of US policy. And I'm really excited that she has a voice in there. But again, I don't think that the hope is going to come from within Congress and the system is way too far gone. But the electoral college and the gerrymandering and the voter rights, you know, that had been rescinded. Its, it's a lot and it's an uphill battle. But that's why someone like Bernie, I think we'll turn to the people and say I can't do this alone. You have to come out and get my back and we have to have millions of people in the streets demanding these things. That's the only way it's going to work.
