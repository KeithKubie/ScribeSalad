Hey entomological magnetometers, Matt here
for a DNews Short.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.440
A new study was released in February of 2017,
where researchers magnetized dead and living

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.440
cockroaches.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.850
They exposed the cockroaches to a magnetic
field about 100 times stronger than a fridge

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:23.170
magnet (1.5 kiloGauss, for you EM nerds out
there), for 20 minutes.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:27.670
Afterward, they checked to see how long the
insects remained magnetized: 50 hours for

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.789
dead cockroaches, but only 50 minutes for
living ones!

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.790
As it turns out: cockroaches, like birds,
bees, dolphins and a host of other animals

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.800
and bacteria can detect Earth’s magnetic
field.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.250
We know this because researchers have tested
cockroaches in rotating magnetic fields, and

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.000
used radio waves to successfully block possible
magnetoreception -- their sense of Earth’s

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.070
magnetic field.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.739
Nature evolved a number of ways for animals
to sense the magnetic fields.

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.710
Some animals, like honey bees, have little
granules of iron in their abdomen -- they

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.800
literally have a gut feeling about where to
go!

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.920
Whereas others, like sharks and some birds,
have what’s called radical-pair sensors,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.460
essentially a chemical reaction creates a
charged molecule that acts like a compass.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.189
The researchers who did this experiment, think,
because the decay of the magnetic field happened

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.490
so much faster for the living cockroaches,
they must be using a living chemical reaction

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.719
to keep the magnetoreception going, i.e. they
have a radical-pair sense.

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:24.289
A better understanding of how this system
works could teach us about other animals that

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:28.409
are more difficult to get into a lab like
sharks, birds or even people!

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.930
That’s right, humans might have this sense
too, but researchers couldn’t get repeatability

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.070
in their experiments -- yet.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.759
In the end, if we can figure out this roach
magnetoreception, it could help engineers

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.729
design better micro-robots, and sensors!

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.310
All thanks to our little friend, the cockroach.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.429
But like, I know they’re cool and weird
and stuff… but why do cockroaches even exist?

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:48.770
What are they for?

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:49.770
What do they do?!

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.810
Find out in this video.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.130
Do you have the best sense of direction?

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.130
Or none at all?

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.299
