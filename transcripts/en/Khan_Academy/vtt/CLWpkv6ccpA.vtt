00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.660
 

00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:04.580
Let's say that I've
got 2 Chuck Norrises,

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.640
or maybe it's Chuck Norri.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.090
And to that I am going to
add another 3 Chuck Norrises.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.130
So I'm going to add
another 3 Chuck Norrises.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:16.990
And this might seem
a little bit obvious,

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.160
but how many Chuck
Norrises do I now have?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.940
Well, 2 Chuck Norrises,
we can represent this

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.610
as literally a Chuck
Norris plus a Chuck Norris.

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.280
So let me do that,
a Chuck Norris

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:31.600
plus another Chuck
Norris, 2 Chuck Norrises.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.610
You could also do this
2 times Chuck Norris,

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.770
and this is just another
way of representing it.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.900
And 3 Chuck Norrises-- you
could do that as a Chuck Norris

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.290
plus a Chuck Norris plus
another Chuck Norris.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.300
And so we would
have a grand total--

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.000
and this might be
very simple for you.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.660
But you would have a
grand total of 1, 2, 3, 4,

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.450
5 Chuck Norrises.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.582
So this would be equal
to 5 Chuck Norrises.

00:01:00.582 --> 00:01:02.540
Now, let's get a little
bit more abstract here.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.209
Chuck Norris is a
very tangible thing.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:07.330
So let's go to a
little bit more of

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.380
traditional algebraic notation.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.720
If I have 2x's and
remember, you could

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.260
do this as 2x's or 2 times x.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.370
 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.220
And to that, I would add
3x's How many x's do I have?

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.450
Well, once again,
2x's, that's 2 times x.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.410
You could do that
as an x plus an x.

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:29.270
We don't know what
the value of x is.

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.460
But whatever that value is,
we can add it to itself.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.780
And then 3x's are they're
going to be that value.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.590
Let me do that in
that same green color.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.640
3x's are going to be that
value plus that value plus

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.460
whatever that value is.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.300
And so how many
x's do I now have?

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.810
Well, I'm going to
have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 x's.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.119
So 2x plus 3x is equal to 5x.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.660
And if you think about it, all
we really did-- and hopefully,

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.160
you conceptually
get it-- is we just

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.950
added the 2 numbers that
were multiplying the x.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.350
And these numbers, the 2 or the
3, they're called coefficients.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.860
Very fancy word, but it's
just this constant number,

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.980
this regular number that's
multiplied by the variable.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.814
You just added the 2 and
the 3, to get your 5x.

00:02:16.814 --> 00:02:18.730
Now, let's think about
this a little bit more.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.400
Let's go back to this original
expression, the 2 Chuck

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.400
Norrises plus 3 Chuck Norrises.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.380
Let's say, to that,
we were to add

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.680
to some type of a-- let's we
were to add 7 plums over here.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.050
So this is my drawing of a plum.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.410
So we have 7 plums plus 2 Chuck
Norrises plus 3 Chuck Norrises.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:41.040
And let's say that I
add another 2 plums.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.950
I add another 2 plums here.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.990
So what this whole thing be?

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.170
Well, I wouldn't add the 7
to the 2 to the 3 plus the 2.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.750
We're adding
different things here.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.950
You have 2 Chuck Norrises
and 3 Chuck Norrises,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.895
so they're still going to
simplify to 5 Chuck Norrises. .

00:02:54.895 --> 00:02:57.020
And then we would separately
think about the plums.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.700
We have 7 plums, and we're
adding another 2 plums.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.820
We're going to have 9 plums.

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:06.920
Plus 9 plums, so this simplifies
to five Chuck Norrises and 9

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.810
plums.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.360
Similarly, over here,
instead of just 2x plus 3x,

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:21.970
if I had 7y plus 2x plus 3x
plus 2y, what do I now have?

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.050
Well, I can't add the
x's and the y's.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:26.420
They could very well
represent a different number.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.590
So all I can do is
really add the x's.

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:30.022
And then I get the 5x.

00:03:30.022 --> 00:03:31.480
And then, I'd
separately add the y.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.800
If I have 7y's and to that I add
2y's, I'm going to have 9y's.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.170
If I have 7 of something
and I add 2 of something,

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.440
I now have 9 of that something.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.710
So I'm going to have 9y's.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.235
So you add that.

00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:45.740
Do that in a different color.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:48.700
You add this and this.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.140
You get that.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.070
You add the x's.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.064
You get that right over there.

00:03:56.064 --> 00:03:57.730
So hopefully, that
makes a little sense.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:59.313
Actually I'll throw
out one more idea.

00:03:59.313 --> 00:04:04.530
So given this, what would happen
if I were to have 2x plus 1

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:08.407
plus 7x plus 5?

00:04:08.407 --> 00:04:09.990
Well, once again,
you might be tempted

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.350
to add the 2 plus
the 1, but they're

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:12.220
adding different things.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.970
These are 2x's.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:14.910
This is just the number 1.

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.490
So you really just have
to add the x's together.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.430
So you're going to
say, well, I got 2x's.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.550
And I'm going to
add 7x's to that.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:23.507
Well, that means
I now have 9x's.

00:04:23.507 --> 00:04:25.090
And then, separately,
you'd say, well,

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.130
I've got just the
abstract number 1.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.460
And then I've got another 5.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.280
1 plus 5 is going
to be equal to 6.
