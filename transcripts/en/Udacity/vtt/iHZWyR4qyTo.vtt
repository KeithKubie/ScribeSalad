00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So now let's talk about the 1988 Internet worm.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
There are several interesting things about this Internet worm.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Probably the main one is that it was one of the first worms

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that actually got widespread attention.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It got this attention for good reason.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
If you remember 1988, the Internet was not particularly well known to the general public,

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and it had a relatively small number of users.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
And even so, this worm infected an estimated 6,000 machines.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And while this is a really tiny number compared to a modern worm

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
or a modern botnet or something like this,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
this was a substantial fraction of the number of machines connected to the Internet at the time.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The way this worm spread is it used computers' Internet connections

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
to exploit known vulnerabilities in the UNIX hosts of the time.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Of course, at the time, the existence of a remotely exploitable bug

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
wasn't considered nearly as serious as it would be considered today

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
because, of course, the 1988 worm and all of the subsequent ones hadn't happened yet.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
One of these bugs was a buffer overflow exploit in the finger daemon,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and this was a service that would run on UNIX machines of the time,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and the finger daemon would let you query a remote machine

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
to learn about whether a user was logged in to that machine and some other stuff.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
And so now let's ask the question, would random testing have changed the outcome?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Well, it seems extremely likely not because these bugs were known at the time.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
On the other hand, let's ask a little bit different question.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Could this bug in finger daemon and lots of other bugs like it

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
have been found by random testing?

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And the answer to the question is probably yes.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
In fact, if we go back to the original fuzzing paper,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
one of the bugs that was found was caused by the same programming practice

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
that provided one of the security holes to the Internet worm.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
So basically, even in its original fairly weak form

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
where fuzzing was done with completely random data,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
it was finding the kind of bugs that were causing security holes.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This remains true to this day, but fuzzers are used to find a lot of exploitable vulnerabilities

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
in hosts that have Internet-facing services.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So in summary, it could have found the kind of bugs that the worm exploited

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and others like it had people been running fuzzers a couple of years earlier.
