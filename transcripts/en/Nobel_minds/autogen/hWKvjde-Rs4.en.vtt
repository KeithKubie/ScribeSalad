tend to give students the idea that we
 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.979
tend to give students the idea that we
may about ninety-five percent of what we

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
may about ninety-five percent of what we
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.689
may about ninety-five percent of what we
need to know because we don't talk

need to know because we don't talk
 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.809
need to know because we don't talk
enough about what we don't know but in

enough about what we don't know but in
 

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:53.569
enough about what we don't know but in
fact we're here to assure especially the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579
fact we're here to assure especially the
 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.049

five percent of what we need to know
 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:05.780
five percent of what we need to know
about ninety-five percent and these two

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790
about ninety-five percent and these two
 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.899
about ninety-five percent and these two
kinds will first of all talk about

for coming now um you know there's been
 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.050
for coming now um you know there's been
a lot of talk today about the genomics

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
a lot of talk today about the genomics
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.280
a lot of talk today about the genomics
revolution and it really is a truly

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:53.290
revolution and it really is a truly
 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.040
revolution and it really is a truly
exciting revolution in science that's

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.050
exciting revolution in science that's
 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.740
exciting revolution in science that's
going on right now in fact it is so

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750
going on right now in fact it is so
 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.590
going on right now in fact it is so
incredible that I have to use a

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600
incredible that I have to use a
 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.639
incredible that I have to use a
soundtrack for my first slide and it's

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649
soundtrack for my first slide and it's
 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:12.300
soundtrack for my first slide and it's
actually they're going to be some words

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310
actually they're going to be some words
 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.449
actually they're going to be some words
in English coming across the screen that

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459
in English coming across the screen that
 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.310
in English coming across the screen that
send a little bit of message that go

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320
send a little bit of message that go
 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.850
send a little bit of message that go
along with these children of tomorrow

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860
along with these children of tomorrow
 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.190
along with these children of tomorrow
that you'll see developing in the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200
that you'll see developing in the
 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.100
that you'll see developing in the
background I'm going to have to ask for

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110
background I'm going to have to ask for
 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.780
background I'm going to have to ask for
the lights to be dimmed the will I think

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790
the lights to be dimmed the will I think
 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.000
the lights to be dimmed the will I think
for this in order for you to be able to

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010
for this in order for you to be able to
 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.820
for this in order for you to be able to
see the slides but here goes it's going

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830
see the slides but here goes it's going
 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:03:33.350
see the slides but here goes it's going
to speak for itself

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360
 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.150
Oh

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160
 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.240
okay so those are the children of

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250
okay so those are the children of
 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.810
okay so those are the children of
tomorrow little lab embryos developing

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820
tomorrow little lab embryos developing
 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.260
tomorrow little lab embryos developing
and as you are watching them what you

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:50.270
and as you are watching them what you
 

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:52.900
and as you are watching them what you
saw in green was a jellyfish protein

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:52.910
saw in green was a jellyfish protein
 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.210
saw in green was a jellyfish protein
that they're expressing at all the tight

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220
that they're expressing at all the tight
 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.280
that they're expressing at all the tight
junctions of their hypodermis cells so

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290
junctions of their hypodermis cells so
 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.710
junctions of their hypodermis cells so
you can actually watch the developmental

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720
you can actually watch the developmental
 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.950
you can actually watch the developmental
program unfold inside of these embryos a

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:02.960
program unfold inside of these embryos a
 

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.280
program unfold inside of these embryos a
process that goes on in the soil all

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290
process that goes on in the soil all
 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.010
process that goes on in the soil all
over this world and a process that has

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:09.020
over this world and a process that has
 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.640
over this world and a process that has
been going on unbroken through time for

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650
been going on unbroken through time for
 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.530
been going on unbroken through time for
billions of years because as that slide

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540
billions of years because as that slide
 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.240
billions of years because as that slide
said the every organism will alive today

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:19.250
said the every organism will alive today
 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.810
said the every organism will alive today
including you and me are related to to

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820
including you and me are related to to
 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.110
including you and me are related to to
each other those worms are related to an

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120
each other those worms are related to an
 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.450
each other those worms are related to an
ancestral organism that shared its

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460
ancestral organism that shared its
 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:31.270
ancestral organism that shared its
ancestry with humans and of course

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280
ancestry with humans and of course
 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.210
ancestry with humans and of course
you're the second speaker today is going

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:34.220
you're the second speaker today is going
 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:37.150
you're the second speaker today is going
to talk about human evolution a little

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.160
to talk about human evolution a little
 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:40.540
to talk about human evolution a little
bit more specifically but when you think

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550
bit more specifically but when you think
 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.830
bit more specifically but when you think
about human evolution you're often

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840
about human evolution you're often
 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.100
about human evolution you're often
thinking about chimpanzees and maybe

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110
thinking about chimpanzees and maybe
 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.830
thinking about chimpanzees and maybe
Neanderthals and then humans in fact I'm

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840
Neanderthals and then humans in fact I'm
 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.920
Neanderthals and then humans in fact I'm
my task is to give you a little bit of a

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930
my task is to give you a little bit of a
 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.080
my task is to give you a little bit of a
an overview of the other ninety-nine

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090
an overview of the other ninety-nine
 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:56.350
an overview of the other ninety-nine
point nine percent of evolution and so

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360
point nine percent of evolution and so
 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:57.610
point nine percent of evolution and so
I'm going to do that in a few slides

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620
I'm going to do that in a few slides
 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:00.400
I'm going to do that in a few slides
just to make you keep in mind that we

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410
just to make you keep in mind that we
 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.920
just to make you keep in mind that we
are very closely related to worms and

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930
are very closely related to worms and
 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.280
are very closely related to worms and
indeed as Nietzsche said much of what is

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:06.290
indeed as Nietzsche said much of what is
 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:10.900
indeed as Nietzsche said much of what is
in you is still worm so the two themes

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910
in you is still worm so the two themes
 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.770
in you is still worm so the two themes
that Bruce mentioned a moment ago where

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:14.780
that Bruce mentioned a moment ago where
 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.440
that Bruce mentioned a moment ago where
have we been and where are we going and

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450
have we been and where are we going and
 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.630
have we been and where are we going and
then the great deal we don't know and

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640
then the great deal we don't know and
 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.530
then the great deal we don't know and
how to discover it and here in this

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540
how to discover it and here in this
 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:28.360
how to discover it and here in this
first slide is a beautiful picture of a

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:28.370
first slide is a beautiful picture of a
 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.190
first slide is a beautiful picture of a
C elegans ovary producing embryos and

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:33.200
C elegans ovary producing embryos and
 

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.710
C elegans ovary producing embryos and
you can see on the top several of these

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720
you can see on the top several of these
 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.840
you can see on the top several of these
nuclei with their little orange spheres

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:39.850
nuclei with their little orange spheres
 

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:43.000
nuclei with their little orange spheres
surrounding them those are germ granules

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.010
surrounding them those are germ granules
 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:46.270
surrounding them those are germ granules
inside the dark circles that's where the

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280
inside the dark circles that's where the
 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.590
inside the dark circles that's where the
DNA is that's the genome

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600
DNA is that's the genome
 

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.690
DNA is that's the genome
and in these little circles around the

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:50.700
and in these little circles around the
 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.020

remember is there is there and they
 

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.890
remember is there is there and they
clearly do but in this case I mean can

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:39.900
clearly do but in this case I mean can
 

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.900

and then take that acquired information

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:44.880
and then take that acquired information
 

00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:48.410
and then take that acquired information
and pass it on to their progeny and in

00:14:48.410 --> 00:14:48.420
and pass it on to their progeny and in
 

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:51.080

take up too much time but we actually

00:25:13.930 --> 00:25:13.940
take up too much time but we actually

one of two states when it's introduced
 

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.320
one of two states when it's introduced
into the cell so we call this putting a

00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:29.330
into the cell so we call this putting a
 

00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:32.170
into the cell so we call this putting a
transgene in on the left-hand side you

00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:32.180
transgene in on the left-hand side you
 

00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:34.030
transgene in on the left-hand side you
have a transgene that's turned off and

00:25:34.030 --> 00:25:34.040
have a transgene that's turned off and
 

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.010
have a transgene that's turned off and
on the right-hand side you have a new

00:25:36.010 --> 00:25:36.020
on the right-hand side you have a new
 

00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:39.580
on the right-hand side you have a new
transgene that's turned on and the

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:39.590
transgene that's turned on and the
 

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:41.110

interesting thing is that they interact

00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120
interesting thing is that they interact
 

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.320
interesting thing is that they interact
with each other so the silent allele can

00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:44.330
with each other so the silent allele can
 

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:47.470
with each other so the silent allele can
actually send an RNA signal that turns

00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480
actually send an RNA signal that turns
 

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.500
actually send an RNA signal that turns
off the active allele inducing an

00:25:50.500 --> 00:25:50.510
off the active allele inducing an
 

00:25:50.510 --> 00:25:52.900
off the active allele inducing an
epigenetic silent state that is

00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:52.910
epigenetic silent state that is
 

00:25:52.910 --> 00:25:56.250
epigenetic silent state that is
maintained permanently in the animal

00:25:56.250 --> 00:25:56.260
maintained permanently in the animal
 

00:25:56.260 --> 00:26:00.520
maintained permanently in the animal
interestingly there's also an activating

00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:00.530
interestingly there's also an activating
 

00:26:00.530 --> 00:26:04.680
interestingly there's also an activating
signal the active allele can transmit an

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:04.690
signal the active allele can transmit an
 

00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.920
signal the active allele can transmit an
activating signal after enough in this

00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:08.930
activating signal after enough in this
 

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:11.950
activating signal after enough in this
again is still not proven but we believe

00:26:11.950 --> 00:26:11.960
again is still not proven but we believe
 

00:26:11.960 --> 00:26:15.880
again is still not proven but we believe
that this licensing state becomes fully

00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:15.890
that this licensing state becomes fully
 

00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:18.370
that this licensing state becomes fully
licensed over time once a gene is fully

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:18.380
licensed over time once a gene is fully
 

00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.500
licensed over time once a gene is fully
licensed for expression in the animal it

00:26:20.500 --> 00:26:20.510
licensed for expression in the animal it
 

00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:23.230
licensed for expression in the animal it
can trans activate a silent allele so

00:26:23.230 --> 00:26:23.240
can trans activate a silent allele so
 

00:26:23.240 --> 00:26:25.690
can trans activate a silent allele so
initially silencing is dominant you get

00:26:25.690 --> 00:26:25.700
initially silencing is dominant you get
 

00:26:25.700 --> 00:26:28.720
initially silencing is dominant you get
dominant silencing eventually activation

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:28.730
dominant silencing eventually activation
 

00:26:28.730 --> 00:26:31.120

so we take the variation in Africa and

so we take the variation in Africa and

get an approximately date on that by
 

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:51.090
get an approximately date on that by

Europeans that look almost identical to
 

00:37:09.609 --> 00:37:12.960
Europeans that look almost identical to
Neanderthals for a segment here so there

00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:12.970
Neanderthals for a segment here so there
 

00:37:12.970 --> 00:37:15.630
Neanderthals for a segment here so there
are so chunks of DNA that we can find in

00:37:15.630 --> 00:37:15.640
are so chunks of DNA that we can find in
 

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:17.549
are so chunks of DNA that we can find in
two three percent of people in this room

00:37:17.549 --> 00:37:17.559
two three percent of people in this room
 

00:37:17.559 --> 00:37:20.039

that are almost identical to Neanderthal
 

00:37:20.049 --> 00:37:23.339
that are almost identical to Neanderthal
and what then becomes very interesting

00:37:23.339 --> 00:37:23.349
and what then becomes very interesting
 

00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:25.230
and what then becomes very interesting
is of course to ask the question well

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:25.240
is of course to ask the question well

is of course to ask the question well
what does that mean does that mean

00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:27.010
what does that mean does that mean
 

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:30.420
what does that mean does that mean
anything for our phenotype as we would

this at the very end but before that I

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:13.290
this at the very end but before that I
 

00:38:13.290 --> 00:38:14.960
this at the very end but before that I
just want to mention that there is an

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:14.970
just want to mention that there is an
 

00:38:14.970 --> 00:38:18.200
just want to mention that there is an
other aspect of this work that I find

00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:18.210
other aspect of this work that I find
 

00:38:18.210 --> 00:38:20.720
other aspect of this work that I find
really interesting and that is that here

00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:20.730
really interesting and that is that here
 

00:38:20.730 --> 00:38:22.490
really interesting and that is that here
we have the human genome in a complete

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:22.500
we have the human genome in a complete
 

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.040
we have the human genome in a complete
form not just a part like that we can

00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:25.050
form not just a part like that we can
 

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.100
form not just a part like that we can
compare it to the great apes but now we

00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:28.110
compare it to the great apes but now we
 

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:31.040
compare it to the great apes but now we
then have the genome of our very closest

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:31.050
then have the genome of our very closest
 

00:38:31.050 --> 00:38:34.730
then have the genome of our very closest
relative the neanderthals so we're not

00:38:34.730 --> 00:38:34.740
relative the neanderthals so we're not
 

00:38:34.740 --> 00:38:37.220
relative the neanderthals so we're not
let any more comparing our lineage back

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:47.820
years in human history and look on
 

00:38:47.820 --> 00:38:49.700
years in human history and look on
everything that happened in our last

00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:49.710
everything that happened in our last
 

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:53.180
everything that happened in our last
segment of our history and why is that

00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:53.190
segment of our history and why is that
 

00:38:53.190 --> 00:38:56.630
segment of our history and why is that
particularly interesting when I think

00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640
particularly interesting when I think
 

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:58.490
particularly interesting when I think
it's interesting because it happened a

00:38:58.490 --> 00:38:58.500
it's interesting because it happened a
 

00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.560
it's interesting because it happened a
lot of things in human history in this

00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:00.570
lot of things in human history in this
 

00:39:00.570 --> 00:39:02.960
lot of things in human history in this
last part that has a big consequence for

last part that has a big consequence for
 

00:39:02.970 --> 00:39:05.650
last part that has a big consequence for
our history of course but it's not only

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:05.660
our history of course but it's not only
 

00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:07.730
our history of course but it's not only
self-interest because much of what

00:39:07.730 --> 00:39:07.740
self-interest because much of what
 

00:39:07.740 --> 00:39:10.550
self-interest because much of what
happened to us have now consequences for

00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560

Neanderthals lived from four three four
 

00:39:20.850 --> 00:39:22.610
Neanderthals lived from four three four
hundred thousand years and made pretty

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:22.620
hundred thousand years and made pretty
 

00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:24.410
hundred thousand years and made pretty
much the same stone tools at the

in something that
changed in our biology in this last

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:17.260

on the planet we share these changes but
the Neanderthals look like the Apes and

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:32.650
the Neanderthals look like the Apes and
 

00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:35.700
the Neanderthals look like the Apes and
the monkeys and since a few months now

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:35.710

also now actually over Neanderthal we
can make this catalog of all these

00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:45.670
can make this catalog of all these
 

00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:49.500
can make this catalog of all these
changes and the fascinating thing is if
