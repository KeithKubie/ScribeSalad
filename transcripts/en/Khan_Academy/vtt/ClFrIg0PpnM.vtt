00:00:00.245 --> 00:00:02.226
- [Voiceover] Okay, so
we are finally ready

00:00:02.226 --> 00:00:04.937
to express the quadratic approximation

00:00:04.937 --> 00:00:07.752
of a multivariable
function in vector form.

00:00:07.752 --> 00:00:09.517
So, I have the whole
thing written out here

00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:12.413
where f is the function that
we are trying to approximate,

00:00:12.413 --> 00:00:14.782
x naught, y naught is the constant point

00:00:14.782 --> 00:00:16.652
about which we are approximating,

00:00:16.652 --> 00:00:18.478
and then this entire expression

00:00:18.478 --> 00:00:20.109
is the quadratic approximation,

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:21.261
which I've talked about in past videos,

00:00:21.261 --> 00:00:23.378
and if it seems very
complicated or absurd,

00:00:23.378 --> 00:00:24.559
or you're unfamiliar with it,

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:26.221
I'm just dissecting it real quick.

00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:27.870
This over here is the Constant term,

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.942
this is just gonna evaluate to a constant,

00:00:29.942 --> 00:00:34.007
everything over here is the Linear term,

00:00:34.007 --> 00:00:35.635
because it just involves taking a variable

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:37.263
multiplied by a constant,

00:00:37.263 --> 00:00:40.774
and then the remainder,
every one of these components

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:42.903
will have two variables
multiplied into it.

00:00:42.903 --> 00:00:45.472
So x squared comes up, and x times y,

00:00:45.472 --> 00:00:49.639
and y squared comes up, so
that's the quadratic term.

00:00:50.582 --> 00:00:51.415
Quadratic.

00:00:53.343 --> 00:00:54.897
Now, to vectorize things, first of all,

00:00:54.897 --> 00:00:57.878
let's write down the input,
the input variable (x,y)

00:00:57.878 --> 00:00:59.815
as a vector, and typically we'll do that

00:00:59.815 --> 00:01:03.094
with a boldfaced x to
indicate that it's a vector,

00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:07.088
and its components are just
gonna be the single variables,

00:01:07.088 --> 00:01:08.928
x and y, the non-boldfaced.

00:01:08.928 --> 00:01:11.750
So this is the vector
representing the variable input,

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.543
and then correspondingly a boldfaced x

00:01:14.543 --> 00:01:17.031
with a little subscript o, x naught,

00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:19.320
is gonna be the constant input,

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.487
the single point in space near
which we are approximating.

00:01:24.471 --> 00:01:25.871
So when we write things like that,

00:01:25.871 --> 00:01:27.455
this Constant term, simply enough,

00:01:27.455 --> 00:01:29.493
is gonna look like
evaluating your function

00:01:29.493 --> 00:01:31.993
at that boldfaced x naught.

00:01:32.987 --> 00:01:35.070
So that's probably the
easiest one to handle.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.075
Now the linear term, this
looks like a dot product,

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:40.757
and if we kind of expand
it out as the dot product,

00:01:40.757 --> 00:01:43.530
it looks like we're taking
the partial derivative

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.957
of f with respect to x,

00:01:44.957 --> 00:01:47.504
and then the partial
derivative with respect to y,

00:01:47.504 --> 00:01:49.325
and we're evaluating both of those

00:01:49.325 --> 00:01:52.325
at that boldfaced x naught input.

00:01:53.652 --> 00:01:55.844
X naught as its input.

00:01:55.844 --> 00:01:57.497
Now, each one of those partial derivatives

00:01:57.497 --> 00:01:59.610
is multiplied by variable
minus constant numbers,

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.049
so this looks like taking the dot product,

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:05.382
here, I'm gonna erase the word "linear".

00:02:07.683 --> 00:02:10.927
We're taking with x minus x naught,

00:02:10.927 --> 00:02:12.677
and y minus y naught.

00:02:14.354 --> 00:02:16.307
This is just expressing
the same linear term,

00:02:16.307 --> 00:02:18.537
but as a dot product,
but the convenience here

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:20.449
is that this is totally the same thing

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:22.782
as saying the gradient of f,

00:02:23.851 --> 00:02:26.392
that's the vector that contains
all the partial derivatives,

00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:30.059
evaluated at the special input, x naught,

00:02:31.402 --> 00:02:33.800
and then we're taking the
dot product between that

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.967
and the variable vector,
boldfaced x, minus x naught.

00:02:40.747 --> 00:02:42.181
Since when you do this component-wise,

00:02:42.181 --> 00:02:44.293
boldfaced x minus x naught,
if we kinda think here,

00:02:44.293 --> 00:02:46.510
it'll be x the variable
minus x naught the constant,

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.583
y the variable minus
y naught the constant,

00:02:48.583 --> 00:02:50.292
which is what we have up there.

00:02:50.292 --> 00:02:53.045
So this expression kind of
vectorizes the whole linear term,

00:02:53.045 --> 00:02:54.966
and now the beef here, the hard part,

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:58.055
how are we gonna vectorize
this quadratic term?

00:02:58.055 --> 00:03:00.324
Now that's what I was leading
to in the last couple videos,

00:03:00.324 --> 00:03:03.071
where I talked about how
you express a quadratic form

00:03:03.071 --> 00:03:06.732
like this with a matrix,
and the way that you do it,

00:03:06.732 --> 00:03:08.416
I'm just kinda scroll
down to give us some room,

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:11.748
the way that you do it
is we'll have a matrix

00:03:11.748 --> 00:03:13.848
whose components are
all of these constants.

00:03:13.848 --> 00:03:16.290
It'll be this 1/2 times the
second partial derivative

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.828
evaluated there, and I'm just
gonna, for convenience's sake,

00:03:18.828 --> 00:03:21.757
I'm gonna just take 1/2 times
the second partial derivative

00:03:21.757 --> 00:03:23.486
with respect to x, and
leave it as understood

00:03:23.486 --> 00:03:25.524
that we're evaluating it at this point.

00:03:25.524 --> 00:03:27.373
And then, on the other diagonal,

00:03:27.373 --> 00:03:30.460
you have 1/2 times the other
kind of partial derivative

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.791
with respect to y two times in a row.

00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:36.782
And then we're gonna multiply
it by this constant here,

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:38.249
but this term kind of gets broken apart

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:39.589
into two different components.

00:03:39.589 --> 00:03:41.276
If you'll remember, in
the quadratic form video,

00:03:41.276 --> 00:03:43.015
it was always things where it was a,

00:03:43.015 --> 00:03:47.350
and then 2b and c, as your
constants for the quadratic form,

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.794
so if we're interpreting
this as two times something,

00:03:49.794 --> 00:03:51.982
then it gets broken down,

00:03:51.982 --> 00:03:54.815
and on one corner shows up as fxy,

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:00.088
and on the other one, kind of 1/2 fxy.

00:04:00.088 --> 00:04:01.832
So both of these together
are gonna constitute

00:04:01.832 --> 00:04:04.832
the entire mixed partial derivative.

00:04:06.192 --> 00:04:08.599
And then the way that we
express the quadratic form

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.824
is we're gonna multiply
this by, well by what?

00:04:11.824 --> 00:04:14.056
Well, the first component
is whatever the thing is

00:04:14.056 --> 00:04:18.813
that's squared here, so it's
gonna be that x minus x naught,

00:04:18.813 --> 00:04:20.024
and then the second component is

00:04:20.024 --> 00:04:22.151
whatever the other thing squared is,

00:04:22.151 --> 00:04:25.401
which in this case is y minus y naught,

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:29.863
and of course we take that same vector

00:04:29.863 --> 00:04:31.391
but we put it in on the other side too.

00:04:31.391 --> 00:04:34.192
So let me make a little bit of room,

00:04:34.192 --> 00:04:36.569
cause this is gonna be wide.

00:04:36.569 --> 00:04:39.019
So we're gonna take that same vector,

00:04:39.019 --> 00:04:40.740
and then kind of put it on its side.

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.594
So it'll be x minus x naught
as the first component,

00:04:44.594 --> 00:04:47.865
and then y minus y naught
as the second component,

00:04:47.865 --> 00:04:50.329
but it's written horizontally, and this,

00:04:50.329 --> 00:04:52.332
if you multiply out the entire matrix,

00:04:52.332 --> 00:04:54.875
is gonna give us the same
expression that you have up here.

00:04:54.875 --> 00:04:56.658
And if that seems
unfamiliar, if that seems,

00:04:56.658 --> 00:04:58.556
you know, how do you
go from there to there,

00:04:58.556 --> 00:05:00.749
check out the video on quadratic forms,

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:02.886
or you can check out the
article where I'm talking

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:05.271
about the quadratic
approximation as a whole,

00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:07.391
I kind of go through
the computation there.

00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:10.958
Now, this matrix right here
is almost the Hessian matrix,

00:05:10.958 --> 00:05:13.174
this is why I made a video
about the Hessian matrix.

00:05:13.174 --> 00:05:14.485
It's not quite, because everything

00:05:14.485 --> 00:05:16.101
has a 1/2 multiplied into it,

00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:17.229
so I'm just gonna kinda take that out

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:18.612
and we'll remember we have to multiply

00:05:18.612 --> 00:05:20.693
a 1/2 in at some point, but otherwise,

00:05:20.693 --> 00:05:22.949
it is the Hessian matrix, which we denote

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:26.274
with a kind of boldfaced H, boldfaced H,

00:05:26.274 --> 00:05:28.799
and emphasize that it's the Hessian of f.

00:05:28.799 --> 00:05:30.813
The Hessian is something
you take of a function.

00:05:30.813 --> 00:05:32.493
And like I said, remember
each of these terms

00:05:32.493 --> 00:05:34.352
we should be thinking of as evaluated

00:05:34.352 --> 00:05:36.068
on the special input point,

00:05:36.068 --> 00:05:38.990
evaluating it at that special, you know,

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:40.812
boldfaced x naught input point.

00:05:40.812 --> 00:05:42.515
I was just kind of too
lazy to write it in,

00:05:42.515 --> 00:05:44.064
each time the x naught y
naught, x naught y naught,

00:05:44.064 --> 00:05:45.729
x naught y naught, all of that.

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:48.896
But what we have then is we're
multiplying it on the right

00:05:48.896 --> 00:05:53.543
by this whole vector is the
variable vector, boldfaced x,

00:05:53.543 --> 00:05:58.456
minus boldfaced x naught, that's
what that entire vector is,

00:05:58.456 --> 00:06:00.911
and then we kind of have
the same thing on the right,

00:06:00.911 --> 00:06:05.675
you know, boldfaced
vector x minus x naught,

00:06:05.675 --> 00:06:08.135
except that we transpose it,
we kind of put it on its side,

00:06:08.135 --> 00:06:08.968
and the way you denote that,

00:06:08.968 --> 00:06:11.465
you have a little T there, for transpose.

00:06:11.465 --> 00:06:15.698
So this term captures all
of the quadratic information

00:06:15.698 --> 00:06:18.566
that we need for the approximation.

00:06:18.566 --> 00:06:20.402
So just to put it all together,

00:06:20.402 --> 00:06:23.434
if we go back up and we put
the Constant term that we have,

00:06:23.434 --> 00:06:25.458
the Linear term, and this quadratic form

00:06:25.458 --> 00:06:27.569
that we just found, all together,

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:30.953
what we get is that the
quadratic approximation of f,

00:06:30.953 --> 00:06:33.553
which is a function we'll
think of it as a vector input,

00:06:33.553 --> 00:06:37.915
boldfaced x, it equals the
function itself evaluated at,

00:06:37.915 --> 00:06:41.696
you know, whatever point
we're approximating near,

00:06:41.696 --> 00:06:44.215
plus the gradient of f, which is kind of,

00:06:44.215 --> 00:06:46.778
it's vector analog of a derivative,

00:06:46.778 --> 00:06:50.454
evaluated at that point, so
this is a constant vector,

00:06:50.454 --> 00:06:53.537
dot product with the variable vector,

00:06:55.357 --> 00:06:58.690
x minus the constant vector x naught,

00:07:00.082 --> 00:07:04.812
that whole thing, plus 1/2
the, then we'll just copy down

00:07:04.812 --> 00:07:06.878
this whole quadratic term up there,

00:07:06.878 --> 00:07:09.461
the variable minus the constant

00:07:13.253 --> 00:07:14.861
multiplied by the Hessian,

00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:16.263
which is kind of like an extension

00:07:16.263 --> 00:07:19.865
of the second derivative,
two multivariable functions,

00:07:19.865 --> 00:07:21.147
and we're evaluating that, no, let's see,

00:07:21.147 --> 00:07:24.041
we're evaluating it at the constant,

00:07:24.041 --> 00:07:28.217
at the constant, x naught,
and then on the right side,

00:07:28.217 --> 00:07:32.384
we're multiplying it by the
variable, x minus x naught.

00:07:35.496 --> 00:07:37.579
And this, this is the
quadratic approximation

00:07:37.579 --> 00:07:40.730
in vector form, and the
important part is, now,

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:43.144
it doesn't just have to be
of a two variable input.

00:07:43.144 --> 00:07:44.896
You could imagine plugging
in a three variable input,

00:07:44.896 --> 00:07:47.529
or a four variable input, and
all of these terms make sense.

00:07:47.529 --> 00:07:49.856
You know, you take the gradient
of a four variable function,

00:07:49.856 --> 00:07:51.466
you'll get a vector with four components.

00:07:51.466 --> 00:07:53.816
You take the Hessian of
a four variable function,

00:07:53.816 --> 00:07:55.629
you would get a four by four matrix.

00:07:55.629 --> 00:07:57.401
And all of these terms make sense.

00:07:57.401 --> 00:07:59.185
And I think it's also
prettier to write it this way,

00:07:59.185 --> 00:08:01.465
because it looks a lot more
like a Taylor expansion

00:08:01.465 --> 00:08:03.493
in the single variable world.

00:08:03.493 --> 00:08:05.186
You have, you know, a constant term,

00:08:05.186 --> 00:08:08.746
plus the value of a derivative,
times x minus a constant,

00:08:08.746 --> 00:08:11.705
plus 1/2 what's kind of like
the second derivative term,

00:08:11.705 --> 00:08:13.445
what's kind of like taking an x squared,

00:08:13.445 --> 00:08:16.098
but this is how it looks
in the vector world.

00:08:16.098 --> 00:08:17.826
So in that way it's
actually maybe a little bit

00:08:17.826 --> 00:08:19.598
more familiar than writing it out

00:08:19.598 --> 00:08:22.630
in the full, you know,
component by component term,

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.055
where it's easy to kind of
get lost in the weeds there.

00:08:25.055 --> 00:08:29.848
So, full vectorized form of
the quadratic approximation

00:08:29.848 --> 00:08:32.922
of a scalar valued multivariable function.

00:08:32.922 --> 00:08:34.295
Boy, is that a lot to say.
