A ransom note with proposed legislation.

13
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.270
Shut the JV job down in noon and don't disperse.

14
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.830
They wouldn't pay you as far as they could throw you.

15
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.410
They take you plunk in bud day.
Don't know you.

My powers are weak.
His powers,
he's strong.

26
00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.620
He's weak.
When he's strong,
he doesn't even understand that.
You're fine,

Oh my God.
That's Pam.
Make mouths buttholes chai anonymous.

Nice.
That's awesome.

33
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.060
They're really good.
They're awesome to shoot loads into.
Yeah.

34
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.420

Scratched to shit loads and oh right.

It's like 15% off just entering Rogan and then you can beat off for cheap and

40
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.820
golf on the sheep son.
Dude.
Flashlights rule quite great.
As I mentioned,

41
00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.520
it's amazing how controversial

42
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.150
<v 2>it is,
man.
A lot of people don't like this.
Is that true?
Very unhappy about it.</v>

43
00:03:04.151 --> 00:03:07.930
No Way.
Yes,
absolutely.
What do you mean like a flashlight companies live?

44
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:10.690
Give me advice to not get involved with this.

45
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.570
This rubber in a compromise and pornographic man.

46
00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.520
It's very controversial subject.
That's a weird,
it's hilarious,
isn't it?
Yeah.

47
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:22.270
It seems like it's a problem solver.
Sex is bad.

48
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.770
Neck pillow.
Talk about masturbation and like,

49
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.910
my mom never talks about Madison.
You know why?

50
00:03:27.911 --> 00:03:29.890
Because people have to work and when you have to work,

51
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:31.900
you have to work with women and when you have to work with women,

52
00:03:31.901 --> 00:03:34.750
you're not supposed to be talking about beating off in front of someone's wife

53
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:37.810
or someone's mom or whatever.
You can't talk like that.

54
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:39.550
You can't talk like you would talk right here.

55
00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.530
When you're working with a bunch of people,
it's offensive.

56
00:03:41.531 --> 00:03:44.140
When we live in a different reality,
I mean it's comedians.
It's just,

57
00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.550
it's a completely,

58
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:49.560
I go home to Minnesota where I'm from and it's just completely warped.

59
00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:50.550
I'm like making like AIDS,

60
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.780
<v 1>Joe.
Thanks giving dinner.
People are like,
I'm like,
why is nobody laughing?</v>

61
00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:58.830
They're like,
what are you doing?
People are crying like,
you can't just say shit.

62
00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.903
I know.

63
00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.830
<v 2>Terrible.
We,
we live in such a harsh world.</v>

64
00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.360
I know that it's also that most people are so programmed to like,
you know,

65
00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.020
try to be polite and correct and not talk like that.

66
00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.630
It's just one of those things.
The more you get used to it,

67
00:04:13.631 --> 00:04:17.560
the more it becomes normal.
It's our normal,
our,
our offensive is when you know,

68
00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:20.170
you go to someone's house and no one will swear.
Right.
It's just like,

69
00:04:20.171 --> 00:04:22.030
what kind of weird conversations are we going to have?

70
00:04:22.031 --> 00:04:24.880
I can't even say shit if I say Shit,
you're gonna freak out.

71
00:04:24.881 --> 00:04:26.110
Like we're not going to get anything done.

72
00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.740
And it's like you don't have to talk about like aids diarrhea or something all

73
00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:33.550
the time.
You know what I mean?
But it's like some people want to talk about that.

74
00:04:33.551 --> 00:04:35.650
There should be able to do it and they should not be judged.
If,

75
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.280
if there is blood in diarrhea occasionally and blood carries aids,

76
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:43.060
you can get aids.
Diarrhea.
Yeah.
It's informative and immature.

77
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.610
That's one of the worst ways to get diarrhea ever.
How'd you get it?
Oh No.

78
00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.330
The worst ways to get aids ever rather.
Yeah,
I did a shot of AIDS.
Diarrhea.

79
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.420
Yeah,
that's how I got it.
You can just stay positive.

80
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.060
You get aids from a tanning bed.
What are you talking about?

81
00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:59.380
That's what chicks say.

82
00:04:59.381 --> 00:05:01.870
You know how everyone says you can get herpes Herman tanning bed.

83
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.690
Now I heard the other day,
you can get aids from a tanning Beta,

84
00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:07.990
there's somebody on your period and then you sit down on that blood and then

85
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.620
what?

86
00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:12.880
And you have an open wound and your asshole a hemorrhoid and sucks it in like a

87
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:17.350
hemorrhoid.
Why would you have to kind of like until it inside your body,

88
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:21.310
you know,
like with blood,
blood doesn't like just go into your system.

89
00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.791
You know what I mean?

90
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:25.730
Like it has to be stuck in there or squished together like Indian style and you

91
00:05:25.731 --> 00:05:28.830
know,
is that,
does that work though?
I'm wondering if,
I'm wondering if you're war

92
00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.650
<v 1>[inaudible] 28 days later where if you bleed on Vibe,</v>

93
00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.990
they fucking turn into aids,
monkeys,
Zombie or whatever the fuck.

94
00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.910
I think it's hard.

95
00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:41.370
It's gotta be hard to get aids and it seems to be harder to get,

96
00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.510
there has to be a lot of depression.
Well,
it's so crazy.
See that,

97
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.370
<v 2>you know,
it came out and I remember what it came out.
That was the,</v>

98
00:05:48.371 --> 00:05:52.320
like the early 1980s there wasn't a big,
big public story.
And I'm,

99
00:05:52.321 --> 00:05:54.900
I remember thinking,
oh my God,
like this is so crazy.

100
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.070
Eventually everyone's going to fuck everyone and give everyone

101
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.470
<v 3>aids.
Right.
It's like you can't stop people from fucking,</v>

102
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:03.690
and if there's some disease that kills people when you fuck it's were gone or

103
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.870
it's the end as we knew it.
Yeah,
no,
that sounded good.

104
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:10.640
And then all of a sudden it didn't happen that way.
You know,

105
00:06:10.641 --> 00:06:13.250
like Magic Johnson was the first one that freaked everybody out.

106
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:17.300
I remember I was driving,
I was in revere.
Okay.
I was leaving the gym,

107
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.810
I was in my car with my girlfriend and we were listening to the radio and they

108
00:06:20.811 --> 00:06:22.370
were talking about how magic Johnson was like,

109
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:24.770
make it some sort of a press conference to announce it.
He's,

110
00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:28.460
he's got aids that he's HIV positive.
We were like,
Holy Shit,

111
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:32.480
Magic Johnson's going to die.
Whoa.
That was like,

112
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.330
that was reality.
I thought everyone's going to be dead.

113
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:38.180
We're going to be fucked because now obviously men are getting it from women and

114
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:41.150
women and getting it from men and men are getting it from men.
It's just fucking,

115
00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:45.780
it's just a fuck sandwich out there.
Skeeto AIDS,
the AIDS mosquitoes.

116
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.500
Magic Johnson got to remember the fucking dope has aids.
It makes me look better.

117
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:52.470
Yeah,
he looks great.

118
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:57.490
He's not even aging is AIDS is causing him to not age fountain of Youth.

119
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:01.170
It's really,
he's like plump and like looks vitals,
killing it.

120
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:05.900
Healthy fucking strong skin.
There was that one person that was the first person.

121
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:09.410
That guy,
he's not sagging and everything.
He's not turning a no person.

122
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.600
He looks like a elastic.
He looks a lot and weird shit with it's dude.
He's got

123
00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:20.950
here dope.
Did you hit that first guy that just got a cured yet?
Yeah,

124
00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.960
that's what,
stem cells.
Yeah.
Fucking time.
Well,

125
00:07:23.961 --> 00:07:26.990
you know there's a whole school of thought that,
that it doesn't,

126
00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.060
the HIV and AIDS aren't real.

127
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.720
I don't understand it and I'm not even going to get into it,
but it's,

128
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:36.920
there's a guy named doctor Peter Duesberg and he's a biologist out of the

129
00:07:36.921 --> 00:07:40.700
University of California Berkeley and he says there's no connection between HIV

130
00:07:40.701 --> 00:07:43.730
and aids.
He said that aids would,
AIDS is when people are jacked.

131
00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.540
He says a bunch of things you said it could be drug use and a lot of people it

132
00:07:47.541 --> 00:07:48.810
is,
it's like a lot of it.

133
00:07:48.811 --> 00:07:52.310
It's crystal meth and poppers and Emile nitrate and you know,

134
00:07:52.311 --> 00:07:54.980
and they said it's a lot of other undiagnosed things and what it is just

135
00:07:54.981 --> 00:07:57.260
crushing your t cell count and what his,

136
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:02.410
what he says is that the reason why people test positive for HIV is that HIV is

137
00:08:03.861 --> 00:08:07.490
a very weak virus and it can only exist in the system of someone who's already

138
00:08:07.491 --> 00:08:11.930
been compromised.
So it's instead of,
you know,
that HIV causes AIDS,

139
00:08:11.931 --> 00:08:14.930
what he says is a symptom of the fact your systems is checked.
Right.

140
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.210
And the gay community like that.

141
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:19.880
They do a lot of crystal meth and poppers insurance too.
So I've heard,

142
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.210
so I've heard as well.
I don't,
you know,

143
00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:26.090
I don't pretend that that makes sense though.

144
00:08:26.091 --> 00:08:28.820
That doesn't make any sense that these scientists wouldn't have figured out that

145
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:31.460
HIV doesn't cause [inaudible] huge.

146
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.430
But do you really think that there'll be that kind of a cover up,

147
00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:37.840
like in that massive escape [inaudible] where every scientist,

148
00:08:37.841 --> 00:08:42.650
that kind of studies it goes all Yang.
Yang,
Yang connected.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I Dunno.

149
00:08:42.680 --> 00:08:44.590
I don't think so.
That's a big,
yeah.

150
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:49.700
I just bet it's a complicated motherfucking virus all I just got super lucky.

151
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:53.810
I'll get that shit.
It's like a tasty low.
I don't got it yet.

152
00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:56.100
Okay.
I know.
Got

153
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.020
<v 2>it yet.
I'll get it tonight mother fucker too.</v>

154
00:09:01.021 --> 00:09:05.130
How about people that go looking for it,
man.
How about bug Chase's?
Oh God.

155
00:09:05.220 --> 00:09:06.570
That's a scary thing,
man.

156
00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:11.300
People that are on purpose getting HIV there on purpose,
Linton dude,

157
00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:16.080
shoot loads into them.
They need to do that.
Is there a documentary on that?

158
00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.610
I bet that would be an interesting documentary.
Like,
yeah,
you should do.

159
00:09:19.611 --> 00:09:20.590
You should do for me.

160
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:24.000
That should be your next project with his pants now that the Austin videos out

161
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:28.830
and everybody,
if you go to my youtube page,
it's Joe Rogan,
d o.
T.
N.

162
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.580
E t is my youtube page and um,
there's a new video.

163
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.190
It's good times in Austin or something like that,

164
00:09:35.191 --> 00:09:38.430
but Brian just just completed and it's a fucking masterpiece and things

165
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:40.700
spectacular.
A Little Austin.
Yeah,

166
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.460
a little Austin and it's got the Joey Diaz incident show,

167
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:45.720
the Alex Jones show,

168
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:49.080
which was the greatest thing I've ever seen on my time here on earth.

169
00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:53.800
It was fuck Ufo is landing.
Fuck all that.
I mean,

170
00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.350
do you have folks are going to be that funny.

171
00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.840
That was better than anything I've ever seen.

172
00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.390
I never seen a movie that made me laugh that hard,
man.

173
00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:03.600
I've never seen anything that made me laugh that hard that I've never laughed

174
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:06.450
harder in my life.
One time I can't close Brian Cowen,

175
00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:11.040
we were all stoned in a hotel room with Brian Count was doing his Jujitsu gay

176
00:10:11.041 --> 00:10:14.730
rapist bit.
He does this Portuguese accent,

177
00:10:14.731 --> 00:10:17.370
like this heavy Brazilian accent when we talks about,
you know,

178
00:10:17.371 --> 00:10:21.230
like taking guys down a mountain there and then raping you

179
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.340
dear.
That sounds like Brian can paper.
He's hilarious.

180
00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:30.200
One of the funniest guys can I can already visualize.
Yeah,
it's brilliant.

181
00:10:30.201 --> 00:10:33.510
The bid is brilliant and was those,
those are close.
Those were close,

182
00:10:33.690 --> 00:10:37.050
but I think Joey Diaz is going to take the cake because that was on on the radio

183
00:10:37.051 --> 00:10:39.690
in front of probably a million listeners.

184
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.330
People watching it on the Internet from now until you know,

185
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:47.070
who knows when the videos were everywhere and it was God damn hilarious and it

186
00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:50.880
was live.
He just totally hijacked that dude show.
Todd tracked it.

187
00:10:50.881 --> 00:10:54.750
But my favorite part about it is like the stories hilarious on its own,

188
00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:59.520
but then in that context of hijacking the live show and telling it angrily made

189
00:10:59.521 --> 00:11:02.190
it like another level of fun dude.
But sorry,
lit up.

190
00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:06.030
Just cue up his rant on the Alex Jones show to queue up that part and play it

191
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:06.800
for people.
Yeah.

192
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.020
Well you know what's crazy about the whole video two is it starts off with you

193
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:14.250
saying the word retard on the radio and how they had the sensor that you know,

194
00:11:14.251 --> 00:11:17.930
and then it goes to the extreme of Joey Diaz,
saint fucking fat one.

195
00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:19.590
I told you after I stopped saying though,

196
00:11:19.591 --> 00:11:21.030
so that was going to stop saying faggot.

197
00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:24.780
A guy emailed me and asked me to stop saying cock sucker as well,
and I'm like,

198
00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:29.070
okay,
we're getting crazy.
Yeah.
Like we're getting crazy.

199
00:11:29.670 --> 00:11:31.300
You can't say retard.
Look,

200
00:11:31.860 --> 00:11:36.860
retarded is been a way that we describe people that are idiots forever and the,

201
00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:40.740
it's not,
it's not offensive.
You know what's offensive?

202
00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.870
It's offensive that you think that some sort of a,

203
00:11:42.871 --> 00:11:47.010
a word is going to make any sort of a difference.
That's what's offensive.
It's,

204
00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.630
it's,
that's,
that's ridiculous.
Look,

205
00:11:48.780 --> 00:11:53.740
if I'm shitting on little kids that have down syndrome children,
you know,

206
00:11:53.741 --> 00:11:54.010
that's,

207
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.260
<v 0>that's cruel and horrible.
That's not a nice thing to do,</v>

208
00:11:56.261 --> 00:11:58.270
but it's not what we're talking about.

209
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.180
We're talking about someone being a retard.
You know what the fuck we're saying?

210
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:04.510
Yeah,
no,
people are fucking stupid.
What are you supposed to say?
Yes.

211
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.810
We'll say idiot and idiots.
Okay.
Yeah,
because I mean,

212
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.040
you could dissect every fucking where you know retarder originally was the desk,

213
00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:17.020
the,
the,
the,
the,
I think the medical designation for it was mongoloid idiot.

214
00:12:17.170 --> 00:12:20.740
That was like the way they used to describe them.
So,
I mean that was like,

215
00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:22.870
that was like the real nomenclature,
you know?

216
00:12:22.871 --> 00:12:25.870
So retarded sounds way better than mongoloid it is.
Yeah.

217
00:12:25.871 --> 00:12:29.890
Could you imagine what the fuck man.
Mongoloid is a funny word.

218
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:32.020
I think the whole stand thing too though.

219
00:12:32.021 --> 00:12:34.970
The major things weird cause you grew up calling a midget.
Yeah.
No,

220
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.260
it's a little people.
Yeah,
that shits crazy.
That's why I call midgets retard.

221
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.123
Retard

222
00:12:40.690 --> 00:12:44.540
<v 4>targeted
and I caught midgets.
Faggots.</v>

223
00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.110
Target people.
Faggots.
I just switch it up.

224
00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.430
<v 5>That's the move,
man.
That's all I got.</v>

225
00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:57.000
<v 0>Move.
All right.
Here's the Joey Diaz audio</v>

226
00:13:00.430 --> 00:13:03.050
<v 5>[inaudible].</v>

227
00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:10.130
<v 0>This is the Alex Jones studio.</v>

228
00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:17.380
<v 4>Oh,
this is just the part that you described me before.
It goes right into it.</v>

229
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.713
It's cooler this way.

230
00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:25.530
<v 5>The master of what's Cooler,
dude,
Joey Diaz.</v>

231
00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.910
Churchly Joe had,
I'm going to skip this last network right here,
right?

232
00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:34.540
We're going skip the break.
I saw a humbling thing.

233
00:13:34.541 --> 00:13:37.360
I said answer the funniest thing I ever saw my father life.
Hey,

234
00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:39.010
good to see you as a little.
We always a pleasure.

235
00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:41.850
Thanks for the delays on in there.
You're talking about smuggling.

236
00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:43.640
We understand from the air force.

237
00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:47.350
I had this Baggie and I belonged on my left side.

238
00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:51.640
[inaudible] I know

239
00:13:53.370 --> 00:13:56.200
this is real.
So this is not a control.

240
00:13:56.230 --> 00:14:01.210
This is nice little ass design on it.
This whole bumping joints out of as worse.

241
00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:06.550
Hold on.
He is worse than any problems.
Much worse told I love him,

242
00:14:06.551 --> 00:14:11.120
but don't bring this monster out here.
It's like,
it's like a Flintstone.

243
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:16.510
So your viewers know the people in the line.
We're looking for.

244
00:14:16.511 --> 00:14:18.110
The truth on this show is about the truth.

245
00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:23.250
I got once I got that and I had baggy clothes on Delta,

246
00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:26.380
they sound speakers,
rep baggy clothes on the indoor ones right now.

247
00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.480
We said we're gonna put you,
if you x ray machine,

248
00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.710
I'll stand in this wet and bullets with this baggy on the my fucking all that

249
00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.300
salt off left us bigger on the regular cause I'm a ride.

250
00:14:35.301 --> 00:14:38.490
He stopped like cancer for colleagues,
you know,

251
00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.450
the opposite hand and somebody saw him stand up,
my legs open.

252
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:48.600
You're like Rodney Dangerfield,
come stop by.
You're talking about

253
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:52.810
not basic my balls.
I'm sweating now.

254
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.040
I lost it again.
Was that it shook my hand.
I'm like,
Mike,

255
00:14:58.041 --> 00:15:01.760
Taxpayers are hard at Wharton.
Don't know.
I know I Joseph,
go fuck yourself.

256
00:15:01.770 --> 00:15:06.160
You can't hold on one second.
Joey Diaz,
Facebook.

257
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.960
Check yourself before you wreck yourself.
Big Dixie Das.

258
00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:15.040
[inaudible]

259
00:15:23.070 --> 00:15:25.470
<v 6>oh my God.
Oh my God.</v>

260
00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:28.510
Big Ticks in your ass and bad for your health.

261
00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.520
Check yourself before you wreck yourself.
You know it's funny,

262
00:15:32.521 --> 00:15:37.080
I was going to edit the song,
the ice teas or ice cube's song that that's from,

263
00:15:37.081 --> 00:15:40.380
but that song is actually pretty stupid.
Like it's not a good,

264
00:15:40.410 --> 00:15:44.700
coolest song to listen to you.
Maybe we good for that one quote,
but that quote,

265
00:15:44.701 --> 00:15:47.700
that's funny cause I remember that song being great because of that line.

266
00:15:47.701 --> 00:15:50.940
But then I listened to him.
I'm like,
Eh,
what?
Check Yourself Prereq yourself.

267
00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:56.370
It's like chick,
you still,
people you make
for your health.

268
00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:59.940
I come like this stove ideas took it to another level,
right?
Yeah.

269
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:03.060
He brought that up.
Used to find this guy ever.
There's no one.

270
00:16:03.070 --> 00:16:06.660
I've never met anybody in my entire life.
That's funny.
Then Joey Diaz?
No one,

271
00:16:06.661 --> 00:16:10.830
dude,
I just remember that I did a music video with Sandler like 10 years ago.

272
00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.970
And Joey don't you,
we used his ball sack in the video.

273
00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:17.860
It's a song about shaving your pubic hair.
No,
no.

274
00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:22.380
And there's a clip of joy's balls bouncing up and down that online.

275
00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:26.610
Yeah,
it's called,
um,
fuck.

276
00:16:27.210 --> 00:16:30.390
I Trim my bushes.
I'm sure my,
my,
I can't remember him.

277
00:16:30.391 --> 00:16:35.340
So Brandon trimmed my Bush or some shit,
whatever.

278
00:16:35.341 --> 00:16:36.750
Does anybody ever say that at work?

279
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:39.540
I had to film that fat man on the toilet series,

280
00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:44.160
which was Joey d is fat in the naked on a toilet.
And He,

281
00:16:44.161 --> 00:16:47.280
the whole idea was that it was going to be made for cell phones where we filmed

282
00:16:47.281 --> 00:16:50.340
him on the toilet,
giving advice,
like traffic,
horse scope,

283
00:16:50.341 --> 00:16:53.770
whether news and stuff like that.
And then I had to be in this little,
uh,

284
00:16:53.850 --> 00:16:57.210
bathroom with like every video recorder by myself.

285
00:16:57.211 --> 00:17:00.720
I was a hot La Day and it was just him fucking naked and he would stamp,

286
00:17:00.721 --> 00:17:03.450
you're like,
ah,
it's just balls hanging everywhere.

287
00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.030
And it was like the humid in the bathroom.

288
00:17:06.031 --> 00:17:09.000
You would just start ranting about shit,
there's nothing written.
Right,
right.

289
00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:13.410
And I remember it was that this in this pool house of a friend of one of the

290
00:17:13.411 --> 00:17:15.840
guys that work on fear factor or something like that.
David Herwoods.
Yeah.

291
00:17:15.841 --> 00:17:19.120
And like,
like his goes,
oh no,
no,
I don't think man,

292
00:17:19.140 --> 00:17:22.200
I don't think he was the director of or something like that.
Yeah.
And there's,

293
00:17:22.201 --> 00:17:25.260
the wife came in and was like,
I brought you guys lemonade.
I'm like,

294
00:17:25.261 --> 00:17:27.470
this is fucking creepy.
This is like my,

295
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:30.750
one of my first years out in La and I'm like,
I'm doing porn.

296
00:17:30.751 --> 00:17:32.580
This is how I start doing corn.
Right.

297
00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.570
Joey take a shit.
Uh,
no,

298
00:17:36.571 --> 00:17:41.460
he just sat there the whole time and then I started giving him like Joey Diaz

299
00:17:41.461 --> 00:17:46.440
doesn't,
he doesn't fit on toilets correctly.
Yeah.
So he leaves these,

300
00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.070
these survivors that have like crashed this ship and

301
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:54.780
<v 0>then
crawling up on the beach.
The best fucking change.</v>

302
00:17:54.781 --> 00:17:58.080
Right.
But Joey sheds there,

303
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.420
he leaves him a bathroom all the time.

304
00:18:00.421 --> 00:18:03.210
Especially like in the humidity that makes me feel climbing up and trying to

305
00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:04.860
escape like crabs in a bucket.

306
00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:08.000
They're not totally in the water like half submerged.

307
00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.420
The mirror was fogged and I wrote,

308
00:18:09.421 --> 00:18:12.900
I love you on it and stuff like that because it was so humid from his balls in

309
00:18:12.901 --> 00:18:16.530
there and the greatest parts,
the greatest party he'd stood up in,

310
00:18:16.531 --> 00:18:19.890
his balls were hanging at least 12 inches or something like that and I kept on

311
00:18:19.891 --> 00:18:23.250
throwing that toilet paper roll is trying to hit it like a carnival and at the

312
00:18:23.251 --> 00:18:26.760
very end I fucking hit it.
Oh my God.
It's in the video.

313
00:18:26.761 --> 00:18:30.350
It's called Jody is fat man on a toilet or something like that to his line,

314
00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:35.250
his balls,
they literally look like rocks and an old lady's videos.

315
00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:42.780
They're ridiculous.
They're ridiculous.
I never seen balls so big in my life.

316
00:18:43.020 --> 00:18:45.990
It doesn't even make sense.
Yeah.
Which brings me up to a very important point,

317
00:18:46.170 --> 00:18:49.290
chuck this up my next door.
Well,
I don't want to say that.

318
00:18:49.770 --> 00:18:54.240
Some people that I know.
Nice,
Nice.
See the people that I know,

319
00:18:54.241 --> 00:18:55.470
they're very nice people.
This

320
00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:59.070
<v 3>gay couple.
They,
um,
they had a kid and they,</v>

321
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:04.090
they impregnated a woman with their loads and the way they did it was they put

322
00:19:04.291 --> 00:19:07.110
their loads together and then they mixed it up.

323
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:12.160
<v 0>No,
a squirt it in fall.
It was like I'm on or off.</v>

324
00:19:12.161 --> 00:19:14.140
And it was just like,
hopefully it's my,
it's fucking shit.

325
00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.540
What's fascinating about that?
I mean it's fascinating

326
00:19:16.550 --> 00:19:19.010
<v 3>about that cause it's kind of weird.
Like they,
they really did,</v>

327
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.550
they didn't just adopt a baby.
They created a baby with their own genetics.

328
00:19:22.551 --> 00:19:24.440
Like they have a couple somehow or another.

329
00:19:24.530 --> 00:19:27.380
I mean they'll figure out eventually whose baby it really is,
you know,

330
00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:30.340
especially if they get in fights or something like that.
But the,

331
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:34.310
the idea is that somehow or another,
you know,
you're going to figure out,

332
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.490
you know,
you're going to get this,
these loads in there and it's gonna,
you know,

333
00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:39.710
they're going to just have a race,
but they're not going to have a race.

334
00:19:39.711 --> 00:19:41.570
They're going to murder each other.
Right.

335
00:19:41.571 --> 00:19:46.571
Like a big percentage of the loads that you shoot are just murderous sperm

336
00:19:46.761 --> 00:19:50.120
killers.
They're all they want to do is go kill other sperm.

337
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.370
They're sent out there to make sure that the sperm that's already in the cooler,

338
00:19:54.371 --> 00:19:58.460
it doesn't get to the eggs.
And so they attack and they go smash it.
And the,

339
00:19:58.461 --> 00:20:00.290
the more promiscuous the women are,

340
00:20:00.500 --> 00:20:04.550
the more your body produces more of these crazy killer sperm.

341
00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:09.700
That's why ball size is directly proportional to female slots in the community.

342
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:12.980
So like that's why gorillas have little balls.

343
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:16.070
Gorillas have little balls because female gorillas are chill.

344
00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:21.100
They're not horse chimpanzees have giant balls because female chimps are fucking

345
00:20:21.171 --> 00:20:25.400
whores.
They're whores.
They just want chimp,
Dick all over town Kerry.

346
00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:30.020
And so these chimps have to force those killer loads in there so that their

347
00:20:30.021 --> 00:20:34.520
genetics can move on to attack the loads.
So these guys in creating this baby,

348
00:20:34.521 --> 00:20:38.390
they really launched this sperm fucking genocide campaign where they just

349
00:20:38.391 --> 00:20:41.090
attacked each other in the dish.
Oh my God.
You know,

350
00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.680
there's no harmony in the in that

351
00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:44.610
<v 0>there is no harmony in that.
And then we should do,</v>

352
00:20:44.611 --> 00:20:49.210
they should have like a like see through flashlights and then let's all fuck it.

353
00:20:49.211 --> 00:20:50.410
And there'll be like an ant farm and what?

354
00:20:50.411 --> 00:20:53.890
Just watched all this shit go down on the fighter,
the sperm fight.
Wow.

355
00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:57.970
I wonder if you could,
that's so true,
right?
I don't know.
Wow.

356
00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:01.360
If you were like,
you know,
like you had a box and you can only,

357
00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:03.460
well you don't want to receive each other while you're shooting loads,

358
00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:09.550
but if you,
you had like something like the to room Bluetooth,
like video,

359
00:21:09.730 --> 00:21:10.540
maybe it's like yours,

360
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.900
a hole in the wall and the fleshlight is attached to the hole in the wall,
right?

361
00:21:13.901 --> 00:21:16.330
And you're in one room fucking it and your friends and another room.
Fuck it.

362
00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:19.180
And it falls into the center and that's the catch tray.

363
00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:22.330
And then it mixes them all together under some super powerful microscope.

364
00:21:22.331 --> 00:21:26.870
And we would watch sperm wars,
sperm wars.

365
00:21:27.250 --> 00:21:31.240
If you imagine that it would be like,
let's,
let's just pitch it.
Let's pitch it,

366
00:21:31.241 --> 00:21:31.510
dude.

367
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:35.260
Let's at least set up a meeting and just pitch it around how to see the look on

368
00:21:35.261 --> 00:21:38.440
people's faces and you,
and it's like,
you want me to put our names on it?

369
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:43.270
So we just say we're totally committed to the show.
Like this is our,

370
00:21:43.271 --> 00:21:47.710
this is our fucking dreams for Morris.
It's actually a good idea for a show.

371
00:21:47.711 --> 00:21:51.950
You could have a show where you took celebrities and you,
you,

372
00:21:51.951 --> 00:21:54.380
you shot their loads.
You know,
they,
they do this,
you know,

373
00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.410
they don't have to actually do it.
You know,

374
00:21:56.411 --> 00:21:59.590
you just pretend they're doing it and then you animate what's going on with

375
00:21:59.591 --> 00:22:02.530
their loads.
Yeah,
that'd be sweet to,
you know,

376
00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:06.190
like Dwayne the Rock Johnson versus Brock Lesnar.

377
00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:08.290
Get their loads together and battle it out.

378
00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:13.210
You could have like fucking Daniel Day Lewis versus fucking Jeremy Irons.

379
00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.920
Ooh,
I liked that one.
Classy sperm fight.
A classy,

380
00:22:17.850 --> 00:22:22.230
a fucking method.
Sperm English accent.
Sperms,
sperms.

381
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:25.060
So white gloves at dual,

382
00:22:25.061 --> 00:22:28.660
perhaps I duo and duo.

383
00:22:28.690 --> 00:22:32.080
It's amazing how much distinction that accent carries.

384
00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.740
How much more you take someone's opinion.
Seriously.
Yeah.

385
00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:39.430
They just sound so much smarter like that.
A,
I love that show.
Top gear.

386
00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:44.290
You ever watched that show?
No.
What is it to UK show about?
About cars mostly.

387
00:22:44.500 --> 00:22:45.810
So they just,
they,
they,

388
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:50.200
they go on these little trips and shit and they drive these crazy Ferrari's and

389
00:22:50.201 --> 00:22:52.900
shit all over the place and they have like little games that they play on little

390
00:22:52.901 --> 00:22:56.230
contests they do with each other and you're like,
who can get,
like,
they'll one,

391
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:58.120
one guy will be in a,
in a Ferrari,

392
00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.210
the other guys have to catch a plane and you know,

393
00:23:01.211 --> 00:23:04.900
and then a train and he has a straight John Ferrara you'd want to see who makes

394
00:23:04.901 --> 00:23:06.970
it their first,
you know,
so they do a bunch of shit like that.

395
00:23:06.970 --> 00:23:09.990
But Jeremy Clarkson,
who's the main host guy and both,

396
00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.380
all three of the guys that are hosts,

397
00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.020
they're all English and because their English,

398
00:23:14.021 --> 00:23:16.600
because they have that English accent,
when they make fun of something,

399
00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.530
it seems so preposterous.
Like they seemed so correct.
Right.
Very,

400
00:23:20.531 --> 00:23:25.360
very influential on,
on,
on Americans for some reason.
Yeah.
What the fuck is that?

401
00:23:25.361 --> 00:23:28.960
All Americans aren't thrilled with that accent is a killer.
Australian is like,

402
00:23:28.961 --> 00:23:31.350
you're a little dirty,
you know,
if you've got that Australian thing,

403
00:23:31.351 --> 00:23:33.910
we'll hear you like to party a little crazier.

404
00:23:33.911 --> 00:23:36.970
You know you've got the like to party English.
The Marines.
Yeah.

405
00:23:36.971 --> 00:23:40.360
It's like they're really close,
but they're more like more like potty.

406
00:23:40.361 --> 00:23:45.290
We had a polity,
Mike.
Yeah.
Is that good?
No.
Why is that?
I bowl.
Yeah,

407
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:47.930
they're crazier.
The Australians a little wilder.

408
00:23:48.080 --> 00:23:51.790
The English are thought of as more distinctive trait that Ohio and mate don't be

409
00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.430
fucking pussy.
Excellent.
That was,
and there was a combination.

410
00:23:55.820 --> 00:23:57.710
I think that was Welsh.
Yeah.

411
00:23:57.880 --> 00:24:02.880
It was like Aztec meets fucking the craziest I've ever met is a Dublin,

412
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:08.030
no,
not Dublin.
Belfast,
Belfast,
Northern Ireland.
Jesus.
I've never,

413
00:24:08.060 --> 00:24:10.220
never talked to anybody with an accident like that before.

414
00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:13.550
Their accent is almost impenetrable when they're talking to you.

415
00:24:13.551 --> 00:24:16.910
It's almost like you'd like right in front of a dude he speaking English and you

416
00:24:16.911 --> 00:24:18.770
don't have a fucking clue what he's saying.

417
00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.610
What was that accident that movie's snatch Morelos dudes couldn't make out.

418
00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:27.290
They were Gypsies,
right?
Doesn't Z.
Yeah.
Brad Pitt at the crazy fucking ex.

419
00:24:27.291 --> 00:24:29.570
Hikeys that's what that's right.
Yeah.
Pikeys

420
00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.950
cause that's what it sounded like,
man.
That's what it's like in Belfast.

421
00:24:33.951 --> 00:24:38.360
Belfast is nuts.
Belfast never been to a place more depressing.
You know.

422
00:24:38.361 --> 00:24:42.410
And then people in Vail Pass Paradise,
they get,
they get mad when I say this,

423
00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:46.070
I've said this a few times,
you know,
and people from Belfast to like fuck you,

424
00:24:46.071 --> 00:24:50.210
this is the output.
Could bill festers also,
it's raining every day,
dude.

425
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:52.010
It's raining everyday.
Everything's gray.

426
00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:53.390
If you take a color picture of something,

427
00:24:53.391 --> 00:24:57.500
you have no idea it's color cause it's fucking great.
Looks like old times.

428
00:24:57.501 --> 00:25:01.220
God Damn Black and white.
Why would they,
even if if we lived in Belfast,

429
00:25:01.221 --> 00:25:03.980
we would never even need to invent color cameras cause you wouldn't use them.

430
00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:05.330
Everything's fucking gray by the way.

431
00:25:05.331 --> 00:25:07.610
I hate it when people are from a place and he like,

432
00:25:07.611 --> 00:25:10.220
they can't even shit on their own.
Like I'm from Minnesota,

433
00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:12.590
there's bad parts that there's bad things about it.

434
00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:15.480
I can fucking admit that I hated when people are like,
I'm from here dude.

435
00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.770
No it's my book and grew up,
it's like silly.
Oh fuck.

436
00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:22.490
People get attached to different,
they get attached to their patch of dirt.

437
00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:25.400
You know,
like they get attached to their,
their challenge,
their spot.

438
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:30.950
This is our fucking area,
man.
What's the deal with Gypsies?
Do they even exist?

439
00:25:30.951 --> 00:25:32.450
Is that even a race?
Absolutely.

440
00:25:32.451 --> 00:25:36.230
So when you say like those Gypsies in that going through my trash,
that's like,

441
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:41.350
is that like saying that those are really Gypsies or I'm calling him Gypsies for

442
00:25:41.961 --> 00:25:45.530
a reason.
There are a whole lot of them here in America or in Europe though.

443
00:25:45.531 --> 00:25:49.850
There's a lot of Gypsies.
Yeah.
I mean it's just people traveling around.

444
00:25:49.910 --> 00:25:52.160
They seem like they hide good or something.
Well,

445
00:25:52.161 --> 00:25:54.900
they know a lot about Werewolf's.
If you're ever been a werewolf movie,

446
00:25:55.010 --> 00:25:57.710
shitload about wearables.
Gypsies are always the ones,
man.

447
00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:01.280
The latest one was Benito del Toro.
Very Gypsy based,

448
00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:06.920
heavy in the Gypsy content.
Did I love Gypsies?
You ever had sex with a gypsy?

449
00:26:07.430 --> 00:26:11.300
Well,
no.
I have a gypsy fleshlight though.
Yeah.
What's the difference?

450
00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:16.540
That's kind of fucking Bandana on and fucking drink hits and shit and fucking

451
00:26:18.170 --> 00:26:22.850
like fucking whispers and shit and like sides and the bracelets.
Shit.

452
00:26:23.090 --> 00:26:27.440
Dirty dirty ankle bracelets.
Every girl who has anchor bolts,
it's wants Dick.

453
00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:30.320
That's a fact.
If you're walking around with ankle bracelets on,

454
00:26:30.321 --> 00:26:32.940
you want some Dick or a toe ring or a toe.
Right?

455
00:26:32.970 --> 00:26:36.820
That's just a fucking Dick dive started,
bitch.
She says,

456
00:26:36.860 --> 00:26:38.240
goddamn cocked magnet.

457
00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:41.490
I used to wear two hats on fucking Dick Diving board and yeah man,

458
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:44.280
you trying to look sparkly and shiny.
Your ankles

459
00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:47.430
<v 3>and your feet.
What are you saying?
Yeah,
look at your legs.
That's what you want.</v>

460
00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:50.460
Yeah.
How much difference is that then?
Like I'll watch though.

461
00:26:50.461 --> 00:26:53.540
You know people that are obsessed with watches for guys like jewelry,

462
00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:56.010
it's no different,
but every guy wants pussy.

463
00:26:56.020 --> 00:27:00.900
See or every guy wants sex every 100%.
Most women don't want sex from you.

464
00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.740
That's what the deal is.
That's the difference.
So in a guy doing it makes sense.

465
00:27:04.741 --> 00:27:08.910
He's trying to attract someone who's like,
look at the shiny.
Yeah,

466
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:10.950
you are so shiny with your shiny,

467
00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:13.350
I would just start wearing sequence shirts then.

468
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.260
It's not that you gotta be careful.
We didn't.

469
00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:20.140
<v 1>Yeah,
cause it's gonna attract the wrong.
It's too much shine.
Amex guys go,</v>

470
00:27:20.141 --> 00:27:23.340
I want that.
If it were really just,

471
00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.650
if the shiny was the only key people would have like diamond top hats and shit

472
00:27:28.651 --> 00:27:29.484
and fucking life,

473
00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.890
I would have a fucking diamond turtleneck and just be walking around and,

474
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:34.740
and Keynes sequence.
No Sir.

475
00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:39.910
<v 3>Dumb or the um,
environment,
you know,
the more,
more diamonds who will use.
Right.</v>

476
00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:43.420
You know,
your pretend time by the way is fucking hilarious.

477
00:27:43.650 --> 00:27:47.470
Have you seen his new show and kind of having that I'm guilty of not seeing very

478
00:27:47.471 --> 00:27:49.960
good.
Nick Swardson is attached.

479
00:27:49.961 --> 00:27:53.800
It has my unequivocal bowl seal of approval.

480
00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:57.800
<v 1>I love with standing.
I'm sure I would love it.
And so filthy and fucked up.</v>

481
00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:59.220
Can you believe it?
Love it as I hate it.

482
00:27:59.240 --> 00:28:01.050
I have people come up to the fucking debt.

483
00:28:01.090 --> 00:28:04.340
I means you're doing the total correct thing.
Yeah.
That's what I think.

484
00:28:04.341 --> 00:28:06.590
I love the cat in the wheelchair.
That's one of my favorite,

485
00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:08.300
favorite critic goes your show.

486
00:28:08.301 --> 00:28:11.810
I have a sketch show up for people who don't know it's already done.
But um,

487
00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:16.220
for uh,
at a Kritikos uh,
yeah,
I watched Nick Swardson show.

488
00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:18.920
It's just the same old shit we've seen before.

489
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:23.810
Literally my shows that cat in a wheelchair that does cocaine.
Yeah.

490
00:28:23.811 --> 00:28:24.920
What a broken record.

491
00:28:24.921 --> 00:28:29.921
That theme is a cat in a fucking wheelchair that this coke.

492
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:33.170
Yeah.
God been there,
done that.
Have A,

493
00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:34.950
<v 3>I have a huge problem with really,</v>

494
00:28:34.951 --> 00:28:38.100
really mediocre people that are criticizing other people.

495
00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:41.340
Really mediocre writers really mean,
Oh my God.

496
00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.020
This day and age is fucking crazy because anybody can be a credit.
Yeah.

497
00:28:45.030 --> 00:28:47.240
All you have to do and there's a website can retarded.
Yeah.

498
00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.580
And if your snarky enough and if you're shitty enough about people,

499
00:28:50.730 --> 00:28:53.550
you know you can get really popular.
A lot of these websites,

500
00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:57.420
they just keep at it every day and they're shitty and Douchey to people and they

501
00:28:57.421 --> 00:29:00.270
get a lot of hits,
you know?
And so that everybody starts thinking,

502
00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:03.270
well that's all I need to do to be a critic.
I just need to be a Douche bag.

503
00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:05.700
And so,
you know,
critics equal,
you know,

504
00:29:05.701 --> 00:29:09.210
you just try to find out a way to shit on things,
you know,
and your,

505
00:29:09.211 --> 00:29:11.980
your actual assessment of what you like or don't like it.

506
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:15.840
There's no real substance to any event cause you're a fucking moron.

507
00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.430
If you had anything to contribute,

508
00:29:17.431 --> 00:29:20.610
you wouldn't be a goddamn critic in the first place.
Right.
I mean,
yeah.

509
00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:23.220
What the hell would want to be a critic of your creative person?
I mean,

510
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:25.060
there's one thing to be a appreciator of,

511
00:29:25.061 --> 00:29:28.680
of art and that appreciation leads you to be a critical,
like I think like,

512
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:32.490
like Roger Ebert,
I think that got truly appreciates the art of filmmaking,

513
00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:35.430
I think.
Absolutely.
There's critics like that that are artists.

514
00:29:35.431 --> 00:29:38.610
They're like these,
he actually appreciates what he's talking about.

515
00:29:38.611 --> 00:29:42.280
It's like a really important,
meaningful thing to him.
But then on the flip side,

516
00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.590
<v 1>I don't,
I get annoyed by critics who like,</v>

517
00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:49.840
we'll see movies that I do and you know,
Roger Ebert in particular,

518
00:29:49.841 --> 00:29:52.900
but the guys who are like high Falutin critics and they'd be like,
yeah,

519
00:29:52.901 --> 00:29:55.690
I saw benchwarmers this is garbage.
It's like,
well,
yeah,

520
00:29:55.691 --> 00:29:58.690
that's not fucking for you.
You know what I mean?
Like if you're a big critic,

521
00:29:58.691 --> 00:30:03.250
like Joan Review a movie that you're obviously going to find flaws in the plot

522
00:30:03.251 --> 00:30:06.570
of like,
what the fuck?
You know,
people do silly movie,

523
00:30:06.571 --> 00:30:07.560
you're going to a fucking hot

524
00:30:07.570 --> 00:30:11.980
<v 3>dog store and they're looking for some insane seven course French dinner.</v>

525
00:30:12.130 --> 00:30:15.010
You're not going to get it stupid.
That's a hot dog.
And hot dogs are cool too.

526
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:18.350
<v 1>You're not going to get it good.
You know,
people don't understand,
man.
Yeah,</v>

527
00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:21.620
you got to fucking Taco Bell.
You're not going to get fucking Salmon Sashimi.

528
00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:26.490
It is what it is.
Smoke a joint,
go sick,
giggle Dun Dun,
Dun,

529
00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:29.480
Dun.
That's it.
That's all you gotta do.
And it's mostly for kids.

530
00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:32.120
So what the fuck's your problem,
man?
It's about little league baseball.

531
00:30:32.121 --> 00:30:36.700
You fucking piece of shit.
You mother fucker.
You bought the fucker.

532
00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:39.680
Yeah.
Now I've got this theory about critics though

533
00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.530
<v 3>and about all this negativity on the Internet,
on the Internet.</v>

534
00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:47.070
I think in some ways it's good because I think it's like a,

535
00:30:47.130 --> 00:30:50.880
it's like getting a little bit of snake venom all the time.
You know,

536
00:30:50.881 --> 00:30:51.970
you get a little bit here,

537
00:30:51.971 --> 00:30:54.480
a little bit there and eventually become immune to snake venom.

538
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.600
Whereas a lot of people who've never experienced anything like criticism on the

539
00:30:57.601 --> 00:31:00.250
Internet from anonymous people just being completely shitty about yet it's

540
00:31:00.270 --> 00:31:02.960
gnarly,
gnarly.
And for a lot of people that are experiencing it,

541
00:31:02.961 --> 00:31:05.340
it's like you've got a jolt to their system.
Like I've seen,

542
00:31:05.341 --> 00:31:07.500
I've met people that have gone through,
you know,

543
00:31:07.501 --> 00:31:10.830
they've got like some internet fame or had some things happen to them and you

544
00:31:10.831 --> 00:31:12.930
can tell like when people have been shit on,

545
00:31:12.931 --> 00:31:16.290
you can tell when like a lot of people have attacked them with hate mail.

546
00:31:16.290 --> 00:31:18.390
It's just like jolts their personality.

547
00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:21.210
So a little bit here and there from Douche bags here and there.

548
00:31:21.330 --> 00:31:24.420
You just gotta realize eventually you come to this sort of a recognition that

549
00:31:24.450 --> 00:31:28.140
the reason why the communicating like that is not really necessarily because

550
00:31:28.141 --> 00:31:30.780
they didn't really,
they responded that way to your product.

551
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.810
A lot of the reason why they're communicating that way is because they're a
mess.

552
00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:38.250
They're a mess as a human being than not that creative and not that special.

553
00:31:38.251 --> 00:31:39.510
They're angry all the time.

554
00:31:39.511 --> 00:31:41.490
Their relationships probably don't work out very well.

555
00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:44.010
They're filled with anxious.
They don't know how to become great.

556
00:31:44.011 --> 00:31:45.900
They want something more than what they are.

557
00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.990
They want to be treated as special even though they don't want to actually do

558
00:31:48.991 --> 00:31:50.190
the work to become special there.

559
00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:52.870
<v 1>Right.
Well it's like with Stan,</v>

560
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:55.110
it's inevitable that you're going to get fucking haters.
Yeah.

561
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.900
Cause I could stand up.
It's like you can't have a great show every,
you know,

562
00:31:57.901 --> 00:32:00.690
like that's when I had started doing stand up and you get to that thing where

563
00:32:00.691 --> 00:32:03.840
it's like you're going to fucking bomb eventually half like you have to.

564
00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:07.760
So I always tell people who want to do stand up.
Like you know it's gonna,

565
00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:11.180
it's fucking hardest as shit and you're going to fucking,
it's not fun.
Yeah.

566
00:32:11.530 --> 00:32:14.310
Hardest part.
The hardest part is not doing well.

567
00:32:14.370 --> 00:32:18.190
There's this like when you feel Joey Diaz says it best,
he said stand up is,

568
00:32:18.570 --> 00:32:22.470
it's the hardest,
easiest thing you love to do.
Right.
The hottest,
easiest thing.

569
00:32:22.471 --> 00:32:25.740
Cause when it's easy,
it's easy.
When it's hot,
it's hard to know.

570
00:32:25.741 --> 00:32:29.580
When he's like Yoga and you get like visit off,
it's so fucking awful.

571
00:32:29.581 --> 00:32:31.590
It's brutal.
I've had that happen.
I've had that happen.

572
00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.290
<v 3>I've eaten shit several times in my life where I was like,
I felt like,</v>

573
00:32:36.410 --> 00:32:40.070
like almost like as low as a dog.
It's like

574
00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:45.140
<v 0>awful dude.
I'm in.
The first time I got booed off stage I was like shell shocked.</v>

575
00:32:45.141 --> 00:32:47.390
Like my hands were shaking.
Like I didn't go.

576
00:32:47.391 --> 00:32:51.410
I didn't go on stage for like a week.
Dude in New York.
It was fucking awful.
Yeah,

577
00:32:51.411 --> 00:32:54.680
it can get you.
Yeah,
it's scary.
And then we'll let you know once you,
you know,

578
00:32:54.681 --> 00:32:59.360
it's a weird thing then that stand up like that negative standup is so painful.

579
00:32:59.361 --> 00:33:02.930
It's very like if you want it to look at it like as a psychological study,

580
00:33:02.931 --> 00:33:07.931
it's a really intriguing topic because what's going on is you are requiring so

581
00:33:08.330 --> 00:33:09.620
much attention.

582
00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:14.420
You were asking for so much energy if so much focus on you that you're actually

583
00:33:14.421 --> 00:33:19.421
standing on a stage with an amplified voice and a spotlight on you and this is

584
00:33:19.581 --> 00:33:22.070
like a big brash step to take.

585
00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:27.460
And if you're eating enough there and people paid money to see you talk and the

586
00:33:28.041 --> 00:33:29.900
the anger swells up inside them,

587
00:33:29.901 --> 00:33:32.890
they want you to know like this is not entertaining.
Yeah,

588
00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.180
that's fuck you fun.

589
00:33:35.190 --> 00:33:38.090
You feel those few are failing at your job.

590
00:33:38.150 --> 00:33:41.810
You were given a job and you're making every bring up shit and you're doing the

591
00:33:41.811 --> 00:33:46.620
fucking opposite and now we're angry and we're fucking turning into a mob.
Yeah,

592
00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:50.630
and we're going to fucking fist you when you're exact opposite man.

593
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.480
If you ever seen a guy say something like super offensive,

594
00:33:53.481 --> 00:33:57.710
like sometimes comics will say something and what they're just trying to do is

595
00:33:57.711 --> 00:34:00.080
just trying to come up with something funny and it,

596
00:34:00.170 --> 00:34:04.580
a lot of it comes out before you've really thought about it and a lot of comics

597
00:34:04.581 --> 00:34:05.660
will like,
you know,
they'll,

598
00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:10.130
they'll try to be like super controversial and they'll say like insulting shit,

599
00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.370
but just it just like the Kramer nigger thing like that.

600
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:17.300
Like he didn't know what he was doing.
He fucked up.
He's an idiot obviously,

601
00:34:17.301 --> 00:34:19.760
but it's like what it was he doing?
He was just taking chances.

602
00:34:19.761 --> 00:34:22.280
He was just seeing what's in the cylinders,
pulling triggers.

603
00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:25.310
He didn't know what he does what these yet bullets and blanks.

604
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:29.210
What do I got here?
I got a rocket.
I'm just fucking panicking and dying up here.

605
00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.320
And people were yelling at them that you suck you a funny look.
We have a nigger.

606
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:35.900
He just,
yeah.
Oh.
And then he's committed to it.
He's like,

607
00:34:35.901 --> 00:34:39.770
I'm just going to go with this.
This is my new sketch.
That,
by the way,

608
00:34:39.771 --> 00:34:42.950
for people who want to do stand up,
don't push that panic button.

609
00:34:44.630 --> 00:34:48.680
That's the wrong button on the Kramer.
Pushed was one on one run state.

610
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:53.150
Every other button is literally take a shit on the stage,

611
00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:55.280
pull your pants down,
take a shit,

612
00:34:55.310 --> 00:35:00.310
throw it at someone like a fucking monkey but did not do not drop a fucking and

613
00:35:01.431 --> 00:35:05.270
Butler on sewage.
Oh yeah,
you gotta be real careful with that one.
God.

614
00:35:05.271 --> 00:35:09.110
And it was funny cause then Kramer tried to do it with like Kramer mannerisms or

615
00:35:09.111 --> 00:35:09.771
it was just like,

616
00:35:09.771 --> 00:35:14.450
I dunno Kramer not where he was doing a lot of weird shit on stage.

617
00:35:14.451 --> 00:35:18.250
It was really strange.
He was coming to the comedy store a lot and uh,

618
00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:21.500
it was real weird because he didn't really like talk to anybody,
you know,

619
00:35:21.740 --> 00:35:22.910
who's just kind of odd,

620
00:35:22.911 --> 00:35:26.360
you know how he's hanging out and he would do like these weird like pratfalls

621
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:29.900
and sketches and stuff on stage.
It was very strange.
I got into a fight with him.

622
00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.260
Did you really?
Yeah.
About what I want to Improv one night.

623
00:35:33.261 --> 00:35:37.150
And I walked in the showroom and it was like a pretty full crowd and he was on

624
00:35:37.151 --> 00:35:38.070
stage.
This is a week

625
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:42.270
<v 1>before fucking n extravaganza happened.</v>

626
00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:46.920
So he's onstage and he's melting dot melting the fuck.

627
00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:52.140
Talking about the war.
There was no jokes and he just was like getting like dark.

628
00:35:52.141 --> 00:35:54.030
And the crowd was like super uncomfortable.

629
00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.930
And so I tried to show her manager and I go give him the fucking light.

630
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:00.450
And he goes,
no,
it's,
I can't,
it's Michael Richards.
I go,

631
00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:02.610
give them the fucking light.
And he goes,
no.
And I go,

632
00:36:02.611 --> 00:36:06.670
I'm all give him the fucking light.
So I started fucking flashing the light.
Wow.

633
00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:08.310
And he looks at the light and he looks over at the booth.

634
00:36:08.311 --> 00:36:11.970
He looks at me and I would just kept flashing the light and he fucking got off.

635
00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000
And we,
uh,
after,
after,
after a minute,
and I grabbed the mic and I go,

636
00:36:15.001 --> 00:36:18.600
bring me on after him,
I wasn't going to go on,
but I go bring me on.

637
00:36:18.750 --> 00:36:19.770
And they were like,
oh,
okay.

638
00:36:20.100 --> 00:36:23.070
So then they brought me right up and he's passing me as he's walking on stage.

639
00:36:23.071 --> 00:36:25.800
He's like,
who the fuck?
Give me the line.
I go,
I gave you the fucking light.

640
00:36:25.801 --> 00:36:27.930
And I went on stage and did a fucking half hour.

641
00:36:28.260 --> 00:36:31.080
So the crowd had a fucking good show,
you know what I mean?
Like,

642
00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:35.580
and he was yelling in the back of the room is fucking livid.
And I just,
and I,

643
00:36:35.581 --> 00:36:36.630
and I fucking go.

644
00:36:36.900 --> 00:36:40.530
I'm sorry that you guys had to fucking see that I fucking sense for Michael

645
00:36:40.540 --> 00:36:43.710
results.
I go,
I go,
you know,
it didn't fucking pay to,

646
00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.940
this dude was holding them fucking prisoner.
No jokes was yelling at them like,

647
00:36:47.941 --> 00:36:51.570
be rating this crowd.
I was like,
whoa,
fuck you bro.

648
00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:55.800
And then a week later he got fucking that.
That was that.
The whole end thing.

649
00:36:55.801 --> 00:36:56.400
Right.

650
00:36:56.400 --> 00:37:00.280
<v 2>Thank you.
Is gacked up on something?
I do.
I saw him that night that you went to.</v>

651
00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.550
I Dunno dude.
He was from,
he thought he was ganged up on something.
He,

652
00:37:03.770 --> 00:37:05.360
you saw him at the comedy store,
right?

653
00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:08.960
What happened is he went to the comedy store first and before you went to the

654
00:37:08.961 --> 00:37:13.430
laugh factory and he brought this a friend of his and they were just acting

655
00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:18.170
really fucked up.
And then he went on stage,
ate shit.
And I was like telling you,

656
00:37:18.171 --> 00:37:21.590
I called you,
I said something like,
dude,
uh,
Kramer,

657
00:37:21.591 --> 00:37:24.890
Michael Richards was just here,
man,
you should see he was fucked up and he,

658
00:37:24.891 --> 00:37:26.190
you know,
all this other crap.
Yeah.

659
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:28.130
You said he had a meltdown and then Brent earns,

660
00:37:28.131 --> 00:37:32.060
drove from the laugh factory comedy store need to told the whole story to

661
00:37:32.061 --> 00:37:34.070
everybody.
Wow.
And everybody was like,
well,

662
00:37:34.071 --> 00:37:35.510
we thought that was going to be the end of it though.

663
00:37:35.510 --> 00:37:37.940
We had no idea that was gonna be a video of it.
He goes,
dude,
you know,

664
00:37:37.941 --> 00:37:40.280
Brenner and schools into this fucking whole story about him.
Like he's,

665
00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:43.730
she's on stage drop at the end bomb.
I'm freaking the fuck out.

666
00:37:43.731 --> 00:37:47.570
He's calling these guys not just dropping the Emma calling these guys calling.

667
00:37:47.571 --> 00:37:52.340
Look,
here's there are niggers.
Yeah.
Pointing.
It was like,
whoa.

668
00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:56.930
And we were all,
we were all super big too.
So it seems so surreal.

669
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:59.690
It didn't seem real at all.
When you hear a story like that,
you're like what?

670
00:37:59.750 --> 00:38:04.750
Kramer said this Kramer Southern Way Uhf is on my favorite movies.

671
00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:08.750
Yeah,
me too.
Me Too.
I'm sorry I can't give a shout out to UHF.

672
00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:13.670
It's weird when those guys go from being on a sitcom to not being on a sitcom

673
00:38:13.671 --> 00:38:15.280
anymore and then trying to do standup,

674
00:38:15.350 --> 00:38:19.850
which is you go from this world where the fake producer laugh.

675
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:22.100
Like when you're doing a sitcom and you do like run throughs,

676
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:25.040
everyone laughs at their own jokes.
So you're like,
Mike,

677
00:38:25.130 --> 00:38:27.200
what kind of a can is that?

678
00:38:29.810 --> 00:38:32.780
It's like everyone laughs in the background because the producers want the

679
00:38:32.781 --> 00:38:35.930
network to think that what you're saying is so hilarious.
I gets

680
00:38:35.980 --> 00:38:38.280
<v 0>so bad sometimes like when you're doing reshoots that it's,</v>

681
00:38:38.281 --> 00:38:39.640
it's actually distracting.

682
00:38:39.850 --> 00:38:42.310
Like when you have to reshoot a scene where something didn't work right.

683
00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:44.290
And so when they,
the shoot a scene,

684
00:38:44.291 --> 00:38:46.580
like they don't have an audience sometimes will,

685
00:38:46.610 --> 00:38:48.970
we would do it like on news radio until like two o'clock in the morning.

686
00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:53.410
And so you would do it and then you'd hear
is gross,

687
00:38:53.411 --> 00:38:56.280
fake laugh from the producers or from the right.
Right.

688
00:38:57.070 --> 00:39:00.460
So they go from that world where like everybody laughs at everything you say.

689
00:39:00.461 --> 00:39:03.050
Would you like another Bagel?
This done magic land.
Yeah.

690
00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.790
He's just living in this fucking world where he's,
uh,
he's a goddamn king.

691
00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:07.271
You know,

692
00:39:07.271 --> 00:39:10.480
they show up on the set and there's a parking spot with your name on it and

693
00:39:10.481 --> 00:39:13.270
everybody stumbles over themselves to get you coffee.

694
00:39:13.271 --> 00:39:17.760
And would you like a magazine?
What can we do for you,
sir?
I just,
I just,

695
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:20.150
it's so disrespectful,
you know?
Oh,
sue told me.

696
00:39:20.250 --> 00:39:23.530
Cause it's like I'm just as a psychological study that,
yeah,
no,
no,
no,
I hear you.

697
00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:26.290
I just,
I hate it when people do that shit where it's like,
I mean,

698
00:39:26.291 --> 00:39:27.190
even like myself,

699
00:39:27.191 --> 00:39:31.480
I took a year off from standup because I didn't have a new act that,
you know,

700
00:39:31.481 --> 00:39:34.090
that I was,
I,
that I really was happy with.
I'm working on it right now,

701
00:39:34.091 --> 00:39:38.500
but it's like I am a,
but I not set up for 16 years.
I,
you know,
and I was like,

702
00:39:38.501 --> 00:39:40.090
I'm going to take time off because I'm not ready.

703
00:39:40.330 --> 00:39:43.480
So from other fuckers that go onstage and be like,
yeah,
I'm fucking famous,

704
00:39:43.481 --> 00:39:47.290
I'll just go up and just stand there and fucking try to wing it.

705
00:39:47.291 --> 00:39:50.590
It's like fuck you dude.
You're totally,
totally,
completely agree with you.

706
00:39:50.591 --> 00:39:53.860
And totally side with your,
you know,
decision to like the pump,

707
00:39:53.861 --> 00:39:56.590
the crown off and everything.
But what I'm looking at as a crazy person,

708
00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:00.190
I don't think it's as simple as like,
here's a guy who,
you know,
he just,

709
00:40:00.191 --> 00:40:03.250
you're saying like lack of attention.
Like they need that fill that void of like,

710
00:40:03.251 --> 00:40:05.740
yeah,
he's,
he's broken.
I think there's a pathology there.

711
00:40:05.950 --> 00:40:10.010
I think there's quite a few actors.
There's a pathology and the,
the,

712
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:15.040
the solution to this pathology is attention.
Massive,
massive doses of attention.

713
00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:15.641
You know,

714
00:40:15.641 --> 00:40:20.641
I think there's a lot of people that are famous are crazy and the re the way to

715
00:40:20.651 --> 00:40:21.580
become,
you know,

716
00:40:21.581 --> 00:40:25.030
recognized the way to get what they're looking for is just to be extraordinary.

717
00:40:25.031 --> 00:40:29.290
It's something,
you know,
so look,
I am special.
So whether it's acting,

718
00:40:29.300 --> 00:40:33.490
whether it's singing or their,
whatever it is,
they start out with a pathology,

719
00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:37.390
they start out with,
they've got to fucking psychological disorder.

720
00:40:37.570 --> 00:40:39.430
There's some wiring.
It's fucked up.

721
00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:43.600
I think that's a huge percentage of people that are famous.
Right.
I agree.

722
00:40:43.601 --> 00:40:46.110
And I mean that's what brings on the drug.
And so,
you know,

723
00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:48.160
which I don't partake in.
Never.

724
00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:52.690
I've heard that it's very prominent in the community.
I've heard it too.

725
00:40:53.530 --> 00:40:57.280
I find it events hear about that.
It's not necessarily,
I just smelled it before.

726
00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:01.050
Yeah.
Which part that,
hey did,
did you,
uh,

727
00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:04.930
do you have any time to do stand up right now?
Like you've been like,

728
00:41:04.931 --> 00:41:08.080
it seems like you're in like four movies being made for different TV shows.

729
00:41:08.081 --> 00:41:12.100
Like you're just being worked like crazy.
Are you crazy a man?
It was cool.

730
00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.740
I knock on wood,
I'm very,
I was very,
yeah,
it was a great year.

731
00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:18.130
I don't think you like disappeared for like six months.
It seemed like I did.

732
00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.930
I shot two movies out of town and then,
uh,

733
00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:24.040
but I took a while off stand up and I'm getting back into it.
But you know,
I was,

734
00:41:24.041 --> 00:41:27.820
I could have toured and done more shows,
but I just,
I don't believe in paying,

735
00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:32.230
having people paid to see the same act I just did on fucking TV.

736
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:35.090
What do you,
how do you,
um,
when you do that,
right?

737
00:41:35.091 --> 00:41:37.040
Like everybody's got their own method.

738
00:41:37.041 --> 00:41:40.670
I think Louis Ck is methods the most fascinating.
He does a new one every year.

739
00:41:40.700 --> 00:41:44.900
I don't know how the fuck he does have some am maniac is insane.
We're so hard.

740
00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:49.100
Just works really hard.
I was like,
Brian Regan Gaf again,
like those guys,
right.

741
00:41:49.101 --> 00:41:52.430
So much.
I try to write a lot.
I'm ready for a new special now I have a no,

742
00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:57.560
so it's,
for me,
it's like,
it's been almost two years since I filmed the last one.

743
00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.950
I have enough material now for another one.
Oh,
that's great.
But it's a,

744
00:42:00.951 --> 00:42:04.690
it's tricky,
man.
I'm scared.
I'm gonna release this.
I,

745
00:42:04.691 --> 00:42:06.500
I know I'm going to release this and then I got to go on.

746
00:42:06.501 --> 00:42:10.040
I'm mad writing spree for like four months cause you have like four months from

747
00:42:10.041 --> 00:42:12.990
the time that you film something to the time it actually gets,
you know,

748
00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:16.700
dumping in a ride.
I got to go crazy.
No,
I got shows to do bitch.

749
00:42:16.701 --> 00:42:19.310
I got come and come up some new jokes.
I got to do some mushrooms.

750
00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:25.400
That's the move man.
I need a new uh,
a new level.
Need to hit a new level.

751
00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:29.990
Yeah.
I just zone out next level.
Shit.
Crazy shit while I'm driving.

752
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.490
That helps.
I never,
I never sit down and write it.
Drive with no,
uh,
no music on,

753
00:42:34.491 --> 00:42:38.690
right?
Yeah.
I'll just fucking zone out and fucking take a crazy shit.
Yeah.

754
00:42:38.691 --> 00:42:41.630
There's something about driving that's almost like meditative.

755
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:44.390
If you have your mind is fucking goes away.
Yeah.

756
00:42:44.391 --> 00:42:46.190
There's like part of your brain and says,
okay,

757
00:42:46.191 --> 00:42:48.860
we only need this amount to pay attention to where we're going.

758
00:42:49.070 --> 00:42:51.300
We need this amount.
Look at all this free brain we got.
Yeah.

759
00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.150
Well what do you want to do?
You want to think about shit.
Okay,

760
00:42:53.151 --> 00:42:55.430
let's think about life.
Hey,
let's think about some with farting.

761
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:58.070
[inaudible] about a new thing about farting.

762
00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.130
Because when you listen to the music,
you know,
which is great.

763
00:43:01.131 --> 00:43:04.250
I love listening to music in my car,
but then you're not thinking as much.

764
00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:08.270
Then you go get another 10% of your brain is occupied with that.
Right,
right.

765
00:43:08.810 --> 00:43:12.000
Or more.
Yeah.
I have like a new half hour.
I'm pretty psyched,
but I need money.

766
00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:15.110
I need a fucking another half hour.
So how do you don't sit down and write,

767
00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.980
you know,
ever.
Right.
I never have really come up with it on the fly.

768
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:21.900
I come up with stuff on the fly or I'll just keep adding,
you know,

769
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:25.640
I'll go up on stage with a premise and then we'll work it out and then just find

770
00:43:25.641 --> 00:43:27.740
more stuff in that premise.
You know,

771
00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.660
your whole act in your head or do you have things written down?
Yes ma'am.

772
00:43:31.130 --> 00:43:34.250
I always write it down.
I'll bring up a little piece of paper.

773
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:39.260
You always write it down before you go up on stage new stuff.
And I put it,
yeah.

774
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:41.810
But I only go on with new stuff.
I mean,

775
00:43:41.870 --> 00:43:45.860
it's rare that you'll see me tell the same,
but what I'm saying is like,
do you,

776
00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.370
do you have any,
do you have your stuff written out anywhere?
Like you have like,

777
00:43:49.400 --> 00:43:52.040
here's my,
you know,
monkey bananas.
Nothing.

778
00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:55.700
You record your shit and listen to it ever.
No,
you should really do that.

779
00:43:55.701 --> 00:43:59.820
That's the best.
That's what I've heard.
I have an iPhone just poured,

780
00:43:59.840 --> 00:44:01.970
listen to it on the way home makes a big difference,
man.

781
00:44:01.971 --> 00:44:04.420
There's so many little taglines that I forgot about that.

782
00:44:04.421 --> 00:44:08.120
That's funny is I forget nuances of fire trucks.

783
00:44:08.930 --> 00:44:12.320
That's annoying,
man.
When you come up with the perfect tag,
it's like perfect.

784
00:44:12.321 --> 00:44:14.390
Then you go with mother fucker.
I'm not recording this show.

785
00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:15.500
It's also embarrassing,

786
00:44:15.501 --> 00:44:17.960
like I don't know if that's ever happened to you when someone reminds you of

787
00:44:17.961 --> 00:44:20.540
like a really good joke that you told one.
Yes,
and I'm like,
oh,

788
00:44:20.541 --> 00:44:23.720
I forgot about that one.
They're like,
Oh,
I love that joke.
It's like,
yeah,

789
00:44:23.721 --> 00:44:27.350
I'm real professional.
I can remember my own fucking jokes.
I'm like,
oh,

790
00:44:27.351 --> 00:44:31.050
I did like that joke.
Yeah.
Thank you for reminding me of my own act.
Yeah,

791
00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:35.100
well cause I'm a fucking idiot.
People will call out request sometimes it shows,

792
00:44:35.101 --> 00:44:38.130
you know,
like,
you know,
at the end of the show I do like a question answer thing.

793
00:44:38.210 --> 00:44:43.110
Oh really?
Yeah.
That's a cool idea.
It's fun.
So much fun.
You know?
And um,
when,

794
00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:46.200
uh,
people will call out beds like two,
I,
Anna Nicole Smith,
I'm like,

795
00:44:46.230 --> 00:44:48.870
I don't even know how to do it.
Right.
Yeah.
I don't know how it goes.

796
00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.870
I know that if you don't know how it goes anymore,
I don't,
I know it was mine.

797
00:44:51.871 --> 00:44:54.780
I know I wrote it.
I don't,
I remember how it goes.

798
00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.110
That's to go listen to it a bunch of times and then practice it and shit.

799
00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:01.520
<v 1>Yeah.
That's the worst whenever I go home to Minnesota because I started there.</v>

800
00:45:01.521 --> 00:45:02.870
So I've done stand there for 16 years.

801
00:45:02.871 --> 00:45:07.830
So people would call out jokes that I told and an open Mike 10,
12,
15 years ago,

802
00:45:07.840 --> 00:45:11.800
like I do the fried chicken bet.
I'm like,
what?
I'm like,
I don't know.

803
00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:15.540
<v 0>That is,
does Minnesota have like a real,
um,
like community,</v>

804
00:45:15.541 --> 00:45:18.960
a standup comedy community gets sick,
find mine.
It's got like,

805
00:45:19.140 --> 00:45:20.580
is that what's one of the bat?
Yeah.

806
00:45:20.581 --> 00:45:23.790
Acme is one of the best comedy clubs in the country.
But yeah,

807
00:45:23.791 --> 00:45:26.120
they've got a good scene there dude.
It's awesome.
You've got,

808
00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:29.720
you've done stand up in Minneapolis.
Yeah.
You can once you came on stage.
Yeah,

809
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:33.990
yeah.
That came on Trump.
But my pants falling off.
It was awesome.

810
00:45:34.020 --> 00:45:36.960
[inaudible] cafe.
That was fun man.
That was cool.
That was,
you know,

811
00:45:36.961 --> 00:45:40.380
you're the only guy who's ever come on stage with me before ever.
Really.

812
00:45:40.410 --> 00:45:43.190
You know?
No one's ever done that before.
Never.
That's a good video.

813
00:45:43.191 --> 00:45:46.320
It was fun Joe Show Minneapolis.
So that was fun.
You killed it.
Great one.

814
00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.900
But they're great crowds.
They were awesome.
Awesome dude.

815
00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.770
I've been wanting to go back and do a acme cause I keep hearing how amazing acne

816
00:45:52.771 --> 00:45:55.490
is.
Everybody says it's like one of the best comedy clothes.
Dude,

817
00:45:55.510 --> 00:45:57.880
you fucking love it.
Everybody says that man,

818
00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.410
there's only a few comedy clubs in the country that totally have it nailed.

819
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:01.951
You know,

820
00:46:01.951 --> 00:46:05.530
like there's the comedy works in Denver and you know there's a few other ones.

821
00:46:05.580 --> 00:46:08.270
They still do that fucking early show though.
I hate the early show.

822
00:46:08.290 --> 00:46:13.130
I don't have to do it dude.
There's a three shows on Saturday.
I do now.

823
00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:16.140
I can't do three shows anyway.
I don't fucking know.

824
00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:20.040
I can't do that too is all I can.
If I did a third,
I'd just be greedy.
You know,

825
00:46:20.041 --> 00:46:22.050
it'd be given a half ass show.
It's not the same.

826
00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:26.730
You're exhausted to two hours of,
you know,
after that is over man.

827
00:46:26.810 --> 00:46:29.990
<v 1>The last column I did was the Chicago Improv.
You did three.</v>

828
00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:35.260
I did know I did Thursday to Friday to Saturday and one Sunday and I looked like

829
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:38.060
fucking Betty White

830
00:46:38.130 --> 00:46:42.010
<v 0>the fucking Sunday.
I partied</v>

831
00:46:42.010 --> 00:46:43.650
<v 1>so hard I can't even do it at do.</v>

832
00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:47.440
It's so hard to go into a club because I went in early and went to like cubs

833
00:46:47.441 --> 00:46:52.290
games and just got fucking twisted dude.
So I came in out of the gate.
It's just,

834
00:46:52.291 --> 00:46:55.450
it's like so hard dude.
Cause people get fucking,

835
00:46:55.451 --> 00:46:58.150
like my fans are fucking crazy.
Like,

836
00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:01.690
I'll get two shots on stage anymore.
I cut all that stuff out.

837
00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:05.480
Really just because the flood gates,
it just turns into it.
I can get dangerous.

838
00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:08.230
Yeah.
I did it at Caroline's wants and it was a huge mistake.
Oh No.

839
00:47:08.231 --> 00:47:12.160
At one time I was a minute in Minneapolis and I was like just on a bender and I

840
00:47:12.161 --> 00:47:15.070
fucking grabbed the waitress.
I go,
Hey,
can I get a drink on stage?
She was like,

841
00:47:15.071 --> 00:47:19.400
yeah,
what do you want?
I go,
can I get sick shots of Tequila all by the way,

842
00:47:19.450 --> 00:47:23.620
all for me.
The crowd looks at me.
It's fucking horrified.

843
00:47:24.070 --> 00:47:25.240
Like I thought people can be like,
Yay.

844
00:47:25.241 --> 00:47:28.060
And they were just staring at me and then I just realized like I looked like

845
00:47:28.061 --> 00:47:32.080
such an alcoholic.
So then I made the another great choice of going,

846
00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:36.490
does anybody want to do these with me?
And just was like,
oh,
so wow.
Yeah,

847
00:47:36.491 --> 00:47:41.090
but it was pretty funny.
I saw Joe Meltdown in Vegas.
How long is it?

848
00:47:41.110 --> 00:47:41.943
21 shot.

849
00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:46.490
<v 3>Sorry.
It's grown in stature over the years.
I don't know how many.
It was lean.</v>

850
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:50.000
At least 13 tequila.
We knows lease 30 it was all kinds of stuff.

851
00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:54.650
I threw up into a garbage can.
I've started off stage.
I was so hammered on stage,

852
00:47:54.651 --> 00:47:57.860
I couldn't remember jokes.
I couldn't talk.
It was ridiculous.

853
00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:03.490
I get off stage and throw up into a garbage can and I remember not believing how

854
00:48:03.891 --> 00:48:07.610
much liquid was coming out of my body.
Like this doesn't even make sense.

855
00:48:07.611 --> 00:48:11.030
Like this is like what?
This is like a broken fire hydrants on it.

856
00:48:11.060 --> 00:48:12.830
It was like a pie eating scene

857
00:48:13.170 --> 00:48:14.800
<v 1>and stand by me,
stand by me.</v>

858
00:48:15.690 --> 00:48:20.400
Cartoonish amount of liquid was horrible.
I have photos but they were lost.

859
00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:23.190
Dude already landed one fucking girls as things I've seen.

860
00:48:23.700 --> 00:48:27.630
He went to the show in Vegas and uh,
I was hanging out with them and somebody,

861
00:48:27.631 --> 00:48:29.070
he was like,
Sam,
you have any Jack?

862
00:48:29.071 --> 00:48:33.980
And someone threw a Luke warm fucking bottle of Jack on stage,

863
00:48:34.520 --> 00:48:37.680
lukewarm already,
pours it into a fucking big glass,

864
00:48:37.681 --> 00:48:42.240
takes a straw and sucks the whole thing down.
Oh,
it was probably,
it was,

865
00:48:42.250 --> 00:48:45.990
what's not a pint or what the fuck is it?
Those are like flasks,
like glass,

866
00:48:45.991 --> 00:48:49.530
fuck it,
whatever.
I'm not sure that that was real.
That might,
it wasn't a plant.

867
00:48:49.560 --> 00:48:51.660
It was I,
cause I was like,
it's gotta be a plant.
No,

868
00:48:51.661 --> 00:48:55.710
because he opened up the seal and everything was,
it was like a brand new bottle.

869
00:48:55.770 --> 00:48:59.250
Wow.
Whoa.
And chugged it.
I almost did.
I almost threw up watching it.

870
00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.590
That jacket's hard.
Luke warm.

871
00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:06.310
<v 3>How bad did that affect you when that Artie Lange thing went down when he tried</v>

872
00:49:06.311 --> 00:49:07.144
to commit suicide?

873
00:49:07.870 --> 00:49:11.650
<v 1>Oh,
it was terrible,
man.
I was really,
I mean,
yeah,
it was fucked up.</v>

874
00:49:11.700 --> 00:49:15.390
<v 3>Do you connect yourself?
Like when you have friends that are comics and you know,</v>

875
00:49:15.391 --> 00:49:18.900
comics and they do they do things in the commit suicide and shit like that?

876
00:49:18.901 --> 00:49:21.930
Like does that,
uh,
how,
how does that freak you out?

877
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:26.310
<v 1>I get really,
really emotional,
really emotional.
Greg Giraldo was really,</v>

878
00:49:26.311 --> 00:49:30.870
really good friend.
Mitch Hedberg was a good friend.
I mean,
I was,
I mean,

879
00:49:30.871 --> 00:49:34.440
I cried for a long time when Mitch died.
It was fucking awful.
Dude.

880
00:49:34.470 --> 00:49:38.700
I'll never forget that.
I just,
it was terrible.
And he was to me,
Greg,

881
00:49:38.730 --> 00:49:42.510
unique talent.
Oh yeah.
But Greg,
I was devastated when Greg died.
I mean,

882
00:49:42.511 --> 00:49:45.260
I've known,
I've known Greg,
he was one of the first comics I've ever,
I'm at.

883
00:49:45.261 --> 00:49:49.950
So we were friends 15 years ago.
He's was my first friend in New York.
I mean,

884
00:49:49.951 --> 00:49:52.620
yeah,
I mean I party hard,
you know what I mean?
But it's like,
you know,

885
00:49:53.490 --> 00:49:55.440
those guys were on another level,

886
00:49:56.470 --> 00:49:59.850
<v 3>you know,
he'll guys,
the guys who will just grab pills,
you know,
I was at,
uh,</v>

887
00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:02.530
at the comedy store one night and a buddy of mine came to see me and he goes,

888
00:50:02.531 --> 00:50:07.240
hey man,
you want an oxy?
I keep it.
Yeah.
I was like,
what are you giving me?
Heroin?

889
00:50:07.360 --> 00:50:11.860
You're going to give me a heroin pill.
What the fuck,
dude?
You know,

890
00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:14.580
what is going on?
That's it.
That's another level of partying.
That pillow.

891
00:50:14.850 --> 00:50:17.600
<v 1>Yeah.
Like there's another level.
I mean,
yeah,
I fucking drank and shit,</v>

892
00:50:17.601 --> 00:50:20.720
but it's like,
there's another,
a whole nother dimension.
But

893
00:50:20.810 --> 00:50:22.760
<v 3>some guys,
man,
you know,
it's like,
you know,</v>

894
00:50:22.761 --> 00:50:27.140
it's like what happened in Vegas like after like six shots,
like you're,

895
00:50:27.530 --> 00:50:29.120
you're gone.
The guns Ville,
you know,

896
00:50:29.121 --> 00:50:32.210
if you took something and then the take something that leads to more bad

897
00:50:32.211 --> 00:50:35.120
judgment and then somebody offers you something else and you throw that in the

898
00:50:35.121 --> 00:50:37.850
mix too.
And who else wants to join the party?
You know,
you're just,

899
00:50:37.851 --> 00:50:40.730
you're already down.
I'm not thinking well land,
you know,

900
00:50:40.731 --> 00:50:43.880
you're already intoxicated.
You're fucked up.
You're drunk,

901
00:50:43.881 --> 00:50:46.460
you're high on something,
whatever it is,
cause it's causing you.

902
00:50:46.610 --> 00:50:50.780
That's why I get so mad when people connect pot with any of those other drugs

903
00:50:51.020 --> 00:50:54.420
because pot does the exact,
that sucked,
that connect.

904
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:56.600
It makes you super paranoid.

905
00:50:56.601 --> 00:50:59.600
You don't start thinking your superman and you'll fucking take drugs.

906
00:50:59.750 --> 00:51:01.490
Somebody gives you some pills.
Like what the fuck is that?

907
00:51:01.491 --> 00:51:02.720
He could have by trying to poison me.

908
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:04.570
He might be working for the government and they,

909
00:51:04.571 --> 00:51:06.710
you start thinking a million different retarded things.

910
00:51:06.830 --> 00:51:09.350
You don't think you fucking give it to me on ticket.

911
00:51:09.530 --> 00:51:10.550
What's the last thing you think?

912
00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:13.060
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean I've never took a hit of a joint and then been like,</v>

913
00:51:13.390 --> 00:51:16.390
we gotta get coke.
It's like nobody ever does.

914
00:51:16.550 --> 00:51:19.950
<v 3>Pod is the anti gateway truck.
It's the exact opposite.</v>

915
00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:24.390
It gets you paranoid and makes you humble and it makes you not want to do all

916
00:51:24.391 --> 00:51:27.030
those other drugs cause you don't want to fucking die cause you want to hug your

917
00:51:27.031 --> 00:51:29.520
mom because you forgot to tell your lover,
you know,

918
00:51:29.521 --> 00:51:31.430
and you start thinking about your friends and man hours.

919
00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:33.930
It should be just like more generous or something.

920
00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:36.420
I need to be a nicer need to be a nicer person.

921
00:51:36.421 --> 00:51:40.000
And then those are the messages of marijuana.
Marijuana is the,
the happy

922
00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:45.290
<v 1>oozes the fucking killer dude.
Yeah.
You could be totally a,
yeah,</v>

923
00:51:45.350 --> 00:51:47.090
but that's the blood in the toilet.

924
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:50.270
<v 3>But booze is responsible for a lot of fun.
I love you can't,</v>

925
00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:51.320
you can't hate on boots.

926
00:51:51.580 --> 00:51:54.370
<v 1>I think it's like people will like on my Facebook and stuff like,</v>

927
00:51:54.371 --> 00:51:58.330
and people I know or like try to like intervene like I have a problem.

928
00:51:58.331 --> 00:51:59.980
You know when people are like,
Hey,
you're fucking alcoholic,

929
00:51:59.981 --> 00:52:03.670
you're destroying yourself.
It's like,
first of all,
I drank.
I drank every weekend.

930
00:52:03.790 --> 00:52:06.190
Yes I do.
I'm not the only one at the bars.

931
00:52:06.220 --> 00:52:08.980
It's not fucking an empty room that I'm drinking it.
You know what I mean?

932
00:52:08.981 --> 00:52:12.130
Like people don't understand like you can go out and have fun.

933
00:52:12.131 --> 00:52:16.330
I don't drink because I'm sad.
I like,
I love drinking,
I love going out.

934
00:52:16.331 --> 00:52:18.670
It's like the best to be like,
I fucking have a blast.

935
00:52:18.671 --> 00:52:20.410
So like people don't understand that though.

936
00:52:20.411 --> 00:52:23.260
They like if I had to be sober for a year,
I could,
you know what I mean?

937
00:52:23.261 --> 00:52:25.070
It's not like I would freaking figures just the bottom

938
00:52:25.070 --> 00:52:29.040
<v 3>line.
You are not going to live forever.
Even if you eat fucking sprouts,</v>

939
00:52:29.210 --> 00:52:32.000
literally,
you're not gonna live forever.
It's not going to happen.

940
00:52:32.210 --> 00:52:34.820
And boost is fun.
You know the,
if you're,

941
00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.270
if you're partying with a bunch of friends and you do a few shots and everybody

942
00:52:38.271 --> 00:52:41.740
gets lifted and they all start laughing,
you're fucking asses off as long as you,

943
00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:43.570
with good drunks.
Honestly,

944
00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:45.860
you're not with people that become assholes when they get drunk,

945
00:52:46.010 --> 00:52:46.850
which by the way,

946
00:52:46.851 --> 00:52:51.350
there's a new study that just came out today where they linked a gene that was

947
00:52:51.351 --> 00:52:56.300
my elbow.
Oh Wow.
She's,
nope,
I didn't even flinch.
I'm a hard man.

948
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:57.770
Okay.
Anyway,

949
00:52:57.771 --> 00:53:01.130
there's a study that came out that said that there's a gene that they've

950
00:53:01.131 --> 00:53:05.510
isolated that causes violent behavior in some men when they drink,

951
00:53:05.690 --> 00:53:08.830
like it's actually a gene.
Oh really?
Yeah.
Like they think that like,
you know,

952
00:53:09.050 --> 00:53:10.400
dude,
we have friends,
you know,

953
00:53:10.401 --> 00:53:14.000
we know people that drink and just become a totally different person.

954
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:17.780
Now they're saying like there's a reason for this.
Like the,

955
00:53:17.890 --> 00:53:21.890
there's like certain people have certain genetics links and make them respond a

956
00:53:21.891 --> 00:53:24.950
certain way.
Yeah,
I can see that.
Yeah.
So in that sense,

957
00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.160
booze is not for everybody,

958
00:53:26.190 --> 00:53:29.130
<v 0>but nothing's for everybody,
right?
Yeah.
Nothing is for everybody.</v>

959
00:53:29.310 --> 00:53:33.150
Some people can't eat peanuts.
Some people can paint.
It's some people,

960
00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.340
some people are allergic to wheat.
Just stick to wine.

961
00:53:35.341 --> 00:53:39.450
Some people can't look at fucking a dolphin.
[inaudible] know what happened.

962
00:53:39.451 --> 00:53:41.180
I don't know if that happens,
but that might,

963
00:53:41.370 --> 00:53:44.770
I think they fucking shit their pants or something.
They shit their pants.
Yeah.

964
00:53:45.450 --> 00:53:46.770
I knew this girl that you can't,

965
00:53:46.830 --> 00:53:50.550
she can't see somebody put cotton in their mouth.
I can't touch the cotton.

966
00:53:50.640 --> 00:53:54.390
You can.
I get really uncomfortable.
You have no cotton balls.
Cotton balls.

967
00:53:54.391 --> 00:53:57.330
Like just straight cotton.
Like it gives me like,
Whoa,
what is that about?

968
00:53:57.331 --> 00:54:00.840
I don't know.
Which just makes you uncomfortable.
Really?
Yeah.
Whoa.

969
00:54:01.230 --> 00:54:05.590
So that way I can fucking do heroin.
So are you scared of Q tips though?
Uh,

970
00:54:06.190 --> 00:54:11.100
cotton?
Yeah.
Like cotton balls if you just like,
Eh,
really?
You right?

971
00:54:11.101 --> 00:54:13.530
Yeah.
Wow.
See,
I don't think I have anything like that.

972
00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:16.350
I wish I had something like that though.
Something really crazy.
Yeah,

973
00:54:16.530 --> 00:54:17.480
something really cool.

974
00:54:18.910 --> 00:54:20.440
<v 1>Speaking of partying,
I was talking,</v>

975
00:54:20.441 --> 00:54:23.650
I was telling Joe's story about Chris Leben was a friend of mine who fights up

976
00:54:23.651 --> 00:54:28.640
on new years.
And,
uh,
this is one matches.
Can I tell it real quick?
Yeah,
please.
Um,

977
00:54:28.690 --> 00:54:33.460
so I did a show in Hawaii on Oahu and I was a fan of Lievens and,
uh,

978
00:54:33.461 --> 00:54:36.250
so I was like,
I contacted him.
I'm like,
Hey,
you wanna come out to the show?

979
00:54:36.550 --> 00:54:39.850
So he's like,
yes.
He comes out to the show and Michael's get fucking drunk.

980
00:54:39.851 --> 00:54:43.570
And he's like,
no.
And I'm like,
why?
He goes,
because I just,
I,
once I go there,

981
00:54:43.571 --> 00:54:46.900
it's just the wheels come off and I go,
fuck you.
I gold strike.
He's like,
no.

982
00:54:47.350 --> 00:54:50.170
So I'm in Hawaii for a week.
Every night I call Lee,
but I'm like,

983
00:54:50.171 --> 00:54:53.400
you're a fucking con.
Let's fucking drink every night.
He's like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,

984
00:54:53.401 --> 00:54:56.500
no.
Finally the last night,
he's like,
you know what?
You want to go big?
And I go,

985
00:54:56.501 --> 00:54:59.140
yeah,
let's go fucking big.
And he's like,
all right,
I'll go big.

986
00:54:59.530 --> 00:55:03.850
Literally it was like a movie cut to Lehman,
blacked out,
choked.

987
00:55:03.880 --> 00:55:07.720
Two of my friends out at Dave and busters on the floor,
foaming at the mouth.

988
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:11.830
Everyone's like screaming.
He got me in a fucking show called roughly like,
uh,

989
00:55:12.130 --> 00:55:15.220
some leg lock around my neck.
I'm gonna started fucking crying.

990
00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:19.600
It was like complete mayhem.
Everyone was fucking terrified.

991
00:55:20.110 --> 00:55:22.990
And the next day he was like,
I fucking told you dude.
And I was like,
yeah,

992
00:55:22.991 --> 00:55:24.250
that's my fault too.
Wow.

993
00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:28.450
This was like I'm leaving out a lot of shit cause it's just like turning up

994
00:55:28.510 --> 00:55:30.500
Armageddon.
That's awful.

995
00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.680
Like thank God his girlfriend was there and she was the only person that can

996
00:55:33.681 --> 00:55:36.940
fucking talk him down.
And it was like a werewolf.
Listen to me man.

997
00:55:36.941 --> 00:55:41.380
When a guy who's a cage fighter for live tells you you don't want to see me

998
00:55:41.381 --> 00:55:44.670
drunk.
I know.
[inaudible] I know I'm such a fucking moron.
Rust.

999
00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:47.300
And I was like a little fucking mosquito and this was like three

1000
00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:48.753
<v 7>woo.</v>

1001
00:55:51.470 --> 00:55:55.460
<v 0>Just cuts it like me,
like terrified.
Oh my God dude.
Yeah.</v>

1002
00:55:55.461 --> 00:55:58.810
But with Joe and I were talking about partying with fighters and stuff because

1003
00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:03.440
I'm a big MMA fan,
you UFC and I party with a lot of those dudes and it's just,

1004
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:06.900
we have the famous mayhem story.
You were there for the mayhem still?
Yeah,

1005
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:08.150
it's the first time I met him.

1006
00:56:08.690 --> 00:56:13.070
We went to sky bar across the street and we walk into the sky bar in,

1007
00:56:13.071 --> 00:56:16.340
suddenly he looks over and sees this like a bed.

1008
00:56:16.341 --> 00:56:18.650
You know how they have beds there with like eight girls,

1009
00:56:18.651 --> 00:56:22.310
I'll drink and wine and he's like gets to do a body flop.

1010
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:24.210
So he runs charges,
jumps,

1011
00:56:24.211 --> 00:56:28.570
does a body flap on it and I just see wineglasses flying in the air and red

1012
00:56:28.571 --> 00:56:32.100
Merlow flying on all these people too.
And I just grabbed Joe,

1013
00:56:32.110 --> 00:56:35.020
me and Joe went around the corner and was just like,
what the fuck?
I'm like,

1014
00:56:35.021 --> 00:56:38.830
and we were like trying to distance ourselves and we look around the corner and

1015
00:56:38.831 --> 00:56:39.151
then he had,

1016
00:56:39.151 --> 00:56:42.040
he's getting taken out by security but we didn't quite go with the quote.

1017
00:56:42.041 --> 00:56:45.280
We backed up to the bar but we couldn't believe what he did.
He just,

1018
00:56:45.370 --> 00:56:48.850
we were joking around about something and he had this be just made this big lap

1019
00:56:50.070 --> 00:56:55.040
and then he back swan dived like backwards pop into this pile of people,

1020
00:56:55.350 --> 00:56:57.980
you know,
and he's fucking 200 and something pounds and he's,
you know,
he's,

1021
00:56:58.060 --> 00:56:59.620
it's a big fucking strong dude.

1022
00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:03.370
He's just one of those things where should have thought about it for a second

1023
00:57:03.371 --> 00:57:05.530
and then he wouldn't have done it.
And [inaudible] it goes back.

1024
00:57:05.531 --> 00:57:08.590
I partied with chat a lot and he's a buddy.
That doesn't surprise me.

1025
00:57:08.591 --> 00:57:11.590
He fucking does.
You know what's most shocking thing about that dude?

1026
00:57:11.590 --> 00:57:14.830
Not that he's,
you know,
an excellent fighter.
He's a really good writer.

1027
00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:16.510
He writes really well.

1028
00:57:16.511 --> 00:57:19.270
Like if you ever read his articles that he writes for fight magazine,
no.

1029
00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:23.450
Very smart guy,
man.
He's very bright and they're,
they're,
they're really,

1030
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:27.910
they're self deprecating.
They're interesting.
They're,
he's serving,
he's very,

1031
00:57:27.911 --> 00:57:32.450
very observative.
Is that a word observer?
Observatory?
Is that a word?
I Dunno.

1032
00:57:32.510 --> 00:57:36.040
[inaudible] observative yes.
This one word,

1033
00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:40.960
observational apps or video.
He's makes great observations.
He's a really like,

1034
00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:42.640
and he's like really?
Like,
you know,

1035
00:57:42.641 --> 00:57:44.350
there's a lot of dudes who write about wild shit,

1036
00:57:44.351 --> 00:57:48.220
but they're not live in a wildlife.
He's truly live in a wildlife.

1037
00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.210
I mean it's a fucking professional cage fighter,
right?
Yeah.

1038
00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:55.260
And a very bright guy and a good writer.
So his stuff is interesting,
you know,

1039
00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:59.200
it's like here's a guy that's like talking and walking it,
man.
You know.

1040
00:57:59.410 --> 00:58:03.070
I remember I met him out at a club one night and he showed up with a fur coat,

1041
00:58:03.071 --> 00:58:07.350
no shirt underneath and two Asian girls on his arms and sound glasses.

1042
00:58:07.370 --> 00:58:10.210
I was like,
what the fuck are you doing?

1043
00:58:10.300 --> 00:58:14.130
And nicest guy you ever want to hang out with.
So Nice sometimes actually can.

1044
00:58:14.140 --> 00:58:16.930
Cool guy.
I was with Jay on fucking,

1045
00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:21.700
that's was it this weekend then missed his birthday on the day after Christmas.

1046
00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:24.400
Yeah.
And he goes,
I'm having a birthday party.
And I just was like,

1047
00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:27.640
I'm not going to that party.
Like I made the conscious choice.

1048
00:58:27.641 --> 00:58:32.500
I knew that it would be like once you're pot committed to that shit dude,
it is.

1049
00:58:32.501 --> 00:58:35.030
The wheels can come off.
Jay was like fire.

1050
00:58:35.070 --> 00:58:38.500
You could tell like his energy was just like through the roof.
I was like,
oh no,

1051
00:58:38.800 --> 00:58:43.200
but happy birthday Jay Levine.
He's a wild motherfucker.
I love that dude.

1052
00:58:43.550 --> 00:58:47.170
He's a crazy dude.
It's interesting having people like that in the world,

1053
00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:50.260
you know?
You know,
everybody tries to put everybody in a neat little box,

1054
00:58:50.261 --> 00:58:51.730
you know,
and then try to like,
you know,

1055
00:58:51.731 --> 00:58:54.400
here's the guy that's like this guy and that guy was like this guy and that

1056
00:58:54.401 --> 00:58:56.740
guy's every now and then you meet someone like mayhem and you go,

1057
00:58:56.770 --> 00:58:58.540
oh look at this mother fucker.
Where do you put him?

1058
00:58:58.690 --> 00:59:02.830
Where's what box is there for him?
It doesn't exist.
These super funny to,

1059
00:59:03.050 --> 00:59:04.320
very funny man.
I'm trying to get him to do,

1060
00:59:04.360 --> 00:59:06.520
he's doing stand up at the Improv soon I think.

1061
00:59:06.521 --> 00:59:09.130
Or is he really all he fucking did it and then call me.
I was so passed.

1062
00:59:09.131 --> 00:59:11.500
We did Ari show.
He did it.
He did a storyteller show.

1063
00:59:11.501 --> 00:59:15.610
He did Ari show and he said it was great.
So he went right.
Oh that's cool.
Yeah,

1064
00:59:15.611 --> 00:59:17.860
he's,
he's,
yeah,
I think it was very smart guy,
man.

1065
00:59:17.861 --> 00:59:21.200
He can do anything he sets his mind to.
Yeah.
I think he'd be a funny stand up.

1066
00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:22.130
He totally was telling

1067
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:26.960
<v 1>me.
He told some jokes that didn't work or no,
he said Faggot onstage.</v>

1068
00:59:27.190 --> 00:59:30.350
It was a doing something.
We just kept saying faggot and he's like,
yeah,

1069
00:59:30.351 --> 00:59:32.240
the crowd didn't go with me on it.
I'm like,
yeah,

1070
00:59:32.320 --> 00:59:36.730
<v 3>some tough.
And the club was in West Hollywood brow,
a little tough,
you know,</v>

1071
00:59:36.731 --> 00:59:39.370
he said he's going to stop saying that word too.
We had them on the podcast.

1072
00:59:39.371 --> 00:59:42.850
He talked about,
not saying faggot anymore,
but I mean the fact

1073
00:59:43.070 --> 00:59:47.550
<v 1>word that I've a new bit my act about where I'd say that faggots shouldn't be,</v>

1074
00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:49.930
do use to describe gay people.
It should be used to describe cats.

1075
00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:54.720
<v 3>When can she is aware of such fucking faggots.
It's just bullshit.</v>

1076
00:59:54.721 --> 00:59:57.240
Love it.
You know what I mean?
It's a great word.

1077
00:59:57.241 --> 00:59:59.730
Unfortunate such a fucking good word,
but it's like right word,

1078
00:59:59.731 --> 01:00:03.000
but it's such a hot topic.
You know?
It's touchy about it,

1079
01:00:03.230 --> 01:00:05.860
<v 1>but it's like,
if you don't,
if you don't point at,</v>

1080
01:00:05.900 --> 01:00:09.230
I've fucking gated and be like Yara off.
Fuck.
I like,
that's offensive.

1081
01:00:09.231 --> 01:00:12.200
You know what I mean?
But if you're like,
yeah,
my truck,

1082
01:00:12.201 --> 01:00:13.490

1083
01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:17.570
<v 3>Yeah.
You know what I mean?
Like why is that a,
it's problem is,

I know.</v>

1084
01:00:17.571 --> 01:00:21.040
It's like the funniest word to say in that situation.
I mean,
it makes a Jew,

1085
01:00:21.070 --> 01:00:24.310
you know,
if you like,
I used to have this joke where called my dog a faggot.

1086
01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:27.560
Oh really?
Yeah,
because it was about the number,

1087
01:00:27.580 --> 01:00:32.190
that pot commercial with the dog starts talking to the CIC and tells them smoke

1088
01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.960
weed in the jug called the dog a faggot.

1089
01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:39.190
Cause that's like the funniest thing he could say to your dog,
fucking faggot.

1090
01:00:39.220 --> 01:00:43.150
Like,
who are you talking to?
Stupid.
You're telling me to stop smoking weed?
Yeah.

1091
01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:46.810
You're a dog.
He dumb cunt.
Yeah.
It's like if you,
yeah.
If I,
if I,
if I'm,

1092
01:00:46.811 --> 01:00:48.850
if I'm like my shoes a con.
Yeah.

1093
01:00:48.851 --> 01:00:52.690
I've popped my cuts through the roof ever since I stopped saying faggot.

1094
01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:54.220
I've been saying [inaudible] like crazy.

1095
01:00:54.221 --> 01:00:56.500
Everyone's a continent and I'm kind of enjoying it.

1096
01:00:56.650 --> 01:01:01.570
That's a tough one to pull off on stage,
so it's fine.
Let it go.

1097
01:01:02.070 --> 01:01:05.820
Nah,
I called people content stage all the time.
There's that.

1098
01:01:05.821 --> 01:01:07.540
You know what if it really,
if you,

1099
01:01:07.541 --> 01:01:10.600
you're going to get offended by me calling someone a cunt or saying something's

1100
01:01:10.601 --> 01:01:14.290
a con in a,
in stand up comedy,
you're not,
you're the wrong show.

1101
01:01:14.650 --> 01:01:17.020
<v 1>When people go to live shows,
this is for people out there.</v>

1102
01:01:17.050 --> 01:01:20.860
I mean your fans already fucking know this,
but like you can't go to a show.

1103
01:01:21.010 --> 01:01:24.190
You get a friend and be a fucking effect.
It's like the stupidest fucking thing.

1104
01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:28.000
<v 3>Yeah,
it's there.
You're there to have,
just try to go along.
Just if you,</v>

1105
01:01:28.001 --> 01:01:31.330
if you're seeing good comedy,
just go along.
Just have a good fucking time.

1106
01:01:31.331 --> 01:01:33.850
You don't have to agree with everything the person saying,
just have fun,

1107
01:01:34.030 --> 01:01:36.640
just have fun and relax and if you don't like it,
leave.
Don't let us leave.

1108
01:01:37.030 --> 01:01:37.830
Don't be a cunt.

1109
01:01:37.830 --> 01:01:38.251
<v 1>Dude.
I,</v>

1110
01:01:38.251 --> 01:01:41.340
this is a corrillion a quick story that just happened to me that you'll fucking

1111
01:01:41.341 --> 01:01:45.600
love.
I do this.
Talk about toys for tots,
benefit at the fucking Improv.

1112
01:01:46.050 --> 01:01:50.430
I'm already hammered.
So I show up the club and I show up late,
so I walk in,

1113
01:01:50.431 --> 01:01:51.660
it's packed,
you know what I mean?

1114
01:01:52.110 --> 01:01:56.100
And I showed up late and I fucking go and I go on stage and I have a joke in my

1115
01:01:56.101 --> 01:01:58.140
act about old people and I'm like,
you know,

1116
01:01:58.141 --> 01:02:01.350
it's stuck to be like 95 years old because you can fucking die every time you go

1117
01:02:01.351 --> 01:02:02.100
to bed.

1118
01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:05.490
So it's like hard to plan your next day because it's like you can't really make

1119
01:02:05.491 --> 01:02:08.340
plans all the time because if like your grandson,
like let's go to the zoo,

1120
01:02:08.341 --> 01:02:12.330
it's like,
okay,
I'll leave it,
go to the zoo with you or I'll be fucking dead.

1121
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:13.860
So like hopefully I'll go to the zoo,

1122
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:16.830
but either you'll come over and I'll be a dead body and people will scream and

1123
01:02:16.831 --> 01:02:20.370
cry.
We awful.
You know what I mean?
So I do all bet and I'm like,

1124
01:02:20.371 --> 01:02:21.360
my sets going really good.

1125
01:02:21.361 --> 01:02:24.780
And I do that joke and the fucking crowd just goes like dead silent.

1126
01:02:25.380 --> 01:02:27.150
And I'm like,
what the fuck?
And I'm like,
yeah,

1127
01:02:27.151 --> 01:02:30.720
you can fucking die for fucking 95 I just do this whole bet.
And I'm like,
yeah.

1128
01:02:30.721 --> 01:02:33.780
And the crowd's getting more and more uncomfortable and Ip people like groaning

1129
01:02:33.781 --> 01:02:35.190
and I'm like,
what the fuck's?

1130
01:02:35.191 --> 01:02:39.000
The joke always works and I get off stage and I was like really uncomfortable

1131
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:42.300
and it turned out it was a 95 year old woman's birthday party,

1132
01:02:42.301 --> 01:02:46.560
a friend of Bud Friedman's.
They went on stage at the beginning of the show,

1133
01:02:46.561 --> 01:02:51.290
which I didn't see and made a huge announcement saying happy birthday to her.

1134
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:56.610
The whole crowd just thought I was like some psycho asshole.
I was just like,

1135
01:02:56.611 --> 01:03:01.611
you can die any fucking day if you're 95 when you go to bed.

1136
01:03:01.831 --> 01:03:03.170
Like it was so uncommon.

1137
01:03:03.171 --> 01:03:06.980
Love how you're saying that with your fist up to your face.
The microphone.
Yeah,

1138
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:10.170
that is the offensive microphone fits.
If you're saying something really crazy,

1139
01:03:10.320 --> 01:03:14.970
listen,
you whore,
you will have your fist in a certain position.

1140
01:03:14.971 --> 01:03:18.660
Tilting the gun sight.
Exactly.
It's gangster dude.
Bud came over to me.
He's like,

1141
01:03:18.670 --> 01:03:21.000
my God.
I don't know if you knew this,
but it was

1142
01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.090
so and so's 95th birthday in case you're wondering whether that joke didn't
work.

1143
01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:31.370
Oh,
I felt so bad.
I go,
she bombed out and he goes,
no,
she couldn't.
You

1144
01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:34.330
<v 0>hear anything she can't hear.
So I was like,
oh,</v>

1145
01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:37.380
thank God everybody else's bombed out.
The crown was just,

1146
01:03:37.381 --> 01:03:41.070
I was so uncomfortable and I fell off of it cause I'm not insensitive like that.

1147
01:03:41.071 --> 01:03:43.230
I would of course not.
That's terrible.
I've done,

1148
01:03:43.410 --> 01:03:45.900
there's a joke that I do and every time I get to it,

1149
01:03:45.901 --> 01:03:50.280
like I see like I'm always like about the sad and I'll see a fat girl in the

1150
01:03:50.281 --> 01:03:53.430
audience and then I won't pull the trigger.
I stopped saying,
I like,

1151
01:03:53.431 --> 01:03:55.380
I don't want to be mean.
I used to have this joke about chicks,

1152
01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:56.360
like people would see like a,

1153
01:03:56.361 --> 01:03:59.720
a really overweight chick and a little slutty outfit and let girls were always

1154
01:03:59.721 --> 01:04:02.220
hitting.
It's like,
what the fuck is she thinking?
And I would go,

1155
01:04:02.221 --> 01:04:05.190
I'll tell you exactly what she's thinking.
It might not be the best ride,

1156
01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:10.260
but there's no line
that would be right about to do that.

1157
01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.220
But all the time,

1158
01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:16.000
look in the audience to see a poor fat girl who's having a good time isn't it?

1159
01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:19.710
But she's got her fingers folded up and they're chubby lap and she's laughing

1160
01:04:19.711 --> 01:04:21.870
her ass off and I don't want to crush her emotion.

1161
01:04:21.871 --> 01:04:25.860
So I just dance over the bed for one person,
I'll just say,
sorry,
that's good.

1162
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:27.150
But every now and then man,

1163
01:04:27.151 --> 01:04:29.700
there'll be a joke and I'll say it and then I'll turn and like,

1164
01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:34.080
oh here's an example of my joke
now I feel bad again.

1165
01:04:34.081 --> 01:04:37.470
I saw that recently added Jim Jeffrey show and I just,
I was just like,

1166
01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:39.840
I was sitting on the side of the stage,

1167
01:04:39.841 --> 01:04:42.120
just staring right in front of me was a fat chick.

1168
01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:43.830
You just see you're just staring the whole bit.

1169
01:04:43.831 --> 01:04:46.380
And then like just like sitting there like looking down on the ground or

1170
01:04:46.381 --> 01:04:47.214
handling like

1171
01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:52.700
almost in tears to really obese people are so sensitive because there's,

1172
01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:56.070
this is so many people fucking staring at him all the time.

1173
01:04:56.070 --> 01:04:59.550
They look like freaks.
That's gotta be,
it's so painful.

1174
01:04:59.551 --> 01:05:02.430
And then when someone's shitting on fat people and everyone around you is

1175
01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:06.660
laughing and there you are and feel bad.
Go home and eat.
But yeah,

1176
01:05:06.661 --> 01:05:10.830
probably right.
I don't,
I don't do my joke with old people anymore.

1177
01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:12.750
If I ever see an old couple in the crowd,

1178
01:05:13.140 --> 01:05:15.450
they look like 70s or 80s I won't even do it.

1179
01:05:15.451 --> 01:05:18.170
Just cause I fucking feel it's a terrible feeling man.

1180
01:05:18.730 --> 01:05:21.430
My parents are in their sixties they don't like talking about death.

1181
01:05:21.431 --> 01:05:24.400
They don't even like the mentioned fucking parents in his sixties yeah.

1182
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:26.530
Holy Shit.
Your pants and younger.
Yeah.

1183
01:05:26.531 --> 01:05:30.520
Well my mom was really young when she had me and my stepfather was younger than

1184
01:05:30.521 --> 01:05:32.110
my mom.
My mom was like,

1185
01:05:32.260 --> 01:05:37.260
I think she was like close to 30 when she met my stepfather and he was 24 or

1186
01:05:38.730 --> 01:05:40.740
something like that.
So yeah.

1187
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:43.450
So they're very young and they don't like talking about that

1188
01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.200
90 year old people.
They don't want to hear none of that shit.

1189
01:05:47.201 --> 01:05:50.050
They want to hear dead people jokes.
They did not want to shore.
Let me see.

1190
01:05:50.051 --> 01:05:53.380
Shorts to always get mad at me at the comedy store cause I would do that joke

1191
01:05:53.381 --> 01:05:54.760
about j Howard Marshall.

1192
01:05:54.910 --> 01:05:57.580
J Howard Marshall is the old man that married Anna Nicole Smith.

1193
01:05:57.581 --> 01:05:59.350
That billionaire though.
Yeah,
I know what it was.

1194
01:05:59.351 --> 01:06:03.220
Do this choke hold him just doing all sorts of nasty shit to her before he dies.

1195
01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:07.360
I don't even remember how Joe,
I don't even remember how the goes,

1196
01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:09.700
but I do remember that I would get off stage and mid to go.

1197
01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:16.030
Y'All doing y'all?
I'd be like Mitzi.

1198
01:06:16.031 --> 01:06:19.300
It's funny.
I think that took meanwhile was my closer.
Okay.

1199
01:06:19.301 --> 01:06:23.350
It was a washer and it was a crusher of a bit that I could even follow.

1200
01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:26.930
I couldn't follow it.
I have to close on that bit.
She was like,
I know.

1201
01:06:26.931 --> 01:06:29.020
Like it stomped on his nap.

1202
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:33.050
<v 1>Stop.
Do Your fucking huge closer.
That's a great,
well,</v>

1203
01:06:33.051 --> 01:06:34.970
you know it was about old people and cheese,

1204
01:06:35.030 --> 01:06:37.590
<v 0>you know,
just can't know all long in those years.
But it's like,</v>

1205
01:06:37.591 --> 01:06:38.340
it's not uncomfortable

1206
01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:39.420
<v 1>for Ernie to talk about old people.
Like,</v>

1207
01:06:39.421 --> 01:06:41.610
some people get mad at me when I do that and I'm like,

1208
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:45.340
I'm going to fucking get old.
Hopefully.
I mean,
I might not,
I'll probably forget.

1209
01:06:45.380 --> 01:06:48.450
Right.
But when you go,
I can't avoid it,
you know what I mean?

1210
01:06:48.451 --> 01:06:52.360
So it's like essentially I'm talking about myself because we're all gonna get,

1211
01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:53.370
we all get old.

1212
01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:58.200
It's not like I took some fucking potion and now I'm a cocky lived forever guy

1213
01:06:58.680 --> 01:07:02.070
who's like,
ah,
yeah,
that is a trick.
Like different,
it's like,

1214
01:07:02.071 --> 01:07:06.160
why can't you make fun of that?
Because it really is a valid subject.
I stand up,

1215
01:07:06.600 --> 01:07:08.910
stand up as genius.
He used to do like that.

1216
01:07:09.370 --> 01:07:10.740
He would go after old people and he like,

1217
01:07:10.741 --> 01:07:13.770
he would do jokes about like fucking succulent,
you know,

1218
01:07:13.771 --> 01:07:16.620
getting a blow job and the Collagen and comfortable it'd be all people in the

1219
01:07:16.621 --> 01:07:21.570
crowd.
And I don't remember Doug.
It'd be like,
you fucking asshole fucking crowd.

1220
01:07:21.810 --> 01:07:24.690
You guys are thick.
You're so fucking better.
This guy's fucking knew.

1221
01:07:24.691 --> 01:07:25.071
How old are you?

1222
01:07:25.071 --> 01:07:29.280
So it'd be like 81 this guy was fucking getting his dick sucked before you guys

1223
01:07:29.281 --> 01:07:32.340
were fucking born.
He's like,
you think you guys invented the blow job?
He goes,

1224
01:07:32.550 --> 01:07:34.770
fuck you.
Fuck this crowd.

1225
01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.490
This guy's a fighter who just go off to the crowd just like,
oh my God.

1226
01:07:38.491 --> 01:07:39.510
It was like,
oh awesome.

1227
01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:42.150
<v 0>That's fine.
Yeah.</v>

1228
01:07:42.151 --> 01:07:45.900
It's a touchy subject for people that are getting old subjects real touchy man.

1229
01:07:46.170 --> 01:07:48.730
People don't want to,
you know,
well they forget it.

1230
01:07:49.020 --> 01:07:51.780
Old People like it just makes people uncomfortable,
you know,

1231
01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:55.860
start shitting on old people and they're like something you can even change.

1232
01:07:55.890 --> 01:07:59.550
At least you're fat.
You can lose weight if you're old,
you're fucked.
I stopped,

1233
01:07:59.580 --> 01:08:02.480
I stopped doing comedy for five years when the day Bob hope died.

1234
01:08:02.481 --> 01:08:06.420
I went onstage and did that Bob hope joke and it was like like a year or two

1235
01:08:06.421 --> 01:08:09.870
after nine 11 good one.
Our troops were like going,
you know,

1236
01:08:09.871 --> 01:08:13.410
being sent to Iraq and stuff and Bob hope died and I thought it was like an open

1237
01:08:13.411 --> 01:08:16.100
mic or,
and I'm like,
oh I'm going on.
I really,
you did this new Bob Hope

1238
01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:20.350
<v 2>joke and I'd come out on stage and it was just all old people cause at the funny</v>

1239
01:08:20.351 --> 01:08:21.111
bone in Columbus,
Ohio,

1240
01:08:21.111 --> 01:08:24.980
they gave tickets out to like senior citizens and stuff like that and so I went

1241
01:08:24.981 --> 01:08:27.590
out and like,
do I do this joke?
I'm like,
yeah,
I have to have,
you know.

1242
01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:31.280
And it was a,
hey,
did you guys hear Bob Hope died?
And they're were like,
oh.

1243
01:08:31.281 --> 01:08:35.130
And like everyone's just like Ah,
you know,
like sad and making sad noises.

1244
01:08:35.131 --> 01:08:35.791
And I'm like,
yeah,

1245
01:08:35.791 --> 01:08:40.791
I heard they flew out his body to entertain all the dead troops and they just

1246
01:08:41.091 --> 01:08:46.091
started hissing and booing and I didn't do comedy for five years.

1247
01:08:47.150 --> 01:08:52.100
Do Omari Good Joe,
I'm sorry.
That's a good joke though.
Insanity.

1248
01:08:52.490 --> 01:08:55.850
That was a good joke dude.
Did you open with it?
No,

1249
01:08:56.050 --> 01:08:58.260
it was like my third joke in or fourth joke,
someone,

1250
01:08:58.370 --> 01:08:59.900
Jesus and then I just stopped.

1251
01:09:00.910 --> 01:09:04.310
I just stopped even to watch Bob Hope.
Do standup comedy.

1252
01:09:05.090 --> 01:09:09.550
I don't think I have actually I was the on premium blend.
No,

1253
01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:12.470
he was on half hour comedy hour.
I thought it was golf Cabana.

1254
01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:14.850
What's the volume for the clover?
That old,

1255
01:09:14.860 --> 01:09:17.990
I'm kind of comedy that old like Bob Hope style comedy.

1256
01:09:17.991 --> 01:09:19.640
That's a fascinating thing to watch.

1257
01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.340
That's like if you ever wanted to see like evolution,
you want to see,

1258
01:09:22.341 --> 01:09:24.530
you want to see fish that eventually walk on land.

1259
01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:29.450
Watch some Bob hope comedy from like 1950.
I met him when I was eight years old.

1260
01:09:29.451 --> 01:09:29.990
He,
uh,

1261
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:34.790
came up to me and signed autograph for me at a field and then he wrote that
joke.

1262
01:09:35.710 --> 01:09:36.111
He's like,

1263
01:09:36.111 --> 01:09:40.430
tell him it was crazy booed off stage about me and 20 years from now it was

1264
01:09:40.431 --> 01:09:41.780
awesome.
And it's this big crowd of people.

1265
01:09:41.781 --> 01:09:45.190
And I was just a little kid and then he just walked by and looked at me and he's

1266
01:09:45.200 --> 01:09:46.220
like,
went right to me.

1267
01:09:46.250 --> 01:09:51.250
Signed it and he said something to me and then walked off until you do you uh,

1268
01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:54.230
what the fuck was I going to say?

1269
01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:02.420
Nick Swardson only person here not hi.
By the way,
hangovers worse than high.

1270
01:10:02.600 --> 01:10:05.270
No all.
Do you know who he was or no?
Yeah.

1271
01:10:05.271 --> 01:10:09.290
Cause I think we need grew up with like four channels on the TV.

1272
01:10:09.291 --> 01:10:11.810
He always had those marathons or something like that.

1273
01:10:11.840 --> 01:10:16.120
Well always did the USO thing,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.

1274
01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:18.530
I used to actually like him.
I remember liking him,

1275
01:10:18.531 --> 01:10:21.380
like remembering him from TV and let's,
okay,
cause I don't remember any,

1276
01:10:21.381 --> 01:10:23.390
it was comedy.
This is why I'm saying this.
I'm saying,

1277
01:10:23.391 --> 01:10:26.150
you know what I do remember is I remember watching a long time ago and going,

1278
01:10:26.151 --> 01:10:28.550
wow,
this is like a window into a different era.

1279
01:10:28.730 --> 01:10:30.830
Like the way people clapped was different,

1280
01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.130
or the studio audience looked different.
That comedy was different.

1281
01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:37.220
The way the announcer would introduce him was different.
Pull up some,

1282
01:10:37.221 --> 01:10:40.790
some of his shit.
Pull up some Bob Hope.
Stand up.
You know,
it's crazy.

1283
01:10:40.791 --> 01:10:45.410
Every time I drive home from here,
I exit off of Bob Hope Drive.
Oh Shit.

1284
01:10:45.970 --> 01:10:48.980
No stalkers are going to know where you live.
How about that?
That's an area.

1285
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:53.060
Burbank,
they're going to know girls.
You're gonna get some girls stalkers.

1286
01:10:53.230 --> 01:10:57.530
Let me fuck.
What time is it?
Football game,
dude.
Um,
shit balls.
Your mother's coat.

1287
01:10:57.950 --> 01:11:00.870
But correct.
What time was the football game?
I don't like,

1288
01:11:00.880 --> 01:11:04.760
I don't follow football.
Football is boring.
My team placed,

1289
01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:09.510
you know they're going to institute sensors in,
in helmets.
You hear that?
Oh,

1290
01:11:09.511 --> 01:11:11.780
I can sell all this shit that's leaking.
Yeah.
No,

1291
01:11:11.781 --> 01:11:14.010
they're going to find out like what the fuck's going to happen when

1292
01:11:14.010 --> 01:11:17.780
<v 0>they blast each other in the head.
Oh No.
Sensors.
How much censor their helmets?</v>

1293
01:11:17.810 --> 01:11:20.100
No,
no,
no.
Why?
What are they saying?
Oh Dude,

1294
01:11:20.101 --> 01:11:23.060
you can cut some fucking hilarious shits.
I'm really sort through.
Yeah,

1295
01:11:23.061 --> 01:11:27.240
it's awesome.
Like what?
They swear.
Oh yeah,
dude.

1296
01:11:27.330 --> 01:11:30.510
So you watch them once in a while you could catch like a fan will pick up some

1297
01:11:30.511 --> 01:11:35.400
shit.
Um,
some receiver job,
like an n bomb the other day.
Really?
Yeah.

1298
01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.560
Black Guy or white guy?
No,
the black dude.

1299
01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:43.170
You'll see that there was Michael Richards just got drafted by the bangles.

1300
01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:46.180
The coach from the 49,
or is that that last game?
Uh,
you know,
he,

1301
01:11:46.181 --> 01:11:48.810
I think he just got fired or something.
It's got fired and he was,

1302
01:11:48.811 --> 01:11:51.330
he was yelling at one of the players at the quarterback was like,

1303
01:11:51.331 --> 01:11:54.810
I'm sorry I can't do any better or something.
Whoa,
I'm just human.

1304
01:11:54.810 --> 01:11:56.190
Or something like that.
I was fucked up.

1305
01:11:56.220 --> 01:11:59.230
Player was signal to who's yelling at the player?
Yeah.
Was like,
she,

1306
01:11:59.231 --> 01:12:03.120
they got in a huge fight.
Mike Singletary did,
he used to play for the bears.

1307
01:12:03.160 --> 01:12:04.550
Here's the defensive player for the bears out.

1308
01:12:04.551 --> 01:12:08.490
He was sick and he was the one that was in a like the Superbowl shovel sick,

1309
01:12:08.670 --> 01:12:10.960
sick,
good or sick aids.
He was sick.
Good.

1310
01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:15.410
You can't burp aids and then leave me in the dark luck.
Sorry about that.
Um,
no,

1311
01:12:15.450 --> 01:12:18.090
he was,
he was awesome.
Was he at the Superbowl shuffle team?

1312
01:12:18.150 --> 01:12:20.370
Wasn't even one of those guys you might've been,
yeah,

1313
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:23.970
that's what came into prominence anymore after I think more after that.

1314
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:26.940
And so just a crazy coach and just yells and screams and coach the coached 40

1315
01:12:26.941 --> 01:12:30.970
niners and they were just start fucking before names are a mess.
There's fucking,

1316
01:12:30.990 --> 01:12:34.950
and he had a press conference and literally he wears a huge wooden cross around

1317
01:12:34.951 --> 01:12:39.660
his neck every game.
Huge.
It looks like how big.
It's like,
hey bro.

1318
01:12:39.720 --> 01:12:43.920
No,
it's like fucking,
oh my God.
Like that.
Plenty.
It looks you really?
Yeah.

1319
01:12:43.921 --> 01:12:47.010
I mean it could be like a crucifix for like a fucking cat or something.

1320
01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:48.540
You could fuck.
You know what I mean?

1321
01:12:48.541 --> 01:12:53.541
It's big dam and so he got fired and then he said him and his wife are going to

1322
01:12:53.851 --> 01:12:57.440
take a step back and pray about it and see what they're going to do next.
Nice.

1323
01:12:57.570 --> 01:13:00.660
It's like what?
It's always a good move.
Here's some Bob Hope.

1324
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.900
Give me some Bob Hope.

1325
01:13:01.900 --> 01:13:06.900
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

1326
01:13:10.060 --> 01:13:14.860
<v 8>thank you very much.
Uh,
uh,
I wish she'd get steady work.</v>

1327
01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.470
<v 4>Okay.
That's my joke.</v>

1328
01:13:17.810 --> 01:13:19.420
<v 8>So it's nice to see her.</v>

1329
01:13:20.300 --> 01:13:21.133
<v 4>I haven't,</v>

1330
01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:26.850
<v 8>I haven't been traveling too much lately and I've gotten to know some of the</v>

1331
01:13:26.851 --> 01:13:27.700
family personally.

1332
01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:30.510
<v 4>That's nice to be here</v>

1333
01:13:30.510 --> 01:13:34.580
<v 8>Dane.
And I wanted to tell you that I'm happy that NBC is the Bob Hope Rose for</v>

1334
01:13:34.581 --> 01:13:35.414
another year.

1335
01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:39.970
<v 4>[inaudible] I you love the way</v>

1336
01:13:40.040 --> 01:13:43.780
<v 8>Dan reads cue cards.
If he doesn't like the joke,
he breezed on it and the racism,</v>

1337
01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:48.040
<v 4>it was nice to flip</v>

1338
01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:50.380
<v 8>is that all of them</v>

1339
01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.380
<v 4>want to see him before without high heels.
Is that in?</v>

1340
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:58.150
Thank you for that.

1341
01:13:58.150 --> 01:14:02.580
<v 8>Um,
no,
I really miss flip series,
but he has to face the facts.
He's good.</v>

1342
01:14:02.581 --> 01:14:03.720
But he's no Sonny Bono.

1343
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:10.870
<v 4>I guess that was a dishonest Sonny</v>

1344
01:14:12.290 --> 01:14:15.900
<v 8>and I do want to thank governor Reagan for his kind words.
Incidentally,</v>

1345
01:14:15.901 --> 01:14:19.050
the governor had presidential aspirations.
In fact,

1346
01:14:19.051 --> 01:14:22.820
you just made a tour of 43 states just to tell him he's not running for any

1347
01:14:23.060 --> 01:14:25.330
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

1348
01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.230
<v 8>girls here.
Milton was the first comic.
Do ever be impeached</v>

1349
01:14:32.920 --> 01:14:33.753
<v 4>Johnny</v>

1350
01:14:34.430 --> 01:14:37.650
<v 8>greatest catcher of all time.
Do you ever see him behind the plate?</v>

1351
01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:39.840

you can measure a man by the caliber of his enemies and I flat on my shelf to

You know,</v>

1451
01:21:05.741 --> 01:21:07.750
one of the coolest things about this business,
about,

1452
01:21:08.710 --> 01:21:11.130
about being in the a standup comedy businesses,

1453
01:21:11.140 --> 01:21:15.850
all the fun fucking people you meet,
you know?

Nick,
me and one of them.
Yeah.

1454
01:21:16.290 --> 01:21:19.330
Such a fucking good dude.
When we think about just this podcast,

1455
01:21:19.331 --> 01:21:22.780
all the cool people that we've hung out with on this podcast,
you know,

1456
01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:25.810
half fron and you know,
Johnny Pemberton,

1457
01:21:25.811 --> 01:21:28.660
I would've never known about him if it wasn't for the podcast.
Right?
Yup.

1458
01:21:29.020 --> 01:21:32.080
You know,
Freddie La card and you know,

1459
01:21:32.110 --> 01:21:36.040
t been so many fucking cool people were so fortunate,
man.
Totally.

1460
01:21:36.340 --> 01:21:39.130
That's one of the big problems that a lot of people face in their life is that

1461
01:21:39.131 --> 01:21:41.710
there,
there's not enough cool people to hang out with.

1462
01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:42.790
They're just always around.

1463
01:21:42.791 --> 01:21:45.940
Douche bags are always around negative energy and it's so hard to have a good

1464
01:21:45.941 --> 01:21:48.340
time.
We're so fucking lucky,
man.

1465
01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:51.350
<v 6>Yeah.
It's usually like if you,
I mean back in Ohio and stuff,</v>

1466
01:21:51.351 --> 01:21:54.990
I've got most of your friends came from where you worked and so like you were

1467
01:21:55.050 --> 01:21:56.460
like,
I would work a lot at restaurants.

1468
01:21:56.461 --> 01:22:00.090
All my friends were like other waiters and just people that needed a job and

1469
01:22:00.330 --> 01:22:04.920
you'd go through so many friends so fast.
It was more like you're dating friends,

1470
01:22:04.921 --> 01:22:05.731
you know?
You know,

1471
01:22:05.731 --> 01:22:09.150
and you would like hang out with them and shit and go out with them after work.

1472
01:22:09.151 --> 01:22:12.210
And then some weird shit would go down where you realize one guy couldn't drink

1473
01:22:12.230 --> 01:22:16.270
right.
Fucking crazy or something bad happens that they steal a VCR from you.

1474
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:18.720
[inaudible] why did you see my VCR?
Yeah.

1475
01:22:18.721 --> 01:22:21.900
You see people who are banging each other.
It's always people working together.

1476
01:22:21.901 --> 01:22:25.440
Waitresses and waiters are,
he's trying to see who's going to hook up and yeah,

1477
01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:28.500
that's hilarious.
You know so many people,
man,
they're,

1478
01:22:28.501 --> 01:22:31.830
they're in unfortunate situations where they can't find enough cool people.

1479
01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:36.260
That's tricky.
Absolutely.
We've got to start a cult,

We're going to fix this world.

Yes,

You get pulled over.</v>

1486
01:22:57.721 --> 01:23:00.570
Don't use sanitizer over your hands and your face.
Don't smoke weed in your car.

1487
01:23:00.571 --> 01:23:03.780
Stupid.

<v 3>Yeah,
cause Joey Dee has always wanting smoke weed in the car and we're like,</v>

we're going to get pulled over.
We're in

1490
01:23:08.390 --> 01:23:10.070
<v 6>Texas in the car,</v>

1491
01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:14.570
thinks like we and it's California weed and they can smell the difference.

1492
01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:17.750
It's crazy how you forget that.
Like in Ohio,
that was a scary thing.

1493
01:23:17.751 --> 01:23:21.960
Driving with weed or buying food and stuff.
I remember always being a paranoid,

1494
01:23:21.961 --> 01:23:25.490
don't do it.
You can go to jail.
Now I go to back home to Ohio and I'm just like,

1495
01:23:25.491 --> 01:23:28.520
hey,
here's some weeds.
There's a joint is don't do that.
Then they'll lock you up.

1496
01:23:28.830 --> 01:23:31.820
They locked up.
Willie Nelson,
Bro.
Yeah.
Stop and think about that.

1497
01:23:31.850 --> 01:23:34.520
That's ridiculous.
Yeah,
it's weird when you like watch cops too.

1498
01:23:34.521 --> 01:23:38.680
Like I was watching cops either day in this,
it was police cops have at uh,

1499
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:43.790
Texas or whatever that shows called like female t Dallas Female Cox,
the show.

1500
01:23:43.791 --> 01:23:46.070
It's like cops.
But with these Dallas female girls,

1501
01:23:46.071 --> 01:23:50.090
it's like real housewives of Atlanta and mixed with cops.
But anyways,

1502
01:23:50.091 --> 01:23:52.360
it's real though supposedly.
And uh,

1503
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:56.890
they were shaking down somebody like for having like a little bit of weed.

1504
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:59.990
They're like,
you understand you are driving with marijuana,
sir.

1505
01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:04.550
Do you have like making it seem like it was just insane drug,
you know?

1506
01:24:04.551 --> 01:24:07.820
And it was just,
wait a second,
this is just weed.
He had a little bit of a week,

1507
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:10.850
you know,
that's weird to me that that's that,
you know,

1508
01:24:10.851 --> 01:24:14.900
most states that's how they treat wheat and that's how you're yelled at upon

1509
01:24:14.901 --> 01:24:17.390
from the police officers and stuff.
And now here,

1510
01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:21.030
<v 3>not always out here,
man.
There's some dopey cops out here too.
I mean,</v>

1511
01:24:21.031 --> 01:24:24.900
most cops are really cool,
but there's,
there's a few,
it's like everybody else,

1512
01:24:24.901 --> 01:24:26.060
you know.
One douchebag.

1513
01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:29.220
Cop makes everybody think cops are douchebags cops aren't all douchebags.

1514
01:24:29.370 --> 01:24:31.050
Most cops that I know from,

1515
01:24:31.051 --> 01:24:34.500
I know him from Jujitsu and I know him from martial arts.
So fucking Nice guys,

1516
01:24:34.501 --> 01:24:37.230
man.
The most that I know,
it's just a job man.

1517
01:24:37.231 --> 01:24:39.450
They're trying to do the best they can at this fucking crazy job.

1518
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:44.700
But every now and one,
and then you run into a Twat and uh,
my friend got,

1519
01:24:44.910 --> 01:24:46.170
he got pulled over.

1520
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:50.210
What happened was he was in his car and um,

1521
01:24:50.490 --> 01:24:55.320
somehow or another someone saw like,
like,
uh,
he,
like he had a,

1522
01:24:55.321 --> 01:24:58.050
a joint in his hand or something and the cop,

1523
01:24:58.170 --> 01:25:01.230
like he didn't realize there was cops there and the cop flashed him and he was

1524
01:25:01.231 --> 01:25:03.990
just putting it back and it was car.
And the cop said,
you know,
you're not,

1525
01:25:04.530 --> 01:25:06.900
why do you have marijuana when you're operating a car?
And he's like,

1526
01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:10.110
I'm not even smoking it before I get in the car.
And they handcuffed him.

1527
01:25:10.740 --> 01:25:13.740
Chicken was yelling at him.
Well,
he turns out he was a medical marijuana patient,

1528
01:25:13.950 --> 01:25:15.570
so it was really like his little medicine.

1529
01:25:15.600 --> 01:25:17.340
I mean if you want to pay attention to state laws,

1530
01:25:17.341 --> 01:25:18.820
which is the cops are supposed to do,
right.

1531
01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:21.900
But this chick was beat rating him and yelling at him and I'm like,

1532
01:25:21.901 --> 01:25:22.800
this is so gross.

1533
01:25:22.801 --> 01:25:26.070
Because I was watching it because it was right outside of Jujitsu class was when

1534
01:25:26.071 --> 01:25:27.780
we were at the old legends and we would leave.

1535
01:25:27.781 --> 01:25:29.970
There was like this alleyway and you would go down the alleyway,

1536
01:25:29.971 --> 01:25:31.920
everybody would walk towards where the cars are parked.

1537
01:25:32.160 --> 01:25:34.920
And there was a cop car there and I guess this kid didn't see the cop car,

1538
01:25:35.220 --> 01:25:38.520
but it was like listening to the way this woman was talking to him as if he had

1539
01:25:38.521 --> 01:25:41.430
done something to her.
You know,
you know,

1540
01:25:41.431 --> 01:25:44.280
you don't know what the law is apparently you don't know what the law is,

1541
01:25:44.430 --> 01:25:44.671
you know?

1542
01:25:44.671 --> 01:25:48.030
Do you read what it says on this piece of paper says do not operate heavy

1543
01:25:48.031 --> 01:25:48.960
machinery.

1544
01:25:49.170 --> 01:25:54.000
And she's like in his face and shit and he's handcuffed and it was so gross.

1545
01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:57.750
And I was like,
what are you talking about?
First of all,
the guys not high,

1546
01:25:57.751 --> 01:26:00.750
he just told you he's getting,
he just got out of the gym.
Okay.

1547
01:26:00.751 --> 01:26:04.190
So he's got a joint in his hand.
Like what are you doing?
Like what exactly.

1548
01:26:04.190 --> 01:26:08.210
<v 2>And by the way you can drive high.
There's been a lot of studies on it.</v>

1549
01:26:08.211 --> 01:26:09.350
I don't recommend it.

1550
01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:12.290
I don't think it's for everybody because a lot of people get fucking paranoid as

1551
01:26:12.291 --> 01:26:15.020
shit when they're driving or when they're stoned rather and they can't

1552
01:26:15.021 --> 01:26:17.210
concentrate on anything and they see in tunnel vision and they'll miss

1553
01:26:17.211 --> 01:26:20.030
peripheral shit.
Right.
I mean maybe not the best thing for everybody,

1554
01:26:20.031 --> 01:26:24.470
but it's not like driving drunk,
you know,
drunk is completely awful.

1555
01:26:24.471 --> 01:26:28.280
I mean sometimes when you think about how horrible,
like I'm the worst.

1556
01:26:28.670 --> 01:26:31.550
Once in awhile I'll let myself slip where it gets to a point where I,

1557
01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:35.540
I do a shot I shouldn't have done or I had an extra drink that I shouldn't have

1558
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:40.670
and I'll catch myself going,
man,
why?
Why am I,
you know,
have to drive now.

1559
01:26:40.671 --> 01:26:41.770
What the fuck not to do it.

1560
01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:45.140
Usually I try to find food like on the way like you know,
stop somewhere to eat.

1561
01:26:45.260 --> 01:26:47.480
But there's been those times,
you know where you're just like,
man,

1562
01:26:47.481 --> 01:26:49.880
I'm just going to drive home.
I try this.
And then the next day you're like,

1563
01:26:49.881 --> 01:26:52.550
why the fuck did I do drive yourself to a diner or don't?

1564
01:26:52.670 --> 01:26:55.970
That's what I usually take a cab to a diner,
go fuel up on that thing is often,

1565
01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.150
I'm saying it's very,
very rare but scary shit man.

1566
01:26:59.151 --> 01:27:02.690
Cause people who kill people in drunk driving accidents and people who get away

1567
01:27:02.691 --> 01:27:06.830
with it are really doing the same thing.
Just one person fucks up and you know,

1568
01:27:06.831 --> 01:27:07.910
happens to be in the wrong place,

1569
01:27:07.911 --> 01:27:10.850
the wrong time and the other person just gets lucky and doesn't hit anything on

1570
01:27:10.851 --> 01:27:14.560
the way home.
But a lot of that is just just dumb luck man.
Yeah.

1571
01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:17.780
Scary shit man.
The idea that you can get that anywhere.

1572
01:27:17.820 --> 01:27:21.740
I mean you can go to cvs and drink enough alcohol to die.
That's crazy.

1573
01:27:21.741 --> 01:27:22.810
That's so crazy.

1574
01:27:22.811 --> 01:27:26.570
Man at cvs even sells beer in it's like has the best deals on beer,

1575
01:27:26.950 --> 01:27:29.090
whiskey or liquor and beer at cvs.

1576
01:27:29.091 --> 01:27:33.650
It seems like cvs is supposed to help you and it makes no sense that I never

1577
01:27:33.651 --> 01:27:36.050
would've thought that that's crazy that they to see.
Yeah,

1578
01:27:36.110 --> 01:27:40.250
that's supposed to be like a hospital almost,
you know with gum,
right?

1579
01:27:40.251 --> 01:27:43.550
If you want anything that's gonna make you feel better.
If you're sick,
dude,

1580
01:27:43.551 --> 01:27:48.000
I got some therapy theraflu when I went to Montreal,
I got,
I got the flu.

1581
01:27:48.020 --> 01:27:52.400
When I came back I was,
I was fucking wrecked for like a full two days.

1582
01:27:52.401 --> 01:27:56.360
I was wrecked right where I was like cold sweats and shivers.

1583
01:27:56.570 --> 01:27:57.620
Like I was freezing.

1584
01:27:57.621 --> 01:28:01.640
I was sweating like my whole body was sweating and I was shaking and it was

1585
01:28:01.641 --> 01:28:03.650
freezing and I was wearing clothes to bed.

1586
01:28:03.651 --> 01:28:07.410
I was wearing like pants and jackets and hoods.
Terrible feeling,
right?

1587
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:11.870
Terrible fuel.
I drank some Theraflu,
boom,
knocked it out of the park.

1588
01:28:11.930 --> 01:28:16.580
I mean knocked it out of the park.
No chills,
slept like a baby.

1589
01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:20.450
I don't know how much of it is a theraflu and how much of it is my immune
system.

1590
01:28:20.451 --> 01:28:21.380
I eat really healthy.

1591
01:28:21.381 --> 01:28:25.310
My immune system bounces back pretty quick or I don't know if that's it,

1592
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:29.250
but I think it's the Theraflu.
I think the Theraflu just kind of masked the,
the,

1593
01:28:29.251 --> 01:28:32.000
the feeling and it's the same shit in there that you make meth out.

1594
01:28:32.870 --> 01:28:35.150
You can make meth at a theraflu dude.
No,

1595
01:28:35.180 --> 01:28:38.480
Mrs Rogan had a sign for it when she went and bought it for me.

1596
01:28:38.540 --> 01:28:42.980
You have to show your id to she Shabaka and finally three boxes at their flu.

1597
01:28:43.130 --> 01:28:47.690
You gotta show your ID and sign for that shit.
I didn't know that,
but it's dope.

1598
01:28:47.770 --> 01:28:50.600
Theraflu is the shit.
I like that shit.
I can't,
I don't even know what it is.

1599
01:28:50.601 --> 01:28:52.100
And there's no way I could even pronounce it,

1600
01:28:52.101 --> 01:28:55.220
but there it's from like Germany or something like that.

1601
01:28:55.221 --> 01:28:58.030
It's like a really long name.
Like Petco,
you know,

1602
01:28:58.050 --> 01:29:00.980
and you're talking about and it's like you take 10 of these oil,
Iran,

1603
01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:05.790
it's us silly sub bill seminomas.
Yeah,
it's like little,
you know,

1604
01:29:06.090 --> 01:29:09.720
like half sugar beads.
It feels like,
I think it might be bullshit.

1605
01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:12.660
I did it once and it worked.
It seemed like it worked.
But again,
but then again,

1606
01:29:12.661 --> 01:29:14.490
you don't know this isn't working or is it,

1607
01:29:14.820 --> 01:29:19.650
Ari sent me something the other day that said that some insane amount of people,

1608
01:29:19.670 --> 01:29:23.310
uh,
that they give,
um,
the,
um,
uh,

1609
01:29:23.311 --> 01:29:27.690
that they give placebos to the placebo effect works.
Even if,

1610
01:29:27.691 --> 01:29:30.230
you know it's a placebo apparently.
Really,

1611
01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.840
<v 3>I don't understand how that works,</v>

1612
01:29:32.140 --> 01:29:35.860
but what Ari said was that they told people that they were going to give them a

1613
01:29:35.861 --> 01:29:40.240
placebo and even just telling them that they were going to give them a placebo

1614
01:29:40.390 --> 01:29:43.060
made them heal up quicker than people that they didn't tell.

1615
01:29:43.140 --> 01:29:44.890
<v 2>Well,
it's probably because they didn't know what placebo means.</v>

1616
01:29:44.891 --> 01:29:48.930
That it sounds like something like skin cell mine that gave him some placebo.

1617
01:29:48.931 --> 01:29:52.800
Man,
that Shit's legit.
You know,
maybe they just didn't know what it was.

1618
01:29:52.860 --> 01:29:54.570
I don't know.
What they're saying

1619
01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:56.160
<v 3>is.
Um,</v>

1620
01:29:56.580 --> 01:29:59.670
well everyone was aware of the placebo effect in medicine where a person

1621
01:29:59.671 --> 01:30:00.750
believes in sugar pills.

1622
01:30:00.751 --> 01:30:03.510
He's taken as a real medicine and sees improvement in symptoms.

1623
01:30:04.770 --> 01:30:08.580
Is it possible to experience the placebo effect even if you know the medicine

1624
01:30:08.581 --> 01:30:13.440
isn't real according to one new study and Plos one,
I don't know what that means.

1625
01:30:13.800 --> 01:30:15.390
The answer is yes.
So it's interesting.

1626
01:30:15.391 --> 01:30:19.470
ADP 80 people that did it with and it showed more people got better with the

1627
01:30:19.471 --> 01:30:22.170
placebo.
The fuck knows.
It's a weird thing,
man,

1628
01:30:22.171 --> 01:30:23.820
that your brain's got this ability to heal itself,

1629
01:30:23.821 --> 01:30:25.420
that you can't really tap into that.

1630
01:30:25.470 --> 01:30:28.800
But if it thinks that you're getting some medicine,
then it just fixes it.
Right?

1631
01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:33.420
Who?
Hell,
what the fuck is that about?
It's like your belief is so fucking strong.

1632
01:30:33.450 --> 01:30:35.730
It's so important to believe in things,
man.

1633
01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:40.650
So important in a weird way that doesn't make any sense.
You know there's,

1634
01:30:40.651 --> 01:30:43.950
there's like a zone when you believe in things and you're,
you're,

1635
01:30:43.951 --> 01:30:48.060
you're really like,
you're,
you're,
you're confident and you're tuned into him.

1636
01:30:48.450 --> 01:30:51.570
There's a weird power to that.
And you know,
he experienced that man,

1637
01:30:51.740 --> 01:30:55.410
experienced that in video games and experiencing that when you're playing pool,

1638
01:30:55.920 --> 01:30:59.050
you experience,
there's a ban on experience side and pulled up.
But Jesus,

1639
01:30:59.070 --> 01:31:01.860
cause you don't get that good at it.
When you get really good at pool,

1640
01:31:02.010 --> 01:31:03.390
you experience the,
these,

1641
01:31:03.430 --> 01:31:07.560
these zones where you believe in yourself and the ball just you believe

1642
01:31:07.561 --> 01:31:10.890
everything,
everything goes well.
But if you,
if you have,
um,

1643
01:31:11.190 --> 01:31:12.510
a negative thought at all,

1644
01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:16.080
like you could be aiming at the ball the perfect way you could queue up.

1645
01:31:16.081 --> 01:31:17.720
You know,
you've got a good bridge,
you're,

1646
01:31:17.721 --> 01:31:20.850
you're relaxed and the way you're gripping it,
everything you strokes in line.

1647
01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:24.480
But if right before you shoot it,
you start thinking,
I hope I don't miss this.

1648
01:31:24.690 --> 01:31:26.580
You'll miss it like eight times out of 10.

1649
01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.100
And now sometimes it'll babile it's way in,

1650
01:31:29.130 --> 01:31:32.490
but you really were supposed to miss it.
You know,
it's,
it's a weird thing,
man.

1651
01:31:32.491 --> 01:31:36.250
It's like when you believe it goes in,
it's so strange.
You know,

1652
01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:39.210
it doesn't work if you don't know how to play.
But once you learn how to play,

1653
01:31:39.870 --> 01:31:42.540
it's like one of the most important things is that not have a negative thought

1654
01:31:42.541 --> 01:31:44.250
before you pull the trigger before you shoot.

1655
01:31:44.520 --> 01:31:46.470
They say that's the same thing with archery as well.

1656
01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:49.890
You know that you have to kind of like have this belief in what you're doing and

1657
01:31:49.891 --> 01:31:51.720
if you don't,
even if you're doing everything the right way,

1658
01:31:51.721 --> 01:31:53.250
if you don't believe it's going to hit it,
it won't hit.

1659
01:31:53.630 --> 01:31:55.970
<v 2>Did they still do archery and like elementary school?</v>

1660
01:31:56.150 --> 01:31:58.370
I don't think they trust kids with bows and arrows out where to go.

1661
01:31:58.371 --> 01:31:59.980
I was thinking that the other day I was like no.
I remember

1662
01:31:59.980 --> 01:32:04.630
<v 6>in elementary school like fifth grade having arrows and bows and we had like</v>

1663
01:32:04.660 --> 01:32:08.140
these like courses that you go through and try to kind of like,
you know,

1664
01:32:08.141 --> 01:32:10.740
a shooting range where you'd walk through and just do archery everywhere.

1665
01:32:10.940 --> 01:32:14.090
And I remember thinking like one time I already shot it straight up in the air

1666
01:32:14.091 --> 01:32:16.710
and I remember how dumb that was cause I didn't really think it out.

1667
01:32:16.970 --> 01:32:20.030
<v 3>Franciscans.
Yeah,
do that shit.
Super Dangerous.
Yeah.</v>

1668
01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:24.120
When I was 12 I was in the boy scouts and uh,
I went on a camp,

1669
01:32:24.240 --> 01:32:27.630
I went to like a camp for two weeks.
Then we were shooting guns,
man,

1670
01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:30.750
we're shooting guns and you'd hear ricochets like we were,

1671
01:32:30.751 --> 01:32:33.630
I was in the archery course and this is one of the reasons why I decided to just

1672
01:32:33.660 --> 01:32:35.910
quit everything and go fishing.
The whole time I was there,

1673
01:32:35.911 --> 01:32:38.850
all I did was go fishing everyday.
I quit everything.
I was like,

1674
01:32:38.851 --> 01:32:42.250
fuck you crazy assholes.
Because we were all shooting archery and I hurt.

1675
01:32:43.300 --> 01:32:46.620
I was like,
what the fuck is that?
And then someone,
one of the kids goes,

1676
01:32:46.621 --> 01:32:48.660
that's a ricochet.
What do you mean a ricochet?

1677
01:32:48.661 --> 01:32:50.550
Someone had shot and it probably hit a rock or something.

1678
01:32:50.820 --> 01:32:54.500
Get the fuck Outta here,
man.
We almost just got hit by a bullet.
Okay.

1679
01:32:54.510 --> 01:32:56.520
What is going on here?
And it was only at 22.

1680
01:32:56.521 --> 01:32:58.890
So if it did hit you in a ricocheted,
probably just could be,

1681
01:32:58.891 --> 01:33:02.100
he could hit your eye,
you know,
I mean you could get fucked up.
So I was like,

1682
01:33:02.101 --> 01:33:04.380
these crazy ass holes.
I'm just going to go fishing every day,

1683
01:33:04.381 --> 01:33:08.160
so I avoided all the activities.
I didn't go,
I didn't do anything.

1684
01:33:08.161 --> 01:33:11.130
I just went fishing.
We would all get in line like everybody get in line,

1685
01:33:11.131 --> 01:33:14.220
I just disappear into the woods.
Somebody could easily raped and killed me.
Man.

1686
01:33:14.430 --> 01:33:16.620
It's like no one was watching us for two weeks.

1687
01:33:16.621 --> 01:33:20.400
I was alone in the woods of New Hampshire.
No one was watching anybody.

1688
01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:23.330
These fucking counselors who knows what kind of creepy shit they were into.

1689
01:33:23.340 --> 01:33:23.770
Right?

1690
01:33:23.770 --> 01:33:26.490
They always had a few boys that they really liked the most and they hung out

1691
01:33:26.491 --> 01:33:29.310
with them and then everybody else would just kind of like free like a little

1692
01:33:29.311 --> 01:33:32.490
wild animals,
little 12 year olds with no cell phones.

1693
01:33:32.550 --> 01:33:34.320
There's not even a phone out there period.

1694
01:33:34.321 --> 01:33:39.000
My parents had no way to contact me and you're out there alone in the woods with

1695
01:33:39.001 --> 01:33:41.790
a bunch of fucking street kids.
They're all kids from Jamaica plain,

1696
01:33:41.791 --> 01:33:43.740
which is like this really shitty area of Boston.

1697
01:33:43.930 --> 01:33:47.400
And so they were all like fucking doing deviant shit in the middle of the night,

1698
01:33:47.401 --> 01:33:51.000
like taking kids out into the woods and tying them to their bed and leaving them

1699
01:33:51.001 --> 01:33:53.910
in the woods and covering them with toothpaste,
whether they're sleeping.

1700
01:33:53.911 --> 01:33:56.690
It was like,
it was fucking creepy.
It was like being in like,
like a,

1701
01:33:56.691 --> 01:33:58.950
a juvenile detention center in the woods.

1702
01:33:59.440 --> 01:34:03.850
<v 6>There was a weird Google that I did the other day that I always googling and see</v>

1703
01:34:03.851 --> 01:34:07.030
what time Kmart was open to.
And Somehow I ended up,
uh,

1704
01:34:07.031 --> 01:34:10.800
on this website about this a Kmart that's by my house that,
um,

1705
01:34:11.230 --> 01:34:16.150
I suspect tried to murder two police officers and shot two police officers at

1706
01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:20.740
Kmart in Burbank,
which is like,
Eh,
who,
who has,
you know,
violence there.
But,
uh,

1707
01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:23.670
so anyways,
what,
what's weird,
I started,
I was so stoned,
I decided just to,

1708
01:34:23.740 --> 01:34:26.290
cause that was back in July and they started to try to read up.

1709
01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:30.340
And if you go online and read about this,
uh,
uh,
just Google,
uh,

1710
01:34:30.370 --> 01:34:34.750
Kmart shooting murder or police officer or whatever,
uh,
it starts off,
you know,

1711
01:34:34.751 --> 01:34:37.830
saying how this guy was like shoplifting and then,
you know,

1712
01:34:37.840 --> 01:34:39.450
some security guards like,
uh,

1713
01:34:39.460 --> 01:34:43.390
were there trying to hold this guy down and then he like pulls out the offy,

1714
01:34:43.660 --> 01:34:47.050
grabs the officer's gun while being handcuffed or something like that.

1715
01:34:47.420 --> 01:34:47.891
But anyways,

1716
01:34:47.891 --> 01:34:52.030
what's weird about this is there's message boards where the wife of this guy is

1717
01:34:52.031 --> 01:34:55.990
saying,
you know,
this is all bullshit.
This is,
you know,
in my,
my husband's none,

1718
01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.190
you know,
none of this happened or something weird.

1719
01:34:58.191 --> 01:35:01.430
Like I can't remember what it was,
but I was really big.
But,
uh,

1720
01:35:01.431 --> 01:35:04.610
he has like two kids,
but if he noticed this story never,

1721
01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:06.410
like there's no news about it.

1722
01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:09.080
Like he was supposed to go to trial and stuff and now there's like,

1723
01:35:09.330 --> 01:35:14.190
this guy just got banished from like the news and from public records and stuff.

1724
01:35:14.191 --> 01:35:18.140
Like,
did you research it?
I researched it for about 10,
15 minutes on Google,

1725
01:35:18.141 --> 01:35:21.920
which,
which,
you know,
what does that mean?
You type in,
there's no story.

1726
01:35:21.921 --> 01:35:25.610
It doesn't mean the guy advantage because the system is bogged down with so many

1727
01:35:25.611 --> 01:35:27.050
other cases.
If you're that bored,

1728
01:35:27.051 --> 01:35:29.750
just started doing a little digging on this guy and started going to some of

1729
01:35:29.751 --> 01:35:32.660
these message boards that come up on Google and it's kind of weird cause like

1730
01:35:32.661 --> 01:35:37.190
the wife is involved with all these message boards and stuff.
It's kind of crazy.

1731
01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:39.870
<v 3>Yeah.
That is kind of crazy.
Here's another crazy thing.
Uh,</v>

1732
01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:43.830
did you hear about this guy who got busted for hacking into his wife's email?

1733
01:35:44.020 --> 01:35:48.210
[inaudible] apparently this dude is married to his chick and she's only 33 and

1734
01:35:48.211 --> 01:35:52.290
she's been married three times already.
So you know,
if there's,
pitch is crazy.

1735
01:35:52.291 --> 01:35:53.070
Right,
right.

1736
01:35:53.070 --> 01:35:58.070
And apparently she was taking their daughter over to her ex husband's house,

1737
01:35:58.800 --> 01:36:03.690
so she was banging her second husband and taken his daughter over to her second

1738
01:36:03.691 --> 01:36:04.890
husband's house in second husband.

1739
01:36:04.891 --> 01:36:06.240
He used to beat the shit out of her apparently.

1740
01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:09.540
So he's guys freaking out like about his daughter might be in danger.
You know,

1741
01:36:09.541 --> 01:36:11.430
this guy beat the shit out of his wife.
So he,

1742
01:36:11.480 --> 01:36:15.060
he hacks into her email to find out all this information.
What does that mean?

1743
01:36:15.061 --> 01:36:15.660
I don't know.

1744
01:36:15.660 --> 01:36:19.110
I think somehow or another he got her password that's hacking into it.

1745
01:36:19.310 --> 01:36:22.230
I mean it might've been as simple as she left the shit on,
you know,

1746
01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:26.940
on her Google password over,
just say a monitor on who knows what the fuck,

1747
01:36:27.030 --> 01:36:29.100
what the fuck really happened.
Right.
Attacking.
But anyway,
she,

1748
01:36:29.101 --> 01:36:32.070
she gets into this and finds out or he gets into this rather and finds out that

1749
01:36:32.071 --> 01:36:36.900
she's cheating.
So,
uh,
he,
um,
tries to get her,
uh,
her,

1750
01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:39.990
you know,
tries to get child support,
tries to get a custody rather,

1751
01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:42.880
and she sues him for um,

1752
01:36:42.930 --> 01:36:46.890
attacking or hacking into your email and this mother fucker is going to jail.

1753
01:36:46.950 --> 01:36:51.390
Wow.
Yeah.
He's like,
he's going to jail for some violation of some sort of a law.

1754
01:36:51.720 --> 01:36:54.020
Um,
I don't,
I don't know exactly what the law is,
but okay.

1755
01:36:54.090 --> 01:36:57.860
<v 6>It has allowed to Spca sounding while ever.
Its Megan's law.</v>

1756
01:36:57.910 --> 01:37:01.230
<v 3>I don't understand what the law,
yeah,
I don't,
I mean,
what is the law?</v>

1757
01:37:01.290 --> 01:37:04.460
I don't know.
I mean,
if someone's emails there and you know,

1758
01:37:04.461 --> 01:37:06.870
if you find out their password,
you know,

1759
01:37:06.871 --> 01:37:09.370
and you find out that they're doing some shit,
that's not,

1760
01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:13.280
<v 6>yeah.
Especially when like what is this?
Like what's this hacking part?</v>

1761
01:37:13.281 --> 01:37:14.720
Because that's retarded.

1762
01:37:14.721 --> 01:37:19.300
If your girlfriend uses your laptop and she stays logged in and then you just

1763
01:37:19.340 --> 01:37:22.490
turn on your computer and go hit her emails right there.
Yeah.
The pay.

1764
01:37:22.491 --> 01:37:25.480
Is that considered hacking?
Yeah,
it's apparently

1765
01:37:25.490 --> 01:37:30.080
<v 3>the,
the,
the prosecutors relied on a Michigan statute that was previously used to</v>

1766
01:37:30.081 --> 01:37:34.400
prosecute people who committed identity theft or they stole trade secrets.

1767
01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:39.440
<v 6>What does that like?
Typewriter ribbon ribbon,
you know,
like,
no,
no,
no,
no identity,</v>

1768
01:37:39.441 --> 01:37:39.500
any

1769
01:37:39.500 --> 01:37:41.390
<v 3>theft online.
You know,
there's,</v>

1770
01:37:41.391 --> 01:37:46.310
the law was created to stop identity theft online.
Right.
And so when they,

1771
01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:50.770
when they did that,
um,
the,
you know,
they,
they entered into this case,
they,

1772
01:37:50.771 --> 01:37:52.040
they use that law.

1773
01:37:52.190 --> 01:37:54.620
But that's like disingenuous because that's not what's going on.

1774
01:37:54.621 --> 01:37:55.860
This is a married couple.

1775
01:37:55.980 --> 01:37:59.760
<v 2>This isn't someone stealing someone's identity.
This is shitty.</v>

1776
01:37:59.790 --> 01:38:02.850
It seems like that would be a law that is like all your Maryborough,
sorry,
heat.

1777
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:05.520
You're allowed to own this person if you really want to.
How is,

1778
01:38:05.550 --> 01:38:09.870
how is reading an email different from reading a letter that's left around
right,

1779
01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:10.770
or a text message.

1780
01:38:10.910 --> 01:38:15.180
Like if you find a box of letters on your wife's bed and she's going to visit

1781
01:38:15.181 --> 01:38:17.250
some guy at prison and sucking his dick and I like,
you'd be like,

1782
01:38:17.251 --> 01:38:20.030
Whoa Damn Lincoln have to deal with this shit.
You know?

1783
01:38:20.430 --> 01:38:22.500
And especially like call it identity theft.

1784
01:38:22.501 --> 01:38:24.870
You can't call it identity theft if someone finds your diary.

1785
01:38:24.900 --> 01:38:27.630
Maybe that's why people wrote in cursive.
So it's kind of like,
you know,

1786
01:38:27.631 --> 01:38:29.710
to confuse people and like hide it.

1787
01:38:29.740 --> 01:38:31.350
Cause like I don't want you to read my letters.

1788
01:38:31.351 --> 01:38:33.330
I'm going to make it hard for you to read.
No Brian,

1789
01:38:33.331 --> 01:38:36.070
they wrote it in cursive because it's easier to write cursive that an to make

1790
01:38:36.090 --> 01:38:39.780
each individual letters.
He as they flow together and say this time I went,

1791
01:38:39.781 --> 01:38:40.111
I went,

1792
01:38:40.111 --> 01:38:44.430
I had did that open mic the other day and like I had to read the list of comics

1793
01:38:44.440 --> 01:38:49.000
to come up and a few of them still used cursive and it just boggled my mind was

1794
01:38:49.010 --> 01:38:51.030
like,
wait,
you're,
you're a straight male.
Right.

1795
01:38:51.130 --> 01:38:53.190
Why don't you just write some shit in Aramaic,

1796
01:38:53.250 --> 01:38:57.660
which is penises and draw your picture.
Yeah.
What is up with cursive?

1797
01:38:57.661 --> 01:39:02.610
I don't even um,
change my caps.
I use all,
uh,
I use all uppercase,

1798
01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:05.970
upper and lowercase.
What am I doing?
If I'm writing you something,

1799
01:39:06.110 --> 01:39:09.690
if I need to be expressive and something that I write and it's not going to be a

1800
01:39:09.691 --> 01:39:12.240
little letter writing me,
I'm writing something down.

1801
01:39:12.240 --> 01:39:16.470
If I'm writing something down 99.9% of the time it was either from me or I'm

1802
01:39:16.471 --> 01:39:19.140
filling out a customs form cause I'm landing in Canada or something like that.

1803
01:39:19.141 --> 01:39:21.030
You know,
I just use all capitals.
You know,

1804
01:39:21.031 --> 01:39:23.490
when the fuck I'm saying we should mention that our podcast,

1805
01:39:23.491 --> 01:39:28.290
it was picked in the top 10 of a iTunes.
Itunes chose like top 10,

1806
01:39:28.320 --> 01:39:31.860
uh,
audio podcast for 2010 and we're in there,
you know,

1807
01:39:31.861 --> 01:39:34.410
we've got to figure out something to do with this that's profitable.
Brian,

1808
01:39:34.620 --> 01:39:37.490
you've got to figure out how to make money with this podcast.
It's ridiculous.

1809
01:39:37.590 --> 01:39:38.560
All right,
we've got to figure out,

1810
01:39:39.150 --> 01:39:41.730
we've got to figure out how to turn this into some sort of a television show.

1811
01:39:41.790 --> 01:39:44.460
Well,
you know like companies like the CTO water.
Yes.

1812
01:39:44.461 --> 01:39:46.860
He told water center was holding up water free coconut water.

1813
01:39:46.890 --> 01:39:49.560
Thank you very much.
And apparently the other company,
yeah,

1814
01:39:49.561 --> 01:39:51.930
Amy and Brian is his contact me there.
Then they were like,
oh,

1815
01:39:51.931 --> 01:39:55.560
we want to send you some.
And so now there might be a coconut water bottle.

1816
01:39:55.890 --> 01:39:59.240
We should have like a taste test live and like big old.
Awesome.
Yeah,

1817
01:39:59.340 --> 01:40:01.280
they're both awesome.
I buy both of them all the time code.

1818
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:05.010
I want her so good for you man.
Tastes so good too.
It's like it's not too sweet.

1819
01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:08.550
It's not,
you don't feel like you're drinking soda.
It's,
it feels super healthy.

1820
01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:12.570
It's naturally isotonic.
It's naturally good at rehydrating.

1821
01:40:12.571 --> 01:40:14.530
You have a coconut water question.
Hey,

1822
01:40:14.560 --> 01:40:18.660
I've been buying these other kinds like Zinco that they have at the grocery

1823
01:40:18.661 --> 01:40:21.160
store.
It's like a milk carton,
coconut water.
Right.

1824
01:40:21.450 --> 01:40:24.360
And the other day I passed out with it in bed and then uh,

1825
01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:26.880
next day I looked at him like,
Huh,

1826
01:40:27.090 --> 01:40:30.330
I'd probably just throw it in the frigerator has the word water in it,
you know.

1827
01:40:30.360 --> 01:40:33.300
Is that something that you can leave out?
Cause it's not like a milk.

1828
01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:38.190
It's like a water.
Well I assume that it could go bad because ants find it.
Well,

1829
01:40:38.191 --> 01:40:41.850
I mean the middle crazy.
Oh,
a sealed and we don't have ants.
You,

1830
01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:43.740
you have ants in your house?
I live in never,

1831
01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:46.380
I've never seen an aunt at my house ever.
Really?
Yeah.

1832
01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:51.390
Well it's cause the roaches eat the mall.
Um,
I live in the woods,

1833
01:40:51.391 --> 01:40:53.770
man.
I've got rats and dear of deer.

1834
01:40:53.771 --> 01:40:55.780
My Yard all at your aunt's here though are like,

1835
01:40:55.870 --> 01:41:00.580
like documentary style ants though that you have like parade,
gay parade.
Yes.

1836
01:41:00.670 --> 01:41:05.320
Yeah.
Well,
you know,
the Mile March hits,
this house is surrounded by land,

1837
01:41:05.380 --> 01:41:07.690
you know,
and there's not a lot of shit out there for them to eat.

1838
01:41:07.691 --> 01:41:11.500
And so when they find that they can get inside and get to the mother load in the

1839
01:41:11.620 --> 01:41:13.840
garbage pill,
you know,
or the either the,

1840
01:41:13.841 --> 01:41:17.020
it's either the garbage pail or a plate that's left around these mother fuckers,

1841
01:41:17.021 --> 01:41:20.950
one scout will find it.
That would be cool if ants had like really big ants.

1842
01:41:20.951 --> 01:41:24.060
Like it would be like a bunch of ants and then like a huge like,
like you know,

1843
01:41:24.070 --> 01:41:28.690
boss battle ant that would like walk with them.
Answer.
So terrifying man.

1844
01:41:28.690 --> 01:41:32.290
I was watching this documentary on the uh,
the heartbeat eagle.

1845
01:41:32.291 --> 01:41:37.000
Somebody put it up on a Sunday to see that monkey eating.
Dude,

1846
01:41:37.210 --> 01:41:40.390
if you haven't seen this,
you've got to look at,
you got to look it up online.

1847
01:41:40.420 --> 01:41:44.560
If you can't find it at all,
it's on my Twitter from probably from yesterday.

1848
01:41:44.590 --> 01:41:48.590
You'll find it just,
I tweet a lot unfortunately too.

1849
01:41:48.610 --> 01:41:51.650
I remember when you posted it.
I fall in the morning.
I was watching it.
I'm like,

1850
01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.360
my friend who was with him,
he was like that Joe is watching,
uh,

1851
01:41:54.370 --> 01:41:58.600
documentaries on my animals at four 30.
Dude,

1852
01:41:58.601 --> 01:42:01.570
I all I do,
this is what I do.
I stay up,

1853
01:42:01.571 --> 01:42:05.020
I read with my daughter when she goes to bed,
she goes to bed at like,
you know,

1854
01:42:05.080 --> 01:42:06.820
whatever.
So when she goes to bed,

1855
01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:09.850
I read for our readers a little stories and then I start writing.

1856
01:42:09.910 --> 01:42:13.750
So once everybody's asleep because Mrs Rogan's asleep,
everyone's asleep.

1857
01:42:13.760 --> 01:42:17.080
Then there's no,
there's no noise.
The dogs are fed,
the dogs are inside sleeping.

1858
01:42:17.380 --> 01:42:19.930
Then I can write.
So I write from like,

1859
01:42:19.970 --> 01:42:23.980
usually from like 10:00 PM is when I really get cracking till like two in the

1860
01:42:23.981 --> 01:42:28.120
morning I start getting tired.
Right.
You know,
so I bang out two hours,
you know,

1861
01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:33.010
four hours and then just chill out at midnight.
Shit's great.
I just need,

1862
01:42:33.040 --> 01:42:34.890
it seems like the only problem is,

1863
01:42:34.891 --> 01:42:37.750
is that I find myself going to the same seven websites,

1864
01:42:37.751 --> 01:42:40.270
10 websites over and over and over and over again.

1865
01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:41.500
You gotta be careful about that.

1866
01:42:41.501 --> 01:42:43.470
You gotta be careful if you're going to write you you.

1867
01:42:43.510 --> 01:42:46.310
That's why I love that that program I've talked about on the show,
right?

1868
01:42:46.320 --> 01:42:46.900
Right room,

1869
01:42:46.900 --> 01:42:50.050
right rooms the best because it doesn't allow you to access the message.

1870
01:42:50.140 --> 01:42:52.060
You know,
you don't get to look at the browser.

1871
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:54.130
You know when you look at the status bar,

1872
01:42:54.131 --> 01:42:57.620
you don't look down at your task bar where all your programs are.

1873
01:42:57.621 --> 01:43:00.630
If you don't start fucking around and see what kind of movies do I have on this

1874
01:43:01.110 --> 01:43:03.850
hard drive.
Oh,
this is a cool documentary.
I haven't seen this before.

1875
01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:05.530
And then you'll just distract yourself with,

1876
01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:09.340
you got to force yourself to just write,
you know?
And once I do,
I love it.

1877
01:43:09.490 --> 01:43:12.460
It's such a weird thing about that,
about getting work done like that.

1878
01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:16.240
Like once when I write,
I'm like,
when I got something really that done that I,

1879
01:43:16.241 --> 01:43:19.570
that I really enjoy that I wrote like I feel so satisfied.
It feels like,

1880
01:43:19.571 --> 01:43:24.280
so like I'm like,
I feel energized.
I feel like I'm positive,
I feel good,

1881
01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:28.630
but it's so hard to just commit to working hard.

1882
01:43:29.170 --> 01:43:33.520
It is right.
It's hard to commit to sitting down and working when there's so many

1883
01:43:33.521 --> 01:43:37.170
distractions.
There's so many things you could do.
You know what the worst is,

1884
01:43:37.690 --> 01:43:40.810
especially like video editing is that you'd get to parts where it's like,

1885
01:43:40.811 --> 01:43:43.510
you know,
rendering and we'll say something like 30 minutes,
you know,

1886
01:43:43.630 --> 01:43:46.840
so you have to sit there for 30 minutes and you're not going to just sit there

1887
01:43:46.841 --> 01:43:48.550
and stare at the 30 minute sign.

1888
01:43:48.551 --> 01:43:52.070
You're going to look on the internet or you know what is and then you get

1889
01:43:52.071 --> 01:43:52.880
trapped in that.

1890
01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:57.740
What is like the baddest motherfucker rendering computer available?

1891
01:43:57.890 --> 01:44:02.890
Is it like some sort of a crazy PC with like multiple processes earlier?

1892
01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.210
Pretty much they all use the same chips honestly.

1893
01:44:05.370 --> 01:44:08.600
That like if you went balls crazy you'd want to get the,

1894
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:13.850
in my opinion this is what I would do is get one of the towers from Mac and get

1895
01:44:13.851 --> 01:44:17.450
the,
they have like you know the quadruple process or whatever it is and that you

1896
01:44:17.451 --> 01:44:21.280
get,
they have it now we can have like 32 gigs of Ram and and but the bay,

1897
01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:22.160
the biggest thing,

1898
01:44:22.161 --> 01:44:26.120
the thing that I think would help the most is getting an SSD card,

1899
01:44:26.180 --> 01:44:30.020
a hard drive at for your operating system for your programs,

1900
01:44:30.021 --> 01:44:35.021
for everything because that's the biggest thing that I've noticed with crashing

1901
01:44:35.721 --> 01:44:39.320
and and just time consuming as the right read.

1902
01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:43.520
Right on the hard drives and how slow regular hard drives is compared to

1903
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:47.500
compared to the SSD hard drives or SSD.
What Brian is talking about,

1904
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:48.710
solid state hard drives,

1905
01:44:48.711 --> 01:44:52.490
which is basically very similar to when you get a flash drive,
like a USB drive,

1906
01:44:52.491 --> 01:44:54.020
you stick it in and you can just record.

1907
01:44:54.110 --> 01:44:57.590
That's like a little mini hard drive and the little ones now are way bigger than

1908
01:44:57.591 --> 01:45:01.340
the first hard drives that I had.
Totally.
I mean I got a 32 gigabyte one.

1909
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:03.770
It's a little tiny thing that sticks in his 32 gigs.

1910
01:45:04.460 --> 01:45:06.500
My first hard drive was only four gigs.
Yeah.

1911
01:45:06.501 --> 01:45:08.870
If I could do like that's the thing I have the problem,

1912
01:45:08.900 --> 01:45:13.040
the biggest problem with mine is just the hard drive.
How much hard drive space,

1913
01:45:13.090 --> 01:45:15.320
uh,
in how fast that the rendering is.

1914
01:45:15.321 --> 01:45:17.710
And that's the thing you need to battle is rendering.
Yeah.

1915
01:45:18.080 --> 01:45:21.760
And so it's quicker to access off a solid state drive as well.
Oh yeah.

1916
01:45:22.170 --> 01:45:23.001
What you want those,

1917
01:45:23.001 --> 01:45:26.780
you want your applications running on it and you want like to have enough room

1918
01:45:26.781 --> 01:45:31.070
to have what projects and videos you're running off.
You want to run all off.

1919
01:45:31.071 --> 01:45:34.820
You understand the technology behind solid state as opposed to regular hard

1920
01:45:34.821 --> 01:45:37.910
drives.
Do you know which one does well,
there's no,
there's,
there's no,
uh,

1921
01:45:37.940 --> 01:45:39.970
you know,
moving parts,
moving parts at all.
It's,
it's,

1922
01:45:39.971 --> 01:45:44.780
it's doing what's going on there.
I don't know.
That's the problem and magic.

1923
01:45:45.130 --> 01:45:49.190
Yeah,
man.
I mean that's dragging tears and super crazy magic.

1924
01:45:49.220 --> 01:45:52.460
This one is totally silent.
This one is a solid state.
Hard drive.
One.

1925
01:45:52.640 --> 01:45:56.300
It's so silent.
Yeah.
It never said,
and everything pulls up instantly.

1926
01:45:56.360 --> 01:45:59.600
It's amazing.
You know,
like the,
the read times as far as like,
you know,

1927
01:45:59.870 --> 01:46:02.420
my old hard drive used to have to boot up and you would hear like this little

1928
01:46:02.421 --> 01:46:06.740
spin going on and then the,
the,
you know,
the program and run,
you know,

1929
01:46:06.741 --> 01:46:10.580
like my really old,
I have an old,
old Mac book.
Really old.

1930
01:46:10.581 --> 01:46:12.740
It's fat like a fucking,
when you close it,

1931
01:46:12.741 --> 01:46:16.520
it's like an old book and you pop that Bitch Open and when you turn on you hear

1932
01:46:16.521 --> 01:46:21.410
things spinning and clicking and chunking.
Alex,
that's it.
This laptop

1933
01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:26.420
and the little old goofy looking,
you know,

1934
01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:30.650
like ancient cartoon looking apple logo pops up.
Yeah.

1935
01:46:31.970 --> 01:46:33.180
Yeah.
So the,
the,
the,

1936
01:46:33.181 --> 01:46:37.230
the biggest one that apple offers is a 12 core 12 quartzy.

1937
01:46:37.310 --> 01:46:41.900
That's retarded processors.
That's retarded.
I wonder if you can,
if you select it,

1938
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:45.260
I wonder if you can like jack it up even all four.

1939
01:46:45.930 --> 01:46:49.230
That's all for just like rendering.
I'm sure you can jack it up.
Like,

1940
01:46:49.231 --> 01:46:52.830
you know what sucks though,
is like the machine I use.
Um,
I uh,

1941
01:46:52.831 --> 01:46:56.640
used to have a 2020 inch monitors,
my main monitor,

1942
01:46:56.850 --> 01:46:57.840
which is pretty small.

1943
01:46:57.990 --> 01:47:01.980
And then it would have like this big monitor for editing videos for timeline as

1944
01:47:01.990 --> 01:47:02.850
was a 30 inch monitor.

1945
01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:06.750
So I just replaced the 20 inch monitor to the other day with this view sonic.

1946
01:47:07.110 --> 01:47:10.360
And so now I have a 27 inch and a 30 inch but my butt.

1947
01:47:10.361 --> 01:47:14.840
But for some reason that's too much HD display for my Mac.

1948
01:47:14.841 --> 01:47:19.360
So now my s my cursor just go so slow now across the screens it's,

1949
01:47:19.790 --> 01:47:22.980
it's like the graphics card can't handle it.
It sucks.

1950
01:47:23.370 --> 01:47:28.370
Well I went with everything that you could possibly get and there are $12,699.

1951
01:47:30.270 --> 01:47:34.380
Yo,
that's what the hard drive.
How big of a hard drive is that?
That is well nuts.

1952
01:47:34.410 --> 01:47:37.410
Not even with everything.
Cause I'll go with 30 gigs of memory,

1953
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:42.410
32 gigs of memory and another thousand dollars and now we're up to $16,000.

1954
01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:43.740
You could get that memory cheaper.

1955
01:47:43.741 --> 01:47:46.410
Don't ever buy a memory from [inaudible] if you just wanted to get the big party

1956
01:47:46.411 --> 01:47:50.940
rolling,
but they'll do the hard drives.
That's all.
512 solid state,

1957
01:47:50.941 --> 01:47:55.500
512 512 foot 12 gigs.
And I got four of them that,
oh that's,

1958
01:47:55.520 --> 01:47:58.520
that's good.
I didn't know that they went up that high.
That was that would,

1959
01:47:58.950 --> 01:48:00.480
that would be a suite that you can get.

1960
01:48:00.481 --> 01:48:04.140
Like you can go and get a computer for fucking 500 bucks or you can get this

1961
01:48:04.141 --> 01:48:07.440
goddamn thing for 16,000 of you wanted to make your own.

1962
01:48:07.441 --> 01:48:08.670
That's the thing about windows though.

1963
01:48:08.671 --> 01:48:12.090
If you wanted to make your own computer that was equal in performance to this

1964
01:48:12.091 --> 01:48:16.090
computer,
you could probably do it for a tiny fraction of that money.
Really.

1965
01:48:16.100 --> 01:48:19.110
I mean cause I mean really,
I mean it's definitely going to be cheaper.

1966
01:48:19.111 --> 01:48:24.111
Like if if the smart thing to do is not to buy your SSD drives from apple,

1967
01:48:24.900 --> 01:48:25.561
you know you,

1968
01:48:25.561 --> 01:48:29.430
you get pretty much wanted to go to a store like Fry's electronics and pick up a

1969
01:48:29.431 --> 01:48:32.520
case and pick up hard drives and a motherboard and everything had put together

1970
01:48:32.521 --> 01:48:35.160
your own computer and make it to this kind of specifications.

1971
01:48:35.160 --> 01:48:36.720
How much you think of cost?
Well you,

1972
01:48:37.890 --> 01:48:40.800
if you had to guess it would be w 8,000 it would be pretty,

1973
01:48:40.950 --> 01:48:42.060
it would be pretty close.
No,

1974
01:48:42.061 --> 01:48:45.500
I actually would be pretty close because the fastest processor is still going to

1975
01:48:45.501 --> 01:48:49.410
be really expensive the fastest.
I mean that much ram,

1976
01:48:49.411 --> 01:48:51.840
it's still going to be pretty,
it's not going to be that much difference.

1977
01:48:51.841 --> 01:48:55.980
Like I think they priced out a macbook pro on someone like an Nan tech or

1978
01:48:55.981 --> 01:48:56.401
something like that.

1979
01:48:56.401 --> 01:49:00.990
They priced it out as like with the same like version of windows and it wasn't

1980
01:49:00.991 --> 01:49:04.980
that far off.
It was like 98 it was pretty close actually.
It's a Mac book pro.

1981
01:49:04.981 --> 01:49:09.300
This is like a high level tower where all we would do is you would just get the

1982
01:49:09.301 --> 01:49:10.830
bare bones processor,

1983
01:49:10.860 --> 01:49:14.730
whatever highest processes your wife don't get any as less ram as possible

1984
01:49:14.731 --> 01:49:17.550
through him as less hard drive space as possible for them.

1985
01:49:17.910 --> 01:49:21.510
You'd want to probably maybe even see what the graphics card option is,

1986
01:49:21.511 --> 01:49:25.950
go for the basic graphics card option and then buy all this shit separately.

1987
01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:29.220
But see this is maxed out though.
This is maxed out.

1988
01:49:29.221 --> 01:49:31.810
We're talking about Max that want the best hard drives,
right?

1989
01:49:31.830 --> 01:49:35.000
The best operating well with Vista video card.
Any,

1990
01:49:35.001 --> 01:49:36.780
any like alien ware or anything like that.

1991
01:49:36.781 --> 01:49:39.320
If you start maxing out different things,
they're like rent,

1992
01:49:39.390 --> 01:49:40.380
they're going to get you on Ram.

1993
01:49:40.381 --> 01:49:43.020
That's like when you buy something and they give you extras and they totally

1994
01:49:43.021 --> 01:49:44.640
know what you're saying about ordering from big companies.

1995
01:49:44.641 --> 01:49:46.740
But what I'm saying is that if you want to do it on your own,

1996
01:49:47.080 --> 01:49:48.110
if you wanted to go to your arm,

1997
01:49:48.120 --> 01:49:52.000
<v 3>no idea.
I have no idea.
I haven't built a computer and six years.</v>

1998
01:49:52.020 --> 01:49:54.200
It is kind of crazy though that you know.
So,

1999
01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:58.390
I mean the big percentage of the population in the country and the world rather

2000
01:49:58.391 --> 01:50:01.000
uses windows,
right?
Oh yeah.
Yeah.

2001
01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:04.960
I mean something like 70 or 80% than everybody that uses computers has windows.

2002
01:50:04.990 --> 01:50:08.050
Right.
But meanwhile they could viruses.
Yeah.

2003
01:50:08.470 --> 01:50:11.690
Have you ever heard of anybody getting a virus when you have an apple?
No.

2004
01:50:11.890 --> 01:50:15.490
To amps.
I know they exist.
Cunt bag pain in the ass are viruses.

2005
01:50:16.270 --> 01:50:18.670
That's the biggest fucking pain in the ass ever.
I mean,

2006
01:50:18.910 --> 01:50:22.530
I have had so many people on,
on the message board say,
you know when they're,

2007
01:50:22.531 --> 01:50:24.730
they're scared of clicking a link.
Like I'm not clicking that.

2008
01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:26.830
I want to click on that.
I've never looked at something and said,

2009
01:50:26.831 --> 01:50:29.500
I'm not clicking that right.
Cause I'm not worried about losing my shit.

2010
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:33.180
<v 6>That's one of the best things about apples and I'm sure everyone's going to</v>

2011
01:50:33.190 --> 01:50:36.740
start screaming.
They haven't invented them.

2012
01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:39.710
My favorite thing also is that,
that see what the PC is.

2013
01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:43.520
I used to build pcs most of my life.
I would get this graphics card,

2014
01:50:43.521 --> 01:50:46.730
this motherboard,
this memory,
this hard drive,
this,
this net.

2015
01:50:46.970 --> 01:50:50.960
The problem is that that windows has to have every be able to work on all these

2016
01:50:50.961 --> 01:50:54.950
variations of hard drives and different kinds of graphics cards.

2017
01:50:54.951 --> 01:50:59.540
Like it has to be super programmed for all these different combos with apple,

2018
01:50:59.810 --> 01:51:03.560
apple programs.
Exactly.
For the hardware it uses,

2019
01:51:03.561 --> 01:51:06.270
there's not a thousand different,
um,

2020
01:51:06.380 --> 01:51:10.910
graphics cards that go into the motherboard that,
that works in the apple,

2021
01:51:10.911 --> 01:51:14.300
you know,
so they got an apple motherboard or what they call it,
logic board,

2022
01:51:14.301 --> 01:51:15.030
which means it's more

2023
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:17.550
<v 3>expensive.
Totally know what you're saying to me.
They give you less choices.</v>

2024
01:51:17.551 --> 01:51:19.530
And because of that,
they build it all themselves.

2025
01:51:19.531 --> 01:51:22.620
So there's more fine tuned as an operating system on top of it because of the

2026
01:51:22.621 --> 01:51:25.020
hardware is apple hardware is what it is.

2027
01:51:25.130 --> 01:51:27.000
But there's something pretty dope about being able to go,

2028
01:51:27.001 --> 01:51:28.930
I used to love making my own computers.
I've,

2029
01:51:28.980 --> 01:51:33.660
I've done it at least twice where I went and got the whole deal motherboard

2030
01:51:33.661 --> 01:51:37.080
case,
put it all together,
spent,
you know,
God,
who knows how many hours,

2031
01:51:37.290 --> 01:51:40.050
but when you're actually finally online with some computer that you made

2032
01:51:40.051 --> 01:51:43.500
yourself,
that's pretty dope.
Yeah.
There's something fucking cool,
dude.
It was,

2033
01:51:43.501 --> 01:51:44.760
I'm like erector set style.

2034
01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:48.330
It's something bad ass about the fact that it's so cheap that you don't have to

2035
01:51:48.331 --> 01:51:52.170
do that anymore though.
I know,
but it's fun.
It's something fun to it.

2036
01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:53.730
Is it something super satisfying?

2037
01:51:53.970 --> 01:51:56.970
Like Dunkin has one of my computers but there's some super satisfying,

2038
01:51:56.980 --> 01:52:00.320
I put that shit together and I install the operating system.
You know,
I,

2039
01:52:00.321 --> 01:52:04.110
I tweaked the registry,
right.
I went into the Bios,
remember the,

2040
01:52:04.170 --> 01:52:07.690
what is it that are not the things you brought up?
Spacers.

2041
01:52:07.740 --> 01:52:10.690
What are those things that confuses or what are those things that used to have

2042
01:52:10.691 --> 01:52:13.880
to put out those were the worst because that it was like,
Oh do you have to uh,

2043
01:52:13.940 --> 01:52:17.550
yeah,
the tweezers to pull them in and it had to be different combos.

2044
01:52:17.551 --> 01:52:21.340
Like yeah,
there's a lot of annoying shit about making computers

2045
01:52:21.380 --> 01:52:24.310
<v 6>either like the shit would go into the bio's and having to change the frequency</v>

2046
01:52:24.311 --> 01:52:27.550
down or the ramp cache size if you have a different kind of graphics card.

2047
01:52:27.850 --> 01:52:29.430
So many annoying little,
yeah.

2048
01:52:29.630 --> 01:52:32.900
<v 3>How about dudes who would go into their full bios and overclocked or motherboard</v>

2049
01:52:32.901 --> 01:52:34.610
and then it was just slight tweaking.

2050
01:52:34.820 --> 01:52:38.810
Like dudes would buy celeron processors and tweak them so that they performed

2051
01:52:38.811 --> 01:52:40.970
like an intel,
like a pentium processor.

2052
01:52:41.340 --> 01:52:45.230
Sirens first came out and I was like that diet coke of computers was like

2053
01:52:45.770 --> 01:52:46.491
something missing,

2054
01:52:46.491 --> 01:52:49.330
but dudes would overclock the shit out of him and play quake with them.
Right.

2055
01:52:49.460 --> 01:52:50.690
Cause it was like super cheap.

2056
01:52:50.990 --> 01:52:54.920
There was even a few companies online that would overclock shit for you.

2057
01:52:55.070 --> 01:52:57.890
So they would build it for you.
Like super jacked,

2058
01:52:57.891 --> 01:53:02.800
like some super jacked giant heat sink on it.
Fans blowing all over it.
We,

2059
01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:07.840
they've got this poor little poor little a processor going just everything's

2060
01:53:07.850 --> 01:53:11.600
like jack to the Max,
like much higher than it's supposed to be.
Yeah.

2061
01:53:13.130 --> 01:53:13.790
Yeah.

2062
01:53:13.790 --> 01:53:17.180
The whole thing is interesting how quickly it's evolved from when I first got my

2063
01:53:17.181 --> 01:53:17.860
first computer,

2064
01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:22.460
it was a penny two 400 so it was a 400 megahertz.

2065
01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:27.230
Now is three 86 [inaudible] five three 86 three 86 how many megahertz is at

2066
01:53:27.260 --> 01:53:28.880
three 26 is it 380

2067
01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:32.320
<v 6>yeah.
Then it goes up to four 86 was my upgrade.
I was like,
Oh my God,</v>

2068
01:53:32.321 --> 01:53:34.750
I've got a 46 wow.
Amazing.

2069
01:53:35.040 --> 01:53:38.340
<v 3>Well,
I remember,
um,
when,
when I first got,
it was like the top of the line.</v>

2070
01:53:38.341 --> 01:53:43.110
It was a micron,
you know,
this is my first PC that I got and I remember thinking,

2071
01:53:43.260 --> 01:53:46.500
you know,
like,
wow,
you all this power and all this space and all this.

2072
01:53:46.680 --> 01:53:51.450
Now it's not even close to what your phone does.
Right.
That's amazing.
You know,

2073
01:53:51.451 --> 01:53:53.790
my phone has 32 gigs of space on it.

2074
01:53:53.850 --> 01:53:58.850
My first hard drive had four 32 gigs and my first first computer was 400

2075
01:53:59.131 --> 01:53:59.580
megahertz.

2076
01:53:59.580 --> 01:54:04.490
This is a thousand and it's in your pocket and it's thin as you know,

2077
01:54:04.560 --> 01:54:09.540
like a notebook.
It's amazing.
Yeah.
We live in strange ass times,
man.

2078
01:54:10.320 --> 01:54:11.970
We really do.
You know,

2079
01:54:12.510 --> 01:54:15.750
they can't put this guy in jail for this hacking his wife's fucking email now.

2080
01:54:15.751 --> 01:54:19.860
That's retarded.
Goddamn,
that's legit too,
right?

2081
01:54:20.560 --> 01:54:24.420
Oh yeah.
To know a hundred different sites.
It's legit.
It's on Fox News Son.

2082
01:54:24.450 --> 01:54:26.760
It's a Michigan man faces five years in prison.

2083
01:54:26.761 --> 01:54:30.930
If convicted of felony charges of hacking into his wife's email,

2084
01:54:31.050 --> 01:54:36.030
Leon Walker,
33 was busted after he accessed his wife,

2085
01:54:36.031 --> 01:54:40.110
Clara is account and discovered she was having an affair.

2086
01:54:40.230 --> 01:54:41.160
I love the account.

2087
01:54:41.161 --> 01:54:45.660
And then the big dash and discovered she was having an affair.

2088
01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:49.530
How does he not,
how does he go to jail on the whore?
Doesn't whore.

2089
01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:53.850
You need to go to drill whore.
Give me the baby,
give me the baby and go learn.

2090
01:54:53.851 --> 01:54:55.620
You need to go read books and do pushups.

2091
01:54:56.070 --> 01:55:00.760
You can't just fucking can't just go fuck your ex husband.
You Yukon.

2092
01:55:01.020 --> 01:55:04.740
Yeah,
with my baby can go over there.
Crazy whore.

2093
01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:06.930
So what's up message say to you Brian,

2094
01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:10.170
does it say don't hack into people's shit or does it say don't get caught?

2095
01:55:10.710 --> 01:55:11.700
<v 6>Uh,</v>

2096
01:55:11.730 --> 01:55:15.870
well if you're married and you have good reason to believe that your wife is

2097
01:55:15.871 --> 01:55:19.950
cheating on you,
then yes.
Get the upper hand so you know what's going on first.

2098
01:55:20.190 --> 01:55:22.950
You know gay,
cause that's marriage is different.

2099
01:55:22.951 --> 01:55:25.840
You want to have all your bases covered.
You want to,
it's like an attack plan

2100
01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:29.720
<v 3>spoken like a man who's experienced some crazy bitches.
Yeah</v>

2101
01:55:31.230 --> 01:55:32.760
<v 6>and always turn out.</v>

2102
01:55:32.880 --> 01:55:36.300
Turn on your record feature on your phone when you're fighting just in case

2103
01:55:36.301 --> 01:55:38.850
something gets crazy and you need proof.

2104
01:55:39.160 --> 01:55:42.140
How about how crazy have you ever had it?
Fun.
We've talked about it.

2105
01:55:42.141 --> 01:55:44.040
I've done a jail and if I had

2106
01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:47.410
<v 2>cell phones back then,
you know I would have been fucking recording night shit.</v>

2107
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:49.580
You would have been free.
It'd be a Freebie.
A free man.
Well,

2108
01:55:49.581 --> 01:55:50.820
I mean I was free already,

2109
01:55:50.821 --> 01:55:55.200
but it just took me money in a year and a half of court.
Isn't that crazy?

2110
01:55:55.201 --> 01:55:59.520
One nutty bitch blows one fuse one day and it affects you for,

2111
01:55:59.790 --> 01:56:02.880
you know,
a percentage of your life.
A year and a half.

2112
01:56:02.881 --> 01:56:07.740
It's like $10,000 to $12,000 and I fucking made like $40 a day.

2113
01:56:07.741 --> 01:56:12.000
Think about that.
If you live the perfect life and you lived a long,
long,

2114
01:56:12.001 --> 01:56:15.420
healthy life,
one year,
that's 1% of your life.

2115
01:56:15.540 --> 01:56:18.510
You had to give up 1% of the lie of dealing with this chick's bullshit.
Yeah.

2116
01:56:18.570 --> 01:56:22.620
My fucking job wouldn't even let me take off time anymore for the court.

2117
01:56:22.890 --> 01:56:26.420
I had to go to court like every couple of weeks,
you know,
it seemed like I can't,

2118
01:56:26.421 --> 01:56:27.930
I know it might be exaggerating a little bit.

2119
01:56:27.930 --> 01:56:31.920
I think I went to court like for 12 to 14 times and I remember having to always

2120
01:56:31.921 --> 01:56:32.700
call off work and they were,

2121
01:56:32.700 --> 01:56:35.850
they got to a point where like we can't give you any more fucking time.

2122
01:56:35.851 --> 01:56:37.200
You know we're going to have to replace you.

2123
01:56:37.201 --> 01:56:39.660
And I actually had to like find people that have worked for me.

2124
01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:45.360
Mother fucker.
Right.
All for just some nutty broad and nothing happened.

2125
01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:47.680
It's just craziness.
Just made up fantasy.

2126
01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:49.950
Actually didn't even pick up the charges.

2127
01:56:49.951 --> 01:56:52.430
She just said she got in a fight with her boyfriend and she,

2128
01:56:52.650 --> 01:56:56.270
I kicked her out of the house and the city picked up the charges cause there's

2129
01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:59.730
like the Oj Simpson law,
something like that.

2130
01:56:59.890 --> 01:57:03.000
Oh Jay costs you dude fucking Oj.
That's amazing.

2131
01:57:03.510 --> 01:57:07.980
If you lived a healthy life,
you'd be a 100 right?
A great life,
a great long life.

2132
01:57:08.160 --> 01:57:10.230
You're about a guide now.
He was a hundred you go,
wow,

2133
01:57:10.231 --> 01:57:15.150
that kind of lived a good life.
That's 1% of a hundred is a year.
Right?

2134
01:57:15.930 --> 01:57:19.190
That's craziness,
dude.
He gave up 1% of your life,
you know,

2135
01:57:19.410 --> 01:57:22.770
and then she's trying to add me on Facebook like a year and a half ago and I'm

2136
01:57:22.771 --> 01:57:26.610
like,
are you fucking kidding me?
That's hilarious.
What are you gonna do?

2137
01:57:26.690 --> 01:57:28.680
Like take pictures if I poke you.

2138
01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:33.740
Did she ever apologize?

2139
01:57:33.741 --> 01:57:38.000
Did she said she felt the day that that court dropped the charges and all that

2140
01:57:38.130 --> 01:57:41.010
or everything like that.
They were like,
you know,
dropped all the charges.

2141
01:57:41.640 --> 01:57:44.820
She wrote me or she called me and I have it on my voicemail.

2142
01:57:44.821 --> 01:57:46.530
I had it on my voice mail back in the day,

2143
01:57:46.531 --> 01:57:48.630
or answering machine back in the day where she's like,

2144
01:57:48.631 --> 01:57:50.880
I'm so sorry about everything.
You know?

2145
01:57:50.881 --> 01:57:55.860
I really hope that we can hang out soon and I just want you to know I'm very

2146
01:57:55.861 --> 01:57:59.720
sorry for her.
I didn't do any of this.
The state did it and blah,
blah.

2147
01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:02.400
You know what the crazy called the comps in the first place?
Huh?

2148
01:58:02.580 --> 01:58:03.930
She called the cops?
Yeah,

2149
01:58:03.931 --> 01:58:06.030
because what happened is I went and drive her home at night.

2150
01:58:06.210 --> 01:58:08.790
I kicked her out of my house.
I was like,
fuck you,

2151
01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:12.440
you're breaking my house after in the street.
I just shut her.

2152
01:58:12.441 --> 01:58:16.410
I just pushed her out the front doors and let the door.
No,
it's,
I don't know.

2153
01:58:16.411 --> 01:58:19.410
It was like,
did you expect her to get home?
Um,
I didn't care.

2154
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:21.900
She was breaking shit in my house.
I was like,
fuck her.

2155
01:58:22.020 --> 01:58:25.740
You get the fuck out of my house.
You know,
she was going crazy.

2156
01:58:25.741 --> 01:58:28.200
You should have called the cops at that point.
Then I should have,

2157
01:58:28.201 --> 01:58:31.830
I should know smashing my shit.
I want her out of here.
I should have put to me,

2158
01:58:31.831 --> 01:58:35.460
I was so pissed off that I just went upstairs and just went to bed because it

2159
01:58:35.461 --> 01:58:37.260
was like 2:00 AM or something like that.

2160
01:58:37.261 --> 01:58:39.480
So she called the cops and what did she tell the cops?

2161
01:58:39.510 --> 01:58:42.340
She said that my boyfriend and I had gotten an argument,

2162
01:58:42.340 --> 01:58:46.510
<v 6>he pushed me out of the house and then when and drive me home and the officers</v>

2163
01:58:46.511 --> 01:58:48.700
or what do you mean post?
Cause I actually did,
she wouldn't leave my house.

2164
01:58:48.730 --> 01:58:52.500
I opened the front door and I pushed her out,
not like fall on the ground,

2165
01:58:52.620 --> 01:58:56.170
you know,
or anything like that.
It was more like get on this side of the door,

2166
01:58:56.210 --> 01:59:00.910
all right,
door shut,
you know,
type of push and uh,
and the officer's like,

2167
01:59:00.940 --> 01:59:04.670
oh he pushed you,
he wouldn't drive you home.
And so they unlawful restraint.
They,

2168
01:59:04.740 --> 01:59:08.650
they got a blue one of the cops.
No,
but it was a girl cop.

2169
01:59:08.830 --> 01:59:13.240
But what was crazy is that when the,
when the beginning of the court case,

2170
01:59:13.241 --> 01:59:15.600
I don't think I've ever said this part,
whenever went to court case they made,

2171
01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:17.920
made you go to an anger therapist,

2172
01:59:17.950 --> 01:59:22.720
like a court appointed anger therapists where they just ask you questions to see

2173
01:59:22.721 --> 01:59:26.390
if you're crazy or not or you know,
or angry,
you know,
is that psychologists,

2174
01:59:26.470 --> 01:59:30.460
psychologists and then halfway through that guy he goes,
I'm sorry.

2175
01:59:30.460 --> 01:59:31.690
I am going to have to stop.

2176
01:59:31.691 --> 01:59:34.990
I actually know the other person that you did this with.

2177
01:59:34.991 --> 01:59:37.600
I went to high school with her and uh,

2178
01:59:37.630 --> 01:59:41.170
I'm going to have to have my assistant take on the rest of this interview.

2179
01:59:41.350 --> 01:59:43.990
And so the guy,
I'm like,
wait,
that's not fair.

2180
01:59:43.991 --> 01:59:47.560
This guy went to high school with her and said this other guy walks in and sits

2181
01:59:47.561 --> 01:59:50.920
down and goes because you know,
we continue to,
we leave and then yeah,

2182
01:59:50.921 --> 01:59:53.890
they told the court like,
oh yeah,
he's crazy.
He's angry,

2183
01:59:53.891 --> 01:59:55.680
he's mad and blah blah blah.

2184
01:59:55.690 --> 01:59:59.140
And so then I had to get a lawyer just to like tell the judge like that's not

2185
01:59:59.141 --> 02:00:02.230
fair that that the person went to high school with her that come on,

2186
02:00:02.231 --> 02:00:04.890
give me a break.
You got off of it though.
And then he brought in his friend.
Yeah.

2187
02:00:04.890 --> 02:00:08.320
Yeah.
But the debrief is friend and W.
Yeah,
absolutely.

2188
02:00:08.350 --> 02:00:11.260
So you think that he's like go after this Douche bag.
Well,
absolutely.

2189
02:00:11.320 --> 02:00:14.860
If you worked as a psychiatrist in your buddy from high school games and you're

2190
02:00:14.861 --> 02:00:16.240
probably going to be how on your side,

2191
02:00:16.270 --> 02:00:19.060
your buddy of your group that's especially if you were in love with it.
Right.

2192
02:00:19.080 --> 02:00:20.350
And especially as but anyways,

2193
02:00:20.440 --> 02:00:24.160
so we had to like go to court like three times and then like just to get the

2194
02:00:24.161 --> 02:00:25.120
judge to say,

2195
02:00:25.121 --> 02:00:28.540
okay that's bullshit yet we'll give you another psychiatrist to go to.

2196
02:00:28.690 --> 02:00:30.490
So of course I went to the other psychiatrists and they're like,
oh yeah,

2197
02:00:30.491 --> 02:00:32.860
he's fine.
He's completely normal.
And then they dropped all the charges.

2198
02:00:32.870 --> 02:00:34.750
Actually said that there was something wrong with you.

2199
02:00:35.260 --> 02:00:38.230
The first person where it's like they said that he's angry.

2200
02:00:38.231 --> 02:00:42.250
I could see that he will revolt in anger and will be fired.
Yeah.
I know.

2201
02:00:42.370 --> 02:00:45.880
I know this,
but this is also like what 10 years ago,
his name,

2202
02:00:46.560 --> 02:00:49.410
it was like 10 years ago.
I hadn't even not have that burned into your brain.

2203
02:00:49.430 --> 02:00:50.510
It was actually more than Texas.

2204
02:00:50.530 --> 02:00:54.640
I was 19 I would be making videos about that guy every day now.
Yeah.

2205
02:00:54.641 --> 02:00:57.640
Now that if I knew it for some high school pussy,
that's what it was.

2206
02:00:57.790 --> 02:01:00.520
High school chick that he was in love with and he wanted to get you locked in a

2207
02:01:00.521 --> 02:01:04.450
cage,
show her,
I could come and rescue you,
Brian,
right?
Or girl,

2208
02:01:04.480 --> 02:01:07.960
whatever her name is.
I called her you.
What is her name?
I'm not saying,

2209
02:01:07.961 --> 02:01:09.220
you know what I'm saying?
No content.

2210
02:01:09.221 --> 02:01:13.180
Mcgillicuddy healthy person when contraception.
And on that note,

2211
02:01:13.181 --> 02:01:16.720
ladies and gentlemen,
that's always a good way to end to show,
oh,

They did it before.
Um,

2221
02:01:47.240 --> 02:01:49.400
during the last UFC they watched the UFC,

2222
02:01:49.401 --> 02:01:52.220
they order it on paper view and then they sit there and talk about it while it's

2223
02:01:52.221 --> 02:01:55.340
going on and talk shit.
And it's a lot of fun.
And in between fights,

2224
02:01:55.341 --> 02:01:57.590
like if you're watching the fights and like,
you know,

We're going to figure out a way to do something with this and make it bigger.

Should have been our one year show,
but it was a day off.
It was the 23rd.

2256
02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:50.540
This is it.
This is really it.

Tensions is Christ.

That's what you gotta do.

2266
02:04:23.180 --> 02:04:24.620
You gotta get a TV show and TV show,

2267
02:04:24.621 --> 02:04:27.800
pumps up your Twitter and that pumps hyper stand up comedy shows that and

2268
02:04:27.890 --> 02:04:29.660
produce more comedy.
That's all happening.

2269
02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:33.080
It looks like my next comedy specials going to be filmed in Toronto.

2270
02:04:33.260 --> 02:04:37.040
Buckle the fuck up.
You dirty Canadian bitches cause I'm coming.

2271

I had such a good time last time I was in Toronto and in those is going to be a

2272
02:04:39.841 --> 02:04:41.100
UFC in Toronto in April.

2276
02:04:51.841 --> 02:04:56.130
Brian Red Band will be in tendons and an epic video will be made probably better

2277
02:04:56.131 --> 02:04:57.930
than the one that's out right now from Austin.

2278
02:04:58.260 --> 02:05:03.090
The Austin one is available right now and youtube.

2279
02:05:03.090 --> 02:05:05.280
N.
E.
T.
That's my channel.
I've said too much.

2280
02:05:05.281 --> 02:05:08.250
I'm tired of listening to my own fucking voice.
Good eye

2281
02:05:08.410 --> 02:05:10.630
<v 4>mandate of a war against the American people.</v>

2282
02:05:13.870 --> 02:05:14.700
Yep.

2283
02:05:14.700 --> 02:05:18.600
<v 6>Tyranny is enveloping the globe and the United States is a shining jewel.</v>

2284
02:05:18.780 --> 02:05:22.380
The globalist want to bring down and they will use terrorism as a pretext to get

2285
02:05:22.381 --> 02:05:24.840
it done.
So that's coming up in the second half of the show.

2286
02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:28.020
Very important information.

2287
02:05:28.021 --> 02:05:32.510
I'm going to put the call out that you call the White House and tell him,
look,

2288
02:05:32.511 --> 02:05:35.300
we've seen the new stories that you've wanted to blow things out,

2289
02:05:35.301 --> 02:05:39.050
that you have blown things up and that you're saying that 4 million of us are

2290
02:05:39.051 --> 02:05:41.930
going to die and we need martial law and the Associated Press

2291
02:05:43.800 --> 02:05:46.660
at one of your little drills you had,
this is Paris.

2292
02:05:46.940 --> 02:05:50.220
This is Alex Jones talking aware of who the terrorists are.
You can pull this,

2293
02:05:50.410 --> 02:05:53.320
this can stop the Shit Larian Reichstag event.

2294
02:05:55.190 --> 02:05:56.950
Maybe,
maybe just him

2295
02:05:57.870 --> 02:05:59.660
<v 4>tangle as a slam dunk.</v>

2296
02:06:03.250 --> 02:06:04.083
<v 3>What'd you do?</v>

2297
02:06:04.610 --> 02:06:06.510
<v 4>It's not the heart of this dog.</v>

2298
02:06:06.650 --> 02:06:11.650
There wasn't a real [inaudible] a warning on the clock to move ball,

2299
02:06:30.510 --> 02:06:33.210
another beat to soul strong.
Hold on and not get wicked.
