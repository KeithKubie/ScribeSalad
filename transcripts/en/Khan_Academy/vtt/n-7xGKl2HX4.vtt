00:00:00.403 --> 00:00:01.793
- [Instructor] The question
before us today is:

00:00:01.793 --> 00:00:04.665
why were Mongols so effective?

00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:08.647
How did they manage to take
an area, starting around here,

00:00:08.647 --> 00:00:11.130
and over the course of
20 years during the reign

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.990
of Genghis Khan, from about 1206 to 1227,

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.797
expand from this little part of Siberia,

00:00:17.797 --> 00:00:22.467
just south of Lake Baikal,
all the way into Central Asia?

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:26.193
This is what the Mongol
Empire looked like in 1206,

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:29.239
and this is what it looked like in 1279.

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:31.753
This here is Genghis-Khan time,

00:00:31.753 --> 00:00:36.647
and this here is around
the reign of Kublai Khan.

00:00:36.647 --> 00:00:39.129
What enables a spread of territory

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:42.137
on this scale in such a short time?

00:00:42.137 --> 00:00:45.796
The Mongols were not a centralized state.

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:47.098
They weren't a centralized empire.

00:00:47.098 --> 00:00:51.042
They were a band of traveling horsemen.

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:54.245
How did they end up taking this much land?

00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:55.875
The story of the Mongols is a story

00:00:55.875 --> 00:01:00.294
of a non-state actor
overcoming state actors,

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:04.461
of a decentralized power
becoming centralized eventually.

00:01:05.456 --> 00:01:07.080
What I wanna talk about in this video

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.913
is three reasons why the Mongols were

00:01:08.913 --> 00:01:12.175
so effective in beating
established empires.

00:01:12.175 --> 00:01:13.393
And then we're gonna talk about some

00:01:13.393 --> 00:01:15.381
of those follow-on effects.

00:01:15.381 --> 00:01:18.149
Reason one why the
Mongols were so effective

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.486
was planning, what we
might call logistics.

00:01:21.486 --> 00:01:22.944
When Genghis Kahn,

00:01:22.944 --> 00:01:25.542
lemme pull up a picture
of good ol' Genghis,

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:27.574
when Genghis was declared Emperor,

00:01:27.574 --> 00:01:29.833
or Great Khan, of the Mongols in 1206,

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:33.576
one of the first things he
did was reformat the army.

00:01:33.576 --> 00:01:37.478
He swept away tribal
affiliations and favoritism.

00:01:37.478 --> 00:01:40.165
If you were good, you got
to have a higher position;

00:01:40.165 --> 00:01:42.361
if you were bad, you didn't.

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:45.735
This meant that ordinary
people within the Mongol army

00:01:45.735 --> 00:01:48.904
felt that they could have a
measure of social mobility

00:01:48.904 --> 00:01:51.949
if they performed
especially well in the army.

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:54.710
This made them very
committed and very loyal.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.489
Reason number two: the Mongols
were extremely adaptable.

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:01.741
We're talking about a
group of horsemen here.

00:02:01.741 --> 00:02:06.370
These are the Mongols attacking
a group of Chinese soldiers.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.210
What they were used to was mounted combat

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:11.238
against mounted opponents.

00:02:11.238 --> 00:02:13.509
What they weren't used to was attacking

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:15.662
major cities and holding them,

00:02:15.662 --> 00:02:18.382
or even trying to get
major cities to break.

00:02:18.382 --> 00:02:21.101
But what the adaptability
of the Mongol army meant

00:02:21.101 --> 00:02:23.460
was that as they conquered new territories

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.978
and as they fought and won and lost

00:02:25.978 --> 00:02:28.781
in various regions of
Asia, so, for example,

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:32.078
as they started conquering
the Western Xia here,

00:02:32.078 --> 00:02:33.864
they learned siegecraft,

00:02:33.864 --> 00:02:38.048
and that's the art of attacking
walled cities and castles.

00:02:38.048 --> 00:02:40.891
It's a completely
different style of combat.

00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:43.653
What it involves is
sitting outside of a city,

00:02:43.653 --> 00:02:46.376
and waiting to starve out the inhabitants.

00:02:46.376 --> 00:02:49.186
Part of it involves using these
things called siege engines.

00:02:49.186 --> 00:02:51.181
This here is a kind of catapult.

00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:53.210
You can see here the rocks.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.055
The Mongols are waiting
with their archers here.

00:02:56.055 --> 00:02:58.453
The opponents have arrows, as well,

00:02:58.453 --> 00:03:00.683
but they're flinging rocks into the city

00:03:00.683 --> 00:03:03.362
in order to force a surrender.

00:03:03.362 --> 00:03:05.756
The Mongols didn't really
have this technology

00:03:05.756 --> 00:03:09.254
or these tactics when they
began their military campaigns;

00:03:09.254 --> 00:03:12.826
but as they rolled through
Central Asia they picked it up,

00:03:12.826 --> 00:03:15.550
and then they continued
to use those tactics

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:18.068
as they swept westward.

00:03:18.068 --> 00:03:21.561
Now, the third reason that
the Mongols were so effective

00:03:21.561 --> 00:03:24.228
is because they were terrifying.

00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:27.700
Even though they mastered siege warfare,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.933
in the beginning at least,
the Mongols were not prepared

00:03:29.933 --> 00:03:34.004
to hold a city once they had conquered it.

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:36.228
There are stories,
especially from the conquest

00:03:36.228 --> 00:03:39.361
of the Western Xia and the Northern Song

00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:42.063
and the Khwarazmian Empire over here,

00:03:42.063 --> 00:03:45.147
that tell of the Mongols winning a battle

00:03:45.147 --> 00:03:48.193
and then sweeping in
and murdering everyone.

00:03:48.193 --> 00:03:51.333
Just pulling plunder from corpses,

00:03:51.333 --> 00:03:53.867
and just looting the entire city,

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:56.182
and leaving nothing standing.

00:03:56.182 --> 00:03:58.092
Because the Mongols weren't
especially interested,

00:03:58.092 --> 00:04:00.651
at least early, we're
talking about the period

00:04:00.651 --> 00:04:04.514
of Genghis Khan's life
here, so, 1200s to 1220s,

00:04:04.514 --> 00:04:07.401
they weren't especially
interested in governing.

00:04:07.401 --> 00:04:09.722
They wanted to hold
territory, and get tribute,

00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:11.960
and get money, but they weren't especially

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.525
interested in running an empire.

00:04:14.525 --> 00:04:16.231
It actually made more sense to them

00:04:16.231 --> 00:04:19.230
to slaughter everybody
and take your things.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:20.853
Now, it got to the point
that this reputation

00:04:20.853 --> 00:04:25.183
for fearsomeness got so
powerful that some cities would

00:04:25.183 --> 00:04:29.350
just give up and surrender the
moment the Mongols arrived.

00:04:30.817 --> 00:04:33.656
Those are the three main
reasons that comprise

00:04:33.656 --> 00:04:36.624
Mongol effectiveness
against settled states.

00:04:36.624 --> 00:04:37.923
They were very good at planning.

00:04:37.923 --> 00:04:39.670
Everybody rode in their armies.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:41.663
They could move very quickly.

00:04:41.663 --> 00:04:43.409
The Mongols were extremely adaptable.

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:45.400
Every time they lost,
they learned something

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.673
from the people they lost
to, and that meant that

00:04:47.673 --> 00:04:50.762
they picked up new technologies
like siege warfare.

00:04:50.762 --> 00:04:52.662
And they were absolutely terrifying.

00:04:52.662 --> 00:04:55.504
Since, initially, the
Mongols didn't know what

00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:58.472
they were gonna do with a
conquered city besides loot it,

00:04:58.472 --> 00:05:00.628
they just killed everybody,
and that reputation

00:05:00.628 --> 00:05:04.729
really allowed them to conquer
a lot of land very quickly.

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:07.528
And so we see out of the Mongol conquest,

00:05:07.528 --> 00:05:11.309
there are many follow-on effects,
but one of the chief ones

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:15.476
is something called the Pax
Mongolica, the Mongolian Peace.

00:05:16.446 --> 00:05:17.884
If that phrasing looks familiar to you,

00:05:17.884 --> 00:05:20.442
it's because it's similar
to the Roman Peace,

00:05:20.442 --> 00:05:22.838
the Pax Romana; and the Chinese Peace,

00:05:22.838 --> 00:05:26.425
the Pax Sinica of the First Century CE.

00:05:26.425 --> 00:05:29.574
This is 1100 years later, but
the same principle applies.

00:05:29.574 --> 00:05:31.977
What happened was, with all
of this territory conquered

00:05:31.977 --> 00:05:36.367
under one ruling power,
it became safe to travel

00:05:36.367 --> 00:05:39.092
from one end of the empire to the other.

00:05:39.092 --> 00:05:42.101
Indeed, this is exactly what
Marco Polo did when he set off

00:05:42.101 --> 00:05:46.268
from Venice, and made his
way, eventually, to Beijing.

00:05:47.184 --> 00:05:50.512
That would've been around this time.

00:05:50.512 --> 00:05:53.794
Marco Polo's book, The Book
of the Marvels of the World,

00:05:53.794 --> 00:05:55.622
was published in 1300.

00:05:55.622 --> 00:06:00.372
Marco Polo was this Venetian
trader and adventurer

00:06:00.372 --> 00:06:03.479
who traveled extensively throughout Asia.

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:07.543
That's one result of the Mongol conquests,

00:06:07.543 --> 00:06:08.966
is this Mongolian Peace.

00:06:08.966 --> 00:06:10.626
I should say that this Mongolian Peace

00:06:10.626 --> 00:06:12.534
came at a terrible price.

00:06:12.534 --> 00:06:14.241
When we were talking about
that terror of the Mongols,

00:06:14.241 --> 00:06:15.907
that's a for-real thing.

00:06:15.907 --> 00:06:19.081
They murdered millions of people.

00:06:19.081 --> 00:06:21.967
But what would come
after the Mongol Conquest

00:06:21.967 --> 00:06:24.568
as a result of this peace
would end up killing

00:06:24.568 --> 00:06:28.800
even more people than the
Mongol Conquest itself.

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:32.334
This pacified region,
this Mongolian Peace,

00:06:32.334 --> 00:06:35.385
led to increased trade
throughout East Asia

00:06:35.385 --> 00:06:39.532
and reconnecting it to
Eurasia and the Arab States.

00:06:39.532 --> 00:06:41.974
That would result in the
exchanges of new ideas

00:06:41.974 --> 00:06:45.710
and new technologies and
new agricultural techniques.

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:47.668
But, as trade always does,

00:06:47.668 --> 00:06:50.916
it also results in the
exchange of diseases.

00:06:50.916 --> 00:06:53.762
And so, out of the
Mongol homeland, in fact,

00:06:53.762 --> 00:06:57.221
comes this illness
called the Black Plague,

00:06:57.221 --> 00:06:58.845
or Bubonic Plague.

00:06:58.845 --> 00:07:01.242
Because of the stability of trade

00:07:01.242 --> 00:07:04.338
that had been established
by the Mongol Peace,

00:07:04.338 --> 00:07:07.301
it makes it so much easier
for this illness to sweep

00:07:07.301 --> 00:07:10.635
across Asia and Europe,
killing even more people than

00:07:10.635 --> 00:07:14.441
even Genghis Khan could've
achieved during his lifetime.
