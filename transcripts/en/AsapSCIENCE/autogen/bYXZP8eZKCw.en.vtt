00:00:00.111 --> 00:00:04.361
 We all have medical alternatives we trust, I mean nothing better than a pot 

00:00:04.361 --> 00:00:09.161
 From the chicken soup is true hot? Well, it turned out that he might actually have an anti-inflammatory effect 

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:14.071
 As it prevents neutrophils, a type of white blood cells from moving, slowing down 

00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:18.301
 The neutrophil movement prevents the cells from gathering in the area of ​​the lungs and thus 

00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:19.381
 Eliminates congestion. 

00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:23.751
 But perhaps you have also heard the words "feed the cold and hunger of the fever" - if it should 

00:00:23.751 --> 00:00:29.290
 Only eat soup from time to time? This seems to be only half the truth. in both cases 

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.041
 You should actually eat nutritious food, which provides your body with energy to recover automatically 

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:38.501
 It increases something called interferon gamma - an essential component of the prevention of 

00:00:38.501 --> 00:00:40.861
 Both viral and bacterial infections 

00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:45.931
 So what about eating an apple? Because an apple a day keeps the doctor away, right? Well ... to some extent! 

00:00:45.931 --> 00:00:52.451
 100 grams of apples contain the same antioxidant strength as 1500 grams of vitamin C 

00:00:52.451 --> 00:00:56.010
 Which shows that it inhibits the growth of both liver tumors and cancerous colon 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.440
 Its rich flavonoids are also associated with reduced risk of infection 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.711
 Coronary heart disease. This can be associated with reduced visits to the doctor, and as a medicine 

00:01:05.711 --> 00:01:10.261
 Preventing your general health, its effect on the common cold is still debatable 

00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:14.431
 If and for taking too much vitamin C, whether in the form of lemon or other foods 

00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:18.571
 Or pills? In a double-blind study, "this type of study or research means that both the researcher and the volunteer in the study do not know the dangerous area of ​​the experiment and study," it did not reduce the incidence 

00:01:18.571 --> 00:01:23.721
 Common cold. However, the duration of the cold has been significantly reduced, this may be due to 

00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:27.871
 Increase T cell growth of white blood cells that help in immune response 

00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:32.351
 It also increases the secretion of interferon, which stimulates virus-infected cells 

00:01:32.351 --> 00:01:35.051
 To produce their antiviral defenses 

00:01:35.051 --> 00:01:38.611
 If you need an immediate cure for coughing or sleeping difficulties 

00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:44.031
 From a respiratory infection, honey will help you! Known for its antibacterial activity, increases 

00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:48.551
 From the release of cytokines that give signals to cells to repair themselves 

00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:52.651
 And garlic? Not only vampires, but proved to reduce duration 

00:01:52.651 --> 00:01:57.141
 The unit of cold and flu symptoms, by increasing the growth of gamma-delta-T cells 

00:01:57.141 --> 00:02:01.391
 Natural killer cells, able to capture and remove extraneous objects 

00:02:01.391 --> 00:02:02.461
 More effectively 

00:02:02.461 --> 00:02:07.371
 Have you ever tried quenching? It is one of the most popular herbal supplements, and for good reason 

00:02:07.371 --> 00:02:12.131
 In the "meta-analysis" on 14 studies, eugenics reduced chances of occurrence of the cold 

00:02:12.131 --> 00:02:18.871
 By 58% and reduced the cold by about a day and a half today, it acts as an anti-inflammatory 

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:22.901
 It is similar to other alternatives that affect the production of cytokines in the body 

00:02:22.901 --> 00:02:26.951
 And as long as you are in the same subject, I sensed some drink - with a little alcohol. Seriously some studies 

00:02:26.951 --> 00:02:31.371
 I found that moderate amounts of alcohol can support your immunity. But before 

00:02:31.371 --> 00:02:35.681
 To open a bottle of alcohol, take into account that their alcoholics are weaker 

00:02:35.681 --> 00:02:36.490
 Immune system 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:41.481
 If all other alternatives fail, water, rest and time will cure you 

00:02:41.481 --> 00:02:46.100
 If any of the cold treatments is just an old and false myth? We will reveal the greatest myths of the disease that you are
