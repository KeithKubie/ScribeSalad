00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.790
So let's see if we can get a
big picture of everything

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.760
that's happening in this credit
default swap market.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:08.350
I'll speak in generalities.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:15.950
Let's say we have Corporation
A, Corporation

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.420
B, Corporation C.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.950
And let's say we have a bunch of
people who write the credit

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:26.830
default swaps, and I'll
call them insurers.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.740
Because that's essentially what
a credit default swap is,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.250
it's insurance on debt.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.710
If someone doesn't pay the
debt, then the insurance

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:35.790
company will pay it for you.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.230
In exchange, you're essentially
giving some of the

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.200
interest on the debt.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.710
So let's say we have Insurer
1, let's say we

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.050
have Insurer 2.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.040
And some of these were insurance
companies, some of

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.290
these were banks.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.210
Some of these may have even
been hedge funds.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.120
So these are the people who
write the credit default

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.930
swaps, and then there are the
people who would actually buy

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.000
the credit default swaps.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.590
In the previous example, I had
Pension Fund 1, that was my

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.780
pension fund.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:16.920
Then you could have another
pension fund, Pension Fund 2.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.950
Let's re-draw some of the
connections between the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.420
organizations.

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:32.680
Let's say Pension Fund 1 were
to lend $1 billion to A.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.895
A will pay Pension Fund 1 10%.

00:01:38.895 --> 00:01:42.770
But Pension Fund 1 wants to
make sure that they'll

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.140
definitely get the money,
because they can't lend money

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.360
to people with anything less
than stellar credit ratings.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.360
So they get some insurance
from Insurer 1.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.570
So what they do is out of this
10%, they pay them some of the

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.380
basis points.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.190
So let's say they pay them
100 basis points.

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:06.550
And in exchange, they get-- I'll
call it Insurance On A.

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.639
This is this new notation
that I'm creating.

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.490
They get Insurance On A.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.450
Fair enough.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.820
And the reason why this I1, this
first insurer was able to

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.890
do that is because Moody's
has given them a

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.380
very high credit rating.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.400
And so when they insure
something, you're essentially

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.340
the total package, right?

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.000
The loan to this guy, plus the
insurance, kind of is like

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.750
you're lending the money to
this guy, but you're just

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.990
getting more insurance-- I
mean you're getting more

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.080
interest, right?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.305
So this bond becomes
a Double A bond.

00:02:38.305 --> 00:02:42.250
Because the odds that you are
not going to get your money

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.780
are not the odds that this guy
defaults, but it's now the

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.550
odds that this guy defaults.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.420
And Moody's or the standard is
poor, as I've already said.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.860
Hey, these guys are good for
their money, they're Double A

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:54.180
or whatever.

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.960
So now your risk is really a
Double A risk and not a Double

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.140
B risk, or whatever.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.980
But anyway, this happens.

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.880
This is Corporation B, and maybe
Pension Fund 2 wants to

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.420
lend to Corporation B.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.710
Maybe they lend them
$2 billion.

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.005
They get, I don't know, they get
12%, maybe Corporation B

00:03:16.005 --> 00:03:17.590
is a little bit more
dangerous.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.340
But once again, they go
to this first insurer.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.470
And maybe they get some of it--
well let's just say they

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.720
get Insurance On B.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.470
And B is a little bit riskier,
so they have to

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.800
pay 200 basis points.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.780
200 basis points goes from
Pension Fund 2 to B.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.560
Now this, already, this is a
little bit dangerous, right?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.280
Because you can think about
what's happening.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.730
One, as long as this insurer
does not get a downgrade from

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:47.000
their credit ratings from S&amp;P
or Moody's or whoever, they

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.860
can just keep it issuing
this insurance.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.080
There's no limit for how much
insurance they can issue.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.890
There's no law that says, you
know what, if you insure a

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.930
billion dollars of debt,
you have to put a

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.180
billion dollars aside.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.960
So that if that debt defaults,
you definitely have that

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.300
billion dollars there.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.650
Or if you insure 2 billion here,
you don't have to put

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:08.890
that 2 billion aside.

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.820
What you have is a bunch of
people who statistically say,

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.640
oh, you know, what's the
probability that all of this

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.180
debt defaults?

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.640
So I just have to keep enough
capital so that

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.399
probabilistically, whatever debt
defaults, I can pay it.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:23.360
But you don't keep enough
capital to pay all of the

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.340
defaulting debt.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.540
So you already see an
interesting risk forming.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.180
What if all of these
corporations, for whatever

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.900
reason, do start defaulting
simultaneously?

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:36.090
Then all of a sudden this
insurance company has to pay

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.050
more out in insurance then it
might even have. So you have

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.080
to wonder whether it even
deserves this Double A rating,

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.040
because it actually is taking
on a lot of risk.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.240
But in the short term, while
these companies are-- everyone

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.600
is doing well and the economy's
doing well, it's a

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.030
great business for these guys.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.540
These guys are just collecting
premiums essentially on the

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.200
insurance, without having
to pay out anything.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.440
Now let's add another
twist on it.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.800
These pension funds, P1 and P2,
it was reasonable for them

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.530
to get insurance, because they
were giving out these loans

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:07.470
and then they got
the insurance.

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.500
So they were essentially hedging
the default risk by

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.380
buying these credit default
swaps, which was essentially

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.790
just an insurance policy
from this Insurer 1.

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:18.790
But you can have
another party.

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.690
This is no less legitimate,
really.

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.460
But you could call them-- I
don't know-- let's call it

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.710
Hedge Fund 1.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.640
And they've done a lot of work,
and frankly, they often

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.820
are much more sophisticated
than the pension fund-- in

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.830
fact, they almost always are.

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:35.440
And they say, you know what?

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.650
Company B looks really, really,
really, really shady.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:44.370
I think 200 basis points for
the chance that Company B

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.770
defaults is frankly cheap.

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:48.890
Because I think there's
a huge probability

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.450
that Company B defaults.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:52.390
So what I'm going to do, I'm
not going to lend Company B

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.350
money, because if anything, I
think that they're maybe about

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.600
to go out of business.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.960
But what I can do is I can buy
a credit default swap on

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.480
Company B's debt.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.910
Which is, essentially, I'm
getting insurance that they

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.330
fail without actually
lending the money.

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:10.310
So let's say I do that
from Insurer 2.

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.220
So I can go and I'll pay Insurer
2 200 basis points a

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.810
year, or 2% on the notional
value of the

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:22.050
insurance I'm getting.

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:25.260
So let's say it's 200 basis
points, and let's say that's

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.390
Insurance On-- I'm making a big
bet-- so they're going to

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:39.350
give me Insurance On B for--
I don't know-- $10 billion.

00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:42.310
And something interesting is
going on here already.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.910
B might not have even borrowed
$10 billion, right?

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:48.230
So all of a sudden you have
this hedge fund that is

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.300
getting insurance on more
debt than B has even

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:53.140
borrowed money on, right?

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:55.690
And it's essentially, you just
kind of have this side bet

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.220
between these two parties.

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.400
This party says,
you know what?

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:59.410
I think it's a good deal.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.170
I get 200 basis points on the 10
billion every year, as long

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.110
as B doesn't default.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.950
And this guy says, I think
B's going to default.

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:08.180
So I think that's a good
deal on that insurance.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.040
And just so you understand the
math, so the notional value is

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.320
$10 billion.

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.200
So what's 2% of 10 billion?

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:23.710
2% on a billion is 20 million,
so it's $200 million.

00:07:23.710 --> 00:07:25.360
200 if I did my math correct.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.690
So they'll pay $200 million
a year to this insurer.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:33.020
So the 200 basis points
on 10 billion is

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.280
equal to 200 million.

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.910
These numbers maybe are a little
bit on the big side,

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.620
but who knows?

00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:40.000
Actually, this could be
a huge hedge fund.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.210
This could be a $10 billion
hedge fund.

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:47.200
Or even worse, maybe it's a
billion dollar hedge fund, or

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:51.430
maybe it's a $20 million hedge
fund, but they've taken a $180

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:55.700
million loan to essentially
buy this insurance because

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:58.450
they think that B's collapse
is imminent.

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:00.890
So they're willing to take
that bet right now.

00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:02.270
You know, it might
be a good bet.

00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:06.680
If B collapses tomorrow,
what's going to happen?

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:09.410
They only dished out maybe 200
million for maybe that first

00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:11.480
year, although you normally pay
it on a quarterly basis.

00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:13.680
So they'll pay 50 million
every three months.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:16.150
Let's say they pay the first
payment, 50 million, right?

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.280
And then over the next three
months, B just goes bankrupt

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.410
and people realize that debt
was worth nothing.

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.220
Then these guys get
$10 billion.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:26.290
Right?

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:28.340
But something else is
interesting here.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:30.670
They probably did insurance to
a lot of other people too,

00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.549
maybe on B's debt.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:33.950
Right?

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.150
Or maybe they also
insured A's debt.

00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:39.809
So maybe they gave
some insurance on

00:08:39.809 --> 00:08:42.750
A's debt, as well.

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.780
So what happens?

00:08:43.780 --> 00:08:49.310
Let's say B all of a
sudden defaults.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.230
So a couple of things happen.

00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:57.480
I1 is going to owe P2
$2 billion, right?

00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.740
I2, the second insurer, is going
to owe this hedge fund

00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:02.840
$10 billion.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:06.270
Now let's just assume I2's
good for the money.

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:09.610
They have $10 billion they
pay to this hedge fund.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:12.370
This hedge fund is great, they
get great bonuses for the year

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:14.720
and they go buy yachts,
et cetera.

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:17.970
But this insurer right here,
they pay the money they were

00:09:17.970 --> 00:09:20.560
good for but something
interesting might happen.

00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:24.310
All of a sudden Moody's finally
wakes up, these

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.710
ratings agencies, and
says, oh, my God.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:28.100
Well, there's a couple of things
that might make them

00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:29.150
say, oh, my God.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:30.660
First of all, they might
say, oh, look.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.250
You have to pay out
$10 billion.

00:09:33.250 --> 00:09:35.470
And I doubt that was the only
person you have to pay, maybe

00:09:35.470 --> 00:09:36.670
they have to pay out
a lot of money.

00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:41.680
Now I2, Insurance Company 2,
you are undercapitalized.

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:45.390
I am now going to downgrade
your rating.

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.400
So, you were Double A, but since
you had to give out all

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:53.810
of this capital, Moody's is now
going to downgrade you to,

00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:55.520
I don't know, B+.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.570
I'm just making these
ratings up.

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.620
But that's the sound of how
these ratings happen, right.

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.250
A is better, B is worse.

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:04.410
The more A's you have,
the better it is.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:10.120
But all of a sudden, when this
guy is B+, and this guy

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.590
insured, let's say, some other
corporation's debt for this

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.500
pension fund, now all of a
sudden this insurance that

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.560
this pension fund had is no
longer Double A Insurance.

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.500
It's now B+ Insurance, and maybe
this pension fund, by

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:28.400
its charter, can't hold
something that

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.220
has a B+ credit rating.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:32.430
So they're going to have to
unwind the transaction, or

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.220
maybe they'll have to unload
the debt that was insured.

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:42.680
So one, just by Company B
defaulting, maybe this guy was

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:45.650
holding some of Company A's
debt, and it was insured by

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.900
Insurance Company 1.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:48.630
Now they're going to have
to unload that debt.

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:52.370
So just one default creates this
chain reaction, right?

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.080
This one default happens, this
guy has to pay this guy money,

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:58.090
then this guy gets
undercapitalized since they

00:10:58.090 --> 00:10:59.480
have to pay out money.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.680
Then Moody's says, oh, my God,
you're undercapitalized.

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.180
We're going to reduce
your ratings.

00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.530
Maybe this guy was insuring
some of A's debt, but now

00:11:07.530 --> 00:11:11.860
since he was insuring some of
A's debt, all of a sudden that

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:14.480
insurance is worth less because
it has a lower rating.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:18.965
And now A's debt, less people
want to hold it, because there

00:11:18.965 --> 00:11:20.360
are less people to insure it.

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.110
I know that's very confusing,
but this is really the point

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:27.140
that Warren Buffett was saying
when he said that the credit

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.550
defaults swap market, or in
general, the derivative

00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:33.060
market, are financial weapons
of mass destruction.

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.570
Because you have so many people
who didn't have to set

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:36.590
aside a capital, right?

00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:39.800
This guy could insure $10
billion worth of debt without

00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:41.740
having to set aside
$10 billion.

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.620
And you have so many people
making all of these side bets,

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:46.910
but they're all making
two core assumptions.

00:11:46.910 --> 00:11:50.490
One, that these rating
agencies's ratings are valid.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:52.810
And two, that the other person
is good for the money.

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:55.420
But if all of a sudden you have
one failure someplace in

00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.740
the system, you could have
this cascade where one,

00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.300
there's just a lot
of downgrades.

00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:01.260
And then a lot of the people
end up not being

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:03.010
good for the money.
