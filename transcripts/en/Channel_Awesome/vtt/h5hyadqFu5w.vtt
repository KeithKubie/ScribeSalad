00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.580
*Disneycember Theme plays*

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.140
*Groans* Cinderella II: Dreams Come True.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.120
and if you think that title is unbelievably boring and generic, well

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.100
you just summed up this entire sequel.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.360
Why do people think there needs to be more than "Happily ever after"?

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.660
That's a perfectly good ending, it's the most popular ending of all time!

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.020
But no! This thrilling fairy tale needs to continue,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.220
with the Fairy Godmother now living in the palace for some reason.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.640
(I guess she wasn't happy just living as a pile of sparkling dust, however that works.)

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.760
but instead, she likes to read to her mice friends!

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.200
But, oh no! they want to do something nice for "Cinderellie"!

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.940
This is the major concern of the film.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.140
so she recommends they make a book with all the fascinating stories that happened in the castle.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:58.240
That's right! all three of them.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.280
Because that's all that's worth telling in an hour and a half, and honestly I don't even now if those are really worth telling.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.200
Yep, it's another one of those anthology stories

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.200
where they just throw three stories together, don't really connect them that well

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.260
and, well, everybody suffers for it.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.820
The first story is about Cinderella learning how to be a princess.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.100
She has to learn how to dance right, and dress right,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.500
and turn away commoners, and cook boring food.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.880
It's *Hard*.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.880
But it's okay! some R&amp;B pop songs help her out!

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.360
Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo, So This is Love, all these classic songs?

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.780
Hell with that shit that nobody will ever remember!

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.520
now we have pop songs, sung by pop singers whose names nobody will remember, even if they sneeze it by accident!

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.580
You want a real good laugh? Fast-forward to the credits and hear their R&amp;B version of Bibbidi Bobbidi Boo

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.080
I'm not even kidding.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:47.580
It's pretty hilarious.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.580
But that's just one of the three boring-ass stories!

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.000
Jack is apparently tired of being a mouse,

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.260
so the Fairy Godmother turns him into a human!

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.680
But being a human is *really hard!* you can guess where this bullshit goes from there.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.140
The last story is about her step-sister, Anastasia, wanting to get a date for the ball.

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.520
The fact that ANY of them would go to the ball after everything that's happened is kinda funny, but

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.780
what's even funnier is that Cinderella is TOTALLY okay with helping her out.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.860
Yeah, all that sabotaging, locking her in a room? All forgiven!

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.080
Cinderella just wants her to discover how to be her true self!

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.660
But being her true self is *HARD!* *groans*

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.340
This sequel, in so many ways, reminds me of Belle's Magical World.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.040
right down to all the stories that they try to tell and don't really tie them together.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.540
Is it quite as bad as that one? I guess not.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.960
I mean, the animation is ten times better than it deserves to be.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.060
And give them some credit, they did try to tie it together, even if it was very loosely.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.880
and they kept the stories really short, just down to three.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.640
But, big shock, none of these stories are really interesting, and definitely not worthy of the title "Cinderella II."

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.240
At least Beauty and the Beast didn't call it "Beauty and the Beast III."

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.760
This is marketed as a direct sequel, and it's obviously not!

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.180
It's just some stories they threw together.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.940
But, come on. haven't you always wanted to hear Cinderella say "This hair? EW!"

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.100
CINDERELLA: This hair! EW!

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:12.160
And haven't you ever wanted to see Lucifer wearing a Rastafarian hat?

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:13.480
Oh my god, WHAT!?

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.820
*stuttering* OH IT'S SO STUPID!

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.800
The only thing that *kinda* likeable in this whole thing, (again, aside from the animation.)

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.860
is, surprisingly, Anastasia is *kind of* a likeable character.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.560
I know I made fun of the fact Cinderella helps her out, and yeah in the story it doesn't make sense, but

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.820
the way they animate her and the way the voice acting is done, I do genuinely kind of feel sorry for her.

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.200
It's the one thing I didn't really expect, and I guess it's actually done kind of okay.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.540
I don't know, I feel they did a surprising, if not sporadic, job of suddenly making her kinda likeable.

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:51.080
But what does it matter? They still put her in the same bullshit stories with the same misunderstandings that

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:57.620
suddenly make everybody turn away and go "Oh no! he doesn't love me!" all that bullshit.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.780
This movie's stupid. This movie's pointless. This movie's dumb.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.880
I enjoy the animation, but that kinda makes me hate it even more!

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.140
This animation could have gone to something so much better!

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.640
I feel like it's just wasted! Everything is wasted! Except the opportunity!

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.000
because there is no opportunity, so you can't even call it a wasted opportunity!

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:22.640
I guess, if you have a little, little kid and they just wanna see Cinderella in a palace, try on dresses, spin around, all that nonsense

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.440
It's fine, I mean there's nothing ethically wrong for them, or anything.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.560
But if you wanna show them a fairy tale that'll enchant and delight, this shoe is definitely on the wrong friggin' foot.

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.960
CINDERELLA: Ew!
