00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.140
In the last video we learned
what it meant to take the

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.900
product of two matrices.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.330
So if we have one matrix A, and
it's an m by n matrix, and

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.120
then we have some other
matrix B, let's say

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.270
that's an n by k matrix.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:26.040
And we've defined the product
of A and B to be equal to--

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.080
And actually before I define the
product, let me just write

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.610
B out as just a collection
of column vectors.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.460
So we know that B can be written
as a column vector b1,

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.050
another column vector b2, and
all the way it's going to have

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:44.230
k of them because it has exactly
k columns, so bk.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.540
So the last video we defined the
product of A and B , and

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:52.390
they have to have the columns
of A have to be the same as

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.120
the rows of B in order for
this to be well-defined.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.960
But we define this product to
be equal to A times each of

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.310
the column vectors of B.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.640
So it's equal to-- let me switch
back to that color--

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.160
it's equal to A times-- do it in
the color that I did it-- A

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:15.830
times b1, and then the second
column of our product is going

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.590
to be A times b2.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.840
Our third product is going to be
A times b3, all the way to

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.120
A times bk.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.930
Right there.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.280
And the whole motivation for
this, you've probably you've

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.110
seen this before, maybe in your
Algebra II class-- it

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.330
might have not been defined
exactly this way, but this is

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.315
the equivalent to what you
probably saw in your Algebra

00:01:52.315 --> 00:01:55.040
II class-- but the neat thing
about this definition is that

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.480
the motivation came from the
composition of two linear

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.390
transformations whose
transformation matrices were

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:03.670
the matrices A and B.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.600
And I showed you that
in the last video.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.975
With that said, let's actually
compute some matrix-matrix

00:02:08.975 --> 00:02:11.510
products just so you
get the hang of it.

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.310
So let's say that I
have the matrix A.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:25.490
Let's say that A is equal to the
matrix 1, minus 1, 2, 0,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.050
minus 2, and 1.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.900
I keep the numbers low to keep
our arithmetic fairly

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.100
straightforward.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:38.900
And let's say that I have the
matrix B, and let's say that

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:49.520
it is equal to 1, 0, 1, 1,
2, 0, 1, minus 1, and

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:56.200
then 3, 1, 0, 2.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.220
So A is a 2 by 3 matrix,
2 rows, 3 columns.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.530
And B is a 3 by 4 matrix.

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.140
So by our definition, what
is the product AB

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.380
going to be equal to?

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.980
Well, we know it's well-defined
because the

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.590
number of columns here is equal
to the number of rows,

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.900
so we can actually take these
matrix vector products--

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:27.280
you'll see that in a second-- so
AB is equal to the matrix A

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.970
times the column vector,
1, 2, 3.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.720
That's going to be the first
column in our product matrix.

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.160
And the second one is going to
be the matrix A times the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.910
column 0, 0, 1.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.190
The third column is going to
be the matrix A times the

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:50.260
column vector 1, 1, 0.

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.190
And then the fourth column in
our product vector is going to

00:03:53.190 --> 00:04:00.680
be the matrix A times the column
vector 1, minus 1, 2.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.770
And this, when we write it like
this, it should be clear

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:07.620
why this has to be, why the
number of columns in A have to

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:12.460
be the number of rows in B,
because the column vectors in

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.500
B are going to have the same
number of components as the

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.470
number of rows in B, so all of
the column vectors in B-- so

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.540
if we call this B1, B2, B3, B4,
all of my bi's-- let me

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:29.020
write it this way-- all of my
bi's where this i could be 1,

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.470
2, or 3, or 4, are all
members of R3.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.530
So we only have matrix vector
products well-defined when the

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:42.270
number of columns in your
matrix are equivalent to

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.690
essentially the dimensionality
of your vectors.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.810
That's why that number
and that number

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.150
has to be the same.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.280
Well, now we've reduced our
matrix-matrix product problem

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.200
to just four different matrix
vector product problems, so we

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.550
can just multiply these.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.690
This is nothing new to
us, so let's do it.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.060
And so what is this equal to?

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:10.140
So AB,-- let me rewrite it--
AB, my product vector, is

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:14.320
going to be equal to-- so this
first column is the matrix A

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.030
times the column
vector 1, 2, 3.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.250
And how did we define that?

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.550
Remember, one way to think about
it is that this is equal

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:24.760
to the-- you can kind of think
of it as the-- each of the

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:30.890
rows of A dotted with the column
here of B, or even

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.420
better, this is the transpose
of some matrix, right?

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:36.330
Let me write this this way.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:42.650
If a is equal to-- sorry-- the
transpose of some vector,

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.110
let's say that a is equal to the
column vector 0, minus 1,

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.710
2, then a transpose-- and
I haven't talked about

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:53.630
transposes a lot yet, but I
think you get the idea.

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.240
You just changed all of the
columns into rows-- so a

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.550
transpose will just be equal
to 0, minus 1, 2.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.760
You just go from a column
vector to a row vector.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.270
So if we called this thing here,
a transpose, then when

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:13.810
we take the product of our
matrix A times this vector, we

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.960
essentially are just taking A
and dotting with this guy for

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.420
our first row and our
first column.

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:23.450
So let me do it that
way, so let me

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.650
write it in that notation.

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.610
So this is going to be the
matrix-- or sorry-- the vector

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:32.880
1, minus 1, 2.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.090
That's essentially, that row
right there represented as a

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.650
column dotted with 1, 2, 3.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.420
Actually, let me do it in that
color just so I can later

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.040
switch to one color to make
things simple-- but dotted

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:48.020
with 1, 2, 3.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.520
So we just took that row, or, I
guess the column equivalent

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.280
of that row, and dotted
with this.

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:55.620
And I wrote it like this because
we've only defined dot

00:06:55.620 --> 00:06:56.800
products for column vectors.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.410
I could do it maybe for row
vectors, but we don't need to

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:02.330
make a new definition.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.530
So that's going to be the first
entry in this matrix

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:07.210
vector product.

00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:11.370
The second entry is going to
be the second row of A

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:14.810
essentially dotted with this
vector right there, so it's

00:07:14.810 --> 00:07:23.270
going to be equal to 0, minus 2,
and 1, dotted with 1, 2, 3.

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.230
And we just keep doing that--
and I'll just switch maybe to

00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:34.430
one neutral color now-- so
that A times 0, 0, 1.

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:37.510
That's going to be the first row
of A expressed as a column

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.420
vector, so we can write
it like this, 1, minus

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:46.890
1, 2 dot 0, 0, 1.

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.640
And then, actually, and then
we have our and then the

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:54.770
second row of A dotted with this
column vector, so we have

00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:01.830
0, minus 2, 1, dotted
with 0, 0, 1.

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:02.800
Two more rows left.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:06.090
This can get a little tedious
and it's inevitable that I'll

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.390
probably make a careless
mistake, but as long as you

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:11.560
understand the process, that's
the important thing.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.900
So the next one, this row of A
expressed as a column vector,

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.990
1, minus 1, 2, and we're going
to dot it with this vector

00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:23.630
right there, 1, 1, 0.

00:08:23.630 --> 00:08:27.830
And then this row of A-- I can
just look over here as well--

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:33.730
0, minus 2, 1, dotted
with 1, 1, 0.

00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:37.380
And then finally the last two
entries are going to be the

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.690
top row of A, 1, minus 1, 2,
dotted with this column

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:47.840
vector, 1, minus 1, 2-- a little
dot there, remember

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:50.630
we're taking the dot product--
and then finally this second

00:08:50.630 --> 00:08:57.460
row of A, so 0, minus 2, 1,
dotted with this column

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:02.100
vector, 1, minus 1, 2.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:05.250
And that is going to be our
product matrix-- and this

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.190
looks very complicated right
now but now we just have to

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.270
compute it, and dot products
tend to simplify things a good

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:13.320
bit-- so what is our matrix--
our product-- going to

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:14.690
simplify to?

00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:16.750
I'll do it in pink.

00:09:16.750 --> 00:09:21.370
AB is equal to-- draw the
matrix right there.

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.190
So what is the dot product
of these two things?

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:24.140
It's 1 times 1.

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:24.820
I'll just write it out.

00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:31.040
It's 1 times 1, I'll just write,
1 times 1 is 1, plus

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:38.270
minus 1 times 2, so minus 2,
plus 2 times 3, plus 6.

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:42.470
Now we'll do this term right
here, 0 times 1 is 0, plus

00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:46.290
minus 2 times 2, so that's
minus 4, plus 1

00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:48.730
times 3, plus 3.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:52.490
Now we're on to this term, 1
times 0 is 0, plus minus 1

00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:57.400
times 0, plus 0, plus 2 times
1 is equal to plus 2.

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:01.980
This term, 0 times 0 is 0, plus
minus 2 times 0-- let me

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:06.530
write it 0 plus minus 2 times
0 is 0, plus 1 times 1.

00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:11.340
So plus 1, and here you have 1
times 1 is 1, plus minus 1

00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:15.360
times 1 is minus 1, plus
2 times 0, so plus 0.

00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:22.880
Here 0 times 1 is 0, 2 minus 2
times 1 is minus 2, and then 1

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:25.680
times 0 is plus 0.

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.400
Almost done.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:33.880
1 times 1 is 1; minus 1 times
minus 1 is 1; 2 times 2 is 4.

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:40.740
Finally, 0 times 1 is 0; minus
2 times minus 1 is 2.

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:43.870
1 times 2 is also 2.

00:10:43.870 --> 00:10:46.210
And we're in the home stretch,
so now we just have to add up

00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:47.360
these values.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:52.570
So our dot product of the two
matrices is equal to the 2 by

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:58.190
4 matrix, 1 minus 2 plus 6.

00:10:58.190 --> 00:11:00.200
That's equal to 5.

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.960
Minus 4 plus 3 is minus 1.

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.700
This is just 2.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.450
This is just 1.

00:11:06.450 --> 00:11:11.090
Then we have 1 minus 1 plus 0
is just 0, minus 2, right?

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:15.110
We just have a minus 2 there, 1
plus 1 plus 4 is 6, and then

00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.680
2 plus 2 is 4.

00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:19.580
And we are done.

00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.210
The product of A B is equal
to this matrix right here.

00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:24.290
Let me get my A and B back.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.525
We can talk a little bit more
about what this product

00:11:26.525 --> 00:11:28.386
actually represented.

00:11:28.386 --> 00:11:30.650
So let me copy and paste this.

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:38.160
Let me scroll down
a little bit.

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.870
Go down here, paste.

00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:43.120
There you go.

00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:45.190
So this was our A and our B.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:48.150
And when we took the product
we got this matrix here.

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:49.990
Now there is another couple of
interesting things to notice.

00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:53.900
Remember, I only said that
this product is only

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:57.500
well-defined when the number
of columns in A is equal to

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.350
the number of rows in B.

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.480
So that was the case
in this situation.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.610
And then notice, we got a 2 by
4 matrix, which is the number

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:11.300
of rows in A times the number
of columns in B.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:13.470
So we got a 2 by 4 matrix.

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:16.890
So another natural question is,
could we have found, or is

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:21.760
it even equal, if we were
to take the product BA?

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:24.250
If we were to even take
the product BA.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:27.320
So if we tried to apply our
definition there, what would

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.195
it be equal to?

00:12:28.195 --> 00:12:33.610
It would be equal to the matrix
B times the column 1,

00:12:33.610 --> 00:12:39.090
0, then the matrix B times the
column minus 1, minus 2.

00:12:39.090 --> 00:12:41.150
And then it would be
the matrix B times

00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:43.740
the column 2, 1.

00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:47.070
Now, can we take this matrix
vector product?

00:12:47.070 --> 00:12:52.350
We have a 3 by 4-- this right
here is a 3 by 4 matrix, and

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:55.390
this guy right here
is a member of R2.

00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:56.440
So this is not well-defined.

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:59.910
We have more columns here than
entries here, so we have never

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.950
defined a matrix vector
product like this.

00:13:02.950 --> 00:13:05.680
So not only is this
not equal to this,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.920
it's not even defined.

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:16.520
So it's not defined when you
take a 3 by 4 matrix, and you

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:19.130
take the product of that
with a 2 by 4 matrix.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.740
It's not defined because
that number and that

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.410
number is not equal.

00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:26.030
And so obviously since this
is defined and this isn't

00:13:26.030 --> 00:13:29.600
defined, you know that AB is
not always equal to BA.

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:32.240
In fact, it's not usually equal
to BA, and sometimes

00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.160
it's not even defined.

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.610
And the last point I want to
make is, you probably learned

00:13:37.610 --> 00:13:41.550
to do matrix-matrix products in
Algebra II, but you didn't

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:44.150
have any motivation for what you
were doing, but now we do

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.450
have a motivation.

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:48.690
Because when you're taking the
product of A and B, we learned

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:54.710
in the last video that if we
have two transformations,

00:13:54.710 --> 00:14:00.390
let's say we have the
transformation, S is a

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:12.590
transformation from R3 to R2,
and that S is represented by

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:13.710
the matrix.

00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:18.700
So S, given some matrix in
R3, if you'd apply the

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.340
transformation S to it, it's
equivalent to multiplying

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:26.000
that, or given any vector
in R3, applying the

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.350
transformation S is equivalent
to multiplying that

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:30.320
vector times A.

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.460
We can say that.

00:14:31.460 --> 00:14:35.380
And I used R3 and R2 because the
number of columns in A is

00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.580
3, so it can apply to a
three-dimensional vector.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.890
And similarly, we can imagine
B as being the matrix

00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:45.450
transformation of some
transformation, T, that is a

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:58.660
mapping from R4 to R3, where if
you give it some vector x

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.190
in R4, it will produce-- you
take the product of that with

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:07.420
B, and you're going to get
some vector in R3.

00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:11.140
Now, if we think of the
composition of the two-- so

00:15:11.140 --> 00:15:14.570
let's think about it a little
bit-- if we have R4 here-- let

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:25.560
me switch colors-- we have R4
here, we have R3 here, and

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:32.020
then we have R2 here.

00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:35.360
T is a transformation
from R4 to R3.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:37.390
So T would look like that.

00:15:37.390 --> 00:15:41.150
T is a transformation
and it's B times x.

00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.740
That's what T is equal to, so
T is this transformation.

00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.710
And then S is a transformation
from R3 to R2.

00:15:48.710 --> 00:15:50.650
So S looks like that.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.480
And S is equivalent to
A times any vector in

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.660
R3, so that is S.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:01.420
So now we know how to visualize,
or how to think

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.140
about, what the product
of A and B are.

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:09.480
The product of A and B is
essentially, you apply the

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.770
transformation B first-- so
let me think of it-- the

00:16:13.770 --> 00:16:19.870
composition of S-- let me write
it this way-- so what is

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:23.270
the composition of S with T?

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:31.830
This is equal to-- of x-- this
is equal to S of T of x.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:35.300
So you take a transformation
from R4 to R3, and then you

00:16:35.300 --> 00:16:40.780
take the S transformation from
R3 to R2, so this is S of T.

00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:47.150
S of T is a transformation from
R4 all the way to R2.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.340
And then the neat thing about
this, if you were to just

00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:51.710
write this out in its matrix
representations-- we did this

00:16:51.710 --> 00:16:56.150
in the last video-- this would
be equal to the S matrix A

00:16:56.150 --> 00:17:03.200
times this vector right
here, which is Bx.

00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:06.390
But now we know that the
matrix-- by our definition of

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:10.700
matrix vector products-- that
this guy right here is going

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.972
to have a transformation.

00:17:11.972 --> 00:17:17.930
It's going to be equal to-- So
the composition S of T of x is

00:17:17.930 --> 00:17:23.180
going to be equal to the
matrix AB, based on our

00:17:23.180 --> 00:17:26.050
definition, so the
transformation AB

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.190
times some vector x.

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:29.960
So the reason why I'm going all
this is because we just

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.820
did a matrix-matrix
product up here.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:35.680
We took the pain of multiplying
the matrix A times

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:38.060
the matrix B and we got this
value here-- and hopefully I

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.880
didn't make any careless
mistakes.

00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:43.150
But the big idea here, the idea
that you probably weren't

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:45.910
exposed to in your Algebra II
class, is that this is the

00:17:45.910 --> 00:17:51.650
matrix of the composition of the
transformations S and T.

00:17:51.650 --> 00:17:55.780
So right here, it's the matrix
of the composition of S and T.

00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.970
So you're not just blindly doing
some-- matrix-matrix

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:01.260
products can be pretty tedious,
but now you know what

00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:01.900
they're for.

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:04.240
They're actually for the
composition of two

00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:07.940
transformations where each of A
and B are the transformation

00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:10.440
matrices for each of the
individual linear

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.490
transformations.

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:13.920
Anyway, hopefully you
found that useful.
