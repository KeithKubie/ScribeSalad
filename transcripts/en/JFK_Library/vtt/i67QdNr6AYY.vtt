00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:04.480
- For courage, not
complacency, is our need today,

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.710
leadership, not salesmanship.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.640
And the only valid test of leadership

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.010
is the ability to lead
and lead vigorously.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:16.180
- Courage was the quality
- The entire nation.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.750
- that my grandfather,
President Kennedy, most admired.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.700
And the Profiles in
Courage Award celebrates

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.770
political leaders who demonstrate
that courage in our time.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.810
- This is the moment when
we know what we must do,

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.543
when we know what is right.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.040
We cannot walk away from this truth.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.280
- Mayor Landrieu decided
to proceed with relocating

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.220
four Confederate monuments
in the city of New Orleans

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.470
despite facing intense
criticism for that decision,

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.230
and it was a very heated moment,

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.350
heated political moment for him,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.380
and he decided to not
only remove the statues,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.610
but to candidly and compassionately

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.230
address his city and our
country and offer an explanation

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:58.760
and give historical context about

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.400
why that decision was the right one.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.980
- This is not about politics.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.280
It's not about blame.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.173
It's not about retaliation.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.150
This is not about a naive quest

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.970
to solve all of our problems at once.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.400
- In a year marked by
continued racial strife

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.310
and conflict and absent national
leadership on this issue,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.810
the mayor took it upon himself

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.530
to offer an example of political courage

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.503
on an issue that could not
be more important today.
