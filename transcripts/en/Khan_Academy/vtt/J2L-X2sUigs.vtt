00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.030
- [Voiceover] So we have some words here

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:03.680
that relate the different reactions

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.520
and whether they absorb or release

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.150
different types of energy.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.750
So the first word here, exothermic.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.190
Exothermic the root of the word is therm

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.430
which relates to heat
and these word indeed

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.180
means a reaction that releases heat.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.140
Releases, it releases heat.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.420
And one way to think about
it if you're thinking about

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.920
constant pressures or change in enthalpy

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.940
it can be viewed as your,

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.350
how much heat you absorb or release.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.220
So a negative change in enthalpy

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:40.720
means that you're releasing heat.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.550
One way to think of, if you
view enthalpy as heat content

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.160
you have less heat content
after the reaction than before

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.880
it was meant you release heat.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.210
Which means you're change
in enthalpy is going to be

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.150
less than zero so these
all mean the same thing.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.130
Well, this is true.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.420
You're releasing heat.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.950
This is a same thing as
releasing heat if you talk about

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:02.680
constant pressure.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.400
Constant pressure which is a reasonable

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.950
assumption if you're doing
something in a beaker

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.110
that's open to the air
or if you're thinking

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.750
about a lot of different
biological systems.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.220
Now based on that logic what
do you think this word means,

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:17.620
endothermic.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:21.730
Well endothermic, therm

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.890
same root and now your prefix is endo

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.010
so this is a process that absorbs heat.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.970
Absorbs heat.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.850
Or if you're thinking
of a constant pressure,

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.080
you can say your enthalpy
after the reaction

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.760
is gonna be higher than the
enthalpy before the reaction.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:42.720
So your delta H is going to be

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.920
greater than zero.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.670
All right, fair enough.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.850
Now let's look at these
two characters over here.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.090
Exergonic and endergonic

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.450
so exergonic the root here is ergon

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.600
and you might not be as familiar with that

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.610
as you are with therm
but you might have heard

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.960
the word ergonomic.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.620
Say, hey that's a nice ergonomic desk.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.250
That means it's a desk
that's good to do work at

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.090
or it's a nice ergonomic chair.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:09.690
An ergon does indeed come
from the Greek for work.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.900
And so exergonic is a reaction
that releases work energy

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.000
or at least that's what the word implies.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.370
Releases, let me do
that in the same color.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.060
This is something that is going to

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.940
release work

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.420
energy.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.950
And endergonic, same logic,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.520
well that's gonna be
something based on just

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.220
the way the word is setup
that absorbs work energy

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.000
or uses work

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.790
energy.

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.350
Now one of our variables

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.290
or properties that we can
use to think about energy

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.520
that can be used for
work is Gibbs free energy

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.950
and the formula for Gibbs free energy,

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.050
if we're thinking about constant
pressure and temperature,

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.510
so let me write that down.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.090
So if we're talking
about constant pressure

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.390
and temperature then the formula

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.390
for Gibbs free energy or
you can even view this

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.820
as a definition of Gibbs free energy.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.820
The change in Gibbs free energy,

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.520
let me do this in another color.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.940
The change in Gibbs
free energy is equal to

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.940
our change in enthalpy

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.960
minus, use in the different color.

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.960
Minus our temperature

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.990
times our change in entropy

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.310
and if this looks
completely foreign to you,

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.920
I encourage you to watch the video

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.350
on Gibbs free energy but the reason why

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.640
this is related to energy for work

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.640
is okay, look I have my,

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.120
whether I'm absorbing
or I'm releasing heat

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.450
and I'm subtracting out entropy
which is kind of the energy

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.790
that is going to the
disorder of the universe

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.870
and what's left over is the
energy that I can do for work.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.580
That's one way to think about it.

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.520
So you can see that
this relates work energy

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.770
to change in enthalpy right over here.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:13.530
So exergonic, something that releases

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.090
work energy could say
that has less work energy

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.040
after the reaction than before it,

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.490
your delta G is going
to be less than zero.

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:22.260
So let me write that down.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:27.220
So here our delta G is
going to be less than zero

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.270
and these things, these
are reactions that release

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.670
work energy, we've seen it

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.980
in the video on Gibss free energy.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.480
We consider this to be spontaneous.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.010
Spontaneous.

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:39.370
These are going to move forward.

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:43.390
So these over here, the ones
that absorb work energy,

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:45.130
well they're gonna have more work energy

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.720
in the system than before is
one way to think about it.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.760
So your delta G

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.700
is going to be greater than zero

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.020
and we say these are not spontaneous.

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.020
So these are not spontaneous.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.090
Now that we have the
definitions out of the way

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.510
and we have a way to
relate these variables,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:06.490
let's look at these
different scenarios of things

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.470
that are exothermic and exergonic

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.720
or exothermic and endergonic and see why

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:12.690
they make an intuitive sense.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:16.050
So in this first reaction
it's exothermic, our delta H

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.380
is less than zero.

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.770
That means it has less
enthalpy after the reaction

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.710
than before which means it released heat

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.150
and so you can see here,
this heat is being released.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.890
And where did that energy come from?

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.820
Well when it bonds

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.020
in this new configurations on a net basis

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.450
the electrons are able to
go to lower energy states

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.270
and release that energy.

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.790
And heat, if you're thinking
about in a microscopic scale

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.723
it's something that's
raising your temperature

00:05:39.723 --> 00:05:42.200
at least locally which it
means just about transferring

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.720
kinetic energy to these
microscopic molecules.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.150
Remember when you're talking
about heat or temperature

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:48.870
you're thinking about
these macro variables

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.060
but on a microscopic variable,

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.720
you're talking about kinetic
energies and potential energies

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.720
and things like that.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.331
So what's happening is these electrons

00:05:55.331 --> 00:05:57.650
or when they get into a new configuration

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.750
and they're going to release energy

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:04.210
and that can be transferred
to the individual molecules.

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:06.750
So you see here, we've released energy

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.420
and we also have an increase in entropy.

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:11.440
We have more entropy after the reaction

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.420
than before the reaction.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.320
We have more objects right over here,

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.760
there's more states in which
they could actually be in

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.920
and they're actually moving faster.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:22.210
So this one, we see if you just apply,

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.120
if you apply the formula over here

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.090
this is gonna be less than zero.

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.770
This over here, delta S is
going to be greater than zero.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:30.870
The temperature, that's
gonna be absolute temperature

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.320
in terms of Kelvin so it's
always going to be positive

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.190
and so this whole term
is going to be positive

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.630
so you're gonna have a
negative, minus a positive

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:39.750
it's going to be negative.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:42.730
So our delta G

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.150
is going to be less than zero and we see

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.060
that this is spontaneous.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:47.700
This is going to move
forward and it makes sense,

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.920
it releases energy, the electrons like it.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.010
It creates a more disordered state.

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:53.470
Another way to think
about it is think about

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:55.500
trying to do the reaction the other way,

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:58.060
you're gonna have to get some
energy for those electrons

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.450
to get into a higher
energy state when they form

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:01.600
these new bonds your gonna have to get

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.040
these four constituents
together in the exact right way.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.120
That seems a lot less likely to happen

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.750
than going in from the left to the right.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:13.490
Now let's think about
something that absorbs heat

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:15.290
and this one's a little
bit counter intuitive.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:19.020
It absorbs heat but it's
still going to be spontaneous.

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.360
It's still going to be exergonic.

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.920
It's still going to happen.

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.190
So delta H is greater than zero

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:27.160
so it absorbs heat to happen.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.630
So I have these two molecules

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:31.790
with these different constituents,
they are about to collide

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.260
and we're saying that
the temperature is high.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:36.140
If the temperature is low,
this might not be spontaneous

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.320
but if the temperature is
high enough it will be.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.580
So the temperature high
in a microscopic basis,

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:41.790
you're saying, okay these
things just have them,

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.190
really high kinetic energy,

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.090
they're going to ram into
each other really fast

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.990
and they're gonna ram
into each other so fast

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.290
that they can form all
these other constituents.

00:07:50.290 --> 00:07:53.410
So you have the net entropy,

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:56.360
you have the net entropy has increased.

00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.800
Even though over here our electrons

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.250
are in a higher energy state
to form this configuration

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:03.320
so it had to absorb heat,

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.920
so it had to absorb heat energy.

00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.820
So we could say heat but
heat on a microscopic level,

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.720
we're just talking about
kind of kinetic energy

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:13.530
of these molecules.

00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:17.450
So it have to absorb it but
where did that energy come from?

00:08:17.450 --> 00:08:20.190
Well, it came from the kinetic
energy of the molecules.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.650
They might had a certain
kinetic energy before

00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:24.250
but then some of that gets lost

00:08:24.250 --> 00:08:26.150
so when they all get banged up

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:27.950
into their different configurations.

00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:29.490
If you're saying, well
I still don't get this.

00:08:29.490 --> 00:08:31.390
Think about trying to do
this reaction the other way.

00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:33.990
Try to get these four
constituents in the right time,

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.890
all together, even though
if they're happening,

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:38.390
if they're put together at the right way

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:41.320
their electrons could configure
in a way to release energy

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.810
but this is super high temperature.

00:08:42.810 --> 00:08:44.480
This is a really, really chaotic system.

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.980
It's not gonna go from right to left,

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:47.230
it's gonna go from left to right.

00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:48.870
When it's really chaotic,
things are banging

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.860
each other really fast,
you're more likely to go

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.730
on a direction of higher entropy.

00:08:53.730 --> 00:08:55.630
So now let's look at,

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.500
and so this is spontaneous
even though it absorbs heat.

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:02.050
If you're not draining
the heat away locally,

00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.890
your temperature at least
around these molecules

00:09:04.890 --> 00:09:06.150
it will go down.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:08.450
But as source we're assuming
constant temperature

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:10.780
for this so you can assume
that in a macro level

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:12.633
that temperature dissipates
and gets absorbed

00:09:12.633 --> 00:09:14.670
outside of the system somehow.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.620
Now, let's look at this configuration.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.650
It's exothermic so delta
H is less than zero,

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:21.240
less enthalpy after the
reaction than before

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.100
so it's releasing heat
but it's not spontaneous.

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.290
And it's not spontaneous
because it's reducing

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:29.630
the entropy in the world.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.850
It's reducing the entropy in the world

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.480
and the entropy matters because
our temperature is high.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.620
One way to look at this equation
is entropy doesn't matter

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.590
when temperature is low.

00:09:39.590 --> 00:09:41.950
Temperature is really scaling your entropy

00:09:41.950 --> 00:09:45.220
but when temperature is high,
entropy start to take over.

00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:47.500
This variable starts to matter a lot.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.820
So over here, because entropy is negative,

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.750
this isn't gonna, this thing's
not gonna actually happen.

00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:56.090
So if these things were
coming together very slowly,

00:09:56.090 --> 00:09:58.640
their electrons could
configure in just the right way

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.230
so that they can get
to a lower energy state

00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.263
and release energy.

00:10:01.263 --> 00:10:03.700
But they're buzzing
pass each other so fast

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.550
that they're not gonna
have a chance to do that.

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.190
If you think about it the
other way, this reaction

00:10:08.190 --> 00:10:09.540
is much more likely to happen.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.020
If you have a bunch of
this diatomic molecules

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:14.190
running around, they're gonna
bump into each other so fast

00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:17.570
that they're gonna knock
the constituents off of

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:21.080
these diatomic molecules or at
least the way it's depicted,

00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:23.060
it kinda looks like a diatomic molecule.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.350
And they might absorb some
of that kinetic energy

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:27.750
in doing it, in order
to go from right to left

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:29.690
but that's more likely to happen.

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.150
So from left to right not spontaneous

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:35.250
because entropy really matters
at this high temperature.

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:37.440
Then finally, and this
one's pretty intuitive

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.890
something that needs heat,
something that needs heat energy

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.000
and has a reduction in entropy

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.550
that's definitely not
going to be spontaneous.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:50.070
So this is greater than
zero, this is less than zero

00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:51.990
but then you're subtracting
it so this whole thing

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:54.070
is greater than zero, this delta G

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.990
is going to be greater than zero.

00:10:55.990 --> 00:10:58.920
Delta, let me do that in a green color.

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:02.790
This delta G is going
to be greater than zero

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.520
and it makes sense that you
have these two molecules

00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.720
that you have to get together
in just the right way.

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.290
They need heat in order to
proceed with this reaction

00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:14.510
to kind of excite, to excite the electrons

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:15.940
to higher energy state to get into this,

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:17.880
I guess you could say less stable bond.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.390
Why would they do that?

00:11:19.390 --> 00:11:21.620
The reaction is much more
likely to go in this way

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:23.130
or if you had a bunch of these molecules

00:11:23.130 --> 00:11:24.560
they're all knocking into each other,

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.050
they get into a more stable configuration

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.830
and there's more entropy
when they split up

00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.950
than when they actually stay together.

00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:32.510
So delta G greater than zero.

00:11:32.510 --> 00:11:35.430
This is endergonic and endothermic

00:11:35.430 --> 00:11:38.120
and of course, this one was
delta G greater than zero.

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.240
Even though this would release energy

00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:42.550
that the things that's so
chaotic they're not gonna have

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.550
a chance to do that and
you're much more likely to go

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:47.190
in the direction of maximizing entropy

00:11:47.190 --> 00:11:50.550
and so this one also is not spontaneous.
