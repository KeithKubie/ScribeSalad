00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.010
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr?

2
00:00:02.011 --> 00:00:04.380
It's time for the Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.910
December 3rd,
2018 what's going on?
How are you?

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.920
How are you doing?
Oh,

5
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:14.220
I hope you're doing better than I'm doing Jesus Christ.

6
00:00:14.221 --> 00:00:15.480
I'm in New York City right now.

7
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:18.480
I don't think I've ever been lonelier the in my fucking life.

8
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.710
Good Lord.
It's just like,
you know,

9
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.970
I don't know anybody in this city anyway.
I used to fucking know everybody.

10
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:28.560
I don't fucking know anybody

11
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.610
looking for a familiar face.
It's crazy.

12
00:00:32.611 --> 00:00:37.611
I'll tell you this city when you have 50 versus when you're 25 is completely

13
00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:41.070
different.
So if there's anybody in that twenties living in New York,

14
00:00:41.071 --> 00:00:44.900
and I know you got a Shitty fucking living situation like most people,
but uh,

15
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.470
that shit time do,
did she or city,
so fuck it.
Enjoy it.

16
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.140
Jesus Christ.
First of all,
it's December 3rd and I'm like,
oh,

17
00:00:55.141 --> 00:00:58.440
Christmas in New York is exciting.
You know,
I love the holidays and Shit,

18
00:00:58.441 --> 00:01:00.480
you know,
and I'd come here and it's fucking,

19
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.260
it's colder in La than it is in New York.
I don't,
you know,

20
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.420
this whole new fucking a post mi two era,
whether,
yeah,
I'm bleeding,

21
00:01:09.421 --> 00:01:11.790
blamed the me too movement on a global warming,

22
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.660
that's my next fucking brilliant move in my career.
Um,

23
00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.880
so I went down and I did a set tonight at the cellar.
I did seek Gary Gulman.

24
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.710
I was like,
oh my God,
somebody I know.
And uh,
I went up,

25
00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:28.080
I had a good time.
And then I,
uh,

26
00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.580
I left and I'm walking in the rain by myself,

27
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.080
thinking of like when I used to walk up that the sixth avenue,

28
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:39.990
I used to walk up with fucking,
you know,

29
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.300
fucking Bobby Kelly and all of those guys way back in the day and I'm just

30
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:49.620
fucking like,
Jesus Christ.
Where the fuck did the time go?
And then I was like,

31
00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:54.460
oh my God,
now I'm getting depressed.
I can't do this.
What do I,
so I,

32
00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.630
you know,
I called my wife,
you know,
I facetime with my kid and that was all good.

33
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.140
And then I got in a cab and I'm just like,
I'm not,
I'm not going to fucking,

34
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.530
I'm not gonna.
Uh,
you know,
what is whatever,
you know,

35
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:11.690
you have like a fucking sad thought and then you fucking just cling to it.

36
00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.340
It's like,
I'm not fucking doing that.
I'm going to get myself in a better guide,

37
00:02:14.341 --> 00:02:18.010
their mood.
So I came home,
I watched a little bit of football,
you know,

38
00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:21.600
I watched the end of the fucking steal is and that she had is they get the

39
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.040
charges.
The steel is the shacks and more anybody in Boston remember that?

40
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.610
Mvp sports when they had the fucking employee do the commercial,

41
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.990
come on down to MVP sports.
We got all the jerseys,
we got these shacks.

42
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.530
The steel is the challenges and more,
um,

43
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.180
I watched that game and right as I go to show it up,
shut it off,
et cetera.

44
00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.223
Fucking

45
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.030
fucking infuriating slash depressing fucking commercial where it's the dad with

46
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:54.810
his daughter,
you know,

47
00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.420
and she's getting older and he has his favorite fucking song,

48
00:02:57.421 --> 00:02:59.420
which is the most depressing thing ever.

49
00:02:59.421 --> 00:03:04.421
It's song of regret or wish that I knew what I knew then when I was younger,

50
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.220
when I want to now what I know now,
whatever the fuck,

51
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.710
I'm like fucking mentally dyslexics.
I don't know.

52
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:13.690
I don't how that exact thing fucking goes.

53
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.840
And then at the end she fucking goes away.
Right.

54
00:03:16.841 --> 00:03:19.270
So that's the whole song of fucking regret.
You know what I mean?

55
00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:22.060
Like I'm looking back,
Jesus Christ,
I wish it fucking,
you know,

56
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.630
I don't need to hear that.
That's the soundtrack of my whole fucking walk home.

57
00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.220
You know?
And I'm sitting there and that stupid commercial comes on and is,

58
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:34.330
if that commercials into depressing up,
especially on a Sunday night,

59
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.920
they should not be allowed to play that song on a fucking Sunday night at which

60
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:39.760
someone sit there,

61
00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.060
they're fucking loneliness about ready to start another workweek,

62
00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.010
a which there and who won a new dam.

63
00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:49.323
Now what?

64
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.140
I wish I knew what I wish that I knew what I know now.

65
00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.930
That's it.
When I was younger,

66
00:03:55.931 --> 00:04:00.400
whatever the fucking song is that the end of the goddamn commercial is the

67
00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:04.820
daughters all grown up.
Now the guy takes you to college,

68
00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.950
she's fucking heartbroken.

69
00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:10.060
And then she goes into her dorm room and he's got one of those fucking things.

70
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:15.040
You know,
you,
you,
you know it.
Hey Conti,
play that song.
Me and my dad like it.

71
00:04:15.041 --> 00:04:19.680
It's sitting over in the corner just listening to her.
I don't like that.

72
00:04:19.681 --> 00:04:21.090
I don't like how they fucking sit there.

73
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.910
They're trying to make all of this shit bug in your own house,

74
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.400
hanging out with a robot and taking a picture with it.

75
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.340
No sprint commercials making us all seem like,
yeah,
hey,

76
00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:32.010
this is all like a great fun fucking time.

77
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.843
<v 1>MMM.</v>

78
00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:37.850
<v 0>Or maybe I'm just lonely and I'm looking at through it.</v>

79
00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.440
Like you don't do it as I'm not fucking drinking either.
And I swear to God,

80
00:04:42.441 --> 00:04:44.120
if I was drinking right now,
I would,

81
00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:48.950
I would go to a bar by myself and uh,
that's,
and that's how you do it.

82
00:04:48.951 --> 00:04:50.120
That's how you,
that's how,

83
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.450
that's the most healthiest way I ever figured out how to combat loneliness on

84
00:04:53.451 --> 00:04:56.630
the road is to go out,
drink alone,
get shit faced,

85
00:04:56.631 --> 00:04:58.220
and then come home and pass out.

86
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.460
And then you don't come home sober to an empty room.

87
00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.870
But I feel like when I'm podcasting,
I have all of you here with

88
00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:10.260
<v 1>me.</v>

89
00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.800
<v 0>I feel like through me,</v>

90
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:16.750
podcasting is like giving a part of the world the hug.

91
00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.710
What'd you guys do?
A fife really legit.

92
00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.120
Like I fell off a bike or something and that was the result of my head injury.

93
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.660
And I started talking like that and I started wearing,
you know those fucking,

94
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:32.290
you know this a fragile chicks who were those sweaters that go over their hands

95
00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.340
and they're always picking up like a cup of coffee cause they're always cold and

96
00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:39.210
they have to hold it with both hands because they're fucking so weak.

97
00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:43.840
If I became that person,
um,
well bill is simple,

98
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.500
we would listen for a few weeks and then we'd be like,
all right,
this sucks now.

99
00:05:47.501 --> 00:05:49.150
And then we wouldn't,
we wouldn't listen.
Hey,

100
00:05:49.151 --> 00:05:53.180
what happened over in England with the London Derby,

101
00:05:53.181 --> 00:05:57.020
which I thought was like a fucking horse race.
This team that I,

102
00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:01.280
I'd never even heard of,
I guess was up two to one against arsenal,
arsenal,

103
00:06:01.281 --> 00:06:05.000
arsenal one nil arsenal right there.
They're fucking up on them.

104
00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:08.000
And then they somehow or another,
they were up two to one.
Somali lost 42,

105
00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:12.320
everybody was losing their fucking minds.
Pictures look incredible.

106
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:16.250
I wish I watched the game.
Um,
having said that,

107
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:19.280
knowing nothing about the premier league,
you know,

108
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.250
if he just look at both their uniforms,
you know who you're putting the money on,

109
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.180
you don't,
one of them looks like a professional uniform.
The other,

110
00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.650
the people that lost that looked like a kid drew it.
Yeah.
Um,

111
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:35.410
anyways,
so I just sat around all day,
uh,

112
00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:42.150
fucking,
I dunno what,
watching football and shit.
I watched the,
a giants,

113
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:45.250
very entertaining game against some other team that I can't remember because I'm

114
00:06:45.251 --> 00:06:47.440
fucking old.
The hell are they playing?

115
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.770
This is fucking unbelievable.
I watched the whole game.
I don't,
well,

116
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:56.870
I was also cleaning the fucking kitchen.
Yeah,
I know,
Susan.

117
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:00.080
It was an exciting game.
Whether they fucking plate,
I will say this,
that,

118
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:01.420
that Saquon Barkley,
that's good.

119
00:07:01.421 --> 00:07:04.000
That they're telling him not to run so wide open cause he's kind of doing a

120
00:07:04.001 --> 00:07:07.270
little Earl Campbell shit where it's like you don't need to take that much

121
00:07:07.271 --> 00:07:10.780
punishment on every play,
especially when you're on a bad team.

122
00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.760
Um,
that would be a shame if they finally,
you know,
became good.

123
00:07:15.761 --> 00:07:20.170
And then that guy was all banged up fucking leaping over guys and shit.

124
00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:24.610
Um,
it's amazing to watch,
you know.
Um,

125
00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:29.500
then I watched the Patriots first the Vikings,
I was watching a,

126
00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:36.510
who the fuck is that guy?
A number 19 on the vikings,

127
00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:41.790
a phenomenal player.
I wish he played in our team.
But on that fourth and short,

128
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:45.300
when Bella check through the challenge lag or whatever,

129
00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:49.320
and he's talking to the refs and somehow that wide receiver got involved.

130
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.390
You know what I mean?
To the point you literally see fucking bill Belicheck.

131
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.060
He's that guy.
I got to commend number 19 on the Viking Sea,

132
00:07:57.061 --> 00:08:01.630
actually got an emotional response out of Bella check checks going.
She goes,

133
00:08:01.631 --> 00:08:05.290
shut the fuck up.
Shut the fuck up.
Set it twice.

134
00:08:09.610 --> 00:08:13.300
And you know what?
I don't know what was said in defense at number 19,

135
00:08:13.301 --> 00:08:17.350
but you know,
just sitting at home.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Shut the fuck up.

136
00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:20.680
You weren't even in the plate.
I can see if the running back said something.

137
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.750
You didn't touch the ball.

138
00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.550
You're barely blocked on the play with the fuck are you jumping in for?
Um,

139
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.050
anyways,
but,
uh,
the chiefs want again,
so as much as the Patriots,

140
00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:34.270
so winning the Patriots,
what they're doing this year is,

141
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.170
is amazing cause we lost two of our top receivers.

142
00:08:38.171 --> 00:08:39.520
We lost our left tackle.

143
00:08:39.521 --> 00:08:42.440
We lost a running back and we lost one of our top cornerbacks.

144
00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:44.770
So this is like a fucking,
you know,

145
00:08:44.771 --> 00:08:49.380
I feel like the last rebuild in the Brady Belicheck era,

146
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:51.970
hopefully we'll get under the wire again.
But,
um,

147
00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:57.660
I do not feel good about playing the chiefs in Kansas City come playoff time.

148
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:03.090
But uh,
they are the fucking chiefs so until they get over the fucking hump.

149
00:09:03.091 --> 00:09:07.290
But um,
I dunno,
we shall see.
We should definitely see.

150
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:09.930
And I just watched the end of the charges,
Steelers game,
the chargers,

151
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.700
the quietest nine and three in the NFL.
Nobody's talking about him,

152
00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.020
you know what I mean?
Cause cause there's fucking the rams at doing so well,

153
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:24.210
right.
They like Eddie van Halen,
the rants and Alex Van Halen.

154
00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:28.110
Meanwhile I was killing it right behind him and nobody seems to be noticing

155
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.440
except the charge offense.
Right.

156
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.810
Without expanding on it was only seem like other drummers,

157
00:09:33.811 --> 00:09:38.010
like is it me as this guy fucking unbelievable and in his own right.
Uh,
kind of,

158
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.780
uh,
on Eddie's level.
Anybody else?
You maybe know,

159
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:46.040
you say a couple of fucking games behind.
I actually,
you know something,

160
00:09:46.041 --> 00:09:48.320
I was getting ready to do the podcast and I saw,
um,

161
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.110
I went to nfl.com so I could see a couple of stats.

162
00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.590
I wouldn't sound even dumber than usual.

163
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.310
And I saw there was five minutes left and the Steelers were down by seven.

164
00:09:58.311 --> 00:10:00.410
I was just like,
all right,
well they got big Ben.

165
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.590
They're definitely coming back and you're not allowed to play defense in the
NFL.

166
00:10:03.591 --> 00:10:06.750
So why don't I watch this video game here?
Scores to steal is go right,

167
00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:10.430
fuck it down and bing,
Bang,
boom,
they fucking score.
And you know,

168
00:10:10.431 --> 00:10:12.500
you're not allowed to pay defense in his,
uh,
you know,

169
00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:16.160
there's a good minute 50 left and then the fucking charges all right down the

170
00:10:16.161 --> 00:10:16.994
fucking field.

171
00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:18.940
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

172
00:10:18.940 --> 00:10:20.550
<v 0>You know,
but it's not,
are they going to score?
It's,</v>

173
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:23.730
are they going to get a touchdown or a field goal?
Um,

174
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:26.400
I've never seen a game and as far as like,
uh,

175
00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.020
offsides three times on the defense,
I love that guy.
Number 25.
He's like,

176
00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.320
fuck you,
I don't give a shit.
Keep calling a penalty.

177
00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:39.950
I thought it was kind of brilliant that he just kept doing that cause he knew he

178
00:10:39.961 --> 00:10:44.010
had to make a play.
And then one of the lads,
what is on that last one?

179
00:10:44.011 --> 00:10:46.140
He jumped past the ball.
What if he actually blocked it?

180
00:10:46.141 --> 00:10:49.950
They called them off sides again and then the next time he didn't jump off sides

181
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.200
and then the dude fucking misses it.
Then it makes sense.

182
00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:57.450
I know he didn't explain that correctly,
but I think,
I think it makes sense.

183
00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.220
Whatever.
I'm just a fucking lonely guy,

184
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:02.700
but a tomorrow night that'll be at Gotham and um,

185
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:06.870
got a bunch of my buddies down there,
so we'll be hanging out.
But uh,

186
00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.350
Jesus Christ,
Jesus alone,

187
00:11:10.410 --> 00:11:13.800
stone sober in New York City is,
is not,
you know,

188
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.370
that's not what frank was singing about when he's saying about New York.

189
00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:17.910
You know,

190
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:22.680
my kind of town New York City is,

191
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.260
um,
anyways,
uh,
rest in peace.

192
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.490
41st president of the United States,
George Herbert Walker Bush.
You know,

193
00:11:32.491 --> 00:11:36.510
I was amazed at the amount of people that like fucking,
I wasn't amazed,

194
00:11:36.511 --> 00:11:40.920
but I wanted to see it.
People believed guy,
he's a war criminal,
right?

195
00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:45.270
Somebody said that,
right?
And then somebody else goes show a little respect.

196
00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.040
The guys of veteran,

197
00:11:47.041 --> 00:11:49.860
he was on the ground fighting with the troops are set to like that.

198
00:11:49.861 --> 00:11:53.440
It's like you guys are both fucking morons.
He was a pilot.

199
00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.450
He wasn't on the ground.
I used something for you right now.
Okay.
For all the,

200
00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:00.430
you know,
and first of all in,
in a,

201
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:04.420
I don't even know what they're referring to because he was a pilot in world war

202
00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:09.220
two.
So war praise they talking about and Iraq and Kuwait.
I mean,

203
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.720
I don't know what's going on there.

204
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:15.010
I know Saddam was our draft pick and then he went fucking crazy,

205
00:12:15.011 --> 00:12:17.290
like a goddamn NFL wide receiver.

206
00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:23.320
So we had to cut him right
in a military way,

207
00:12:23.321 --> 00:12:26.290
I guess.
I don't know.
I don't,
I don't understand how all of that shit works,

208
00:12:26.291 --> 00:12:28.840
but I'll tell you something right now.
Read this book called Flags,

209
00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:34.780
flags of our fathers,
Jesus Christ.
If did you,
you know,

210
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:39.760
especially if you have a pilot's license.
Um,

211
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:46.570
I just remember how fucking scared I was the first time I had to solo.
Um,

212
00:12:49.420 --> 00:12:51.400
well it was really the second one I had to do.

213
00:12:51.401 --> 00:12:56.401
The first one was like round trip was like an hour and it was straight up and

214
00:12:56.411 --> 00:12:57.280
straight back.

215
00:12:57.790 --> 00:13:00.940
I just followed this highway right up and I literally just did with my

216
00:13:00.941 --> 00:13:03.250
instructor and came back.
I think it might even been a half an hour.

217
00:13:03.580 --> 00:13:07.420
The second time you had to put three hours on the Hobbs meter,

218
00:13:07.421 --> 00:13:10.360
which is basically the odometer of the fucking helicopter.

219
00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.820
And um,

220
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.790
that is honestly the most scared I've ever been in my fucking life.

221
00:13:18.750 --> 00:13:22.920
And I was flying a helicopter on a sunny day.

222
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.910
And just to give you an abridged version,

223
00:13:27.690 --> 00:13:29.580
I hope I pick the right book at the same time.

224
00:13:29.581 --> 00:13:33.090
I read this book also about Iijima but I think,
I think yeah,

225
00:13:33.091 --> 00:13:35.850
flags of our fathers was,
was the book.

226
00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:40.410
And um,
they were basically,

227
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:41.700
they had this mission,

228
00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:45.900
George at dinner or you interviewed George Herbert Walker Bush and he was

229
00:13:45.901 --> 00:13:50.901
talking about how he was like a 19 year old kid and how like you're young.

230
00:13:54.461 --> 00:13:56.380
So you just had that thing that you just think you're going to,

231
00:13:56.410 --> 00:13:57.490
you're not going to die.

232
00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:01.090
And he said you just would always think of the other guy's going to get it.

233
00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:03.970
It's not going to be me.
And just the fact that you,
you know,

234
00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:05.630
any flew all these missions in it,

235
00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.320
these guys he'd be talking to you come back and they just,

236
00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:13.120
they didn't make it and you had the fucking block that out.
You know,

237
00:14:13.121 --> 00:14:15.750
they sit there talking about ice in a field goal kicker.
I think about this shit.

238
00:14:15.810 --> 00:14:19.660
The fucking 19 years old,
he's going through this shit,
right?
So anyways,

239
00:14:19.661 --> 00:14:23.080
they have this mission,
they've got to take out some sort of of radio,

240
00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:24.821
you know,

241
00:14:24.821 --> 00:14:28.870
control center of the Japanese on this island and the island shaped like an old

242
00:14:28.871 --> 00:14:32.230
school.
Uh,
football stayed in like a horseshoe,

243
00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:36.700
like where Ohio state plays before they closed it off.
And the crazy thing,

244
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.030
which didn't make sense to me,
maybe it was,
that makes sense.
If it was radio,

245
00:14:40.031 --> 00:14:43.900
that would be down lower,
but whatever the fuck the target they had to hit

246
00:14:45.520 --> 00:14:49.960
was down low.
Right?
Like,
if you pitch basically picture,

247
00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.540
if you're flying into the horseshoe,
right,

248
00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.500
see flying into the open end of the stadiums and you want to go bomb the people

249
00:14:57.501 --> 00:15:02.450
right behind the fucking opposing a touchdown and zone,

250
00:15:02.451 --> 00:15:07.310
I should say.
And what was crazy was the Japanese anti aircraft,

251
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:13.150
um,
um,
guns were actually,

252
00:15:13.180 --> 00:15:17.500
you know,
the way the island was set up,
they were higher up than the altitude.

253
00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:20.860
These guys had to fly in it.
So they were actually shooting down at them.

254
00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:24.670
And anybody who's ever got into a fight at a football or baseball stadium,

255
00:15:24.671 --> 00:15:28.030
you know,
if you're fighting a guy,
a row behind you,
how much did,

256
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.600
how much more of an advantage that person has punching down.

257
00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.030
Now imagine this person shooting a fucking

258
00:15:35.550 --> 00:15:37.450
Goddamn gun in a fucking airplane.
You know what I mean?

259
00:15:37.510 --> 00:15:41.590
So they basically were flying in there.

260
00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:45.130
Oh,
I skipped one part of it.

261
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:48.740
<v 1>Uh Huh.</v>

262
00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:54.280
<v 0>Former President Bush was talking about how you would come back from a mission,</v>

263
00:15:56.060 --> 00:15:56.893
you know,

264
00:15:57.470 --> 00:16:02.470
and he said you were so fucking in shock that you got of the plane.

265
00:16:03.021 --> 00:16:07.040
Like you couldn't even talk and you remembered one time getting out of his plane

266
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:10.670
after being shot at and shit and seen as other people getting shot out of the

267
00:16:10.671 --> 00:16:14.720
sky and making it back.
He got out and one of the higher ups on the,

268
00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:18.290
you know,
admiral,
whatever came up to him,
he said,
how you doing son?

269
00:16:18.291 --> 00:16:21.130
And he said he opened his mouth and no sound came out.

270
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.143
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

271
00:16:22.830 --> 00:16:26.580
<v 0>And he said,
and then the guy goes,
oh,
I just go down to sick bay son,</v>

272
00:16:26.581 --> 00:16:27.250
you'll be finding,

273
00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:31.320
said you'd go down to sick bay and they give you like two or three centuries of

274
00:16:31.321 --> 00:16:35.730
fucking whiskey and you do just do a shot.
And he said,

275
00:16:35.731 --> 00:16:38.550
the funny thing was that it worked.
You know,

276
00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:42.870
that's just like a fucking old school shit.
Uh Oh,

277
00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:45.630
you're just in a plane that people were shooting at and you're scared shitless.

278
00:16:45.631 --> 00:16:47.460
I,
yeah,
go downstairs and go take a belt,

279
00:16:47.461 --> 00:16:51.030
a whiskey and then tomorrow you can go do it again.
You know?

280
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:56.390
I mean,
I don't know how the fuck they slept,
you know,

281
00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:59.870
all I can compare it to was just flying on a sunny day by myself.

282
00:16:59.871 --> 00:17:02.440
And I just remember afterwards when I landed

283
00:17:04.050 --> 00:17:06.310
and uh,
not even after I rolled down,

284
00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:10.140
cause you rolled down from 100% down to like 75% just to,
you know,

285
00:17:10.141 --> 00:17:12.540
you don't want to shut it off immediately because it fucks up the engine.

286
00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:15.360
I just remember the greatest sound I've ever heard in my life was when I pulled

287
00:17:15.361 --> 00:17:19.050
the mish mixture in the engine shut off and I was just following,
you know,

288
00:17:19.051 --> 00:17:22.050
the brake to slow down the main rotor.
And I just remember thinking like,

289
00:17:22.051 --> 00:17:25.580
thank God I didn't kill myself.
Right.
Yeah.
And that was just flying

290
00:17:27.290 --> 00:17:30.680
in Sunny California.
And so anyways,

291
00:17:30.681 --> 00:17:35.360
so he goes into F on this mission and they're taking ridiculous,

292
00:17:36.170 --> 00:17:40.850
um,
anti aircraft fire because it was a really important strategic location.

293
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:44.840
And he ends up getting hit and he was flying with two other people and he was

294
00:17:44.841 --> 00:17:46.070
losing control of it.

295
00:17:47.030 --> 00:17:51.240
And he tells the guys in the back to bail out.
So when they bail out,

296
00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:55.680
he has to hang on and stay in the fucking thing.
So they have a chance.

297
00:17:56.970 --> 00:18:01.970
So they fucking bail out and he's heading down towards the water and somehow he

298
00:18:02.101 --> 00:18:05.640
regains control of it.
Now the little I know about Ab,
I don't know how we did it.

299
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:06.810
I don't know if them,

300
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:12.180
the weight of them jumping out and we'd probably easily a couple of hundred

301
00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:15.160
pounds,
300 pounds,
just left the back.
I don't know if that got it,

302
00:18:15.180 --> 00:18:20.180
gave him enough and he was able to get over the island to the other side and

303
00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:24.120
then crash in the water over there.
And,
um,

304
00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.770
all the pilots were warned that the Japanese hated,

305
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.090
um,
pilots.
They thought that they were cowards and me,
you've got to think,

306
00:18:33.091 --> 00:18:36.660
you know,
aviation where it was,
this was like a new thing.
I mean,

307
00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:38.850
I'm a World War II.
They had like the biplanes and shit,

308
00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:42.840
but this new shit coming in and with the machine guns and bomb and people in all

309
00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:46.950
that,
they were considered fucking cowards.
So,
uh,
I'm,

310
00:18:46.951 --> 00:18:49.920
I begin to read the book.
The shit that they do,
the pilots is fucking nuts.

311
00:18:49.921 --> 00:18:52.500
Long story short,
he crashed,
lands over there.

312
00:18:52.650 --> 00:18:57.210
He sees the Japanese boat coming out to pick him up.
He's in the water.

313
00:18:57.211 --> 00:19:01.770
He's 19.
He's fucking crying.
He's taken in,
you know,
sea water and shit.

314
00:19:01.771 --> 00:19:04.260
And he said,
like a fucking movie.
As this thing's coming out,

315
00:19:04.261 --> 00:19:06.790
like a periscope comes up and,
uh,
uh,

316
00:19:06.791 --> 00:19:11.791
American sub surfaces takes out the Japanese boat and brings him onto the

317
00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:13.500
fucking boat.
And he survived.

318
00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:18.540
His two buddies got caught and endured like ridiculous torture before they were

319
00:19:18.541 --> 00:19:20.910
killed.
And,
and,
um,

320
00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:25.490
Bush ends the story saying there's,
there's not a day goes by.

321
00:19:25.491 --> 00:19:27.440
I don't think about those guys.
Like,

322
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:31.250
like what I could have possibly done a fucking,
something like that.
Right?

323
00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:38.390
So now had I not read that fucking book,

324
00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.960
I would have been another idiot weighing in

325
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:45.320
on this fucking guy.

326
00:19:45.321 --> 00:19:48.140
So I don't know what they're talking about when they say that shit.

327
00:19:48.141 --> 00:19:52.400
All I know is that's one of the craziest fucking stories.

328
00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.480
You know,
you guys heard me read advertising.
I'm not a big fucking reader,

329
00:19:56.481 --> 00:20:00.830
but I was reading that book,
I was like,
Jesus fucking Christ.

330
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:05.020
Um,
I gotta be honest.
They had,

331
00:20:05.021 --> 00:20:08.950
I read that book before I got my pilot's license.

332
00:20:08.951 --> 00:20:12.100
I don't know if I would have done it because I'd be thinking,

333
00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.580
cause I'm one of those guys,
I saw jaws not right when it came back.

334
00:20:18.581 --> 00:20:19.660
They brought it back.

335
00:20:19.661 --> 00:20:22.630
I remember they brought it back because judge two was coming out and I think,

336
00:20:22.631 --> 00:20:27.631
I want to say they brought it back and I saw it and I have never been able to,

337
00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:31.750
to be comfortable with the ocean after that.
So I'm one of those bucket people,

338
00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.480
you know,
like I'll freak myself up.
My,

339
00:20:34.481 --> 00:20:38.200
my mind fucks with me in a pool and I love swimming.
But there is time,

340
00:20:38.201 --> 00:20:42.100
especially out in la where they got all these fucking critters and reptiles and

341
00:20:42.101 --> 00:20:44.890
shit that I'm not fucking used to.
And I always think like,

342
00:20:44.891 --> 00:20:47.530
what if some fucking rattlesnake just came,
you know,

343
00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:51.480
and it's freaking out because it,
you know,
it's trying to get from once,
you know,

344
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.190
it fell in and it's trying to get together since it's already,
you know,

345
00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:57.830
dangerous as fuck.
It's not going to be in a good mood.
Yeah.
You know,

346
00:20:58.970 --> 00:21:01.870
it sees me come,
you know,
fucking swimming leg,

347
00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.920
an old man coming at it and he doesn't want to die.

348
00:21:03.921 --> 00:21:08.180
Like it's going to bite me right in the top of my fucking Charlie Brown head.
Um,

349
00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:12.190
anyways,
so I did you know something,

350
00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:15.370
one thing I did get out of all of that because I don't follow politics and shit.

351
00:21:15.370 --> 00:21:17.200
The one thing that they were complimenting him on,

352
00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:21.010
the fact that when they brought down the Berlin Wall that he was smart enough

353
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:25.090
not to rub it in people's,
uh,
uh,
the Russians faces or whatever.

354
00:21:25.091 --> 00:21:28.120
You know what I mean?
Cause we easily could have lost the whole thing.
Who knows?

355
00:21:28.121 --> 00:21:31.960
You know,
those are the two big boys going at it.
Two heavyweights.
Um,

356
00:21:32.170 --> 00:21:36.720
especially now with the Internet and it's all like,
hey,
fuck it.
Well,

357
00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:41.290
maybe next time I literally watched,
I,
I fucking pulled up a video,
right?

358
00:21:41.291 --> 00:21:45.700
I was trying to poach salmon tonight.
Right?
I don't mean steal it.
Um,

359
00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:48.440
<v 1>and uh,</v>

360
00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:53.690
<v 0>how to poach salmon and the name of the video is you're doing it all wrong.</v>

361
00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:58.880
And it's just like,
why?
It's like,
why the fuck would you come at it that way?

362
00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:05.120
You know,
just be like,
hey,
this is how I make salmon.
Some people do it this way.

363
00:22:05.121 --> 00:22:08.700
I feel like if you do it this way,
that you know,
this happens.
Okay.

364
00:22:09.230 --> 00:22:13.470
It's just like everything has to be like,
hey,
maybe next time,
don't put the put,

365
00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:16.070
put the fucking deal on until you fucking whatever.

366
00:22:16.071 --> 00:22:20.420
It's like Jesus is even hostility and fucking cooking videos.
Like,

367
00:22:20.421 --> 00:22:23.090
I remember this freckled can show me how to make a pie crust.

368
00:22:23.091 --> 00:22:27.670
One time I just realized what a hypocrite I was being.
Um,
anyways,

369
00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.470
uh,
guess what,
guess who wears a new podcast?
Everybody.
The great Conan O'brien.

370
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:35.543
<v 1>MMM.</v>

371
00:22:35.860 --> 00:22:39.850
<v 0>He has a new podcast and he was nice enough to ask me to be a guest on it and</v>

372
00:22:39.851 --> 00:22:43.510
you can listen to it today.
I'm going to be on it.
And you're probably like,
well,

373
00:22:43.511 --> 00:22:46.160
Jesus Christ,
Bill,
where the hell is it?
Um,

374
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:51.610
I don't have the information in front of me.
Wait a minute.
Four.
Hang on.

375
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.760
It's now you have to go find it.
Hold on a second.
God dammit.
Bill,

376
00:22:55.510 --> 00:23:00.490
how many fucking times Conan O'brien,
I mean,
you could do this too,
right?
Oh,

377
00:23:01.210 --> 00:23:02.043
Brian

378
00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:04.250
<v 1>podcast,</v>

379
00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:07.570
<v 0>um,</v>

380
00:23:07.570 --> 00:23:12.570
Kona needs a friend podcast on earwolf.com Jesus Christ.

381
00:23:13.181 --> 00:23:17.900
I'm promoting a different podcast network.
Um,
anyways,
I'll be on that.

382
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:24.350
I had a great time on his podcast and uh,
obviously,
you know,

383
00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.750
he's,
he's one of the,
one of my most favorite people in this business.

384
00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:32.050
MMM.

385
00:23:32.050 --> 00:23:35.530
I've always said one of my favorite things ever is somebody who's super smart

386
00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:39.010
and this is silly and that's why I've always loved him and Andy,

387
00:23:39.220 --> 00:23:42.940
cause they're both obviously really smart people and they're silly as hell.

388
00:23:42.970 --> 00:23:46.700
And I had a great time on his podcast.
Please listen to it.

389
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.420
It's actually really cool because I learned more about Conan than I ever knew.

390
00:23:50.421 --> 00:23:54.980
Just shooting the shit with them in that hour.
So if you're into Conan O'brien,

391
00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.980
like you should be,
check it out.
There we go.
Um,

392
00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:03.640
<v 3>also it's the first of the month,
the beginning of the month.
So,
uh,</v>

393
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.330
my patrion page,
patrion.com/bar,
uh,

394
00:24:07.331 --> 00:24:11.590
we got a bunch of a new buying the scenes stuff that we put up there.

395
00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:16.300
We got a bill birth three arenas and his backstage from all the arena shows I

396
00:24:16.301 --> 00:24:19.000
did in 2018,
um,

397
00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:23.530
me getting ready to go on stage,
me coming off stage,
uh,

398
00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:27.820
me jamming with Conan O'brien at the forum,
Dean Del Rey,

399
00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.590
uh,
Michael,
Devin and a bunch of other people.
Um,

400
00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:35.020
it's what I do before I do those shows.
Always get together with some friends,

401
00:24:35.021 --> 00:24:38.020
play some music in the empty arena so I'm not too freaked out when I go out

402
00:24:38.021 --> 00:24:41.860
there later.
Two new episodes of uninformed with the teen idols.

403
00:24:41.861 --> 00:24:46.600
Sensation from the and Anthony Program is to Joe to Rosa.
Um,

404
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:49.270
and we also have,
um,

405
00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:55.470
<v 0>um,
I did a live podcast at stand up live in Phoenix,
Arizona.</v>

406
00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.890
We have the whole show up there.
So,
uh,
there you go.

407
00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:03.000
You get all of that for five bucks and I swear to God at some point I'm just

408
00:25:03.001 --> 00:25:06.660
going to start also making random videos for that.
I've just been,
um,

409
00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:11.070
I just been really busy.
But anyways,
check it out if you would like.
All right.
Uh,

410
00:25:11.071 --> 00:25:13.530
okay,
now I want to,
I done yet 25 minutes.

411
00:25:13.770 --> 00:25:17.730
I think it's time to read a little bit of advertising year.
Um,

412
00:25:18.270 --> 00:25:22.890
did I even upload the advertising onto here?
I probably didn't.
Oh,
Bill.

413
00:25:24.180 --> 00:25:25.140
I mean how,
how,
how long,

414
00:25:25.141 --> 00:25:28.290
how long do you have to do a podcast before you're a little bit more of a pro

415
00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:32.910
and you just a little bit more prepared.
Alright,
here we go.

416
00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:34.733
Oh my God.

417
00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:39.860
Cody needs a friend that just made me depressed and then I wish that a new word.

418
00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:45.130
And then when we younger,
that's,
that's depressing me.
And by my,

419
00:25:45.150 --> 00:25:49.050
I got to get out of this,
you know,
oh my God,

420

490
00:30:21.371 --> 00:30:25.510

I did,
but I commuted.

500
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:01.420
You know what I mean?
That's like you took a tour of college,

501
00:31:01.421 --> 00:31:05.200
and then you went home every day.
You sure you want to go there?

cozy onesies.
You know,

00:31:11.441 --> 00:31:14.950
I thought onesies for adults where we're really fucking weird.

505
00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.100
But I'm starting to warm up to the idea of,

506

So please buy some of those ugly sweaters.
Okay.
For Fuck Sakes.
Whatever.

579
00:35:45.181 --> 00:35:47.880
I'm lonely.
You know,
what do you,
what are you going to do sometimes?

580
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:53.070
You know,
the copy comes out a different way.
I'll tell you right now,
I couldn't,

581
00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.320
I can't believe the amount of fucking people you know,

582
00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.680
that walk around in New York with their nose in their phone,

583
00:35:58.681 --> 00:36:02.880
especially when you're waiting for a subway.
Jesus Christ's like back in the day,

584
00:36:02.881 --> 00:36:07.320
you know,
it's being pushed.
People push people in front of those fucking trains.

585
00:36:07.321 --> 00:36:10.500
New Yorkers.
Can you please get,
get,
you know,
you got,

586
00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:14.400
what do they have that as situational awareness?
Good Lord.

587
00:36:14.401 --> 00:36:18.360
They just fucking trains coming in and they're leaning against the post just

588
00:36:18.361 --> 00:36:23.280
staring at their fucking phone.
Um,
anyways,

589
00:36:24.450 --> 00:36:28.050
uh,
LH chargers quite as 93.
I already talked about that.

590
00:36:29.250 --> 00:36:33.240
What else?
Seth Meyers,
I'm doing that on Tuesday.
I'm doing the gym and Sam Show,

591
00:36:34.110 --> 00:36:38.670
um,
today,
Monday when you're hearing this and uh,

592
00:36:39.580 --> 00:36:42.990
yeah,
going to buy a shirt for that too.
It was just the weirdest thing.

593
00:36:42.991 --> 00:36:47.070
You can wear the same fucking pants every,
every time you ever do fucking,

594
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:50.220
um,
a talk show,

595
00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:55.350
but you have to always have to have a new shirt,
you know?

596
00:36:56.040 --> 00:36:58.090
That's why George,
another way,

597
00:36:58.091 --> 00:37:02.070
George Carlin was a fucking genius cause he always wore the black and black,

598
00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:06.180
you know,
the black sweater with the black.
But that was just his fucking look,

599
00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.820
this is what I'm wearing.
You don't have to think,
you know,

600
00:37:08.821 --> 00:37:11.460
going Einstein with it.
So then he just shows up and it's just like,
oh,

601
00:37:11.461 --> 00:37:13.320
it's people just getting the benefit of the doubt.

602
00:37:14.270 --> 00:37:18.500
It's probably a new books where you was fucked up.
Like my,

603
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:23.070
the time on my laptop is a la times.
I'm thinking,

604
00:37:23.071 --> 00:37:24.960
why am I this tired at nine 16?

605
00:37:25.290 --> 00:37:29.760
And then I just looked at the fucking TV and it's 12,
17.
Oh Jesus,

606
00:37:30.770 --> 00:37:34.230
I gotta be up early tomorrow.
Um,
all right,

607
00:37:34.231 --> 00:37:37.590
let's read some of these questions here for this week.
Uh,

608
00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.260
fantastic cars and uh,

609
00:37:40.290 --> 00:37:43.620
oh second shows will be added this week to the European tour.

610
00:37:43.890 --> 00:37:48.240
I'm not sure what day yet.
Just check on Twitter and bill bird.com for dates.

611
00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.350
Uh,
I can't believe you know,
all these places I'd never been to before.

612
00:37:52.351 --> 00:37:54.030
All these people showing up.
Um,

613
00:37:54.660 --> 00:37:58.440
it's one of the reasons why I'm not drinking right now is because I want to be

614
00:37:58.441 --> 00:38:02.250
in great shape when I get over there and give you guys your money worth.

615
00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:02.700
All right.

616
00:38:02.700 --> 00:38:07.620
I'm not flying halfway across the fucking globe to have a mediocre set,

617
00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:11.640
um,
halfway across the country.
Yeah,
I'll drink,
you know,
I'll be,

618
00:38:12.180 --> 00:38:14.880
I'll be a little under the weather.
All right.
But,
you know,

619
00:38:14.881 --> 00:38:18.930
I feel like when I go overseas,

620
00:38:18.990 --> 00:38:23.450
I am an ambassador for Shit and Dick Jokes from my country,
uh,

621
00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:28.260
fantastic cars in f is for family.
Um,
oh,
by the way,
getting back to that,

622
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:33.030
that criticism of George Herbert Walker Bush and stuff,
if you see like,

623
00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.380
um,
just read that book.

624
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:41.050
<v 3>And I think that sometimes,
you know,
people tend to,
you know,</v>

625
00:38:41.230 --> 00:38:44.890
just see the evil on one side where there's just like,
uh,

626
00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:48.220
if you're overly patriotic,
you only see your enemies evil.

627
00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:52.210
And if you're overly fucking like liberal,
you only see your own country's evil.

628
00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:54.280
And it's,
it's,
you know,

629
00:38:54.730 --> 00:38:57.820
I think the theme of this is depressing because I read that book and it's just

630
00:38:57.821 --> 00:38:58.001
like,

631
00:38:58.001 --> 00:39:01.420
I just cannot fucking believe human beings could do that to other human beings.

632
00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:05.360
And I know we're guilty of it.
I know everybody else is guilty of it.

633
00:39:05.361 --> 00:39:06.420
It's just like,
it's,

634
00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:10.720
it always goes back to that fucking thing I saw on the discovery channel that

635
00:39:10.721 --> 00:39:13.930
time,
that monkey could have just killed the other monkey.
And it didn't,

636
00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:17.170
it was a smaller monkey.
And this one,
they first realizing that chimpanzees,

637
00:39:17.171 --> 00:39:17.530
eight,

638
00:39:17.530 --> 00:39:22.150
eight other monkeys and in a just was fucking keeping the other monkey alive

639
00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.860
just,
and it was getting off on the things pain.
And I,
I've ever since that,

640
00:39:26.861 --> 00:39:31.861
every fucking time I see something on fucking TV about human beings doing

641
00:39:32.651 --> 00:39:34.390
something horrible to other human beings.

642
00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.060
For some reason that plays in my head and I'm like,

643
00:39:37.061 --> 00:39:40.300
we're just fucking hairless monkeys.
Um,

644
00:39:41.110 --> 00:39:44.380
which is something Rogan might've said or something.
I Dunno,
I'm fucking tired.

645
00:39:45.560 --> 00:39:50.230
Um,
anyways,
not that clip.
He might've used that reference,
but anyways,
uh,

646
00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:53.170
fantastic cars and F is for family.
Hi Bill.

647
00:39:54.070 --> 00:39:58.630
I've just attended my 50th car show this year.
Wow.

648
00:39:58.930 --> 00:40:03.220
That's more than one a week.
Uh,
I don't think I've ever been to a car show.

649
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:07.300
I've gone,
I used to go to the car shows,
you know,
showing the latest,
you know,

650
00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:10.030
the brand new cars.
You know,
I used to go to that car show,

651
00:40:10.031 --> 00:40:11.460
but I would like to go to the,
uh,

652
00:40:14.050 --> 00:40:14.570
<v 2>mmm,</v>

653
00:40:14.570 --> 00:40:16.460
<v 3>I'd like to go to a vintage one.
Anyways,</v>

654
00:40:16.461 --> 00:40:18.380
I've just attended my 50th car show this year,

655
00:40:18.381 --> 00:40:22.640
so I'm starting to get pretty good at identifying makes and models of cars from

656
00:40:22.641 --> 00:40:24.440
all around the world.
Uh,

657
00:40:24.441 --> 00:40:28.790
I post all my photos on my public Facebook page,

658
00:40:28.791 --> 00:40:33.290
classic and modern show cars.
A you,
I gotta check that out.

659
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:39.020
Uh,
I'm enjoying the third season of F is for family.
Thank you very much.

660
00:40:39.380 --> 00:40:42.380
And I am struck by what,
by the way,

661
00:40:42.381 --> 00:40:47.330
that all of the cars have been lovingly drawn in such pain staking Lee detail

662
00:40:47.540 --> 00:40:51.980
that it's possible for a car fanatic like me to identify every single car in

663
00:40:52.090 --> 00:40:53.630
this show.
My question is,

664
00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.670
who's artistic vision was it to make such a conscious effort to depict all of

665
00:40:58.671 --> 00:41:03.620
the cars?
So realistically,
uh,
not just the ones in the center of the action,

666
00:41:03.830 --> 00:41:07.970
but all of the cars in the background as well.
I know that you're a car guy,

667
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:12.080
so I wonder if you had any influence of the aspect of the,
of the production.

668
00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:16.910
Thanks and love to you and Nia and the Kiddo.
Um,
yeah,

669
00:41:16.911 --> 00:41:19.730
that was an important thing with everybody.

670
00:41:19.731 --> 00:41:24.200
Certainly people who were into cars on the show,
because back then also,
you know,

671
00:41:26.030 --> 00:41:26.863
<v 2>mmm,</v>

672
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:32.430
<v 3>cars really looked unique back then and they had a lot more personality to them</v>

673
00:41:33.380 --> 00:41:34.100
just because

674
00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:38.060
<v 4>I guess I learned when I did Seinfeld's comedians in cars and was basically with</v>

675
00:41:38.061 --> 00:41:39.650
all the safety regulations,

676
00:41:39.651 --> 00:41:43.400
which is great cause less people die unless you're an environmentalist and then

677
00:41:43.401 --> 00:41:45.860
that's not a good thing.
But you know,
less people fucking die.

678
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:50.780
But because of the parameters of the safety regulations,
the,

679
00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:56.260
the area where the artists could create became a lot smaller.

680
00:41:56.261 --> 00:41:59.140
So stuff started looking more similar.
But back then,

681
00:41:59.170 --> 00:42:03.730
especially if you watch me on TV,
like one of the big things back in the day was,

682
00:42:04.390 --> 00:42:05.223
um,

683
00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:10.000
<v 0>you know,
the star of the show if he,
you know,
if he was a bad ass or whatever,</v>

684
00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:15.370
like it was really like,
it was a big thing.
What fucking car we drove,

685
00:42:15.760 --> 00:42:20.760
what Car Jack Lord drove on a Hawaii five o um,

686
00:42:21.610 --> 00:42:25.600
you know what,
what like Jim Rockford,
um,

687
00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:28.560
on the Rockford files,
he drove a Firebird.

688
00:42:28.600 --> 00:42:32.260
It was like the top of the line Firebird,
but he didn't have a trans am.

689
00:42:32.261 --> 00:42:35.110
And I always heard that James Garner has said this,
this guy,

690
00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:38.470
Jim Rockford wouldn't,
wouldn't drive a trans am.
He wouldn't have the money.

691
00:42:39.090 --> 00:42:43.150
He'd had the money to get the really good one,
but not the great one.
And,
um,

692
00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:45.820
and I used to always watch the Rockford files when I was a kid and I didn't

693
00:42:45.821 --> 00:42:48.130
realize how much that guy was struggling in his personal life.

694
00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:52.900
Literally living in a trailer on the fucking beach,
never married.
Um,

695
00:42:54.250 --> 00:42:58.600
and knowing that now and being old and all of that stuff,
and is,
uh,

696
00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.860
it's like,
it's the perfect car.
So,
um,

697
00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:07.780
the reason why in all the cars are loosely based on,

698
00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:10.810
you know,
cars that were around back then.
Um,

699
00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:17.160
one of my dream cars that I always wanted was a,
uh,
um,

700
00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:22.320
when I got older and I really got into cars,
was a 65 Ford galaxy.

701
00:43:22.350 --> 00:43:24.540
And I always loved the Ford,
the Wimbledon white.

702
00:43:25.410 --> 00:43:28.680
And if you could get that with that Ford Blue Interior.

703
00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:34.350
And I mean,
I,
that's just,
that's just a fucking man's car,

704
00:43:35.070 --> 00:43:38.580
you know,
I'm not into the muscle cars.
I liked the muscle cars.
I respect him.

705
00:43:38.581 --> 00:43:42.810
I liked him when I was a kid and I always feel like,
you know,
when you're a kid,

706
00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:45.270
you know,
you like the frosting better than the cake.

707
00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:48.980
And when you get older you're more into the cake and the frosting.
Uh,

708
00:43:49.110 --> 00:43:50.640
or maybe just so many.

709
00:43:50.641 --> 00:43:53.760
I watched enough of those Meekum and it's just like one Shelby,

710
00:43:53.761 --> 00:43:58.380
one Hemi after another.
I liked those fucking cars.
But,
um,

711
00:44:00.030 --> 00:44:04.320
at this point if I was going to go like a sports cars and shit,
I just like ran.

712
00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:08.760
I really like random weird shit.
And I always,
you know,

713
00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:13.410
I think I watched every fucking episode online before Jay Leno had his show of

714
00:44:13.411 --> 00:44:15.240
that Jay's garage.

715
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:18.630
And one of my favorite cars that he had was that,

716
00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:23.100
I think it was a Datsun five 10.
And it's a,

717
00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:27.810
it's a four door,
like
basically,

718
00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:32.460
uh,
you know,
sports car that Datsun put out.
It's really boxy.

719
00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:37.350
The lines of the car are fucking so cool.
And I remember,
you know,
one,

720
00:44:37.351 --> 00:44:42.351
one of my friends when I was a kid had an 81 Toyota Tercel and it was to this

721
00:44:43.170 --> 00:44:47.240
day,
it was the smoothest shifting car.
Um,

722
00:44:47.370 --> 00:44:48.270
you mean it wasn't fast?

723
00:44:48.271 --> 00:44:51.030
It was goofy is front wheel drive and it's sat up really high.

724
00:44:51.090 --> 00:44:54.330
It was like 81 or something like that ugly car.

725
00:44:54.930 --> 00:44:58.630
But I just remember shifting it.
It was a four speed and just was like,

726
00:44:58.650 --> 00:45:01.440
when it went from one gear to another,
it was like butter.

727
00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:05.220
And it was this awful time where,
uh,

728
00:45:05.221 --> 00:45:10.221
American cars had embraced what they did with the light bulb from day one with

729
00:45:10.951 --> 00:45:11.790
rather than,
you know,

730
00:45:11.791 --> 00:45:15.330
they had the technology to make it last for a long time and they decided to not

731
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:19.860
make it,
you know,
design obsolescence,
whatever they call it.

732
00:45:19.861 --> 00:45:22.200
We were doing that with cars and I swear to God,

733
00:45:22.201 --> 00:45:26.040
American cars would shit the bed or on 60,000 miles,
it was fucking brutal.

734
00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.800
And the Japanese cars were,

735
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:34.860
we're trying to establish themselves,
you know,
in America,

736
00:45:34.890 --> 00:45:36.840
you know,
and so they,

737
00:45:37.380 --> 00:45:42.210
they went the other route and we're really focusing on quality and,

738
00:45:42.570 --> 00:45:45.360
uh,
that fucking,
I'll never forget that.
So I was thinking,
I,

739
00:45:46.050 --> 00:45:49.200
I would love to drive one of those one of these days.
Like,
I just think,
you know,

740
00:45:49.210 --> 00:45:53.400
it's f I also like a lot of small cars.
Um,
you know,

741
00:45:53.401 --> 00:45:54.480
I like those bigger cars,

742
00:45:54.481 --> 00:45:57.750
but I always felt like if you drove like a big American car,

743
00:45:57.780 --> 00:46:00.660
like you had to be a big guy,
you know,

744
00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:04.470
kind of a guy's guy going into a bar and everybody kind of clears a path or

745
00:46:04.471 --> 00:46:08.640
fucking respect you.
You know,
I just,
I just didn't feel like,
you know,

746
00:46:08.641 --> 00:46:13.050
it barely five,
10,
like I was one of those guys.
So I always liked the A,

747
00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.740
we started look better in a smaller car.
Uh,

748
00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:18.810
but I've also always been like a truck guy and all that type of stuff.

749
00:46:18.811 --> 00:46:23.700
So adding said that,
um,
I'm one of those weird guys where I'm a Ford Guy,

750
00:46:23.701 --> 00:46:27.690
but I also love Chevy's.
And,
um,
I don't mean,

751
00:46:27.691 --> 00:46:28.920
I don't know how you can be a truck guy,

752
00:46:28.950 --> 00:46:33.950
not like an F-150 f two 50 and then look at a Silverado and not like that or a

753
00:46:34.111 --> 00:46:37.590
dodge ram,
especially back in the day.
Cause I think all the trucks,

754
00:46:37.591 --> 00:46:41.420
the internationals and then the random dodge once that you see are those are

755
00:46:41.421 --> 00:46:45.090
always cool because you don't see those a lot.
So anyways,
each character,

756
00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:49.470
you know,
the car that Vic drives,
um,

757
00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:53.610
the car that pogo drives that he's,
you know,

758
00:46:53.611 --> 00:46:58.320
he's like a Cadi guy.
You know,
Frank's afford guide.
Vic's got the,

759
00:46:58.321 --> 00:47:01.560
you know,
he's got the core event,
we made a gold,
you know,

760
00:47:01.561 --> 00:47:04.680
like the color of Vic's hair and just,
you know,

761
00:47:05.010 --> 00:47:06.570
cause fic is basically,

762
00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:11.040
as far as it's kind of frank looks at Vic,

763
00:47:11.041 --> 00:47:16.020
like that's how my life could have been if I,
if I didn't get married,

764
00:47:16.021 --> 00:47:18.330
you know,
he knocked up,
his wife is basically what happened.

765
00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:19.500
He was going to marry yourself,

766
00:47:19.530 --> 00:47:22.020
but he ended up having to get married sooner than he wanted to.

767
00:47:22.450 --> 00:47:26.340
So we had to put some dreams on hold.
So when he looks across,
you know,

768
00:47:26.580 --> 00:47:30.970
write out his bay window,
he just sees this guy live in this life.
You know,

769
00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:33.970
and the funny thing is is frank wouldn't have lived that life because frank

770
00:47:34.810 --> 00:47:38.200
wasn't evict type of guy.
He wasn't a lady killer.

771
00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:43.030
He was a fucking relationship guy.
And I think a lot of relationship guys,

772
00:47:43.510 --> 00:47:46.930
they have fantasy is that they could have been a lady killer rather than just

773
00:47:46.931 --> 00:47:51.030
accepting their role.
You know what I mean?
Like you're on a team and you,

774
00:47:51.031 --> 00:47:53.110
you know,
accepting your fucking roll.

775
00:47:53.111 --> 00:47:56.710
Instead you want more minutes instead of coming off the bench where if you come

776
00:47:56.711 --> 00:47:58.800
off the bench,
the team wins.
But if you don't eat,

777
00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:04.020
want more w who's a coach Riley the disease and more so anyways,

778
00:48:05.890 --> 00:48:09.610
I'm fucking guys,
I'm half asleep or something.
Fucking babbling.
Um,

779
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:11.703
yeah.
When the kids,

780
00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:13.333
<v 1>MMM,</v>

781
00:48:14.420 --> 00:48:18.500
<v 0>it says there's a 65 and Paula that Bolo and Lex have.</v>

782
00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.090
And I always loved the round headlights on that thing and I always loved,

783
00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:27.080
I mean the impalas,
late sixties impalas,
mid to late sixties and piles.

784
00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:30.650
I love those things.
I know a lot of people,
like especially the west coast guys,

785
00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:34.700
the rappers and stuff,
they like the early sixties ones,
which I really like.
Um,

786
00:48:34.730 --> 00:48:38.960
I like the one,
what is it,
the 61,
the one that lily had a,
a plane,

787
00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:43.310
a jet on the side of it.
That's the one that I like.
Um,

788
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:48.890
and what are the ones,
I dunno.
So by basically,
yeah,
we,

789
00:48:48.891 --> 00:48:53.540
we try to make sure if there's a,
if there's a like a,
um,

790
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:56.960
and the reason why,
um,

791
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:59.930
this is a great question cause I haven't really thought about this.

792
00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:04.370
The reason why sue frank Frank's wife drives the,

793
00:49:04.480 --> 00:49:06.170
the Ford Country Squire,
you know,

794
00:49:06.290 --> 00:49:09.740
with the wood down the side is uh,

795
00:49:10.160 --> 00:49:13.040
because my best friend when I was a kid across the street,

796
00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:15.673
<v 1>mmm.</v>

797
00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:17.990
<v 0>His mom who was coolest,
how she had one.</v>

798
00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:21.950
And I was just thinking about the early seventies and that type of stuff where

799
00:49:21.951 --> 00:49:25.730
my life was at.
There's a lot of real subtle stuff in there.

800
00:49:26.780 --> 00:49:31.160
There's a guide from last season,
last name Linehan,
that was the last name.

801
00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:33.470
It's funny in the show,
the guy was a jerk.

802
00:49:33.471 --> 00:49:36.950
But on my paper route that it was a great house.

803
00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:41.180
Like they were really cool people and they always tip me well and we just needed

804
00:49:41.181 --> 00:49:45.800
a name.
And that was the first thing that I thought of.
So,
uh,
yeah,
the A,

805
00:49:45.810 --> 00:49:49.010
by the way,
if you guys keep watching the show,
whatever questions you ask,

806
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:51.110
I'm not going to give away anything,
you know,

807
00:49:51.111 --> 00:49:52.850
as far as story or anything like that,

808
00:49:52.851 --> 00:49:55.670
but just as far as like some of the details.
But we really,

809
00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:58.550
when we went to make the show,
um,

810
00:49:58.551 --> 00:50:02.630
I never thought the 70s were sort of accurately portrayed after the 70s who were

811
00:50:02.631 --> 00:50:03.464
over.

812
00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:05.743
<v 1>MMM.</v>

813
00:50:06.300 --> 00:50:10.530
<v 0>It always seem to be more of the way they did it on that seventies show where it</v>

814
00:50:10.531 --> 00:50:11.880
was like,
you know,

815
00:50:11.910 --> 00:50:16.050
making fun of the crazy clothes and the lava lamps and um,

816
00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:21.450
which definitely was going on that.
But like if you look at like,

817
00:50:22.140 --> 00:50:25.890
uh,
like I love that movie dazed and confused,
right.

818
00:50:25.891 --> 00:50:28.280
But the high school parking lot is fucking ridiculous.

819
00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:30.980
<v 3>Those are high school kids and they were driving cars from the 70s,</v>

820
00:50:30.981 --> 00:50:35.270
if I remember correctly.
And the reality is,
is most people,

821
00:50:35.271 --> 00:50:39.490
like the average person,
I think with their car be three,
four years old.
And when,

822
00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.210
and when I was younger,

823
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:46.110
a lot of them were either a lot older because people just,
I dunno,

824
00:50:46.140 --> 00:50:46.711
they did,
they didn't,

825
00:50:46.711 --> 00:50:49.920
weren't living the lifestyle people live now or like something's considered old

826
00:50:49.921 --> 00:50:51.150
three years in,
you know,

827
00:50:51.151 --> 00:50:53.790
with the fucking two year lease every two years I got a new fucking car,

828
00:50:53.791 --> 00:50:54.510
you know.

829
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:58.620
So like in the early seventies there was a ton of cars left over from the 60s.

830
00:50:58.621 --> 00:51:03.390
I mean they were only like,
you know,
five to,
you know,
uh,

831
00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:08.010
whatever,
15 years old,
14 years old,
he saw a bunch of those and then like,

832
00:51:08.011 --> 00:51:09.300
you know,
cars from the 50s,

833
00:51:09.301 --> 00:51:12.510
those were considered really old because also the style look really different.

834
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:15.570
So occasionally,
you know,
we tried to throw a car in for the 1950s,

835
00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:19.690
like if you looked at Sanford and son,
it's a truck they had,

836
00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:24.700
which I believe was in 1950 or 51 Ford f 100 with the radiator was out front.

837
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:28.060
I'm just totally exposed.
And,
um,

838
00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:32.050
there was no grill or anything on it and that was to show that they didn't have

839
00:51:32.051 --> 00:51:36.520
any money,
that they were driving that thing.
And now it was funny about that.

840
00:51:36.521 --> 00:51:39.400
Now is if you saw that coming down the street,
you'd be like,
aw,

841
00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:43.240
fuck all original Patina and,
and all of that shit.
Um,

842
00:51:44.410 --> 00:51:46.770
but back then it was just like,
no,
they drove there in a junkyard.

843
00:51:46.810 --> 00:51:50.020
These guys aren't making a lot of money.
Um,
all right.

844
00:51:50.021 --> 00:51:51.670
That's one of the longest answers I ever gave,

845
00:51:51.671 --> 00:51:55.870
but I love my show and I love cars,
right?
A company raffle prize,

846
00:51:56.980 --> 00:52:01.690
dear Billy private pants.
Hey,
what that means.
Um,

847
00:52:03.580 --> 00:52:04.260
anyways,

848
00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:08.850
the company I work at recently had an outing where everyone from the company was

849
00:52:08.851 --> 00:52:09.660
invited.

850
00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:13.590
At the outing there was a raffle that was set up where you could win a prize and

851
00:52:13.591 --> 00:52:14.424
that's in quotes.

852
00:52:14.790 --> 00:52:19.650
The prize was a small statue of yourself that you could get for free from a

853
00:52:19.651 --> 00:52:22.980
different company that was hired for this purpose.

854
00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:28.110
I have to read that sentence again.
The prize was a small statue of yourself

855
00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:34.860
that you could get for free from a different company that was hired for this

856
00:52:35.351 --> 00:52:36.790
purpose.
Okay?

857
00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.360
They do this by scanning your entire body.

858
00:52:40.361 --> 00:52:45.240
All my God sending that data to their servers.
Three,

859
00:52:45.570 --> 00:52:45.590
three,

860
00:52:45.590 --> 00:52:50.590
three d printing your body as a three inch tall statue and they send the statute

861
00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:52.870
to your house.

862
00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:54.460
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

863
00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:56.260
<v 3>dude,
I swear to God,</v>

864
00:52:57.700 --> 00:53:00.400
I swear to fucking God.

865
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:03.770
If you ever bugged one of those Bilderberg meetings,

866
00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:07.850
they are planning a worldwide thinning of the fucking heard,

867
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:12.690
replacing you with a fucking robot.
Anyways,

868
00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:16.550
so in total this company would receive the following information about you,

869
00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:21.440
your full name,
your email address,
your phone number,
the company you work at,

870
00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:24.920
your home address,
and a three d scan of your entire body.

871
00:53:25.110 --> 00:53:27.930
It's nice to know there's another thinking human being out there.

872
00:53:28.140 --> 00:53:30.690
They were hundreds of people lined up for this prize.

873
00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:33.540
As I was standing there looking at people in that line,

874
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:38.190
they were all indistinguishable from cattle.
Exactly.
What do you think about it?

875
00:53:38.191 --> 00:53:40.950
You know what actually you don't even think about.
He said,
what do you,

876
00:53:40.951 --> 00:53:43.170
what do you or he or she says,
what do you think?

877
00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:47.340
Would you stand in on an hour long line for the chance to give away your soul?

878
00:53:47.340 --> 00:53:51.570
Thanks for all your,
the laughs.
I hope this message gets to you,
dude.

879
00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:55.470
And He sends sincerely,
none of your business,

880
00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:59.820
sincerely not your business.
Exactly.
You know what?
What if,

881
00:53:59.850 --> 00:54:01.380
what if that's the test.

882
00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:08.010
One of the fact that you were smart enough not to get in that line

883
00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:13.470
was the test.
We'll wait a minute.
Then the tests would be,
well,

884
00:54:13.471 --> 00:54:15.570
this guy's a problem.
He's not going to do what we say.

885
00:54:15.810 --> 00:54:18.120
So maybe if you don't get in the line,
you get whacked.
I don't know.

886
00:54:18.121 --> 00:54:20.130
There's so many ways to look at it.
I have no idea.

887
00:54:20.430 --> 00:54:23.340
But I just want to thank you on this lonely,

888
00:54:23.341 --> 00:54:26.580
depressing night that I'm having here that you gave me hope that somebody else

889
00:54:26.581 --> 00:54:30.540
views stuff like that the way I do.
Um,
anyways,

890
00:54:30.541 --> 00:54:33.270
female warriors and the worst people.
When you bring that up.

891
00:54:33.271 --> 00:54:34.460
The worst point people,
I mean,

892
00:54:34.610 --> 00:54:37.650
he'd done that and they're gonna fucking yet in anyway.

893
00:54:37.950 --> 00:54:41.850
Those people just fucking tuck them balls by and the legs.
All right.

894
00:54:41.851 --> 00:54:44.100
Female Warriors.
Mr. Barr,

895
00:54:44.101 --> 00:54:47.940
I am a huge fan of your comedy and a bigger fan of F is for family.

896
00:54:48.270 --> 00:54:51.230
The third season they had me rolling on the floor laughing so hard.

897
00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:54.480
My sides were hurting.
I feel like you're setting up.
Having said that,

898
00:54:54.481 --> 00:54:58.680
I think you're a con anyways,
which is a compliment to your genius and comedy.

899
00:54:58.710 --> 00:55:02.790
I am graduating December with my second degree in English literature.

900
00:55:02.970 --> 00:55:05.830
The first being in history,
you know.
Oh,
look at you.
Yes,
Maddie.

901
00:55:05.850 --> 00:55:08.880
I bet you know all the words there.
I'm writing you.

902
00:55:10.930 --> 00:55:12.960
I'm writing to you not to show bias at all.

903
00:55:12.961 --> 00:55:16.260
I am just hoping to Pique your interest in history a bit.

904
00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:21.420
Oh boy.
To get to the point.
Throughout history,

905
00:55:21.430 --> 00:55:25.950
females have indeed participated in wars dating back to the Stone Age.

906
00:55:26.130 --> 00:55:31.130
Some examples include Boudicca a queen who led a barbarian rev rebellion in

907
00:55:34.020 --> 00:55:38.970
Britain the first century Aidy after she and her daughters were tortured and had

908
00:55:38.971 --> 00:55:43.740
their lands ceased by Roman forces.
That sounds like a great movie though.

909
00:55:43.741 --> 00:55:45.480
She failed.
She in the end,

910
00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:50.660
let over 50,000 barbarians on a rampage against Rome and killed possibly 2

911
00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:55.170
million citizens.
Sources vary,
but you get the picture.

912
00:55:55.470 --> 00:55:58.590
Joan of arc needs no explanation.
Yeah,
it does.

913
00:55:58.591 --> 00:56:01.110
I thought she was in a whale's mouth,
wasn't she?

914
00:56:01.530 --> 00:56:05.790
Another example I think you would find interesting is a woman from the u s women

915
00:56:05.791 --> 00:56:07.680
from the USSR during World War Two,

916
00:56:07.950 --> 00:56:12.630
a woman named lid lie diem.
Lydia,
Mo

917
00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:19.200
follow
Chenko Pavlot Chenko Russians have cool.
Last name.

918
00:56:20.370 --> 00:56:25.330
Pavlik Chenko onto the Blue Line.
Pablet Chenko shoots he go eyes.
Uh,

919
00:56:25.390 --> 00:56:29.230
she got shot in the jaw and yet still killed the enemy sniper and walked away

920
00:56:29.231 --> 00:56:30.160
like it was nothing.

921
00:56:30.430 --> 00:56:34.060
I just find it interesting that women can be quite deadly when the time calls

922
00:56:34.061 --> 00:56:37.420
for it.
I don't find that interesting.
I fucking,
I watched the first 48.

923
00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:40.690
What's your take on women who took combative roles in history?

924
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:45.430
Just hoping for funny yet in lightening responses and knowing you,

925
00:56:45.431 --> 00:56:49.840
you never fail.
Hope to see more of your work and looking forward to season four.

926
00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:55.560
Um,
I don't,
I,
I dunno dude,
I am,

927
00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:01.860
I am fascinated and have nothing but respect for anyone that fights in a fucking

928
00:57:02.861 --> 00:57:04.090
war.
But it,
it,

929
00:57:04.590 --> 00:57:05.423
<v 2>yeah,</v>

930
00:57:05.880 --> 00:57:07.890
<v 3>it blows my fucking mind</v>

931
00:57:10.520 --> 00:57:15.380
that you can get in trouble now for a joke.
But war is still legal.

932
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:17.770
It does.

933
00:57:17.770 --> 00:57:22.770
The war is still like an option to solve a difference of opinion between two

934
00:57:24.261 --> 00:57:26.120
nations.
That it's like,
all right,

935
00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:31.790
basically we're going to kill more of your people than you can kill a vars and

936
00:57:31.791 --> 00:57:35.090
then that means we're going to be right.
Um,

937
00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:40.220
you know,
I mean,
having said that,
all those stories that you said were amazing.

938
00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:41.120
You know,
I love these.

939
00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:43.610
I love that you thought I was smart enough to know what Joan of arc did.

940
00:57:43.611 --> 00:57:48.260
I have no fucking idea.
She,
the sister,
that guy who betrayed Jesus,

941
00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:53.150
didn't she end up in a whale whale's mouth or something?
And you know,

942
00:57:53.230 --> 00:57:57.020
isn't it like the Female Pinocchio Story or something?
Joan of arc.

943
00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:03.060
All right.
Joan of arc nickname,

944
00:58:03.061 --> 00:58:06.960
the maid of Orleans.
Oh,
a saints fan,
uh,

945
00:58:07.180 --> 00:58:09.500
is consider it a heroine of France

946
00:58:11.490 --> 00:58:16.490
for her role during the [inaudible] phase of the Hundred Years War was canonized

947
00:58:16.951 --> 00:58:19.680
as a Roman Catholic saint.
Oh,

948
00:58:19.681 --> 00:58:24.510
they shot her ashes into the year she was born to,
I don't give a fuck.

949
00:58:24.511 --> 00:58:28.240
What did she do?
All right.

950
00:58:28.270 --> 00:58:31.240
On May 23rd,
she was cute.
Oh,
fucking Christ.

951
00:58:32.850 --> 00:58:34.200
Oh my God.
This is just,
you don't wanna.

952
00:58:34.210 --> 00:58:35.720
You know why I don't know anything about this cause I,

953
00:58:35.721 --> 00:58:40.380
I hate this part of history.
I can never read the fucking names.

954
00:58:40.620 --> 00:58:45.380
Charles the seventh,
we cannot recover Francis domination.

955
00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:47.760
A hundred years of the unknown.
King Charles the seventh sense.

956
00:58:47.761 --> 00:58:51.480
Joan of Arc sent Joan to the seas of orderliness,

957
00:58:51.510 --> 00:58:55.260
part of all released mission.
She gained prominence after the seas was lifted.

958
00:58:55.261 --> 00:58:56.580
Only nine days later,

959
00:58:56.790 --> 00:59:01.790
several additional swift victories led to Charles' sevens coronation at realms

960
00:59:02.130 --> 00:59:03.180
like,
what does that even mean?

961
00:59:03.990 --> 00:59:08.700
And I have to look up coronation this long awaited event boosted French fries.

962
00:59:08.820 --> 00:59:11.100
She did something in a war.

963
00:59:12.670 --> 00:59:15.720
Who is the one that ended up on the,
didn't she get like crucified or something?

964
00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:21.740
Captured.
Trial.
Cross dressing.
Charge execution.

965
00:59:22.850 --> 00:59:24.050
Jesus Christ.

966
00:59:28.540 --> 00:59:30.370
Why did that just make me think of Bruce Jenner,

967
00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:35.200
a truce with England trial.
There's a trial for heresy.

968
00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:40.480
What is heresy saying?
Bad Shit about the king.
Oh,

969
00:59:40.481 --> 00:59:44.770
saying bad shit about Christianity.
It always goes back to religion.
You know,

970
00:59:45.160 --> 00:59:47.350
it's weird how religion affects people.

971
00:59:47.620 --> 00:59:49.930
Some people make some stop drinking other people.

972
00:59:49.931 --> 00:59:54.550
It makes them go to an island and get shot with arrows.
It's,
it's very dangerous.

973
00:59:54.551 --> 00:59:58.900
You know,
it's like some people can handle alcohol,
other people can.
Um,
all right,

974
00:59:58.901 --> 01:00:02.380
I'll have to,
I'll have to read up on her.
Um,

975
01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.900
is there a movie about us to want to read?
Um,

976
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:10.090
what is my take on it?
Uh,
what do they say?

977
01:00:10.091 --> 01:00:13.720
Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned.
Um,

978
01:00:13.721 --> 01:00:18.580
I would hate to see women acting like men,
um,
as far as,

979
01:00:18.581 --> 01:00:19.130
you know,

980
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:21.520
going to war and all that shit and then having them having to deal with the

981
01:00:21.521 --> 01:00:25.060
nightmares and the fucking suicidal thoughts.
And all of that shit.

982
01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:27.040
It's just really,
uh,

983
01:00:27.690 --> 01:00:31.660
this is weird time right now where it's like the support of the troops and all

984
01:00:31.661 --> 01:00:36.661
that is to the point that you can't really like talk about how bad it is that

985
01:00:37.811 --> 01:00:41.230
these kids have to go over and do shit like that and then somehow emotionally

986
01:00:41.231 --> 01:00:45.920
try to get fucking through it.
And then the striking lack of,

987
01:00:46.530 --> 01:00:50.500
uh,
support they get when they come back.
I Dunno.

988
01:00:52.060 --> 01:00:55.060
I Dunno.
All of that shits to put a lot of depressing shit here.
All right.

989
01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.260
Others will,
Oh boy,
you just,

990
01:00:57.261 --> 01:01:02.150
somebody pulled me out of the fucking a lagoon here.
Hey Billy bulldog

991
01:01:03.770 --> 01:01:07.670
after trouble convincing my 47 year old father to sort out his will in the event

992
01:01:07.671 --> 01:01:10.970
that he passes away for some unforeseen circumstances.
Well,

993
01:01:10.971 --> 01:01:14.570
I gotta be honest with you.
If I was only 47 years old and my kid was going like,

994
01:01:14.571 --> 01:01:18.650
Hey dad,
you finish that will yet I think I'd start sleeping with one eye open.

995
01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.590
Um,
if such a tragedy were to occur,

996
01:01:21.591 --> 01:01:26.120
now his assets would automatically go to my so called stepmother.
Oh,

997
01:01:26.121 --> 01:01:30.710
now I see you motivation who he has only been with for a few years.
Yeah,

998
01:01:30.711 --> 01:01:35.360
man.
Yeah.
You can't do that.
As I'm sure you would agree.

999
01:01:35.870 --> 01:01:39.950
It would be unwise to give this much trust to a woman who was nothing stopping

1000
01:01:39.951 --> 01:01:44.120
her from simply taking my father's assets for herself and leaving me cause only

1001
01:01:44.121 --> 01:01:46.430
child empty handed.
Uh,

1002
01:01:46.431 --> 01:01:51.431
is there any piece of advice you could give my father or I could I to help

1003
01:01:51.561 --> 01:01:56.000
persuade them to wisen up and get this?
We'll sort it out.

1004
01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.370
Uh,
as always,
many thanks for the great work you put in and go fuck yourself.
Um,

1005
01:02:02.690 --> 01:02:07.060
I gotta tell you that's an uphill battle on two levels.
One,
you're,

1006
01:02:07.070 --> 01:02:11.570
you're talking to a guy asking him to deal with his own mortality,

1007
01:02:11.571 --> 01:02:15.650
which men do not handle well,
and then also,
you know,

1008
01:02:15.860 --> 01:02:20.310
that's his chick.
You know,
you know,
it is when someone's with somebody

1009
01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:23.700
<v 0>that's hard for them to fucking see what you're talking about.
So,</v>

1010
01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:30.280
MMM,
Jesus Christ,
I'm fucking tired and fucking bombing on these questions.

1011
01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:36.370
I Dunno.
I would start playing catch with your dad.
All right.

1012
01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:42.400
Maybe while you can slip into points you want to make while doing a fun activity

1013
01:02:42.401 --> 01:02:46.060
like that and just be like that,
you know,

1014
01:02:47.290 --> 01:02:52.120
I know you love her.
I'm not saying leave everything to me.
You know what,

1015
01:02:52.210 --> 01:02:55.390
how about this?
How about fuck all of that and you make your own money.

1016
01:02:57.010 --> 01:02:58.720
You know what I mean?
I know what you're saying.

1017
01:02:58.721 --> 01:03:02.200
Cause it'd be difficult to see some fucking broad only banged your dad for two

1018
01:03:02.201 --> 01:03:05.510
years.
Get your house.
You know,

1019
01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:09.830
you haven't said she's an asshole though.
But um,

1020
01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:15.000
uh,
the way it goes is,
is to make your own way in life.

1021
01:03:16.560 --> 01:03:19.080
That's the way to do it.
Um,

1022
01:03:20.490 --> 01:03:23.550
<v 4>just don't take over the family business unless you fucking want to win.</v>

1023
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.870
Who gives a shit,
dude?
Look,
if your dad's only 47 years old,

1024
01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:32.320
even if he had you at like fucking 25,

1025
01:03:32.321 --> 01:03:34.030
you're only 22 years old.
So I mean,

1026
01:03:34.031 --> 01:03:36.250
I don't think you've got to be eyeball in the fucking wheel at this point,

1027
01:03:36.251 --> 01:03:37.480
but I understand what you're saying.

1028
01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:41.700
<v 0>Um,
that's a weird one to bring up though.</v>

1029
01:03:45.980 --> 01:03:49.560
<v 4>Yeah,
that would definitely weird me up.
But if you're going to do it,</v>

1030
01:03:49.561 --> 01:03:52.650
that's what I would do.
I would go fishing with them.
I played catch with them.

1031
01:03:52.651 --> 01:03:56.820
I would do something where we were doing a different activity.
Um,

1032
01:03:56.850 --> 01:03:58.740
but the bottom line is that,
that,
you know,

1033
01:03:58.830 --> 01:04:02.790
trying to get it up fucking man to go out and get a will done is about as easy

1034
01:04:02.791 --> 01:04:04.440
as trying to get a drunk to get sober.

1035
01:04:04.441 --> 01:04:06.240
It's like they have to want to go fucking do it.
Yeah.

1036
01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.340
<v 0>Um,
so</v>

1037
01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:15.990
<v 4>I would use this as motivation few to not to get yourself into position that you</v>

1038
01:04:15.991 --> 01:04:19.660
don't give a shit,
uh,
that your dad passes.

1039
01:04:19.661 --> 01:04:22.240
Other than the fact that you sad that he's gone.
Forget about,
you know,

1040
01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:26.620
you getting his fucking bowling bag in the house and shit.
Um,
alright.

1041
01:04:27.130 --> 01:04:29.830
Boss's wife wants,
wants to fuck me.

1042
01:04:32.410 --> 01:04:32.600
<v 0>Yeah.</v>

1043
01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.060
<v 4>Do I really have to read this dude?
You know what to do.</v>

1044
01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.000
<v 0>No,
don't do it.
All right.
Hey,
Billy badass.</v>

1045
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:43.220
I'm a big fan of the podcast.
Here's my question.

1046
01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:47.960
I work in a grocery store in Brooklyn Heights.
Oh God,
I'm sorry.
I'm so tired.

1047
01:04:47.961 --> 01:04:49.040
I normally don't say where you're at.

1048
01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:54.290
I'm 21 years old and in college I worked at the corner store for some extra
cash.

1049
01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:56.690
My boss is a great guy and he really likes me.

1050
01:04:57.050 --> 01:05:00.890
Obviously I can't work for him every day since I'm,
I've got college and stuff,

1051
01:05:00.920 --> 01:05:04.250
but he always wants me to be the supervisor of the other guys.

1052
01:05:04.251 --> 01:05:07.520
We've been working there much longer than me and work longer hours.

1053
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:10.120
Here's the issue.
My wife's,
my boss,

1054
01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:15.260
his wife is a fine looking lady and about 35 I'd say she's a nine and a half.

1055
01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:17.980
Even if she got 14 on me is

1056
01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:20.980
<v 3>really into me.
At first I thought she was just being friendly,</v>

1057
01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:24.790
but she's become a lot less subtle about it.
Yeah.

1058
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:27.710
But Hey chicks in their thirties,
they know what they want.
Uh,

1059
01:05:27.790 --> 01:05:30.370
they don't beat around the bush.
Then,
uh,

1060
01:05:31.690 --> 01:05:35.350
on days when she knows I'll be working,
she wears many,

1061
01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.920
many skirts and sometimes a crop top.

1062
01:05:39.130 --> 01:05:43.330
She stared at my crotch all the time and laughs at my jokes.

1063
01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:46.720
I'm not a funny guy.
Jesus Christ.

1064
01:05:46.721 --> 01:05:50.590
She invited me up to their house last week when the boss was out of town.

1065
01:05:50.860 --> 01:05:53.590
I made some excuse.
I wouldn't have to go up there,

1066
01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:58.140
but I don't know what to do here.
You know it's funny.
This is,
this is a,

1067
01:05:58.150 --> 01:06:02.620
this is a classic example of sexual harassment that will never be fucking

1068
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:07.630
reported because now she's abusing her position of power where it's like now if

1069
01:06:08.711 --> 01:06:09.790
you don't Banger,

1070
01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.080
then she'll fucking maybe say something bad and you two are her husband.

1071
01:06:14.650 --> 01:06:16.630
Maybe even say that you grabbed her ass.

1072
01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:20.260
God knows what the fuck she's gonna do a,
she's smoking hot,

1073
01:06:20.261 --> 01:06:23.260
but she's a married woman.
Exactly.
Not only that,

1074
01:06:23.290 --> 01:06:26.350
but my boss is a great guy who's been really great to meet.

1075
01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:29.320
I don't know what my options are here.
Here are,

1076
01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:33.820
you know exactly what your options are by tell my boss about my wife,

1077
01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:38.170
about his wife is probably going to fire me and I really need this job.

1078
01:06:38.171 --> 01:06:40.690
Don't fucking do that.
On the other hand,
if I don't tell them,

1079
01:06:40.930 --> 01:06:44.020
I'm probably going to end up giving it,
giving into her.

1080
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:48.130
I only have so much control.
Thanks and go fuck yourself.
This is what you need.

1081
01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:51.250
Well,
she's never said I want to fuck you.

1082
01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:54.700
So,
um,

1083
01:06:58.550 --> 01:07:02.820
oh God.
Here's the thing,

1084
01:07:02.821 --> 01:07:03.840
just don't fuck her.

1085
01:07:05.610 --> 01:07:06.443
<v 1>That's it.</v>

1086
01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:10.520
<v 3>Rub One out before you go to war.
Give fucking 21.</v>

1087
01:07:10.521 --> 01:07:13.670
Rub it out twice and just fucking go to work.

1088
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:19.960
Put your head down.
And just that,
I don't know.
That's it.
And well,

1089
01:07:20.110 --> 01:07:24.880
don't,
don't put it too far down corporate fucking skirt.
Um,

1090
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:30.510
I would just high in buyer,
that's it.

1091
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.330
She'll quit after I,
I imagine she will quit after awhile.

1092
01:07:35.570 --> 01:07:39.530
Although if she's a nine and a half,
okay,

1093
01:07:40.250 --> 01:07:43.220
that gets dangerous because you know,

1094
01:07:43.250 --> 01:07:48.250
hot women age as well as former athletes do where it's just one day that the

1095
01:07:49.970 --> 01:07:53.180
Belle of the ball and then all of a sudden the cheering stops and nobody gives a

1096
01:07:53.181 --> 01:07:56.060
shit anymore.
And then they kind of have to,
you know,

1097
01:07:56.090 --> 01:07:59.330
develop a fucking personality.
So like you,

1098
01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:04.070
by you not giving into her might trigger some fucked up shit with her.

1099
01:08:04.071 --> 01:08:05.030
But here's the thing,
dude,

1100
01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:08.450
I under no circumstances can you fucking bang this woman.

1101
01:08:09.290 --> 01:08:11.020
You can't do it.
All right.

1102
01:08:12.460 --> 01:08:17.060
So what I would do is I would continue to fucking rub it out twice,

1103
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:20.480
rub one out twice before I can go to work.
If you feel in a week.

1104
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:24.470
And then I would just,
I would be friendly tour and then that's it.

1105
01:08:24.471 --> 01:08:28.430
And just wait until it's like you playing poker here.

1106
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:32.510
Eventually she,
as long as you're nice to her.

1107
01:08:33.700 --> 01:08:34.080
<v 1>Okay.</v>

1108
01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:38.820
<v 3>She can't get mad at you.
All she could do was get frustrated and eventually she,</v>

1109
01:08:38.821 --> 01:08:43.821
she might get so frustrated that she just gives up or she puts the cards on the

1110
01:08:44.671 --> 01:08:46.980
table when she puts her cards on the table.

1111
01:08:47.220 --> 01:08:51.660
You just say how much you like,
first of all,

1112
01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:56.370
she's married and then just talk about how much you like her husband and how

1113
01:08:56.371 --> 01:08:58.470
much you respect them and what a great guy he is.

1114
01:09:01.770 --> 01:09:05.500
<v 0>You know,
and then the g and then this is the big thing.
Don't judge her either.</v>

1115
01:09:07.190 --> 01:09:08.630
<v 3>Okay.
Like</v>

1116
01:09:08.850 --> 01:09:12.000
<v 0>how George Bush didn't rub it in the fucking noses of the Russians.</v>

1117
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:13.410
Just let the wall come down.

1118
01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:18.710
The big thing in something like that is you is to give her a dignified out.

1119
01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:24.300
Not saying she deserves one.
I'm saying this for you.

1120
01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:28.680
If you give her a dignified out where she can feel she can walk away and not be

1121
01:09:28.681 --> 01:09:32.220
embarrassed to Sam,
totally flattered.
If you weren't married,

1122
01:09:32.221 --> 01:09:34.410
I absolutely would not to mention I,
you know,

1123
01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:39.930
I think your husband's a great guy and he's been great to me,
so I,
I can't.
Okay.

1124
01:09:40.020 --> 01:09:44.100
And
Yeah,
yeah,
that's,
you know,
and I would just,
you know,

1125
01:09:44.101 --> 01:09:48.630
something like that and then just,
just,
you know,
hopefully if fucking goes away,

1126
01:09:48.631 --> 01:09:52.830
but I do find it funny with all of this abusive power and all of this shit,

1127
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:54.403
<v 1>you know,</v>

1128
01:09:56.050 --> 01:10:00.250
<v 0>and I don't think your situation is fucking unique.
Um,</v>

1129
01:10:00.370 --> 01:10:02.200
it's just that nobody cares to hear it.

1130
01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:05.020
So I'm glad you put it on this podcast because,
uh,

1131
01:10:06.480 --> 01:10:11.400
<v 1>you know,
I give a shit.
Good luck buddy.
That's a tough one.</v>

1132
01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.160
<v 0>Um,
all right,
that's the podcast.
Go fuck yourselves.</v>
