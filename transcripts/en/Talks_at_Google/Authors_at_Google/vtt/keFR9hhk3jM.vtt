00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.820
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.560
SPEAKER: Hi everyone and
thank you for coming.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.860
Today, authors Jorge
Cham and Daniel Whiteson

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.660
will be telling us
everything they do not

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.550
know about their new
book, "We Have No Idea."

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.610
Jorge Cham is the creator
of the popular online comic,

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.740
"Piled Higher And Deeper,"
also known as "PhD Comics."

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.580
He earned his PhD in
robotics at Stanford.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.250
Daniel Whiteson is a professor
of experimental particle

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.860
physics at the University
of California, Irvine,

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.320
and a fellow of the
American Physical Society.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.160
He conducts research using the
Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.260
Please take a moment to
silence your cell phones

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.900
and anything else
that will beep.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.610
And then join me in
welcoming Daniel and Jorge.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.518
JORGE CHAM: Hello.

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:00.730
AUDIENCE: Hello.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.140
JORGE CHAM: How's it going?

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.640
OK.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.216
It doesn't sound very excited.

00:01:05.216 --> 00:01:05.915
AUDIENCE: Woo.

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:06.540
JORGE CHAM: OK.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.040
Now.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.990
All right.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.800
Not much better.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.431
But we'll take what we can get.

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:14.930
Well, first of all, thank you
to Google for inviting us here

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.380
today.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.480
We are very excited.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.630
And I would tell you
exactly how excited I am.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.360
But Google probably already
knows everything about me.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.170
So there's no
reason to tell you.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.670
Cool.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.080
Well, my name is Jorge
Cham, as was mentioned.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.840
I'm a cartoonist.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.256
And this is professor Daniel
Whiteson, from the University

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:34.520
of California, at Irvine.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.197
And together, we're
the co-authors

00:01:36.197 --> 00:01:38.030
of this book called "We
Have No Idea," which

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.082
is about all the things we
don't know about the universe.

00:01:42.082 --> 00:01:44.540
Now, today, I'm going to talk
to you a little bit about how

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.420
our collaboration started,
how we got together and wrote

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.139
this book.

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:49.430
And then Daniel will take over.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.666
And he'll talk to you actually
about what's in the book.

00:01:52.666 --> 00:01:55.040
Now, I'm a cartoonist.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.990
And to me, being a
cartoonist, a cartoonist

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.299
is about taking a blank page
and filling it with an idea.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:03.590
And so the idea we want to
draw out for all of you here

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.750
today is this idea
that there are still

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.447
big gaps in our knowledge
of the universe.

00:02:09.447 --> 00:02:11.030
Now in addition to
being a cartoonist,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.885
I also happened to
have a PhD in robotics.

00:02:13.885 --> 00:02:15.260
Now, you might be
wondering, what

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.790
does having a PhD
in robotics have

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:18.920
to do with being a cartoonist?

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.910
Well, I can tell you
that my parents are also

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.390
very concerned about
that whole life plan.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.589
But I have a PhD in
robotics, from Stanford

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:30.880
actually, just down the street.

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.770
And, in fact, my
research there focused

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.870
on making robots that could run.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.070
They could run and walk
like animals can in nature.

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.810
And in particular, I focused
on making robots that

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.710
could run like cockroaches.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.720
Yeah.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.619
So here is a quick movie of
what these robots look like.

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:50.615
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:03:02.092 --> 00:03:04.088
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:12.917 --> 00:03:13.625
JORGE CHAM: Yeah.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:16.360
So I like to show this movie
at all my presentations

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:17.770
for two reasons.

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.860
First of all, I feel like this
movie really kind of represents

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.024
what getting a PhD feels like.

00:03:24.024 --> 00:03:25.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:28.732 --> 00:03:30.190
Some of you might
know the feeling.

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.040
You feel like you're running
frantically the whole time,

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.827
but you're not getting anywhere.

00:03:34.827 --> 00:03:37.410
Meanwhile, there are some more
intelligent beings stamping you

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.320
down.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.820
No.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.736
But I also like to show
it because it's really

00:03:41.736 --> 00:03:43.201
kind of the only way that--

00:03:43.201 --> 00:03:44.700
it's really the
only way that anyone

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.575
will look at my research.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.519
Gotcha.

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.060
Because it seemed a little bit
more popular than the research

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.484
I spent years working on as
part of my actual career.

00:03:56.484 --> 00:03:57.900
A little bit more
popular has been

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.000
what I was doing when
I should've been doing

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.610
research, when I
was procrastinating,

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.070
which was to make these comic
strips called "Piled Higher

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:07.364
and Deeper," or "PhD Comics."

00:04:07.364 --> 00:04:09.030
And these are comics
that I just started

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.279
writing as a graduate student.

00:04:10.279 --> 00:04:11.917
It was my first
year at Stanford.

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:13.500
And I guess I kind
of wrote about what

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.290
it was like to start
in a PhD program

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:23.310
and find a place in a lab, all
the begging you have to do.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.840
I also kind of wrote
about what it's

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:32.880
like to be a teaching
assistant, dealing

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.720
with those annoying
undergraduates.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.510
We don't have any here
today, do we, any interns?

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:40.450
No.

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.950
Oh.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.850
All right.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.910
I'm sure you're cool.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.580
You're here.

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.135
You must be cool.

00:04:48.135 --> 00:04:50.010
Actually, the comics
were also about learning

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.096
about grad student etiquette.

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:00.300
Well, you should never
ask a grad student

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.397
how is your research going.

00:05:02.397 --> 00:05:04.230
So I just kind of kept
drawing these comics.

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.720
And then one day, I decided
to take my procrastination

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.310
to the next level.

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.400
And I started posting these on
a free web server on campus.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.180
And as most things like
these happen on the internet,

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.280
somebody read it on
campus and liked it.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:18.330
And then they told
their friends that they

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:20.460
knew in other universities
about this web site.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:23.400
And then they told their
friends and their lab mates.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.666
And those people told other
people in other universities.

00:05:26.666 --> 00:05:29.040
And so slowly over the years,
these comics kind of spread

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:35.430
out into the world,
kind of like a virus.

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.850
To the point where about 6
or 7 million people a year

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:41.640
come to the "PhD
Comics" web site,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.697
which is an incredibly
small number

00:05:45.697 --> 00:05:47.280
if you think about
the fact that there

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.890
are about 7 billion
people on this planet.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:53.070
So there's about a 0.1% chance
that you've ever heard of me

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.260
before I walked into this room.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.310
But it just so happened that
one of those millions of people

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.270
who went to the web
site was a professor

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:03.840
at the University of
California at Irvine,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.070
who saw these comics.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.660
And he decided to
email me one day.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.243
Out of the blue, I
just get this email

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:09.870
in my inbox saying, hey, Jorge.

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:11.130
I've see your comics online.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:12.920
I think they're pretty good.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.220
Can I commission you?

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.230
Can I pay you to write some
comics about the Higgs boson?

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:21.294
Now, this was a few
years ago, where

00:06:21.294 --> 00:06:23.460
there was a lot of attention
in the media being paid

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.920
to this discovery, that people
were searching for the Higgs

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.850
boson.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.782
And Daniel, the
professor, didn't

00:06:28.782 --> 00:06:30.990
think that people were doing
a good job of explaining

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.182
what this interesting and
complex phenomenon was

00:06:34.182 --> 00:06:35.640
and how people were
looking for it.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.220
So he decided to contact me
and offer to commission me,

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:41.630
to make something that
explained what it was.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:44.650
And so I thought what?

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:47.780
You want to pay me?

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:48.600
What is that?

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:50.180
I don't understand.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.090
I just put things on
the internet for free.

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:54.010
So I said yes.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.130
And so I went down
and I interviewed him.

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.740
And we had a conversation
over lunch at the cafeteria.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:01.198
And instead of taking notes,
I kind of brought my recorder.

00:07:01.198 --> 00:07:02.920
And I recorded our conversation.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:04.980
And then when I went home
to draw these comments,

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.050
I decided to experiment
a little bit.

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:09.330
And so I took the audio
from the recordings

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.280
and I recorded myself
drawing the comics.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:12.946
And I kind of put
those things together.

00:07:12.946 --> 00:07:16.080
And we made a video in
addition to the comics.

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.420
And we decided to
take this video

00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:20.529
and we posted it
on this web site.

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:21.570
You may have heard of it.

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.250
It's called YouTube.

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:28.530
And so now, I'll just play
for you guys one or two

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:31.640
minutes, a clip, a one or two
minute clip from this video,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.440
just so you kind of get a sense
of hour collaboration started.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.843
So here's a clip from the video.

00:07:37.843 --> 00:07:38.820
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.780
- One of the things people
predict is the Higgs boson.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.690
The idea is that Higgs
boson is the particle that

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.145
is responsible for giving
mass to the other particles.

00:07:47.145 --> 00:07:48.770
So anything that is
going to have mass,

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.270
it means it has stuff to it.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.010
It's not actually stuff.

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:53.840
Earlier I was saying
the electron has mass,

00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.900
but it has no volume.

00:07:54.900 --> 00:07:55.750
How can that be?

00:07:55.750 --> 00:07:58.160
It turns out mass
is probably just

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.019
characteristic of a particle,
the way like charge is.

00:08:01.019 --> 00:08:03.060
Like, some particles have
charge, like electrons.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:03.939
Some particles don't.

00:08:03.939 --> 00:08:05.480
It's just a different
kind of charge.

00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:09.070
So you can think of mass as
sort of gravitational charge.

00:08:09.070 --> 00:08:12.530
And when two things both have
mass, they attract each other.

00:08:12.530 --> 00:08:14.750
Interestingly, you
can't have negative mass

00:08:14.750 --> 00:08:17.585
or repulsive gravity.

00:08:17.585 --> 00:08:18.085
All right.

00:08:18.085 --> 00:08:19.610
So the collision happens.

00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:22.430
It lasts for like 10 to
the negative 23 seconds.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:24.530
And you get one measurement.

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:27.410
So if you say, well,
I'm going to plot

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:29.127
the mass, the total
energy, of this guy.

00:08:29.127 --> 00:08:30.710
I'm going to add
this guy and this guy

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:33.140
together and add
the total energy,

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.350
this axis here is
number of collisions.

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:38.875
In your individual experiment,
you get one measurement,

00:08:38.875 --> 00:08:39.559
right here.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:41.674
Do another one, you get
another measurement.

00:08:41.674 --> 00:08:42.919
You do another one.

00:08:42.919 --> 00:08:44.740
Eventually, you
build up your data.

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:48.190
And the data looks
like this, for example.

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.690
And then you have two theories
that predict the data.

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.190
One says, well, I'm going to
predict there's no Higgs boson.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:54.470
So the data should
fall along this line.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:55.610
And the other is
I'm going to predict

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.010
that plus a Higgs boson.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.150
And the problem is the
difference between these two

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:00.610
theories is very small.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.750
And so it's very
hard to distinguish

00:09:02.750 --> 00:09:07.118
these two with our data because
the predicted effect is tiny.

00:09:07.118 --> 00:09:09.017
If the predicted
effect were huge,

00:09:09.017 --> 00:09:10.850
it would be very easy
to tell the difference

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:14.200
between with Higgs boson
or not with Higgs boson.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:15.899
But the predicted
effect is tiny,

00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:17.190
and so it's really hard to see.

00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:19.510
What you need is a
huge amount of data.

00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.180
You need to take a bajilliion
collisions before you

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:23.310
can see the difference.

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:26.120
That's why we run this thing
40 million times a second,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.030
all day, all year, to
get a lot of collisions,

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.065
to tell small differences
between theories.

00:09:31.065 --> 00:09:32.940
It's like when you take
a picture of the sky.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.480
If you just take a picture,
you get a little bit of light.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.630
But the longer you leave the
telescope looking at the sky,

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.460
the more you can see
farther away things.

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:41.043
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:41.043 --> 00:09:42.430
JORGE CHAM: I like it.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:42.930
Cool.

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:44.160
That was the video.

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:47.464
And so we posted this online.

00:09:47.464 --> 00:09:49.880
And then it just so happened
that a few months later, they

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.686
actually discovered
the Higgs boson.

00:09:51.686 --> 00:09:53.060
And so when they
discovered this,

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.710
there was a huge
amount of attention

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.040
paid on this from the media
and the popular press.

00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:00.380
And this video
sort of went viral.

00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:01.970
Millions of people
watched this video.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.740
And a lot of people
were pointing

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.690
to the video as the
clearest and easiest

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:07.790
to understand
explanation of what

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.740
this kind of complex
phenomenon was,

00:10:09.740 --> 00:10:11.500
and how people were
looking for it,

00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.864
and especially why they
were looking for it.

00:10:13.864 --> 00:10:15.280
So I thought that
was pretty cool,

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:17.600
that the clearest and
easiest to understand

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.420
explanation didn't come from
"The New York Times" media

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:20.960
department.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:25.660
It didn't come from some
professional company

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.780
or animators.

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:29.150
It came from actually
one of the scientists who

00:10:29.150 --> 00:10:32.060
worked on the project, who
decided to take the initiative,

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:34.160
and commissioned an
artist to work with them,

00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:36.860
to create something that
explained this to the public.

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.150
So I thought that
was pretty cool.

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.690
So since then, we've worked
on a couple of other projects

00:10:41.690 --> 00:10:42.190
together.

00:10:42.190 --> 00:10:47.080
But our last project is this
book called "We Have No Idea."

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.180
And now to talk to you about
the ideas inside of "We Have

00:10:50.180 --> 00:10:52.820
No Idea" is Daniel Whiteson.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.230
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.260
DANIEL WHITESON:
Hello, everyone.

00:10:59.260 --> 00:11:00.440
And thanks Jorge.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.840
So before I get started,
I have to correct

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.100
Jorge's story a little bit.

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.980
He's overly modest when
he tells that anecdote.

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.506
If any of you have
been in academia,

00:11:08.506 --> 00:11:10.380
you know that Jorge is
not just a cartoonist.

00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.080
He's sort of a celebrity.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:14.440
I go around and I visit
lots of physics labs.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:16.584
And on almost every
single wall, there

00:11:16.584 --> 00:11:18.500
is one of Jorge's cartoons
because he's really

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.100
captured the suffering
of the graduate students.

00:11:22.100 --> 00:11:23.810
So he's really super-well-known.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:25.730
And when I was
thinking about how

00:11:25.730 --> 00:11:27.572
to explain physics
using cartoons,

00:11:27.572 --> 00:11:29.030
I thought, well,
who could possibly

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:32.140
have both the artistic skills
and the technical understanding

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:34.490
to communicate these
difficult topics?

00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.790
And so my wife, who is also
a huge fan of "PhD Comics,"

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:40.409
said why don't you email Jorge
Cham and ask him to do it?

00:11:40.409 --> 00:11:41.450
And I thought sure, yeah.

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.340
And then I'll write
an email to Brad Pitt

00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.760
and ask him to make a
movie about me also,

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:47.920
like just as likely
to be successful.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.797
But Brad hasn't gotten
back to me about the movie.

00:11:50.797 --> 00:11:52.880
But I had the great pleasure
of working with Jorge

00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.450
on this project.

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:54.950
Yeah.

00:11:54.950 --> 00:11:56.510
You're Brad Pitt
in this scenario.

00:11:56.510 --> 00:11:57.544
JORGE CHAM: I like it.

00:11:57.544 --> 00:11:58.460
DANIEL WHITESON: Yeah.

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.220
So our book is called
"We Have No Idea."

00:12:01.220 --> 00:12:03.140
And instead of being
another science book that

00:12:03.140 --> 00:12:05.300
explains what science
has figured out,

00:12:05.300 --> 00:12:07.970
the focus of this book is
about what we don't know,

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:10.680
all the things that we don't
know about the universe.

00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.560
So if you come to hear
a talk from an author,

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:15.450
you expect them to be an expert
on the topic, a real authority.

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:16.400
So you might be
wondering, well, like,

00:12:16.400 --> 00:12:17.566
what's this guy's expertise?

00:12:17.566 --> 00:12:20.000
Like, not having
ideas or something?

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.740
And so it doesn't
sound so great to claim

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.290
that I'm an expert in our
level of cosmic ignorance.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.177
But that's sort
of the situation.

00:12:26.177 --> 00:12:28.010
And you might wonder,
well, why write a book

00:12:28.010 --> 00:12:29.420
about the things we don't know?

00:12:29.420 --> 00:12:31.730
And it's not that I want
to celebrate our ignorance.

00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:34.890
There's plenty of
that going on already.

00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:38.330
It's that I want to convince
you that in science, ignorance

00:12:38.330 --> 00:12:39.780
is opportunity.

00:12:39.780 --> 00:12:41.570
It's an opportunity
to make discoveries.

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.850
Because when you know
what you don't know,

00:12:43.850 --> 00:12:47.594
then you know where to look and
how to answer these questions.

00:12:47.594 --> 00:12:49.010
And so what I want
to do, and what

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.500
we hope to do in this
book, is to introduce you

00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:55.010
to our staggering cosmic
level of ignorance,

00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:57.770
to prepare you for all
the awesome discoveries

00:12:57.770 --> 00:12:59.920
that we think are coming
around the corner.

00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:00.420
OK.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:03.740
Because it's when you can
confront your ignorance,

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.870
then you know how to
look for the answers.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.850
You know how to begin
your exploration.

00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:10.670
In the end, it's really
about the exploration.

00:13:10.670 --> 00:13:13.610
And when I was a kid, I
thought the age of exploration

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:14.739
sounded like a lot of fun.

00:13:14.739 --> 00:13:17.030
I mean all you had to do to
discover something new back

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:19.970
then was jump in a ship,
sail across the ocean,

00:13:19.970 --> 00:13:21.650
and land on a new beach.

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.900
You could be the first person
to ever walk on a beach,

00:13:23.900 --> 00:13:26.060
or eat a new kind of
fruit, or something.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:28.210
These were amazing
firsts in human history.

00:13:28.210 --> 00:13:30.020
And I wanted one.

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:34.340
Imagine like the first person
to ever see the Grand Canyon.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:36.680
There was the first person
that got to do that.

00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.230
Or the first person to
ever eat chocolate, right.

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.280
That was an experience.

00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.230
Or the first person to ever
eat chocolate while looking

00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:43.490
at the Grand Canyon, right.

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.752
These are all important
first in human history.

00:13:45.752 --> 00:13:47.210
And I wanted to be
the first person

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:50.555
to know something, or do
something, or see something.

00:13:50.555 --> 00:13:52.680
But as you're reading about
the age of exploration,

00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:54.350
this happened
hundreds of years ago.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.770
There aren't anymore new
continents to discover

00:13:57.770 --> 00:14:02.270
or islands to land on and
name after your poodle.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.710
And thanks to Google
Earth, for example,

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.470
it's very difficult
to say that there's

00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:08.030
anything left to explore.

00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:09.410
And the more you
look around you,

00:14:09.410 --> 00:14:11.270
the more you get the
feeling, like, well, not only

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.478
have we explored and mapped
the surface of the Earth,

00:14:13.478 --> 00:14:15.860
we've also really started
to master technical things

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.300
and the way things work.

00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:19.280
I mean we have amazing things.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:21.260
Airplanes that can
fly over oceans.

00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.030
You can download all
of human knowledge

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:26.300
into a little device
that fits in your pocket.

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.360
You can make a billion
dollars off of a single idea.

00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:32.420
I mean it's truly a crazy
modern world we live.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:33.770
It's an age of wonders.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:36.500
So you might get the sense
that scientists mostly

00:14:36.500 --> 00:14:37.320
figured things out.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:39.403
That we just have a few
little details to wrap up.

00:14:39.403 --> 00:14:42.140
And then, we're basically done
understanding the universe.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.973
Well, the point I want
to make to you today,

00:14:43.973 --> 00:14:46.340
and the point in our book,
is that exactly the opposite

00:14:46.340 --> 00:14:47.109
is true.

00:14:47.109 --> 00:14:48.650
That, in fact, we're
at the beginning

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:51.110
of a new age of exploration.

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:52.820
An era of exploration
that I hope

00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.150
will reveal staggering, crazy
ideas about the universe,

00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:00.200
that currently we
have no idea about.

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.300
So what do I mean
age of exploration?

00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:04.860
Like, how is it possible
to explore things

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.332
where we had such a deep
understanding of the universe?

00:15:07.332 --> 00:15:09.290
Well, the kind of
exploration I'm talking about

00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:12.500
is the kind where we ask
big questions, really

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:16.310
big, fat, juicy, basic,
ancient, deep questions.

00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:18.080
The kind of questions
that everybody

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.980
wants to know the answer to,
the really big, fat questions.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:24.030
The questions which,
if you knew the answer,

00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:26.180
it would change the way
you felt about your place

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:28.640
in the universe and
the human situation.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.940
These kind of big questions.

00:15:29.940 --> 00:15:31.570
So let's be concrete about it.

00:15:31.570 --> 00:15:33.320
What kind of questions
am I talking about?

00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:34.575
Well, you went down
the hallway and asked

00:15:34.575 --> 00:15:36.950
a random person, what are
the most important questions

00:15:36.950 --> 00:15:37.610
in life?

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:39.200
They might say things like this.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.310
Well, why are we here?

00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:41.660
That's a big one.

00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:44.477
What happens after we die,
also an important question.

00:15:44.477 --> 00:15:46.060
If I knew the answer
to that question,

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:47.643
it might change the
way I live my life

00:15:47.643 --> 00:15:50.540
or treat people, these kind
of really deep, big questions.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.610
Another popular one is what
is it like to be a bat?

00:15:53.610 --> 00:15:55.860
This is a question people
think about sometimes.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.530
And the interesting thing
about these questions

00:15:58.530 --> 00:16:00.600
is that while they
are deep questions

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:04.060
and important questions, they're
also philosophy questions.

00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:06.840
Which means that you can spend a
lot of time thinking about them

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.290
and arguing about them, and not
necessarily make any progress.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:12.285
Even if you smoke banana
peels for 20 years,

00:16:12.285 --> 00:16:14.160
and you go down to the
philosophy department,

00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:15.360
you might not figure it out.

00:16:15.360 --> 00:16:16.470
And you might think
this last one,

00:16:16.470 --> 00:16:19.136
what is it like to be a bat, you
might think that's just a joke.

00:16:19.136 --> 00:16:22.050
It's actually the title of the
most widely cited philosophy

00:16:22.050 --> 00:16:24.060
paper of all time.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:26.619
People are still arguing about
what it's like to be a bat.

00:16:26.619 --> 00:16:28.660
And I think they're never
going to figure it out.

00:16:28.660 --> 00:16:30.180
And that's the problem
with philosophy questions.

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:30.720
They're important.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.350
They're deep.

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:33.150
I don't mean to
dismiss philosophy.

00:16:33.150 --> 00:16:35.770
But they don't have
objective answers.

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:37.260
The cool thing to
me is that there

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.920
are other questions, questions
just as deep, just as ancient,

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.090
just as important.

00:16:42.090 --> 00:16:45.060
But these are science
questions, questions like this.

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:46.890
What is everything made out of?

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:49.020
How did the universe begin?

00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.870
The universe has
one true history.

00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:54.550
It began in a certain
way, and no other way.

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:57.027
And if you knew that story,
here's how the universe began,

00:16:57.027 --> 00:16:58.860
here's what came before
the big bang, here's

00:16:58.860 --> 00:17:02.040
what caused the big bang,
you would feel differently

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.130
about our lives, and the way
we live it, and the future.

00:17:05.130 --> 00:17:07.859
These are important
questions, at the same level.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:10.920
The cool thing is these
questions have answers.

00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:13.680
There is a true, factual
answer to these questions.

00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.510
And we can discover it.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:17.550
If we do the right
experiment, and put together

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:19.692
the right pieces and the
clues, we could actually

00:17:19.692 --> 00:17:20.400
learn the answer.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.920
After which, no matter how
many banana peels you smoke,

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.380
no reasonable people
can disagree anymore

00:17:25.380 --> 00:17:26.700
about the answers.

00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.202
Unfortunately, we can't
include, like, the US government

00:17:29.202 --> 00:17:31.410
in the list of reasonable
people anymore because they

00:17:31.410 --> 00:17:33.360
don't listen to science.

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:36.810
But people who listen to science
and accept objective truths

00:17:36.810 --> 00:17:38.340
can actually agree
on the answers

00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.200
to big, deep, and
ancient questions.

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.394
To me, that's incredible.

00:17:41.394 --> 00:17:42.810
And that's the
kind of exploration

00:17:42.810 --> 00:17:44.430
that I'm talking about.

00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:46.454
So let's zoom in on
one of these questions.

00:17:46.454 --> 00:17:48.870
This one here is the one that
I spend my professional life

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:49.620
working on.

00:17:49.620 --> 00:17:51.510
What is the universe
made out of?

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:53.970
And this is really a basic
and a reasonable question.

00:17:53.970 --> 00:17:56.760
I mean if you wake up as, like,
a conscious being in the world.

00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:59.070
You look around you and you
ask, what am I made out of?

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:00.028
What is he made out of?

00:18:00.028 --> 00:18:01.450
How is everything put together?

00:18:01.450 --> 00:18:02.910
What are the rules?

00:18:02.910 --> 00:18:04.830
What is the most basic
element of matter?

00:18:04.830 --> 00:18:06.660
How does this whole thing work?

00:18:06.660 --> 00:18:08.710
It's an ancient question,
a basic question.

00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:11.430
And I think a reasonable one
to want to know the answer to.

00:18:11.430 --> 00:18:14.340
I remember, as a kid, smashing
rocks together, and seeing

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.290
them break into smaller
rocks, and wondering

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.604
how long can you do this for?

00:18:17.604 --> 00:18:19.770
Can you just keep getting
smaller and smaller rocks?

00:18:19.770 --> 00:18:21.660
At some point, is
it no longer rock?

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.160
And I imagined that
people have been

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:24.430
doing this for a long time.

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:25.846
I don't think I'm
the first person

00:18:25.846 --> 00:18:28.080
to ever smash rocks together.

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.870
I think it's an old question.

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:32.370
It's the kind of question people
have been asking themselves

00:18:32.370 --> 00:18:35.490
since people have
been asking questions.

00:18:35.490 --> 00:18:38.370
And if particle physicists
were superheroes,

00:18:38.370 --> 00:18:41.760
this would be their origin
story, something like this.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:45.479
This is the dawn of
particle physics here.

00:18:45.479 --> 00:18:46.770
And it's an important question.

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.690
But it's a difficult
question to tackle.

00:18:48.690 --> 00:18:50.110
What is everything made out of?

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:51.090
It's a big question.

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:52.420
How do you approach that?

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:54.060
Well, in science,
our strategy, when

00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:56.700
we are tackling something
very big and very difficult,

00:18:56.700 --> 00:18:58.810
is try the dumbest thing first.

00:18:58.810 --> 00:19:00.900
Just do the simplest,
most obvious thing first.

00:19:00.900 --> 00:19:03.030
If that doesn't work, try
the second dumbest thing,

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.652
or extrapolate from
it a little bit.

00:19:04.652 --> 00:19:07.110
So what's the simplest approach
to answering this question,

00:19:07.110 --> 00:19:08.430
what is everything made out of?

00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:10.560
Well, you might just try a list.

00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:14.640
Look around you and literally
say, what's in the universe?

00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:17.280
So your list might look
something like this.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.270
The universe has me.

00:19:18.270 --> 00:19:18.820
It has you.

00:19:18.820 --> 00:19:20.700
It has this rock,
the other rock,

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.670
that other rock over there.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.820
And this approach,
using a list, is

00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.140
going have a lot of problems.

00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:30.030
Problem number one
is the universe

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:31.560
has a lot of rocks in it.

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.575
So your list is going
to be super-duper long.

00:19:33.575 --> 00:19:35.950
And you guys like thinking
about lists and organizations.

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.620
You might also
wonder, like, well,

00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.545
is the list exclusive
or inclusive?

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:40.920
Because if it's
inclusive, then I

00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.753
had to have all the
things in the list also.

00:19:42.753 --> 00:19:44.730
And is the list on the list?

00:19:44.730 --> 00:19:47.020
There's lots of problems there.

00:19:47.020 --> 00:19:49.080
The other problem
with a list approach

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.320
is that the universe has
more than just rocks in it.

00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.820
For example, as you
look around you,

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:55.736
you discover the universe
is full of all sorts

00:19:55.736 --> 00:19:57.390
of crazy, interesting things.

00:19:57.390 --> 00:19:58.105
There's rocks.

00:19:58.105 --> 00:19:58.980
But there's also air.

00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:59.640
And there's water.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:00.348
And there's fire.

00:20:00.348 --> 00:20:01.965
And there's blueberries
and iPhones.

00:20:01.965 --> 00:20:03.840
And the more you look
around, the more you're

00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:07.140
sort of impressed and staggered
by the incredible complexity

00:20:07.140 --> 00:20:09.120
of the world we live in.

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.750
For example, there's puppies,
and bicycles, and strangely

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:15.120
muscular fellows who become
governor of California.

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:17.100
The world is really full
of interesting stuff.

00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:19.020
And that's one of the things
that makes it a nice world

00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.680
to live in.

00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.380
You wouldn't want to live in
a world that's just rocks,

00:20:22.380 --> 00:20:24.400
for example.

00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.740
And it also highlights what's
a problem with this approach,

00:20:28.740 --> 00:20:31.170
is that the list isn't
really an answer.

00:20:31.170 --> 00:20:33.830
If you ask me, what is the
world made out of, Daniel?

00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:36.180
And I literally gave you
a list that had everything

00:20:36.180 --> 00:20:37.140
in the universe on it.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.060
That wouldn't really feel like
an answer to your question.

00:20:39.060 --> 00:20:41.101
It's like asking a teenager,
where are you going?

00:20:41.101 --> 00:20:42.130
And they say out.

00:20:42.130 --> 00:20:42.630
OK.

00:20:42.630 --> 00:20:43.504
Well, it's an answer.

00:20:43.504 --> 00:20:45.450
But it's not really an
answer to the question.

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.820
It's not a satisfying answer.

00:20:47.820 --> 00:20:50.070
So what kind of satisfying
answer would you like?

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:51.777
You'd like something
that reveals

00:20:51.777 --> 00:20:52.860
something about the world.

00:20:52.860 --> 00:20:56.190
Something that explains all
this incredible complexity

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.200
in terms of something simpler.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.526
You want to peel back
a layer of reality

00:21:00.526 --> 00:21:02.400
and reveal the simpler
set of building blocks

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.960
that explain all
of this complexity.

00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:06.190
So how do we do that?

00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:07.950
Well, we have this dumb list.

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:09.780
So let's try the
second-most dumb approach,

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:11.940
which is organize our list.

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:13.190
So we categorize things.

00:21:13.190 --> 00:21:16.385
And we say, well, this stuff
over here is all rock-like.

00:21:16.385 --> 00:21:18.010
And this stuff over
here is plant-like.

00:21:18.010 --> 00:21:20.970
And you can argue whether Arnold
belongs in the rock category

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:22.680
or the living thing category.

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:24.570
Everything belongs in
a category somewhere.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.460
We're scientists about it.

00:21:26.460 --> 00:21:28.510
And you start to
notice patterns.

00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:29.820
So you make a list.

00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:30.517
You organize it.

00:21:30.517 --> 00:21:31.350
You notice patterns.

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.210
You ask questions
about those patterns

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.010
because those patterns
are your clues.

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:39.300
They're the roadmaps that tell
you what's going on underneath.

00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:40.980
Why are there so many
rock-like things?

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:42.630
Why are these
things all similar?

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.111
There must be some
pattern there.

00:21:44.111 --> 00:21:44.610
OK.

00:21:44.610 --> 00:21:45.990
So we've done that.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:48.532
And fast forward a few hundred
years or a few thousand years,

00:21:48.532 --> 00:21:50.531
depending whether you
give the Greeks any credit

00:21:50.531 --> 00:21:51.660
for this kind of stuff.

00:21:51.660 --> 00:21:53.790
And you get to the periodic
table of the elements.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.457
And you guys might be
thinking, we're smart people.

00:21:56.457 --> 00:21:57.540
He's a particle physicist.

00:21:57.540 --> 00:21:59.520
Why are we talking about
high school chemistry?

00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.770
The periodic table is
high school chemistry.

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:03.420
Well, it is high
school chemistry.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:05.730
It's also, in my
view, one of the most

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:08.760
staggering achievements in
human intellectual history.

00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:09.540
Why?

00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:12.180
Because it's taken us from
an almost infinite complexity

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:15.372
of stuff, down to a
hundred building blocks.

00:22:15.372 --> 00:22:16.830
From those hundred
building blocks,

00:22:16.830 --> 00:22:20.040
you can make anything that
you've ever touched, or tasted,

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:22.230
or driven over, or anything.

00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:24.670
Anything any human has
ever interacted with,

00:22:24.670 --> 00:22:27.600
has been made out of these
hundred building blocks.

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:29.550
If our goal is to
simplify the universe

00:22:29.550 --> 00:22:32.190
or reveal a simpler
nature underneath,

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:34.530
this is a huge step
forward already.

00:22:34.530 --> 00:22:36.370
And this is hundreds
of years ago.

00:22:36.370 --> 00:22:37.860
So it's sort of incredible.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:40.237
And it makes you wonder,
like, why is it even possible?

00:22:40.237 --> 00:22:41.820
Why is it possible
that we live in it?

00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.500
Why do we live in
a universe where

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.780
it's possible to
describe complexity

00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:47.490
in terms of simple stuff?

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.630
It means something deep.

00:22:48.630 --> 00:22:50.310
It means that all
that complexity

00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:53.780
is in the arrangements, not
in the objects themselves.

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:55.360
It reminds me of something else.

00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.120
It's like the
universe is organized

00:22:57.120 --> 00:22:58.860
by the Lego principle.

00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:01.761
That out of a few basic building
blocks, you can build anything.

00:23:01.761 --> 00:23:03.510
You can use the same
basic building blocks

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:06.610
to build dinosaurs, or
to build the pirates,

00:23:06.610 --> 00:23:08.820
or like dinosaur-pirates.

00:23:08.820 --> 00:23:10.860
It's incredible that
anything can be made out

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.967
of these building blocks.

00:23:12.967 --> 00:23:14.550
And to me, it's
interesting because it

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.500
seems like if you were a cave
man, a cave woman physicist,

00:23:17.500 --> 00:23:19.990
you were asking this
question for the first time,

00:23:19.990 --> 00:23:21.690
you might consider
various options.

00:23:21.690 --> 00:23:24.180
Maybe the world is not made
out of basic building blocks.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:26.790
Maybe it's infinitely divisible
into smaller and smaller

00:23:26.790 --> 00:23:28.850
pieces, using an
infinitely sharp knife.

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:30.210
It could have been.

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:33.300
Or maybe, instead of having
a simple or a small set

00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:35.640
of building blocks, maybe
the number of building blocks

00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.061
could have mirrored
the number of things.

00:23:38.061 --> 00:23:39.810
And you could have,
for example, you know,

00:23:39.810 --> 00:23:42.840
cats made out of cat
particles, and cartoonists

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:45.000
made out of cartoon
particles, and llamas made out

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.850
of little llamalinos or whatever
you'd call those particles.

00:23:47.850 --> 00:23:49.164
That certainly could have been.

00:23:49.164 --> 00:23:51.330
And if you're the first
person to ask this question,

00:23:51.330 --> 00:23:53.190
you have to consider
every possible idea

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:56.880
because you have no rules
about how the universe works.

00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:58.410
But nothing that
you see around you

00:23:58.410 --> 00:24:00.810
is a basic building
block of the universe.

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:04.140
And we don't just list the
periodic table of the elements,

00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:05.404
and say we're done.

00:24:05.404 --> 00:24:07.320
So we don't just list
them and say we're done.

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.959
We organize our knowledge.

00:24:08.959 --> 00:24:11.250
So we group it into the
periodic table of the elements.

00:24:11.250 --> 00:24:12.910
After all, there
are patterns here.

00:24:12.910 --> 00:24:15.400
That's why we call it the
periodic table of the elements.

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:15.900
OK.

00:24:15.900 --> 00:24:18.358
I can see Jorge's getting bored
because he's playing Tetris

00:24:18.358 --> 00:24:19.890
here.

00:24:19.890 --> 00:24:21.120
But there are patterns here.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:25.680
And if our goal is to reveal
one more layer of truth,

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.042
to reveal the simpler
structure that underlies it,

00:24:28.042 --> 00:24:29.250
we have to look for patterns.

00:24:29.250 --> 00:24:30.690
And so, I'm not a chemist.

00:24:30.690 --> 00:24:32.670
But I know that in
the periodic table,

00:24:32.670 --> 00:24:34.800
these guys over here,
on the right side,

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:35.899
are not very active.

00:24:35.899 --> 00:24:38.190
And these guys over here, on
the left, are very active.

00:24:38.190 --> 00:24:41.220
In the middle, you have these
metals, and all sorts of stuff.

00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.440
And there are patterns
in the periodic table.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.540
And these patterns are,
in fact, the clues.

00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:48.122
They tell us what's
underneath the periodic table.

00:24:48.122 --> 00:24:50.580
And we know now, of course,
because we've taken high school

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.460
chemistry, that all the
patterns in the periodic tables

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.610
are just emergent phenomena
from the structure of the atom.

00:24:56.610 --> 00:24:59.670
They were, in fact, clues
that pointed us down to reveal

00:24:59.670 --> 00:25:01.770
what the nature of the atom was.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:04.560
And the reason that
these guys are noble,

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:07.020
and these guys are not
noble, and the metals are

00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:09.090
the way they are is
because of this structure.

00:25:09.090 --> 00:25:12.000
It's because the electrons
fill up their orbital shells

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:14.100
and don't like to
play games anymore.

00:25:14.100 --> 00:25:16.320
It's because the number
of protons in the atom

00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.180
determines the
element that you are.

00:25:18.180 --> 00:25:20.730
So all the chemical
properties are just

00:25:20.730 --> 00:25:24.050
clues that pointed to the
structure of the atom itself.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:25.770
And so we can look
to those clues

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:29.730
to tell us how to understand
a deeper level of reality,

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:32.670
down below the hula hoop level.

00:25:32.670 --> 00:25:35.280
But remember, as we're
exploring the universe,

00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:38.460
that nothing that you know is a
building block of the universe.

00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.890
Nothing you play with, the
chairs you're sitting on,

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:43.804
the llama you rode to
work on, the tornadoes,

00:25:43.804 --> 00:25:45.720
none of these things are
basic building blocks

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.386
of the universe.

00:25:46.386 --> 00:25:48.480
The universe is built
out of deeper, weirder,

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:52.350
strange things, that have
no analog in your life.

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:55.950
Not even strange combinations
of things, like llama tornadoes,

00:25:55.950 --> 00:25:58.340
can explain the way
the universe works.

00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:00.950
We like to use intuitive
ideas, like particles, which

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:03.470
are little spinning balls,
or waves, which we know about

00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:06.530
from things, or maybe light
is a particle and a wave.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.870
In reality, the basic building
blocks of the universe

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:10.490
are totally alien to us.

00:26:10.490 --> 00:26:12.920
We can try to understand
them using these analogies.

00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:15.065
But in the end, they
don't really work.

00:26:15.065 --> 00:26:15.647
OK.

00:26:15.647 --> 00:26:17.480
So let's zoom in a
little bit and understand

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.070
the current state of knowledge.

00:26:19.070 --> 00:26:21.170
We have the atom, which
has protons and neutrons,

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:24.200
with electrons whizzing
around it, of course.

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:26.317
And inside the proton
and neutron are quarks.

00:26:26.317 --> 00:26:28.150
So you have the up quark
and the down quark.

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:29.960
You put two up quarks
and a down quark

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.630
together to make a proton, two
down quarks and an up quark

00:26:32.630 --> 00:26:34.550
together to make a neutron.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:36.710
And that means something
sort of astounding.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.940
It means with just these three
particles, up quarks and down

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.380
quarks to make your
protons and neutrons,

00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:44.630
and then electrons
to complete the atom,

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.610
you can build any atom.

00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:49.670
Any atom can be built
out of three particles.

00:26:49.670 --> 00:26:51.410
And anything can be
built out of atoms,

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:53.360
which means anything
you've ever tasted,

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:55.640
or stepped on, or interacted
with can be made out

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.240
of just three particles.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:00.120
That's incredible
simplification,

00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:03.770
from infinite complexity,
down to three particles.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:06.607
It means the recipe for
building literally anything

00:27:06.607 --> 00:27:08.690
is a certain number of up
quarks, a certain number

00:27:08.690 --> 00:27:11.420
of down quarks, electrons, mix.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.250
That's literally the
recipe for everything.

00:27:13.250 --> 00:27:15.540
In terms of simplification,
that's pretty impressive.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:18.530
So you might be thinking,
wow, we went from infinity,

00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:20.270
to a hundred, to three.

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:22.550
We're like on the verge
of figuring this out.

00:27:22.550 --> 00:27:23.900
The trajectory is pretty good.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.580
If these guys had
come next week,

00:27:25.580 --> 00:27:29.030
could they be showing us the one
particle that rules them all?

00:27:29.030 --> 00:27:30.680
So we're not quite there.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:33.410
And the point of the
book is to explain to you

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.690
the wrinkles in this story
because the wrinkles are

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.490
really interesting.

00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:39.860
So first of all, one
wrinkle is we don't just

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.270
have these three particles.

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:42.590
We found these three particles.

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:44.530
But there are more particles.

00:27:44.530 --> 00:27:47.870
The up quark and the down quark
are two examples of quarks.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:49.500
But there are other quarks.

00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:54.080
There's the charm quark, the
strange quark, the top quark,

00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:55.180
and the bottom quark.

00:27:55.180 --> 00:27:56.982
I'm not making these names up.

00:27:56.982 --> 00:27:58.190
I wish somebody had asked me.

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:00.260
I would have come up
with even sillier names.

00:28:00.260 --> 00:28:03.440
The electron is an example of
a particle we call the lepton.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:05.990
And there's six
of those as well.

00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:08.810
So we have not just three
particles that make up matter.

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.460
We have these 12 particles
that we've discovered.

00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:13.460
So what do we do in science
when we're confused,

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:14.110
we don't know what to do?

00:28:14.110 --> 00:28:15.600
Well, first, we
just make a list.

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.210
Then we organize it.

00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:19.460
So now, the current
state of knowledge

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:21.380
is this, a new periodic table.

00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:24.170
It's a periodic table of
the fundamental particles.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:27.590
And what we try to do is place
all these particles in a table

00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:29.829
so we can understand
how they fit together.

00:28:29.829 --> 00:28:31.370
Maybe get some clues,
which will lead

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:33.770
us to ask questions,
that will reveal an even

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:36.240
deeper layer of the universe.

00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.210
So we have the up quark and
the down quark, which you know.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:40.905
These make the
protons and neutrons.

00:28:40.905 --> 00:28:43.280
Together with the electron,
they explain everyday matter.

00:28:43.280 --> 00:28:44.750
But in this first
column, we also

00:28:44.750 --> 00:28:46.910
include this particle
called the neutrino.

00:28:46.910 --> 00:28:50.270
Neutrinos are a really strange,
mysterious particle, sometimes

00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:52.049
called a subatomic particle.

00:28:52.049 --> 00:28:53.840
That's not really
accurate because it's not

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:55.729
inside the atom.

00:28:55.729 --> 00:28:57.020
But it's a mysterious particle.

00:28:57.020 --> 00:28:58.580
But it's also everywhere.

00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.670
For example, there are a
hundred billion neutrinos

00:29:01.670 --> 00:29:04.350
passing through my fingernail
every second, a hundred

00:29:04.350 --> 00:29:06.680
billion, and in your
fingernails as well.

00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:08.540
So why are we not, like,
getting beaten down

00:29:08.540 --> 00:29:11.120
by all of these neutrinos is
they pass right through us

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.080
without even noticing.

00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.130
We don't notice them.

00:29:13.130 --> 00:29:14.080
They don't notice us.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.560
It's like that guy who lives
down the hall from you,

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.101
you don't even like
make eye contact.

00:29:17.101 --> 00:29:17.840
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.010
Totally just pass right
through each other.

00:29:20.010 --> 00:29:21.170
So neutrinos ignore us.

00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:22.670
And we ignore them.

00:29:22.670 --> 00:29:24.860
There's so many
neutrinos because they're

00:29:24.860 --> 00:29:26.280
being produced by the Sun.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:28.280
But it's a clue that
a lot of the things

00:29:28.280 --> 00:29:30.627
that are happening in the
universe all around you,

00:29:30.627 --> 00:29:31.460
you're not privy to.

00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:32.330
You can't see you.

00:29:32.330 --> 00:29:33.680
You can't immediately detect.

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:35.600
The universe is different
from the universe

00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.100
that you experience.

00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.290
So we put all these
four in the same column.

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:42.440
And the interesting thing
about the 12 particles

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.770
is that they seem to be
copies of each other.

00:29:45.770 --> 00:29:48.040
So, for example, the charm
quark and the top quark,

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:50.900
we put them in the same
row as the up quark

00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:52.840
because they are
copies of the up quark.

00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:57.020
They have exactly the same
properties, the same charge,

00:29:57.020 --> 00:29:59.810
the same interactions,
the same spin.

00:29:59.810 --> 00:30:02.570
All of these things are
the same except the charm

00:30:02.570 --> 00:30:05.880
and the top are heavier
than the up quark.

00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:06.740
Why are they there?

00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:09.080
Why does the up quark have
these, like, weird two

00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:11.090
secret heavy cousins?

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:12.770
Nobody knows.

00:30:12.770 --> 00:30:14.960
The charm quark is much
heavier than the up quark.

00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:17.690
The top quark is the
heaviest fundamental particle

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:18.770
we've ever discovered.

00:30:18.770 --> 00:30:20.660
It's thousands and
thousands of times

00:30:20.660 --> 00:30:21.890
heavier than the up quark.

00:30:21.890 --> 00:30:24.246
It's like the up quark's
secret fat country cousin that

00:30:24.246 --> 00:30:25.370
can't even leave the house.

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:28.700
It's shin-nappingly
fat, this one.

00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:31.100
It's also easily offended.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:33.272
So the fascinating thing
is that not only are there

00:30:33.272 --> 00:30:34.730
two copies of the
up quark, there's

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.050
two copies of the down quark.

00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:38.510
The strange and the bottom
have the same relationship.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:40.370
They're perfect copies
of the down quark,

00:30:40.370 --> 00:30:43.550
all the same properties,
except heavier.

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:46.062
The electron also
has these copies.

00:30:46.062 --> 00:30:48.020
There's the muon, which
is just a heavy version

00:30:48.020 --> 00:30:48.740
of the electron.

00:30:48.740 --> 00:30:50.630
And then the tau, which
is an even heavier version

00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:51.170
of the muon.

00:30:51.170 --> 00:30:53.657
And there's even three
of these neutrinos.

00:30:53.657 --> 00:30:55.490
So we have these really
interesting patterns

00:30:55.490 --> 00:30:56.990
that form when you
start to organize

00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:58.460
our knowledge of
the periodic table

00:30:58.460 --> 00:30:59.990
of the fundamental particles.

00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:01.520
What does it mean?

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:03.590
Well, I hope that it
means that there's

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:04.880
something deeper going on.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:06.380
Currently, we have no idea.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:08.584
But we have some fun questions.

00:31:08.584 --> 00:31:09.875
The patterns give us questions.

00:31:09.875 --> 00:31:12.360
And we hope those questions
will lead us to the answers.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:12.860
OK.

00:31:12.860 --> 00:31:14.370
So what questions do we have?

00:31:14.370 --> 00:31:17.750
Well, question number one, why
do we have all these particles?

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:20.060
You only need three
to make all of matter.

00:31:20.060 --> 00:31:21.290
Why 12?

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:22.610
Are there, in fact, 12?

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:25.310
Are there 24, 24 billion?

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.022
According to theorists,
there's no limit

00:31:27.022 --> 00:31:28.730
on the number of
particles that you could

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:31.302
have in a fundamental theory.

00:31:31.302 --> 00:31:32.510
How many particles are there?

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:34.730
Why do the particles
each have two copies?

00:31:34.730 --> 00:31:37.160
To me, this is a really
interesting deep question

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.160
because I like
thinking about numbers.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:41.240
And one of the fundamental
goals of physics

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:43.910
is to explain the whole
universe in a simple equation.

00:31:43.910 --> 00:31:45.890
How do you know that when you're
done, when the equation is

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:47.840
simple enough, well, the
standard people often

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.957
use is if it could
fit on a T-shirt.

00:31:49.957 --> 00:31:52.040
If you can put all of
physics on a single T-shirt,

00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.240
then you're done.

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:54.441
Imagine we were there.

00:31:54.441 --> 00:31:55.940
And you're looking
at that equation.

00:31:55.940 --> 00:31:58.790
And there's a
number in it, five.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:32:01.730
That means that five is a
deep, important number somehow

00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:03.120
in the universe.

00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.534
So numbers are important.

00:32:04.534 --> 00:32:05.950
Now, we look at
this table, and we

00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:08.390
see there's three copies
of every particle.

00:32:08.390 --> 00:32:10.100
Why three?

00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:12.320
If you ask theorists
and mathematicians

00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:14.750
what kind of number do you
expect in a fundamental theory?

00:32:14.750 --> 00:32:16.490
Oh, they have strong opinions.

00:32:16.490 --> 00:32:18.500
Zero, that's an OK number, one.

00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.310
You can have pi.

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:20.930
Sure pi is a good number.

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:24.340
Nobody says three, unless
they're Catholic also.

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.920
Why is three?

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:29.960
Is the number three somehow
important to the universe?

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.900
It seems to me like either
it is or it's a clue.

00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:34.790
Than in a thousand years,
or a hundred years,

00:32:34.790 --> 00:32:36.373
people are going to
look back and say,

00:32:36.373 --> 00:32:38.810
that was such an obvious clue,
that blah blah, blah, blah,

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:39.890
blah, whatever secret
of the universe

00:32:39.890 --> 00:32:41.430
hasn't been revealed to us yet.

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:42.680
It's staring them in the face.

00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:44.420
If I had been a
physicist then, I totally

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:45.740
would have figured it out.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:47.150
It's one of those
screaming clues

00:32:47.150 --> 00:32:49.190
that we just don't know
what it means right now.

00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:51.440
We just know it's a clue.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:53.240
Another big mystery
about these particles

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.920
is the relationship
of the masses.

00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:56.660
We know that, in
general, they tend

00:32:56.660 --> 00:32:59.210
to have more mass as
you go this direction.

00:32:59.210 --> 00:33:01.122
But there's no
pattern to the masses.

00:33:01.122 --> 00:33:03.080
The Higgs boson, if you
know anything about it,

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:05.330
explains how the
particles get mass.

00:33:05.330 --> 00:33:06.890
But it doesn't tell
you why this one

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:08.990
got a lot of mass and
this one got almost none.

00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:11.880
There's no explanation
for that at all.

00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:13.460
And the ratios are crazy.

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.074
The top quark is
thousands of times

00:33:15.074 --> 00:33:16.740
heavier than any of
the other particles.

00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:19.100
It's really strange.

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.140
But one of my favorite
ones is this one

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:23.100
about the charges
of the particles.

00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:26.510
So the electron is charge
minus 1, sort of by definition.

00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.390
But the quarks have these really
strange fractional charges,

00:33:29.390 --> 00:33:31.550
like 2/3, minus 1/3.

00:33:31.550 --> 00:33:33.919
How is that even possible,
a fractional charge?

00:33:33.919 --> 00:33:35.710
Well, that's just
because of how you define

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:37.340
the charge of the electron.

00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:39.650
But the interesting thing
is about the ratios.

00:33:39.650 --> 00:33:42.200
These guys add
up, 2/3, 2/3, 1/3,

00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.870
to make plus 1, a
proton, which perfectly

00:33:44.870 --> 00:33:46.502
balances the electron.

00:33:46.502 --> 00:33:47.960
Well, that's
convenient because you

00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:50.690
need that exact balance
to have neutral atoms,

00:33:50.690 --> 00:33:53.030
and to have physics, and
chemistry, and biology,

00:33:53.030 --> 00:33:55.550
and silly physics books,
and free lunch in the cafe.

00:33:55.550 --> 00:33:59.450
All that stuff rests on
this perfect balance.

00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:03.260
But in our theory, that's
a perfect coincidence.

00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:05.802
We have two knobs in the theory,
the charge of the electron

00:34:05.802 --> 00:34:07.010
and the charge of the quarks.

00:34:07.010 --> 00:34:09.592
And if you're at the control
panel of the universe,

00:34:09.592 --> 00:34:11.300
you could set those
things to be anything

00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.489
and you still get a
valid theory of physics.

00:34:13.489 --> 00:34:15.500
So why do they
balance perfectly?

00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:17.600
Well, either it's
a huge monster,

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:20.719
cosmic-level coincidence,
and not a almost coincidence,

00:34:20.719 --> 00:34:23.420
like the Moon and the Sun
being the same size in the sky,

00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:27.920
so you get an eclipse, but a
perfect, exact coincidence.

00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:28.790
That's strange.

00:34:28.790 --> 00:34:29.614
That's a clue.

00:34:29.614 --> 00:34:31.489
But in our current theory
we say, no, there's

00:34:31.489 --> 00:34:34.280
no relationship, two
arbitrary numbers.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.860
To me, it's possible that
there's a simpler explanation.

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.780
That these things are
actually built out

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:41.120
of the same smaller
set of LEGO blocks,

00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:43.940
which would explain why
they have a perfect balance

00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.139
in their charges.

00:34:45.139 --> 00:34:48.973
But currently, we have no
idea that explanation is.

00:34:48.973 --> 00:34:51.139
And we don't just like
thinking about the particles.

00:34:51.139 --> 00:34:52.130
We also like thinking
about how they

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:53.960
talk to each other,
the forces they

00:34:53.960 --> 00:34:55.790
feel when they come into play.

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:59.000
And before Jorge was
the favorite cartoonist

00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:01.109
for particle physicists,
we had Richard Feynman,

00:35:01.109 --> 00:35:02.900
who came up with the
Feynman diagrams, sort

00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:05.322
of a cartoony way of
thinking about physics.

00:35:05.322 --> 00:35:07.280
And he thought about the
way particles interact

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:09.344
with each other by
drawing these diagrams.

00:35:09.344 --> 00:35:11.260
And so the straight lines
are particles moving

00:35:11.260 --> 00:35:12.740
and the wiggly
lines are particles

00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:14.170
talking to each other.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:16.700
And we can use his
calculations and this strategy

00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.529
to predict the results
of experiments.

00:35:18.529 --> 00:35:20.570
And if you've ever worked
in an experimental lab,

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:22.520
you know that if you predict
an experimental result,

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:24.660
and you get something like a
factor of 2, you're like, wow,

00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:25.360
it worked.

00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.952
Science, yeah, it's amazing.

00:35:26.952 --> 00:35:28.910
Well, we can predict the
results of experiments

00:35:28.910 --> 00:35:30.950
and get the results
to agree with a theory

00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:33.400
to 10 decimal places.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.336
10 decimal places, it's
incredible precision.

00:35:36.336 --> 00:35:38.210
So the theory we have
about how the particles

00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:40.732
talk to each other
works super-duper well.

00:35:40.732 --> 00:35:43.190
It almost makes you think, if
you're a conspiracy theorist,

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:45.320
that, like, maybe we are
living in a simulation

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:48.530
and we've, like, uncovered the
source code of the universe.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:50.540
Maybe this is how
the universe does

00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:53.947
the calculations to decide what
an electron is supposed to do.

00:35:53.947 --> 00:35:55.530
Because this doesn't
happen by random,

00:35:55.530 --> 00:35:57.080
that you get this
level of agreement.

00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.830
By random chance, it
would be like hitting

00:35:58.830 --> 00:36:01.440
a golf ball in New York and
getting a hole in one in China.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:03.480
It just doesn't
happen by chance.

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:05.880
But we don't measure
our particle theory just

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:07.355
by how well does
it work, like does

00:36:07.355 --> 00:36:08.480
it predict the experiments?

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:10.296
Remember, we want a
really simple theory.

00:36:10.296 --> 00:36:11.670
We want to simplify
the universe.

00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:13.740
So let me show you the
current state of the art

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:15.556
in thinking in particle physics.

00:36:15.556 --> 00:36:16.430
This is the Lagrange.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:19.470
And it describes the standard
model of particle physics, OK.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:23.430
And in my estimation, it doesn't
quite yet fit on a T-shirt.

00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:27.232
In fact, only half of the
terms could fit on the screen.

00:36:27.232 --> 00:36:28.440
So we're not quite there yet.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.050
We have a lot of questions left
about how these particles talk

00:36:31.050 --> 00:36:33.641
to each other.

00:36:33.641 --> 00:36:35.140
But that's not the
end of the story.

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:37.210
That's not even the biggest
problem in particle physics.

00:36:37.210 --> 00:36:39.126
So first, I want you to
go away with a feeling

00:36:39.126 --> 00:36:41.520
like, wow, there are a deep
basic questions about how

00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:43.830
particles work
that we don't know.

00:36:43.830 --> 00:36:45.880
We're standing-- we've
made a lot of progress.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.710
But we're staring
into the abyss.

00:36:47.710 --> 00:36:49.260
And we feel like in
a thousand years,

00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.900
people will look back and think,
wow, those things were really

00:36:51.900 --> 00:36:54.000
obvious, or I wish
they knew this,

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.137
or how could they not
have figured that out?

00:36:56.137 --> 00:36:57.720
Well, it turns out
all those questions

00:36:57.720 --> 00:36:59.715
are a tiny fraction
of the questions

00:36:59.715 --> 00:37:01.186
that we have about the universe.

00:37:01.186 --> 00:37:03.060
Because the particles
I've introduced you to,

00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:05.143
and the everyday matter
that you're familiar with,

00:37:05.143 --> 00:37:07.200
and everything that
makes up me, and you,

00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:10.440
and hamsters, and stars,
and dust, and planets

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:13.950
only accounts for a tiny
fraction of the universe.

00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:16.110
All of that effort
understanding matter

00:37:16.110 --> 00:37:19.470
only explains a little sliver
of what the universe is actually

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:20.880
made out of.

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:23.940
So all that great
progress, divided by 20.

00:37:23.940 --> 00:37:26.460
So it turns out that
only 5% of the universe

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:28.800
is this kind of stuff.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.430
So we've measured very
precisely the fraction of stuff

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.780
in the universe that's
our kind of stuff.

00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:35.700
And that's 5%.

00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:37.367
The rest of it is a big mystery.

00:37:37.367 --> 00:37:38.950
The rest of the stuff
in the universe,

00:37:38.950 --> 00:37:42.030
we don't really have any idea
what this kind of stuff is.

00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:44.280
So it's an incredible
moment in physics,

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.250
a moment I call precision
ignorance, when we've measured

00:37:47.250 --> 00:37:49.590
very precisely
that we don't know

00:37:49.590 --> 00:37:50.820
very much about the universe.

00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:52.140
And that's exciting
because it means

00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:53.970
we have a lot of things
left to discover.

00:37:53.970 --> 00:37:56.039
So how is it possible
that we could

00:37:56.039 --> 00:37:58.080
know that we know very
little about the universe?

00:37:58.080 --> 00:37:59.700
How does that exactly work?

00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.590
Well, let me tell you
a little bit about it.

00:38:01.590 --> 00:38:05.220
The first part of the story
begins with galaxies spinning.

00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:08.010
So somebody sent their grad
student out to look at galaxies

00:38:08.010 --> 00:38:09.674
and understand how they spin.

00:38:09.674 --> 00:38:11.340
And if you want to
think about galaxies,

00:38:11.340 --> 00:38:13.830
a good model is to think
about a marry-go-round,

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:15.556
with a bunch of ping
pong balls on it.

00:38:15.556 --> 00:38:17.430
What happens if you spin
that merry-go-round?

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:18.888
Well, the ping pong
balls are going

00:38:18.888 --> 00:38:22.680
to fly all out unless there's
some force holding them in.

00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:24.780
So in the case of galaxies,
that force is gravity.

00:38:24.780 --> 00:38:27.160
It keeps all the
stars from flying out

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.061
of the edge of the galaxy.

00:38:29.061 --> 00:38:30.810
So you can do something
interesting, which

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.930
is measure how fast
the galaxy is spinning

00:38:33.930 --> 00:38:36.250
and then count up all
the stars and ask,

00:38:36.250 --> 00:38:39.480
is there enough gravity to
keep all the stars in based

00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:40.860
on how fast they're spinning?

00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:42.690
So somebody sent their
grad student off.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:44.773
Make sure this works, make
these two measurements,

00:38:44.773 --> 00:38:45.810
make sure they agree.

00:38:45.810 --> 00:38:49.120
And what they discovered is that
the galaxies are spinning much,

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:51.930
much faster than they
should be able to.

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.570
Galaxies spinning that fast
should be throwing their stars

00:38:54.570 --> 00:38:56.550
out into space all
the time because there

00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:58.920
isn't nearly enough gravity
to hold them in when

00:38:58.920 --> 00:39:00.540
they're spinning that quickly.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.210
This is a really perplexing
result. For a long time,

00:39:03.210 --> 00:39:04.840
people don't understand
it and thought,

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.256
well, maybe you mismeasured
how the galaxies are spinning,

00:39:07.256 --> 00:39:10.452
or you miscounted the stars,
or something is crazy.

00:39:10.452 --> 00:39:12.160
And then eventually
people thought, well,

00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:15.000
maybe there's something
else in those galaxies.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:17.910
Maybe there's some sort
of new invisible thing,

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:21.390
because we don't see it, that
has a lot of gravity to it.

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:24.040
So you need something that's
invisible and has gravity.

00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.873
So they called it--
they don't what it was--

00:39:25.873 --> 00:39:27.600
but they called it dark matter.

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.090
And literally, dark matter
is the name of the theory.

00:39:30.090 --> 00:39:32.430
It's also a summary of
what we know about it.

00:39:32.430 --> 00:39:34.260
It's dark and it has matter.

00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.240
And that's basically
what we know.

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.200
That's the idea.

00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:40.010
It also was the problem
it was trying to solve,

00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:42.540
like there must be some
sort of dark mattery stuff

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:45.150
to explain all of this.

00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:47.100
So it was a big mystery
for a long time.

00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.080
But if you postulate
the existence

00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:51.720
of a huge amount of invisible
matter in these galaxies,

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.270
it explains why they're
spinning so fast.

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:56.280
But to understand how
dark matter is dark,

00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:57.930
we have to spend
a moment thinking

00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:59.760
about how particles interact.

00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:02.380
So we say dark matter is dark
because it doesn't give off

00:40:02.380 --> 00:40:02.880
light.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:05.700
It doesn't reflect light,
the way planets and stars do.

00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:07.800
That means it doesn't feel
electromagnetism, which

00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:10.410
is one of the four fundamental
forces responsible-- the one

00:40:10.410 --> 00:40:11.810
responsible for light.

00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:14.411
There's also gravity, which
anything that has mass

00:40:14.411 --> 00:40:15.160
will feel gravity.

00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:16.482
It will attract itself.

00:40:16.482 --> 00:40:17.940
Then there's the
weak nuclear force

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.230
and the strong
nuclear force, which

00:40:19.230 --> 00:40:21.300
are responsible for holding
the nucleus together

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:23.440
and also radioactive decay.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:25.420
So when we talk
about dark matter,

00:40:25.420 --> 00:40:28.034
we know that dark matter
fuels gravity because that's

00:40:28.034 --> 00:40:28.950
how it was discovered.

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:31.860
It basically explains
the extra gravity

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:33.990
we need for the
galaxies to rotate.

00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:36.390
We know it doesn't
feel electromagnetism.

00:40:36.390 --> 00:40:38.880
Because if it did, then
we would have seen it.

00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:40.290
It doesn't feel the weak force.

00:40:40.290 --> 00:40:42.120
And it doesn't feel
the strong force.

00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:43.620
And as far as we
know, dark matter

00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:45.994
doesn't feel any other
kind of force at all.

00:40:45.994 --> 00:40:47.910
We've been trying to
interact with dark matter

00:40:47.910 --> 00:40:49.410
in lots of ways.

00:40:49.410 --> 00:40:52.919
But it never seems to respond,
even to our Facebook requests.

00:40:52.919 --> 00:40:55.210
All we know about dark matter
is that it feels gravity.

00:40:55.210 --> 00:40:57.320
It's sort of defined
to be the thing that

00:40:57.320 --> 00:41:00.380
gives the extra gravity.

00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:04.067
And so 5% of the universe
is the stuff we know,

00:41:04.067 --> 00:41:05.900
that we still have a
lot of questions about.

00:41:05.900 --> 00:41:07.550
The fascinating thing
about dark matter

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:09.890
is that you need a
lot of it to explain

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:11.150
how the galaxies are spinning.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:13.394
It's not like, oh,
you need 1% or 2%.

00:41:13.394 --> 00:41:14.810
It's a little bit
of a correction.

00:41:14.810 --> 00:41:16.700
It's a mammoth correction.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:19.640
You have to multiply the amount
of matter in all the stars

00:41:19.640 --> 00:41:22.040
by a factor of five
to get enough gravity

00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:24.980
to explain how rapidly
these galaxies are spinning.

00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:27.320
It's a crazy idea.

00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.110
When we think of a new physics
theory, we like simplicity.

00:41:30.110 --> 00:41:32.630
Think of the simplest theory
that explains your data.

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:35.329
Well, if your theory
requires an immense amount

00:41:35.329 --> 00:41:37.370
of invisible matter, that
permeates the universe,

00:41:37.370 --> 00:41:39.160
that nobody's ever
discovered before, well, then

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.210
maybe you go back and
check your calculations

00:41:41.210 --> 00:41:42.459
before you get that published.

00:41:42.459 --> 00:41:44.210
And it took people a
long time to accept

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:46.020
the idea of dark matter.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:48.020
In fact, it wasn't until
people found other ways

00:41:48.020 --> 00:41:50.311
to see dark matter that they
really became convinced it

00:41:50.311 --> 00:41:52.280
was a thing and not a mistake.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.500
One really cool way
to see dark matter

00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:57.110
is to see it acting
as a lens in the sky.

00:41:57.110 --> 00:41:58.550
So dark matter is
invisible, which

00:41:58.550 --> 00:41:59.990
means light passes through it.

00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:01.160
But it has mass.

00:42:01.160 --> 00:42:02.870
So it bends space.

00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:05.960
And it can bend light as
well, acting like a lens.

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.470
So imagine there's a huge
blob of invisible dark matter

00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:12.290
between you and some
far, far away galaxy.

00:42:12.290 --> 00:42:14.300
What happens to photons
leaving that galaxy?

00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:17.180
Well, a photon zooming
off in one direction

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:20.420
will get bent towards you
by this blob of dark matter.

00:42:20.420 --> 00:42:22.790
A photon zooming off
in another direction

00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:24.649
also gets bent towards you.

00:42:24.649 --> 00:42:26.690
So what happens if you
look out in the sky in two

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:27.590
different directions?

00:42:27.590 --> 00:42:31.610
You see the same galaxy
at two places in the sky.

00:42:31.610 --> 00:42:34.237
It looks just like a lens is
acting somewhere in the sky.

00:42:34.237 --> 00:42:35.945
In fact, it's more
than just duplication.

00:42:35.945 --> 00:42:37.970
It actually gets
distorted, all sorts

00:42:37.970 --> 00:42:39.980
of interesting optical
effects, just like you

00:42:39.980 --> 00:42:41.109
would expect from a lens.

00:42:41.109 --> 00:42:42.650
You can Google-image
search it later.

00:42:42.650 --> 00:42:43.483
It's pretty awesome.

00:42:43.483 --> 00:42:45.410
It's called
gravitational lensing.

00:42:45.410 --> 00:42:47.284
And when people saw
this, they thought, well,

00:42:47.284 --> 00:42:49.370
there must be some invisible
stuff out there that

00:42:49.370 --> 00:42:51.050
really does have gravity to it.

00:42:51.050 --> 00:42:54.080
It's pretty spectacular
discoveries.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:56.160
And the last bit came
from a collision.

00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:57.415
Now, I'm a particle physicist.

00:42:57.415 --> 00:42:58.790
So when I want to
solve a problem

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:01.090
or understand something,
I smash stuff together.

00:43:01.090 --> 00:43:03.110
That's like my modus operandi.

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.270
Collide particles together,
look to understand

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:06.272
what's inside them.

00:43:06.272 --> 00:43:07.730
If you want to
understand galaxies,

00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:09.500
that approach
doesn't really work.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:11.208
You can't say, like,
go to the government

00:43:11.208 --> 00:43:14.120
and say I want funding to
build a galaxy collider.

00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.369
Even these days, we don't have
enough funding for science.

00:43:18.369 --> 00:43:20.910
So we can't use all the science
funding on a galaxy collider.

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:23.040
So an astrophysicist has
a different approach.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:26.000
Instead of building a collider,
they just look out into space

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:28.280
and hope to find this
experiment already happening.

00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.020
And fortunately, they found one.

00:43:30.020 --> 00:43:32.720
So the Bullet Cluster
is a mammoth cluster

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:36.900
of two-- a mammoth collision
of two clusters of galaxies.

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:40.070
So a cluster of galaxies has
both normal matter and dark

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:40.880
matter in it.

00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:44.240
So what happens when these two
things slammed into each other?

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:46.302
Well, the normal matter
smashed into itself,

00:43:46.302 --> 00:43:48.260
just like you'd expect
when two planets collide

00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:49.680
in science fiction movies.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.270
Boom, boom.

00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:51.920
Everybody runs away.

00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:55.220
But the dark matter passes
right through the normal matter.

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:55.970
It's invisible.

00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:58.444
It's also untouchable,
the way neutrinos are.

00:43:58.444 --> 00:44:00.110
And it passes through
the normal matter.

00:44:00.110 --> 00:44:02.420
It also passes through itself.

00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:04.977
So it just passed through
itself to the other side.

00:44:04.977 --> 00:44:06.560
So you get dark
matter on either side.

00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.559
And in the middle, you
have these big explosions

00:44:08.559 --> 00:44:09.410
from normal matter.

00:44:09.410 --> 00:44:10.868
That's really cool
because it means

00:44:10.868 --> 00:44:13.480
that the normal matter was
separated from the dark matter.

00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.110
And you can use
gravitational lensing

00:44:15.110 --> 00:44:18.320
to see directly that
the dark matter is there

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:20.300
and the normal matter
is still in the center.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.049
So this is a way you
can separate the two.

00:44:22.049 --> 00:44:24.810
You see that dark matter
really is its own thing.

00:44:24.810 --> 00:44:27.200
It's not just a weird
miscalculation of gravity

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.270
or a new theory of
gravity for normal matter.

00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:32.790
It's its own new kind
of invisible stuff.

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:34.506
So the Bullet Cluster
really was the nail

00:44:34.506 --> 00:44:36.380
in the coffin for all
the other theories that

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:37.839
tried to explain dark matter.

00:44:37.839 --> 00:44:40.130
It convinced people that dark
matter really is a thing.

00:44:40.130 --> 00:44:42.170
It's really out there.

00:44:42.170 --> 00:44:44.930
So what is dark matter?

00:44:44.930 --> 00:44:46.610
We know that it's dark.

00:44:46.610 --> 00:44:47.660
We know that it's matter.

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.010
We know there's a lot of it.

00:44:49.010 --> 00:44:51.270
That mostly sums
up what we think.

00:44:51.270 --> 00:44:52.440
We don't know what it is.

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.980
We know there's more of it
than our kind of matter.

00:44:54.980 --> 00:44:56.630
Now, we're particle physics.

00:44:56.630 --> 00:44:58.220
So our work is this.

00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:00.500
So our natural inclination
is to explain the unknown

00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:01.536
in terms of the known.

00:45:01.536 --> 00:45:03.410
So, for example, one of
the favorite theories

00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:05.752
about what is dark matter
is, well, maybe dark matter

00:45:05.752 --> 00:45:07.460
is made out of particles,
just like we're

00:45:07.460 --> 00:45:09.020
made out of particles.

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:11.840
And the favorite theory is
called a weakly interacting

00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:14.750
massive particle, WIMP.

00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:16.250
That's one of the
favorite theories.

00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:18.800
Another one is, well, maybe
it's these big blobs of matter

00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.580
out into space.

00:45:19.580 --> 00:45:23.060
It's called a massive
astrophysical compact halo

00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:23.990
object.

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:26.270
That theory is called the MACHO.

00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:29.240
So even in science, we have
the WIMPs versus the MACHOs.

00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:30.110
These are two ideas.

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:31.790
But they're sort
of extrapolations

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:33.410
from what we know.

00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:34.790
And it's dangerous
to extrapolate

00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:38.450
to a quarter of the universe
from a tiny, probably atypical

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:40.920
sliver that you've been
studying for hundreds of years.

00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:42.254
So we should keep that in mind.

00:45:42.254 --> 00:45:43.670
And the other thing
to remember is

00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:46.427
that dark matter isn't
out there in the universe.

00:45:46.427 --> 00:45:47.510
Dark matter is everywhere.

00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:49.490
Dark matter is
here in this room.

00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:51.696
I have dark matter in
my hands right now.

00:45:51.696 --> 00:45:52.820
It passes right through us.

00:45:52.820 --> 00:45:54.650
I can't hold it or contain it.

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:55.850
But it's here with us.

00:45:55.850 --> 00:45:58.100
It's not like out
there somewhere.

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:01.310
Maybe dark matter is a
totally new kind of matter.

00:46:01.310 --> 00:46:03.320
Maybe it's not even
made out of particles.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:06.320
Or maybe it's made out of a
whole new kind of particles,

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:08.820
the way we are, many
different kinds of particles.

00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:11.810
So maybe there's complex dark
matter physics, and dark matter

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:14.240
chemistry, dark matter biology.

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.910
For all we know, there could
be dark matter life right here

00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:18.530
in this room with us.

00:46:18.530 --> 00:46:20.180
And if you were
dark matter life,

00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.390
you wouldn't think of
us as normal matter.

00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:24.440
We're the little sliver
of 5% you could almost

00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:27.110
round away in your
understanding of the universe.

00:46:27.110 --> 00:46:29.690
In some dark matter physics
class is a professor saying,

00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:31.580
yeah, we understand
96% of the universe

00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.080
except for this
little weird sliver.

00:46:35.810 --> 00:46:38.570
So maybe there are
dark matter tourists.

00:46:38.570 --> 00:46:41.950
So 5% of the universe is
explained by the particles

00:46:41.950 --> 00:46:43.090
we have some clue about.

00:46:43.090 --> 00:46:46.340
27% of the universe
is dark matter.

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:47.370
We know it's there.

00:46:47.370 --> 00:46:48.830
We don't know very
much about it.

00:46:48.830 --> 00:46:52.610
That still leaves 2/3 of the
universe's budget totally

00:46:52.610 --> 00:46:54.170
unaccounted for.

00:46:54.170 --> 00:46:56.280
No accounting firm is
going to accept that.

00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.249
So what is the rest of this pie?

00:46:58.249 --> 00:47:00.290
Well, the rest of this
pie is filled by something

00:47:00.290 --> 00:47:02.480
called dark energy.

00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:04.220
But dark energy is
really science code

00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:06.620
for "we are totally
clueless about the rest

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:07.560
of the universe."

00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:09.810
Because the truth is,
and until 20 years ago,

00:47:09.810 --> 00:47:13.310
we didn't even know that we
were clueless about this part.

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:14.360
Now, don't be confused.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:16.610
Dark energy and dark
matter have no relationship

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:18.450
other than literally
the word "dark."

00:47:18.450 --> 00:47:18.950
OK.

00:47:18.950 --> 00:47:21.890
That's the only connection
between the two theories.

00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:23.450
So how did people
even figure out

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:25.220
that dark energy was a thing?

00:47:25.220 --> 00:47:28.365
Well, people were thinking about
the history of the universe.

00:47:28.365 --> 00:47:29.990
So if you know
something about physics,

00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:32.450
here's a brief summary of
the history of the universe.

00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:34.940
So first, you had the Big Bang.

00:47:34.940 --> 00:47:37.790
And all the stuff in the
universe exploded out.

00:47:37.790 --> 00:47:39.770
And then interesting
stuff happened.

00:47:39.770 --> 00:47:42.090
And people were wondering
what's going to come next?

00:47:42.090 --> 00:47:44.780
So is there enough
gravity in the stuff

00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:47.750
in the universe for
things to slow down, turn

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:51.130
around, and then come
back into a Big Crunch?

00:47:51.130 --> 00:47:52.580
That was one
possible explanation

00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:54.620
for the history
of the universe--

00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:55.795
the future of the universe.

00:47:55.795 --> 00:47:57.170
Another possibility
is that there

00:47:57.170 --> 00:48:00.020
wasn't enough stuff in the
initial explosion, not enough

00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:02.140
gravity to turn things around.

00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:04.310
It would just drift
out gradually,

00:48:04.310 --> 00:48:07.705
slowing down, cooling off,
until the universe cools off

00:48:07.705 --> 00:48:09.830
and spreads out into
something known affectionately

00:48:09.830 --> 00:48:12.390
as the heat death
of the universe.

00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:14.314
OK, not a cozy time.

00:48:14.314 --> 00:48:15.980
But these were the
two possible theories

00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:18.313
that people were considering,
the Big Crunch or the heat

00:48:18.313 --> 00:48:20.059
death of the universe.

00:48:20.059 --> 00:48:21.600
So they said, well,
let's measure it.

00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.870
Let's go out and look, see
if things are speeding up

00:48:23.870 --> 00:48:27.000
or see how much things
are slowing down.

00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:29.750
So it turns out the universe
preferred secret option

00:48:29.750 --> 00:48:32.022
C, which is neither
of these ideas.

00:48:32.022 --> 00:48:33.980
Which, to me, is like
the best case in science,

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:35.840
when you discover
something that nobody

00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.347
expected to be the answer.

00:48:37.347 --> 00:48:38.930
So they went out and
they measured it.

00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:41.090
And they discovered that
actually what's happening

00:48:41.090 --> 00:48:42.890
is that it's not
slowing down at all.

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:44.870
It's expanding
faster and faster.

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:47.780
It's accelerating
in its expansion.

00:48:47.780 --> 00:48:48.800
That's crazy.

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:51.320
Nobody even thought
about that as an idea

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.350
because to accelerate
the size of the universe

00:48:54.350 --> 00:48:55.970
requires some sort
of force, which

00:48:55.970 --> 00:48:57.380
requires some sort of energy.

00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:58.838
And the amount of
energy that would

00:48:58.838 --> 00:49:01.190
required, well, maybe
like 2/3 of all the energy

00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:02.340
in the universe.

00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:03.800
That would be totally crazy.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.510
And, in fact, that's
what's happening.

00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:07.314
And we have no idea why.

00:49:07.314 --> 00:49:08.480
We know that it's happening.

00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.140
We measured it.

00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:11.780
And we see that the universe
is expanding faster and faster

00:49:11.780 --> 00:49:12.630
every year.

00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:13.940
We just don't know why.

00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:17.510
What could possibly be
responsible for pushing

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:18.980
galaxies away from each other?

00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:22.490
I mean galaxies are heavy,
hundreds of billions

00:49:22.490 --> 00:49:23.300
of stars in them.

00:49:23.300 --> 00:49:25.250
Stars are not tiny objects.

00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:28.220
What could be responsible for
pushing all of these galaxies

00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.720
apart from each other?

00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:30.980
We have no idea.

00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:33.290
Which means that we have
no idea whether it's

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:35.623
going to turn around, or
whether it's going to continue,

00:49:35.623 --> 00:49:37.100
or whether it's
going to increase.

00:49:37.100 --> 00:49:40.130
But there's a fascinating
consequence to it.

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:42.230
The space between us
and other galaxies

00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:47.160
is growing at faster than
light can traverse that space.

00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.210
What does that mean?

00:49:48.210 --> 00:49:50.293
It means that these galaxies
are going to move out

00:49:50.293 --> 00:49:53.060
beyond our visible horizon.

00:49:53.060 --> 00:49:55.070
So every year that you
look up at the night sky,

00:49:55.070 --> 00:49:57.590
it's going to get darker,
and darker, and darker.

00:49:57.590 --> 00:50:01.520
So imagine doing astrophysics
in 10 billion years,

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:04.420
if human civilization
survives the next three years,

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:06.130
or until the next election.

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:06.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:08.171
So imagine in 10
billion years, we're

00:50:08.171 --> 00:50:09.890
trying to rebuild
human astrophysics.

00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:11.473
And people are looking
up into the sky

00:50:11.473 --> 00:50:13.370
and wondering where is
everything or is there

00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:14.330
anything out there?

00:50:14.330 --> 00:50:16.970
They could be looking up
into a totally black sky,

00:50:16.970 --> 00:50:19.820
in which case they would have
no clue about how things work.

00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.680
All the critical
information that we

00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:23.570
learn from looking
at the stars, they

00:50:23.570 --> 00:50:25.200
will be totally ignorant of.

00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.749
Now, before you feel, like, too
great about the fact that we

00:50:27.749 --> 00:50:30.290
are living now and we can use
the stars to help us understand

00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:34.760
the universe, remember we're 14
billion years into the history

00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:36.230
of the universe already.

00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:38.420
If we had evolved 10
billion years ago,

00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:39.920
and looked up at
the night sky then,

00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:43.160
what would it have revealed
to us that's now totally gone

00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.390
and lost forever?

00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:47.300
Well, we have no idea.

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:51.745
So the future of the universe is
something we don't understand.

00:50:51.745 --> 00:50:53.120
It's not something
we can predict

00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:56.230
because we have no understanding
of the mechanism by which

00:50:56.230 --> 00:50:58.000
the universe is expanding.

00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.220
And it's only recently
that we've even understood

00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:02.020
that it is expanding.

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:04.510
So that's why I say we're at
a special moment in physics

00:51:04.510 --> 00:51:08.020
because we very recently figured
out exactly how little we know

00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:10.930
about the universe, which means
that we have an opportunity

00:51:10.930 --> 00:51:13.270
to learn something about it.

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:14.980
So here's a pie
chart to summarize

00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:16.840
our knowledge of the universe.

00:51:16.840 --> 00:51:19.030
Most of the universe
is something we just

00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:20.350
don't understand at all.

00:51:20.350 --> 00:51:22.420
We label it dark energy
so we can write grants

00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:23.860
about it that sound cool.

00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:26.170
But really, we have no
clue what this thing is.

00:51:26.170 --> 00:51:27.045
There are some ideas.

00:51:27.045 --> 00:51:29.086
People have come up with
theoretical explanations

00:51:29.086 --> 00:51:30.670
for what dark energy might be.

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:32.200
And they do calculations.

00:51:32.200 --> 00:51:34.090
And they compare
those to what we see.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:37.522
And they're off
by 10 to the 100.

00:51:37.522 --> 00:51:39.980
There's only, like, 10 to the
80 particles in the universe.

00:51:39.980 --> 00:51:43.980
So 10 to 100 is a
huge, huge mistake.

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:46.480
27% of the universe
is dark matter.

00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:48.230
Something, we know it's there.

00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:49.300
We know it's matter.

00:51:49.300 --> 00:51:50.770
We don't know really
anything else about it.

00:51:50.770 --> 00:51:51.480
Is it one particle?

00:51:51.480 --> 00:51:52.310
Is it lots of particles?

00:51:52.310 --> 00:51:53.830
Is it something
else, totally weird?

00:51:53.830 --> 00:51:55.120
We don't know.

00:51:55.120 --> 00:51:58.120
The rest of the universe,
this little corner, this 5%,

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:00.850
the et cetera part of
the universe, that's me,

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:02.990
and you, and ice
cream, and bicycles.

00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:07.130
We're really the little
bits of the universe.

00:52:07.130 --> 00:52:09.370
And so you might
think, well, how

00:52:09.370 --> 00:52:12.250
are we in making progress in
understanding this question

00:52:12.250 --> 00:52:13.380
about what is the universe?

00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:15.340
Well, it's sort of
like imagine somebody

00:52:15.340 --> 00:52:16.950
told you to
understand elephants.

00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:19.900
Then you spent 300 years
only studying the tail,

00:52:19.900 --> 00:52:22.702
not even realizing there
was more to the story.

00:52:22.702 --> 00:52:24.160
And then one day,
finally, somebody

00:52:24.160 --> 00:52:24.880
walks around to the front.

00:52:24.880 --> 00:52:26.588
Like, excuse me, maybe
you want to, like,

00:52:26.588 --> 00:52:28.510
look at the rest
of the elephant.

00:52:28.510 --> 00:52:29.930
Well, what are you going
to do in that situation?

00:52:29.930 --> 00:52:32.096
How are you going to feel
confident in understanding

00:52:32.096 --> 00:52:33.294
the rest of the elephant?

00:52:33.294 --> 00:52:35.210
Well, what you're probably
going to do is say,

00:52:35.210 --> 00:52:36.710
well, maybe the
rest of the elephant

00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:38.500
is made out of tails also.

00:52:38.500 --> 00:52:40.630
Or like, I can
describe the elephant

00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:43.420
as a linear combination of
tails that I already understand.

00:52:43.420 --> 00:52:46.060
Because you're get to cling to
the theories you know, right.

00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:47.737
Well, you might think
that's ridiculous.

00:52:47.737 --> 00:52:48.320
That's absurd.

00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.440
It's obviously a
stupid thing to do.

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.810
That's exactly the same
argument I made 10 minutes ago

00:52:52.810 --> 00:52:54.250
about dark matter.

00:52:54.250 --> 00:52:56.710
Maybe dark matter is also
made out of particles

00:52:56.710 --> 00:52:58.330
because that's all we know.

00:52:58.330 --> 00:53:00.600
So we should be careful in
extrapolating our knowledge

00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.230
to the rest of the universe.

00:53:02.230 --> 00:53:05.170
It's a great tendency in physics
to extrapolate from the known

00:53:05.170 --> 00:53:05.950
into the unknown.

00:53:05.950 --> 00:53:08.110
But it's also dangerous
when you're extrapolating

00:53:08.110 --> 00:53:10.510
from an unrepresentive sliver.

00:53:10.510 --> 00:53:12.060
So I don't mean
to be depressing.

00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:14.200
What I mean to do
is to encourage

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.157
you to think about the kind
of things we might be thinking

00:53:17.157 --> 00:53:17.990
about in the future.

00:53:17.990 --> 00:53:20.079
Because it's a special
moment of physics

00:53:20.079 --> 00:53:22.120
when you realize that you
don't know very little.

00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.597
It's a chance you
have to reboot.

00:53:23.597 --> 00:53:25.930
To throw away everything you
thought you knew and think,

00:53:25.930 --> 00:53:27.040
you know what,
maybe we're looking

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:28.420
at a unrepresentative slice.

00:53:28.420 --> 00:53:31.284
We need to come up with
some crazy new ideas.

00:53:31.284 --> 00:53:33.700
It's those moments when you
know you know very little that

00:53:33.700 --> 00:53:35.710
give you the opportunity
to totally, like,

00:53:35.710 --> 00:53:37.540
come up with something
completely new, that

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:39.340
could blow your mind.

00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:42.220
And in 200 years,
or in 500 years,

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:44.560
children's books
about the universe

00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:47.330
will contain facts
that, to us, are crazy,

00:53:47.330 --> 00:53:49.030
that we wouldn't even believe.

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:51.070
Imagine giving this
talk to Isaac Newton,

00:53:51.070 --> 00:53:54.065
a staggering genius in the
history of human physics.

00:53:54.065 --> 00:53:55.690
He had no idea about
any of this stuff.

00:53:55.690 --> 00:53:57.430
And it would totally
blow his mind.

00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:59.560
How can we take anything
he said seriously?

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:02.050
He had no clue about
the cosmic situation.

00:54:02.050 --> 00:54:04.270
The way we think about
primitive cave men

00:54:04.270 --> 00:54:06.880
is the way future scientists
will think about us.

00:54:06.880 --> 00:54:09.220
At least we know that
we don't know very much

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:12.330
about the universe, which
gives us a heads-up or a way

00:54:12.330 --> 00:54:13.732
to get started.

00:54:13.732 --> 00:54:16.190
So we know that we don't know
very much about the universe.

00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:20.110
However, it is an exciting time
because, at the same time as we

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:21.730
know that we're
clueless, we're also

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:24.610
building awesome new tools to
help us solve these mysteries.

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:26.300
So we have the Large
Hadron Collider.

00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:28.270
And it smashes
particles together,

00:54:28.270 --> 00:54:29.860
to try to see
what's inside them.

00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:32.640
We have the gravitational
wave observatories,

00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.600
that can see ripples
in space and time

00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:37.070
and black holes colliding
billions of years ago,

00:54:37.070 --> 00:54:38.290
which is pretty awesome.

00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:40.187
We have space
telescopes, which can

00:54:40.187 --> 00:54:42.520
help us look back into the
early moments of the universe

00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:44.978
and figure out these questions
about how things got started

00:54:44.978 --> 00:54:47.200
or what happened
before the Big Bang?

00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:50.100
Hopefully, in the future, we'll
have even cooler technologies,

00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:54.120
maybe given to us by
our alien friends.

00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.890
I like to think that this is
an amazing period in physics.

00:54:56.890 --> 00:54:59.796
That in the next five years,
or 10 years, or 15 years,

00:54:59.796 --> 00:55:01.420
we will make some of
these discoveries,

00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:02.920
answer some of these questions.

00:55:02.920 --> 00:55:05.980
And it will really
be a turning point

00:55:05.980 --> 00:55:07.092
in the history of physics.

00:55:07.092 --> 00:55:09.550
I hope that in a hundred years
people think back and think,

00:55:09.550 --> 00:55:11.380
wow, I wish I had
been a physicist back

00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:13.600
in 2020, when they really
figured out whatever it

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.808
is we're about to figure out.

00:55:14.808 --> 00:55:18.040
I like to think about the
discovery of quantum mechanics,

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:19.630
all those experiments
people did over

00:55:19.630 --> 00:55:21.079
like the course
of 10 years or so.

00:55:21.079 --> 00:55:22.870
People just sat down,
and thought about it,

00:55:22.870 --> 00:55:23.690
and figured it out.

00:55:23.690 --> 00:55:26.410
And it revealed what the true
nature of the universe was.

00:55:26.410 --> 00:55:28.540
And I sometimes think, if
I had been around then,

00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:30.589
I totally would've
figured it out.

00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:33.130
But when you're standing in the
forefront of human knowledge,

00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:35.370
not knowing which
direction to go,

00:55:35.370 --> 00:55:37.750
any of these possible
crazy ideas could be true.

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:40.420
It's not easy to know
which direction is correct.

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:42.050
So in hindsight, it
might be obvious.

00:55:42.050 --> 00:55:45.520
But here we are, not knowing
much about the universe.

00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:47.770
So to round out our
tour of silly charts

00:55:47.770 --> 00:55:50.350
about the universe,
and to impress on you

00:55:50.350 --> 00:55:53.170
how little we understand
about the universe,

00:55:53.170 --> 00:55:54.940
this bit here is dark energy.

00:55:54.940 --> 00:55:57.180
Most of the universe is
something totally not

00:55:57.180 --> 00:55:58.980
understandable to us.

00:55:58.980 --> 00:56:00.240
This bit here is dark matter.

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:02.198
It's something-- we're
pretty sure it's matter.

00:56:02.198 --> 00:56:03.490
But that's about all we know.

00:56:03.490 --> 00:56:07.480
And this little bit is me,
you, and dark chocolate.

00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:10.290
And so in our book, we talk
about this one question,

00:56:10.290 --> 00:56:11.970
what is the universe
made out of?

00:56:11.970 --> 00:56:14.400
Because it's one of these
deep and ancient questions

00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.770
that we think can be answered
and will be answered.

00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:18.330
And when it is,
we'll change the way

00:56:18.330 --> 00:56:19.590
we think about the universe.

00:56:19.590 --> 00:56:21.131
But there are lots
of these questions

00:56:21.131 --> 00:56:24.900
in science, big, deep, ancient
questions, with answers.

00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.810
Questions like, what
happened before the Big Bang?

00:56:27.810 --> 00:56:29.670
Nobody knows the answer
to that question.

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:32.370
Even the early moments of the
Big Bang are still a mystery.

00:56:32.370 --> 00:56:35.407
Or even more basic questions,
like what is space?

00:56:35.407 --> 00:56:36.990
You might think,
well, that's obvious.

00:56:36.990 --> 00:56:38.190
Space is emptiness.

00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:41.250
It's just the abstract backdrop
on which things happen.

00:56:41.250 --> 00:56:43.447
Well, we know now
that that's not true

00:56:43.447 --> 00:56:45.030
because we know that
space can expand.

00:56:45.030 --> 00:56:46.650
We know space can bend.

00:56:46.650 --> 00:56:49.680
Space can even ripple.

00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:50.820
Emptiness cannot ripple.

00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:52.350
So space is not just emptiness.

00:56:52.350 --> 00:56:54.120
It's a thing that we live in.

00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:56.044
It's like as if we
were fish, and we've

00:56:56.044 --> 00:56:57.960
been swimming in water
for thousands of years,

00:56:57.960 --> 00:56:59.709
not even realizing
that water was a thing.

00:56:59.709 --> 00:57:02.477
We just thought it was
the thing we were in.

00:57:02.477 --> 00:57:04.560
And then you discover, oh,
it's a dynamical thing,

00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.860
with properties.

00:57:05.860 --> 00:57:06.830
Space is like that.

00:57:06.830 --> 00:57:08.460
It might even have
strange phases

00:57:08.460 --> 00:57:09.746
that we haven't even explored.

00:57:09.746 --> 00:57:11.370
We don't know basic
things about space,

00:57:11.370 --> 00:57:13.320
like how many
dimensions are there?

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:15.470
Well, there's three that
we're familiar with.

00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:18.006
But string theory
predicts 11 or 26.

00:57:18.006 --> 00:57:20.130
And there's lots of ways
that there could be extra,

00:57:20.130 --> 00:57:21.780
little curled up
loops of dimensions

00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:23.370
that we're not
even familiar with.

00:57:23.370 --> 00:57:26.670
So really basic ancient
questions about the universe

00:57:26.670 --> 00:57:27.760
have not been answered.

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:31.180
But they have answers, these
answers that can be revealed.

00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:33.630
So we talk about all
those in the book.

00:57:33.630 --> 00:57:36.330
And the point of our book
and the presentation today

00:57:36.330 --> 00:57:38.850
is not to convince you that
science doesn't know anything.

00:57:38.850 --> 00:57:41.670
It's to show you that science
will make great discoveries

00:57:41.670 --> 00:57:43.920
in the future and to
prepare you for those

00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.870
by introducing you to our
cosmic level of ignorance.

00:57:46.870 --> 00:57:49.648
So thanks very much
for your attention.

00:57:49.648 --> 00:57:51.576
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:57.370 --> 00:58:00.014
SPEAKER: So we're right up at
the end of our allotted time.

00:58:00.014 --> 00:58:01.930
But I think we can take
a couple of questions,

00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:02.950
if anyone has any.

00:58:02.950 --> 00:58:04.630
And then afterwards,
Daniel and Jorge

00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:07.155
have been kind enough
to do a book signing.

00:58:07.155 --> 00:58:08.530
DANIEL WHITESON:
And stick around

00:58:08.530 --> 00:58:11.408
and answer any other
crazy questions you have.

00:58:11.408 --> 00:58:12.074
SPEAKER: Anyone?

00:58:20.511 --> 00:58:21.010
No one?

00:58:21.010 --> 00:58:22.260
DANIEL WHITESON: No questions?

00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:23.040
Oh, here we go.

00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:24.456
AUDIENCE: Here are
some questions.

00:58:24.456 --> 00:58:26.989
SPEAKER: Just a moment.

00:58:26.989 --> 00:58:27.530
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:28.946
Thanks for giving
us a great talk.

00:58:28.946 --> 00:58:30.450
Are there any
questions in this book

00:58:30.450 --> 00:58:31.991
that you would have
liked to explore,

00:58:31.991 --> 00:58:33.634
but did not manage
to fit in the book?

00:58:33.634 --> 00:58:34.550
DANIEL WHITESON: Yeah.

00:58:34.550 --> 00:58:36.290
There are a lot of
questions that we

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:37.873
don't have the answer
to, that we also

00:58:37.873 --> 00:58:39.470
didn't talk about in the book.

00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:42.105
In the book, we tried to
limit ourselves to questions

00:58:42.105 --> 00:58:43.730
that we thought people
could understand

00:58:43.730 --> 00:58:45.320
without any
scientific background,

00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.120
like simple, deep questions.

00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:48.835
For example, a lot
of people ask us

00:58:48.835 --> 00:58:50.960
why didn't you talk about
the mysteries of neutrino

00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.357
oscillations in the book?

00:58:52.357 --> 00:58:53.690
Well, neutrinos are interesting.

00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:56.570
But it takes-- it's like a
20-minute explanation for why

00:58:56.570 --> 00:58:57.740
they're interesting.

00:58:57.740 --> 00:59:00.864
So we tried to focus on things
that were very accessible.

00:59:00.864 --> 00:59:02.780
But there are other
things, like the mysteries

00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:06.550
of quantum mechanics, that
would take a whole other book.

00:59:06.550 --> 00:59:07.940
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:09.990
JORGE CHAM: So stay
tuned for our next book.

00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:11.270
We still have no idea.

00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:18.487
AUDIENCE: Which ones are
your favorites, individually?

00:59:18.487 --> 00:59:20.320
DANIEL WHITESON: I think
one of my favorites

00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:21.970
is the question
of what is space?

00:59:21.970 --> 00:59:25.120
Because it's not a question you
hear a lot of people even ask.

00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:27.712
But I think it's a really
deep and important question.

00:59:27.712 --> 00:59:29.170
I really liked
writing that chapter

00:59:29.170 --> 00:59:31.060
because I like thinking
about what space was.

00:59:31.060 --> 00:59:33.899
When I first heard about, like,
space expanding, I was like,

00:59:33.899 --> 00:59:34.940
what does that even mean?

00:59:34.940 --> 00:59:37.720
It's like I understand
each word individually.

00:59:37.720 --> 00:59:40.900
But together, it's like
it doesn't make any sense.

00:59:40.900 --> 00:59:43.390
So it's once you liberate
yourself from the idea

00:59:43.390 --> 00:59:45.494
that space is an abstract
idea and discover

00:59:45.494 --> 00:59:47.410
that it's a physical
thing, that you can think

00:59:47.410 --> 00:59:49.210
about how changes and moves.

00:59:49.210 --> 00:59:51.480
It's a totally new way of
thinking about the universe.

00:59:51.480 --> 00:59:54.700
That was my favorite one.

00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:56.665
JORGE CHAM: My
favorite is chapter 13.

00:59:56.665 --> 01:00:00.370
If you get the book, it's
a very special chapter.

01:00:00.370 --> 01:00:00.970
But no.

01:00:00.970 --> 01:00:03.970
There's also a chapter I
really liked about cosmic rays.

01:00:03.970 --> 01:00:08.380
And I like it because it's a
very, very specific mystery.

01:00:08.380 --> 01:00:10.840
Like Daniel mentioned, we're
being bombarded by particles

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.230
all the time.

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:14.837
And especially they are
interesting because they're

01:00:14.837 --> 01:00:16.420
super, super-high
energy, like they're

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.120
super-duper high energy.

01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.779
We're being shot at
by these particles.

01:00:19.779 --> 01:00:21.820
And nobody really knows
where they're coming from

01:00:21.820 --> 01:00:23.980
or what could be making them.

01:00:23.980 --> 01:00:26.140
Like, there's no
process in nature,

01:00:26.140 --> 01:00:30.250
or astrophysics, or physics that
scientists know about, or could

01:00:30.250 --> 01:00:33.460
even imagine, could be producing
these super-high energy

01:00:33.460 --> 01:00:34.730
particles.

01:00:34.730 --> 01:00:36.700
And so the possibilities
are, like, insane.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.310
Like, there could be
something totally new thing

01:00:39.310 --> 01:00:41.650
in the universe nobody
has ever seen before.

01:00:41.650 --> 01:00:43.530
Or it could be, like,
aliens shooting at us.

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:48.194
So it's a pretty cool mystery.

01:00:58.919 --> 01:00:59.460
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:00.720
Thank you for the talk.

01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:04.040
Wasn't there a theory
that our universe

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.010
starts with a Big Bang.

01:01:05.010 --> 01:01:05.800
Then it crunches.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.620
And then Big Bang again.

01:01:07.620 --> 01:01:10.560
And what happened to that
theory if we're expanding now?

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:11.100
DANIEL WHITESON: Great question.

01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:11.670
Yeah.

01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:14.610
So there was a theory, the
sort of cyclical universe,

01:01:14.610 --> 01:01:18.030
Big Bang, Big Crunch,
Big Bang, Big Crunch.

01:01:18.030 --> 01:01:20.400
That theory is less popular
now because of dark energy.

01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:23.310
Because we know the universe
is expanding like crazy.

01:01:23.310 --> 01:01:27.014
But we don't know what dark
energy holds for the future.

01:01:27.014 --> 01:01:28.680
Dark energy, for
example, only turned on

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.790
about 5 billion years ago.

01:01:30.790 --> 01:01:32.640
So for a long time,
the universe was just

01:01:32.640 --> 01:01:34.410
sort of coasting
and slowing down.

01:01:34.410 --> 01:01:35.327
And then it turned on.

01:01:35.327 --> 01:01:36.868
What's going to
happen in the future?

01:01:36.868 --> 01:01:38.760
It might turn around
and make a Big Crunch.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:40.890
So a Big Crunch is
still a possibility.

01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:43.950
In fact, there's a theory of
spacetime called loop quantum

01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:46.320
gravity, that says
that maybe all of space

01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:48.510
is pixelated on this
tiny, tiny scale.

01:01:48.510 --> 01:01:50.550
And it specifically
predicts a Big Crunch.

01:01:50.550 --> 01:01:53.070
So the short answer is a Big
Crunch might still happen,

01:01:53.070 --> 01:01:54.362
but nowhere in the near future.

01:01:54.362 --> 01:01:55.361
So don't worry about it.

01:01:55.361 --> 01:01:57.300
And you still have to
pay next year's taxes.

01:01:57.300 --> 01:01:59.220
[LAUGHTER]

01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.060
But we know dark energy
is such a mystery.

01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:02.700
We can't predict
what's going to happen

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.033
because we don't understand
the mechanism for it at all.

01:02:10.325 --> 01:02:10.950
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:02:10.950 --> 01:02:12.075
Thanks for doing this talk.

01:02:12.075 --> 01:02:13.380
This is awesome.

01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:14.970
So I think it's
superimportant to have

01:02:14.970 --> 01:02:17.214
entertaining, accessible
examples of science,

01:02:17.214 --> 01:02:18.630
especially for,
like, young people

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:20.850
to get them interested in
STEM and things like that.

01:02:20.850 --> 01:02:24.300
Are there other resources or
organizations that you know of

01:02:24.300 --> 01:02:25.830
and that you support,
that you think

01:02:25.830 --> 01:02:30.540
are really good to point
to or to support monetarily

01:02:30.540 --> 01:02:32.370
or otherwise, things like that?

01:02:32.370 --> 01:02:35.020
DANIEL WHITESON: Well, first,
buy 10 copies of the book.

01:02:35.020 --> 01:02:39.670
JORGE CHAM: And gave them
to young kids or teenagers.

01:02:39.670 --> 01:02:41.800
DANIEL WHITESON:
It's a good question.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.240
I agree that science
communication is important.

01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:49.710
And, in fact, it was Goggle
that partially inspired this

01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:51.690
because I was reading--

01:02:51.690 --> 01:02:54.540
Google put out a science
comic, a technical comic,

01:02:54.540 --> 01:02:56.700
about the development
of the Chrome browser.

01:02:56.700 --> 01:02:57.941
Scott McCloud did it.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:02:59.690
And you know, like,
how to write a browser

01:02:59.690 --> 01:03:03.480
is not like going to be the top
selling story on "The New York

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.260
Times."

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:06.180
But it was a really
compelling comic.

01:03:06.180 --> 01:03:08.221
It was really well done
in terms of communicating

01:03:08.221 --> 01:03:09.150
something technical.

01:03:09.150 --> 01:03:10.650
So I'm seeing more
and more of this,

01:03:10.650 --> 01:03:14.470
like collaborations between
scientists and artists.

01:03:14.470 --> 01:03:17.250
And I think not all scientists
are good communicators, which

01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:17.794
is fine.

01:03:17.794 --> 01:03:19.460
You don't have to be
good at everything.

01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:20.580
But the important
thing is to pair up

01:03:20.580 --> 01:03:22.310
with somebody who's
a good communicator

01:03:22.310 --> 01:03:23.470
and has artistic skills.

01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:25.470
And I hope to see more
of that in the future.

01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:31.302
In terms of supporting those
causes, it's a good question.

01:03:31.302 --> 01:03:32.010
JORGE CHAM: Yeah.

01:03:32.010 --> 01:03:33.880
There's a bunch of,
like, YouTube channels

01:03:33.880 --> 01:03:36.030
that are really
good at explaining

01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:37.250
science and things like that.

01:03:37.250 --> 01:03:40.050
And there's a lot of comic
artists online doing it also.

01:03:40.050 --> 01:03:43.050
I think that what Daniel
was saying, that I agree

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:45.460
with a lot, is the idea that--

01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:48.210
I mean, you guys are the ones
kind of making this technology

01:03:48.210 --> 01:03:52.830
and pushing the boundaries of
science and in engineering.

01:03:52.830 --> 01:03:57.000
And so I really like the idea
of people in those positions

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.520
kind of taking the initiative,
to not just do the research,

01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:02.160
but also think
creatively and figure out

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:05.449
new ways to communicate
this stuff out to people.

01:04:05.449 --> 01:04:06.990
I mean there's a
lot of examples now.

01:04:06.990 --> 01:04:08.970
But tomorrow,
somebody can come up

01:04:08.970 --> 01:04:12.390
with a totally different type
of collaboration or a way

01:04:12.390 --> 01:04:14.400
to communicate the stuff.

01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:18.920
DANIEL WHITESON: I saw a Higgs
boson dance performance once.

01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.670
I'm not sure I learned
much about science.

01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:21.913
But it was entertaining.

01:04:21.913 --> 01:04:23.392
[LAUGHTER]

01:04:34.250 --> 01:04:35.150
AUDIENCE: Hello.

01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:39.230
Are there any questions that you
cannot conceive of a possible

01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.920
answer to?

01:04:39.920 --> 01:04:43.891
So with dark energy, you
could start making up theories

01:04:43.891 --> 01:04:44.390
tomorrow.

01:04:44.390 --> 01:04:46.556
And none of them would be
particularly well-founded.

01:04:46.556 --> 01:04:47.990
They'd likely be wrong.

01:04:47.990 --> 01:04:52.040
But it seems to me, like,
you can conceive of what

01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:54.514
the answer might look like.

01:04:54.514 --> 01:04:56.430
Are there any questions
where that's not true?

01:04:56.430 --> 01:05:00.322
So for me, one maybe
is consciousness.

01:05:00.322 --> 01:05:01.280
DANIEL WHITESON: Right.

01:05:01.280 --> 01:05:02.363
So that's a very question.

01:05:02.363 --> 01:05:06.190
A lot of the times
we can speculate.

01:05:06.190 --> 01:05:08.760
But our speculation exceeds
the bounds of science.

01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.186
So one example is what
happened before the Big Bang?

01:05:12.186 --> 01:05:14.310
Well, it may be that all
the information about what

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:18.030
happened before the Big Bang
was destroyed in the Big Bang.

01:05:18.030 --> 01:05:20.460
We'll never know.

01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:22.669
One popular theory
of the Big Bang

01:05:22.669 --> 01:05:24.210
is that the Big Bang
was one of many.

01:05:24.210 --> 01:05:26.310
And is an infinite
number of universes

01:05:26.310 --> 01:05:29.391
that were all created, but now
are separated from each other,

01:05:29.391 --> 01:05:31.140
and are moving away
from each other faster

01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:32.140
than the speed of light.

01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.450
So we will never detect them.

01:05:33.450 --> 01:05:34.890
That kind of theory is fun.

01:05:34.890 --> 01:05:38.497
But it's basically philosophy
because you can't ever test it.

01:05:38.497 --> 01:05:40.080
So, yeah, there are
a lot of questions

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.650
like what happened
before the Big Bang,

01:05:41.650 --> 01:05:43.191
where we can have
ideas, but it's not

01:05:43.191 --> 01:05:45.090
clear we'll ever be
able to test them.

01:05:45.090 --> 01:05:47.940
However, science is
always moving forward.

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:50.815
And things that used to
be philosophy questions

01:05:50.815 --> 01:05:51.967
are now science questions.

01:05:51.967 --> 01:05:54.300
Because we've developed new
technologies, and new ideas,

01:05:54.300 --> 01:05:58.230
and new clever ways to
test these subtle theories.

01:05:58.230 --> 01:06:00.650
That question you raised,
what is consciousness,

01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:02.550
is sort of a
favorite one of mine.

01:06:02.550 --> 01:06:04.470
It's one that I think
will actually never

01:06:04.470 --> 01:06:09.150
be testable by science because
science assumes consciousness.

01:06:09.150 --> 01:06:12.300
And so you can never step
outside of it to probe that.

01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.527
But that's a whole other topic.

01:06:14.527 --> 01:06:16.475
That's a great question.

01:06:19.839 --> 01:06:20.380
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:06:20.380 --> 01:06:21.850
Thanks for the great talk.

01:06:21.850 --> 01:06:23.750
So I have a question about--

01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:26.550
so how do you think
software engineers

01:06:26.550 --> 01:06:28.370
can contribute to
perhaps answering

01:06:28.370 --> 01:06:29.370
some of these questions?

01:06:29.370 --> 01:06:31.770
And also, how do you
see machine learning

01:06:31.770 --> 01:06:33.390
coming into the picture?

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:35.200
DANIEL WHITESON: Wow,
a great question.

01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:37.770
We're doing a lot of machine
learning these days in particle

01:06:37.770 --> 01:06:41.310
physics and in astronomy because
we have larger and larger data

01:06:41.310 --> 01:06:43.834
sets and more and
more subtle signals.

01:06:43.834 --> 01:06:46.000
So actually, one of the
things I personally research

01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.900
is how to use machine learning
tools to solve particle physics

01:06:49.900 --> 01:06:50.850
problems?

01:06:50.850 --> 01:06:54.270
One thing you guys can do is
hire more particle physicists.

01:06:54.270 --> 01:06:56.700
For example, [INAUDIBLE]
here is one of my students.

01:06:56.700 --> 01:07:00.159
And he now works here at
Google, to make more connections

01:07:00.159 --> 01:07:01.200
between these two fields.

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:03.690
Because you guys have a
lot of awesome hammers.

01:07:03.690 --> 01:07:06.180
And I'm always frustrated
when I see, for example, like,

01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:09.780
oh, Facebook spent $100
million on this tool

01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:12.810
to identify somebody's
face in a picture.

01:07:12.810 --> 01:07:15.034
It's like so much money is
being spent on what seems

01:07:15.034 --> 01:07:16.200
to me like trivial problems.

01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:19.410
Like, is there a cat
in this internet video?

01:07:19.410 --> 01:07:21.300
So many PhD theses
have been written

01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:23.760
on that question, which is
like a great example of, like,

01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:24.980
a hard question.

01:07:24.980 --> 01:07:27.190
But, like, who cares?

01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:29.130
And we have hard questions
where we actually

01:07:29.130 --> 01:07:30.660
care about the answer.

01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:31.650
What is dark matter?

01:07:31.650 --> 01:07:34.470
Is this a Higgs
boson, yes or no?

01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:36.757
So just, like,
talk to scientists,

01:07:36.757 --> 01:07:39.090
try to get them to explain
their problem to you in terms

01:07:39.090 --> 01:07:41.290
of their language and
teach them your language.

01:07:41.290 --> 01:07:45.091
And I think you'll find a
lot of interesting overlap.

01:07:45.091 --> 01:07:46.840
JORGE CHAM: A cool
project is, do you want

01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.974
to tell them about CRAYFIS?

01:07:48.974 --> 01:07:49.890
DANIEL WHITESON: Yeah.

01:07:49.890 --> 01:07:52.050
So, for example, one
project I'm working on

01:07:52.050 --> 01:07:54.150
is trying to understand
these cosmic rays

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:57.900
by turning everybody's
smartphone into a particle

01:07:57.900 --> 01:07:58.890
detector.

01:07:58.890 --> 01:08:01.500
And then if you network all
of these smartphones together,

01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:04.440
you can build a
global-sized telescope,

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.570
which could look out
into space and see maybe

01:08:06.570 --> 01:08:08.340
where these cosmic
rays are coming from.

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:12.290
It's called CRAYFIS, Cosmic
rays found in smartphones.

01:08:12.290 --> 01:08:15.570
And we certainly need software
help for that project.

01:08:15.570 --> 01:08:19.670
So if you're really
interested, send me an email.

01:08:19.670 --> 01:08:21.420
AUDIENCE: Do you think
dark matter is more

01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:23.399
important than cats in videos?

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:24.510
DANIEL WHITESON: Do I
think dark matter is more

01:08:24.510 --> 01:08:25.859
important than cats in videos?

01:08:25.859 --> 01:08:28.100
JORGE CHAM: Maybe the dark
matter is cats in videos.

01:08:28.100 --> 01:08:28.620
DANIEL WHITESON: Yeah.

01:08:28.620 --> 01:08:30.750
I think cats know
something about dark matter

01:08:30.750 --> 01:08:32.045
they're not telling us.

01:08:32.045 --> 01:08:33.015
[LAUGHTER]

01:08:37.109 --> 01:08:37.650
AUDIENCE: Hi.

01:08:37.650 --> 01:08:41.510
It seems like every time
we get closer and closer

01:08:41.510 --> 01:08:43.100
in getting an
answer, it was like,

01:08:43.100 --> 01:08:44.399
oh, now we have dark matter.

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:45.529
And then it went away.

01:08:45.529 --> 01:08:48.109
Oh, now we have dark energy.

01:08:48.109 --> 01:08:50.684
Because now you have your
pie chart of 5% is us.

01:08:50.684 --> 01:08:52.850
But I wouldn't be surprised,
like 50 years from now,

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:55.160
oh, no, now we have
another dark thing.

01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:56.532
So dark power or whatever.

01:08:56.532 --> 01:08:57.490
JORGE CHAM: Dark power.

01:08:57.490 --> 01:08:58.050
AUDIENCE: Now, we know like--

01:08:58.050 --> 01:08:59.060
JORGE CHAM: The dark side.

01:08:59.060 --> 01:08:59.685
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:08:59.685 --> 01:09:01.819
So it was 0.1% of the universe.

01:09:01.819 --> 01:09:05.010
And so this is a question that
I don't think I have an answer.

01:09:05.010 --> 01:09:08.450
But do you expect that to
continue happening, especially

01:09:08.450 --> 01:09:09.640
also the other way around.

01:09:09.640 --> 01:09:11.020
So now we have three particles.

01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.260
But I wouldn't be surprised
that then we have one.

01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:16.720
And then, boom, a whole raft
of infinite new particles.

01:09:16.720 --> 01:09:20.516
And we have a new table of
fundamental, fundamental,

01:09:20.516 --> 01:09:21.620
fundamental particles.

01:09:21.620 --> 01:09:24.200
And we will go, like, all the
way to a rabbit hole, upwards

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:25.189
and downwards.

01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:27.069
DANIEL WHITESON: I
love your question.

01:09:27.069 --> 01:09:30.220
We address this question
specifically in the book.

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:32.000
The question is like,
could there ever

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.890
be a theory of
everything or could we

01:09:33.890 --> 01:09:35.670
ever understand the universe?

01:09:35.670 --> 01:09:39.939
So I hope not because I
like asking questions.

01:09:39.939 --> 01:09:44.479
But there are some
arguments that the universe

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.444
might have a smallest particle.

01:09:46.444 --> 01:09:49.080
So one way to interpret
your question might be,

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.855
could we ever drill down and
discover the smallest particle

01:09:51.855 --> 01:09:53.979
or is it just going to keep
going forever, smaller,

01:09:53.979 --> 01:09:55.580
and smaller, and
smaller particles?

01:09:55.580 --> 01:09:56.810
Well, we don't know.

01:09:56.810 --> 01:09:59.030
But there are some
arguments that suggest

01:09:59.030 --> 01:10:01.882
that the universe has a small--

01:10:01.882 --> 01:10:04.640
a distance scale beyond
which you can't measure.

01:10:04.640 --> 01:10:07.290
The universe is pixelated
at some smallest level.

01:10:07.290 --> 01:10:09.770
But there is an end to this.

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:11.360
The arguments are pretty weak.

01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:12.500
They go like this.

01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:14.330
If I take all these
numbers that I

01:10:14.330 --> 01:10:16.370
found about the universe,
the speed of light,

01:10:16.370 --> 01:10:19.327
Planck's constant, Newton's
gravitational constant,

01:10:19.327 --> 01:10:21.410
and I multiply them together
in this creative way,

01:10:21.410 --> 01:10:23.195
I get a number that
has units of distance.

01:10:25.700 --> 01:10:27.477
That's called the Planck length.

01:10:27.477 --> 01:10:28.310
What is that number?

01:10:28.310 --> 01:10:32.450
Well, it's 10 to the minus 35
meters, really, really small.

01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:34.490
Does that mean the
universe is pixelated?

01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:35.190
No.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:36.940
Does it mean if the
universe is pixelated,

01:10:36.940 --> 01:10:38.400
it's pixilated at that size?

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:39.350
No.

01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:41.280
But what do we do in science
when we don't know what to do?

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:42.390
We do the dumbest thing first.

01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:43.760
So that was the dumbest thing.

01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:45.260
So it's sort of a
hand-wavy argument

01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:48.110
that maybe at that scale,
or somewhere within a factor

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:49.940
of a million of that
scale, the universe

01:10:49.940 --> 01:10:52.280
might be pixillated
at the smallest level.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:55.970
But that scale is
10 to 15 smaller

01:10:55.970 --> 01:10:57.560
than what we can currently see.

01:10:57.560 --> 01:11:00.200
So we're really far away
from ever seeing that.

01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:02.930
I mean you'd have to build like
a solar-system-sized particle

01:11:02.930 --> 01:11:05.970
collider to study things
at that small scale.

01:11:05.970 --> 01:11:09.216
So I think it's likely that
the universe is pixelated,

01:11:09.216 --> 01:11:11.090
though I don't have any
hard evidence for it.

01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:13.140
And that eventually, we
could figure that out.

01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:15.697
But it's a long way from now.

01:11:15.697 --> 01:11:16.530
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

01:11:16.530 --> 01:11:18.965
DANIEL WHITESON: A
great question though.

01:11:18.965 --> 01:11:20.840
I mean even if we had
a theory of everything,

01:11:20.840 --> 01:11:22.880
the questions don't stop
because you guys asked, like,

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.380
why is there a three
in that theory?

01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:25.530
What does that mean?

01:11:25.530 --> 01:11:27.217
Then philosophy takes over.

01:11:27.217 --> 01:11:27.800
AUDIENCE: Hey.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:28.790
Thank you for the talk.

01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:29.445
It was awesome.

01:11:29.445 --> 01:11:30.570
DANIEL WHITESON: Thank you.

01:11:30.570 --> 01:11:31.694
AUDIENCE: A quick question.

01:11:31.694 --> 01:11:34.360
Don't you think first person
to see the Grand Canyon would

01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.230
have lived hundreds
of thousands of years

01:11:36.230 --> 01:11:37.940
ago, not a few hundred.

01:11:37.940 --> 01:11:39.740
DANIEL WHITESON: Yeah, probably.

01:11:39.740 --> 01:11:41.800
I mean 10 or 20
thousands of years ago,

01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.964
was the migration down
from the Bering Strait.

01:11:43.964 --> 01:11:46.130
AUDIENCE: But I have a
science related question too.

01:11:46.130 --> 01:11:48.770
What do you think we're
going to figure out

01:11:48.770 --> 01:11:50.770
first, dark matter
and dark energy

01:11:50.770 --> 01:11:54.650
or a unifying model of
gravity and electromagnetism?

01:11:54.650 --> 01:11:56.600
Do we need one for the other?

01:11:56.600 --> 01:11:57.520
What do you think?

01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.630
DANIEL WHITESON: Well,
that's a great question.

01:11:59.630 --> 01:12:03.050
We could figure out dark matter
anytime in the next few years.

01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:04.040
It's possible.

01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.880
We're looking for dark
matter very actively.

01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.380
We're trying to
create it in the lab

01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:09.560
by smashing particles together.

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:13.490
We have these big tanks of
heavy water underground, that

01:12:13.490 --> 01:12:14.810
are looking for dark matter.

01:12:14.810 --> 01:12:18.380
So we could discover it any at
Or we could keep looking for it

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:19.280
and not find it.

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.556
So dark matter is
the most likely thing

01:12:21.556 --> 01:12:23.180
to be discovered in
the next few years.

01:12:23.180 --> 01:12:25.160
But also, it could be decades.

01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:27.560
Dark energy, it's
pretty exciting

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.440
because it's such
a big question.

01:12:30.440 --> 01:12:33.740
And we can make progress on
that really unpredictably.

01:12:33.740 --> 01:12:35.270
It could be a long time.

01:12:35.270 --> 01:12:38.390
A unifying theory of gravity
and the other forces, people

01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:40.970
have been working
on that for decades

01:12:40.970 --> 01:12:42.435
and made very little progress.

01:12:42.435 --> 01:12:44.060
So I don't expect
that to be wrapped up

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:47.720
anytime soon, unless we
can visit a black hole

01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:49.040
and look inside of it.

01:12:49.040 --> 01:12:51.810
Because inside a black
hole is all the data

01:12:51.810 --> 01:12:54.350
we need to understand
why we don't have

01:12:54.350 --> 01:12:55.984
a quantum theory of gravity.

01:12:55.984 --> 01:12:57.650
If you've seen the
movie "Interstellar,"

01:12:57.650 --> 01:12:59.399
that part of that movie
was actually true.

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:06.200
JORGE CHAM: The rest,
we have no idea.

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:07.730
DANIEL WHITESON:
We have no idea.

01:13:07.730 --> 01:13:08.357
Great question.

01:13:08.357 --> 01:13:09.190
AUDIENCE: All right.

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:11.450
Well, I think we're going
to wrap up the Q&amp;A now.

01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:13.730
And then Daniel
and Jorge will be

01:13:13.730 --> 01:13:17.210
signing books and answering
any lingering questions

01:13:17.210 --> 01:13:19.194
for the next while.

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:20.610
DANIEL WHITESON:
Thanks everybody.

01:13:20.610 --> 01:13:21.235
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

01:13:21.235 --> 01:13:22.410
Thank you.

01:13:22.410 --> 01:13:24.860
