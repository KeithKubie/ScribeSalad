00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.420
We've got the inequality negative x times
the expression

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.664
2x minus 14 is greater than or equal to
24.

00:00:07.664 --> 00:00:09.710
So I encar, encourage you to pause this

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:11.942
video now and think about what the
solution

00:00:11.942 --> 00:00:14.360
set to this inequality would actually be,
and

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.990
actually plot the solution set on a number
line.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.860
So I'm assuming you've given a go at it,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.939
so let's just try to simplify this a
little bit.

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.899
So on the left hand side we could
distribute, we could

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.683
distribute this negative x, and so if we
did that we

00:00:29.683 --> 00:00:35.139
would get negative 2, negative 2x squared,
negative times a negative

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:39.669
is a positive, plus 14x is greater than or
equal to 24.

00:00:39.669 --> 00:00:43.629
Now I'm gonna put the, I'm gonna subtract
24 from both sides, just so that we just

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.386
have a 0 here and then we can think about
factoring what we have here on the left.

00:00:47.386 --> 00:00:52.090
So we have negative 2x squared, plus 14x,
I'm gonna subtract

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.122
24 from both sides, so it's minus 24 is
greater than

00:00:56.122 --> 00:01:00.322
or equal to, I've subtracted 24 from the
right as well,

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:03.940
so that's going to be greater than or
equal to 0.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:07.966
Now, I don't like, I don't like having
this negative 2 out front, so

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.398
what I wanna do is I wanna divide this
left hand side by negative

00:01:11.398 --> 00:01:15.160
2, but I can't just divide the left hand
side only by negative 2,

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.634
I have to do divide the right hand side by
negative 2 as well.

00:01:18.634 --> 00:01:21.914
And anytime I multiply or divide both
sides of an

00:01:21.914 --> 00:01:26.904
inequality by a negative number, it's
going to flip the inequality.

00:01:26.904 --> 00:01:32.121
So if I divide both sides by negative 2,
I'm going to be

00:01:32.121 --> 00:01:37.338
left with x squared, positive x squared
minus, so I'm

00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:42.358
dividing by negative 2, so minus 7x, plus
12.

00:01:42.358 --> 00:01:46.388
And now since I divided by negative 2, I'm
gonna flip this inequality,

00:01:46.388 --> 00:01:49.580
is less than or equal to zero divided by
negative 2 is 0.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.088
So that simplified things a good bit, and
now

00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:55.254
let's see if we can factor this quadratic
expression.

00:01:55.254 --> 00:01:59.797
So two numbers whose product is positive
12, so that means they're

00:01:59.797 --> 00:02:04.260
gonna have the same sign, and whose, and
whose sum is negative 7.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.040
So if they have the same sign, and their
sum is

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.590
negative 7, that tells us that they're
both going to be negative.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.710
And let's see, negative 3 and negative 4
seem to fit the bill.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.240
Their product is positive 12.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.000
Their sum is negative 7.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.740
So we could write this as x minus 3 times
x

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:26.630
minus 4, is going to be less than or equal
to 0.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.430
So now this is the point that we're gonna
do a little bit of interesting logic.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.820
If the product of two things is less than,
is less than or equal

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.580
to 0, what does that tell us, tell what do
we know about it?

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.170
Well, that tells us that either, either
one or

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.220
both of them is 0, or they have different
signs.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.220
The only way that you're gonna get less
than 0 is if one is

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.838
positive and the other is negative, or one
is negative and the other is positive.

00:02:52.838 --> 00:02:57.050
So our 1 is negative, is that they have
different signs.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.478
So let's write that down, let's write that
down.

00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:04.538
So either, either x minus 3, x minus 3 is
less than

00:03:04.538 --> 00:03:09.713
or, less than, either x minus 3 is less
than or equal

00:03:09.713 --> 00:03:15.118
to 0 and, and x minus 4 is greater than or
equal to 0, x

00:03:15.118 --> 00:03:20.523
minus 4 is greater than or equal to 0, so
notice, note

00:03:20.523 --> 00:03:25.583
this one is non positive, this one is non
negative,

00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:31.785
they're either equal to 0 or they are have
different signs.

00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:37.956
So that's one situation, or, or the other
way around, or x

00:03:37.956 --> 00:03:44.490
minus 3 is non negative, it's greater than
or equal to 0, and

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:51.070
x minus 4 is non positive, x minus 4 is
less than or equal to 0.

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.364
Once again, they're either zero or
different signs, that's all I'm

00:03:54.364 --> 00:03:57.527
doing with this little with this little
logic work right over here.

00:03:57.527 --> 00:04:00.504
So what are these, what is this, what is
this simplified to?

00:04:00.504 --> 00:04:03.780
So x minus 3 less than or equal to 0, add
3

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.730
to both sides, you get x is less than or
equal to 3.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.980
And, and x minus 4 is greater than or
equal to 0.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:19.230
If you add 4 to both sides of this, you
get x is greater than or equal to 4.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.860
So what values of x are going to be less
than

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.080
or equal to 3, and greater than or equal
to 4?

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.670
Well anything that's less than or equal to
3 is

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:30.210
not going to be greater than or equal to 4

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.670
and anything that's greater than or equal
to 4 is

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.220
not going to be less than or equal to 3.

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:38.140
So there's no x, there's no x value that
can satisfy

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:41.960
this situation right over here, there's no
X value that will

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:46.110
result in this one being negative, and
this one being, or

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.370
this one being non positive and this one
being non negative.

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.332
So let's go to this one right over here.

00:04:52.332 --> 00:04:58.542
So if we add 3 to both sides, we get x is
greater than or equal to 3

00:04:58.542 --> 00:05:05.231
and, and we get adding 4 to both sides, x
is less than or equal to 4.

00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:07.616
Now does this make sense, that something
could be greater than

00:05:07.616 --> 00:05:09.220
or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 4?

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.080
Sure, for example, well 3 is greater than
or equal

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.030
to 3 and is less than or equal to 4,

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:16.240
4 is greater than or equal to 3 and it's

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.928
less than or equal to 4 and anything in
between.

00:05:18.928 --> 00:05:20.769
So we can plot the solution set here.

00:05:20.769 --> 00:05:22.955
So this is actually all that matters.

00:05:22.955 --> 00:05:26.080
Cuz this one, there's no situation which
that would've been true.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.909
So this is the only thing, this is the

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.390
only thing that's gonna make this or part
true.

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:32.610
This part is always going to be false.

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.557
So if we wanted to make the solution set,
it would look something like this.

00:05:35.557 --> 00:05:38.940
So if this is our possible values of x.

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:45.060
So let's say that that is 0, so this is 1,
2, 3,

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:51.044
and 4, 3 and 4, 3 and 4, x could be
greater than

00:05:51.044 --> 00:05:57.149
or equal to 3, so it's greater than or
equal to 3.

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:00.920
But it's also let, it also has to be less
than

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.560
or equal to 4 so we can't just go all past
4.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.079
Also, less than or equal, less is since
it's, less than or

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:10.501
equal we can color in these dots, less
than or equal to 4.

00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:13.765
So anything in this range, including 3 and
4, that's why

00:06:13.765 --> 00:06:17.310
we circled in the dots, this would satisfy
this equation here.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.105
And if you wanted to think about it
visually, hey,

00:06:20.105 --> 00:06:22.705
you know we know that this type of thing,
we know

00:06:22.705 --> 00:06:25.565
that this type of thing, or this type of
thing, this

00:06:25.565 --> 00:06:29.480
type of thing right over here, these are,
these are parabola's.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.890
So how would that relate to this little
solution

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.760
set that we just thought about right over
here?

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:37.780
Well if you look at let's, let's just look
at one of these.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.180
Let's say we went to, let's say we went to
this form right over here.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:46.487
So all, everything we did, this is just
another way of thinking about

00:06:46.487 --> 00:06:51.026
negative 2x squared plus 14x minus 24 is
greater than or equal to 0.

00:06:51.026 --> 00:06:53.917
So this right over here, we have a
negative coefficient on

00:06:53.917 --> 00:06:57.900
the x squared term, that's going to be a
downward opening parabola.

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.915
So when is that greater than or equal to
0?

00:06:59.915 --> 00:07:01.451
So if, if we though about the

00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:04.651
downward opening parabola, it could might
look something

00:07:04.651 --> 00:07:06.827
like this, it might look something like

00:07:06.827 --> 00:07:09.377
this if we're now thinking in 2
dimensions.

00:07:09.377 --> 00:07:14.371
And this is the, this is the, if you think
of this as the Y axis right over here.

00:07:14.371 --> 00:07:16.179
So when is that greater than or equal to
0?

00:07:16.179 --> 00:07:19.189
Well it's greater than or equal to 0, it's
above

00:07:19.189 --> 00:07:21.915
the X axis in this range for x right over
here.

00:07:21.915 --> 00:07:23.833
So that's one way of thinking about it.

00:07:23.833 --> 00:07:26.313
If we though about it from the point of

00:07:26.313 --> 00:07:30.073
view, not of that parabola, not of that
parabola, but

00:07:30.073 --> 00:07:33.353
this parabola right over here, when is x
squared

00:07:33.353 --> 00:07:36.399
minus 7x plus 12 less than or equal to 0?

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:39.450
Well this is gonna be an up, upward
opening parabola.

00:07:39.450 --> 00:07:43.720
So if it has a positive coefficient here,
so this problem might look something like

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.602
this, might look something like this, when
is it less than or equal to 0?

00:07:47.602 --> 00:07:52.570
Well once again, once again it's less than
or equal to 0 in that same range.
