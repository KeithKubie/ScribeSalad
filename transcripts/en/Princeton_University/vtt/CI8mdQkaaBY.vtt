CARL ADAIR: The We Speak survey?
Yeah, I'm definitely doing it.

00:00:03.231 --> 00:00:07.025
We need to find out what's worked
since last year, what's changed,

00:00:07.025 --> 00:00:08.666
what we still need to work on.

00:00:08.666 --> 00:00:12.965
Truth is a form of power, especially in
areas of sexual assault,

00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:15.387
sexual harassment, misconduct.

00:00:15.387 --> 00:00:18.082
The more we know,
the more we know how to make a change,

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:20.435
to make this place more inclusive
and safe for everybody,

00:00:20.435 --> 00:00:22.732
a place where we all want to live.

00:00:22.732 --> 00:00:25.557
This is Princeton.
