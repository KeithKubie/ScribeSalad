00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:01.934
That camera?

00:00:01.934 --> 00:00:03.280
That camera?

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.120
That camera.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.530
Hello.
I’m Daryl Johnson, and today,

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.820
we will be talking
about the oc...

00:00:10.067 --> 00:00:11.110
Mm-mm.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.380
Hello. I’m Daryl Johnson,
and today,

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.510
we will be talking about
the occupation of Alcatraz.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.144
Cheers, my friend.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:25.760
So there was a big fire
that happened in 1969,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.090
and it burned down the American
Indian Center in San Francisco.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.800
So there was a group of people
called the Indians of All Tribes.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.020
And they were like,

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.280
“Man, we gotta find
a new place to gather.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.620
We gotta be somewhere
where we can be ourselves.”

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.002
So there was these three
leaders,

00:00:39.002 --> 00:00:39.710
OK?

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.010
Richard Oakes, LaNada Means
and Adam Fortunate Eagle.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.010
And they were like,
“Wait, is this real?

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.090
According to the Treaty
of Fort Laramie of 1868,

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.230
it says that Native Americans
are allowed to confiscate

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.000
abandoned federal land
for their own use.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.400
Now, the famed Alcatraz Prison’s
been sitting there empty

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.440
for six years as federal
surplus land, so booyow!

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.950
We got our new location:
the Rock.”

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.450
And they were like, “Well, let’s
just take this bitch.”

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.340
So, on November 20th, 1969,
the coalition of, like, 89 members

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.790
of the Indians
of All Tribes cruise

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.490
across the San Francisco Bay.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.700
And some fat cat land tycoon
was over there like,

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.680
“Hey, man. I got these plans
to develop this land

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.140
into a Monte Carlo-themed casino.”

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.880
And then, boom, Native American
people get there.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.510
They’re like, “Man, get
the f**k out of here

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.210
with these dumb-ass plans.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.170
It’s ours, baby!
You stole it from us once,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.519
but we’re going to steal it
from your ass now.”

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.070
And they started spray-painting
stuff on the walls like,

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.590
“Welcome to Indian land,” and,
like,

00:01:48.453 --> 00:01:49.110
“Red power.”

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:52.100
I like that one.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.320
Adam Fortunate Eagle
was still on the mainland

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.020
because he was the spokesperson
for the tribe.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.970
He was like, “Look, y’all.
We takin’ this shit over. OK?

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.030
Y’all ain’t using it,
and we need it.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.079
All of this belong
to us anyway, OK?”

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.820
He said, “Look. We’re not just
going to take it outright.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.030
We’re not terrible people.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.200
We’ll give your $24
in glass beads

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.580
and some red claws.
How about that?”

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.700
And you know why they gave them
$24 of glass beads?

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.800
Because that’s how much
the Dutch merchants

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.840
paid the Native Americans
for Manhattan.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:27.120
Now, I’m someone who loves a person
who keeps their petty game up,

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.548
but that petty level is on 1,000.

00:02:31.548 --> 00:02:33.580
And all this information gets out.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.730
More and more people
show up on the island.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.169
And by Thanksgiving Day
in 1969,

00:02:39.169 --> 00:02:43.650
400 people are now
occupying Alcatraz.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.260
How ironic is that?
Thanksgiving!

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.800
So, of the 50 people there
representing

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.780
Alcatraz,
40 of them were women.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.130
LaNada Means was like,
“You know why?

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.490
Because they got a voice,
and we recognize that shit.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.780
Look. We got a clinic running.
We got a kitchen.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.980
We got John Trudell, the voice
of Radio Free Alcatraz.”

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.650
And he’d be like,
“If you a Native American,

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.020
you can come up here
and be free and be yourself

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.369
and celebrate your own culture
and your pride.”

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.640
And she was like,
“We have set up a school.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:22.440
These kids are not learning from
these white man’s history books.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.300
They’re learning
about their history.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.000
We did that. OK?”

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.560
And they puttin’ middle fingers
all up in the government.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.950
Rich Nixon like, “Ooh, is
that a finger in my face?

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.680
All I see is middle fingers up
in this bitch. What’s going on?”

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.640
Now, the white man don’t like
losing something

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.955
that they stole anyway.

00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:39.270
Richard Nixon was like,

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.370
“We can’t attack
these Native American peoples.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.440
We’ve got so much going on
with this country.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.760
We have the Civil War...
No, not the Civil War.

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:50.600
Civil rights protest. We
can’t have another situation!”

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.830
That’s just Tricky
Dick trying to save himself.

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:55.480
You know, he was already involved
in a scandal,

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.790
and stuff
was about to go down with him

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.430
that he didn’t
even know about yet.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.210
But I do, because this is “Drunk
History,” and all that’s history,

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:04.478
and I knew it before he knew it,
you know what I’m sayin’?

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:08.880
That’s the alcohol talking.

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.450
And so, the Coast Guard’s like,
“Yo. OK.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.460
Richard Nixon said we can’t go
in there and show no force?

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.850
Great. Alright.
This is what we gonna do.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:18.649
We gonna take
all their fresh water.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.230
We gonna take their electricity.
They can’t...”

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.570
Let me say that right.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.420
They going to take
their electricity.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:28.650
And they set a fire.

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.120
I mean, they don’t know
who set the fire,

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.760
but if I had to put
my bets on it,

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.559
I’d say the government
set the fire.

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:36.072
OK?

00:04:36.072 --> 00:04:40.940
So in July of 1971, the Coast
Guard laid siege to Alcatraz.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.240
They was like,
“OK, Native American peoples,

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.940
or whatever you call yourself.

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.192
This long belands...

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.480
This land belongs to us,
the white man.”

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.940
And the shit was over.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.150
After the almost two-year
occupation of Alcatraz,

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:00.810
the fat cat was like,
“Hey, man. Look.

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:03.010
I don’t think I want
to build here no more.”

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.480
So the government turned it
into a National Park.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:08.680
And you can go there today

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.500
and still see some
of the graffiti on the walls.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.880
The Native Americans
still come back twice a year

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.850
to celebrate the occupation

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.080
on what they now call
Un-Thanksgiving’s Day,

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.770
and that Christopher
Motherf**king Columbus Day

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.550
that we now call
Indigenous Peoples’ Day.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.010
Indigenous Peoples’ Day, y’all!

00:05:28.683 --> 00:05:30.470
Indigenous Peoples’ Day.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.675
They was like,
“We took this shit, y’all,

00:05:33.675 --> 00:05:36.360
for almost two years.
What did you do today?”

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.940
“Checked your mail.
Ate some Jell-O.”

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:40.780
Bastard.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.890
How’d you know?
[Laughs]
