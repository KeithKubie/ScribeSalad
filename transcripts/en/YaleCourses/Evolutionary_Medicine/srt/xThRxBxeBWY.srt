1
00:00:01,090 --> 00:00:06,090
The second major mismatch disease like
obesity is type two diabetes and obesity.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,460
Diabetes is also a disease of homeostasis.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,293
Okay.

4
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:15,760
It results from obesity related.

5
00:00:15,761 --> 00:00:20,110
Inflammation is regulated
by exercise and Diet.

6
00:00:21,310 --> 00:00:24,850
It can be a consequence of poor
nourishment is infant or child,

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,550
and in order to understand
the homeostatic mechanism,

8
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:33,400
we begin with the normal
regulation of blood sugar.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,410
The proximate cause of
diabetes is insulin resistance,

10
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:43,090
and that is what regulates the uptake of
blood sugar by muscle and the fat cells.

11
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,280
The glucose transporters in the brain
can take up glucose even when its

12
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:51,260
concentration in the blood is low.

13
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,240
Yeah.

14
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:58,100
Oh, the glucose transporters in liver and
pancreas only take up glucose when its

15
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,290
concentration in the blood is high.

16
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,133
Yeah.

17
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,880
Glucose transporters in most other tissues
respond to their functional demands,

18
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:11,890
so that privileges energy
supply to the brain. However,

19
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,660
only the glucose transporters in skeletal
muscle and fat respond to insulin,

20
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,540
which is produced when blood sugar rises

21
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:24,890
because those tissues are the
major consumers of glucose.

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:28,610
Insulin actually controls glucose
allocation among all tissues.

23
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:36,770
Now, in reallocation, there
are several important effects.

24
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:41,840
The first is the glucose allocation
will shift from maternal to fetal tissue

25
00:01:41,841 --> 00:01:42,800
during pregnancy

26
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,720
and it will shift to immune
cells during infections.

27
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:50,780
So what happens here is that glucose,

28
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:57,100
insulin resistance in muscle and fat cells
so that they won't take up glucose is

29
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:02,570
allowing glucose to shift from the
maternal blood to the fetal blood during

30
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:07,571
pregnancy and from muscle and fat
into immune cells during infections.

31
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:15,870
So that is orchestrated by decreasing the
sensitivity and muscle and fat and the

32
00:02:17,411 --> 00:02:22,411
capacity for insulin resistance is
built in the normal physiology and it's

33
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:24,190
essential for its functions.

34
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,480
So this is a good example of building,

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,800
designing a system that has in it a point
that's a weak link appointed becomes

36
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,320
an origin of susceptibility.

37
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,630
Okay,

38
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,390
so when does insulin
resistance become abnormal?

39
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,450
Obesity is causing an overflow of fatty
acids into skeletal muscle and that can

40
00:02:53,451 --> 00:02:55,520
trigger insulin resistance by itself.

41
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:56,883
Okay.

42
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:57,971
Fat Tissue,

43
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:02,971
adipose tissue secrete inflammatory
cytokines that are triggering insulin

44
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:07,660
resistance directly by blocking insulin
signaling in fat, most of the lung, liver,

45
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:12,910
and it does so indirectly by blocking
lipid deposition in fat tissue,

46
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:17,800
which increases the circulation of fatty
acids that then overflow into skeletal

47
00:03:17,801 --> 00:03:18,634
muscle.

48
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:24,630
So there is a dynamic loop going on
here and obesity can cause more and more

49
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:28,120
insulin resistance.

50
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:29,610
Yeah,

51
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,470
exercise and diet can combat it.

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,840
Exercise can prevent and reverse
insulin resistance in two ways.

53
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:41,700
It promotes the metabolism of excess
fatty acids and skeletal muscle,

54
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,770
so it removes that source and it activates
insulin dependent uptake of glucose

55
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,970
by skeletal muscle.

56
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,060
Yeah,

57
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,680
a diet rich in glucose and fructose,
however, can promote insulin resistance.

58
00:03:55,940 --> 00:04:00,940
Diet and exercise alone can reverse type
two diabetes if it's caught at an early

59
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:04,340
stage and that can be more effective
than treating it with drugs.

60
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:11,260
Type two diabetes also has
developmental and genetic origins.

61
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:17,010
The risk of type two diabetes is increased
by under nourishment of the fetus

62
00:04:17,011 --> 00:04:19,470
during pregnancy and have
children early in life.

63
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,990
Here's a child that has been starved.

64
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:23,520
Okay.

65
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,780
Both of those experienced stimulate
insulin resistance that can persist

66
00:04:27,781 --> 00:04:28,680
throughout life.

67
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,070
People also very genetically
for risk of type two diabetes,

68
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,450
and that's mediated by environmental
effects, particularly exercise and diet.

69
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,160
Okay,

70
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,350
so type two diabetes,

71
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:45,800
like obesity is a complex
disease with multiple causes.

72
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:51,080
It's a mismatch disease caused by an
increase in insulin resistance in fat and

73
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:53,940
muscle cells.
It is,

74
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,680
causes include obesity
related inflammation,

75
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,090
lack of exercise,

76
00:04:59,091 --> 00:05:03,590
a diet rich in glucose and fructose
and poor nourishment is fetus,

77
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:04,940
infant or child

78
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:11,150
type two diabetes is a disease of
homeostasis that's caused by the use of a

79
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:16,151
physiological control system that has
adjustable set points that produce

80
00:05:16,701 --> 00:05:19,820
vulnerabilities that are
exploited by mismatch.

81
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,700
Diet and exercise alone can reverse
it if it is caught early enough.
