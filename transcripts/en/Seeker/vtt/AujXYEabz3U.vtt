00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.010
These days people are obsessed with water
bottles, I think I have a dozen branded water

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:10.790
bottles on my desk, but I never use them!

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.740
Am I dehydrated?

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:20.020
How would I know?

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.440
We did a video a while back about how much
water we should be drinking that said we sometimes

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:25.960
drink too much water.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.810
According to widely reported data published
by the Associated Press in 2013, we're drinking

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.730
58 gallons of water per year (220L)-- or about
2.5 cups a day (0.6L), and that's a LOT.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.489
Way more than we did the late 90s, when soda
topped the beverage list.

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.870
But as long as we don't overdo it, it's probably
better we drink a little more water, than

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.960
a little less.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.319
Water helps balance the chemicals that keep
your body working.

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:53.420
It fills our cells, helps regulate our body
temperature by respiration and sweating, flushes

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.690
waste, forms saliva to intake fuel, lubricates
our joints, cushions our spinal cord and brain,

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.820
and carbohydrates and proteins are metabolized
and transported by water in our blood!

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.440
You commonly hear we are 75 percent water,
but different organs are different percentages

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.440
of water.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.600
The brain is 73 percent water, skin is a little
less at 64 percent water, and muscles and

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.960
kidneys are a little more at 79 percent water;
bones, however, are only 31 percent.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.150
We can survive for weeks without food, but
only a few days without water.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.570
During sports, athletes can lose 6-10 percent
of body weight simply from loss of water!

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.280
It's important to drink when thirsty, but
don't PUSH FLUIDS.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.560
A study in the Journal of Applied Physiology
found a 15 percent reduced muscle endurance

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.420
during dehydration but no effect on overall
muscle strength.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.320
Water does not alleviate muscle cramps or
stop heat stroke, and too much can cause hyponatremia,

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.980
or a dilution of salt in the blood -- which
can result in your death.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:01.120
That said, even mild dehydration (a 1.5 percent
drop in water) can mess with focus, alertness

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.520
and short-term memory, which is why you should
drink water before a test at school AND during

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.090
rigorous exercise.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.860
Even conditioned athletes who were mildly
dehydrated scored highly in "fatigue, confusion,

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.129
anger, and vigor" on a subjective mood score.

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.139
Chronic dehydration puts people at a risk
for type 2 diabetes, cancer, high blood pressure

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.139
and obesity!

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:27.640
A study in Physiology and Behavior found hypohydration
-- a.k.a. dehydration -- can cause increased

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.200
error rates while driving and altered mood
states in men, and another study with women

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.269
found, while they don't experience diminished
cognitive function, they do see increases

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.030
in fatigue, tension and anxiety!

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:43.670
And that's just the mild stuff, excessive
dehydration is when things get really dangerous.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.480
As full dehydration sets in and the body realizes
water is not being replaced, it will stop

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.640
sweating, stop urinating, and attempt to conserve
as much water as it can.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.260
This causes the blood to thicken, which, in
turn, causes increased blood pressure.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.480
The heart has to pump harder to push the sludgy
blood around the body and cholesterol increases

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.849
as the water is lost from cells.

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:09.969
Ultimately, the heart suffers and chances
of cardiac arrest increase, and cognitive

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.430
impairment worsens.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.090
It's pretty unlikely for this to happen while
playing sports, because eventually you'll

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.090
have to stop.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.909
But, as we get older, the body's thirst mechanism
worsens, increasing the risk of dehydration

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:23.980
without even knowing we're dehydrated!

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.840
If you're worried about dehydration, the best
thing to do is watch your fluid intake, and

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.140
how much you're sweating.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.459
Sweat allows the body to cool, so as dehydration
sets in, the body will get increasingly warm,

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.389
and yet sweat less.

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:41.109
Sweat ALSO contains electrolytes, which are
salts and minerals it needs to survive; like

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.480
sodium and potassium.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.189
If you're drinking water on an empty stomach
it can be absorbed through the intestine and

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.680
hit the bloodstream in less than five minutes
-- but if you've eaten, it can take as long

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:55.010
as 45 minutes up to 120 minutes to fully "digest"
the water!

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.859
Drinking water and/or sports drinks both during
and after vigorous activity can help the body

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.389
recover from all that fluid loss AND help
you cool off!

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:04.739
Even RIGHT AWAY.

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.209
But as long as we're talking about cool.

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:10.129
Toyota has been doing some really cool stuff
with the TRD line of Toyota Trucks.

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:11.489
Enhanced to rule the off-road!
