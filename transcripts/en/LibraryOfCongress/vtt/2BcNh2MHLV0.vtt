all of the school names,

that's when I want
you all to clap okay?

Now on with our show.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.510
So last December
here at the Library

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.530
of Congress we had a special
program celebrating a book.

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.220
The book we were celebrating
was one published in 1936.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.160
And it was turned
into a movie in 2017.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.780
And some of you may
have heard of it

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.680
because you either read the
book, The Story of Ferdinand

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.000
or you saw the movie Ferdinand.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.510
Well in the movie.

Ferdinand the movie,

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.450
the voice of Ferdinand was
John Cena and he came here

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:07.290
to the library and read the
original book to a large group

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.860
of students in this
very auditorium.

Today we are very happy that
he is back with us again.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.980
And once again inspiration
is part of our program.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:23.390
Last December when we
introduced John we described him

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.210
as an actor, and as a
wrestling superstar.

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.770
And those descriptions certainly
still apply, but today we get

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.710
to add author to
his description.

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:38.950
He has written a new book
entitled Elbow Grease.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:41.770
It was illustrated
by Howard McWilliam

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.970
and published by Random House.

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.170
And a copy of this book
is now in the Library

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:48.890
of Congress's collection.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.360
So it is part of the
largest library in the world.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.000
John is here not only to
read Elbow Grease but also

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.040
to share another book one
written and illustrated

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.250
by Richard Scarry
that inspired him.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.760
After John reads from the two
books he will talk with us a bit

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.010

that I know a few of you have.

because it's all creative.

And all of us, no matter
where we come from,

00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.700
no matter what we look
like, all of us have inside

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:44.860
of us this wonderful
thing called imagination.

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:48.020
When you get to sing or
you, you watch something

00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:51.370
that you stimulates your
imagination it's fun.

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:56.950
And to me what also stimulates
my imagination is books.

00:07:56.950 --> 00:07:59.320
Books more than anything else.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.500
Because in the pages
you can kind

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:03.280
of determine what the
characters are like.

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.240
Maybe develop a voice
for somebody

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:07.570

for a character.

favorite ways to be imaginative.

00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:24.680
I grew up in a small town.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:29.520
It was nothing like D.C. You
couldn't see fancy building,

00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:34.200
and people walking the streets
and tons of cars and trucks.

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.520
And things that go.

00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.820
You had farm land.

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.340
And I was lucky to maybe get a
glimpse of a rusted old tractor.

00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:45.250
And my next door neighbor
was miles, and miles away.

00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:50.430
So when my mom read me
this story, Cars and Trucks

00:11:50.430 --> 00:11:54.540
and Things That Go I didn't
really hang on every word

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:56.960
because there's a lot of words
in here for a children's book.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:59.100
It's a long book.

00:11:59.100 --> 00:12:03.280
But what I loved as some
of you guys pointed out,

00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:07.860
I loved the pictures because
it brought me away to a world

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.400
that I could see
these amazing machines

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.700
that I'd only heard about.

00:12:11.700 --> 00:12:16.490
Like if you opened the book.

00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:19.010
I'll just even flip
to page nine.

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.700
There's a pickle truck.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.110
A giant pickle truck.

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:29.660
There's also a dragster and a
crocodile car and a sailboat.

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:33.770
And then there's a tow truck
and what looks like a sports car

00:12:33.770 --> 00:12:37.680
and what looks like an antiques
sports car and a milk truck.

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.110
And this is only one page.

00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:41.410
I saw this as a kid.

00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:44.190
I was like man the
pickle truck is there

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.660
and then everything else.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.960
It's huge.

00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:54.680
If you turn to page --
ooh this is a good one.

00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.970
So page 15.

00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.270
I always loved construction.

00:12:59.270 --> 00:13:01.860
I love bull dozers
because they could smash.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.300
And I loved cranes because
they could lift things.

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.820
And I loved big trucks
because they could carry things

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:08.120
and tow things.

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:12.380
So on one page you have
a crane, a bulldozer,

00:13:12.380 --> 00:13:17.100
a real small minivan, which
is which is a mouse van.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:19.470
You have jack-o-lantern
pump, pumpkin car

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.440
and then you have a rainbow bus

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:24.480
and all a bunch of
really cool stuff.

00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:29.720
And oh I think this is my
favorite page of the whole book

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.690
because I love making
a mess as a little kid.

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:34.270
And I loved big trucks.

00:13:34.270 --> 00:13:37.940
And you can see all sorts of
dump trucks, what they carry

00:13:37.940 --> 00:13:40.380
and they're all making a mess.

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.850
You have trucks that carry
coal, trucks that carry rocks,

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:45.340
trucks that carry dirt,
trucks that carry tomatoes,

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:48.330
trucks that carry oranges,
and trucks that carry sand.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.760
And they're all making a mess.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.230
And as a kid I loved this.

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:56.420
And it's just an example of
your answers to these questions

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:58.070
about what makes a
book your favorite.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:04.360
If you turn to page even page
35 you again see dump trucks,

00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:08.300
but instead of making
a mess this time,

00:14:08.300 --> 00:14:09.980
they're building a road.

00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:11.550
So they're doing
something productive

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.230
and they're making a
road to help make a city.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:15.530
And then I got to thinking

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:16.830
as a kid who's going
to live in that city?

00:14:16.830 --> 00:14:18.130
What's the city going
to look like?

00:14:18.130 --> 00:14:21.940
Man it must be a
crazy far-away place.

00:14:26.670 --> 00:14:33.280
And on page 45 -- I really
-- if you know this about me,

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:35.850
but I like to drive pretty fast.

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:41.230
Like the speed limit almost,
but I've always liked fast cars.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:45.140
And this is a whole page
devoted to cars that go fast.

00:14:45.140 --> 00:14:48.130
And as a kid I just
couldn't believe

00:14:48.130 --> 00:14:51.330
that all this material
was in one book.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:57.810
And guys this is only five pages
of this massive, massive book.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.710
And once again I loved when my
mom used to read me this story.

00:15:01.710 --> 00:15:06.220
But she used to read it and the
words almost felt like music

00:15:06.220 --> 00:15:09.210
because I was so
lost in the pictures.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.970
And that's the great thing
about books especially from some

00:15:11.970 --> 00:15:13.340
of the answers we heard.

00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:14.640
If they're colorful.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:15.940

If they have a great story.

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.880
If they have a little
bit of mystery.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.090
If they have wonderful pictures.

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:22.390
They can allow us to use

00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.760
that powerful thing called
imagination that allows us

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:29.340
to create fantastic
and wonderful things.

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:33.640

questions before we get

00:15:33.640 --> 00:15:37.460

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:44.170
Now, now that's a very, that's
a very important question

00:16:44.170 --> 00:16:48.330
because it has to do with the
story I'm about to read you.

00:16:48.330 --> 00:16:51.080
I wanted to ask if you
had a brother, a sister,

00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.910
or a cousin because you know
what it's like to be close

00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:57.170
to someone who is family.

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.470
Sometimes you guys get along.

00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:02.000
Sometimes maybe you
have a disagreement.

00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.300
Sometimes you don't get along.

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:05.460
But at the end of the
day because you're family

00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:08.310
and you spend a lot of time
with each other you develop love

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:10.040
and bond for one another.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:15.520
And that's kind of what led me
to want to write Elbow Grease,

00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.630
because as you'll soon find
out, Elbow Grease lives

00:17:18.630 --> 00:17:21.900
in a wonderful world
of imagination.

00:17:21.900 --> 00:17:25.210

different then his brothers.

And sometimes his
brothers don't understand

00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.940
and make fun of him for it.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.760
But Elbow Grease doesn't care
because he's proud of who he is.

to encourage young
people to read.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:07.590
And that's why I didn't
write an adult book.

00:40:07.590 --> 00:40:10.550
I wanted to become a children's
author because I know a lot

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:13.380
of children watch WWE
and a lot of children

00:40:13.380 --> 00:40:15.210
like to see me perform.

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:18.270
So I wanted to give a chance for
young people to become readers.

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:22.600
&gt;&gt; Lee Ann Potter: And one
more and that will do it.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:23.900
&gt;&gt; John Cena: One more question.

00:40:23.900 --> 00:40:26.420
The final question.

00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:27.960
Could be about ice cream.

00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:34.210
&gt;&gt; Hi my name is King and
what is your favorite t-shirt?

00:40:34.210 --> 00:40:35.710
&gt;&gt; John Cena: What is
my favorite t-shirt?

00:40:35.710 --> 00:40:37.900
&gt;&gt; I mean your favorite shirt.

00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:39.940
&gt;&gt; John Cena: What's
my favorite shirt?

00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:42.990
Well I, I can, I can tell
you that it's what I have

00:40:42.990 --> 00:40:45.420
on because I just dressed
my best for you guys

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:47.510
and I wanted to look nice.

00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:48.810

&gt;&gt; You're so funny.

00:40:59.740 --> 00:41:01.040
&gt;&gt; John Cena: That
was my one demand

00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:02.660
when we did this whole
giant photo shoot.

00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:05.180
I said "You better have my
favorite t-shirt there."

00:41:05.180 --> 00:41:08.250
And low and behold my
favorite t-shirt was there.

00:41:08.250 --> 00:41:10.220

And wait a second,
wait a second.

Before we wrap up the morning,
I wanted to say thank you,

00:41:23.350 --> 00:41:27.280
thank all of you because I know
sometimes it's difficult to sit

00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.530
in a place and listen
to people talk.

00:41:29.530 --> 00:41:32.530
You guys have been a
wonderful audience.
