00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is none of these work.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
He couldn't generate them himself because if he generated them himself,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
there's no way Alice could generate these garbled tables.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
He can ask Alice to provide them. That would require him to reveal his input.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And the whole point of this protocol is for him not to have to do that.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This approach wouldn't work either--if Alice gives Bob both of the values for each input,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
then he can evaluate these gates with both of these values,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and he will learn more about Alice's inputs than he should.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The answer is none of these work. We need some other solution.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We need some way to enable Bob to obtain these inputs

00:00:35.000 --> 99:59:59.000
without revealing to Alice what Bob's actual values are.
