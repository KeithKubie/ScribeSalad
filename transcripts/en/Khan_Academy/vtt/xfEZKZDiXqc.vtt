00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.370
Welcome back.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.190
We're now going to be in the
next section, section four in

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.220
our fourth test. And that's
problem one, 594.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.420
Problem one.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.540
x minus y is equal to 8.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.910
y is equal to 3z.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.150
And z is equal to 2.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.570
What is x?

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.260
z is equal to 2, y is equal
to 3z, so y is equal to 6.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.470
So x minus 6 is equal to
8, or x is equal to 14.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.720
E.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.060
I already said z
is equal to 2.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.210
I sometimes forget
when I just said.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.500
Maybe I'm aging.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.980
Problem number two.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.590
Todd is older than Marta,
but younger than Susan.

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.320
Let's say their first
letter is their age.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.900
Say Todd is older than
Marta, so his age is

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.150
greater than Marta.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.849
But he's also younger than
Susan, for his age is less

00:01:04.849 --> 00:01:06.099
than Susan's age.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.390
Oh I think I did this problem
inadvertantly.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.440
If t, m, and s represent the
ages in years of Todd, Marta,

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.450
and Susan respectively, which
of the following is true?

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.700
And exactly what I
drew is choice A.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.530
And this comes straight
from their statements.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.067
I literally was just writing
this because I thought they

00:01:24.067 --> 00:01:25.690
were going to ask something
harder.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.290
But this they're saying Todd is
older than Marta, so t is

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.920
greater than m.

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.790
And Todd is younger than Susan,
so t is less than s, so

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:35.100
that's just choice A.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.570
Problem number three.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.550
If the areas of two regions are
equal, and the sum of the

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.670
areas of the regions is 5, what
is the average of the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.760
areas of the two regions?

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.040
So area 1 equals area 2.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.730
We know that.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.420
And we also know that the
sum of the areas is 5.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.200
So area 1 plus area
2 is equal to 5.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.850
But then, of course, we know
that area 2 is the same

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.800
thing as area 1.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.870
So we also know that area 1
times 2 is equal to 5, or that

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.100
each of the areas is 2.5.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.630
And area 2 would also be 2.5.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.180
We know that because they're
equal to each other, and when

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.460
you add them up it's 5.

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.450
So they're each going to
be half of that, so

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:24.970
they're each 2 and 1/2.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.090
And they want to know, what is
the average of the areas in

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.930
the two regions?

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.360
Well they're the same
number, right?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.550
So if you average two of the
same number, the average is

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:33.620
going to be that number.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.140
You could add them and divide
by 2, but you're

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.600
going to get 2.5.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.460
And if you look at the
choices, where's 2.5?

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:44.970
2.5 is the same thing as 2 and
1/2, which is the same thing

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.320
as 5/2, so it's choice D.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.570
Next problem.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.750
I'll switch colors.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.420
Problem number four.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.950
Let s be the set of all integers
that can be written

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:06.410
as n squared plus 1, where
n is a non zero integer.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.117
N is greater than zero, and it
soon. is an integer, it is a

00:03:09.117 --> 00:03:10.160
non zero integer.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.970
Which of the following
integers is an s?

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.220
So n squared plus 1.

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.130
So let's get a feel
for what it is.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.280
When n is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.890
When n is 1, n squared,
plus 1 is 2.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.410
2 squared plus 1 is 5.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.240
3 squared plus 1 is 10.

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:33.180
4 squared plus 1 is 17.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.390
It's always going to be one more
than a perfect square.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.980
25 plus 1 is 26.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.100
There's 37, right?

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.080
So the choice is, it
has to be one more

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.430
than a perfect square.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:46.370
So which of the following
integers is an s?

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.300
So choice A is 16.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.530
16 is a perfect square, but
it's not one more than a

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.120
perfect square.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.980
Similarly, choice B, 28.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:00.040
28 minus 1 is 27, that's
not a perfect square.

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.350
35 minus 1 isn't a
perfect square.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.150
39 minus 1 isn't a
perfect square.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.290
And if you look at
choice E, 50.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:10.330
50 minus 1 is 49, which is,
of course, 7 squared.

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.540
Actually we would have gotten
there if we had

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:12.880
just done one more.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.529
7 squared plus 1, 49 plus
1, is equal to 50.

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:21.600
The important thing to realize
is that, the integers in s are

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.890
integers that are one more
than a perfect square.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.500
So you just have to look at the
choices and say, which of

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.230
these is one more than
a perfect square?

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.225
Let's do problem number five.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:40.140
So I have a circle here,
that's my circle.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.070
And it has a triangle
inside the circle.

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:46.180
It looks something-- I try to
draw these as close to what

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.640
they drew in the book
as possible.

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:53.540
There's point like that, there's
point like that, and

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.880
then there's a triangle
that looks like that.

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.110
And they write this is the
center, of course, is o.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.850
They're saying that this
right here is x.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.700
They say that this
right here is y.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.880
And then the question reads, in
the figure above, point o

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.640
is the center of the circle.

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:21.540
If x is equal to 40 degrees,
what is the value of y?

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:23.270
And you'll be like, how
do I figure this out?

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.310
I know the angles of a triangle
add up to 180, and

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.000
all that, but they've only
given me one angle.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.060
And I don't know the angle.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.360
Or so you think you don't
know this angle.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.540
One of the things that should
immediately enter your mind

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.500
when you see this in the SAT is,
the sides of this triangle

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.350
are the radius of the circle.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:43.730
It's the radius of the circle.

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:45.820
Because every time it gets to
the end point, and they

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.620
actually it draw like that.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.660
So if this is the radius, we
know that this side is going

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.570
to be equal to this side.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.220
Because both of these sides are
the length of the radius

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.140
of the circle.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:56.580
And they do this a
lot in the SAT.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.840
If something is a radius of a
circle, it never changes.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.150
Anywhere you draw it.

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:02.660
The radius is constant as you
go around the circle.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.880
So if this side is equal
to this side,

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.020
what do we know happens?

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.550
It's an isosceles triangle, and
the base angles are equal.

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.390
So this is y, we also
know that this is y.

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.873
Because they're the
base angles.

00:06:14.873 --> 00:06:18.200
you They're corresponding angles
to these two sides.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.820
They're the base angles
for this triangle.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:21.280
Now we can solve it.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:28.020
We could say, x, which is 40
degrees, plus y plus y is

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.730
equal to 180.

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:34.360
Or we could say 40 plus
2y is equal to 180.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.240
2y is equal to 140.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.190
Y is equal to 70 degrees.

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:40.720
And that is choice D.

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.500
Next problem.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:50.510
Problem number 6.

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:55.250
A simple square is any integer
greater than 1 that has only

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.170
three positive integer
factors.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.540
Itself, its square
root, and 1.

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.580
Which of the following
is a simple square?

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.595
It can only have three
factors, it

00:07:06.595 --> 00:07:08.130
can't anything else.

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.370
So, for example, if we wrote
all of the perfect squares.

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:22.350
1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:24.330
If we write the factors,
this factor only has 1.

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:25.630
This factor has 1, 2 and 1.

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:26.920
This has 1, 3 and 9.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.060
I'm just writing out
all the factors.

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.080
1, 2, and 4.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:38.160
So it would be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16.

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:39.390
I'm just doing this
as an example.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:40.400
You shouldn't do this
on the SAT.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:42.630
But I want to explain
what they're saying.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:45.530
All of these numbers are
perfect squares.

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:54.500
But notice 16 has itself, 1, and
it has some extra factors.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.610
While these numbers only have
its square root, and

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.720
themselves, and 1 as factors.

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.750
So these are simple squares.

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:08.300
So if we look at the choices,
choice A, 121.

00:08:08.300 --> 00:08:11.810
121, I know 1 is a factor,
I know that's 11 squared.

00:08:11.810 --> 00:08:13.660
I know it's 121.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:16.400
And I think, other than that,
there's not any other factors.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.720
It's not divisible by 3.

00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.900
B is 100.

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.170
100's got a ton of factors.

00:08:22.170 --> 00:08:24.650
I mean it's got 1,
10, and 100.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:30.930
It also has 2 and 50.

00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:34.059
It has 4 and 25, it has a ton
of factors other than its

00:08:34.059 --> 00:08:36.309
square root, so it's
not choice B.

00:08:36.309 --> 00:08:39.159
Choice C, 81, same thing.

00:08:39.159 --> 00:08:43.990
It could be 1, 1 times 81,
it could be 9 times 9.

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:47.640
Or it could be 27 times 3,
and so forth and so on.

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:48.890
So it's not choice C.

00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:51.290
I think A is our prime
contender.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:52.670
Choice D, 64.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.890
Once again, tons of factors
outside of its square root.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.280
It has 1, 64, and 8.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:59.870
But it also has 2 times 32.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:03.180
It has 4 times 16, and
you could go on.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.810
64 has a ton of factors.

00:09:04.810 --> 00:09:08.010
And, finally, choice E.

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:08.790
33.

00:09:08.790 --> 00:09:11.070
E doesn't work, because that's
not even a perfect sqaure.

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:12.240
What squared equals 33?

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.260
I don't know.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.630
So that doesn't even work.

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:18.240
So it's definitely choice A.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.080
Next problem.

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.990
Actually I only have 40 seconds
left, so I'll do it in

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:21.860
the next video.

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.110
