1
00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.550
Part of the nature of disease is determined by the distinction between organs

2
00:00:06.521 --> 00:00:10.960
and tissues that are either more vulnerable or more robust and organs and

3
00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:13.390
tissues differ considerably in that respect.

4
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.790
This has to do with tissue renewal and repair,
sensitivity to stress,

5
00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:20.860
vulnerability to threats,

6
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.330
which tissues are the weakest physiological links,

7
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:31.290
and the fact that evolution has designed different tissues and organs to have

8
00:00:31.451 --> 00:00:33.490
different built in safety factors.

9
00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:38.860
All of this occurs within a framework of trade offs and constraints.

10
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.050
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.050
<v 0>It also occurs because tradeoffs leave us exposed to mismatches which reveal the</v>

12
00:00:48.161 --> 00:00:49.660
costs of the tradeoffs.

13
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:52.080
<v 1>Okay,</v>

14
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.520
<v 0>so let's consider this spectrum from from vulnerability to robustness.</v>

15
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.260
Organs and tissues differ in their robustness,

16
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.180
their resilience and their vulnerability.

17
00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:08.900
Robustness means how resistant assistant is to disease and resilience means how

18
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.970
easily a system can return to health.

19
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.620
That mosaic determines the spectrum of diseases,

20
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:19.590
both in general and in particular environments.

21
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:21.470
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

22
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.000
<v 0>robustness and resilience are often negatively correlated.
Bones,
for example,</v>

23
00:01:26.001 --> 00:01:29.240
resist damage.
So they're robust,
but they're hard to mend.

24
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.120
On the other hand,
epithelium wounds easily,
but it recovers rapidly,

25
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.560
so it's resilient,
but it's not very robust.
Now,

26
00:01:39.561 --> 00:01:44.540
why are all organs and tissues not as robust and resilient as possible?

27
00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.480
It's because of tradeoffs producing such structures and processes would cost

28
00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.740
more than it would pay?

29
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.370
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

30
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.530
<v 0>Let's consider tissue renewal and repair.</v>

31
00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.880
Here we have a picture of a bronchial epithelium and some neurons and the rat

32
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:04.240
spinal cord.
These have different properties,

33
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.150
tissues that have a high renewal rate,

34
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.180
like the bronchiolar epithelium also have a high repair capacity and they're

35
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:13.810
pretty tolerant to damage.

36
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:17.260
That's true of most epithelium and the hematopoietic system.

37
00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.331
On the other hand,

38
00:02:19.331 --> 00:02:23.890
tissues that have a low renewal rate and a low repair capacity do not tolerate

39
00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:27.330
damage.
That includes neurons and cardiomyocyte.
My

40
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:30.920
<v 1>damaged too.</v>

41
00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.990
<v 0>Tissues with a high renewal rate is easily handled.</v>

42
00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:39.850
Comparable damage to things like neurons and cardio.
My seats can be fatal.

43
00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.500
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

44
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.690
<v 0>What about sensitivity to stress?
Well,</v>

45
00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.700
in tissues with high energetic demands rely exclusively on oxidative metabolism,

46
00:02:51.801 --> 00:02:53.840
so that would be neurons and heart.
Muscle

47
00:02:55.460 --> 00:03:00.310
tissues with low energetic demands tolerate hypoxia relatively well because they

48
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:03.100
can switch from oxidative to glycolytic metabolism,

49
00:03:03.101 --> 00:03:07.660
so that would be a dipocytes fibroblasts.
Hematopoietic cells.

50
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:09.460
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

51
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.611
<v 0>no,</v>

52
00:03:09.611 --> 00:03:14.611
that's why is Kenya the lack of oxygen and nutrients rapidly in seriously

53
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:18.490
damages brains,
hearts and kidneys,
often irreversibly,

54
00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:19.900
sometimes fatally.

55
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.830
So these are the tissues that really need oxygen and are prioritized by our

56
00:03:26.681 --> 00:03:30.730
circulatory system to keep them going.
When oxygen levels drop,

57
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.100
then there is vulnerability to threats.

58
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.380
Protective structures have evolved to shield vulnerable,

59
00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:44.550
Oregon's from frequently and clown or threats.
So the skull protects the brain.

60
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.100
The Rib cage protects the heart and lungs.

61
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.700
Some tissues and organs are immune privileged.

62
00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:52.410
Here we have pictures of a couple of them.

63
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.210
They don't permit immune responses that have damaging side effects.

64
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:58.770
Inflammation for example.

65
00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.490
So brain eyes and gonads are all immune privileged and they do not inflame

66
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.470
easily when infected,
however,

67
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:13.471
a prices paid and the price is by avoiding the cost of inflammation,

68
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.790
they make themselves vulnerable to pathogens that can get into them.

69
00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.760
<v 1>Okay,</v>

70
00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.250
<v 0>so what are the weakest physiological links?</v>

71
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:28.920
The consequences of losing function very widely.
Lung tissues and organs.

72
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.470
If you have mild damage,

73
00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:35.100
deliver Skinner intestinal epithelium that can be tolerated,
repaired.

74
00:04:35.101 --> 00:04:37.140
It's often not lethal uncomfortable,

75
00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:41.340
but not lethal equivalent damage to the pulmonary.

76
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.020
The cardiovascular or to the central nervous system causes severe disease and

77
00:04:46.021 --> 00:04:50.580
even death.
So these are the weakest links in the body.

78
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:55.410
They're malfunction kills in their failure is a frequent cause of death in the

79
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:58.140
agent.
It is.
Therefore,

80
00:04:58.141 --> 00:05:02.100
the weakest links were special features of evolve to protect against

81
00:05:02.101 --> 00:05:03.210
catastrophic failure

82
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.260
built in safety factors are part of those protections.

83
00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.560
The safety factor is the ratio of functional capacity to expected maximal load.

84
00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.130
So for example with bodyweight is w and the skeleton can bear a weight of four w

85
00:05:21.141 --> 00:05:23.750
than the safety factor of the skeleton is for.

86
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:26.480
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

87
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.080
<v 0>increasing the safety factor has cost.
In this case,</v>

88
00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:34.220
further strengthening the skeleton would decrease mobility.
That's a tradeoff.

89
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.140
The greater the safety factor,
the greater the resistance to damage,

90
00:05:39.141 --> 00:05:42.440
but also the larger the costs of resistance.

91
00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:47.750
Here are a few safety factors for biological materials.

92
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:51.680
Human Pancreas,
about 10 the wing bones of a flying goose,

93
00:05:51.681 --> 00:05:56.681
about six human kidneys both for the leg bones of running ostrich,

94
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.230
2.5 the human small intestine about two in the backbone of a weight lifter

95
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.610
between one and two.

96
00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:07.753
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.730
<v 0>Our vulnerability is explained by trade offs and constraints.</v>

98
00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:15.990
Many structures are vulnerable because of compromises that are imposed by

99
00:06:15.991 --> 00:06:20.840
tradeoffs.
So for example,
here's a synovial joint.
The wrist,

100
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:21.960
the elbow,
the finger,

101
00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:25.940
the shoulder and the knee are all synovial joints and they have superior

102
00:06:25.941 --> 00:06:26.774
mobility.

103
00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.750
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

104
00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.580
<v 0>but they are vulnerable to arthritis.</v>

105
00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.420
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

106
00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.230
<v 0>Alveolar sacs in our lungs have excellent gas exchange,</v>

107
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:39.470
but they are vulnerable to pneumonia when they're filled with inflammatory

108
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:40.304
exited.

109
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:45.230
So you can see that there are vulnerabilities and costs that are built into

110
00:06:45.231 --> 00:06:47.360
things which otherwise are highly adaptive.

111
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:51.890
Other structures are vulnerable because of historical constraints.

112
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.170
One of the classic ones is the blind spot in the Vertebra.
I,
here's a vertebrate,

113
00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.790
I contracted with an octopus I the red is the retina,

114
00:07:00.791 --> 00:07:02.150
the photo sensitive cells,

115
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:07.990
the octopus has the retina lining the cup of the eye with the nerve fibers

116
00:07:09.081 --> 00:07:09.914
behind it.

117
00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:15.770
The vertebrate I has the nerve fibers wining the cup of the eye with the retina

118
00:07:15.771 --> 00:07:19.310
behind it and the nerve fibers have to go through the retina at some point to

119
00:07:19.311 --> 00:07:21.770
get to the brain and that is the blind spot.

120
00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:27.920
This difference in the structure of the eyes has persisted for about 500 million

121
00:07:27.921 --> 00:07:32.690
years and probably has to do with the developmental constraint on the

122
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:35.090
relationship of inducing tissues.

123
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.323
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

124
00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:40.293
<v 0>tradeoffs.</v>

125
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:45.610
We've mentioned many times they're very important after sufficient evolution in

126
00:07:45.801 --> 00:07:46.940
a stable environment,

127
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:50.540
the cost benefit balance of a tradeoff has usually been optimized.

128
00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:52.423
However,

129
00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.960
sufficient evolution in a stable environment is actually a very special case.

130
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.330
<v 1>Okay.</v>

131
00:07:58.330 --> 00:08:03.330
<v 0>Effects of disturbance can be serious when the trade off involves large benefits</v>

132
00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:05.960
that are balanced by large costs.

133
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:07.610
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

134
00:08:07.610 --> 00:08:09.860
<v 0>Pathologies can then result for two reasons.</v>

135
00:08:09.861 --> 00:08:13.520
The mechanism controlling the balance of the trade off or perturbed or the

136
00:08:13.521 --> 00:08:16.510
environment changes.
For example,

137
00:08:16.511 --> 00:08:19.390
the immune defense against infection is a large benefit.

138
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:24.420
It brings with it however high costs of immunopathology and the risks of sepsis

139
00:08:25.061 --> 00:08:28.060
and of electric shock and auto immune disease.

140
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:29.100
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

141
00:08:29.100 --> 00:08:34.100
<v 0>The clotting system is a very large benefit which helps us to heal rapidly if we</v>

142
00:08:35.851 --> 00:08:38.580
sustain damage to our circulatory system,

143
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.550
but it carries the risk of embolism and stroke

144
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.870
<v 1>mismatch.</v>

145
00:08:46.590 --> 00:08:49.260
<v 0>Also an important concept.
Frequently mentioned.</v>

146
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:51.930
If the environment changes,

147
00:08:51.931 --> 00:08:54.900
the cost may exceed the benefits until evolution catches,

148
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:56.610
and that can take quite awhile.

149
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:00.510
Modern hygienic environments are abnormal.

150
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:04.830
They elicit pathological immune responses that include asthma,
allergies,
excema,

151
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:06.210
and auto immune diseases.

152
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:10.890
Here's an example of Excema on the four owners of a patient,

153
00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:16.770
changes in Diet and an inflammation increased the risk of clotting disorders.

154
00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:20.130
So to summarize,

155
00:09:21.180 --> 00:09:26.040
the morphology and physiology of the patient is a mosaic of tissues,
organs,

156
00:09:26.041 --> 00:09:26.731
processes,

157
00:09:26.731 --> 00:09:31.650
and structures that vary in their vulnerability to damage their capacity for

158
00:09:31.651 --> 00:09:34.560
repair,
their sensitivity to stress,

159
00:09:35.040 --> 00:09:36.690
and they're built in safety factors.

160
00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.320
The key idea here is tradeoffs.

161
00:09:40.620 --> 00:09:43.380
Each of these features has benefits and costs.

162
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:49.200
When perturbations shift the cost benefit balance,
they elicit pathologies.

163
00:09:49.620 --> 00:09:53.520
That is situations in which the costs are greater than the benefits.
