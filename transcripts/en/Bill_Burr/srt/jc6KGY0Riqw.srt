1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:04,480
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,481 --> 00:00:09,420
Just before Friday. Monday morning
podcast. And I am just checking in on you.

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:12,580
A voice is still fucked
up. I got two more records,

4
00:00:12,581 --> 00:00:17,080
people episode nine and number 10 where
a just broke number 10 we're almost

5
00:00:17,081 --> 00:00:17,740
done.

6
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:21,890
Which means all freckles is then going
to be doing a bunch of spots around loss

7
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,150
of Congolese getting ready for
my European tour tour tour tour.

8
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:31,930
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Which
starts off in Dublin, Ireland,

9
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,110
Dublin, Ireland in a,

10
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,030
you know what's funny is I tried to
get on on July 31st it starts off and I

11
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:40,080
tried to get a, you know,

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:45,110
get a direct flight to the Emerald
Aisle and the a at this point because I

13
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:49,350
waited so long to get the
fucking tickets, um, you know,

14
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:52,150
which is a whole other story in
itself, you know what I mean?

15
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,420
Cause I'm going to take a vacation with
my wife afterwards and she was trying to

16
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:58,390
figure out where the fuck we were
going to go. And I was like, lady,

17
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:03,391
you better fucking figure out a place
soon cause this is gonna cost me a fortune

18
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:07,710
there. Um, so, uh,

19
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,190
turns out the out of lax,
the only two airlines,

20
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,360
it was air Lingus and um, uh,

21
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,810
what the fuck is it? Oh Jesus,

22
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:22,840
I already forgot the name of the what
the Hell is an Ethiopian Airlines?

23
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,820
Okay. Figure that one out.

24
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,050
I don't want to fly you the open airlines
and let some go into like, you know,

25
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:35,340
Ethiopia, Aer Lingus,
the Irish one. You know,

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:40,440
is that weird? Like if I'm
going to go to the Middle East,

27
00:01:40,441 --> 00:01:43,860
I want to fly you, uh, that whatever

28
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,580
United Air Emirates. I don't,

29
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,710
it's just weird superstition that I have
like the people at Ethiopian Airlines

30
00:01:52,711 --> 00:01:56,640
don't care cause they're flying to
Ireland. Does that make any sense?

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,230
It doesn't, that's just how scary
flying us. Like if I'm going to Poland,

32
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,670
I want a couple of Polish guy flying
it despite all the jokes about them.

33
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:09,870
Hey, how many Polish guys is it
take to fly a plane? A fucking,

34
00:02:09,871 --> 00:02:13,880
hopefully two of them,
you know, that studied

35
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:20,440
all the shit they needed to know. So aer
Lingus was more expensive and I said,

36
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,550
well fuck it. I'm going to take the,

37
00:02:21,551 --> 00:02:23,950
I don't even know if that's
the Irish one for some reason.

38
00:02:23,951 --> 00:02:28,951
I think that's the one with the four
leaf clover or is it so you've got a

39
00:02:28,991 --> 00:02:32,350
Leprechaun on the fucking
tailfin. Let me look this up.

40
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,350
Air Lingus latee every Irish guy's
giving me shit about my bad accent.

41
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,170
Like I give a fuck. All right.
Air Lingus images. Yeah,

42
00:02:42,171 --> 00:02:44,880
there it is. Oh, it's a three leaf clover.

43
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:48,640
Put another fucking leaf on there yet.
[inaudible] make me feel a little better.

44
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,670
Oh Jesus. Is that the best
plane that got? Oh boy.

45
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:58,540
That looks like just some shit
from the early seventies all right,

46
00:02:58,541 --> 00:03:00,100
let's look at Ethiopia.

47
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:03,750
Where Ethiopian air lines.

48
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,200
There is no food on this plane. Sorry.

49
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,510
Ethiopian Airlines.

50
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:16,680
Let's see what we got here. What do we
got here? I'm not going to lie to you.

51
00:03:16,681 --> 00:03:19,410
Both of these planes still look
these. Neither one of these are very,

52
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:23,070
uh Oh look at this steward
assists. They look pretty fine.

53
00:03:23,071 --> 00:03:25,760
They didn't have any stewards for the
Irish once. They probably all hammered.

54
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,170
Could I have any more stereotypes in this?

55
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,020
Um,

56
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,980
all right. They both live
professional. Who's kidding? Who?

57
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,980
You know what it is once you
travel outside of your own country,

58
00:03:36,981 --> 00:03:40,010
you know what I mean? I fly
American Airlines. I fly United,

59
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,650
I fly shit that I've heard
of. I've always done that.

60
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:45,860
Except early on in my career
when I used to fly like fucking,

61
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:49,490
what the fuck was that one?
It was air something or other.

62
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,390
I felt like ATA, I mean you,

63
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:56,650
you flew on that fucking
airlines. It was like,

64
00:03:58,150 --> 00:04:00,940
like the cabin to the
left of cockpit was open.

65
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,890
They were up there playing like
connect four and shit. It was,

66
00:04:02,891 --> 00:04:07,020
it was really bad. I'm done. I'll tell
you. It was bad, you know? Um, no,

67
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:10,090
it was, it was just like,
it was still weirdest thing.

68
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:15,150
You'd been in an in an airport and just
feeling like you were in America and

69
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:19,210
then you'd get on ATA and you literally
felt like you were leaving a war torn

70
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:20,044
country.

71
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:23,830
Like you just look around like what the
fuck did all these extras come from?

72
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,080
Am I, am I in a my, in some fucking, uh,

73
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:29,140
George Clooney movie that's
some important George,

74
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:33,340
one of those selling arms
for some shit, you know,

75
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:39,540
a very important story that needed to be
tell w told we are filmmakers and this

76
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:43,490
is what we do. You know George,

77
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:47,120
they said this script was floating around
Hollywood for a while. Well, you know,

78
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,740
of good looking and I said I'm going
to do it. So it got made. Um, oh,

79
00:04:51,741 --> 00:04:56,320
I got a call out fucking
Michael Rappaport. Okay, okay.

80
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:56,841
And you know,

81
00:04:56,841 --> 00:05:00,140
you would think that I'm going to call
him out for the fact that his resting

82
00:05:00,141 --> 00:05:04,130
face, you never heard of resting bitch
face. You know what his face looks like.

83
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,850
It looks like.

84
00:05:04,850 --> 00:05:08,390
Do you remember that face Danny Ainge
would make after he got called for a foul?

85
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,230
That's what his resting
face looks like. All right.

86
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:15,510
Now I love this man except
what he talks about.

87
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:18,980
I've never seen somebody hate on
Boston sports the way he does. Right?

88
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,580
So he wrote some more
bullshit about Boston sports.

89
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:24,770
So I call him up breaking
his balls going through,

90
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,180
you know what you wrote us in true
laughing. We have a great fucking time.

91
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,710
He goes on the Internet like
some real housewife whore.

92
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:37,490
Right? And you know what
he said? He said, wow,

93
00:05:37,491 --> 00:05:42,491
bill Burgess called me up
like a threatening make
blah blah blah and all this

94
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:45,560
fucking, hey, he's out.

95
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:49,850
He's tweeting like some Instagram
whore that's just trying to get fucking

96
00:05:50,210 --> 00:05:52,760
followers. I don't understand it Michael,

97
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:54,560
if somebody send you
into this clip right now,

98
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:59,180
I even told them how fucking he
was being above Boston sports.

99
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:03,650
Nike. I guess he was freaking out that,

100
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,030
that the Celtics might get
Kevin Durant, which um,

101
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,330
you know, who's kidding deal
with the whole free agency game?

102
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:13,490
This is how it works as a fan.

103
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:18,920
Everybody doesn't like it unless
the free agent comes to their team.

104
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,440
That's basically it. But
at the end of the day,

105
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,650
even when they do come to your
team in the back of your head,

106
00:06:24,651 --> 00:06:25,850
you know it's bullshit,

107
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,543
right?

108
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,580
I mean whatever. Yeah. Ut you're
getting fucked over by your team.

109
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:33,230
You want to go make some more money, fine.

110
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,370
But I'm talking when you're an elite
fucking player and you go to pile on

111
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:41,270
another fucking team. And I'm talking
as a Celtics Fan. When we did that in,

112
00:06:41,271 --> 00:06:41,661
what was it?

113
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:46,661
Oh eight the only thing that made it
decent was that the Lakers had a bunch of

114
00:06:47,251 --> 00:06:50,580
free agents. So we met in the
finals and it was sort of,

115
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,720
it was like the 80s in that those two
teams were in the finals back to back

116
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:58,270
years. But I mean it was, it was bullshit.

117
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,680
Like I don't look at the o eight
Celtics, like it was a blur.

118
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,420
We went from last place to first place.

119
00:07:04,421 --> 00:07:07,630
We won the fucking thing and then we
played them again next year in the finals

120
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:12,760
and the referee's called 9,000 files on
us. And like 15 on the fucking Lakers.

121
00:07:12,761 --> 00:07:15,830
And for some reason that was considered
a good game, seven to, I don't know,

122
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,930
but that's the NBA, you know, every once
in a while they have a mobbed up ref.

123
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,820
You know, Patrick Ewing
goes to the Knicks. Yeah.

124
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:29,800
You know, it's a
business. Um, but I think,

125
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:30,861
cause I,

126
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:35,861
I when I look at the NFL where
they got the parody there and uh,

127
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:39,700
all of a sudden, you know, the Seahawks
out of fucking nowhere can win one,

128
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:44,020
you know, fucking patriots
stunk for fucking ever.

129
00:07:44,021 --> 00:07:48,610
All of a sudden we got good, you go up,
you go down these guys when those guys,

130
00:07:48,611 --> 00:07:48,791
you know,

131
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:53,500
it's nice and fucking everybody kind of
has a chance now and that's been great.

132
00:07:53,501 --> 00:07:56,620
Their ratings are better than ever
as far as I know. And I think the,

133
00:07:56,621 --> 00:08:01,621
the route that the NBA is going is they
create these super teams and people hate

134
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,830
them so much that they watch
rooting for them to lose.

135
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:10,990
And um, I dunno, I liked it better.
I mean back in the day, like I said,

136
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,580
there was free agency
in that type of shit,

137
00:08:12,581 --> 00:08:15,400
but it wasn't just the way it is now.

138
00:08:15,401 --> 00:08:20,010
The amount of times where people pull
the old Johnny Damon where you fall,

139
00:08:20,011 --> 00:08:23,080
I guess Daymond one with the red sox
and then like the next year or whatever,

140
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:26,950
he goes through the fucking Yankees. It's
just like what Jesus Christ. Can you,

141
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,160
can you ease your way around the fact
that it's just a business and it's all

142
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:34,870
about money, you know? Um, I dunno,

143
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:39,430
I actually don't know how Kevin Duran
really helps the warriors in a way.

144
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:40,660
You know,

145
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:45,660
they had their two guys that were
the guys and then he's coming in and,

146
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:49,000
and a lot of ways he's
at least number two,

147
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,980
depending on what you think
about the fucking, uh,

148
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,370
the fucking honor roll student there. Um,

149
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,370
I dunno. I know people say they
just want to win, but I don't,

150
00:09:01,371 --> 00:09:04,000
I think egos get hurt when you know, you,

151
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:08,850
you used to get 25 points a game and
now you're down to like 21 or 19.

152
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,850
I Dunno. We'll see. What the fuck
happens. But uh, that sucked.

153
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,130
I was really hoping he was going to stay
in Oklahoma. I'm not gonna lie to you.

154
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,980
I was hoping that, uh, you know,

155
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:22,530
after last year where they
were up three games to one,

156
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,290
that they were going in
the off season to be like,

157
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:28,470
you know what the fuck happened? We
don't know how, we don't know how to win.

158
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,930
We don't know how to close somebody out.

159
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:35,580
And what I loved about
watching the warriors come
back against Oklahoma as much

160
00:09:35,581 --> 00:09:39,780
as I was rooting for Oklahoma is
you got to watch a championship team

161
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,830
like w w what the warriors did
be in down three games to one.

162
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:49,390
Coming back in that series was,
it was fucking hilarious to me.

163
00:09:49,391 --> 00:09:51,550
Like watching them, it was like,
you remember the horror movie?

164
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:55,240
Like they never changed their pace
when they were down. They didn't panic.

165
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,610
They just kept coming. You know,

166
00:09:57,730 --> 00:10:02,620
it was like those old school
monster movies from the
80s where the fucking Jason

167
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:07,090
Guy, right, is just walking
in. The victim is running away.

168
00:10:07,510 --> 00:10:10,320
He's the victims running
the monsters walking.

169
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,670
But the person running keeps
looking over their shoulder.

170
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:15,100
So they keep tripping
over logs and shit. Right.

171
00:10:15,101 --> 00:10:18,640
So eventually the fucking deal with the
hatchet walks them down and puts him out

172
00:10:18,641 --> 00:10:19,960
of their misery. That's what,

173
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:25,680
that's what fucking the
warriors did to Oklahoma. Yeah.

174
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:29,800
Geez, I'm such, was that too sophisticated
for you? You know, I got to tell you,

175
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:36,280
watching the warriors come back against
Oklahoma was like watching Friday the

176
00:10:36,281 --> 00:10:40,570
13th part three. Oh Geez. Um,

177
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:46,740
so I've seen a bunch of teams do
that be better than the other team.

178
00:10:46,961 --> 00:10:49,930
They just didn't know how to fucking
win. And then what happens is,

179
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,230
as a sports fan, you get to
watch them learn how to win.

180
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,880
You get to watch him. We'll share as a
faculty, that's what you get to watch.

181
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:00,550
Unless the best guy goes, you know what?

182
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:05,551
I don't feel like learning that's going
to go join the team that came back and

183
00:11:06,101 --> 00:11:10,510
kicked our ass. I mean, can you
imagine if movies were like that?

184
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:11,630
Yeah.

185
00:11:11,630 --> 00:11:15,600
All right. There's like the nerd
getting beat up by the bully. You know,

186
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:18,750
there's like five nerds getting beat
up by these five bullies, right?

187
00:11:18,751 --> 00:11:21,030
It's five on five, right?

188
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:26,130
And then the third act is not the fucking
nerds figure out how to beat down the

189
00:11:26,131 --> 00:11:29,310
bullies. One of the nerds
joints, the other bullies,

190
00:11:29,311 --> 00:11:34,180
and then helps them go back and
beat up all his friends. I mean,

191
00:11:34,181 --> 00:11:37,720
granted, I guess that kind of be
funny if you're a sick fuck like me,

192
00:11:37,721 --> 00:11:40,660
but at the end of the day, I mean
I that kind of movie is that,

193
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:43,650
well,

194
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:46,570
maybe act two is that he goes to fucking
golden state and the next three is he

195
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:49,510
comes back and he has one of
those Lebron James type movies.

196
00:11:50,470 --> 00:11:53,980
I don't fucking know. All
I know is a, you know,

197
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:55,990
I kinda got back into the NBA this year.

198
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:59,050
I started watching the Celtics and
that type of shit and that was a great

199
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:03,880
rivalry out west and now it's
no more. Did you hear what

200
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,900
Chiles Bark Barkley? Oh, it's
a great Boston named dude.

201
00:12:07,901 --> 00:12:12,901
Fucking chows Barkley said
fucking Kevin Durant's a cheetah.

202
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,500
Not Cheating like Tom Brady. That
was bullshit. Cheek like Kevin Duran.

203
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:24,820
He's not on our team, so I'll hold
them to the fizz feet to the fire.

204
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,500
Um, uh,

205
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,630
no cheating like Jim or say,

206
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,470
okay.

207
00:12:34,470 --> 00:12:37,050
He said that. Yeah, he's trying to
cheat his way to a championship.

208
00:12:37,051 --> 00:12:39,360
He used the wrong word, but I
understand what he's saying. He's just,

209
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:42,990
he's just a fucking, yeah, he
just, he left the nerd table.

210
00:12:42,991 --> 00:12:46,200
He CA's go to the bully table and then
he's going to come back and beat up the

211
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,700
notes. That'd be like, well, look, I'll
make, I'm a tough guy over here. Um,

212
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,150
isn't it amazing how much
taller Kevin Durant is than me?

213
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:55,110
And I'm still giving him shit.

214
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:58,950
That's the wonderful thing
about podcasting is you can
fucking talk shit within

215
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:02,750
the safety of your own living
room. All right, whatever.

216
00:13:02,751 --> 00:13:06,980
I'm going to get off this fucking
topic, but, uh, I did in fact to confirm

217
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:11,910
Michael Rappaport's real housewife
tweet, by the way, is there anyone,

218
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,260
can somebody please Photoshop him into
one of those real housewife fucking

219
00:13:15,261 --> 00:13:16,094
things?

220
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:21,440
We had a great conversation laughing our
balls off when we came to an agreement

221
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:24,560
in the end of it and
that Danny Ainge look in,

222
00:13:24,561 --> 00:13:26,880
motherfucker goes on the Internet and he,

223
00:13:26,881 --> 00:13:31,881
he tweets 180 letters or less about me.

224
00:13:33,770 --> 00:13:37,100
By the way, I have to apologize for a,
I love Michael Rep for it. I, you know,

225
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:38,991
every time I see him,

226
00:13:38,991 --> 00:13:41,640
I always feel like this is the last
time I'm ever gonna see him. You know,

227
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:44,300
there's just something about him,
even though he's younger than me,

228
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,860
he just moves around like he's in his
eighties. I think he has that disease,

229
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:51,890
you know that disease Brad Pitt had in
that movie where he was like a fucking

230
00:13:51,891 --> 00:13:56,200
old baby. Whenever the fuck happened.
I don't know if that's what he wrote.

231
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,620
He reminds no, I was just a
fable. Right. Where's it called?

232
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:03,710
The fairy tale. Whatever. He fucking,
he's like that, you know, you know,

233
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:05,990
like when a fucking eight
year old looks like this 70,

234
00:14:05,991 --> 00:14:07,980
whatever that disease
is called. [inaudible]

235
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,643
um,

236
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,510
I was going to see George
Meichin. That's not,

237
00:14:12,511 --> 00:14:15,150
that wasn't the guy who was the
guy who played on Ohio state.

238
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:19,890
I went to Portland. That poor passed
it. The microfractures in his feet,

239
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:24,330
like he's playing in China
now. I can't remember.

240
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,820
I'm thinking is haven Moses. And I
only play for the Broncos in the 70s.

241
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:34,540
I want to say his name was George, wasn't
it? Okay. We got to look this up now.

242
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,670
How's State Ohio?

243
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,450
How State? Uh, Portland

244
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:50,670
micro fracture. Mike, not microbrewery.
Get the fuck out of my growth.

245
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,423
Breweries are the worst today.

246
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,863
Okay.

247
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,700
All right. What's his name?
What's his name? Greg [inaudible].

248
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,330
Michael Rappaport has Greg Oden disease.

249
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:06,673
Okay.

250
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,350
It does it like Greg Oden.

251
00:15:08,351 --> 00:15:12,610
He got paid a ton of fucking money and
he didn't follow through if he got paid.

252
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:15,570
The, the, the, uh, national, uh,

253
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,880
podcasting association drafted him,

254
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:23,170
number one to come on to, into the
podcasting world to talk about sports,

255
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:26,170
thinking that he was going to be unfair.

256
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:29,080
No thinking that he was going
to be biased and fair. I came,

257
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:31,750
you fucking talk this morning. Oh my God,

258
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:35,560
I can't wait to do his
podcast again. You know,

259
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,790
who's kidding, who were both a couple of
real housewives? You know what I mean?

260
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:43,000
I think I'm slightly better looking
than him though. Slightly, you know,

261
00:15:43,030 --> 00:15:47,440
and a little more mobile, you know,
I think I bring a lot more to a team.

262
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,360
I'm like Spike [inaudible], right? Utility
player him. I don't know what he is.

263
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:56,020
He's like a fucking Rappaport's
like a fucking, you know,

264
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:01,570
he's like dead d h You know,
his career's over, you know,

265
00:16:01,571 --> 00:16:04,120
he can't touch his toes, so they
can't have him play first base.

266
00:16:04,121 --> 00:16:08,320
He just sits on the bench seat
and sunflower seeds gets up three,

267
00:16:08,321 --> 00:16:10,810
four times a game. Squinting
into the fucking Sun.

268
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,650
He just sneaks through the fences,
grounds out and do a double play.

269
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:17,380
Kills the rally, you know? But
he's got such a big contract,

270
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:18,313
they can't get rid of him.

271
00:16:20,740 --> 00:16:21,573
Okay.

272
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:24,560
He's like Greg Luzinski. If you
went on a diet, I let him know.

273
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,290
No disrespect to Greg
Lissitzky. All right.

274
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,410
I don't know what the fuck I'm talking
about here. Oh, Formula One. Right.

275
00:16:30,710 --> 00:16:31,170
Okay.

276
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:34,860
I needed to apologize. Um,
because when I was say,

277
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:38,700
when I watched the Austrian Grand Prix
that it was like fucking days of thought

278
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:42,390
and I said Louis Hamilton was
like the Tom Cruise, the upstart.

279
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:47,190
I add a completely wrong and I want to
thank everybody on Twitter that set me

280
00:16:47,191 --> 00:16:51,240
straight so eloquently.
Hey, fuck stick. Um,

281
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:55,710
I guess Lewis Hamilton, he's been,
he's, he's won at three times.

282
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:01,940
He's a 31 fucking years old and he's
already won the a for me one championship

283
00:17:02,161 --> 00:17:02,791
three times.

284
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:07,791
He won it in 2008 2014 and 2015
Nico Rosberg has never won.

285
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:14,220
So the reality is, is that
Nico was the Tom Cruise, right?

286
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:18,750
And Louis Hamilton is the val Kilmer.
He's the ice man. That's right.

287
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:21,420
Ice Man. I am dangerous.

288
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:26,560
And then Lewis Hamilton clicks his teeth
together for no fucking reason. Right?

289
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:31,430
They're all sweaty and shit. I Dunno.

290
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:35,000
All I know is the British Grand Prix is a,

291
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:39,920
is this fucking ah, is this
Sunday and that dude toto,

292
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:42,020
I swear to God, that's his fucking nick.

293
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:46,430
All I want to do when I wake up in the
morning is not, see the team crash.

294
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:52,150
Um, sat down with them. It was
just like, listen, alright,

295
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:57,630
right. Stop fucking driving into each
other mate. Whatever the fuck he said.

296
00:17:57,631 --> 00:18:00,900
I don't know where he's from. I think
he's just, I think he is from Austria.

297
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:05,220
Who knows. I'm new to this sport and
I just like throwing up shit as fact.

298
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:06,930
You know what I mean? And why would I,

299
00:18:06,931 --> 00:18:11,550
why would I actually waste the time to
read up on this sport when I can just

300
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:15,180
make big fucking statements and people
on Twitter will correct me anyways,

301
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:18,120
you know, then I don't have to look
it up. All I gotta do is just scroll,

302
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,670
you know, that's why these kids are
so fucking dumb today. You know,

303
00:18:23,671 --> 00:18:27,600
they don't read books the way I
used to, you know, three hours in,

304
00:18:27,601 --> 00:18:31,200
I'm 17 pages in my fucking a ds
off the fucking chart. Right.

305
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,980
Sitting there reading about Tom
Sawyer. You don't think about,

306
00:18:34,981 --> 00:18:39,981
I dunno what you know the Queen Mary God
knows whatever was said in that fucking

307
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:44,670
book that made me think of
something else. Apples houses,

308
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,410
some sort of arsenic in there.

309
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,610
And how many apples would you have to
do eat to actually poison yourself?

310
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,750
You know, eat so many fucking
apples. What do you think?

311
00:18:54,890 --> 00:18:58,530
There's arsenic assumption, you
know the apple, some sort of poison.

312
00:18:58,531 --> 00:19:00,150
I can't remember what, but if
you ate enough of them, right,

313
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:04,590
you'd actually die in that. Somebody would
actually bet to say eulogy. You know,

314
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:09,790
an apple a day does in fact
keep the doctor away. But a,

315
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:13,780
you know, eat 42 of them. You're
gonna fucking die. But you know what?

316
00:19:13,781 --> 00:19:17,620
He died the fruity. Whoa. Um,

317
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,820
anyways, let's, let's read some of the
fucking horse shit here for this week.

318
00:19:21,821 --> 00:19:25,480
Let's read some of the
advertising. Shall We? Is this,

319
00:19:25,481 --> 00:19:29,950
it is just a simple safe. What
does that sound like? Bad food.

320
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:35,110
All right. No, it isn't simple. Safe.
All right. Hallux Helix. You're unique.

321
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:39,850
You don't waste, you don't
walk like everyone else talk
like everyone else talk,

322
00:19:39,851 --> 00:19:44,710
walk, shoot. Shit that sounded
like doing that Marine Corps.

323
00:19:45,070 --> 00:19:48,500
I'm going to teach you how
to walk. Talk to Chad Parker.

324
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,940
You know I've turned my core. All
right. You're unique, everybody.

325
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:56,140
You don't walk like everyone else
talk like everyone else are three like

326
00:19:56,141 --> 00:19:56,974
everyone else.

327
00:19:57,130 --> 00:20:02,130
So why is your mattress your so why is
your mattresses so why is your mattress

328
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:06,983
Jenny spelled mattress.

329
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,373
Okay,

330
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:13,390
well how do you spell mistress? So why
is your mattress one size fits all? Gee,

331
00:20:13,391 --> 00:20:14,290
I don't know.

332
00:20:17,110 --> 00:20:22,110
I Dunno cause you fucking cause it fits
because a truly customized mattress will

333
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:27,270
cost you five or 10,000
bucks. Ah, that's the reason.

334
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:31,980
Who the fuck has the money to do that?
They should get audited immediately.

335
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:35,970
Do you know I was watching one of those
Barrett Jacksons one time and they had

336
00:20:35,971 --> 00:20:36,804
one of those,

337
00:20:37,380 --> 00:20:42,210
those GM that Pereda Prague
progress fucking elephant van there.

338
00:20:42,930 --> 00:20:47,230
Somebody spent four point $1 million on
that fucking thing and was excited they

339
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:48,790
got a good deal. You know what I mean?

340
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,010
That guy either needs to get audited or
he has his wife bound and gagged in a

341
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:57,610
fucking closet. How you
pull the, hey, hey honey,

342
00:20:57,611 --> 00:21:02,530
look what I spent $4 million on a giant
fucking toaster that you can drive.

343
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,113
Okay.

344
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:09,520
What do you mean? Why did
I do that? Oh, go. I liked,

345
00:21:09,550 --> 00:21:12,380
I thought it was a good
deal. Fuck you lady. Right?

346
00:21:12,950 --> 00:21:14,870
What are these things called? GM Parade.

347
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,210
This is still the advertising
parade of progress.

348
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:22,850
I used to know what these things
were called. Parade a progress image.

349
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:27,950
The GM Futurliner looked that
fucking thing up. I mean, granted,

350
00:21:27,951 --> 00:21:29,090
it's kind of cool, but it is,

351
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:34,091
it's like an easy bake oven that you can
drive and somebody paid four point $1

352
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,790
million for that fucking thing,
you know? And all I said,

353
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:41,690
all I could think was what was he doing
in 2008 when the fucking economy crashed

354
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:45,590
other than doing fucking cartwheels out
the back door of whatever fucking bank

355
00:21:45,591 --> 00:21:50,420
he worked at. Oh bill was that
social commentary. You freckled cut?

356
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,270
Just shut up and read the advertising.
All right, up. Here we go.

357
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:57,440
Hello everybody. Helix. I'm going to
read this like a fucking yoga instructor.

358
00:21:57,470 --> 00:22:01,970
You're unique. You don't walk like
anyone else. Talk like anyone else,

359
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,510
they're asleep like anyone else. So
why is your mattress one size fits all?

360
00:22:06,140 --> 00:22:10,340
Because they truly customize mattress
will cost you five to 10,000 bucks.

361
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,700
And how many starving
children could that feed?

362
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:19,220
40 50 million for only half a cent a day.

363
00:22:19,430 --> 00:22:24,430
Somehow you can give somebody three
square meals on Ethiopian Airlines.

364
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,010
All right, for cuss your five
to 10,000 bucks until now.

365
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:33,011
So go to hellickson.sleep.com answer a
few simple questions and they'll run a 3d

366
00:22:33,741 --> 00:22:38,741
biomechanical model of your body through
the [inaudible] proprietary algorithms

367
00:22:40,221 --> 00:22:41,300
they've developed it.

368
00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,370
Doesn't that sound like a bunch of
bullshit January proprietary algorithms?

369
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:50,000
I can't say it to most of the good a.

370
00:22:50,001 --> 00:22:53,540
They developed with the help of the
world's leading Aragon nomics and

371
00:22:53,541 --> 00:22:55,820
biomechanics experts. The results,

372
00:22:55,821 --> 00:22:59,060
the most comfortable mattress
you've ever slept on.

373
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:01,080
Helix customers.

374
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:05,900
How Alex report a 30% improvement in
overall sleep quality. And for couples,

375
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:11,360
they customize each each
side of the mattress. Oh,

376
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:12,194
that's great.

377
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,700
Your mattress arrives at your door in
about a week and shipping is 100% free.

378
00:23:16,701 --> 00:23:21,701
That's why everyone from GQ magazine
to Forbes aren't those the same people.

379
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:25,670
You get to the top of your bank and
then all of a sudden you're like,

380
00:23:25,671 --> 00:23:26,540
I'm going to have it yet.

381

fucking Rolex are all talking about helic

it out. And if you don't love it,

383
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:41,270
they'll pick it up for free
and give you 100% refund.

384
00:23:41,271 --> 00:23:43,580
No questions asked. Go
to hell. You know what?

385
00:23:43,581 --> 00:23:45,800
A lot of homeless people are gonna be
getting a good nights then cause there's

386
00:23:45,801 --> 00:23:50,150
no fucking way you can resell that.
Kenya or Kenya. I don't fucking know.

387
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,350
Alright, I'm just dump it on a sidewalk.

That's what I want to do.

422
00:26:11,590 --> 00:26:16,180
Especially in Scotland where they had
the nerve to call our fucking orange

423
00:26:16,181 --> 00:26:18,680
headed cunt of fucking
orange headed country.

424

calling an orange headed content,

orange handed content. Amy, why

427
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,550
we have very few here.

428
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,040
Every once in a while they
went for president when
they're in between seasons of

429
00:26:36,041 --> 00:26:38,170
their reality show. Okay.

430
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,760
What's great about our country is
everybody truly does get a chance.

431
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:47,280
Unlike your countries. I have no
fucking idea what's going on over there.

432
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:51,150
Evidently, England decided to not
be part of the European Union.

433
00:26:51,151 --> 00:26:53,760
Is that what happened? I
love how like as an American,

434
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:57,490
I'm supposed to know this shit,
a union that I'm not into. I,

435
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:59,100
I understand what's going on over there.

436
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,830
The banks are sewing up
all your fucking countries.

437
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:06,240
It's like when you fucking
buy a a a Co op, you know,

438
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,090
versus a condo. You buy a Condo,

439
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,300
the person next to you can be a
fucking junkie who gives a shit.

440
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:16,770
You still got your condo. But
if you're in a co op playoffs,

441
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:19,800
if you're in a co-op, this
is the deal. What you're,

442
00:27:19,801 --> 00:27:21,240
you're not buying an apartment.

443
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:24,120
What you're doing is you're
buying shares in the building,

444
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:28,500
but now you're tied in with the whole
building. So basically if your neighbors,

445
00:27:28,501 --> 00:27:31,170
enough of your neighbors
go bankrupt and the whole,

446
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,670
the whole building goes under,

447
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:37,680
you lose your shares and you either have
to move out of your apartment or you go

448
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:41,100
back to renting it and you're like, wait
a minute, I thought I bought it. No,

449
00:27:41,101 --> 00:27:44,010
no, no sir. You bought
shares in the building.

450
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:50,100
You paid your way, but these other
kinds didn't. And because they didn't,

451
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,770
you go down to the bottom
of the lagoon with them.

452
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:58,020
That to me is what the European Union
is, right? And that's what banks want,

453
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:01,290
right? And they just fucking
bankrupt them. And, uh,

454
00:28:01,291 --> 00:28:03,870
I don't know what the fuck they do.
They play that little fucking game.

455
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:06,500
They buy low and then they
fucking go high. And I'll fuck,

456
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,390
could they pull the money
out and everybody falls in
their fucking ass and then

457
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,710
they got another castle. You know? I
think that that's how the economy works,

458
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,390
right? And it's all run
by shapeshifters. Okay.

459
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,650
Just shit like that. You know what I mean?

460
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,820
Especially when I'm in London and
those stupid fucking critics show up,

461
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,160
Ugh, fucking guys, critics are the
fucking worse. There's nothing you can do.

462
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,700
There's no show that you can have that
they're not going to rip the shit out of

463
00:28:35,701 --> 00:28:38,940
it. It's just fucking hilarious to
me. It's like I don't need critics.

464
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:43,140
All right. If I wanted to feel bad about
having a good show, I just call my mom.

465
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,070
I don't fucking need you to be doing
our job. You all right? Whatever.

466
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,640
All right. July 31st
everybody. Dublin, Ireland.

467
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:56,400
Alright, then August 1st I'm in
Belfast. I've never been there. Belfast,

468
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,880
Ireland, the fuck is his
Belfast UK. All right.

469
00:29:01,050 --> 00:29:05,970
It's Ireland. I think it's about time
England got the fuck out of there.

470
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,230
Um, can you imagine saying that
as American seriously, you know,

471
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:13,890
is we are putting up cheesecake
factories in the Middle East. All right.

472
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,860
August 1st, Belfast UK.

473
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,010
Um, August 2nd, I'm in
Galway, Ireland. Uh,

474
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:27,600
which is way out on the west coast and
evidently the closest airport is like a

475
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:29,820
fucking hour away from it. So I don't
understand what this is. This is,

476
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,580
it seems like, should I ruin it?

477
00:29:32,581 --> 00:29:34,650
And actually fucking
Google some pictures of it.

478
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:39,930
Call Away Ireland. Let's see. We got here.

479
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:45,430
Oh my God. Jesus Christ. I knew
it. I know. This is going to be,

480
00:29:45,610 --> 00:29:48,790
what are these fucking
a, which is a warlock,

481
00:29:48,791 --> 00:29:52,630
one of those fucking movies
type cities. Harry Potter.

482
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:56,840
Look at this fucking place. Oh my God.

483
00:29:56,841 --> 00:29:58,490
I'm only spending a day there.

484
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,713
Okay.

485
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:06,180
Wow. Look at the fucking castles.

486
00:30:06,181 --> 00:30:07,040
Holy Shit.

487
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:08,163
Right?

488
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,580
I'm going to drive in there, do the show,

489
00:30:11,581 --> 00:30:15,090
and then I got to drive right
back so I can make my flight.

490
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,560
What the fuck am I
going? Did I fuck it up?

491
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:22,960
Where am I going next? Alright,
I'm go to a [inaudible],

492
00:30:22,961 --> 00:30:26,660
then I fly to a Bristol, uh,

493
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,610
England and then Manchester, England, the,

494
00:30:30,611 --> 00:30:33,640
a sober, sophisticated Manchester.

495
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,430
I'm thinking that's going
to be a nice mellow crowd.

496
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:43,390
Fucking loaded ticks. Um, that's what
I'm anticipating in Manchester. I,

497
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,110
I'm anticipating they're going to be a
bunch of fucking lunatics, which is a,

498
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:51,700
which is fine by me. I, um, I
grew up Massachusetts, you know,

499
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:57,640
um, London, England, August 5th and
August 6th with the country critics. Uh,

500
00:30:57,641 --> 00:31:02,560
August 7th, I'll be in
Amsterdam and then August 8th,

501
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:07,960
I will be in Edinburgh, uh, for two shows.

502
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:11,950
All right. So we got a
late show too. Okay. Um,

503
00:31:12,550 --> 00:31:15,370
then I've got a couple days off where
I'll be hanging out with other orange

504
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:19,900
headed consts like myself. And
then August 11th, I'm in Germany,

505
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,070
Cologne, Germany, bodywash, Germany.

506
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,170
Then August 12th, I'm in Antwerp,
Belgium. Oh look at this.

507
00:31:29,470 --> 00:31:33,730
August 27th, I'm in Reno, Reno, Nevada,

508
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:35,770
Reno, Nevada.

509
00:31:35,890 --> 00:31:40,890
And at that point we will be only a
couple of months away from that fucking

510
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:45,250
kitchen. T V square headed, fucking safe,

511
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:52,560
crazy eyes smiling psycho from becoming
the next fucking president of the United

512
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:54,790
States. Oh, that's
going to be a rough one.

513
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,820
Watching all these ladies
saying how fucking,

514
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:59,890
what an important date is for women.

515
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,920
I guess it will be because a woman
will be elected president is just my

516
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:06,580
prediction here. All right.
But uh, Jesus Christ couldn't,

517
00:32:06,581 --> 00:32:09,970
we have gotten one that didn't
have 58 pending fucking felonies.

518
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:15,330
That's not a red flag. Anybody, you know,

519
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,780
I don't know. What are you going to do?
Those are our choices. I don't know why.

520
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,900
A fucking maniac who, you know,
doesn't know how to use email properly.

521
00:32:26,370 --> 00:32:31,140
You know, sending out
secrets to a friends.

522
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:36,020
Um, and then some fucking
guy who's a, I dunno,

523
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,950
who really should just
be a carnival barker.

524
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,330
I feel like Trump should just standing
next to some impossible game to win.

525
00:32:41,331 --> 00:32:44,060
Talking about how it's the
greatest game ever. You know,

526
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:47,210
who's he hits on underage chicks.
Um, I don't know. That's just, just,

527
00:32:47,211 --> 00:32:49,420
just the opinions of somebody who, uh,

528
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:54,080
can't pronounce words while he reads out
loud what he thought. He say that Cleo,

529
00:32:54,830 --> 00:32:58,940
that c a, that's the podcast here for
this, uh, this Thursday afternoon,

530
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:01,713
um,

531
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:04,380
could sell. Oh, I, you know what,

532
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:09,210
somebody please send me a fucking
whatever you see a Photoshop picture of

533
00:33:09,211 --> 00:33:13,200
fucking Rappaport's face on Danny Angel's
body when he played for the Celtics.

534
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,840
I really want to see that today.

535
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:16,680
You can do whatever the fuck
you want to do with my head.

536
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,210
You know, I don't give a fuck. Um,

537
00:33:21,630 --> 00:33:23,580
that's it. All right. I got
to go hit the elliptical.

538
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:26,910
So I'm not a fucking fat fuck at
the end of this writing season here.

539
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:29,700
Congratulations to Kevin Durant. Um,

540
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,080
okay.

541
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,610
On your next, uh, on your, on your
first championship rink. You know,

542
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,460
I want to put together a standup
tour like that. You know what I mean?

543
00:33:40,050 --> 00:33:43,500
I want to join like the, uh, like
if Louis C K and Dave Chappelle,

544
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,350
Dave Chappelle, we're doing like a standup
tour. I'd somehow like, I not know.

545
00:33:49,351 --> 00:33:51,480
I don't know. I do like
their next standup specials.

546
00:33:51,481 --> 00:33:56,190
I'll splice part of my hour
in there and get credit.

547
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:01,440
Uh, all right, that's it. Um, you guys
have a great weekend. You conscious

548
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:05,820
and I'll, uh, I'll talk to you on
Monday. Enjoy the music and, uh,

549
00:34:05,821 --> 00:34:10,250
another half hour of Monday morning
podcast back from yesteryear.

550
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:21,393
[inaudible]

551
00:34:45,890 --> 00:34:46,710
[inaudible]

552
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:49,600
Nah, go to bed. [inaudible]

553
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:56,400
my brain. [inaudible]

554
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:03,120
t c is

555
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:08,000
so to [inaudible]

556
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:13,670
[inaudible]

557
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,880
with die. Geez.

558
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,000
Hey, what's going on?

559
00:35:22,001 --> 00:35:26,080
Is this still press and this is the
Monday morning podcast that I'm actually

560
00:35:26,081 --> 00:35:29,850
doing from my [inaudible] home
phone rather than my cell phone.

561
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:34,740
I finally figured out how to call
in this, this, this, this, my space.

562
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,020
Uh, fucking Jesus Christ. I'm having
one of those weeks. All right.

563
00:35:41,021 --> 00:35:41,611
I just talk.

564
00:35:41,611 --> 00:35:44,820
I just babbled for 12 minutes and decided
that I didn't like it and now I have

565
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:47,070
to fucking start all over
again. I don't want to do this.

566
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,040
I don't want to do this.
You think I want to do this?

567
00:35:50,041 --> 00:35:53,670
I don't want to fucking do this. You know,

568
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:56,430
sometimes in life you gotta do what
you got. Yeah. You the only, yeah,

569
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:01,980
these fucking podcast, man. Yeah. How
long these things take? Seven weeks.

570
00:36:01,981 --> 00:36:06,180
I get on here, you know, I just babble.
It's fucking gold. Just half hour,

571
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:09,000
just running my goddamn mouth
out. And you have to think,

572
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:13,410
and then there's other times it's, it's
just, it's like shoveling wet snow.

573
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:14,730
And you know what?

574
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:17,460
I'm fucking sticking this one out
cause I'm not gonna start over again.

575
00:36:17,461 --> 00:36:20,100
Eight sometimes. You know what?
Sometimes you just not that funny.

576
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,000
You fucking minds broken up
or whatever. I don't know.

577
00:36:24,001 --> 00:36:28,140
Let's just get down to goddamn brass tax
here and I'll let you know what I got

578
00:36:28,141 --> 00:36:32,670
going on. All right. My name is
Bill Barr. This is my myspace page.

579
00:36:32,671 --> 00:36:36,630
This is my Monday morning podcast. I
do one of these every goddamn week.

580
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:42,100
Okay. Try to get people a nice laugh to
start off the fucking weeks. And a I,

581
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:45,930
we start off in a good mood and then I
ended up getting frustrated with my own

582
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,420
ineptness and then I ended
up just fucking, I dunno,

583
00:36:48,450 --> 00:36:52,020
I end up snapping and I
say fuck a lot. All right.

584
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:56,940
And uh, okay, let's get on with people
ask me questions. I answer them.

585
00:36:57,270 --> 00:36:59,280
Look at me. I'm just, you know,
I'm just blowing through this.

586
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:03,840
Just blowing through the explanations.
I usually take my time and explain this.

587
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:04,890
You know what this is like,

588
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,460
you ever like break your arm or
something and you go to school.

589
00:37:08,461 --> 00:37:12,120
The next day instance, the first kid
goes, hey man, what happened to your arm?

590
00:37:12,121 --> 00:37:16,710
Right? And you give them every
last fucking detail. Okay.

591
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:21,300
But then by the time you've told the
fucking story to like the 12th person,

592
00:37:21,330 --> 00:37:25,110
by the time the 13th person comes up to
you, you're like, I fucking fell down.

593
00:37:25,110 --> 00:37:27,570
All right with the fucking
thing happened. You know,

594
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,870
that's the mindset I'm in
right now as I do this podcast.

595
00:37:30,871 --> 00:37:35,871
After just blowing 12 minutes of
your rising time on my home phone,

596
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:40,300
I'm all right. Here we go. Let's get
down with this shit. Hey, let's get it.

597
00:37:40,310 --> 00:37:40,960
Get on with it.

598
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:45,960
I put up a new video because I am
desperately trying to get myself to become

599
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:50,100
part of the new millennium. Um,
it's right underneath the podcast.

600
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:52,620
If you look there,
you'll see a very blurry,

601
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:56,340
very blurry me in a Winnipeg jets shirt,
by the way, because I'm old school,

602
00:37:56,341 --> 00:37:58,470
old school hooky. Um,

603
00:37:58,471 --> 00:38:01,260
let's meet at the punchline in Atlanta
and before you watch the video,

604
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:03,480
I just want to give you a little
backstory of what happened. Uh,

605
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,760
I was actually a,

606
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:09,210
it was Thursday night and a couple of
weeks ago and it's one of my favorite

607
00:38:09,211 --> 00:38:12,720
clubs now. I was just having one of
these awesome sets where I was, uh,

608
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:16,830
I was really open and free and everything
was just flowing as opposed to this

609
00:38:16,831 --> 00:38:20,790
podcast, which feels very
arduous, free work like that.

610
00:38:20,810 --> 00:38:21,900
I used that word correctly.

611
00:38:23,610 --> 00:38:26,830
What the fuck is quest love learning
those fucking lime green pants and just

612
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:30,160
realized that I'm, anyways, I
was having one of these, um,

613
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,431
one of these just, you know,

614
00:38:32,431 --> 00:38:35,980
really open just great sets and I was
about 12 minutes and everybody was

615
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:38,740
laughing. Everybody's having a good
time. I was having a good time,

616
00:38:38,741 --> 00:38:43,300
but for some reason there was this lady
in the crowd and it wasn't enough that

617
00:38:43,301 --> 00:38:45,250
she felt my jokes were funny.

618
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,610
She was somehow agreeing with the
things that I was saying on stage.

619
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:52,360
So rather than laughing
at the end of every joke,

620
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,680
you know, when the punchline
came out, instead of laughing,

621
00:38:56,681 --> 00:39:01,480
she would just yell out
Sankyo after every joke,

622
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,240
you know, the rest of the crowd was,

623
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:07,200
would be laughing and then I would just
hear this woman's voice over everybody.

624
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,650
Hey Yo.

625
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:12,820
So this video picks up about
12 minutes into my set.

626
00:39:13,810 --> 00:39:18,160
She's already yelled saying Geo like
fucking 12 times. And I feel annoying.

627
00:39:18,161 --> 00:39:19,510
That is with me saying that to you.

628
00:39:19,511 --> 00:39:22,930
Just imagine being onstage
trying to keep the crowd,

629
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:26,770
trying to keep the fucking plate spinning
and somebody keeps yelling that shit

630
00:39:26,771 --> 00:39:27,011
out.

631
00:39:27,011 --> 00:39:32,011
So she yells it out for I guess basically
the sixth time and that's when I

632
00:39:32,171 --> 00:39:35,260
finally snapped. But I
snapped in a good way.

633
00:39:35,261 --> 00:39:38,920
I was proud of myself where I didn't
shop her head off and be overly mean.

634
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,950
It was kind of mean, but it
was definitely funny. And, um,

635
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:44,910
I just want to let you guys know I'm,

636
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,460
I'm going to start taping all
my sets because, uh, you know,

637
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:50,740
I riff a lot and I ended up, you know,

638
00:39:50,741 --> 00:39:55,180
missing a lot of good lines that I could
keep in my act and also random shit

639
00:39:55,181 --> 00:39:59,380
happens and I'm going to start posting
some of the random shit that, that, uh,

640
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:02,020
happens up here. Um,

641
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,950
unless people really start to enjoy these
and then they come out to my shows and

642
00:40:05,951 --> 00:40:07,930
then they deliberately
try to yell out something,

643
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,670
which is always the risk of it.

644
00:40:09,671 --> 00:40:12,520
But basically I like doing this kind of
thing because I want to give you guys

645
00:40:12,521 --> 00:40:16,240
some new, some new laughs without
having to burn any material.

646
00:40:16,241 --> 00:40:19,180
You know what I mean? I mean,
I'm not treading Reznor here.

647
00:40:19,181 --> 00:40:22,660
I can't just give away my
new hour for free. You know,

648
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:25,630
like he can, I'm jealous musicians, right?

649
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:28,540
They can just fucking put the
goddamn music out for free now.

650
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:33,370
And then everybody comes to their
shows and when they know all the words,

651
00:40:33,371 --> 00:40:37,690
they get to sing along. So it's
different than he can go. You know,

652
00:40:37,691 --> 00:40:40,600
we're going to break it down. Detroit,
we're going to break it down here, right?

653
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:41,050
And then he,

654
00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:44,830
then he slows the fucking song down and
then everybody go whatever things the

655
00:40:44,831 --> 00:40:47,860
music level down and everybody sings
along. You can't do that with jokes.

656
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,910
Maybe if I started singing
my jokes, maybe I'll do that.

657
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:56,680
I'll come with a fucking
Ukulele on stage, you know,

658
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:00,190
I could fucking sing. That's
why guitar racks blow up,

659
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,980
man telling you fucking telling you.

660
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:06,070
I heard about some kid in
Massachusetts. He's a kid,

661
00:41:06,850 --> 00:41:10,450
he's been putting funny songs up on
Youtube for the last year and he just sold

662
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:14,570
out the comedy connection. It's like
17 fucking years old, you know, long.

663
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:18,130
It took me to sell at
the comedy connection. 15
fucking years telling jokes.

664
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:23,530
You know why? Because I don't sing.
I would just sing my God damn jokes.

665
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:28,420
What's the deal with labs? Everybody?

666
00:41:28,660 --> 00:41:32,950
If I would just do that, if I would
just do that, I don't know you.

667
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:38,210
I don't know what would happen. You
know something you always want to think,

668
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:40,280
you know, if I just did
that, then I'd be here.

669
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:42,680
You never think of all
the failed guitar racks.

670
00:41:43,430 --> 00:41:46,460
You know the ones that you guys don't
see. You just see the successful ones.

671
00:41:46,461 --> 00:41:50,210
You know the ones with their half hour
specials, the ones selling up theaters.

672
00:41:50,660 --> 00:41:54,350
All right? You don't see the ones that
opened for me when I go to Portland,

673
00:41:54,351 --> 00:41:58,640
Oregon, or at least when I did back
in the day, way back in the day,

674
00:41:58,700 --> 00:41:59,533
10 years ago,

675
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:03,770
he's played a club called Harvey's and
all I remember was the walls were green

676
00:42:03,830 --> 00:42:07,850
and the guy used to, he used
to give the whole show away,

677
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:12,500
which basically he would
have telemarketers call
people up and just be like,

678
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,190
Hey, guess what? You've won tickets to it.

679
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:19,850
You went for free tickets to a comedy
show. And the people would be like,

680
00:42:19,851 --> 00:42:24,260
Holy Shit, how the fuck did I win?
Knows I didn't even enter the contest,

681
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:26,300
you know? Well,

682
00:42:26,301 --> 00:42:31,040
you won them because a comedy was
not selling well 10 years ago.

683
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:33,470
So these to give away, basically
they've given away the show.

684
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:38,030
He'd walked into this fucking
place. It'd be a Tuesday, you know,

685
00:42:38,031 --> 00:42:39,980
I'd tell Mosey and, and I'm
thinking, all right, the Tuesday,

686
00:42:39,981 --> 00:42:43,640
it'll be half full. No one knows who
the fuck I am. I lean on the Mike stand,

687
00:42:43,641 --> 00:42:44,930
I'll riff, I'll get some new jokes.

688
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:48,140
And you would walk in there and you
would think that Springsteen was going to

689
00:42:48,141 --> 00:42:48,860
come off.

690
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:53,860
It was jam packed 400 fucking drunk ass
people who didn't know me and did not

691
00:42:54,861 --> 00:42:57,950
give a shit whether the
show was good or not really,

692
00:42:57,980 --> 00:43:02,270
because they already felt like they
had already won. They got free tickets.

693
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,150
So you would go up there and it
would just be, it'd be a fucking zoo.

694
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:10,020
It would be an absolute zoo. And,
uh, a lot of lumberjacks that,

695
00:43:10,030 --> 00:43:11,900
that was the vibe I got. You know,

696
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:15,470
Oregon has a lot of trees and you'd
be down there in Portland and you'd be

697
00:43:15,471 --> 00:43:20,210
thinking, all right, it's very crunchy,
very sort of a progressive. But,

698
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:22,460
uh, you know, those cuts
don't come out to shows.

699
00:43:23,060 --> 00:43:24,260
The lumberjacks would come out,

700
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:27,770
they'd be screaming and yelling and eating
burgers that would have fried eggs on

701
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:31,580
the top of them. And, uh, and it sucked.

702
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:33,530
And I don't even know why
I'm talking about this.

703
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:37,540
I already forgot I spaced halfway
through that fucking story because, um,

704
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:40,490
cause that's the mindset I'm
in this week. I, you know,

705
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:42,620
is I got a zillion fucking
things I gotta take care of.

706
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:47,750
Cause I'm on my way to Pittsburgh this
week and I'm flying in a day early, uh,

707
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:48,800
to do, um,

708
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,920
I'm doing a lot of radio this week cause
I'm going to try to sell that fucking

709
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:56,780
place out. I want to be on a wd
VIII with Randy Bowman this week.

710
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:01,880
Um, and if I had any fucking brains, I
would've looked that up and giving you a,

711
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:04,880
I don't know, it's 100 point something.

712
00:44:04,881 --> 00:44:07,120
I think if you live in Pittsburgh,

713
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:09,890
you can listen to me and I'll be young
and say, you listen to me in the morning,

714
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,050
Wednesday morning, Thursday
morning and Friday morning,

715
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:14,630
and then you come out on the
weekend, you check out my show.

716
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:18,110
Just a little love ago. I'd just
come onto my goddamn show. Okay.

717
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:20,930
I don't know fucking, I don't
want to tell you. Um, please,

718
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:21,860
I don't want to stand there alone.

719
00:44:21,890 --> 00:44:25,520
I care that that mall is
the most depressing fucking
mall in America for those

720
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:26,900
of you who've never been to it.

721
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:31,790
That Pittsburgh Improv is in
a mall called the stacks. Um,

722
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:34,170
why did they call it
the stacks? Basically?

723
00:44:34,171 --> 00:44:37,620
Because I guess the mall
used to be a steel mill.

724
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:39,421
Okay.

725
00:44:39,421 --> 00:44:44,040
When we used to have industry in this
country before they started telling us

726
00:44:44,041 --> 00:44:47,550
that everything was too expensive to
make in this country. So they had to,

727
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:48,384
you know,

728
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:52,710
ship it to a third world country and
have some eight-year-old killed kid make

729
00:44:52,711 --> 00:44:54,690
fucking spittoons or
whatever the fuck it is.

730
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:59,100
You make an a goddamn steel steel mill,
right. Rather than being like, no.

731
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:03,030
All Americans are involved with unions
and they want health insurance and they

732
00:45:03,031 --> 00:45:06,180
want to get paid for their work.
They, they, they just, they,

733
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,730
they just fucking picked up and
left. But this is what they did.

734
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:13,050
They knocked down the
factory, but they, uh,

735
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,340
they kept the stacks.

736
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,070
Okay.

737
00:45:16,070 --> 00:45:20,120
Just to remind you that, that people,
uh, you know, there's, this reminded me,

738
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:26,720
might even be a Poulter guys. You
know, you move the headstones,

739
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:29,180
but you didn't move the bodies.

740
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:34,880
That's what they did at that
mall. They moved the factory,

741
00:45:34,881 --> 00:45:36,740
but they left the smoke stacks.

742
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:43,060
That's what they did to remind you that
hardworking Americans used to have jobs

743
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:48,551
there and they could support
their families and they
made shit out of steel that

744
00:45:49,341 --> 00:45:52,970
other Americans would then buy, okay?

745
00:45:53,090 --> 00:45:57,320
And the dollar was worth something,
but they got rid of all that.

746
00:45:57,350 --> 00:46:02,330
They shifted somewhere else and in
its wake they left fucking cheesecake

747
00:46:02,331 --> 00:46:06,830
factory's lucky jeans and the
fucking cold stone creamery.

748
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:08,193
Okay?

749
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,780
But in tribute to all those
people that they fucked over,

750
00:46:11,990 --> 00:46:14,450
they left the chimneys. Isn't that nice?

751
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:19,370
A little nod to the past and
now they're fucking kids.

752
00:46:19,371 --> 00:46:21,830
What are they doing? What
are they? Where do they work?

753
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,430
You haven't noticed that when you
meet people and they come up to you,

754
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:27,890
you ask them what the fuck they
do? You don't. You can't eat.

755
00:46:27,891 --> 00:46:32,890
You don't even know what it is. What
do you do? I worked in a steel mill,

756
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:36,340
okay. You work in a mill, there's
steel there and you work there.

757
00:46:36,341 --> 00:46:40,660
So you work with steel in a mill. I get
that. I understand what that job is.

758
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:43,480
What do you do? I'm the
Milkman. Okay. You're a man.

759
00:46:43,481 --> 00:46:48,040
There's milk and you fucking deliberate,
man. You're the milk man. I get it.

760
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:49,533
I fucking get it.

761
00:46:49,610 --> 00:46:52,960
You realize how many jobs there are
that people actually understand what the

762
00:46:52,961 --> 00:46:57,430
fuck it is you do now. There's very
few left. I'm a mailman. I'm a man.

763
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:01,150
I deliver mail. I'm the fucking
mail man. Back then they was simple,

764
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:05,080
simple fucking names. All right.

765
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,390
I'm a silver Smith. All
right? Smith meaning, uh,

766
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,630
like to, to hit with a hammer like
smite. And I would do it with silver.

767
00:47:13,690 --> 00:47:18,060
A fucking silversmith. All
right. There wasn't any, the uh,

768
00:47:18,110 --> 00:47:22,840
the regional director of the
fucking, you know, so I can't even,

769
00:47:22,870 --> 00:47:27,000
I can't even give you an
example of somebody's job.
I'm trying to think of the,

770
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,300
the, all these computer.

771
00:47:28,301 --> 00:47:32,800
I sit in a cubicle and make
somebody else's dream happen.

772
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:36,250
I'm telling you right now, man, it's
just sitting in a fucking cubicle.

773
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:38,140
Just do something rebellious today.

774
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:41,260
Just take one of the
screws out of your fake.

775
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:45,760
I don't really have an office wall that
they put in front of you to make you

776
00:47:45,761 --> 00:47:47,350
feel like you have half an office.

777
00:47:47,351 --> 00:47:51,820
But the reality is they don't want
you looking at other people. You know,

778
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:54,430
I think I've talked about this before.
Do you guys ever see that movie,

779
00:47:54,431 --> 00:47:57,820
the apartment starring a Jack Lemon?

780
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:00,130
If you see the beginning of that movie,

781
00:48:00,131 --> 00:48:04,330
that's what the cubicle area used to
look like. You still had a sea of people,

782
00:48:05,380 --> 00:48:05,771
you know,

783
00:48:05,771 --> 00:48:10,000
slugging away looking like a bunch of
goddamn salmon swimming upstream with

784
00:48:10,001 --> 00:48:11,500
fucking typewriters in front of them.

785
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:15,460
But they didn't have walls around them
like they were on punishment. You know,

786
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:18,820
you could look at the person
next to you shoot the shit,

787
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:22,000
but then somewhere along the line
they're like, oh, the fucking talking.

788
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:24,010
We can't have them looking at themselves.

789
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:28,840
They're literally treating you like
children. It's just, I don't know,

790
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:31,990
it's just fucking, it just blows my
mind. You know what I mean? I, I,

791
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:37,330
I'd rather sell drugs. All right.
Um, so anyways, this is the, yeah,

792
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:40,120
this is the Monday
morning podcast and, uh,

793
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:42,100
people send me questions
if you new to my page,

794
00:48:42,101 --> 00:48:45,370
if you haven't defected
to fucking Facebook,

795
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,850
like the fact that you
are, you know what I mean?

796
00:48:48,851 --> 00:48:50,890
I love these people go
into Facebook now, like,

797
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:56,430
like the same herd of assholes that
went from Friendster to my space.

798
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:01,960
Isn't, isn't gonna, you know, they're not
going to eventually end up over there.

799
00:49:01,961 --> 00:49:06,460
Like there's not going to be a bunch
of spam about ringtones and a bunch of

800
00:49:06,461 --> 00:49:09,640
whores with the bud cracks and
their titties hanging out, you know,

801
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:15,190
sending you generic emails trying to
make it seem like they didn't send it to

802
00:49:15,191 --> 00:49:16,150
everybody else,

803
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:20,320
but you realize that they did because
rather than calling you by your name,

804
00:49:20,321 --> 00:49:24,040
it just says, Hey, you love your page

805
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:26,260
by the way.

806
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,000
I'm the fucking Nokia phone whore
the month or whatever the hell they,

807
00:49:31,001 --> 00:49:35,590
you know, all those stupid beauty
contest things that they go to when, um,

808
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,290
I'm sticking it out here, man. All right.

809
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,930
And all you guys who all going over to
Facebook, you know what you're like,

810
00:49:40,990 --> 00:49:43,930
you like the, you ever see that movie,
that titanic where as those guys,

811
00:49:43,960 --> 00:49:47,980
you know who fucking jumped in into the
rafts all by themselves, those self,

812
00:49:47,981 --> 00:49:49,840
his sons of bitches who
were actually smart,

813
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:54,100
who listened to that voice that
says I need to fucking survive.

814
00:49:54,101 --> 00:49:57,040
Well maybe they are smart, then
maybe they realize that my space,

815
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:00,130
maybe my space is a
sinking ship. You know,

816
00:50:02,140 --> 00:50:03,670
I don't know. That'd be
actually kind of funny.

817
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:06,190
No it wouldn't because they've
already made their money off it.

818
00:50:06,191 --> 00:50:10,240
Rupert Murdoch already brought about
the same in $1 billion already fucking

819
00:50:10,690 --> 00:50:14,410
content. Um, all right, I
answered questions here.

820
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:20,140
I'm really just babbling here. Um, I
answered questions here every week.

821
00:50:20,141 --> 00:50:24,880
People send me questions. Um, I try to
answer them to the best of my ability.

822
00:50:24,940 --> 00:50:28,190
And uh, here we go. Here are the,
are the podcast for the week.

823
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:31,850
Um, oh and by the way,
when you watch my video,

824
00:50:31,851 --> 00:50:34,310
could you please send me a comment
if you like it or whatever.

825
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:36,140
Cause that's like a new thing
that I really want to start doing.

826
00:50:36,141 --> 00:50:40,580
Just putting some random moments up
there like that. Um, so, so let me,

827
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:43,940
let me know. Let me know what you think.
Okay. Question number one. Hey Bill,

828
00:50:43,941 --> 00:50:46,940
which one was better?
Mike Richters insane.

829
00:50:46,941 --> 00:50:51,941
Save against Pavelle bewray that's
how you saying Pablo Obra number.

830
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:55,430
Don't want to say these
Russian guys names is insane.

831
00:50:55,431 --> 00:50:58,730
Save against his penalty
shot or Patrick Wall.

832
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:01,100
Mike Vernon going at its center rights.

833
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:05,200
I'm definitely going to say Mike
Richter just because, uh, that was,

834
00:51:05,330 --> 00:51:06,980
that was one of the best
years ever in hockey.

835
00:51:07,430 --> 00:51:11,710
That was like 2004 when the red sox
finally wanted to watch the ranges.

836
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,380
Finally win the cup and everybody go
crazy. That was just an amazing moment.

837
00:51:15,410 --> 00:51:20,190
And uh, the Patrick Wa my burning
thin, you know, I don't know.

838
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,890
It's, it was, you know,
it was a great fight.

839
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:25,250
It's great to see Patrick
while loose. But you know,

840
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,370
that other one was for the Stanley Cup.

841
00:51:29,330 --> 00:51:32,960
And I remember watching that in
1994 and watching the ranges went.

842
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:37,490
And I remember thinking clearly that's
what it's going to be like when the red

843
00:51:37,880 --> 00:51:38,000
sox,

844
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,870
that they ever get their heads out of
their asses and they finally fucking win

845
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:45,560
one. That that's going to
be what it's like. So a,

846
00:51:45,561 --> 00:51:49,490
I was living vicariously and for some
reason I didn't hate the Rangers for the

847
00:51:49,491 --> 00:51:53,930
simple fact that I was not old
enough when the rangers last time,

848
00:51:53,931 --> 00:51:57,080
the range is Bruins rivalry was
great, which was back in the 70s.

849
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:58,700
I was still just a,

850
00:51:58,701 --> 00:52:03,701
a just a little lad with a big Motha
fucking red hair looking like that dude

851
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:06,680
Jody on a family affair. All right.

852
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:09,950
And that's why I became a comedian
because that's who the fuck I look like.

853
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:14,780
And I got the shit kicked out of me. Um,
all right, question number two, Bill.

854
00:52:14,781 --> 00:52:19,580
How the hell does Paris Hilton
keep getting movie roles? Well,

855
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:22,100
I actually thought about this one.

856
00:52:22,101 --> 00:52:26,630
And I think the reason that she
keeps getting movie roles is because,

857
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:31,760
uh, not to be crude, but, uh,
she's not afraid to show the clam,

858
00:52:33,110 --> 00:52:38,030
you know, and, uh, I think, uh,

859
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:39,890
you know, I think that's how,

860
00:52:39,891 --> 00:52:41,810
that's how you gotta deal
with sometimes as a woman,

861
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:44,960
you gotta you gotta just every once in
a while you just gotta take your pussy

862
00:52:44,961 --> 00:52:48,530
out, you know, and, uh, I don't
think there's anything wrong with it.

863
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:52,550
Sharon Stone did it.
Sharon Stone was, you know,

864
00:52:52,551 --> 00:52:57,200
meandering around all these
fucking B movies. She, you know,

865
00:52:57,201 --> 00:53:00,440
she had it halfway decent roll and
some sort of Schwartzenegger movie,

866
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,760
but it wasn't until she showed
the clam that people's, you know,

867
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,910
sat up and took notice.
Next thing you know,

868
00:53:07,911 --> 00:53:11,180
she's in that movie casino and
delivered one of the best performances.

869
00:53:11,181 --> 00:53:13,700
I thought she, she, she was,
she nominated for an Oscar.

870
00:53:13,701 --> 00:53:15,020
She should have won one that year.

871
00:53:15,740 --> 00:53:19,220
But that's when showing the clam kind
of hurt her because all the other women

872
00:53:19,221 --> 00:53:21,350
resented her. You know what I mean?

873
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:25,130
They thought that she was a whore
rather than she did what she had to do.

874
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:29,610
And I don't understand why
women get upset when that like,

875
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:34,830
you know, you're treating
me like a a, you know,

876
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:38,340
like a sexual object and it's
like you are a sexual object.

877
00:53:39,270 --> 00:53:42,120
You know what I mean? That's
like you. I, I'm like,

878
00:53:42,121 --> 00:53:46,260
oh you're just fucking using me
cause I can pick up heavy shit.

879
00:53:47,370 --> 00:53:48,203
I can pick up.

880
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,560
I mean not extra heavy shit but
heavier shit cause I'm a guy,

881
00:53:53,610 --> 00:53:53,941
you know,

882
00:53:53,941 --> 00:53:58,530
that's where Hillary Clinton fucked up
her campaign when she fucking put on the

883
00:53:58,531 --> 00:54:00,960
pants suit, you know,

884
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:06,930
she should have sexted up a little vamped
it up. God gave you titties, use them,

885
00:54:07,890 --> 00:54:11,400
show little cleavage, you know what I
mean? That's what she should've done.

886
00:54:11,640 --> 00:54:15,510
And people, you know, if you think
that's still, that's stupid. You know,

887
00:54:15,511 --> 00:54:18,600
guys don't get elected
because of their brains.

888
00:54:19,170 --> 00:54:23,790
Bill Clinton got elected because he played
the saxophone on fucking Arsenio Hall

889
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:26,820
and when our CTO came in
to do the black handshake,

890
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:30,390
somehow Bill Clinton was able to do
it without fucking breaking his wrist.

891
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:34,290
And I think that right there was, when
was, when that was the turning of it.

892
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:38,520
What else did he do? We just sat there
smiling with his mouth open going,

893
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:41,700
Jane's American wants change.
He didn't say anything.

894
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:46,590
He played the fucking saxophone.
So if you're a woman, you know,

895
00:54:46,650 --> 00:54:49,290
show little titty, share a
little titty, that's all.

896
00:54:49,291 --> 00:54:53,790
That's all I could tell you. Oh
God, I'm so ignorant. All right. Uh,

897
00:54:53,850 --> 00:54:58,650
question number three, uh, Bill, uh,
[inaudible]. What the fuck is this one?

898
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:01,320
Um, all right, thanks for
answering my questions.

899
00:55:01,321 --> 00:55:03,120
Or this is an up and coming comedian.

900
00:55:03,160 --> 00:55:08,160
I competed in a funniest person
contest in a city that I will not,

901
00:55:09,600 --> 00:55:11,700
I'm not gonna name cause I don't
get this person in trouble.

902
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:15,750
Just in case one of my 14 listeners
is the club owner of that. Anyways,

903
00:55:15,751 --> 00:55:19,560
the owner said that he would not hire
any of the comedians to work for any of

904
00:55:19,561 --> 00:55:21,390
the clubs because we were too vulgar.

905
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:25,260
The crazy thing is I noticed
that it was an older crowd,

906
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:29,670
but I was being stubborn and
decided to do my normal routine,

907
00:55:29,671 --> 00:55:34,380
which was some dirty jokes. In your
opinion, do you think you're selling out?

908
00:55:34,381 --> 00:55:39,381
If you adjust your comedic style to
get into the big corporate clubs?

909
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:44,700
Um, okay. Um, all right. I
know what you're saying here.

910
00:55:44,701 --> 00:55:49,440
I've done the same thing. Um, I've
looked out in the crowd going,

911
00:55:49,441 --> 00:55:52,680
okay, this is what I want to
talk about. You look at them,

912
00:55:52,681 --> 00:55:55,950
you judge them and you go, well,
I'm going to be eating my balls,

913
00:55:55,951 --> 00:56:00,480
at least 40% of my set if I
stick with what I want to do.

914
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:03,840
And um, yeah,

915
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:08,820
when you 100% adjust your
act, you yeah. You definitely,

916
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:13,620
yeah. You feel dirty, you know, not, not
them, not to use a pun there, but yeah.

917
00:56:13,621 --> 00:56:16,500
You don't feel good. But, uh,

918
00:56:16,830 --> 00:56:20,430
it isn't 100% selling out
if you know, I don't know.

919
00:56:20,431 --> 00:56:23,770
It's one of those weird things
where it's your own judgment call.

920
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:27,640
You know what I mean? Because I used
to do those NACA things for the,

921
00:56:27,641 --> 00:56:30,640
for those of you who aren't comedians
here, they have these things every year.

922
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:34,750
Um, these, these national
showcases for college gigs.

923
00:56:35,080 --> 00:56:39,580
And when I used to showcase for them, I
would go up and I would just do my act,

924
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:42,100
you know, and I remember one year,

925
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,640
something that was going on in my app
was the first time I got, you know,

926
00:56:45,641 --> 00:56:49,260
an HIV test and I was talking
about the fear of it, which is,

927
00:56:49,270 --> 00:56:52,660
and it's really not a joke that you
want to do on a college showcase.

928
00:56:53,170 --> 00:56:57,550
You just want to do you happy shit. And
I did. And I was like, fuck dead man,

929
00:56:57,551 --> 00:56:58,900
I'm fucking selling out.

930
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:02,710
So I went up there and I did
my shit and you know what,

931
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:06,700
I got zero schools and I just got people,
they kept coming up to me and going,

932
00:57:07,120 --> 00:57:10,510
we think you're hilarious. You know,
they kept getting the whole world,

933
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,290
who was up to me, I book you but I
can't because of blah, blah, blah, blah,

934
00:57:14,291 --> 00:57:18,280
blah. And what I learned was sometimes
you got to play the game a little bit.

935
00:57:18,850 --> 00:57:22,990
So what I would then do was
I would go up, after that,

936
00:57:22,991 --> 00:57:27,640
I would go up into a squeaky clean
set. Then I would book the colleges.

937
00:57:27,641 --> 00:57:29,020
And then when I went to the colleges,

938
00:57:29,021 --> 00:57:32,920
I would actually then do my act and
then do the shit that I wanted to talk

939
00:57:32,921 --> 00:57:35,830
about. So in a weird way,

940
00:57:35,831 --> 00:57:40,030
I actually won cause I got the money and
I still got to do what I wanted to do.

941
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,160
And I got people to hear the material,

942
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:46,960
more people to hear the material that
I want them to hear. I just had to be,

943
00:57:47,460 --> 00:57:49,990
uh, I had a wore myself out, you know,

944
00:57:49,991 --> 00:57:54,190
I had to put it on the Tuxedo for
like fucking five, six minutes. Jesus,

945
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,900
he just brought up a really bad fucking
memory. Um, no, but dude, I would say,

946
00:57:58,901 --> 00:58:01,420
you know, on your way up.
Yeah. Nobody wants, you know,

947
00:58:01,421 --> 00:58:04,240
a lot of headliners don't want to
go on in front of a guy who kills.

948
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:07,320
And they also don't want to go on in
front of a guy who's, you know, if you,

949
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,920
if you're being a little dirty,

950
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:12,370
that gives them an excuse
to kind of be like,

951
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:15,970
not just say that I can't follow
this guy. There'll be like, oh,

952
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:20,440
he's just being dirty. So, uh, yeah,
play the game a little bit. You know,

953
00:58:20,441 --> 00:58:23,500
you play the game a little bit and
then as people get to know who you are,

954
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:27,470
you get way more leeway
and eventually, uh,

955
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,400
you get to do your thing. You know
what I mean? It's one of those things.

956
00:58:30,401 --> 00:58:34,450
You gotta be like a tree, you know,
Ben, but don't break, you know, I dunno.

957
00:58:34,510 --> 00:58:38,800
Do whatever the fuck you want to
do, but you know, uh, I don't know.

958
00:58:38,801 --> 00:58:40,180
That's my 2 cents. I don't fucking know.

959
00:58:40,181 --> 00:58:41,820
I have no confidence
in my goddamn opinion,

960
00:58:41,821 --> 00:58:44,320
so I don't know even know why you
people ask me questions. All right.

961
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,670
Question number four. Uh, Bill,

962
00:58:45,671 --> 00:58:49,450
have you been approached about doing
any shows since your skits on Chappelle?

963
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:54,880
Um, yeah, catch one every year and
I try to get them on TV. But, um,

964
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:58,390
for those of you who always ask me, how
come you don't have your own TV show?

965
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:04,150
Because it's really hard.
It's all I can tell you. Okay.

966
00:59:04,151 --> 00:59:07,390
It's very hard to get a show on
TV because believe it or not,

967
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:12,100
a lot of people want to get a show on
television because you can make a lot of

968
00:59:12,101 --> 00:59:16,450
money. So, uh, I keep getting
closer. Keep getting closer.

969
00:59:18,010 --> 00:59:20,560
Um, hey bill, what do you think
about Shaq's rap about Coby?

970
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:24,500
Who was the bigger d bag
and this never ending saga?

971
00:59:24,590 --> 00:59:27,440
I think Shaq was just fucking
around. I thought he was joking,

972
00:59:27,441 --> 00:59:31,820
but he wasn't joking, but he was
joking. You know what I mean? I mean,

973
00:59:32,150 --> 00:59:37,150
if somebody gets arrested for a potential
rape and they bring my name up during

974
00:59:37,521 --> 00:59:40,580
it, you know, um,

975
00:59:40,730 --> 00:59:43,730
I think I have the license
to give him shit for awhile.

976
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:47,960
If I'm in a club and
I want to fucking, uh,

977
00:59:48,650 --> 00:59:53,120
make fun of him a little bit. Yeah, I
dunno. I just looked at chef's face.

978
00:59:53,121 --> 00:59:57,600
I thought he was clearly joking around
and it was so over the top. Colby had,

979
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:00,770
how's my ass taste? I mean, I dunno.

980
01:00:02,570 --> 01:00:03,680
How does it take shack? I don't know.

981
01:00:03,681 --> 01:00:05,930
Like you've been running full
court for the last 15 years.

982
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:08,780
What a disgusting question.
All right. Uh, number five.

983
01:00:08,781 --> 01:00:11,720
We got a lot of questions this week
and we try to blow through them. Um,

984
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:16,400
but I went to the Tempe Improv,
saw this comic. He was good,

985
01:00:16,401 --> 01:00:19,100
but the opening Yak was
killing it. He was so funny.

986
01:00:19,610 --> 01:00:22,700
Do you ever get worried or stressed that
your opener's going to be more funny

987
01:00:22,701 --> 01:00:27,110
than you? Um, is there any sort of process
you go through picking your opener?

988
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:32,280
Am I worried about them being more
funny? Uh, well yeah. No I'm not. I'm,

989
01:00:32,450 --> 01:00:35,340
they're fucking middle ex
for a reason. All right.

990
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:37,910
If you can't follow a middle act
and you're, you're not a headliner.

991
01:00:37,940 --> 01:00:40,550
I've definitely had some funny
guys on in front of me. Um,

992
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,040
but I think that's a good
thing. You know what I mean?

993
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,100
You don't want to be sparring
with somebody who sucks
because then you're going

994
01:00:47,180 --> 01:00:52,010
to end up sucking. So I believe
in going out with, uh, you know,

995
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:55,100
bringing in a middle act that's,
you know, funny and, and original.

996
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:59,570
And that's my process to picking
an opener. I use a Joe to Rosa,

997
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:04,790
Kevin Shay. I'm going to be using this
guy, Todd wrecks up in San Francisco.

998
01:01:04,791 --> 01:01:07,400
These guys, Todd wrecks,
you know, in particular,

999
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:10,760
no disrespect to those other two
cops, but he really fucking kills.

1000
01:01:10,761 --> 01:01:14,300
So I'll let my work cut out
for me that week. But uh, yeah,

1001
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:15,200
I don't want to be that guy.

1002
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:18,200
I don't want to have some guy who just
goes up there with like a lampshade on

1003
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:21,940
his head and stinks. Um, while
these are a lot of questions here,

1004
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:24,920
is this podcast getting too
long? All right. Uh, April,

1005
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:26,480
I've got a question for you. Podcast.

1006
01:01:26,481 --> 01:01:30,500
You haven't got a chance to meet
George Carlin. Um, unfortunately, no,

1007
01:01:31,160 --> 01:01:35,510
I didn't. I was supposed to meet him. Um,

1008
01:01:36,650 --> 01:01:39,450
when was it? February or March,
right before he did his special,

1009
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:43,040
he's supposed to be doing the comedy
magic club down on her Moshe Beach.

1010
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:46,970
And I had just done a spot down there
and they said, hey, he's coming in,

1011
01:01:47,080 --> 01:01:49,130
whatever, on a Wednesday or a Tuesday,

1012
01:01:49,760 --> 01:01:52,520
he can come down and watch the show
and you can meet him afterwards.

1013
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:57,380
And it was going to be a
dream come true. But, um,

1014
01:01:57,470 --> 01:02:02,120
he ended up getting sick. Obviously
his health was failing and, uh,

1015
01:02:02,150 --> 01:02:04,460
he ended up canceling so I
never got a chance to meet him,

1016
01:02:04,461 --> 01:02:08,120
but I did get a chance to see him and, um,

1017
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:12,930
he absolutely blew me away and it
was actually, it was a long time,

1018
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:15,950
was like 20 years ago before I
was even doing comedy and, uh,

1019
01:02:15,951 --> 01:02:18,710
I did at least get to see him
cause I never got to see prior.

1020
01:02:19,230 --> 01:02:23,100
So at least I can say that
I saw him and I'm with him.

1021
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:27,900
Passing is really making me want to go
see Don Rickles because, uh, you know,

1022
01:02:27,901 --> 01:02:30,930
that guy's in his eighties and he's
still fucking hilarious. And uh,

1023
01:02:30,931 --> 01:02:33,630
I don't know. He should,
you know, as a comedian,

1024
01:02:33,631 --> 01:02:36,120
I think anybody likes comedy
should see those guys. So No,

1025
01:02:36,330 --> 01:02:38,340
I did not get a chance to meet him,

1026
01:02:38,341 --> 01:02:42,660
but I did get to see him in person and
obviously as you can see on my page,

1027
01:02:42,661 --> 01:02:47,050
he was a huge influence
on me obviously. Um, all,

1028
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:48,570
all right. What are we doing here?

1029
01:02:48,750 --> 01:02:51,000
Two more questions and then I'm
going to wrap this fucking thing up.

1030
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:54,030
Number seven, Bill. Um, do you okay.

1031
01:02:54,070 --> 01:02:58,380
I actually got a fucking asked
advice here on dating. You know,

1032
01:02:58,740 --> 01:03:02,160
I'm fucking not married at 40 and somebody
is asking me advice on relationships.

1033
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:07,050
Okay, you really need to
consider your sources here. Um,

1034
01:03:07,150 --> 01:03:09,540
all right. That's like, why don't
you go ask somebody on heroin?

1035
01:03:09,541 --> 01:03:13,860
You think math is bad, you know.
Hey man, if you like doing it,

1036
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:16,140
you should fucking do it.
All right, here we go. Bill,

1037
01:03:16,141 --> 01:03:20,790
do you think a person deserves more
than one date to determine if there is

1038
01:03:20,791 --> 01:03:23,750
chemistry? I recently went
out on a date with a guy.

1039
01:03:23,790 --> 01:03:27,150
Turns out he wasn't my type. Well,
there's your answer right there.

1040
01:03:27,180 --> 01:03:31,530
But he had a nice personality,
but I feel you should know.

1041
01:03:31,560 --> 01:03:35,670
You should feel something immediately.
You're answering your questions. Uh,

1042
01:03:35,910 --> 01:03:39,210
it's not like he was my friend to
begin with or will be my friend

1043
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,600
that'll have time to grow on me. I feel
very mean and superficial. Oh, whoa.

1044
01:03:45,601 --> 01:03:48,660
Okay. There you go. Right there.
There's your first mistake with dating.

1045
01:03:48,661 --> 01:03:53,430
When you date, you have to be unbelievably
selfish, unbelievably selfish,

1046
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:54,810
or you're not going to get what you want.

1047
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,040
And it's not even being selfish because
if you settle for something that you

1048
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:02,130
don't want, you're not
going to be happy. Okay?

1049
01:04:02,131 --> 01:04:04,050
And then you're going to make
the other person miserable.

1050
01:04:04,051 --> 01:04:08,130
And that's not fair to the other
person. So fuck that guy. All right.

1051
01:04:08,550 --> 01:04:11,910
Fuck him in his nice personality. Hook
them up with another one of your friends.

1052
01:04:11,911 --> 01:04:14,670
Say, Hey, I met a guy that I'm not
into, but he has a nice personality.

1053
01:04:15,570 --> 01:04:18,210
You know what I mean? That's like a,

1054
01:04:18,810 --> 01:04:20,760
that's like watching a TV
show that you don't enjoy,

1055
01:04:20,761 --> 01:04:23,970
but you really like the
look of it. The end of it.

1056
01:04:23,971 --> 01:04:27,360
You don't like the fucking show. So how
long are you going to be interested?

1057
01:04:28,740 --> 01:04:31,980
You know? You know? I don't
know. It's like friends.

1058
01:04:32,260 --> 01:04:34,800
I used to watch friends when I lived
in New York City. I was like, God,

1059
01:04:34,950 --> 01:04:37,860
look at that apartment, which had
a fucking huge apartment like that,

1060
01:04:38,280 --> 01:04:41,160
but I hated the fucking show. So at the
end of the day, I didn't watch the show.

1061
01:04:41,190 --> 01:04:44,790
How long can you look up the couch?
All right, question number eight.

1062
01:04:44,850 --> 01:04:49,530
This is the final question I built.
Why a while? This is a cheesy question.

1063
01:04:49,590 --> 01:04:53,880
I'm a chef so I always ask. Um, and I,

1064
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,990
so I always ask and I think
the answer says a lot.

1065
01:04:58,380 --> 01:05:02,610
What is your favorite
food slash restaurant? Uh,

1066
01:05:02,640 --> 01:05:04,760
what is my favorite
food? I like steak. Um,

1067
01:05:06,180 --> 01:05:10,350
and I really liked that steak and
shake. You know, it's got two things.

1068
01:05:10,351 --> 01:05:15,060
I really enjoy. Red Meat and shakes. No.

1069
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:18,010
Um, I'm really, I don't know. I like
everything. I would say Italian.

1070
01:05:18,011 --> 01:05:22,000
I think Italians make the
best food hands down and uh,

1071
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:26,230
it's absolutely delish and um, you know,

1072
01:05:26,231 --> 01:05:28,180
the olive oil and just, you know,

1073
01:05:28,181 --> 01:05:30,550
you know what I love about Italians
who really know how to cook.

1074
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:35,140
They know how to add stuff.
Like they, they don't overt.

1075
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:40,030
Like I like explain it. Like
whatever they add enhances the dish.

1076
01:05:40,060 --> 01:05:42,670
It doesn't overpower it.
You know what I mean?

1077
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:48,100
Like take like the art of making
pizza somewhere along the line,

1078
01:05:48,430 --> 01:05:53,430
the cheese on the pizza rather than
enhancing the taste of the sauce.

1079
01:05:55,420 --> 01:05:59,290
The cheese became the focal point. Okay.

1080
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:04,690
I can't explain it. Like it became the
lead in the movie when it was actually,

1081
01:06:05,290 --> 01:06:08,200
you know, the, the guy who had two
lines in the movie, it's like, Oh look,

1082
01:06:08,201 --> 01:06:11,140
pizza hut. They got it all
over. They got it in the cross.

1083
01:06:11,141 --> 01:06:11,974
They got it everywhere.

1084
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,950
You just seen a big brick of cheese
and it tastes like fucking shit and you

1085
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,240
can't move your bottles afterwards.
That I like Italian food.

1086
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:22,480
I like the olive oil that they cook
with. I just, you know, it's very clean.

1087
01:06:23,260 --> 01:06:25,180
You know, you drink that,
you know, it's sip of wine.

1088
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:28,180
As long as you don't eat like, like
you go into the fucking all of garden,

1089
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:31,540
you just feel great. You take
your time, the whole thing.

1090
01:06:32,380 --> 01:06:36,970
That's what I like about Italian food
and restaurants, like the whole thing,

1091
01:06:37,150 --> 01:06:41,710
the lighting, the ambiance,
everything. Um, so anyways,

1092
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:46,780
with that, my uh, my favorite
restaurant when I was in New York was a,

1093
01:06:46,781 --> 01:06:50,290
I used to really, I liked the
lupa. That was my favorite one,

1094
01:06:50,291 --> 01:06:54,370
the Mario Batali one and out here in
la, one of the best ones I went to,

1095
01:06:54,371 --> 01:06:57,450
I haven't been to a lot out
here. I went to a Motsa,

1096
01:06:57,550 --> 01:06:59,740
which is a another Mario Batali one,

1097
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:04,660
but I'm sort of like a hacky restaurant
guy where if they have a show on the

1098
01:07:04,661 --> 01:07:07,570
food network, I ended up going to it like,

1099
01:07:07,571 --> 01:07:11,920
you know that you know that blonde guy
who wears the sunglasses backwards on his

1100
01:07:11,921 --> 01:07:15,320
head. He's actually a
favorite chef of Joe de Rosas.

1101
01:07:15,920 --> 01:07:17,470
I forget his fucking name,

1102
01:07:17,471 --> 01:07:19,930
but he just goes around to
diners and that type of shit.

1103
01:07:19,931 --> 01:07:24,931
And I ate at his restaurant in Sacramento
and it was one of the worst fucking

1104
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:29,950
things I ever went to. He actually
had, I think I talked about it, he had,

1105
01:07:30,430 --> 01:07:35,140
he had this Sushi roll that had pork
and French fries in it with some sort of

1106
01:07:35,141 --> 01:07:39,310
barbecue sauce and it wasn't
rice. I don't know what it was.

1107
01:07:39,311 --> 01:07:42,640
It was some sort of pasty thing. It
was absolutely fucking disgusting.

1108
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:46,780
And it's in Sacramento. Don't
go to it. And a, there you go.

1109
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:51,670
That's the end of the fucking podcast
questions. Um, um, I think that's it.

1110
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,790
I think that's it for the week.
Also, I trashed best buy last week,

1111
01:07:54,791 --> 01:07:58,990
said I wasn't going to go there anymore
because they had that 15% restocking

1112
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:01,450
fee. Somebody sent me an email about that,

1113
01:08:01,451 --> 01:08:04,360
that if you buy something there and you
don't like it and you bring it back,

1114
01:08:04,361 --> 01:08:09,130
they still charge you 15% of it to
just stick it back on the shelf.

1115
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:13,000
So some best buy person wrote,
why work at best buy and trust me,

1116
01:08:13,001 --> 01:08:17,840
it's necessary. They do it mainly on
computers because when we sell one,

1117
01:08:18,110 --> 01:08:22,340
we only make about 20
bucks in profit. Really?

1118
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:25,610
Is that how you keep that big store open?

1119
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:30,350
You make $20 on each
laptop. I don't buy that.

1120
01:08:30,860 --> 01:08:35,450
And when someone decides to return it,
if we have to sell it for below cost, no,

1121
01:08:35,451 --> 01:08:36,284
you don't.

1122
01:08:38,030 --> 01:08:42,680
I've never gone into best buy and
seen a TV or anything that says, uh,

1123
01:08:43,670 --> 01:08:47,180
everything there is full price.
What are you talking about?

1124
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:50,570
I don't know. I'm going to give
you the benefit of the doubt. Now.

1125
01:08:50,571 --> 01:08:52,520
I'm not gonna give you the benefit
of the doubt cause best buy.

1126
01:08:52,830 --> 01:08:55,250
I'm not saying it's you sir,
who wrote this fucking thing,

1127
01:08:55,251 --> 01:08:59,270
but you work for an evil fucking place
that put mom and pop fucking places out

1128
01:08:59,271 --> 01:09:02,870
of business. Okay. Back in the
day when you return something,

1129
01:09:03,050 --> 01:09:03,950
they just returned it.

1130
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:06,830
They put it back in the fucking
box and they stuck it on the shelf.

1131
01:09:06,831 --> 01:09:09,200
They didn't charge you 15%. Okay.

1132
01:09:09,201 --> 01:09:12,350
That's one of those exploiting
new revenue streams,

1133
01:09:12,680 --> 01:09:16,910
new way to come up with extra money to
fuck the customer. I firmly believe that.

1134
01:09:17,120 --> 01:09:21,270
I've been in best buy, I've shopped in
best buy, I've never seen any use cds,

1135
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:25,040
any used computers,
everything is brand new. Okay,

1136
01:09:25,070 --> 01:09:26,990
so maybe you've got to clarify that.

1137
01:09:27,200 --> 01:09:31,310
Is there some sort of off the rack
best buy thing down the street? Uh,

1138
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:36,470
best buy part two. I have no idea. But
uh, I'm still saying fuck best buy.

1139
01:09:36,471 --> 01:09:39,710
So why don't you write me a followup.
Okay. I know it was a bit of a cut there,

1140
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:42,860
so explain it further because
I don't get it. So anyways,

1141
01:09:42,890 --> 01:09:44,270
that's the podcast for the week.

1142
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,010
Thanks to everybody who sent me in
all the Goddamn questions. And, um,

1143
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,650
what am I going to say here? Uh,
yeah, I'm going to be at the, uh,

1144
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:55,670
the Improv in Pittsburgh this week
for the love of God. Please come out.

1145
01:09:55,970 --> 01:09:58,820
I got a brand new hour that
I'm really proud of and uh,

1146
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:03,320
it's really depressing to, to be at
that Goddamn mall with the stacks,

1147
01:10:04,100 --> 01:10:07,460
you know, the poltergeist stacks,
just fucking chimneys there. Okay.

1148
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:10,490
I'm going to the pirates game
Wednesday night. All right.

1149
01:10:10,790 --> 01:10:12,890
It'll be me and 30 other
fucking people there.

1150
01:10:12,891 --> 01:10:14,440
So you'll be able to see me come up to,

1151
01:10:14,660 --> 01:10:18,950
to come up to me and say what's up a
Wednesday night against the Astros.

1152
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,340
Um, further news, I'll be in the uh,

1153
01:10:22,520 --> 01:10:27,500

First Week of August. Um,

1154
01:10:27,590 --> 01:10:31,460
and what else? I got the Improv in
Miami. I got a bunch of gigs coming up.

1155

I have an upcoming tour, an upcoming,

1156
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:39,060
our special coming out August
23rd on a comedy central.

1157
01:10:39,130 --> 01:10:42,200
If I had half a brain and would've said
that at the beginning of this podcast.

1158
01:10:43,270 --> 01:10:46,850
I'm am I, new CD is coming out August 3rd.

1159
01:10:48,050 --> 01:10:52,730
And I think that's it. Please keep the
questions coming and, uh, and that is it.
