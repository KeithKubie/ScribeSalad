Speaker 1:          00:00:02       Hello sweet bitches of the Internet. Yeah, that's right. We're back. This episode is brought to you by me undies. This is a disturbing thing that has been discovered due to an Internet survey is that most men don't change their underwear. But once every seven years, that shit's fucked up. It's more than that for me. That's fucked up. That's your Dick Hammocks on. You need to keep that shit clean.

Speaker 2:          00:00:25       You don't have a pair of underwear that you know for sure that you've had for a long ass time. I tried to get rid of them,

Speaker 1:          00:00:30       but um, I'm going to be honest with you. I never bought nice underwear before. I just would buy like underwear, like whatever, like a big packet of m and all. As they kept my Dick in place, I get very upset if the dick hole opens up and I've got to keep talking, talking the hamster back into the cage. That was bullshit. Um, so until these me on these guys sent me underwear. These are the best underwear I've ever worn without a doubt. And I was thinking about it when I put them on. I was like, why wouldn't I want like comfortable underwear on my balls and my dick like of wood. Right. So why haven't I not like spent money on like some nice underwear. I've never spent money on nice underwear. I just bought fucking whatever. So then of these, me and these guys, they sent me it and at first I was like a little bit skeptical. It's like it's fucking underwear man who this shit about underwear. You gotta to get underwear at a store. But they have like really high quality shit. Like it feels good like it, it's like they have moisture like it, it pulls moisture away from your body. They're their underwears like super high end stuff.

Speaker 2:          00:01:27       You know, I, I, my, my Dick is being strangled right now and I think a ball is hanging out and I've always just accepted like, oh that's just sitting. That's just your choices. You've got ropes around your Dick. What are you talking? No, my underwears way too tight. Like this underwear that I'm wearing, I know I've had for a long time and it's super, super tight. You have the same underwear for back when you lost a ton of weight? Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. I mean I have a hundred word I know I've had for a long time cause it's kind of like if it's, if it's still works, why would you throw it away? It's like a towel. Well me on disease, your solutions son. Okay. And they will pull some moisture away from your desk and give you some shit that fit the most comfortable underwear you have ever tried on.

Speaker 2:          00:02:04       They fit perfectly. They don't, they don't strangle you dick safe. And they literally do pull moisture away from your skin. So that will help you. Like with people that have like yeasty or things going on it. Well you should probably clean yourself. You fucking dirty pig. But once you do do that. Yeah, I mean guys are diabetes just feels better. Yeah. A lot of guys, you know how many guys are diabetes? You blow him. When I got that mail, yeast infection, I studied it for a long time. I'm sure you did. I'm sure it wasn't honestly cursory use, little glimpse on a Google went back to business it, where did they pull the moisture to? They take it to Canada. It's kind of going on them a lot from Canada. It's just that's what we give back. Ball Ball, sweat gutters to this or like this is your pants just get, become a wet. It just becomes like the [inaudible] for ball sweat. Just captures it all. Anyway, me on these.com go there. They're underwear. I'm

Speaker 1:          00:03:00       wearing them right now. They're very, very, very comfortable and uh, you know, change your fucking underwear more than once every seven years. Your pigs go to [inaudible] dot com forward slash Rogan before September 1st and get 20% off your first order, 20% off of your first order when you go to meet undies.com forward slash Rogen before September 1st, which is a couple of weeks from now. All right, fuck, enjoy me undies. Dot. We are also brought to you by Ting Ting is the official cell phone provider for this podcast. The phone is, uh, that we use for this podcast is run on Ting. Ting is, um, the use of sprint backbone. And they use it with their own rules, their own rules like that. They decide, they decided, okay, let's have no contracts, et cetera. No early termination fees. Let's not even charge people like a set amount per month. Um, let's do it.

Speaker 1:          00:03:52       They did it two different ways. One, at one point in time, they would like credit you, they would knock you down to the lower level. Like say if you didn't use all your minutes, they're knocking down to a lower level and credit either distance the difference on your next bill. And then he decided like, that's too fucking complicated. But you know what it really should be. It should be people just pay for what they use. So that's their newest thing, which I think is perfect. And I think that's where all cell phone providers will eventually find themselves. It doesn't make any sense. It'd be like, you pay for 120 minutes. We only use a hundred. Where's those 20 minutes? They're gone. They're, they're evaporated. But with Tang, 98% of people use tangled, saved money. And, uh, again, they use the sprint backbone, they rent time on sprints or it's a major network and they do it in like a very ethical way, in a way that, uh, just makes you feel good about working with the company. I think that's how it should be. Like contracts and termination fees and all this legal bullshit with telling you buy a phone, you have [inaudible] by phone, you have it, it's yours. And then if you want to cancel, then we tell them, go fuck yourself and you just cancel and that's it. And you're in, you're out, you do whatever you want to do. That's how it should be. You know, this, uh, this idea about, you know, being able to, uh, control people with contracts. It's fucking gross. I don't like it. I don't like it, Brian.

Speaker 3:          00:05:04       Oh, I get it. It's so cheap though. And they have family plants now where you can like add somebody for really cheap. So if you have a girlfriend you get, throw her on your plan, check it out. You can just go to plan. It's going to take a look at the different points. Rogan,

Speaker 1:          00:05:17       [inaudible] dot com if you go there, you could see all the different cell phones they sell as well. Like Brian was showing them on the screen earlier. They have, um, like some serious high end android phones. The one I got is the Samsung Galaxy s five. I just got it. Love it. You know what else I love about it? It's water resistant. Like it did the, the bottom of it. It plugs in and you can throw it in the toilet

Speaker 3:          00:05:40       if you want it to. It'll be okay. He use it as toilet paper and throw it allowed to do that until you can't wipe your ass on it. Cause then you'll get like, but if he just dropped it. Have you ever dropped your phone at the moment? I've dropped my phone. Yeah, I got, yeah, we all have while on poop and I had to grab it. Yeah. Yeah. I've, I've dropped it while brushing

Speaker 2:          00:05:58       my teeth in the sank and got water all over it. I fucked phones up before dropping them. But with, um, these, uh, galaxy s five, you don't have to worry about that. Actually the bottom closes ups got a little tab that closes in on the bottom and the top. Apparently you can go under water with these fucking things.

Speaker 4:          00:06:12       A lot of people think I was stupid. I said that story about having to suck the water out of my phone. Like, cause a lot of people throw it in rice and I'm always like get the water out of their first smart and sweet. But a lot of people have said that that was the dumbest thing they ever heard. And so I went online to all this Howard forms and I researched it. No, that totally makes sense. Get the water out of there. Maybe he's a vacuum cleaner if you have one, probably wouldn't be as good as your mouth because your mouth would seal it, you know, and you could get a good amount of yeah, I can get a good amount of suction with that. Yeah. And just fucking be a man about it. And you know, brushing teeth afterwards, you know, suck your phone at least go has invented this pack that you put a phone in.

Speaker 4:          00:06:49       If it's got wet and you put it in this in more liquid, which sounds crazy, but it counteracts what the was doing. Absolutely bizarre. I was apparently it would have been huge because their plan was to put it in airports but because it's a bag of liquid. Oh did you go cause cause, cause I really like the perfect thing to have an [inaudible] but yeah you put it in and it's so yeah, we count as well. What does someone else, so it's not just, it's the, it's not just the fact it's liquid, it's something in it that erodes everything wearing

Speaker 2:          00:07:17       I wonder what it is. I remember they were doing those things where there were dipping phones. You remember that you'd send off a phone to a company. They still do that.

Speaker 4:          00:07:24       They even sell it now. I'd just like Lowe's. You can buy the same chemical now. Real. Yeah. You could dip your own phone. Yeah. I think we should the commercial on, on this pond. No, no. Did we? Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:07:33       I wasn't paying attention. I was trying to avoid, you know, I don't remember that at all man. I really don't. They sell it now and do it yourself. Yeah. They said you did it on one of your spots. No, no, no. I remember it cause we talked about it and we set a commercial about, I don't remember. Just been too many God damn podcast. Fuck. So how, how hard is it to do? Is it easy? Like you just, yeah, it's pretty easy. You can just do that then. I don't know. You can like different clothes in it. Like if you work outside a lot, your shoes, your, your, your shoes. So you do, you throw the whole phone in this bullshit. Are you? Because what about the screen? Is it fuck with a screen? I don't, I don't know. Here I'll show you what you did. No, let's just get through this commercial. People are mad p I get some of my tweets about how long these commercials are tough shit. You know how to use the fast forward bitch. Use a anyway, go to [inaudible] dot ting.com and save 25 bucks off of any of their, uh, awesome new phones, rogan.ting.com in Joe yet. And that's it. This episode, the podcast that commercials are now officially over scrupulous pip is here. Let's just get cracking with this thing. Well, shall we

Speaker 4:          00:08:44       experience, try my day job. What's happening in fellow. I'm good man. How you doing? It's been

Speaker 2:          00:08:52       cool to talk to you from the moment you got here 20 plus minutes ago. Been hanging out with, did a lot of talking. Yeah, Jack Black was a really cool dude at tennis and some crazy stories of Russia, but yeah. Yeah, he's tired. He was telling us some, Robin black was telling us some awesome stories of uh, these, uh, Russian dudes that, uh, he partied with these sumo wrestlers. It was insane that like what what he was saying was like, it was so ridiculous. The stories of access and drinking and waking up covered in urine. And uh, we videotaped it. So a Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, we'll put that shit up later, but it was really funny. He was a, he was a cool dude, man. I really liked Robin. Yeah. Interesting guy. Um, from another country he is as our user. Yes. Indeed. I am all the way from England. I saw your shit on my message board was the first time I saw your shit. Yeah. Some people would put up a, one of the videos was a view. Uh, you're cutting your hair. Yeah. You're in Walsh and introduction. That's a great fucking [inaudible]. That's really fun. A hundred pounds on that, on that video did you, was my complete budget. Can we play that? Play that? Let's play that and talk about it. Brian. Pull it up. It's a introduction.

Speaker 2:          00:10:04       You got to tell them how to spell it. This is my foot was row for picking the name. This ridiculously hard to spell and pronounce and yeah, it's, it's scribbious pips. A tough one for Twitter's. No easy, no easy to fit in. Some people do. They try. Oh, you, yeah, yeah. They try ous. Yeah. Mm. Screws. Yeah, they get it in the end. Eventually.

Speaker 5:          00:10:28       Here we go. So the dead fish on the pavement and for, what did you expect? There's no wall around these stupid. She just stayed where it was wet.

Speaker 6:          00:10:39       You gotta see this. I don't to leave miss pip and I would like to see some deliveries into this microphone. This amplified so you can he read his piece of diction is the Intro to distraction pieces or some of the shit that flies around my head and keeps me seamless. It's actually often for former fucking brain fools anorexic. So many typers. When our right a wall claim. I'm dyslexic. I'll go you poem here. I've put it in December. I'm setting fire to wait and hope you all can read the smoke. Most people where my live don't know me and I fucking like it. Some people were barley formuli me how to fucking nowhere. Somebody for an open naval [inaudible] retention [inaudible] they are just words. You give them power was covered by Lilly. Pros is original. Now I'm repeating what I say. This could be an excuse to run into this all brandished the [inaudible] vista, right? Benny [inaudible] too intrusive. You see a mouse trap? I'll see free cheese and a fucking challenge you say [inaudible] that is great. That's really fun man.

Speaker 3:          00:13:11       I really enjoy that. I thought the lyrics are cool. I like how I did it. It was interesting and crazy because we've failed that in just a metal container and the guard who had rented the off, we didn't tell him what the fuck we were doing cause I figured we can only do it in one take because I've got a shaved my head and shit. So I thought if be doesn't, if we ask him, he can say no. Right. If we do it, he can just tell us off afterwards and, and that's that. So as you finish, obviously there's tons of fire. We say Cheryl farm, we have to have the doors closed because of in, oh, so in a metal container, which was burned and everything. And then our powered out with smoke bellowing and the guy just walked past and sweat pip. I don't even want to know more Tom.

Speaker 3:          00:13:48       Like good man. Good man. The die. What a great scene. You coming out of a video shoot, shaved your head shaved. And the fucking door opens to a storage container in this smoke bellowing out. What a great scene. That's rock and roll, man. That's some real shit. The beauty of direct in all your own videos is you don't have to do health and safety sheet. You don't have to take that off, isn't it? There's no one to say you can't do that. It's like, yeah, we can fucking do that. You, how did you get started rapping, man, we'll let you, do you, do you consider that rap or you kind of, I mean, I started off in spoken word, so I started off just kind of weave, no beat spies into hip hop. And again, a lot of people hear spoken word and think that sales shit basically and poetry in it.

Speaker 3:          00:14:34       But I was exactly the same. Um, spoken word has potential, right? What do people like being people love? I have a dream. I have a dream is God damn spoken word. I mean Martin Luther King's I have a dream speech, which is why I always refer to it as spoken word are rather than poetry anything. Because that's the most literal right. Jan, I mean a really an, an intricate stand up set. This like one piece that's a whole story. That's, that's spoken word. It's just does not word poetry does poet, does that have a bad connotation? Like a pretentious kind of tapers off from people kind of think you're dead, right? If you say, I remember I was at the comedy cellar in New York and David tells onstage and he's killing and there's this snotty fucking the audience and for some reason the guide took offense to want to Dave's jokes and says something and, and uh, Dave was like, well I'm sorry sir.

Speaker 3:          00:15:24       I'm just trying to hear. You're trying to do some jokes. What do you do for a living, sir? No, he's fucking, the guy goes, I'm a poet published and I'll never forget that. I never for a year I would say that to people. I'm a poet, published like trying to get insurance and shit like that. I'd just try and explain what I do and then just go with unemployed or self employed cause itself. They put poetry on Ma. Oh my thing, this, I'll never forget that asshole. I'm a poet published and he had like fashionable clothes on shit. You know, he's just totally lives at home still with his mom. [inaudible] David Tell doesn't even remember it. But I remember it. It wasn't even me that got heckled fuck heads. But yeah, so obviously I'm not in love with poetry. I started doing it because I was in kind of like some, some punk bands and shit like that and I got sick of relying on dramas that mum like giving them a lift to practice and the basis can't make it because he's working in night shift and shit like that.

Speaker 3:          00:16:24       So I was looking at what I could do and succeed or fail on my own. Like I love the buzz of the fact that if it went well, it's my fault if I fail, I can't say always this other guy's fault. That's a real problem with bands, Huh? Yeah. Eddie Bravo was trying to explain to me like the trials and tribulations at the average band goes through and I was thinking about it when we had the conversation. I'm like, I never even thought about that before. But dealing with all those egos together and then also some people that are just undisciplined. Yeah, completely. Some people aren't as passionate about it as you are or it's just a fun thing for them and equally accepting gigs and shit and shit like that. You have to ring through like four or five other people to say, can we accept this Gig site?

Speaker 3:          00:17:01       Yeah. Soulful, full. To me that's kind of why I started doing spoken word. Um, yeah. So I could do it all off of my own bath. It was just a height of being in bands really. They know what I like about what you did to, um, for whatever reason there's a lot of guys who speak a certain way and then when they performed wrap, it sounds like an urban black guy. Yeah, completely. Very strange. It's like what? What happened that you had to start doing it like this because that's not how you would talk in real life. Miss, I was raised in the hood, but I'm strong from my, you know, it's, there's, there's like, it blows my mind that people, the most common thing that people say to me after shows and that is like, oh, you sound exactly. I like doing recall. Does that, cause this is my voice. This is me talking this article about

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       why, uh, people with a British accent sing in an American accent. You know, I don't remember what the fucking conclusion was. I barely, essentially, I looked at it, I'm like, who cares? They just choose to, you know, you could chew, but if there's a difference between an English guy choosing to sound American and American guy choosing to sound British, cause if an English guy comes over to America and loses his British accent, nobody's gonna give him a hard time about it. But if an American got takes on a British accent, get the fuck outta here. But Madonna can live in London. Tiller tits, fall off. You're not British. Cut it out. Cut it out. Cut it out. Madonna. Don't feel fucking bought a house there. That rich bitch, she bought a house there just so she could talk in an English accent. I just want to be one of the loads.

Speaker 2:          00:18:35       Come on my, I am Madonna. I am a dancer. Slash singer. Slash superstore was Madonna Madonna at night. Did she should be hand fucking, what's his name? Elton John was listening to a country comfort on the way over here. Just randomly sometimes like my iPhone syncs up with my a car, just a play. You know, how does it, sometimes I'll just play random song and it just started playing. Um, it's on one of my playlists, but that Elton John Song, country comfort that mother fucker cause sing his ass off. God Damn Elton John's good. You're just like, there's so much emotion and power in his songs, you know, it's just like, it takes you right to what he said. He's thinking like it's a bout grandma and needing help to fix her barn. You know like this and you like you see in the whole thing play out. You see in fields of wheat and butterflies and an old lady and Elton John's a bad motherfucker.

Speaker 3:          00:19:30       Does he stay on lockout and Joan and when he sings, that's not really right. It's kind of, it's not really an American accent though, is it? It's Kinda hard to say. Hard to say because the, when you're singing you're, you're extending these words.

Speaker 2:          00:19:44       She needed me. He sang farm and it's taken him like 10 seconds. Yeah. Sneeze him helped him on the phone. Nobody talks like that.

Speaker 3:          00:19:52       Yeah. So it's like I've got to start. I, so I do kind of talk a lot about this. This might end up in a really long podcasts that normally three hours, this will be like six hours, seven hours. So lock yourselves in, sing into weird thing, man. Singing is a beautiful thing, but spoken word to music is a very different thing. Spoken word to music. It's very lyrical. Um, uh, lyrically dependent. That's the word for it. It's like, that was what I really enjoyed about your stuff was it was very clever. I could see that you put a lot of thought into the your lyrics and what you're, you know, and I love the thing about Lenny Bruce, it's like, you know, you covered it in a really cool way. It's kind of neat. Also tell it was one take [inaudible] w whenever I'm running and he's, the main goal was to make you interested in, to me kind of thing. And that's why I think confuses me about a lot of hip hop when it is all just talking about the same thing. It's like I'd get bored performing that or doing that over and over again. So

Speaker 2:          00:20:47       it's kind of, you know what that exists. I think in every art form. I bet it exists in rock and roll. I bet. I mean, I know it exists in comedy, you know, there's, there's certain subjects that guys will cover when you can tell they're covering it because they think that the audience wants to hear that. Yeah. And it's not like what's actually interesting to them. Yeah. I can't imagine getting excited finishing the line or finishing a piece of, that's just exactly that kind of, I think people enjoy that. There's a lot of people that do do that though. It's weird like those hip maker guys so like sit down, they write these songs that they know specifically we'll hit like a target nurses understand that cause cause they've run that for someone else to have to perform and resale. They're sold every night to kind of sing and get through.

Speaker 2:          00:21:31       I can understand that because they just go, I'm going to write this to make a fuck ton of money and then hand this over to some other guy to wasn't there a home up there and wasn't there a band where the lead singer was like one of those guys that would like write songs for a lot of like train didn't isn't that what I'm thinking of now? But what it was that there's this, what the fuck was trained? There was this one band. Fuck I'm not going to remember. I'm not going to remember. But I remember this as big as the one who writes the songs for, well he made headway in our work does, he released himself and it was pretty recently and it was a big hit, but it was like one of those songs were like, I couldn't get into it cause it was like it was well done, but I could tell that it was like a calculated things ticking over the book cause he's got formula that makes it worse.

Speaker 2:          00:22:19       Yeah. As opposed to like there's certain songs you know where like you don't, you don't even know why you like it. Like there's this, um, there's this, uh, old Leonard Skinner Song, the battle of Curtis Lowe. Yeah. You know, and it's, it's one of those songs were like you, the battle ballad rather of Curtis Lowe and it's one of those songs. We hear it. You don't even know what is going on that this song is just captivating me in such a unique way. Like cha making me emotional, like making me feel that moment and tell when they feel like that'd been written. A lot of that. Like one of the things I liked about the way that song introduction kind of blew up was no one kind of notice for ages that it's not got a chorus, it's not got a hook, right. It's no good anything. And he was kind of that people didn't notice that because they were kind of captivated and into it and didn't think about all right, you meant a kind of go verse, chorus verse, Chorus, bridge, you know, this kind of shit.

Speaker 2:          00:23:16       So it's kind of Nice when that works and you can tell it's just, he's just, uh, just what came out and what was natural. But you pieced that together, right? Like that's a piece. Like you started working on that, you've developed it. Do you, when you, when you do something like that and you develop a piece, do you write it all out and like what, like how long is that whole song is about three and a half months or so. Three and a half minutes. Yeah. And do you, do you develop it at three and a half minutes? Do you add to it along the way? Because it completely written before

Speaker 3:          00:23:46       you ever get to the stage. Yes. It's all completely written before I get to this stage. A lot of of that song in particular, I mean I'm no in stuff on my phone all the time. Um, and just, yeah, am making note of just good lines are good ideas or topics or subjects. I'd be have like a new line I just pops into your head and you want to add just Mike and I mean in Emma notes. Otherwise I'm going to have something awful in there now. Um, but it would just be notes even if it's just even if it didn't align or a turn of phrase I on my last note was saying about how loads of rappers at the moment of going on about game based mode, beast mode be anything. I've just written one sign through one about going Depeche mode. They said that's literally, there's no lyric.

Speaker 3:          00:24:25       They have no structured that yet but right. It's just right. I'll do something with that. So they don't have a song about that. Cause a lot of my songs are stories as well though. So, but one like that, it's easy to go through these kinds of weird little ideas or phrases or even like my bitsa philosophy and shit and shit like that just to go right. I'll put that in there. Right. That's the coolest thing about creating your own stuff right. As it, you could just decide what goes in, you could decide. And it's just, I mean, the thing that I buzzed about it the most is that you don't know what's good until you put it out there by genuinely on, on that one, there's a line or you see a mouse trap. I see free cheese and F if I can challenge it was just one of loads of lines.

Speaker 3:          00:25:05       And then when that came out, it's the one that everyone was going crazy on and everyone was tweeting. So I had no idea that that was the standout because you're so in it that, yeah. Yeah. It's got so much to you put it together. So that was one of many stand now that the whole thing, there's a lot of great lyrics in that, but yeah, that's definitely a standout part of it. That's, uh, that's, that's really cool man. I love anything like that where it's like one guy piecing something together, whether it's music or whether it's a book like talking to an author, but creating a book or whether it's a stand up comedian creating an act or a guy writing a, uh, you know, moving or anything. It's just, there's something about that creative process so much more now with us. So much more acceptable and doable because of the Internet and because of being out to get whatever your one passion is out there that you can kind of just be, it doesn't have to be a team of right as a team of people doing this and that you can find a lot more people who've got that just one vision and then just see where it turns into.

Speaker 3:          00:26:03       Yeah. Yeah. And when you like have this one thing that comes out of your own mind and you put it together and you, it's like we were talking about this with comedy. Like when somebody becomes a pip fan, like you're the only one that can give them that stuff like that. Then she, they were looking to see what comes out of your head. Yeah. You know, as crazy as, as, as, as well though. And I get, I'm sure it's the same with stand up. It's that weird thing of all of it. As much as you put into it, it's just what you think at the time. So a, but then it's committed to record and that's that. So five years down the line, my opinions or views by odd hope, my opinions and views will change in general, let on everything. But I think it's important to develop ideas and philosophies are constantly, so it's in that weird thing that people will have got that, that first record and being of listened to that one phrase or thing over and over and it's become their kind of mantra.

Speaker 3:          00:26:56       And then you're like, yeah, I kind of know into that as much anymore. I'm kind of delving into this shit now. This is what's going on now. And this, it's weird how that, yeah, that can be the thing that you can either give them what they need or you can't, if you know what I mean. Right. It's natural development. Hip Hop seems to be in a way a lot like standup comedy in that it's kind of generic and turn. Yup. But it's very broad in terms of content. It's very completely stupid paper who say I love comedy or I love hip hop. You'd have specific comedy and a specific hip hop. There's loads of shit, comedy, there's loads of shit. Hip Hop, there's loads of shit. Shit, shit, spoken word. I like good comedy problems. Right. You know, I've got my specifics I like, so yeah, it's, it's another one that a guy, um, I work with sometimes sage Francis was saying in an interview recently, it's got to the point now where when people talk about hip hop, you can't assume that they're talking about the same thing as him.

Speaker 3:          00:27:52       And again, I think that's because it's so broad. There's such a variation in there. Yeah. Yeah. There's a giant broad variation and it's interesting. It's like a, if you went to a club and it just said rock and roll, we'll, you'd know it would be rock and roll. But if you went to a club just said music, well hip hop is like, it's such a very specific type of music, but inside the genre there's like a bunch of different variables, right? Yeah, hugely. Again, when our I f I first started off and I was talking about and trying to get my name out there, I'd struggled to describe what I do because if I said hip hop and people instantly thought with 50 cent or cane because of 50 cent or candies, like you're not going to be happy with what you get. Or equally they might be put off because they're not into that and it's like, well this might not be right.

Speaker 3:          00:28:38       They might think that you would, you know, you'd be affecting a certain type of behavior and exactly. They think, I'm going to speak in an American accent and B, are you allowed to say wicker? Is that, is it a, is wigger a a white guy? Liga has it become an issue? It doesn't seem like it. Like you can call someone that and it's not like dropping an n bomb. Right? Like, even though it sounds a lot like it with a w you're allowed to let us slide. It's fine and don't have a heart, but there is that kind and then there's what you're doing, which is like a completely different thing. Like you're talking and you're making sure Brian, but you're also making statements and it's very entertaining, but it says it's a form of hip hop, but it's a very different form of hip hop. Yeah, yeah, completely. And it's key. It's the entertainment part is key as well because I think a lot of people who do the more conscious stuff, it's just like, yeah, it's a lecture. You know what I mean? You kind of just being fed this and it feels like they can't. Trying to get across just how intelligent they are and all this. I'm kind of in all my stuff. It's trying to open up discussion rather than say, here's the the beginning and end of, of

Speaker 2:          00:29:42       of this subject. It's kind of saying like there's some shit that we should maybe all think about a bit more or discuss a musical culture in general more but not trying to say I've got all the answers. Here's, yeah, here's my shake I name. Yeah. Yeah. I love the fact that there's so many different genres in hip hop now cause I think that uh, I've always been a fan of, I'm a fan of all kinds of different, like I'm a fan of your style but I'm also like a big fan of like old school Geto boys, you know, completely. I've got over a radio. Damn. It feels good to be a gangster. Came on the radio the other day and I was like fuck, this is the shit. This song is the shit. That's how you, for fingers when I'm in La is because you've got radio stations that just play just old hip hop and proper kind of hip hop or all day long and yeah, I don't have that in the UK. I miss Scarface. Scarface still putting out shit is a new track like six months ago too. I'm need to, I need to get back in scar face. I forgot what a good rapper he a diary was. Damn. It feels good to be against that. And that album cover with the guy's eyeball hanging out. Yeah. We can't be stopped. Geto boys, man. That's Bushwick. Bill shot himself in the eye there. They were the craziest. Yeah, that was some fun fucking music, man. My mind is playing tricks on me, dude. Dude, dude.

Speaker 4:          00:31:03       I was Joe. I was at, when I was in at Florida for doing comedy just last weekend, there was this fetish con going on and so it was like Mark Marin, uh, you know Chris harder going, a few of us just all hanging out this bar watching all these freaks. It was like being at like a AVN with dominatrix is and people in gimp suits and stuff like that. Wow. And there was this woman, this guy that was dressed up as a woman with a face mask on and she just stared at us and didn't move in the face. Masks had this creepy like smile on it. And it was the most disturbing thing ever. I have a photo of it somewhere. Just fetish people. Yeah, just fetish people. And then in Jacksonville I went to this borough bar and uh, there was a band that was about to start in the next room and out of nowhere this band jumps off stage and goes into the room that the bar area that we're at and starts playing right into the crowd, like jumping on like, like the tables of the bar and stuff. And then at the end they caught the symbols on fire and that place was like on fire. It was the most intense, amazing band I've ever seen. And it was just like a band. I just popped into a bar and saw this amazing band. And so if you should check out the video sometime of them, they're really interesting band, but it's cool seeing like libraries, music, combat. Uh, their name is doc. Oh, hold on. I want to make sure I say this right. Daca Sui or something like that. It's a

Speaker 2:          00:32:21       hello here. I'll get it to you. Yeah. People online that are listening. Yeah, yeah. Here I'll find it. I'll find the proper spelling. I'll be right back. Okay. All right. Um, I don't know where the fuck we were going before you just derailed Gary. Sorry. It's

Speaker 4:          00:32:36       d a n I k a. J

Speaker 2:          00:32:40       you and the inside that's me is pip was tough, Huh? Yeah, right. Bam. That's ridiculous. And here, here's actually them playing outdoors, which is completely different than what you'd

Speaker 7:          00:32:50       normalcy. The lead singer. The guy right there in the face mask hasn't seen mass. That was at the fetish con that was just staring at us the whole time.

Speaker 8:          00:33:03       Wow. This is kind of wow. Uh, [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:33:30       you could imagine the Admin, a small bar and like things are on fire in front of you moms. These are good. These guys are good.

Speaker 8:          00:33:40       That's a bad mother fucker. [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          00:34:17       you couldn't hear and you didn't hear sound and you were trying to figure out what the fuck to make this totally silent.

Speaker 2:          00:34:25       Imagine if you didn't hear sound and you see all this moving around and see all these people staring at these guys just playing with these sticks in their hands. You'd be like, what the fuck is going on? On that stage? Why is everybody watching that? It, it's this, it's a weird Gig, man. You're creating cool sounds with a stick. Yeah. You get this big piece of wood, you creating wild sounds with it. That's really interesting. Here's, here's how I

Speaker 8:          00:34:52       [inaudible] just walking around the whole entire bar wireless and they can be different

Speaker 7:          00:35:05       guys. Then maybe even have to do these guys get cocky. The fucking put a mask on a new dude firearm and it's good to see that is learned and moved up to wireless because clearly the code was restricted him in the first one as he wanted to go run around. Here's I'm on top of the bar. He was like doing this shape. That's cool. One fire. He was like just leaning on like sitting on my lap for the most.

Speaker 8:          00:35:33       That's wild.

Speaker 2:          00:35:35       Yeah. So check them out so they don't sing. They just play out. They just jam like fucking crazy dude. Like style almost. Yeah. So their name is d. A. N. I. K. A. I. J. U. D. I like that man. I like that idea. That's pretty cool. I love that they've got hard and aim. To me. That's right. That's even though you spell it out twice now. I've no idea what the name is. Arnold Schwarzenegger's to good fallback. It doesn't matter. It doesn't, it doesn't run shit doesn't mean shit. Yeah. Crazy neighbor fuckers. Yeah. It's a weird thing. And then like the names, it's important to write the right the right letters and words never tell if it's, it's, it's like if, if, if, if the doors is a good name or it's a good name because of the doors, Jeremy. And if so if you were at some shitty Gig in the local band and the door's never happened and they were called the doors, it probably wouldn't be as, as, uh, as awesome as it is.

Speaker 2:          00:36:28       Right. It's, isn't it fascinating though? The names are about picking a pleasant sound. Yeah. That you can remember. And it's easy to replicate with letters. Like if you have too many, like what is this Dika what the fuck is this? Get out of here with that shit, dude. No one's going to remember that shit. And you go anything more about it now because of the Internet. Because if you pick a name that too familiar than when you Google it, you're going to get, yeah. You know some crazy. Yeah, whatever it is you've chosen. Yeah. Right. Stricted yeah. Especially if you, and what is, how does it work when you hear bands of the same name as other bands? I never know. I guess someone has to argue it. You know like the love assassins like this must be like more than one love assassins. See original regional love assessment, you know, I mean I just need that name up but I'm sure it exists.

Speaker 2:          00:37:16       I'm not the first person that think that way. Right. That's a path that's like, that's like looking at like a section of street and trying to imagine that no one ever walked down, that somebody walked down that I might not have seen it, but it's happened. So like how many different guys could come up with something like the love assassins, you know, you've just got up become the biggest, I love assassins out there that you're going to be the biggest ones. Then the Yahoo, the love assessments. Do you think there was another kiss? Like kiss seems like a go or have been, had to have been at least one other band thought about becoming the name kiss set. Probably if he, if, if somebody kind of retired or not as popular now you could just be like, hey no, my name's Nwa now and just because you're more popular, you could kind of would win at that argument.

Speaker 2:          00:38:01       Right. I don't know man. I think that's probably trademarked because it's such a huge business. But I think like when you're first coming up and you don't have any legal paperwork, that's when it's only an issue. Cause like if you tried to be Jimi Hendrix today, they'd be like shut the fuck up pitch change manager. But no, I'm, that's my new name is Jimi Hendrix. I'm Jimmy Hendrix. But they would be like, no Jimmy Hendry you can't be a musician and be Jimi Hendrix. There's fucking, there's a copyright on that shit. But I could be milli Vanilli. Well no one wants to be so I bet they would just let you. Yeah. Have you tried to be Milli Vanilli but I bet [inaudible] owns that shit. Like, say if you and Jamie

Speaker 1:          00:38:36       decided to go on tour as Millie and vanilla and you started doing with like, you would lip sync and other people would sing the songs. You get your ass sued.

Speaker 9:          00:38:43       Yeah. Yeah, for sure. If he only did like the vanilla part, even vanilla, they probably own Milli Vanilli they owned both of those. Yeah. Yeah. They own it. Don't you think they own it, Ross?

Speaker 1:          00:38:56       Well, Rick Ross is different because Rick Ross, the original Rick Ross was not a rapper. I mean, that's the whole reason why he has those tee shirts that say Rick Ross is not a wrap.

Speaker 9:          00:39:04       He was just unsigned. He wrapped all the time in the shower. I bet. [inaudible] Christmas time. He was rapping. Well, he was a notorious drug dealer,

Speaker 1:          00:39:13       a genuine nice guy. I really like Rick Ross. He's a cool guy. He's got a book out now. By the way, if, uh, if anybody's interested, um, Rick has a brand new book and people have been asking us to get him on the podcast again and we wish definitely should. Um, Rick Ross book, I'm just giving them plug the real Rick Ross freeway, Rick Ross, I'm told by the, yeah, the untold autobiography, that's what it's called. And he's a, he's got a fascinating story if you're interested. His, his story is he was the connection between the Iran Contra affair and selling drugs in Los Angeles. He was one of the connections he was being supplied by a guy who was channeling that money that he made from Rick Ross directly into foreign operations. It's crazy. The whole story is crazy. And the dude, when he went to jail, didn't even know how to read. Okay. And in jail, taught himself at a read, then became a fucking legal expert and found the loopholes in his, uh, in his prosecution where they fucked up, found holes in the prosecution's angle and craziness from God himself off. Got himself out. They hadn't been like a three strike situation and he, uh, he got out of that because it has to be three sentences. It can't be three crimes as three sentences. So they, they, they prosecuted for him. It, it, they prosecuted him for it illegally. It was incorrect use of the prosecution.

Speaker 9:          00:40:44       It's kind of weird though than that he wouldn't have educated himself or potentially wouldn't have educated himself in such a manner as if he hadn't been been put away. So it's kind of, it's odd to come out of that with, you know, improved and better and yeah. Yeah. He's a fascinating case. It's a very fascinating case and he's a very good guy to, you know, put up with Rick Ross or using your name and they have all these sued him and lost,

Speaker 1:          00:41:09       which is really crazy. I mean one will have a mom, I'm sure he'll be able to tell us. I don't know if they're a continuing the lawsuit. Well maybe we can.

Speaker 9:          00:41:16       Right. It's a weird one with that cause it's more of a regular names. Jimmy Hendrix that's there. You know, you're not going to hear that every day. But Rick Ross, it feels like it'd be a tougher one to, to sue over cause yeah, I dunno. Yeah. Rick Ross when lawsuit

Speaker 1:          00:41:33       against freeway, Rick Ross. Wow. Freeway. Rick Ross lost his lawsuit against Rapper Rick Ross born William Leonard Roberts on first amendment grounds the case. Wow. First amendment grounds, freedom of speech. So I guess you're allowed to take on the persona of a, a known drug dealer because it's like, it's a persona. So it's like artistic expression

Speaker 3:          00:41:58       that it's like Bonnie and Clyde Shit. You know, like I can probably call myself Bonnie and Clyde or by, yeah. But if they were old

Speaker 1:          00:42:04       live, would you be able to, you know? Yeah. But the full name Rick Ross, the Real Rick Ross knew about the entertainers stage names since 2006 Oh, that case originally began in 2010 and later appeal to a higher court after the lawsuit was ruled untimely. Since the real Rick Ross knew about the entertainer stage names since 2006 so the idea was that the first time it was ruled untimely because he didn't act quick enough, you know, but I think that there was, there was some issues, the real Rick Ross said, where he had talked to Rick Ross and like he was going to be compensated for it. Right. And then memory said he was going to chop it up with him. Remember that he said, we'll chop it up, we'll chop it up. Like he was gonna give him some money and then he decided not to and then decided to go to lawsuits with them. So fucking shady.

Speaker 3:          00:42:59       Explain why he took time over it and why he got around to that. But yeah, that and now that is a very different sort of a hip hop. Yeah, completely pick any say hip hop I love is everywhere. Is that the people think that just because I do a certain kind of hip hop that I think every kind of hip hop should be like that. It'd be boring as hell. Liberal Hippo. I was out that you after to have the variation in the genre and yeah. How much do you think the real Rick Ross, she'd get paid by the fake Rick Ross? Like if you were the judge? Half depends how much the holy shit. That's crazy. That's like being married to, that's too much, much.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       Maybe 10% though. 10% might not be upset. 10% seems fast. Look, you didn't even have to wrap less. That dude uses name. That dude makes him more popular. Here's the thing about the real Rick Ross. Emotional sweet. You're a sweet guy. I like him a lot about you. But here's the thing about, um, like think about the real Rick Ross like we know about the real Rick Ross because his story is fascinating and we've talked to him and he's an interesting guy, but we also know about the real Rick Ross because the fake Rick Ross got famous as fuck with the same name. Yeah. So how much would you know about Rick Ross if he wasn't getting fucked over by the fake Rick Ross? I submit, not nearly as much. I submit that quite honestly, the f the real Rick Ross has benefited substantially from the fake Rick Ross using his name. And it actually makes him even more legit because this fake fat rapper used to be a d, a corrections officer is using his shit.

Speaker 4:          00:44:35       I think the tie their table, that table has kind of changed a little since Rick Ross, the fake Rick Ross has now become who he is. He's like, you know, big, he is now a huge moneymaker. So now 10% I think is completely fair and everyone should just be happy and have dinner together and maybe going to go on tour together.

Speaker 1:          00:44:53       But the, the real Rick Ross, the real Rick, the original drug dealer, Rick Ross is benefiting substantially like publicity wise to being connected with this. I mean, he has an amazing story on his own, but the reality is that this store is made more compelling by the fact that there's a guy running around stealing his name. He's benefited from it. It's really crazy when you think about it, you know, and I wonder if, what the thinking of the time of it, what was the, when he probably first heard of this, this rapper Rick Ross, he probably didn't think it was that huge deal. But then when it, when Rick Ross becomes one of the biggest rappers in the world, then suddenly that's, that's a change during this part of it. Or why would he always had been trying to fight the, I think he always, you know, names even when he came out of jail, Rick Ross was famous.

Speaker 1:          00:45:43       Yeah. He just wasn't as famous as he is now. He's become really super. But yeah, his book I'm sure wouldn't be what it is if it wasn't for, well, the story is amazing. The story itself is amazing. I mean, he was a tennis standout in high school, couldn't go to college because he couldn't read. So he was an athlete and was like stranded in this terrible neighborhood. Didn't know what the fuck to do. So he started selling drugs and became this giant truck dealer and he was making like some insane amounts of money, millions of dollars a week. I mean, he was just making just stupid money and it was all being funneled to the, the United States law, all these covert operations overseas and in Nicaragua, it's crazy. I mean, it was, uh, the whole Oliver Stone of the whole, um, uh, uh, Reagan Contra Fair. And, um, the fuck's his name?

Speaker 1:          00:46:34       Oliver. What's his name? Stone. No, the all over north. Thank you. The Oliver North situation, these guys on trial in front of the fucking tired country. No one's ever seen that shit before. You know, and Reagan, they're asking him if he sold arms to through other, other, other countries and shit. This was all like part of that same era, you know, the same era of all this crazy shit going on. The, we're finding out the government's involved with him. One of the things was selling drugs in the Los Angeles neighborhoods, the poor neighborhoods, and taking that money like the CIA was selling drugs. And our late great friend Michael Rupert who passed away recently, Michael Rupert, who was a narcotics investigator for the Los Angeles Police Department, he uncovered that Shit. They did that. Um, that thing where he stood out in front of that a press conference. They have this press conference and he, he yells out like in, in the middle of this conference that he, that they, he, he knows that the CIA has been selling drugs in Los Angeles communities and that he's caught them. I mean this guy says this crazy on, on television and the whole, the whole crowd failed with black people. They start cheering, they're all excited about it and it's like he's just standing up and like what a fucking crazy perky was.

Speaker 9:          00:47:52       Yeah. We've been following the latest, you know what the anonymous and the whole shooting of that

Speaker 1:          00:47:58       kid, the other kid in St Louis. Yeah. That's all ugly, man. That's ugly. The Qin Saint Louis is ugly and there was the other kid in the Walmart that are the fake gun. Yeah. Just like what the fuck is going on man. You know, there's an old expression, but it's a really valid one. Is that when the only tool you have is a hammer? Everything looks like a nail. Yeah. Yeah. And that's the problem with this society that we have when people, you know, you give them guns and you put them in situations where if they make a bad call, someone dies. You know, if they make a bad call, they freak out. Someone dies. A huge

Speaker 9:          00:48:37       of difference to have that they have that on you and yeah, as an option.

Speaker 1:          00:48:41       But it's also like I don't know what the options are because if you take their guns away from them and then ask them to enforce crime in a place where a lot of people have guns, boy is that even feasible? It's like disarmament seems like the, the choice that liked to really cautious people would choose. Like we, everyone needs to just give up their guns but that's never going to happen. Like people have to accept the fact that there's always going to be people that keep illegal guns if anybody tries to do that and they'll be, they'll be doing it with in their mind the full

Speaker 9:          00:49:12       approval of the constitution. The second day Australia, like when they've got rid of change all their gun laws and got rid of guns and it was seen as it couldn't work and they have not really had any incidents since they've changed their downloads because they used to be exactly the same as America. I don't know all the statistics on it, but I used to be the same as American and they had one really bad major July, ah, ash shooting a shoe in and um, they changed their gun laws as a trial thing, I think in this particular state or area. And it's maintained and it's worked again, that all the same thing that people said, you cut it, you can't take people's guns away. People and they did are people protesting against it. But then a year on kind of everyone's,

Speaker 1:          00:50:00       the problem is I think you trust your government a lot more than we trust ours because our government likes starting wars. Yeah. Yeah. And our government as a history of not being honest with us, our government has a history of trying to suppress us. And physically,

Speaker 9:          00:50:16       I mean it seems for every on a yearly basis for every huge story there is a member of the public going out and killing people doing, there's then a police story of as well. So it kind of

Speaker 2:          00:50:28       fuels them both. I was tweeting that whole thing of where we are. If we don't trust the police then we need to be armed and then place exactly the same as you've said, if they are police in an area where everyone's got guns, it's kind of, yeah, people need to come to an agreement and that's not going to happen. While it's also a problem, when you, whenever you have a group of people that become sort of responsible for the actions of an individual, right? If you have a hundred cops in one cop does something really fucked up than cops are pigs, you know, and all these other cops get lumped into this one group instead of it being an individual that was in a position of power that did something fucked up. It's the cops. So then it's the cops versus the people. Yeah. And that's madness.

Speaker 2:          00:51:07       You know, it's all madness. The Guy who shot that kid for sure is a piece of shit. You know, he fucked Diane. That cops in general. Yeah. It doesn't mean, I mean I'm, who knows what's going on through this guy's head. The other thing about these guys, a lot of them have PTSD. They have like we, you know, you talk about PTSD for people that go away and they fight in wars and then come back. While a lot of those guys that do that become cops, first of all, when they come back, it's a good gig for soldier. You've already used to being in the shit. It's probably mild in comparison to what you've seen and you know, I could probably handle stress better than the average person. It's like if you look at for a Gig, it's probably the, it's going to make you more comfortable pulling your gun as well.

Speaker 2:          00:51:44       Right. That's true too. And you know, you also used to, I mean especially if you had to have active, you've actually been in combat and if you've been in combat, you've, you've definitely shot people. If you'd definitely shop people to be easier to shoot somebody. Again and you also probably your senses, your whole sense of like what's on the line would probably be much, much more like sharp than a person that's never seen people killed. Like you're right, you're like this could happen at any second. You better stop this before it happens. You have like a much shorter like line of bullshit that you'll tolerate and this, you know, that's if you're in a war zone as to be expected, but that war zone becomes a streets if you have the same attitude and your deal, but it's just going to happen that way. When you have people and they hate each other and there's a group here and a group there that comps in the citizens and you have a situation like this, things will be flared up for years now.

Speaker 2:          00:52:35       It's annoying how it has to be such a group thing and these people against or they use people. There was a song out about two years ago now, it's the kind of, just before the Trayvon Martin stuff happened and it was called film the police. And it was a rewrite of Nwa funded police. And it was just caught in everyone to, but we've all got phones now it's saying, right, the police are placeness, but there's issues. So rather than being less, rather than being a fucked up place, being just make sure you me filming stuff. And it was just a huge backlash from people in support with the police saying, no, this isn't fair. And it's like, well, it's not saying that film the police and catch them all out to shit. It's like the good ones won't be doing anything bad. So it's not, it's not a negative thing, you know? But if you're, if you're using more or watching the watchman as it a kind of thing, then it

Speaker 3:          00:53:26       starts to then police itself. And hopefully, I don't think there's anything wrong with the idea of filming police. Nah. And I think there's also a lot of evidence that when police are forced to wear cameras that film all their actions, they're the, there's a, the thing about the hemorrhoid. Yeah. The uh, allegations of abuse dropped by 80%. Yeah. And someone actually said this the years because people can't claim fake abuse. Now, if somebody actually said it to me on Twitter, I'm like, or cops know that they can fucking do, do shit because you're wearing a camera. It's great. Again, I mean cops are people, there's good ones and bad ones lately in the UK. Are you realize now that it was a time when the cops were the best of the best, but that's not the case anymore. There's, there's a variation. There's some people who are genuinely good citizens trying to make the change, but I knew people who, who worked with me in the record store and didn't get kept on and became a policeman instead, sorry, you couldn't do retail and now your police in the streets kind of illness as crazy.

Speaker 3:          00:54:26       That's not as not the best of the best that he should or was being police should be like being the night's watch. Yeah. It should really be like you're the guy whose garden, the, the, the top of the wall. I mean, that's really what it should be like. It's like, yeah, she'd be a revered position of noble people, you know, martial artists, people who are, you know, they actually want to do good, have a coding safe, uh, politicians. Now, like we all complained about how older politicians are kind of scumbags. It's like, cause he's not appealing job like normal people like us wouldn't, there's no appeal in being a fucking politician because you're imagining how it would be the mayor or something. They said pip, it's your time. It's the worst nightmare. That shift that was like the draft. Like you just get it drafted to be a fucking mayor.

Speaker 3:          00:55:09       Like out of nowhere, we would like your lyrics. You're going to be the mayor now. You're like, what? And they fucking show up at your door with accountants. You got to go over the budget, like how much you wanna spend on medication. What, how much you wanna spend on the government? What is scratch one spend on sewage, what span tillage? And we got a water bill. We all Colorado, what? Yeah, fuck all that man. And that's the problem because everybody says fuck all that. And the only people that don't say fuck all that are the ones who could make some money from it or can be or hopefully are really dedicated to trying to help people. You'll hope but good fucking luck. Good luck with all that. Especially in this day and age, we're going to need some dust to settle the semester. I mean it's just with the whole politics thing you need to know, I kind of argue with people on online about this all the time because I think the way your democracy is currently set up and that the democracy is currently set up, there's no chance of any real change like anytime soon because it's a gradual, it's slight changes either way, but nothing else is discussed.

Speaker 3:          00:56:09       We need to protect the ideals of democracy and it's like, well, why? Yeah, I think there's, I mean there's, I'm going completely off on tangent nowadays. There's hundreds of different kinds of ocracy kinds of ways to run a society. Number one add democracies we've got aren't real democracies, right? They kind of, it's the two party system and all this coming. So it's not a real, we just vote and that's who gets in and they're often being funded by the same company. Exactly. It's the same. Incredibly ridiculous. And there's loads of, I mean I was just discussing recently and it pisses people off because it kind of shows a level of elite isn't that people are scared of, but I think going on stuff based on, on a Marriott, Chrissy and stuff like that where say your vote would be worth more than the guy who, who is sitting at home in a trailer and doesn't know anything about politics.

Speaker 3:          00:56:59       But that good though that's kind of dangerous from one person's vote is worth more than another. It's, it's measured. So for example, my theory on it being if when you go to vote there's a short questionnaire on politics or on social on society or something. And that ranks or what you wear, but isn't that subjective? I mean, first of all, there's just information like you could have information about politics. That's one thing. Like you know, when was Eleanor Roosevelt, this one was on policies, on policies and and what's what's actually valid at the moment. Because then even if people than just bone up on it to try and cheat the system. That's good. They're reading about what the policies are. They learning it rather than just going and taking the box that they're family have always supported Republicans. Therefore that's that. That's forcing people to have some level of education in it to make their vote worth more.

Speaker 3:          00:57:50       Yeah. Maybe I'm hanging on to the idea that everyone should have an equal vote and that it shouldn't be like an earned thing and you earn it by having an education about the system. And there's a great quote, great quote that says we're not all entitled to our own opinion. We're all into our auto, our own informed opinion. Because again, everyone quotes, I think I'm entitled to my opinion said, well, no. If someone's done more research on it and knows about it, then there's, there is right and wrong. You can't just say, okay, well in my opinion I'm entitled to it. On a lionfish is, yeah, there's some issues where it's not. There's some issues where it's just a subjective judgment. One person would agree, one person would disagree, like there's certain issues that people are very, very passionate about that you have polar opposite people absolutely dedicated to their opinion and won't budge.

Speaker 3:          00:58:37       Yeah, like abortion, that's a great thing, but then it's an informed opinion is not just a kind of, sometimes not even though sometimes there's not an informed opinion. Sometimes people just get on a side and that's their side. Stuck on that side can get crazy, but that's people. That's a super common thing. That's a super common thing. Like take on republican talking points or take on liberal talking points. Really Common or oh, the bibles that, the key example of that where people are just blindly, we'll vast fast. That's my belief and therefore I will fight any arguments against it despite any logic and theories and yeah, in reality. Yeah, that's a big one. That's a common one because you know, that's one

Speaker 2:          00:59:22       that has been used for so many years for so many people and it's become just a oh well paved path that everybody could walk on. It's a great structure and set up our first song that, um, got vehicle at when I was working with regard done a sac was called are always Kale when it was just a rewrite of commandments. It was a load of commandments for now. And I'm not religious, but the reason I think it hit through with people is this a simple structure that you all know and are familiar with, but, and that's why it works for religion as well as in a spoken word hip hop song. It's kind of is that simplicity of, you know, the stories and the structures, therefore you can get a point across that isn't about religion, but by using those, that's more about society and people, but using that template of what religious people have laid down for us.

Speaker 2:          01:00:14       Yeah. What religious people of rate laid down and you know the variance in like how much they vary from one to the next. Like how much Judaism varies from Islam. Various can Christianity, how much they borrow from each other. Like some of these wrong, somebody's wrong. Well let's just break down like what you guys are actually what, what are we supporting here? And we supporting the idea that there is a guy and this guy watches over everything and he made everything. He's allowing all this crazy chaos and he told us once a few thousand years ago how to live your life. And if you don't pay attention to what the fuck he said back then, you're on your own. And so you're forced to be led by a bunch of people. He sees these people, he sees they're hypocritical actions, he does nothing. He allows them to distort his message and relay it in its most fucked up way.

Speaker 2:          01:00:58       That's ruining the earth itself. And still, he doesn't come down and correct anybody like this is what you're saying. Yeah. That's crazy. Are you sure? Or is this puzzle far too complex for our brains? Is this like an ant trying to understand a satellite? Because if you try to get an aunt to understand a satellite, it's outside of his realm of comprehension lately. And I think we have a realm of comprehension, whether we like to admit it or not. And I think the very nature of the universe itself is currently outside of our realm of comprehension, or at least the realm of comprehension of the average person. Me included. Phife has gotta be the most dangerous word ever made. But that's, that's the thing that the argument would, where do I say, well, you know, we were left here and we've got to have faith that God's going to do this and do that.

Speaker 2:          01:01:44       And it's all, all tests. But I've got my faith. It's like that's a massive get out clause for any argument of, well, we've never, you can't see this person. You can't prove. And it not only can not prove it, but you're having faith in something that looks very much like bullshit. Yeah. You know, if you look the stories you read, the guy came back from the dead, he was dead for three days and then he pushed her rock side and came back. Okay. Oh yeah. All right. I believe that. Okay, this is Adam and Eve's. There's two people and then they fucked and what happens? They have kids and then time though, right? Kids accepted. Cause everyone kind of jokes now and mocks Scientology cause of the ludicrousness of loads of, of what they say. But it's ludicrous because it's new. If it was thousands of years old, then people would be the same with Christianity and just kind of go, well, you know, it is kind of ludicrous, but [inaudible] Christianity's ludicrous.

Speaker 2:          01:02:39       Yeah. Have you have conversations with hardcore Christians about whether or not Christianity's ludicrous know, argue with you while why it's not? Yeah, and what the story's really represent and how the message of God comes through these stories. Like I think he's crazy, but there's, there's such a mixture as well in there. The study will be loads of questions that no, that all that stuff is kind of bullshit, but they believe what they believe and they believe their genomic, that they are just stories and all this kind of thing. So it's, well there's also, he's a levels within your own belief system. There's such a variation as people who would sit here now and go yam if less fucking crazy. But that devout Christians and yeah, there's people that just believe in God and they feel like the Bible is sort of a framework for good behavior that was laid down by this holy entity at one point in the past.

Speaker 2:          01:03:26       And that although the stories had been twisted and weird and you know that a lot of these stories, they probably represented something, something important a long time ago. And so you're getting these, this connection to God like through a game of me in that game of telephone or if you played it in England but you, you would tell a friend something and then he would tell friends something that he would tell friends. By the time it got down to Brian, I can tell you the story was dog shit. It was all fucked up. And I think that the idea is that in the UK it was called Chinese whispers, which sounds incredibly racist, but that's what it was. It was called Chinese whispers. It wasn't, that's that game anyway at telephone is a far better name for it and let's stick with that. But that whole idea is that at the end of that is God at the end of that has god and yeah, the story got mucked up, but the, the story did get fucked up.

Speaker 2:          01:04:18       But that story has a direct connection to God. And the way that grunt direct connection works is that at one point in time there was, there was something where someone was explained the very nature of the universe and then whether it's through psychedelic drugs, whether it was through an actual religious experience with a divine entity. And then from that point, what happened is that person told another person, that person told another person they did their best to remember everything that the people before them told them. But if you got through all that goofy Shit, all that Adam and eve stuff and all that fucking, although the, the, the more weird and ridiculous and preposterous stories in any religion, if you got through all that and went back to the source, you almost are still connected in some sort of a weird, bizarre and maybe like a, um, like an all like almost like a mathematical way you're connected to the original story. Yeah. You know, the, his original

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       story, the original story turns into this, his memory fucks it up. It turns into that. Like, is it correct at the end? Yeah,

Speaker 9:          01:05:23       no translations as well though. The trend line is, was all written in a language that is dead and people to very trans language, things like that. And it's like, whoa. Well there's two of them too far away from

Speaker 1:          01:05:35       does the, the oldest version that they found is the stuff that's in Qumran that's the Dead Sea Scrolls. Yeah. Though the, some of the same stores that are in the Bible, so these are the oldest versions by like a thousand years. And I think they're the only ones that are in Aramaic. It's an Aramaic and it's written on animal skins. Yeah, it's fucking crazy. They piece together to Dead Sea scrolls with and a, they made sure that they got the DNA of the same cow so they knew if this the same cow, it most likely was the same piece of paper because they were all different counties and different pieces of paper and they had to figure out like which, which animal skins cause all these crumbs and pieces and they had a piece them together over decades. Man. Just, it's craziness. Madness and that is what all the faith and belief so based on, and they just really in this shit man, it wasn't like

Speaker 9:          01:06:23       1947 again, there's that old, I think it was in a TV series in the UK. There was as a joke thing, have they found the original first page of the Bible just saying that um, any resemblance to people in real life is purely coincidental and so on and so forth from that. It's just a book of fiction and some found out thing.

Speaker 1:          01:06:43       Yeah. In my, the best version of the world. It would be that you get to the end of the Bible and it just says psych.

Speaker 9:          01:06:49       We were on mushrooms. That would be the best version before bear left. David Copperfield.

Speaker 1:          01:06:57       I ate it all up. Yeah. 1946 I collection of 981 texts was discovered, uh, between 46 and 56 took some 10 years in this area in the West Bank called Qumran and they were found inside caves about a mile inland north of the North West shore of the Dead Sea and really interesting shit, man. Nine or the scrolls were rediscovered at the Israeli antiquities authority in 2014 after they'd had been stored unopened for six decades following their excavation in 1952 the texts are of great historical, religious and linguistic significance because they include the earliest known surviving manuscripts of works later included in the Hebrew Bible Canon along with due to rada bow doodle raw cononical Deuteronomy due to Ra Deuteronomy.

Speaker 9:          01:07:50       Me Too.

Speaker 1:          01:07:54       Sure. Oh, you know, this is how like my wife is saying this to me the other day. It's interesting when you're raising kids and you're teaching them how to say words and you know you have to spell it and you, you see how it's difficult. Well, when you learn a new word like this, like you know Deuteronomy, I could just say it and it would be easy, but I'm trying to figure it out as I'm saying like a little kid, like that's kind of never goes away due to row. Can Non Nicole do the row canonical and extra biblical manuscripts which preserve the evidence of the diversity of religious thought in the late Second Temple Judaism. Interesting. Interesting. Interesting stuff man. Yeah. From 408 BCE and 318 BCE. Man, they don't really know though.

Speaker 9:          01:08:41       It's crazy that it's just that the barbell is just a collection of stories and not one Johnny wasn't written as one thing. You kind of think of it as the Bible, but sign that pops of the stuff on the, on the Dead Sea scrolls were stories included in the Bible.

Speaker 1:          01:08:54       Yeah. Yes. Just pick 400 shoes. Bce. Wonder what the oldest known. That's the, um, the old, that's the range. The, so the oldest one, they found 400 APC. I wonder what the oldest version of the Hebrew Bible is. If you had to guess 40 years, shut up, bitch. This ridiculous. What do you think? Like the oldest version of the Hebrew Bible clue 3000 years. Cause I, I'm at assumed that actually the Dead Sea scrolls were from earlier than that. I'd read some something that must've been incorrect that said it was a older than that. Okay. The oldest surviving Hebrew manuscript, including the Dead Sea Scrolls, second century BCE. Well, this is a gift Wikipedia and it's given me a different date because they were saying for like four oh eight. Right? Was that what the uh, the, the longest version. Uh, so that is like the oldest version. That's the oldest version of the Hebrew Bible or the oldest oldest version of the stories that are in the habit.

Speaker 1:          01:09:59       Yeah. Amazing. Imagine if you can go back to those dudes who wrote the Bible way back then and you could bring them in a time machine to 2014 and show them like they're the havoc that they've created. Have them explain. Yeah. What was that makes the whole page out there that had been tweak it a little? Well, it's so weird that it's, it gets translated into different languages. Like have you ever done one of those things where you take Russian and translate it to English and you try to like explain what the fuck they mean? Their language is so different than ours that it always comes out like he gives to country but fails not yet. You know, there's like, there's a weird weird interpretation of, of languages to English. So you gotta think you're going from a weird language like ancient Hebrew, which was, um, the, these to have, like their numbers were embedded in their words. So like there was no, there's no number.

Speaker 9:          01:10:47       What if it just started off as means? Like whatever. Just going back to how the Bible, you know, the language back then actually was just like, we all talk like a mean back then like I like you just said, that sounds like a meme. Almost like I go back home knee,

Speaker 1:          01:11:01       I'm saying no, no, no, no, that's not the Bible. You know, you're paying attention when I said that's like if you take Russian and interpreted to English. Right. That's not what I'm saying. Um, the, the, the um, just the ancient languages, like when they try that, I've got that translation and the original thing they read in is just so old and they're using DNA to kind of pace in the right order and all that kind of thing. It's mostly guessing, right? Well, no, not really guessing, you know, I mean, these fit, there's definitely pieces missing, but when they have stories that are like, when they translate, part of the story in the story is like very similar to like book of Genesis or something along those lines. They could sort of make those correlations if they have enough similarities. But there's a lot of those stories that are like, that man.

Speaker 1:          01:11:47       Like that when you go back to the oldest shit, that cuneiform that the Sumerians used to write in. Oh, it's so weird looking man. It's like these, these there, there was no like variation in the, like the way their letters were, the letters were all like these little wines. So they'd go down to like pull this up like cuneiform ancients who? Marion. It's weird, weird shit man. They would write in this Google search his head. Same place. Yeah. It's um, it's cool just right. Yeah. It's like, it would, it looks like is like a wedge that you would like to say with your trauma down a trade at a stick. A wedge and they're like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like they're more like wedges than they are. Like, it's not like a straight line. It's like there's a fat top and then it goes down to a lower bottom and they say this is how they wrote.

Speaker 1:          01:12:35       Like look at these things. How weird is that? Yeah, it's like all I know Jay's, yeah, it's so, it's so weird. I mean it's sort of like, um, it's so hard to imagine how different that is. Keep that up so we could look at that shit for a second. Look how weird that is. Like that's the language and they write these little columns and so much of it just just to us look in exactly the same look as similar shapes and sizes. Hacking that of the intricacies of, of a language. Yeah. If he's like, if you looked at that, that looks like dog shit. Like if you had your whole life to figure out what the fuck that means. Good luck. He was never figure it out. You'd never figure it out. So it takes like a team of linguists to pieces together and here's the crazy shit.

Speaker 1:          01:13:21       They don't even know what the word sounded like. Like there's a bunch of words in ancient Sumerians fucking guesswork. There was, there was a thing that someone had done a where they had a recreated what they believe ancient Sumerian sounded like, but it's so dead that no one can even talk it. Yeah, of course. Like how can you even start to see you how to pronounce the scratch ins that were on that thing then? So weird. Well, I don't know how they do it. I don't know. I know that they have like this is what it looked like. This is the language. Yeah, I guess some of them, oh, this is year by year. Will escrow make that a little larger so it gets hit as a year by year. Like let's scroll down so you can get to the top, to the top, to the top. We'll see 3,200 BC, 3000 BCE, and then you go all the way to the far right and it's just all the lines are thousand. Yeah. Wow. Those weird lines, man.

Speaker 9:          01:14:15       That's interesting. So this was like eight bit and this is like Xbox. They, they pretty much updated it to a better language. Have you ever white round? Oh, other way, Ramey, right, right. Yeah. Yeah. Well let's go. I'll be be partly down to the, the methods in which they were brought in. If, if they couldn't have done more intricate stuff. If you're, you're scratching into

Speaker 1:          01:14:38       clay, into clay and stuff like that. They also would make these rollers that would make these rollers and then they would lay out clay. And they would roll the roller into the clay and then baked the clay. So like the roller itself would be like a method of distributing like a newspaper. Like you'd be able to roll that shit and he'd put it in the clay and then you could do several times. Yeah. Yeah. So they had these weird things they used to do to make these clay tablets.

Speaker 9:          01:15:08       So you kind of have to make the newspaper yourself. Yes, I wear a gas. I mean, I can remember hearing is, it's crazy. The first the first adverts ever made were musical notes and that printed on the product you bought and you had to sing the advert yourselves as the first ever jingles Rhea cigarette pack per pack packets and that. But in those days, um, because yeah, there wasn't any radio and stuff like that and it, in those days everyone kind of had a piano or could, could, could play his shit. And yeah, the first ever, uh, jingles were printed and written out and people would sit around the piano and play the, the camel cigars.

Speaker 1:          01:15:46       Wow. That's wild. What origin of Jingles, which is the original jingles was advertising. Hey, pull up, uh, Sumerian cylinder seals and you could see these things they used to do where they used to lay this clay down and roll their message out onto the clay. And I guess like if you probably wanted to get a message to somebody, you would send a seal, you send one of these cylinders and then you, yeah, they would lay the clay out and they would roll a cylinder on the clay and it would read out what you had to say to them and that wild, what would you think this says? Like, Hey, those are the bird. Well, I think they range in a meeting that represents UFO was Brian, don't you get it? Look at the Griffin and the bottom UFO. That's an alien. The sea, those squirrely things. That's DNA. So what that represents is the alien came down from sky and Leo's rule and the griffins are awesome bird looking freaky lion things. And what of those lines on the top? It's like a male lion and a female lines that what's going on there?

Speaker 9:          01:16:49       Yeah. They're like high fiving what they're doing knuckles. So it looks like

Speaker 1:          01:16:52       this is the number one culture that the uh, ancient astronauts theorists point too. They love this stuff because it was so far ago. You like, who fucking knows? It's so long ago who the fuck knows what was really going on? But these people in ancient Sumeria, they had all this like, like they were really into stars. They had all these um, images of like the, uh, the galaxy. They had a, a depiction of the solar system with all the stars are all the planets rather in the correct orbit. It's really interesting. Yeah. Pull up a Sumerian, um, solar system. Ancient Samarian solar system. Is that horses having sex?

Speaker 9:          01:17:30       It's one goat looking when we, when go look the other way in some crazy thing in the middle going, what do you want from me? Everybody's banging everybody's name and put your message to about to send. We need to commit this cylinder. And you can get the word out about the way that that goat was looking. Well, it's like today,

Speaker 1:          01:17:44       have you ever made a note on your phone? And you couldn't remember what the fuck

Speaker 9:          01:17:47       mad like at the time. You like, I'll understand this so many times. Or waking up at night and thinking I've got a lyric or an idea, just note in it and they're looking at it going, what the, what is it that you wanted?

Speaker 1:          01:17:59       Um, Sumerian solar system. Yeah. Yeah. There's a, there's an image of the sun in the center and all these planets that are floating around the sun and they're all in like the sort of a similar sizes. Like see, see how it's like that. Similar to what the actual planets are. That's what it looked like in the, but pull it back. So you actually see the, the image of itself, the actual a cylinder image. You just had it. Oh yeah, you can see it. No, the image, the actual image of the, there's a clay image of it. See It on the right. That's it. Either one of those. That's the actual image. And if you see the op, see that right there. That's the solar system in between them. There's the sun and those circles. Those are the exact planets. And you know, the bigger ones are bigger and the small ones are smaller and they're all in the right orbit.

Speaker 1:          01:18:50       It's really weird. Yes. Way. Most likely the standard, what they think is, you know, when I've listened to many people give their opinions on these kinds of things and how do these people know what they knew and what I, I'm, I'm have an opinion that most likely at one point in time people were really fucking smart and they had gotten really far and they had learned a lot of shit and they had lived for a long time and then cataclysmic happened. They get hit by asteroids, they got hit by, you know, super volcanoes, whatever it is. And whatever was learned was forgotten and they started all over again. And he probably did it a gang of times

Speaker 9:          01:19:29       and paper to kind of argue against that. We'll say just that, yeah, would they have fly? Why aren't there cameras over or whatever. But I think the very nature of the, of that theory is there's no chance at all that their intelligence would have developed in the same way as did the technology. Wouldn't have developed in the same way. They could've been far superior yet. Never invented petrol or use electronics tonics, any of that. So that kind of, yeah, it makes sense of, it's our own arrogance now of going, but you know, they didn't have TV so I can't be that clip. I how they clever that I can go to. So true.

Speaker 3:          01:20:08       It's so, that's such a good point. And you know, I think that people from England have a bit of a better perspective of time than people in America because if you're in London, if you go through London, you'll see thousand year old buildings. Like you don't see that shit in America. A wedding in Boston once, and I had a dice burn up, popped into an antique store and it was like, oh by the fifties and sixties and it's like, that's not an antique store had to England antiques. There's like hundreds of years old or this old stuff for theirs. I, yeah, this is antiques. This is like ies. This is, this is a long time ago. It's like, no, that's not, that's not what Atlantic, here's my friend. Yeah. There's bars in London that are like a thousand years old, right? Yeah. That's so crazy. The whole place is, it's so different. Like when you're passing by the palace and you look at that thing, you see Buckingham Palace and you're like, well that that, that's a palace.

Speaker 3:          01:20:59       It's right here. They have a pallet and then it's another thing in Nis went driving around. I see a lot of the houses that are kind of castle like and they think that that's what a carceral looks like. It's like, have you been, have you been to a castle because castles aren't really, causes aren't just houses. We have a little square bit on top is that there are these built out or rocks and these huge things and you're always entertains me over here. The, yeah, all the different castles is like this. Isn't it weird that they sell castles? Like you can buy a castle? Yeah. Like you screw bees. Pip could go back to England and by a Goddamn castle. I want to counsel now who do I need to talk to about this? Joe Broken. I don't know. We need to find the guy. And connect you to him because I've watched some one of those home and garden shows, you know when they're like people work on how you a car so or you buy on a regional and old.

Speaker 3:          01:21:51       They had an old castle. They were trying to do an addition. Yeah, add ons to the castle and they had a fight like tooth and claw to get, they wanted to like put a garage on or something like that and like fuck off, you can't, it's a castle. But he's like, it's my castle. I'm like, nope, can't do it. Until they eventually let him do they want to topic a clicker for the drawbridge site. When they pull off, I can just come on. He'll be out like an RFID card. They put in your license plate soon as it recognizes your driving and opens up the drawbridge. No one else can get in. There's loading. There's a few different costumes and England that hotels now and you can just go and stay in a castle that is hundreds and hundreds of years old. I've, I've done that before and it's, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:22:32       Yeah. Imagine owning. You can though. I know people have, I've heard of people that are famous. People like by castle feel so rude to put a TV and everything. Even though later in this I would cast on your leg kicking it out. Yeah. You should uneven like it really probably shouldn't even have electricity. Nah, you want to do exams? Everything should be candlelight. Yeah. If you're going to do it right. I mean that's where England basically like, anyway, it's all holding candle there. I know. That's right. Is it really? That's the image that we give out. Check this out. You can get some castles right here. Kind of cancer. Video Castles.

Speaker 2:          01:23:06       Yeah. What kind of castle? What do you mean? It's like a, like, like a website? Yeah, it's all cal state website. I know one of them says the castle's a thousand pounds a million. Is that a million pounds? But it says what's a pound as it relates to a dollar.

Speaker 9:          01:23:20       Right at the moment the adult is, so that'd be about 1.8 million.

Speaker 2:          01:23:28       So 1 million pounds is 1.8 million deaths. Pretty good deal for a castle. Yeah. That seemed, it seemed crazy. It seems like castles or one of those things that really wouldn't appreciate very much. They don't probably worth castle in Transylvania after it. Well yeah. And it doesn't come with a vampire fuck that 47. Do you want to have a castle? Where do you, what do you weekend? Oh, we go to Transylvania. We have a summer home. Wifi would suck in a castle. Nonexistent. You probably would have to have satellite Internet. I mean, you might not even be able to get that. I guarantee you they haven't laid the lines down unless this castle has been used by people for a long time.

Speaker 9:          01:24:06       Alright. Uh, drove fruit, a trans surveying you on our last tour and it just feels like the most underused. Like they should put a Dracula Disneyland or some shit there. Yeah, right. It'd be the most, that'd be a huge tourist. And you go through and here's eerie and kind of run down and really no economy going on there and you just think this is Transylvania for fuck's sake. Surely that's the most surely asked, most marketable real location. Like most people's mind to find out that that's a real place. That's not just a fictional thing in a book. It's like this. They've got someone needs to go there and build a tourist results. You should do it. You should do it. You should contact a tourism board, a remortgage my castle and I like, I'll see if I can can open up Transylvania. But doesn't it seem like that would be like a dope idea? Yeah. No. And you think of loads of kind of what are way you have these um, amusement parks and things like that. It's normally in kind of shady areas where there isn't anything else anyway cause you don't want that in the middle of a town.

Speaker 2:          01:25:10       They'll say that about Anaheim sir. Exactly. That chance rude Orlando either. But it makes them a destination and oh yeah. Orlando used to big time destination just because of those. And if you like what kind of like if you had, Whoa, how about this? If you had a fucking spot where you had, it was like a amusement park, but it was all horror rides. Everything was fucking terrifying. Like they're doing an American Werewolf in London, Mays at universal for a Halloween, which I'll be attending every day. See that shit that's going to be fun did on mushrooms. But could you imagine that amusement park, purely fat outs. Amusement Park for adults in Transylvania. That's all Har. And then they set up, they set up the entire location. Like they have like fucking like speakers in the woods. We hear like horrible in the middle of the night while you're sleeping.

Speaker 2:          01:26:06       They scared the fucking shit out of you. Everywhere you go. Like people are a, instead of like, you know when you go to Disneyland, you see dudes are dressed up like fucking, you know, Mickey Mouse and goofy and you go by goofy's kitchen and goofy wavy. Instead of that, you have dudes made up and like full har outfits. I'm terrified of working this out of nowhere. Just had to know where they dive in. Funny [inaudible] and then take off into the bushes. They don't. They don't fuck with people. They don't hit them, but they scare the shit out of, I guess when you're going there though, you'd have to sign so much shit to say. You're not going to punch anyone. Oh, was it? Someone jumps out. Yeah, and this is something, I think this is like a camp where you go camping and it's pets a horror camp.

Speaker 2:          01:26:49       Oh Great. There's no, it sounds like a recipe for murder. It's probably really annoying. Well, if you were like a crazy fucking wanted to kill people, like Jason Style, wouldn't you want to do it at this camp? It seemed so appropriate. Yeah. [inaudible] in the UK now where they have kind of these Zombie two things or web and it'll be in an old shopping center or something that you'll pay to go and be part of it and it will be all act. Just kind of just jumping in and chase and you were zombies and you'll be, yeah. Living out the Zombie apocalypse. Yeah. Again, all of that just feels how many of those actors get punched in the face or, or someone just reacting in panic and her in people. What they really need to do is make real zombies. I mean like artificial real Zombie have like, well you do is you make like a Mike to day a person that's not really a person.

Speaker 2:          01:27:41       So now we are person. It's dead. He showed Scott it's shriveled up brand but it can move and it comes at you like it's going to bite you and you have a sword and there's like hundreds of them and it's like a new amusement park. And this is when bioengineering gets to like a really high level. Like you know it's been said a million times, but the phone, the process of that you have in your phone was far greater. It's far greater than the processes of put people on the fucking moon. Yeah. Right. Okay. So imagine what kind of technology they're having today. They're starting to develop all these artificial cells. They can artificial skin, they're going to develop artificial body parts. It's going to get to a point where about thousand years from now you're going to be able to make zombies and know everyone's gonna know it doesn't have a soul.

Speaker 2:          01:28:23       You can just chop this fucker up. I be carrying as a Zombie donor card to say that we're not die. Definitely. I want just turn me into a Zombie, but I'm saying artificial many fly free access to it. People are never gonna allow that and see that's, that's the difference what you're talking about as an actual person that becomes a Zombie. So complete. I'm talking about as a constructed artificial person that never had the potential to be an actual person. It's made entirely. Yeah. You know factory that has no soul whatsoever, but it's made out of an artificial flesh with bones and moves at you and it's trying to buy you out on what do you do? You fucking sword fight this bit on the note book of people who are working on making clones and share. How far down do you think clothing our official zombies is?

Speaker 2:          01:29:06       All that shit shorty. They're first going to be looking at a lot of my teachers, especially my more poorly thought out ones, a lot of them require like some sort of a demise of civilization for them to be valid, and this is one of them. We would have to have some serious casualties. We'd have to devalue life in a way where like today, as as the answer that when people are against cloning the dangers of it and they're not a real person and the risks of playing God, it's like, well, no, there's zombies. We're only going to make them. We're not going to have them thinking and acting with just clonings all right, as long as we make him brain dead zombies essentially. Well, if we really just decided to start cloning people, that would be, that would be a huge issue. Could you imagine if people just decided they wanted to make more scrupulous pips?

Speaker 2:          01:29:52       Yeah. What if they got ahold of your DNA and it made a bunch of them and you didn't even realize that they did that until they were like 15 or 16 then you made them and you're an older man and you're meeting yourself at 15 there's like 20 of you and you're like, what the fuck? I'm not even responsible for my own self growing up and the come in there to to wipe you out and they're using your name or that can be out and you want to use Rogan's a ton of Giotto pops Cosby. Y'All look exactly like you all have your fingerprint. Is that what the Real Rick Ross Ross thing? It actually is. Is it a clone thing? No, they don't know where to like at all. The Real Rick Ross is actually quite lean. Cut Them. The fake Rick Ross is the one that's, if cloning came about and you had the choice of doing it yourself, would that be of any, why would I want to clone myself but I don't see how I'd benefit from that just made me, I don't get it.

Speaker 2:          01:30:39       If it's not about surely you'd have the rights to your own day. And I logically that be a key thing rather than me finding out, I'm bumping into scripts where it would have to be, I would have, you would find out that when you signed your terms of use, when you got your iPhone that you gave up your right to clone yourself and that they already knew. Yeah. So every time you like use your phone, a little bit of your DNA gets in you from your ear, wax gets into the speaker, then you turn them in and then it's make copies of you. That'd be some scam that to expose on CNN or something. If they're making iPhones that take an iPhone's then using those DNA collectors. Yeah, they're making copies of screws. Pep. Well, I think we're going to wonder at one point in time we're going to wonder what is it acceptable way to consider how to engineer, um, our civilization, both like as our society, like how we have, how we govern ourselves, how we have laws, how we distribute money. And then also like how we breed. Like there's gonna come a point in time when people become like super, super intelligent, far removed from this weird sort of ape like situation we find ourselves in today. And if they get to that 0.1 day they'd be like, look, how much should we be investing our intellectual time into actively breeding people the way we do every other animal that we have under our control. I mean the way we breed

Speaker 1:          01:32:00       cows, the way we breed dogs, the way should we just keep doing this whole thing on love or should we just love everybody and breed according to the best way possible to enhance the human race? Is that but surely that in turn just involve calming down breathing hugely. Because surely the biggest problem of the human race is that there's far too many of us to fit on this. That's true. Planet would that boiling pot of having far too many of us, it's like it sort of highlights the reason why that would be a terrible idea because there's so many variables that make society awesome and all of them come from completely different realities. Like the variable of the computer geek is a very different reality than the variable of a pro football player, which is, and all these variables like in biological variables too, like as far as like the way your body works, it might lead you in one direction or another, like relieved your desires.

Speaker 1:          01:32:55       And that's what makes this whole world so fucking cool and crazy in the first place. So could you imagine if we got so far advanced that we decided to start genetically engineer and go straight away rather than everything that can influence and, and yeah. And in doing so, we lost all art. Yeah. We lost all of it because it's not functional and well, because everybody's perfect. Everyone's perfect. No one has any emotions. Everyone's rational and logical. There's no more art. It's over. We're super advanced, no. On our and those strippers, this kid, well, we'd have robots copers and then we would slowly start to evolve and people enjoyed robot strippers and one, they invoice involved, uh, and enjoyed meditation classes, memory injection that they're not real. You just have like a Netflix of like memories. Like, oh, I just fuck that stripper. Well, I think there's definitely going to be a time where you're going to be able to download memories.

Speaker 1:          01:33:48       I think that's, I think that is without a doubt, what we're seeing with these Google glasses. What you're seeing is the beginning. Like you could take photos with Google glass, right? Yeah. You could look at things, you can take photos. Well, if you can look at things and take photos, what are you doing when you're taking a photo, you're capturing time, you're capturing a moment. It's just not the best version of it, but it's way better than a painting they use to capture type of thing that's here now and pulling it into. Exactly, exactly. But it's very two dimensional. It's right in front of you. Well, it'll eventually become three dimensional and then one day it'll be immersive. One day you'll be able to record and not just record a single image. Like we're, this is the baby steps. One day, you know, this is like when people started at first started figuring out if fire, you know, and that what that led to is the combustion engine.

Speaker 1:          01:34:31       I mean, think about that all the way up to plane travel. It was figuring out fire. All that other shit comes up after it. Yeah. Well we're seeing now by being able to take a photograph with the glasses. We're capturing time in a very rudimentary way, but really for us, amazing. Yeah. Well one day we're going to be able to capture everything about it. The way your seat feels, the way your hands are sweaty, the way your beard itches, the way your clothes fit. You're going to be in that life. So you'll be able to take someone's memory and just run an a whatever it is, you know, an hour program to our program. You know, people will be able to upload their sexual exploits. You mean that's going to be loaded?

Speaker 9:          01:35:09       Yeah. We should remove the point of need in a memory as such, because if you can just access it all in Armenia, it didn't kill our ability to actually remember stuff cause you don't need to ensure the same as how Google already and now there's so much that you don't need to learn or take in because you can really quickly see who was in that film and who and what else he was saying. There's that kind of instant things. So, yeah, absolutely. I think the first thing that's going to happen is there, there's going to be a search of your memory starting from a certain period of time where you're going to be able to access, uh, like what you had said in the past or did in the past. And it's going to be more searchable. Like to the point where I go, what did I say last night around 10 o'clock you said at 10 oh one blah, blah, blah, while standing at this location. And you know what I mean? Like it's right, right, right. Yeah. You're going to have Google for yourself and that's why you'll be able to ask it. Yeah. What you did and you'd be able to pull it up of ruin the fun of arguments though. Truly when you can accurately say, now here's what you actually said. This isn't rather than, no, no, no, no. I didn't say, I never said that. I meant what I said was this, Nah, let's, where are you on the next logical progression, right? Because it's Google's already, yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:36:16       Ruined the bullshitters argument when people bullshit about stuff. You Go, wait a minute, let me go over that. It's not true. Like how many of those conversations have happened since Google where those guys would have been insufferable. Fox forever

Speaker 9:          01:36:27       playlists. Weird. I've always enjoyed in, in, in football or soccer. Um, as, as you guys insist on calling it, um, we don't insist on calling it anything. We wish it would go away. Follow pop. These white people in America would stop attending. They like soccer to be, to appear more interesting. Hipsters fuck off. For years they were pushing for goal line technology and all this. Just see if it go will definitely happen. All right. The main guy in charge. He's argument for not having it was a one. The best things about this sport is arguing over that shit and I loved that as a kind of best. That's the best logical reason I've heard that it's better not knowing exactly like referees decision and then the next day you're like, that clearly went over the line. This is, Yup. That's great. That's part of sport that that's a big thing. I've been perfect.

Speaker 1:          01:37:12       And baseball, it's so boring. But they love to argue when someone safe or out and they'll fucking play that foot touching that bag a hundred times and the guy catching the ball and the foot touching the bag and he got, yeah, they'll play this shit over and over and over again. That's a terrible call by the referee.

Speaker 9:          01:37:26       I disagree from my point of view. I think it was the right call Nola. Geez. Just saying, no, here's the Ariosa. That's it. That was out. It's exactly, it takes all the fun out of it takes a little bit of the fun out of it. Especially goofy sports, goofy sports, you know? It's just like

Speaker 1:          01:37:41       it's a, it's a strange thing our obsession with, with the scoring, you know, I mean it's really kind of, we have a built in need for war and a built in need to conquer and built a need to form tribes to go on after other tribes. We figured out a way to do it peaceably your support. Yeah. You know, through organized high level athletic competitions. We have our team takes on your team and if we win we drank and we run to the streets. Woo Shit.

Speaker 9:          01:38:06       It's freaking has, is that an intentional thing in sports? Like I mean in MMA everyone talks about is the 10 point must system the right system during this an active thing of well yeah, cause everyone's having this discussion and talking about it and engage in about this fire rather than are, you know, it'd be best if we actually knew who won and who. The problem with that is sometimes the scoring system is so bad and so ineffective that it leaves everyone feeling like they got robbed. Yeah. And you see our thing is I think the scoring system works. It's just you need better understanding from the judges and from the, from all of that. I think again, almost any system, if it's clear enough and the people understand it, then I agree with you in some ways.

Speaker 1:          01:38:48       But I um, I also think that it's just not a comprehensive enough, um, system to have 10 points. Yeah. Because MMA is not one sport. See if it's boxing thing about boxing is did this guy uses hands better or did that guy use his hands better? Yeah, this guy did well then. Then he went and look, we got, he scored a hundred, you know, punches he five, you know them where this and 10 were that and 30 with any, you go over these, these statistics and it's kind of clear who one who got the round. It's not hard to pick her out. But when you start factoring in things like take downs and then things like leg kicks and things like submission attempts and you have a quantify what's more important, whether it's the strike or the takedown, what's more important? Is it more important this guy landed five punches or is more important than that guy took the other guy down and held onto him and did nothing and different people are gonna have different opinions.

Speaker 1:          01:39:38       It's very subjective. And when you're dealing with something like that 10 point system, one guy's going to get 10, one guy's going to get nine. Like it's very screwy. It's, you need more, you need, you need like a scoring for Graham grain. They're really Arasor scoring. Yeah. With the right across each one. Yeah. There should be like a score for everything that happens in the round and there should be like ten nine for each event. Like if they're standing up ten nine Jon Jones Co control the standup. But then John got it to the ground and it was ten six cause he almost submitted them, beat his shit out of them, control them. You know when it came to take down defense, you know this guy got the, you know, and you could have it like that and then count up the score.

Speaker 9:          01:40:19       But then that'd be tough to, if they're on the ground for a small amount of time. But that time they were on the ground. This guy schooled that guy right there. If they've got tens, six for that. But that was like, that was, well it depends on guns and they've got no, because if a guy goes to the ground and yeah,

Speaker 1:          01:40:36       only for a few seconds, it's not gonna mean anything, right. You have to have a submission attempt for it to mean something. So if the guy just went to the ground, they got back up, I'd probably be a nine nine if a guy takes you down and get back up and you get immediately back up, it may be not be even, but it's close to even.

Speaker 9:          01:40:54       I just think that if a judge is properly educated on it, then there'll be able to come close and take all that into account and know that that take down there were three takedowns but he didn't do anything while he was down or they got up straight away. And I think if, yeah, if there's a greater education on the, on the judges that be out of work, that system,

Speaker 1:          01:41:10       I wish I was English so I could say straight away and say it like normal and proper and that's a proper fight. Um, no, you're right. But I just think there's not enough variables. Um, or think there's too many variables rather and not enough accounting for those variables in the current scoring system. Why is it that they

Speaker 9:          01:41:32       bring hope, Dean and all these great Jew, uh, refs into each of these places yet? It tends to be the judges are more local thing and local or why couldn't they have the same lab with the judges are kind of elite. Here's the 10 best judges who are specialists in memory, not a box in one weekend and kickboxing or wrestling another weekend, only do MMA and therefore be more, well that's the local athletic

Speaker 1:          01:41:57       commissions have the say on who gets to referee, who gets the judge. And, uh, this, it's an issue that we deal with when we fight, when we have a events in certain places that don't have a lot of high level fights. So you'll have a local judges that were appointed by the commissions and they're on television and they're doing a terrible fucking job and they do things like, they get too involved there. They have two big egos, so they like get in the way of the action. They tell guys to fight and the guys are fighting. They become a distraction instead of enforcing the rules.

Speaker 9:          01:42:27       Seems to happen a lot less. Like it seems to be that bring, that would tend to choose the bigger of refs from big events for big events. It's critical.

Speaker 1:          01:42:36       If you have a big fight, you want an eve Levine, you want herb dean, you know, you want Josh Rosenthal before he went to jail. Yeah. He want big John McCarthy. You want somebody who's not going to fuck up. You know it's hard.

Speaker 9:          01:42:48       Correct. It is. His coats on the seminar on referee and then judging and I think he's just, yeah, Mark's crate. It's got such a good, similar to herb in the kind of the calmness in the cage of knowing that. Yeah, yeah. There's a lot of good guys now. Yeah. Yes. It's a hard gig. It's a very hard to dig them, right.

Speaker 1:          01:43:08       Difficult to make the right decision and you have to be on top of the action. Can't let someone get hurt, but you also can't stop a fight too soon. And do you have to be very knowledgeable. There's a lot going on there. You know, there's a, it's, it's a very, very stressful position that doesn't get a lot of reward. Like people don't appreciate when they're really good, but they get very upset if they're bad

Speaker 9:          01:43:28       and it's easy. It's an easy job for everyone that isn't doing it. It's easy to sit there and go, ah, there you go. Yes. Yes.

Speaker 1:          01:43:35       That's, that's, that's absolutely true. It's um, you know, but that's true with a lot of things, you know, watching it from the outside, it looks like it'd be easy, but doing that, it's way harder than what I do. What I do is tricky but it's not nearly as is hard as being a referee. I think that's way harder. Those guys, people get mad at them, man. They stop fights too soon to push them to get guys fucking scream at them, you know like and they have to be able to control shit too. You know like when when things are going down and you know if guys won't get off of each other and they won't stop hitting each other. That's why I get nervous when I see female referees and big men cheffing experience in the cage is key for a referee cause again always filled the people like the people that have actually fought or of train on, on judge or referee and surely that would benefit it will, you know when someone needs help or needs protected rather than yeah, I have it.

Speaker 1:          01:44:34       Having not experienced it and kind of being outside on it. I think that's a good point. Yeah. I think multi, most definitely having some high level training, most definitely understanding why when a guy's in a bad position, like on a guy's neck is about to get hurt when a guy's arms about the snap. You know, like when herb dean stopped the Tim Silvia versus um, Frank Mir, Frank Mir broke his arm and herb jumped in and stopped it. He heard the snap and he stepped in and Jen and stop the action. Didn't know or wouldn't, yeah, it wasn't tapping. Yeah, he wasn't tapping and he was still trying to keep fighting. He knew something wrong with his arm, but he didn't know exactly what it was. I mean, that's because her has grappled, he's fought MMA is very high level martial artist himself, so he knew there was a bad situation.

Speaker 1:          01:45:17       But like say if that was like someone who had never trained and maybe it was out of shape and just didn't recognize it, that guy's arm could've got fucked up really badly because if frank kept yanking on it and he would have kept yanking on it, it wasn't going to let that fucking thing go. And he could have torn through the scan. It could been a compound fracture, could have been really, really, really ugly. And uh, I guess it is a compound fracture when they both break. Yeah. But, but when they puncture through the skin, that's another level of severity because you have to worry about infections and it's like, it's super dangerous. And that could easily happen if you've got the wrong guy who's reffing a fight. Tough job. Very Leon Roberts is another UK guys. Very good. Yeah, he's great. He's excellent. There's a lot of good guys that are doing it now.

Speaker 1:          01:45:59       There's a lot of good guys. It's uh, um, there's a large group of people that sort of grew up being MMA fans and got involved in smaller shows and you know, became like a, a trusted referee. But you know, the gold standard. So he's like John McCarthy, Herb Dean, those goals. And Rosenthal was great too, man. Unfortunately we went to jail for that. We'd son slang that weed. I've been known as kind of phone. Yeah. Apparently had some, some peace stole lies she's not supposed to have, they had to penalize. It's not good. Roped. Have a good, yeah, it sucked because he's a cool dude. Yeah, he's a cool dude too. I mean, I hope when he gets out of jail they recognize it. It wasn't a violent crime and they reinstate him. But you know, dudes in jail for like over a year for weed. But you know, I don't know what you're, I guess it's like if you, if you're selling medical marijuana, it's legal statewide, but it's not legal federally.

Speaker 1:          01:46:57       So I dunno. I guess you could still get busted for it federally, but he wasn't even doing that was just slinging weed. There was no federal involves. There's like just getting paid selling plants, which I support 100% yeah, I'm tired. It's so stupid. It's is, it's unbelievably stupid that it's possible to lock someone in a cage for selling plants in 2010 it's dumb as fuck. I don't care if it's written on a piece of paper, it's dumb as fuck. Suddenly people who want the implants and they want to know, should he have guns on them know, probably shouldn't have illegal guns on them. That. I agree that Pos harder to argue Jack Census. I'm not arguing that

Speaker 9:          01:47:36       the gun was not so much, but yeah, no, I get that. It's crazy.

Speaker 1:          01:47:40       Yeah. It's just so sad and one day they're going to look back and they're gonna, they're gonna realize how unbelievably stupid we were when it came to our drug policies. Yeah, unbelievably stupid. Like we took the most beneficial, the least harmful ones and we made them the most illegal and put people in jail for the longest amount of time.

Speaker 9:          01:47:58       For those, it's the perception of it is as far as, remember when I was younger and I was smoking a little weed and doing a lot of of acid and and shit like that. I read in good times, good times and read in Timothy Leary's thing of of when he was saying how the way society looks at drugs is legal or not legal when it like his argument was it should be treated like a car that you have to buy. If you want to buy a seat, you pass a test, you get your license, you basically prove that you're intelligent and of sound mind enough to enjoy this and then you go and buy it. No, like not because because the one drug we've got an alcohol, it's just you pay money and that's that. Right? Anyone can have it. It's kind of, yeah. I love that. The first time I read that, the small mindedness of the way we approach it when there's millions of ways to approach the legalization of every drug.

Speaker 1:          01:48:49       Well, it's also very strange when we arbitrarily decide that one drug, regardless of its impact on people's health and wellbeing and crimes committed under the influence of it, which is like one of the most devastating ones, alcohol and we make that our primary drug and we just decide and one sad drug. I'm behind that one. If you get to do that, if you, you're dealing with a sophisticated intelligent civilization like the UK, like the United States of America, like the Western world in the year 2014 you're dealing with people that have just previously impossible levels of access to information. It's unparalleled. Access to information is never in human history and yet in the face of this, in the face of this overwhelming evidence, you're choosing to put people in cages for, for plants like that. That's it's,

Speaker 3:          01:49:48       it's, it's, it's, it's an intolerable because we've known it for so long that it's just, except for with the same as we were saying earlier with religion of how ludicrous it is, but because it's been there for so long, it's accepted. It's exactly the same with that. It's, I think it's changing. Think dripping down and start it again if that, if that didn't happen in some politician came in and said, what are going to do is we're going to put humans in cages and people look our mental, that didn't already exist, so that was a new thing. They'd be like, fuck. Are you talking about about you putting people in cages for plants that guys, yeah, he's violated drug policy number six five two nine zero. He has more than one gram of marijuana on him for personal consumption. Get of that fucking cage.

Speaker 1:          01:50:31       Yeah. It's crazy. Just change it in Brooklyn. Didn't they just make Brooklyn make weed legal in Brooklyn? Uh, medical I think. Yes. I think New York, so man, a medical in New York, but I think they made edibles legal. Really? Where in New York? In New York, edibles are legal in New York. Marijuana in New York. Hmm. Hmm. That's nice. I like hearing that Shit.

Speaker 3:          01:50:56       Florida was the opposite that everyone told me like, well, you know, it's so bad. If they find a seed in your car, they will get you the other fuck

Speaker 1:          01:51:04       would you in Florida dude, they only want cocaine. Yeah, totally. Yeah. It's a medical marijuana state as of July 5th of 2014 so you can get medical weed in New York. Good. Jesus Christ. How is this 2014 it's happened. Especially the medical, which is by the way a Trojan horse, but especially the medical because the medical is, it's, you can't argue against it. People have inter-ocular pressure from Glaucoma cures him. It helps relieve pain. It helps, uh, regain the appetite of people that are suffering from aids and on Chemo therapy. It's like there's so many benefits. It's impossible to argue medically.

Speaker 3:          01:51:44       And how long did you think it will be before it just spreads over the country? Because it seems that it works. Everywhere is gone, right? It's worked and it's good for the economy and the best shit

Speaker 1:          01:51:54       is when we get the people in Iowa high. That's what that's going to make the world a way better place. All those tents, dudes are out there. Deer hunting, get those guys. I, everybody needs to just, just get it. It's a perspective enhancing moment. That's what's going on here folks. It does do, I mean that everybody needs to get high. No, I don't really mean that. Everyone needs to get high. You don't have, you're a happy person the way you are. Keep on keeping on, so on. But the idea that people can't benefit from something that people have Colin really benefited from, not just benefited from have, but have stated over and over again that they benefited from it. You don't hear that about a lot of other drugs. This is a great drug, you know, and there's a lot, I mean, I benefit from several different drugs, but like caffeine, I benefit from caffeine. You know, we don't like to think of it as a drug, but that's a drug. It's an absolute drug. And I, and I like it. I love coffee. Marijuana is a very beneficial drug. There's a lot of great aspects to it. Can it be abused? Of course everything can be abused. Every single thing. Food can be abused,

Speaker 9:          01:52:56       but as grownups it should be a choice that you can make. Right? It's just about being disciplined. Growing up. I mean, I'll stop smoking or stop. I haven't had any marijuana in like over 10 years now, but it just wasn't, it. It wasn't working out for me personally. But that doesn't mean again, it's not, I'm still very pro as as as I think everyone should try or it, it's positive to try all these things and

Speaker 1:          01:53:20       the idea that everyone is going to respond exactly the same way that any given substance, whether it's aspirin or marijuana, I mean there's a reason why some people are allergic to some things and other people in jail like shrimp. Some people eat shrimp and they'll get sick as fuck. I love shrimp. It's delicious. My head to make it illegal. I mean there's a good percentage of the population that's allergic to shellfish. It's a fairly common allergy. And if they had chosen the same sort of ideas that they have on like marijuana addiction, this is one that they love to throw around. Marijuana addiction. Yeah. I would like to put marijuana addiction next to shellfish allergy and see which one is more common. Yeah, cause I bet shellfish allergy is way more fucking common than marijuana. And so the idea of making it illegal because one tiny percentage of the population gets physically addicted to it. Well I don't know what's going on in their body. They might be physically addicted, but for me, I know I can stop and not have weed for weeks and I don't feel any physical pain. Nothing crazy. I've taken two weeks off and had nothing, not felt a thing. Not not an urge, not just living life. There's no want this no itch that you can't scratch. Yeah. It's weird that we have these arbitrary decisions that get made a long time ago and that they stick just because someone wrote him somewhere. We're so goofy,

Speaker 9:          01:54:47       addictive personalities I guess or or, or physical addiction, but people will have that for anything.

Speaker 1:          01:54:53       Did you see the New York Times said that, you know, they did a New York Times editorial saying that marijuana should be decriminalized nationwide and the government had a response. The New York Times that was so goofy and it included all this shit about children, about the effecting the brains of children are like no one saying give pot the fucking children. Did you even listen? They didn't even read the editorial, the editorials about adults informed adults should be allowed to smoke marijuana and the government's thing, like their response is all about kids. It's like you goofy fake babysitters. You don't give a fuck like kids. You guys aren't in the hood. You guys out in the hood saving babies. Fuck off. Fuck off. You're not, you're not looking after kids is not hurting kids. Stop it. No one's saying kids should go get high. Jesus Christ. It's ridiculous. Goofy fucks. But that's the kind of people that are responsible. That's the kind of people that are responsible for our laws are who's saving the kids from shellfish? Who's, who's, who's out there fighting that battle? They try to say peanuts are a big one, man. Yeah. Nuts. Free schools like the schools. My God, my daughter goes to my daughter goes to a nut free school. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          01:56:01       Why did they still have nuts on airplanes like I, they still do it. Why wouldn't they just switched to cheezits or something? Like why is it nuts? Anyway, screw question. Is it something with nuts and flying? There's tons of things like that though. Like the realization making me want nuts common. But [inaudible] was talking about how out how come when epilepsy came about or we didn't go. All right. All right. We don't need strobe lights then on. And this is how that could kill you. Send her into a fit. Let's get rid of them. That's fine. We don't need, they're not, unless it's like, no, we need, we need to party my friend, just strobe light. This is his wife would black out. She would see like one of those videos online. Ah, just put them somewhere else.

Speaker 1:          01:56:40       I thought he was fucking around. You remember that Guy Jim from the message board? Yeah. He um, he put some, uh, some warning up like saying like, Hey, you guys take down these fucking strobes. And then of course everybody changed their Avatar to a strobe. Like fuck off. Maybe just shut off avatars instead of killing the party is if you like, you know, didn't know that you're going to see something. And if you saw it, it was black you out. You'd have to be like really careful about your viewing habits, you know. There we go. Don't do that. I'm not. People die. You shouldn't do that. That's rude as fuck. That's going to bring the aliens back. If you do that, they're gonna come back and land it's sea sick. Secret signal here. There was some radio signals they just found in the galaxy recently. Fascinating new radio signals found in the galaxy and people were speculating as to whether or not it's a aliens.

Speaker 4:          01:57:37       What does it sound like? Does it sound like static or is it,

Speaker 1:          01:57:40       I don't think it's like a sound. I think it's like a signal. Radio waves emitted from nearby galaxy. Wow. Yeah. That's interesting. Shit man. July 10th mysterious signal from a galaxy far, far away. Brief pulse detected by the Arecibo telescope appears to come from far beyond our galaxy. Could be caused by evaporating black holes or mergers of neutron stars or

Speaker 4:          01:58:05       aliens. Could be aliens. Could it be aliens? Yes. There's a chance they could be trying to reach us. It could be a chance. Did you see that video that somebody shared it to me on Twitter where they can take sound waves off video of like a plant and like map it out and it will recreate what the sound was when that video was recorded. Yeah, well they can use a Doritos bag. Yeah. Doritos bag. You see saw that video. That was nuts. Incredible. So if

Speaker 1:          01:58:35       you're in a room and say like you're talking and you have like a Doritos bag, they're like a light piece of paper, they can focus on that. And the s the impact of your voice on that Doritos bag. They can detect what you were saying. They can detect the sounds. What? Yeah. See if I can find that video that was, that is the mind blower of the week's mind. Blowers. What are we getting excited about cameras earlier and let's fucking insight how much smarter or those people than me. There's so much smarter. Like that's not even a human like anybody can figure that out. Like wouldn't. When I think about my potential for figuring things out and their potential for figuring things out, like you know the tools that they have, the the, the, the steps that they are head. I could live a hundred lives and never even catch up to where they never even get close. It's amazing. Like when people want to pretend that all people are created equal, why don't you pay attention? There's some mother fuckers out there that are getting sound off Doritos bags and guess what? Fuck face. They're smarter than you. They're just, their brains work better. Here we go. The results of this video or the best experience through heads,

Speaker 10:         01:59:43       when sound hits an object, it causes that object to vibrate. The motion of this vibration creates this subtle visual signal that's usually invisible to the naked eye. In our work, we show how using only a video of the object and as suitable processing algorithm, we can extract these minute vibrations and partially recover the sounds that produced them letting us turn everyday visible objects, individual microphones. It's crazy. Fuck the silent high speed video shown here. On the left we see the leaves of a potted plant shown on the right video was recorded while in nearby loudspeaker, played the notes to Mary had a little lamb. Oh my God. So now what they're gonna do, they record it with the sound and they're going to play it back using, even when we played the video in slow motion here, the vibrations caused by the music are so subtle that they moved the plant's leaves by less than a hundredth of a pixel making the plant appears still to the naked eye, but by combining and filtering all of the tiny motion happening across the image that you see, we are able to recover this sound.

Speaker 11:         02:00:54       Oh my God. Seven in the future where we're going be able to take a little video and find out what we're really talking about where JFK or something, oh my God. Oh my God.

Speaker 10:         02:01:09       Six we five human speech from high speed video of a bag of chips lying on the ground, but to make things a little more challenging this time we put the camera outside behind a soundproof window. This is what a cell phone was able to record from inside next to the bag of chips.

Speaker 1:          02:01:28       Okay.

Speaker 12:         02:01:31       Fleece was white as snow and everywhere. That very well that lamb would,

Speaker 10:         02:01:39       and this is what

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       we were able to recover from high speed video filmed from outside behind soundproof glass

Speaker 4:          02:01:56       that's haunting. Oh my gosh, that's amazing. So what that's going to happen is we're going to be able to take old home movies, especially like the eight millimeter kind. That's like no sound that used to have in the 70s we're going to be able to eventually probably take that and actually recreate the sound of everything that was going on. How can those be part? As long as they have the real nub number. This on the film at the same resolution as, as an example, they're going to show it now at a very lower resolution at this part of the video and that this is early on. So I think in the future they're going to be able to get it to the point of being able to do that because here's what they can do with just a typical camera. Uh, right. Like a to a laptop. Yeah. Yeah. So here I'll show

Speaker 10:         02:02:38       which can record thousands of in most consumer cameras. Here we go. We can sometimes actually recover sound at frequencies several times higher than the frame rate of our video letting us recover audio from video captured on regular consumer cameras. Here we see a 60 frames per second video of a bag of candy capturing a regular consumer Dslr. While our Mary had a little lamb music played through a nearby loudspeaker.

Speaker 1:          02:03:04       [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:03:08       and 60 frames is like half the speed that the iPhone can do. Okay.

Speaker 1:          02:03:14       That's fucking saying

Speaker 13:         02:03:17       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          02:03:18       this is so strange.

Speaker 10:         02:03:20       By using a variation of our technique on the rows of the recorded video, we were able to recover this audio, which includes frequencies more than five times higher than the frame rate of our camera.

Speaker 14:         02:03:31       [inaudible].

Speaker 4:          02:03:37       So yeah. Wow. Expect new, crazy ghosts in the future from the past

Speaker 1:          02:03:43       weird, weird world we live in. Man. What a weird world that someone can figure that out.

Speaker 4:          02:03:52       That's bothersome of control if you get out in the first place is just insane. Just the actual thing of having the idea and perception of thinking of that is just,

Speaker 1:          02:04:02       yeah, yeah. That's a real game changer, right? Yeah. Wow. So humbling. Yeah. You know, it's like I really feel when I see something like that that we're in, we're very fortunate in the time that we live that we're going to get to see these things. Yeah. There were a part of this insane moment in history where things are becoming so complicated, so quickly, so powerful, so quickly. The, the impact of them, the impact of people's words, just, it's never been a time like this.

Speaker 4:          02:04:34       What's the speed of it all is insane. Like the speed that

Speaker 9:          02:04:38       the chain or the or the speed. We went from the invention of the Internet, which is putting everyone in the world in touch with everyone else and then the speed went from that to turn it into something that we just look at tips on and tweet people and talk shit coming the the speed, which we've just become comfortable with this amazing piece of technology that we should be using to find out amazing things constantly. But 90% of the time we've got so comfortable with it because it's just on your phone now. It's not, it's not this, this great jump in technology that well we take it for granted.

Speaker 1:          02:05:09       It's doing its work. Yeah. And it's doing its work and its work is connecting. All of us connecting all of a sudden mean we're connected in some really bizarre ways now, man, that's a, I mean what we're seeing on the screen, we're watching this video that's a fascinating new thing and an amazing new thing, but it's probably one of like a million new things that are coming out that are going to freak us the fuck out. You know, all this stuff is essentially magic. It's crazy

Speaker 9:          02:05:35       how the F or freak us out for like a minute

Speaker 4:          02:05:38       and then be [inaudible] and then it's just fine. It's going to be an accurate thing. Yeah, sure. It'll be an APP on your phone and two years it's creating time traveled by using it like weird like old VCR type kind of technology where we're going to be recreating everything that's ever happened. Yes. So crazy on tree DNA or something.

Speaker 1:          02:05:57       So weird man. Yeah. You're gonna be able to like watch an outdoor video and watch, look, stare at the trees, listen to the actual voices that the people were saying while there were near those trees. Well not only that, the probably be able to like do things digitally to change the resolution of things. I feel like probably some sort of an algorithm where they'll like be able to analyze each individual pixel on Hanse in post the, the camera's reaction to the image and change it and enhance it and recreate reality based on some sort of an understanding of the surroundings.

Speaker 9:          02:06:30       I love the idea that this technology could come about though, but tha tha tha tha tha foible of it would be they have to be near a plant or a diary

Speaker 4:          02:06:38       package. Sometimes we've had these great moments in history, but it wasn't next to a plant walk. We'll never know what, where would that, where would we, where would a safe place be? Would it be underwater or would it know? Well, would it that'd be worse.

Speaker 1:          02:06:56       Imagine if they figured out a way to watch,

Speaker 9:          02:06:58       oh, well I say around at three a packets from now on. I don't want to,

Speaker 4:          02:07:03       can somebody top smell shit, shit. Stay away from Doritos. I shouldn't

Speaker 1:          02:07:08       say figure out a way to recreate old historical videos and actually make them like a part of the oculus rift. Make them like super high resolution. Calculate them based on all that. Like say if they took the Kennedy assassination and they calculated it on all known photographs of the area, they did a very comprehensive analysis. They, they in detail, every photo of Kennedy's face ever taken. Every photo of Jackie o ever taken every inch of one of those crazy limousines that Kennedy was driving in the convertible limousines, every inch of it. And then they put you in a virtual reality where you're at the scene and you've got to watch the Zapruder film play out. Yeah. Like right there, like you're there, you're looking at Zapruder holding the camera and you know, you could move around on, I mean,

Speaker 9:          02:07:57       miss sounds like this whore ripper, you know, like, because the sounds from reflections of like, yeah, they'll figure out a way to,

Speaker 1:          02:08:07       yeah. You wonder if you'll ever be able to accurately like replay the voices.

Speaker 15:         02:08:13       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:08:15       Huh. But recreations of historical events in three dimension in virtual reality is inevitable. Like, I mean, if people are making paintings of Nixon, they're definitely going to make like a virtual reality scenario where he gets shot at the theater. Yeah. You get to see John Wilkes booth sneak up behind him and shoot him. They're going to have that pace note. Yeah. Yeah. Historical events. Any known historical events, you know,

Speaker 9:          02:08:38       I'm writing as a story or song or whatever at the moment. About a guy that gets a chance to meet some kind of God or whatever, but gets told you can have one truth and you've got to pick everything for our history. Like you could pick like to know what happened with JFK or to know if Jesus was real or wherever. And just what, what would that one, I mean in this story he ends up going through all of that and then asking if his girlfriend cheated on him because that's the reality doesn't match the reality. That's the truth that you'd ask and need to know. But what, what the fuck would you, it's weird cause JFK is one that always come to it. I'm the American, I've got no, I think it's just cause it's such a conspiracy. The want to know the actual truth can amazing.

Speaker 1:          02:09:22       I think the, the, the actual truth would be interesting, but I'm pretty convinced of a conspiracy when it came to JFK. I've, I've seen the evidence that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. And one of the things that I don't find compelling is that there was obviously some, the Warren Commission had a predetermined, predetermined conclusion that they wanted to reach. And that was that there was a lone gunman and they wanted to reach it so badly that they ignored evidence to the contrary and even concocted crazy stories like the magic bullet theory. Yeah. Yeah. They only did that because they had to account for a bullet that hit a underpass and ricocheted. So they had an account. They had to make all these wounds come out of one bullet cause they know there's only three shots from Gospel. The only reason why they did it is to wrap up there.

Speaker 1:          02:10:06       It wasn't like a scientific analysis, like they looked at it all. It was done by Orrin Hatch, who's, uh, he's, uh, was it Orrin Hatch? I think it was single bullet theory. I want to say it was him. It was one of those fucking Weirdos from, um, the, um, [inaudible] remember when I'm Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas? And there was a, do you know who Anita Hill isn't Claire's tank? Clarence Thomas Supreme Justice who uh, when they were trying to appoint him, there was this crazy story that came out. Like he, uh, told this woman Anita Hill, that's really sexy black check. He told her that, uh, there's a pubic hair and her coke.

Speaker 2:          02:10:46       I remember that. Do you ever find a coke, like the sales went up during that time or was it like Pepsi sales? I bet that'd be fascinating. I wonder. Right. Pubic hair makes me want to buy Pepsi. Arlen Specter. Sorry. That's who he was. It wasn't Orrin Hatch was Arland spectrum, but I think a Orrin hatch was involved in as well, but aren't Arlen Specter was just like this known creeper. He's just a, he was just one of those guys that had been around. He was a Democrat, switched to Republican, then switched back to Democrat and he's just a shift. He fucking character. And he was the one who came up with a single bullet theory. He was the guy who was his idea. How would you say one bullet just went fucking nutty. It's crazy that they would even consider triage is shit law that on something. That's clearly the biggest case. Gentlemen, good to be the most scrutinized thing, but I think some of the eight 20 in saying that it's stupid that they can be equally as saying that they would think, yeah, all that that we'll do, we'll tell the people that, but it did work.

Speaker 1:          02:11:48       I mean there's people that are arguing today, so they were right. Like if, whether or not they were right or not, I'm not sure, but they were right that people would accept the fact that this one bullet doesn't enough image to put that there. I mean, it's so preposterous in so many different ways and I have conversations with people, but you can't deny the actual bullets dimensions itself. The bullet itself was in pristine condition of we've, you know, people hate this conversation because it's been done so many times before, but there's also fragments of it that it was left in the body. The body is of Connelly, especially where they weren't accounted for. They weren't missing for the bullet. They found the Gurney. That wasn't a bullet that did all that just wasn't, it's not a bullet that shattered bone. It just wasn't fucked up enough.

Speaker 1:          02:12:26       It just doesn't make any sense much more likely since it was found on the Gurney at the hospital. It's somebody placed it there and to pretend that people wouldn't place it. There is preposterous. The find a pristine bullet on a Gurney on governor colleagues journaly Gurney in the hospital. Do you assume that someone place it or do you assume that this is a bullet that went through to people and just happened to wind up on a Gurney? Either one of those is true or either one of those as possible rather, you know th th the the say that you absolutely know that that's the single bullet and this is the reason why I know it's, it easily could be placed there and if it was placed there, your whole theory of one bullet doing that, then we have no bullet. Like what's, where's the bullet that did all this and what does it look like now?

Speaker 1:          02:13:08       Well it looks one, sometimes you don't know. So because he like finding the bullet was the only reason why people were willing to believe that one bullet did all this damage. So they ha, which is really ridiculous because you would think that would be contrary because like this is a bullet that was like shot into a swimming pool or something. It doesn't look fucked up at all. Yeah. I don't know, man. That the, the either or thing is a problem as well. Everybody wants to say Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. No, he did. And it was a conspiracy. Could be Lee Harvey Oswald was a part of the conspiracy. Yeah, that's possible too. Yeah, they could've, he could've been there. Patsy, like he said, I was a Patsy, but he also could have been involved in it, which would account for the, the slang of the officer, like a police officer was shot and they attributed that to Lee Harvey Oswald.

Speaker 1:          02:13:51       He might've shot a cop because he was a guilty fuck. You know, he might've been in volume, might've been one of the gunmen. They might've been several gunman and they might've just had that guy like set up as a patsy from the jump because he had a wife that was Russian and he was from Russia. Either way that killed Kennedy, I wouldn't, I wouldn't go back to see that. I'll go back to go to Roswell. Yeah, I'd want to see if for a Ufo crashed or it was just a fucking air balloon, but the hot air balloon surely would. That one feels to me like it would if, if it could potentially have the most disappointing outcome. Yes. I'm looking forward to this and then go, ah, fuck. It wasn't an air balloon. I want my to confirm my suspicions and my suspicions are like, this is my suspicions when it comes to [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          02:14:39       This is the big one. I think that people are full of shit. I think that there's enough full of shit people to count for some really good stories about Ufos. Yeah. Has anybody ever experienced an actual Ufo from another planet? It is absolutely possible. That's not what I'm saying. I'm not discounting. If you're the one person out there that actually has a real unique experience with a Ufo and you're not crazy, I'm not discounting you, but what I'm saying is when I look at all the evidence with the Roswell and all these different stories and all these different crash stories, so people are so full of shit that it's much more likely knowing the small number of these things that actually get reported you. When people say thousands of sightings every year, there's 350 million people in this country. If you only get thousands of sightings every year, what are the odds of those people being crackpots?

Speaker 1:          02:15:26       100% yeah, it might be 100% it was not a hundred it's 99.999999 crazy. It never happens to a really regular [inaudible] and we can't, we, we must account for the number of crazy people that we have that we've, we've counted. There's a lot of them. So if people are just having these episodes where they start telling you about UFO abductions and seeing ships that are invisible and move faster than time. Like it's also possible, they're crazy and full of shit like that. So I would love to go back and if I went back to Roswell and I found an actual Ufo fucking change my tune. But if I went back to Roswell and I would just saw a bunch of people standing around a weather balloon, it's, it's good that you are one is isn't going back to, it's kind of about to, to disprove something rather than witness. This is, this is what happened. It's like, no this didn't happen. Fuck that shit. I absolutely bullshit you come come up with any of this anymore. Well I think I would like to be open minded. Like we'll look, no one would like it more

Speaker 2:          02:16:30       than me. If I went back and I actually saw spaceships from another planet. Like, if you could go to area 51 and they could take you to the Bob Blazar place where they have this fucking gigantic hangar and you go inside and you see it, that actual alien Ufo. Holy Shit, I would love that. But it's way more likely to me that you get there and you see a bunch of remote control shit that the government's been working on and you see like some, you know aircraft technology that led to the stealth bomber, which they know they built out of there. That's more likely with the UFO is our, yeah, that makes more sense. Although little is back engineering alien technology. Oh I don't see a lot of evidence of that. That seems, that seems like you discounting human ingenuity, which is obviously fucking amazing. Like look at this sound thing.

Speaker 2:          02:17:17       Exactly. Yeah. We are looking at already it's that back engineered from aliens who want to see what we're saying. Yes. Distance. So I think you, you're dealing with a lot of Dell minded people that can't even comprehend the intelligence level of the people that can conceive something like a stealth bomber. So they're seeing this, these, this technology arising there, back engineered. They're attributing it to back engineering ufs when it really could just be people that are so smart, so much smarter than them. They're not even the same species. Yeah. Essentially. Yeah. And they're just super fucking smart and they figured out a gang of shit. Yeah. That's way more likely right. Lately. So the, the, the, the people who work for the government that have made it are aliens essentially, in a way that much further advanced than right. US. That's that stats. The proof of aliens and Steven, tell me he's on nailing that.

Speaker 2:          02:18:12       There is an alien. What's, what is he? He's a computer voice, right? Yeah. And he is a, is a brain that's connected very loosely biologically to some movements that control computer. It's essentially a brain directly interfacing with a computer through fingers book alien. He's a classic guy. Helium right there. Any warns us about aliens is warning us about him. He's covering his own tracks so much harder. The plain sight right in front of us. Pretended he can't move and waiting and then he'll open up like the thing. It'd be a fucking mouth and chopped down in someone's head, but in a sense petrifying in a sense. He's an alien in that he's so, he's like, he is something that we can't even imagine. We can't even imagine what's going on in inside of his mind. He is so goddamn smart. He's so advanced that his concepts and his, the levels that he's operating on thinking on, might as well be alien to some guy who works at Krispy Kreme and keeps fucking up and doesn't figure out which button to press. You know? Shouldn't say Krispy Kreme. Wonderful establishment makes fine. Dawn's, what's the deal with that line for that though? So they're delicious. There's like 30 car deep in Burbank. Every time I drive by I'm like one day I like to try it. It's not because they suck. We usually do the Burbank one is the shit dude cause it's 24

Speaker 1:          02:19:28       hours a day you need to do is come home from a comedy club some night. I've done that for coming home from the Ice House. Stop off, get some Krispy Kreme. Got Hello.

Speaker 4:          02:19:36       It's like one in the morning and there's a line of 30 people gluten free.

Speaker 1:          02:19:39       No God, no gluten free. Now you're getting full sugar. It's going to go right to your arteries. You're going to feel like shit for hours after you eat it. But for the mouth pleasure that you get for those that minute or so. Are you eating one of those? It's worth with those hours, easily a pussy. You know,

Speaker 4:          02:19:57       what do you think is going on with this Ferguson thing? Cause I'm looking at it now, like they just arrested the huff pro reporters, the arresting reporters. They're going into the Mcdonald's and going, everyone needs to leave like employees. Why we're gonna Arrest, you know who to fall is Westley low rate is w. E. S. L. E. Y. L. O. W. E. R. Y. He writes for, I think the Washington Post is formally of the Boston Globe and the La Times Huffington

Speaker 1:          02:20:25       post reporter arrested in Ferguson. Yeah. It's uh, it says Ryan J. Ryan. Oh Ryan J. Riley Rather. This is fucking crazy. Why Ryan J. Riley and the Washington Post is Wesley Lowery were arrested Wednesday while covering the protests in Ferguson, Missouri surrounding the death of an unarmed African American teenager, Michael Brown, who was shot to death by police by a police officer last week. Riley tweeted that around 8:00 PM the Swat officers invaded the McDonald's at which he was working requested information after he took a photo of them. Lowery was also working at the fast food restaurant. Whoa. Wait a minute. How are Huffington post reporters arrested? Oh, huffpost caused the Ferguson Baba Baba status of Riley after tweets that he had been arrested. The person who picked up the phone identified himself. As George said, he couldn't give any information at this time. So who got arrested?

Speaker 4:          02:21:24       Infused repair for the West?

Speaker 1:          02:21:27       Yes, I'm a Los Angeles Times reporter. Matt Pearce talked to the police department

Speaker 4:          02:21:33       and this guy used to work for the Boston Globe and looks, offers slurs slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused at which door they were asking me to walk out. And he's, this is a reporter that was waiting to be taken away. Large black man screaming for help in the back of police truck. Whoa. I'm dying. I'm dying. Please call the, he screamed.

Speaker 1:          02:21:52       Yeah. I'm still trying to figure out which huffing

Speaker 4:          02:21:55       posts guy find got arrested. Also Ryan really of huff pro assaulted. Interested.

Speaker 1:          02:22:01       Wow. So those guys, so who, why does it say that there? Oh, I get it. I'm sorry. They were working on their laptops at Mcdonald's. That's not right. A working for McDonald's. Right. Oh Wow. So they came in while they were working and they ask for their ID and when they took a photo, Holy Shit. Like that's like beyond overstepping bounds. There was also a video that someone put up online of some people filming cops and the cop point to gun arm and tells him to get the fuck out of here. And they all start screaming. It's really crazy shit at the cops says get the fuck out of here. And he points the gun at them. You know, it's, it's some dark shit man.

Speaker 1:          02:22:44       It's, this is all what everyone was terrified of when that um, that operation, um, or that a occupy Wall Street shit was going on. What they were worried most does that at one point in time, the United States, there's going to have something, something that just wakes people up to shit like this and they actually start writing. You know. And that's a terrifying thing for, for police. It's a terrifying thing for law enforcement for before you know, any form of government. When you have this, this happen, these things, these types of things, they build momentum. It gets, it gets real scary when people feel like the police is doing them wrong and people, they have a, there's a battle between people in the police and they start shooting rubber bullets had crowds like they're doing here. They're just hitting random people in the crowds trying to disperse them.

Speaker 1:          02:23:36       You can't do that, man. This is, this is dangerous shit. This is how people get overthrown was a pitcher from it. You know the Shah of Iran got overthrown. One of the, one of the reasons why they, they rose up against him is because he was starting to say that they were going to attack people if they were in any sort of formation for more than two or three people were together and they formed any sort of a group, they're going to arrest them all, shoot him onsite next day. There's like 2 million. We have a breaking point. Yeah. As things have gone right. We can't, yeah. Yeah. We'll, we'll just tough because there's always going to be a load of smaller breaking points along the way that don't cause the chain but change but calls a lot of bad, bad. Yeah. This is crazy and actions crazy that they feel like that they can just arrest people that are in Mcdonald's.

Speaker 1:          02:24:26       Like are you protecting or serving when you're doing that? Which one? Yeah. What are you doing? Guys are in Mcdonald's. There were reporters and you're allowed to just come in and disturb them because you think the what? They took a photo of some crazy shit that's going down. You don't want to being released is this protocol, are you following like this is like a, is this in your book of what you're supposed to do? They were arrested for not packing their bags quick enough. Wow. Solaris. They can just decide to come into McDonald's and kicked everybody else out. Meanwhile, the streets are flooded with people. That's so strange. Why would they kick everyone out of Mcdonald's anyway? Yeah. Is that, I don't know. Mcdonald's is property. I think when, when shit hits the fan, when you have a situation like this and people from the police and civilians are fighting, it's like things get real hairy and there's a lot of like huge, huge, huge mistakes that get made and there's a lot stress and a lot of pressure and it's going to be real tough to calm fucking thing down

Speaker 3:          02:25:24       and it just spread so much more now because of Twitter and because of everything else it becomes this. Everyone knows about it, which yeah, as far as it all out more. Right. Most of the time you live in England, right? Yeah. And in England the cops don't have guns right now. So is there ever any, this kind of riding still has been yet there's um, a break. You put a regular police don't have guns, but there are oversee like different units or higher up things where it can be the case in, yeah. Yeah. There has been, it was a couple of years ago, there was a big one where a kid was show because they fought, he was now armed. Armed police had been called out for an incident and the guard wasn't armed and it caused a riots for days and days. Kind of in London, but similar type of situation.

Speaker 3:          02:26:15       It's just not as regular and not as as far railroad because yet it's not any policeman, the policeman in Mcdonald's or wherever else, not everyone has go. Yeah. Is weaponized. That's a weird thing. How does the police deal? Like how often is violent crime with guns take place? How often does that in England, it's not that regularly. Is there is that again as everywhere there are guns, there are knives like there is crime going on, but yeah, it's no where near as as regular thing [inaudible] even proportionately, obviously there's millions and millions more people in the u s but still say percentage wise it's far more regular. Yeah. And every now and then there's like some sort of a, like that Lee Marie situation where they had that crazy bank robbery. Yeah. That, that was fucking nuts, man. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Full armor on and masks and you know, Ski Matt Ski Goggles on and Shit.

Speaker 3:          02:27:13       You couldn't see their faces. And it's weird because stuff, right? That wasn't that, that you thought that wasn't that big a news story coming. It was, it wasn't, no, it was the biggest bank robbery in all of England. Right? Again, yeah. But it wasn't, it, it wasn't as again lies because as the riots over a kid getting shot or just, I don't know, bank robberies aren't as hot. It's a favor these days. Are they? I don't know. It's weird. I think it's way harder to rob a bank. I don't, I don't think that happens all that often. And the Lee Marie one was one of the biggest ones ever. Yeah. I mean him and his alleged compadres, I mean they heisted some insane amount of money. Right. It was a hundreds of millions of dollars. Crazy amounts. Yeah. That guys are crazy story, Huh? Yeah. How much of a folk hero is he in England? No, genuinely not that much joy. Again, I heard about it more because of, of I heard about that whole story more because of who he is and because of his father in Everett because of mixed martial arts. Yeah. Hm. So the other people that were involved, how I became aware of it and again, I can't say, I guess other people may have been more aware for some reason, but yeah, that's the main, that's how I heard about the story more because of MMA.

Speaker 1:          02:28:22       Yeah. He doesn't even seem like a real person, like guy who fought as a high level. I'm a May fighter got stabbed like seven times and then one being involved, one of the biggest bank robberies, every second stories. And he goes away to Morocco and he's in prison and Morocco and just run and shit over there. He's living over there for a while and then eventually got arrested. And where's he down in jail. Is he in jail? The UK? I think so. Wow. He's a, he's got a crazy life man. Someone's going to take that guy's life and turn it into like the most insane Guy Ritchie movie ever. You know, like it's just him narrating it. It's going to eat

Speaker 9:          02:28:55       w w I want him to Ryan because it's all just there. It's just literally tell you yes

Speaker 1:          02:29:00       stories. England has a lot of violence. We'll Bullock fisticuffs. Yeah, that's, that's something that I've found like shocking when I was there. How often you see guys duking it out in the street?

Speaker 9:          02:29:10       It's a weird one. I'm a, I'm a, I'm a Millwall fan, which is a football team over there and we're known for having a lot of hooligans and violence of writing and they're known as the worst of the lot coming. But again, it's, so my opinion is that's not exclusive to football really in the UK, if you're on an generally on a Saturday night, if you're in a busy town center, you can see a front if someone, so it's gonna cause we drink so heavily,

Speaker 1:          02:29:40       Doug's then hope a great bit about Helen England to just fight about everything. Where are you from over here? Fuck over there.

Speaker 9:          02:29:47       That's exactly right.

Speaker 1:          02:29:50       It is. It's just such a strange thing. Do you think, I wonder if, how much of that is related to the fact that, I mean his direct descendants, when you're in Europe, there's no clean break. It's not like your family comes over to a new continent, forms a, you know, a new civilization and starts fresh. No, you're essentially riding on the momentum of King George. You know, it's like the same, you know, like the society has moved and progressed

Speaker 9:          02:30:15       tiny little island. But we've got this and you used to be a massive empire. Yeah. You know, affect things, right. Our whole history is running so much of the world. And then we're on this tiny little island still claiming that we're the mighty England, but we just scrapping in the streets amongst ourselves.

Speaker 1:          02:30:36       Isn't it weird how civilizations do that? Like the culture is like rise and fall, rise and fall and their influence and their power. You know, Rome go to Rome, man, shit there. Nothing's going on. I go buy a pizza. I mean, what are you going to get when you go to Rome? You're not gonna see any just giant armies. They had any,

Speaker 9:          02:30:53       it's the weird delusional in Britain. I have a history and an arrogance in a way. 90% of the stuff that we got that was good was from the Romans. The Romans came and showed us and the reason a lot of our society crumbled after the Romans left was because we had all these amazing roads and everything, but we didn't know how to rebuild them all to maintain them or anything like that. So we kind of had this big boom when the Romans came over and then plummeted for ages because we're like, oh shit,

Speaker 2:          02:31:20       we've got all this technology and what not and we don't really know how to fix that. Some other guys made it and then they went broken it to go home cause they got overthrown and we were there like, ah, fuck. And then years later he was then turned into accurate history and our great advances in technology and

Speaker 1:          02:31:36       yeah, it comes in waves, right? Yeah. Like guys figured it out and then something happens. Then the new people have to reinvent and yeah, that's a, it's just such a fascinating thing. It's such a fascinating thing when you go to Europe and you see how old everything is. Yeah. It really puts into perspective because, uh, when I was a kid, I lived in Boston and uh, there was a cemetery, uh, near, uh, the Commons and uh, it's like one of the oldest cemeteries in the country and you like see like a headstone from like the 17 hundreds or 1600. So that's a big deal. But in comparison to the European history, like they have that big, big white horse that's on the side of a hill.

Speaker 2:          02:32:16       Yeah, yeah, yeah. And nobody fucking knows where it came from. Nobody has a god car wash, stuff like that. And just things like stone Henge and all that kind of just, it's just crazy how old that, and again, really it's not that impressive. It's a load of slabs. It's some shit, but it's the fact that this is, yeah, so old. Thousands of years ago as well and no, Whoa, whoa. Yeah. They like to bait the purpose of like they find roads, these crazy stone roads and like, okay, what the fuck? What's going on here? No one knows. Everyone forgot. It's all just gone. Whole civilization comes and goes and it's a beautiful thing though, man. It's, it's an amazing thing to discover the remnants of the past and try to piece together what happened and then really try to put it into perspective what has happened that brought us to 2014 all the different lives that had to be lived, all the events that had to take place.

Speaker 2:          02:33:04       And all the different things that we're trying to still piece together today and try to figure out, well what, what was going on? What did they believe on, why would they worshiping cows and where were they doing on top of this hill and what was this, why they set this up to align it with constellations? Like what was their belief system? They wrote like this, what the fuck they got these little squiggly lines. What are they saying? Crazy to think of the level of intelligence that was around before the breakthrough was made to record that and to document that. So just so much stuff. Just amazing shit that probably they all knew what these stones before everyone knew what the fuck it was full, but that wasn't, that wasn't written down anywhere. We're not going to forget that we come home. We spend so much time building this as Donald's.

Speaker 2:          02:33:47       Everyone knows what the stones or the WHO does this tone and everybody knows what's done in just for, yeah. I wonder when the first guy started writing shit down, everybody else was like probably like, what the fuck are you doing? He's like, I wrote a language like I'm not learning your shit. I got my own language, my language is involved. Just circle solve a big circles and little circle. Big circles or means I'm really mad. Little circles mean them happy. Okay. Big Circle. A little circle. You had to get a bunch of people to agree like you had to get a bunch of scholars, many generations. How many generations is the tech to figure that out imaginable and then someone's like, I'm going to write it on our cylinder and I'm going to roll it on clay. Do you get to know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          02:34:24       Like what I'm, how fucked up is it that I, when I then go and find another society that got at completely different, no correlation at all. So not only have you got to figure out this completely new way of communicating, you've got to then interpret their way into yours. It's too crazy. Just the idea. Oh, how much, how Craig look when, when you think about like Columbus in 1492 sailing off, finding the Americas landing here, seeing the native people, trying to communicate with them. Like what that must have been like not even knowing where the fuck you landed. You get there and you see some people and they're all brown and Shit and they got feathers in their head and like what is going on? Cause they, how do I tell this guy that I'm from Spain? Like what do I, you know what, what?

Speaker 2:          02:35:13       What is he saying? Like you had to decipher a language that no one even knew existed and there's a gang of them. You got the Lakota people who speak one way. You get the Cherokee that speak another way. You get the Apache that have their own way. Yeah. Pool. That's the only 200 years ago, you know, 400 500 years or whatever it was from 1492 to 2012 I mean think about like when they came here, the, the amount of time between 1492 the less than 600 years, 500 plus years to today. That's nothing in terms of the world. Nothing. But in that time, this one spot with a bunch of people on horses just hanging out, just erupted, became a New York City, San Francisco, California. Last time I was here, I can't remember what it was, but someone was telling me how long ago it was. The La was part of Mexico. 18 hundreds it's not. Yes. Yeah. Not that ago one. Okay. When was la? Mexico? I say it was, I say 1800. That really could be wrong. I could be remembering it wrong. But Brian, you, Dayton a Mexican. I was at a Mexican last night, but if you do you to ask, have you had a guess? When was la? Mexico 1821 [inaudible] 27.

Speaker 16:         02:36:31       Okay. When was la? Mexico. Hmm? When did la belonged to Mexico. Okay. When did did,

Speaker 2:          02:36:44       it's the anticipation now and now it's building. I'm saying more recently than that. You saying, I don't know. I don't want to, uh, 1769. Oh, really? 1769. Thanks. So hold on a second. European exportation period from 1542 to 76, nine, seven. Oh, no, no, no. I'm [inaudible], um, Mexican beer at 1821 1848. The United States State Hood, dude, that she continues to the present day. 1821 I guessed it. Date. Yeah. That's amazing. You probably, do you think maybe you had that in your head

Speaker 1:          02:37:16       as you knew

Speaker 4:          02:37:16       I got a little Mexican juice on me. Maybe.

Speaker 1:          02:37:21       Do you think that maybe you saw that? So it's a crazy number 1821. It is a real, incredibly specific, yeah, it's really specific, but you got it. But it's also, I've seen those tee shirts. That's one thing to take into consideration. They have a t shirt that says 1881 to 2014 be a lot of people where it's, you know, I was like, there's birth tee shirt. I've seen him like different years.

Speaker 4:          02:37:43       One day. I have no idea. I've never of that

Speaker 1:          02:37:45       good memory though. Whatever it is. You're right.

Speaker 4:          02:37:47       Actually, I didn't even know that Mexican and the United States was in the same

Speaker 1:          02:37:50       different tribes of native native Americans have lived in the area that is now California for an estimated 13 to 15,000 years. Holy Shit, man. Holy Shit. Wow. During the pre European, uh, period, there was only a between a hundred and 300,000 native Americans living in California. Wow. There's no one here is crazy. Just empty. Isn't that weird? 300,000 is not answer those questions when he's saying it's probably an amazing, I mean, look, it's probably a hard life even back then, but how amazing must've been to be on horseback and shit. 300,000 people here. Well, actually pre European. The problem with that is pre European. Um, I don't think they were on horses at all. The, the horses came from the Europeans, I'm pretty sure. Yeah. They're riding horses. Like that was one of the things like where Cortez showed up and Montezuma's people like what the fuck these guys are gods because they were on horses that they were parked. Yeah, yeah. Of, of, of the hosts. Yeah. Fascinating shit man. 1821 that is not that long ago. Less than 200 years ago. This was Mexico. And wonder why Mexicans get mad. That shit's really recent. It's last life if you don't have that many generations either. No, not at all. That's not that many at all. This like great, great grandparents. I can almost remember that shit. Yeah. Wow.

Speaker 4:          02:39:18       I think I saw somewhere the other day that Columbus, Ohio now has a bigger population of Mexicans than white people, I think is what, I'll double check on that, but Columbus, Ohio, and we just, I remember when I lived there just some 10 or 11 years ago, it was like I saw, I remember seeing the first Mexican. I remember like, what's that? You know, and my mom's like, that's a Mexican.

Speaker 1:          02:39:39       Everyday I'm hustling everyday. I'm hustling. They figured out a way to just fucking hustles. They've got all the way up to Columbus, like these fucking chubby white people aren't working. Let's go take their jobs, kick some ass, take some names. I'll take five jobs, please. We're all living in a one bedroom apartment, saving money, boom. Next thing you know, they're opening up a taco joint. Best Tacos in Columbus. Dude's not even legal. And it's like, it's fine if there's two taco places in town and one of them was a dude that's not even legal. I'm going to that guy's place. Yeah. He's bringing over goats and shit service. Some nasty, vicious Jalapenos. That one place man in

Speaker 2:          02:40:14       La Jolla across the street from the condo. What's that place called? Shade asked me too fast. Deep Bob's Burrito, Don's Don, whatever it is. It's so close to Mexico. It's just the most authentic, the most ridiculously good burrito's you'll ever have in your life by design. And it's in San Diego, so it's like real close to the actual Mexico. You can't play Don Lucas, Don Lucas, you can't play when you're in San Diego. You can't have some shitty Mexican food. Mexico's right. They're literally on the doorstep. Yeah. It's a weird moment, man. When you have um, you know, this incredible community like La Jolla and on this uh, like really rich area. Yeah. Beautiful, beautiful era. And then

Speaker 9:          02:40:58       20 minute drive, Tijuana,

Speaker 2:          02:41:01       20 minute drive, like a complete different country, you know, wrecked with poverty, drug violence, crazy.

Speaker 9:          02:41:07       Turn it around Europe are realizing how many countries you can cover in a few hours drive. I mean, that's insane that you're driving through Germany to France, to Holland, to Italy. All of these, uh, uh, uh, uh, within a day kind of thing is, but you're in a completely different country and culture, language, everything.

Speaker 2:          02:41:29       Yeah. I, you guys can go to France and Germany and Hungary. Like how many different places can you leave in England and get two in one day

Speaker 9:          02:41:39       and sign them out and sign it if you literally drive in through or drive. Yeah. This, so many. And they all say how many of them speak different languages? All of them.

Speaker 2:          02:41:49       All of them. It's crazy. They're like across the board from each other and completely different languages. But most of them speak English as well. Yeah. Yeah. When you get respect, when you're doing gigs, do you do gigs in all these countries and do English gigs?

Speaker 9:          02:42:02       Yeah. Wow. That's crazy. It was, it was crazy because obviously it's quite a lyric based. We assumed when we first started going out there that that, that they wouldn't really get that side of it. But it's crazy how in Europe, a lot of people seem to get it more because they read the translations of it and a paying attention, more of, you know, it means, so if you're hearing it and you speak English, you're going to miss tons of it, but you're just, you're picking up enough. Whereas, cause they're not picking up any other than go and read the a word for word and understand it far more than half of the British people who come to our shows and stuff like that. That's kind of cool because it's all fast. So if you're like, oh, this is my language, then you won't get, there's tons of hip hop songs. I don't know half of it, but I've listened to it a million times and you just, yeah,

Speaker 2:          02:42:49       yeah. Like doing that as an APP, releasing it as an APP and having all your lyrics.

Speaker 9:          02:42:55       Well, the lyrics on there now, that could be good that way. I mean, I've always been adamant of putting it in, in the booklet and shit like that. I've always been adamant on the packaging, always having or being good. I like physical stuff. Obviously I'm adapting to the digital stuff, but I like to put out a nice f f a physical product as well with all the lyrics in, and then I kind of sit there, we'll kind of snotty on online when people ask me the lyrics, it's like, Whoa, you'd bought the CD then? Yeah. Just going to buy the album. You'll find the APP. Yeah. It's like, do you get upset with people? Bootlegger shit, I get upset that there's no shame over it. And that kills me now that people openly just tweet, you're going, yeah, I stole that. It's like, cool, I understand that that happens, but don't come to my face and told me that cause these are released most of it on my own label now and stuff like that. It's just like, you're not ripping anyone off other than me. Um, yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:43:47       But do you feel like, um, there's a balance with people finding out about your stuff because someone will take it and download it and then they'll, they'll distribute it and then other people find out about them, more people come to your shows?

Speaker 9:          02:43:59       I think we completely is. I think, um, yeah, it's, it's all a kind of is, it's all interwoven. But I think people often argue are so I stole your music but I paid to come to see you live. It's like, yeah, not performed live for you. Right, right. That's what you were paying for this gentlemen. That doesn't say that. That doesn't cover the receiving almost this, it's like if you're going to do it yet, it might find, you might hear some and have some new listeners cause he told somebody but don't go to your, like you say, go to your face and it's such, I find it's such a weird argument the saying, um, saying I stole this bar, I paid for this. When you're the, you're paying for has its own value anyway. It's like saying I'm not going to pay you at work this week, but I paid you for the last three weeks so, so we're cool.

Speaker 9:          02:44:44       So no, we're not cool. This is for this, this word. Right, right, right, right, right. No, I do a lot to try and cause make it engaging and my people want to pay on my solo album. I released a fake tolerant that was all this, oh, the instrument or was, but me just talking and just chatting and doing kind of a DVD extras kind of, oh, the drummer on this track was with Travis Barker and shit and shit like that. And going through stuff just so that the Torah, and that was first out. Then everyone grabbed, it wasn't at the hour, but then it also kind of not in a preachy way, kind of said, if you're stealing it, you're stealing it from, from me, from the artists that you're into and support in this light. So yeah. And that kind of works. A lot of people say, ah Shit, I got caught. I got caught on the fake terror. And that's interesting that, you know, I try a lot to try and be, yeah, try and make things interesting in that way. Because again, if people are gonna steal, they're going to steal. But we get an awful lot of people who say, I've not paid for an hour, been in ages, but I paid for your album because of, yeah. The way it's all coming from a personal perspective. Right. Because it's

Speaker 1:          02:45:48       someone directly you release it. Yeah. Yeah. That's kind of, you know, there's, there's a lot of things that people don't want to pay for online. Yeah. You know, and once they start being able to get things for free, they don't, they don't want to pay for them.

Speaker 9:          02:46:00       It's finding the balance and, and the sweet spot, I've just released my spoken word show, Edinburgh fringe, so it's kind of spoken word, but then have some stand in there as well kind of thing.

Speaker 3:          02:46:10       And it stunned me that the comedy world, Louie and yourself and everyone had found that thing of putting out for $5 and being direct to the customer for $5 is enough for you to not want to go on a torrent site and hunted down. It seems to be that sweet spot that people will be happy to pay. Yet the music industry hasn't done that. It's a, for my shower, I've done that and released it in that way. And again, it seems to be working. People are kind of I that people like you, they'll buy it and if they wouldn't buy it, they would probably never going to buy it anyway. And if they download it, you'll get more people downloading it. So I don't know how many people have illegally downloaded my shit, but a lot of people have bought it, so it's, I think it all worked out.

Speaker 3:          02:46:54       I just think it works out spreads the word, but it again, again, it's not, I'm completely, I finding that's the way things go long. I started off, I think you've got to do a certain amount of free stuff. I think that's totally key. You need to be giving away stuff for free and engage in and building that crowd so that hopefully when you do have stuff for sale, yeah, people will pay well. I think that definitely makes it a better, better relationship than if everything you do is just for sale. Yeah. You know, I think when you give people stuff for free, I mean certainly like a podcast. Have you ever thought about doing something like a podcast? I'm tempted. I've, I've, I've had a ride Ayrshire in the, in the UK for the last, uh, year and a half. I've just stopped that now for a bit of a break, but I'm considering going the podcast route instead.

Speaker 3:          02:47:39       Yeah, why not? I mean, when you have a radio show, the thing about it is you're always going to be working for somebody. You're always going to be uploading something if someone else's servers and they have to decide whether or not unscrupulous is getting crazy. This motherfucker saying some shit that I don't agree with. We're going to have to remove them from [inaudible]. Exactly. That kind of just being your own boss on that is. Yeah. And much like you do with your spoken word stuff, you're the creator of this stuff. You know, you'd be the creator of your own podcast too. Yeah, I think I've completely forgot that I had, and refinish thing I mentioned is six filters on my website, but if you went to the codeword Rogan is $5 at the moment. So you know, I've, I've, I've, I've, I've seen your adverts and know it works.

Speaker 3:          02:48:20       I know how to when people open, so scrupulous pip.co. Dot. UK. Oh, there you go. Dot. Broken UK. Yeah. Okay, cool. Awesome man. I forgot about that. I saw at that four came in. What are you doing over in America right now I'm, I'm working on a new solo album, so I'm working on that with a Travis Barker again at that Ilona from nine inch nails. Don't wait for those with Eddie Bravo. Yeah, Eddie was over last night. He's Travis seems like a cool guy. I've never met him, but we've gone back and forth online. I've communicated with the season. The last time I was over here and again, he's fucking, he's huge. He doesn't need to give anyone would be nice. Yeah. I came over and he was just, he gave us about two hours in his studio of just him playing dramas and for the record was like a dream, a dream anymore and just to just,

Speaker 9:          02:49:08       we chatted online and he played on a track I've done previously, but it was all over emails and just the most accommodating and nice go on. It's like, well, you don't have to be this guy. You could be a complete Dick. He Kit. But he's, yeah, just played for hours and literally as soon as I left, I had a message from him saying, you need anymore. Just let me know if you know, if you're in town. Oh cool. Great.

Speaker 2:          02:49:28       Yeah. That's amazing. Yeah, he's about as big as it gets it. It comes to drummers. Yeah. Does that guy have any room for tattoos or is he just like completely filled up? He still seems to be having them all the time, but [inaudible] tattoos. Yeah. Yeah. He's got no room, man. It's a, I liked that too though. He does a lot of martial arts training too. Does is a place, yeah. A place near here that he, we started talking was, was

Speaker 9:          02:49:51       us talking about a UFC events and epics and that, that's kind of how we got to get to know each other, so, yeah.

Speaker 2:          02:49:57       Yeah. He loves it. I'm just saying he's a big MMA fan and he's always tweeting about and stuff. That's cool, man. So listen, we're, we're out of time.
