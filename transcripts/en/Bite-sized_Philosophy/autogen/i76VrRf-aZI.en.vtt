You know louis c.k a while back talked about Tiger Woods, which and I really liked it because people were complaining about Tiger Woods

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:14.340
in his affairs yeah, and also about our Arnold Schwarzenegger and his affairs and and

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:20.219
One of the things that Louie CK pointed out...quite in a very comical manner was that

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.070
well

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.489
Many men aren't having the affairs of Tiger Woods

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.419
But that's not because they're good men. It's because they don't have I think he said a busload of

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.339
Swedish Swedish bikini models waiting for them at the final hole

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.329
So the idea would be that you should conduct yourself so that you are attractive to

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:50.099
Many women maybe that you have your pick of them, but then you should pick one

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:58.319
And that's a sacrifice obviously. That's a sacrifice of a sort. It's it's a strange sacrifice because you know I

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:05.999
to someone a comedian recently who told me of one of his experiences in Las Vegas, so he went to Las Vegas with a

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.710
sports

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:10.710
superstar and

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.509
They went to a party and what literally happened at the party was one woman

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.320
brought forward a small group of other women all very attractive and basically told

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.189
The sports legend that he could just pick one of them

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.629
And she would go home with him right and so that had all been arranged beforehand, and he said that he's been in many

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.409
Situations where something like that has happened, and I thought

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.159
Well, you know that sort of is appealing to the Hugh Hefner

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.639
playboy 14 year old fantasy that sort of gripped our culture from the 1960s onward but

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.930
imagine that you sleep

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.790
casually with a hundred women in

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.689
In a six month period or a three month period for that matter or a three week period I don't care...pick your timeframe

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:56.909
And you say well

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.209
what what and you're you're you're

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:06.180
ecstatic with yourself because you've been validated by this opportunity, and I'm not

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:13.169
Making light of that. It's not nothing to be attractive to women like that. It's really something to be attractive to women

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.199
But it isn't obvious to me that

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.729
Your choice to conduct yourself in that manner

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.820
Enriches your life and the life of other people

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:32.429
More in any way than picking one person and actually having a relationship with them. It's only true that that

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.100
promiscuous pathway, let's say

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:41.790
Is better if you can actually divorce sexuality from all the other elements of life say well, it's about variety

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.849
And it's about impulsive pleasure. Or, maybe it could be even slightly deeper than merely impulsive pleasure

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.749
It could be shared impulsive pleasure, but I don't think you can do that because sexuality isn't divorceable from

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.419
Family and from morality and from all the other elements of your life, and if you're mature

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.149
You know that and so you make a decision you make of a decision not to

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.470
capitalize on your opportunity, not to misuse your opportunities

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:17.970
And you know, a huge part of the #MeToo phenomena the huge part of this battle that's being played out in our culture is a

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.839
consequence of the failure of men to recognize that -- now it's not only the failure of men

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.360
let me be absolutely clear about that because for example with the, um,

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.800
example of the sports superstar the women who are lining up in front of him parading themselves and offering themselves are deeply

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.680
complicit in, in this pathological game, and so it's pretty clear anthropologically as well that, you know

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.869
Sexual choice tends towards a Pareto distribution especially for men so most men have very little

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.809
selection at their disposal disposal and a small number of men have

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.899
excess opportunities...the question is what should that small number of men do? And you might say

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.040
capitalize on it and to hell with the consequences and like

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.548
It's a powerful argument, but I do believe it's wrong, it destabilizes the society and so

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:22.500
and I also don't think it does your soul any good because the problem with treating other people as casual sexual partners

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.649
let's say, is that you also treat yourself that way simultaneously, and I don't think that that does you any good, because you're not...

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.710
...unless that's what you want to be if you want to be a casual partner. It's like well

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.989
That's I wouldn't say that's a particularly noble ambition. You should be able to do better than that
