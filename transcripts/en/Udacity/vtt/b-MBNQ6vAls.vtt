Thanks, Susan. So, tolerance means that more of a drug is needed to produce the

00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:09.810
original effects. So, for example, a person might take meth, and on subsequent

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.586
occasions have to take a higher dose to produce the same feelings they did the

00:00:13.586 --> 00:00:19.332
first time they used it. This is also true for alcohol. One glass of wine after

00:00:19.332 --> 00:00:24.245
repeated use will not produce the same effects, so a person has to drink more.

00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:29.705
Tolerance is the body's way of trying to adjust to the constant presence of the

00:00:29.705 --> 00:00:31.459
drug.
