00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.582
Well the answer is that there will be greatest

00:00:01.582 --> 00:00:05.495
down here. Way down here, we’re feeling

00:00:05.495 --> 00:00:09.024
the wait of all the air above us. Up here,

00:00:09.024 --> 00:00:11.458
well, I didn’t even try it. But up here, we’re

00:00:11.458 --> 00:00:13.276
getting close to outer space. There’s almost

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:16.081
no air above me to feel any weight from.

00:00:16.081 --> 00:00:18.252
And down here, we’re somewhere in the

00:00:18.252 --> 00:00:20.145
middle. We are feeling the weight of the air

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:21.977
above us, but it’s not as much as we’d feel

00:00:21.977 --> 00:00:25.160
down here. Maybe this is about 10,000

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:28.477
meter square, jetliners would fly.
