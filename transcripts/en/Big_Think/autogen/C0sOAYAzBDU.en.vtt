philosophically resolved my

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949
philosophically resolved my
 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.859
philosophically resolved my
philosophical quest which is what had

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869
philosophical quest which is what had
 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.860
philosophical quest which is what had
been on and really presented the answer

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870

so there the concept of selflessness or

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059
so there the concept of selflessness or
 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.110
so there the concept of selflessness or
emptiness is the one that I would say

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120
emptiness is the one that I would say
 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.299
emptiness is the one that I would say
made me feel most released and wonderful

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309
made me feel most released and wonderful
 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.750
