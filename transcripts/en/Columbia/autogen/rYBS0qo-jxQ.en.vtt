that period and they then work on and
they produce students and I think that

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170
they produce students and I think that
 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.740
they produce students and I think that
there are great failing still of

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750

Ukrainian historiography from all the
 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.780
Ukrainian historiography from all the

this period if they didn't know Latin
 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.240
this period if they didn't know Latin
and other such problems so it is limited

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250
and other such problems so it is limited
 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.830

and then of course Ukraine is
 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.219
and then of course Ukraine is
economically collapsing so not only is

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229
economically collapsing so not only is
 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.630
