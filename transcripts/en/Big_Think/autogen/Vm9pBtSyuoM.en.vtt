heritage well I think that my first

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090
heritage well I think that my first
 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.200
heritage well I think that my first
contact was even not so much with China

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210
contact was even not so much with China
 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.140
contact was even not so much with China
but more with Hong Kong because my

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150
but more with Hong Kong because my
 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.719
but more with Hong Kong because my
father's family were based there we

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729
father's family were based there we
 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090
father's family were based there we
would spend a lot of time in hong kong

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100
would spend a lot of time in hong kong
 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.730
would spend a lot of time in hong kong
at least visiting our families and

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740
at least visiting our families and
 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.240
at least visiting our families and
relatively and relatives there and so I

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250
relatively and relatives there and so I
 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.910
relatively and relatives there and so I
think that Hong Kong in many ways is a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920
think that Hong Kong in many ways is a
 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.170
think that Hong Kong in many ways is a
what you might call a China in diaspora

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180
what you might call a China in diaspora
 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.899
what you might call a China in diaspora
so it's China but it's also a little bit

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909
so it's China but it's also a little bit
 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:31.640
so it's China but it's also a little bit
different because it has an experienced

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650
different because it has an experienced
 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:36.410
different because it has an experienced
the same kinds of things that mainland

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
the same kinds of things that mainland
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.960
the same kinds of things that mainland
China that have defined modern mainland

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970
China that have defined modern mainland
 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.910
China that have defined modern mainland
China such as the Cultural Revolution I

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920
China such as the Cultural Revolution I
 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.969
China such as the Cultural Revolution I
think that my upbringing was unusual in

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979
think that my upbringing was unusual in
 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.859
think that my upbringing was unusual in
that like most children of that time and

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:47.869
that like most children of that time and
 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.109
that like most children of that time and
certainly in Australia I think that what

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119
certainly in Australia I think that what
 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.999
certainly in Australia I think that what
had happened was that my father very

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009
had happened was that my father very
 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:54.440
had happened was that my father very
much wanted his children to be

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450
much wanted his children to be
 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.870
much wanted his children to be
Australian and so I think my mother

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880
Australian and so I think my mother
 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.060
Australian and so I think my mother
really wanted us to be Chinese in

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070
really wanted us to be Chinese in
 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.889
really wanted us to be Chinese in
influencing my father really wanted us

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899
influencing my father really wanted us
 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.429
influencing my father really wanted us
to be Australian so I come from very

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439
to be Australian so I come from very
 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:11.000
to be Australian so I come from very
much a kind of biracial household

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010
 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:14.610
my first visit to China was in 1992 with

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620
my first visit to China was in 1992 with
 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.180
my first visit to China was in 1992 with
my father he he wanted to take me to

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190
my father he he wanted to take me to
 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.880
my father he he wanted to take me to
China to show me the Three Gorges he was

China to show me the Three Gorges he was
 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.770
China to show me the Three Gorges he was
convinced that the three gorges dam

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
convinced that the three gorges dam
 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.120
convinced that the three gorges dam
would have a substantial impact on the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130
would have a substantial impact on the
 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.220
would have a substantial impact on the
surrounding cities and things like that

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230
surrounding cities and things like that
 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.620
surrounding cities and things like that

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630
so he wanted to show his children that
 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.390
so he wanted to show his children that

impressed with the work and also
impressed with the circumstance the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310
impressed with the circumstance the
 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.200
impressed with the circumstance the
their ability to produce works to create

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210
their ability to produce works to create
 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.810
their ability to produce works to create
things in what was an extremely

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820
things in what was an extremely
 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.420
things in what was an extremely
difficult environment at that time and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430
difficult environment at that time and
 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.820
difficult environment at that time and
this was post daily 9 the Tiananmen

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830

incident and so things were pretty

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360
incident and so things were pretty
 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.200
incident and so things were pretty
stripped then I think that from very

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210
stripped then I think that from very
 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:01.560
stripped then I think that from very
early childhood my I had always shown an

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570
early childhood my I had always shown an
 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.060

history and when I was going through
 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.020
history and when I was going through
University at that time in Australia

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030
University at that time in Australia
 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.440
University at that time in Australia
Austria was really undergoing a an

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450
Austria was really undergoing a an
 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.610
Austria was really undergoing a an
enormous kind of readjust mental

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620
enormous kind of readjust mental
 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.560
enormous kind of readjust mental
realignment where those those powers

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570
realignment where those those powers
 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.710
realignment where those those powers
that be in politics and in the financial

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720
that be in politics and in the financial
 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.260

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:36.120
fields really wanted to see Australia
realign itself to the asia-pacific

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130
realign itself to the asia-pacific
 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.199

region realizing that the US and
European markets primarily were becoming

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080
European markets primarily were becoming
 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.570
European markets primarily were becoming
harder for Australia to engage with and

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:45.580
harder for Australia to engage with and
 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.530
harder for Australia to engage with and
