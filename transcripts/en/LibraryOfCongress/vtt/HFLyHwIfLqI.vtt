&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: All right.

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.310
Good afternoon.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.910
My name is Fred Bowen
and I am the author

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:13.170
of 23 kids' sports books
for kids ages seven to 12.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.220
And I also write a
weekly kids' sports column

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.280
for the Kids' Post page
of the Washington Post,

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.520
which is a charter sponsor of
the National Book Festival.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.140
Before I introduce
our next speaker,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.530
first we should have a word
of thanks for the cochairman

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.610
of the festival,
David Rubenstein,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.800
and the other generous sponsors
who made this event possible.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.630
If you'd like to add
your financial support

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.470
to the National Book Festival,
a way to do it is in the program

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:50.520
at the back, and it would
certainly be a great way

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.320
to support things.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.660
By the way, after our next
author's presentation,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.800
there will be questions
and answers,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.080
and if you would please step
up to mics that you see there.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.970
So, it is now my great pleasure
to introduce Suzanne Slade.

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.280
Suzanne Slade is an
award-winning author

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.210
of more than a hundred books.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.690
I thought I was doing great with
23; she has more than a hundred.

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.080
Most of the books are about
science, and that's probably

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.510
because Suzanne was
a mechanical engineer

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.720
who actually worked on rockets.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.080
Her latest book is
called Countdown:

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:38.780
2979 Days to the Moon,
and it is the story

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.880
of the US Space Program from the
President Kennedy announcement

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.910
that we were going
to go to the Moon

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:47.350
until we stepped onto the Moon.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.890
It is a fabulous book.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.190
I have seen it.

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.400
She will be signing the book
at 4:30 after this at booth 20.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.900
It has already gotten starred
reviews from Publishers Weekly,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.840
from Booklist, but most

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.460
of Suzanne's books
get starred reviews.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.620
She is a wonderful author.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.540
And so, without further
ado, let's have a big round

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.510
of applause for Suzanne Slade.

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.570
[ Applause ]

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.870
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade:
Thank you, Fred.

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.170
&gt;&gt; Fred Bowen: Knock 'em dead.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.470
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: Thank you.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.820
Well, thank you very much.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.240
I'm so excited to be at
the National Book Festival

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.350
to celebrate reading and books.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.940
And, of course, my book
Countdown, which is illustrated

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.100
by New York Times bestselling
illustrator Thomas Gonzalez.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:43.740
Now, this book covers
2979 incredible days

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.810
from when Kennedy announced we
should land a man on the Moon

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.770
by the end of this decade, which
you'll hear in his own words.

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.960
&gt;&gt; I believe [inaudible].

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.260
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade:
He's saying that.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.660
He's saying, "We'll land
a man on this Moon --

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.170
&gt;&gt; Of landing a man on the Moon

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.900
and returning him
safely to the Earth.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.200
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: Excellent.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.000
Until Neil Armstrong's
first step on the Moon.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:12.960
&gt;&gt; I believe --

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.260
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: Oh.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.620
There we go.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.160
So, what I wanted
to do with this book

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.280
with Apollo was I wanted to
share not only the successes

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.180
of those early missions but
also a lot of the struggles

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.720
and the surprises that happened
in those early Apollo missions

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.350
that not many people are
aware of, because they led

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.910
to the most historic - one
of the most historic events

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.750
in history, the first
Moon-landing.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.980
&gt;&gt; Two, one, zero.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.510
Liftoff. We have a liftoff.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.510
[ Inaudible ]

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.040
[ Music ]

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.720
&gt;&gt; It seemed that the whole
world had stopped as man had set

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:00.530
out on the adventure to
escape from his own planet

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.470
and to set foot on
a distant one.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:09.080
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: So,
just a little background.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.500
As Fred said, I'm a
mechanical engineer.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.850
And I worked at McDonnell
Douglas Space Systems

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.440
in California.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.300
And some of the spacecraft
I worked on were the Titan

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.370
and Delta rockets and the
Delta-Star spacecraft.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.130
So, I do have a big personal
interest in space travel.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.750
So, I thought it
would be fun today

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.050
to do something a
little interactive,

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:36.880
that I could give
you an Apollo quiz,

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.970
which will help you
test your knowledge

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.900
of these early Apollo missions
that led to the big landing.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.680
And also you can
learn something new.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:46.990
So, are you ready for the quiz?

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.450
All right.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.150
Question one.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:59.810
The very first Apollo mission,
Apollo 1, was: a huge success,

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.590
a national disaster,
or delayed for years?

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.890
What do you think?

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:08.740
I've got a gentleman here,
what do you think, sir?

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.640
He thinks it was a huge success!

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:16.910
But unfortunately, it was
in fact a national disaster

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.650
that almost ended the
entire Apollo Program.

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.070
That very first mission, just
a few weeks before they were

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:28.560
to launch in January of
'67, there was a fire

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.580
on the launchpad while they
were doing routine testing.

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.310
They weren't even
trying to launch.

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:40.210
And that fire killed all three
of the Apollo 1 astronauts.

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:43.560
And at that time, after that
disaster, the nation started

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.480
to think, "Do we really want
to try to go to the Moon?"

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.080
And, no one was sure if the
Apollo mission would continue.

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:54.440
But they decided it would.

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.500
So, NASA grounded
Apollo 2 and 3,

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.830
because those spacecraft
were the same

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:01.130
as the one that burned up.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.550
So, they had to check
out what was wrong.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:06.830
They redesigned the
command module.

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.900
And then, the world then
nervously watched while Apollo

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.780
4 launched.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:15.170
So, another question.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.580
What do you think, did
it launch with no crew,

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:22.000
three astronauts,
or a chimpanzee?

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.240
And while you think
about your answer,

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.540
you can watch the launch.

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.030
&gt;&gt; Ignition sequence starts.

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:32.880
Five, four -- we have ignition.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.080
All engines are running.

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.710
We have liftoff.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.330
We liftoff at 7:00 a.m.
Eastern Standard Time.

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.110
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: All right.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:45.840
I have a gentleman
right here that would

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:47.140
like to give me the answer.

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.570
What do you think?

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.260
He thinks C, a chimpanzee.

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:52.880
That's a very good guess.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.180
But --

00:06:56.310 --> 00:06:58.180
Okay, now how do I go back?

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.450
No crew. It was actually
new crew.

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:04.410
So what they did,
just to be safe,

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.180
on the next three missions --

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.060
&gt;&gt; Ignition sequence --

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.730
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: Four, five
and six, they all went unmanned.

00:07:14.730 --> 00:07:16.290
They could test the spacecraft,

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.570
they could test their
flight plans.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.440
They wanted to make sure
there was not another accident

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.510
like they had on
that first mission.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.310
So, question three.

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:31.770
Then, on Apollo 7 was
the first manned mission.

00:07:31.770 --> 00:07:37.030
It orbited Earth 163
times successfully.

00:07:37.030 --> 00:07:42.930
But, this crew staged a
mutiny when they refused to:

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:48.710
eat dried spinach, where helmets
to land, or go to bed at 11:00?

00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.170
What do we think?

00:07:51.170 --> 00:07:54.040
They were -- we have a guess.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.150
Yes, dear?

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.840
She thinks B, wear helmets.

00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.710
We've got a very
smart young girl here.

00:07:59.710 --> 00:08:03.250
In fact, they did refuse
to wear the helmets,

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:05.850
and they were not worried
about having helmet hair

00:08:05.850 --> 00:08:07.340
when they landed and
the press was there.

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.210
That was not the concern.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:12.940
They all had developed bad
colds while they were in flight.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.240
And when you're up in space

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.540
where there's very
little gravity,

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:19.250
your sinuses can't drain, and
it was a matter of safety.

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:21.420
They were worried if
their helmets were on,

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.560
and they couldn't
clear their noses

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:25.780
and their sinuses,
they might choke.

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:29.910
But Mission Control was not
happy about this at all.

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:33.080
There were some harsh
words exchanged,

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.880
which I read in the transcript.

00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.970
And then none of those
astronauts ever flew another

00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:41.630
Apollo mission because
of their mutiny.

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:44.930
Okay, question four.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:50.020
Apollo 8 was the first
crew to orbit the Moon.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:53.110
And during one telecast,
Jim Lovell --

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.120
you probably remember
him maybe from Apollo 13,

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.420
which is later -- Jim Lovell
demonstrated how astronauts:

00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:06.590
exercise, make chocolate
pudding, or navigate in space?

00:09:06.590 --> 00:09:12.050
Yes, sir? He thinks how they
exercise, which they do exercise

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:16.790
in space, but in fact, Jim made
up a bag of chocolate pudding.

00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:18.980
And he telecasts this.

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.700
This was halfway on
their way to the Moon.

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.090
You'll be able to
see this footage.

00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.390
It's a little old, so it's
grainy, but you'll see him

00:09:25.390 --> 00:09:27.380
with his chocolate
pudding float by.

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.110
&gt;&gt; Jim is making dessert.

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:35.520
He's making up a bag
of chocolate pudding.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.530
[Inaudible] floating by.

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:38.830
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade:
Another cool thing

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:40.780
about this mission was
this crew was the first

00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.820
to see an earthrise,
which is the Earth rising

00:09:43.820 --> 00:09:45.730
above the surface of the Moon.

00:09:45.730 --> 00:09:47.380
And they got that
beautiful picture

00:09:47.380 --> 00:09:49.580
to share with us earthlings.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:53.880
So, question five.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.580
Now we're up to Apollo 4.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.990
And they had a Lunar Module
which they named Spider,

00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:01.820
which if you look at
it, it kind of does,

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:04.400
a little bit like a spider.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.130
But it flew like a dream.

00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.650
But the crew did
have problems with,

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:14.780
do you think low
batteries, motion sickness,

00:10:14.780 --> 00:10:18.020
or losing things in their ship?

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:21.110
Yes, dear?

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:24.020
She thinks they had
problems with batteries.

00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:27.200
In fact, it was the
other two items.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.280
They had trouble
with motion sickness

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.010
and losing things in their ship.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:35.590
One of the astronauts, Rusty
Schweickart, became very ill

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:37.480
and they weren't even sure
if he was going to be able

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:40.930
to do his spacewalk, but
he was able to do it.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:46.120
And also, the crew kept losing
toothbrushes, food bags.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.520
So, they learned that --
they learned two things:

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:52.120
they need to Velcro their items
in place so they don't float

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.770
around the cabin and get
lost, and they learned

00:10:54.770 --> 00:10:57.390
that vomit droplets
are hard to catch.

00:10:57.390 --> 00:11:01.860
Because, once things are free
and, you know, it was a smelly,

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.640
messy ordeal from what I read.

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:08.470
Okay, question six.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:09.770
We're up to Apollo 10.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.760
This is the mission
before America's going

00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.510
to attempt to land.

00:11:14.510 --> 00:11:16.250
So they had the crucial job.

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:18.930
They had to scout
the landing location

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:22.270
where Apollo 11 would
attempt to land.

00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:24.430
So when they were done
with their work, to relax,

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.000
they liked to listen
to this song.

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.570
Do you think it was
Fly Me to the Moon,

00:11:29.570 --> 00:11:32.880
Space Cowboy, or Moondance?

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:34.680
Yes, dear?

00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:37.350
She thinks Fly Me to the
Moon, and she is right.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.880
Oh, and look at the
ancient technology.

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.770
Anybody remember the
cassette player for --

00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:47.320
it was some ancient
technology they had onboard.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:50.180
Yes, it was Fly Me to the
Moon, and the ironic thing

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:52.030
about that was that
this mission,

00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:54.450
these people flew
closer to the Moon

00:11:54.450 --> 00:11:56.150
than any human had ever been.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:12:02.540
They were in fact nine miles
from the surface of the Moon.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:08.200
Okay. Finally, Apollo 11,
Neil Armstrong has landed.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.680
So, how many people do you think
watched Neil Armstrong take

00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:17.090
that first historic step
on the Moon on live TV?

00:12:17.090 --> 00:12:19.340
Yes, sir?

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.820
&gt;&gt; A lot.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:23.510
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: He said a
lot, our choices are 2 million,

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.670
100 million, or 600 million?

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:28.130
&gt;&gt; A hundred million.

00:12:28.130 --> 00:12:32.020
&gt;&gt; He's guessing 100, that's
very good, but in fact -- oh.

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:35.510
We have to see it.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:44.080
[ Inaudible ]

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.380
&gt;&gt; Thirty seconds.

00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.680
&gt;&gt; Oh, jeez.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:47.980
&gt;&gt; Tranquility Base here.

00:12:47.980 --> 00:12:49.280
The Eagle has landed.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:50.580
[Inaudible]

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.880

00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:53.180
&gt;&gt; Whew.

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:54.480
&gt;&gt; Boy.

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.780
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] going to
be busy for a minute.

00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:57.080
&gt;&gt; There he is.

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.380
There's a foot coming
down the step.

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:01.220
&gt;&gt; I'm at the foot
of the ladder.

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:05.680
&gt;&gt; Armstrong is on the
Moon, Neil Armstrong,

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:11.810
38-year-old American, standing
on the surface of the Moon,

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:16.410
on this July 20th, 1969.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.990
&gt;&gt; That's one small step for
man, one giant leap for mankind.

00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:21.070
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade:
Quite an historic day.

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:22.690
And guess what?

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:26.850
People around the world stopped
whatever they were doing to see

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:29.270
that first man on the Moon.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:31.160
We have people, thousands
of people

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.910
in New York's Central
Park gathered

00:13:32.910 --> 00:13:35.140
to watch it on a large screen.

00:13:35.140 --> 00:13:38.070
Up at the top corner you
see a business in Italy

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:42.060
where people just stopped
work and gathered around a TV.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:45.340
An airport in Sydney, it didn't
matter where they were going.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:49.950
They wanted to stop and see that
a man was actually on the Moon.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:53.610
And of course, homes around
the world, people had parties.

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:57.040
They had Moon-landing parties,
and everyone hoped it would end

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:59.400
up being a good party
and they would land

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.700
and they would survive when
they stepped out on the Moon.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:09.190
Okay, this is our last question.

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:13.050
So, once the Apollo 11
astronauts returned home,

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:17.230
they were quarantined to protect
the world from Moon germs.

00:14:17.230 --> 00:14:22.780
Because doctors didn't know
if there were viruses or germs

00:14:22.780 --> 00:14:25.020
on the Moon that could
bring home an infection

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.030
that would wipe out
our entire planet.

00:14:28.030 --> 00:14:30.280
So, here you see the
crew is being greeted

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:33.390
by President Nixon
from behind glass.

00:14:33.390 --> 00:14:36.260
So, how long do you think they
quarantined the astronauts?

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:37.910
&gt;&gt; Twenty-four hours!

00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:41.490
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: Twenty-four
hours, seven days or 21 days?

00:14:41.490 --> 00:14:46.150
Yes? She said seven days?

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:48.780
That's a great guess, but
they were a little nervous.

00:14:48.780 --> 00:14:50.630
They wanted to be
sure, so in fact,

00:14:50.630 --> 00:14:54.820
they quarantined
them for 21 days.

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:58.450
And then after that,
they celebrated.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:01.140
Everyone celebrated.

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.880
&gt;&gt; What was it we were
really celebrating?

00:15:04.880 --> 00:15:09.080
Three men who had done what
no man before had done?

00:15:09.080 --> 00:15:11.560
A technological feat was
believed beyond the realm

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.680
of possibility?

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:17.690
A fulfillment of
an age-old dream?

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:21.930
Were we celebrating simply
because it had been a long time

00:15:21.930 --> 00:15:24.400
since we had anything
to celebrate?

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.700
Or was this something that
touched an irrational,

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:33.080
unthinking instinct in us all?

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:37.220
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: So, the
celebration included parades

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:40.390
in major cities like
New York and Chicago.

00:15:40.390 --> 00:15:42.120
There you also see
the astronauts

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:44.860
and their wives being
invited to state dinners.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.650
The entire world joined together
and could celebrate together

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:50.910
because of this incredible feat

00:15:50.910 --> 00:15:55.950
that most people quite frankly
didn't think was possible.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:04.050
So, just a little background.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:07.650
I began Countdown
in the fall of 2009.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.830
This was shortly after
the 40th anniversary

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:12.730
of the first Moon landing.

00:16:12.730 --> 00:16:16.680
And I thought, "I would like to
create a special book in time

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:18.270
for the 50th anniversary,"

00:16:18.270 --> 00:16:22.060
which will be this
coming July of 2019.

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:28.160
So, ironically as I look back,
it took about 2979 days for me

00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:31.620
to create this book, which
is a little over eight years.

00:16:31.620 --> 00:16:35.120
Now, as a writer, what happens
is there are often several

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.490
stages that you go through.

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.450
And the first stage,

00:16:38.450 --> 00:16:41.300
when I first get a book
idea, I am very excited.

00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.720
And I think, "This is
going to be awesome!

00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:45.580
I can't wait to dig
into research.

00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:47.500
This is going to be fun!"

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:51.830
But, as the days, weeks, months
and years go on, as a writer --

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:53.650
especially of non-fiction --

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:56.820
you hit a lot of times
that you get frustrated.

00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.530
Sometimes you hit roadblocks.

00:16:58.530 --> 00:17:01.230
I get tired, the fact-checking.

00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:03.100
So, there are many
stages that I went

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:05.250
through until the
book was finished.

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:07.010
But I'm very excited.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:11.390
Today is the day the book
releases, coincidently enough.

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:13.150
Thank you.

00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:15.610
[ Applause ]

00:17:15.610 --> 00:17:18.330
And I'm very excited about
it because I want to share,

00:17:18.330 --> 00:17:20.450
there's so much interesting
history here

00:17:20.450 --> 00:17:24.170
that I feel young readers and
older readers don't realize.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.220
I really think you'll
be fascinated to read

00:17:26.220 --> 00:17:28.220
about this time in history.

00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.030
As I mentioned, research
was really one

00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:34.330
of the most fascinating steps.

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.490
And I got to do some
exciting things.

00:17:36.490 --> 00:17:38.910
Something I never thought
I would be able to do --

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:41.590
for instance, I interviewed
Alan Bean.

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:43.760
He was the fourth
man on the Moon.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.880
He was on the Apollo 12
mission, the mission right

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:48.310
after the first landing.

00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:50.710
And he was kind enough
to allow me

00:17:50.710 --> 00:17:53.140
to do a couple interviews
with him.

00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:56.410
I also, of course, looked
through the NASA transcripts,

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.090
which any of you can look.

00:17:58.090 --> 00:17:59.390
They're online.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:01.620
You can read every word
that the astronauts

00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.720
and Mission Control shared.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.900
I looked at the Apollo
photo archives.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:10.450
I emailed with Walt Cunningham,
Apollo 12, which was interesting

00:18:10.450 --> 00:18:13.970
because his emails -- he's in
his 80s, so his emails come back

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:15.890
in a very big font, and short.

00:18:15.890 --> 00:18:18.110
"Yes." "No."

00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:20.580
But it was all the
information I needed.

00:18:20.580 --> 00:18:24.850
So, that -- it was just really
fun to research this book.

00:18:26.110 --> 00:18:29.770
Meanwhile, once the publisher,
Peachtree Publishers picked

00:18:29.770 --> 00:18:34.160
up the book, my fabulous
illustrator Tom Gonzalez was

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.270
doing research of his
own, was making sketches.

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:40.760
He will make changes
as we go along.

00:18:40.760 --> 00:18:45.260
And then painting his final art,
which is absolutely gorgeous.

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:49.330
His work is just
stunning in this book.

00:18:49.330 --> 00:18:53.210
So, as I mentioned, Countdown
releases today, so I can't think

00:18:53.210 --> 00:18:56.490
of a better place to celebrate
than with fellow booklovers

00:18:56.490 --> 00:18:59.210
like you here at the
National Book Festival.

00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:01.570
It is 144 pages long.

00:19:01.570 --> 00:19:03.130
It's for ages ten and up.

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.470
It's technically a middle grade.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:08.480
It's in free verse,
so it makes it easy

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.080
for reluctant readers as well.

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.600
There's 54 illustrations,
and I'm just very excited

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:17.240
to share it with readers.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.460
So, I just thought that I'd see

00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:21.850
if you have any questions
you'd like to ask me.

00:19:21.850 --> 00:19:23.680
I would love to answer
any questions.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.110
It could be about research,
or the Apollo missions,

00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:31.270
or writing -- whatever
you're interested in.

00:19:40.270 --> 00:19:41.570
&gt;&gt; I have one question.

00:19:41.570 --> 00:19:46.470
Who was filming -- because
if it was the first step,

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:49.650
I just wonder who was
filming into the rocket?

00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:50.950
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade:
You are a very --

00:19:50.950 --> 00:19:53.350
like who was filming him
taking the first step

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:54.800
on the Moon, right?

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.820
Sharp, very good question.

00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:58.660
So, NASA had thought
ahead, right?

00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.410
And they knew everyone
would want to see this,

00:20:00.410 --> 00:20:02.480
so they had put a special camera

00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:04.790
on the outside of
the Lunar Module.

00:20:04.790 --> 00:20:06.580
And the Lunar Module
is the spacecraft

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.880
that lands on the Moon.

00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:11.360
So, once they landed, they
could pop the camera out.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.460
As you saw, the footage,
it was kind of grainy.

00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:14.830
It wasn't high quality.

00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:18.410
But that's how they were able
to have that camera film him

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.830
as Armstrong went out
and took his first step.

00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:24.590
Great question.

00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:29.790
&gt;&gt; Would you ever like
to go to the Moon?

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:31.280
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: Someone
help me with that question?

00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:34.100
&gt;&gt; I think she asked if
you want to go to the Moon.

00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:35.600
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: If I
want to go to the Moon.

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:41.280
You know? I really liked looking
at all the pictures of the Moon,

00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.080
but I don't think I'm quite
brave enough to want to go.

00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.870
Because every time
an astronaut went

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:50.760
and actually 12 people landed
on the Moon, but you never know

00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:52.070
if you were going to make it.

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:53.660
So maybe I'm not that brave.

00:20:53.660 --> 00:20:56.260
But I'd like to read about it.

00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:57.560
Thank you.

00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.560
&gt;&gt; I changed my mind.

00:21:01.660 --> 00:21:05.200
&gt;&gt; Are you planning on
writing any more books?

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:06.650
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: Am I
planning on writing any more --

00:21:06.650 --> 00:21:09.610
yes, I actually have seven other
books that are in the works

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.310
with other publishers.

00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.340
So, if you're interested
in the Moon landing,

00:21:13.340 --> 00:21:16.130
this Countdown book, in
March I have a book coming

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:19.560
out called the Daring Dozen,
because as I mentioned,

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:20.970
12 people have been on the Moon.

00:21:20.970 --> 00:21:23.720
That book is for a little
younger readers, and it talks

00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.280
about what they did
on their missions

00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:27.290
and what they found on the Moon.

00:21:27.290 --> 00:21:28.930
And I've got another book coming

00:21:28.930 --> 00:21:31.740
up in March called A
Computer Called Catherine.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.980
And it's about Catherine
Johnson who was a human computer

00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.450
who helped plot the
trajectories for all

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:40.940
of these -- for many missions.

00:21:40.940 --> 00:21:42.240
&gt;&gt; I'm going to still
think about it.

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.540
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: Thank you.

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:44.840
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.320
&gt;&gt; How many Apollo
missions have there been?

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:51.040
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: There have
been 17 Apollo missions.

00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:56.430
But as I mentioned, Apollo 2
and 3 were scrubbed, and then 4,

00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.340
5 and 6 were unmanned.

00:21:58.340 --> 00:22:00.680
But 17 is our total.

00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:05.360
&gt;&gt; What did it feel
like reading the book?

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.160
I mean, making the book?

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.640
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: What do I
feel like making the book?

00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:10.940
You know what?

00:22:10.940 --> 00:22:13.630
I tell you, at the
beginning I feel, "Yoo-hoo,

00:22:13.630 --> 00:22:14.930
I'm going to make a book!"

00:22:14.930 --> 00:22:18.700
And then I get researching
and working and I'm going,

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:20.100
"Oh wow, this is really hard.

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.400
This is harder than I thought.

00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.700
I don't know if I can do it."

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:26.450
You ever feel like
that sometimes?

00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:29.980
But then I keep working and
I keep working, and I --

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.000
then I get feelings
of being tired

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.940
and excited about research.

00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:38.760
So, lots of feelings
go into making a book.

00:22:38.760 --> 00:22:40.290
Thank you.

00:22:40.290 --> 00:22:43.880
&gt;&gt; When you were younger, was
science your favorite subject?

00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:45.180
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: Yes.

00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:47.710
In fact, science and math
were my favorite subjects.

00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:52.150
And can I tell you a secret
you won't tell my publisher?

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:56.230
Okay, writing was my least
favorite subject in school.

00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:59.020
It was! But I was a huge reader.

00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:03.310
I joined my summer reading club
at my library every summer,

00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:05.700
and I read lots and
lots of books.

00:23:05.700 --> 00:23:08.840
And reading helps you
become a better writer.

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:11.950
So, I think it was key
that I kept reading.

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:15.310
&gt;&gt; How did you guys
know how much food

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:18.180
that you needed on the trip?

00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:20.330
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: You
mean the trip to the Moon?

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.630
Great question.

00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.850
Well, they had nutritionists,
and those are people who study

00:23:24.850 --> 00:23:26.940
about food, who worked

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:29.840
to package all the meals
for the astronauts.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:33.510
And they were all packaged which
-- each astronaut had a color,

00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:36.080
I believe, of the bags
that would have their food.

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:37.660
And they knew, "At this meal,

00:23:37.660 --> 00:23:39.230
this is exactly what
I'm eating."

00:23:39.230 --> 00:23:41.690
So they planned out the calories

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:43.880
and how much nutrition
they would need.

00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:47.430
And they would add water to
the food before they ate it.

00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:48.730
Great question.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:55.250
&gt;&gt; If you could go to the Moon,
what would you bring with you?

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:56.840
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: Gosh, I
don't know but you know what?

00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.340
You remind me of
something that Alan Bean --

00:23:59.340 --> 00:24:01.450
remember I said I interviewed
the fourth man on the Moon?

00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:04.640
And he said he had one
regret about his mission,

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:08.840
and that was he wished he had
taken a football to the Moon,

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.700
because he wanted to throw the
longest pass in the universe.

00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.260
Because on the Moon there's
one-sixth of the gravity

00:24:15.260 --> 00:24:17.820
that we have on Earth,
and there's no air.

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:19.340
So, if you could
throw a football,

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.290
it would have gone for forever.

00:24:21.290 --> 00:24:26.960
So, thank you.

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.640
&gt;&gt; How long did it take
to land on the Moon?

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.090
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: How
long did it take to land?

00:24:33.090 --> 00:24:36.020
That's a great question
because actually they --

00:24:36.020 --> 00:24:38.520
on the Lunar Module, the
thing that was going to land,

00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.000
they only put just
enough fuel to land.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.620
So, once they took off to
land, they had to land quickly.

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:50.130
And so it got very tense
as Apollo 11 was landing;

00:24:50.130 --> 00:24:52.490
they were almost out of fuel.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:54.300
So, it didn't take
long at all for them

00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.110
to find their spot and land.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.410
Great question.

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:08.430
&gt;&gt; How long have you
been writing books?

00:25:08.430 --> 00:25:11.220
&gt;&gt; Suzanne Slade: I've
been writing books

00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.190
for about 22 years.

00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:14.490
But guess what?

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:18.130
It took eight years to get
my first book published.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.090
For eight years, when I'd mail
my story to the publishers,

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:23.830
the people who make the
books, all I heard back

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.740
from them was, "No, thank you.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:27.070
We don't want to
publish your book."

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:29.710
And that's called
a rejection letter.

00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:32.520
So, I had to be persistent,
and I had a lot

00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.300
to learn about writing.

00:25:34.300 --> 00:25:37.320
Because I was an engineer,
so I had to learn a lot.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:39.870
But I'm glad that
I stuck so when --

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:43.200
last thing I want to say before
I leave, for you kids who,

00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.520
when you try something new
and when you first do it,

00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:47.660
maybe you're not
really good at it.

00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.800
Maybe soccer, or
playing a new instrument.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.530
But if you love it, keep at it.

00:25:52.530 --> 00:25:54.920
Because the more you practice,
the better you'll get.

00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.230
Which is exactly what
happened with me and writing.

00:25:57.230 --> 00:25:58.550
So, well, thank you.

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:00.960
I've been told we're out of
time but thank you for being

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.960
such a wonderful audience.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.810
And if you want to sign my book
or meet with me, I'll be 4:30

00:26:06.810 --> 00:26:08.930
to 5:30 in the signing area.

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:10.230
Thank you.
