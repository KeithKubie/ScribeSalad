00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Okay. let's complete this thing. We are here in quote equals not quote.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is control dependent on this earlier statement, which again reads from C,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
that we have seen the dependencies of C before, but it also reads from tag.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So this is dependent on all the places that tag is being set, and then again this

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
is up to this one up here, and then again whether tag is being set or not, implies

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
a control dependency towards the governing conditions.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
What is usually more interesting in the backwards slice itself, is what

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
is not contained in the backwards slice.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
That is, the statements that are not checked.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
What you are seeing here is the statements that are not part of the backwards slice,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
are statements that refer to out, setting out, checking out, and returning out,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
but nothing of what happens to out actually has any effect on tag at this point.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And this is precisely what the backwards slice gives us.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000
It tells us if we want to know why this statement was executed.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Well, we know it can't depend on out, because there is no dependency of tag

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
towards out in any way, or out cannot influence the value of tag in any way.
