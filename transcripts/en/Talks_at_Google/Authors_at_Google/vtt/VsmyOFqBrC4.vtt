SPEAKER 1: Please join me in
welcoming Susan to Google.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.277
We're really delighted
to have her here.

00:00:10.277 --> 00:00:13.162
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:14.554 --> 00:00:16.515
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: What
a treat to be back.

00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:18.420
Yesterday was so
much fun, and I see

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.440
some repeat faces, people
who brought their partners.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.950
You need to hear this.

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.240
So, it's my joy to do this work.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.300
It's my joy to
speak with parents

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.940
about perhaps the most important
thing going on in our lives.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.350
Yes, we care very much about the
world, the planet, our careers,

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.130
our jobs, but
something happens to us

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.130
when we become a parent
that changes us irreparably.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:57.840
I know for me, when
I became a mother,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.880
actually when I went
into labor I really

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.850
didn't know it was going
to be that intense.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.320
So after the second, I think
the second contraction,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.860
I told my then husband,
I've changed my mind.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.290
I don't want to
do this actually.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.370
And 27 hours later, and
9 and 1/2 pounds later,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.580
I became a mother.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:34.320
And I'm a different human
being in every possible way.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.730
Not only because of the love
that was birthed in my heart,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.290
but also because no
one, I don't know

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.680
if this is your experience, but
nobody can push your buttons,

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.850
or challenge you
like your children.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.800
I'm getting a lot
of nods and laughs.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.350
You know what I'm talking about.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.520
Because not only are we
really not all that prepared

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.130
for what it is to be responsible
for the unrelenting demands

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.570
of other people all the time.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.680
But also, we're
the same species.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.560
We don't become a
different species

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.830
when we become a parent.

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.520
So we still get
tired, overwhelmed,

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.060
we still have our baggage
from our own upbringing.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.940
Feeling overpowered,
or invisible,

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.080
or whatever our particular
flavor of challenge

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.570
might have been as a child.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.350
And so when we
become a parent we

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.830
have this opportunity
to grow our children,

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.910
raise them, but also
to grow ourselves.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.340
And that's one of the
gifts of this work.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.485
And one of the reasons I
have so much fun doing it.

00:02:50.485 --> 00:02:53.220
I speak all over the world.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.730
I've delivered the
same talk, or similar,

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.920
in almost every continent.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.820
And then I do, as Rutika
said, a lot online.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.030
We have a lot of programs.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.490
I have our monthly
membership where

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.370
I've got people from
every country that

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.850
meet with me every month, for
not very many dollars a month.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.580
We just talk about
whatever is up for them.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.070
So I'm working with
parents now progressively

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.910
to help them internalize
what we're learning.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.837
Because the truth is, the
things I teach work really well.

00:03:25.837 --> 00:03:27.420
In fact, we were
talking this morning,

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.086
because I did a three
hour workshop here

00:03:29.086 --> 00:03:31.050
at Google yesterday.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.055
And I've also done some
other talks in the area

00:03:34.055 --> 00:03:38.340
at various organizations,
and churches, and schools.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.420
And people try something the
next day, and you were saying,

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.340
just this one little adjustment
avoided a meltdown with 2

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.970
and 1/2 year old.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.230
Or maybe two-year-old, right?

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.650
And how even though
it isn't intuitive,

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.570
the things I'm going
to teach you today,

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.120
may not be how you were raised.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:58.630
It's not rocket science.

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:03.780
It's not that difficult to
begin parenting in a way

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.270
that both reassures
our kids that there

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:10.860
is a grownup in the room,
which is very comforting,

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.870
and that also preserves the
love and the connection.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.810
A lot of us were good kids.

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:19.510
We cooperated.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.044
Our parents said, do
something, we did it.

00:04:22.044 --> 00:04:23.460
But sometimes that
came at a cost.

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.971
Sometimes we got sneaky,
and we just went underground

00:04:25.971 --> 00:04:28.470
about the thing we wanted to
do that they were preventing us

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.560
from doing.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.040
Or sometimes we just
built up resentment.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.650
Or worse, maybe
not worse, but we

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.300
would also-- when
we were in trouble

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.420
or struggling with something,
and we needed a sane person

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.720
to sort out the
tanglements of our life,

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:48.690
we would turn to our friends
instead of our parents.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:53.190
Who had life experience,
and who hopefully

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:55.410
cared about our best interests.

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.660
So my work is very
much about holding

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.140
a place for our children that
allows us to parent them,

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:07.300
guide them, support
them, and continue

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.756
to build a very deep and
strong connection with them.

00:05:09.756 --> 00:05:11.380
I'm going to go over
a few things today

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.950
and then we'll have
some questions.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:18.280
And let me start by giving
you the initial piece.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:21.250
The fundamental
piece of my work.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.100
And that is that I believe that
parents need to be what I call,

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.130
the captain of the ship
for their children.

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.060
That means, not that you're
in control of your children,

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.690
I'm definitely not
advocating control.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:36.870
I'm about being in charge.

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.425
Being the person that they
can turn to if you're, you

00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:43.090
know using this nautical
theme, the captain of the ship.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.573
You know, if you're on a
ship and you hear this woop,

00:05:45.573 --> 00:05:50.080
woop alarm go off, you don't
want the captain leaping

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.840
over the side of the ship
because he or she doesn't know

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.600
what to do or is overwhelmed.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.310
You want the captain
who's steady,

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.920
who's calm, who's confident.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.880
Who can handle the news
that there is a leak,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:08.310
or that there's a heavy storm
ahead, and doesn't jump ship.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.410
I guess that's the term, right.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.890
And so the idea I'm going to
demonstrate, a very simple hand

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.890
motion for you, so that
you can remember it.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.440
And lots of people tell me
that they and their partner

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:23.560
will end up using the signal
behind the children's back

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.840
just to reinforce and
remind themselves of holding

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.330
this place for their children.

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:33.580
Even when our buttons
are getting pushed.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.160
My right hand is going
to represent the parent,

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.880
and my left hand will
be the child, OK.

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.380
Parent, child.

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:43.380
I have a watch on the
child hand if that helps.

00:06:43.380 --> 00:06:49.360
So the child might say,
maybe your 9-year-old says,

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.330
daddy I want to watch
horror movies from hell

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:57.240
tonight at 11:00 o'clock.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.240
And you say, well
I'm afraid not.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.980
Because as the parent,
as the captain,

00:07:02.980 --> 00:07:04.330
that's not a good idea.

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:06.360
You have a child who
is very impressionable,

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.797
images are very powerful.

00:07:07.797 --> 00:07:10.380
This is a kid who's not going
to sleep for the next six months

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.900
if he watch horror
night from hell.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:14.680
So you say, I'm afraid not.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.830
And the child says, why not.

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:21.000
And you say, now
watch this carefully,

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.560
because you'll have bad dreams.

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.715
No I won't.

00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:28.000
Yeah, you watched a movie
that wasn't nearly that scary

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.740
and you couldn't sleep for days.

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:31.870
I know but that
movie had vampires

00:07:31.870 --> 00:07:33.220
and the blood was oozing.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.500
This movie, all my
friends have seen it

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:38.970
and there is no vampire
oozing blood in this movie.

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:42.190
Well honey, it's not
about that oozing blood.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:46.040
So who's in charge
here, you guys.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.000
No one.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.500
Nobody's in charge here.

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:52.450
So I call this the captain of
the ship, when you go here I

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.250
call this the two lawyers.

00:07:56.250 --> 00:07:57.340
The two lawyers.

00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.960
This is where you're arguing.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.690
You're each arguing
for your position.

00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:03.500
One is defending
against the other

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:06.060
using rational
thought and arguments

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:09.190
to try and convince the other
person of why you're right.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.440
Does that sound
familiar to any of you?

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:12.940
Yes.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:16.650
Both parents say,
oh I live there.

00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:17.800
But wait.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.890
There's another it
devolves even further.

00:08:22.890 --> 00:08:24.940
If you don't let
me watch that movie

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:28.966
I'm not doing my homework,
or I'm not doing my chores,

00:08:28.966 --> 00:08:30.340
or I'm not going
to feed the dog,

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:32.590
or I'm going to go
tease my brother.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:35.320
You know, knock down his tower.

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.470
And now you're down here.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:41.500
And you're feeling
internally, how

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.530
are you feeling when
you're like that?

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.930
Like your child is attempting
to put you into the corner.

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:51.000
Holding you hostage.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.300
Desperate.

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.290
Angry.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:54.420
Disrespected.

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:56.540
Out of control.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:59.620
And from this
place, which I call

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:03.660
the dictator, because dictators
don't have authentic power.

00:09:03.660 --> 00:09:05.980
They have no genuine authority.

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.070
They rule by fear
and intimidation.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:12.730
They can wipe out bank accounts,
throw your family in prison,

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:15.610
take your home, confiscate
your possessions.

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:17.470
So it looks, it's
faux power, but they

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.620
don't have any genuine power.

00:09:19.620 --> 00:09:21.370
But from down here
in the dictator mode,

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:24.550
you will bribe or threaten.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.170
Because you feel overwhelmed.

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:30.160
And you feel out of
control and in an attempt

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:32.380
to feel in control
again, but remember

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:35.940
this is not about control
this is in charge,

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:38.530
you will assert your weight.

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:39.930
But that comes at a cost.

00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:42.850
Because your child now, as I
said there can be resentment,

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.000
there can be fear.

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.680
None of us like to be
intimidated into doing what

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:51.580
we're being asked to do, do we.

00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:58.140
So captain of the ship,
two lawyers, dictator.

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.030
Everything that I teach,
and all these we talked

00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:03.040
about the summits, and
the membership program,

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:05.770
and the classes I
do online classes,

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.560
everything is about this.

00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:13.965
Because when we come
alongside our children,

00:10:13.965 --> 00:10:15.980
this is my little hand
motion, rather than

00:10:15.980 --> 00:10:20.770
at our children as
the lawyer who argues,

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.970
or as the dictator
who threatens,

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.820
when we come alongside them
as that confident captain,

00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:30.440
life is so much easier.

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.730
They want to say yes.

00:10:31.730 --> 00:10:33.370
They want to cooperate.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:36.080
They look to us for guidance.

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.010
They're receptive to our wisdom.

00:10:39.010 --> 00:10:41.940
It's so much easier to parent.

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:43.580
So I want to do a
quick demonstration,

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:44.630
would you come up?

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.684
And have I prepared
you or anything?

00:10:46.684 --> 00:10:47.480
AUDIENCE: No.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.690
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: So
he's not been primed.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:51.050
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: All I want you
to do is face me right there,

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:52.341
and if you'd put your hand out.

00:10:52.341 --> 00:10:53.400
OK, ready.

00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.898
OK.

00:10:54.898 --> 00:10:56.400
Great.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.960
OK, thank you so much.

00:10:57.960 --> 00:11:00.860
A big round of
applause for Martin.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:02.679
Did I ask you to push?

00:11:02.679 --> 00:11:03.220
AUDIENCE: No.

00:11:03.220 --> 00:11:04.940
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: No.

00:11:04.940 --> 00:11:06.740
But you pushed.

00:11:06.740 --> 00:11:10.270
And I've done this
in every part of the,

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:13.390
every part of the world.

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:17.310
And without exception,
everyone pushes.

00:11:17.310 --> 00:11:20.660
So it's not, I'm not, yes
you should have pushed,

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:23.720
that's your instinct.

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:29.360
And the reason for this is
that we push against that

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:32.260
which pushes against us.

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:34.220
That's how we're wired.

00:11:34.220 --> 00:11:37.220
So when I began to push
against him, of course

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.600
he was going to push back.

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:42.230
Now, if you were in the martial
arts field, which some of you

00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:44.969
may be, I suppose you
know that you could just

00:11:44.969 --> 00:11:46.760
move out of the way
and let me fall forward

00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.940
of my own momentum, but
we're not wired like that.

00:11:50.940 --> 00:11:54.710
So when you come at your
child from that lawyer mode,

00:11:54.710 --> 00:12:00.440
or from dictator, they
are going to push back.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:03.340
If you'd like to have power
struggles with your children,

00:12:03.340 --> 00:12:06.742
if that's your
goal, come at them.

00:12:06.742 --> 00:12:08.200
Why didn't you
start your homework?

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.510
Of course you can't
go see that movie?

00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.280
How many times have I told
you to brush your teeth?

00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:15.640
All of those are push.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.950
And you will more often
than not get push back.

00:12:18.950 --> 00:12:20.070
And there is a better way.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:21.590
I mean that's the thing.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:25.250
If there was no other
option, than I would say,

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:28.580
oh well we all turned
out all right, it's fine.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.870
But since there's a way
to parent our children.

00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:35.780
Staying present, staying
in a more receptive,

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.300
creating more receptivity.

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.280
I think it's worth exploring.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:43.460
Not only because it's
so, makes the climate

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:48.230
in our home more peaceful, and
harmonious, and happy and safe.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.800
But here's the bonus,
there's a bonus to this.

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:54.640
We get to heal.

00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.460
We get to heal.

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.859
I know in the raising of my
son, doing it differently,

00:12:59.859 --> 00:13:01.900
certain things, of course,
are similar to the way

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:02.780
my parents raised me.

00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:05.360
But some of these things
as I learned along the way,

00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:06.860
and I certainly
didn't know all this

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:11.210
when he was first round
either, I'm a work in progress.

00:13:11.210 --> 00:13:15.860
But so much healing has
happened for me internally, even

00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:23.780
beyond therapy, just that this
is what it feels like to be,

00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:25.280
watch a child bloom.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:27.410
Watch a child feel
they can shine

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:29.137
and be who there
supposed to be, and have

00:13:29.137 --> 00:13:30.720
their own point of
view, and feelings.

00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:37.390
It's a learning process for
sure, but it's a glorious one.

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:42.760
So when we're captaining
the ship things go better.

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:46.970
I want to give you some ideas
for how you can do just that.

00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:51.230
The first piece that
we know about what

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:54.470
motivates children to
see us as that captain,

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:58.570
is connection and attachment.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:14:04.430
I gave this example, let's say
that you were part of a tribe.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:09.400
And so in times past, or in some
other part of the world, even

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.520
today, and your child
drifted or wandered over

00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:17.530
to the edge of the perimeter
of that tribe's territory,

00:14:17.530 --> 00:14:21.290
let's say it's your
four-year-old child.

00:14:21.290 --> 00:14:24.050
And a stranger approaches
from the other side

00:14:24.050 --> 00:14:28.010
and says, hey, you come with me.

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:29.457
What do you want
your child to do?

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:35.040
Say no.

00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:38.660
And who do you want
them to run back to?

00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:40.950
You, right.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:42.270
This is a good thing.

00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:47.460
Children, this is
very important,

00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.730
are wired to resist
being bossed around.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:54.380
News flash.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:56.870
In case you hadn't
noticed, children

00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:00.090
are wired to resist
being bossed around.

00:15:00.090 --> 00:15:02.010
The good news is,
because that would

00:15:02.010 --> 00:15:04.740
be highly inconvenient
for us as parents,

00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:06.777
how do you ever get
anything accomplished.

00:15:06.777 --> 00:15:08.360
Do they want to brush
their teeth, no.

00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.600
Do they want to do
their homework, no.

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:15.750
We can override that
instinct by attachment.

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.180
So the child runs back
to you because you're

00:15:18.180 --> 00:15:21.960
the one to whom he
or she is connected.

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:26.850
And we get, that's the
loophole for this wise instinct

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:31.080
that mother nature has embedded
in our children for survival.

00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.720
We don't want them subject
to the influence of those

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:37.440
who might not have their
best interests at heart.

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:40.260
So it's good that
they're wired to resist

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:46.260
being bossed around outside
that circle of safe influence.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:49.410
So the way we override that,
the way we foster greater

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:52.260
receptivity,
greater cooperation,

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:57.060
begins with, as that captain,
developing attachment.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:00.620
The way the roots of a
tree go wide and deep.

00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:05.400
We develop a sturdy
foundation of connection.

00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:07.650
So here's the tree.

00:16:07.650 --> 00:16:10.170
Everyone see the tree
above the ground.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:11.480
There's the tree.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:14.350
And below the tree
are the roots.

00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.520
This is the root system.

00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:21.210
The health of a
tree is not really,

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:23.877
you can't really
determine by looking

00:16:23.877 --> 00:16:25.710
at what's going on above
ground, it's really

00:16:25.710 --> 00:16:28.980
based on what's going on
in the ground underneath.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:33.330
How wide and how deep and
sturdy those roots are.

00:16:33.330 --> 00:16:36.210
So there are six
stages of attachment

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:38.790
that a child will move
through in their first six

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:42.510
years of life and then
continues to go through in life.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.580
I use Neufeld's
model, which I think

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:47.940
is an excellent model in my
courses and what I teach,

00:16:47.940 --> 00:16:50.430
because it very
clearly illustrates

00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:53.600
this beautiful journey of
bonding and connecting.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:59.250
And if attachment is weak in
any or all of these areas,

00:16:59.250 --> 00:17:04.200
you will see evidence of
that in the child's defiance.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.839
It's not the only reason a
child might be chronically

00:17:06.839 --> 00:17:09.890
oppositional or defiant.

00:17:09.890 --> 00:17:11.819
But if you have a
child, when I get

00:17:11.819 --> 00:17:14.339
a call for coaching,
or in our membership

00:17:14.339 --> 00:17:16.980
when somebody gets on.

00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.980
Gosh, you know, Tommy is
just saying no to everything.

00:17:19.980 --> 00:17:21.960
One of the first things
I'll ask is what's

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.510
the quality of the attachment.

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:28.470
So when a baby is born,
the journey of attachment

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:31.530
begins, if you imagine
the root just beginning

00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:36.480
to enter the ground
here, the first movement

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:39.360
into this process is proximity.

00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:41.630
That's the first stage.

00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:44.140
I talk about this in the
books and on my other things,

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:47.220
but if you're taking
notes, it's proximity.

00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:51.180
Proximity is the sound of your
voice, it's smell, it's touch,

00:17:51.180 --> 00:17:55.020
it's very sense oriented because
that's where the infant is

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:57.510
starting to connect with you.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.190
The second stage is, sameness.

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.930
So this is how two-year-old
children acquire language.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.320
They mimic you.

00:18:05.320 --> 00:18:07.130
They want to be like you.

00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.150
And if you have, in
one of my classes

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.330
I had the parent of a
16-year-old who was very, very

00:18:12.330 --> 00:18:15.300
drifting further and further
away toward her friends

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.310
away from mom, and
we started to look

00:18:17.310 --> 00:18:20.870
at where they had
similar interests

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.830
and it was photography.

00:18:22.830 --> 00:18:25.140
And so she started
to do photography

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:27.790
with her daughter, sort
of seriously pursuing it

00:18:27.790 --> 00:18:31.180
and it reconnected them.

00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:32.901
And this can be true
across the board,

00:18:32.901 --> 00:18:34.400
even if you have a
very young child.

00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:39.320
They like ponies, they like,
I mean, they like Pokemon,

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:40.530
whatever it is.

00:18:40.530 --> 00:18:44.150
That you look for a place
where you have an interest,

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:47.945
ideally that you share and you
build connection in that way.

00:18:47.945 --> 00:18:49.320
The third stage,
so the roots are

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:53.631
going even wider and deeper,
is belonging or loyalty.

00:18:53.631 --> 00:18:55.130
And this is the
sense that the child

00:18:55.130 --> 00:18:56.962
feels that you're on her side.

00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:02.460
We see issues of
this for instance,

00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:06.570
if you're the coach of
your child's soccer team.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.610
And you're the coach,
and so from time to time

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.440
you might have to treat
your child like all

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.640
the other children, and
you might have to say,

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:14.930
hey dude, you should
have done this.

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:16.800
Sometimes kids
don't do very well

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.640
with that because it compromises
their feeling of loyalty,

00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:22.180
or a dad or mom
having their back.

00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:26.120
Three-year-old children in this
state of developing attachment,

00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:28.770
may push their sibling
off of your lap.

00:19:28.770 --> 00:19:29.900
My daddy.

00:19:29.900 --> 00:19:31.590
My mommy.

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:37.070
And they may also
propose marriage to you.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.380
I just love you so much, Mommy.

00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:40.130
Will you marry me?

00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:43.840
Fourth stage.

00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:47.220
Roots growing even wider
and deeper, is significance.

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.370
And significance is the
sense that the child

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:53.680
feels seen, and
celebrated, and cherished

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:56.370
by you just as they are.

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:58.890
Not based on their achievements,
or their accomplishments,

00:19:58.890 --> 00:20:04.380
or how good they make you look
as a parent or as a person.

00:20:04.380 --> 00:20:09.630
It's the delight that you have
in your existence in your life.

00:20:09.630 --> 00:20:11.580
And it's very, very
powerful for children

00:20:11.580 --> 00:20:14.880
to feel cherished by you.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:18.430
It helps them feel close to you.

00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:21.340
The fifth stage, the roots
even going wider and deeper,

00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.150
is love.

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:26.490
It's this pure,
unadulterated transmission

00:20:26.490 --> 00:20:29.560
of warmth and connection
that your child

00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:31.300
feels in your presence.

00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:34.250
Not just the words.

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:36.100
It's the way your
face might light up

00:20:36.100 --> 00:20:39.950
when they come into the room,
or they call you on the phone.

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:43.410
I know when my son calls, to
this day now, he's now 6' 5"

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.054
and 26 years old.

00:20:45.054 --> 00:20:46.470
And if he walks
in the house, it's

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.890
like, woohoo, I just love him.

00:20:49.890 --> 00:20:51.950
And it's not just the words.

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:56.450
I connect, I move into a place
where I remember that love.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:58.974
I line myself up with it.

00:20:58.974 --> 00:21:00.390
It doesn't mean
always, it doesn't

00:21:00.390 --> 00:21:02.020
mean I'm effusive all the time.

00:21:04.570 --> 00:21:08.070
But there's something very
pure about that that is felt.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.910
We feel it with
anyone who we love.

00:21:10.910 --> 00:21:13.520
And then the final stage,
if all has gone well

00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:19.460
with these stages, from the age
of 6 onward, is being known.

00:21:19.460 --> 00:21:20.750
Being known.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:25.620
So this is the child who wants
to tell you their secrets.

00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:28.830
Doesn't want to
hold back from you.

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:29.860
Feels safe.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:34.190
And we teach children,
by our reactions

00:21:34.190 --> 00:21:36.840
because if we
react to their news

00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:40.140
rather than responding
in ways that

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.790
make them feel ashamed
or afraid, then

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:48.980
we teach them not to
tell us what's really

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:50.990
going on in their
lives, especially

00:21:50.990 --> 00:21:53.410
as life gets more complicated.

00:21:53.410 --> 00:21:55.490
So if you want your
14-year-old to tell you

00:21:55.490 --> 00:21:59.780
when she's thinking
about drinking

00:21:59.780 --> 00:22:01.500
with her girlfriends
on Friday night

00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.840
because they're all
going to try it.

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:07.220
Then you want to
ideally make it possible

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:10.460
for your four-year-old,
when that child is four,

00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:14.084
to come to you when she's
afraid of something,

00:22:14.084 --> 00:22:15.750
or someone's been
mean to her at school,

00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:18.475
or maybe she was mean to
someone and got in trouble.

00:22:18.475 --> 00:22:20.100
You want to make it
safe because you're

00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:26.990
that captain who responds rather
than reacts out of your hurt,

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.555
or need, or story.

00:22:28.555 --> 00:22:30.420
Does that makes sense?

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:33.420
So we can fortify and build
connection with our children

00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.490
all through their lives.

00:22:34.490 --> 00:22:40.220
Proximity means, you, me,
let's play a game of chess.

00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.410
I seek out the child
when they're not

00:22:43.410 --> 00:22:46.170
chasing me or
hanging onto my leg,

00:22:46.170 --> 00:22:48.510
please one more
game of Candyland.

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:52.460
But you initiate,
out of generosity,

00:22:52.460 --> 00:22:54.770
once in a while go find
your child when they're not

00:22:54.770 --> 00:22:58.080
expecting i tor demanding
it and say, hey,

00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.310
I just had this great idea.

00:22:59.310 --> 00:23:02.190
Do you want to go color in
your coloring book together?

00:23:02.190 --> 00:23:04.140
And they haven't
even asked for it.

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:04.920
Wow.

00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.000
That's amazing.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.530
Sameness.

00:23:08.530 --> 00:23:10.970
Look for something the two
of you enjoy doing and do it.

00:23:10.970 --> 00:23:12.730
Take a cooking class.

00:23:12.730 --> 00:23:16.080
Go study the bugs
in the backyard.

00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:18.461
If you have at least some
interest in your child's

00:23:18.461 --> 00:23:18.960
fascinated.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:22.590
Belonging and loyalty.

00:23:22.590 --> 00:23:24.048
If they have a
homework assignment,

00:23:24.048 --> 00:23:26.680
rub their shoulders, make them
a cup of tea, be on their side,

00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:29.636
let them feel that
you're on their team.

00:23:29.636 --> 00:23:32.010
And I talk about significance,
and love, and being known,

00:23:32.010 --> 00:23:36.060
so these are very fundamental
elements of my work.

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:42.800
When we change, what I call
the pH of our relationship

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:43.590
with our child.

00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:46.550
So imagine there's a cylinder
with a solution in it.

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:50.130
And it's funny I'm at
Google, because I have

00:23:50.130 --> 00:23:53.160
zero background in science.

00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:55.650
So I'm going to sound like
I know more than I do.

00:23:55.650 --> 00:23:58.550
This is like the one
thing I kind of know.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.120
So if you had a solution
that was too acidic,

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.370
the pH of that solution
has too much acid.

00:24:05.370 --> 00:24:08.510
You don't neutralize
it by removing acid.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.940
You add alkaline, you add base.

00:24:11.940 --> 00:24:14.540
If I get a call, or I'm
working with a family

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:18.500
where the child is chronically
resistant or defiant.

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:21.360
One of my first
questions will be,

00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.580
how would your child rate
the level of attachment

00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:29.430
on these six areas,
or the overview?

00:24:29.430 --> 00:24:32.450
Because typically a child
who feel very close to you

00:24:32.450 --> 00:24:36.050
and connected, tries their
best to behave for you.

00:24:36.050 --> 00:24:37.550
They want to please you.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.010
Just like you do.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.870
You try harder for someone
that you genuinely like,

00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:46.700
who you feel genuinely
likes and enjoys you.

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.190
Than out of obligation or duty.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:51.830
It's just how we are.

00:24:51.830 --> 00:24:54.900
So these stages of
attachment, while simple,

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.180
are so fundamental to being
the captain of the ship

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:00.540
because they change the
pH of that relationship

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:02.020
so it's healthy.

00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.980
So you have something
kind of to work with.

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.550
Does that make sense so far?

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:06.915
So far so good?

00:25:06.915 --> 00:25:07.415
OK.

00:25:10.610 --> 00:25:14.730
There's a second piece that
goes into being that captain.

00:25:14.730 --> 00:25:17.840
I won't go into this too
much, this is a deeper topic

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.250
but I want to just touch on it.

00:25:20.250 --> 00:25:22.650
So imagine that you're
holding a snapshot.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:25.790
I always think of Polaroids,
and I'll bet many of you,

00:25:25.790 --> 00:25:27.780
if not most of you
don't even know anymore

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.360
what a Polaroid picture was.

00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.290
But in my day, which
wasn't that long ago,

00:25:32.290 --> 00:25:34.680
there were these cool cameras,
and you could instantly

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.350
take a picture and print it.

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:38.000
So I always picture
the Polaroid.

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.950
Here's the Polaroid, and this
picture that you're holding,

00:25:40.950 --> 00:25:44.000
is of your ideal child.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:47.695
This is a child who,
when you say, sweetheart,

00:25:47.695 --> 00:25:49.070
it's time to start
your homework.

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:53.570
They say, sure mom
thanks for reminding me.

00:25:53.570 --> 00:25:55.820
And this is the child when
you say, honey, it's time

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.653
to brush your teeth and
get in your jammies.

00:25:57.653 --> 00:26:01.660
They go, oh great, I'm
just so ready for that.

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.780
Goodnight.

00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:03.830
Have a goodnight, mommy.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.730
I know you're so tired.

00:26:05.730 --> 00:26:06.910
You get a good sleep now.

00:26:06.910 --> 00:26:09.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.220
This is your snapshot child.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:15.720
I call it snapshot
child syndrome.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:20.420
How many of you suffer from
snapshot child syndrome?

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:25.740
And the reason that we move into
lawyer mode or dictator mode

00:26:25.740 --> 00:26:27.822
is that we lose our cool.

00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.663
Happens to the best of us.

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.850
And so I'm always interested in
getting to the root of things.

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:39.510
Like I'm not a Band-Aid person.

00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:41.182
I'm not a person
that scripts for you.

00:26:41.182 --> 00:26:42.890
Here's what to say
when your children are

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:44.149
fighting in the back seat.

00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:45.690
Here's what to say
when you found out

00:26:45.690 --> 00:26:47.590
your daughter was cheating.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:49.780
I want to know why.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:51.760
Why does that
behavior make sense.

00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.420
So the root of this issue
of why we lose our cool,

00:26:56.420 --> 00:27:01.010
and move into that argumentative
lawyer, where we're pushing.

00:27:01.010 --> 00:27:06.980
Or that dictator, who's
overpowering and intimidating

00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:11.420
to feel some sense
of faux control.

00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.100
It's not because our
child has kicked down

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.850
his brother's tower.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:19.972
It's because we think
he shouldn't have.

00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:25.780
It's the mismatch
between this photo

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.430
of our idealized child
and that real one,

00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:32.080
in flesh and blood
in front of us.

00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:36.920
That mismatch causes
us to lose our cool.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:38.240
Does that make sense?

00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.990
It's an inside job.

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:47.341
It's what we're believing in our
head that contradicts reality.

00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:49.840
Rutika mentioned Byron Katie,
and I don't know if any of you

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.850
are familiar, but I love
the work of Byron Katie

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:54.580
and I've been doing some
parenting programs with her.

00:27:54.580 --> 00:27:57.440
And it's been such a
delight because she

00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:01.961
has a process of inquiry
that I include in my books

00:28:01.961 --> 00:28:02.710
and in my classes.

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:04.550
We won't do it
right now, but that

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.560
gets you to look at
the stories that you're

00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:10.570
telling and believing that
cause you to create stress,

00:28:10.570 --> 00:28:13.730
and distance, and
difficulty in your life

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:15.580
and in your relationship.

00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:19.240
So staying captain
means that we have

00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:22.750
to throw the snapshot away.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:26.180
This is the child that you have.

00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:28.600
For better or worse, maybe
it's not what you expected.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:33.820
I think for most of
us, if not all of us,

00:28:33.820 --> 00:28:37.400
if we're really allowing our
child to be who they are,

00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:38.870
there's going to
be some variation

00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:42.140
between the imagination that
we had of who they might be

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.190
and their personality.

00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:45.490
Maybe you have a child
whose-- I've had sessions

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:49.280
with people on the phone who
end up sobbing within 10 minutes

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.576
because this person is a very
gentle, was very passive,

00:28:54.576 --> 00:28:59.109
as a little girl not allowed
to really be very assertive

00:28:59.109 --> 00:28:59.900
or express herself.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:03.470
And she's got this
intensely fiery 5-year-old.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:05.930
No, I'm not going to do that.

00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:07.750
You know mom just
bumps up against that.

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:11.210
Now on the one side, where
we've gotten to in our work

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.110
is, what a gift.

00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.750
This daughter is
revealing to her

00:29:14.750 --> 00:29:19.160
how she can locate within
herself her own strength,

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.340
her own will to some degree.

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:25.400
Maybe not in the clumsy and
intense way that her child is.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.740
Sometimes you're a
very intense person

00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.640
and you really are competitive,
and you love sports,

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:34.220
and you get this very gentle,
sensitive, little child.

00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:36.250
Not like you.

00:29:36.250 --> 00:29:39.410
So it's when we are stuck
on holding this image up

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:42.100
against the real child
that we lose our cool.

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:45.280
And we try and argue them
into or intimidate them

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.390
into being different
than they are.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:50.800
So that's a side piece that
helps us be the captain.

00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.184
Looking at what we're
believing our child should be.

00:29:54.184 --> 00:29:56.600
Looking at the story that we're
telling in our head of how

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.100
they should feel.

00:29:58.100 --> 00:29:59.830
He shouldn't knock
down the tower.

00:29:59.830 --> 00:30:01.480
Is it true?

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:04.300
What are three reasons why your
little boy should have knocked

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:06.490
down his brother's tower?

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:09.580
And I know, don't take that
literally, I'm not suggesting

00:30:09.580 --> 00:30:11.740
he should have knocked it down.

00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:14.090
But if we look at
that question, why

00:30:14.090 --> 00:30:18.060
does this behavior make sense?

00:30:18.060 --> 00:30:21.030
Then I'll bet we
could find why that

00:30:21.030 --> 00:30:26.550
was an obvious outcome of what
had happened in the moments

00:30:26.550 --> 00:30:29.840
or hours leading up to that.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.590
Does that make any sense to you?

00:30:32.590 --> 00:30:34.980
We look at the snapshot,
we throw it away,

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:38.970
and we meet the
child where they are.

00:30:38.970 --> 00:30:40.509
The third piece
that's so important,

00:30:40.509 --> 00:30:42.300
and I want to make sure
I cover this today,

00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:44.910
is about coming
alongside our children

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:47.610
rather than coming at them.

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:53.040
So I talk about how when
a child is frustrated,

00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.830
it's like they're on
this road of frustration.

00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:57.940
Here's the road, it's
called frustration.

00:30:57.940 --> 00:30:59.580
OK.

00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:04.050
Children are on this road
many, many times a day.

00:31:04.050 --> 00:31:05.970
They can't have the
cookie that they want.

00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:07.440
They have to go to
school and they'd rather

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.250
stay home with you.

00:31:08.250 --> 00:31:09.458
They don't want to go to bed.

00:31:09.458 --> 00:31:11.100
They don't want to
brush their teeth.

00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.435
They don't like you holding
their little brother.

00:31:13.435 --> 00:31:15.810
All kinds of things happen
where children are frustrated.

00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:18.270
So the goal of our
parenting life,

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:21.180
is not about preventing them
from ever being frustrated,

00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.790
far from it in fact.

00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.310
My position is that it's
very important for children

00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:30.030
to discover they can survive
and live through frustration.

00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:31.320
Why?

00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:34.560
How else are they going
to develop resilience?

00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:36.660
Children become
resilient because they

00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.750
know they can survive
something difficult.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.930
So our job is not to
fix everything for them,

00:31:42.930 --> 00:31:44.730
or move the universe
over to where

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:48.000
they would prefer that it be.

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.020
But it's to be that loving,
compassionate, present captain

00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.560
through the storm.

00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:58.890
So the child's on this
road of frustration,

00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:01.470
and there's only two
ways this can go.

00:32:01.470 --> 00:32:04.770
If they go this way,
in that direction,

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:06.570
they come to a fork in the road.

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.520
So there's only, when
they come to the fork,

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.360
if they go this way
they become aggressive.

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.020
I hate you.

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:14.580
You're so mean.

00:32:14.580 --> 00:32:18.180
Maybe they take it out on their
sibling, or on the family dog,

00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.030
or they, I hate myself.

00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:23.310
We see that.

00:32:23.310 --> 00:32:26.040
But if they come to the fork
in the road of frustration

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:33.450
and they go this way, the end of
that little path is adaptation.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:34.150
Acceptance.

00:32:34.150 --> 00:32:36.820
They have come to terms
with life as it is.

00:32:36.820 --> 00:32:42.150
However, it's a process
that you can help them with.

00:32:42.150 --> 00:32:46.590
So I've borrowed from the
work of Elizabeth Kubler-Ross,

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:49.530
"In Death and Dying",
because the way I see it,

00:32:49.530 --> 00:32:53.980
frustration in a
way, is like loss.

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:56.820
It may be loss of autonomy,
or freedom of choice,

00:32:56.820 --> 00:32:59.460
it may be loss of you if
they have to go to school.

00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:04.080
It may be loss of a
really good cookie.

00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:08.850
And so I work with this model
of grief, because in a way

00:33:08.850 --> 00:33:12.150
it's a small, condensed
grieving process

00:33:12.150 --> 00:33:14.340
to get through that loss.

00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:16.530
So who was an
example, does someone

00:33:16.530 --> 00:33:18.600
want to share an
example of a time

00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:22.024
when a child has
made a complaint?

00:33:22.024 --> 00:33:23.940
AUDIENCE: Actually it
just happened yesterday.

00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:28.440
My 12-year-old came home from
school with a big, sad attitude

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:29.801
and went straight to his bed.

00:33:29.801 --> 00:33:31.800
And that's very unlike
him because normally he's

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.707
very happy, positive.

00:33:33.707 --> 00:33:35.790
And I went to him and I
said, what is the problem.

00:33:35.790 --> 00:33:37.970
And he said, I can't believe it.

00:33:37.970 --> 00:33:40.290
Somebody slashed my
backpack while I left it

00:33:40.290 --> 00:33:42.900
outside the bathroom.

00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:44.070
Why would they do that?

00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:45.571
And I was, you know,
I could totally

00:33:45.571 --> 00:33:47.486
understand where he was
coming from because he

00:33:47.486 --> 00:33:48.670
felt like he was violated.

00:33:48.670 --> 00:33:49.770
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: Yes.

00:33:49.770 --> 00:33:53.400
And in that process, I'm
so sorry to hear that.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:55.260
In that process
really, I already

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:57.650
can watch you and get a sense
that you just joined him

00:33:57.650 --> 00:33:59.130
where he was.

00:33:59.130 --> 00:34:01.170
And so that's a
great example of her

00:34:01.170 --> 00:34:05.820
getting to the end of this
process, which is feeling sad.

00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.710
So if it's all
right with you, I'm

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.860
going to invent another version,
just because you already

00:34:10.860 --> 00:34:11.699
did it.

00:34:11.699 --> 00:34:12.600
OK.

00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:18.389
So let's say that your child
complains that he never, he

00:34:18.389 --> 00:34:22.469
doesn't get to watch more TV.

00:34:22.469 --> 00:34:26.370
And he really wants to
watch this one more program.

00:34:26.370 --> 00:34:27.790
OK.

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:29.310
Anybody relate to that?

00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:30.570
Just this one more program.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:34.170
Does anyone want to
play this out with me?

00:34:34.170 --> 00:34:35.460
All right, I'll just do it.

00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:40.800
So we have a shy, and
also we're on camera, so.

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:45.150
The child says to
you, mom, dad, I just

00:34:45.150 --> 00:34:46.409
want to watch one more show.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:48.254
This is a really
important episode.

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:54.655
And we'll pretend they're
aren't DVRs and all that,

00:34:54.655 --> 00:34:58.000
OK, for the purposes
of this demonstration.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:00.400
So the child, when you
say, I'm afraid not.

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:03.540
It's time to start your homework
or get ready for dinner.

00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:07.620
First goes-- on the road
to acceptance, first steps

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:09.810
into denial.

00:35:09.810 --> 00:35:13.230
Because maybe he
or she has reason

00:35:13.230 --> 00:35:15.930
to believe that you may
change your mind based

00:35:15.930 --> 00:35:18.390
on prior experiences.

00:35:18.390 --> 00:35:22.470
If I rally hard enough maybe
I'll get to watch this show.

00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:25.610
So come on, please, I just
want to watch the show.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.200
So the child's first in denial.

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:31.770
If you still say no,
then we're in anger.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:32.850
You're so mean.

00:35:32.850 --> 00:35:35.730
You never let me do anything.

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:37.410
You're so strict.

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:40.230
Jacob's parents let
him do what, I mean,

00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:42.360
he gets to watch like
five of these episodes.

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.040
You're so strict.

00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:45.764
So there's anger.

00:35:45.764 --> 00:35:48.970
You're all familiar with
what I'm talking about.

00:35:48.970 --> 00:35:52.245
Next, if we don't engage on
that level, we have bargaining.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:56.670
Please.

00:35:56.670 --> 00:35:59.250
If you just let me
watch this one episode,

00:35:59.250 --> 00:36:03.240
I promise I'll never
ask for anything again,

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:05.600
for the rest of my life.

00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:07.860
This is the only thing I want.

00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.720
I promise you.

00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:11.860
If you just let
me watch this show

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:13.034
I'll never ask for anything.

00:36:13.034 --> 00:36:13.950
I'll do all my chores.

00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:14.920
I'll feed the dog.

00:36:14.920 --> 00:36:18.280
I'll massage your
feet, whatever it is.

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.250
OK.

00:36:20.250 --> 00:36:24.850
Now if that doesn't yield the
desired outcome, we'll move on.

00:36:24.850 --> 00:36:28.650
But it's not so
easy because those

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:31.730
are invitations to go into
lawyer and dictator mode,

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:32.670
right.

00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:34.840
So your child, denial.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.030
You know he's going
to just push and push.

00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.950
Then anger.

00:36:37.950 --> 00:36:43.440
You might counter the anger with
threats or anger of your own.

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.970
If he moves into bargaining,
you may go into lawyer mode.

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:48.990
Well no, because I
know that's not true.

00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:50.670
You promised many
times before that's

00:36:50.670 --> 00:36:51.840
the only thing you wanted.

00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:55.020
And then 10 minutes later
you wanted something else.

00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.420
Well that was different
because, says your child.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.300
Because that was--
I mean listen,

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.610
you're going nowhere, fast.

00:37:02.610 --> 00:37:04.380
If you go there.

00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:07.840
These first three stages, where
there's conflict and tension,

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:09.630
I call it the DAB.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:12.750
Denial, anger, bargaining.

00:37:12.750 --> 00:37:15.610
The model is DABDA.

00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:18.700
So the first three
stages, the DAB.

00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:24.530
We perpetuate, we prolong
the misery by arguing,

00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:26.370
by threatening,
all those things.

00:37:29.010 --> 00:37:33.830
The fourth stage, which is
where the shift actually

00:37:33.830 --> 00:37:35.450
can happen-- which
is what you were

00:37:35.450 --> 00:37:39.770
talking about with your
son-- is disappointment.

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:42.810
Now, in Kubler-Ross's
model it's depression.

00:37:42.810 --> 00:37:43.880
It's the disappointment.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:49.850
It's inhabiting your sadness.

00:37:49.850 --> 00:37:52.640
It's slamming against
the truth that I am not

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:54.060
going to have what I want ted.

00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:55.650
I have to let go.

00:37:55.650 --> 00:37:59.450
For your son, it was the
truth and the sad truth,

00:37:59.450 --> 00:38:04.384
that somebody was so unkind
who he has contact with.

00:38:04.384 --> 00:38:06.300
For the child who wants
to watch another show,

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:11.330
it's the realization of
the futility of his effort.

00:38:11.330 --> 00:38:14.140
He is not going to get
to watch that show.

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:17.430
So some children
may need to cry.

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:19.940
Some kids just feel
a sinking feeling,

00:38:19.940 --> 00:38:21.810
and if you can hold
the captain place

00:38:21.810 --> 00:38:26.210
without being tempted to-- but
it's only for your own good.

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:28.160
Which is what we do.

00:38:28.160 --> 00:38:30.467
But you've gotten so mad
and you don't appreciate it.

00:38:30.467 --> 00:38:32.550
If you'd appreciate me
more, and all the hard work

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:37.770
I do, the organic food I buy,
I might feel differently.

00:38:37.770 --> 00:38:42.080
But if we stay clean,
as that captain,

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:46.600
then the child magically
moves through this process

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.590
to the final step,
which is acceptance.

00:38:48.590 --> 00:38:52.830
They make peace
with life as it is.

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:56.000
They come to terms with it.

00:38:56.000 --> 00:39:00.725
And we have not fractured or
compromised the relationship.

00:39:00.725 --> 00:39:02.770
Does that makes sense?

00:39:02.770 --> 00:39:04.530
This is not easy
because when we have

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:08.930
a child every bone in our
body wants them to be happy.

00:39:08.930 --> 00:39:11.520
So if a child is unhappy or
complaining, a lot of times

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.170
we go down here because we
feel a desperate need for them

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:17.280
to like us, or to
feel happy again.

00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:22.520
So we change the world to suit
them because they don't-- we

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.374
don't like witnessing
them being unhappy.

00:39:25.374 --> 00:39:27.290
And I'm not saying you
never change your mind.

00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:29.810
By the way, here's
the back door.

00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:32.770
Let's say that
you're super tired.

00:39:32.770 --> 00:39:36.350
Would you like an out,
a loophole for this?

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:39.860
Let's say you're really
tired and your tradition

00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:46.580
is that you read two
bedtime stories at night.

00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:49.270
And you've read your two
stories and your child's like,

00:39:49.270 --> 00:39:50.850
of please can I
have a third story?

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:52.520
And they haven't
yet lost their mind

00:39:52.520 --> 00:39:54.270
or they're not being awful.

00:39:54.270 --> 00:39:56.450
They just would really
like another story.

00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:58.724
And in your mind you kind
of weigh the pros and cons.

00:39:58.724 --> 00:40:00.890
Do I want to do this thing
that Susan Stiffelman was

00:40:00.890 --> 00:40:06.810
talking about, or do I just
want to get this over with.

00:40:06.810 --> 00:40:10.790
So, remember I just want
you to be the captain.

00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:12.872
So if they're being
reasonable, and you

00:40:12.872 --> 00:40:14.580
think it might be
quicker and easier just

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:18.540
to read an extra story, you
know what you get to say?

00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:21.170
Oh my gosh, you must
be a mind reader,

00:40:21.170 --> 00:40:24.620
I was about to suggest
we read another story.

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:26.310
That's amazing.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:28.730
Or they want the other cookie.

00:40:28.730 --> 00:40:31.310
How did you, how
did you know I was

00:40:31.310 --> 00:40:33.910
about to ask if you
wanted another cookie?

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:36.792
So you make it your idea.

00:40:36.792 --> 00:40:38.042
And you still hold that place.

00:40:38.042 --> 00:40:40.330
That loving place.

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:43.434
So I know that we have
just a few minutes,

00:40:43.434 --> 00:40:44.850
and I want to take
some questions.

00:40:44.850 --> 00:40:47.480
But I wanted to
sort of tie this up

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.580
with the last piece that
goes into being the captain

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:52.310
just briefly.

00:40:52.310 --> 00:40:56.420
When we come at our children,
you can't watch that show,

00:40:56.420 --> 00:40:59.360
it's a scary movie,
you're too young,

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.670
what do we get from them?

00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:09.490
Push back, resistance, right,
we can move into that anger.

00:41:09.490 --> 00:41:14.110
When we come alongside them with
what I call Act One parenting,

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:18.130
then we help the child
feel understood, validated,

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.670
and they soften.

00:41:19.670 --> 00:41:24.560
And there's the guard comes
down, the walls come down,

00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:25.670
there's a receptivity.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:27.620
And we use Act One
with what I just

00:41:27.620 --> 00:41:30.680
taught you with helping
the child feel sadness.

00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:32.870
So here's an example.

00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:38.270
The child says, I hate
my school and I never

00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:39.990
want to go back to
that stupid school.

00:41:39.990 --> 00:41:40.670
I hate it.

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:44.245
They come home from school
and say that to you.

00:41:44.245 --> 00:41:46.970
Most of us do what I
call Act Two parenting.

00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:50.690
We appeal to the child's left,
logical, rational, language

00:41:50.690 --> 00:41:53.390
based brain.

00:41:53.390 --> 00:41:58.470
Even though when they're upset
they don't have one of those.

00:41:58.470 --> 00:42:00.835
And I know I'm
oversimplifying, but Dan Siegel

00:42:00.835 --> 00:42:02.960
reassured me a couple of
weeks ago that I can still

00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:05.334
talk about the brain as having
these different functions,

00:42:05.334 --> 00:42:06.890
so I'm comforted by that.

00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:12.620
So we appeal to them with
rational, logical arguments

00:42:12.620 --> 00:42:14.840
to talk them out
of their position.

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:17.030
Does that work?

00:42:17.030 --> 00:42:17.864
No.

00:42:17.864 --> 00:42:20.280
Not when they're already upset
because when they're upset,

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.810
they're over here in there
feeling, emotional brain.

00:42:23.810 --> 00:42:25.610
That's where we
need to join them.

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:28.580
We do that with what I
call Act One parenting.

00:42:28.580 --> 00:42:31.940
Act One parenting
allows the child

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:38.030
to be where he is, stays the
captain, we stay the captain.

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:40.340
We aren't wordy.

00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:42.072
Most of us say way
too many words,

00:42:42.072 --> 00:42:44.280
and I'm convinced kids tune
us out after about seven.

00:42:47.120 --> 00:42:54.470
And we acknowledge briefly,
I call it comic book lingo,

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:58.370
like oh, shoot, boy.

00:42:58.370 --> 00:43:00.360
Pow, bam, kaboom.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:00.860
OK.

00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:04.770
So we're minimalists
when it comes to words.

00:43:04.770 --> 00:43:06.440
But we're empathic.

00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:09.210
And most important, and
this is a little formulaic,

00:43:09.210 --> 00:43:12.410
we look to help the
child nod his head

00:43:12.410 --> 00:43:16.250
or say yes at least three times.

00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:17.750
So that it defuses.

00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:19.700
Wow, you're actually hearing me.

00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.040
Not like, you're angry.

00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:23.960
Because I would never
presume to decide

00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:25.580
I know what someone
else is feeling.

00:43:25.580 --> 00:43:28.400
So please don't attribute
that approach to me

00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.560
because I don't
believe it's our right

00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:33.790
to decide how someone is feeling
and announce it as if we know.

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:37.370
But we could say it sounds
like, I get the feeling that, it

00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:39.860
seems as though.

00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:42.590
So let me demonstrate
this and then I'd

00:43:42.590 --> 00:43:43.790
love to take some questions.

00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:46.652
Is there anyone brave who
has an issue, a child who's

00:43:46.652 --> 00:43:48.110
complained about
something and they

00:43:48.110 --> 00:43:51.030
want to play this out with me?

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:54.500
All right, so you're
my-- how old are you?

00:43:54.500 --> 00:43:55.552
Ho old do you want to be?

00:43:55.552 --> 00:43:56.635
SPEAKER 1: Eight-year-old.

00:43:56.635 --> 00:43:58.176
SUSAN STIFFELMAN:
Eight year old, OK.

00:43:58.176 --> 00:44:00.660
So you're my eight-year-old
and what's your complaint?

00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:02.720
First I'm going to
demonstrate Act Two, which

00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:05.120
is what I don't want you
to do but you will probably

00:44:05.120 --> 00:44:08.041
intuitively do because that's
how most of us were raised.

00:44:08.041 --> 00:44:08.540
OK.

00:44:08.540 --> 00:44:11.140
What's your complaint?

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:13.070
Here.

00:44:13.070 --> 00:44:15.410
SPEAKER 1: You spend all the
time with my little brother

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:17.264
and you don't spend
any time with me.

00:44:17.264 --> 00:44:18.805
SUSAN STIFFELMAN:
Can you stand here.

00:44:18.805 --> 00:44:19.220
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:21.230
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: That's
ridiculous, honey.

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:25.190
I'm knocking on her left
with, that's your left right?

00:44:25.190 --> 00:44:26.330
That's ridiculous.

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:30.860
I played My Little Pony with you
for like two hours yesterday.

00:44:30.860 --> 00:44:33.042
And he was wanting my attention.

00:44:33.042 --> 00:44:35.000
SPEAKER 1: But today you
didn't spend any time.

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.020
SUSAN STIFFELMAN:
Today because we

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:37.394
had to go to the
doctor's office,

00:44:37.394 --> 00:44:40.640
and I had to take that--
I'm right here with you.

00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:41.430
I'm here.

00:44:41.430 --> 00:44:42.470
SPEAKER 1: Mommy.

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.870
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: OK.

00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:44.078
So how's this feeling to you?

00:44:44.078 --> 00:44:46.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:44:46.030 --> 00:44:47.150
Very disconnecting.

00:44:47.150 --> 00:44:47.380
SPEAKER 1: Very disconnecting.

00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:49.255
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: I'm
disputing, I'm arguing,

00:44:49.255 --> 00:44:50.750
I'm invalidating, right.

00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:53.420
So can you all relate to that?

00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.310
There's almost an
urgency that we feel.

00:44:55.310 --> 00:44:57.680
Like, let me just quickly
talk to you off the ledge.

00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.710
Let me quickly talk you
out of what you're feeling.

00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:03.320
And I seem to believe,
for whatever reason,

00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:07.250
largely how we were raised,
that the quickest route to that

00:45:07.250 --> 00:45:10.070
is to convince your left,
logical brain to think

00:45:10.070 --> 00:45:10.850
differently.

00:45:10.850 --> 00:45:12.750
It just doesn't work.

00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:14.960
By the way, I've done
this same program

00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:20.170
for businesses, and employee
relationships, and couples.

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:22.460
I mean this is not just
confined to the parent child

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:24.770
relationship, this dynamic.

00:45:24.770 --> 00:45:27.510
But we know that
that didn't go over.

00:45:27.510 --> 00:45:29.660
Did you all relate?

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:32.330
OK, so now I'm going
to model Act One.

00:45:32.330 --> 00:45:35.120
You may see me in this
Act One demonstration,

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.650
guiding her to some
sadness, through that DABDA.

00:45:37.650 --> 00:45:38.150
OK.

00:45:38.150 --> 00:45:38.840
Ready.

00:45:38.840 --> 00:45:40.547
So make the same complaint.

00:45:40.547 --> 00:45:42.880
SPEAKER 1: You always spend
time with my little brother,

00:45:42.880 --> 00:45:45.117
but no time with me, mommy.

00:45:45.117 --> 00:45:47.450
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: So now in
my mind I might be thinking,

00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:49.477
that is so far from the truth.

00:45:49.477 --> 00:45:50.810
But here's what I'm going to do.

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:53.572
So it seems like you
feel short changed.

00:45:56.740 --> 00:45:59.580
And like your brother's been
getting more time than--

00:45:59.580 --> 00:46:01.480
SPEAKER 1: Yes.

00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:03.820
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: And I
wonder if you kind of miss me.

00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:04.750
SPEAKER 1: I do.

00:46:04.750 --> 00:46:07.470
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:11.600
I'm so glad you told me.

00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:14.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.920
And of course it's not
always that tidy and simple.

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:18.410
But how was that for you?

00:46:18.410 --> 00:46:20.220
SPEAKER 1: I felt
more connected.

00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:20.882
That you care.

00:46:20.882 --> 00:46:21.840
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: Yeah.

00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.730
I'm not arguing her
out of her position.

00:46:23.730 --> 00:46:26.760
Now, there's so many
ways this could go.

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:31.920
It might be that I find out that
it's not really sadly about me

00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:34.080
at all and my fabulousness.

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:38.560
But really that her friends left
her to eat by herself at lunch.

00:46:38.560 --> 00:46:39.060
Right.

00:46:39.060 --> 00:46:42.810
If I make room for her to
feel or express herself

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:46.390
safely, and tell me, is
there more to that, honey.

00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:49.800
Is there more about that
you want me to know?

00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.260
SPEAKER 1: Yeah I feel
really alone these days

00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:54.774
because there's no
friends at school.

00:46:54.774 --> 00:46:56.940
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: Now in
my left brain I'm thinking,

00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:58.398
I picked her up
and saw her playing

00:46:58.398 --> 00:47:01.410
with seven people
on the playground.

00:47:01.410 --> 00:47:03.690
So the temptation is
very great to say,

00:47:03.690 --> 00:47:05.160
what are you talking about.

00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:07.743
The typical thing would be, but
I saw you with da, da, da, da.

00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:12.990
And instead, I joined
her where she is.

00:47:12.990 --> 00:47:16.610
So it feels like you're
just on your own a lot, huh?

00:47:16.610 --> 00:47:19.860
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, no friends.

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:23.030
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: That
doesn't sound fun.

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.820
Is there anything that
you think you want

00:47:25.820 --> 00:47:29.120
me to help you with about that?

00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.965
SPEAKER 1: I'd like to
have a play date with Ella.

00:47:31.965 --> 00:47:34.090
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: I wonder
if we could set that up.

00:47:34.090 --> 00:47:36.250
So there's a possible,
I've empowered

00:47:36.250 --> 00:47:39.450
her to be a participant
in solving it.

00:47:39.450 --> 00:47:40.210
Thank you.

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:41.230
That was good.

00:47:41.230 --> 00:47:47.870
It may also be that
she just has to cry.

00:47:47.870 --> 00:47:50.140
That maybe she's going
through a rough patch with all

00:47:50.140 --> 00:47:51.530
of her friends.

00:47:51.530 --> 00:47:54.940
It may be, not that this
would be for your child,

00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:58.350
that she's not being
a very nice friend.

00:47:58.350 --> 00:48:00.400
And she's been very
bossy or very controlling

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:03.440
of the other kids and so
she's getting honest feedback.

00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:06.820
But I want to know that
because I'm the captain

00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:10.200
and there may be a leak
in the hull of my ship.

00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:12.880
And if I make everything
glossed over and perfect,

00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:15.130
that I only want to
hear the good stuff,

00:48:15.130 --> 00:48:19.090
I really can't
effectively parent.

00:48:19.090 --> 00:48:25.090
So all these things are
interplaying with each other

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:28.120
to be that loving, present,
captain of the ship.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.630
And in the process, this is
what I said at the beginning,

00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:33.490
we get to heal.

00:48:33.490 --> 00:48:38.440
Our unfinished business that
looms its angry face sometimes

00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:41.140
when we feel disrespected,
or overwhelmed, or confused,

00:48:41.140 --> 00:48:44.314
or sad, or maybe I was that
child that had no friends.

00:48:44.314 --> 00:48:46.480
And now I'm going to jump
through hoops to make sure

00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.054
that, by gosh, every
child on the playground

00:48:49.054 --> 00:48:50.470
plays with my
daughter, so I don't

00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:54.820
have to reactivate my own
pain of loneliness as a child.

00:48:54.820 --> 00:48:56.320
Not a healthy way to go.

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:57.820
I work through my
own material, I

00:48:57.820 --> 00:49:00.630
support my child with the
resources that she has.

00:49:00.630 --> 00:49:03.100
She's a different person.

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.740
So it's a pretty
magnificent process.

00:49:05.740 --> 00:49:11.994
And I as I said, just feel
overjoyed to have landed

00:49:11.994 --> 00:49:13.660
in what feels like
the work I'm supposed

00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:17.020
to do and have met so
many amazing parents

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.100
around the world.

00:49:19.100 --> 00:49:21.610
Even the online community,
I have a Facebook group,

00:49:21.610 --> 00:49:25.410
and I have, I'm supposed to
say I have this newsletter.

00:49:25.410 --> 00:49:27.220
You said I was
going to say this,

00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:29.580
if you'd like to stay in
touch with the work I'm doing

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:32.530
please send a text message.

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:34.030
I'll just give you
this phone number

00:49:34.030 --> 00:49:36.550
with the word newsletter in it.

00:49:36.550 --> 00:49:43.470
It's 310-905-8165.

00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:47.800
310-905-8165.

00:49:47.800 --> 00:49:51.460
And you can be part of
our movement, our tribe.

00:49:51.460 --> 00:49:53.090
We're doing so many
interesting things.

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:57.640
The next program coming up is on
co-parenting with a narcissist.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.710
Very, very interesting.

00:49:58.710 --> 00:50:02.320
With a woman who wrote, she's
a highly respected expert

00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:04.376
in the field, Wendy
Behary, called

00:50:04.376 --> 00:50:05.500
"Disarming the Narcissist."

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:07.630
But we do all kinds
of parenting programs

00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:10.420
online so that we can
reach people remotely, just

00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.110
as we're doing today.

00:50:12.110 --> 00:50:15.250
So who has a question
that they'd like to ask?

00:50:15.250 --> 00:50:18.760
AUDIENCE: So we have a
kid one year, four months.

00:50:18.760 --> 00:50:21.160
And so do you have any
tips for how to communicate

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.572
with kids who don't talk yet?

00:50:22.572 --> 00:50:23.530
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: Sure.

00:50:23.530 --> 00:50:24.654
So you have a one-year-old.

00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:25.540
So it's pre-verbal.

00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:27.280
So some of the things
I'm talking about

00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:29.530
aren't quite
relevant to you yet.

00:50:29.530 --> 00:50:31.900
They will be if you
blink about five times.

00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.730
That's how fast it changes.

00:50:33.730 --> 00:50:35.740
So it's great that
you're learning now.

00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:38.740
In fact I want to do more
work with expectant parents

00:50:38.740 --> 00:50:41.170
because they have more
time to actually start

00:50:41.170 --> 00:50:46.120
learning new approaches, and
then they can be more prepared.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:50.360
With a young child, a lot of the
work I do tends to do with you,

00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:53.350
so that as you start
to feel overwhelmed,

00:50:53.350 --> 00:50:55.540
or stuff starts getting
triggered for you,

00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:57.670
have the resources
to kind of look

00:50:57.670 --> 00:51:00.190
at your own side
of the equation.

00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:03.670
And then with a toddler,
you'll be doing a micro,

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:06.300
like a very simplified
version of some of this.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.944
Like I love Harvey
Karp, who talks

00:51:08.944 --> 00:51:14.170
about when a toddler
really wants something,

00:51:14.170 --> 00:51:15.420
that you don't get real wordy.

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:18.730
That you match
about 30% of affect.

00:51:18.730 --> 00:51:22.050
You want, you want,
you want to go outside.

00:51:22.050 --> 00:51:27.280
So you can meet your child on
a very primal, simple level.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.330
Even though the verbal
processing may not be,

00:51:30.330 --> 00:51:34.500
they may not be able
to perfectly translate.

00:51:34.500 --> 00:51:35.510
They'll get the feeling.

00:51:35.510 --> 00:51:38.160
And so you acknowledge
them in that way,

00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.945
and prepare yourself
for what's to come.

00:51:41.945 --> 00:51:44.570
AUDIENCE: One of the things that
happens in our house sometimes

00:51:44.570 --> 00:51:48.410
is they'll ask for,
one of my two daughters

00:51:48.410 --> 00:51:50.690
will ask for something
like, another dessert,

00:51:50.690 --> 00:51:52.640
or more screen time,
or something like that.

00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:53.840
And we'll say, no.

00:51:53.840 --> 00:51:55.400
And then they'll say, why.

00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:58.160
Which is, I think
a real invitation

00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:01.430
to go into lawyer mode
there, so what do you think

00:52:01.430 --> 00:52:03.480
is a good approaches
to handle that.

00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:03.750
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: Great.

00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:04.760
I love the question.

00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:06.830
A lot of times when
you have established

00:52:06.830 --> 00:52:11.600
that something is not an
option, the child will say, why.

00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:17.720
And I want you to get this,
it's code for, I really want it.

00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:20.310
It's not, why.

00:52:20.310 --> 00:52:22.280
You're just getting
confused because you

00:52:22.280 --> 00:52:24.530
think that the word part
of a child's message

00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:26.150
is actually their message.

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:27.590
That is not the case.

00:52:27.590 --> 00:52:29.870
When a child is feeling
a lot of feelings

00:52:29.870 --> 00:52:31.460
there's this gauzy
wrapping paper

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:33.802
that they wrap around
the emotional content

00:52:33.802 --> 00:52:35.720
of what's going on for them.

00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:40.730
And they deliver this gauzy
wrapped up thing, a feeling,

00:52:40.730 --> 00:52:43.470
and the gauzy wrapping paper is
the word part of the message.

00:52:43.470 --> 00:52:45.390
It is not the message.

00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:48.330
And so, there will
be times, however,

00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:50.550
when your child is calm,
respectful, and says,

00:52:50.550 --> 00:52:52.530
I really want to know why.

00:52:52.530 --> 00:52:54.960
And you can say, are you sure?

00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.830
Do you want to know why
you can't have the dessert,

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:00.800
or is this your way of saying,
I really want the dessert.

00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:02.870
I would just ask her.

00:53:02.870 --> 00:53:03.800
Get it clear.

00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:07.430
I'm not sure if you're
saying, that you genuinely

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:09.830
want my rational reasons,
or if this is just

00:53:09.830 --> 00:53:13.015
another version of, I so
desperately want that dessert.

00:53:13.015 --> 00:53:15.140
Tell me which it is.

00:53:15.140 --> 00:53:17.450
Now I will also point
out that in my work,

00:53:17.450 --> 00:53:19.940
I don't suggest that
you keep saying,

00:53:19.940 --> 00:53:22.340
I know you really want the
dessert but you can't have it.

00:53:22.340 --> 00:53:24.436
I know it's really
good, but I told you no.

00:53:24.436 --> 00:53:26.810
I know that you really want
more dessert but in our house

00:53:26.810 --> 00:53:28.010
you only get one.

00:53:28.010 --> 00:53:30.934
If you keep reiterating
the no, first of all,

00:53:30.934 --> 00:53:32.100
it's like salt in the wound.

00:53:32.100 --> 00:53:34.270
It's kind of mean.

00:53:34.270 --> 00:53:37.010
But it also disempowers you.

00:53:37.010 --> 00:53:38.990
Because if you know
what-- and this

00:53:38.990 --> 00:53:41.990
is why many parenting issues,
when I do work with my members,

00:53:41.990 --> 00:53:44.000
a lot of it is just
helping parents

00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.290
become more clear and decisive.

00:53:46.290 --> 00:53:50.510
When you're clear,
you have an aroma.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:54.420
And that's the captain thing.

00:53:54.420 --> 00:53:57.770
And so you may need
to get super clear,

00:53:57.770 --> 00:54:00.350
but once you're clear don't,
keep saying, no you can't.

00:54:00.350 --> 00:54:01.730
But here's why, but no.

00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:04.250
You said it once, it's already
established in your house,

00:54:04.250 --> 00:54:05.480
I wouldn't even touch it.

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.960
I know you really
want the dessert.

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:12.276
I know it doesn't seem fair.

00:54:12.276 --> 00:54:13.650
Not, I know it
doesn't seem fair,

00:54:13.650 --> 00:54:16.020
but we don't half second
desserts in our house.

00:54:16.020 --> 00:54:18.600
Does that makes sense to you?

00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:21.160
AUDIENCE: So my
nine-year-old daughter,

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:24.780
she is really addicted to
Nintendo console games.

00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:28.340
So when she's not
playing, she is

00:54:28.340 --> 00:54:30.530
trying to get on
to YouTube to watch

00:54:30.530 --> 00:54:32.630
other people play all the time.

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:35.340
So I'm thinking
about, maybe I should,

00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:37.610
because myself I have
no interest in the games

00:54:37.610 --> 00:54:41.720
at all, so I'm thinking
about maybe I should consider

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.640
playing with her.

00:54:43.640 --> 00:54:47.420
To be more attached with her
in terms of this interest,

00:54:47.420 --> 00:54:49.802
do you think that's a
good way to resolve that?

00:54:49.802 --> 00:54:52.010
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: It's a
really interesting question.

00:54:52.010 --> 00:54:55.370
I just did it this year, it's
still on susanstiffelman.com,

00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:59.080
you can still get that
wonderful series on parenting

00:54:59.080 --> 00:55:00.920
in the digital age.

00:55:00.920 --> 00:55:04.520
And it's a huge topic
for me that I've

00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:07.540
been writing, and thinking,
and teaching about.

00:55:07.540 --> 00:55:11.780
And that question
is a tangled one.

00:55:11.780 --> 00:55:16.640
I would prefer that you find an
interest that doesn't involve

00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:19.794
parallel looking at a screen.

00:55:19.794 --> 00:55:23.380
More contact, more real
life, 3-D engagement.

00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:24.930
That's what I would prefer.

00:55:24.930 --> 00:55:27.910
Now, I'm not saying this is
at all true for your daughter.

00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:31.130
There are children for
instance on the spectrum,

00:55:31.130 --> 00:55:33.250
with some degree of
autism or Aspergers,

00:55:33.250 --> 00:55:35.800
where that is a very
effective way and perhaps

00:55:35.800 --> 00:55:37.840
the easiest way to connect.

00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:41.510
And there are children
who are depressed,

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:43.330
and again this is
not your daughter,

00:55:43.330 --> 00:55:46.060
but I have, when
I've done my classes,

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:49.390
when we start to work with
helping kids sort of wean

00:55:49.390 --> 00:55:53.470
off unlimited amounts
of time on the screen.

00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:58.510
It's often a mask or cover up
for anxiety and depression.

00:55:58.510 --> 00:56:01.330
And I would want to
rule that out that,

00:56:01.330 --> 00:56:05.710
that she is able to function
and enjoy the world.

00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:07.660
Because otherwise
it's just covering up

00:56:07.660 --> 00:56:12.070
another issue, which sadly
is true for many children.

00:56:12.070 --> 00:56:16.000
Many kids, that's the only time
they feel good, or relaxed,

00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:17.560
or safe.

00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:22.150
And then finally,
it's a process.

00:56:22.150 --> 00:56:25.180
You would need to be clear
about what the limits are.

00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:28.300
But I guess my shorter, coming
back to the original answer

00:56:28.300 --> 00:56:30.700
would be, I wouldn't
mind her teaching

00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:34.450
you a little bit about the
game, as an entry point.

00:56:34.450 --> 00:56:37.187
But I guess I would
prefer that you

00:56:37.187 --> 00:56:39.520
think outside the box with
something really interesting.

00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.630
Maybe as an offshoot.

00:56:40.630 --> 00:56:42.520
Maybe drawing
Nintendo characters,

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:44.890
or building them
out of something

00:56:44.890 --> 00:56:47.500
that's a little more 3-D.

00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:49.570
AUDIENCE: Actually,
she did try to teach me

00:56:49.570 --> 00:56:52.793
but I guess I did not
meet her expectation.

00:56:52.793 --> 00:56:54.552
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:54.552 --> 00:56:56.510
SUSAN STIFFELMAN: Well
that's good information.

00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:58.801
It's not your thing and you
can be very honest with her

00:56:58.801 --> 00:57:00.310
and say, here's the truth.

00:57:00.310 --> 00:57:03.730
I love authenticity with our
kids, they love the truth

00:57:03.730 --> 00:57:05.260
and they smell it anyway.

00:57:05.260 --> 00:57:09.430
Sweetheart, I'm wanting
to connect with you more.

00:57:09.430 --> 00:57:11.300
I was thinking maybe
I would try Nintendo,

00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:16.150
but clearly it's just
not in my wheel house.

00:57:16.150 --> 00:57:18.010
Here's a big pad of
paper, let's just

00:57:18.010 --> 00:57:20.380
together write all the
things we love doing

00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:22.810
and see where
there's some overlap.

00:57:22.810 --> 00:57:25.240
And make that an activity,
a bonding activity,

00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:28.570
to do with her to come up
with ideas of other things

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.471
that you could do.

00:57:30.471 --> 00:57:32.220
It could be digging
holes in the backyard,

00:57:32.220 --> 00:57:33.760
I don't care what it is.

00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:36.356
Could be a worm farm.

00:57:36.356 --> 00:57:36.855
OK.

00:57:36.855 --> 00:57:39.130
I guess that's it,
we need to wrap up.

00:57:39.130 --> 00:57:43.540
Thank you all for
tuning in and listening.

00:57:43.540 --> 00:57:46.630
Thank you so much, Rutika,
for hosting this event

00:57:46.630 --> 00:57:50.470
and I look forward to staying
in touch with all of you.

00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:51.550
SPEAKER 1: Thank you.

00:57:51.550 --> 00:57:53.050
Thank you, Susan for coming.

00:57:53.050 --> 00:57:57.600
[APPLAUSE]
