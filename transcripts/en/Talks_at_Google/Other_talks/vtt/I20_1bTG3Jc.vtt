KRISHNA: Hi, Googlers
and YouTubers.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.080
Google is delighted to welcome
Professor Prasad Kaipa and

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.490
Navi Radjou to Talks at Google
and the Google speaker series

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.350
here in Hyderabad.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.650
For most of us in India,
I think jugaad

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.700
is a part of life.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.380
I think a lot of us growing
up have done lots

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.369
of jugaads in life.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.020
And when we need do, we
know how to do it.

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.100
Navi has taken this concept
global with his hugely

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.425
successful book called "Jugaad
Innovation: Think Frugal, Be

00:00:42.425 --> 00:00:50.560
Flexible, Generate Breakthrough
Growth."

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.780
And he has helped the West
understand what we know

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.940
intuitively, which is bottoms
up approach to innovation.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.522
Navi is a fellow at the Judge
Business School, University of

00:01:02.522 --> 00:01:05.830
Cambridge, and a thought leader
and strategy consultant

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.900
to many Fortune 500 companies on
innovation and leadership.

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.440
I went to the Indian School
of Business a

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.870
couple of years ago.

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.556
And I had the good fortune to
attend a lecture Professor

00:01:18.556 --> 00:01:21.660
Prasad Kaipa gave there.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.110
And he spoke about bringing
Eastern wisdom perspectives to

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.380
business management
and leadership.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.220
I remember walking out of that
talk inspired and thinking

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.150
that was about the time that
management theory, which was

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.630
generally dominated by Western
thought, needed an Eastern

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.096
perspective.

00:01:43.096 --> 00:01:47.500
And Professor Kaipa coaches a
number of CEOs and top leaders

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.230
at Fortune 500 companies.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.888
And he is also the creator of
the Centre for Innovation,

00:01:50.888 --> 00:01:57.100
Leadership and Change at the
Indian School of Business.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.395
He also takes practical
Vedanta classes in San

00:02:00.395 --> 00:02:02.630
Francisco on Thursday evenings,
and I think that's

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.750
something, when I'm there, I'm
going to try and attend.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.069
Together, they have co-authored
a new book, "From

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.670
Smart to Wise." And it is our
privilege today to hear from

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.040
them in person, their thoughts
and perspectives on

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.270
leadership.

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.006
Please give a warm Google
welcome to Professor Prasad

00:02:21.006 --> 00:02:22.640
Kaipa and Navi Radjou.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.624
Thank you.

00:02:23.624 --> 00:02:29.036
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:29.036 --> 00:02:31.460
PRASAD KAIPA: Thank
you very much.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:35.000
It's a great pleasure
to be in Google.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.030
I have been in Mountain View.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.500
I have been in your Singapore.

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.830
And I have been in,
now, Hyderabad.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.440
What seems to be common is,
number one, energy.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.890
There is a certain vibrancy in
just the culture, environment.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:58.690
There is a certain speed with
which you resonate.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.010
And I think, third thing which I
also find is, there is a lot

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.050
of smiling faces, which
is uncommon.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.296
I'm actually puzzled.

00:03:07.296 --> 00:03:09.865
You know, are you laughing
with me, or are

00:03:09.865 --> 00:03:10.650
you laughing at me?

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.850
I don't know yet.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:19.110
But it is really great, on a
Friday afternoon, to help

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.110
people with a lot of smiles.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.230
Two reasons.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.370
One, as Krishna was mentioning,
the wisdom seems

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.940
to be an area where we have
a lot to say about.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.240
In India, you know,
we are the source

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.590
of five major religions.

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.640
But at the same time, many times
our approach to managing

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.100
each other, managing oneself,
is more Western than even

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.570
Westerners deal with.

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.086
In some respects, it's like
we have a schism.

00:03:54.086 --> 00:03:58.220
During the daytime, we operate
in a Western way.

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.290
But the moment the office hours
are over, the bhangra

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.700
and the dancing and the fun
starts, and the prayers and

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:11.670
the various other activities and
the rare festivals and the

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.850
work and the life and the fun
seamlessly integrate.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.690
That one continuous integrity
that seems to be the source of

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.740
energy, source of rejuvenation,
source of fun,

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.830
is something that gives meaning,
that gives purpose,

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.185
and that evokes passion for
us to be innovative,

00:04:37.185 --> 00:04:39.670
for us to be ingenuous.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.720
How do we tap into that, what is
the source of that, is the

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.470
question which has been, really,
in my mind from the

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.650
time I quit Apple Computer.

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:54.096
I was in Apple in international
marketing for a

00:04:54.096 --> 00:04:55.610
while in 1980s.

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.050
I was in Apple University.

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.360
I was the head of school of
technology and management in

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.110
Apple University.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.690
And I was a research fellow
looking at future directions

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.500
in how people learn, how people
think, how people

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.680
create, how people relate,
how people lead.

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:13.890
So this was in 1988, 89.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.470
With a friend and partner called
Bill Atkinson and more

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.520
of a guidance from Alan Kay, we
began to think about how do

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.180
we actually design tools that
augment human intelligence.

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.600
I found out, after actually
spending a large amount of

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.070
time investigating, inquiring,
and interviewing about 200

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:38.390
extraordinary people,
including many Nobel

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:42.530
laureates, brain researchers,
spiritual leaders,

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.020
psychologists, sports
personalities.

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.445
We came back, and we tried to
see whether we could create a

00:05:49.445 --> 00:05:52.970
prologue or artificial
intelligence systems to

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:57.970
capture some of what makes
people energized, what makes

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.595
people creative, what
makes people learn.

00:06:00.595 --> 00:06:06.350
None of them worked, because we
found out we can scale up

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.170
mechanically elements
of human ingenuity.

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:15.770
But what truly differentiates
each one from anybody else,

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:19.540
what truly differentiates our
own innovation, our own

00:06:19.540 --> 00:06:23.430
approach to life, how we
contribute and how we

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:23.810
[INAUDIBLE]

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.940
become our own brands
is not easy to scale

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.840
it up in that way.

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:32.950
I'm sure you guys well
may prove me wrong.

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.220
That is what I think in
more ways than one.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:38.330
From 20 years ago to now,
I see a lot of things I

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.500
thought-- these are not
algorithmic, or they are not

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.135
possible to be scaled up--

00:06:44.135 --> 00:06:48.580
I think Google has done a
significant increase in it.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.190
So at that time, we realized
there is something called

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.460
learning that leads to
innovation and learning that

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.090
leads to wisdom.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.810
One will allow us to do
a lot of things in

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.640
the external world.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:07.090
One will give us a sense of
peace, happiness, serenity and

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.090
equanimity to deal with
the external crisis.

00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:13.540
These two are front of the
hand, back of the hand.

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.380
So when I quit Apple, I
thought I will do user

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.430
interface design.

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.470
That's where I thought I'll
get the consulting.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.890
But instead, we started getting
opportunities to do

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:26.750
leadership development
and develop

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:29.000
adult education programs.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.880
23 years later, when this book
came out, we realized what we

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.100
needed to document was some
good stories on how

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.980
extraordinary people perform.

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.750
And then, how smartness can
help us and hurt us.

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:48.140
What are the differences
in smartness?

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:51.450
Some people are great in
becoming domain experts,

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:56.070
functional smart people who like
to stay within their box

00:07:56.070 --> 00:08:00.830
and go deep down as a hedgehog
and become somebody world

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:04.350
renowned in their field of
expertise but are unwilling to

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:08.240
take risks, but are unwilling
to look outside the box and

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.060
have entrepreneurial sense.

00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.310
On the other side, there are
people who are willing to jump

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.970
from one to another to another,
connect the dots, and

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:22.400
go broadly, but always need help
in executing to go deep

00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:26.110
beneath the functional
smart people.

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:29.380
So for anything to be
successful, we need some

00:08:29.380 --> 00:08:32.360
people who are great in
execution, some people who are

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:35.010
great in business thinking,
if you want to call it.

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.780
Together, they can
bring success.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.659
We've looked at it and said, why
do people keep on going on

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:42.930
one end of the spectrum?

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:46.090
We call it the blue end of the
spectrum, being the functional

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:50.100
smart, red end of the spectrum
being the business smart.

00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:55.870
In between is the freedom,
is the place of wisdom.

00:08:55.870 --> 00:08:59.870
And that is what we have
been investigating.

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:05.805
We interviewed people like Alan
Mulally of Ford, or Indra

00:09:05.805 --> 00:09:11.200
Nooyi, or Sam Palmisano of IBM,
and John Mackey of Whole

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:16.165
Foods, in India, Narayana Murthy
of Infosys or Kiran

00:09:16.165 --> 00:09:18.735
Mazumdar of Biocon.

00:09:18.735 --> 00:09:21.990
And there are several people
in Tata Group.

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:25.030
So we began to look at,
essentially, the story between

00:09:25.030 --> 00:09:26.780
the West and the East.

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:31.630
It is like it's a book written
combining the wisdom of India

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:34.730
and the wisdom of the United
States, a lot more.

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.620
So based on those interviews,
we came up with

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.770
a very simple framework.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.970
If you put it as an acronym,
to make it

00:09:41.970 --> 00:09:43.220
easy, we call it wisdom.

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.540
In this book, we talk about
those six elements which are

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.650
represented by each letter of
the acronym, working and

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:58.130
acting with authenticity
and appropriateness.

00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:03.400
Looks like oxymoron, but we need
both of them to be wise--

00:10:03.400 --> 00:10:06.310
intelligent and flexible
fortitude--

00:10:06.310 --> 00:10:09.270
once you take on a project,
how long you stay with it,

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.473
when do you let go, when do you
hold on, when do you move

00:10:12.473 --> 00:10:16.480
on, which requires certain
discernment.

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.900
Shifting the perspective
from what I want

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.460
to what others want--

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:25.830
because these days of social
network, these days of how we

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:28.240
are interconnected, Google+--

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:31.020
when you look at it, it is not
what you do it that makes a

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:34.360
difference but how many people
like what you do.

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.330
And they amplify it, multiply
it, and begin to do something

00:10:38.330 --> 00:10:40.490
with some of these ideas.

00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:43.520
How many ideas that are floating
around in the world

00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:47.970
have originated in you that
other people kind of, what do

00:10:47.970 --> 00:10:49.830
you call, created a viral.

00:10:49.830 --> 00:10:50.470
That's important.

00:10:50.470 --> 00:10:55.230
So can I shift the perspective
from self-centered to

00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:59.640
other-centered before
decision logic?

00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.880
Do we know what part of our
important decisions are made

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:14.200
by infusion, instinct, emotion,
or data, wherefore,

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.530
openness to change the roles.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.185
Sometimes you are the boss.

00:11:18.185 --> 00:11:20.530
And on another project,
sometimes

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:22.020
you are a team member.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.840
In some place, you are
the person who

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.370
gives all the ideas.

00:11:26.370 --> 00:11:28.280
In some other project,
you are the person

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.760
who needs to implement.

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:33.840
But if you get stuck with one
role, saying, because I have

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.060
been in this role, I always have
to be in that role, you

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.800
get left behind.

00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:43.020
So the role clarity,
how do I play that?

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.330
And finally, what are the things
you want for short

00:11:46.330 --> 00:11:50.120
term, medium term, long term,
and how do you become

00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:54.620
productive by discovering your
own drivers of motivation.

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:57.550
These are six things which
we touched upon.

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:02.550
And if you were to look at the
book, first we recommend, go

00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:06.610
check out a website where we
have a, what do you call--

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:06.703
NAVI RADJOU: The assessment.

00:12:06.703 --> 00:12:08.100
PRASAD KAIPA: --the wise
leader questionnaire

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:09.770
assessment.

00:12:09.770 --> 00:12:14.360
For these six wisdom acronyms,
each of them, we have created

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:15.210
some questions.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:16.720
It takes less than
five minutes for

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:18.030
you to fill it out.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:21.840
If you go to
fromsmarttowise.com, you can

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.670
actually go take the assessment,
see where the

00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.870
baseline is, and get the
book and read one

00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:29.080
chapter at a time.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.730
Don't read the whole
book at one time.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:32.450
Read one chapter.

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:34.940
See what you can take
and practice.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:38.050
Discuss with other people.

00:12:38.050 --> 00:12:40.150
Put it on Facebook what
you are doing.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:44.170
And discuss what other people
are looking at.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:47.410
In your own Google circles, what
are all the ways in which

00:12:47.410 --> 00:12:49.520
other people are thinking
about it?

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:53.610
And then, once you feel like you
got it into your DNA, move

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:55.770
on to the other one.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:12:58.520
So that is how we have
written the book.

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:01.130
So I have given you just
broadly the framework.

00:13:01.130 --> 00:13:03.090
And I'll let Navi
say a few words.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:04.740
And then, we can take some
questions on that.

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:05.420
NAVI RADJOU: Sure.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:08.310
I mean, Prasad did a great job
in terms of outlining the

00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.780
contours of this wisdom
framework.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:13.260
But essentially, in a nutshell,
something to kind of

00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:16.580
clarify, so wisdom for us
is the application of

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:19.650
intelligence to serve
a larger purpose.

00:13:19.650 --> 00:13:22.530
So what we are saying is not
that you need to kind of dial

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:25.470
down your smartness, but find
the kind of right purpose

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.800
where you can apply it in a very
context-aware fashion.

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:31.840
The second kind of piece of
definition of wise leadership

00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:35.840
is this balancing act between
action and reflection and

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:36.950
introspection.

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:39.402
So because what defines a lot
of smart leaders get carried

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:40.360
away by action.

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.140
And we're just talking to large
companies last 10 days.

00:13:43.140 --> 00:13:46.450
One of the big question they ask
us was, look, we have to

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.870
meet shareholders' expectations,
quarterly

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.400
returns are still important.

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.290
So it's all about action,
action, action.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:54.920
But we were just talking to a
large IT service company.

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:57.440
We were saying, look, you are
facing a lot of competition in

00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:00.600
the marketplace right now, where
if you only focus on

00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:03.730
action, which is how can we
reclaim our lost market share,

00:14:03.730 --> 00:14:07.100
you lose an opportunity to step
back a bit and to reflect

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.330
and introspect, to figure out
what caused this downfall in

00:14:10.330 --> 00:14:14.380
the first place, and how can
we regain our past glory by

00:14:14.380 --> 00:14:16.630
reconnecting with our
authentic self?

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:19.130
And that is often seen as
luxury, because we are all

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:21.590
driven in real-time kind
of mode all the time.

00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:24.080
So I just want to kind of say
that essentially a nice way to

00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:27.480
remember wisdom is many of you
might be developers, you know

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.086
the language C++.

00:14:29.086 --> 00:14:34.590
So think about wisdom being
S++, smartness plus, plus.

00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:36.980
So it's not about relinquishing
your smartness

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.150
but applying your smartness in
a context-aware fashion.

00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:42.760
That's the first plus,
recognizing that contexts keep

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.020
changing all the time.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:46.350
And then, make sure that you
apply your smartness with the

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.880
right intent and right
motivation.

00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:50.990
Rather than saying, oh, I'm
going to show off how smart I

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:54.450
am, it's more about how can I
use my smartness to serve a

00:14:54.450 --> 00:14:54.875
larger purpose.

00:14:54.875 --> 00:14:57.770
So in a nutshell, that's what
it is, smart-plus-plus.

00:14:57.770 --> 00:14:58.582
PRASAD KAIPA: Yeah.

00:14:58.582 --> 00:15:01.450
So for example, you can
ask a question, right?

00:15:01.450 --> 00:15:05.800
When you come into the room,
into any team meeting, will

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:08.480
people be excited?

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:11.380
Or when you leave the team
meeting, would people to be

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.456
more excited?

00:15:13.456 --> 00:15:14.870
Think about that.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:17.370
Because that's a sign.

00:15:17.370 --> 00:15:20.810
Without you opening your mouth,
their opening their

00:15:20.810 --> 00:15:25.110
mouth, they can actually tell
you about your contribution.

00:15:25.110 --> 00:15:29.710
Similarly, you need to look at
it and say, when I have a

00:15:29.710 --> 00:15:34.060
noble purpose to take care of
my people, your productivity

00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:34.980
can be much higher.

00:15:34.980 --> 00:15:40.000
Actually, there is a research
that shows, in a IT industry,

00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:44.880
the productivity of a person
who is passionate, engaged,

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:49.260
and clear is 13 times more
productive than another

00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:50.526
average employee.

00:15:50.526 --> 00:15:55.310
This is 1,300% increase between
an average employee

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.300
and an extraordinary employee
who is passionate, finds

00:15:58.300 --> 00:15:59.900
meaning and energy.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.310
So think about it.

00:16:01.310 --> 00:16:04.600
Let's look at how we can
take it forward.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:07.415
And please, we are open to
questions and comments.

00:16:07.415 --> 00:16:07.800
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.620
My name is [INAUDIBLE], When you
talk about, say, business

00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:14.690
thinking or strategic thinking
versus domain-specific

00:16:14.690 --> 00:16:17.890
specialties, I think a lot of
times, it's your natural

00:16:17.890 --> 00:16:22.200
inclination to go towards
one or the other.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.460
I believe it's difficult to pick
up the other side of the

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:28.320
spectrum, so how do you
recommend we do it?

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:32.255
PRASAD KAIPA: The best way I
recommend you do it is, first,

00:16:32.255 --> 00:16:34.360
recognizing there
are limitations

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.840
to my way of thinking.

00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:42.880
If we do not recognize that
there is value in the other

00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:47.430
side and there is a way in which
they can complement our

00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:51.240
way of thinking, first of all,
whatever we do becomes very

00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.590
superficial.

00:16:52.590 --> 00:16:55.930
It may be appropriate, but it
will never be authentic.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:00.660
So first step is to acknowledge
the weakness.

00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:02.870
That is the hardest part
several times for smart

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:03.740
people, isn't it?

00:17:03.740 --> 00:17:07.400
First, we need to be willing
to learn from that.

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.990
Second step would be to
recognize that even if they

00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:15.819
say something, it won't
necessarily make very much

00:17:15.819 --> 00:17:17.520
sense to us.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.359
If you ask them to explain it
in a way you can understand,

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:25.560
you can act upon, you will
both be frustrated.

00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:29.900
So what is most appropriate to
move from one end of the

00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.230
spectrum to other end of the
spectrum is to take what are

00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:37.290
some steps-- they may give five
set recommendations--

00:17:37.290 --> 00:17:39.055
pick one that is easy.

00:17:39.055 --> 00:17:41.710
And pick one that you are
comfortable with, the low

00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:43.255
hanging fruit we talk
about right now.

00:17:43.255 --> 00:17:45.680
You take that step.

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.510
And then, move to
the next step.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:51.190
And essentially, have
them as some kind of

00:17:51.190 --> 00:17:53.310
a mentor or a coach.

00:17:53.310 --> 00:17:58.100
Tell them, I'm going to take the
risk, but you need to help

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.010
me to be successful.

00:18:00.010 --> 00:18:04.670
So other person's job is not to
criticize and find faults

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:09.790
with you but encourage,
appreciate, and help

00:18:09.790 --> 00:18:11.660
you along the path.

00:18:11.660 --> 00:18:14.490
If we can create a relationship
with people who

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:17.840
are on the other side of the
spectrum-- by the way, as you

00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:21.480
can see, this works very well
even with relationships.

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.360
This is not just about a
workplace situation--

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.860
whatever we are talking about
as wisdom is also, like, for

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.580
example, to take it practically,
what Navi brings,

00:18:33.580 --> 00:18:36.990
what I bring, are extremely
complementary.

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.775
He was a vice president
of Forrester

00:18:38.775 --> 00:18:41.700
Research, a great analyst.

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.860
He knows how to write things.

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:47.400
I mean, his reports are world
famous on innovation in India

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:48.430
in some of them.

00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:52.980
And I am a guy, what you call,
I pass gas through my mouth

00:18:52.980 --> 00:18:53.850
most of the time.

00:18:53.850 --> 00:18:56.700
That is what I call teaching.

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:01.900
So in some respects, if I have
to write, it becomes a major

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:04.250
problem, because I think
a big vision.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:07.320
I try to look at the big
picture, and then I try to

00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:08.470
articulate.

00:19:08.470 --> 00:19:13.500
But the moment we started
working together, he started

00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:16.620
asking me structured
questions.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:18.630
But for me those are
the hardest thing.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:19.880
It's like being straitjacketed.

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.830
You know, as a professor, I like
to pontificate and talk

00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:24.850
big things.

00:19:24.850 --> 00:19:27.160
But he said, but how
do you do that?

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.520
He said, can you tell me in
three sentences what you are

00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.640
talking about?

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:34.140
NAVI RADJOU: Forrester
training, right?

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:34.440
PRASAD KAIPA: Forrester
training.

00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:35.220
NAVI RADJOU: You can say
anything in three bullets.

00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:35.790
PRASAD KAIPA: Three bullets.

00:19:35.790 --> 00:19:37.220
NAVI RADJOU: You cannot explain
in three bullets.

00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:37.930
PRASAD KAIPA: Yeah

00:19:37.930 --> 00:19:38.600
NAVI RADJOU: Even the
biggest idea.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.320
PRASAD KAIPA: Right.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:39.600
NAVI RADJOU: Yeah,
right, right.

00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.340
PRASAD KAIPA: So in the process
of it, we began to

00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:44.810
write first blogs.

00:19:44.810 --> 00:19:45.940
It was interesting.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:49.130
We were able to really crank
out some very good blogs.

00:19:49.130 --> 00:19:52.880
And they started showing
up in the top five.

00:19:52.880 --> 00:19:58.990
So we know that the may to do
that is, greatness from two

00:19:58.990 --> 00:20:01.530
partners, when they
are created as 1

00:20:01.530 --> 00:20:04.560
plus 1 making it 11.

00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:06.720
I couldn't do what we
could do together.

00:20:06.720 --> 00:20:09.080
He couldn't do what we
could do together.

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:11.450
So we began to do small steps.

00:20:11.450 --> 00:20:14.900
Once we became comfortable, we
started writing this book.

00:20:14.900 --> 00:20:16.650
I mean, the process,
of course, we went

00:20:16.650 --> 00:20:17.450
through ups and downs.

00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:19.330
And there were times we were
ready to break up.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:21.100
It was like marriage
pretty much.

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.232
NAVI RADJOU: Please.

00:20:22.232 --> 00:20:26.140
PRASAD KAIPA: But in that
process, we realized, as long

00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:29.990
as we have a larger purpose, and
we have respect for each

00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:31.995
other, I'm willing to learn.

00:20:31.995 --> 00:20:35.290
Even after three years of
working with him, I have so

00:20:35.290 --> 00:20:35.890
much to learn.

00:20:35.890 --> 00:20:39.700
Even in this 10-day book tour,
I'm actually recognizing

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:43.080
several elements of him I had
not recognized in my three

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.820
years of partnership.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:50.670
When that rekindles, when you
come with a certain feeling

00:20:50.670 --> 00:20:54.540
that you don't know so much
about the other person--

00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.600
you might put them in a box--

00:20:56.600 --> 00:20:59.520
but you are willing to learn,
what is the new thing that is

00:20:59.520 --> 00:21:03.700
shining, and you are willing to
appreciate that, that's a

00:21:03.700 --> 00:21:09.320
partnership for much cleaner,
much more what you call a

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.270
value-creating point
of partnership.

00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:13.600
That's what you need to do
to be a wise leader.

00:21:13.600 --> 00:21:15.900
To move from one end
to the other end,

00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:18.570
begin with small steps.

00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:19.560
Trust the other person.

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.970
Let the other person
guide you.

00:21:22.970 --> 00:21:26.260
Put a time to create
value that is

00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:28.345
meaningful for both of you.

00:21:28.345 --> 00:21:31.430
And recognize there will
be a lot of failures.

00:21:31.430 --> 00:21:33.950
But be resilient.

00:21:33.950 --> 00:21:37.930
I think, as you can see, these
are steps for successful

00:21:37.930 --> 00:21:40.735
personal relationships as well
as team relationships.

00:21:40.735 --> 00:21:43.920
That's how we apply what
we are talking about.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:45.420
NAVI RADJOU: The only thing I
would add is that there is a

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:47.990
way you can do that is, Intel,
to give a very concrete

00:21:47.990 --> 00:21:51.350
example, allowed their IT
executives, they are sent on a

00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:52.610
rotation program.

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:55.690
They have to go live and breathe
with the business side

00:21:55.690 --> 00:21:56.800
of the house.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.300
So the idea is that you begin to
shift your perspective from

00:21:59.300 --> 00:22:00.340
the I-shaped person.

00:22:00.340 --> 00:22:02.500
You became a T-shaped person.

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.800
So there are ways, actually,
where you can actually create

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.540
the empathy.

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.630
And at Walmart, they say you
have to think like a retailer.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:10.650
That's a mandate of
IT executives.

00:22:10.650 --> 00:22:12.210
So the empathy you
create one way.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.570
But you get exposed
to the end users.

00:22:14.570 --> 00:22:16.980
So I think there are ways you
can actually artificially,

00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.640
using tools, to shift and
broaden the perspective

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:21.520
especially of the functional
leaders.

00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.360
AUDIENCE: So I was reading
about this thing called a

00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:28.090
philosopher king, where a king
would never be a philosopher

00:22:28.090 --> 00:22:30.110
and vice versa.

00:22:30.110 --> 00:22:33.760
And I've noticed that issues
with leadership and issues

00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.840
with generally smart people
often start with something

00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.000
called the ego.

00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:40.100
I just want to know, have you
all addressed that in the

00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.850
book, where, you know, learning
happens only when you

00:22:42.850 --> 00:22:46.210
drop all your ego and
you are insecure.

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:48.890
And the more you learn, the
more insecure you get.

00:22:48.890 --> 00:22:51.210
And that's kind of a
cyclical process.

00:22:51.210 --> 00:22:52.490
So I want to know if you
all have kind of

00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:55.620
addressed this thing.

00:22:55.620 --> 00:23:01.080
Sadly, I was recently reading
about how, generally, most

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.100
leaders are also the most
narcissistic people you will

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:04.830
find in the world.

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.983
So I wanted to know if you all
have addressed these things in

00:23:06.983 --> 00:23:08.370
the book and, like, kind
of called it out.

00:23:08.370 --> 00:23:09.090
NAVI RADJOU: Yeah.

00:23:09.090 --> 00:23:11.360
First of all, it's important to
clarify that, you're right,

00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:12.370
most smart peoples are

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:13.940
self-centered and often selfish.

00:23:13.940 --> 00:23:14.550
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:16.680
NAVI RADJOU: It's very important
to recognize that we

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:18.890
are not recommending in the book
that you go from being a

00:23:18.890 --> 00:23:22.680
very self-centered, selfish
person to a selfless person.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:24.940
In that case, you have to become
a swami or monk, right?

00:23:24.940 --> 00:23:25.740
That's fine.

00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:28.440
But we introduce a middle
path, a middle ground.

00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:30.390
We call it enlightened
self-interest.

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:32.930
That means, to use an American
English expression, that the

00:23:32.930 --> 00:23:34.820
rising tide will
lift all boats.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:35.100
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:37.430
NAVI RADJOU: And the reason that
a lot of smart leaders,

00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:40.610
we think, are self-centered is
because their view of the

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:43.390
marketplace or the environment
is very much based on a

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:46.430
zero-sum game mindset,
that is, that the pie

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:48.960
is of a fixed size.

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:52.220
So unless I get a piece of it as
big as I can, I'm going to

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:54.150
leave it to the company
direct.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:57.070
The wise leaders, they go
into a co-creation mode.

00:23:57.070 --> 00:24:00.340
In other words, they say, look,
I have the confidence to

00:24:00.340 --> 00:24:03.000
bring in the whole ecosystem
to actually

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:04.070
co-create this pie.

00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:06.660
So the bigger I can make the
pie, and have the power to

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.300
make it, then everybody
gets a bigger slice.

00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.910
So in a nutshell, that's what
we mean, enlightened

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:11.950
self-interest.

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:14.460
So for example, case in point,
Paul Polman, the CEO of

00:24:14.460 --> 00:24:17.790
Unilever, has set a goal to
double the company's revenues

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:22.640
by 2020 while reducing
environmental impact by 50%.

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:24.100
It's about doing
more with less.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.020
Now, is he doing it
out of altruism?

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.160
He, himself, on record,
won't say no.

00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.030
This is enlightened
self-interest.

00:24:30.030 --> 00:24:32.800
Because if I save on natural
resources, I save on cost.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.470
And these cost savings I can
pass on to the customer.

00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:37.330
And then, the shareholders
are happy, right?

00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:40.540
So thinking in a more holistic
fashion, in a more systemic

00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:43.360
fashion, that is also the
hallmark of wise leaders,

00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.020
versus the smart leaders.

00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:47.180
They have a very fragmented
view of the boat.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.350
For them, it's like, doubling
revenues, I can

00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:50.570
crack the code on it.

00:24:50.570 --> 00:24:52.920
Oh, saving the environment,
let's ask the CSR

00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:54.350
department do that.

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:57.300
But bringing them together,
bridging them and integrating

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:00.190
that, that's really, in a way,
what is wise leadership about.

00:25:00.190 --> 00:25:05.370
PRASAD KAIPA: So to build on
that, as individuals, as

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:10.740
managers, we do three things--

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:14.490
what are we going to do,
is one question.

00:25:14.490 --> 00:25:18.320
And then, how are we going to
get it done is the second

00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:22.440
question-- but rarely ask the
question, why are we doing it?

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:27.460
We get into the minutiae of what
and how, but we lose why.

00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.200
That's when exactly the
ego becomes an issue.

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:34.080
Like for example, take
Shahrukh Khan.

00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:36.680
In one movie, he may
be a beggar.

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.130
In another movie, he
may be a killer.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.906
In another movie, he may
be a romantic hero.

00:25:42.906 --> 00:25:45.170
It doesn't matter what it is.

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:48.070
You can sit down and see
him and say, wow,

00:25:48.070 --> 00:25:50.530
he lived this role.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.980
But, you know, he is laughing
all the way to the bank, no

00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.140
matter what role he plays.

00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:55.130
He's in the character.

00:25:55.130 --> 00:25:58.730
We are the one, if we like to
spend five times we go to the

00:25:58.730 --> 00:26:02.450
movie, and making him
richer and richer.

00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:04.180
Why is that important?

00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:08.360
He knows, behind the actor's
role that he plays, that he is

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.680
Shahrukh Khan.

00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:11.520
There is a clarity.

00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:16.440
But he engages with the role,
fully knowing at the end of

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:19.330
the movie, he goes back to
being Shahrukh Khan.

00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:24.630
That means the work that you
do does not change the

00:26:24.630 --> 00:26:26.870
personality behind that.

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:31.680
If you have that role clarity,
then any project you take on,

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:34.250
you don't become
obsessed by it.

00:26:34.250 --> 00:26:36.020
You may have passion for it.

00:26:36.020 --> 00:26:37.720
You may have commitment
for it.

00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:42.080
But if somebody comes in and
say, change the role, if that

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.250
is the best you can do.

00:26:43.250 --> 00:26:47.090
We have seen entrepreneurs where
they start the company

00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:48.076
in Silicon Valley.

00:26:48.076 --> 00:26:50.890
You know, one guy took it
from $0 to $70 million.

00:26:50.890 --> 00:26:54.860
And then, climate person said
we need to bring in an

00:26:54.860 --> 00:26:58.440
external CEO, because, now we
are having multiple products

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:02.280
and multiple customers, we need
different experience.

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:02.960
Discuss it.

00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:04.972
No, I won't step down.

00:27:04.972 --> 00:27:07.450
I've built it from $0
to $70 million.

00:27:07.450 --> 00:27:09.030
What makes you think
I can't take it

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.830
from $70 to $100 million.

00:27:10.830 --> 00:27:16.470
But look at your own Google
Larry Page and Brin.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:20.550
So if you look at it,
they started it.

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:24.670
They brought somebody in, let
the other person run.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.570
You become an understudy.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:29.190
And when you think it is
right time, you come

00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:30.560
back and take it.

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:36.450
That is called having role
clarity about when do you need

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:41.175
to become a learner and when
do you become, what do you

00:27:41.175 --> 00:27:43.740
call, a person who
is a teacher.

00:27:43.740 --> 00:27:47.830
If you have that clarity, then
you see, even then you go

00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:52.440
home, you will not necessarily
have the Google personality.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:55.645
Google will become part
of your personality.

00:27:55.645 --> 00:27:57.310
It is important.

00:27:57.310 --> 00:28:01.480
Otherwise, many young people,
like Eugenics and Gen Y, when

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:05.760
you have a clarity about what
you are contributing, where

00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:09.920
you are contributing, and what
is expected of you in terms of

00:28:09.920 --> 00:28:13.360
your contribution, you will
not get burnt out.

00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.970
You will have a longer passion
and a clearer set of goals.

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:22.820
And also, your innovation
will be at the sharpest.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.720
I think that is where, I think,
the ego gets clarified

00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:30.800
without the emotion getting
too entangled with it.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:33.155
Think about it even in personal
relationships.

00:28:33.155 --> 00:28:33.920
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:36.370
You made an interesting comment,
saying that sometimes

00:28:36.370 --> 00:28:39.040
you think we are more Western
than the Westerners, right?

00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.610
So when it comes to corporate
psyche, what do you think is

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.680
the elementary difference
between the way Westerners

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:46.700
think and the way Easterners
think?

00:28:46.700 --> 00:28:50.120
And also, why is it that you
think we don't leverage enough

00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:52.590
as Easterners from our culture,
from our values,

00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:55.640
because we are just dealing with
the onslaught of a lot of

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:56.200
Western culture?

00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:59.020
So it would be good to see some
inputs from you on that.

00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:00.270
NAVI RADJOU: Sure.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.950
In my first book on jugaad
innovation, I tackled that

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:06.160
topic, that essentially anybody
who would rise in

00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.335
Indian streets know that if you
follow the rules and drive

00:29:09.335 --> 00:29:12.330
in a very structured fashion,
you are going to die, right?

00:29:12.330 --> 00:29:15.660
So this is a culture where
essentially everything is

00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:16.230
unstructured.

00:29:16.230 --> 00:29:18.520
We operate on Indian Standard
Time, which is very different

00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:20.580
than, I know, the GMT.

00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.310
We all know that.

00:29:21.310 --> 00:29:22.770
So the question is--

00:29:22.770 --> 00:29:24.700
this comes literally, we were
discussing about it.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:26.870
It's very important observation,
because it comes

00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:28.810
back to one of the critical
attributes of wise

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:29.940
leadership--

00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:33.790
how do you try to be authentic
and appropriate?

00:29:33.790 --> 00:29:37.020
You have to be authentic as
the Indians working in a

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.000
Western company.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:41.340
So there are certain procedures,
rules, that they

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:42.460
have to follow.

00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:44.330
That's what makes
you appropriate.

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:46.440
But what happens is the
same way with wisdom.

00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.180
And that's why these two
books go hand in hand.

00:29:48.180 --> 00:29:50.290
Because ingenuity is jugaad.

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:53.740
And wisdom is also something
that we hear about when you go

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.980
to temples on the weekends or
we hear it in our families,

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:57.410
talk about it in the evenings.

00:29:57.410 --> 00:29:59.680
But somehow both, what we
discovered, is that when

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.100
people show up at 8 o'clock, 9
o'clock at work, throughout

00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.350
the day, we forget about it.

00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:05.545
But rather, we try to
be appropriate.

00:30:05.545 --> 00:30:07.860
We are going to follow the
corporate procedures and

00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:08.620
rules, et cetera.

00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:12.160
But if there is a way to
integrate both, that would be

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.070
very powerful.

00:30:13.070 --> 00:30:14.300
And case in point is
Renault-Nissan,

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:16.410
the French car maker.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:19.930
They are now coming to India
to learn about jugaad.

00:30:19.930 --> 00:30:22.520
Because they realize that they
have used what they call

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:25.330
frugal innovation, which is they
came up with the $5,000

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.200
car in France, in Europe.

00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:29.650
Now, they say, we have
to create a car

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:31.800
which is 50% cheaper.

00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:37.820
But you cannot do that unless
you change your way you think.

00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:39.160
I love Europe.

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.620
So literally, in Chennai, they
are opening a frugal

00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.440
engineering center out of where
they're going to create

00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:46.660
the next generation
low-cost vehicles.

00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:48.450
And the reason they are opening
it in Chennai is

00:30:48.450 --> 00:30:51.360
because out of India they think
that this unstructured

00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:55.420
way of thinking leads to
disruptive innovation.

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.950
The most structured you are,
you can come up with the

00:30:57.950 --> 00:30:59.860
incremental innovation.

00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:02.420
So if they try to do a
disruptive innovation in a

00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:05.030
European context, what they will
come up with may not be

00:31:05.030 --> 00:31:06.090
disruptive.

00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:09.370
So I think one of the thing we
are hoping is that this book

00:31:09.370 --> 00:31:12.540
and my first book is basically
an attempt for Indians to take

00:31:12.540 --> 00:31:17.130
pride in what sometime
we take for granted.

00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:20.370
Or maybe, practice it in a very
kind of subconscious way.

00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:23.010
But it's so kind of fragmented,
right, because we

00:31:23.010 --> 00:31:25.210
do that in our private lives,
but we don't do that in our

00:31:25.210 --> 00:31:26.220
professional lives.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.010
So that's what my kind
of part of answer is.

00:31:29.010 --> 00:31:30.650
PRASAD KAIPA: I'll give it
from a personal side.

00:31:33.335 --> 00:31:37.900
I have been living in the United
States for 32 years.

00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:42.650
There was a time in Apple when
I had to give a presentation

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:45.920
for John Sculley in Japan in
artificial intelligence

00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.540
conference.

00:31:47.540 --> 00:31:50.620
Because I was representing
John Sculley, they went

00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.310
through and they asked me to
go to Regis McKenna's group

00:31:54.310 --> 00:31:59.790
and spend a lot of time both
for accent reduction and to

00:31:59.790 --> 00:32:02.180
represent an American
company in Japan.

00:32:02.180 --> 00:32:05.660
And I need to be able to
represent the brand.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:09.700
So we went through several
days of accent reduction.

00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:12.580
They said, you know, when
I say think, I need

00:32:12.580 --> 00:32:13.950
to say it like this.

00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:16.420
But I haven't figured it out
how much I should stick my

00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.610
tongue out in sort of
my making myself

00:32:18.610 --> 00:32:20.545
clear to other people.

00:32:20.545 --> 00:32:22.710
Or they said, when you
use some words, you

00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:24.060
need to slow down.

00:32:24.060 --> 00:32:25.970
Indians speak so fast.

00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:27.540
NAVI RADJOU: Machine gun.

00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:30.280
PRASAD KAIPA: Like a machine
gun approach.

00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:34.300
And especially when you talk
about our organization and

00:32:34.300 --> 00:32:36.380
some of these words that have
got a completely different

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.260
meaning if you are
not careful.

00:32:39.260 --> 00:32:44.620
So in that process, after
spending time with them, I

00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:48.710
gave a talk, which was like
my almost ready for talk.

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.260
At that time, Regis
McKenna sat down.

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:51.965
He came back.

00:32:51.965 --> 00:32:56.110
And he put his hand around me
and said, if you don't mind,

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:59.350
please unlearn everything
what we taught you.

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:02.430
We want you to go back to
your Indian accent.

00:33:02.430 --> 00:33:03.650
I said, why?

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:07.440
They said, when you speak
with Indian accent,

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.075
your eyes light up.

00:33:09.075 --> 00:33:11.310
There is intensity.

00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:13.900
And there is gesticulation.

00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:18.170
And there is you are present.

00:33:18.170 --> 00:33:20.980
When you spoke the way in which
you are supposed to

00:33:20.980 --> 00:33:24.540
speak, you represented
the brand.

00:33:24.540 --> 00:33:28.760
But the value of the brand you
represent is so bland we don't

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:31.540
care about it.

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:37.790
I'm suggesting to us, in the
name of becoming Western,

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:40.620
sometimes it is like
a yin and a yang.

00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:43.075
You need to see what
is your being.

00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:48.150
Of course, you may ask, what
is this word, being?

00:33:48.150 --> 00:33:55.780
Being is like Prasad has a
certain way of being oneself.

00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:58.270
There is a way of expressing
oneself.

00:33:58.270 --> 00:34:01.920
If I want to make a lighter way
in of it, Prasad keeps on

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.080
Prasad-ing.

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:07.320
Wherever I go, it doesn't matter
whether interaction is

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.449
10 minutes or 20 minutes.

00:34:09.449 --> 00:34:12.880
Who I am comes through
when I am authentic.

00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:16.040
Another way of saying being
is being authentic.

00:34:16.040 --> 00:34:18.699
And the other thing is the
doing, which is the

00:34:18.699 --> 00:34:21.280
performance.

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:27.650
If I am actually depriving my
Indian-ness, depriving my

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:32.170
Western-ness, depriving my
Japanese-ness, and if I try to

00:34:32.170 --> 00:34:36.270
fit in, if I try to be
appropriate, whether with my

00:34:36.270 --> 00:34:39.409
clothes, whether it is with my
accent, whether it is with my

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:44.830
interests, then what makes me
unique and contribute to the

00:34:44.830 --> 00:34:48.040
job will be completely killed.

00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:52.600
So my ingenuity, if I take on
what my colleagues work is, it

00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:56.270
is translating creativity
into innovation,

00:34:56.270 --> 00:34:58.190
depends on your ingenuity.

00:34:58.190 --> 00:35:01.330
Indian ingenuity is
called jugaad.

00:35:01.330 --> 00:35:03.970
There is a Chinese ingenuity,
Brazilian

00:35:03.970 --> 00:35:06.830
ingenuity, American ingenuity.

00:35:06.830 --> 00:35:09.830
Some of them are represented by
Apple and Google and some

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:10.900
of that stuff.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:14.490
We need to know what
is that essence.

00:35:14.490 --> 00:35:15.880
Keep the essence.

00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.150
Drop the rest.

00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:22.710
Then, you have an ability to
integrate East and West

00:35:22.710 --> 00:35:24.990
extraordinarily uniquely.

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:30.970
And while you are building the
brand of your company, you are

00:35:30.970 --> 00:35:35.230
not losing the authenticity
of who you are.

00:35:35.230 --> 00:35:41.550
The wise leadership is about
being yourself while doing

00:35:41.550 --> 00:35:43.620
what needs to get done.

00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:46.160
When you do that, you are
not really enhancing

00:35:46.160 --> 00:35:47.350
your personal brand.

00:35:47.350 --> 00:35:49.920
You are actually enhancing
the corporate brand.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.460
Because the diversity
will give you

00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:54.260
different sets of ideas.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:58.170
And that ingenuity translates
into coming up with Indian

00:35:58.170 --> 00:36:01.730
products that may have worldwide
application because

00:36:01.730 --> 00:36:04.350
you brought your Indian
thinking into

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:06.180
Western problem solving.

00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:09.980
I think that is where
we can be wise

00:36:09.980 --> 00:36:12.310
without losing our smartness.

00:36:12.310 --> 00:36:14.630
And I hope that's what you
can take away from this

00:36:14.630 --> 00:36:15.880
conversation.
