00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.270
Right so this should be
a relatively simple example,

00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:05.680
very tiny little example,
but it may be challenging.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.100
So here's what's going to happen.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.820
We are in a little four-room museum, and

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.930
we're interested in together
exploring the museum, but

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.650
the first thing we have to do is
actually end up in the same place.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.600
So we each know what state,
we are in state four by the way, but you

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.800
don't know which state the other person
is in, you know where I am for example.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.770
I know where I am, but
I don't know where you are.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.990
We win if we end up in the same state
you can go basically north, south, east,

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.580
west or stay put, and if we're going to
move simultaneously, if I turn ends,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.950
and we're both in the same
place we win okay.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.560
&gt;&gt; So normally you would have to issue
these commands into the environment.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:47.940
Right?
You walk around by yourself.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.210
But you need to tell me what, what
you're going to do, so I can keep track.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.730
&gt;&gt; Okay, and all I can do is move north,
south, east, and west?

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.750
&gt;&gt; Or you can stay put.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.450
&gt;&gt; Or I can stay put?

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:58.480
&gt;&gt; And for

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.260
what it's worth in the DEC-POMDP model,
It's a planning problem.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.120
So we can actually make
up a strategy in advance.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.680
As long as we don't use it
as part of the strategy.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.130
What state where, we're starting in,
because we don't know that.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.210
&gt;&gt; So we can talk about
what our strategy would be?

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:20.378
&gt;&gt; Well I can think of sort of
three classes of strategies.

00:01:20.378 --> 00:01:23.060
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; So one would be one of us decides

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.426
never were to move so that the let
the other person move around.

00:01:26.426 --> 00:01:28.810
&gt;&gt; Good.
&gt;&gt; That way we can't just miss it to

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.670
other right, and so I could not move or
you could not move right.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.410
I should see those two separate things.

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.442
The other one would be we just agree on

00:01:40.442 --> 00:01:45.350
a set of actions that we will take that

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.040
guarantee that we will
end up in the same state.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.470
&gt;&gt; Well and maybe one way to do that is,

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.640
we'll pick out like a focal point will
pick a room that we should both go to.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.980
&gt;&gt; Right, I was thinking three
because three is my favorite number.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.710
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.390
Okay.
So,

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.580
which of these strategies
do you suppose is better?

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.950
Well, It depends on exactly how rewards
and discount factors are defined.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.990
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's true.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.160
But if we just think about cost somehow
being how long it takes us to get there.

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.529
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; I actually guess.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.950
Going to the same room is
probably the best one, because

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:19.980
no matter where you are long as you can
either take zero two steps to get there.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.860
One step to get there or
two steps to get there.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.580
&gt;&gt; Good, good I think you're right
actually, so let's do that so

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.920
we defer to sign in advance that we're
going to converge on room three.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.270
And you wake up, and

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:37.030
you find you're in room four to start,
but I don't know that.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.260
But I know what room I'm in, and
now we both get to choose an action.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.190
&gt;&gt; And I would choose the action left.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:45.800
Assuming we aren't in the same room.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.100
I would choose the actual left.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.650
&gt;&gt; Okay.
All right, and

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:50.770
I will tell you that I
put you in room three.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.450
and I take an action that is trying to
also move me towards room three, and

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.030
it worked.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.738
&gt;&gt; We're both Room three.

00:02:56.738 --> 00:02:57.680
&gt;&gt; We're both there are three.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.319
Hey what you want to see first.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.584
&gt;&gt; Room three.

00:03:01.584 --> 00:03:05.520
[LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; This is the Salvador Dali room.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:06.100
&gt;&gt; Excellent.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.050
&gt;&gt; All right, so this worked out
actually really well for us,

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.050
because you can imagine if this is
a much more complicated domain,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.320
if there's a lot of stochasticity
if our task was more complicated.

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.640
It might be very difficult
to know what to do.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.490
For example, what if you thought
you were in room four, but

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.310
you were actually in a room two.

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.730
And because you know partial
observable states being what they are.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:30.580
So, you might not even know that
you're not in room three yet, and

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.970
it might be very difficult to get
there and know that you got there.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.210
&gt;&gt; Well, I would hope that
there would be some room

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:38.470
&gt;&gt; Where we know whether

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.210
we're in that room or
not you never sure.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.740
I dont know I mean whenever you do this
in a real museum right that's what you

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.020
do look just meet you at the entrance.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.140
&gt;&gt; Well I thought it was
the Jurassic room, but

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.600
it was actually the Cretaceous room.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.780
&gt;&gt; This is where pick an intruder
the entrance or something.

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.470
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.390
Yeah like a good focal of so
like one like the entrance.

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.600
&gt;&gt; No three was the answers as weapons.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.280
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.820
Done and done.
