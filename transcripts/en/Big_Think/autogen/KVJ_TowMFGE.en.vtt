00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.959
Information over-consumption is what a lot
of people think they mean when they say information

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:07.959
overload.

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:11.790
&nbsp;Information over-consumption makes a lot
more sense.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.190
&nbsp;We don’t say that someone is suffering
from food overload.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.369
&nbsp;It’s not like fried chickens are offing
themselves then jumping into deep fryers and

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:25.609
some undead zombie chicken flies out of the
deep fryer and into our mouths for us to eat.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.779
&nbsp;That never—that hasn’t happened to my
knowledge and if it does, well, then we’re

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.940
in the middle of the chicken apocalypse and
that’s problematic.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.129
. . . Sometimes I laugh at my own jokes.

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.320
. . . But information over-consumption is
really the right frame for us to look at things

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.320
through.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.030
&nbsp;We have to take responsibility both for
the supply and the demand of information and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.590
our role as a consumer and a supplier of this
stuff.

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:59.030
In the world of food, for instance, we have
industrialized agriculture, and as we industrialized

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.760
agriculture we created large corporations
who have fiduciary responsibility to produce

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.610
cheap and popular calories, and what that
means is that they go, “Well, what is it

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:12.640
that people want?”

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.830
&nbsp;And now we’ve made it so that you can
have a pizza with everything on it delivered

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.680
to your house for $15 in a half hour made
from all kinds of different things from all

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.710
kinds of different places.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.130
&nbsp;This is as much of a feat of science in
my mind as putting a man on the moon, if you

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.140
really sort of think about what it takes in
order to do that.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.490
&nbsp;
And I think that same thing has gone on with

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:33.490
information.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.180
&nbsp;We’ve industrialized media, and our media
companies now have a fiduciary responsibility

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.940
to produce cheap and popular information,
and that’s led us down the road of Glenn

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.430
Beck and Sarah Palin and Keith Olbermann and
Rachel Maddow, who don’t really want to

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.560
inform us.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.130
&nbsp;They want to affirm us.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.780
&nbsp;They want to tell us what it is that we
want.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.610
&nbsp;I mean think about this for a second.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:57.430
&nbsp;Who wants to hear the truth when they can
hear that they’re right?

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.430
&nbsp;I certainly don’t.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.460
&nbsp;I love being affirmed.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.000
&nbsp;I love being told that I'm right, and I
certainly like that a lot more than I like

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.250
being informed.&nbsp;

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.860
And I think that’s important to realize
when we talk about this supply and demand

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.580
problem of blaming the victim is that we’re
wired for what was good for us and not necessarily

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.420
what is good for us, and our producers are
producing what was good for us, but not necessarily

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.420
what is good for us, so I don’t want to
blame the victim, but I do want us to start

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.810
waking up and realizing that this has a—we
have to have a conscious level of consumption

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.780
when it comes to our information intake.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.290
Your information diet is an ethical choice
of yours, so when you’re on the Huffington

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:44.040
Postlooking at, say, the Kardashians and you
click on the Kardashians, understand that

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.640
you are not only reading that article, but
you’re also voting for that article.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.950
&nbsp;You’re telling an editor to produce more
content like that at the expense of the stuff

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:59.080
that you didn’t click on, and so we have
this sort of rapidization of the tyranny of

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.670
the majority, if you will, because of that
because we are constantly being given what

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.580
it is that we want, not necessarily what it
is that we need, and I think that’s vital

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.880
to understand, that there is a difference
between those two things.

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.100
&nbsp;But in the world of food if we are only
given what we want, what would we look like?

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.090
&nbsp;We’d be—well we’d look like, kind
of like what we do today.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.500
&nbsp;We’re about 35% of Americans are obese
and I think that same thing is going on with

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.500
information.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.780
&nbsp;
I don’t want people to really focus on consuming

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.910
less, just like I think appropriate nutrition
shouldn’t be focused on consuming less.

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:42.210
&nbsp;It should be about consuming well and being
healthy about your information consumption,

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:44.261
and that’s where I’d like to see us go.

00:03:44.261 --> 00:03:45.261
&nbsp;That’s what I’d like to see us do.

00:03:45.261 --> 00:03:48.890
&nbsp;That’s what I’d like to see us do is
to start building healthy frameworks for information

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:53.680
consumption, and sometimes that means reducing
it, sometimes that means subtracting some

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:55.280
of the bad stuff and adding some of the good
stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;
