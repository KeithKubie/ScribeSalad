00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.370
- [Instructor] In previous videos,

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.750
we talk about the emergence
of the Maurya Empire,

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.410
around 322 BCE,

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.070
shortly after the invasion
of Alexander the Great,

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.870
as the first truly great Indian empire

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.890
that unifies most of
the Indian subcontinent.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:20.920
That empire eventually falls,

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.520
and the next significant empire to emerge,

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.120
especially if we talk about

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.410
influence on India and the world,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.410
is the Gupta Empire, which
emerges over 500 years later.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.780
Let's zoom in on our timeline

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.840
to get a deeper appreciation
of the Gupta Empire.

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.640
It's believed that its
start was with Sri Gupta,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.453
he started the Gupta Dynasty around 240,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.540
and it's disputed where they emerged,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:57.100
it might have been in that
region or in that region.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.280
There's different accounts of where

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.930
the Gupta Dynasty initially emerged,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.650
but even in the early 300's,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.190
they really had a control
of a few small kingdoms.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.800
It wasn't until the
reign of Chandragupta I

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.680
that it becomes a significant dynasty.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.650
We need to be careful.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.560
Don't confuse this
Chandragupta, the First,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.560
with Chandragupta Maurya, who
founded the Maurya Dynasty

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.743
over 600 years before the
time we're talking about.

00:01:30.602 --> 00:01:32.990
Chandragupta I, it's interesting because

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.640
he is really able to gain power,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.210
not initially through conquest,
but through a marriage.

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.260
He has a marriage with
the princess Kumaradevi,

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.210
and as a dowry, he's given control over

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.970
much of this region of northeast India.

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:52.490
This region of Magadha or Magadha,

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.540
I am always having
trouble pronouncing that,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.190
so my apologies,

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.170
including the famous city of Pataliputra,

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:00.930
which even at the time
of the Maurya Empire

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.370
and before the Maurya Empire,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.340
this was a famous seat of power.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.670
But once he's in control of this region,

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.630
then he and his successors are able

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.890
to have increased conquests over India.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.520
You see in this light blue color

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.440
what his son Samudragupta was able to do,

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.450
and then one of Samudragupta's sons,

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.500
Chandragupta II, is able
to conquer even more.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.070
But what makes the
Gupta Empire distinctive

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.830
isn't just that they
were able to unify much,

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.290
or conquer much, of India again.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.120
What really makes them distinctive

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.240
is because of that unification,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.440
and especially the
wealth that began to flow

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.410
into the capitol,

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.430
they were able to be sponsors
of significant culture,

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.890
and science, and the arts.

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.220
That's why historians
view the Gupta Empire

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.580
as the golden age of India.

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:57.770
Just to get an appreciation for this,

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.340
the Gupta Empire was during
the time of Kalidasa,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.360
and he is considered to be
the greatest writer ever

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.650
in the Sanskrit language.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.823
He is the William Shakespeare of Sanskrit.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.290
Beyond literature and writing,

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.580
you have significant
contributions to science,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.090
most notably, Aryabhata.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.450
He's known for a very
accurate approximation of pi,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.000
but even more important, a recognition

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.110
that was an approximation,

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.090
and that he potentially recognized
the irrationality of pi,

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.040
one of the first to do so.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.190
The word sin, the trig function,

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.360
is derived from Aryabhata's
word for that function,

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.020
so he established some of the
early ideas of trigonometry.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.670
He did work in summation,

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.960
he did significant astronomical work,

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.190
recognizing the rotation of the Earth

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.340
versus the rotation of the heavens.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.850
He had an early concept of gravity.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:56.250
Even some of these

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.220
notions of the place value system,

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.170
and zero, and decimal notation,

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.990
many of our modern notions of it

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.950
are traced back to Aryabhata.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:08.620
In other videos on the Islamic golden age,

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.020
when we talk about
folks like al-Khwarizmi,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:15.160
a lot of his work was based on

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.253
what he learned from Aryabhata.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.260
Beyond the sciences, and once again,

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.200
this is just a sample of all that happened

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.980
during this period,

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.630
you have the significant
Hindu epics, the Mahabharata,

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.960
the Ramayana, the Periyas, get
written down and formalized.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.660
You can say they were canonized.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:37.980
The game of chess,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.180
or the early version of the game of chess,

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.210
was invented, called chaturanga,

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.640
and they had horsemen,
which were the knights,

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.180
they had infantry, which were the pawns,

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.660
they had elephants, which
eventually turned into bishops,

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.360
but as it migrated into
Persia, the Muslim world,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.060
and then into Europe, it became
our modern game of chess.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.640
Famously, there is this iron pillar,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:02.560
that is now in New Delhi,

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.420
that is traced back to the
time of the Gupta Empire,

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.580
and is believed to the
reign of Chandragupta II.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:10.770
What's amazing about this,

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.310
this is a pillar that's over 20 feet high,

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.000
made out of raw iron, and
over 1500, 1600 years,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.500
it hasn't corroded.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.030
It has inscriptions on
it that help historians

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.740
point to the Gupta Empire.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.610
This is some of the coinage
of the Gupta Empire.

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:32.440
So the big takeaway here is,
this was India's golden age,

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:34.440
the classical period of India.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:38.030
A lot of modern Hinduism
and Indian culture

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.220
can be traced back to this time period.

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.920
But it isn't just its influence on India.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.800
In other videos, we talk
about the Islamic golden age,

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:48.270
and much of that golden age,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.570
which emerges two, three,
400 years after the time,

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.490
after the Gupta Empire falls,

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.060
much of that work in
based on the discoveries

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.060
and the work that is collected

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:03.920
during the time of the Guptas,

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:06.920
and then that becomes
a bridge, eventually,

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.120
to the European Renaissance.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:10.920
Now, like all empires,

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.630
the Gupta Empire does eventually fall,

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.630
in the mid-sixth century,
it's believed around 540, 550,

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:20.550
and one of the main causes,

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.900
there is invasions from
people called the Hunas,

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.010
who historians believe
are either the Huns,

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.330
or a group that are closely
related to the Huns.

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.570
It's considered to be one of the causes

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:35.083
of the eventual decline
of the Gupta Dynasty.
