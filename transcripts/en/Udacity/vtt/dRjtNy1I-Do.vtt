&gt;&gt; That's good David. Note though, that this sentence is a little bit like,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.720
a shark enjoyed eating the frog. This is one representation for

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.320
this sentence, and under the representation we may have two action frames.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.070
One corresponding to the word loved, another corresponded to word watching, and

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.260
then connect them, to the slot result. I hope you can see how agents might

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.778
be able to understand simple stories. In fact, this is quite similar to

00:01:35.778 --> 00:01:40.166
the way Watson and Siri go about to understand the stories that we talk to them.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.420
Almost surely the human interactions with the machines of tomorrow,

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.730
will not be based on the keyboards and mouses that we have today.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.820
We'll talk to the machines, the machines will talk back to us, and

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.550
when we talk to the machines we'll be telling the machines stories.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.427
Stories like Anika decided to have a glass of water, or

00:01:55.427 --> 00:01:59.100
a shark enjoyed eating the frog. And when we tell the stories,

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.960
the stories will have context. They will have ambiguities. And

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.840
we will expect the machines to do common sense reasoning. The power of this

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.380
particular lesson lies in the [UNKNOWN] of a representation, that enables

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.730
a particular kind of common sense reasoning. We'll continue this discussion,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.360
about common sense reasoning of more complex stories, in the next lesson.
