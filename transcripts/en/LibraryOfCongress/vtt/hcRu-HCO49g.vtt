and it turns her evil.

on a green rubber

down over his head,

from the doorway.

a great idea!

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.300
that you're encouraged
to do is submit that book

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:14.980
to the U.S. copyright office
so that you receive --

00:12:14.980 --> 00:12:17.540
you own a copyright
on your work.

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.480
That means your ideas are yours
and your ideas are protected.

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:24.210
When we did a search on all of
the titles in our collection,

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:27.890
we asked our colleagues
if they would send

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:30.070
over to our office
a bunch of them.

00:12:30.070 --> 00:12:33.620
So we have about 10% of the
books that are in the library

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.530
of congress that you
wrote with us today.

00:12:35.530 --> 00:12:38.390
And many of these
books were submitted

00:12:38.390 --> 00:12:39.820
when the copyright
was requested.

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.120
» R.L. STINE: Uh-huh. »

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.170
LEE ANN POTTER: And we
contacted our colleague

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:48.420
in the copyright
office, and we said Hey,

00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:52.100
we don't suppose you have the
copyright registration forms

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:55.550
for all of the hundreds of books
that Mr. Stine has written,

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:57.060
and he responded
through an e-mail,

00:12:57.060 --> 00:12:59.260
and he was like of course we do.

00:12:59.260 --> 00:13:02.050
We're the U.S. copyright office.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:05.450
I went by his office yesterday,
and we have a gift for you. »

00:13:05.450 --> 00:13:07.110

your very first copyright

first good "Goosebumps" book.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:30.860

that was pretty note. »

R.L. STINE: That was amazing.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.190
The first one was
"Welcome to Deadhouse,"

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:42.680
and I think it was the
scariest book of them all.

00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.980
I didn't know what I was doing.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:45.280
It was the first one I wrote.

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.690
It didn't have the funny stuff.

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.840
I always like to do a book
that's scary and funny

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:52.630
at the same time, and
this one is just scary.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:54.560
The second one, "Stay
out of the Basement,"

00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:56.120
that had funny stuff in it.

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.030
I figured out what I was doing.

00:13:58.030 --> 00:14:00.620
This is amazeing to see.

00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.130

any of this. »

copy of it on the screen.

R.L. STINE: I guess
that's a good thing. »

00:14:12.130 --> 00:14:14.200
LEE ANN POTTER: It
is a good thing.

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:16.640
When you wrote the
first "Goosebumps" book,

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.610
did you imagine that it
would become a series?

00:14:18.610 --> 00:14:21.200
» R.L. STINE: When
I wrote the first one,

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.350
I thought we would
do two or three.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.650
That was it.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:27.200
I didn't know people
would like it.

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.500
I wanted to be funny. »

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:29.800
LEE ANN POTTER: Yeah.

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:32.040
» R.L. STINE: And I
didn't understand it at all.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:35.160
And I used to go to
school, and I'd say,

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.780
"Why do you like these books?"

00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:41.790
And kids would always
say we like to be scared.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:44.430
So, I thought okay,
forget the funny stuff.

00:14:44.430 --> 00:14:46.110
I'll be scary from now on.

Nope. The light is terrible.

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.540
And I'm going to tell you --
let me ask you a question first.

00:15:35.540 --> 00:15:40.210
How many of you have
ever seen a ghost?

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.950
How many? No, no.

00:15:41.950 --> 00:15:43.360
I mean a real ghost.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.660
A real ghost.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:53.450
Not on television.

00:15:56.610 --> 00:16:03.480
Not in the movies .
Maybe I saw a ghost once.

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:04.780
I don't know.

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.080
I'm going to tell you.

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.380
You can help me decide.

00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:10.240
I'm going to tell you a true
ghost story that happened

00:16:10.240 --> 00:16:15.620
to my brother Bill and me when
we were kids back in Ohio.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:20.430
It was Halloween time, and
Bill and I were very excited,

00:16:20.430 --> 00:16:23.960
because it was the first
Halloween that we were allowed

00:16:23.960 --> 00:16:27.620
to go out trick or treating
without our parents.

00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.860
We were going out by
ourselves for the first time.

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.920
And we both got dressed
as ghosts.

00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.570
We put sheets down,
and we cut out eyes,

00:16:35.570 --> 00:16:40.300
and we were very scary ghosts,
and we got shopping bags,

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.490
big shopping bags to
collect all the candy.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:49.870
And I took a can of
that silly string.

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:51.370
You know that stuff?

00:16:51.370 --> 00:16:54.560
You squeeze it and
the string comes out?

00:16:54.560 --> 00:17:01.110
Yeah. Just in case we
had to string somebody.

00:17:01.110 --> 00:17:03.410
So, I tucked it in my costume.

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:04.920
And Bill and I went outside.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.520
It was a cold October night.

00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:11.850
I remember it was the
kind of cold that clings

00:17:11.850 --> 00:17:13.700
to the back of your neck.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:16.350
The ground was all crunchy,
hard from the frost.

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:21.520
There was a tiny sliver
of the moon half covered

00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.320
in cloud high in the sky.

00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:27.880
And Bill and I, we always
started out trick or treating

00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.550
at Mrs. Dawson's house
across the street.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:33.810
And that was just our tradition.

00:17:33.810 --> 00:17:35.110
We always started there.

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:36.700
But now I looked
across the street,

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.400
and her house was
completely dark.

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.180
I said, "I guess
she's not home, Bill.

00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:44.330
We'll have to go
on without her."

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:46.230
So we started at the next house.

00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:49.600
We started trick or
treating down the block.

00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:51.560
And my family was very poor.

00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:54.820
We lived in a tiny little house.

00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.670
There were blocks of very
tiny houses, which was great

00:17:58.670 --> 00:18:01.890
at Halloween time, because it
meant you didn't have to go

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.830
up any long driveways.

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:05.360
You didn't have any long walks.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:08.240
You could just go
from house to house.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:13.350
So Bill and I, we went
three or four blocks down,

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.750
and then we went three or
four blocks and came back.

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.520
And by the time we came back,

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.490
our bags were just
bulging with candy.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:25.470
And I looked across the
street, and I saw a light

00:18:25.470 --> 00:18:28.420
on in Mrs. Dawson's
front window.

00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:30.480
I said "Bill, I guess
she's back.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:32.150
Let's go over there.

00:18:32.150 --> 00:18:35.850
" As we went up her driveway,
I could see it wasn't a light.

00:18:35.850 --> 00:18:42.600
It was a big Jack-o-lantern
with a big grin on its face

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:45.560
and yellow fire inside it.

00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:49.920
We got on Mrs. Dawson's
front stoop, and I knocked

00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:52.710
on the door, and we waited.

00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:55.080
She didn't come.

00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:58.760
So, I knocked again,
and I rang the bell.

00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.720
She didn't come to the door.

00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:03.710
Bill said, "She's in there, Bob.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:05.010
Go ahead. String her."

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:09.660
So I took out the silly
string, and I raised it

00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:13.510
to her door, and then I stopped.

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:18.730
I stopped, and I froze,
because I saw the Jack-o-lantern

00:19:18.730 --> 00:19:21.340
in the front window had changed.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:23.340
It wasn't yellow anymore.

00:19:23.340 --> 00:19:31.570
It was a bright scarlet
red, and it had a big frown

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.940
on its face . A big scowl.

00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:38.500
We were half way
down the driveway

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:42.910
when the front door swung
open, and Mrs. Dawson came out.

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:46.610
I remember she was in
this gray nightgown,

00:19:46.610 --> 00:19:48.870
this long, gray nightgown.

00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:52.210
I remember it fluttering
in the wind, fluttering.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:55.540
And she said, "Why
did you wake me?

00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:57.320
Why did you wake me?

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.070
" And I said, "Oh, I'm
sorry, Mrs. Dawson.

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.370
I didn't know.

00:20:02.370 --> 00:20:03.670
I'm really sorry.

00:20:03.670 --> 00:20:06.890
But can I ask you one question?

00:20:06.890 --> 00:20:10.280
How did you do that with
your Jack-o-lantern?

00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.910
" And she said, "Jack-o-lantern?

00:20:12.910 --> 00:20:14.890
I don't have a Jack-o-lantern.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:17.480
" And Bill and I
looked in the window,

00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:18.790
and it was completely dark.

00:20:18.790 --> 00:20:21.570
Nothing was there.

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:27.650
We ran across the street,
dumped out all the candy,

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:31.210
divided it all up, and we
never mentioned it again.

00:20:31.210 --> 00:20:33.000
We didn't mention
the Jack-o-lantern.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.210
We didn't say a thing about it.

00:20:36.210 --> 00:20:39.850
The next morning, I woke up
and I thought, you know what?

00:20:39.850 --> 00:20:42.710
I should apologize
to Mrs. Dawson.

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:44.010
We woke her up.

00:20:44.010 --> 00:20:45.310
That wasn't right.

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.070
So, I got dressed for
school, had breakfast,

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:51.680
and went across the
street to apologize,

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:56.030
but there was a big truck
in Mrs. Dawson's driveway,

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:59.420
and these men going in
and out of her house.

00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:01.100
And I went up to
one of the workers,

00:21:01.100 --> 00:21:05.240
and I said, "What's going on?".

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:08.290
He said I guess you're
getting new neighbors, kid.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:09.590
I said "Why?

00:21:09.590 --> 00:21:11.190
What do you mean?

00:21:11.190 --> 00:21:14.540
" He said, "Oh, I'm sorry.

00:21:14.540 --> 00:21:16.670
Didn't you hear?

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.820
Mrs. Dawson died two weeks ago."

00:21:19.820 --> 00:21:22.940
That's my true ghost story.

00:21:56.040 --> 00:22:04.240
So, I know that we all enjoy
the titles of your books.

00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.190
And you've named a few of them.

00:22:06.190 --> 00:22:07.670
Do you have any favorites?

00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:10.000
» R.L. STINE: A
few favorite titles?

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:14.180
One of my favorite titles is
"Little Shop of Hamsters."

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.180
It's totally ridiculous.

00:22:16.180 --> 00:22:17.480
» LEE ANN POTTER: Okay.

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.780
Okay. »

00:22:18.780 --> 00:22:22.070
R.L. STINE: My favorite
book is the haunted mask.

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:26.750
I think that's my
best Halloween story.

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:31.240
And I always -- I like all the
books with Slappy, because --

00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:33.390
and I've written a lot of them.

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:39.900
The new "Goosebumps" are called
goose bumps, slappy's world.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:43.790
I love writing him because
he insults everybody.

00:22:43.790 --> 00:22:46.390
He's very rude, and THAES
that's fun to write.

00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:49.580
» LEE ANN POTTER: How do
you come up with titles?

00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:50.880
» R.L. STINE: They come to me.

00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.180
That's all I do.

00:22:52.180 --> 00:22:55.720
Kids don't care about this.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:58.670
I don't even try to come
up with ideas anymore,

00:22:58.670 --> 00:23:02.020
because I've done every
story a person can do.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:05.540
I just try to think of titles.

00:23:05.540 --> 00:23:09.290
I'm doing a lot of Slappy
books, because he's so popular.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:15.230
And Slappy is the
star of Goose bumps 2.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:19.830
And Slappy is incredible
in the new movie.

00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:22.030
The newest "Goosebumps" book,

00:23:22.030 --> 00:23:25.630
I had a title "The
Ghost of Slappy."

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:30.180
I killed him, but of
course he comes back. »

00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.680
LEE ANN POTTER: Yep.

00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:34.820
Yep. I understand sometimes
you play games with students

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.320
where you give us a quiz,

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:39.560
whether it's a real
or fake title?

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:40.860
Should we play that?

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.110
» R.L. STINE: Let's do this.

00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:46.370
Let's see how much you really
know about "Goosebumps"s, okay?

00:23:46.370 --> 00:23:49.580
This is a list of
"Goosebumps" titles.

00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:54.060
Some of them are real;
some of them are fake.

00:23:54.060 --> 00:23:56.170
Let's see if you can
tell which ones are real

00:23:56.170 --> 00:23:57.830
and which ones are fake, okay?

00:23:57.830 --> 00:23:59.290
Just shout it out.

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:01.330
Shout out fake or real.

00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.280
Okay? Here we go.

00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:11.410
One, son of slappy.

00:24:13.170 --> 00:24:14.470
» real ! »

00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:18.090
R.L. STINE: You're right.

00:24:18.090 --> 00:24:19.390
Number two.

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:22.290
You just have to shout it
once, and we'll be fine.

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:24.850
Frosty the abombable snow man.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:30.530
That's fake.

00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:37.140
Number three, the barking ghost.

00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:39.080
You got it!

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:40.380
You guys are good.

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:41.680
Yeah that's real.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.980
How about this one?

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:44.280
More Rons from marsons
from mars?

00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:49.370
That is fake, but I think

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:52.060
that would make a great
"Goosebumps" title.

00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.670
Morons from Mars.

00:24:53.670 --> 00:24:58.580
I sent that title to my
editors, and I said let's do a

00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.490
"Goosebumps" called "Morons from
mars," and they said I can't do

00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:08.900
that because I might
offend the morons.

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:13.410
Let's try number five,
"It Came from my Nose."

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:17.570
That one's fake.

00:25:17.570 --> 00:25:19.540
That one's fake. »

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:21.550
LEE ANN POTTER: That's
a good one, too. »

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:24.650
R.L. STINE: Creature teacher.

00:25:28.970 --> 00:25:30.150
That one's real!

00:25:30.150 --> 00:25:33.210
That one's real.

00:25:33.210 --> 00:25:36.430
Attack of the 2,000
pound Datson?

00:25:36.430 --> 00:25:47.520
How about eat Eat
your Breakfast?

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:49.830
That's fake, too, but that
would be a good title.

00:25:49.830 --> 00:25:53.370
I think that's scary,
somebody eating your breakfast.

00:25:53.370 --> 00:25:55.680
I think it would be.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:59.620
And how about, I am
slappy's evil twin?

00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:03.830
That one's real.

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:05.420
That one's real.

00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.720
You guys are good! »

00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:08.020
LEE ANN POTTER: I love it.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.320
» R.L. STINE: You
guys are scary. »

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:12.120
LEE ANN POTTER: Book titles
do certainly give us a sense

00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.740
of a book's content.

00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:20.080
But sometimes it helps to have a
little bit more of a description

00:26:20.080 --> 00:26:21.950
of a book when you're deciding

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:24.060
if it's a book you
want to read or not.

00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.750
So, you guys know when you
go to a library, and you look

00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:32.080
at your card catalog, not only
do you get the title of a book,

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:35.830
but you also get a
description of the book

00:26:35.830 --> 00:26:38.460
that you're considering reading.

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:42.100
Well, those descriptions
are often written right here

00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:44.220
at the library of congress.

00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:47.340
We have a group of
colleagues who work

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.370
in the building next
door to this building,

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:51.150
in our Madison building,
who are part

00:26:51.150 --> 00:26:53.310
of the library's
cataloging division.

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:56.040
And part of their
job is to read books

00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:58.990
and then write descriptions
of those books that end

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:00.290
up in the card catalog.

00:27:00.290 --> 00:27:02.940
And one of our colleagues
who does that,

00:27:02.940 --> 00:27:05.060
her name is Anne,
and she's here, too.

00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:10.170
I sent her a note and asked if
she remembers writing summaries

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:13.970
for any of R.L. Stine's books,
and she immediately responded

00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:16.760
and said of course, and she gave
me a list of a bunch of them.

00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.000
So, I'm going to read
you a couple of them.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.880
One of the books that
you already mentioned,

00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:24.520
"Welcome to Dead house."

00:27:24.520 --> 00:27:28.190
Ann's the one who wrote
the summary for that book

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.060
that appears in the
card catalog.

00:27:30.060 --> 00:27:35.030
It reads "Amanda and Josh
move with their parents

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:38.180
into an old haunted house
located in the strange town

00:27:38.180 --> 00:27:41.750
of dark falls where people
are unlike any they have

00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:43.890
known before."

00:27:43.890 --> 00:27:46.380
Do you think it would be hard
to capture an entire book

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:48.010
in less than 30 words? »

00:27:48.010 --> 00:27:51.370
R.L. STINE: That's pretty
good for two sentences. »

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.000
LEE ANN POTTER: Here's
another one.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:59.430
The title of the book is
"Why I'm afraid of Bees.

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:02.220
" Garrett's dream is
about to come true.

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:04.260
He's going to exchange bodies

00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:07.570
with another kid
for a whole week.

00:28:07.570 --> 00:28:10.780
But the new body isn't human...

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:13.160
. that's a pretty
good description, too.

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:14.460
» R.L. STINE: It's a bee.

00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:15.760
Where's that part?

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.090
» LEE ANN POTTER: The
title gave that one away.

00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:23.130
» R.L. STINE: And a
night in the beehive.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.910
HiHe sleeps in a
beehive all night.

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:27.680
I would hate that.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:32.090
» LEE ANN POTTER: I don't
think I would like it either.

00:28:32.090 --> 00:28:34.610
Might you like to read a
little from one of your books?

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:36.380
» R.L. STINE: I
could read something.

00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:40.570
I thought I would read
you -- since we're here,

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:43.580
I might as well, you know?

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:47.700
This is the very first
chapter of the first

00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:50.820
"Goosebumps" slappy's
world book.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:54.030
It's "Slappy Birthday to You."

00:28:54.030 --> 00:28:58.380
This is just how
the book starts out.

00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:04.230
It has a really weird and
stupid chapter ending.

00:29:04.230 --> 00:29:10.130
So, that's why I
like to read it.

00:29:10.130 --> 00:29:16.810
On Ian Barker's 12th
birthday, he received a gift

00:29:16.810 --> 00:29:22.370
that brought pain and terror
to him and his entire family.

00:29:22.370 --> 00:29:25.180
But let's not get
ahead of ourselves.

00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:29.470
Let's try to enJOIjoy Ian's
birthday for as long as we can.

00:29:29.470 --> 00:29:32.660
Let's keep in mind that it
was not the birthday Ian had

00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:34.050
hopped for.

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:40.390
It quickly became a day he would
have given anything to forget.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:44.450
Ian came down to breakfast on
that sunny spring morning eager

00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:46.950
for his special day to begin.

00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:48.500
Almost at once, he had trouble

00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:51.390
with his -year-old
9-year-old sister, molly,

00:29:51.390 --> 00:29:52.920
but that was nothing new.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:30:01.020
If you asked Ian how to spell
molly, he would say TROUBLE.

00:30:01.020 --> 00:30:05.490
There were pancakes
on the table.

00:30:05.490 --> 00:30:14.670
Molly liked her pancakes drowned
in maple syrup, and she used

00:30:14.670 --> 00:30:19.210
up most of the syrup
before Ian had a chance,

00:30:19.210 --> 00:30:20.510
but Ian didn't claim.

00:30:20.510 --> 00:30:21.810
He was -- complain.

00:30:21.810 --> 00:30:24.310
He was determined to be
cheerful on his birthday.

00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:27.090
Then it came down
to the last pancake.

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:30.220
Mine, Ian said.

00:30:30.220 --> 00:30:33.210
You've already had six.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:38.750
But I saw it first,
Molly insisted.

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:42.360
She kept her fork poking
into the side of the pancake.

00:30:42.360 --> 00:30:43.850
It's my birthday.

00:30:43.850 --> 00:30:46.550
I should get what I want today.

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:50.650
You always think you should get
what you want, molly declared.

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:53.740
Molly has red hair and blue
eyes, and when she gets

00:30:53.740 --> 00:31:01.640
into an argument, her freckled
cheeks turn bright pink.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:04.090
Her mom turned from
the kitchen counter.

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:08.290
She had been arranging
cup cakes for Ian's party.

00:31:08.290 --> 00:31:09.680
Fighting again?

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.730
We're not fighting,
we're disputing.

00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:16.510
Oh, big word, Ian said.

00:31:16.510 --> 00:31:19.610
I'm so totally impressed.

00:31:19.610 --> 00:31:23.100
They kept their forks in
the last remaining pancake.

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:24.900
You're a jerk, molly said.

00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:27.470
I know you know that word.

00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:30.440
Don't call Ian names on his
birthday, Mrs. Barker said.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:33.230
Wait until tomorrow.

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:35.280
She had a good sense of humor.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.440
Sometimes the kids
appreciated it.

00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.320
Sometimes they didn't.

00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:44.570
Why don't you split
the pancake in two.

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:46.010
Good idea, Ian said.

00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:49.910
He used his fork to divide
the pancake into two pieces.

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:51.490
No fair, molly cried.

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:54.150
Your half is twice
as big as mine.

00:31:54.150 --> 00:31:55.450
Ian laughed and gobbled

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:58.750
up his half before molly
could do anything about it.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:00.370
Molly frowned about it.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:01.670
Don't you know how to eat?

00:32:01.670 --> 00:32:04.170
You have syrup on your chin.

00:32:04.170 --> 00:32:05.830
Ian raised the bottle.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:09.750
How would you like
it in your hair?

00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:15.680
Whoa. Mrs. Barker turned
away from the cup cakes

00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.580
and stepped to the table.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.990
Breakfast is other over.

00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:22.290
You're 12 now.

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:25.950
You really have to
stop the fighting.

00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:27.570
She squeezed Ian's shoulder.

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:29.730
Your cousins are
coming for your party.

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:31.460
I want you to be
extra nice to them

00:32:31.460 --> 00:32:35.450
and don't pick fights
like you always do.

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:36.750
Benny and Johnny?

00:32:36.750 --> 00:32:38.310
They always start it.

00:32:38.310 --> 00:32:41.000
Ian always starts
it, molly chimed in.

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:43.180
Shut up, Ian chimed.

00:32:43.180 --> 00:32:45.820
Just listen to me,
Mrs. Barker pleaded.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.890
I want you to be
nice to your cousins.

00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:51.140
They have been going
through a rough time.

00:32:51.140 --> 00:32:52.970
Uncle Donny is out of work

00:32:52.970 --> 00:32:56.400
and aunt Marie is getting
over the operation.

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.420
Can I have a cup cake now?

00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:00.720
Ian slapped the table.

00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:03.330
If she has one, I want one, too.

00:33:03.330 --> 00:33:09.630
Have you heard a word I
said, Mrs. Barker asked?

00:33:09.630 --> 00:33:14.110
And Ian raised his right hand
as if he were swearing an oath.

00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:18.740
Hands off, Mrs. Barker said.

00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:20.310
Go get your dad.

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:24.510
Tell him guests will
be arriving soon.

00:33:24.510 --> 00:33:25.810
Where is he?

00:33:25.810 --> 00:33:28.420
In his workshop,
his mom answered.

00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.720
Where else?

00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.600
Where else, molly mimicked.

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.460
Ian walked down the back hall
to the door to the basement.

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:39.320
He thought about
Johnny and Vinny.

00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.530
They lived just a
few blocks away.

00:33:41.530 --> 00:33:45.870
Johnny was 12 and Vinny was
11, but they looked like twins.

00:33:45.870 --> 00:33:50.120
They were both big bruisers,
tough guys, big for their eyes.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:57.640
Loud and GRAP grabby with round
heads and upturned pig noses.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.160
At least that's how
Ian describes them.

00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:03.590
The kind of guys that were
always bumping up against people

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:06.280
and each other and
always grinning

00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:09.750
about something mean, mean guys.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:11.050
They're just jealous of you.

00:34:11.050 --> 00:34:13.710
That's what Mrs.
Barker always told Ian.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:17.620
They're your only cousins, so
you have to be nice to them.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.310
Ian opened the basement
door and went

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:21.790
down the stairs two at a time.

00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:28.820
The air grew warmer, and
it smelled of GLU glue.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:33.460
His father stood hunches
over his long work table.

00:34:33.460 --> 00:34:35.140
He turned.

00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:40.100
Hi, Ian. Hey dad, Ian
started, mom says --

00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:44.610
her's a birthday surprise
for you, Mr. Barker said.

00:34:44.610 --> 00:34:48.110
He reached both hands to his
face, plucked out his eyes

00:34:48.110 --> 00:34:50.680
and held them up to Ian.

00:34:51.690 --> 00:34:53.660
That's chapter one.

00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:55.340

I know. Those may be
fake eyes, you know?

to be a character in a movie?

Like Jack Black?

00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.430
It's a weird thing.

00:35:54.430 --> 00:35:57.330
I sit there, and they're
talking about me in the movie.

00:35:57.330 --> 00:35:59.200
It's very strange.

I'm so happy he plays me.

We had a lot of fun together.

00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:10.250
And I went down, actually --

00:36:10.250 --> 00:36:14.150
I had my 5 second
cameo in my first film.

00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:17.410
I went down and I shot it.

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:21.730
We were in a school, and I
walk out, and Jack's there,

00:36:21.730 --> 00:36:24.090
and I say, "Hello, Mr. Stine."

00:36:24.090 --> 00:36:25.890
That's my line.

00:36:25.890 --> 00:36:29.200
And he says, "Hello, Mr. Black.

" That was my five
seconds in the movie.

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:38.250

It was lunchtime.

I wanted to go get lunch,

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:53.980
and they kept shooting the
scene over and other again.

decides to bring
everything Halloween to life.

He goes into a drugstore, and
he brings all the masks to life

and all the Halloween
toys and all the costumes

and all the creatures.

everywhere.

the scariest scene involves

You think they're cute...

cute when gummy bears attack.

to me and said,

Why don't we do a scary book
series for younger kids,

bumps week on channel 11,"
