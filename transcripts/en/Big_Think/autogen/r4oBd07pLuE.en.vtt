had found a phenomenon that was faster

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649

than light but it wasn't but it has led

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740
than light but it wasn't but it has led
 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.940

to further explorations and so now

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
to further explorations and so now
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.050

Higgs boson and if they

is discovered who knows where it'll lead

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610
is discovered who knows where it'll lead
 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.880
is discovered who knows where it'll lead
but it is only through basic research

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890
but it is only through basic research
 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.650
but it is only through basic research
that we will learn about the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660
that we will learn about the
 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.210
that we will learn about the
extraordinarily small and the

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220
extraordinarily small and the
 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.600
extraordinarily small and the
extraordinarily huge fabulous question

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610
