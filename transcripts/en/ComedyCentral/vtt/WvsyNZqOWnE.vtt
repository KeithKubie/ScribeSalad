00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:01.460
 - Have you guys ever
 had pregnancy scares

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:02.502
 with women you were dating?

00:00:02.502 --> 00:00:03.754
  I mean I'm sure there have
  - Kind of, yeah.

00:00:03.754 --> 00:00:06.673
 I mean, I've had like
 condoms break or like

00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:09.510
 the condom go out, pull
 like inside like that, yeah.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.303
 - Or like not
 being used condoms?

00:00:11.303 --> 00:00:15.057
- Right. Or just like an
unused condom (laughter)

00:00:15.057 --> 00:00:17.434
 but I still blame the condom,
 (laughter)

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:18.894
  - Wait, you didn't
  even get in there.

00:00:18.894 --> 00:00:19.853
 - This condom didn't come
 out of the wrapper on its own

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:21.480
  and put itself on my dick.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.940
  (laughter)

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.858
  I mean someone had a story
  about getting pregnant

00:00:24.858 --> 00:00:27.569
even after they took
the morning after pill.

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:29.947
 - Yeah.
 - [Nikki] So like there's no,

00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:32.032
  - Some babies just
  wanna be born.

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.034
 - But then you're like that's
 a baby that I wanna keep

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.452
 'cause you survived
 the morning after pill

00:00:35.452 --> 00:00:37.079
 and he's just like retarded.
 (laughter)

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.538
 - Hands are misshapen
 and shit, yeah.

00:00:38.538 --> 00:00:41.333
 - Mike, I love you're
 still using that word just,

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.376
- Me?
- [Nikki] Yeah.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:43.585
- His brother's,
- My brother is.

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.379
 - [Nikki] Oh? So that
 gives you a right?

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:48.382
 Why are, so is he okay
 with you saying the R word?

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.550
 - Sure. But ah
 (laughter).

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.221
 (upbeat rock music)

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:56.974
- I went on vacation
with my dad this weekend

00:00:56.974 --> 00:00:59.268
 and we got back from the
 airport at like maybe three

00:00:59.268 --> 00:01:01.270
  in the morning and my mom
  had left us a sandwich.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.729
But the thing my
brother is like,

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.649
 if there's food in the house,
 he'll eat the whole bag.

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:06.900
 So you have to hide,
 - Right

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.360
 - [Mike] Your snacks,
 or he'll, you know.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.778
 - What does he have actually?

00:01:09.778 --> 00:01:10.988
 - He has like severe autism,

00:01:10.988 --> 00:01:12.948
so he's like kind of non verbal.

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:14.408
 But me and my dad just had
 this moment where we're like

00:01:14.408 --> 00:01:17.035
 we wanted chips with our
 sandwich and we were just like

00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:19.037
 looking around the house at
 three in the morning trying

00:01:19.037 --> 00:01:20.580
to figure out where my
mom could have hid chips

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.291
 (laughter) like there's a
 fucking bear that was there.

00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:24.251
 - Chips treasure.
 - [Mike] Yeah, yeah

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:25.168
  (laughter)

00:01:25.168 --> 00:01:26.670
- So if he gets into something,

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.922
he'll make himself sick
by eating all of it?

00:01:28.922 --> 00:01:30.424
- Yeah, he'll eat the
whole bag and if you try

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.009
  to take it away from him,
  - Maybe he's just high.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.093
 - He'll get upset.
 - [Mike] Good luck.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:36.096
 - Yeah, yeah. How old is he?

00:01:36.096 --> 00:01:37.931
 - He's 20? He just turned 28?

00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:39.224
  - Okay, so he's
  younger than you?

00:01:39.224 --> 00:01:40.434
 - [Mike] Yeah.

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:41.393
 - What was that like
 growing up with?

00:01:41.393 --> 00:01:42.686
 - [Mike] It was fine.

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:43.854
 - When did he start
 showing signs of it?

00:01:43.854 --> 00:01:45.105
- Like, when he was two.
- [Nikki] Okay.

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:46.481
  - He was like a
  normal baby, too.

00:01:46.481 --> 00:01:47.858
 - [Nikki] Right.
 - You know, talk and stuff.

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:51.278
 - He was killing it.
 (laughter)

00:01:51.278 --> 00:01:54.781
  - And what were the first
  signs? Do you remember?

00:01:54.781 --> 00:01:56.158
- He would like talk as a baby,

00:01:56.158 --> 00:01:57.784
 he would say like mom and dad

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.119
 and then he would just
 kinda like shut off.

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.954
 And I remember like,
 when my mom was

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:02.372
 like your brother is autistic.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:03.832
 I thought it was weird
 because he was like normal.

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:05.459
 So I didn't think it
 was going to be that.

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:08.920
- Right. And then what's
been the worst of it?

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.299
 - Just like, you know,
 tantrums and stuff like that.

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.967
- Is he ever gonna be
able to live on his own?

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:14.801
 - I don't think so.

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:16.303
  - Oh, that sucks.

00:02:16.303 --> 00:02:18.263
  - [Mike] Yeah, at 36 he'll
  like get his first job

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:19.181
 (laughter) and an apartment.

00:02:19.181 --> 00:02:20.307
- He's just gonna snap into it.

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:21.516
 - What does he do he do at 28,

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:22.893
  what's he doing
  now with his life?

00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:24.644
  - He just kinda
  hangs out at home.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.605
 - Does he have a job
 or is he able to not,

00:02:26.605 --> 00:02:28.357
  - He had one, but
  then I think like,

00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:29.816
 grabbed a lady or something.

00:02:29.816 --> 00:02:31.818
 - [Nikki] Yeah,
 - And they had to fire him.

00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:33.028
- He squeezed a rabbit.

00:02:33.028 --> 00:02:33.987
 - He was working at the Wawa.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.655
  That was a good one, Tom.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:38.075
 (laughter) I never heard that.

00:02:38.075 --> 00:02:40.118
 - I mean you said he grabbed
 a woman, it wasn't that

00:02:40.118 --> 00:02:42.579
 - That's the hackiest way to
 make fun of retarded person.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:43.830
 - Oh, come on.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.998
 - I hope you feel
 good about yourself.

00:02:44.998 --> 00:02:46.666
 That's a human
 being with feelings.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:47.959
  - [Nikki] I think
  using that word,

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.169
- Fucking piece of shit,

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.295
 - You keep saying
 retarded, you asshole.

00:02:50.295 --> 00:02:51.505
 - [Nikki] I know, you're the,

00:02:51.505 --> 00:02:52.714
  - C'mon, squeeze a rabbit?

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:53.799
- Well, come on.

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:56.259
- I liked it. I didn't hate it.

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:57.552
 - You said he grabbed a woman!

00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:59.388
 - Everybody goes right
 to squeeze a rabbit.

00:02:59.388 --> 00:03:01.598
  My brother gets
  me, too. (laughs)

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:02.432
- Buy a rabbit?

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.727
  - Does he know who you, I
  mean, obviously he knows,

00:03:05.727 --> 00:03:07.771
 can he talk at all?
 - [Mike] Yeah, a little bit.

00:03:07.771 --> 00:03:09.189
- [Nikki] A little bit?

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:09.981
 - Answer questions and stuff.
 - [Nikki] Yeah, yeah.

00:03:09.981 --> 00:03:11.108
 Do you see him often?

00:03:11.108 --> 00:03:12.734
- Yeah, when I go home.
- [Nikki] Right.

00:03:14.194 --> 00:03:15.737
  - I'm sorry I'm having so
  many questions about this,

00:03:15.737 --> 00:03:17.155
 but it is kinda fascinating.

00:03:17.155 --> 00:03:18.198
 Do you have other siblings?

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:19.783
 - Yeah, two other siblings.

00:03:19.783 --> 00:03:21.034
 - And do they know,
 - Do they have,

00:03:21.034 --> 00:03:22.536
 - like what causes it?

00:03:22.536 --> 00:03:24.913
- Probably. I probably
have some, a little bit,

00:03:24.913 --> 00:03:26.623
 - Probably?
 (laughter)

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:29.292
- But I was never like,
just totally ignored.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:30.836
 - That's what I'm getting at.

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:32.379
  No, it's not where
  I'm getting at.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.590
  But I definitely,
  (laughs)

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:37.801
 Mike, you have
 something going on.

00:03:37.801 --> 00:03:39.428
 - I, yeah, what do you
 mean? I don't know.

00:03:39.428 --> 00:03:41.012
  - I mean you're
  hyper intelligent,

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:42.556
you write really crazy,

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:46.059
 like I feel there's
 some form of,

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:48.353
 - No one's ever called
 my hyper intelligent.

00:03:48.353 --> 00:03:49.896
  - I think you are.
  - [Mike] Thanks.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.858
 - In terms of joke writing,
 like, you can't write jokes

00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:56.570
 like you write without being
 smart and some weird way.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.487
- Yeah.

00:03:57.487 --> 00:03:58.697
- Thanks, guys.

00:03:58.697 --> 00:03:59.906
 - You have a specific
 smart about you,

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:01.199
- [Tom] I think it's
fine. I stand corrected.

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:02.701
(laughs)

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:04.327
 - Tom smashes the
 bottle over your head.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:07.205
 - No, you have some
 great jokes, but yeah,

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.916
 I feel like there's
 something spectrumy

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.710
about your intelligence.

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:12.919
 - I will, like, like,

00:04:12.919 --> 00:04:14.337
- And the way the way you behave

00:04:14.337 --> 00:04:16.798
 - Interact with people
 - Yeah, interact with people.

00:04:16.798 --> 00:04:18.008
 Can't make I contact.
 - [Tom] Right.

00:04:18.008 --> 00:04:19.426
- I'm making eye contact
with you right now.

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:20.927
  - No, there was an entire
  episode where Mike,

00:04:20.927 --> 00:04:22.429
 - [Ian] Yeah, but your kinda
 like looking through her.

00:04:22.429 --> 00:04:24.931
  - Where Mike wouldn't look
  at my cohost in the eyes

00:04:24.931 --> 00:04:26.641
 for an entire hour.

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.436
- Because we did a
show about Limp Bizkit,

00:04:29.436 --> 00:04:30.979
 and I came on to talk
 about Limp Bizkit,

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.106
 'cause I'm a fan, and
 then the whole time

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:35.942
Tommy was like this
music sucks, I hate it.

00:04:35.942 --> 00:04:38.778
But the whole podcast he was
pretending to like Limp Bizkit.

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:40.071
- Okay.

00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:41.281
  - [Mike] So I felt
  a little betrayed.

00:04:41.281 --> 00:04:42.449
 - [Nikki] And so you,
 - I felt a little,

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:45.035
- Man, if someone
betrays you, you get so,

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:47.496
 (laughter) we're very
 similar in that way.

00:04:47.496 --> 00:04:50.916
 Like, if you get
 hurt do you go after,

00:04:50.916 --> 00:04:54.127
 like do you, how do you
 handle if someone betrays you?

00:04:54.127 --> 00:04:55.337
- I don't have a lot of enemies.

00:04:55.337 --> 00:04:58.423
 But I feel if I did,
 I would destroy them.

00:04:58.423 --> 00:04:59.633
  - Do what?
  (laughs)

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:02.052
 If you had to have a,
 if someone hurt you,

00:05:02.052 --> 00:05:04.679
  you would come after
  them, in like weird ways.

00:05:04.679 --> 00:05:06.973
 Which we'll get to
 later on in the show.

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.643
 Because, I hurt you
 and you came after me

00:05:09.643 --> 00:05:11.645
 in the weirdest, weirdest way.

00:05:11.645 --> 00:05:12.938
 - No, it's not true.

00:05:12.938 --> 00:05:14.648
 - Some would say it
 was an autistic way.

00:05:14.648 --> 00:05:16.149
  - How do you say
  that is not true?

00:05:16.149 --> 00:05:17.734
  - I don't think
  I came after you.

00:05:17.734 --> 00:05:19.194
 I think I wanted to,

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.612
- You wanted to hurt me.

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:22.197
- I wanted. No.

00:05:22.197 --> 00:05:24.783
 - Really? Okay, well
 we'll talk about it.

00:05:24.783 --> 00:05:27.619
  Mike and I have some
  history and he definitely

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:29.746
 did something which I
 do not begrudge you,

00:05:29.746 --> 00:05:32.916
 because I have done dirty,
 dirty things to men who have

00:05:32.916 --> 00:05:36.294
 hurt me and men who
 have rejected me.

00:05:36.294 --> 00:05:37.671
I've done some mean
things I'm not proud of.

00:05:37.671 --> 00:05:39.881
 - The only thing I
 did was I went through

00:05:39.881 --> 00:05:42.384
 your garbage that one time.
 (laughs)

00:05:42.384 --> 00:05:46.429
 - So, Mike and I make
 out in Atlantic City.

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:49.224
 It's just a casual, fun thing.

00:05:49.224 --> 00:05:51.142
 I was just like, oh I can
 just like make out with a boy.

00:05:51.142 --> 00:05:53.520
- Not for me.
(nervous laugh)

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.938
  - It wasn't casual
  and fun for me.

00:05:54.938 --> 00:05:57.440
- I did not know that it
wasn't casual and fun for Mike.

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.860
 I didn't, of course I, I had
 a feeling Mike had crush on me

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.363
 because he can't
 really hide how he is.

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:07.284
 He just like, is, you know,
 you're not really good

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:09.703
  at masking your emotions.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:12.539
  Like, right now (laughter)

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:16.543
 Right now you want to
 punch me in the arm.

00:06:16.543 --> 00:06:17.919
- No, I don't want to punch you.

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:19.170
  And I wasn't even,
  - You wanna change seats?

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.006
 - I'm telling you,
 like I was mad when

00:06:21.006 --> 00:06:23.592
 I texted you that night when
 you were doing that taping

00:06:23.592 --> 00:06:26.219
 with Schumer and
 Feinstein, you like

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:27.470
 - Oh, I don't remember that.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.722
  - [Mike] You kinda
  - I blew you off?

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:30.473
 - Yeah, but you were
 taping a TV thing,

00:06:30.473 --> 00:06:32.058
- [Nikki] Yeah.
- And you text me back.

00:06:32.058 --> 00:06:33.560
 And there was no
 service in the thing

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.438
  and I was like stay the
  fuck away from me forever.

00:06:36.438 --> 00:06:37.272
 - You said that to me?

00:06:37.272 --> 00:06:38.523
 - I think so, yeah.

00:06:38.523 --> 00:06:39.441
  - [Nikki] Yeah,
  that seems right.

00:06:39.441 --> 00:06:40.650
 - [Mike] Yeah, but I wasn't,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:41.901
 - I remember there
 were a couple moments

00:06:41.901 --> 00:06:43.320
 - [Mike] I was mad
 when I wrote sketch,

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.696
 - with you where I was
 like, you need to my number.

00:06:44.696 --> 00:06:48.408
You're crazy. And I
don't like you. (laughs)

00:06:48.408 --> 00:06:51.494
I do remember there were
a couple of times where

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:53.747
  I was a little bit
  like, he's not,

00:06:54.873 --> 00:06:57.208
I've upset this person,
that like I'm scared

00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:58.585
  of his anger a little bit.

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.086
 - Well, I'm sorry about that.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:01.880
 - Well, that's okay because
 now I realize you put your

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.675
  anger into sketches and
  not like actual violence.

00:07:05.675 --> 00:07:07.052
  So, I don't care what you,

00:07:07.052 --> 00:07:09.929
  what the kinds of
  things your write.

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:13.141
 Okay, so. We made out.
 I go back to St. Louis

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:16.811
 and I didn't realize that he

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.441
  thought this was now going
  to be something more.

00:07:21.441 --> 00:07:24.110
- But you were pretty,
like honest about that.

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.654
  And I remember I was like,

00:07:25.654 --> 00:07:27.322
after that happened I was like,

00:07:27.322 --> 00:07:29.658
 this is a woman I'm
 going marry, my life,

00:07:29.658 --> 00:07:31.201
I've been a loser my whole life

00:07:31.201 --> 00:07:32.744
 but things are going
 to turn around for me.

00:07:32.744 --> 00:07:33.953
  - No way.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.163
 - Yeah. You know, but,
 - [Nikki] I thought,

00:07:35.163 --> 00:07:37.874
- [Ian] After what?
After you guys made out?

00:07:37.874 --> 00:07:40.001
  - Yeah. I felt
  that way too when,

00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:42.379
if I've hooked up with a
guy that I really liked,

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:43.880
  - When you like somebody.
  - [Nikki] Yeah,

00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.131
  - And you just see the,
  if you're like that's it.

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.883
 - You project all of
 these things onto it

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:48.134
 and then that person,

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.469
 - I've never felt this
 feeling since then,

00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:53.306
(laughs)

00:07:53.306 --> 00:07:56.893
  But, I remember I was
  with Mike Lawrence at KFC,

00:07:56.893 --> 00:07:58.061
 and it was right after

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.312
 the double down
 sandwich had come out.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:00.438
 Do you remember those?
 - [Nikki] Oh, yeah.

00:08:00.438 --> 00:08:01.815
- They're like a
sandwich without bread.

00:08:01.815 --> 00:08:04.109
 So it's two pieces of
 fried chicken, yeah,

00:08:04.109 --> 00:08:06.152
 so the bun is the
 chicken and there's

00:08:06.152 --> 00:08:08.488
bacon and cheese and
mayonnaise in the middle of it.

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:09.698
- [Ian} Uh-Huh.

00:08:09.698 --> 00:08:11.199
 - And I was eating one
 of those sandwiches

00:08:11.199 --> 00:08:12.659
  being like, oh yeah, she's
  just so great, you know,

00:08:12.659 --> 00:08:13.952
 and I'm gonna go see her,
 because you were in Hartford,

00:08:13.952 --> 00:08:14.869
- [Nikki] Yeah,

00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:15.829
 - the following weekend, yeah,

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:17.455
I get this text it's like, yeah,

00:08:17.455 --> 00:08:19.833
 Mike, sorry to be blunt, but I
 really just wanna be friends.

00:08:19.833 --> 00:08:22.335
And I just had to go back to
eating my double down sandwich.

00:08:22.335 --> 00:08:23.628
- Aww, you got rejected.

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:26.047
 - With Mike Lawrence.
 (laughs)

00:08:26.047 --> 00:08:28.800
- It's okay. (laughter)

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.635
- Don't worry about it.

00:08:30.635 --> 00:08:31.594
- You know, ah,

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:34.264
  - I am sorry that,

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:36.725
 - Come back to sewer I live
 in, we'll put a movie on.

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:39.686
(laughs)

00:08:39.686 --> 00:08:40.937
 - I'm going to
 make 15 jokes about

00:08:40.937 --> 00:08:43.273
 this movie we watch
 after this. (laughs)

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:46.359
 - You won't be able to hear
 anything at all. (laughs)

00:08:46.359 --> 00:08:50.155
Because I have opinions (laughs)

00:08:50.155 --> 00:08:54.909
- I remember feeling the
need to write that text

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:58.288
to you because you had
written me the day after

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:01.207
 we had made out, 'cause I
 flew early that next morning.

00:09:01.207 --> 00:09:02.834
I think that's,
- [Mike] Yeah.

00:09:02.834 --> 00:09:05.253
 Why are we reliving this. Can
 I get another seltzer please.

00:09:05.253 --> 00:09:07.714
  - There's like 40 of them
  on the table right here.

00:09:07.714 --> 00:09:09.841
  - I had probably like a 6
  a.m. flight or something,

00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:11.051
 - [Mike] Yeah,

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.302
- 'cause I think I went
right from making out

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:13.762
 to being like I have
 to pack and leave.

00:09:13.762 --> 00:09:14.971
  You can have my hotel
  room. You can sleep here.

00:09:14.971 --> 00:09:16.306
  I think that's
  how it kinda went.

00:09:16.306 --> 00:09:17.766
- Yeah, I think it did.
- [Nikki] Yeah.

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:20.977
  So I, but the next morning
  I land and I remember

00:09:20.977 --> 00:09:22.520
 I was on a run the next day,

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:23.897
 - I still remember how
 the sheets smelled.

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:24.731
  and I got a text,

00:09:24.731 --> 00:09:25.732
(snorting laugh)

00:09:25.732 --> 00:09:27.233
 Wow.

00:09:27.233 --> 00:09:28.568
- Oh boy, it's all coming back.

00:09:28.568 --> 00:09:30.070
- I gotta text,

00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:34.073
 - And what did it say? What
 did it say? This is so funny.

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:35.950
 - I can still smell your hair.

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:36.785
- Whoa!

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.412
 - Yeah. It was
 something like that.

00:09:39.412 --> 00:09:41.498
That was like, last
night was, it was sweet.

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.832
  - But here's the thing. If
  you were really into it,

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.001
  that would be a
  nice text to get.

00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:46.252
 - Or!!
 - Absolutely

00:09:46.252 --> 00:09:48.880
 If you couched it, or
 if you couched it in a

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.381
 I had so much fun
 with you da da da da.

00:09:50.381 --> 00:09:52.258
  - I think he couched it.
  - And then you responded.

00:09:52.258 --> 00:09:53.259
  Oh?
  - I mean,

00:09:53.259 --> 00:09:54.636
- It wasn't just
out of no where?

00:09:54.636 --> 00:09:56.179
 - I don't think so.
 - I can still smell your hair.

00:09:56.179 --> 00:09:58.306
 - It could have been. But
 it was probably was couched,

00:09:58.306 --> 00:10:00.600
 but that was, I just remember
 that being the line that was

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.895
 like oh no, he really
 likes me because that

00:10:03.895 --> 00:10:05.104
- But everything
turned out fine.

00:10:05.104 --> 00:10:06.731
  I'm a men's right
  to activist now.

00:10:06.731 --> 00:10:10.193
 (laughs) (clapping)

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:11.653
 - [Nikki] So.

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:13.988
- I've been totally helping
father's rights @god on twitter.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:16.157
 - You're the leader
 of the Incel Movement.

00:10:17.116 --> 00:10:18.576
 I think a woman should have

00:10:18.576 --> 00:10:21.079
 - I'm having lunch with
 Richard Spencer later today.

00:10:21.079 --> 00:10:22.622
 So everything worked
 out for the best.

00:10:22.622 --> 00:10:23.790
 - Women should legally have
 to let you smell their hair.

00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:25.500
 - But, can I just say,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:27.001
 - Hair is meant to smelled.

00:10:27.001 --> 00:10:29.879
 - So that was like, that was
 kinda like you know whatever,

00:10:29.879 --> 00:10:31.339
but you were honest about that.

00:10:31.339 --> 00:10:35.385
 But then, a month later, this
 was, I think May 1st 2010.

00:10:35.385 --> 00:10:36.886
 No, but it was like a couple
 of months later, right.

00:10:36.886 --> 00:10:37.887
- Yeah
- You were like,

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:38.972
 I'm coming back to New York.

00:10:38.972 --> 00:10:40.265
I can't wait to see you.

00:10:40.265 --> 00:10:43.017
 And I was like,
 alright, time to like,

00:10:43.017 --> 00:10:43.977
you know, get her back.

00:10:43.977 --> 00:10:45.144
 - Start working out?

00:10:45.144 --> 00:10:46.479
 - Yeah, start
 working out and like,

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.106
  I'm gonna be a new
  person, you know.

00:10:48.106 --> 00:10:50.233
 - Yeah, we all all can
 relate to this story.

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:53.695
 - [Mike] Because, and I wish,
 you know I wish looking back

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:55.238
 on it I should have
 been like, you know,

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:57.866
 hey, I really like you and
 maybe it's gonna be a while

00:10:57.866 --> 00:11:00.493
 til we can be friends.

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.203
  - Yeah. Because I
  think just wanted

00:11:02.203 --> 00:11:04.956
 to go right into friendship,

00:11:04.956 --> 00:11:07.876
 which I was talking to Ian
 about this last night about,

00:11:07.876 --> 00:11:09.586
- If there's any young
men listening out there,

00:11:09.586 --> 00:11:11.713
  don't become a men's right
  to activist. (laughter)

00:11:11.713 --> 00:11:13.506
 Be honest about how
 you feel with women.

00:11:13.506 --> 00:11:15.508
  - [Nikki] Yeah, I think
  that's a really good point

00:11:15.508 --> 00:11:17.927
 to make actually
 because when women,

00:11:17.927 --> 00:11:19.888
  or I've been in
  the same position

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:21.723
where I've really like a
guy and I've been like,

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:22.849
  I like you and I
  wanna be with you,

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.517
and he's like, I just wanna be,

00:11:26.019 --> 00:11:27.770
  I treasure our friendship
  too much. And I'd be like,

00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.022
- He said that? A guy said that?

00:11:29.022 --> 00:11:31.274
- Yeah! And I've
been like, okay,

00:11:31.274 --> 00:11:33.026
 that's fine, yeah
 I'm cool with that.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.403
 And I am filled
 resentment hanging out

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:36.696
 with him there on out.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:39.616
 And then he's talking
 about girls with me,

00:11:39.616 --> 00:11:42.535
 and treating me like
 a friend, and it just,

00:11:42.535 --> 00:11:43.995
  you need to take a break.

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:46.289
  If you like someone,
  don't take the friend card

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:48.291
because you can be
their friend eventually

00:11:48.291 --> 00:11:50.752
 and you're not a mean person
 to reject their friendship,

00:11:50.752 --> 00:11:53.546
 but just say, I think I
 need a little bit of space,

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:56.007
  because you not jump
  right from liking someone

00:11:56.007 --> 00:11:57.050
 to being their friend.

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:58.343
And that person is really going

00:11:58.343 --> 00:12:00.261
  to try to friend-zone you,

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:01.971
 and really make it seem like

00:12:01.971 --> 00:12:03.556
 I want to make good
 boundaries here.

00:12:03.556 --> 00:12:05.600
So their gonna talk
about guys they're into,

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.809
 or girls they're into.

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:08.436
And it's going to be
painful, so I would say,

00:12:08.436 --> 00:12:09.395
 - Yeah, it is going
 to be painful.

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:10.772
 And you're going to be like,

00:12:10.772 --> 00:12:12.315
it's going to be
a weird dynamic,

00:12:12.315 --> 00:12:14.901
 like you'll showing up with
 bagels a nine in the morning

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:17.528
 and being like, you
 know, you'll be, yeah.

00:12:17.528 --> 00:12:18.988
 - When did you show
 up with bagels.

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:21.407
 - No, I'm just saying, like,
 you do all these things.

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:22.408
 - Have you done that before?

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:23.910
- You degrade yourself.
- Yes.

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:26.079
 - Right, and you think that
 maybe, you know, in some way,

00:12:26.079 --> 00:12:27.956
 - Yeah.
 - And then secretly your like,

00:12:27.956 --> 00:12:29.540
  - [Mike] You start
  playing games,

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.125
 - And you're like later if
 we hang out, she'll realize,

00:12:31.125 --> 00:12:33.670
 - [Tom] She's gonna
 change her mind.

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:35.171
 I had that with this girl who
 had to tell me the same thing,

00:12:35.171 --> 00:12:37.090
 where she was like, I don't
 want a romantic thing.

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.175
  But she was like, sleeping
  on my couch all the time.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:40.677
 - [Nikki] Yup.

00:12:40.677 --> 00:12:42.178
 - And I was like you need to
 stop sleeping on my couch.

00:12:42.178 --> 00:12:43.763
 - You need to stop letting
 her sleeping on your couch.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:44.931
- I know, yeah.

00:12:44.931 --> 00:12:46.307
 - Wait until she
 see's Buck Hunter Pro,

00:12:46.307 --> 00:12:48.768
 then she'll (laughs)
 then she'll want me.

00:12:48.768 --> 00:12:52.230
  - I mean, I've been on,
  recently on the other side

00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:53.856
 of this where a guy was like,

00:12:53.856 --> 00:12:56.275
  I just cherish our
  friendship so much

00:12:56.275 --> 00:12:58.319
 and I was smart
 enough to know, like,

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.279
 we're not really
 going to be friends.

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:01.990
  Like, I care, I
  like you too much

00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:03.491
 and I don't wanna hear
 about other girls.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:07.286
 So I stepped away, but then
 there are also times where

00:13:07.286 --> 00:13:11.499
in recent times where I've
felt like guys getting a crush,

00:13:11.499 --> 00:13:12.959
 guy friends getting
 a crush on me,

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:16.504
  and I really try to like,
  put a line in the sand

00:13:16.504 --> 00:13:17.755
 before it's even called out.

00:13:17.755 --> 00:13:18.840
  - But you admitted
  you kind of like

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.174
 the attention a little bit.

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:22.343
 - Yes. Of course. As a woman.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.471
 First of all, I
 like the friendship.

00:13:25.471 --> 00:13:28.224
I like having a guy and
having a guy like you,

00:13:28.224 --> 00:13:32.020
they are more, they are in
agreement with you all the time.

00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:34.814
 They do whatever you
 wanna do. (laughs)

00:13:34.814 --> 00:13:38.151
  You know, when a guy likes
  you it's a good energy

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:41.320
 as long as he doesn't
 actually make a move.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.321
- [Mike] Mmhmmm.

00:13:42.321 --> 00:13:43.531
- [Nikki} Do you agree with me?

00:13:43.531 --> 00:13:45.366
 - I gave you a ride
 in my moving van.

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:48.494
 - Yeah. I like, and I wasn't
 taking advantage of it,

00:13:48.494 --> 00:13:51.664
 I was honestly trying
 to just have a friend,

00:13:51.664 --> 00:13:55.668
 but it's just, it's a tricky
 situation and as a woman

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.545
who knows when a guy likes you,

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.339
 you should really try
 to make it very clear

00:14:00.339 --> 00:14:02.884
 that that is not what it is,

00:14:02.884 --> 00:14:06.179
 so that they don't get to
 the point where they're like,

00:14:06.179 --> 00:14:08.931
  I like, just to they know
  that there's no chance.

00:14:08.931 --> 00:14:10.975
 - I mean, but then you
 look at it, like yeah,

00:14:10.975 --> 00:14:13.811
 I mean I lost a bunch of
 weight, my teeth got whiter,

00:14:13.811 --> 00:14:15.980
I started showering, so,

00:14:15.980 --> 00:14:17.148
 - I once told a guy friend,

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:18.649
 - I became a better
 man, you know.

00:14:18.649 --> 00:14:20.860
 - Who I was hanging out with
 who I could tell liked me,

00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:25.031
  I just need you to know it
  will never happen, ever.

00:14:25.031 --> 00:14:27.700
And if we're going to be
friends you need to accept that.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.118
  - And he was like,
  ah, a challenge.

00:14:29.118 --> 00:14:31.537
 - And literally, eight
 years later I have the same,

00:14:31.537 --> 00:14:35.708
 another guy tell me the same
 thing, it will never happen,

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:38.336
and that was so freeing
to me to hear never.

00:14:38.336 --> 00:14:40.004
 - But you don't feel like
 it'll never happen between us?

00:14:40.004 --> 00:14:41.631
  Right? I mean who
  knows? (laughter)

00:14:41.631 --> 00:14:42.924
 - Who knows? We've got a lot
 of life to live. (laughter)

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:45.343
 - I've never told you never.
 - [Tom] Wooo!

00:14:45.343 --> 00:14:46.177
  - I've never told
  Mike Recine that.

00:14:46.177 --> 00:14:47.595
- Life is long.

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:49.055
 - And that's why we brought
 you on the show today.

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.807
 - [Nikki] So, that's why I
 want you here today. (laughs)

00:14:50.807 --> 00:14:52.058
- We're gonna re-enact the kiss.

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:54.227
 - But I think really,
 'cause when you kick

00:14:54.227 --> 00:14:56.562
 the can down the road
 and you go not now,

00:14:56.562 --> 00:14:58.731
you know if you're going
to be into someone.

00:14:58.731 --> 00:15:00.983
And, you obviously
can't predict how things

00:15:00.983 --> 00:15:02.235
  are going to change, but,

00:15:02.235 --> 00:15:03.694
 - I had a thing with
 that gal a while ago,

00:15:03.694 --> 00:15:06.823
and it was like, so intense and
she kind of lead me on a lot

00:15:06.823 --> 00:15:09.325
 and we like kissed a bunch,
 and then she was like,

00:15:09.325 --> 00:15:10.868
 I only want to be your friend.

00:15:10.868 --> 00:15:13.287
 And I was like, but,
 but what about ever?

00:15:13.287 --> 00:15:16.374
  And she goes you need to
  think, tell yourself yes.

00:15:16.374 --> 00:15:19.168
We will never. And I
was like (gasps), okay.

00:15:19.168 --> 00:15:21.921
- You need to, yeah you
need to accept it never.

00:15:23.256 --> 00:15:24.799
 But that is tricky
 situation, because that girl

00:15:24.799 --> 00:15:27.176
was making out with you,
some girls will like,

00:15:27.176 --> 00:15:29.720
  send naked pictures
  'cause he's my guy friend,

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:31.764
 and I want him and I
 want this attention.

00:15:31.764 --> 00:15:34.225
  And that's really
  not nice to do,

00:15:34.225 --> 00:15:36.686
 and we should all be a
 little bit more aware

00:15:36.686 --> 00:15:38.437
 of other people's feelings,
 - Yeah

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:42.483
- And try to empathize with
when someone has a crush on you.

00:15:42.483 --> 00:15:44.110
Which I should have done
a better job of instead

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.570
  of trying to jump
  into friendship

00:15:45.570 --> 00:15:47.321
  with good old Mike
  Recine, because,

00:15:48.781 --> 00:15:50.908
 - Do we really need
 to say good, old,

00:15:50.908 --> 00:15:52.118
 - Here's the thing.

00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.077
It's very hard to jump
into friendship with me.

00:15:53.077 --> 00:15:54.412
  - [Ian] Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:15:54.412 --> 00:15:55.913
  - It's hard, yeah.

00:15:55.913 --> 00:15:56.664
 - You're a difficult person.
 - Do you have any friends?

00:15:57.832 --> 00:15:58.791
  - My dog.
  (sniffs)

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:02.295
- So, I, moving forward I just,

00:16:02.295 --> 00:16:04.797
  I think we just didn't, we
  weren't friends anymore.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:09.635
 Like, I just think that
 your anger about not having

00:16:09.635 --> 00:16:12.430
 our relationship what
 you wanted it to be,

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.557
 I could just feel
 when I was around you,

00:16:14.557 --> 00:16:15.808
 - [Mike] Yeah, okay,

00:16:15.808 --> 00:16:17.351
 - I remember one time
 we went out to dinner,

00:16:17.351 --> 00:16:19.979
  and I bought you dinner,
  and I was really resentful

00:16:19.979 --> 00:16:22.064
 because I don't
 think you thanked me

00:16:22.064 --> 00:16:23.524
  soon enough or something.

00:16:23.524 --> 00:16:24.734
  It was really petty of me,

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:26.152
but I just remember
being like, we're done.

00:16:26.152 --> 00:16:27.862
 - No, I said I was
 take you out to lunch

00:16:27.862 --> 00:16:29.071
 and then you pulled
 your wallet out.

00:16:29.071 --> 00:16:31.199
  - [Nikki} Uh-Huh.
  - Who cares?

00:16:31.199 --> 00:16:33.659
  - I remember you got, I
  remember how much it was.

00:16:33.659 --> 00:16:34.744
 Is this ridiculous?

00:16:34.744 --> 00:16:35.995
- It was like, 33 bucks.

00:16:35.995 --> 00:16:38.122
  - [Nikki] $17 for
  a chicken plate.

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:40.499
 At, what's it called?
 - Pallitree?

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:42.376
- No, it was a different place.

00:16:42.376 --> 00:16:44.503
  But I remember being like,
  I just, and I was broke.

00:16:44.503 --> 00:16:48.341
 And I was like I just spent
 $17 on a guy who is my friend.

00:16:48.341 --> 00:16:49.550
  I was so furious,
  and so I think,

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:51.260
 - And I was like,
 I get something out

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.721
  of this nine month
  ordeal. (laughter)

00:16:53.721 --> 00:16:56.724
- I don't blame you. So,

00:16:56.724 --> 00:16:59.018
  - I'm just doing pull-ups
  like Travis Bickle,

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:02.146
 - So, eventually,
 - Are you testing me?

00:17:02.146 --> 00:17:04.523
- Ooh, a chicken plate (laughs)

00:17:04.523 --> 00:17:09.070
- Mike and I definitely
go our separate ways.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:13.157
 Then let's see, May 29th 2011,

00:17:13.157 --> 00:17:15.284
  I get an email from Mike.

00:17:16.494 --> 00:17:18.287
 And I don't have the
 original email here.

00:17:18.287 --> 00:17:20.414
 Hold on. Yes I do. Hold on.

00:17:20.414 --> 00:17:21.749
 Let me just pull
 this up really quick

00:17:21.749 --> 00:17:23.501
  because I want to
  see wrote to me,

00:17:23.501 --> 00:17:25.920
'cause Tom sent me what he had,

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:27.546
 but it's what you
 sent to your brother.

00:17:27.546 --> 00:17:29.757
 You and your brother co-wrote
 this sketch together.

00:17:29.757 --> 00:17:30.841
 - Here we go.

00:17:32.301 --> 00:17:34.303
And I have an email from
my brother being like,

00:17:34.303 --> 00:17:36.722
  hey, this is really funny,
  maybe we could punch it up

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:38.849
 a little bit but you
 got something here.

00:17:38.849 --> 00:17:42.603
 - Yup. Yup.
 - [Mike] He's like my I dunno,

00:17:42.603 --> 00:17:44.230
  - Okay. So I can't
  find it, whatever.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.773
- [Ian] Enabler?

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:47.191
 - Yeah, I'm trying to think
 of like, a movie character,

00:17:47.191 --> 00:17:50.152
  like a shitty, you
  know, sidekick.

00:17:50.152 --> 00:17:51.737
 - Oh, here it is. Hey, Nikki.

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.281
  My brother and I
  wrote this sketch

00:17:53.281 --> 00:17:55.074
  and there's a part
  in it for you.

00:17:55.074 --> 00:17:56.701
 If you like it let me know.

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:59.161
 He rewrote and
 reformatted it in his,

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:00.913
 I'm not gonna say that word,

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:03.082
 blank little film school way,

00:18:03.082 --> 00:18:05.418
 so I can't figure
 out how to change it.

00:18:05.418 --> 00:18:07.420
 But the only thing I'd take
 out is the line at the end,

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:08.838
- I don't use that word
anymore, by the way.

00:18:08.838 --> 00:18:11.257
- Okay. But you used a
word, it doesn't matter.

00:18:11.257 --> 00:18:13.759
 So, you said check out this
 sketch, do you wanna be in it,

00:18:13.759 --> 00:18:15.595
 is essentially what
 the sketch was.

00:18:15.595 --> 00:18:18.889
 Now, I'd love to read the
 sketch together, all of us.

00:18:18.889 --> 00:18:21.684
  - Yeah. Let's pick parts.
  - [Nikki] Great.

00:18:21.684 --> 00:18:23.436
 - 'cause there's four
 parts I think, right?

00:18:23.436 --> 00:18:24.603
 - Oh, great.

00:18:24.603 --> 00:18:25.646
 - So, I don't
 believe there's four.

00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:26.897
  - No there's three

00:18:26.897 --> 00:18:29.150
  - Why not, maybe
  have Ian play me.

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:32.111
- So. Mike sent me this sketch.

00:18:32.111 --> 00:18:34.530
He asked me to be in it.

00:18:34.530 --> 00:18:36.365
 I'm going to play
 Nikki because there's

00:18:36.365 --> 00:18:37.783
 a part written in it,

00:18:37.783 --> 00:18:40.202
 - Have Ian play me, so
 I can do commentary.

00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:41.620
  - Okay, I would love that.

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.164
  - That's a good idea
  then I'll be the brother.

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:45.541
 - Okay, so Ian is going play
 Mike Recine in this sketch.

00:18:45.541 --> 00:18:47.626
  I'm going to play
  myself, which by the way,

00:18:47.626 --> 00:18:50.379
 Mike made it clear after I
 got upset about this sketch,

00:18:50.379 --> 00:18:51.964
 this was not about me.

00:18:51.964 --> 00:18:53.466
 - But the character's named,

00:18:53.466 --> 00:18:54.258
  - [Nikki] Even though the
  character's named Nikki,

00:18:54.258 --> 00:18:55.468
 it's not me.

00:18:55.468 --> 00:18:56.302
  - Yeah, it could
  have been anybody.

00:18:56.302 --> 00:18:57.136
(laughs)

00:18:57.136 --> 00:18:58.346
 - Spelled N-I-K-K-I.

00:18:58.346 --> 00:18:59.597
 - [Mike] I like to
 write people's names,

00:18:59.597 --> 00:19:01.807
I like to write people's
name into my projects

00:19:01.807 --> 00:19:03.267
  so it feels more personal.

00:19:03.267 --> 00:19:05.978
  - [Nikki] And also,
  there's the part of Steve,

00:19:05.978 --> 00:19:08.356
 which is your real
 brother's name, too.

00:19:08.356 --> 00:19:09.774
  Not the autistic brother.
  - Not the autistic.

00:19:09.774 --> 00:19:12.026
 - I love that this actually
 formatted well, too.

00:19:12.026 --> 00:19:13.235
It's like a Final Draft.

00:19:13.235 --> 00:19:15.488
 - He wrote it in Final
 Draft. (laughter)

00:19:15.488 --> 00:19:18.366
- I asked my mom for
$200 to buy Final Draft

00:19:18.366 --> 00:19:20.368
 so I could write
 this trash (laughs)

00:19:20.368 --> 00:19:22.328
 - This might be the dumbest
 thing written in Final Draft.

00:19:22.328 --> 00:19:25.414
 - Can you send this to me, I
 need to help with formatting.

00:19:25.414 --> 00:19:26.999
  (laughter)

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:30.628
  - This is, so, Mike asked
  me to be in the sketch,

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:32.546
 and this is the sketch. Okay.

00:19:32.546 --> 00:19:34.090
  - [Mike] Now, can
  I just say again,

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.050
  I don't remember being mad
  at you when I wrote this.

00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.469
 I know you think it's some
 kinda revenge thing, and I,

00:19:38.469 --> 00:19:40.179
 - Well, let's let the audience
 decide for themselves.

00:19:40.179 --> 00:19:41.389
  - Should we start
  with the title?

00:19:41.389 --> 00:19:43.808
- Wow! Wait! That's so
weird, the first action

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.769
is Nikki, a dumb bitch,
walks into a book store.

00:19:46.769 --> 00:19:49.438
 - Yeah, you're right.
 Let's save the title.

00:19:49.438 --> 00:19:52.733
  - Okay. Fade in. Interior.

00:19:52.733 --> 00:19:54.026
 - It's good writing.

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:57.696
  - Bookstore. Day.
  Nikki, late 20's,

00:19:57.696 --> 00:19:59.198
browses the book store.

00:19:59.198 --> 00:20:00.533
 What are we all
 laughing at that for?

00:20:00.533 --> 00:20:01.700
  (laughs)
  - [Mike} Because I Think,

00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.369
 - At the time I was
 in my late 20's,

00:20:03.369 --> 00:20:04.537
- No, you were probably
in your mid-twenties.

00:20:04.537 --> 00:20:06.038
- I bet you were earlier
20's then, right?

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.832
 - Oh, yeah. This
 was seven years ago?

00:20:07.832 --> 00:20:08.833
 - [Mike] 2011.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:10.042
- [Tom] Or like,
yeah, yes it is.

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:12.211
  - 27? Okay, late
  20's, that's fine.

00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.880
Nikki, late 20's
browses the book store.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.260
 She sees Steve, early
 20's, a familiar face.

00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.221
Hi, Steve. Weird
seeing you here.

00:20:22.221 --> 00:20:24.515
 - Why? 'Cause I can't read?

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:26.475
 - Nikki's cell phone rings.

00:20:26.475 --> 00:20:28.769
 - That's a funny
 little opening line.

00:20:28.769 --> 00:20:30.938
 - [Nikki] She checks
 who's calling.

00:20:30.938 --> 00:20:32.606
  Oh my god, Steve,
  this is so weird,

00:20:32.606 --> 00:20:33.732
 your brother is calling me.

00:20:33.732 --> 00:20:35.443
 - Hey, don't ad lib.
 (laughs)

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:36.735
 - Don't punch out the script.

00:20:36.735 --> 00:20:38.070
- I feel like I have to.

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:40.406
 - You can't make
 it better. (laughs)

00:20:40.406 --> 00:20:43.117
  - Oh! Your brother
  is calling me?

00:20:44.201 --> 00:20:45.786
- She answers the phone.
- I hate this.

00:20:45.786 --> 00:20:46.745
 - Hey, Mike.

00:20:48.998 --> 00:20:51.250
 Interior. Mike's apartment.

00:20:51.250 --> 00:20:53.252
 Mike lazes on the
 couch in his boxers

00:20:53.252 --> 00:20:55.963
and a Ginnea t-shirt. (laughter)

00:20:55.963 --> 00:20:58.340
 - Ah, hey Nikki. Just
 thought I'd call,

00:20:58.340 --> 00:20:59.717
  see how you doin'.

00:21:01.093 --> 00:21:03.554
 - Intercut between book
 store and Mike's apartment.

00:21:03.554 --> 00:21:06.765
- Oh, I'm good. I'm with
your brother right now.

00:21:06.765 --> 00:21:09.351
 - Oh, yeah. What
 are you guys doin'?

00:21:09.351 --> 00:21:11.061
 - We banged.
 (snorts)

00:21:11.061 --> 00:21:13.272
  Are banging. It's awesome.

00:21:14.482 --> 00:21:16.358
  Mike can't believe
  what he's hearing.

00:21:16.358 --> 00:21:17.985
(laughs)

00:21:17.985 --> 00:21:21.071
 - Steve, it says
 whispering at Nikki.

00:21:21.071 --> 00:21:22.823
 I don't think
 that's a good idea.

00:21:24.116 --> 00:21:26.619
 - Oh, uh. Mike?
 Also, your brother,

00:21:26.619 --> 00:21:28.120
  he's awesome in the sack.

00:21:29.246 --> 00:21:30.498
- Cut to black.

00:21:30.498 --> 00:21:31.957
 - Let's find some of
 Nikki's old emails.

00:21:31.957 --> 00:21:33.209
 - [Nikki] Okay, so clearly,
 - Read them on the air.

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:34.668
  - So that's the beginning.

00:21:34.668 --> 00:21:36.212
  - [Nikki] Clearly the
  first scene is me playing

00:21:36.212 --> 00:21:38.130
  a joke Mike that I'm with
  his brother and I'm like,

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.926
 oh, I'm gonna pretend I'm
 having sex with your brother.

00:21:41.926 --> 00:21:43.802
- Right. At the book store. Yes.

00:21:43.802 --> 00:21:47.973
 - Fade in. Exterior. Street
 corner. A few days later.

00:21:47.973 --> 00:21:50.476
 Nikki walks down the
 street by herself.

00:21:50.476 --> 00:21:55.064
 Approaching her is Steve
 pushing Mike in a wheelchair.

00:21:55.064 --> 00:21:58.484
 Mike's movements are jerky and
 he makes incoherent noises.

00:21:58.484 --> 00:21:59.652
  - This is torture.

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:02.279
 - His head is
 bandaged. (laughter)

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:05.157
Steve pushes the
wheelchair up to Nikki.

00:22:05.157 --> 00:22:06.575
 - Hi, Nikki.

00:22:06.575 --> 00:22:08.160
 - Oh my god!

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.579
  - What? Oh you mean Mike?

00:22:10.579 --> 00:22:13.749
 - Nikki kneels down
 to Mike's eye level.

00:22:13.749 --> 00:22:17.002
 (sobs) What happened?

00:22:17.002 --> 00:22:18.546
 - He can't understand
 you, Nikki.

00:22:18.546 --> 00:22:22.007
  He's permanently
  retarded. (laughs)

00:22:23.467 --> 00:22:26.303
  - Nikki springs
  to her feet. What?

00:22:26.303 --> 00:22:28.222
- Yeah, he tried
to kill himself.

00:22:28.222 --> 00:22:29.557
- Oh my!

00:22:29.557 --> 00:22:33.060
 - It's actually
 your fault. (laughs)

00:22:33.060 --> 00:22:34.853
  You knew he really
  liked you, Nikki.

00:22:34.853 --> 00:22:36.897
 After that joke you
 made he got a gun

00:22:36.897 --> 00:22:39.149
  and tried to kill himself,
  but he didn't die.

00:22:39.149 --> 00:22:41.402
  Sounds messed up,
  but I wish he had.

00:22:41.402 --> 00:22:43.279
 I mean look at him.
 - I can't even defend this.

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:44.530
  (laughter)

00:22:44.530 --> 00:22:45.823
  I think this might
  be bad writing.

00:22:45.823 --> 00:22:47.700
 Now that I think
 about it. (laughter)

00:22:47.700 --> 00:22:51.120
  - Mike plays, okay
  this is direction.

00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.541
Mike plays, plays with the pool
saliva forming on his chest.

00:22:55.541 --> 00:22:57.585
 - Yeah, so now he's
 retarded forever,

00:22:57.585 --> 00:22:59.670
  and I to take care of him.

00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.213
  - What about your parents?

00:23:01.213 --> 00:23:03.382
- They're really busy. (laughs)

00:23:03.382 --> 00:23:05.926
- This needs to be
wiped from the internet.

00:23:05.926 --> 00:23:08.929
 - Mike starts to
 yell incoherently at
 Steve, who leans out,

00:23:08.929 --> 00:23:10.681
 Ian, do you want to
 yell incoherently?

00:23:10.681 --> 00:23:13.559
 - (yells incoherently)
 (laughter)

00:23:13.559 --> 00:23:15.561
 - What is it, Mike?
 Are you hungry?

00:23:15.561 --> 00:23:18.897
 Do you want to drink
 some chicken noodle
 soup out of straw?

00:23:18.897 --> 00:23:21.483
- (yells incoherently) (laughs)

00:23:21.483 --> 00:23:23.694
  - Just one more.
  - Oh (yells incoherently)

00:23:23.694 --> 00:23:25.904
- Mike, try to use your
words. What do you want?

00:23:25.904 --> 00:23:28.365
 - Eeee. Eeee.

00:23:28.365 --> 00:23:31.076
  - Oh, you want me to wipe
  the drool off your face.

00:23:31.076 --> 00:23:34.580
 Steve wipes Mike's face.
 It's okay, it's okay, Mike.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:36.498
 There you go. You're so brave.

00:23:36.498 --> 00:23:38.042
(laughs)

00:23:38.042 --> 00:23:43.047
 - Nikki buries her face in
 her hands and starts to sob.

00:23:44.381 --> 00:23:47.551
  Close on Nikki's tortured,
  guilt-ridden face.

00:23:47.551 --> 00:23:49.053
(laughs)

00:23:49.053 --> 00:23:51.930
 Wider view of Mike standing
 up out of the his wheelchair,

00:23:51.930 --> 00:23:56.226
 taking the bandage off of
 his head and looking angry.

00:23:56.226 --> 00:23:59.271
 - That's what you get for
 fucking with my heart, okay!

00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:01.273
  You really hurt my
  feelings (laughs).

00:24:02.900 --> 00:24:06.904
- He turns and briskly,
briskly walks away.

00:24:06.904 --> 00:24:11.742
 Steve (laughs) I can't
 even get through this.

00:24:11.742 --> 00:24:12.826
 - [Tom] This is the best part.

00:24:12.826 --> 00:24:16.121
 - Steve spits at Nikki's feet.

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:19.291
 - The thing is like, you never
 see someone's early work.

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:21.043
  All we know about
  Ernest Hemingway

00:24:21.043 --> 00:24:22.753
 is that he wrote all
 those good books,

00:24:22.753 --> 00:24:25.255
but we never saw his
short stories and stuff,

00:24:25.255 --> 00:24:26.465
 - After Steve
 - that never made it.

00:24:26.465 --> 00:24:28.926
 That got lost in
 exchanges, you know.

00:24:28.926 --> 00:24:31.345
  - Wait! There's one more,
  there's one more line,

00:24:31.345 --> 00:24:36.350
- You take a journey
as creative person and,

00:24:37.101 --> 00:24:38.310
 - That's very true.

00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:39.478
 - You gotta just put
 words on the page

00:24:39.478 --> 00:24:40.729
 if you want to be a writer.

00:24:40.729 --> 00:24:42.690
 - After Steve spits
 at Nikki, he writes,

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:45.192
 it says, Steve says,
 bitch! (laughs).

00:24:46.652 --> 00:24:49.530
  Mike, wait up. Steve runs
  up to catch up with Nikki,

00:24:49.530 --> 00:24:51.532
ah, Mike, while
pushing the wheelchair.

00:24:51.532 --> 00:24:52.741
  - That's a funny
  image. He's like,

00:24:52.741 --> 00:24:54.410
 chasing after me
 with the wheelchair.

00:24:55.828 --> 00:24:59.123
(laughs) Oh, I like this the
street sounds for the ambience.

00:24:59.123 --> 00:25:02.042
  - Great job on the
  ambience. Okay.

00:25:02.042 --> 00:25:06.839
  - Ian? Ian? As someone who
  has not heard this before,

00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:09.258
 or acted in this scene before,

00:25:09.258 --> 00:25:13.971
 what do you make of this
 sketch that he asked me be in?

00:25:13.971 --> 00:25:15.848
 And I believe I
 wrote back and said

00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:17.641
 I don't want to be
 in your sketch, Mike.

00:25:17.641 --> 00:25:19.685
I want to find the email
that I wrote to you.

00:25:19.685 --> 00:25:20.894
 - Nah. That's not important.

00:25:20.894 --> 00:25:23.188
 - In my response. I
 could not believe it.

00:25:23.188 --> 00:25:27.359
- The sketch is also
called Retarded Forever.

00:25:27.359 --> 00:25:31.780
(laughs) (claps)

00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:34.366
  - So you thought,
  this is how you

00:25:34.366 --> 00:25:35.868
  worked out your
  anger towards me?

00:25:35.868 --> 00:25:38.078
 - At least I had the balls to
 put my feelings on the page.

00:25:38.078 --> 00:25:42.708
  And send it to the person
  who hurt me. (laughter)

00:25:42.708 --> 00:25:46.879
 - The most passive aggressive,
 and asking me to in a sketch!

00:25:46.879 --> 00:25:48.505
 - That's passive aggressive?

00:25:48.505 --> 00:25:49.715
 Yeah!

00:25:49.715 --> 00:25:50.883
 - I don't think that's
 passive aggressive.

00:25:50.883 --> 00:25:52.092
- [Nikki] No, aggressive
would have been,

00:25:52.092 --> 00:25:54.052
 Nikki you hurt me, I'm
 really angry at you.

00:25:54.052 --> 00:25:55.262
  That's aggressive.

00:25:55.262 --> 00:25:56.430
  - No, that would
  have been healthy.

00:25:56.430 --> 00:25:57.890
 - [Mike] You're very right.
 - Hah!

00:25:57.890 --> 00:25:59.266
 - That's something that guys
 have to learn, you know.

00:25:59.266 --> 00:26:01.226
 - [Nikki] Yeah!
 - Is like, just that,

00:26:01.226 --> 00:26:02.436
 - [Nikki] Hold. Hang,

00:26:02.436 --> 00:26:03.937
 dealing with rejection
 in a healthier way.

00:26:03.937 --> 00:26:04.855
 - [Mike] Dealing with
 rejection in a healthier way.

00:26:04.855 --> 00:26:06.023
- [Nikki] Yeah.

00:26:06.023 --> 00:26:07.524
 - 'Cause it's
 gonna happen a lot.

00:26:07.524 --> 00:26:09.401
 - I think it's a good idea
 to write sketches and movies

00:26:09.401 --> 00:26:11.570
 and songs when
 you're mad at someone

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:12.780
 and you want to work it out.

00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:14.114
 Like that would have
 been a fine sketch

00:26:14.114 --> 00:26:16.158
  to write and not send me.

00:26:16.158 --> 00:26:17.618
- Right. And just keep
it locked in the vault.

00:26:17.618 --> 00:26:20.370
 - [Ian] And like not use
 the character's name, Nikki.

00:26:20.370 --> 00:26:22.706
- Also, I had a, my best
friend in high school,

00:26:22.706 --> 00:26:26.084
 was blamed for a guys suicide,
 'cause he wrote a note.

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:27.586
 He killed himself
 and he wrote a note

00:26:27.586 --> 00:26:29.463
 and said "I did this 'cause of
you."

00:26:29.463 --> 00:26:30.672
  So.
  - [Mike] Oh, boy.

00:26:30.672 --> 00:26:32.049
Very triggering for
me, Mike. Thanks a lot.

00:26:32.049 --> 00:26:35.010
 - (laughs) Love this,
 you just did (laughs)

00:26:35.010 --> 00:26:36.428
 - But it is true. A lot of
 times like, girls get blamed,

00:26:36.428 --> 00:26:38.347
- At least that guy got
his point across, huh?

00:26:38.347 --> 00:26:43.352
  (laughter)

00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:51.318
 (upbeat rock music up)
