00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.350
&gt;&gt; Gayle Osterberg:
Good morning.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.650
Good morning, everyone.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.880
How are you all today?

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.940
Great. My name is
Gayle Osterberg.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.600
I'm the director
of communications

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.500
for the Library of Congress.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.980
We work really hard for months
to put this program together

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.180
for you and so it's really
exciting when you come

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.910
into an auditorium and see
people who are here and excited

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.770
to hear from our authors
and spend a great day

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.560
with maybe finding some new
authors, some new books,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.970
and celebrating reading.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.880
So thank you all so
much for being here.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.100
I want to also take a minute
to say a big thank you

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.220
to our festival sponsors.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.810
This event not only
would not be free,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.290
but it just wouldn't happen
at all without the generosity

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.170
of many sponsors:
David Rubenstein,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.180
"The Washington Post,"
the Institute for Museum

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.460
and Library Services as well
as Wells Fargo and many others.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.730
Many of our sponsors
are exhibiting

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.030
down on the Expo floor.

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.270
So if you have a minute
today, please go down there

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.990
and say thank you for
their support of reading

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.640
and of this great event.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.570
I would also invite you to
consider donating yourself.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.190
It's very easy, loc.gov/donate.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:20.700
No contribution is too small
and it will help ensure

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.500
that this event can
continue in the future.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.830
One of the sponsors downstairs
is PBS and I would also

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.320
like to make you aware of a new
series that they will be rolling

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.260
out this fall called
The Great American Read.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.120
They did a wonderful
launch episode

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.120
with host Meredith
Vieira earlier this year.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.400
They surveyed readers like
yourselves across the country

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.050
and came up with a list of
America's 100 favorite novels

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.140
and are encouraging you to read
those throughout the summer

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.870
and to vote for your favorites.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.780
And then this fall, there will
be a great series highlighting

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.910
some of the different books
on the list and counting

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.430
down the favorite novels
that folks have voted

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.730
on throughout the summer.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.270
So I encourage you to take part
in that wonderful activity.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.170
Now our next author, I'm
always so interested to hear

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.720
about the backgrounds
of some of the folks

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.850
that are writers today.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:17.550
They're all extraordinary
authors

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.600
but also just really
extraordinary

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.190
and interesting people.

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.020
And our next author is an
investigative reporter whose

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.410
work has resulted in new
laws, criminal convictions,

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.700
and millions in restitution
for victims and consumers.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.330
Her journalism has been
awarded more than 30 Emmys

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:39.740
and 14 Edward R. Murrow Awards

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:42.690
and that's before we
even get her books.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.120
Her two series, the
Charlotte McNally series

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.700
and the Jane Ryland and
Jake Brogan thrillers are

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.310
national bestsellers.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.090
She is the winner
of five Agathas

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.780
and the Mary Higgins
Clark award.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.570
Her brand-new book, which
she is launching here

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.120
at the National Book Festival

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.350
from Forge Books is
called "Trust Me."

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.730
Has anyone had a
chance to read it yet?

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.610
Trust me when I tell you

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.970
that this book is a mind
twist of the first order.

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.190
I could not put it down.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.470
Another best-selling
author described it as grief

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.670
and deception are at the helm
of Ryan's latest thriller

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.970
in which a crime writer

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.470
and an accused criminal's
lives collide, as they come

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.440
to discover that no one can
be trusted, not even oneself.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.810
It is a book about the truth,

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.500
which to quote one
passage takes three forms:

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.430
what we think it is, how
someone presents it to us,

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.170
and what it really is.

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.920
I can't wait to hear her
talk about this book.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.930
Please welcome for her National
Book Festival debut appearance,

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.730
Hank Phillippi Ryan.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:56.360
[ Applause ]

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.660
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi
Ryan: Good morning.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.960
Thank you so much
for coming here.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.260
This is absolutely great.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.920
I love coming to Washington, DC.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:05.530
I lived here in the 70s
working on Capitol Hill

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.580
for the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Subcommittee

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.250
and for "Rolling
Stone Magazine."

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:14.130
So I always seem to come here
at interesting times, right.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.100
I've been a television reporter
for 43 years, the first year

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.520
in Indianapolis and then
for a while in Atlanta

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.630
and for the past 33 years, I
can't believe it, in Boston.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.710
I've wired myself
with hidden cameras.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.340
I've confronted corrupt
politicians.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.240
I've gone undercover
and in disguise

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.370
but I didn't always
plan to be a reporter.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:39.190
I grew up in really
rural Indiana,

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.230
so rural that you couldn't see
another house from our house.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.720
I used to ride my pony to
the library to get books

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.020
and I would fill up the
saddlebags with books

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.390
and then read up in the hayloft
of the barn behind our house

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.420
and that's where I fell
in love with mystery.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.720
I read Nancy Drew.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.080
You read Nancy Drew, right?

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.330
"The Clue in the Old Clock"
and "The Clue in the Diary,"

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.400
which I thought was clue in the
"dairy" for most of the book

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.050
and I kept thinking, you
know, shouldn't there be cows.

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.350
I don't know.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.650
It was fine.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:14.430
And then my parents lost me
for about a month when I was

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.610
up in the hayloft reading every
single Sherlock Holmes short

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.250
story and novella and
then I went on to, yeah,

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.550
and then I went on to
the golden-age mysteries,

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:26.880
Ngaio Marsh and Josephine
Tey and Dorothy Sayers, and,

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.300
of course, Agatha Christie.

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.980
That's when I really fell
in love with the mystery,

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:35.530
with the architecture
of that kind of a novel

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.330
where a smart author
could lure you in

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.400
and keep you turning the
pages and then in the end,

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.960
surprise you and have you
say, oh, I should've seen

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.220
that coming, but the author
was smarter than I am.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.030
So I always wanted to be a
mystery author or a detective.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:54.090
And as an investigative reporter
and a crime fiction author,

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:56.550
I guess I am a little
bit of each.

00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:58.840
My life did not go the
way it was planned.

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:00.140
I was in college.

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:03.380
I was a Shakespeare major,
much to my parents chagrin.

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.140
My mom is like, oh, honey, you
know, you are never to be able

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:09.710
to get a job, you know
you're unemployable.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.620
And then after college
I went to work

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.530
in several political
campaigns back home in Indiana.

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.860
Sadly, not one candidate I
ever worked for actually won.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.950
So this is one of those moments
when the universe is sort

00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:28.050
of telling you "find
another career."

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:31.440
So I decided that my new
career would be in journalism.

00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:33.770
So I went to the biggest
radio station in Indianapolis

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:36.450
and I went to the news director
and I said I'm here to apply

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:38.580
for the job as a reporter.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:42.240
And he proceeded to ask me all
about my experience in radio

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:46.640
and television and
journalism, which was zero,

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.620
at which point he said,
I'm so sorry, you know,

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.820
you seem like a perfectly
fine young woman,

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:53.270
but I just can't hire you.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:56.620
You have absolutely no
experience whatsoever.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.670
He said but look, can you
just give me one good reason,

00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:03.270
this was 1970, I
should remind you,

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:08.240
he said can you give me one good
reason why I should hire you.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.580
And I said, well, yeah,
you know, I can actually.

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.070
I said your license is up for
renewal at the FCC right now

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:18.540
and you don't have
any women working here

00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.540
and then I just smiled.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:24.870
And the next day I had my first
job in broadcasting [applause].

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:30.090
I know. When you're 20,
when you're 20, you know,

00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.250
you're much more brave than
you are when you realize

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.330
that people are going
to tell you no.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:37.180
But I started writing fiction --

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:39.390
I've been a television
reporter ever since.

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:43.460
I started writing fiction
about ten years ago

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:46.660
when I just had a good idea.

00:07:46.660 --> 00:07:48.610
You know that feeling
when you have a good idea

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.430
and you get goose bumps
and you think, wow,

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:51.730
this is going to work.

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.580
And I went home and I said
to my husband, sweetheart ,

00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:55.550
I'm going to write the novel
I've always wanted to write.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.780
I have a good idea
for a mystery.

00:07:57.780 --> 00:08:00.760
And Jonathan says, great.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.100
Do you know how,
honey, to write a novel?

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.000
And I'm like how hard can it be?

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.840
You know, I've read
a million of these.

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.550
So I soon realized, of
course, how hard it could be.

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:15.930
I'm thrilled to be here
with my tenth novel,

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.310
my first standalone, a
psychological standalone,

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:22.200
which came out really
two days ago.

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.700
So I'm so excited to
share that with you.

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.750
You know about elevator
pitches, right?

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.050
You know what that is.

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:30.600
They tell you that if you
find yourself in an elevator

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:36.170
with Steven Spielberg and he
pushes 25 and you have 25 floors

00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:39.200
with him and he says,
what's your book about that

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:41.650
that you better be
able to tell him.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:44.680
So if I were in an
elevator with you,

00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:47.650
that'd be weird because
it's big.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.990
If I were in an elevator with
you, I would tell you that

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.910
"Trust Me" is one
obsessed journalist --

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:58.180
One buzz saw, can you
hear that next door?

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.120
That "Trust Me" is one obsessed
journalist, one troubled mom,

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:07.360
and they face off in a
high-stakes cat-and-mouse game

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:12.180
to prove their truth about a
gruesome and terrible murder.

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.670
The question is which one is the
cat and which one is the mouse

00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.230
and I dare you to find the liar.

00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:22.170
Let me show you a
cool thing about that.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.290
In looking for the liar, I mean
I love the cover of "Trust Me."

00:09:25.290 --> 00:09:27.040
It's beautiful, right?

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:32.160
But if you look at it this
way, see what it says?

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.480
Can you see that it says "liar?"

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.530
Is that so great?

00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:37.830
Right? Isn't that cool.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.130
Somebody's really smart.

00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:41.550
Yeah, it's very cool.

00:09:41.550 --> 00:09:43.130
So let me tell you a little bit

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:45.230
about where "Trust
Me" came from.

00:09:45.230 --> 00:09:47.300
First, let me tell you
that my husband Jonathan

00:09:47.300 --> 00:09:51.590
and I don't celebrate the
anniversary of the day we met.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:54.890
We celebrate the anniversary
of the day before we met

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:57.480
and we call that
"you never know day,"

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.630
because you never know
what wonderful thing is

00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:01.430
around the next corner.

00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:03.190
Isn't that kind of true?

00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:05.670
You know, on the days that
you're disappointed or unhappy

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:07.300
and you think, oh my
goodness, I'm doomed

00:10:07.300 --> 00:10:10.510
and nothing good is ever
going to happen to me again.

00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:12.610
How often does it happen

00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.730
that something wonderful
happens right after that

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:17.750
out of the adversity of that?

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:22.070
And that is precisely
how "Trust Me," was born,

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:24.120
another "you never know day."

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:27.120
Remember the Casey
Anthony trial?

00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.420
You do, right?

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.580
You remember that the
notorious Florida party girl mom

00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.860
who was accused of the
murder of her young daughter,

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:40.070
of hiding the body and then
lying about it for a month.

00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:41.510
Well, here's an inside scoop.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:45.340
I was hired back then by a
big fancy publishing company

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.510
to write the narrative
nonfiction

00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.820
of the Casey Anthony trial.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:52.460
It was going to be
a big bestseller,

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.200
if all went as planned.

00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:57.470
And you know how
often that happens.

00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:01.450
So I had to have the
book done on the day

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:04.120
that Casey Anthony was sentenced
to life in prison because,

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.900
of course, that was exactly
what was going to happen.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.020
And my deadline was fierce

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:12.730
because I only had started
writing as the trial began.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:14.820
So I worked like a crazy person.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:17.710
I had three computers
going at the same time:

00:11:17.710 --> 00:11:21.600
one for watching the trial, one
for researching the background

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.940
and history and family
story of Casey Anthony

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.190
and the Anthony family,
and one for writing.

00:11:27.190 --> 00:11:28.490
One for viewing, one

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:30.530
for researching,
and one for writing.

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:31.960
I worked all the time.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.090
I worked a million hours a day.

00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:37.220
It had to be fascinating
and brilliant and insightful

00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:40.920
and thoughtful and it
had to be done on time.

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.300
There was no question
about that.

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:45.900
Now here's a confession
as I wrote.

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:47.200
Here's a confession.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.540
As I wrote, I was thinking
this is really good.

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.400
That was doomed.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.700
I loved writing it.

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:55.060
It was so enthralling.

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:59.390
I got to tell a true story
like I do in my TV stories

00:11:59.390 --> 00:12:02.830
but because I had more
time and space in the book,

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:05.210
it could be bigger
and deeper and richer,

00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:08.060
still with every fact correct

00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:11.870
but with every suspenseful
turning point.

00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:15.450
But in this book, unlike
television, I also got to talk

00:12:15.450 --> 00:12:18.720
about how people were thinking
and what they were planning

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:20.490
and what their motivations were.

00:12:20.490 --> 00:12:21.900
So it was perfect.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.120
I got to use my TV skills to
take a lot of complicated stuff

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.970
and make it fascinating and
interesting and compelling

00:12:27.970 --> 00:12:32.690
and my fiction writing skills
to make a page-turner of a story

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:33.990
with a big crime

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:37.970
with stranger-than-fiction
characters and endless suspense.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:43.110
In fact, just to reveal a little
bit more ridiculously personal

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:46.340
stuff, I thought I
had found my calling.

00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:49.500
You know how it feels when
you're really into something?

00:12:49.500 --> 00:12:52.520
I will confess to you that
I thought this is going

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.820
to be the next "In Cold Blood."

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:56.610
This is what I'm going to do.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:12:58.740
I'm going write narrative
nonfiction.

00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.380
I rock this.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.190
And here, here's even
another admission.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.920
I wrote the outline
-- I wrote outline

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.260
for the verdict scene before
the verdict even happened.

00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:12.310
I was that confident
about what was going

00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:13.610
to happen in the trial.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:17.480
I thought that's going to be so
easy because she is so guilty.

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:20.750
Well, you know what
happened next, right?

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:22.900
She was acquitted.

00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:25.530
And boom, my book was killed.

00:13:25.530 --> 00:13:28.440
Publisher called and said, thank
you so much but no thank you.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.770
We don't need that now.

00:13:29.770 --> 00:13:33.070
Thanks for all your
hard work and goodbye.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:34.790
Can you believe that?

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:40.370
Now as the wife of a criminal
defense attorney, I had to say,

00:13:40.370 --> 00:13:42.080
good, you know, the
system worked again.

00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:44.600
That's what's supposed
to happen.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:49.580
But as the rest of me, that
profoundly affected me.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:53.230
That experience profoundly
changed me and here's why.

00:13:53.230 --> 00:13:55.420
I realized a couple of things.

00:13:55.420 --> 00:14:01.580
One, I realized that that jury
had somehow taken a story I

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:07.190
thought I knew and come up
with the exact opposite opinion

00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:08.580
of what had actually happened.

00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:12.390
How could that be that two
sets of facts could be thought

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.190
of in exactly opposite ways.

00:14:15.190 --> 00:14:18.940
How could my way
have been so wrong?

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:21.980
And then and also as affecting,

00:14:21.980 --> 00:14:25.760
I realized that I had been
writing this true crime book

00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.630
from the perspective
that she was guilty.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.840
And I really hadn't
thought about it that way.

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:35.660
I believed she was, so
what I was writing was true

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.250
because it was true for me.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:41.930
Now that was actually kind of
upsetting because, of course,

00:14:41.930 --> 00:14:43.230
I thought I was writing it

00:14:43.230 --> 00:14:45.370
from a perfectly
objective point of view.

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:48.080
And then I thought --
And stay with me here

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:49.380
because this is the brain

00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.490
of someone whose book
had just been killed.

00:14:51.490 --> 00:14:54.580
I thought what if I was right?

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.480
What if I actually had written
the true story, but the jury,

00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.180
based on the evidence that they
had, just disagreed with me.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.570
Could there be two truths?

00:15:05.570 --> 00:15:09.480
And then I realized there are
three sides to every story.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.620
Yours, mine and the truth.

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.940
So the manuscript got
tossed and I chalked that up

00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:18.640
to experience and
my life went on.

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.170
But then, part two happened.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:25.530
My darling husband Jonathan
was the defense attorney

00:15:25.530 --> 00:15:27.330
in a really notorious
murder case

00:15:27.330 --> 00:15:29.960
in Boston, the Bella Bond case.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.260
You may have heard of it.

00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:34.340
It was called "the Baby
Doe trial" for a while

00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:36.960
because they couldn't
identify the body

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.120
of the little girl
whose body was tossed

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:42.870
in Boston harbor
in a garbage bag.

00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:46.090
The night before
closing arguments,

00:15:46.090 --> 00:15:47.840
I listened to Jonathan,
my husband,

00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.110
practice what he would say,
what he would tell the jury.

00:15:52.110 --> 00:15:58.000
And as he told the story, I
nodded in total agreement.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.170
His client, the child's mother's
boyfriend, had been accused

00:16:01.170 --> 00:16:04.700
of the murder, but the facts
as Jonathan told them were

00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:10.050
so compelling and so convincing
and so true, it was so clear

00:16:10.050 --> 00:16:13.210
to me and it was so
evident as Jonathan talked

00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:17.490
that his client was not guilty
at all, absolutely not guilty.

00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:21.670
And I said to him, sweetheart,
this is a slam dunk acquittal.

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:27.330
And then I thought about the
prosecutor's wife, across town,

00:16:27.330 --> 00:16:30.440
sitting at their kitchen
table and she was listening

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:34.280
to her prosecutor husband
give his closing arguments,

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.680
practice his closing arguments.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:42.410
And, of course, in that closing
argument, he'd select the facts

00:16:42.410 --> 00:16:45.570
that would create a
completely different story,

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.870
a story of guilt.

00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:51.090
And did his wife, I wonder,
turn to him and say, oh,

00:16:51.090 --> 00:16:54.190
sweetheart, slam
dunk conviction.

00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:55.490
Did she do that?

00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.050
And how can that be?

00:16:57.050 --> 00:17:01.170
And it was so thought-provoking
to me the question of justice

00:17:01.170 --> 00:17:05.210
and truth and how the same
set of facts can be used

00:17:05.210 --> 00:17:07.360
in two different ways to come

00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:09.930
up with two completely
different stories

00:17:09.930 --> 00:17:13.060
about the same terrible crime.

00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.930
And was either of them true?

00:17:15.930 --> 00:17:21.840
Three sides to every story:
yours, mine and the truth.

00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:25.150
So, here's how my writer
brain worked on that.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:28.070
Could I, I wonder,
write a thriller

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:31.680
where two different people
tell polar opposite stories

00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:35.740
with polar opposite explanations
about the exact same murder,

00:17:35.740 --> 00:17:39.180
using exactly and only
the same facts but come

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:41.690
up with different truths?

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.800
That would be such fun, such
a great challenge to write.

00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:46.100
Wouldn't it?

00:17:46.100 --> 00:17:48.000
It would be so important,
too, I thought,

00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:54.430
to reveal how our biases and
emotions color our truths.

00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:57.160
There's what we're told is true.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.960
There's what we believe is true.

00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:02.120
And then there's the truth.

00:18:02.120 --> 00:18:05.160
And I loved that idea so much.

00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:09.780
So Rubik's cubing all those
all the stuff into my story,

00:18:09.780 --> 00:18:11.830
here's how my writer
brain worked on that.

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:15.200
I have a young magazine
writer, Mercer Hennessey,

00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:18.070
who lives in a suburb of
Boston called Lansdale,

00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:20.090
which I made up.

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:24.650
She's left her burgeoning career
as a journalist to stay home

00:18:24.650 --> 00:18:27.600
with her new young daughter
and her beloved husband.

00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:31.200
She's decided to give up
her career for her family.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:36.150
When there is a tragic accident
and this happens on page one,

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.580
her family is taken away.

00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.270
She is so sad.

00:18:40.270 --> 00:18:41.720
She is so bereaved.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:45.490
She is so full of grief that she
cannot think of a reason to get

00:18:45.490 --> 00:18:47.800
out of bed in the morning.

00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:52.350
She even considers burning down
their house just to be done

00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:54.870
with it all because
life has no meaning

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:57.250
and no reason anymore for her.

00:18:57.250 --> 00:19:03.280
In fact, she starts her
day by writing numbers

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:06.650
in the condensation, the steam
condensation of the mirror

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:09.220
of the bathroom and
as the book open,

00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:13.970
she writes for 442
in the mirror.

00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.450
That's how many days it's been

00:19:15.450 --> 00:19:17.140
since her family
was taken from her.

00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:18.440
That's her ritual.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:23.500
But then as the story opens,
more than a year later,

00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:26.890
Mercer is offered the assignment
that might bring her back

00:19:26.890 --> 00:19:31.440
into the real world, to
write a true crime narrative

00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.510
of a riveting trial about
a gruesome terrible murder.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:41.150
The defendant is a young woman
named Ashlyn Bryant and the book

00:19:41.150 --> 00:19:45.720
that Mercer Hennessey writes
is her personal story as well

00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.550
as the defendant's story and
that becomes the crucial cat

00:19:49.550 --> 00:19:51.800
and mouse of this book.

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:55.250
Who's telling the truth
and what is the truth

00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.870
and how do you write
a true crime novel?

00:19:58.870 --> 00:20:01.340
How do you write a
true crime narrative

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:04.680
if you don't know the truth?

00:20:04.680 --> 00:20:09.540
So Mercer decides to use
all of her reporter skills

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:12.300
to get the story that she wants.

00:20:12.300 --> 00:20:16.350
And is that a good thing
because Mercer has some secrets

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:17.650
of her own?

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.580
I was really honored
to be featured

00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:22.170
on Boston's NPR the other day.

00:20:22.170 --> 00:20:25.910
And the person who interviewed
me on the radio asked me

00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.550
to read a little bit of my
book and I never do that.

00:20:28.550 --> 00:20:32.950
I have never done a seminar or
a session where I actually read

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:37.240
but the cool part was that she
picked the section she wanted me

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.830
to read, very tiny.

00:20:38.830 --> 00:20:40.370
And I was so impressed with that

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.320
that I'm going to
do that now too.

00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.770
First, here's the first page.

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:48.070
It's actually not
the first page.

00:20:48.070 --> 00:20:49.940
It's actually pre-page one.

00:20:49.940 --> 00:20:53.360
So you can sort of get a
sense of how the book feels.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:57.210
This is the beginning
of "Trust Me."

00:20:57.210 --> 00:21:00.990
"Using one forefinger, I write
on the bathroom mirror drawing

00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:04.330
through the steamy
condensation left by the shower.

00:21:04.330 --> 00:21:10.100
This morning's number is 442,
442 days since the car accident

00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:12.000
that destroyed my family,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:15.610
the crash that took
Dex and Sophie from me.

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:18.580
The numbers disintegrate
as I write them.

00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.350
They melt into watery tears
and then they disappear.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:28.910
I would give anything, anything,
I would do anything, longing,

00:21:28.910 --> 00:21:33.940
unbitten hits me hard, unwanted
as I look at my reflection.

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.980
We make these offers every day,

00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.700
filling in our own
personal blanks.

00:21:39.700 --> 00:21:43.440
If you make this happen, we
promise, I'll give up drinking

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:45.420
or speeding, or whatever.

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:48.370
If you give me what I want,
I'll be a better daughter,

00:21:48.370 --> 00:21:52.670
a more reliable husband,
a more devoted wife.

00:21:52.670 --> 00:21:57.550
Make my wish come true
and I'll do anything.

00:21:57.550 --> 00:22:02.090
We bargain, negotiate, make
deals with the universe.

00:22:02.090 --> 00:22:03.980
Eventually, certainly,

00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:07.110
inevitably we'll
get what we want.

00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:10.530
And then the universe
laughs and we are left

00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.280
to bargain with ourselves."

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:17.470
And as the story progresses,
Mercer is covering the trial

00:22:17.470 --> 00:22:21.530
of Ashlyn Bryant and the jury
goes out and she's waiting

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.920
for the verdict and this is a
tiny bit of what happens to her

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:30.310
as she has finished her book
and is waiting for the verdict.

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.520
"Don't you people have a brain,"

00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.010
I yell at the blank
court monitor screen?

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.730
Day five of deliberations
almost over.

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:42.460
No questions, no nothing, not
a peep for five full days.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:45.210
I've sat at my desk writing
like crazy and fueled by coffee

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:46.610
and saltines and wine.

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:47.910
Going nuts.

00:22:47.910 --> 00:22:50.400
What the hell is
that jury doing?

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.990
It means there's a holdout,

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:55.290
one local cable commentator
pontificated this morning.

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.860
You know nothing, I
answered the television.

00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:01.670
There was no proven cause of
death, another suit agreed.

00:23:01.670 --> 00:23:03.050
So the hell what?

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:06.510
I debated him too, jabbing
at him with a finger.

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:09.230
Dead is dead and
it was no accident.

00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:12.000
That child was in a trash bag.

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.250
Moreover, I console myself
eating my salty cracker.

00:23:15.250 --> 00:23:19.660
It's definitely possible that a
guilty verdict is in the making.

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:23.520
Jurors don't want to convict
someone, especially for a crime

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.090
that carries a life
sentence without appearing

00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:29.000
to meticulously consider
all the evidence,

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:33.380
but the guilty verdict
could come any second.

00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:35.990
Jurors took two days
to convict Jodi Arias

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:37.360
of killing an ex-boyfriend,

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.650
four days to convict
the Menendez brothers

00:23:39.650 --> 00:23:42.920
of killing her parents, 11
days to convict Scott Peterson

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:46.230
of killing his wife Laci
and their unborn child.

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:49.660
On the other hand, that
idiot Florida jury only took

00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:52.800
about two hours to
acquit Casey Anthony,

00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:57.740
to acquit O.J. Simpson less
than four hours, four hours.

00:23:57.740 --> 00:24:02.180
So a long deliberation has
to mean a guilty verdict.

00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:06.480
I deeply relished that
Ashlyn must know that too."

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.180
So that's how -- That's
how the book feels.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:11.640
And in writing this book,
let me just tell you,

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:15.230
I tried to find a cat and mouse
passage of the book to read

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.740
so you could see how Ashlyn
and Mercer deal with each other

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:20.480
but there was not one exchange

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.660
that does not give away
a clue in the book.

00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.790
So you'll just have to read that
for yourself and have the fun

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:28.810
of making your own decisions
about who is telling the truth.

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:32.070
And you know, I followed my
own advice, my own realization

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.630
when I was writing this book.

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:35.900
I had no idea who was guilty.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:40.330
I had no idea who was telling
the truth as I type chapter one.

00:24:40.330 --> 00:24:44.500
It was all a surprise and
a pretty amazing one too.

00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:47.790
You know, I don't use an outline
as I'm writing my novels.

00:24:47.790 --> 00:24:50.900
I just start with this one
good idea, what is the essence

00:24:50.900 --> 00:24:53.380
of truth and what about
a cat and mouse game

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:55.540
between a journalist
and a troubled mom.

00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:59.750
And I type chapter one and I
just see what happens next.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.510
So I don't know what happens
until I write the next line

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.350
and the next sentence
and the next paragraph

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:05.650
and the next scene.

00:25:05.650 --> 00:25:07.540
And that's one of the
things that takes me

00:25:07.540 --> 00:25:10.590
to the computer every
day is that I cannot wait

00:25:10.590 --> 00:25:12.230
to see what happens next.

00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:14.320
So when people say, wow,
the ending and trust me,

00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:15.630
that really surprised me.

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.600
I'm like, yeah, wasn't
that a surprise?

00:25:17.600 --> 00:25:19.720
You know, talk about
a surprise ending.

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:23.330
I surprised myself and I
surprise myself every day

00:25:23.330 --> 00:25:25.890
and it's one of the things
that keeps me writing.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.320
Let me ask you, let me ask you,

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.330
are any of you Game
of Thrones fans?

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:31.630
It doesn't -- Yes.

00:25:31.630 --> 00:25:32.930
It doesn't matter if
you say yes or no.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:34.230
But let me tell you this.

00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:36.070
I met the author
George R. R. Martin

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:39.240
at the ThrillerFest Convention
a couple of weeks ago.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:43.330
And after I got over my fan
girl terror, I went up to him

00:25:43.330 --> 00:25:47.380
and I said, "I think
about you every day."

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:51.560
And he's like, "Really?

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:53.170
How come?"

00:25:53.170 --> 00:25:55.190
And I mean, I could've
put a little more artfully

00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:57.810
if I hadn't been so
nervous but okay.

00:25:57.810 --> 00:25:59.540
So I said, here's why.

00:25:59.540 --> 00:26:02.800
I said "because you
are so brave.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.080
You'll do anything
in your novels.

00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:06.500
You'll change everything.

00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:09.410
You'll make the good guys
bad and the bad guys good

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:10.910
and you'll have terrible secrets

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:14.010
and you'll kill anyone,
you'll kill anyone!

00:26:14.010 --> 00:26:17.360
You're not afraid to
take a risk," I told him,

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.060
and that's why when I'm
writing every day I say

00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:22.980
to myself, what would George do.

00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:25.380
Go for it and I'd go for it.

00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:28.980
And he beamed at me and we got
a memorable picture together

00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:30.520
and that's what "Trust Me."

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.140
is. "Trust Me" is big risk.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.280
My other books are series.

00:26:35.280 --> 00:26:39.160
So the reader knows no matter
what happens in those books

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.440
with Jane Ryland as
the main character,

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.960
the reader knows no matter
what happens in those books,

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.770
Jane Ryland is not going to
die, right, because she has

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:49.150
to come back for
books six and seven.

00:26:49.150 --> 00:26:53.110
So the suspense in
the series comes

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.680
from the really interesting
and compelling story

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:57.430
that she is working
on and the murder case

00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:59.010
that she has to solve.

00:26:59.010 --> 00:27:02.880
But your fear is not
that she's going to die.

00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.100
That's as a given.

00:27:06.100 --> 00:27:11.050
But in a standalone like
"Trust Me," it's one and done.

00:27:11.050 --> 00:27:13.510
It's not an exciting,
interesting moment

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:15.330
in somebody's life or career.

00:27:15.330 --> 00:27:18.650
It is the biggest,
most compelling,

00:27:18.650 --> 00:27:22.410
most tectonic plate shifting,
most life-changing thing

00:27:22.410 --> 00:27:24.620
that has ever happened
or will ever happen

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:27.180
to the main characters,
it will ever happen.

00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:28.790
It is one and done.

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:31.370
That's all and anything
could happen.

00:27:31.370 --> 00:27:34.840
So in writing this
standalone, my first,

00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:38.920
that was the revelation,
that anything could happen.

00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.990
Every card could
be put on the table

00:27:41.990 --> 00:27:44.620
and some shock the
heck out of me.

00:27:44.620 --> 00:27:46.380
Anyone can be guilty.

00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:47.870
Anyone could lie.

00:27:47.870 --> 00:27:50.660
And anyone could die
because nobody has

00:27:50.660 --> 00:27:53.220
to come back for book two.

00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:57.590
Right? Booklist Starred Review
just called it a knockout,

00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:59.910
first-rate psychological
suspense

00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.220
and wonderful reviewer Lisa
Holstein [assumed spelling],

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:05.590
a fabulous librarian,
called it this, she says,

00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:08.950
"It's this summer's "Gone
Girl," but I like it better."

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:10.250
So that's good.

00:28:10.250 --> 00:28:12.500
I mean, that's good.

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.830
You know, I'm really
the poster child

00:28:14.830 --> 00:28:16.720
for following your
dreams in midlife.

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.380
I didn't start writing
thrillers,

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:22.120
I didn't start writing
fiction until I was 55,

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.970
which was 13 years ago.

00:28:26.970 --> 00:28:31.400
And I really at a time when
I had a wonderful career

00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:35.220
as a television reporter, I'd
had some success and age 55.

00:28:35.220 --> 00:28:37.450
Sometimes when people
say, well that's fine,

00:28:37.450 --> 00:28:38.840
you've had a great life.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.460
Sit back, rest on your
whatever laurels and just relax.

00:28:42.460 --> 00:28:45.140
But that little girl
in the hayloft wanted

00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:49.230
to write mysteries and I wanted
to do it and I wanted to feel

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:52.390
like that and I'm
really the living proof

00:28:52.390 --> 00:28:54.700
that it's never too late
to follow your dreams

00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:56.720
about what you want to do.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:01.540
And if you take nothing from
this morning, except my book,

00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:06.630
which is out now, if you take --
Okay, that was cheap, wasn't it?

00:29:06.630 --> 00:29:08.440
But if you take nothing
from this morning,

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:11.810
I want you to understand
to think about what it is

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:13.690
that you'd like to do.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:16.950
Did you want to write a novel
or write narrative nonfiction

00:29:16.950 --> 00:29:20.110
or write a book of poetry or
put together that recipe book

00:29:20.110 --> 00:29:23.430
that your family has been
clamoring for or teach someone

00:29:23.430 --> 00:29:26.740
to read or do something
good or take a trip

00:29:26.740 --> 00:29:29.880
or learn a new language or
explore your life, somehow?

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.760
I'm the prove that it's
never too late to do that.

00:29:32.760 --> 00:29:35.160
Do you know the Stephen
Sondheim musical,

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.600
"Sunday in the Park
with George."

00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.900
You know that.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:39.900
It's a fabulous musical

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:42.910
about the French impressionist
pointillist painter

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:44.530
Georges Seurat.

00:29:44.530 --> 00:29:48.570
And there's a scene in this --
There's a scene in this musical

00:29:48.570 --> 00:29:52.620
where the Seurat character comes
out on the stage by himself

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:54.500
and he has a blank sketchpad.

00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:58.830
And on the sketchpad,
he draws a hat.

00:29:58.830 --> 00:30:04.070
And he looks at the sketchpad
and says, "Look, I made a hat

00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:06.660
where there never was a hat."

00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:10.830
And it's this realization
that he has created something

00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:13.030
out of nothing and he
sings a song about it,

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:19.650
which I will not sing, a song
about creativity and a song

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:22.530
about imagination and
a song about how we

00:30:22.530 --> 00:30:25.820
as human beings are the only
creatures who can do that.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:28.810
We're the only ones who can
make something out of nothing

00:30:28.810 --> 00:30:31.190
but our own imagination
and our own compulsion

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:33.570
and our own session
and our own creativity

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.330
and our own brainpower.

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:38.320
We can make art and music
and poetry and literature.

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.690
We're the only creatures
who can do that

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:42.080
and that's what I do
every day at my computer.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:43.640
I'm making hats.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.070
I'm making new hats.

00:30:46.070 --> 00:30:49.330
I'm making new worlds that
only I can create that come

00:30:49.330 --> 00:30:51.580
out of nothing but
my own imagination

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.010
and then you can meet
Mercer and Ashland,

00:30:54.010 --> 00:30:56.900
characters who I have created

00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.540
and who become real
because of that.

00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:03.820
That is the astonishing
power of creativity.

00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.520
And we embrace it.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:09.420
It is my dream to live in this
world of books and learning

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:13.000
and writing and creativity.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.910
When I finished "Trust Me," I
called my husband into the room

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:22.210
and I said, "Sweetheart,
watch this."

00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:27.370
And I typed "the end" and
then I burst into tears.

00:31:27.370 --> 00:31:31.120
I burst into tears because I
knew no matter what happened

00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:33.860
after that, I had taken a risk.

00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.320
I had written this book
that I wanted to write.

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.120
I had done something important.

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.420
I had done something big.

00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.720
I had done something different.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:43.080
And I had followed my dream.

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:47.360
But of course, I shouldn't have
burst into tears when I typed

00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:50.180
"the end" because it
wasn't the end it all.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:53.540
It was the beginning of this
wonderful new second half

00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:55.390
of my life and career.

00:31:55.390 --> 00:31:58.150
And I'm so pleased that
you came here today

00:31:58.150 --> 00:31:59.520
to share that with me.

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:00.820
Thank you so much [applause].

00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:02.620
Oh my goodness, thank you.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:10.700
[ Applause ]

00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:12.000
Thank you.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.400
I'm very honored to be here.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.190
This is quite fantastic.

00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.650
We do have time for questions,
if you have any questions.

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:21.200
Do not ask why my name is Hank.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:24.440
That's, you know, I
cannot talk about that.

00:32:24.440 --> 00:32:27.670
Yes. Oh, he's going to
ask why my name is Hank.

00:32:27.670 --> 00:32:28.970
I knew it.

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:30.270
Okay.

00:32:30.270 --> 00:32:32.940
&gt;&gt; No. I'm going to
follow up on your request

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:34.420
that we use our imagination.

00:32:34.420 --> 00:32:42.250
When I was on Capitol
Hill, I worked on a law

00:32:42.250 --> 00:32:45.160
to get the foreign bank account
question on the tax return.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:49.430
That's the question Paul
Manafort answered dishonestly.

00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:51.680
But there's a great
story behind it

00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:54.600
and it involves wealthy
business people.

00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.880
It involves the Chicago
mob, the Cleveland mob,

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:02.820
equal opportunity prostitutes,
one's Caucasian, one's Latin.

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.230
But there's a lot of impediments
to my writing that book.

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:12.640
First of all, my writing is all
legal briefs and I can't write,

00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.750
I can't write dialogue.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.500
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi Ryan:
Let me ask you about this.

00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.550
So you're writing a book about
your experiences on Capitol Hill

00:33:20.550 --> 00:33:24.800
with the really complicated
world of banking and finances

00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.720
and that's -- You have
a very special thing

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.540
and I promise I'll
get to your question.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.340
We all have a very
special thing.

00:33:32.340 --> 00:33:34.550
Any of us who wants to write
a book or even who thinks

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:38.180
about that a little bit in
their head, you know something

00:33:38.180 --> 00:33:39.500
that nobody else knows.

00:33:39.500 --> 00:33:42.930
You know things that are special
and you have to ask yourself,

00:33:42.930 --> 00:33:45.680
and I ask myself this
every day as I'm writing.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.490
Why do I care about this?

00:33:47.490 --> 00:33:50.390
Why do I care about this
because if I don't care,

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:51.840
the reader won't care.

00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:53.690
How do I make the reader care?

00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:56.320
So if I had to give
you advice about how

00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.960
to write a complicated
book and you say, oh,

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.110
I can't write dialogue and I
don't know how to, you know,

00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:03.200
it's a very complicated topic,
I say yeah, isn't that great?

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:07.840
Sit down at your computer
and type chapter one

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:11.000
and see what story
you're telling.

00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.280
And at every moment ask
yourself why is this important,

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.220
what difference does it make

00:34:16.220 --> 00:34:20.190
and how can I advance the
story and what is my goal.

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.660
Don't worry about -- I
mean, it's interesting

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:25.880
because the idea of writing a
novel is incredibly daunting.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.570
You know, you sit at your
computer and you think,

00:34:27.570 --> 00:34:29.750
I have to write a novel.

00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:31.370
This is impossible.

00:34:31.370 --> 00:34:32.920
But you're writing a page.

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:34.620
You're writing a paragraph.

00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:35.920
Just try that.

00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:39.300
Tell yourself I'm just
going to write one paragraph

00:34:39.300 --> 00:34:40.780
and then I'm going to get up.

00:34:40.780 --> 00:34:42.590
See if you can do that
and I bet you can.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:46.030
And after you write that one
paragraph, write another one.

00:34:46.030 --> 00:34:48.130
And then when you get
your first draft done,

00:34:48.130 --> 00:34:50.110
worry about making the
dialogue better and worry

00:34:50.110 --> 00:34:52.840
about the plot holes
and worry about all that

00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.790
but you can't write a book
by just thinking about it.

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.230
Dennis Lehane always
talks, says that he thinks

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.970
about writing his novel so much

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:04.130
that when he comes home he can't
understand why the manuscript

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:08.520
isn't longer because it feels
like he's been working on it.

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.820
So that's what I would say.

00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:11.120
&gt;&gt; Is it possible to work

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:14.270
with an author that's
a published author

00:35:14.270 --> 00:35:16.540
that can make this
into a real story?

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:17.840
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi Ryan:
Is it possible to work

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.330
with a published author that
could make it into a story?

00:35:20.330 --> 00:35:22.540
Is just a casual question?

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:26.990
We'll talk afterwards.

00:35:26.990 --> 00:35:30.270
Only you can write the
story that you can write.

00:35:30.270 --> 00:35:34.480
There are writing teachers and
there are editors and we'll talk

00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.950
after this program is over.

00:35:35.950 --> 00:35:37.250
Sounds like a good book.

00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:38.550
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:35:38.550 --> 00:35:39.860
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi Ryan: See, you
know, there's always something.

00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.160
Yes?

00:35:41.160 --> 00:35:44.480
&gt;&gt; Hello. I'm a college student
and I'm also really interested

00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:46.210
in writing these three novels
and there are like a lot

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:47.940
of things that you said
and I'm like, oh yeah!

00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.450
This is the same thing.

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:54.420
So from the more experienced
perspective, what was one

00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:58.530
or more things that you
learned about writing mysteries

00:35:58.530 --> 00:36:00.420
as you wrote a lot of mysteries

00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:03.250
that you maybe didn't
know when you started?

00:36:03.250 --> 00:36:04.550
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi Ryan: What
are some things I learned

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:05.850
about writing mysteries

00:36:05.850 --> 00:36:07.150
that I may not have
known when I started?

00:36:07.150 --> 00:36:09.660
You know what really
the big thing is?

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:15.740
How difficult it is and how full
of self-doubt every writer is.

00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:18.690
I mean you heard Annie
Proulx last night, said --

00:36:18.690 --> 00:36:20.930
Annie Proulx stood up
on the stage and said,

00:36:20.930 --> 00:36:23.210
"I don't really feel
like a writer."

00:36:23.210 --> 00:36:24.550
And I thought, wow, you know,

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:27.700
if she has doubts,
everybody has doubts.

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:31.780
Tess Gerritsen once told me,
"With every book I hand in,

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:33.180
I wonder if this is the one

00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:35.120
where people will
realize I'm a fraud

00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:37.060
and I don't really
know what I'm doing."

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:38.360
Tess Gerritsen!

00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:42.210
So you are -- If you
don't have doubts,

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:44.540
you're probably not
being very realistic

00:36:44.540 --> 00:36:46.210
about what you're writing.

00:36:46.210 --> 00:36:49.670
And if you think, wow,
this is very difficult,

00:36:49.670 --> 00:36:51.530
then pat yourself on the back

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.250
because that means
you're working hard.

00:36:53.250 --> 00:36:54.740
That means you're a writer.

00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.420
Pat yourself on the
back for going for it.

00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.550
The thing that will
stop any writer is

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:03.520
that just depressing
darkness of worry

00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:05.230
that you're not good enough.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:08.420
You know, that's
-- Don't do that.

00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:09.930
Just throw that away.

00:37:09.930 --> 00:37:12.880
Just go for it because you'll
never know what book you have

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.250
until you do it.

00:37:14.250 --> 00:37:17.750
And worrying isn't going to
make it happen any faster

00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:20.250
and it will make your
life be much more dismal.

00:37:20.250 --> 00:37:22.490
So embrace your writing.

00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:24.100
Go for it and don't worry.

00:37:24.100 --> 00:37:25.940
It will turn out
fine, I promise.

00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:27.240
It's a Hank promise.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:29.610
It will turn out fine.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:32.310
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:33.610
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi Ryan: Yes?

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:37.730
&gt;&gt; Hello. As just considering
from a writing perspective,

00:37:37.730 --> 00:37:42.760
do you think it would be better
or advantageous to be living

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.160
with a prosecutor versus
a defense attorney?

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.850
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi Ryan: Do
I think it would be better

00:37:48.850 --> 00:37:51.580
to be living with a
prosecutor or defense attorney,

00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.630
from the standpoint
of writing a novel?

00:37:53.630 --> 00:37:56.330
Yes. Two hilarious
things about that

00:37:56.330 --> 00:37:58.100
and that is the funniest
question I've ever heard

00:37:58.100 --> 00:38:00.160
and you'll hear why.

00:38:00.160 --> 00:38:04.090
One is I can't write
in the morning.

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:05.390
You know, I have
colleagues who get

00:38:05.390 --> 00:38:07.140
up at the crack of
dawn and write.

00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:10.510
And if I did that, if I got
up at 5 to start writing,

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:13.600
you'd find me at like
5:05 with my head clumped

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:15.890
against the computer,
like dead asleep.

00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:19.740
Lee Child said, "Nothing good
ever happens before noon."

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:22.710
And that's sort of how
I feel about writing.

00:38:22.710 --> 00:38:26.420
But in my books -- I'm an
investigative reporter,

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:28.530
as you know, and my husband
is a criminal defense attorney

00:38:28.530 --> 00:38:30.280
and so there are
times in my books,

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.000
which are somewhat
legal oriented,

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.750
they're not legal thrillers
but they live in that world,

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:38.310
where there's a legal
question that I have.

00:38:38.310 --> 00:38:41.260
And for some reason, I always
come up with this question

00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.640
that I need to know
what the prosecutor say

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:45.120
or what would the
rule be about this

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.600
or how could a judge do that.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.190
It always sort of happens
about 3 in the afternoon,

00:38:49.190 --> 00:38:51.750
that's sort of the writing
cycle, so I call my husband

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.110
at the office and I
say, hi, sweetheart.

00:38:54.110 --> 00:38:57.100
It's me with a legal
question of the day.

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:00.180
And then -- And so it's really
great to be living with a lawyer

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:02.110
to have my own in-house counsel.

00:39:02.110 --> 00:39:04.220
That's really helpful.

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.090
But the prosecutor or defense
attorney, my new novel,

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:11.160
which I guess I can tell you
the name of, which I sent,

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:13.830
I hit send yesterday on it.

00:39:13.830 --> 00:39:17.840
Can you believe [applause],
which was pretty great,

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:22.540
at 11:58 PM because it was due,
you know it was due by midnight.

00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:26.750
It's called "The
Murder List" and it is

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:31.110
about a young law student who
was caught between her husband,

00:39:31.110 --> 00:39:34.550
a defense attorney, and
her boss, a prosecutor.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:37.950
So you'll have to read that book
to find out which is better.

00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:44.500
Law is all about knowing the
rules and which side you choose,

00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:47.370
both sides think they're
the side of justice.

00:39:47.370 --> 00:39:49.170
So it just depends
on how you think.

00:39:49.170 --> 00:39:51.210
We have a couple minutes.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:52.510
Yes?

00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:57.940
&gt;&gt; Hi. What would you -- What
would be your advice to me,

00:39:57.940 --> 00:40:01.300
I have someone very close me
who's writing a science fiction

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:05.280
book and has asked me
to read it, edit it,

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.970
give me your opinion, and
I just hate it [laughter].

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:12.970
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi
Ryan: Oh, yeah!

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:15.250
Welcome to the world of having
a friend who's a writer.

00:40:15.250 --> 00:40:17.940
You're asking -- You have
a friend who wrote a book

00:40:17.940 --> 00:40:19.240
and you just really
don't like it.

00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.610
Is she or he here?

00:40:20.610 --> 00:40:24.300
&gt;&gt; No. Might watch C-SPAN.

00:40:24.300 --> 00:40:26.460
I don't know.

00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:27.760
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi Ryan: Okay.

00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:33.420
So there is always something
good to be said about a book,

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:37.450
even if it is "what a
great idea that is."

00:40:37.450 --> 00:40:39.020
You don't have to
finish with, wow,

00:40:39.020 --> 00:40:44.310
but you really didn't do
a very good job with that.

00:40:44.310 --> 00:40:46.680
You can tell what
you really think,

00:40:46.680 --> 00:40:49.210
I didn't understand this part,
I didn't understand that part,

00:40:49.210 --> 00:40:51.170
but, wow, what a good idea.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:54.840
You're going to -- You
know, when you read reviews

00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:58.380
and somebody says five stars
and somebody says one star

00:40:58.380 --> 00:41:00.390
and it's the same
book, you know,

00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:01.960
you realize that there's room

00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.010
for many different
opinions in the world.

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:06.880
And some -- You know, my husband
and I can read the same book

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.900
and I love it and
he doesn't love it.

00:41:08.900 --> 00:41:10.850
So it's okay not to like it.

00:41:10.850 --> 00:41:14.080
And she or he is your friend,
tell them something good

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:15.660
about the book and point them

00:41:15.660 --> 00:41:17.250
with some constructive
criticism,

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:20.500
perhaps about what you
thought could be better,

00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:24.190
like I didn't really know
where this was taking place,

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:27.290
that would be a good thing.

00:41:27.290 --> 00:41:31.250
So it's a dilemma and you're a
good pal for caring about it.

00:41:31.250 --> 00:41:32.980
Thank you very good question.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.280
Last question.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:36.160
We have like a minute,
I think, two?

00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:37.460
Two minutes.

00:41:37.460 --> 00:41:39.190
So you get to have some of it.

00:41:39.190 --> 00:41:40.490
&gt;&gt; Sorry. I'm really nervous.

00:41:40.490 --> 00:41:42.010
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi Ryan:
No, don't be nervous.

00:41:42.010 --> 00:41:46.040
&gt;&gt; I have a couple novels
that I'm trying to finish

00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:48.770
because I can never seem
to let the characters go.

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:50.860
How do you know when
to end a novel?

00:41:50.860 --> 00:41:52.530
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi Ryan: How do
you know when to end a novel?

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:54.360
She's saying that she's
written a couple of novels

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:56.610
and she can never let
the characters go.

00:41:56.610 --> 00:42:01.550
I know exactly when I'm finished

00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:04.920
and that is kind
of a magical thing.

00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:07.720
You know how you revise
and you revise and revise

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.180
and you're looking
at every word,

00:42:11.180 --> 00:42:13.080
and I do that so passionately

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.210
because revision
is the ballgame.

00:42:16.210 --> 00:42:18.460
Every first draft is terrible.

00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.470
And then you work on it and work
on it and work on it and try

00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:24.240
to find the book in there
that you are really writing.

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.850
And I remember with
"Trust Me" it happened.

00:42:27.850 --> 00:42:32.820
I was doing a revision and I
was reading along and I forgot

00:42:32.820 --> 00:42:34.710
that I wrote the book.

00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:38.290
I realized that I was
just reading this story

00:42:38.290 --> 00:42:40.640
and not trying to fix it anymore

00:42:40.640 --> 00:42:43.380
and that's how I
knew it was done.

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:46.140
You're telling a story with
a beginning, middle and end.

00:42:46.140 --> 00:42:47.440
Is it good?

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:48.740
Is it compelling?

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:50.040
When you read it,
do you love it?

00:42:50.040 --> 00:42:52.040
If you love it , then your
readers will love it too.

00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:54.600
And then just stop and
put it out in the world.

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.120
Don't keep that book a secret.

00:42:58.120 --> 00:43:00.640
Share that and let
your book live.

00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.800
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:04.100
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi
Ryan: Of course.

00:43:04.100 --> 00:43:06.070
Last question, real fast.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:07.510
&gt;&gt; You're a journalist.

00:43:07.510 --> 00:43:10.510
I'm a producer in TV news.

00:43:10.510 --> 00:43:13.850
You're looking for the
truth in your journalism,

00:43:13.850 --> 00:43:17.630
how do not get bogged down
in trying to respect facts

00:43:17.630 --> 00:43:20.310
and the truth when you're
writing something that's not

00:43:20.310 --> 00:43:21.730
true, a fiction?

00:43:21.730 --> 00:43:25.860
How do you not get bogged down
in trying to respect one part

00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.010
of you and working
on the other part?

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:29.310
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi Ryan:
How do I get bogged

00:43:29.310 --> 00:43:30.610
down in writing fiction --

00:43:30.610 --> 00:43:31.910
&gt;&gt; Not get bogged down.

00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:33.210
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi Ryan:
Not get bogged down?

00:43:33.210 --> 00:43:34.510
How do I get bogged down,
I can really tell you that.

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:36.900
How do I not get bogged
down in the facts?

00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:39.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah and trying to respect
the facts in your research

00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:41.290
when you're writing fiction.

00:43:41.290 --> 00:43:43.210
&gt;&gt; Hank Phillippi Ryan:
You know, when I research,

00:43:43.210 --> 00:43:47.150
I put it all in my head and
then I just don't ever look

00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:48.970
at the research notebooks again.

00:43:48.970 --> 00:43:52.290
I just sort of consume this
information and put myself

00:43:52.290 --> 00:43:56.050
in a place that I want the book
to be and then I just write it.

00:43:56.050 --> 00:44:00.790
So fiction is different, so
different from doing journalism.

00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:03.490
So I try to just relax
and let the book come

00:44:03.490 --> 00:44:06.240
out the best way that it can be.

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:10.480
It's fun. My job is to take
a really complicated bunch

00:44:10.480 --> 00:44:14.090
of stuff and make it
into a fascinating story

00:44:14.090 --> 00:44:16.710
and that's what I
try to do every day.

00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:18.290
I am getting the wrap-up sign.

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.590
Thank you so much.

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.540
Let me just say, remember
the last time you went

00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:27.550
to the library and you pulled
out a book and you looked at it.

00:44:27.550 --> 00:44:30.380
Think about the author
when you do that.

00:44:30.380 --> 00:44:34.230
When you go to a library and
select a book and take it home

00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:38.100
with you, you have
made an author happy

00:44:38.100 --> 00:44:40.870
and I'm very grateful to
be part of that world.

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:47.250
Thank you so much for coming
here today [applause].
