00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.460
Hey guys, welcome back to the lab, today I thought it would be fun to see

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.960
what would happen if we tried putting slime in a vacuum chamber.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.940
But not just any kind of slime, rainbow slime!

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.600
This experiment was requested in the comments by Eric Moore.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.100
Eric, thanks for your suggestion, you're about to become $25 richer.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.780
I've mixed up a special concoction in each one of these glasses

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.700
and I have another container here with a saturated solution

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.160
and if you've seen some of my previous videos you'll know exactly how this works.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.020
So let's pour the solutions together and see what happens.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.260
Ooh, it just gets thick and chunky so fast.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:36.720
Insta-slime!

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.320
There's not much that's cooler than that.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.820
(laughs)

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.360
Cool

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.040
I'ts working out pretty well.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.980
Wow, those levels are very consistent

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.020
Yeah!

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.420
Just going to dump out a little of the excess water.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.400
If there is any.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.060
Ha! That sounds awsome.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.540
It's amazing, there's like no left over water.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.460
What a mess. (laughs)

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.200
This is looking very good. We've got all different colors of slime.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.940
Now, if you take a very close look at them you can see the slime is filled with bubbles

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.900
that was whipped into them when we  were stirring them up.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.060
So this is going to be very interesting to see now when we put them in a vacuum chamber

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.420
because as we suck the air out of the chamber these bubbles should expand and make for a really cool effect.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.340
Kinda what I'm thinking here is we'll just take the slime

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.780
and pack them into sections and see if we can make like a multi-rainbow colored effect.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.200
and then stick the vacuum chamber lid on top

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.140
and press play

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.300
There we go.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.240
We'll start

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.340
with that on one side.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.080
Okay we'll go orange next.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.880
Yeah!

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.560
So if you're watching this video you probably should have a jello cup on hand.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:02.380
Sweet!

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:03.520
That's kind of shiny,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.380
it's nice, I like that.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.920
Oops we gotta make room for the blue,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.280
before it spreads out you gotta work quick!

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.060
There we go.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.260
Cool.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.380
This is the moment, right now when we find out what our slime will do in a vacuum chamber.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.380
Here we go. Let's rock!

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.320
Immediately you can see little bubbles popping out of the top.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.220
And it looks like all of the slime is actually rising.

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.660
It's pretty much doubled in height there. That's cool.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.320
Ohh my goodness.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.600
Ohh my goodness, look at it go! Look at it go!

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.120
WHAT?!

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.400
Ahh, I had to turn it off because it was getting too high.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.620
That's crazy! It's turned into like -

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.120
It looks like that gel from diapers, colored gel.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.100
Here we go for round 2.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.000
Oh that's so cool. It looks like clown hair, doesn't it?

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.900
I'm gonna let in a little air. Oop!

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.320
Man, it doesn't take much to set that back in.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.380
Yeah, it's amazing the way it deflates, it turns back to like this chunky gel

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.260
and then it liquefies back into a slime. That's very cool.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.520
I'll try letting it in slowly this time.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.700
WOW!

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.860
Okay, we have made a rainbow mess all over this thing.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.860
You know what would be cool is if we keep cycling it to the point where all the bubbles actually get sucked out.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.080
I'm not sure if that is gonna happen though cause I think all of the glue is keeping those bubbles.

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.200
And just actually maybe even making billions more bubbles.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.480
I mean, look at that! It's like a foam!

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.420
You know what's interesting though is that we can't really get the bubbles popping.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.480
And this has increased to like at least 10 times its height. It filled up the entire jar.

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.000
And it could go higher, I'm sure.

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:53.000
Look around here, you got like all of the different colors of the rainbow. In gel!

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.300
Yeah, look at the side walls here! That has made such a cool-looking mess!

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:58.560
I love it!

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.900
You know what this kinda reminds me of, is a snowcone.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.800
It looks like colored snow!

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:06.960
WOW!

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.200
That had an audible 'thunk' when I let the air back in!

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.140
It was like a "WHOOF"!

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.900
It's amazing how grainy the slime looks

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.140
after you let the air back in.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.780
Until it melds back into a slimy texture it almost looks kinda gritty!

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.040
Oh wow look at this on the side here! Look at this on the side!

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:23.900
It almost looks like ice crystals!

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.380
It's like a rainbow ice palace.

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.640
It's even sucking the color out of the slime

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:31.500
and just leaving behind this white, gelly residue.

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.900
And then the color comes back.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.100
Oh, that's amazing.

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.760
So I just shut off my vacuum pump but by keeping this valve closed we can actually maintain our vaccum pressure there.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.180
Now we've run this thing through about 20 cycles

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.140
and I can't seem to get it to the point where it sucks out all of the air bubbles

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:50.240
it seems like it just hits this state where it is a perpetual foam

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.560
that doesn't really rise very quickly anymore.

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.380
So at this point I'm just going to let the air back in

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:57.980
so we can see what happens to the slime after the vacuum chamber experience.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:01.980
That's so cool.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:03.300
Like...

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.440
Oh wow check this out.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.540
We just made rainbow squishy bath.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.220
Yeah, you can see already after about 30 seconds it's starting to slime back together.

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:17.360
What's really interesting is that I can still see a ton of bubbles in there.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.520
They're just so tiny,

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:20.080
but there's lots of them, look!

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.300
Okay, so I'm gonna try and scoop this stuff out.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.360
Oh, that's cool.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:26.360
Oh, look at that!

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.360
It just like pulls right off the container.

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.640
BOOM!

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.680
(laughs)

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.080
Here we go!

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.160
So there you have it guys, now you know what slime will do inside of a vacuum chamber.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:46.960
Very cool experiment, very fun

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.480
and makes one heck of a mess.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.840

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.580
That looks like something inappropriate.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:05.940
