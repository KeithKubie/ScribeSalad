00:00:00.837 --> 00:00:02.272
- [Instructor] Emelia
registers vehicles for

00:00:02.272 --> 00:00:04.530
the Department of Transportation.

00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.527
Sports utility vehicles,
also known as SUVs,

00:00:07.527 --> 00:00:11.736
make up 12% of the vehicles she registers.

00:00:11.736 --> 00:00:15.046
Let V be the number of vehicles Emelia

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:19.213
registers in a day until
she first registers an SUV.

00:00:21.049 --> 00:00:25.093
Assume the type of each
vehicle is independent.

00:00:25.093 --> 00:00:28.118
Find the probability that Emelia registers

00:00:28.118 --> 00:00:30.810
more than four, more than four,

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.893
vehicles before she registers an SUV.

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:36.837
So, let's just first think about

00:00:36.837 --> 00:00:39.349
what this random variable V is.

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:43.173
So, it's the number of vehicles
Emelia registers in a day,

00:00:43.173 --> 00:00:45.423
until she registers an SUV.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.836
So, for example if the
first person who walks

00:00:48.836 --> 00:00:50.668
in the line or through the door,

00:00:50.668 --> 00:00:52.790
has an SUV and they're
trying to register it,

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.666
then V would be equal to one.

00:00:54.666 --> 00:00:56.513
If the first person isn't an SUV,

00:00:56.513 --> 00:00:59.399
but the second person is,
then V would be equal to two,

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.967
so forth and so on.

00:01:00.967 --> 00:01:03.707
So, this right over here
is a classic geometric

00:01:03.707 --> 00:01:06.457
random variable, right over here.

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.431
So, geometric random variable.

00:01:10.431 --> 00:01:14.539
We have a very clear success
metric for each trial.

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:16.817
Do we have a SUV or not?

00:01:16.817 --> 00:01:19.341
Each trial is independent,
they tell us that.

00:01:19.341 --> 00:01:20.783
They are independent.

00:01:20.783 --> 00:01:23.308
The probability of success
in each trial is constant.

00:01:23.308 --> 00:01:27.268
We have a 12% success for each new person

00:01:27.268 --> 00:01:28.962
who comes through the line.

00:01:28.962 --> 00:01:31.857
Now the reason this is not
a binomial random variable,

00:01:31.857 --> 00:01:35.372
is that we do not have a
finite number of trials.

00:01:35.372 --> 00:01:38.058
Here, we're gonna keep performing trials.

00:01:38.058 --> 00:01:40.814
We're gonna keep serving
people in the line,

00:01:40.814 --> 00:01:42.481
until we get an SUV.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.690
And so, what we have over here,

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:48.668
when they say find the probability

00:01:48.668 --> 00:01:50.543
that Emelia registers
more than four vehicles

00:01:50.543 --> 00:01:52.186
before she registers an SUV.

00:01:52.186 --> 00:01:56.353
This is the probability
that V is greater than four.

00:01:58.011 --> 00:01:59.922
So, I encourage you like always,

00:01:59.922 --> 00:02:02.467
pause this video and see
if you can work through it.

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:04.819
And we're gonna assume, she's
not just gonna leave her,

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:07.491
I guess her desk, or wherever the things

00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:09.096
are being registered.

00:02:09.096 --> 00:02:10.267
She's not going to leave the counter

00:02:10.267 --> 00:02:14.034
until someone shows up registering an SUV.

00:02:14.034 --> 00:02:17.944
So, we will just keep looking at people,

00:02:17.944 --> 00:02:20.182
I guess we could say over
multiple days, forever.

00:02:20.182 --> 00:02:22.532
She'll work for an
infinite number of years,

00:02:22.532 --> 00:02:24.188
just for the sake of this problem,

00:02:24.188 --> 00:02:27.364
until an SUV actually shows up.

00:02:27.364 --> 00:02:29.127
So, try to figure this out.

00:02:29.127 --> 00:02:31.274
Alright, I'm assuming you've had a go

00:02:31.274 --> 00:02:33.584
and some of you might said,
well, isn't this going to be

00:02:33.584 --> 00:02:36.345
equal to the probability
that V is equal to five,

00:02:36.345 --> 00:02:39.910
plus the probability
that V is equal to six,

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.953
plus the probability
that V is equal to seven,

00:02:42.953 --> 00:02:45.544
and it just goes on and on and on forever.

00:02:45.544 --> 00:02:47.557
And this is actually true.

00:02:47.557 --> 00:02:49.325
And you say, well, how
do I calculate this?

00:02:49.325 --> 00:02:51.786
I'm just summing up an
infinite number of things.

00:02:51.786 --> 00:02:55.953
Now the key realization here,
is that one way to think

00:02:57.042 --> 00:03:00.593
about the probability that
V is greater than four,

00:03:00.593 --> 00:03:03.100
is this is the same
thing as the probability

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.517
that V is not less than or equal to four,

00:03:12.088 --> 00:03:14.681
these two things are equivalent.

00:03:14.681 --> 00:03:16.645
So, what's the probability that V

00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:19.701
is not less than or equal to four?

00:03:19.701 --> 00:03:21.851
This might be a slightly easier
thing for you to calculate.

00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:22.943
Once again, pause the
video and see if you can

00:03:22.943 --> 00:03:24.246
figure it out.

00:03:24.246 --> 00:03:27.134
Well what's the probability
that V is not less than

00:03:27.134 --> 00:03:28.411
or equal to four?

00:03:28.411 --> 00:03:31.575
Well that's the same thing
as the probability of

00:03:31.575 --> 00:03:35.742
first four customers, or
first four, I guess people.

00:03:38.186 --> 00:03:41.718
First four, I'll say customers,
or I'll say first four cars.

00:03:41.718 --> 00:03:44.218
The customer's cars, not SUVs.

00:03:46.647 --> 00:03:48.792
So, this one is feeling
pretty straightforward.

00:03:48.792 --> 00:03:52.041
What's the probability that
for each customer she goes to,

00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:53.480
that they're not an SUV?

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.647
Well that's one minus
12%, or 88%, or 0.88.

00:03:58.577 --> 00:04:00.158
And if we want to know the probability

00:04:00.158 --> 00:04:02.158
of the first four cars are not SUVs.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:05.648
Well that's 0.88 to the fourth power.

00:04:05.648 --> 00:04:07.195
And so that's all we have to calculate.

00:04:07.195 --> 00:04:09.866
And so let's get our calculator out.

00:04:09.866 --> 00:04:13.030
And say I'm going to get, oops.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.186
I'm going to get 0.88 and
I'm going to raise it to

00:04:17.186 --> 00:04:19.278
the fourth power and I get,

00:04:19.278 --> 00:04:22.346
and I'm just going to round it to,

00:04:22.346 --> 00:04:25.127
the nearest, let's see, do
they tell me to round it?

00:04:25.127 --> 00:04:29.643
Okay, I'll just round it to
the nearest, I guess 100th,

00:04:29.643 --> 00:04:32.560
well, I'll just write it as 0.5997.

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.103
Is approximately equal to, 0.5997.

00:04:42.497 --> 00:04:44.585
If you wanted to write
this as a percentage

00:04:44.585 --> 00:04:47.752
it would be approximately 59.97%.

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:52.109
So a little bit better than half,

00:04:52.109 --> 00:04:55.545
than a 50% shot, a little
less than a two-thirds shot,

00:04:55.545 --> 00:04:59.540
that she is going to have to
see more than four customers

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.373
until she sees an SUV.
