00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.260
If rainbows are during the day and moonbows
are at night, why don't they call daybows...

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.810
something else?

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:12.790
Hey everyone, Trace here for a DNews.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:14.559
Aren’t rainbows just beautiful?

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.290
We typically think of them as daytime occurrences,
but believe it or not, moonbows, also known

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:20.640
as lunar rainbows, appear at night!

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.040
Before we get into the nitty gritty on moonbows,
though, we should probably explain regular

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.010
daytime rainbows...

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:30.410
Rainbows appear when sunlight passes through
water droplets in the air.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.620
The sun produces white light, which, as you
know, is actually a combination of all the

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.690
possible colors.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.820
The water droplets act like glass prisms,
bending the light as it passes through them

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.740
separating white into its component parts,
creating a rainbow!

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.740
ROYGBIV!

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.430
Red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo,
and violet.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.180
The water in the air can be from recent rainfall,
or say, mist from nearby waterfalls.

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.239
But to make a rainbow the sunlight needs to
hit the raindrops at about a 42 degree angle

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.600
for red light, and 40 for violet.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.600
And double rainbows are simply reflecting
the light through the raindrops more than

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.600
once!

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.590
This might blow your mind a little, but rainbows
don’t actually exist up in the air.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.430
Their presence and appearance in the sky are
dependant on your exact location.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.040
The water droplets in the air above you are
different than the ones above, say, your friend

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.590
who lives on the other side of town and will
refract the light differently.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:24.990
Remember the double rainbow guy?

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.990
Of, course you do.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.080
He saw those majestic bows all the way across
the sky, but they actually go even further,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.850
because the light doesn't just reflect out
of the raindrops in an arc, but in all directions.

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.590
This is why sometimes people in airplanes
can see rainbows as full circles!

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.560
So, what about moonbows?

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.590
They're very similar…

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.470
Instead of direct sunlight reflecting through
raindrops, the water droplets in the air refract

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.650
moonlight… which, by the way, is technically
still sunlight, since the moon just reflects

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.500
distant sunlight and doesn’t emit any light
of its own.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.250
The best time to see a moonbow is around the
time of a full moon because the moon is brighter

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.720
and is giving off more light to refract.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.909
Besides the obvious time of day difference,
moonbows do look a bit different as well.

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.539
While daytime rainbows are full of color,
the moon isn’t as bright as the sun so there’s

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.530
less light being refracted through the water
droplets.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.750
This means that moonbows are most often seen
as plain white arcs in the sky.

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.840
But thankfully, long exposure photographs
bring out their colors and we can appreciate

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.880
these rare beauties in all their glory.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.341
So rainbows and moonbows are pretty cool,
but the one thing that doesn’t exist at

00:02:26.341 --> 00:02:28.010
all is that pot
of gold at the end.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.980
If you are looking for gold, remember to visit
Kay Jewelers.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.450
Special thanks to Kay Jewelers for sponsoring
this episode.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.650
For 100 Years, Every kiss begins with Kay.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.260
Rainbows have all the colors of white light,
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo and

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.590
violet, but what if you could see more colors
than the average person?

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.069
Check out this video about people who can
see 100 million colors.

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.090
Maybe you’re one of them.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.090
Have you ever seen a moonbow?

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.310
Or a triple rainbow?

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.310
Yes, that can happen too.

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.349
