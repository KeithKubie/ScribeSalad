10 Steps to Master Public Speaking

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:21.740
We've all had our encounters with public speaking, whether is was to entertain, inform, or persuade.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.180
Although we're taught about it in school, we still feel uncomfortable when the time comes to stand in front of a large audience.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.880
There are several factors that contribute to our fear of public speaking, or glossophobia, as it's called.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:42.660
Feeling the size of the audience magnifies our mistakes, which amplifies our fear.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.780
In a crowd of a hundred people, a single misstep might as well have been a hundred missteps.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:54.980
And it makes sense. We fear the risk of criticism, especially among strangers.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:03.380
We feel they are prone to be more honest in their reactions, thus making us value their opinion on our performance above our own opinion.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.220
Not to mention how engaging in a one-way verbal communication can be pretty awkward.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.500
Although it's expected for the crowd to keep quiet until the person speaking has finished,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.560
not getting immediate feedback can be a scary thing if you're the one in front of that crowd.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.880
To become of master of public speaking, you need to break it down into three sections.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.560
We've comprised a list divided into before, during, and after.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.200
Preparing for your delivery.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.580
Number one: revise your draft.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:43.540
Review your presentation and check for grammar, coherence, and train of thought.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.700
Two: memorize your lines.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.440
Read it out loud and practice the appropriate gestures.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.860
Nonverbal language is just as important as the spoken stuff.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.000
Three: simulate your delivery to a familiar audience.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.360
Narrow your audience down to one or two people you know.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.700
Maybe a friend or a family member.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.420
This is a good opportunity to get feedback from them as well.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.460
During delivery.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.500
Four: show up on time and neatly groomed. You're going to be the center of attention here.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.720
Outward appearances leave a great first impression. So make sure you look presentable.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.860
Five: simulate temporary narcissism.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.740
When you feel conceited, you don't care what others think of you.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.400
Being confident in what you're going to say and do will supress the nervousness.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.320
Six: make eye contact.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:49.460
Choosing a random member of the audience and holding eye contact with them for a few seconds psychologically helps narrow down the audience into a  single person.

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.060
Repeat this by choosing a new person a few times throughout your presentation.

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.120
Seven: be passionate with your speech.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.160
Body language is very important when it comes to oral presentations.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.780
Feeling the emotions in your every word will make your body move on its own.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.740
After the show.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.860
Eight: take some time to wind down.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.640
After delivering a presentation, your body and mind are bound to be tired.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.440
Your heart might still be pounding and your ears ringing. Make sure to relax.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.100
Breathe deeply. It's done.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.940
Nine: focus on what you've accomplished.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.580
You've just delivered a message. Don't waste time thinking about that word you might have missed.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.060
What's important is you've just completed a presentation. Congratulations!

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.800
Ten: ask an audience member how you did.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.600
Receiving feedback is what drives us to improve, fix our mistakes, or strive for bigger goals.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.100
Public speaking, like all other abilities, requires practice.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.320
Positive or negative, we should take it as an opportunity to do better.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.220
Public speaking plays a large role in the professional world, so it's a skill worth mastering.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.260
We hope to have helped you with these few tips!
