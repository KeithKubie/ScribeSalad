00:00:06.064 --> 00:00:08.189
SPEAKER 1: Please welcome
the hosts of "Reply All,"

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:09.600
PJ Vogt and Alex Goldman.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:16.115
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.115 --> 00:00:18.910
So "Reply All" launched a
little more than two years ago,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.740
in the fall of 2014.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.990
You were the second
podcast at Gimlet

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.510
after "Startup,"
which was the podcast

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.050
about the creation of Gimlet,
the podcast that sort of eats

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.610
its own tail.

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.570
You've covered topics like
medical mysteries, true crime,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.060
LSD, military
impostures, a doctor

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.670
searching for a cure for ALS.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.520
You've also done episodes that
aren't reported stories at all.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.120
We're going to talk a little bit
about your very special, very

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.610
strange call-in
show a little later.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.080
I hope that's OK.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.010
"Reply All" is called a
show about the internet.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.755
So to what extent is
that actually true?

00:00:58.755 --> 00:01:00.280
PJ VOGT: That's a good question.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.820
It's funny.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.330
It's like when we started,
we thought of that

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.870
as I guess a joke.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.390
The way that "Seinfeld"
is a show about nothing,

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.300
like, it would be true-ish.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.999
And I feel like
actually as we've gone,

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:17.540
there have been times where we
felt like we wanted to be more

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.706
of an internet show, and
times where we felt like we

00:01:19.706 --> 00:01:20.860
wanted to get away from it.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.050
It feels like we have this
internal team calculus for,

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.550
like, on a given story, how far
we can go away from it being

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.500
an internet story and why.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.110
And I don't know if anybody
who listens to the show

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.350
agrees with or understands
our logic for it.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.670
Because it's not
very comprehensible.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.440
But we think we know.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.570
ALEX GOLDMAN: Every
episode, I'm always

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.720
like sure we include a sentence
here which like obliquely

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.370
mentions the internet?

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:47.950
For purposes of saying the
show is about the internet?

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.822
And then Tim's
like no, it's done.

00:01:49.822 --> 00:01:52.540
Why would you do that?

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.190
It's about the
internet in as far

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.960
as the internet is like home
base for human interaction

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.710
in a lot of ways.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.920
Which is a huge
advantage to us, I

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.570
think, in terms of
being able to talk

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.360
about kind of whatever we want.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.400
But if we ever want
to tackle a story,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.240
we will retrofit a justification
onto it in order to do it.

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.360
Rather than looking for
stories that are specifically

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.519
internet related.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:23.810
Even though I'm kind of a nerd.

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:24.710
And I kind of--

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.760
PJ VOGT: You're the one
who worries more about it.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.551
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah.

00:02:26.551 --> 00:02:27.530
But I mean I tend to--

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.670
PJ VOGT: Get shouted down.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:30.860
ALEX GOLDMAN: OK.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.840
I tend to veer toward
those kinds of topics

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.550
anyway, just in my interests.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:41.270
SPEAKER 1: So before making
a podcast that was ostensibly

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:44.900
about the internet, what were
your personal relationships

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.780
to the internet?

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.930
PJ VOGT: I feel like we're
both sort of long time internet

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.020
nerd natives.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.010
Just because Alex is older
than me, where we came in

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.730
was different.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.900
I was like an AOL 2.0.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:00.890
I was like 12.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.780
And that was my first
internet, I think.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.570
Whereas Alex was like
dial-up BBS weirdo stuff.

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.750
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah, I had
a 4,800 baud internal modem

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:12.830
on my dad's laptop.

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:14.240
And I would call--

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.920
there was a BBS in our town
that had four phone lines.

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.937
And I didn't know how
to automate calling.

00:03:20.937 --> 00:03:22.520
So I would just sit
there and type it.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.061
And I would like
just run the command

00:03:24.061 --> 00:03:25.520
over and over and over again.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.780
And then when I got
through, I'd be really

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.071
excited for about four minutes.

00:03:28.071 --> 00:03:29.890
And then call waiting
would kick me off.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:30.820
It sucked.

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.060
It sucked.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:35.515
It took hours to get onto the
internet for like five minutes.

00:03:35.515 --> 00:03:36.890
PJ VOGT: But I
think an advantage

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.980
that we had because of that
when we started making the show

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:45.540
was just, like, a lot of people
who report about the internet--

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.250
less so now, but definitely
when we started, and still

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:54.466
somewhat-- treat the internet
as like a fake or cheesy space.

00:03:54.466 --> 00:03:56.090
Where it's like, oh,
there's this thing

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.800
people are always
doing, but now they're

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.841
doing it on the internet.

00:03:58.841 --> 00:04:01.387
Like as if that in
itself is interesting.

00:04:01.387 --> 00:04:03.470
And I think for both of
us, we took it for granted

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.910
that you could have
friends on the internet.

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:07.810
You can fall in love or deeply
hate somebody on the internet.

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.182
Like that seemed normal.

00:04:09.182 --> 00:04:10.640
And seeing that as
normal, I think,

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.340
has been an advantage in
how we look at a story

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.380
and what we find
interesting about a story.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.088
I think that's a thing
we have in common.

00:04:17.088 --> 00:04:19.172
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah.

00:04:19.172 --> 00:04:19.880
I agree with him.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:20.630
SPEAKER 1: Oh, OK.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:27.520
So then what makes a story
right for "Reply All"

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:32.660
if the internet is
such a loose conceit.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:33.497
PJ VOGT: OK.

00:04:33.497 --> 00:04:35.080
So I'm going to give
a working theory,

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.860
you tell me if you agree.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.350
ALEX GOLDMAN: I disagree.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.005
PJ VOGT: So the fact that
we're about the internet

00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:44.690
I feel like gives us permission
to do hard internet stories.

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.000
If we want to do a thing
about Fios, we can do it.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.880
If we're not going
to do one of those,

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.800
I think what we're
starting to learn

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.250
is that what makes
a "Reply All" story

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:56.690
a "Reply All" story has
less to do with the topic

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.600
and more to do with
the outlook of it.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.140
So we're very
interested in people.

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.290
We like stories that go all
over the place emotionally.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.290
Like we really are
allergic to things

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:11.030
that, like, stay in one feeling.

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:13.070
So if it's a story
that starts out funny,

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:15.050
we're going to be
excited if it gets sad.

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:16.890
Same with vice versa.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:19.250
We like stories that--

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:23.030
we talk about jumping the rails,
like the way an amusement park

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:24.237
ride would be on them.

00:05:24.237 --> 00:05:26.570
We like the feeling of a story
that starts in one place,

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.400
and goes somewhere
you just really

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.730
could not have planned
from the beginning.

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.650
Those are the stories
that we tend to like.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.970
People start to get excited,
and people start to pitch in on.

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:38.750
Also, we like small stories.

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:41.870
Like looking at things that
are kind of inconsequential,

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.539
and then treating them with a
lot of focus and seriousness.

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:47.580
ALEX GOLDMAN: I disagree.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.550
I agree, I agree, I agree.

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.240
I have gotten a
couple of pitches

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.200
the past couple of
days which were like,

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.290
I would like you to discuss
this particular-- it was like,

00:05:57.290 --> 00:06:00.280
I'm an expert on this
ecosystem of the internet,

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.080
and I would like you
to talk about it.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.140
And that to me in itself is--

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.720
the fact of an ecosystem on the
internet is not interesting.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.516
Because there are
all kinds of crazy

00:06:11.516 --> 00:06:12.640
ecosystems on the internet.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.890
There are like weightlifting
forums, there's the darknet,

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:16.540
there's this and
that and everything.

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.900
Like all of those things,
the fact of them existing

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.580
is just like, yeah,
there's going to be--

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.170
that's going to
exist everywhere.

00:06:23.170 --> 00:06:27.850
But like the story of
someone inside of that place,

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.560
either doing something
unexpected or like utilizing it

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.970
in a way you wouldn't imagine
or like turning it on its head

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:39.490
or causing a major disruption--

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:41.170
those are the stories
that interest me.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.211
So every time I get back
to them, I'm like, yeah,

00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:45.040
it's cool that
that place exists.

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.480
I'd really love for there to
be like a character in this

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.220
that we could follow.

00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.910
Because that is I
think the stuff that

00:06:51.910 --> 00:06:53.200
makes our show the strongest.

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:58.480
Like PJ said, the people,
people within those

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:01.030
places that we like to explain.

00:07:01.030 --> 00:07:04.330
And also having someone who is
a character within that place

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:07.720
is a very useful way to also
explain the fact of that place.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:15.820
SPEAKER 1: So you'll start
episodes with a character.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:17.775
PJ VOGT: I mean, sometimes
we'll start with--

00:07:17.775 --> 00:07:19.150
there are times
where like, oh, I

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.640
want to know more about
this world or whatever.

00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:22.220
But the moment
where we feel like--

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:25.150
and this is also a thing about
just radio or podcasts is,

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:31.180
like, you need
somebody who's like--

00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:33.070
we always hear
about good talkers.

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.197
You need somebody who's
just like to listen to them

00:07:35.197 --> 00:07:37.780
you feel like you know them or
you feel you want to know them.

00:07:37.780 --> 00:07:39.920
Like they have a
vivid way of speaking.

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:43.350
Like they show up,
and you can just--

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:44.710
there's like a feeling you get.

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:49.200
And you hear it as a listener,
you hear it as a producer.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.070
If we have a character,
we can make a story.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:53.937
If we don't, we can
try, and, like, we do--

00:07:53.937 --> 00:07:55.270
ALEX GOLDMAN: We have made them.

00:07:55.270 --> 00:07:57.797
PJ VOGT: And they're very,
very, very difficult.

00:07:57.797 --> 00:07:59.380
SPEAKER 1: Can you
think of an example

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.580
of the top of your head?

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.340
PJ VOGT: Well, I'm
trying to think

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.120
of one that was successful.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.390
I just did one, honestly, I just
did a story a few episodes ago.

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:13.470
It was about this quack
doctor from the 1920s.

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:17.200
And he believed,
or he told people

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:21.640
that he believed, that if he
could implant goat testicles

00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.030
into men's scrotums,
it would cure basically

00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:26.380
whatever ailed them.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:27.970
And he was very interesting.

00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:29.810
He's very dead.

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:30.700
So he couldn't talk.

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.741
And like building a story
around somebody who you

00:08:32.741 --> 00:08:34.539
didn't have access to was hard.

00:08:34.539 --> 00:08:36.320
We found ways, I think,
to get around it.

00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.070
And he had had a radio
show, which helped.

00:08:38.070 --> 00:08:38.940
And so there's that.

00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.530
But doing a story
like that is like much

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.390
more painful and difficult.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.990
ALEX GOLDMAN: I have a real
predilection toward stories

00:08:47.990 --> 00:08:48.875
about dead dudes.

00:08:48.875 --> 00:08:50.000
PJ VOGT: Yeah, you love it.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.830
ALEX GOLDMAN: And they
almost never make it

00:08:51.830 --> 00:08:54.140
to the radio because
I can't talk to them.

00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:58.390
So I get secondhand stories that
are not particularly reliable.

00:08:58.390 --> 00:08:59.700
But man, they're always so--

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.310
why are dead people
always so interesting?

00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:04.550
PJ VOGT: I don't know, man.

00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:06.260
SPEAKER 1: How far
do you get sort

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.760
of researching and
reporting a story

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:12.950
before you know that it's
going to make it as an episode?

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.130
PJ VOGT: We work on stuff a lot.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:18.830
Like we are very
willing to try stuff.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:20.590
And things will kind of--

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:21.330
it's weird.

00:09:21.330 --> 00:09:23.240
Like a question
people always ask

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.437
is how long do you typically
work on an episode.

00:09:25.437 --> 00:09:27.020
And it's actually
hard for us to tell.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:29.395
Because you'll be interested
in something, you'll try it,

00:09:29.395 --> 00:09:32.061
you'll push and push, you'll ask
the questions you can think of.

00:09:32.061 --> 00:09:33.770
And you'll talk to
the people the person

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:34.770
you talked to suggested.

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.269
And you'll hit a point where
you're like, this isn't enough,

00:09:37.269 --> 00:09:39.160
and I don't know
what to add to it.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.860
And we'll shelve those things
until either something changes,

00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:46.010
or we're so desperate
that like, well, it

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.620
looks a little bit better now.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:50.180
We try not to kill stuff.

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:54.096
Like we try to just keep
whacking the pinata.

00:09:54.096 --> 00:09:55.470
Because a lot of
stuff we're most

00:09:55.470 --> 00:09:58.920
proud of was ugly like
throughout the process

00:09:58.920 --> 00:09:59.660
of making it.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.160
Like sometimes for as
much as over a year.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.690
Where it was just
like a stinker.

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.480
And then somebody had like one
weird little breakthrough that

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.700
made it actually really fun.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:11.010
And another characteristic
of some of our stories

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.170
is that we'll try to
include that process.

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:17.250
We'll try to make you feel the
way we felt discovering it.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.770
And so sometimes the
ones that look bad,

00:10:19.770 --> 00:10:23.450
it can weirdly be a
strength for them, sort of.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:24.390
Some you kill.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.940
Like some, you're just like,
this is never happening.

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:30.286
We also have a team
where everyone sort of--

00:10:30.286 --> 00:10:33.720
you'll come up
with a lark-y idea.

00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:35.027
It won't work on first blush.

00:10:35.027 --> 00:10:36.360
You'll try to back away from it.

00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.318
And you have a bunch of
people like pushing you

00:10:38.318 --> 00:10:39.870
off the diving board, basically.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:44.257
Which is intimidating, but
which is really helpful.

00:10:44.257 --> 00:10:46.590
SPEAKER 1: When you guys first
started working together,

00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:51.820
it was on another internet
adjacent podcast called "TLDR."

00:10:51.820 --> 00:10:53.197
Was that just the two of you?

00:10:53.197 --> 00:10:55.530
Was there anyone pushing you
off the diving board there?

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:57.400
PJ VOGT: That was pretty
much just the two of us.

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.191
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah.

00:10:58.191 --> 00:10:59.880
We'd get help from
people occasionally.

00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.421
There were people
who we would, like,

00:11:01.421 --> 00:11:03.360
share ideas with who are not--

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.430
but like no one who
was on the payroll.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:07.470
It was just us, basically.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:08.190
PJ VOGT: Yeah.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.460
I mean, it was different because
that show was allowed to--

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:13.380
we could make it as
short as we wanted.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.570
And it could come out as
infrequently as we wanted.

00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:17.640
So we were much more--

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.440
we killed a lot more things.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.676
Which was great.

00:11:20.676 --> 00:11:22.050
ALEX GOLDMAN: And
we had episodes

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.340
that were six minutes long.

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.470
So that was also great.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:27.891
I really want to
go back to that.

00:11:27.891 --> 00:11:31.189
PJ VOGT: I think
it's late to do that.

00:11:31.189 --> 00:11:32.730
SPEAKER 1: How did
"TLDR" come about?

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:36.067
And how did the two of you
start making a podcast together?

00:11:36.067 --> 00:11:37.650
ALEX GOLDMAN: Well,
we worked together

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.860
on a show called On
The Media at WNYC.

00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:46.982
And there was a content
contest in the station.

00:11:46.982 --> 00:11:49.440
Where they were like, submit
your story, submit your ideas,

00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:51.480
and the winner
will be made into--

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.940
will be given the
funding and the care

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:57.120
to be made into a podcast.

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.610
So we were like, we should
make a weekly show that's

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.720
about the internet.

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.390
And it should be like--

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:03.870
the pitch was really weird.

00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:07.090
PJ VOGT: Or it was like, it will
come out multiple times a week.

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:08.520
And it was so stupid.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:10.686
It was like, it will come
out multiple times a week.

00:12:10.686 --> 00:12:12.920
It'll be really topical.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.990
It bore very little resemblance
to what we ended up actually

00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:17.010
making.

00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:18.990
But we pitched it in a contest.

00:12:18.990 --> 00:12:20.820
We were like finalists and lost.

00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:21.740
ALEX GOLDMAN: We lost.

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.056
"Death Sex &amp; Money" won.

00:12:23.056 --> 00:12:25.680
So if you guys listen to "Death
Sex &amp; Money," that is the show.

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.450
PJ VOGT: And two other shows
that I don't think necessarily

00:12:27.450 --> 00:12:28.700
made it out of development.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:29.680
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah.

00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.760
PJ VOGT: But we
basically, like, convinced

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:36.210
our boss to let us just
try it without getting

00:12:36.210 --> 00:12:39.520
a lot of-- just sort of nights
and weekends, basically.

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:45.000
And it got enough attention
that eventually we

00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.030
were able to justify making
it a full time thing.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.160
Instead of doing that
while also helping

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.612
to produce another show.

00:12:51.612 --> 00:12:52.320
But it was nice--

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:55.129
I mean, I think that if we'd--

00:12:55.129 --> 00:12:57.420
being able to make something
without anybody asking you

00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.336
a lot of questions about
why you were doing it

00:12:59.336 --> 00:13:00.300
was really useful.

00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.382
And being able to kind of fail
in public weirdly was useful.

00:13:05.382 --> 00:13:06.840
Just not getting
a lot of feedback,

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.302
but just getting to kind of
iterate on it was really cool.

00:13:10.302 --> 00:13:12.010
ALEX GOLDMAN: If we'd
started "Reply All"

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:15.990
without doing "TLDR," I think
the first 25 episodes would

00:13:15.990 --> 00:13:17.440
have been kind of like, eh.

00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:19.440
And then we kind of would
have found our groove.

00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:23.100
But we got to find our
groove with much fewer people

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:23.626
watching.

00:13:23.626 --> 00:13:24.750
PJ VOGT: And we got to do--

00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:27.570
we tried stuff that if there had
been a person in the room with

00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:30.390
experience, would have
said, like, don't.

00:13:30.390 --> 00:13:33.120
And some of that stuff actually
worked out really well.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.419
There were some places where
we were inventing things

00:13:35.419 --> 00:13:37.710
because we just didn't know
how to do it the right way.

00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:41.670
Which I'm really grateful for.

00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:44.820
SPEAKER 1: And that show, it
was a pretty clear evolution

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:45.930
into "Reply All," I think.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.590
Like they were both
about the internet.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:53.080
But so was it just that in like
2014, Gimlet called you guys up

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.310
and was like, want to come
make a podcast with us?

00:13:56.310 --> 00:13:57.850
PJ VOGT: More or less, yeah.

00:13:57.850 --> 00:14:02.040
We felt like it seemed
really exciting.

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:03.875
I mean, Alex Blumberg
is somebody who

00:14:03.875 --> 00:14:06.090
I think we both looked up to.

00:14:06.090 --> 00:14:10.839
It was like getting to work with
somebody that felt like a once

00:14:10.839 --> 00:14:11.880
in a lifetime experience.

00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.050
And also getting
to be at the start.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:15.510
We were working for--

00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:17.850
a night-- like WNYC
is a good place.

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:21.030
It's also been there
for a very long time.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:23.850
It seemed exciting to be there
for the beginning of a thing,

00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:24.805
even if like--

00:14:24.805 --> 00:14:26.180
ALEX GOLDMAN: It
was a thing that

00:14:26.180 --> 00:14:29.379
was not going to last for
a very long time, maybe.

00:14:29.379 --> 00:14:30.420
SPEAKER 1: It felt risky?

00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:31.839
PJ VOGT: Oh god.

00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:32.880
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yes and no.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.000
I mean, yes, it did.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:34.725
But--

00:14:34.725 --> 00:14:36.370
PJ VOGT: You were
having a child.

00:14:36.370 --> 00:14:38.469
ALEX GOLDMAN:
Yeah, I was about--

00:14:38.469 --> 00:14:40.260
we started the show in
November, and my son

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:42.540
was born at the end of January.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:46.720
But at the same time, it
was like Sarah, my wife,

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:49.960
was never like, maybe this
isn't such a good idea.

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:51.240
She was just like, go do it.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:52.990
PJ VOGT: My dad told
me it was a bad idea.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:54.270
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah, well.

00:14:54.270 --> 00:14:58.280
My dad always tells me that
good ideas are bad ideas.

00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:58.780
So--

00:14:58.780 --> 00:14:59.980
PJ VOGT: Yeah.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:03.030
SPEAKER 1: Alex, you've also
had a sort of not totally

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.630
linear career path, right?

00:15:06.630 --> 00:15:08.950
ALEX GOLDMAN: I've
had every job ever.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.740
No, I've had a lot of jobs.

00:15:11.740 --> 00:15:15.180
But when I graduated from
college, I went into--

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:19.710
after brief stints as an
intern for Tan Dun, the guy who

00:15:19.710 --> 00:15:22.260
did the music for "Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"

00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:26.100
and like working at a
music production place,

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:30.400
I was an IT guy.

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:34.762
I was network administrator
for five years.

00:15:34.762 --> 00:15:36.470
And I graduated with
a journalism degree.

00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:38.070
But it was like I
moved to New York.

00:15:38.070 --> 00:15:39.420
I didn't have any money.

00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:40.977
I had a ton of
student loan debt.

00:15:40.977 --> 00:15:43.560
And I had a bunch of friends who
are musicians, who were like,

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.851
hey, this place is pretty cool.

00:15:44.851 --> 00:15:47.307
If we want to go on tour,
they give us time off.

00:15:47.307 --> 00:15:49.140
So I was like, all
right, I'll check it out.

00:15:49.140 --> 00:15:50.642
PJ VOGT: Did you
ever go on tour?

00:15:50.642 --> 00:15:51.350
ALEX GOLDMAN: No.

00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:54.180
So like that benefit
was not right for me.

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:58.115
And then when I got an
internship in public radio,

00:15:58.115 --> 00:16:00.240
I was like, hey, you guys
let everybody go on tour.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:01.980
Can you extend that
same courtesy to me?

00:16:01.980 --> 00:16:04.050
And they were like,
no, you can quit.

00:16:04.050 --> 00:16:05.250
So I quit.

00:16:05.250 --> 00:16:05.970
PJ VOGT: Yeah.

00:16:05.970 --> 00:16:09.190
Which is a crazy thing
to do because you don't--

00:16:09.190 --> 00:16:11.220
public radio interns
are not really--

00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:13.920
ALEX GOLDMAN: I was told very
specifically, like, this is not

00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:14.599
a path to a job.

00:16:14.599 --> 00:16:16.140
If you want to do
this, you are going

00:16:16.140 --> 00:16:19.470
to do it because you want the
experience, and that's it.

00:16:19.470 --> 00:16:21.330
It's not going happen.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:21.940
PJ VOGT: But that didn't
turn out to be true.

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:22.800
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah.

00:16:22.800 --> 00:16:24.730
I got lucky.

00:16:24.730 --> 00:16:28.039
SPEAKER 1: PJ, was your path a
little more traditional radio--

00:16:28.039 --> 00:16:28.830
PJ VOGT: Basically.

00:16:28.830 --> 00:16:33.960
I was in college.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:36.486
I applied to be an intern
for "This American Life."

00:16:36.486 --> 00:16:40.260
I got the internship, so
I dropped out of college.

00:16:40.260 --> 00:16:41.907
I did the internship,
and then got

00:16:41.907 --> 00:16:44.490
a job temping at "On The Media,"
which is where Alex ended up.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:49.960
I was like-- yeah, the short
way instead of the long way.

00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:52.063
Which I liked.

00:16:52.063 --> 00:16:53.070
It was good.

00:16:56.120 --> 00:16:58.020
Yeah.

00:16:58.020 --> 00:17:01.380
Do you feel like having a
weirder path has helped you?

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.100
Like--

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:05.140
ALEX GOLDMAN: Don't I
seem so worldly to you?

00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:06.859
PJ VOGT: No.

00:17:06.859 --> 00:17:09.010
I keep waiting for you
to be like, in my time--

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:11.579
like that you would learned
one lesson at every weird job.

00:17:11.579 --> 00:17:12.822
And they would all apply.

00:17:12.822 --> 00:17:13.530
ALEX GOLDMAN: No.

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:15.099
PJ VOGT: It seems like you
learned that you don't like--

00:17:15.099 --> 00:17:17.099
ALEX GOLDMAN: I
learned that most jobs

00:17:17.099 --> 00:17:20.960
are really hard and bad.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.560
SPEAKER 1: Is this
one hard and bad?

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:24.260
ALEX GOLDMAN: Can be.

00:17:24.260 --> 00:17:25.720
No, this job is great.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:26.849
This is the best.

00:17:26.849 --> 00:17:31.000
This is everything I've ever
wanted to do with my life.

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.511
The only problem with it is
I can do whatever I want.

00:17:36.511 --> 00:17:37.510
I know that sounds nuts.

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:39.840
But it's like with no one
telling me what to do,

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.990
suddenly it's easy to panic,
with no one telling you

00:17:42.990 --> 00:17:45.132
what to do.

00:17:45.132 --> 00:17:45.840
I mean, but yeah.

00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:46.770
This is amazing.

00:17:46.770 --> 00:17:47.845
This is awesome.

00:17:47.845 --> 00:17:49.720
PJ VOGT: It feels like
a scam a lot of times.

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:50.340
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah,
or feels like we're

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.890
getting away with something.

00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:55.230
Like, there are a bunch of
people in a room watching

00:17:55.230 --> 00:17:56.910
us talk right now.

00:17:56.910 --> 00:17:58.314
What is that about?

00:17:58.314 --> 00:17:59.730
SPEAKER 1: That's
a good question.

00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:05.564
To make a sort of awkward
segue about audience and people

00:18:05.564 --> 00:18:07.980
watching you do what you do,
one of the interesting things

00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:14.022
about being really early
employees at Gimlet was that--

00:18:14.022 --> 00:18:16.230
so you were the second
podcast, and the first podcast

00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:21.660
was the one that was about
the creation of your employer,

00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:23.680
which meant that the first--

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.690
you know, now "StartUp"
is about other start-ups,

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:30.050
but the first couple
seasons were about Gimlet.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:33.020
And so meetings were recorded,
conversations were recorded.

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.720
Not like-- you knew you
were being recorded.

00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:43.080
But a lot of things were public,
and had an audience, including

00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:46.800
some difficult things.

00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.290
So first, when
you joined Gimlet,

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:51.120
did you know that
would be the case?

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.495
PJ VOGT: Yeah,
because literally,

00:18:52.495 --> 00:18:55.390
I think the first time, even
before we joined Gimlet,

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:58.152
we would have meetings
with Alex about--

00:18:58.152 --> 00:19:01.380
you know, like the kinds of
negotiations you have before

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.920
deciding to accept a job.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.010
And we'd be meeting
in a bar or whatever,

00:19:05.010 --> 00:19:08.760
and he would show up with giant
headphones and a big field

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:12.270
microphone, and it
wouldn't turn on.

00:19:12.270 --> 00:19:14.310
You're like, OK, he's
going to get a little bit,

00:19:14.310 --> 00:19:15.710
and then we're going
to really talk.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:17.070
But it was just the whole thing.

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:18.810
And if he started
to put it down,

00:19:18.810 --> 00:19:21.802
and you said
something, you know,

00:19:21.802 --> 00:19:24.260
like, but seriously, I'm really
worried about what it would

00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:27.260
mean to join a company in a
warehouse that has no money

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:29.440
and is crazy, he'd be
like, wait, say that--

00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:29.940
hold on.

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:32.940
Like, he really-- any time
something bad happened

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:35.160
at Gimlet for the
first year, you

00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.350
knew something bad was happening
if Alex had a microphone, which

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:41.400
is interesting.

00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.870
SPEAKER 1: What was that like?

00:19:42.870 --> 00:19:45.060
I mean, that sounds terrifying.

00:19:45.060 --> 00:19:47.230
ALEX GOLDMAN: I kind of got
used to it pretty quick.

00:19:47.230 --> 00:19:49.154
PJ VOGT: I mean,
weirdly, it was helpful.

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:51.570
Like, from the outside, it
sounds like it would definitely

00:19:51.570 --> 00:19:57.760
be bad, and there were times
where you were sort of like--

00:19:57.760 --> 00:19:58.434
I don't know.

00:19:58.434 --> 00:20:00.100
I think the thing
that was cool about it

00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:02.980
was Alex is a really
great boss, and one

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.100
of the reasons he's a great
boss is he really listens.

00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:08.080
If there's a problem,
and you tell him

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.720
why you think it's a
problem, he just like--

00:20:10.720 --> 00:20:13.150
I've never had that
relationship with anybody

00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:16.940
who had more power
than me at a workplace.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:20.500
And the fact that he
was doing this project,

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:22.085
I think it made
him more like that.

00:20:22.085 --> 00:20:23.710
Like, you'd be upset,
and he'd be like,

00:20:23.710 --> 00:20:24.520
tell me why you're upset.

00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:26.690
As much as you're like, I wish
you weren't recording this,

00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.065
it also meant he was going to
sit down and think about it

00:20:29.065 --> 00:20:30.070
and write about it.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:33.169
And yeah, you--

00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:34.710
I think for the most
part, it helped.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.396
I think that there
might have been--

00:20:37.396 --> 00:20:38.770
more things could've
gotten swept

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:40.995
under the rug if
somebody wasn't like,

00:20:40.995 --> 00:20:42.370
every time there's
something bad,

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:46.452
we're going to put all of our
organizational attention on it.

00:20:46.452 --> 00:20:48.910
ALEX GOLDMAN: I will also say
that I think that by the time

00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:51.540
we started, the first couple
episodes of "StartUp" were out,

00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:54.790
and it was very clear to
me that he was building

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.250
a relationship, like
a trust relationship,

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.220
with the audience that
definitely could not

00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:05.290
be replicated at Gimlet
now, definitely helped us

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:11.050
a lot, because people heard
us screw up in big ways.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:12.400
And we got to be like, look.

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.780
This is who we are.

00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:17.710
We're trying our best, and here
are the bad things we're doing,

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:21.340
and here are the ways that
this job is hard, and here are

00:21:21.340 --> 00:21:25.060
the ways that we want to do
the thing that we can't do yet.

00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:28.030
And that, I think, was--

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:31.390
I think having our
stuff out there

00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:35.886
in the world redounded to our
benefit in a pretty crazy way.

00:21:35.886 --> 00:21:37.760
PJ VOGT: I think the
only downside, actually,

00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:40.170
was people would
listen to an episode,

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:42.003
and it's like when
you're watching TV shows,

00:21:42.003 --> 00:21:43.794
you're like, I fucking
hate that character.

00:21:43.794 --> 00:21:46.074
Like, people would
feel that way about me.

00:21:46.074 --> 00:21:46.990
And so that was weird.

00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:48.739
They're like, oh,
you're whining too much.

00:21:48.739 --> 00:21:50.800
It's like, you're
whining too much.

00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:52.630
Like, what was your
week at work like?

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:54.213
SPEAKER 1: Were they
telling you this?

00:21:54.213 --> 00:21:55.150
PJ VOGT: Oh, yeah.

00:21:55.150 --> 00:21:56.110
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:58.798
SPEAKER 1: Like,
@PJVogt, stop whining.

00:21:58.798 --> 00:22:00.085
PJ VOGT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:22:00.085 --> 00:22:00.668
A lot of that.

00:22:00.668 --> 00:22:02.890
A lot more with me, I
think, than with you.

00:22:02.890 --> 00:22:03.870
ALEX GOLDMAN: It's because
you've got a whiny voice.

00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.070
PJ VOGT: Yeah.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:07.830
So that's hard.

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.552
Also, people-- you're feeling
things that are really intense,

00:22:10.552 --> 00:22:12.010
but people don't
necessarily listen

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.424
to podcasts the moment
that they're happening.

00:22:14.424 --> 00:22:16.090
And so there's this
weird emotional lag,

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:18.173
where whether someone's
being angry or supportive,

00:22:18.173 --> 00:22:20.400
they're like, oh my god,
I just heard, are you OK?

00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:22.700
And you're like, that
was eight months ago.

00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:23.902
I don't remember anything.

00:22:23.902 --> 00:22:25.360
ALEX GOLDMAN: For
a year afterward,

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.530
people were like, how's
your foot fungus, PJ?

00:22:27.530 --> 00:22:29.960
PJ VOGT: Yeah.

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:31.930
Yeah.

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:36.700
SPEAKER 1: Do you also get a
lot of very candid listener

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.440
feedback to your own show?

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:39.640
PJ VOGT: Yeah, we do.

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.840
I mean, I think it's a
thing about podcasts.

00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.810
I think it's just people
really feel like they know you.

00:22:46.810 --> 00:22:51.100
And the weird thing is, I
think they more or less do.

00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:52.600
That's what's weird.

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:54.220
There are people
who like me or don't

00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.610
like me the way people in my
life like me or don't like me.

00:22:57.610 --> 00:22:58.749
And it feels--

00:22:58.749 --> 00:22:59.290
I don't know.

00:22:59.290 --> 00:23:02.307
Like, when we were just writing
online, when we were blogging,

00:23:02.307 --> 00:23:04.640
and people would have a problem
with me, I was like, eh,

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:05.140
whatever.

00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:07.450
Like, this is just your
weird projected idea.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:10.400
Now there's more people
where I'm like, yeah,

00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.650
I think you don't like me.

00:23:11.650 --> 00:23:14.230
I don't know why you keep
listening to the podcast.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:15.910
But I see you.

00:23:15.910 --> 00:23:17.270
Like, I get it.

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:19.046
It's very strange.

00:23:19.046 --> 00:23:20.920
ALEX GOLDMAN: There are
a couple of very sort

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.820
of standard complaints
we get about the show--

00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:27.370
that we say "like"
too much is one.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:33.220
But I'd say that people who
are candid, a lot of times I

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.750
try to not get super
defensive, and actually

00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.730
hear what people have to
say, because a lot of times,

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:42.520
there's some element of
it that's useful to me.

00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:45.790
But it doesn't mean that
the 140-character format

00:23:45.790 --> 00:23:50.860
of telling people how you feel
about them is super sensitive.

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.720
So that's not great.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.120
But yeah, I mean, yes, people
are very candid with us

00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.370
about how they feel
about the show or us

00:23:57.370 --> 00:24:03.349
as people, because we as people
appear frequently on the show.

00:24:03.349 --> 00:24:04.765
PJ VOGT: It's also
like, I know it

00:24:04.765 --> 00:24:06.140
from listening to
other podcasts,

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:07.750
where I feel like
the podcasts I like,

00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:09.791
I have a relationship with
the host where they're

00:24:09.791 --> 00:24:12.520
like a friend, in that
I get annoyed with them,

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.550
where I'm like, ah, you're doing
the thing again, or whatever.

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:18.564
I think it's a kind of intimacy.

00:24:18.564 --> 00:24:20.230
It's just a very weird
kind of intimacy,

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:22.390
because it's mostly one-way.

00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:23.647
I mean, not totally, but yeah.

00:24:23.647 --> 00:24:25.480
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, it's
pretty much one-sided.

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:28.024
You know, people are
hearing your voices.

00:24:28.024 --> 00:24:30.190
I mean, something I always
think about with podcasts

00:24:30.190 --> 00:24:32.315
is I listen to them on
headphones most of the time,

00:24:32.315 --> 00:24:35.920
so it's like the host's voice
is inside my head, which

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.756
is very intimate.

00:24:36.756 --> 00:24:38.380
PJ VOGT: I don't
think there's anything

00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.400
like that in terms of intimacy.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.050
I guess sometimes I feel
that way reading a book.

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.610
You're just spending so much
time in another person's

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:46.310
imagination.

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:48.710
But yeah, it's strange.

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:49.760
It's very strange.

00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:52.260
And I don't think the
strangeness really goes away.

00:24:52.260 --> 00:24:54.510
I still feel that as a listener.

00:24:54.510 --> 00:24:55.010
Yeah.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:56.635
ALEX GOLDMAN: One of
my favorite things

00:24:56.635 --> 00:24:59.310
about listening to podcasts
is when you can hear the room.

00:24:59.310 --> 00:25:01.650
Like, some podcasts
that I listen

00:25:01.650 --> 00:25:04.140
to that are recorded at home,
when you can hear their cats

00:25:04.140 --> 00:25:06.360
or their roommates
coming and going, or--

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.360
PJ VOGT: You're a creep.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.540
ALEX GOLDMAN: What?

00:25:09.540 --> 00:25:12.080
I mean, usually they
stop to note it.

00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.580
PJ VOGT: What podcasts are you
listening to where you hear--

00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:15.500
ALEX GOLDMAN: They do
that on "Chapo Trap House"

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:16.350
all the time.

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:19.350
And then on "Comedy
Bang Bang," where

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:21.600
the engineer is in the room,
and occasionally they'll

00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:22.770
be like, what?

00:25:22.770 --> 00:25:26.550
There was one not too long
ago where the engineer

00:25:26.550 --> 00:25:31.670
was obviously watching football,
and accidentally started

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.340
turning the sound on on the
football game he was watching.

00:25:34.340 --> 00:25:38.090
And they laid into
him for 15 minutes,

00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:42.580
and it was so
satisfying and so funny.

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:45.120
I just love-- that
is the thing that

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.290
feels truly intimate to me.

00:25:46.290 --> 00:25:49.509
Like, yes, they're in my head,
but I'm also in their house

00:25:49.509 --> 00:25:50.300
or in their studio.

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:51.450
Like, I'm there.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:53.760
PJ VOGT: Yeah.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:56.370
SPEAKER 1: One of the ways
that you guys will sometimes

00:25:56.370 --> 00:25:58.290
structure episodes
is that one of you

00:25:58.290 --> 00:26:00.739
or another one of the
producers reports the story,

00:26:00.739 --> 00:26:02.280
and then you bring
it into the studio

00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:05.960
to tell the other
person about it.

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:11.170
How authentic is
that sort of sense

00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:12.862
of freshness and surprise?

00:26:12.862 --> 00:26:15.070
Because if you're doing it
that way, I always wonder,

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:17.454
what about collaborating
on the reporting process?

00:26:17.454 --> 00:26:18.870
ALEX GOLDMAN: It's
very authentic,

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:20.407
and it's such a pain in the ass.

00:26:20.407 --> 00:26:21.490
PJ VOGT: It's so annoying.

00:26:21.490 --> 00:26:21.760
ALEX GOLDMAN: You have no idea.

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:23.135
SPEAKER 1: So I
have to go report

00:26:23.135 --> 00:26:24.760
this one entirely without PJ.

00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:25.797
See you in three months.

00:26:25.797 --> 00:26:26.380
PJ VOGT: Yeah.

00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:28.120
I mean, we will--

00:26:28.120 --> 00:26:30.220
I know that Alex is
working on two stories

00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:32.020
that I don't know
anything about.

00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.910
The other thing is that we'll--

00:26:33.910 --> 00:26:36.460
the thing that is constructed
about those conversations

00:26:36.460 --> 00:26:39.720
is oftentimes it will
be two or three of them,

00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:41.140
and presented as one.

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:44.590
So sometimes-- we
call it a dump.

00:26:44.590 --> 00:26:49.480
And Alex, he'll fill me in on
the first half of the story

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.930
he's reported, and so then we
have my authentic reactions

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:53.560
and surprise.

00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:55.074
I can contribute ideas.

00:26:55.074 --> 00:26:56.740
But then he goes off
and does more stuff

00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:57.970
that he can't tell me about.

00:26:57.970 --> 00:27:00.261
ALEX GOLDMAN: But the dump
also really, a lot of times,

00:27:00.261 --> 00:27:03.190
helps sharpen the idea, and
helps direct my reporting.

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:06.240
So we'll do a dump, and
then we'll be like, well,

00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.000
the questions you
ask, because you

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.190
are the surrogate
for the listener,

00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:13.810
are the questions that help
me figure out, oh, well, I

00:27:13.810 --> 00:27:15.790
should follow this path,
because it's obviously

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:16.920
very interesting.

00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:17.800
PJ VOGT: Yeah.

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.390
I mean, the "I'm
going to tell you

00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:23.200
about a thing you don't
know" format is definitely

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:25.750
a venerable radio format.

00:27:25.750 --> 00:27:27.250
I think what is
different about us

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:31.440
is that we really do try to
preserve surprise and not

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.380
know about it.

00:27:32.380 --> 00:27:34.134
It's such a pain in the ass.

00:27:34.134 --> 00:27:35.800
ALEX GOLDMAN: We sit
in the same office.

00:27:35.800 --> 00:27:38.860
So to do that, we actually--
one of us has to leave the room,

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.110
or--

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:43.690
it's usually with our
executive producer, Tim.

00:27:43.690 --> 00:27:47.489
So we will go to another
office and be like,

00:27:47.489 --> 00:27:48.280
let's map this out.

00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:51.700
This is what I'm
going to tell him.

00:27:51.700 --> 00:27:53.640
PJ VOGT: But it's cool
because you do get--

00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:55.820
it means that you'll get--

00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:57.691
if you were able to
tell me what to ask,

00:27:57.691 --> 00:27:59.440
I would ask different
things, and it would

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.700
be a more predictable story.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.007
And some of the fun
we've had with stuff

00:28:03.007 --> 00:28:05.090
is just being pushed in a
direction that was like,

00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:07.460
do you really want to know
more about that part of it?

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:09.830
But it can be really helpful.

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:11.980
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah, definitely.

00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:14.620
SPEAKER 1: I also want to ask
about a particular episode that

00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.590
was a very different format,
which was the call-in episode.

00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:19.990
So, I don't know,
a few months ago--

00:28:19.990 --> 00:28:21.490
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah,
it was November.

00:28:21.490 --> 00:28:22.210
PJ VOGT: It was November?

00:28:22.210 --> 00:28:22.650
SPEAKER 1: November.

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.250
PJ VOGT: But we
recorded it in October.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:25.916
ALEX GOLDMAN: We
recorded it in October,

00:28:25.916 --> 00:28:27.620
and we posted it
the end of November.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.380
SPEAKER 1: So in
October, you started

00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:32.500
announcing on social media
and in the "Reply All"

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.030
newsletter and
whatnot that you were

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:36.460
going to be having
a 48-hour call-in,

00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:41.400
48 hours straight through, where
you'd put out the phone number,

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:43.690
post the phone number, ask
people to spread the phone

00:28:43.690 --> 00:28:45.615
number to people who
don't know the show,

00:28:45.615 --> 00:28:47.740
and that it was just sort
of routed to your phones,

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.480
wherever you were,
for 48 hours straight.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:53.920
OK, so before we get into
why these pained sighs,

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.030
where did the idea
for this come from?

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:57.320
Why did you want to do this?

00:28:57.320 --> 00:28:58.720
ALEX GOLDMAN: It came
from Tim Howard, right?

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.928
PJ VOGT: No, it came from me.

00:28:59.928 --> 00:29:02.410
ALEX GOLDMAN: It
came from PJ, right?

00:29:02.410 --> 00:29:06.670
PJ VOGT: We get excited
about doing things where it's

00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:08.440
like, we're not going to know--

00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:10.356
we're going to try an
idea where we won't even

00:29:10.356 --> 00:29:12.070
know what it is until we do it.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:14.140
We did an episode
a year before where

00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:18.780
it was just a day in New York.

00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.147
And so it seemed like that.

00:29:20.147 --> 00:29:21.730
I thought it would
be funny if we just

00:29:21.730 --> 00:29:23.451
were a call-in show for a day.

00:29:23.451 --> 00:29:24.325
It just seemed funny.

00:29:27.371 --> 00:29:28.870
ALEX GOLDMAN: PJ
was the one who was

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:30.610
like, it has to be 48 hours.

00:29:30.610 --> 00:29:33.180
24 hours is too easy.

00:29:33.180 --> 00:29:36.700
PJ VOGT: I thought making
it hard would upset Alex.

00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:40.120
And then he wasn't upset by
it and thought it was fine.

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:43.000
But I proposed it, so I
couldn't get out of it.

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.730
Yeah, it was not--

00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:47.650
the why of it-- it wasn't--

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:50.460
it was poorly conceived.

00:29:50.460 --> 00:29:53.230
SPEAKER 1: OK,
and so it's ironic

00:29:53.230 --> 00:29:58.580
that you're the one who proposed
the 48 hours, because things

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:00.670
that we learned
from the episode,

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.804
in case you haven't
heard it, is day

00:30:02.804 --> 00:30:04.720
one was your anniversary
with your girlfriend.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:05.409
PJ VOGT: Yes.

00:30:05.409 --> 00:30:06.700
SPEAKER 1: That was a good one.

00:30:06.700 --> 00:30:10.660
And so 24 hours was
going to be too easy.

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:13.090
How far into the 48
hours did you last?

00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:16.310
PJ VOGT: I first bailed--

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:18.030
ALEX GOLDMAN: About 11:00 PM.

00:30:18.030 --> 00:30:20.050
PJ VOGT: No, it was before that.

00:30:20.050 --> 00:30:21.530
I mean, because there was
two hours where I was like,

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:22.720
I'm not going to
talk to anybody.

00:30:22.720 --> 00:30:23.710
I'll pick up the phone,
but I won't talk.

00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:24.710
ALEX GOLDMAN: Oh, right.

00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:29.680
So if we're going
solely on that moment,

00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:31.440
he bailed about six hours in.

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.460
PJ VOGT: Yeah.

00:30:32.460 --> 00:30:36.430
And then I slept the first
night, and Alex didn't.

00:30:36.430 --> 00:30:39.810
And then I was awake
for the second day.

00:30:39.810 --> 00:30:43.150
Took a little siesta during
the evening of the second day.

00:30:43.150 --> 00:30:46.980
And then Alex finally slept
the night of the second day.

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:49.720
And I was on duty
for that night.

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.770
But yeah, I did not
equip myself very well.

00:30:53.770 --> 00:30:56.120
That was a time where I
heard from a lot of listeners

00:30:56.120 --> 00:30:58.330
that were like, I don't
like you because you're

00:30:58.330 --> 00:30:59.600
a big-talking wimp.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:01.240
And I was like, that's true.

00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:03.044
I am a big-talking wimp.

00:31:03.044 --> 00:31:04.960
SPEAKER 1: Alex, did
having a baby prepare you

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:06.422
for the weird sleep schedule?

00:31:06.422 --> 00:31:07.130
ALEX GOLDMAN: No.

00:31:07.130 --> 00:31:07.300
SPEAKER 1: No?

00:31:07.300 --> 00:31:07.780
PJ VOGT: She means your son.

00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:08.488
ALEX GOLDMAN: No.

00:31:11.430 --> 00:31:12.360
No, it didn't.

00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:14.347
I mean, he's been
sleeping through the night

00:31:14.347 --> 00:31:15.430
now for a year and a half.

00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:18.520
So that did not
prepare me at all.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.700
Knowing that it
was going to happen

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:24.570
prepared me, because I was
like, oh, well, maybe I

00:31:24.570 --> 00:31:26.945
should get a good night's
sleep and get ready to do this.

00:31:26.945 --> 00:31:29.250
PJ also knew that it
was going to happen.

00:31:29.250 --> 00:31:30.335
PJ VOGT: Didn't get
a good night's sleep.

00:31:30.335 --> 00:31:30.600
ALEX GOLDMAN: No.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:31.933
Didn't work out as well for him.

00:31:34.119 --> 00:31:35.160
Yeah, it was fun, though.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:35.760
I'd do it again.

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:36.593
Want to do it again?

00:31:36.593 --> 00:31:38.800
PJ VOGT: Not really, no.

00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:39.750
Maybe.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:43.700
Yeah, it gave us the thing
we were hoping for, though,

00:31:43.700 --> 00:31:45.690
which is--

00:31:45.690 --> 00:31:46.320
I don't know.

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.962
For the most part, our
show is pretty structured,

00:31:48.962 --> 00:31:50.670
and we know how to
make it at this point,

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:54.750
and we have different segments
that we don't know what's

00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:56.392
going to happen in
them, but we know

00:31:56.392 --> 00:31:58.350
it's going to start with
this kind of question,

00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:59.770
and it's going to
be about 15 minutes.

00:31:59.770 --> 00:32:01.170
We're going to talk
to three people.

00:32:01.170 --> 00:32:02.878
And the cool thing
about the call-in show

00:32:02.878 --> 00:32:07.080
was that it kind of revealed
itself to us as it happened.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:10.922
Like, there were
thematic throughlines

00:32:10.922 --> 00:32:12.630
that were happening
in some of the calls.

00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:15.910
And there were things that were
funny that started to repeat.

00:32:15.910 --> 00:32:19.389
And you felt like you were
watching something form,

00:32:19.389 --> 00:32:21.680
instead of forming something
in a real intentional way.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.580
There was very little
planning we could do.

00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.050
And I don't think
we even did some

00:32:26.050 --> 00:32:27.758
of the things we
probably could have done

00:32:27.758 --> 00:32:29.490
that would have been smart.

00:32:29.490 --> 00:32:31.710
ALEX GOLDMAN: There
was one weird response

00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:34.189
we got to that was like, why
didn't you guys take shifts?

00:32:34.189 --> 00:32:35.730
You could have very
easily done this.

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:39.930
And I was like, the whole point
was like, the design of this

00:32:39.930 --> 00:32:40.620
was to break us.

00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:42.870
It wasn't like we were like,
let's think of a cool way

00:32:42.870 --> 00:32:45.300
to get around to having
to do this hard thing.

00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.450
The design was, let's
do an impossible thing,

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:51.840
and it'll be funny because
we won't be able to do it.

00:32:51.840 --> 00:32:54.950
PJ VOGT: Yeah, we kept talking
about that watching it fail

00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:58.030
was going to be the best part.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:00.180
It was not the best part.

00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:01.320
But that was the idea.

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.990
SPEAKER 1: What was
the best part of it?

00:33:03.990 --> 00:33:08.520
ALEX GOLDMAN: We got some
really amazing, thoughtful calls

00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:11.520
from people who--

00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.090
I was just shocked at the trust
people put in us, honestly.

00:33:15.090 --> 00:33:15.810
PJ VOGT: Yeah.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:17.490
I think one thing
that we didn't know

00:33:17.490 --> 00:33:19.140
we wanted that
ended up happening

00:33:19.140 --> 00:33:21.060
was we had a lot of
phone conversations

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:24.030
with strangers that felt
like phone conversations

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:26.550
you would have talking
to a friend late at night

00:33:26.550 --> 00:33:30.480
when you're driving
somewhere, like that intimacy.

00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:33.030
And I don't think we knew to
hope that that would happen,

00:33:33.030 --> 00:33:33.980
but it really did.

00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.762
For me, the second night,
talking to people--

00:33:36.762 --> 00:33:38.970
also it was cool because if
you're awake long enough,

00:33:38.970 --> 00:33:41.936
you're getting people who are
getting dressed in Germany

00:33:41.936 --> 00:33:42.810
on their way to work.

00:33:42.810 --> 00:33:45.060
And it felt really nice.

00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:47.250
It felt very strange
and very nice.

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.067
Very tiring.

00:33:49.067 --> 00:33:50.400
ALEX GOLDMAN: Definitely tiring.

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:53.280
PJ VOGT: The other best part was
Alex on the first night just,

00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:54.745
like, lost it.

00:33:54.745 --> 00:33:57.120
It was just like listening to
someone with space madness.

00:33:57.120 --> 00:33:59.862
It was really enjoyable.

00:33:59.862 --> 00:34:01.320
SPEAKER 1: If you
haven't heard it,

00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:03.270
it's a really lovely episode.

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:08.280
One of my favorite things is the
cheat that you used to sleep,

00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.864
which is to ask the other
person to not hang up.

00:34:11.864 --> 00:34:13.739
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah, but
the guy didn't do it.

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:15.655
PJ VOGT: There was this
whole thing where Alex

00:34:15.655 --> 00:34:17.516
was negotiating with this bro.

00:34:17.516 --> 00:34:19.770
ALEX GOLDMAN: I'm like, listen.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:24.747
I'm not going to make it, but if
you can just put your phone up

00:34:24.747 --> 00:34:25.830
to a speaker or something.

00:34:25.830 --> 00:34:27.750
And he's like, my
girlfriend already thinks

00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:29.041
this phone call is super weird.

00:34:29.041 --> 00:34:30.871
It's 1:00 in the morning here.

00:34:30.871 --> 00:34:32.620
And then there were
two people on the line

00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:34.290
because we were having a
technical difficulty where

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:35.340
two people were on the line.

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.090
And the other guy was
like, come on, dude!

00:34:37.090 --> 00:34:37.780
Do it!

00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:39.090
PJ VOGT: But he wouldn't do it.

00:34:39.090 --> 00:34:40.170
ALEX GOLDMAN: But that's
because he was at the airport.

00:34:40.170 --> 00:34:41.530
He was about to get on a plane.

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:42.510
PJ VOGT: Oh, yeah.

00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:43.710
ALEX GOLDMAN: And
then I was like, no.

00:34:43.710 --> 00:34:44.210
It's OK.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:45.699
You can't force him to do it.

00:34:45.699 --> 00:34:46.784
I'll keep going.

00:34:46.784 --> 00:34:49.159
PJ VOGT: You asked those guys
where they were from, like,

00:34:49.159 --> 00:34:51.503
three times.

00:34:51.503 --> 00:34:52.544
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah, well.

00:34:55.125 --> 00:34:57.000
I think it's important
to add, at this point,

00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:57.805
you were sleeping soundly.

00:34:57.805 --> 00:34:59.010
PJ VOGT: Oh, it was great.

00:34:59.010 --> 00:34:59.680
Yeah.

00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.221
I watched "Your
Crazy Ex-Girlfriend."

00:35:01.221 --> 00:35:02.060
It was really good.

00:35:02.060 --> 00:35:03.215
SPEAKER 1: You were awake?

00:35:03.215 --> 00:35:05.256
PJ VOGT: Well, I couldn't
fall asleep right away.

00:35:06.622 --> 00:35:08.330
ALEX GOLDMAN: I'm just
learning this now.

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:09.000
I'm not happy.

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.140
SPEAKER 1: I'm sorry.

00:35:10.140 --> 00:35:11.879
I'm sorry that I
made that happen.

00:35:11.879 --> 00:35:14.170
We're going to open things
up to questions in a minute.

00:35:14.170 --> 00:35:15.855
So we have microphones
in both aisles.

00:35:15.855 --> 00:35:19.200
So if you'd like to ask a
question, please line up.

00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:23.910
But I'll just ask
one more question.

00:35:23.910 --> 00:35:26.160
What podcasts do
you guys listen to?

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.930
You already mentioned
"Comedy Bang Bang."

00:35:27.930 --> 00:35:29.630
What other podcasts do you love?

00:35:29.630 --> 00:35:32.312
Who's making cool stuff?

00:35:32.312 --> 00:35:33.270
ALEX GOLDMAN: Go ahead.

00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:35.280
PJ VOGT: I feel like when
people ask that, I always

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:36.946
wish I was listening
to things that were

00:35:36.946 --> 00:35:38.930
more obscure or avant-garde.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:42.420
I listen to "This American Life"
and "Radiolab" and "StartUp".

00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:46.474
I listen to the big
shows that people like.

00:35:46.474 --> 00:35:48.390
We both like comedy
podcasts, like, a lot lot.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.830
Like, "You Made It Weird,"
which is sort of a much goofier

00:35:52.830 --> 00:35:53.890
"WTF."

00:35:53.890 --> 00:35:55.700
"Comedy Bang Bang."

00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:58.185
Alex really loves this show
called "The Bone Zone."

00:35:58.185 --> 00:36:00.476
ALEX GOLDMAN: Why do you have
to say it like that, man?

00:36:00.476 --> 00:36:02.339
PJ VOGT: It's not a great title.

00:36:02.339 --> 00:36:03.630
ALEX GOLDMAN: It's way better--

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:04.800
I mean, that's true.

00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:05.700
It's not great.

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:06.930
PJ VOGT: What were you going
to say it's better than?

00:36:06.930 --> 00:36:07.846
ALEX GOLDMAN: Nothing.

00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:15.030
I feel like so much of
my podcast listening

00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:19.320
is time that I can
tune in and out.

00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:21.780
I like things where I
don't have to be focused

00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:24.960
on it the whole time,
because I focus so much

00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.240
on my own podcasts.

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.530
So yes, comedy
podcasts, especially

00:36:28.530 --> 00:36:30.069
improv comedy podcasts.

00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:31.860
"Hello From the Magic
Tavern" I like a lot.

00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:32.880
"How Did This Get Made?"

00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.190
I like the "Gilmore Guys."

00:36:38.190 --> 00:36:39.180
Oh, yeah.

00:36:39.180 --> 00:36:41.034
All right.

00:36:41.034 --> 00:36:43.200
I have really enjoyed "There
Goes the Neighborhood,"

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.162
the WNYC podcast
about gentrification

00:36:45.162 --> 00:36:45.870
in New York City.

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:46.840
PJ VOGT: It's really good.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:48.006
SPEAKER 1: It's really good.

00:36:48.006 --> 00:36:50.130
ALEX GOLDMAN: And
then actually KQED

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:55.520
just did an atrociously-named
podcast called "Q'ed Up."

00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:59.480
Q apostrophe E-D Up,
because it's from KQED.

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.146
PJ VOGT: Oh, OK.

00:37:00.146 --> 00:37:02.430
Yeah, that could be better.

00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:14.130
ALEX GOLDMAN: But
it is about the way

00:37:14.130 --> 00:37:17.100
that San Francisco has priced
out so many people that they've

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:21.030
moved to suburbs, and how the
previously white suburbs have

00:37:21.030 --> 00:37:21.582
dealt with--

00:37:21.582 --> 00:37:23.040
PJ VOGT: It's such
a weird dystopia

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:24.700
that we're making
every city unlivable

00:37:24.700 --> 00:37:27.901
but then making really
good podcasts about it.

00:37:27.901 --> 00:37:30.150
ALEX GOLDMAN: Well, you know,
whatever works, I guess.

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:31.733
PJ VOGT: I don't
know that that works.

00:37:31.733 --> 00:37:34.170
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah,
the world is terrible,

00:37:34.170 --> 00:37:35.870
but it's nice that
it's documented.

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:37.370
PJ VOGT: But the
podcasts are great.

00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:38.760
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yeah.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:42.009
So those are both really good.

00:37:42.009 --> 00:37:42.550
I don't know.

00:37:42.550 --> 00:37:44.100
"The Bone Zone" is good, guys.

00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:46.090
SPEAKER 1: What is
"The Bone Zone" about?

00:37:46.090 --> 00:37:47.540
PJ VOGT: What is "The
Bone Zone" about, Alex?

00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:49.290
SPEAKER 1: I mean, how
good is that title?

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:50.880
Is it accurate?

00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:54.369
ALEX GOLDMAN: It's
two guys who just--

00:37:54.369 --> 00:37:55.660
PJ VOGT: It's "The Jerky Boys."

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.035
ALEX GOLDMAN: It's a little
better than "The Jerky Boys."

00:37:58.035 --> 00:38:00.180
It's two guys who make
prank phone calls.

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:02.160
PJ VOGT: They call Hugo Boss
and try to boss people around.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:03.840
ALEX GOLDMAN: They call Hugo
Boss and try and boss people

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.470
around.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:08.850
They call Red Lobster
and say, do you guys

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:10.410
have the lobster
on lobster anymore?

00:38:10.410 --> 00:38:11.868
And when they say
no, they're like,

00:38:11.868 --> 00:38:14.576
can I get you to put one lobster
on top of another lobster?

00:38:14.576 --> 00:38:16.200
I'm trying to think
of some other ones.

00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.345
They called a bunch of
places for a while asking

00:38:18.345 --> 00:38:20.970
if Tony Rice was there, and when
they'd say no, they'd be like,

00:38:20.970 --> 00:38:22.774
you just got pranked!

00:38:22.774 --> 00:38:23.690
PJ VOGT: That's funny.

00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:26.770
ALEX GOLDMAN:
Yeah, really funny.

00:38:26.770 --> 00:38:28.020
Definitely not for all tastes.

00:38:28.020 --> 00:38:29.040
Definitely not good.

00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:33.044
But I like it.

00:38:33.044 --> 00:38:33.960
SPEAKER 1: That works.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.290
All right.

00:38:34.290 --> 00:38:35.340
Let's open it up to questions.

00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.190
We'll start over here.

00:38:36.190 --> 00:38:36.480
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.355
Thank you for coming.

00:38:37.355 --> 00:38:39.390
PJ VOGT: Yeah, thank you.

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:43.040
AUDIENCE: So you host
a successful podcast

00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:44.880
on a growing network.

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.840
What's become easier for you
to do as Gimlet has grown

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:52.590
and your show remains
successful and popular?

00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:55.930
And what's become
harder for you to do?

00:38:55.930 --> 00:38:57.540
PJ VOGT: Well, I
mean, just resources,

00:38:57.540 --> 00:39:01.780
in terms of traveling to do
a story, people understanding

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:04.080
that we're a thing that's
worth an hour of their time

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.132
if we want to interview them.

00:39:06.132 --> 00:39:07.590
We have more people,
which means we

00:39:07.590 --> 00:39:10.710
can try weirder stuff, because
things can fail and that's OK,

00:39:10.710 --> 00:39:14.970
which really wasn't
true in the beginning.

00:39:14.970 --> 00:39:19.640
I've lately been feeling
that feeling of--

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:21.470
I keep thinking
about "The Simpsons"

00:39:21.470 --> 00:39:24.552
and how, if you're around long
enough, how often you come up

00:39:24.552 --> 00:39:26.760
with what you think is a
good idea, then you're like,

00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.940
oh, we did that.

00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:31.244
Like, we've had that question.

00:39:31.244 --> 00:39:33.660
I feel we're lucky that we're
covering the internet, which

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.820
is not a stable, boring place.

00:39:35.820 --> 00:39:38.560
But I've felt that
anxiety, lately, more.

00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.230
ALEX GOLDMAN: Me, too.

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:42.810
Yeah, we're almost
100 episodes in.

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:46.110
And every once in
a while, we'll have

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:49.540
a really fallow
period and PJ will

00:39:49.540 --> 00:39:51.030
be like, we're out of stories.

00:39:51.030 --> 00:39:52.664
And then a month
later, he'll be like,

00:39:52.664 --> 00:39:54.330
we're never going to
run out of stories.

00:39:54.330 --> 00:39:56.246
PJ VOGT: Yeah, we're out
of stories right now.

00:39:56.246 --> 00:39:58.710
So that's the prism that
I'm answering that question

00:39:58.710 --> 00:40:00.510
through.

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:03.140
I honestly think I won't
have an idea again.

00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:05.160
We'll see.

00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:06.060
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.000
PJ VOGT: Thanks.

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.880
AUDIENCE: So thanks for coming.

00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:11.670
I did want to say,
Sruthi Pinnamaneni

00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:13.070
is amazing and awesome.

00:40:13.070 --> 00:40:13.340
ALEX GOLDMAN: Yes.

00:40:13.340 --> 00:40:14.215
PJ VOGT: Yes, she is.

00:40:14.215 --> 00:40:16.170
AUDIENCE: Too bad
she's not here.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:20.970
And what I wanted to ask you is,
so since you started the show,

00:40:20.970 --> 00:40:23.610
it seems like memes
have taken on a kind

00:40:23.610 --> 00:40:27.000
of political significance
and a relevance

00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.320
that they didn't
necessarily have before.

00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:33.070
They've become more powerful,
more disturbing in many ways.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:37.680
And I'm wondering, how has
that changed how you approach

00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.936
a segment like "Yes Yes No"?

00:40:39.936 --> 00:40:42.060
PJ VOGT: Yeah, we were
talking about this recently.

00:40:42.060 --> 00:40:43.740
I mean, weirdly,
in some ways, it

00:40:43.740 --> 00:40:45.360
makes that segment
work less well,

00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:49.110
only because the sort of
toxic, weird, dark stuff

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:51.720
that was on the internet is
now so much in the culture

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:54.510
that a lot of these memes
just aren't obscure.

00:40:54.510 --> 00:40:57.656
It makes it more fun when
it works, because it just

00:40:57.656 --> 00:41:00.030
feels like internet culture
is culture, rather than being

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:00.960
something to the side.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.130
And so even though it's
not fun to be talking

00:41:03.130 --> 00:41:07.470
about the wacky origins
of some neo-Nazi in-joke,

00:41:07.470 --> 00:41:12.350
from a reporting standpoint, or
from a journalistic standpoint,

00:41:12.350 --> 00:41:18.990
it matters now, or sometimes it
matters, and that feels good.

00:41:18.990 --> 00:41:21.160
It feels like, oh,
it's actually--

00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:24.420
there's a utility to explaining
this, instead of just

00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:26.239
celebrating something
for being obscure.

00:41:26.239 --> 00:41:27.530
ALEX GOLDMAN: I agree with him.

00:41:31.016 --> 00:41:32.020
AUDIENCE: Hey.

00:41:32.020 --> 00:41:34.360
I was wondering how
similar or different

00:41:34.360 --> 00:41:36.730
your work is on
podcasts to what it

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:38.650
was when you were doing radio.

00:41:38.650 --> 00:41:39.810
PJ VOGT: Yeah.

00:41:39.810 --> 00:41:41.519
What would you say?

00:41:41.519 --> 00:41:43.060
ALEX GOLDMAN: It's
totally different.

00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:44.991
I can't think of
anything that is similar.

00:41:44.991 --> 00:41:46.990
PJ VOGT: There are some
things that are similar.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:47.860
ALEX GOLDMAN: Can you tell me?

00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:49.068
PJ VOGT: We interview people.

00:41:49.068 --> 00:41:50.350
We edit those interviews down.

00:41:50.350 --> 00:41:52.766
We write script in between it
to explain and contextualize

00:41:52.766 --> 00:41:53.810
what they say.

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:58.260
Our stories tend to
be five to 30 minutes.

00:41:58.260 --> 00:42:00.160
We don't have to worry about--

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:03.500
like, we did a story that was
about experimenting with LSD.

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:05.915
We couldn't have done
that on the radio.

00:42:05.915 --> 00:42:07.040
ALEX GOLDMAN: We can swear.

00:42:07.040 --> 00:42:08.170
PJ VOGT: We can swear.

00:42:08.170 --> 00:42:09.945
ALEX GOLDMAN: We don't have
to worry about the clock.

00:42:09.945 --> 00:42:12.278
Things can be as long or as
short as we want them to be.

00:42:12.278 --> 00:42:14.860
PJ VOGT: Which is so oppressive
and constant in radio.

00:42:14.860 --> 00:42:16.420
Like, where really,
you're like, this

00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:17.800
has to be 12 and a half minutes.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.744
And if there's 15
interesting minutes,

00:42:19.744 --> 00:42:21.160
they're going to
have to come out.

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:22.899
And if there's seven
interesting minutes,

00:42:22.899 --> 00:42:24.190
you're going to have to pad it.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:28.330
That's a very real,
ceaseless problem in radio,

00:42:28.330 --> 00:42:29.500
that we just don't--

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:31.000
the thing we have
to deal with is

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.670
we need a story that can
carry over an ad break.

00:42:33.670 --> 00:42:35.290
That's the hardest.

00:42:35.290 --> 00:42:38.212
ALEX GOLDMAN: And a lot of
times, that is a real problem.

00:42:38.212 --> 00:42:39.670
PJ VOGT: Yeah, but
it's not-- like,

00:42:39.670 --> 00:42:41.570
that's the one thing
that it gives you.

00:42:41.570 --> 00:42:44.520
No, podcasting is great.

00:42:44.520 --> 00:42:46.300
Also, the people that
listen to the show

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.175
are more likely to have
found it because they

00:42:48.175 --> 00:42:50.330
want to hear it, versus
I was listening to NPR

00:42:50.330 --> 00:42:52.660
and then this crap
came on, which

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:55.156
is like, it forces you to--

00:42:55.156 --> 00:42:57.280
on podcasting, you can
trust that your audience has

00:42:57.280 --> 00:42:59.360
heard you before and
that they're game.

00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.036
ALEX GOLDMAN: Right.

00:43:01.036 --> 00:43:01.980
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:03.780
PJ VOGT: Thank you.

00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.320
AUDIENCE: So "This
American Life"

00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.704
was probably the
first radio show

00:43:06.704 --> 00:43:08.120
that I listened
to that would just

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.255
tell stories that were
so compelling that I'd

00:43:10.255 --> 00:43:12.880
have to sit in my car when I got
into my driveway after school,

00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:15.310
just to finish
listening to them.

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:17.620
And I was wondering, having
sort of started there

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:21.102
as an intern, PJ, to what
extent did your experience

00:43:21.102 --> 00:43:22.810
there influence the
way that you approach

00:43:22.810 --> 00:43:24.019
a story for "Reply All"?

00:43:24.019 --> 00:43:25.560
Because I definitely
kind of get some

00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:27.595
of the same magic feelings.

00:43:27.595 --> 00:43:28.720
PJ VOGT: Well, thank you.

00:43:28.720 --> 00:43:32.860
I mean, for me, that
place is church.

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:37.430
Like, the values that they have,
and the craft that they have,

00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:41.410
it's a standard that I think
about pretty constantly.

00:43:41.410 --> 00:43:43.241
I think that there
is a mode of story

00:43:43.241 --> 00:43:44.740
that I'll report
on "Reply All" that

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:50.300
feels like me doing my best to
do an homage to what they do.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:54.880
Like, the Brinkley story
we just did, it's written--

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:57.130
it doesn't rely on Alex
and I's conversation.

00:43:57.130 --> 00:44:00.540
Those stories feel
more to their thing.

00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:04.615
Tim, who is our editor and
executive producer, just

00:44:04.615 --> 00:44:07.484
the brilliant person
on staff, he's

00:44:07.484 --> 00:44:08.650
always pushing us out of it.

00:44:08.650 --> 00:44:11.800
He's always pushing for
more of me and Alex.

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.870
Or he's like, stop
writing so much.

00:44:13.870 --> 00:44:14.980
He hates writing.

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.790
I love writing.

00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:18.106
But I still think--

00:44:18.106 --> 00:44:19.480
I still just listen
to that show,

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.645
and I'm just like, how
do you guys do this?

00:44:21.645 --> 00:44:22.780
It's so crazy.

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.840
They're so good, and they
do so many different things,

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:27.100
and they do them so well.

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:29.290
It's not fair.

00:44:29.290 --> 00:44:29.790
Yeah.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.120
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:39.020
So being at a technology
company, and more specifically,

00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:41.570
a technology company
that has its hands

00:44:41.570 --> 00:44:44.420
pretty deeply into
advertising, it's hard for me

00:44:44.420 --> 00:44:47.000
not to look at podcasting
through kind of a technology

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.080
lens.

00:44:48.080 --> 00:44:49.890
And a lot of times,
I look at podcasts,

00:44:49.890 --> 00:44:52.610
and I think about how
primitive of a technology

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:56.180
it is with things like
prerecorded ad breaks

00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:58.820
and I don't know what type of
listener attribution statistics

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.783
you're able to get
and things like that.

00:45:00.783 --> 00:45:01.366
PJ VOGT: None.

00:45:01.366 --> 00:45:03.265
ALEX GOLDMAN: Not true.

00:45:03.265 --> 00:45:04.140
PJ VOGT: Very little.

00:45:04.140 --> 00:45:04.976
AUDIENCE: You know, like,
aside from the number

00:45:04.976 --> 00:45:06.770
of subscribers on iTunes.

00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:11.180
And so I love podcasts
because I love the content.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:15.800
And I've at times wondered,
is the primitive technology

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:20.900
holding back content
producers from maximizing

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.390
their revenue streams in
a way that might threaten

00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:25.052
this thing that I really enjoy?

00:45:25.052 --> 00:45:26.510
ALEX GOLDMAN: It's
shuffling along.

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:29.370
It's getting better.

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:31.550
We dynamically insert
the ads in our show now.

00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:33.470
So you can yank them out.

00:45:33.470 --> 00:45:36.410
We can resell ads
on our back catalog.

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:38.990
We have that
capability, which is

00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:43.700
huge in terms of monetization.

00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:50.510
With respect to being able
to chart our listeners,

00:45:50.510 --> 00:45:55.010
right now it's like our ratings
are probably about as accurate

00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:55.814
as Nielsen ratings.

00:45:55.814 --> 00:45:57.230
Not like we have
Nielsen families,

00:45:57.230 --> 00:46:00.430
but we know who downloads it.

00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:03.020
Or we know when it is
streamed to someone.

00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:05.870
So we get a number of people
who have downloaded it,

00:46:05.870 --> 00:46:08.930
downloaded and streamed it, and
that's total downloads for us.

00:46:08.930 --> 00:46:10.580
We don't know--

00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.410
I mean, we also are on
Spotify, which has an actual--

00:46:13.410 --> 00:46:15.290
which has pretty
detailed information

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:18.200
about when people start
listening and stop listening.

00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:21.000
But other than that, we
don't have that information.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.580
However, I am told that
in the next couple weeks,

00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:29.510
we will be able to tell if
anyone is listening on iTunes,

00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:31.250
at what point do
they stop listening,

00:46:31.250 --> 00:46:34.012
which is very exciting.

00:46:34.012 --> 00:46:36.470
But if people are only listening
for the first four or five

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:39.990
minutes, that's
kind of terrifying.

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:45.350
But yeah, I think that slowly,
the technology is catching up.

00:46:45.350 --> 00:46:48.230
I don't know what that means
for the future of RSS feeds

00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:52.950
and things like that,
but slow, very slowly.

00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:55.450
I think mostly since "Serial"
blew up, people were like,

00:46:55.450 --> 00:46:56.450
oh, there's market here.

00:46:56.450 --> 00:46:58.800
Should probably figure out
ways to better monetize this.

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.130
And once that happens,
dynamic ad insertion and stuff

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:02.300
like that started happening.

00:47:02.300 --> 00:47:05.415
So slowly but surely.

00:47:05.415 --> 00:47:07.040
Part of what's nice
about them, though,

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:11.270
is that they are just these
files that once you get them

00:47:11.270 --> 00:47:13.417
on your phone, they're
yours, and you can fast

00:47:13.417 --> 00:47:15.500
forward and stop and pick
it up wherever you want.

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:16.520
AUDIENCE: Works on the subway.

00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:17.353
ALEX GOLDMAN: Right.

00:47:17.353 --> 00:47:18.530
Exactly.

00:47:18.530 --> 00:47:24.710
So there is something to be said
for the primitiveness of them.

00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:28.460
SPEAKER 1: In terms of the
development of monetization,

00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:29.960
but also the
information that you're

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.850
able to get about
your listeners,

00:47:31.850 --> 00:47:36.830
to what extent does that bridge
the divide between podcasts

00:47:36.830 --> 00:47:38.810
that are either coming
out of big public radio

00:47:38.810 --> 00:47:41.840
organizations or
big podcast networks

00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:44.120
versus independent podcasters?

00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:46.130
Because one of the great
things about podcasting

00:47:46.130 --> 00:47:48.080
is that you just
need a microphone

00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.660
and a tiny bit of hosting,
and you can have one.

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:53.330
But there's also
these big institutions

00:47:53.330 --> 00:47:54.880
that continue to grow.

00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.880
PJ VOGT: I don't think--

00:47:55.880 --> 00:47:57.421
as far as I can
tell, there's nothing

00:47:57.421 --> 00:48:02.030
about the incremental
stuff going forward

00:48:02.030 --> 00:48:05.180
that should make that
divide bigger or change it.

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.070
I think everybody--
basically, it

00:48:08.070 --> 00:48:12.470
amounts to big distributors
having better analytics.

00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:14.001
Everybody should have that.

00:48:14.001 --> 00:48:15.500
I do, though--
there's a part of me,

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:16.640
and maybe it's
just superstitious,

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:19.181
that thinks that the fact that
it's primitive is good for it,

00:48:19.181 --> 00:48:22.500
that somehow, I don't know what
I think is going to happen,

00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:25.250
but sometimes automation
is bad for content.

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:28.970
Like, standardized
banner ads haven't

00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:31.205
been great for writing
on the internet.

00:48:31.205 --> 00:48:32.955
It's probably just me
being superstitious.

00:48:32.955 --> 00:48:34.160
It's good right now.

00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:36.355
And so I'm waiting
for it to get bad.

00:48:36.355 --> 00:48:38.480
And every change, I'm like,
this is going to be it.

00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.040
This is going to
ruin everything.

00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.831
It's probably not going
to ruin everything.

00:48:41.831 --> 00:48:43.076
ALEX GOLDMAN: I have no idea.

00:48:43.076 --> 00:48:46.519
SPEAKER 1: Fair enough.

00:48:46.519 --> 00:48:47.060
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:48.810
I had a question
about, you've said

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:52.340
that you have a lot of
stories in various stages

00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.200
kind of on the shelf
waiting to be revisited

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:56.150
or being worked on
at the same time.

00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:57.630
I was wondering,
what's that kind

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:02.150
of trigger that, OK, this
is ready to get in a slate,

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:04.490
this is ready to
go on the schedule?

00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:08.600
And also, have you bumped things
in order to get something out

00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:09.880
in a timely way?

00:49:09.880 --> 00:49:12.810
I'm thinking about
the Pepe the Frog.

00:49:12.810 --> 00:49:13.620
PJ VOGT: Yeah.

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:14.247
Yeah, we have.

00:49:14.247 --> 00:49:16.580
I mean, the trigger, oftentimes,
really, is desperation.

00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:21.770
Like, that thing is at 60%,
but everything else is at zero.

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:24.029
Sometimes it might mean--

00:49:24.029 --> 00:49:25.820
sometimes it's just
about getting a person.

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:27.200
Like, this will only be good--

00:49:27.200 --> 00:49:30.049
we talk about proximity
with our stories,

00:49:30.049 --> 00:49:31.340
which can mean a lot of things.

00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:33.542
But if you're talking about
an event that happened,

00:49:33.542 --> 00:49:35.000
do you have somebody
who was there,

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.250
or just somebody who talked
to somebody who was there?

00:49:37.250 --> 00:49:39.470
And sometimes you'll get
an extra proximal step,

00:49:39.470 --> 00:49:40.937
which helps.

00:49:40.937 --> 00:49:43.520
Sometimes it might just be that
you didn't know what it meant,

00:49:43.520 --> 00:49:46.970
and now you feel like you have
an idea about the question

00:49:46.970 --> 00:49:49.270
you're actually asking,
or the conclusion you

00:49:49.270 --> 00:49:50.140
think you've got.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.940
Sometimes they're
just brain changes.

00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.730
ALEX GOLDMAN: Or Tim,
who PJ previously

00:49:55.730 --> 00:50:00.470
described as a genius, will
be like, what if we try x?

00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:02.690
What if instead of
interviewing this person,

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:04.990
what if you talked to this
person about their dog?

00:50:04.990 --> 00:50:06.698
PJ VOGT: Or like with
Sruthi, Sruthi just

00:50:06.698 --> 00:50:09.024
did this story a few weeks ago.

00:50:09.024 --> 00:50:10.190
ALEX GOLDMAN: The ALS story?

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:11.565
PJ VOGT: Yeah,
the first one, she

00:50:11.565 --> 00:50:17.000
was profiling this guy who had a
really different way of looking

00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:18.380
for an ALS cure.

00:50:18.380 --> 00:50:21.470
And the story was like, it
was in that sort of like,

00:50:21.470 --> 00:50:23.720
almost ready to
go, but something--

00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.640
we thought it was
something was missing.

00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:30.044
And then we had an
edit, and I suggested,

00:50:30.044 --> 00:50:32.210
I was like, I think we're
making it too complicated.

00:50:32.210 --> 00:50:34.751
Like, there was a version of
the story that was sort of like,

00:50:34.751 --> 00:50:37.310
is what he's doing
right or wrong?

00:50:37.310 --> 00:50:39.470
Because he was
working with patients

00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:42.072
and checking out
their obscure cure

00:50:42.072 --> 00:50:43.280
to see if they could be good.

00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:45.080
And we were having this
whole moral dilemma.

00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:47.000
But everybody in the room
on the editorial staff

00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:48.124
was like, we like this guy.

00:50:48.124 --> 00:50:50.180
It doesn't seem--
we can't credibly

00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:52.010
make the other side
of this argument.

00:50:52.010 --> 00:50:53.480
And realizing we didn't
care about the argument

00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:55.330
we were telling, and
realizing, oh, it's

00:50:55.330 --> 00:50:57.110
just a story about this guy.

00:50:57.110 --> 00:50:58.544
We had the story about the guy.

00:50:58.544 --> 00:50:59.960
We had been having
trouble finding

00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:01.709
someone who could be
a good critic of him,

00:51:01.709 --> 00:51:03.750
because they didn't exist.

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:05.530
So sometimes it's
simplifying, and Tim

00:51:05.530 --> 00:51:06.990
is really good at
being like, you

00:51:06.990 --> 00:51:08.950
think your story is
these seven things.

00:51:08.950 --> 00:51:09.620
It's that thing.

00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:11.960
Just take the interesting
part and get out of here.

00:51:11.960 --> 00:51:13.751
ALEX GOLDMAN: And that
story was originally

00:51:13.751 --> 00:51:15.290
going to run the
week that we ran

00:51:15.290 --> 00:51:17.870
that episode about Pizzagate,
because Pizzagate just

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:20.040
became a thing.

00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:21.912
So I was like-- and
Sruthi was like,

00:51:21.912 --> 00:51:23.120
I'm having trouble with this.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.719
I'm really grappling
with this story.

00:51:24.719 --> 00:51:26.010
Can you come up with something?

00:51:26.010 --> 00:51:27.410
And I was like, eh.

00:51:27.410 --> 00:51:31.340
And then we did that "Yes Yes
No" about Pizzagate, and then

00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:33.680
the following day, a huge--

00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:36.230
we were like, that will be
the first half of the show.

00:51:36.230 --> 00:51:38.630
And then the following day,
just that crazy explosion

00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:41.960
took place, and, well,
when I say crazy explosion,

00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:44.280
I mean a guy walked into
the pizza place with a gun.

00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.155
So a guy walked into a
pizza place with a gun

00:51:46.155 --> 00:51:48.930
and suddenly it was
like an entire episode.

00:51:48.930 --> 00:51:50.900
So yes, things
move around a lot.

00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.150
SPEAKER 1: We've got time
for one more quick question.

00:51:53.150 --> 00:51:53.460
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:51:53.460 --> 00:51:54.635
It's a tough one.

00:51:54.635 --> 00:51:55.830
No, I'm just kidding.

00:51:55.830 --> 00:51:58.322
What's with all the
love for Matt Lieber?

00:51:58.322 --> 00:51:59.030
PJ VOGT: Oh, man.

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:04.710
He's just particularly
when Gimlet started,

00:52:04.710 --> 00:52:07.937
it was like, he was
the only person who

00:52:07.937 --> 00:52:09.020
had any understanding of--

00:52:12.828 --> 00:52:14.870
he does so many things
that are so good,

00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:16.220
and they're so hard to describe.

00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.850
And so that's where
that comes from.

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.990
But he's just a
grown-up who makes sure

00:52:20.990 --> 00:52:23.860
that everything is
going to be OK tomorrow,

00:52:23.860 --> 00:52:25.590
and there's going
to be a budget,

00:52:25.590 --> 00:52:28.770
and nothing is
going to disappear.

00:52:28.770 --> 00:52:31.410
ALEX GOLDMAN: Well, also, when
there were only five people

00:52:31.410 --> 00:52:33.090
at the company, we
were like, let's just

00:52:33.090 --> 00:52:34.140
put everybody in the credits.

00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:35.460
And Matt was like,
don't put me in.

00:52:35.460 --> 00:52:36.040
PJ VOGT: Don't put me in.

00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:37.320
ALEX GOLDMAN:
Don't put me in it.

00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:38.850
So we were like, OK,
let's put him in.

00:52:38.850 --> 00:52:40.225
And let's continue
to put him in.

00:52:40.225 --> 00:52:43.680
And let's put him in more
