THE TACKIEST OF MYTHS.

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:09.801
OH, WOW.

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:12.734
CAN A BUG GLUE TRAP BE SCALED UP
TO A SIZE

00:00:12.734 --> 00:00:14.234
THAT CAN CAPTURE A HUMAN?

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:15.534

TIME TO GET COOKING IN
THE MYTHBUSTERS TEST KITCHEN,

00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:30.434
WHERE THE SEMISOLID SUBSTANCE
NEEDS TO BE HEATED UP

00:00:30.434 --> 00:00:32.367
BEFORE IT'S POURED OUT...

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:34.000

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.367
OH, MY GOD.

00:00:49.734 --> 00:00:54.234
SO IMAGINE LIKE 200 GUM
STUCK TO YOUR SHOE

00:00:54.234 --> 00:00:56.000
ON A HOT SUMMER DAY.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.467
UGH.

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:00.868
-YES.

-$20.
-THAT'S $25.

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:12.300

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.200
Narrator: THE FINAL YEA OR NAY

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.467

MUCH TO HIS CHAGRIN,
JESSE ENDS UP FACE-FIRST...

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.834
MY SOCK GOT STUCK.

00:01:30.267 --> 00:01:33.400
Rachel: THAT WAS THE FUNNIEST
THING I'VE SEEN ALL DAY.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.567
...AND 25 BUCKS POORER.

00:01:37.934 --> 00:01:40.767
OKAY, WELL, I THINK
WE FOUND OUR GLUE.

00:01:40.767 --> 00:01:43.501
WE DIDN'T GET STUCK, BUT
HOPEFULLY WHEN WE SUPERSIZE THIS

00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:46.467
AND THE GLUE THICKENS,
MAYBE WE WILL.

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.901
I'M GONNA NEED THESE.

00:01:48.901 --> 00:01:51.133
UGH.

00:01:55.534 --> 00:01:56.767
OH, MY GOD.
