00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.660
&gt;&gt; Well, this is my first time at Davos. I've
watched earlier meetings on television, but

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.260
it's interesting to be here. The one thing
that really stands out is no matter which

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.330
conference I attend, there seems to be very
close to a consensus on many issues. There

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.169
are one or two dissenters here and there but
generally whether it's the economy, the environment,

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:33.309
or politics, people seem to agree that right
now we are in a big crisis, and which is self

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:39.110
evident of course, but also at this time it
has really brought home to everyone that everything

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.920
is interconnected. There seems to be you can't
talk about one thing without it having an

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.920
impact on another area. That has been very
interesting to watch. I also had a chance

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.070
to watch some kids yesterday, especially I
think some of the young speakers from Malawi,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.329
really made an impact. It's been great fun.
