00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880
Hey, it's me, Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I want this video to be long and I want it to get down into the weeds

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.500
and just air out and let me get as technical as I want to,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.880
so I'm gonna mention this sponsor right now upfront, which is different, I know.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.320
But I want to say thank you to 23andMe for sponsoring this episode of Smarter Every Day.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.900
I've been to their lab too, its a really cool place.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.060
So, I'll tell you more about their at-home genetic test service later in the episode

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.880
but, for now let's talk about Haptic Gloves.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.100
In the last episode of Smarter Everyday you got to see me interact with the Haptic Glove

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.020
and it changed my mind about VR (Virtual Reality)

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.060
and here's the deal, when you're a start up company, it's a double-edged sword, right?

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.100
You want people to know that you're doing these great wonderful things

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.060
so you can get investors and stuff like that.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.240
But conversely you don't want them to know the "secret sauce" because

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:45.900
you gotta maintain your competitive edge, right?

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.340
So, the fun thing about this is when I got down to talking to the engineers

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.300
at like the fundamental Haptic Pixel level on how this thing works, you can see their eyes

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.000
dartin' around the room, like they freak out.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.520
The reason they freak out is, because they haven't been permitted to talk about how this glove works

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.660
in forever apparently and then this dude walks in with a camera and sticks a camera in his face

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.820
and asks him very technical questions, its really fun to see their reaction

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.000
but, I was able to sign some paper work and we were able to work out a deal so that

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.720
I can take you right up to the edge of proprietary information, but not cross that line

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.300
so that they can still maintain their edge.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.340
So after I met the founder Jake and the co-founder Bob, they turned me over to the head of engineering ops,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.160
Lathe, to asks questions.

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.900
And in the last video we went through what the experience was like, this time I just wanted to focus

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.260
on how everything works

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.620
I decided to just go for it and ask Keenan what kind of actuators they used to simulate touch.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.040
-So, I am going to wear a glove under the glove.
-Correct, its just for sanitary purposes.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.400
-I am really excited right now.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.400
-So the question I have is, if...

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.720
-if I need... if I touch on my hand right here and I am supposed to feel the presence of something there.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.440
-In order to have an actuator in that location you have to have a ton of different valves for example if you're using pneumatics.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.080
-or you know, linear actuators if you're using 
electro-mechanical actuators.
-Yes.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.460
-So how do you get around that problem?

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:12.320
-We describe them as like, Haptic Pixels and each Pixel would be its own... pneumatic actuator

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.280
-and they are arrayed over your hand.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.900
-Okay, I'm ready for it.  Yeah.
-Okay.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:18.920
-How many of these exist?

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.440
-Umm...

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.480
-I don't think I can share that.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.500
-Okay (both Laugh)

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.700
-Cool.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.700
-So we'll just pull this down and I'll help you

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.540
-Put these on

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.820
-Ah, so you're aligning it to my finger.  Oh, wow.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.600
-Yup.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.940
-Well, what are these?

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.920
-So, we...

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.420
-We, uh..., ahh...

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.960
-They don't want to talk about anything!

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.120
-Okay, so we developed a custom motion tracking solution that uses both optical and magnetic tracking

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.580
-to get really accurate positions
of each one of your fingertips.
-Yes.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:04.680
-And then we do some crazy stuff in the software and using all that information we can figure out where all your fingers are in space.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.440
Yes and what I learned from my class I'm taking at school is, there is a lot of cordinate transformations happening in my hand right now.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.820
Right? Are they happening in my hand or are they happening off my hand in the processor?

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.520
They're happening in the computer

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.500
I know the math and that's awesome! Alright lets do it!

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.220
After running the simulation I learned one of the  most important concepts, it's called the two point threshold.

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.700
You've had to have done a study on this. You figured out the specific bladder density that you need

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.380
in order to trick the brain

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.880
 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.640
knowing that it's not gonna go

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.860
photorealistic and feel like complete imersion.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.520
Is that true?

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.400
Yeah. There's actually a medically known

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.460
metric called the two point threshold.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.680
Which is basically if you take two pencils and poke somebody on the skin,

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.920
how close together do those get before they can't tell that it's two seperate points?

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.620
I keep calling them bladders what's the actual word?

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.020
Ah...we call them tactors.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.440
So the spacial resolution of the tactors

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.240
just has to be inside of the two point resolution

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:02.300
of the human hand.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.700
It's a little more complicated than that.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.960
I mean the two point threshold is one of very many

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.840
aspects of touch and I am not the most qualified person to talk to you about that.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.800
and we do have a couple of folks here that can talk for a very long time about it

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.560
-So I'm Destin. 
-Hey I'm Adam.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:20.640
So how do you develop software for something that has never been done like this before?

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.860
like do you create you own language

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.020
for the glove?

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:29.080
So...the way the software works is that it takes

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.100
information from the physics engine

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.880
and then we have to figure out how to render that

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.440
And you know it's pneumatic

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.920
We have to figure out how to open and close valves in the right order and all that sort of thing.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.520
So the software does that.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:43.980
So you have 150-something valves or whatever it is you have to control,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.800
and you have to control it almost real time,

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.900
You know your latency don't you?

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.020
-Yeah
-Yeah

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.260
So, and you're not gonna tell me that I'm assuming.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.960
-I'm not talking about that

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.360
(both laugh)

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:59.720
So you have to, It has to be quick enough where a human can think that they're actually engaged with it.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.140
So there is a threshhold there.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:02.800
There is a threshold and they've done studies on it.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.380
They found that anything longer than a quarter of a second is too long.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.300
You lose the temporal connection between the things.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.760
-But if you go below like..you know.. half that then the brain
-You're fine?

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.820
Yeah your brain doesn't know.

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.400
They're discussing about whether or not a I get to see a tactor

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.660
I really wanna see a tactor

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.620
(laughs)

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.920
Who do I talk to to see a tactor?

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.340
Do you think..do you think Lathe will let me see-? Ok.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.880
-We're looking at the website for that.
-They're looking at the website.

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:29.700
Because thats one of the rules we were given

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.380
If its on the website then we can- we can show you.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.620
Gotcha. Ok cool.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.960
Have you ever met someone that you just click with?

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:36.960
You're on the same wavelength instantly?

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:40.280
This is Mark. The other engineers call him "Mr. Glove".

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.520
This is the guy that knows all the things

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.720
The fun part about this conversation is if you watch Mark's eyes,

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.100
it's clear that he just wants to "geek out",

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:49.160
but he can't,

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.460
because someone set up this proprietary borderline that he can't cross.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.920
Anyway, this is one of the most enjoyable conversations I've had in a really long time.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:58.660
-So that's Mark.
-Hi

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.600
So...this is it huh?

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.940
Yeah, and they're really pretty simple.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:05.740
As you said they're pnuematic, as you guessed they're a bladder.

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.800
So right here I'm looking at the end

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.980
-So I'm seeing...how many is that, 12?
-Mhm

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:14.820
What do you call- so this is a tactor. So what are these individual dots called?

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.740
We actually call the individual dots tactors and the whole thing is a panel.

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.380
So we group a bunch of tactors together on a panel,

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.540
it makes it easier to route air to them,

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:25.540
makes it easier to support them,

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:29.440
and we can control each of them individually.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.960
Look I know we're in the weeds here but Mark's about to
describe a bunch of neat little things about your hands.

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.060
So if you'll check out
your hands and do these little activities as he's describing them,

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.300
you'll understand things that you've never even thought about before.

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.760
Like the squish of your skin as you touch a hard object.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.820
If you will use your hands to do
them as he's talking

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.080
you will understand the sense of touch on a much greater level.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.080
So this is the spot where the

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.400
research stuff that you have to get into
kind of moves away from the traditional

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.030
electrical mechanical engineering and
kind of moves into how the brain works.

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:04.560
It moves into ergonmics, it moves into
human factors, and it moves into psychometrics

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:06.700
Psychometrics...I don't even know
what that means

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:12.890
It's how people process things.
It's how your brain works for sensation.

00:07:12.890 --> 00:07:16.250
I don't know if you've ever seen
something called the sensory homunculus

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.530
it's a picture of a person scaled

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:24.770
relative to how many nerve endings they
have in different parts of their bodies.

00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:29.520
It's basically a surface density of your
your tactile receptors.

00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:33.200
-Is that a good way to say it?
-It's a very good way of saying it.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.840
These panels, we think a lot about the huge hands part of that.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.840
They're incredibly sensitive.

00:07:39.620 --> 00:07:47.220
And so figuring out how to design a piece of
equipment that is high fidelity and

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:53.180
capable enough of tricking those sense
organs is a lot of what our challenge is.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:58.790
-Okay so you're inflating
this particular tactor here right?
-Right

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:00.860
-It's like a balloon right?
-Mhm

00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:03.720
If I were to touch this table with my hand right now, okay

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.620
Touch the table.

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:13.900
So it's not a step function it's a curve, but it's not linear either.

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.480
-Right.
-Because as you press in on
something there's thickness to my skin

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:25.400
and so it starts as a line and then it ramps up and then it gets harder and harder and harder right?

00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:28.320
-Absolutely.
-Is it an exponential curve?

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.800
Do you know what that curve is?

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.860
You don't have to tell me what it is.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:39.860
You're hitting on a great question which is what that approach and that that curve of displacement looks like.

00:08:41.160 --> 00:08:45.760
Remembering that your fingers are sense organs. One of the ways they sense is by stretching, right?

00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:48.600
They're deformed. And you actually feel that deformation.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:56.220
So there's "what is your skin doing?" Which is, it actually gets stiffer as you push on it harder and harder

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:59.640
-And that's part of why we have such good...
-Dexterity?
-Right.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:04.140
The other part of it is "what's the
material you're pushing into?"

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.440
In some cases, if that material is soft, well that's gonna deform as well.

00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:09.060
So you can have slightly different approach.

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.880
-Yeah
-Like we're sacks of watery meat stuff

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:16.680
and so the relative difference between the
hardness of the object you're touching

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:19.420
is going to affect the attack time

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:23.200
-I don't know what term you 
used but I would say attack time- 
-Rise time.

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.900
-Rise time?
-Mhm

00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:26.620
This is all making sense.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:31.440
There's also little things like how well does your glove fit?

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.100
That's why when I put the glove on, it felt like there was...

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.720
a physical thimble that goes on the end of my finger

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:42.760
is because you wanted a tactor to be aligned with my finger just like that, right?

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.720
-Right
-Is that because
you have to have something to react against?

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.020
-Correct
-Is that why you did that?
-Yep

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.140
When you're touching something, it's not just the feedback you feel on your skin,

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:57.140
but also the feedback you feel in your joints, your tendons, as you push
against it.

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.020
So you want to make sure to combine both of those.

00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.960
You're absolutely right. And I've never thought about that at all.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.780
If I grab something...if I grab this.

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:07.560
And I squeeze it,

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:13.820
I can tell how big it is
because of where my tendons are.

00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.100
And I can tell how hard it is because of how hard I'm squeezing it

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:20.700
and it's deflecting my skin between my bones,

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:24.920
and all that goes into...it rolls up into one transfer function...

00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.960
...to give you the
answer of what object is in your hand.
-Right.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:30.540
And that's where things get
complicated.

00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:34.540
Your world revolves around boundary conditions doesn't it? Like mathematical boundary conditions.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:39.140
Pretty much yeah. Boundary conditions and contact mechanics.

00:10:39.140 --> 00:10:42.320
So what is this right here? This tape that I'm seeing?

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.660
It looks like a tape measure that's pulling back.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.120
That's the force feedback system.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.200
That's what stops your hand from closing when you grab an object.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.580
-It's a boundary condition.
-Yes.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:55.560
It's a boundary condition. So instead of pushing on this side of the hand,

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:00.440
you're actually pulling from the other side of the hand, and that's what stops the hand from moving.

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.420
Correct

00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:04.680
And so you have to have some kind of braking mechanism back here...

00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:07.640
So, can you crush things?

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.860
Like if you have something virtually can you set a resistance?

00:11:10.980 --> 00:11:13.980
Like if I were to touch
something hard versus something soft,

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.540
can you vary that force feedback?

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:18.540
(nervous sound)

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.260
-Yes.
-Okay.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:24.920
Yes. Okay.
(laughter)

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:29.460
These guys are like: "everything's proprietary just wear the glove, stupid boy"

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.680
I think that one was just a complicated answer.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.660
That was a complicated answer?

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:35.240
That one is really complicated.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:39.380
So something that matters here is, the entire volume...

00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:42.620
-There's a time it takes to do that compression.
-Right.

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:48.320
So there's a lag associated with...
It's basically the elasticity of the volume right?

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.700
What's the word?

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.220
well there's a question of "how fast you can push air through to this guy?"

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.280
and that gives you 
how fast you can run that tactor.

00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.280
So it's this balance between having enough
pressure to activate the system in fast time,

00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:03.260
granted you're going through a
small tube.

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:07.240
So the effusion rate of the gas is important. 
So you've got all that figured out.

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.860
And there's mechanical lag associated
with the effusion rate,

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:14.660
or the head pressure is what it's called.

00:12:14.660 --> 00:12:16.640
Yeah. With the velocity of the fluid.

00:12:16.940 --> 00:12:21.780
The feedback diagram, or the the block diagram of how perfecting this looks

00:12:21.780 --> 00:12:25.400
it's gonna look like a plus and a minus
between you two guys right?

00:12:25.620 --> 00:12:28.460
And include some electrical engineers in there for good measure.

00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.660
We don't- nobody cares 
about electrical engineers let's be honest

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.580
(laughter)
Just pretend I didn't say that.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.740
I'm with Jeffery an electrical engineer.

00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:39.140
So Jeffery I know how the tactors work.

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.680
Or at least I've seen them. I think I figured it out.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:44.380
-You felt them?
-I felt them

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:48.840
I make sure we have good information about where the
fingertips and the other parts of the hand are,

00:12:49.060 --> 00:12:52.620
so that we can turn on tactors
at the right times to the right pressures.

00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:54.000
Dude that's awesome.

00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.820
I mean those valves that you're controlling, can you talk about that at all?

00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:59.500
I can't talk about the type of valve we use,

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:05.400
but the timing and the hydraulics problem that you mentioned are things we work on pretty frequently.

00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.500
It's important to get them inflated the right amounts at the right times.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:15.580
We kind of get a pass on how accurate that is 
just because of how slow sensation is.

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:18.380
-Right
-You know people's perception of touch especially

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.760
is not nearly as fast as things like
vision or sound.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.920
-Especially thermally. I'm assuming that's 
something you guys are...
-Thats particularly slow.

00:13:27.380 --> 00:13:30.920
Ed was telling me about the thermal
component to this.

00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:34.340
Both of these objects are 73 degrees but
that metal feels way colder.

00:13:34.340 --> 00:13:38.800
Yes when you're touching these objects you're not just feeling the temperature of the objects,

00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:42.380
but you're feeling the heat transfer between
them and your hand.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.140
And that's because...

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:49.840
The reason the metal feels colder is because
it has a higher thermal conductivity than the wood does.

00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:53.200
-So it's like sapping more heat out of your hand.
-That's exactly right yeah.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:14:00.500
You're gonna model different types of objects by making more water flow or float a different temperature

00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.500
to pull more heat out of your fingers
that's basically what you're doing.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:08.519
Yeah that's that's exactly right and it's important that we don't just flow water at the right temperature,

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:13.499
but we've flow it at the temperature
that you makes you think you're touching

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.200
the real objects with
different thermal conductivities.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:19.700
Adam showed me another demonstrator where a
dragon flies across the room

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:24.340
and breathes fire on my hand which I can feel both thermally and like touch,

00:14:24.340 --> 00:14:27.540
and then it breathes ice on my hand, which felt cold.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.080
Now what's clear to me is there they've got to be 
using fluid at this point,

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.840
because that's the only way you can 
remove that much heat.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.840
So I think there's a tactor for touch
and a pad for thermal.

00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:42.760
but I think they're separated
within the 2-point threshold.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.480
They wouldn't tell me.
I wasn't permitted to look.

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:46.960
But one thing that was really interesting,

00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:50.320
If you switch from hot to cold, it (snaps fingers) happened really fast.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.720
So they have to dump the hot
from the lines and get cold in there fast.

00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:01.060
So there's a lot going on here
and I want to know mechanically how they do this.

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.660
This is a heat exchange problem.

00:15:02.660 --> 00:15:05.920
-This was number two?
-This is number two, you tried number three.

00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.300
Awesome so this is second generation.

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.660
Ok so it's just one hand stationary in location.

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:14.920
Oh god that makes so much sense.

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.900
If I were to develop this, I would have started at
moving the hand in space

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:23.740
and then add the haptics to that but instead you
started with the haptics

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.120
We knew people could do motion capture -- that's
been done before -- so we wanted to start

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.459
with the thing that hadn't been done.
-Clever

00:15:30.459 --> 00:15:32.960
keep your thumb beside your hand as you go in

00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:37.790
How are you doing that? I would expect
that that's fluid in there or that's

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:42.560
actually a solid that I'm touching.
You're not allowed to tell me?

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.760
I'm looking at Lathe right now just to see.

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.800
(offscreen) It's hot and cold fluid
- Gotcha

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:56.960
it's a chunk of snow it's a snowball oh
it's a dragon oh it's gonna burn my hand

00:15:56.960 --> 00:16:08.780
I don't think it likes being poked oh
shit that's awesome okay that's good so

00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:14.770
you guys like Game of Thrones so it's a
combination of the tactors firing and

00:16:14.770 --> 00:16:19.190
temperature control. so you haven't
implemented temperature control into--

00:16:19.190 --> 00:16:21.860
-Not in the glove, the glove does not have thermal

00:16:21.860 --> 00:16:24.080
Is that a goal?

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:25.800
I don't think I can talk about that
(Laughter)

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:26.980
That's awsome, so

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:33.770
so what we've learned is it's how far
the tactors are fired, the rate at which

00:16:33.770 --> 00:16:39.410
they they are fired, so it's not just the rise time.
The timing is important, not just the rise

00:16:39.410 --> 00:16:44.030
time but the the impact timing is
important the heat transfer with fluid

00:16:44.030 --> 00:16:47.900
which is something obviously they don't
want to talk about obviously they're

00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.460
working on it that's amazing that all
that stuff actually tricks your brain it

00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:57.080
does a really good job of tricking your
brain which I did not expect and I did

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.280
not like VR up at this point seriously
that's pretty cool we're living in the

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:04.730
future haptic gloves you're touching
stuff in virtual reality I'm about to

00:17:04.730 --> 00:17:08.600
tell you about the sponsor which is
23andme 23 pairs of human chromosomes

00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:11.600
where the name comes from if you don't
know about 23andme the way it works is

00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:13.312
you go to 23andme.com/Smarter.

00:17:13.312 --> 00:17:15.709
I'd appreciate it if you use that link you

00:17:15.709 --> 00:17:19.700
get this vial you spit in it and you
send it off you can do one of the two

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:23.870
kits you can do the health and ancestry
kit or just the ancestry kit but if you

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:27.440
have any questions about where this goes
I did a whole video at their lab the

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:31.220
cool thing about this though you get
this report online you can learn stuff

00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.930
about your body about your family it's
it's amazing but here's the deal the

00:17:35.930 --> 00:17:41.180
Food and Drug Administration the FDA
just recently approved 23andmes ability

00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:44.630
to release new genetic marker
information and I don't want to go into

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:47.960
the specifics of what that is
but it's stuff you care about and this

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:52.400
is new like this is future stuff okay so
go to 23andme.com/Smarter

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.980
and at least read about the new information

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.240
that 23andme can release to you because

00:17:58.250 --> 00:18:02.030
the FDA allowed it it's cool stuff so I
would appreciate it if you participate

00:18:02.030 --> 00:18:06.740
in the future with me and go 23andme.com/Smarter
you're smart people

00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:10.520
you know how this works: that helps smarter every day.
I hope you love this cuz we're

00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:13.580
stinking in the future like right now
and it reminds me of when I was a kid

00:18:13.580 --> 00:18:17.330
and used to watch Beyond 2000 with my
dad I feel like I'm getting to make that

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:22.040
that show now, which is cool. Anyway,
please consider going to 23andme.com/Smarter

00:18:22.040 --> 00:18:25.370
that's support Smarter Every Day.
Please consider subscribing,

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:29.240
if you enjoyed this video, if not, that's no big
deal. Thanks for coming along on the ride with me.

00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:34.910
Anyway, I'm Destin, you're getting
smarter every day. Have a good one, bye!

00:18:34.910 --> 00:18:38.330
So I feel like I sufficiently understand at
least a little bit of the system yeah

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:42.560
thank you very much! It's Mark, right?
Yeah.
So I have found the wizard for the glove,

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.190
it's Mark.
