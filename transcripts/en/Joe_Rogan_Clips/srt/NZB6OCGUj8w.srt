1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,550
When you put together these drills and
you put together these programs, do you,

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,080
do you just sit down and map it all out
in your head? Do you think like, okay,

3
00:00:08,081 --> 00:00:13,010
how am I going to emulate the kind of
stress in a like a life or death gunfight?

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,310
Your,
your heart rate jacked.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,150
You might have to physically do something
meant to run from someone or climb

6
00:00:19,151 --> 00:00:22,350
over something. Is that how
you do? How do you create yeah,

7
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:24,880
you're talking about like the
youtube stuff where I do the yeah,

8
00:00:24,881 --> 00:00:29,770
like physical thing with the shoe.
Yeah. The first thing I do is I,

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,990
I put it on my calendar just so I know
that I'm going to make one and then I'll

10
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:38,740
start thinking about or what haven't
I done? Cause I have to think also,

11
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,960
uh,
I have to think about the audience,

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:49,060
the audience that follows me on youtube.
A lot of more gun guys. So they want,

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,450
they want to know about the gun that
I'm using to have to think about that.

14
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,640
And then I have to think,
all right,

15
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,540
what challenge can cause I
want guys to replicate it.

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:02,070
I want them to like put those
little notes on the Uta.

17
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:05,260
I did this and my time was a
minute and 30, or whatever it was.

18
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,780
So I want him to be able to
replicate them as well. And um,

19
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,270
Juan make them,
uh,

20
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,090
rear with some real world
application in mind, you know,

21
00:01:19,091 --> 00:01:22,660
so front loading a sandbag or uh,
getting in,

22
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:27,680
pulling something in and out of a call
and doing that with the [inaudible].

23
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,460
Have you punched your reputations?
You know,

24
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:32,170
when you're doing dead weight
in and out of a car, you know,

25
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,020
150 pounds pulling it in, pushing it out,
pulling it back in and pushing it out.

26
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,300
That'll smoke every freaking ounce of
your being and it'll crush your spirits.

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,060
I know. It's crazy,
right? A full grown woman,

28
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,310
you will be able to pick her
up and put it in a car. Easy.

29
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,440
No hard tried getting her out. Right.
Especially if there's no, you know,

30
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:55,710
you gotta think deadweight yeah,
what did this person is incapacitated.

31
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,910
They ain't helping you.
Those arms just, you know,

32
00:01:59,730 --> 00:02:04,730
those limbs are moving everywhere
and it is a pain in the Dick.

33
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:09,730
Yeah, you're way better off with 150
pound barbell. Oh yeah. That way.

34
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,100
Yeah. It's like, all right. That's just
that, just your shoulder pull it out and,

35
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,710
yeah. So, but I kept to keep
those things. Yeah. Mine.

36
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:23,780
Uh, the other thing I want to do is I want
to make them kind of wanting to make a

37
00:02:23,781 --> 00:02:27,590
pardon of. So not
everybody could do it, uh,

38
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,450
because I want to do something that mind,

39
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,620
like industry competitors are not
doing. And I've, I've turned this,

40
00:02:34,790 --> 00:02:35,750
I've, I've, uh,

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,780
started a kind of a fad I bought 10 years
ago were more guys are doing this now

42
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:45,950
they're putting like shoots
up on inner webs, you know,

43
00:02:45,951 --> 00:02:50,810
with some physical activity
prior to or during a witch. Yeah.

44
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:55,250
Good. But, uh, and I'm
pretty sure I, uh, you know,

45
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,940
I, uh, I made it cool. Well, the more
people doing it, the better. Right?

46
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,670
The more competition, the
better. Yup. Yeah. It's,

47
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,820
it's just such a smart
thing to think of if you're,

48
00:03:06,821 --> 00:03:10,360
if you really want to train the way you
train and really want to think about,

49
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:14,510
you know, like tactical situations
and real world application. I mean,

50
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:18,200
such a great way to go about doing it.
And if it looks exciting and fun. I me,

51
00:03:18,201 --> 00:03:21,430
I haven't done it, but I'm
sure it's fun. It's good.

52
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:25,510
I talk a lot during my court now during
my courses. I don't do this stuff,

53
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,140
you know, I'm not cause I have,
I'll have 60 year old women in it.

54
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,590
I'll have guys with Parkinson's,
even man come to my course.

55
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,280
I have guys in real chairs.
Yeah, I have a guys. How do you,

56
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,850
how do you stabilize a guy when
they have Parkinson's? That's good.

57
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:43,450
That's what I showed this guy a trick.
What was his name?

58
00:03:43,451 --> 00:03:44,980
See if I could remember his name.
It doesn't matter,

59
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:48,700
but he was 77 years old
and uh, he said, well,

60
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:51,770
I could either come to your course
and train or lay on my couch and die.

61
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,620
I was like something, you know, it was
to that effect because he likes to shoot.

62
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,060
I cipro anytime,

63
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:03,160
but I have to modify the course to him
now because he can't even be prone to

64
00:04:03,161 --> 00:04:08,020
zero. So I would sit
him on um, on a cooler.

65
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,650
And then I used a, you know, furring
strips are, they hold up a target.

66
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:17,080
They're just two, one by twos, you
know, about five foot long. I had him,

67
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:22,230
Kris Cross those and hold them and then
V to v Notch and it put his rifle and

68
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:26,280
that Vena watch cause he
could sit up pretty good with,

69
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,730
he couldn't get into prone,

70
00:04:27,731 --> 00:04:32,410
you can't stand shoot
but sitting pretty good.

71
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,880
And you know when, uh,

72
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,050
when guys like that are concentrating
more, you see that shake go away too. Hey,

73
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,460
that's something we do at my gym too.

74
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:47,290
We train Parkinson's a tata box
Parkinson patients. Really? It's a,

75
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:51,850
it's a, it's a national program
called rock steady boxing. Huh?

76
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,080
They come in twice, three
times a week. Where's your gym?

77
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:59,620
North Carolina. What's it
called? So people could go there?

78
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,390
Spar tech spar a s p a r like smaller.
And then TC,

79
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:09,790
is it open to yeah, it's all,
yeah, it's open. Um, it, uh,

80
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,410
it's, it's very fight
centric. It's an MMA gym.

81
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,670
So everything we do is very
like fight centric with the,

82
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,260
with the physical work and
lifting and all of that.

83
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,130
Uh, and then we have, uh,
programs like there's, we've got,

84
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:30,640
we've got some really good fighters,
man, dude, coach there. I mean,

85
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:33,880
they're like legit.
Um,

86
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,240
so we got really good fighters,
uh,

87
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:41,290
who do a one on one coaching,
um,

88
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,310
everything from Greco to Bjj to,
uh,

89
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:50,260
tie bogs to kickboxing to
stand boxing. Uh, it's,

90
00:05:50,261 --> 00:05:54,310
it's an, it's a neat place. It's, it's
small. It's warehouse. It's very spartan,

91
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:58,400
you know, it's not sexy at all. Perfect.
Yeah, it's my favorite kind of jam.

92
00:05:58,401 --> 00:06:01,520
Freaking. It's Badass. And so what do
you do with these Parkinson's people?

93
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:06,080
So the rock steady boxing, uh,
folks, they have a program,

94
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:11,090
they come in a couple of times a week
and they put them through a series of

95
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,650
exercises. You know, a lot of
it's just walking a straight line,

96
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:19,100
uh, holding this in Wa,
you know, loading one side.

97
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,170
And then once they're all warmed
up, um, they all kit up, man,

98
00:06:24,171 --> 00:06:26,240
you see these guys are wrapping
and everything. You know,

99
00:06:26,290 --> 00:06:30,500
they're so excited to get there
and they put the wraps on and uh,

100
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:35,240
and then they have, they work
a series of a bag, drills,

101
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,480
you know, uh, one, two lateral
move to next bag is, uh,

102
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,240
hooks, you know, left and right hooks and
there's an upper cut bag and there's a,

103
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:47,710
you know, the double end bag. And
granted, they're not moving you,

104
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,740
they're not moving much,

105
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,210
but they're moving and they get
there and they love coming there. Uh,

106
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,600
and uh, some of them work up a
sweat. You know, it's, it's pretty,

107
00:06:56,601 --> 00:07:00,410
it's pretty amazing seeing them get
off their asses and get to the gym.

108
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:01,244
And I look,

109
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:05,660
I remember you put something out
and I pinged you like a year ago,

110
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,730
it was a on a podcast and you were,
uh,

111
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:14,570
you were getting pretty emotional
about somebody not loaning to a out.

112
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:16,250
And I pinged you and I said,

113
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:21,190
I think I've mentioned that we got fucking
Parkinson's people coming to my gym.

114
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,370
You know,
it's just when people make those excuses,

115
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,890
that just drives me crazy because I've
seen examples where I've been very

116
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:29,300
fortunate that I have good health,

117
00:07:29,630 --> 00:07:33,320
but I've seen many examples and I've
also been very fortunate that I never got

118
00:07:33,321 --> 00:07:35,300
out of shape.
I just kept working on my whole life.

119
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,800
But I've seen people that are fat as fuck,
350 pounds just barely can get,

120
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:43,910
get a w all round and then they decide
I'm going to take control my fucking

121
00:07:43,911 --> 00:07:46,670
health. And then they just
just do it. They just do it.

122
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,740
And even if you just got
to walk around the block,

123
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:52,850
he didn't for walk up flights of
stairs. Even if you just do up, push up,

124
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:57,080
even if you do us it up, just do
something man. Do some body weight squats,

125
00:07:57,081 --> 00:08:00,470
do something. It can be
done. Yup. It, you know,

126
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,560
the journey of a thousand miles
starts with that single step. And,

127
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:04,970
and I'll have guys

128
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:10,490
in my community who are saying, who will
say, yeah, man, I thought your stuff,

129
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:12,940
I'm sure out of shape and I
don't have the time to snatch,

130
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,890
which is another excuse. Those types
of things. I don't have the time.

131
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,350
Get up an hour early. Right. You
have all the time in the world.

132
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:20,980
You got an hour of workout.
I'll fuck you up in an hour.

133
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:23,180
You come work out with me for one hour.

134
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,360
I will have you crying
by the end of an hour.

135
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,310
That's plenty of time from warm up
to cool down one hour done. Yep.

136
00:08:31,530 --> 00:08:36,530
That's 100% yeah. If you're,
if you're a man and man,

137
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,540
this is my friend and my
own need more than that.
