00:00:00.201 --> 00:00:03.381
So, once again let's think of yourself as some type of

00:00:03.381 --> 00:00:07.885
ancient philosopher/mathematician, who is trying to extend

00:00:07.885 --> 00:00:12.317
mathematics as much as possible and try to make sure that you're not being lazy

00:00:12.317 --> 00:00:15.537
and leaving things undefined, when you might be able to define them.

00:00:15.537 --> 00:00:19.916
Whenever you start extending mathematics, especially in the realm of

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:23.700
multiplication and division, there are few things that you hold dear to.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.569
You feel that if you define some type of division operation,

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:31.083
that needs to be undone by multiplication; this is close to your heart.

00:00:31.083 --> 00:00:34.369
So you assume... You want to assume...

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:39.067
You would like to assume that any type of division operation, if you start

00:00:39.067 --> 00:00:42.672
with some number and if you divide with a number

00:00:42.672 --> 00:00:45.851
over which... - division by that number is defined - so when

00:00:45.851 --> 00:00:47.903
I divide by some number and then multiply

00:00:47.903 --> 00:00:51.896
by that same number that this should get me this original number

00:00:51.896 --> 00:00:55.189
right over here, this should give me x right over here.

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:59.315
And this happens when we just multiply and divide with regular numbers.

00:00:59.315 --> 00:01:04.619
If I get 3 divided by 2 times 2, that's gonna get me 3. If I say

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.271
10 divided by 5 times 5,

00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:13.439
that's going to get me 10. The other things that I want to assume...

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.364
- and this is very close to my heart - I feel that any type of definitions I make

00:01:17.364 --> 00:01:35.067
have to be constant with the idea x*0 has to be 0 or any x.

00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:37.368
So these are close to my heart. I wanna extend

00:01:37.368 --> 00:01:41.299
mathematics. These two things are things that cannot be contradicted,

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:42.719
cannot be untrue.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:47.980
Now, that out of the way. You wanna start exploring the divide-by-0 question.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.353
So the first thing that you say: "Well, let me just try to define it." So let's

00:01:52.353 --> 00:01:53.850
start, let's assume

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.586
that I have, so this is... So let's make a further assumption...

00:01:57.586 --> 00:02:02.283
that x is some non-zero number.

00:02:02.283 --> 00:02:05.465
Let's just say, well,maybe the best way of finding out what

00:02:05.465 --> 00:02:09.303
x divided by 0 should be, how I should divide it, let's just assume

00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:12.140
there is define, and then come up with any results

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.741
that there might be, there might be a resolve for.

00:02:14.741 --> 00:02:17.639
So let's say that x divided by 0

00:02:25.673 --> 00:02:29.351
is equal to k.

00:02:29.351 --> 00:02:31.278
Well, if this is true and if we are defining what it means

00:02:31.278 --> 00:02:37.656
to divide by zero, then we are assuming that if we multiply by zero,

00:02:37.656 --> 00:02:41.846
we'll get our original number right over here. This is something that we are not willing to

00:02:41.846 --> 00:02:46.880
contradict. So let's see what happens: x divided by 0 is equal to k.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.764
On the left hand side we have a divide by zero

00:02:49.764 --> 00:02:53.279
and than multiplied by zero. Well then if two things are equal,

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:57.197
if I do something to one thing inorder for them to stay equal, I have to do it

00:02:57.197 --> 00:02:59.949
to the other thing. This has to be equal to that.

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:03.096
I have to multiply the left hand AND the right hand side by zero.

00:03:03.096 --> 00:03:07.575
Well, then by this assumption that I am never willing to give up, this left hand side

00:03:07.575 --> 00:03:13.713
right over here, must be equal to x.

00:03:13.713 --> 00:03:17.163
And by this assumption right over here, that I am not willing to give up,

00:03:17.163 --> 00:03:19.733
This right hand side right over here

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:25.285
must be equal to 0.

00:03:25.285 --> 00:03:27.697
But I just hit a contradiction!

00:03:27.697 --> 00:03:31.513
I assume that x does not equal to 0, and now I am being forced to say

00:03:31.513 --> 00:03:36.798
that x=0. And I am not willing to give up the idea,

00:03:36.798 --> 00:03:39.551
I am not willing to give up either of these ideas. I am defining

00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:43.630
what it means to divide by zero. Or if I am defining what it means to divide by anything...

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:47.101
...that if I then multiply by that something, that I should get my original number.

00:03:47.101 --> 00:03:50.500
And I am not willing to give up the idea that anything times 0 is 0.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.578
So all of these things... The only thing that I can give up

00:03:55.578 --> 00:03:59.396
is this right over here. And I'll say, well, I guess k will have to

00:03:59.396 --> 00:04:02.763
stay undefined.

00:04:02.763 --> 00:04:09.121
This whole contradiction happened because I attempted to define what x/0 is.

00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:10.771
Now that out of the way... OK...

00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:15.058
This was a situation when x does not equal zero. But what about

00:04:15.058 --> 00:04:20.548
when x DOES equal zero. So let's think about that a little bit.

00:04:20.548 --> 00:04:23.008
And once again, I will try to

00:04:23.008 --> 00:04:27.266
define it. So I will assume...

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:32.280
that 0 divided by 0 is equal to some number.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:39.148
Well once again, so let's say it is equal to k again. And so, once again...

00:04:39.148 --> 00:04:43.213
we are trying to do the same logic, so we'll write 0/0

00:04:43.213 --> 00:04:46.141
is equal to k. Actually, let me colourcode these zeros.

00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:50.193
This will be a magenta zero and this is a blue zero

00:04:50.193 --> 00:04:54.090
right over here. And once again, I am not willing to give up the idea that

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.915
if I start with a number x, I divide it by something over which division is

00:04:57.915 --> 00:05:02.280
defined, and then I multiply by that something, I should get my original x again.

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.751
I can't give this up. Otherwise it doesn't seem like a good definition

00:05:05.751 --> 00:05:10.024
for the division. So what I am gonna do - I am gonna multiply the left-hand side

00:05:10.024 --> 00:05:13.996
times 0 and by this property that I am

00:05:13.996 --> 00:05:18.299
not willing to give up, the left-hand side should simplify to this magenta

00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:21.650
zero. It should simplify to this over here. But once again,

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.629
anything I do to once side of the equation, inorder for the equation to hold

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:29.042
true, I need to the other side of the equation. And these two were equal beforehand.

00:05:29.042 --> 00:05:33.064
Any operation I do to this inorder for it to still be equal , I need to do to that.

00:05:33.064 --> 00:05:38.664
So let me multiply the right-hand side by zero.

00:05:38.664 --> 00:05:40.142
So the left I get

00:05:40.142 --> 00:05:44.396
0, I just get this magenta 0, and on the right

00:05:44.396 --> 00:05:48.267
I could just write the zero here, but I won't simplify

00:05:48.267 --> 00:05:54.037
it. I get k times 0.

00:05:54.037 --> 00:05:55.792
Well, this I see right over here...

00:05:55.792 --> 00:06:00.200
This actually is not a contradiction. This actually is true for any k,

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.906
This is one of the core assumptions that I've made in my mathematics

00:06:03.906 --> 00:06:09.765
that I am not willing to give up. So this is true

00:06:09.765 --> 00:06:18.762
True for any k. It's not a contradiction. But the problem here is I wanna come up with

00:06:18.762 --> 00:06:22.693
the k, I'd like a resolve for a k. It would not be nice if this turned out to be 0.

00:06:22.693 --> 00:06:25.338
if this turned out to be one, or if this turned out to be negative one

00:06:25.348 --> 00:06:28.071
But now I see, given the assumptions right here

00:06:28.077 --> 00:06:33.031
this could be ANY... this could be absolutely any k

00:06:33.054 --> 00:06:36.500
I cannot determine what k this should be

00:06:36.515 --> 00:06:40.932
This could be a hundred thousand, this could be 75, it could be anything

00:06:40.932 --> 00:06:42.633
true for any k

00:06:42.633 --> 00:06:48.993
I cannot determine

00:06:49.016 --> 00:06:51.236
what k this should be

00:06:51.236 --> 00:06:54.229
and that's why when you get a little bit more nuance in early math

00:06:54.229 --> 00:06:57.402
people will say, well 0 divided by 0, well we don't know what that's gonna be

00:06:57.402 --> 00:06:59.515
there's no consistent answer there

00:06:59.515 --> 00:07:01.496
so we're just going to call it undefined

00:07:01.496 --> 00:07:04.585
there's no good answer that seems better than any other answer

00:07:04.585 --> 00:07:07.255
but now we see a little bit nuance here

00:07:07.255 --> 00:07:09.667
one divided by zero... you just couldn't define it

00:07:09.667 --> 00:07:11.470
it led to direct contradictions

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:14.800
zero divided by zero... it could be anything

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:16.214
you can't determine it

00:07:16.214 --> 00:07:18.934
and so that's why, when you do higher level math

00:07:18.934 --> 00:07:21.677
and you'll often hear this when you take a calculus course

00:07:21.677 --> 00:07:31.567
we see that zero divided by zero is indeterminate
