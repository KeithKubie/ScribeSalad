00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:03.072
In this exercise, we're going to try to make the petals look better. Starting

00:00:03.072 --> 00:00:06.528
with your solution to the previous problem, make two small changes that will

00:00:06.528 --> 00:00:10.032
make the petals look more realistic. The first is to squish the petals, make

00:00:10.032 --> 00:00:14.058
them one quarter as tall as they were before. The second is to tilt the petals

00:00:14.058 --> 00:00:17.178
up by 20 degrees. When you're done you should get something like this, which

00:00:17.178 --> 00:00:20.638
looks at least a little bit more like a flower. Notice that all of the points of

00:00:20.638 --> 00:00:24.030
the petals should still be at the center of the stamen, the sphere at the top of

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.122
the stem. When I first solved this problem, my petals were pointing below the

00:00:27.122 --> 00:00:30.185
stamen, which isn't what I wanted. I expect that you can do better than I first

00:00:30.185 --> 00:00:30.389
did.
