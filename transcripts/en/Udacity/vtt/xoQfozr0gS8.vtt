00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.990
So from the introduction that I gave you

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.110
about Quicksilver you can see that it has identified

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.061
many problems that you and I face with

00:00:08.061 --> 00:00:12.050
our everyday computing. With orphaned windows and, and memory

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:17.320
leaks and so on. So the question to you is, name the company and the year that

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.840
Quicksilver was built. And the choices I'm giving

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.540
you in terms of companies include IBM, Sun, HP,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.610
Apple, Microsoft, and Google. And the choice of years I'm giving

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:34.870
you is, the early part of 80s, early part of 90s,

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.110
early part of 2000s, or 2013. So pick your choice for

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.160
the company and the year in which Quicksilver system was built.
