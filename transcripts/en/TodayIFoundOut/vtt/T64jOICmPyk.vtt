00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.230
Motor vehicle directional signals have been
around almost as long as cars, and as early

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.820
as 1909, a device was patented that had hand-shaped
lights that indicated to other drivers which

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.289
way a vehicle intended to travel.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:24.820
Obviously, that one didn’t catch on.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.779
Neither did the mechanical signaling device
invented by silent-film star Florence Lawrence

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.280
in 1914, which, after a button was pushed
by the driver, a sign would pop up from the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.840
rear bumper indicating which way the car was
turning.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.570
The first modern directional signal was patented
in 1925 by Edgar A. Walz, Jr., although no

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.230
one was interested in it either, at least
until after his patent expired 14 years later.

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.820
That’s when, in 1939, the U.S. automaker
Buick first introduced the “Flash–Way

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.400
Directional Signal,” which operated in the
familiar way – a stick, mounted on the steering

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.400
column.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:06.970
In its original incarnation, this turn signal
only flashed the rear lights; by the next

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.189
year, front lights were flashing as well.

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:14.250
By the end of WWII, directional signals were
standard in most American automobiles.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.820
While there are several different designs
out there for turn signal switches, they classically

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.000
used some form of a thermal switch (in this
case called a thermal flasher).

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.320
The core of this switch includes a resistor
that heats up when current flows through it.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:33.640
This is attached to a bimetallic spring- essentially
an arched strip made up of two sandwiched

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:38.479
metals with very different thermal properties,
one that expands quite a bit as it warms and

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.850
the other that doesn’t.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.020
The result is that when current is flowing
(when you turn on the blinker), the resistor

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.080
heats up the arched bimetallic spring which
in turn is connecting the two terminals, allowing

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.470
the lights to come on.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.960
As it heats up, one of the metals begins to
try to straighten itself out as it expands,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.159
but initially can’t because the other metal
is holding it in its arched form.

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.110
Eventually, the heat builds enough where the
metal trying to straighten itself out wins

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.990
the battle and the bimetallic spring straightens,
disconnecting the two terminals.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.159
At this point, no electricity is flowing and
the lights are off.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:15.500
Because no power is flowing, the resistor
and the bimetallic spring rapidly cool to

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.840
the point where the other metal pressing to
reform itself into the arched shape wins,

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.680
and there is another snap as it once again
bends back into shape and re-connects the

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:27.700
terminals, starting the process over again.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:32.441
So in these thermal flashers, the clicking
noise you hear is just this bimetallic spring

00:02:32.441 --> 00:02:37.840
snapping back and forth from its arched form
to a straightened form and back again.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.420
One tell-tale sign that you have a thermal
flasher in your car is that when a light goes

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.670
out, the flash rate of your blinkers will
slow down- less electricity = more time needed

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.840
for sufficient heat to build to snap the spring.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.790
In the extreme, where too little current is
flowing (like if you try to swap out your

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.890
incandescent bulbs for LEDs), your blinker
will simply not blink, staying on.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.710
On the other end of the spectrum, if you hook
up a trailer or something with more lights,

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:08.240
it will speed up the blinking rate and in
the extreme perhaps even damage your thermal

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.240
flasher.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.050
Another common device used to create the blink
in your blinkers is an electronic flasher.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.230
Instead of using heat and a bimetallic spring,
this device simply uses some electronic circuit

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:20.819
to control a relay.

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.340
Inside a mechanical relay, applied electricity
to an electromagnet creates a magnetic field

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.400
that switches a metallic armature, which in
turn makes an audible clicking noise.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.400
When the electricity is no longer applied
to the electromagnet in the relay, a spring

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:41.050
moves the armature back the other way, either
connecting the circuit or disconnecting depending

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.410
on the type of relay (whether it’s designed
to be switched on or off by default).

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.050
This type of system has the advantage of not
inherently changing the blink rate based on

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.489
the electrical draw of the lights.

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.930
So switching to LED lights or hooking up trailer
lights won’t necessarily affect anything,

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.910
though this does vary somewhat depending on
the design of the circuit, particularly in

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.290
how the system is designed to detect and respond
to a burnt out light bulb.

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:12.700
But, in general, as long as you’re not drawing
more power than the wires, fuse, etc. can

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.039
handle, the system should blink at a constant
rate, with the relay clicking away as it switches

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:20.009
the lights on and off.

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:25.030
There is also another type of electronic flasher
that is a solid state flasher, meaning it

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.680
has no moving parts (making it incredibly
long lasting and reliable), perhaps using

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.350
a solid state relay.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.590
This type of system does not inherently click
unless the designer specifically chose to

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:40.190
add something to do so, possibly added as
an extra indicator to the driver that the

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.190
blinker is on.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:54.720
In most cases, though, there will be no click
with a solid state flasher.
