00:00:00.191 --> 00:00:01.702
- [Voiceover] What I want
to explore in this video

00:00:01.702 --> 00:00:04.925
is the notion of a "rate."

00:00:04.925 --> 00:00:07.180
So, let's look at some examples of rates

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.018
that you've probably encountered
in your everyday life.

00:00:10.018 --> 00:00:11.893
So, if you're driving in
your car down the road,

00:00:11.893 --> 00:00:13.251
and you're looking at the speedometer,

00:00:13.251 --> 00:00:15.311
you might see that it
says that you are going

00:00:15.311 --> 00:00:18.452
35 M-P-H,

00:00:18.452 --> 00:00:20.020
where the M-P-H stands for

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.085
35 miles

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.859
per, per hour.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.587
Well, what's that saying?

00:00:26.587 --> 00:00:28.653
That's saying, well,
every hour, how many miles

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:32.542
are you going if you were to
stay at that current rate.

00:00:32.542 --> 00:00:34.613
So, it could be a measure of speed.

00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:38.590
How much distance are you
covering per unit time?

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.654
And, most typically, when
people talk about rates,

00:00:40.654 --> 00:00:41.622
that's what they're talking about.

00:00:41.622 --> 00:00:43.421
They're talking about
how much of something

00:00:43.421 --> 00:00:46.338
that is happening per unit time.

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:48.933
And, it doesn't have to be
even distance per unit time,

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:51.842
you might have a, you
might have your hourly rate

00:00:51.842 --> 00:00:54.366
for someone who is doing
some type of a job.

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.153
They might say that they're making,

00:00:56.153 --> 00:00:59.613
they're making $10, so they're making $10.

00:00:59.613 --> 00:01:01.251
And, actually, let me
write the dollars out

00:01:01.251 --> 00:01:04.281
so the units become a
little bit more obvious,

00:01:04.281 --> 00:01:08.304
10 dollars, dollars per hour,

00:01:08.983 --> 00:01:11.814
dollars per,

00:01:11.814 --> 00:01:13.673
dollars per hour.

00:01:13.673 --> 00:01:15.545
And so, once again,
this is how much money.

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:16.890
It's not talking about distance anymore.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.603
How much money is being
earned per unit time?

00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.089
And, so, even though rates
are often associated with

00:01:23.089 --> 00:01:25.639
how much something is
happening per some unit time,

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:27.415
and it could be miles per hour,

00:01:27.415 --> 00:01:29.325
or it could be meters per second,

00:01:29.325 --> 00:01:30.977
or, in this case, it could be a wage,

00:01:30.977 --> 00:01:32.552
it could be dollars per hour.

00:01:32.552 --> 00:01:35.592
Rates don't have to be
just in those terms.

00:01:35.592 --> 00:01:38.072
In fact, you might say, "All right,

00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:40.713
"I have a dessert that I really enjoy,

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:42.103
"but I'm very conscientious

00:01:42.103 --> 00:01:45.571
"about, about the number of
calories that I consume."

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:48.985
And, you might, you
might see something like,

00:01:48.985 --> 00:01:53.155
there are 200 calories,

00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:57.083
calories per serving,

00:01:57.083 --> 00:01:58.633
per serving.

00:01:58.633 --> 00:02:01.051
And, so, this is telling
us the number of calories

00:02:01.051 --> 00:02:02.069
per a serving.

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:03.246
And they'll tell us what a serving is.

00:02:03.246 --> 00:02:06.226
A serving might be a cup or
eight ounces or whatever else.

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.899
And, so, I could say, "Okay,
look, if I have two servings,

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.455
"then I'm gonna have 400 calories.

00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:12.902
"Same way, if I work two hours,
I'm gonna have 20 dollars.

00:02:12.902 --> 00:02:15.544
"If I, or if I go two hours,

00:02:15.544 --> 00:02:17.453
"I'm gonna go 70 miles."

00:02:17.453 --> 00:02:19.051
So, rates give you a sense.

00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.082
It's like, how fast is
something happening?

00:02:21.082 --> 00:02:23.995
Or how much of one thing is happening

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:26.955
for every time something else happens?

00:02:26.955 --> 00:02:28.604
Now, I can write rates

00:02:28.604 --> 00:02:31.692
so they look an awful lot like a ratio.

00:02:31.692 --> 00:02:34.043
And, these words are,
actually, very related,

00:02:34.043 --> 00:02:35.583
'cause you see that even
how they're written.

00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:37.550
R-A-T, R-A-T.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:40.459
Their roots are coming
from the exact same idea.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.034
In fact, this rate over
here, 35 miles per hour,

00:02:44.034 --> 00:02:45.717
it could come from,

00:02:45.717 --> 00:02:49.448
"Hey, I just, I just went
35 miles in one hour,

00:02:49.448 --> 00:02:51.133
"what's the ratio?"

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:53.577
So, the ratio

00:02:53.577 --> 00:02:56.385
of miles

00:02:56.385 --> 00:02:58.355
to hours.

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:01.844
And, then, you could
say, "Well, I went 35,

00:03:01.844 --> 00:03:03.958
"the ratio miles to hours

00:03:03.958 --> 00:03:06.297
"was 35 to one."

00:03:06.297 --> 00:03:07.657
Or it could have been, maybe it was

00:03:07.657 --> 00:03:10.257
70 to two or something like that.

00:03:10.257 --> 00:03:11.840
But, that could have been reduced to

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.357
35 to one.

00:03:13.357 --> 00:03:14.019
So, as a ratio,

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.990
you would typically see
it written like this...

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:19.624
Or maybe see it written like,
see it written like this...

00:03:19.624 --> 00:03:21.930
And, sometimes, you might
even see it written like

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.876
this, 35 miles

00:03:25.881 --> 00:03:28.751
to one hour.

00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:30.333
But, now it's starting
to resemble more of the

00:03:30.333 --> 00:03:32.928
special case of a ratio,
which we call a "rate."

00:03:32.928 --> 00:03:35.482
Because, this is the same thing as 35.

00:03:35.482 --> 00:03:37.598
Instead of writing it
out "miles per hour,"

00:03:37.598 --> 00:03:39.800
you'll often see it written like this,

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:44.338
miles per, miles per hour.

00:03:44.338 --> 00:03:46.794
So, these are very, very related ideas.

00:03:46.794 --> 00:03:50.007
If you find the ratio between
calories and servings,

00:03:50.007 --> 00:03:51.752
well, then, you're going
to be able to write,

00:03:51.752 --> 00:03:54.151
you're going to be able
to express it as a rate

00:03:54.151 --> 00:03:55.521
and vice versa.

00:03:55.521 --> 00:03:57.907
Now, why do we care about rates?

00:03:57.907 --> 00:04:00.730
Well, especially if we're
thinking about things like speed,

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.913
without rates, it would
be hard to quantify

00:04:03.913 --> 00:04:05.360
how fast things are happening.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.626
Otherwise, we'd be in a
world where we're saying,

00:04:06.626 --> 00:04:07.926
"Hey, I'm faster than you," or

00:04:07.926 --> 00:04:09.818
"She's faster than me."

00:04:09.818 --> 00:04:11.084
But we wouldn't be able to quantify

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:12.846
exactly how fast they are.

00:04:12.846 --> 00:04:15.702
But with rates, we can
say, "Hey, that person ran

00:04:15.702 --> 00:04:17.760
"a hundred meters in 10 seconds,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.745
"they run 10 meters per second."

00:04:19.745 --> 00:04:24.322
We can quantify exactly how
fast that thing is happening,

00:04:24.322 --> 00:04:26.357
the rate at which it is happening.

00:04:26.357 --> 00:04:28.987
Here, instead of saying,
"Hey, a cup of that

00:04:28.987 --> 00:04:33.567
"is gonna give you, is
gonna give you more energy,

00:04:33.567 --> 00:04:35.046
or, maybe, contribute more to your weight

00:04:35.046 --> 00:04:38.220
than a cup of that, and making
these relative comparisons,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:41.784
here, you can actually, you
can actually quantify things.

00:04:41.784 --> 00:04:42.799
And when we study rate,

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:44.652
we're gonna study rate
a lot in mathematics.

00:04:44.652 --> 00:04:46.694
It's gonna be essential in algebra

00:04:46.694 --> 00:04:48.956
when we look at the rate of change

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:52.271
of a line, how far it moves
in the vertical direction

00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:54.391
relative to the horizontal direction.

00:04:54.391 --> 00:04:56.318
We're gonna call that "slope".

00:04:56.318 --> 00:04:58.747
And you can even imagine
the slope of a hill as

00:04:58.747 --> 00:05:02.294
how fast is it climbing for
as much as you move forward.

00:05:02.294 --> 00:05:04.190
But we're also gonna study rates in detail

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.351
when we go to calculus.

00:05:05.351 --> 00:05:08.251
In fact, the whole basis
of differential calculus,

00:05:08.251 --> 00:05:10.762
that you might see later in
high school and early college,

00:05:10.762 --> 00:05:13.530
is all about measuring instantaneous rate.

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:16.752
How fast is something going right now?

00:05:16.752 --> 00:05:18.643
So, rates are really, really interesting,

00:05:18.643 --> 00:05:19.794
really, really important.

00:05:19.794 --> 00:05:21.467
And, I would guess that,

00:05:21.467 --> 00:05:22.847
if you just look around your life,

00:05:22.847 --> 00:05:24.287
even over the next few hours,

00:05:24.287 --> 00:05:25.494
you're going to encounter

00:05:25.494 --> 00:05:28.222
many, many, many rates.
