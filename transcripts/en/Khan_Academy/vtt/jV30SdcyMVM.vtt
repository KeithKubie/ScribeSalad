00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.690
- My name is Sam DiVine.

00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:04.960
I'm 27 years old and I am a salon owner.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.990
My story of becoming a
hairstylist is pretty interesting.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.420
I had been cutting hair
all throughout high school

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.040
on all of my friends and playing

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:14.430
and just having a good time.

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.760
And I never actually thought
about it as a career path

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.970
because it was never brought up to me

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.780
that it could be a career path.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.810
And I'm reading this
article and I was just like,

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.910
you've gotta be kidding me.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.040
Somebody is charging $800 for a haircut?

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.410
That's crazy.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.500
And she's doing every celebrity
and it was incredible.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.890
So I went home and I
did a lot of research,

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.930
and I found out that
she was not the only one

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.810
and that, you know, that she
wasn't like a fluke situation.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:39.300
And I decided right then and there,

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.830
I was like, that's what I want to do.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.460
Like, that's definitely what I want to do.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.960
So I'm at my salon in this
small town in New Jersey

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.840
and I'm talking with my stylist,

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.267
and I was like, "hey, like,
this is what I want to do.

00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:51.870
"I have no idea where to begin."

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.707
And she was like, "You have
to go to Vidal Sassoon,

00:00:53.707 --> 00:00:54.770
"hands-down."

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:55.840
When you become a hair stylist

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.810
you have a couple different options.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.380
You can open your own salon,

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.650
which some people choose to do.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.210
You can go and work, depending
on what state you work in,

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.690
because every state has different laws,

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:07.450
but a lot of states allow booth renting,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.010
which means that you will
come into a salon location.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.830
They'll have stations set up
and you pay rent, essentially,

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.810
a monthly rent for a station.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.980
Or you can work in a salon
that's commission-based,

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.690
which means you're part of a team.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:21.920
You're part of a culture.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.180
You're part of the entire business.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.830
When you're just starting
out in the industry,

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.230
you're gonna have to, essentially,

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.260
like, earn your way for a little while.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:30.310
You're gonna have to prove yourself.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:31.940
If you would've asked me a month before

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.460
I decided that this was
what I was going to do,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.500
I would have told you you were crazy.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.780
I would never open a salon.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.100
I knew absolutely nothing
about running a business

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.570
or how to start a business

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.150
or anything related to business

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.540
other than showing up at work,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.840
doing my clients, and, you
know, collecting a paycheck.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.910
So for me, it was a lot of new learning.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.010
But luckily, I do love to read

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:56.750
and I love to learn new things.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.020
So Google was my best friend.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.013
I Googled absolutely everything endlessly.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:05.230
Absorbed anything I could read

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.610
about opening a new business,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.850
whether it was a hair salon or not,

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.940
just figuring out, you
know, what that entailed.

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.550
My responsibilities on any given day

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.150
is gonna be getting to the salon,

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.720
making sure that everything
is ready to run smoothly,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.640
so making sure that the
schedule is correct,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.070
making sure that we're fully staffed,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.690
taking care of the bills,

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.010
making sure that, you know, payroll is run

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.630
and payroll is processed,

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.003
working on my own clients for
a good portion of the day.
