00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.920
Hi, I’m John Green; this is Crash Course
World History and today we’re going to talk

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.910
about decolonization. The empires European
states formed in the 19th century proved about

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.670
as stable and long-lasting as Genghis Khan’s
leading to so many of the nation states we

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.780
know and love today. Yes, I’m looking at
you, Burundi.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.980
[singing] DID YOU EVER KNOW YOU’RE MY BURUNDI?
YOU’RE EVERYTHING

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.280
[theme music]

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:24.880
STAN, DON’T CUT TO THE INTRO! I SING LIKE
AN ANGEL!

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:33.600
[theme music]

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.120
So unless you’re over 60-- and let’s face
it, Internet, you’re not-- you’ve only

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.240
ever known a world of nation states. But as
we’ve seen from Egypt to Alexander the Great

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:48.000
to China to Rome to the Mongols, who, for
once, are not the exception here, [Mongoltage]

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.040
to the Ottomans and the Americas, empire has long
been the dominant way we’ve organized ourselves

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.060
politically -- or at least the way that
other people have organized us.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.870
Mr. Green, Mr. Green! So to them
Star Wars would’ve been, like, a completely

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.900
different movie. Most of them would’ve been
like, Go Empire! Crush those rebels!

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:07.000
Yeah, also they’d be like what is this screen
that displays crisp moving images of events

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.080
that are not currently occurring? Also, not
to get off-topic, but you never learn what

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.820
happens AFTER the rebel victory in Star Wars.
And, as as we’ve learned from the French

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.100
Revolution to the Arab Spring, revolution
is often the easy part. I mean, you think

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.420
destroying a Death Star is hard? Try negotiating
a trade treaty with Gungans. Right, anyway.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.190
So, the late 20th century was not the first
time that empires disintegrated. Rome comes

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:29.490
to mind. Also the Persians. And of course
the American Revolution ended one kind of

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.620
European imperial experiment. But in all those
cases, Empire struck back… heh heh, you

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.620
see what I did there? I mean, Britain lost
its 13 colonies, but later controlled half

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.920
of Africa and all of India. And what makes
the recent decolonization so special is that

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.780
at least so far, no empires have emerged to
replace the ones that fell.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.710
And this was largely due to World War II because
on some level, the Allies were fighting to

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.000
stop Nazi imperialism. Hitler wanted to take
over Central Europe, and Africa, and probably

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.340
the Middle East-- and the Ally defeat of the
Nazis discredited the whole idea of empire.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.890
So the English, French, and Americans couldn’t
very well say to the colonial troops who’d

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.789
fought alongside them, “Thank you so much
for helping us to thwart Germany’s imperialistic

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.810
ambitions. As a reward, please hand in your
rifle and return to your state of subjugation.”

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.730
Plus, most of the big colonial powers-- especially
France, Britain, and Japan-- had been significantly

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.689
weakened by World War II, by which I mean
that large swaths of them looked like this.

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.969
So, post-war decolonization happened all over
the place: The British colony that had once

00:02:27.969 --> 00:02:32.349
been “India” became three independent
nations. By the way, is this Gandhi or is

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.450
this Ben Kingsley playing Gandhi? In Southeast
Asia, French Indochina became Cambodia, Laos,

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.709
and Vietnam. And the Dutch East Indies became
Indonesia. But of course when we think about

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.260
decolonization, we mostly think about Africa
going from this to this.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.859
So we’re gonna oversimplify here, because
we have to, but decolonization throughout

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:53.799
Afro-Eurasia had some similar characteristics.
Because it occurred in the context of the

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.159
Cold War, many of these new nations had to
choose between socialist and capitalist influences,

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.040
which shaped their futures. While many of
these new countries eventually adopted some

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.090
form of democracy, the road there was often
rocky. Also, decolonization often involved

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.059
violence, usually the overthrow of colonial
elites.

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:14.169
But we’ll turn now to the most famous nonviolent--
or supposedly so, anyway-- decolonization:

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.599
that of India. So the story begins, more or
less, in 1885 with the founding of the Indian

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:22.400
National Congress. Congress Party leaders
and other nationalists in India were usually

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:26.549
from the elite classes. Initially, they didn’t
even demand independence from Britain. But

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.419
they were interested in creating a modern
Indian nation rather than a return to some

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:36.599
ancient pre-colonial form, possibly because
India was-- and is--hugely diverse and really

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:41.529
only unified into a single state when under
imperial rule by one group or another, whether

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:46.060
the Mauryans, the Guptas, the Mughals, or
the British. Okay, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:50.319
The best known Indian nationalist, Mohandas
K. Gandhi, was a fascinating character. A

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.849
British educated lawyer born to a wealthy
family, he’s known for making his own clothes,

00:03:54.849 --> 00:04:00.079
his long fasts, and his battles to alleviate
poverty, improve the rights of women, and

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.799
achieve a unified Indian independence from
Britain. In terms of decolonization, he stands

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.049
out for his use of nonviolence and his linking
it to a somewhat mythologized view of Indian

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.150
history. I mean, after all, there’s plenty
of violence in India’s past and in its heroic

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.390
epics, but Gandhi managed to hearken back
to a past that used nonviolence to bring change.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.420
Gandhi and his compatriot Jawaharlal Nehru
believed that a single India could continue

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.949
to be ruled by Indian elites and somehow transcend
the tension between the country’s Hindu

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.960
majority and its sizable Muslim minority.

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:34.430
In this they were less practical than their
contemporary, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the leader

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.870
of the Muslim League who felt-- to quote historian
Ainslie Embree-- "that the unified India of

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.800
which the Congress spoke was an artificial
one, created and maintained by British bayonets.”

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.380
Jinnah proved correct and in 1947 when the
British left, their Indian colony was partitioned into

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:55.380
the modern state of India and West and East Pakistan,
the latter of which became Bangladesh in 1971.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.259
While it’s easy to congratulate both the
British and the Indian governments on an orderly

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:05.579
and nonviolent transfer of power, the reality
of partition was neither orderly nor nonviolent.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.220
About 12 million people were displaced as
Hindus in Pakistan moved to India and Muslims

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.419
in India moved to Pakistan. As people left
their homes, sometimes unwillingly, there

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:19.139
was violence, and all tolled as many as half
a million people were killed, more than died

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:24.110
in the bloody Indonesian battle for independence.
So while it’s true that the massive protests

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:28.669
that forced Britain to end its colonization
of India were nonviolent, the emergence of

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:32.560
the independent states involved really wasn’t.
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.629
All this violence devastated Gandhi, whose
lengthy and repeated hunger strikes to end

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:41.099
violence had mixed results, and who was eventually
assassinated by a Hindu nationalist who felt

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:44.819
that Gandhi was too sympathetic to Muslims.
Oh, it’s time for the open letter?

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.140
An Open Letter to hunger strikers.

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.040
But first, let’s see what’s in the secret
compartment today.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.060
A cupcake? Stan, this just seems cruel. These
are from Meredith the Intern to celebrate

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:01.620
Merebration, the holiday she invented to celebrate
the anniversary of her singleness.

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.120
Dear hunger strikers, Do you remember earlier
when I said that Gandhi hearkened back to

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:14.040
a mythologized Indian past? Well it turns
out that hunger striking in India goes back

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.150
all the way to, like, the 5th century BCE.
Hunger strikes have been used around the world

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.169
including British and American suffragettes,
who hunger struck to get the vote. And in

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:25.879
pre-Christian Ireland, when you felt wronged
by someone, it was common practice to sit

00:06:25.879 --> 00:06:29.759
on their doorstep and hunger strike until
your grievance was addressed. And sometimes

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:34.129
it even works. I really admire you, hunger
strikers. But I lack the courage of your convictions.

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:40.500
Also, this is an amazing cupcake.
Best wishes, John Green

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.940
Since independence, India has largely been
a success story, although we will talk about

00:06:43.949 --> 00:06:47.439
the complexity of India’s emerging global
capitalism next week.

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:52.509
For now, though, let’s travel east to Indonesia,
a huge nation of over 13,000 islands that

00:06:52.509 --> 00:06:56.669
has largely been ignored here on Crash Course
World History due to our long-standing bias

00:06:56.669 --> 00:07:01.309
against islands. Like, we haven’t even mentioned
Greenland on this show. The Greenlanders,

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:04.389
of course, haven’t complained because they
don’t have the Internet.

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:07.729
So, the Dutch exploited their island colonies
with the system of cultuurstelsel, in which

00:07:07.729 --> 00:07:12.419
all peasants had to set aside one fifth of
their land to grow cash crops for export to

00:07:12.419 --> 00:07:17.479
the Netherlands. This accounted for 25% of
the total Dutch national budget and it explains

00:07:17.479 --> 00:07:21.249
why they have all kinds of fancy buildings
despite technically living underwater. They’re

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:25.610
like sea monkeys. This system was rather less
popular in Indonesia, and the Dutch didn’t

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.979
offer much in exchange. They couldn’t even
defend their colony from the Japanese, who

00:07:28.979 --> 00:07:32.990
occupied it for most of World War II, during
which time the Japanese furthered the cause

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:37.230
of Indonesian nationalism by placing native
Indonesians in more prominent positions of

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.810
power, including Sukarno, who became Indonesia’s
first prime minister.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:44.120
After the war, the Dutch-- with British help--
tried to hold onto their Indonesian colonies

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:48.400
with so-called “police actions,” which
went on for more than four years before Indonesia

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.819
finally won its independence in 1950. Over
in the French colonies of Indochina, so called

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:56.819
because they were neither Indian nor Chinese,
things were even more violent. The end of

00:07:56.819 --> 00:08:01.909
colonization was disastrous in Cambodia, where
the 17-year reign of Norodom Sihanouk gave

00:08:01.909 --> 00:08:07.909
way to the rise of the Khmer Rouge, which
massacred a stunning 21% of Cambodia’s population

00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:10.620
between 1975 and 1979.

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.840
In Vietnam, the French fought communist-led
nationalists, especially Ho Chi Minh from

00:08:14.849 --> 00:08:19.550
almost the moment World War II ended until
1954, when the French were defeated. And then

00:08:19.550 --> 00:08:23.009
the Americans learned that there was a land
war available in Asia, so they quickly took

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:27.599
over from the French and communists did not
fully control Vietnam until 1975. Despite

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:31.300
still being ostensibly communist, Vietnam
now manufactures all kinds of stuff that we

00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.380
like in America, especially sneakers.

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:36.980
More about that next week, too, but now to
Egypt. You’ll remember that Egypt bankrupted

00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:41.320
itself in the 19th century, trying to industrialize
and ever since had been ruled by an Egyptian

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:45.210
king who took his orders from the British.
So while technically Egypt had been independent

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:50.560
since 1922, it was very dependent independence.
But, that changed in the 1950s, when the king

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.510
was overthrown by the army. The army commander
who led that coup was Gamal Abdul Nasser,

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:58.820
who proved brilliant at playing the US and
the USSR off each other to the benefit of

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:03.690
Egypt. Nasser’s was a largely secular nationalism,
and he and his successors saw one of the other

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:08.690
anti-imperialistic nationalist forces in Egypt,
the Muslim Brotherhood, as a threat. So once

00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:12.620
in power, Nasser and the army banned the Muslim
Brotherhood, forcing it underground, where

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:16.880
it would disappear and never become an issue
again. Wait, what’s that? …Really?

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:20.710
And finally let’s turn to Central and Southern
Africa. One of the most problematic legacies

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:25.100
of colonialism was its geography. Colonial
boundaries became redefined as the borders

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.870
of new nation states, even where those boundaries
were arbitrary or, in some cases, pernicious.

00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:33.770
The best known example is in Rwanda, where
two very different tribes, the Hutu and the

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:38.030
Tutsis were combined into one nation. But,
more generally, the colonizers’ focus on

00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:42.780
value extraction really hurt these new nations.
Europeans claimed to bring civilization and

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:47.070
economic development to their colonies, but
this economic development focused solely on

00:09:47.070 --> 00:09:51.020
building infrastructure to get resources and
export them.

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:55.460
Now whether European powers deliberately sabotaged
development in Africa is a hot-button topic

00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:59.660
we’re going to stay well away from, but
this much is inarguably true: when the Europeans

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:05.390
left, African nations did not have the institutions
necessary to thrive in the post-war industrial

00:10:05.390 --> 00:10:09.380
world. They had very few schools, for instance,
and even fewer universities. Like, when the

00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:15.850
Congo achieved independence from Belgium in
1960, there were sixteen college graduates

00:10:15.850 --> 00:10:18.360
in a country of fourteen million people.

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:22.160
Also, in many of these new countries, the
traditional elites had been undermined by

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.550
imperialism. Most Europeans didn’t rule
their African possessions directly but rather

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:30.180
through the proxies of local rulers. And once
the Europeans left, those local rulers, the

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:34.480
upper classes, were seen as illegitimate collaborators.
And this meant that a new group of rulers

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.890
had to rise up to take their place, often
with very little experience in governance.

00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:42.820
I mean, Zimbabwe’s long-serving dictator
Robert Mugabe was a high school teacher. Let

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:48.160
that be a lesson to you. YOUR TEACHERS MAY
HAVE DICTATORIAL AMBITIONS. But most strongmen

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:52.220
have emerged, of course, from the military:
Joseph Mobutu seized power in the Congo, which

00:10:52.220 --> 00:10:58.560
he held from 1965 until his death in 1997.
Idi Amin was military dictator of Uganda from

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:05.470
1971 to 1979. Muammar Gaddafi ruled Libya
from 1977 until 2011. The list goes on, but

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.190
I don’t want to give the wrong impression
about Africa.

00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:11.310
Because while the continent does have less
freedom and lower levels of development than

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:16.250
other regions in the world, many African nations
show strong and consistent signs of growth

00:11:16.250 --> 00:11:20.940
despite the challenges of decolonization.
Botswana for instance has gone from 70% literacy

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:27.450
to 85% in the past 15 years and has seen steady
GDP growth over 5%. Benin’s economy has

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:32.170
grown in each of the past 12 years, which
is better than Europe or the US can say. In

00:11:32.170 --> 00:11:38.590
2002, Kenya’s life expectancy was 47; today
it’s 63. Ethiopia’s per capita GDP has

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:44.090
doubled over the past 10 years; and Mauritania has
seen its infant mortality rate fall by more than 40%.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:48.510
Now, this progress is spotty and fragile,
but it’s important to note that these nations

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:54.300
have existed, on average, about 13 years less
than my dad. Of course, past experience with

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:58.890
the fall of empires hasn’t given us cause
for hope, but many citizens of these new nations

00:11:58.890 --> 00:12:03.760
are seeing real progress. That said, disaster
might lurk around the corner. It’s hard

00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:07.820
to say. I mean, now more than ever, we’re
trying to tell the story of humans… from

00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.780
inside the story of humans.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.060
Thanks for watching. I’ll see you next week.

00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:16.080
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller. Our script supervisor is Meredith

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.680
Danko. The associate producer is Danica Johnson.
The show is written by my high school history

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:23.330
teacher, Raoul Meyer, and myself. And our
graphics team is Thought Bubble. Last week’s

00:12:23.330 --> 00:12:26.190
phrase of the week was “Meatloaf’s Career.”
If you want to guess at this week’s phrase

00:12:26.190 --> 00:12:30.060
of the week or suggest future ones, you can
do so in comments where you can also ask questions

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:33.440
about today’s video that will be answered
by our team of historians. Thanks for watching

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:36.680
Crash Course and as we say in my hometown,
Don't Forget To Be Awesome.
