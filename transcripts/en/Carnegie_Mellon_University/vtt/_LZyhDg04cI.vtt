00:00:01.544 --> 00:00:02.800
Good morning.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.145
I'm delighted to introduce our
next speaker, Keith Block.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.970
He's a great friend of mine personally,
but

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.350
also a great friend of the university and
of the Heinz College.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.360
Keith is a distinguished
alumnus of the Heinz College,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.730
a member of my Dean's Advisory Council,
and a member of the Board of Trustees.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.863
He's also called CEO of Salesforce and
member of the Board of Directors.

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:35.470
Keith serves and
has served a number of important roles.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:40.260
He's the company's Vice Chairman,
President and served

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.160
as a Director since joining the company
in June 2013, and additionally,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.860
served as the company's chief
operating officer since February 2016 -

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.760
clearly, a multidimensional,
multi-talented person.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.280
As president and COO of Salesforce, Keith
oversaw the company's multi-billion dollar

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:05.005
global sales and services business,
alliances and channels, industry strategy,

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:10.260
corporate development, corporate affairs,
marketing and business operations.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.792
In February 2018, Keith and
his wife Suzanne established

00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:21.370
the Block Center for
Technology and Society at CMU.

00:01:22.924 --> 00:01:27.520
This important center, which is
cross-cutting and university-wide will

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.930
foster critical dialogue on campus to
create inclusive and meaningful plans

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.600
of action on topics such as the future of
work and issues of trust and transparency

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.437
in the use of autonomous systems to
improve the quality of life for all.

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:47.700
Keith holds a Master of Science
Degree in Management and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.966
Policy Analysis from the Heinz College and

00:01:50.966 --> 00:01:56.335
a Bachelor's Degree in Information
Systems from Dietrich College.

00:01:56.335 --> 00:02:00.300
So he was ahead even then at being at
this nexus of technology in society.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.578
In addition to his membership on
the Carnegie Mellon University Board of

00:02:06.578 --> 00:02:09.397
Trustees, he's also currently a member of

00:02:09.397 --> 00:02:14.580
the World Economic Forum's Information
Technology community as a governor and

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.927
on the advisory board of

00:02:19.927 --> 00:02:24.900
our Heinz College and the board
of trustees of the Concord Museum.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.101
Please join me in welcoming
Keith Block to the podium, Keith.

00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:37.390
&gt;&gt; [APPLAUSE]

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.394
&gt;&gt; Well, thank you, Krishnan.

00:02:39.394 --> 00:02:41.850
You've made me blush this morning,
so I appreciate that.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.990
And thank you very much for
that very kind introduction.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.897
So first I wanna say,
good morning, everybody.

00:02:50.897 --> 00:02:52.010
&gt;&gt; Good morning.

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:53.225
&gt;&gt; Okay, that was my best Farnam.

00:02:53.225 --> 00:02:57.830
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; I gave it a run, my friend.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:58.948
Anyway, good morning to everybody.

00:02:58.948 --> 00:03:05.690
Faculty, alumni, staff,
family and friends,

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.418
it is an honor to be here today to
celebrate the investiture of a great man,

00:03:10.418 --> 00:03:14.310
Dr. Farnam Jahanian, as president
of Carnegie Mellon University.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:20.800
In all of life's endeavors, Farnam
has led with a tremendous spirit and

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.890
an unrivaled dedication.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.930
Whether as a world renowned
computer scientist,

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.590
a passionate, successful entrepreneur,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:34.780
a tireless public servant or
a world class leader in higher education.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.030
And by the way, just an incredible,
incredible human being.

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.990
Now I've had the opportunity to
work very closely with Farnam.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:48.030
And we have shared many
experiences around career and

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.357
our life journeys, including
everybody's favorite, parenthood.

00:03:53.357 --> 00:03:57.437
And Farnam, by the way, that advice you
gave me about curfews for teenage kids,

00:03:57.437 --> 00:03:58.821
thank you so much for that.

00:03:58.821 --> 00:03:59.826
I would never have thought of that myself.

00:03:59.826 --> 00:04:02.999
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
&gt;&gt; [COUGH] But thank goodness it worked.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:08.080
Over the years, we've had a very, very
close relationship and friendship, and for

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.370
that, I'm very, very grateful.

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.650
Professionally, I've also had
the opportunity to observe Farnam

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.460
in his influence and guiding policy
at the world economic forum

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:17.870
and I will tell all of you,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:20.460
he has represented this
university incredibly well.

00:04:21.888 --> 00:04:26.460
I've also witnessed his leadership here
at CMU personally with students and

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.260
faculty and staff and
members of the Board of Trustees.

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.454
And whether it's uniting the community to
support the Special Olympics,

00:04:35.454 --> 00:04:39.011
where I understand he has a passion for
dunk tanks -

00:04:39.011 --> 00:04:41.627
do you just wanna come up and
tell everybody about this dunk tank?

00:04:41.627 --> 00:04:44.274
alright,
I'm sure you'll get to that at some point -

00:04:44.274 --> 00:04:47.594
or really fostering engagement between
students from different colleges,

00:04:47.594 --> 00:04:50.745
Farnam has a talent, a true talent for
bringing people together and

00:04:50.745 --> 00:04:51.850
breaking down walls.

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:57.960
Farnam is also a leader with impeccable
integrity and the highest of character.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:04.078
He conducts himself with grace, and
dignity, and thoughtfulness and warmth.

00:05:04.078 --> 00:05:07.424
There is no question, no question,
Farnam will guide this institution into

00:05:07.424 --> 00:05:09.640
the future and
accelerate its impact on the world.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.560
So today,

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:17.050
we witness the passing of the torch
to an incredibly talented individual.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.460
Now this torch has been held by many,

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:22.140
many great leaders throughout
Carnegie Mellon's very rich history

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.510
and there have been so
many accomplishments and so

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:25.600
many historic milestones.

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:31.018
Since Andrew Carnegie founded
a technical school in 1900,

00:05:31.018 --> 00:05:33.172
individuals of great character and

00:05:33.172 --> 00:05:38.142
honor have taken the reigns of leadership
of this very prestigious institution.

00:05:38.142 --> 00:05:42.945
And each of them have led with courage and

00:05:42.945 --> 00:05:47.184
vision, names like Hamerschlag,

00:05:47.184 --> 00:05:51.580
Doherty, Stever, Cyert, Cohon.

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.300
Those are but a few.

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.140
Each of these presidents and
others of the storied institution

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.100
led through myriad of chapters of
American history, world history.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.810
The turn of the century,
the Great Depression,

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.970
the explosion of technology that Jim was
talking about just a few minutes ago,

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:13.180
civil unrest, war and peace

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:17.381
and throughout all of this, the presidents
of Carnegie Mellon have guided

00:06:17.381 --> 00:06:20.994
this institution to the forefront
of educational excellence

00:06:20.994 --> 00:06:24.440
and they have shaped the minds of so
many young people

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:30.830
all the while ensuring that the university
remained a source of inspiration,

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:33.770
a guiding light, a beacon of hope.

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:38.764
And now we pass this
torch to Farnam Jahanian.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.780
There was no one who is better suited
to lead us into the next chapter

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.320
and this next chapter is
arguably the most important ever.

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:49.956
For we do live in very,
very interesting times.

00:06:49.956 --> 00:06:52.897
We have seen, and
this is just the beginning, but

00:06:52.897 --> 00:06:56.490
we have seen incredible
advances in technology.

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:58.410
We are at the dawn of a new era.

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.550
Some refer to it as the fourth
industrial revolution.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.470
And this is where we have the convergence,
the perfect storm of social and mobile and

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.290
deep learning and artificial
intelligence and 3D printing and

00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:14.360
amazing technologies, all brought
together to drive incredible innovation.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:18.408
Now like many of you,
I had the opportunity and

00:07:18.408 --> 00:07:21.716
good fortune to speak with other CEOs and
world leaders

00:07:21.716 --> 00:07:25.100
and what is top of mind
in that group is how to

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:29.520
harness this wave of innovation
in a very positive way.

00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:34.690
This convergence of technology is
having a profound impact on our world.

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:36.289
We see it in our daily lives.

00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.620
It has also brought great disruption and
given rise to many, many questions.

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.080
What will these new technologies be?

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:47.421
Will they be positive for mankind?

00:07:47.421 --> 00:07:49.860
What are the socioeconomic effects?

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.069
What are the privacy implications?

00:07:52.069 --> 00:07:54.359
What will be the regulatory issues?

00:07:54.359 --> 00:07:56.059
What will be the future of work?

00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:02.050
And Farnam is passionate about these
questions and even more passionate

00:08:02.050 --> 00:08:06.760
about CMU leading the way to drive
those answers to these questions.

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:11.750
These are all important issues of our time
that we have to consider in a thoughtful

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.130
and meaningful and measured way.

00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:17.421
We are clearly at an inflection point.

00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:21.330
These advances must be for good.

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:22.430
They must enlighten.

00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:23.430
They must empower.

00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.930
And they must take humanity
to greater heights.

00:08:25.930 --> 00:08:28.740
And in a world where there is
an ever increasing divide,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:32.820
these advances must create opportunity for
all, not just a few.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:37.810
So that all of mankind can participate and
contribute.

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:43.590
Now this will take vigilance, it will take
dedication, and it will take leadership.

00:08:43.590 --> 00:08:47.290
And this is why the faculty, the staff,
the students, this community at

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:52.720
Carnegie Mellon are so critical to
the future of this nation, this society,

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.350
this world, for the young minds that we
shape here have an important mission.

00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.461
They will go forth into the world
with the knowledge, the vision, and

00:09:01.461 --> 00:09:03.955
the ethics that Carnegie Mellon
has instilled in them.

00:09:03.955 --> 00:09:07.427
And they will go forward into
the world to solve universal

00:09:07.427 --> 00:09:11.420
issues that lie at the intersection
of technology and humanity.

00:09:12.830 --> 00:09:15.370
The graduates of CMU must
be equipped to thrive and

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:18.830
lead in a world in uncertainty for
these are truly uncertain times.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:24.570
Today the value of trust is
being questioned more than ever.

00:09:24.570 --> 00:09:29.563
Trust in technology, trust in our
institutions, trust in our leaders.

00:09:29.563 --> 00:09:31.538
Some would say there is a crisis of trust.

00:09:33.493 --> 00:09:37.182
And this crisis of trust has
created a leadership void.

00:09:37.182 --> 00:09:40.370
And now individuals, and
companies, and faculty, and

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.571
students alike must fill this breach.

00:09:42.571 --> 00:09:46.050
And it will be the graduates of CMU that
will answer this call for leadership.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.820
And for them, it is a call to arms.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:49.780
It is a call to arms for us all.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:54.060
It is an obligation to lead in
an ethical and transparent way,

00:09:55.390 --> 00:10:01.110
to engage in constructive civil discourse,
where disagreements will arise,

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:05.060
and that's okay, but
dialogue must happen with respect.

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:08.250
And while there can be differing opinions,
there cannot be differing facts.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:14.740
And most important, most important,
to restore trust in our society,

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:16.810
because without trust, we have nothing.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:21.220
It will be the graduates of Carnegie
Mellon that will be called upon to

00:10:21.220 --> 00:10:24.670
cultivate and drive a culture of
success in business and society.

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:30.850
Where the core tenants of diversity,
empathy, equality, humanity,

00:10:30.850 --> 00:10:36.233
accountability and opportunity for
all are at the forefront.

00:10:36.233 --> 00:10:40.320
Never before has this institution
been more important to the world.

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:45.123
Never before has leadership at the
intersection of technology and society and

00:10:45.123 --> 00:10:47.900
humanity been as critical
as it is right now.

00:10:47.900 --> 00:10:51.710
And though the future is unwritten,
I am very confident, very confident that

00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:55.130
the graduates of CMU will be the authors
of a great future for all of us.

00:10:57.320 --> 00:10:59.920
Now as we stand at the doorstep
of this new world,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:04.450
the dawn of a new era, we need a truly
special leader to help guide and

00:11:04.450 --> 00:11:08.620
shape the lives of those who will
determine the future, all of our futures.

00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:11.550
And never before has the presidency
of this institution been

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:12.940
as important as it is right now.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:18.550
And it requires a remarkable leader,
a truly outstanding human being.

00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:21.510
And that person is Dr. Farnam Jahanian.

00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:24.750
We stand with Farnam today as
he takes his rightful place

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.430
amongst the great presidents
of Carnegie Mellon.

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:32.700
I cannot imagine a better leader
who embodies the values of CMU.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.050
I cannot imagine a better
leader with as much vision,

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.350
with as much passion, with as much focus

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:44.072
and I cannot imagine a better leader and
torch bearer of this great institution.

00:11:44.072 --> 00:11:47.380
Farnam, we are very lucky to have you.

00:11:47.380 --> 00:11:49.880
You are the right leader,
as Jim says, at the right time.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:54.433
So ladies and gentlemen, please join me
in congratulating a true friend, a great

00:11:54.433 --> 00:11:58.139
