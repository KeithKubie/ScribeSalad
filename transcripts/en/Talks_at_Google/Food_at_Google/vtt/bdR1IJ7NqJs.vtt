[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.180
DANIEL LANIGAN: So my
name is Daniel Lanigan.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.300
I am the CEO and founder of
Lord Hobo Brewing Company,

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.000
as well as a half
dozen other craft beer

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.580
bars over the last 15 years.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.710
I'm titling this talk today
Lord Hobo Brewing Company

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.659
and the fairytale towards the
first billion dollars, OK?

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.950
I'm going to tell you a little
bit about my background.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.860
Then we're going to dive
into the brewery itself

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.159
and get into a little
bit of our culture

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.760
and why we're the fastest
growing brewery in the United

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:36.580
States, I think.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.950
I have some ideas why we are.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.960
I'm open to other
interpretations.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.010
So briefly, I could speak about
beer and the state of craft

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.490
beer and the nuances of
it and flavor profiles

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.290
and the bubble
bursting and hops,

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.498
and everything else that's
happening in the industry.

00:00:53.498 --> 00:00:55.820
I've been doing this
for my whole adult life.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.950
I could talk about
this for days.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.190
We don't have that time.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.750
So I'm going to try to
slam through a few stories

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.150
and core principles, and
then give you guys some time

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.280
to talk, answer some questions.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.120
But there's a lot to cover,
and 15 years of my experience

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.820
and trying to summarize
that in 27 minutes or less.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.930
So very quickly, 15 years ago,
I opened up a craft beer bar

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.420
at a college town
at UMass Amherst.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.690
I was 26, and I
knew that I didn't

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:28.670
have any skills or
a college degree

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.100
or rich parents
or anything, so I

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.040
had to figure out a way to
develop some long-term income.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.819
And I didn't want to be
a bartender in my 70s.

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:38.360
No offense to
70-year-old bartenders,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.200
but I just wanted to
have a way to retire.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.480
And so I wanted to
open up my own place.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.170
I wanted to be my own boss.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.210
And so I raised up a few
bucks from friends and family,

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.320
sold off all my poetry
books, literally,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.790
and I cobbled
together enough money

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:57.800
to buy a crappy dive bar on the
outskirts of a college town.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.400
And I was determined to make
it into a craft beer bar.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.340
And in 2002, there
wasn't a lot of those.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.017
There wasn't a craft beer bar
around Amherst for 100 miles.

00:02:07.017 --> 00:02:08.600
You had to come all
the way to Boston.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.040
And even back then it
was Redbones and Sunset.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.430
A couple of other stalwarts.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.540
A place in Albany called
Maharas, which is now gone.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.050
So at the time, everyone
thought I was crazy,

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.480
because if you know
at UMass Amherst,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.790
it's a pitcher and shot
for a dollar kind of town.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.400
Every bar caters to
college students.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.010
And there was really nobody
there, fortunately for me,

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.920
catering to adults
and grad students.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.790
And UMass Amherst area
has a ton of those people.

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.597
So we opened up with $5
pints of 9% IPA and beers

00:02:39.597 --> 00:02:40.930
no one had ever heard of before.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.890
And fortunately for
me, we got crushed.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.890
Day 1, place was
packed, and day 2, place

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.460
was packed, and kept
going like that.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.380
And we became sort of
an oasis for people.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.820
And I think I probably
could have sold Rumple Minze

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.570
and Jagermeister, and we
still would have been packed.

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.319
It's just we were catered
to an older audience, a more

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:00.860
sophisticated
audience, and there was

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.900
just nobody else doing that.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.310
We just happened to sell
a lot of craft beer,

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.920
and that really worked for us.

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.050
So I was 26.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.790
I was making more
money than I would ever

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.480
think I would ever
make in my life,

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.554
and I decided to
open another place.

00:03:15.554 --> 00:03:16.970
And that was sort
of a trend I did

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.752
where sort of a serial
entrepreneur at heart,

00:03:19.752 --> 00:03:21.710
and I like to think that
I make good decisions.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.084
And I say to people
all the time,

00:03:23.084 --> 00:03:26.300
like, the best deals you ever
do are the ones you say no to.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.430
But I still did some dumb deals.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:31.220
And so I opened up a place
Northampton, big restaurant,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:33.180
and I went from, like,
working 25 hours a week,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.270
making tons of money, to
working 80 hours a week

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:37.850
and making just 10% more money.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:40.527
And so it wasn't
a very good idea.

00:03:40.527 --> 00:03:42.860
And I did that for a few
years, and then sold them both.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.193
I wanted to go back to Boston
and play with the big boys

00:03:45.193 --> 00:03:47.527
and have the craft
beer bar in Boston.

00:03:47.527 --> 00:03:49.610
At the time, the Public
House was getting started,

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:50.975
Deep Ellum was getting started.

00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:52.850
And I had a lot of
reverence for those places

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.980
and I thought well
in 2006 we won Best

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.030
Beer Bar in the country, But we
were in the middle of nowhere.

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.300
So I sold them all, came
to Boston, determined

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.660
to open up a place, and that's
where we opened up Lord Hobo.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.110
And Lord Hobo turned eight
years old this week on Monday.

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:11.490
So eight years in the
restaurant business, long time,

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:13.940
so it's pretty cool to
have that kind of legacy.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:16.370
And we actually
feel like we're part

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.714
of the old part of
Cambridge, because I

00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:20.880
feel like since I started
talking a few minutes ago,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.754
there's probably been
two restaurants opening

00:04:22.754 --> 00:04:24.080
in Cambridge.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.650
So to be able to last that long
and to create sort of a legacy

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.180
has been really important
and fortunate and even lucky.

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.910
So from there, I
opened up a place

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.494
in Baltimore called Alewife, a
place in Queens called Alewife.

00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:39.701
I'm part of a couple other
bars in New York City that

00:04:39.701 --> 00:04:41.150
are all craft beer-focused.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.150
I have invested in a bar in
Brussels called Moeder Lambic.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.170
It's probably the
most important--

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.820
arguably the most important
beer bar in all of Europe.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.360
And so craft beer has been
my dominant part of my life,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:58.020
for better or worse, you know?

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.050
It's a good lifestyle.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.170
It's not great for your body.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:06.750
There are craft beer bar
owners who are thin, I think.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.630
But I don't know any, you know.

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:17.647 --> 00:05:18.980
AUDIENCE: Are you drinking that?

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:19.764
DANIEL LANIGAN: What
the fuck's going on?

00:05:19.764 --> 00:05:20.612
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:20.612 --> 00:05:21.460
Shit.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:22.543
I'm not supposed to swear.

00:05:22.543 --> 00:05:24.260
Sorry.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.570
There's an office pool at
the office for how many times

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.490
I say the F word today.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:32.300
So I've been paying attention
to the industry for a long time.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.980
I've been selling
things by hand,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:37.460
convincing people who are
curious and not convinced,

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:40.045
and convincing people that craft
beer and the quality of craft

00:05:40.045 --> 00:05:42.579
beer is the way to go.

00:05:42.579 --> 00:05:44.870
And by doing it so passionately
for a really long time,

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:46.994
and visiting breweries,
and taking staff to Europe,

00:05:46.994 --> 00:05:49.690
and really just pushing
the envelope as hard

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.070
as I could to learn as
much as I could about,

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:55.660
what is craft beer,
who drinks it, and why?

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.330
And one of our core philosophies
of the brewery is to us,

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:03.080
beer is the most affordable
luxury item on Earth.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.390
There's no Saudi prince
that can buy a better

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:06.620
beer than you and I can buy.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:11.820
The best beers in the world
are $6 or $8, or maybe $10.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.600
Maybe a rare Belgian
bottle is $25 bucks.

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.790
But when you do down
on the street, when

00:06:16.790 --> 00:06:18.990
you pay $10 for a
pint at Lord Hobo,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.140
you're getting a
world-class offering.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:24.590
You know, you can't say that
about yachts or wine or even

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.115
steaks or homes
or cars, whatever.

00:06:26.115 --> 00:06:28.490
There's always somebody who
can buy a better one than you

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.680
can buy, except for beer.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.150
So the difference between
a $4 pint and a $10 pint

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:37.910
is astronomical in
the sense of value.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:40.500
And you can't get that
in any other field.

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.860
Even coffee, I think
you can buy coffee beans

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:46.350
that, like, monkeys shit
through or something like that,

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:47.960
and it's like $200 a pound.

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.900
So there is a coffee bean that
a Saudi prince can buy that you

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.860
cannot buy.

00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:54.350
But with beer, it's an
affordable luxury item.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:57.380
So we've been pushing that as
one of our core principles.

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.350
So when I was sort of looking
at the landscape of things

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:02.810
and saying, look, I'm kind
of tired of restaurants,

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.480
the restaurants are not
a real growth industry,

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:08.360
the problem with them is
once your building is full,

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.750
there's no room for growth.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:12.140
So if we're slammed
seven nights a week,

00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:14.270
we can't knock down
the walls or go outside

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:16.711
or go down the street
or go to the next state.

00:07:16.711 --> 00:07:18.210
Unless you want to
open-- unless you

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:21.602
want to operate 40 restaurants,
which I don't want to do.

00:07:21.602 --> 00:07:23.810
So I thought, I've got to
get into a growth industry.

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:27.800
I'm watching my friends,
Sam from [INAUDIBLE],, Greg

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:31.310
from Stone who I met very
early on in my career.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:34.130
They've worked as
hard as I have.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.590
Maybe 5% harder, maybe not.

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.914
But they're worth hundreds
of millions of dollars.

00:07:39.914 --> 00:07:41.330
I work just as
hard as those guys,

00:07:41.330 --> 00:07:45.070
and I am not worth a
fraction of 1% of that.

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.630
And so I'm like, what
am I doing wrong here?

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.167
So I looked at the landscape
and thought, at this point--

00:07:51.167 --> 00:07:53.000
this is four years ago
now, so the brewery's

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.041
two and a half years old.

00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:57.440
Four years ago I
said, the top 10 IPAs

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.350
in New England that
everyone's going crazy for

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:03.660
are all commercially unavailable
on a day-to-day basis.

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:06.650
You've got to know somebody,
wait in line, trade for it,

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:08.510
paid too much for it on eBay.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:10.834
I thought, why is
nobody scaling this?

00:08:10.834 --> 00:08:12.500
If everybody's waiting
in line two hours

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:16.070
for a four-pack
that's $20 bucks,

00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:19.040
why doesn't someone
build a bigger brewery?

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:21.310
And I thought about
that for a long time,

00:08:21.310 --> 00:08:25.660
and I thought, if somebody
could build world-class IPAs

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.540
and stick them on every
shelf, we would crush it.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.750
And so that's what
I set out to do.

00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:34.580
I raised a bunch of money.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.169
People like being
part of breweries

00:08:36.169 --> 00:08:37.370
more than they like being
part of restaurants.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:39.740
There's something sort of
tactile and sexy and romantic

00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:40.669
about it.

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:43.307
So it was much easier to
raise money for that reason.

00:08:43.307 --> 00:08:45.140
So I raised a bunch of
money, and I went out

00:08:45.140 --> 00:08:46.400
looking for a building.

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:48.710
And I wanted to be
in Boston proper.

00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:49.490
I'm a Bostonian.

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.531
I'm really proud of that.

00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:52.387
I love the city.

00:08:52.387 --> 00:08:53.970
I've been living
here for a long time.

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:55.700
I'll always have a home here.

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:59.400
I couldn't find a building
that suited my needs.

00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:01.970
So I went further afield
and ended up in Woburn.

00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:05.390
And it was my 24th or 25th
building in a 12-month period

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.082
that I saw.

00:09:06.082 --> 00:09:07.790
And I walked in, and
I had to really keep

00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:10.610
a poker face, because I knew
immediately that this was it.

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:15.000
It was 47,000 square feet,
had tons of infrastructure.

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.770
It had cranes and vestibules,
bathrooms, fire sprinkler

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:21.300
systems.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.620
Things that you
don't think about

00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:24.050
that you end up
having to pay for.

00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:26.570
It just had all the
guts that were there.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.160
All we needed to do
was add equipment.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.850
The problem is the rent on
a 47,000-square-foot place--

00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.960
even that $7.25 a square foot,
which is a steal relative

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:39.100
to Boston, I was looking at
$65 bucks a foot some places--

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:43.160
was still $350,000 a year
before taxes and insurance.

00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:46.180
So you're looking at
$40,000-plus a month in rent

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:48.730
for a startup which
has no revenue.

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:53.030
And on top of that, I
was interviewing a person

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.720
who ended up who is now my COO.

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.430
And he said, man.

00:09:58.430 --> 00:10:02.570
To do what you want to do with
this ambition, you need a team.

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.690
I was like, you don't know
what you're talking about.

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.170
I've been doing all
this stuff myself.

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.330
Well, he was really correct.

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:11.750
And so we've been carrying--

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:13.750
you know, we as a startup
brewery, we had a CEO,

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:17.020
we had a CFO, we had
a CMO, we had an CEO.

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:18.620
Carrying a lot of
salary for a startup

00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:23.590
brewery that has zero revenue
and $40,000 a month rent due.

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.840
And it took us 12 months
to build the place.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.565
So we had a half
million dollars of rent

00:10:27.565 --> 00:10:30.220
due before we even
opened, plus salaries.

00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.490
So it was an ambitious
project for sure,

00:10:33.490 --> 00:10:36.880
and it could have
been a disaster.

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.910
Why wasn't it a disaster?

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.830
I think it's mostly
because we understood

00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:45.460
what the opportunity was, what
the void in the marketplace

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:46.360
was.

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.330
We knew that people want
these New England IPAs.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:50.770
They want them on every shelf.

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:51.750
They don't really
want to wait in line.

00:10:51.750 --> 00:10:52.583
Some people like it.

00:10:52.583 --> 00:10:54.525
Some people are masochists.

00:10:54.525 --> 00:10:55.400
They like the ritual.

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:58.180
They like to keep the kids in
the car for two hours crying

00:10:58.180 --> 00:10:59.927
so Dad can get his four-pack.

00:10:59.927 --> 00:11:01.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.140
I see you out there.

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.415
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:06.690
And so we've just filled a void.

00:11:06.690 --> 00:11:12.190
And we opened June 19 of 2015.

00:11:12.190 --> 00:11:17.350
We In our first 12 months, we
sold 9,000 barrels of beer.

00:11:17.350 --> 00:11:18.575
And at that point--

00:11:18.575 --> 00:11:20.200
I think it's still
true-- no one's ever

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:21.824
sold that much beer
in their first year

00:11:21.824 --> 00:11:23.710
as an independent craft brewery.

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:28.290
We did 3,000 in '15 total
from June to January 1.

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.320
We did 15,400 last year.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:34.630
We'll do about 32,000 this year.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.580
So to put that in
perspective, there

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:41.290
are roughly 6,000 breweries
in operation in the US,

00:11:41.290 --> 00:11:45.360
and we are just about 100th.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.920
102, 99, something like that.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:50.900
So we leapfrogged
5,900 breweries

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:53.590
in two and a half years,
which is remarkable.

00:11:53.590 --> 00:11:56.219
By anyone's metric,
it's a massive success.

00:11:56.219 --> 00:11:58.510
And we're all-- there's a
bunch of us in the room here.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:01.750
So it's extraordinary
what's happened.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.510
And we only have four beers.

00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:06.260
And we only have--

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:09.030
I mean, let me make
sure that's true.

00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:14.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:18.310
We are now sold in 14 states.

00:12:18.310 --> 00:12:20.530
We just launched
four in eight weeks.

00:12:20.530 --> 00:12:23.200
It was frantic.

00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:27.070
Pretty stupid, but there's a
real sort of a blackout period

00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:29.020
for launching around here.

00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:31.180
Basically, November,
December, distributors

00:12:31.180 --> 00:12:32.710
don't want to talk to you
because they're all gearing up

00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:33.550
for Christmas.

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:35.270
January is the slowest
part of the year.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:37.270
It's when everyone kind
of catches their breath.

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:39.120
We didn't want to have
a blackout period.

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.960
We needed to sell more beer.

00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:45.920
So we can do about 200,000
barrels in our building.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.630
I said that before, we'll
do about 32,000 this year.

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.380
We have room to grow 7x
from where we are right now.

00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:57.580
And at some point, you know,
if we approach that capacity,

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.980
we will obviously find another
building, which we just

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:00.563
did, actually.

00:13:00.563 --> 00:13:05.170
We just bought a building across
the street, 18,000 square feet,

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.370
because it was available.

00:13:06.370 --> 00:13:08.560
I knew that when we
needed it in two years,

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:09.530
it probably wouldn't
be available,

00:13:09.530 --> 00:13:10.450
so we grabbed it now.

00:13:10.450 --> 00:13:11.950
So we've always
been trying to be

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:15.240
aggressive with our
opportunity and our capacity.

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:17.920
And so the typical
brewery constraint,

00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.690
we see it literally hundreds and
hundreds of times, is people--

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.020
they don't have enough cash.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.000
They don't have
enough credibility.

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.374
They don't have
enough customers.

00:13:26.374 --> 00:13:28.270
But they always go too small.

00:13:28.270 --> 00:13:29.880
They go into 4,000 square feet.

00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:32.000
They have a five-barrel system.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.780
To put it in perspective,
we have a 40-barrel.

00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.920
So our pots are bigger than a
lot of other breweries' pots.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:42.550
And they sell out their
beer, and they don't

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:43.851
have enough capital to grow.

00:13:43.851 --> 00:13:45.100
They probably still have debt.

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:46.930
They probably are waiting
for their neighbor

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:48.305
to go out of
business so they can

00:13:48.305 --> 00:13:50.210
grab another 3,000 square feet.

00:13:50.210 --> 00:13:53.567
So even if you have wild
success and make wonderful beer,

00:13:53.567 --> 00:13:55.150
if you can't grow,
you can't scale it.

00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:57.350
Well, that's not our
motto, obviously.

00:13:57.350 --> 00:13:59.620
Our motto is to go national.

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.650
It's working so far.

00:14:07.650 --> 00:14:09.885
Whether or not--

00:14:09.885 --> 00:14:11.510
I have some doubts
about whether or not

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:14.650
we'll ever see another national
craft brewery, literally

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:17.000
meaning 40-plus states.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.410
Because right now, there's
two or three breweries

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.036
opening a day, and the
hyperlocal movement

00:14:24.036 --> 00:14:25.160
is definitely a real thing.

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.334
So the challenge for us--
and it's a fun challenge--

00:14:28.334 --> 00:14:30.500
the challenge of growth,
the challenge of the future

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:36.530
is, how do we become relevant
as a Boston-based brewery

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:41.360
to Seattle, or to Portland,
Oregon, or to Vancouver?

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.490
That's the sort of unique
challenge of our future.

00:14:43.490 --> 00:14:46.580
I feel like we'll comfortably
get to 100,000 barrels, which

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:47.570
is so extraordinary.

00:14:47.570 --> 00:14:51.440
We'd still be the top, I think,
probably 50 or so breweries

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.940
in the country.

00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.370
But to get to our
capacity and beyond,

00:14:55.370 --> 00:14:58.400
and to get to the
fairytale trail

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.135
to the billion
dollar company, we're

00:15:01.135 --> 00:15:02.510
going to have to
figure out a way

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:05.957
to become relevant to
Seattle, as an example.

00:15:05.957 --> 00:15:07.790
And when they have 200
other breweries there

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.670
that are all making-- well,
most of them making great beer,

00:15:10.670 --> 00:15:12.860
that's the challenge, right?

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:14.660
How can I get someone
in Seattle to say,

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:18.140
I'm going to bypass these
125 local breweries to buy

00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:20.480
this brewery from Boston?

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.584
So it's possible.

00:15:21.584 --> 00:15:23.000
I just haven't
figured it out yet.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.560
So you guys are all smart.

00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:27.620
Let me know if you
have any ideas.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.240
We do have a
significant advantage

00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.314
over a lot of other
breweries nationally,

00:15:32.314 --> 00:15:33.730
which we weren't
really expecting.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:36.560
This was not some
clever ploy that we're

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:38.200
smarter than everybody else.

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:39.810
Just happens to be happening.

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:48.020
So the New England IPA is a
real now national phenomena.

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:50.360
In the craft beer
circles, everybody

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.940
wants or is attempting to make
or is making New England IPA.

00:15:55.940 --> 00:15:58.310
What is New England IPA?

00:15:58.310 --> 00:16:00.540
If anyone in the room
knows that answer,

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.350
you'll probably
be a billionaire.

00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:03.350
What is New England IPA?

00:16:03.350 --> 00:16:04.183
I couldn't tell you.

00:16:04.183 --> 00:16:05.735
It's a pretty random--

00:16:05.735 --> 00:16:07.610
everyone makes them a
little bit differently,

00:16:07.610 --> 00:16:09.140
but they have some similar--

00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:13.310
there are some characters
that are pretty much involved.

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:15.740
They tend to be hazy,
they tend to be juicy,

00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:18.410
they tend to not have a
lot of residual bitterness.

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.660
They tend to be almost turbid.

00:16:21.660 --> 00:16:23.940
Very tropical, floral aroma.

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:25.530
And they don't have--

00:16:25.530 --> 00:16:27.960
I mentioned they don't have
a lot of residual bitterness.

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:31.610
So the West Coast IPA typically
has a lot of malt sweetness

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:33.760
and a lot of strong bitterness.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:36.860
The New England IPA is
basically all the good part

00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:39.370
of hops without the sweetness.

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:43.950
And so The Alchemist,
Hill Farmstead, Trillium,

00:16:43.950 --> 00:16:47.360
Tree House, Lawson's,
Fiddlehead, Maine,

00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:51.350
et cetera, all those
folks make what I would

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:53.300
consider New England-style IPA.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.640
They just don't make them
to leave New England.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:57.830
They make them to stay
within sometimes 30 miles

00:16:57.830 --> 00:16:59.980
of their home brewery.

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:03.710
Trillium sells 15,000 barrels
a year out their front door.

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:05.480
It's incredible.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:08.119
Tree House is on pace to
sell 25,000 barrels out

00:17:08.119 --> 00:17:10.760
of their new facility
at their front door.

00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.530
Crazy talk.

00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:17.000
So we didn't have the benefit
of baking the pie that long.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.690
We couldn't take seven years to
become Tree House or Trillium

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:22.150
like they have.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:25.050
I think trillium's
five years old.

00:17:25.050 --> 00:17:26.520
We had to do it in a hurry.

00:17:26.520 --> 00:17:28.430
But the benefit
of that for us is

00:17:28.430 --> 00:17:34.580
right now, California, Oregon,
Washington, UK, Australia,

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.620
they want New England
IPA, and we are literally

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.220
the only brewery that's scaling
and can actually get the beer

00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:43.270
to them fresh and beautiful.

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.050
And we get to be first and
we get to define the style,

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:47.800
because there's a lot
of other breweries--

00:17:47.800 --> 00:17:49.758
like, there's a million
breweries in California

00:17:49.758 --> 00:17:51.720
now finally making
New England-style IPA.

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:54.370
But they're not the same
as what we're doing here,

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:56.510
because they're
getting typically beers

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:58.374
that have been traded or sold.

00:17:58.374 --> 00:17:59.540
Maybe they're six weeks old.

00:17:59.540 --> 00:18:00.590
Maybe they're 12 weeks old.

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:01.881
Maybe they're totally oxidized.

00:18:01.881 --> 00:18:03.890
Maybe they're not
in great shape.

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:05.570
And maybe they're
having a hard time

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:08.630
dealing with that yeast strain
that's particular to our style,

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:09.940
or whatever the reason is.

00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:11.690
There's not a lot of
breweries on the West

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.170
Coast doing New England-style
IPAs with great success.

00:18:15.170 --> 00:18:17.210
We kind of have that
market cornered.

00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:21.290
And yet we are the only ones to
be able to produce it at scale.

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:24.052
So fortunately for
us, we're first.

00:18:24.052 --> 00:18:25.760
Not only are we first,
but there's really

00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:27.956
nobody on our heels.

00:18:27.956 --> 00:18:29.330
I can't see anybody
in the market

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:32.210
right now that's about to
scale up significantly,

00:18:32.210 --> 00:18:34.850
and who will come into the
market and challenge us.

00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:37.520
So we have this really
interesting sweet spot

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:41.580
of opportunity that I
couldn't have predicted.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:45.190
So we are really
strong in that way.

00:18:45.190 --> 00:18:47.249
Any questions so far?

00:18:47.249 --> 00:18:48.290
AUDIENCE: Quick question.

00:18:48.290 --> 00:18:52.590
So I guess I just don't have
kind of a good feel for what

00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:53.736
distinguishes [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:56.670 --> 00:19:00.180
DANIEL LANIGAN: The question
was about this gentleman likes

00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:02.352
Green Flash West Coast
IPA and he drinks our beer

00:19:02.352 --> 00:19:03.810
and likes that as
well, but doesn't

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:05.500
notice a lot of difference.

00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:08.020
And I will say there's
a lot of difference.

00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:11.350
And I think it has any
drunk side by side and not

00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.850
in a vacuum.

00:19:11.850 --> 00:19:13.560
Because to me, Green
Flash West Coast

00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:18.180
is incredibly bitter and very
malty and very sticky and sweet

00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:20.310
and almost cloyingly so.

00:19:20.310 --> 00:19:22.140
And so it's still enjoyable.

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:24.545
I've drank a million Green
Flash West Coast IPAs.

00:19:24.545 --> 00:19:25.920
I tend not to
drink them anymore,

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:27.510
because I've gotten
tired of that sort

00:19:27.510 --> 00:19:29.839
of cloying sweetness and
that really harsh bitterness.

00:19:29.839 --> 00:19:31.630
I like the beer to be
softer, more elegant.

00:19:31.630 --> 00:19:35.154
So our beers are deliberately
lower carbonated, for example.

00:19:35.154 --> 00:19:37.070
You don't get a lot of
carbonic bite up front.

00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:39.510
To me, carbonic bite gets
in the way of flavor.

00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:42.590
So the reason why you
can't chug a Coca-Cola

00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:44.660
is because the
carbonation's so high.

00:19:44.660 --> 00:19:46.545
But if you ever had
a flat Coca-Cola,

00:19:46.545 --> 00:19:48.450
you could crush it, right?

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:49.762
Our beers are lower--

00:19:49.762 --> 00:19:51.220
not that you would
want to, really.

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:53.505
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:55.710
So our beers are--

00:19:55.710 --> 00:19:58.595
so most breweries, they
package their cans at 2.8 PSI.

00:19:58.595 --> 00:19:59.550
Our is 2.5, right?

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.560
So it's about a 12%,
a 13% difference.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:04.200
So I think that's a
noticeable difference

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.775
so that what you
get with our beer

00:20:05.775 --> 00:20:07.830
is just smooth
flavor right away.

00:20:07.830 --> 00:20:09.670
Elegant, subtle,
balanced flavor.

00:20:09.670 --> 00:20:12.400
Whereas Green Flash,
to me, I have that,

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:15.360
I get tons of carbonation,
which blinds me from the flavor.

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:16.622
I have to wait for it.

00:20:16.622 --> 00:20:19.080
I have to let my mouth kind of
get over the assault it just

00:20:19.080 --> 00:20:20.890
had and get into the flavor.

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:24.510
So if you had 10 West
Coast IPAs that are famous

00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:26.910
and 10 East Coast
IPAs that are famous,

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.410
you would really see
a huge difference.

00:20:29.410 --> 00:20:32.130
AUDIENCE: So in terms of sort
of craft beers that have scaled,

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:34.230
you know, there's some
sort of obvious analogies.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:38.160
You know, Boston Beer Company,
Anchor, maybe Dogfish, you

00:20:38.160 --> 00:20:41.100
know, behind that, how do
you compare those models?

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:44.550
DANIEL LANIGAN: Well, Boston
Beer, they are geniuses.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:47.640
They've never owned their own
brewery until this little 10

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.860
brewery in Jamaica Plain.

00:20:49.860 --> 00:20:51.450
They have contract-brewed
their beer

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.400
in Cincinnati for 30 years.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.740
He's a marketing genius.

00:20:55.740 --> 00:20:57.859
They have 63 flavors.

00:20:57.859 --> 00:20:58.650
He's a billionaire.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.233
They're a multibillion
dollar company.

00:21:00.233 --> 00:21:01.300
They're publicly traded.

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:03.050
You know the story there.

00:21:03.050 --> 00:21:04.920
Absolute genius.

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.990
He was on TV in the
'80s, telling us--

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:11.940
you know, a kid cooking beer
on his kitchen stove, saying,

00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.010
the big guys spill more beer
today that I brew in a year.

00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:17.490
And that was true back then.

00:21:17.490 --> 00:21:20.620
And now he's the big
guy, which is amazing.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.180
So good for him.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:26.490
Dogfish Head-- so Sam Adams
does 2.7 million barrels a year.

00:21:26.490 --> 00:21:29.130
Dogfish Head does about 300,000.

00:21:29.130 --> 00:21:32.040
And so Stone does about
360,000, Bell's is 400,00.

00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:37.900
So those are the big guys
in the craft world now.

00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.530
New Belgium does a million.

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:41.850
Sierra Nevada does
just over a million.

00:21:41.850 --> 00:21:46.950
So it's no guarantee for us
to get to 100,000 or 200,000

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:51.760
because we are then becoming
a big boy in a very real way.

00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:54.780
So Dogfish Head has
never before experienced

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:55.950
non-double digit growth.

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.780
It's always been
greater than 10%.

00:21:57.780 --> 00:22:00.612
A lot of times, much bigger
than-- greater than 10%.

00:22:00.612 --> 00:22:02.070
This is the first
year or last year

00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:04.440
where they were single digits.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.100
And Sierra Nevada took a
step back at 6% last year.

00:22:08.100 --> 00:22:10.920
First year ever they
lost some market share

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:12.330
instead of growing.

00:22:12.330 --> 00:22:16.350
So I look at that
challenge earlier

00:22:16.350 --> 00:22:20.610
being relevant on a national
level when you're in California

00:22:20.610 --> 00:22:22.835
and I'm drinking in Boston.

00:22:22.835 --> 00:22:24.960
That's the challenge that
those guys are facing now

00:22:24.960 --> 00:22:28.590
and the challenges that I'm
concerned about in the future.

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:32.280
AUDIENCE: As an entrepreneur and
as a leader for your company,

00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.580
what other business
people or other companies

00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:40.794
do you find to be inspiring
maybe outside of your industry?

00:22:40.794 --> 00:22:42.460
DANIEL LANIGAN: That's
a great question.

00:22:42.460 --> 00:22:46.380
So I spend a lot of
time watching TED Talks,

00:22:46.380 --> 00:22:50.100
and I'd been to a bunch of
Tony Robbins conferences.

00:22:50.100 --> 00:22:53.575
He's great at-- he's got
one called business mastery.

00:22:53.575 --> 00:22:55.200
I think he's better
at business than he

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:57.180
is at personal development,
which is saying a lot,

00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:59.221
because he's pretty good
at personal development.

00:22:59.221 --> 00:23:03.510
So walking through,
taking a tour here

00:23:03.510 --> 00:23:08.940
and looking at our office
space versus your office space,

00:23:08.940 --> 00:23:14.430
for example, you know, if it
was Larry and Sergey's brewing

00:23:14.430 --> 00:23:16.267
company all those
years ago, I'd be

00:23:16.267 --> 00:23:18.600
curious to see what their
office space would looks like.

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.320
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.320
AUDIENCE: It would look
like yours now probably.

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:23.220
[LAUGH]

00:23:23.220 --> 00:23:27.840
DANIEL LANIGAN: So we operate at
sort of two trains running side

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.645
by side, and one of them is
a relatively mature train,

00:23:30.645 --> 00:23:32.810
and one of them is
relatively a startup.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:35.280
You know, we're two
and a half years old.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:37.770
Four years ago, I moved
into that massive facility

00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.570
with me and my dog and
a little broken desk

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:42.960
and a crappy Wi-Fi signal,
and that was it, you know?

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.160
And now we have 65 employees and
we'll do $25 million of revenue

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:47.830
next year.

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:49.750
And we're really just
getting started, right?

00:23:49.750 --> 00:23:53.099
So there's so much
to learn, and there's

00:23:53.099 --> 00:23:54.390
so many ways to do this, right?

00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:59.370
So the model that The
Alchemist uses or Trillium uses

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:00.670
is wildly successful.

00:24:00.670 --> 00:24:03.106
You know, Trillium prints cash.

00:24:03.106 --> 00:24:04.980
They just don't have a
scalable model, right?

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:07.200
So they're probably
making more money

00:24:07.200 --> 00:24:10.900
than they ever dreamed about,
and they're probably really,

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:13.290
really happy people.

00:24:13.290 --> 00:24:15.780
I wouldn't-- I'm just not
personally satisfied with that.

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:18.029
We're constantly trying to
innovate and be thoughtful,

00:24:18.029 --> 00:24:20.540
and we have a lot of
transparency and openness.

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.070
And sometimes it's a
little bit too democratic.

00:24:23.070 --> 00:24:24.800
Sometimes there just
needs to be someone

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.820
calling the shots sometimes.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:30.670
But for the most part, we
lean on other companies

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:31.950
and how they do things well.

00:24:31.950 --> 00:24:34.580
And we also learn from
a lot of companies,

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.180
how they do things poorly.

00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:38.140
And I love to learn
from people's mistakes.

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:39.420
I don't want to make any.

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:42.450
And thus far as a
four-year-old company,

00:24:42.450 --> 00:24:44.940
I don't think we've made
any glaring mistakes.

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:46.865
And I'm sure I'll bite--

00:24:46.865 --> 00:24:50.750
eat those words
soon, but so far,

00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:52.370
we have a lot of smart people.

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.120
You know, we have a
lot of people that are

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.520
good at things I'm not good at.

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:00.300
I am pretty self-aware,
and I don't like to mess

00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.850
around with things
I'm not good at.

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:02.820
So if I'm not good
at something, I just

00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.840
hire somebody who's
better than me at it,

00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:06.390
and let them take
the reins on that.

00:25:06.390 --> 00:25:09.860
So I used to wear 74 hats.

00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.030
Then it was 30,
and then it was 12.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:16.470
And now I'm just steering
the big battleship.

00:25:16.470 --> 00:25:18.810
I've got a lot of people
doing really important things,

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:20.070
working side by side with me.

00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:21.820
AUDIENCE: Can I ask
you one more question?

00:25:21.820 --> 00:25:23.010
DANIEL LANIGAN: Sure.

00:25:23.010 --> 00:25:24.468
AUDIENCE: I think
you said that you

00:25:24.468 --> 00:25:25.718
started this when you were 26.

00:25:25.718 --> 00:25:27.717
DANIEL LANIGAN: I started
in the industry at 26.

00:25:27.717 --> 00:25:28.390
AUDIENCE: At 26.

00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:29.640
Yeah.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:32.100
And you didn't
graduate from college?

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.032
DANIEL LANIGAN: I did not.

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:36.570
AUDIENCE: What were you going
through between 20 and 26,

00:25:36.570 --> 00:25:38.652
and how did you--

00:25:38.652 --> 00:25:40.485
what kind of gave you
the inspiration that--

00:25:40.485 --> 00:25:40.800
I mean--

00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.591
DANIEL LANIGAN: Piles
of cocaine, you know?

00:25:42.591 --> 00:25:44.416
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:44.416 --> 00:25:45.540
AUDIENCE: This is recorded.

00:25:45.540 --> 00:25:46.698
You understand that?

00:25:46.698 --> 00:25:48.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:50.350
OK.

00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:52.560
What were you going through
physically on the table?

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.768
DANIEL LANIGAN: I understand.

00:25:53.768 --> 00:25:54.870
I understand.

00:25:54.870 --> 00:25:55.740
Literally piles.

00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:58.830 --> 00:26:00.730
From 20 to 20-- so I
dropped out of school.

00:26:00.730 --> 00:26:01.830
I went to Northeastern
for a year.

00:26:01.830 --> 00:26:02.955
I wasn't ready for college.

00:26:02.955 --> 00:26:03.660
I dropped out.

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:04.710
And I worked in Boston.

00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:05.430
I was a courier.

00:26:05.430 --> 00:26:07.140
I worked at cafes.

00:26:07.140 --> 00:26:10.350
And I was adamant
about traveling.

00:26:10.350 --> 00:26:12.560
And I'd had a day that
changed my life forever.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.600
I met Allen Ginsberg.

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.600
I went to a reading at
the Boston Public Library

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:18.390
when I was 19, and that changed
my life completely forever.

00:26:18.390 --> 00:26:19.894
And I was obsessed
with literature

00:26:19.894 --> 00:26:22.560
and reading and traveling, and I
got really into the beat stuff.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.020
And I ended up moving to Mexico.

00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:28.850
I lived in San Cristobal de
las Casas for eight months

00:26:28.850 --> 00:26:31.260
because I could afford to
live there and be an artist.

00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:33.080
I was writing and reading.

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.310
I was literally, like,
reading Shakespeare all day

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:39.100
and then going to the cafe,
and then drinking 17 beers,

00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.600
and then going back.

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:43.980
So I was mostly just traveling
and working to travel,

00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:45.320
traveling to work.

00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:47.910
Working 80 hours a week and
then saving up $3,000 grand.

00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:50.990
Then going off for six months
and staying in hostels,

00:26:50.990 --> 00:26:52.910
and that sort of thing.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:56.110
It was an incredible lifestyle.

00:26:56.110 --> 00:27:00.470
Every day was vibrant and
alive and euphoric and super

00:27:00.470 --> 00:27:03.260
exciting and optimistic.

00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:05.270
And I got really
freaked out that I

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:08.180
had no money and no income
and no skill set and no future

00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.300
and no one to pay for me.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:12.467
So I had to open a business.

00:27:12.467 --> 00:27:14.550
AUDIENCE: You mentioned
being relevant in Seattle.

00:27:14.550 --> 00:27:15.674
What about internationally?

00:27:15.674 --> 00:27:18.240
I feel like American beer is
probably the best in the world

00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:20.850
now, whereas like 20
years ago, it wasn't.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:24.060
But if I go to Europe now,
the beer's not as good.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:27.029
So are you thinking about sort
of international expansion?

00:27:27.029 --> 00:27:28.070
DANIEL LANIGAN: For sure.

00:27:28.070 --> 00:27:29.840
Why would I expand
in the US when

00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.347
there's three different
breweries opening a day?

00:27:32.347 --> 00:27:34.430
Why wouldn't I go somewhere
else where there's not

00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.060
a lot of competition?

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:39.380
So we're looking
squarely at Australia.

00:27:39.380 --> 00:27:41.630
I'm going to
Australia in January

00:27:41.630 --> 00:27:43.610
with the goal of doing
some significant vetting

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.510
and seeing if we can actually
physically open up a monster

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.015
facility there and try to
become the American craft

00:27:50.015 --> 00:27:51.290
brewery of Australia.

00:27:51.290 --> 00:27:53.600
It's English speaking and
there's 22 million people.

00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.150
They drink a lot
of beer per capita.

00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:57.890
They spend a lot
of money on beer.

00:27:57.890 --> 00:28:01.290
A six-pack of Brooklyn
lager in Australia is $38.

00:28:01.290 --> 00:28:04.549
So we're looking to ship beer
there as soon as possible.

00:28:04.549 --> 00:28:05.840
Get some testers in the market.

00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:07.660
And it's halfway
around the world,

00:28:07.660 --> 00:28:09.780
and it's expensive and
difficult logistically,

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:15.290
but it's an open terrain in a
way that the US market is not.

00:28:15.290 --> 00:28:17.745
AUDIENCE: I would imagine
that you are, especially

00:28:17.745 --> 00:28:19.370
with your business
model, you're really

00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:21.520
dependent on distributors.

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:26.480
And you know, alcohol
distributors in Massachusetts

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.370
are legendarily powerful.

00:28:28.370 --> 00:28:33.110
We hear a lot about pay to
play and all kinds of problems

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:34.850
people have had with them.

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:36.980
Now you're dealing
presumably with distributors

00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:39.590
in other states as well, so
you're getting, I would assume,

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:43.580
a really good perspective on
the whole distributor scene.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.770
I'm wondering what
you can tell us

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:48.380
in public here about the
challenges, shall we say,

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:50.960
of working with distributors.

00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.500
How do you do it?

00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:56.100
How do you get your space with
all the competition out there?

00:28:56.100 --> 00:28:59.272
What's it like to do that?

00:28:59.272 --> 00:29:00.980
DANIEL LANIGAN: That's
a loaded question.

00:29:00.980 --> 00:29:02.290
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:04.010
How much time do we have?

00:29:04.010 --> 00:29:08.270
Distributors are a necessary
part of the growth process.

00:29:08.270 --> 00:29:10.800
The partnerships are
really important to us.

00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:13.514
We do a tremendous amount
of vetting and research,

00:29:13.514 --> 00:29:14.930
and we have a lot
of other friends

00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.060
who own breweries who have
distributed it with those folks

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:17.750
previously.

00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:21.790
So it's pretty easy these
days to find a good one.

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:26.005
Or the best of the worst, if
you want to look at it that way.

00:29:26.005 --> 00:29:27.380
If you want to
make a whole bunch

00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.377
of bloodless money,
passionless money,

00:29:29.377 --> 00:29:30.460
you open up a distributor.

00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:31.640
It's great.

00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.079
You're just a glorified
delivery service,

00:29:35.079 --> 00:29:36.620
and the margins are
insane, you know?

00:29:36.620 --> 00:29:37.760
So good for them.

00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:41.175
And we have no
control over that.

00:29:41.175 --> 00:29:43.550
We have a few distributor
partners in the room right now.

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.050
And--

00:29:44.050 --> 00:29:45.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:49.300
Yeah, their faces went
white once I said that.

00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:51.060
And so they charge
a massive market,

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:53.240
but they also have a lot
of costs that we don't see.

00:29:53.240 --> 00:29:56.300
So they're a necessary
part of growth for sure

00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:58.460
for us especially,
because we don't

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:03.276
have the luxury of waiting
to build a unicorn that

00:30:03.276 --> 00:30:05.900
sort of bakes long enough where
people want to come to our door

00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.460
and wait all day for beer.

00:30:07.460 --> 00:30:09.380
So we need to grow,
and so we need

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.480
to make good decisions
about our partnerships.

00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.450
And we have great
partners, truly.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:17.000
We have some-- like I said,
some in the room right now.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.350
We

00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:21.860
Today was our ABP, which
is our Annual Budget

00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:25.820
Planning, I think, with our
distributor in New York State.

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.695
So we just beat each
other up for four hours,

00:30:27.695 --> 00:30:30.195
and now we're going to have a
beer, and we'll figure it out.

00:30:30.195 --> 00:30:31.370
And then we're like, hey.

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:32.120
Sell more beer.

00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:32.995
And they're like, no.

00:30:32.995 --> 00:30:34.345
No, you-- no, no.

00:30:34.345 --> 00:30:36.320
And then we fight about
margin and we fight

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.140
about spend and investment.

00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:41.784
And the end of the day, the
real problem ultimately-- you're

00:30:41.784 --> 00:30:43.200
talking about the
power struggle--

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:46.380
is that they have franchise
law in their favor.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.530
So in order for us to
leave them if we're

00:30:48.530 --> 00:30:51.770
dissatisfied with their
service, it's very prohibitive.

00:30:51.770 --> 00:30:54.750
And that's really the
crux of that issue.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:57.830
But as far as pay
to play and whatnot,

00:30:57.830 --> 00:31:00.260
I feel strongly that
if you make great beer,

00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:02.149
you're not going
to get replaced.

00:31:02.149 --> 00:31:04.190
The people that are
complaining about pay to play

00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:05.934
is because they
make shitty beer,

00:31:05.934 --> 00:31:07.850
and someone came in and
took their draft line,

00:31:07.850 --> 00:31:09.710
took their spot on the shelf.

00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.110
So if you do your
job right, like,

00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:13.950
we don't really worry
about anybody else.

00:31:13.950 --> 00:31:16.370
There's enough room in Mass
for all these breweries

00:31:16.370 --> 00:31:19.200
to triple in size and crush it
and for us to still do really

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:19.700
well.

00:31:22.970 --> 00:31:26.120
Craft brewing in general is
13% of the overall consumption

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:28.910
of domestic products in the
United States and only 17%

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:30.950
of dollars.

00:31:30.950 --> 00:31:34.370
We're 0.0001% of that 13%.

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:38.630
So for us to double, there's
enough room for 50 or 60

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.630
or 100 breweries of our size
to also double and to still

00:31:42.630 --> 00:31:45.310
crush it, because we're such
a small piece of the big pie.

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:48.880
So I don't get too
caught up in that stuff,

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:52.367
because we're just focusing
on doing our job really well,

00:31:52.367 --> 00:31:54.700
and we want to be the best
partner that that distributor

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:56.380
has, period.

00:31:56.380 --> 00:32:00.220
Our goal is, how do we get
Remarkable Liquids in New York

00:32:00.220 --> 00:32:05.020
State to love us 1%, 10%, 100%
more than they love anybody

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:06.310
else in their portfolio?

00:32:06.310 --> 00:32:07.459
That's our job.

00:32:07.459 --> 00:32:08.500
We want to be profitable.

00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:09.370
We want to be fresh.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:11.578
We want to say, when the
beer's available for pickup,

00:32:11.578 --> 00:32:12.880
it's actually there.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.250
These guys send trucks to
places, and it's like, oops.

00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:17.560
We're not ready for you.

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:18.680
Simple stuff like that.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.880
So our job is we take
care of our own house.

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:23.210
we're going to be just fine.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:27.790
AUDIENCE: So you attribute
a lot of your early growth

00:32:27.790 --> 00:32:32.760
or quick growth to
picking a larger floor

00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:37.780
space than a normal new
craft brewer might do.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:41.590
So then why did you choose
to do that in Boston

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:44.524
and not somewhere that
has much cheaper rent?

00:32:44.524 --> 00:32:45.940
DANIEL LANIGAN: I
didn't say I was

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.148
the smartest guy in the room.

00:32:47.148 --> 00:32:48.304
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:51.940
Because I have a lot of
Boston pride, and that's

00:32:51.940 --> 00:32:52.670
important to me.

00:32:52.670 --> 00:32:54.790
I think if it was
just a money play,

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.860
it was just a growth
play, we could have

00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:59.260
done this many other places.

00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:00.860
But our location is wonderful.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.070
We're right in the
corner of 93 and 95.

00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:07.100
It's the busiest intersection
of cars in all the Northeast.

00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:09.230
We have several hundred
thousand cars driving

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:11.170
within a mile of us every day.

00:33:11.170 --> 00:33:12.490
We have 100 parking spots.

00:33:12.490 --> 00:33:15.060
We had 50,000 square feet,
now 18,000 more square feet

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:16.120
across the street.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.930
So strategically, location-wise
for truck access and access

00:33:19.930 --> 00:33:23.660
to the city and a
talent pool also,

00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.890
like, we want to
pull smart people.

00:33:25.890 --> 00:33:27.700
You know, if I'm in
the middle of Vermont

00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.030
because I want cheap rent,
maybe the talent pool

00:33:30.030 --> 00:33:31.720
isn't as strong as it is here.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.430
There's a whole
bunch of factors,

00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:35.800
but mostly its proximity
to where I live.

00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:37.510
I live in the Seaport.

00:33:37.510 --> 00:33:38.710
I have a reverse commute.

00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:41.376
I drive north when everyone else
is going south, and vise versa.

00:33:41.376 --> 00:33:43.040
So I've grown to love Woburn.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.220
And I love our location,
and I love our building,

00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:47.690
and I wouldn't go anywhere else.

00:33:47.690 --> 00:33:49.180
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:51.430
AUDIENCE: So you've said how
there's so many breweries

00:33:51.430 --> 00:33:53.980
opening every day, and there's
so much room for all of you

00:33:53.980 --> 00:33:54.910
to expand.

00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:57.370
Do you think that's
a sustainable growth?

00:33:57.370 --> 00:33:59.170
And in your opinion,
like, where do you

00:33:59.170 --> 00:34:02.920
see the industry being
in, like, five, 10 years,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.582
given all this growth?

00:34:04.582 --> 00:34:06.040
DANIEL LANIGAN:
Well, the good news

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.810
is that there's a
sort of proliferation

00:34:07.810 --> 00:34:10.510
of people that like to put
good things in their body.

00:34:10.510 --> 00:34:12.219
You know, if you had
told me 25 years ago

00:34:12.219 --> 00:34:14.343
that Whole Foods would be
as big as Whole Foods is,

00:34:14.343 --> 00:34:15.679
I would have said you're crazy.

00:34:15.679 --> 00:34:17.739
But I sort of
equate craft moving

00:34:17.739 --> 00:34:19.710
to sort of the Whole
Foods movement.

00:34:19.710 --> 00:34:23.650
This is not a perfect
analogy, but there's

00:34:23.650 --> 00:34:26.010
plenty of room for lots
of people to succeed.

00:34:26.010 --> 00:34:28.820
As I said, we're only
13% of the volume.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:31.340
So 13 out of 100 beers chosen
every day in the United States

00:34:31.340 --> 00:34:34.330
is craft beer.

00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.987
If For us to get
to 20%, let's say,

00:34:37.987 --> 00:34:40.570
that would mean every one of the
6,000 breweries in the United

00:34:40.570 --> 00:34:45.679
States would have to grow by 50%
in one year just to get to 20%.

00:34:45.679 --> 00:34:49.840
So there's a lot of
negative articles written

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.928
about the bubble bursting
in the future of craft

00:34:51.928 --> 00:34:52.969
and it just slowing down.

00:34:52.969 --> 00:34:55.989
And I don't buy into that,
and I don't worry about that.

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:57.390
If we do our jobs right--

00:34:57.390 --> 00:34:59.020
you know, we're
selling a lifestyle.

00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.020
We're selling happiness.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:01.810
And we're not just selling beer.

00:35:01.810 --> 00:35:05.247
We're selling the idea that beer
is the most affordable luxury

00:35:05.247 --> 00:35:05.830
item on Earth.

00:35:05.830 --> 00:35:07.030
There's value in this.

00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:10.330
Spend the extra couple
bucks on that four-pack Stop

00:35:10.330 --> 00:35:13.180
being a cheap person and
enjoy the value of it.

00:35:13.180 --> 00:35:15.040
And you don't get hung
over the next day.

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.360
You feel better about yourself.

00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:20.360
You enjoy the experience
that much better.

00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:23.380
It's an incredible thing
that we have right now.

00:35:23.380 --> 00:35:26.500
And the difference in price
between the 13% of beer

00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.190
in the world and the other 83%--

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:30.010
I'm sorry, in the
United States--

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:32.030
is not a lot of dough.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:35.650
I mean, we're happy to spend
$5 on a latte whatever.

00:35:38.314 --> 00:35:40.580
I'd rather spend $5 on
a good beer, you know?

00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:43.995
But most of the people
in this room can do both.

00:35:43.995 --> 00:35:45.370
So I'm not
particularly concerned

00:35:45.370 --> 00:35:46.946
about the future of craft.

00:35:46.946 --> 00:35:48.820
I am concerned about--
there's a lot of folks

00:35:48.820 --> 00:35:50.030
who are really
passionate about beer,

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.880
they're passionate
about brewing,

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:53.129
but they're not necessarily
passionate about business.

00:35:53.129 --> 00:35:54.670
And that's probably
where things are

00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:58.090
going to get a little murky,
because a lot of breweries

00:35:58.090 --> 00:36:00.970
don't have the right team, the
right advisors, the right tax

00:36:00.970 --> 00:36:03.930
people, the right accountants,
the right attorneys.

00:36:03.930 --> 00:36:04.831
They have bad leases.

00:36:04.831 --> 00:36:06.580
They don't have good
financial advisement.

00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:08.746
They don't have good
relationships with their banks.

00:36:08.746 --> 00:36:12.379
Like, that's the
real important stuff.

00:36:12.379 --> 00:36:13.920
There's a lot of
good beer out there.

00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.670
There's a lot of
bad beer out there.

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:18.970
But there aren't a
lot of great teams.

00:36:18.970 --> 00:36:23.470
And that's more concern to
me than the proliferation

00:36:23.470 --> 00:36:26.050
of the number of breweries.

00:36:26.050 --> 00:36:29.470
I would say, though, if you
are planning a brewery now,

00:36:29.470 --> 00:36:30.565
you might be too late.

00:36:30.565 --> 00:36:31.905
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:31.905 --> 00:36:32.530
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:36:32.530 --> 00:36:34.037
Thank you.

00:36:34.037 --> 00:36:34.870
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:36.790
So it seems like
you didn't really

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:40.850
have much brewing experience
before you started the brewery.

00:36:40.850 --> 00:36:43.340
So like, how do you go
about making a beer?

00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:47.480
And especially if you don't have
experience, like, it seems--

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.720
I don't know.

00:36:48.720 --> 00:36:50.240
Was it the people
that you hired?

00:36:50.240 --> 00:36:53.180
Or how did you just go
about finding a recipe

00:36:53.180 --> 00:36:55.270
and starting a brewery?

00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:57.809
And in terms of the
brewing actual beer.

00:36:57.809 --> 00:37:00.350
DANIEL LANIGAN: Yeah, so I've
never brewed a beer in my life,

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:02.250
and now I never will, right?

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:03.920
It's too late.

00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.920
I literally have never
home brewed a beer.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.760
I have, I think, a
relatively advanced palate.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:12.487
I taste everything
really thoughtfully

00:37:12.487 --> 00:37:14.570
and have really passionately
for many, many years,

00:37:14.570 --> 00:37:15.694
and written a lot of notes.

00:37:15.694 --> 00:37:18.980
And I would say I have a
relatively advanced palate,

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:21.569
and that translates to wine
and food and coffee and all

00:37:21.569 --> 00:37:22.360
these other things.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:27.390
So I write the recipes a
little bit differently.

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:32.840
I described the end result and
I hired really talented people.

00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:34.640
I had a couple of
idiot savants who

00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.420
are just geniuses when
it comes to brewing beer.

00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:40.610
And we were able to sit
down and talk about,

00:37:40.610 --> 00:37:42.410
what do we want this beer to be?

00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:46.710
And here's the 84
qualities of this beer.

00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:49.340
And it's sort of the backwards
way that most breweries do it,

00:37:49.340 --> 00:37:53.160
but it's sort of
creating the challenge

00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.280
and giving them the
answers to the questions,

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.404
and letting them figure
out what the questions are.

00:37:57.404 --> 00:37:59.360
And that has been really
successful for us.

00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.810
It's been really rewarding to
sit down and write this stuff

00:38:02.810 --> 00:38:05.780
out and talk about it, and
two weeks later, have someone

00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.120
come to me and say, taste this.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.870
And to have 84% of it
be spot on and just

00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:14.240
have a couple of
tweaks to make, it's

00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:15.770
really a rewarding experience.

00:38:15.770 --> 00:38:17.450
But that's the way we do it.

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:19.340
I went to brewing school.

00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.590
I got whatever
certificate you get

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.340
for going to brewing school.

00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.680
But I never actually brewed.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:27.650
I have a general, basic idea
of the science behind it.

00:38:27.650 --> 00:38:30.020
But mostly, I'm just
talking about my vocabulary

00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.110
was in line with the
vocabulary of my brewers.

00:38:33.110 --> 00:38:36.110
AUDIENCE: How do you look at the
trade-offs of kind of scaling

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:37.880
distribution versus variety?

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:40.280
You said you only have,
like, four beers right now.

00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:43.580
There's a lot of other
kind of hot areas

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.010
that are growing
right now with sours

00:38:46.010 --> 00:38:49.010
and bourbon barrel-aged beers.

00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:50.720
So how do you look at that?

00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:51.560
DANIEL LANIGAN: Well, you
used the word growing.

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.580
I'm not sure if
that's totally true.

00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:56.070
But for us, it's been
out of necessity.

00:38:56.070 --> 00:38:57.440
So we have a big facility.

00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.350
We have a limited
number of tanks.

00:39:00.350 --> 00:39:02.030
And every time we
ordered more tanks

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:03.650
than we thought
we would need, we

00:39:03.650 --> 00:39:06.770
filled them with the same orders
from the same beers we had.

00:39:06.770 --> 00:39:11.720
So by design, we only have a
small amount of core beers,

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.610
but we would have liked to
have had a couple more by now.

00:39:14.610 --> 00:39:15.860
We just didn't have the tanks.

00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:18.380
So tanks take six
months to make.

00:39:18.380 --> 00:39:21.230
We were cash flow
constrained for a while.

00:39:21.230 --> 00:39:23.690
We're not anymore,
which is great.

00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:27.140
But we've never had a
night in our whole history

00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:29.790
where we had a tank
that was empty.

00:39:29.790 --> 00:39:31.640
We fill them up and
then we sell them.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:34.970
And I would love to have
two or three more products.

00:39:34.970 --> 00:39:36.925
Not 10 or 12, but two
or three more by now.

00:39:36.925 --> 00:39:39.050
We just physically haven't--
we've had to make that

00:39:39.050 --> 00:39:39.550
decision.

00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:44.810
Like, we can short somebody in
Florida for a truckload of Boom

00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:48.110
Sauce and then have a truckload
of another beer to then spread

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:50.140
out to our other territories.

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:52.870
Just didn't think that was
a good business decision.

00:39:52.870 --> 00:39:54.879
And it's also
seasonality, timing.

00:39:54.879 --> 00:39:56.670
There's a lot of factors
that go into that.

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:01.670
So ultimately, we're brewing
four new beers for 2018,

00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:07.260
and they'll broaden the
portfolio basically to eight.

00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:09.380
And then we have a
10-barrel system.

00:40:09.380 --> 00:40:12.350
So remember earlier I said that
we have a 40-barrel system,

00:40:12.350 --> 00:40:14.000
which is a monster.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.220
So it's not an
experimental system.

00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:19.610
It's just too much beer to
produce to be messing around

00:40:19.610 --> 00:40:20.180
with things.

00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:22.310
So we got a 10-barrel
system, which

00:40:22.310 --> 00:40:25.700
is for our taproom, which we're
expanding after Christmas.

00:40:25.700 --> 00:40:28.810
We're building a
300-seat beer hall.

00:40:28.810 --> 00:40:31.250
And the 10-barrel will produce
beers that are available

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:33.792
only in the taproom,
which'll give people

00:40:33.792 --> 00:40:35.000
more of a reason to go there.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.820
But that'll be sort of
our experimental system.

00:40:37.820 --> 00:40:39.600
So we have planned
for four more beers,

00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:41.580
and that'll bring us
to eight core beers.

00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:44.000
And then we'll have
sort of a rotational--

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.930
whatever of the five
or six or 10 beers

00:40:45.930 --> 00:40:48.460
we have in the taproom
that everyone loves,

00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.050
that'll help guide the
what's the next beer going

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:52.414
to be question.

00:40:52.414 --> 00:40:55.080
But we're never going to have 30
beers in the market or anything

00:40:55.080 --> 00:40:59.690
like that, probably
because for us to go big

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:05.210
when we launch a California
early next year, that's a very

00:41:05.210 --> 00:41:06.120
competitive market.

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.190
It's kind of insane to go there.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:09.470
But it would be more insane
if we went there and asked

00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:11.660
every store owner to clear
off these three shelves

00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.420
and give us 15 SKUs here.

00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:18.320
It's a lot more appropriate and
approachable if we say, look.

00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.790
We have four beers.

00:41:19.790 --> 00:41:21.530
I just need this much space.

00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:25.010
Surely you can get rid of
your dog in the building

00:41:25.010 --> 00:41:26.660
and put four SKUs on the shelf.

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:29.809
So again, it's a little
bit by design as well.

00:41:29.809 --> 00:41:30.350
Thanks, guys.

00:41:30.350 --> 00:41:35.200
