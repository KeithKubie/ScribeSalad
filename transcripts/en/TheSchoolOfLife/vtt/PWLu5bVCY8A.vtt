00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.670
It’s natural to imagine that the highest
virtue in love would be kindness and, a close

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.040
second, politeness. But there is an odd danger
lurking here: a relationship where we are

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.080
overly polite, where there is not enough directness,
where things go wrong not because of a lack

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.359
of tenderness or serenity but because of a
stifling excess of manners, because there

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.140
aren’t enough raised voices, insults, legitimate
furies and moments where both partners feel

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.039
free to call each other idiots and much worse.

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:39.539
When we hear arguments between lovers, perhaps
through a hotel bedroom wall, it is easy to

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.280
fear for them and their union.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.320
We have most of us been deeply and rightly sensitized to the horrors of abusive relationships.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:55.840
But there is, within reason, and we stress 
within reason with great seriousness, something extremely vital and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.640
redemptive that can unfold within the occasional
heated discussion. Living around someone is

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:09.140
bound to be, at points, extremely disappointing.
For love to remain vital, we need the freedom

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.630
to give this disappointment expression. It
seems we cannot love if love is all we are

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.400
allowed to do. Many of us have implicitly
been taught in childhood that disappointments

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.340
are best swallowed quietly. Perhaps a parent
was very fragile or they were very volatile,

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.330
so that we feared either annihilating them
or provoking them unbearably by giving vent

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:41.030
to our more honest feelings. We grew up polite
and good but also in danger of feeling inwardly

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:47.140
dead and convinced that no one could witness
us as we are and still love us. A certain

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.380
kind of politeness is the enemy of love. We
cannot love, or be properly in a relationship

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.910
that feels alive, and simply lock away too
many of our reservations. We need for love

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.300
to be first and foremost, real – and this
will involve giving expression to all kinds

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.629
of more ambivalent feelings. In most arenas
of life, mere politeness will do; there should

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:17.019
be little else around friends and colleagues.
But love needs something riskier: we have

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.849
to be able to say that we hate when we hate
– so that later we can properly love when

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.469
it’s time to love. This is why, in the interests
of the relationship, we might need to tell

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:32.110
the partner that they have ruined our life,
that they are selfish and infuriating and

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.569
that we have had more than enough – and
the partner, far from getting simply offended

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.900
(though that has its role too) should take
it, and read the explosion for what it is:

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:53.670
a homage to the trust and bond between us.
That a red faced accuser would never speak

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.129
like this to anyone else on earth should be
interpreted as the greatest privilege. They

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:58.160
don’t just hate you, though they do at the
moment, they have a lot of hope in you, and

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.659
a lot of faith that you love them enough to
take their reality – and when it’s blown

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:09.920
over, their love will be as sincere as their
anger once was. We should get angry when the

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:16.139
occasion fairly demands it; we, the overly
meak and cowed ones, should experience how

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:22.400
good and necessary it feels to dare to let
go and vent our annoyance and irritation without

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:28.310
the usual huge (and valuable) inhibitions.
We should not be overly scared of the odd

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:33.190
loud argument, we should form our irritations
into some beautifully creative insults; it

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.989
is not a sign that everything is coming to
an end and love has died, it’s a sign that

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:45.520
our relationship still has a lot of kindness,
sincerity and tolerance left within it.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:54.480
Love is a skill you can learn.  Our relationships book calmly guides us with calm and charm

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:04.080
through the key issues of relationships to ensure that success in love need not be a matter of luck.
