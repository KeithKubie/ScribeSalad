00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.240
Okay so we know that the absolute
value of -3 plus the absolute value

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.050
of -2 was equal to 5.

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:12.270
Now we have to remember to use the
original sign from our original problem,

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:16.810
which was -3 + -2 so
the original sign was negative.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:20.860
Since both numbers
shared a negative sign,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.080
we should put a negative in front of
what we got when we added the absolute

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.480
value of -3 to the absolute value of -2.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.567
So the answer here should be -5.

00:00:30.567 --> 00:00:35.203
So for these expressions, can you
use the absolute value method for

00:00:35.203 --> 00:00:37.120
adding integers?

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.000
Click yes or no.
