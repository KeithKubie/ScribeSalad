So in addition to conformity, another way in which people influence us is

00:00:04.041 --> 00:00:09.660
authority figures can sometimes get us to do what we may not even want to do.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.347
That is, obedience to authority. Now, in fact one of the most famous studies in

00:00:14.347 --> 00:00:19.695
all of psychology was on that topic, obedience to authority. And it was carried

00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:24.316
out in the 1960s. By the Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram. And

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:29.617
Milgram was driven to understand and ask the question. How is it that Germans

00:00:29.617 --> 00:00:35.602
can send so many innocent people to their deaths? Because the standard answer

00:00:35.602 --> 00:00:39.592
at the time was, well we were just following orders. So Milgram wanted to

00:00:39.592 --> 00:00:44.608
understand whether authority and obedience to authority could explain such a

00:00:44.608 --> 00:00:51.765
tragic event. So what do you think? Do you think obedience to authority could

00:00:51.765 --> 00:00:55.619
lead people to hurt or even kill people?
