some<00:00:37.230><c> will</c><00:00:37.410><c> not</c><00:00:37.590><c> and</c><00:00:37.920><c> people</c><00:00:38.520><c> started</c><00:00:38.850><c> asking</c>

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 align:start position:0%
some will not and people started asking
 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.819 align:start position:0%
some will not and people started asking
themselves<00:00:39.480><c> at</c><00:00:39.540><c> some</c><00:00:39.719><c> point</c><00:00:39.989><c> what</c><00:00:40.590><c> is</c><00:00:40.710><c> the</c>

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 align:start position:0%
themselves at some point what is the
 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.500 align:start position:0%
themselves at some point what is the
largest<00:00:41.190><c> sofa</c><00:00:41.700><c> you</c><00:00:41.820><c> can</c><00:00:42.000><c> move</c><00:00:42.149><c> around</c><00:00:42.329><c> the</c>

largest sofa you can move around the
 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.150 align:start position:0%
largest sofa you can move around the

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 align:start position:0%
longer store not long is not heavier
 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.130 align:start position:0%
longer store not long is not heavier
just<00:00:49.829><c> largest</c><00:00:50.399><c> area</c><00:00:50.760><c> okay</c><00:00:51.420><c> not</c><00:00:51.690><c> most</c>

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 align:start position:0%
just largest area okay not most
 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.319 align:start position:0%
just largest area okay not most
comfortable<00:00:52.620><c> so</c><00:00:53.039><c> here's</c><00:00:53.309><c> an</c><00:00:53.460><c> example</c><00:00:53.760><c> of</c><00:00:54.120><c> a</c>

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 align:start position:0%
comfortable so here's an example of a
 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.209 align:start position:0%
comfortable so here's an example of a
one<00:00:54.780><c> of</c><00:00:54.899><c> the</c><00:00:54.960><c> most</c><00:00:54.989><c> simple</c><00:00:55.530><c> sofas</c><00:00:55.949><c> you</c><00:00:55.980><c> can</c>

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 align:start position:0%
one of the most simple sofas you can
 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.250 align:start position:0%
one of the most simple sofas you can
imagine<00:00:56.370><c> so</c><00:00:57.149><c> it</c><00:00:57.239><c> has</c><00:00:57.360><c> a</c><00:00:57.390><c> semicircular</c><00:00:58.020><c> shape</c>

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 align:start position:0%
imagine so it has a semicircular shape
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.110 align:start position:0%
imagine so it has a semicircular shape
and<00:00:58.800><c> we</c><00:00:58.920><c> push</c><00:00:59.129><c> it</c><00:00:59.250><c> down</c><00:00:59.399><c> the</c><00:00:59.430><c> corridor</c><00:00:59.940><c> so</c>

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
and we push it down the corridor so
 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.729 align:start position:0%
and we push it down the corridor so
let's<00:01:00.300><c> see</c><00:01:00.390><c> what</c><00:01:00.510><c> happens</c><00:01:00.840><c> we</c><00:01:00.989><c> push</c><00:01:01.230><c> it</c><00:01:01.469><c> until</c>

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 align:start position:0%
let's see what happens we push it until
 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.579 align:start position:0%
let's see what happens we push it until
it<00:01:01.920><c> meets</c><00:01:02.760><c> the</c><00:01:03.000><c> opposite</c><00:01:03.420><c> wall</c><00:01:03.629><c> and</c><00:01:03.960><c> now</c><00:01:04.530><c> we</c>

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 align:start position:0%
it meets the opposite wall and now we
 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.469 align:start position:0%
it meets the opposite wall and now we
rotate<00:01:05.159><c> it</c><00:01:05.189><c> and</c><00:01:05.640><c> of</c><00:01:05.760><c> course</c><00:01:05.970><c> because</c><00:01:06.150><c> it's</c><00:01:06.420><c> a</c>

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 align:start position:0%
rotate it and of course because it's a
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.050 align:start position:0%
rotate it and of course because it's a
semicircle<00:01:07.110><c> it</c><00:01:07.229><c> can</c><00:01:07.439><c> rotate</c><00:01:07.619><c> just</c><00:01:08.610><c> perfectly</c>

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 align:start position:0%
semicircle it can rotate just perfectly
 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.390 align:start position:0%
semicircle it can rotate just perfectly
and<00:01:09.420><c> now</c><00:01:10.170><c> it's</c><00:01:10.350><c> in</c><00:01:10.619><c> the</c><00:01:10.710><c> other</c><00:01:10.799><c> corridor</c><00:01:11.250><c> so</c>

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 align:start position:0%
and now it's in the other corridor so
 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.039 align:start position:0%
and now it's in the other corridor so
you<00:01:11.490><c> can</c><00:01:11.670><c> push</c><00:01:11.850><c> it</c><00:01:11.970><c> forward</c><00:01:12.360><c> and</c><00:01:12.540><c> what's</c><00:01:12.930><c> the</c>

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 align:start position:0%
you can push it forward and what's the
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.690 align:start position:0%
you can push it forward and what's the
area<00:01:13.170><c> about</c><00:01:13.500><c> one</c><00:01:13.650><c> lacks</c><00:01:13.830><c> adequate</c><00:01:13.950><c> area</c><00:01:14.430><c> first</c>

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 align:start position:0%
for sure but it is what it is so the
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.020 align:start position:0%
for sure but it is what it is so the

next one that I have here looks like

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 align:start position:0%
this so it's still a fairly simple
 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.520 align:start position:0%

Moser let's first of all check that it
 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.749 align:start position:0%
Moser let's first of all check that it
works<00:01:55.409><c> and</c><00:01:55.619><c> then</c><00:01:55.770><c> I'll</c><00:01:55.890><c> explain</c><00:01:55.920><c> to</c><00:01:56.369><c> you</c><00:01:56.399><c> why</c>

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 align:start position:0%
works and then I'll explain to you why
 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.179 align:start position:0%
works and then I'll explain to you why
it<00:01:57.090><c> work</c><00:01:57.420><c> and</c><00:01:57.780><c> so</c><00:01:57.990><c> you</c><00:01:58.049><c> see</c><00:01:58.380><c> you</c><00:01:58.590><c> can</c><00:01:58.649><c> push</c><00:01:58.950><c> it</c>

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 align:start position:0%
it work and so you see you can push it
 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.039 align:start position:0%
it work and so you see you can push it
and<00:01:59.430><c> again</c><00:01:59.640><c> it</c><00:01:59.759><c> meets</c><00:01:59.909><c> the</c><00:02:00.060><c> wall</c><00:02:00.090><c> and</c><00:02:00.570><c> now</c><00:02:00.990><c> we</c>

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 align:start position:0%
and again it meets the wall and now we
 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.600 align:start position:0%
and again it meets the wall and now we
start<00:02:01.320><c> rotating</c><00:02:01.469><c> it</c><00:02:01.950><c> but</c><00:02:02.159><c> while</c><00:02:02.399><c> you're</c>

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 align:start position:0%
start rotating it but while you're
 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.999 align:start position:0%
start rotating it but while you're
rotating<00:02:02.759><c> it</c><00:02:03.119><c> you're</c><00:02:03.240><c> also</c><00:02:03.420><c> pushing</c><00:02:03.869><c> it</c><00:02:04.020><c> so</c>

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 align:start position:0%
rotating it you're also pushing it so
 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.630 align:start position:0%
rotating it you're also pushing it so
you're<00:02:05.219><c> doing</c><00:02:05.340><c> like</c><00:02:05.579><c> this</c><00:02:06.469><c> and</c><00:02:07.469><c> it</c><00:02:08.429><c> works</c>

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
you're doing like this and it works
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.900 align:start position:0%
you're doing like this and it works

00:04:18.409 --> 00:04:18.419 align:start position:0%

it's going to work equally well in the

a certain system of equations that I had

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.060 align:start position:0%
to solve and I solved it and that's
 

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:11.610 align:start position:0%
to solve and I solved it and that's

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:11.620 align:start position:0%
where the shape comes from and again it
 

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:13.769 align:start position:0%
where the shape comes from and again it

00:10:13.769 --> 00:10:13.779 align:start position:0%
turns out the shape is made of 18
