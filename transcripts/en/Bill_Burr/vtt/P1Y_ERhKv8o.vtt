00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.500
Hey,
what's going it's Bill Burr.
It's time for Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04.501 --> 00:00:07.280
Just before Friday.
Monday morning podcast at [inaudible].

3
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.980
Just checking in on you.

4
00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.220
How are you hanging with my wife on a rainy day and fucking Aaron.
Hey,

5
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.980
what's up?
Hi.
How are Ya?
Nia.

6
00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.750
There was a reason I brought you on this podcast.
And what does that reason?
Well,

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.020
Nia,
as you know,
I am a blowhard.
Yes.

8
00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.050
I talk and talk and talk and talk to the point that I fall asleep.

9
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.023
There you go.
I was waiting.

10
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.630
Um,
so I actually ran to a question the other day.
Believe it or not,

11
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.940
I'm walking on it.
Believe it or not,
right?

12
00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.960
Let's use it.
Ah,
walking on air.

13
00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:01.690
So I'm on sended me a fucking question.
I couldn't answer it.

14
00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.850
It blew my mind because even if I don't know the answer,

15
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.040
I still fucking talk to these people.
There you go.
All right,

16
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:12.910
well that's a great song.
Let me get that piece of fun.

17
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.380
Get a piece of fuzz off your Mike.

18
00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:17.950
This chairs are not as comfortable as they look.
Well,
they're made for men.

19
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:22.720
That's why these are men chairs.
I need an Ottoman.
These are anti beach.

20
00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.770
Okay.
All right.
But in England,
a man like you have,

21
00:01:26.771 --> 00:01:29.800
how come there's not a second Ottoman for this chair?
Because this is,

22
00:01:29.801 --> 00:01:33.340
this is a loaners.
You keep calling this a man cave.
It's not a man cave.

23
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.340
I don't call it a man cave.
All in a man cave.
It's my office.

24
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.760
I don't ever call it a man cave.
I never call it that.
Wow.

25
00:01:39.761 --> 00:01:41.260
Just like that on the podcast.
You're going to lie.

26
00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.340
<v 2>I've never said I was going.
You can go to your office.
That's what I want.</v>

27
00:01:45.341 --> 00:01:47.050
I'm vanishing from that.
Wow.

28
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.750
<v 0>What?
Nia.
I don't think that I called it a man cave.</v>

29
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.500
Oh,
now you're backing down from it yet.
I believe you called this gas lighting.

30
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.590
You're making me seem like I'm crazy.
Maybe I'm crazy.
Anyway,

31
00:01:58.591 --> 00:02:02.430
so this person had a question and it's a very delicate subject.
Near

32
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.930
alright.
Delicate like my feelings.
You know,
people's,

33
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.290
not much as I go on stage night after night and I tried to act like I'm this

34
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.930
tough person.
If you really took the time to know me,

35
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.850
<v 2>you'd know that it was volition.
It's true.</v>

36
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:23.970
Oh,
I'm just talk so much shit.
See,
this is the problem.
This is why people,
oh boy.

37
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.690
It's like,

38
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.860
people really think it's interesting to me how well your fans think they know

39
00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:33.750
you because you have this persona onstage and you're the angry guy and that's

40
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:35.640
certainly true.
Blue lemme tell Ya.

41
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.270
But you're also just so full of shit.

42
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.220
Like you just talk someone like you're all talk,
you just talk and talk and talk,

43
00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.140
but you're just full of shit because you are such a sensitive,

44
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.310
like giving like you know it's good shit.
Yeah.

45
00:02:53.311 --> 00:02:57.600
But it's annoying because it's like you're walking around like,
hey,
Yay,

46
00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.010
Yay.
You know like choking

47
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.020
<v 0>the fucking microphone stand like you do.</v>

48
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.530
Like it's weird to take the good with the bed.
People are like,
Oh God,

49
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.890
you guys went to Paris.
I met bill hated that.
And it's like,
no,

50
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:12.880
it's actually like his favorite city.
Oh Wow.
You guys went to the beach and all.

51
00:03:12.881 --> 00:03:16.570
I bet bill hated that.
No,
we actually had a good time.
Like,
it's just so weird.

52
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.230
There's like this disconnect with Pete and you please.
Duty Fan again.
Oh,
I bet.

53
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.560
I believe that that's what it is.
It's always like,
Oh God,
I bet bill hated that.

54
00:03:26.561 --> 00:03:30.640
And also it's like anytime I post any kind of picture on Instagram,

55
00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.160
all of your fans,
God love Ya,
but all of your fans are like,
oh,

56
00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.730
I bet bill.
You know,
they just will find something to bring you into it.

57
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.110
It'll be like a post to my feed.
Like,
oh,

58
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:45.190
Billy likes to no shoes or whatever the fuck it is.
It's like,
it's,
it's crazy.

59
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:49.900
What's wrong with that?
I mean,
nothing,
but it's just annoying.
Wow.

60
00:03:49.901 --> 00:03:53.200
All that Yellen,
that's all you had.
I know.
I remember.
I really don't like,

61
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.280
I was like,
she ran out of steam.
You're going to knock me out for lunch.
You know,

62
00:03:57.281 --> 00:04:01.540
it's rainy day.
I really wanted to go take a nap right now.
Dragged me up here.

63
00:04:01.541 --> 00:04:06.541
It didn't suck the I for two in that place.

64
00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.950
I know for two it's not bad.
Everything in there is good.

65
00:04:09.951 --> 00:04:12.780
I just never ordered the good stuff.
Yeah,
I tried it.

66
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.530
I decided to take a risk and it didn't quite pay off,

67
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.230
but it was still nice to have lunch with you.
I know.

68
00:04:18.231 --> 00:04:22.150
And then [inaudible] eating too much food.
I know.
No,
it must done.

69
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.680
But that we were eating the food and we realized we ordered too much,

70
00:04:24.681 --> 00:04:26.900
so we cancel one of the pizzas.
Right.
Then he'd go,

71
00:04:26.901 --> 00:04:30.920
which pizza do you want to cancel?
Yeah,
we should have canceled my pizza.
Yeah.

72
00:04:30.921 --> 00:04:33.970
And I didn't want to fucking offend you getting all fucking pizza.

73
00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.600
[inaudible] if I say abusing my a white male privilege by saying,

74
00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:41.060
let's just get the simple sausage one.
Yeah,

75
00:04:41.061 --> 00:04:44.490
you had to go with the fucking Wiener Schnitzel.
Whatever the hell you got it.

76
00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:47.690
Yeah.
Yeah.
That didn't quite pay off.
It was still good,

77
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:50.900
but it just wasn't satisfying,
I think is the word you're looking for.

78
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.140
Are you impressed how I've been getting up early and going to the gym?

79
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.040
Not really.
I mean,
you're still on European time,

80
00:04:57.041 --> 00:04:58.740
so it's actually not that impressive.

81
00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:04.840
Oh,
we'll be right back with searching for a compliment.

82
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.790
Am I impressed with you for being legs until jetlag?
No,

83
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.980
that's fun.
Present.
Maybe.

84
00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:19.120
You know why it has nothing to do with me being jet lagged because you snore

85
00:05:19.121 --> 00:05:22.900
like a fucking offensive lineman.
Here we go on the snoring thing.

86
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.880
I gotta tell you as you go through these periods,

87
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:26.380
you have such a cute little nose.
How does,

88
00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.040
I'll let noise noise come out of there because I'm sleeping hard and I'm

89
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:30.880
sleeping right.

90
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.020
I tell you that this thing that you're doing now where every fucking five

91
00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:41.620
minutes you're shaking me in the bed like that doesn't do anything.

92
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.500
Let's explain.
Wakes you up and you stop for a second.
Oh shoot.

93
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.440
She starts fucking storm
on this shit.

94
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.160
So what I do is I'm laying on my side away from our end and what I do is I just

95
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.390
started shaking the bed.

96
00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.140
I don't got it solved now and it wakes her up and she'd be like,
Huh,

97
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.910
what did I know?
The second you close your eyes.

98
00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:06.980
Yeah.
It doesn't stop me from snoring.
So I like,

99
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:10.370
what is the point of units I love really starting to Piss me off.

100
00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.180
Well I told you I will fucking,
I'll sleep somewhere else.
Okay.

101
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:20.670
All right.
But I've done that before and then after two nights you're like,
Yo,

102
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.760
Yo Yo,
welcome.
We with me.
Well,
so what are we supposed to do?

103
00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.570
I snore.
You wake up.
We don't want to sleep apart from each other.
Yes.

104
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.700
So what's the solution?
I'm ugly enough so I need as much beauty sleep.
I can get.

105
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:38.480
Don't say that.
But um,
but yeah,
um,
no,

106
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:42.680
I guess I could get one of those breathe right strips or something.
Like,
I dunno,

107
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:43.940
you're breathing wrong baby.

108
00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:48.170
Cause I never used to snore like that before the baby,
so I don't know.

109
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.420
I just think you're extra tired.

110
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.800
I'm skewed toward the way I imagined I snore after,
um,

111
00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:56.370
I drink like a third of bottle of fucking booze.

112
00:06:57.650 --> 00:07:01.100
You were snoring earlier in the night when you first fell asleep last night

113
00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:05.540
because I took that at times and I taking that to get myself back on and it's

114
00:07:05.541 --> 00:07:07.640
fucking work.
Great.
Okay.

115
00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.880
So I'm going,
I don't know.
I don't know what to tell you,

116
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.850
but I still love you,
right?
No,

117
00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:17.820
I know that I won't be passed out laying next to you anymore.

118
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:24.150
Just up shaking the bed.
It's like,
why?
What is,
it just doesn't work.
It works.

119
00:07:24.151 --> 00:07:27.680
A lot of times you roll over and know you stopped like 20 minutes,
but now,

120
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.660
now you're just like relentless.
She liked the fucking terminator is sleeping.

121
00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:33.600
Tell me,
I think I blew you up or some shit.

122
00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:35.820
You just fucking come back together again.
You start snorting.

123
00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:40.220
All right,
well I'm sorry.

124
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.183
<v 3>Right,</v>

125
00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:51.390
<v 0>so why am I,
oh my God.
Go ahead.
Why am I here?</v>

126
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:52.560
What'd you call me in here for?

127
00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:56.370
What is the cause you know what I made of New Year's resolution that I wasn't

128
00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.130
going to argue with you as much.
What's,
yeah,

129
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.430
you made a new year's resolution that you're not going to argue with me as much

130
00:08:02.431 --> 00:08:06.810
and it's been working,
so I need you to explain this.
What does that mean?

131
00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:11.100
I'm just going to agree with you.
Is that what you think that I want?

132
00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.120
Yes.
Jesus Christ.
It's like no winning.
There's no winning.

133
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:19.910
I like arguing with you as it worked.
I'll just agree with you.
All right.

134
00:08:20.240 --> 00:08:24.200
I'm not trying to like cut off like the balls of your opinion.

135
00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:29.980
I just need you to not be an asshole about that.
I don't know how to do that.

136
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.270
Oh really?
Yeah.
Come on.
I'm an asshole.
Yeah,
he married an asshole.
Yeah,

137
00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:37.750
but the what?
But that's kind of not fair on your side,

138
00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.020
which you married an asshole and now you want me to not be an asshole.

139
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.330
I didn't realize you were that big then that has

140
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:49.870
no,
I knew you were,
I know you weren't sure how you know what it is.

141
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:54.820
Cause I thought you were like a bad boy and then the bad boy turns into like a

142
00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:58.440
bad man then.
No,
but you're not a bad boy.
You're just like,

143
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.910
you're just grumpy.
And before I was like,
oh you're edgy.
Like he's edgy.

144
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:06.150
Like it doesn't take any shit man.
That's cause you're a casting director.

145
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:09.510
You put me in this box,
man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So good.

146
00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.220
He could play 28 to 35 he's edgy.
You weren't even looking at me like a person.

147
00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:18.330
No,
that's not true.
I thought you were amazing and you're really cool,

148
00:09:18.331 --> 00:09:22.710
but I just feel like as you've gotten older,
you've just become like so cranky.

149
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:26.430
Somebody was like,
oh,
bill is going to make the best like cranky old man.

150
00:09:26.431 --> 00:09:29.310
It's going to be hilarious.
And it's like,
yeah,
I have to live with that.

151
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:34.810
It's gotta be so hard.
It is so,
believe me.
Brave.

152
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:40.470
What am I going to call my memoir?
Surviving Bill Burger.
Yeah,
that's it.

153
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:44.640
Surviving Bill Burke becoming no,
it's just like I said,

154
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:48.720
it's annoying cause you're actually a very sweet person,
but everybody sees this,

155
00:09:49.110 --> 00:09:52.930
uh,
this angry jackass and that's what the people want.
They don't.
Yes,

156
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:54.810
they like me.
Believe it or not.

157
00:09:55.310 --> 00:10:00.030
There's people beyond the walls of this fucking relationship that actually liked

158
00:10:00.031 --> 00:10:02.580
me,
that Brandon,
they don't have to live with me.

159
00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:04.410
I know I'm difficult to live with.

160
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:07.350
I'm literally telling you I'm going to try to just fucking agree.

161
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.990
Whatever harebrained fucking idea you have,

162
00:10:09.991 --> 00:10:11.640
that's going to take up the whole fucking day.

163
00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:15.630
You want to go after the cocoa Moko woke us fucking thing all the way up to
five.

164
00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:20.280
Yeah.
Let's just play off football going on.
I'll tape it.

165
00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.980
You did not take my games while I was away.

166
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.770
I thought I'd take all your car dash in the horse.
Shit,

167
00:10:25.771 --> 00:10:28.380
whenever you're asking me to take Sebastian,

168
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:31.410
did you take Sebastian on the fucking news store?
You miss that toe?

169
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:34.580
I forgot cause I get caught up with the baby and shit and I forget.

170
00:10:34.581 --> 00:10:38.010
But I really thought that I taped all your games while you were gone because I

171
00:10:38.011 --> 00:10:40.590
sat there when I searched one,
the other two came up so I was like,

172
00:10:40.591 --> 00:10:42.060
oh great record record record.

173
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:45.810
Sebastian was on like the fucking NBC nightly news and he was walking around the

174
00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:48.900
comedy store talking about the history of place.
It's online bill.

175
00:10:48.901 --> 00:10:53.790
We can find it online,
but yes,
I did forget to Dvr it so I apologize for that.

176
00:10:54.690 --> 00:10:58.500
Yeah,
you're right.
You're right.
We'll,
we'll search for it online.

177
00:10:58.501 --> 00:11:01.440
Wait for somebody to put it online too.
We need to go to couples.

178
00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:06.780
Can we just work it all out in the podcast?
I'd love to go to couple's therapy.

179
00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:11.310
Would you?
Why?
Because I feel like if there was another person there going,
hey,

180
00:11:11.311 --> 00:11:15.750
you know,
maybe bill has a point.
I could win one once,
once,

181
00:11:15.751 --> 00:11:18.510
just one squads.
In fact,

182
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.830
to find a way for you to admit that baby,
I am right.

183
00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:28.770
I know I can be a fucking Douche.
You and a lot of them is the thing.

184
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.110
You just don't realize that you do.
Yeah,
that's,

185
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:35.490
that's probably the biggest mind fuck you've ever given me.

186
00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.640
You win a lot of them.
You just don't realize you do.

187
00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:42.090
So you're so good that even when I'm winning,
I feel like I lose.

188
00:11:42.510 --> 00:11:44.910
That's what you're telling me.
Wow.
I am amazing.

189
00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:52.290
That is an amazing skill.
I don't know if I'd be proud of it.
Fair enough.

190
00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.930
Fair enough.
Do you taking my lines?
I love it.
Fair enough.
Well,
you know what,
Nia,

191
00:11:55.931 --> 00:11:57.970
we went out to lunch today.
We,
we,
uh,

192
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.890
we did some other things that I'm not allowed to talk about yet because the,

193
00:12:01.891 --> 00:12:06.730
you know,
I have to wait until the official announcement comes about.
You know,

194
00:12:06.731 --> 00:12:08.440
I am,
I'll give you an idea.

195
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:12.770
There's something that's going on with me and it rhymes with ranch.
Sessioning

196
00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.040
hi.
And I fully support you.
Fully support 100%.

197
00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.280
We're going to try to make this relationship work is I ran position from a

198
00:12:27.161 --> 00:12:31.510
fucking Douche.
Ah,
no.
What have I loved you so much?

199
00:12:31.511 --> 00:12:34.960
I transitioned to a woman that enjoyed the Kardashians.

200
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:39.330
That's not what I want my life.
That's not what
[inaudible]

201
00:12:41.900 --> 00:12:46.890
Seth graph.
I think so.
Say it's so weird.
You know I watched that show but I,

202
00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:51.080
I hate them.
It's like,
so it's such a weird thing.
I am.

203
00:12:51.081 --> 00:12:54.670
I hate watching it.
Do you think?
I don't know.
I don't know what to do.

204
00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:58.370
I don't believe in hate watching.
I think that's so juvenile and like ridiculous.

205
00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.790
It's probably some sort of like this probably uh,
uh,

206
00:13:00.830 --> 00:13:03.350
you know [inaudible] at some point you'll be able to get in trouble with that on

207
00:13:03.351 --> 00:13:08.120
social media.
I'm sure.
Why you Renee Hill accused of hate watching?

208
00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:13.340
I don't recall.
Hate watching,
but if I did hate watch,

209
00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:16.100
I'd like to apologize to the producers at those shows.

210
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:20.450
I'm on my phone and I'm just kind of like in and out.

211
00:13:20.451 --> 00:13:22.250
Like I don't even really know what's going on,

212
00:13:22.251 --> 00:13:25.850
but it's just there and they're talking at me and I know I don't,

213
00:13:25.851 --> 00:13:28.700
I don't have a good explanation for it.
It is what it is.
No one knew.

214
00:13:28.701 --> 00:13:32.000
If you enjoy that show,
God damn it.
You Watch it.
Okay.

215
00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:34.640
And I'll show you other terrible reality shows.

216
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:37.800
So what's your top three terrible reality shows?
Uh,

217
00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:41.930

uh,

218
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:45.890
real housewives.
I don't mind Vanderpump rules,
you know?

219
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:51.320
Yeah.
Yeah.
You like those goods.
And I know it's just something like,
uh,

220
00:13:51.350 --> 00:13:52.190
I don't get what's,

221
00:13:52.191 --> 00:13:55.910
I don't understand how you get a job at a restaurant and your manager becomes

222
00:13:55.911 --> 00:14:00.080
your life coach.
There's just something hilarious about that to me.
Yeah.

223
00:14:00.510 --> 00:14:04.210
She's like the mother figure,
but it's just like a young [inaudible].

224
00:14:04.270 --> 00:14:07.490
I can tell she married,
she married,
she's been married for like the longest side.

225
00:14:08.030 --> 00:14:10.040
Kids of her own.
Her kids are grown up.
Okay.

226
00:14:10.070 --> 00:14:13.050
She owns these businesses and then she employs,
he's like young,

227
00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.450
beautiful fame whores and a deals while they're drama.

228
00:14:17.451 --> 00:14:19.070
So the skinny dude who cried

229
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:24.800
<v 4>[inaudible] Jane,
you're firing me.
Wait a minute.</v>

230
00:14:25.190 --> 00:14:28.860
You're firing me.
Wait a minute.

231
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:34.030

She did.
That kid's a mess.</v>

232
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:36.590
That kid's a mess.
I deserves to be fired.
Well,

233
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:41.500
he doesn't need to get his life together.
You firing me?
Yes,
I know.

234
00:14:42.250 --> 00:14:43.260
I don't even know what that happened.

235
00:14:43.770 --> 00:14:47.690
It just seemed like it was the longest I've ever seen somebody.

236
00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:51.530
He had no argument.
He just kept,
I don't know.
That's what it felt he was saying.

237
00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:56.390
Um,
so they let that guy go.
He's fired off the show for what?
Not off the show.

238
00:14:56.391 --> 00:14:57.650
He's still on the show.
He just,

239
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:02.240
because he gets really drunk and he says really nasty things to the people that

240
00:15:02.241 --> 00:15:06.500
work there,
namely the girls,
and he's always like,
you all fat,
whore,

241
00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:13.850
fucking hassle.
Oh,
that's fucking great.

242
00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:19.550
I love that guy.
So far you haven't.
Then the other guy,
Jack's right.

243
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:23.720
I was hoping he's going to get the job of the hockey club.
Yeah,
right.

244
00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.720
Here's the whole thing with all that.
He was going to tweet,

245
00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.820
he's going to do social media for like a minor league,

246
00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:33.140
Florida based hockey team.
So a bullshit job is that,

247
00:15:33.141 --> 00:15:35.360
that's a chocolate shop.
Wow.

248
00:15:35.450 --> 00:15:39.620
What kind of job is that to tweet for them and what way?
Got a game coming up.

00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:29.620
We need a cheese that begins with m or the Sullivan family has a chance to

274
00:17:29.991 --> 00:17:32.650
steal.
What do you got?

275
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:38.330
Um,
I've got one strike with a mild cheese.

276
00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.030
I honestly don't know any other cheeses.
I'd be going,

277
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:48.950

I do the Steve Harvey.

279
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:59.630
I asked you to name a cheese begins at m and you said Montebello.

280
00:18:00.091 --> 00:18:02.890
I got nothing.
Show me Montebello.
I got no,

281
00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:06.720
that's amazing that you could do that monsters all I had.

282
00:18:07.440 --> 00:18:10.440
That's why I married you because you know all the cheeses.

283
00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:17.430
[inaudible]

292
00:18:47.511 --> 00:18:51.350

293
00:18:51.351 --> 00:18:53.540

The fabric generally feels like actual heaven against your skin.

335
00:21:31.121 --> 00:21:34.990
This person was at a near death experience where God came down and tickled this

336
00:21:34.991 --> 00:21:38.230
little private slip.
Um,

337
00:21:38.231 --> 00:21:42.130
I need an underwear that feels like the hand of God welcoming my balls to the

338
00:21:42.131 --> 00:21:45.130

Skip a workout or to or brush our teeth with a tired old toothbrush.

396

We're not perfect,

And quip is a better electric toothbrush that can help.

I'm going to sleep well and work out and brush my teeth.

407
00:26:04.040 --> 00:26:08.390
75% of us use old,
worn out bristles that are ineffective.

408

414
00:26:30.561 --> 00:26:34.310

I mean,
you know,

415
00:26:34.311 --> 00:26:37.520

418
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:49.080

423

That's great.
You're funny.
You kill it.
Oh,

424
00:27:10.690 --> 00:27:15.000
it's girlfriend won't lose weight,

425
00:27:16.450 --> 00:27:19.140
dear Billy,
not so fat.
This is from the other day.
Okay.

426
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:24.540
It's a very delicate situation.
Uh,
yes,
I'm here.

427
00:27:24.570 --> 00:27:29.340
Okay.
My girlfriend and I have been dating for three years going on four and I'm

428
00:27:29.341 --> 00:27:33.180
starting to have different feelings towards her because of her eating habits and

429
00:27:33.181 --> 00:27:37.440
the way she takes care of herself.
Since I met her several years ago,

430
00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:38.460
she had,

431
00:27:38.460 --> 00:27:43.460
she kind of had a weight thing that was noticeable but didn't think anything of

432
00:27:43.471 --> 00:27:48.150
it because I thought she would get on some sort of kick of wanting to lose some

433
00:27:48.151 --> 00:27:50.400
weight in the years to come.
Uh,

434
00:27:50.401 --> 00:27:55.290
well it's been three and a half years and barely making a face over there.

435
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:55.741
Well,

436
00:27:55.741 --> 00:28:00.510
it's been three and a half years and there's no stopping her from losing weight,

437
00:28:00.540 --> 00:28:04.350
weight,
losing weight.
She's 25 and I'm 30 and I don't know what to do.

438
00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:07.170
She loves to see me gaining weight.

439
00:28:07.171 --> 00:28:11.700
She loves the sweets and is not a fan of running because it hurts her feet.

440
00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:13.050
Help Bill.
I love her,

441
00:28:13.051 --> 00:28:16.770
but I don't want to spend my early thirties miserable in a relationship with

442
00:28:16.771 --> 00:28:20.580
someone who doesn't want to take care of herself.
Thanks and go fuck yourself.

443
00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.110
Now,
what does he say to her?

444
00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.170
<v 2>First of all,
motherfucker,</v>

445
00:28:23.210 --> 00:28:28.210
you fell in love with her when she was a little thick and you were just like,

446
00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:29.991
oh,
so lose weight,

447
00:28:29.991 --> 00:28:33.890
but you still fell for her and now you're mad that the bits is gained weight.

448
00:28:34.130 --> 00:28:37.280
It's like she obviously likes to eat.
You knew that from jump.

449
00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:42.560
So why are you get an extra street on this one motherfucker from the jump

450
00:28:42.561 --> 00:28:47.540
because Shit's off.
Okay,
so,
so what's the problem?

451
00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:52.190
She won't she,
she just keeps gaining weight.
The bitch be getting fat and,

452
00:28:52.191 --> 00:28:55.490
all right.
P H.
A t.
All right.
My in it.
Am I in the club?
No,

453
00:28:55.550 --> 00:28:58.460
you're not in it for a second shot because it makes her feet.
Yeah.

454
00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:01.280
Jogging is terrible for your knees,
so you know,

455
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:04.910
not everybody fuck going to hurt your feet.

456
00:29:06.290 --> 00:29:10.520
Not everybody likes to jog.
There's other ways,
but I mean,
I don't know.

457
00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:12.060
Don't you think?

458
00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.820
<v 0>Okay,
I'll play devil's advocate here.
All right.</v>

459
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:19.230
You can't get what you get with somebody and you were at a particular way.

460
00:29:19.410 --> 00:29:22.320
You got to hover in that zone.
Yeah.
Okay.

461
00:29:22.550 --> 00:29:26.940
You can't get reality show fat on him for reality show.
I'm just saying it.

462
00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.890
Let me ask you this,
Nick.
At what point,

463
00:29:30.730 --> 00:29:34.410
remember how pasty I am?
Yeah.
All right.
Oh,
I remember

464
00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:38.770
stare at it every day.
My Ba,

465
00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:42.940
I just start looking like a fucking snowman and then suddenly my gut,

466
00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:43.830
when you don't want it,

467
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:47.560
gets it can't go out anymore and it starts to drop and it starts hanging over

468
00:29:47.561 --> 00:29:51.490
your fucking junk a little bit.
Well,
you know,

469
00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:55.960
I mean you can't tell me you're not going to be like going like,
hey,
uh hey,

470
00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.290
they're a Michelin man.
What are you doing over there in person to ask?

471
00:29:59.291 --> 00:30:02.680
Because I've never had a problem with a little extra on a guy.

472
00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:06.670
I haven't ever like thought it was like,
oh he's too fat for me or whatever.

473
00:30:06.671 --> 00:30:09.290
Like crazy obese.
Sure.
That's what I'm saying.
But I'm like,

474
00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.450
what's your name on the thicker side?
I don't mind a little thickness to a guy.

475
00:30:13.451 --> 00:30:15.100
I think it's got a nice,
he's not saying that.

476
00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:20.040
I think that's where she started and now on the thick side and now she was

477
00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:23.190
around,
she was a thickie that maybe he could have taken a couple of blue.
Well,

478
00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:23.470
you know,

479
00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.770
a couple of laps around the block and he's still got with her and he's been with

480
00:30:26.771 --> 00:30:30.010
her three years since like is she eating by herself?
Nia.

481
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.830
He looked at her the way men,
women look at men a lot of time.

482
00:30:32.831 --> 00:30:37.330
This is a fixer upper and then he bought the house and all of a sudden,

483
00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.400
well that's your problem.
I've,
I've always,

484
00:30:39.401 --> 00:30:41.830
I've said it before on this podcast and I'll say it again.

485
00:30:42.010 --> 00:30:45.150
You don't fall in love with potential.
It's a trap.
Alright,

486
00:30:45.220 --> 00:30:47.710
now can you help the guy out?
What am I supposed to say?

487
00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:50.770
Well he always see loves her.
How does he go?
Listen,
Tbi,
you know,

488
00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:55.960
can you fucking lay off the fucking strawberry shortcake here?
Ah,
well maybe,

489
00:30:56.050 --> 00:31:00.640
let's see.
What would I say?
A lead by example and be like,
you know what?

490
00:31:00.641 --> 00:31:03.970
I want to be healthy.
Like I want to cook healthy.
Like I want to exercise more.

491
00:31:03.971 --> 00:31:06.220
Like what do you think?
Do you want to do it with me?

492
00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:10.540
And that can be like a thing.
No,
that's how you doing.
I don't know.

493
00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:13.570
The way to do it is to say,
I think women are too smart.

494
00:31:13.571 --> 00:31:17.350
They'll see through you saying,
I'm fat.
Yeah,
that's true.
If I came up,
you say,

495
00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.900
Hey,
I've been thinking about eating some Brussels sprouts.

496
00:31:19.901 --> 00:31:22.150
You want eat some Brussels sprouts with me?
Yeah.
I'd be like,

497
00:31:22.151 --> 00:31:24.490
what the fuck is that supposed to mean?
Yeah.
He's saying,
I'm fat.

498
00:31:24.491 --> 00:31:27.640
You fucking bald red cunt.
That's what it would come out of your mouth.

499
00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:33.350
This guy obviously,
yeah.
Wants to be with this person,
right.
It's top.

500
00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:37.000
He'd see he writes it a little bit fun.
Funny.
Yeah,
but read that last part again.

501
00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:40.630
I love her,
but like say that again.
Read that last part.

502
00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:43.930
Okay.
I love her,

503
00:31:43.931 --> 00:31:47.230
but I don't want to spend my early thirties miserable in a relationship with

504
00:31:47.231 --> 00:31:49.600
someone who doesn't want to take care of herself.
Yeah.

505
00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:53.170
This is his fucking thing about people being fat fucks now and being proud of
it.

506
00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:58.420
It's like you're killing yourself.
You're gonna die.
You're gonna,
you're gonna.

507
00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:01.340
You're not a doctor.
You can't say that.
You don't know what,

508
00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:03.130
like how I am not a doctor,

509
00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.000
but I can say that and I just did and I can say that because that's like me

510
00:32:07.001 --> 00:32:09.790
saying that you smoking cigarettes,
you're going to get lung cancer.

511
00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.760
You're not a doctor.
I can't say that.
Oh yeah,
no,
of course.

512
00:32:12.761 --> 00:32:16.570
But like sometimes just the way your body looks doesn't determine your level of

513
00:32:16.571 --> 00:32:20.130
health.
Does she not work out at all?
That's what he's saying.
Hmm.

514
00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:24.310
She's sitting there and she's eating and she's getting fatter and fatter.

515
00:32:24.370 --> 00:32:27.070
That's not fair to the other person there.
I know,
but you know what?

516
00:32:27.071 --> 00:32:28.690
Sometimes it's not about the other person.

517
00:32:28.691 --> 00:32:29.980
Sometimes you're going through something.

518
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:32.440
Sometimes you just want to fuck a fucking two years.

519
00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:36.160
Sometimes you don't want to think about dieting and exercising all the time and

520
00:32:36.161 --> 00:32:40.310
being caught in that circle of constantly like,
I need to die.
I need to exercise.

521
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:44.390
<v 2>I need to die today.
I'd like
to learn how to eat well.</v>

522
00:32:44.460 --> 00:32:46.880
Maybe that's not something that she feels like doing right now.

523
00:32:46.881 --> 00:32:50.120
I feel like I'm talking about myself because I want to lose weight.

524
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:54.410
I'm trying to lose this baby weight,
but like I just sometimes I just don't want,

525
00:32:54.470 --> 00:32:56.930
this isn't about you.
It's about this person.
Yes.
Self centered.

526
00:32:57.170 --> 00:32:58.610
I feel like in demand

527
00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:04.700
because I don't feel like necessarily being on that goddamn hamster wheel.

528
00:33:04.970 --> 00:33:06.270
I want to go back to my trainer.

529
00:33:06.290 --> 00:33:09.680
Now that I have recovered from my hernia surgery,
I'm going to get back into it,

530
00:33:09.681 --> 00:33:13.730
but like to think about eating healthy all the time and exercising all the time.

531
00:33:13.731 --> 00:33:15.970
Like sometimes you just don't fucking want to,

532
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:20.030
<v 0>are you going to dump me?
Are you going to like kick me to the curb?</v>

533
00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:24.470
You do.
You realize how fucking insane you are right now.

534
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:28.160
This was literally about another woman and you're fucking yelling at me like I

535
00:33:28.161 --> 00:33:31.370
said it.
I'm trying to help this kid out so he can,

536
00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:35.090
he loves this woman and you know it.
It's a good thing to lose weight.

537
00:33:35.390 --> 00:33:36.770
It's not good for you.
Every five,

538
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:39.220
every pound of fat is a hundred miles of capillary.

539
00:33:39.221 --> 00:33:43.280
Somebody told me that one time.
So every time your heart beats.
Oh yes.

540
00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:48.890
I don't remember,
but
somebody told me no,

541
00:33:48.891 --> 00:33:51.650
but the thing is is you put that weight on this,
there's more mass.

542
00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.560
Your body has to grow more capillaries,
so cause that party would die.

543
00:33:54.561 --> 00:33:57.500
It needs oxygen.
Oxygenated blood.
I can't even say it right.

544
00:33:58.880 --> 00:34:03.810
Oxygenate oxygen.
That's a tough one.
Oxygenated.
Oh God,
we had a kid.
Ox.

545
00:34:04.580 --> 00:34:09.410
Wow.
Hopefully she'll be smarter than us.
Okay.
Yeah.

546
00:34:09.411 --> 00:34:12.560
You can't just say it has to grow that.
So then that's an extra like,
you know,

547
00:34:12.590 --> 00:34:15.020
it's like a paper route.
There's an extra five customers every day.

548
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:19.190
Nobody wants to be overweight.
Okay.
Everybody wants to be in shape.

549
00:34:19.191 --> 00:34:23.990
Everybody wants to look.
Can you,
can you remove yourself?
I can't.
It's crumbling.

550
00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:28.070
It's close to home.
It's,
it's hitting close to home.
Okay.
Fair enough.
All right.

551
00:34:28.071 --> 00:34:30.110
Well you know what buddy?
I tried you.
What would you do?

552
00:34:31.850 --> 00:34:36.850
I would buy a Ukulele and I would write a silly song about how she needs to get

553
00:34:37.821 --> 00:34:38.654
in shape

554
00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:44.900
and I would say that my Dick wrote it so they wouldn't be mad at me

555
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:53.360
seriously though.
I would tell him that.
Listen,
I never told this before.

556
00:34:57.850 --> 00:34:59.810
Uh,
no,
because when I go down on you now,

557
00:34:59.870 --> 00:35:04.490
I'm starting to get claustrophobic because I feel like the walls are closing in

558
00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:10.160
from both sides and from above,
and I just,
wow.

559
00:35:10.161 --> 00:35:14.810
I feel like it can't breathe.
Is there a way?
No,
I don't know what I would say.

560
00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:19.730
It's a tough one.
That's a tough one to answer.
So you're beautiful.

561
00:35:20.090 --> 00:35:23.780
I love you.
But if you don't hit the treadmill,

562
00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:27.200
I'm going to buy a human leash and start dragging around the block.

563
00:35:31.460 --> 00:35:35.780
I don't know.
Do you want to do this yoga class with me after work?

564
00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.820
We could do couple's
yoga together.
What?
I feel like you have to,

565
00:35:40.821 --> 00:35:42.230
if you're going to,
oh,
that's what you said.

566
00:35:42.231 --> 00:35:44.210
I think you asked me if I'm gonna go fucking Yoga class.

567
00:35:44.540 --> 00:35:48.170
We've been to yoga class together.
But you have to.
I think if you're,

568
00:35:48.171 --> 00:35:50.150
if you're really concerned about though,
seriously,

569
00:35:50.480 --> 00:35:53.270
you should suggest that you do stuff that's healthy together.

570
00:35:53.690 --> 00:35:56.340
Like let's cook meals together.
Let's go to yoga class.

571
00:35:56.341 --> 00:35:57.820
I actually think like that's,
that's,

572
00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:01.760
I feel like that's the nicest way to do it without making the person feel like

573
00:36:02.090 --> 00:36:06.380
you're singling them out or you know why I think she put on yourself say,
listen,

574
00:36:06.410 --> 00:36:09.010
I want to get into really good shape.
I feel like I'm,

575
00:36:09.011 --> 00:36:10.730
I'm not in the shape I want to be in.

576
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:13.320
<v 5>Uh,</v>

577
00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.310
<v 0>and I was,
you know,</v>

578
00:36:14.311 --> 00:36:17.520
when I used to be in better shape before I met you just make that shit up.

579
00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:20.490
Cause I used to go to the gym with a buddy of mine.

580
00:36:20.890 --> 00:36:24.450
Now she's going to see through all of this.
Yeah.
You gotta it's gotta be like,

581
00:36:24.451 --> 00:36:26.970
Hey,
you want to make dinner together?
Do you want to go to your other classes

582
00:36:26.990 --> 00:36:30.200
<v 5>together?
Just nice and easy.</v>

583
00:36:31.440 --> 00:36:34.350
<v 0>I am like the way you make me some healthy smoothies every morning.</v>

584
00:36:34.830 --> 00:36:36.240
Something like that.
Cause I appreciate it.

585
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.260
<v 5>Does healthy smoothies?
Okay,</v>

586
00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:42.200
<v 0>well you know what,
this,
this was a tough one.</v>

587
00:36:42.201 --> 00:36:46.010
That's one of the hardest ones that,
hey ladies,
any ladies out there,

588
00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:50.570
um,
right in,
and how can a guy,

589
00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:56.360
or how would you tell how,
yeah,
how can a man tell a woman,
you know,

590
00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:59.930
that he loves,
he wants to stay with her but she's putting on fucking weight,

591
00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:05.120
you know,
and it's,
he's,
he's helping her out near I know,

592
00:37:05.121 --> 00:37:08.390
but he didn't fall in love with like her body obviously.

593
00:37:08.391 --> 00:37:11.870
Like he fell in love with something else about her.
Yeah.
You can't say that.
Look,

594
00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:15.590
if you fell in love with the guy and then he puts on weight and he's his pot

595
00:37:15.591 --> 00:37:16.610
smoking fucking guy.

596
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:20.060
Where like to this ways that women can fall out of love with the guy that they

597
00:37:20.061 --> 00:37:23.810
fell in love with because he's letting himself go because he stopped going after

598
00:37:23.811 --> 00:37:26.160
it because he's partying too much.
There's all the same and,

599
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:28.880
and putting on weight is in that.
Okay.

600
00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:33.860
Like someone like to fall in love with someone and then a couple of years later

601
00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:36.520
are like literally twice the size that they are.
That's isn't that,

602
00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:39.130
that's selfish behavior,
but,
no,
but,
but,

603
00:37:39.131 --> 00:37:42.290
but the thing is I don't feel like it's necessarily selfish what else is going

604
00:37:42.291 --> 00:37:43.340
on in their life?

605
00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:47.630
Because maybe there's something that's leading to that extra eating or stress

606
00:37:47.631 --> 00:37:50.030
eating or whatever.
Maybe there's something else going on.

607
00:37:50.210 --> 00:37:53.870
Can anybody just be a lazy fuck and they just eaten fucking Sundays?

608
00:37:54.410 --> 00:37:57.700
Why does it always have to be like,
I get touched funny by my mailman.

609
00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:02.510
So now I use fucking Coco Crisp to be a good human being and seeing beyond the

610
00:38:02.511 --> 00:38:05.900
superficial and to see what's in someone's heart and mind.
You know what?

611
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:08.780
This probably right.
My thing is Iowa,
I bury everything.

612
00:38:08.781 --> 00:38:11.990
So I just get up like a fucking robot.
I mean,
it's working for me,

613
00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:16.670
but I understand.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I had,

614
00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:20.570
I had,
well,
you know what I accomplished?
I accomplished how difficult.

615
00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:25.340
This is such a difficult thing to talk about,
you know,
and uh,

616
00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:26.533
you know,

617
00:38:28.050 --> 00:38:28.883
<v 5>hmm.</v>

618
00:38:29.390 --> 00:38:31.360
<v 0>Bitches be getting fat.
I don't know what to tell you.</v>

619
00:38:34.090 --> 00:38:36.730
I'm joking.
I'm all right.
There you go.
Near.

620
00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:41.320
I think you look beautiful.
I've been trying to bang you for like a fucking,

621
00:38:41.380 --> 00:38:44.160
since I came back from Europe,
you know,

622
00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.350
we tried all my smooth lines,
you know,
like,

623
00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.820
can you do something about this over here?
Uh,

624
00:38:54.350 --> 00:38:56.120
I bought a little Atta boy over here.

625
00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:59.360
Even grabbing me in restaurants and things like that.
Yeah.

626
00:38:59.450 --> 00:39:03.500
Even manhandling me even coming up behind me in the kitchen,
that type of thing.

627
00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:08.400
Yup.
I'll give it to you.
Okay.
Then tell me a favor.
You know,
don't,

628
00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:13.010
don't put yourself out.
All right?
You know,
find it in your fucking heart.
Why?

629
00:39:13.011 --> 00:39:14.960
According to you,
I don't do anything.
I just,

630
00:39:14.961 --> 00:39:18.730
apparently I just lie there and just take it and don't participate.

631
00:39:19.250 --> 00:39:22.220
I believe you cue shit on me first.
What do you ma'am,

632
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:24.050
you criticize my performance first.

633
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:27.800
I got defensive and I say that you're a fucking animal in bed.

634
00:39:27.830 --> 00:39:30.470
I never said that you weren't.
All right.
Well there you go.
We'll stop back in.

635
00:39:30.471 --> 00:39:32.690
Like,
I'm not fucking doing something for you.
You are doing,

636
00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:34.780
you're doing a lot for me.
Don't laugh.
We right now have you.

637
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:41.730
Oh,
Nia.
You know something else.
You know what,

638
00:39:41.731 --> 00:39:44.190
you're not as complex as you like to act.
Okay.

639
00:39:44.730 --> 00:39:46.830
You don't think I'm running around in there,
but I'm in there.

640
00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:50.750
I'm between those years.
Wow.
Yeah.
Great comeback.

641
00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:57.030
That's it.
Alright.
Jerk face.
Uh,
thanks for hanging out with me.
Uh,

642
00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:00.620
this or having me.
Oh,
we got to bring up William Stephenson.
Oh,

643
00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:03.930
a sad thing here.
After all the laughs,
uh,

644
00:40:03.931 --> 00:40:07.190
another great comic and other great friends and just somebody who like I must've

645
00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:10.230
done,
I feel like I did a million shows with William Stephenson.

646
00:40:10.231 --> 00:40:14.250
Unfortunately he passed away.
Uh,
I believe it was on Monday of this week.

647
00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.500
And um,
I'm gonna miss that guy.
I just,
yeah,

648
00:40:18.850 --> 00:40:21.780
we used to have so many running jokes cause we always used to do late night

649
00:40:21.781 --> 00:40:26.781
shows in New York City and I remember that stupid Mcdonald's thing came up by

650
00:40:27.031 --> 00:40:27.864
that pop up.

651
00:40:28.230 --> 00:40:31.770
I'm loving it and we would just come in and every time we would sing something

652
00:40:31.771 --> 00:40:34.230
different by that Bup,
bup,
Ba,
I'm fucking it.

653
00:40:34.231 --> 00:40:37.140
Or just something stupid and it would just always make us laugh.

654
00:40:37.170 --> 00:40:40.950
We would always do it on like the third show when it was like half the fucking

655
00:40:40.951 --> 00:40:45.000
room was full.
And um,
you know what,
I got to find it.

656
00:40:45.001 --> 00:40:49.330
I have a great picture of me and him back when I had hair and Greg Geraldo.

657
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:54.510
Yeah.
Um,
it's probably sad photo.
I guess I'm next on that photo.
Jesus Christ.

658
00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:57.810
Jesus.
Well,
it's how it works in the Ed,
you know,
it's like a forest fire.
Okay.

659
00:40:58.020 --> 00:41:02.310
You burned down a redhead and all sudden some brunettes grow.
Um,

660
00:41:02.890 --> 00:41:06.460
all right,
so rest in peace.
William,
you're one of the greats and uh,

661
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:10.140
definitely gonna miss you and thank you to the comedy cellar and all those clubs

662
00:41:10.141 --> 00:41:12.930
that I got to work with them in.
Um,
he was just,

663
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:15.480
he was the best host and I used to host the shows.

664
00:41:15.481 --> 00:41:19.530
He was the fucking best and I never heard him say a bad word about anybody,
so,

665
00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:23.700
and he was a hell of a musician to play the piano.
I didn't know that.
Oh Man.

666
00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:27.840
You got to know him when he was a guest on tough crowd quite a few times.

667
00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:31.050
He used to do,
but I didn't know that he played music too.
Oh yeah.
He used,

668
00:41:31.110 --> 00:41:35.510
Jeff Ross used to go on stage with them and he would play this really cool,

669
00:41:35.511 --> 00:41:39.920
perfect accompaniment music when Jeff used to do his poems.

670
00:41:40.430 --> 00:41:44.060
Right,
right.
You know,
and he,
and we just,
it worked great.

671
00:41:44.061 --> 00:41:49.060
And they had so much fun together on stage,
which is I got to be,
honestly,

672
00:41:49.070 --> 00:41:53.960
when I was watching bumping Mike's with,
um,
with Jeff and Dave Attell,

673
00:41:53.961 --> 00:41:57.350
it reminded me of that and I got to tell you,
there's something about,

674
00:41:57.890 --> 00:42:00.430
I don't know,
there was something about that to comics going on stage,

675
00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:02.930
watching them have fun and you end up seeing,
they see like,

676
00:42:02.931 --> 00:42:06.230
I've never seen Dave like smile as much as that.
It's,
it's been great to watch.

677
00:42:06.231 --> 00:42:10.730
So anyways,
rest in peace.
Uh,
William Stephenson,
another great comic gone.

678
00:42:11.570 --> 00:42:14.540
Um,
so anyways,
that's,
that's the podcast.
You guys have a great weekend.

679
00:42:14.541 --> 00:42:15.280
Enjoy the music.
Yeah,

what's going on?
It's Belper and it's the Monday morning podcast for Monday,</v>

688
00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:35.030
January 17th,

689
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:39.980
2011 that I'm actually doing Tuesday morning,
Tuesday fucking morning.

690
00:43:39.981 --> 00:43:41.570
And I know why a lot of you think I am.

691
00:43:41.571 --> 00:43:46.571
You probably thought I was grieving for an extra 24 hours because the patriots

692
00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:50.480
lost to the fucking hated green current jets.

693
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:57.410
Um,
actually no,
I was in Atlantic city.
I was in Atlantic City and uh,

694
00:43:57.560 --> 00:44:01.490
you know,
I didn't bring the podcast all the fucking equipment back.

695
00:44:02.630 --> 00:44:04.850
I came into New York on fucking Tuesday.

696
00:44:04.851 --> 00:44:08.080
I didn't want to be lugging that shit around and then lug it down there and uh,

697
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:12.470
like an asshole.
I didn't realize I had a six o'clock in the evening flight.
Um,

698
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:15.950
I'm kind of famous for that.
I never know when my flights leave.
I'm always like,

699
00:44:16.330 --> 00:44:16.331
Yay,

700
00:44:16.331 --> 00:44:21.020
I think I leave around 10:00 AM and then I find out it's 6:00 AM as I'm sitting

701
00:44:21.021 --> 00:44:23.930
at a bar drinking at three in the morning.
And then I go,
oh fuck.
Well,

702
00:44:23.931 --> 00:44:28.760
there's no reason to go to bed now.
Is there,
um,
any ways.
So let's,
uh,

703
00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:33.030
let's get down to brass fucking tax here.
Uh,

704
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:36.180
this is going to kill me.
Um,

705
00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:40.050
out of all the podcasts that I've done for the last,

706
00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:43.620
I'm just loving how excited the jets fans are right now.

707
00:44:43.621 --> 00:44:46.610
I know this sitting there with their fucking ear cups right up to the Goddamn

708
00:44:46.620 --> 00:44:50.670
speaker.
Probably giving their fucking boss the finger.
Fuck you motherfucker.

709
00:44:50.790 --> 00:44:52.290
I was waiting all season for this.

710
00:44:52.380 --> 00:44:57.210
There's a big fucking crow laying on his plate and I'm going to watch your meet

711
00:44:57.211 --> 00:45:01.980
every Goddamn fucking bite and the feathers.
Um,

712
00:45:02.910 --> 00:45:06.270
yeah.
Out of all the podcasts I've had to do,
this is,

713
00:45:06.330 --> 00:45:08.520
this is going to be one of the toughest ones,

714
00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.470
toughest things I've ever going to have to say.

715
00:45:10.471 --> 00:45:15.420
Congratulations to the New York jets,
their organization of their fans.

716
00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.780
You fucking deserved it.
You went up there,
you were talking shit,

717
00:45:18.840 --> 00:45:23.520
and you're fucking won the game.
And,
uh,
and that's,
that's it.

718
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:27.300
You won it.
You won the fucking game.
And,
uh,

719
00:45:28.440 --> 00:45:32.910
this is what I think happened,
uh,
during the game.

720
00:45:32.911 --> 00:45:34.800
I thought both teams came out.

721
00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.550
There was so much fucking hype before that game.

722
00:45:39.450 --> 00:45:44.330
And uh,
I as always was nervous.
A nervous Nelly all week,
you know,
is from my,

723
00:45:44.331 --> 00:45:46.740
as much shit as I talk about the Jetson Shit.

724
00:45:46.741 --> 00:45:48.210
If you notice when they play the Patriots,

725
00:45:48.240 --> 00:45:50.670
I never claimed that we're going to win.
Remember that?

726
00:45:50.700 --> 00:45:54.140
Remember when the 45 to three game,
remember that before and I was going,
eh,

727
00:45:54.330 --> 00:45:59.010
got a bed.
I got a bad feeling,
man.
That's from being a Boston sports fan,

728
00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:04.110
pre winning championships.
I just always,
I'm a,
I'm,
I'm waiting for the misery.
Um,

729
00:46:05.550 --> 00:46:08.400
and I was getting into,
and this is another thing that I didn't like,

730
00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:12.180
I didn't like that everyone was saying the Patriots were going to win.

731
00:46:12.210 --> 00:46:17.100
And everyone was saying that I got to the airport,
you know,

732
00:46:17.101 --> 00:46:20.590
this is me going in New York.
You go to the airport patriots,
uh,

733
00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:24.060
or on the cover of sports illustrated.
And I know people go,
oh,

734
00:46:24.090 --> 00:46:28.590
the fucking Jake's,
you know,
the sports illustrated jinx.

735
00:46:28.591 --> 00:46:31.440
You ever think that maybe they just don't know how to pick a winner.

736
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:36.090
You ever think maybe that maybe that's their fucking problem.
Um,

737
00:46:37.230 --> 00:46:40.530
I saw that and then I was watching a little bit.

738
00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:44.070
Espn you only thing I liked was the jets were talking shit.
And I was like,

739
00:46:44.071 --> 00:46:47.070
I hope they keep doing this,
just keep doing this.

740
00:46:47.071 --> 00:46:50.850
And I hope they get off the plane wearing fatigues like the fucking Miami

741
00:46:50.851 --> 00:46:55.380
hurricanes.
Um,
that's what I was hoping.
But uh,

742
00:46:55.381 --> 00:47:00.000
I was talking to Versie my gambling buddy and he was putting money on the

743
00:47:00.001 --> 00:47:04.920
Patriots and when he saw,
uh,
when rex Ryan said,

744
00:47:04.921 --> 00:47:07.020
you know,
it's going to be me,
verse Belicheck,

745
00:47:07.230 --> 00:47:11.160
he texted me and was going through it.
It's over.
It's over.
Why would he do that?

746
00:47:11.161 --> 00:47:15.120
That's the dumbest fucking thing to say.
But Baba Baba,
Baba and a,
I don't know,

747
00:47:15.121 --> 00:47:18.810
you guys won't believe me if I tell you the whole week I was going look to our

748
00:47:18.811 --> 00:47:23.811
defense and I've been saying that all fucking year and he's gone now.

749
00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.270
Yeah.
Again,
it's just like the giants when the giants went on their fucking run.

750
00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:32.290
No,
it isn't.
It isn't.
And then he said something else.
He goes,
well,
don't worry.

751
00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:36.460
I go do we let up like 24 to 26 points of fucking game for two thirds of the

752
00:47:36.461 --> 00:47:40.900
season.
We start in four fucking rookies.
And he goes,
yeah,
but dude,

753
00:47:41.410 --> 00:47:46.290
don't you score like 35 points a game and that that's when my fucking by heart

754
00:47:46.570 --> 00:47:48.820
sank into my stomach.
And I was like wow.

755
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:51.670
He just described Dan Marino's career.

756
00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:56.250
How are we going to win the Superbowl?
We don't have a defense.
Adot worry.

757
00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:00.850
We got Marino.
Hey Daddy,
why don't you go out and score 40 today?

758
00:48:00.910 --> 00:48:04.330
That only works in the regular season.
So

759
00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:08.800
I was like,
look,
all they got to do,

760
00:48:08.801 --> 00:48:11.980
if they establish the rod we're fucked because they're going to chew up the

761
00:48:11.981 --> 00:48:14.590
clock and then Brady is not going to be on the field.

762
00:48:14.620 --> 00:48:18.130
He can't hurt you if he's not in the field.
So that's what I was worried about.

763
00:48:18.850 --> 00:48:23.290
I was hoping we were going to rate the jets but I was worried that if they got

764
00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:27.100
their running game going,
if lt started fucking running,

765
00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.040
we were going to be in trouble.
Okay.

766
00:48:30.760 --> 00:48:33.100
Cause I didn't buy into the fucking hype where it's like,
wow,

767
00:48:33.250 --> 00:48:37.870
this is what we did the last time.
Yeah.
But the time before we lost,
all right,

768
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:43.570
central,
we lost 28 to 14,
five fucking years ago.
We lost like four months ago.

769
00:48:44.380 --> 00:48:47.890
So I just is what,
and this is honestly my heart of hearts.
What I think happened,

770
00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:51.430
the Patriots came out and they picked up right where they let off.

771
00:48:52.330 --> 00:48:55.870
And then Brady threw arguably the worst pass of his career.

772
00:48:57.340 --> 00:49:01.750
And I think the Patriots just got spooked.
They got,

773
00:49:01.751 --> 00:49:06.730
they was stunned and then the jet got run the ball down right down to like what?

774
00:49:06.731 --> 00:49:10.960
Like the 12 yard line.
And then they came out like the fucking keystone cops.

775
00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:13.120
That first series.

776
00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:17.290
Sanchez goes to hand off the ball and he trips is fucking running back.

777
00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:19.770
Then they ran a a fucking,
uh,

778
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:23.050
I block so much of this game up because of the pain of watching the Patriots

779
00:49:23.051 --> 00:49:26.770
lose,
but some sort of sweep and whoever was running it,

780
00:49:26.771 --> 00:49:30.220
fake somebody out and then bumped into his own Lyman and then they missed the

781
00:49:30.221 --> 00:49:35.020
field goal.
And I was like,
all right,
the jets are tight,
the jets are tight,

782
00:49:35.410 --> 00:49:39.340
they're fucking nervous.
And then the patriots.
Kay.
And I really think though,

783
00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:43.150
because Brady had not fucked up since October,

784
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:47.590
I think because of the hype of the game,
they were like,
oh fuck,

785
00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:50.260
not now,
not to this team.

786
00:49:50.290 --> 00:49:53.710
And for the rest of the game they were pressing and they went right down on the

787
00:49:53.711 --> 00:49:58.480
fucking field.
He throws a touchdown pass in,
the guy drops it,

788
00:49:59.590 --> 00:50:03.700
they get a field goal and then I just feel like the rest of the game they were

789
00:50:03.701 --> 00:50:07.480
playing in panic mode.
Like they were up three to nothing and they were playing.

790
00:50:08.570 --> 00:50:12.790
Well,
our defense sucks that they just,
it sucks.
Um,

791
00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:15.670
but like the offense would come out and then the jets went up seven to three and

792
00:50:15.671 --> 00:50:19.240
the patriots come out like they're down 28 to three.

793
00:50:19.240 --> 00:50:21.100
I just felt they never got into the rhythm.

794
00:50:21.101 --> 00:50:25.630
A lot of it was because of the jets had a monster fucking,
uh,
pass rush.

795
00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:30.610
But I just,
I just was like,
you know,
they,
they,

796
00:50:30.611 --> 00:50:33.980
they fucking call the fake punt UK foot.
She dropped a touchdown pass.

797
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:35.660
You dropped the fake punt,

798
00:50:36.530 --> 00:50:41.040
you throw a first down to Deon branch and he fucking drops it.
It was like they,

799
00:50:41.041 --> 00:50:43.690
they would just,
I just don't think they up.

800
00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:48.290
They needed to go down on that first drive in score a touchdown in.

801
00:50:48.291 --> 00:50:53.291
The last thing they needed was Brady to throw a pic and they just never got go.

802
00:50:53.361 --> 00:50:56.570
We got going for half a second when we scored that touchdown and had the two

803
00:50:56.571 --> 00:51:01.571
point conversion and it was 14 to 11 and then,

804
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:07.370
uh,
then we had the momentum.
We are great.

805
00:51:07.371 --> 00:51:10.700
And we fucking nailed the guy on the kickoff.
And I'm like,
okay,

806
00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:15.830
our defense has to pull one out of their ass here and fucking Clampton down and

807
00:51:15.831 --> 00:51:17.240
we have to get the ball back.

808
00:51:17.300 --> 00:51:22.300
And it was a moment in the fee that was the moment in the game and fucking Mark

809
00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:30.980
Trent Dilfer Sanchez throws a fucking eight yard pass that turns into a 70 yard

810
00:51:30.981 --> 00:51:35.870
fucking game.
And that,
that for me,
that was fucking,
that was it.

811
00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:40.460
That was it.
Even though we scored that touchdown in the end.
Uh,
it just,

812
00:51:40.461 --> 00:51:43.460
it just wasn't our fucking day.
Even we do onside kicks in,

813
00:51:43.461 --> 00:51:47.510
the fucking ball seemed to be laying there for x eight seconds and we were

814
00:51:47.511 --> 00:51:51.680
running around.
Where is it?
I don't see a jet with it.
I can't find it.

815
00:51:53.270 --> 00:51:57.310
Um,
anyways,
but congratulations to the jets,
man.
You know,

816
00:51:57.500 --> 00:51:58.430
you gotta hand it to them,
do it.

817
00:51:58.431 --> 00:52:02.810
They talked shit and they came in and they fucking want,
but I gotta be honest.

818
00:52:02.810 --> 00:52:07.010
It wasn't as amazing is everybody's making it out to be the same way.

819
00:52:07.011 --> 00:52:11.930
The Patriots are not as amazing as they were made out to be going into this

820
00:52:11.931 --> 00:52:16.580
fucking game.
And it's why I don't watch ESPN and I don't,

821
00:52:17.300 --> 00:52:18.650
uh,
I watched the gay,

822
00:52:18.651 --> 00:52:23.180
I had the game on mute because I knew the game was going to take seven years off

823
00:52:23.181 --> 00:52:27.440
my life unless it went like that 45 to three game,
which to be honest,
jet fans,

824
00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:31.010
I was still nervous when we were up like 28 to nothing.

825
00:52:31.880 --> 00:52:36.440
That's how bad our fucking difference was on that game.
But like,
I don't,

826
00:52:36.441 --> 00:52:39.800
I don't,
I don't know,
I guess because they're trying to get ratings,

827
00:52:39.801 --> 00:52:43.820
but I don't get how you go one and one during the regular season and then

828
00:52:43.821 --> 00:52:47.870
whatever you did the last time,
you try to act like that's who the fuck you are.

829
00:52:47.870 --> 00:52:51.080
And that's who the other guy is.
Or like the jets,
like there's nothing to,

830
00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:55.160
I've got to let emails from,
from jet fans.
This one guy goes,
the dynasty is over.

831
00:52:56.210 --> 00:52:58.790
And um,
it's like,
dude,

832
00:52:58.791 --> 00:53:02.290
we haven't won a Superbowl since 2004.

833
00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:04.100
It's been over for seven fucking years.

834
00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:08.370
The dynasty ended when Teddy Bruschi had that,

835
00:53:08.371 --> 00:53:12.710
that fucking mild stroke or seizure or whatever he had.
That was the end of it.

836
00:53:12.830 --> 00:53:17.030
And then we,
you know,
we lost a few guys.
We were never quite the same.

837
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:20.120
But the thing is that's been the same has been Belichick and Brady.

838
00:53:20.121 --> 00:53:23.840
So people are acting like they're beating the Superbowl team.

839
00:53:23.841 --> 00:53:26.880
This is the team that got by the Ravens last year,

840
00:53:26.881 --> 00:53:30.660
first round of the fucking playoffs.
And uh,

841
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:36.270
you know,
so I don't know.
So whatever,
congratulations.

842
00:53:36.271 --> 00:53:40.320
I still have yet to be proven wrong about the jet Stowe.
Okay.

843
00:53:41.010 --> 00:53:43.800
If you guys remember,
because people forget what I said.

844
00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:47.010
They said they were going to win the fucking super bowl and they talked all this

845
00:53:47.011 --> 00:53:47.670
fucking shit.

846
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:51.660
All they have achieved at this point is getting back to the game that they lost

847
00:53:51.661 --> 00:53:55.740
last year.
So,
uh,
but you know,
whatever my teams out of it,

848
00:53:55.741 --> 00:53:58.470
so I'm done being a cunt.
So whatever good luck jet fans,

849
00:53:58.550 --> 00:54:01.680
you've got a 42 year monkey on your back.
Uh,

850
00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:06.180
I know what that's like times two plus fucking,
uh,
four years,

851
00:54:07.080 --> 00:54:11.460
two years,
whatever it was,
86,
86 fucking years.
So,
uh,
good luck to you.

852
00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.840
This is the thing,
I this,
let me give you the backstory.

853
00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:18.920
I was watching this game by myself at the Borgata in Atlantic city,

854
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:26.050
um,
by myself with the mute on,

855
00:54:26.890 --> 00:54:29.620
on the game because I can't,
when games are that big,

856
00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:33.280
I can handle any sort of comment that I consider more ironic.

857
00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:36.760
Cause at one point Deon branch caught a ball and he was all amped up and he was

858
00:54:36.761 --> 00:54:41.761
yelling over the jet sidelines and I on hit mute and I hear Phil sims going Deon

859
00:54:41.831 --> 00:54:46.780
branch and he's yelling at Rex Ryan.
I don't know why he'd be doing that.

860
00:54:47.020 --> 00:54:48.790
Yeah,
why would he,
why would he,

861
00:54:49.180 --> 00:54:53.710
why would he yell at that guy who's been talking shit saying that the Brady,

862
00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:54.341
the Brady,

863
00:54:54.341 --> 00:54:57.880
that the Patriots are in a good team and people on their team of call and Brady

864
00:54:57.881 --> 00:55:01.270
and asshole.
Yeah.
Why do you think there would be some sort of chat or Phil Sims?

865
00:55:01.630 --> 00:55:05.950
Did you play your entire career with the Bose headphones on?

866
00:55:06.250 --> 00:55:09.490
You fucking ah,
drove me nuts.
So I had fucking hit mute.

867
00:55:10.570 --> 00:55:12.550
I had to hit mute and uh,

868
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:14.463
<v 8>yeah.</v>

869
00:55:14.660 --> 00:55:17.990
<v 7>Ugh.
It was fucking brutal.
And I was,</v>

870
00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.540
and I texted Versie at halftime.

871
00:55:20.570 --> 00:55:25.430
This was another turning point at halftime.
Okay.
First of all,
what the fuck?

872
00:55:25.460 --> 00:55:28.310
We gave the Goddamn jets,
the ball on our own,

873
00:55:28.311 --> 00:55:32.960
48 or 30 yard line four fucking times.
And the first half,

874
00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:37.310
the fact that we weren't down like 28 to three at the half was a minor miracle

875
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:41.480
and the defense actually was stepping up in that half.

876
00:55:41.481 --> 00:55:43.460
But you know,

877
00:55:43.490 --> 00:55:46.260
I knew it was going to come down to the fucking defense because I know a lot of

878
00:55:46.310 --> 00:55:48.260
Patriot fans think it was the fucking offense.

879
00:55:48.261 --> 00:55:53.261
But the offense is entitled to have a bad day to struggle every once in a

880
00:55:53.271 --> 00:55:57.470
fucking blue moon.
Okay.
That's when the defense has to step it up.

881
00:55:57.471 --> 00:56:00.590
And we just did not have a defense that could do that.
Okay.

882
00:56:00.650 --> 00:56:03.380
If the defense could have stepped it up and got some three and outs,

883
00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:05.540
Brady in them,
they would have got into a rhythm.

884
00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:10.600
We just couldn't get into a fucking rhythm because our defense has been like

885
00:56:10.791 --> 00:56:13.820
room temperature butter all fucking year.
Um,

886
00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:19.190
so anyways,
when we got that personal foul call,

887
00:56:19.460 --> 00:56:24.460
that undisciplined play that like the San Diego chargers would back in the day,

888
00:56:25.060 --> 00:56:29.410
I was just like,
I was,
I,
I hate to say it,
I was like,
this fucking game is over.

889
00:56:30.160 --> 00:56:34.210
You know,
I still watched,
cause I can't bail on my fucking team.

890
00:56:34.570 --> 00:56:37.030
I still watch,
but I was just like,
this fucking game is over.

891
00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:42.190
Like they have completely Ben rattled by the jets.

892
00:56:42.220 --> 00:56:46.420
They're completely out of their fucking game plan and their playing

893
00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:51.700
like I'd like an inexperienced fucking team.
Um,

894
00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:55.530
and I texted Paul Versey and I wrote,

895
00:56:55.590 --> 00:57:00.590
I fuckin and then a capital letters told you we had this big debate was working

896
00:57:02.401 --> 00:57:06.890
down the comedy cellar Friday and I get ready for my big shows with David Tell

897
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:09.540
Jim Breuer and Jim and Jim Norton down at the Borgata.

898
00:57:09.541 --> 00:57:14.430
So I didn't want to be the weak link on that fucking gigantic comedy show.

899
00:57:14.431 --> 00:57:15.520
So I was uh,

900
00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:19.860
stealing my shit around the city and Virginia gave me a ride home and he was

901
00:57:19.861 --> 00:57:22.290
gone,
dude,
it's going to be a blood bath.
I'm telling you,

902
00:57:22.291 --> 00:57:25.140
it's gonna be a fucking bloodbath.
And I was going,
Paul,

903
00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:29.460
our defense sucks.
All they gotta do is run the ball.
But that,
that,

904
00:57:29.461 --> 00:57:32.100
you know what's funny is that didn't even need neither thing that we said

905
00:57:32.101 --> 00:57:32.934
happened.

906
00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.510
I thought the jets are really going to establish the fucking run and chew up the

907
00:57:36.511 --> 00:57:40.530
clock.
That's what I thought was going to happen.
And no way,

908
00:57:40.531 --> 00:57:45.330
shape or form that.
I think Tom Brady was going to have that bad of a game.

909
00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:47.010
I mean,
dude,
they were fucking off.

910
00:57:47.011 --> 00:57:51.660
Did you see that one play where Grankowski he's running a go pattern and Brady

911
00:57:51.661 --> 00:57:55.610
throws an out.
It was just like,
what?
What the fuck is going?

912
00:57:55.650 --> 00:58:00.510
They were completely rattled and I don't know if it,

913
00:58:00.570 --> 00:58:05.220
I think it was the interception slash all the shit talk in the jets were doing.

914
00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:10.020
I think that they wanted to beat him that fucking bad.
That when he fucked up.

915
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:15.860
MMM.
With that fucking Jesus Christ.
I mean that,
that,

916
00:58:15.861 --> 00:58:20.750
that thing was like a,
if rex Grossman made us instructional video

917
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:25.490
on how to throw whatever that pass was,

918
00:58:25.491 --> 00:58:30.140
it wasn't a fucking a screen pass.
I don't know what it was.

919
00:58:31.940 --> 00:58:35.360
It was just a,
Oh my God.
It was just like,

920
00:58:35.490 --> 00:58:39.920
I'm already picked it off and I was like,
oh no.
Oh No.

921
00:58:39.921 --> 00:58:43.520
Not now.
Not this week.
Not to this fucking team.

922
00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:47.930
So I have to go down.
This is the funny thing.

923
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:50.690
This is the funniest thing about all of this.

924
00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:54.400
I've talked so much shit about the jets this year.
Last week,

925
00:58:54.401 --> 00:58:57.820
the jets lose to the fucking colts yet when the fucking game,

926
00:58:57.970 --> 00:58:59.320
which is why I think the cult,

927
00:58:59.350 --> 00:59:03.940
the jets could win because when you win a championship,
not only are you good,

928
00:59:04.090 --> 00:59:08.140
but you have that stepped in.
Shit luck.
The tuck rule.

929
00:59:08.170 --> 00:59:12.160
What the fuck was that?
Right.
All right,
fuck it.
Give us the ball back.
Yay.

930
00:59:12.161 --> 00:59:15.460
We win the helmet.
Catch you just,

931
00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:20.620
and with the jets you have the colts calling timeout with 29 seconds left.

932
00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:21.351
You know,

933
00:59:21.351 --> 00:59:26.260
just in case we get the ball back with a 5.5 seconds left a tip,

934
00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:31.380
we'll call the time out here and have mediocre Mark Sanchez with the fucking

935
00:59:31.881 --> 00:59:35.560
deer in the headlights.
Give them a nice minute to chill out.
Gather his thought,

936
00:59:35.570 --> 00:59:39.560
give rex an opportunity to give them the next three plays so he can show out.

937
00:59:39.561 --> 00:59:43.530
Next play.
18 yard completion game over.
Um,

938
00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:47.650
you gotta have that stepped in.
Shit.
Look.
And I just feel like,

939
00:59:48.490 --> 00:59:53.270
I feel like the jets have that.
They have that,
uh,
oh my God,

940
00:59:53.271 --> 00:59:54.560
we're gonna lose this game.

941
00:59:54.561 --> 00:59:58.220
And then somebody hits somebody out of bounds for no fucking reason.
Oh,

942
00:59:58.221 --> 01:00:02.870
wait a minute.
We just got a first down.
So
I don't know.

943
01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:07.880
This should be a great fucking game this week.
All right.

944
01:00:07.881 --> 01:00:10.090
And I love being a jet hater.

945
01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.730
I love that the jets beat Pittsburgh the last time and that the game is in

946
01:00:13.731 --> 01:00:17.720
Pittsburgh and that Polamalu is playing this week.
And uh,

947
01:00:17.721 --> 01:00:21.290
and I love that ESPN will probably hype the shit out of the jets.

948
01:00:21.291 --> 01:00:26.070
That's what I'm hoping.
That's what I'm hoping.
Um,
so anyway,

949
01:00:26.071 --> 01:00:27.860
so I'm sitting there,
let's get to the misery now.

950
01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:31.790
The misery of my fucking life that day.
Some sitting there,
okay.

951
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:38.120
On one of the most unbelievable fucking weekends I've ever done in comedy.

952
01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:40.160
Like I got to work with Jim Norton,

953
01:00:40.790 --> 01:00:45.260
Jim Breuer and David tell myself we were all on the same show at the Borgata.

954
01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:49.580
We played at 2100 seater or 20,
whatever,

955
01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:54.200
the fucking big one.
And we sold it out three fucking times.

956
01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:59.090
And I was just sitting there thinking like,
how fucking him it,
first of all,

957
01:00:59.091 --> 01:01:01.460
I had not seen Jim,
let's,
let's go through the lineup here.

958
01:01:01.490 --> 01:01:06.490
I had not seen Jim Norton do stand up a headlining set

959
01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:12.200
since before the OPN,
Anthony virus tours.

960
01:01:12.201 --> 01:01:14.990
That's how fucking long it's been because me and him came up together.

961
01:01:14.991 --> 01:01:18.740
So when I started headlining,
he started headlining at a,

962
01:01:18.741 --> 01:01:22.430
he actually blew up,
uh,
before most of us from our,

963
01:01:22.530 --> 01:01:27.380
our graduating class,
he got on the European Anthony Show,
um,

964
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:31.040
pre that whole scandal in the church.
He was already headlining.

965
01:01:31.041 --> 01:01:34.040
So I never got to really,
I never got to work with them.

966
01:01:35.090 --> 01:01:39.990
So he was,
he opened the show so,
and I,

967
01:01:39.991 --> 01:01:41.130
and I was going on next.

968
01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:45.190
So I got to stand there every fucking night watching him work,

969
01:01:45.580 --> 01:01:48.550
watching him switch some jokes around and the absolutely killing.

970
01:01:48.551 --> 01:01:53.440
He was fucking hilarious.
He's got this bit on,
uh,
that new show.

971
01:01:53.470 --> 01:01:56.530
Hoarders that fucking killed me every night.

972
01:01:57.300 --> 01:02:02.100
And uh,
it was,
it was fucking awesome.
Cause you know,
I do the road.
I do it.

973
01:02:02.120 --> 01:02:04.470
You know,
when I go out,
I go with the roads,
I go with [inaudible] but I,

974
01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:07.280
I don't get to work with any of my peers,

975
01:02:07.281 --> 01:02:11.330
like the guys that I started out with anymore.
And then on top of that,

976
01:02:11.331 --> 01:02:15.800
then I had brewer and a tell and those were the guys when I came down from

977
01:02:15.801 --> 01:02:18.050
Boston and I was this fucking nerd,

978
01:02:18.051 --> 01:02:22.770
new comic and I'd be in the back of the Boston comedy club with like my
backpack.

979
01:02:24.210 --> 01:02:26.910
I swear to God I had a backpack.
Right.
Cause I would walk around,
you know,

980
01:02:26.911 --> 01:02:31.680
on the subway and I had all my shit in there.
My comedy notebook,
you know,

981
01:02:31.681 --> 01:02:33.990
just in case comedy inspiration at me,

982
01:02:33.991 --> 01:02:38.070
I was a total fucking nerd and I used to sit at the back of the Boston Comedy

983
01:02:38.070 --> 01:02:40.920
Club,
which they should make a fucking movie about that place.

984
01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.110
It was the rise,

985
01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:48.840
most intimidating fucking room I ever went into.
Um,

986
01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:52.320
I mean in a lot of ways it was worse.
I did the Apollo one time,

987
01:02:52.321 --> 01:02:55.710
it was worse than that.
Um,
cause he,
Apollo,

988
01:02:55.900 --> 01:02:59.790
there's this odd sort of no pressure because you're expecting to get booed.

989
01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:02.910
He still,
you don't want to get booed,
but if he get booed,

990
01:03:02.911 --> 01:03:05.340
I mean the amount of p they booed.
Like Lauryn Hill,

991
01:03:05.490 --> 01:03:10.170
like famous superstars have gotten boots so it's not that bad.
But like,
uh,

992
01:03:11.100 --> 01:03:16.100
the way the Boston Comedy Club was run back in the day was completely opposite

993
01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:21.990
to all the other comedy clubs that I made,
at least in my experience.

994
01:03:21.991 --> 01:03:26.610
Like this is how they would do it.
They would,
uh,
you know,

995
01:03:26.611 --> 01:03:29.640
if you came down and you were a new comic and they were going to put you on,

996
01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.560
they put you on early in the show and they tried to,
uh,
you know,

997
01:03:34.590 --> 01:03:39.590
assess where you were as a comedian by sticking you basically in the show where

998
01:03:39.961 --> 01:03:43.440
they figured your talents we're at,
which is,
you know,
if you're newer,

999
01:03:43.441 --> 01:03:47.460
they put you earlier in the show,
the Boston Comedy Club,
if you came down,

1000
01:03:47.550 --> 01:03:49.920
they're like,
oh yeah,
you're a new comic.
You want to go on,
all right.

1001
01:03:50.130 --> 01:03:55.130
They put you on like three quarters through the show after like fucking Louis Ck

1002
01:03:55.410 --> 01:03:59.900
,
Jim Breuer,
Jay Moore had just leveled the fucking room and then you,

1003
01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.690
they right,
you want to go on next,
right.

1004
01:04:03.690 --> 01:04:07.290
And you literally would feel like,
you know those spike Lee movies where the,

1005
01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:10.950
where the main character that he be focusing on is just standing there.

1006
01:04:11.190 --> 01:04:14.060
But the background is like slowly pulling away.
That's,

1007
01:04:14.090 --> 01:04:17.460
that's what I would feel like.
And I would immediately go from,
you know,

1008
01:04:19.860 --> 01:04:23.530
feeling like,
you know,
five foot 10 to feeling like I was like three,
four,

1009
01:04:23.531 --> 01:04:27.030
10 I and I,
it was fucking unbelievable.

1010
01:04:28.320 --> 01:04:29.220
I was the worst.

1011
01:04:29.221 --> 01:04:32.610
And then all comics hung out in the back and you were convinced that they all

1012
01:04:32.611 --> 01:04:35.910
thought you sucked and they were all watching you.
It was brutal.
So anyway,

1013
01:04:35.911 --> 01:04:40.911
so I got to work with those guys this weekend and I'm,

1014
01:04:41.610 --> 01:04:46.610
I'm sitting there like a fan all weekend and the crowds were amazing and a,

1015
01:04:46.950 --> 01:04:48.870
but the whole weekend is fucking jets.

1016
01:04:49.440 --> 01:04:53.040
Patriots game is looming and I'm sitting here going,

1017
01:04:53.041 --> 01:04:57.690
this fucking game can go either goddamn way they want.
Once we won once,

1018
01:04:57.691 --> 01:05:00.150
I don't know what the fuck everybody's talking about.

1019
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:03.580
Like this is going to be a cake walk our defense.

1020
01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:09.390
All right?
And I'm just sitting there at one point,

1021
01:05:10.230 --> 01:05:12.480
who was actually last week when the jets beat the colts.

1022
01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:16.260
I'm sitting there going like,
you gotta be fucking kidding me.

1023
01:05:16.650 --> 01:05:19.750
I'm literally to the comedy guts going,

1024
01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.800
what are the fucking odds that the team I've been talking shit about for the

1025
01:05:28.360 --> 01:05:30.910
entire fucking year.
He's not only

1026
01:05:32.590 --> 01:05:37.020
gonna make the playoffs back into the fucking playoffs,
lose a playoff game,

1027
01:05:37.470 --> 01:05:39.450
but then fucking win the fucking thing.

1028
01:05:40.020 --> 01:05:44.850
The next week they're going to play my fucking team.
Alright?

1029
01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:46.890
And I'm going to be in New Jersey.

1030
01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.530
The fucking game is at four o'clock or four 30 whatever the fuck it is.

1031
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:56.580
And I go on stage at eight in New Jersey,

1032
01:05:57.030 --> 01:05:59.280
in front of a bunch of fucking jet fans.

1033
01:06:00.270 --> 01:06:04.200
Why does this keep happening to me?
It's unfucking.

1034
01:06:05.040 --> 01:06:08.970
I can't,
I can't explain it.
I go down to Philly,

1035
01:06:08.971 --> 01:06:11.970
all that fucking shit out.
I guess that it had nothing to do about sports.

1036
01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:16.080
Sports pulled me out of the mud down there.
Another fucking time.

1037
01:06:16.200 --> 01:06:19.500
I have a random weekend booked at Caroline's,

1038
01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:23.640
a random fucking weekend.
They book it like six,
seven,
eight months out.

1039
01:06:24.930 --> 01:06:29.100
And Lo and behold,
the weekend I come in,
the first night I come in,

1040
01:06:29.101 --> 01:06:32.130
the night I fly in to do morning press.

1041
01:06:32.131 --> 01:06:34.230
I flew in on like a fucking Thursday or Wednesday,

1042
01:06:34.231 --> 01:06:37.860
I can't remember what the fucking Yankees won the world series.

1043
01:06:38.070 --> 01:06:39.720
And I'm staying in Times Square.

1044
01:06:39.870 --> 01:06:44.280
I'm trying to sleep and I can't cause all I hear is out in the fucking outside

1045
01:06:44.281 --> 01:06:45.114
my hotel window.

1046
01:06:48.090 --> 01:06:48.760
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

1047
01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:53.090
<v 7>and I'm sitting there with pillows on each fucking head.
So now</v>

1048
01:06:53.290 --> 01:06:57.280
<v 11>sitting there and I'm going,
this is classic,</v>

1049
01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.593
my career.

1050
01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:03.550
This is either going to be fucking amazing or an absolute goddamn debacle.

1051
01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:08.880
And I was sitting in my fucking hotel room and Brady threw that pick and I was

1052
01:07:08.981 --> 01:07:13.210
like,
oh my God.
Oh my God,
please.
No,
please,

1053
01:07:13.420 --> 01:07:16.920
please don't.
Not this week for the love of fucking God kitchen.

1054
01:07:16.930 --> 01:07:20.790
Not I'm trying to go a hundred days without boozing canyon,

1055
01:07:20.830 --> 01:07:22.900
not do with this week.

1056
01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.470
I know we're not good enough to win the super bowl this fucking year.

1057
01:07:26.680 --> 01:07:28.450
I know we're going to lose in the playoffs,

1058
01:07:28.630 --> 01:07:33.630
but can we just not lose to these fucking shit talking cunts please.

1059
01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:37.720
Right.

1060
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:41.890
And then they fucking keystone cop did and missed the field goal and we drove

1061
01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:46.600
down there and I ended it just,
it just,
it just fucking unraveled.

1062
01:07:46.990 --> 01:07:49.270
And the whole time I'm sitting there going,

1063
01:07:50.050 --> 01:07:53.440
what is going to happen at my standup show?

1064
01:07:55.570 --> 01:07:55.770
<v 7>What?</v>

1065
01:07:55.770 --> 01:07:58.470
Cause I already had been walking around the casino that day and all I'm seeing

1066
01:07:58.471 --> 01:08:02.070
is jets jerseys.
I see a couple of,
I'm in fucking Atlantic City,
New Jersey.

1067
01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:04.100
<v 12>Yeah.</v>

1068
01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:06.880
<v 7>All right.
The Eagles are not in the playoffs.
There's no playoffs,</v>

1069
01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:09.140
there's no eagles fans there.
It's jets fans.

1070
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:14.500
And I get this show to fucking do and I perform in an art where it's okay to

1071
01:08:15.591 --> 01:08:20.390
yell at you,
fucking suck you faggot.
It's okay to do that.

1072
01:08:20.810 --> 01:08:25.810
And I'm watching my team on ravel and I'm just sitting there ironing my show

1073
01:08:27.261 --> 01:08:28.094
shirt.

1074
01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:33.903
<v 13>Okay,</v>

1075
01:08:33.990 --> 01:08:37.810
<v 7>go.
And not only do I gotta do a podcast and eat fucking crow,</v>

1076
01:08:38.050 --> 01:08:43.050
I now have to go down a dance like a fucking monkey for a bunch of Goddamn

1077
01:08:43.300 --> 01:08:46.360
elated jet fans who are,

1078
01:08:46.390 --> 01:08:49.990
who are probably going to be yelling j e t as jets,
jets,
jets.

1079
01:08:49.991 --> 01:08:53.770
Every time I'm trying to do a punchline,
why does this keep happening to me?

1080
01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:58.430
Why couldn't I bet in fucking Ohio?
All right,

1081
01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:03.050
so now it's seven 30,
the game is basically fucking over.

1082
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:07.450
And then there's a knock on the door at security to bring me downstairs,

1083
01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:11.420
which is absolutely fucking hilarious.
Like,
you know,
like I need that,

1084
01:09:11.421 --> 01:09:15.950
but you know,
I'll feed my fucking ego and the door opens up.

1085
01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:18.860
And I was just like,
I fucking knew it.
I fucking knew it.

1086
01:09:18.861 --> 01:09:21.380
I fucking called it that fucking Versie.
He can't,

1087
01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:24.830
he's not answering his fucking phone.
I fucking told him,

1088
01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:28.970
I fucking told him I knew this was going to fucking happen.
Right.

1089
01:09:29.690 --> 01:09:34.010
And,
uh,
the guy takes me downstairs and I'm thinking,
well,

1090
01:09:34.011 --> 01:09:38.930
you know what's great about this shit is they're taken me the good fellas way so

1091
01:09:38.931 --> 01:09:42.230
I can go down in the elevator,

1092
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:46.850
I'm in the catacombs behind the fucking massive theater.

1093
01:09:47.330 --> 01:09:52.040
I'll just sit there.
I'll watch the final fucking minutes of the game,
you know,

1094
01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:58.120
because unlike those other fucking fairweather con fans who left Gillette

1095
01:09:58.910 --> 01:10:02.840
Stadium,
you know,
I'll get to that later.

1096
01:10:02.990 --> 01:10:06.050
But there's a reason why they build stadiums as big as they do.

1097
01:10:06.140 --> 01:10:09.950
It's for all the fairweather fucking fans.
All right?

1098
01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:14.210
And it's also why you should never be upset if somebody you love does it.

1099
01:10:14.211 --> 01:10:18.230
Return of a fucking fan letter,
because that's what fans are.

1100
01:10:18.800 --> 01:10:21.860
That's what they are,
you know,
entertain me.

1101
01:10:21.861 --> 01:10:25.160
I love you as long you should do what I want and then you don't,

1102
01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.510
when you're down,
I'm going to walk out on you.
And I'm guilty of it too.

1103
01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:33.800
I've had plenty of fucking people that I've been fans of that went broke.

1104
01:10:33.801 --> 01:10:37.670
I never sent him any goddamn money.
I just,

1105
01:10:37.671 --> 01:10:38.840
I just talked to my friend,

1106
01:10:38.841 --> 01:10:43.220
do what the fuck happened and what happened to Leif Garrett
Leaf,
Gary.

1107
01:10:43.460 --> 01:10:48.350
So anyway,
so I'm going down into the,
uh,
Indiana.
I'm thinking,
well,

1108
01:10:48.890 --> 01:10:50.450
whatever,
I,
you know what,
what the fuck?

1109
01:10:50.480 --> 01:10:53.600
There's no way it's going to be worse than Philly.
Um,

1110
01:10:54.800 --> 01:10:57.390
I just got to address it the second I go out there,
right.
So,

1111
01:10:57.420 --> 01:10:59.900
but at least I can just have this moment of peace,

1112
01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:05.120
it fucking deal with the fact that what I kind of knew was gonna happen was

1113
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:07.280
gonna happen.
I just didn't want it to happen to the jets.

1114
01:11:07.380 --> 01:11:10.520
So I'm fucking decompressing from that loss.
I got set it aside,

1115
01:11:10.850 --> 01:11:14.670
cause now I have to go fucking out there and be dance like a goddamn clown.

1116
01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:19.320
So as I'm sitting there watching the final fucking seconds of it,

1117
01:11:19.321 --> 01:11:24.321
all of a sudden I hear Jim brewer coming down the fucking Corda going,

1118
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:29.580
you fucking believe this shit.
You fucking,
it just keeps getting louder.

1119
01:11:29.581 --> 01:11:33.510
I'm like,
please don't walk into my dressing room.
And he just comes walking in.

1120
01:11:33.511 --> 01:11:36.680
He's like,
the fucking Patriot did.

1121
01:11:36.690 --> 01:11:41.220
He starts miming jerking off in my face and he goes like,

1122
01:11:41.221 --> 01:11:45.840
he just blew a load in my face.
Right?
He goes,
fuck you mother fucker.

1123
01:11:45.930 --> 01:11:47.690
Like I had been talking shit all we got

1124
01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:48.533
<v 11>good.</v>

1125
01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:53.400
It proceeds to start trashing me in the Patriots and it was actually fucking

1126
01:11:53.401 --> 01:11:55.440
hilarious because I saw in him,

1127
01:11:55.441 --> 01:12:00.441
I saw me last year screaming about Peyton manning cause you only hear shit about

1128
01:12:00.571 --> 01:12:01.950
your team.
You know,

1129
01:12:01.951 --> 01:12:04.600
you never hear anything fair and balanced and he's sitting there,
so that's good.

1130
01:12:04.890 --> 01:12:09.150
<v 7>Oh two of Brady,
he's the greatest fucking quarterback ever.</v>

1131
01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.160
It was literally

1132
01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:13.900
<v 11>my rent from last year about Peyton manning.
So,
ah,</v>

1133
01:12:14.410 --> 01:12:17.170
was I getting my just desserts and I,

1134
01:12:17.230 --> 01:12:20.590
he just kept trashing me and then I said like,
I'll fuck you.

1135
01:12:20.591 --> 01:12:23.770
You still haven't won one since 1969.
He goes,
fuck you,

1136
01:12:23.920 --> 01:12:27.380
you sound like a Yankee Fan faggot.
And he's like,

1137
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:33.820
I took a pounding from him.
Um,

1138
01:12:33.850 --> 01:12:37.900
classic jet Fan though.
Didn't say shit before the game was all fucking nervous,

1139
01:12:37.901 --> 01:12:40.390
just like every was,
everybody was admitted.

1140
01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:44.300
<v 7>I didn't get any emails from jet fans and afterwards,
you know what,</v>

1141
01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:49.280
only got a few and it was from the usual cunty ones that uh,
you know,

1142
01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:52.970
really need to go hug their dad or whatever.
So then I'm sitting there going,

1143
01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.940
oh my God.
And a Norton came in and he was kind of fucking laugh.

1144
01:12:58.010 --> 01:13:01.700
And he goes,
you're bummed out.
I go,
yeah,
I got them.
I know I'm past it,
dude.

1145
01:13:01.701 --> 01:13:05.810
I got to do this.
And I go,
I guys give me a lot of jets fans out there.

1146
01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.673
Isn't there?

1147
01:13:11.280 --> 01:13:11.440
<v 13>Okay.</v>

1148
01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:15.130
<v 7>Why,
why comedy gods?
Why did I have to be in Atlantic city?</v>

1149
01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:18.700
Why did I have to be working with Jim Brewer as much as I fucking love the guy,

1150
01:13:18.850 --> 01:13:22.150
why did I have to work be working with the Jet Fan?
You know why?

1151
01:13:22.210 --> 01:13:25.480
Because I deserved it because I've been talking shit all fucking year.

1152
01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:30.940
I actually became what?
I didn't want to be what I was trashing Rex Ryan for.

1153
01:13:30.941 --> 01:13:35.740
So anyway,
so now I'm,
I'm standing out in the waste 20 fucking 100 people.

1154
01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:38.800
So I'm peeking through the curtain,
right?

1155
01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:42.760
Like some fucking open miker who's never been on stage before.

1156
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:46.900
I look in the front row and what do I see?
I see like five jet jerseys,

1157
01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:50.890
some fat fuck with the jets hat and unless got,
Ugh,
God,

1158
01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:55.450
Oh God,
here we go.
Here we go.
God dammit.

1159
01:13:57.070 --> 01:14:01.960
Ah,
if I could clone myself right now and put a fucking Goddamn,

1160
01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.620
I'm doing standup sport coat on this person,
I would.

1161
01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:06.140
<v 13>Yeah.</v>

1162
01:14:06.140 --> 01:14:10.520
<v 7>So Jimmy goes out there
in all week.
He just kept,</v>

1163
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:14.770
he just getting funnier.
It was,
it was really fucking awesome watching him.
Ed,

1164
01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:19.780
he actually took one joke that was killing in the,
uh,
the end of a set.

1165
01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:22.540
He put it at the beginning and it fucking just destroyed.

1166
01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:27.580
And then he's just murder up.
Then he murdered him twice Saturday night,

1167
01:14:27.610 --> 01:14:29.620
but his clearly just fuck it.

1168
01:14:29.621 --> 01:14:33.040
Take it to another level and I'm just laughing,
going,

1169
01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:37.090
and Jimmy's going to have a set where I can't even follow them.
Really.

1170
01:14:37.091 --> 01:14:40.090
Comedy Gods.
This is really gonna fucking happen.

1171
01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:45.700
And uh,
I'm sitting there and then this is okay for all you comedians out there.

1172
01:14:45.730 --> 01:14:48.900
I was like,
all right,
what do I got to do?
What?
Well,

1173
01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:52.300
how am I going to get out of this?
What is,
what is the,

1174
01:14:52.301 --> 01:14:55.060
I can't just go out there and start doing my fucking act

1175
01:14:56.790 --> 01:14:58.230
and act like nothing's happening.

1176
01:14:58.230 --> 01:15:00.870
I was thinking of going out there and the second they started yelling about the

1177
01:15:00.871 --> 01:15:02.760
jets,
I was going to be like,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no,
no.
I'm taping the game.

1178
01:15:02.761 --> 01:15:04.680
Don't tell me what happens.
They'll tell me what happened,

1179
01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:08.770
but that would be funny for like three fucking seconds.
So I finally,

1180
01:15:08.771 --> 01:15:11.340
I was just going like what I always do whenever I,

1181
01:15:11.370 --> 01:15:15.400
before I'm going out on stage and I just don't feel like I'm going to have a

1182
01:15:15.401 --> 01:15:19.300
good set and I don't feel like I'm funny.
I just said,
what am I feeling?

1183
01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:20.260
What am I thinking?

1184
01:15:21.290 --> 01:15:21.560
<v 14>Yeah,</v>

1185
01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:23.090
<v 7>I am thinking,
fuck.</v>

1186
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:28.450
I can't believe the patriots lost and evolve fucking states that I have to be in

1187
01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:32.420
to watch them lose to the team that I hate the most right now.

1188
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:35.740
Why did I have to be in New Jersey?
And I was literally like,
Oh,

1189
01:15:35.780 --> 01:15:39.350
there's your opener.
That is your opener.
And that's what I went out to.

1190
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:43.820
And all the jets fans would die in fucking laughing and then they left me alone.

1191
01:15:43.821 --> 01:15:48.230
They didn't give a fuck.
They will fucking elated.
And uh,
although I couldn't,

1192
01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.470
I couldn't slow down at any point during my set.

1193
01:15:52.010 --> 01:15:54.980
Like the crowds are so great all weekend.
Usually when you have a crowd that big,

1194
01:15:54.981 --> 01:15:58.580
you can't really bring them down to try to build it back up again.

1195
01:15:58.581 --> 01:16:00.920
You have to kind of just killed the whole time.

1196
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:04.790
I noticed you could bring him down,
which was so great the whole week.
But,

1197
01:16:04.850 --> 01:16:07.250
but during that set,
every time I would bring it down,

1198
01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:09.970
that would always be one guy.
Yeah.
Fucking jets.

1199
01:16:14.780 --> 01:16:19.670
So,
so I took my pounding,
so there you go.
Congratulations.

1200
01:16:19.671 --> 01:16:22.940
Seriously.
And I got to,
I have to,
I have to admit something to,
I walked by like,

1201
01:16:22.941 --> 01:16:26.150
you know when your team fucking loses a game like this,

1202
01:16:26.270 --> 01:16:30.590
will you give a fuck like this?
You cannot watch ESPN for a good three days.

1203
01:16:31.010 --> 01:16:35.540
And I haven't been able to do that a lot this year.

1204
01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:38.750
I couldn't do it when the Ravens raped us.

1205
01:16:38.810 --> 01:16:41.840
I guess it was a year ago when the ravens raped us last year in the playoffs.

1206
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:46.730
Playoffs.
I didn't watch it for like three fucking days.

1207
01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:53.220
Um,
when the Lakers beat us in game seven,
you know,
when,
uh,

1208
01:16:53.420 --> 01:16:56.740
their,
uh,
their 12th man came off the bench with those striped shirts,

1209
01:16:57.310 --> 01:17:00.520
it just started fucking call and files and technical files and all that shit.

1210
01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:04.210
I'll never get over that by the way.
Um,

1211
01:17:04.330 --> 01:17:06.520
I didn't watch it for like fucking four.
I couldn't eat,

1212
01:17:06.521 --> 01:17:10.370
I couldn't even watch TV cause I live in Los Angeles.
I had close the windows,

1213
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:17.350
Lakers Faulker had to deal with that.
Um,
and then this one,

1214
01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:20.500
I've had three bad things come in threes,
right?

1215
01:17:20.501 --> 01:17:22.570
People I don't believe in that either.
You just,

1216
01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:27.550
you just start recounting after three.
Um,
and this is one of them.

1217
01:17:27.551 --> 01:17:30.220
I just,
I just could not watch it.

1218
01:17:30.221 --> 01:17:35.010
I still have not watched one second of ESPN.
I flipped by real quick with,

1219
01:17:35.011 --> 01:17:38.560
with the,
with the mute button on.
And if there's a game on,
I'll watch the game.

1220
01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:40.713
Um,

1221
01:17:41.080 --> 01:17:46.080
but I walked by a TV and I saw Rex Ryan doing the press conference.

1222
01:17:48.850 --> 01:17:50.290
I only heard a couple things he had,

1223
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.240
but he had a genuine look of joy on his face.
And for half a second,

1224
01:17:55.241 --> 01:18:00.241
I was actually somewhere in my jet Hayden mind happy for the guy like Ah,

1225
01:18:00.870 --> 01:18:05.560
the motherfucker,
he did it and he fucking did it.
That son of a bitch,
you know,

1226
01:18:06.760 --> 01:18:08.110
whatever.
I might be a conflict.

1227
01:18:08.140 --> 01:18:13.140
I can't take it to the level of truly wishing that level of misery.

1228
01:18:15.700 --> 01:18:19.060
You know,
they haven't won it since 1969 at me.
But you be honest with yourself.

1229
01:18:19.061 --> 01:18:23.650
This is what I think when you realize if you're a problem fan,

1230
01:18:23.770 --> 01:18:27.790
where you're taken to the point where you're really just did,

1231
01:18:27.850 --> 01:18:31.230
I like the point that I've taken it.
Um,

1232
01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:34.720
where it's just no fun to be a sports fan where you literally take it to the

1233
01:18:34.721 --> 01:18:37.900
point where you don't want a,

1234
01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:40.670
like I remember like the,
the,
the,

1235
01:18:40.671 --> 01:18:45.671
I probably age like 11 years after the Red Sox won in 2004 every year,

1236
01:18:46.040 --> 01:18:49.640
praying for the Yankees to never win another fucking world series select that

1237
01:18:49.641 --> 01:18:51.770
wasn't going to happen,
you know,

1238
01:18:52.820 --> 01:18:55.430
$200 million every fucking year on the table,
you know,

1239
01:18:55.431 --> 01:18:59.990
plus a fucking great organization is going to happen.
Um,

1240
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:04.310
it's just too much fucking energy.
So my team is out of it.

1241
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:08.920
I have done shit talking,
and even if the jets fucking lose,
I'm,

1242
01:19:08.970 --> 01:19:13.160
I'm not gonna do that to you because you beat my team and that,
and that's,

1243
01:19:13.190 --> 01:19:15.020
you know,
that's a fucking bitch move.

1244
01:19:15.440 --> 01:19:19.820
I'm not going to do it so seriously from the bottom of my jet hating heart.

1245
01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:22.340
Congratulations to all you guys.
You deserve it and joy.

1246
01:19:22.490 --> 01:19:25.520
You're fucking week and uh,
no,
this,

1247
01:19:25.521 --> 01:19:30.521
that you guys next week now carry the pressure of being,

1248
01:19:30.780 --> 01:19:34.370
or the only thing that stands in the way of a date,

1249
01:19:34.720 --> 01:19:37.880
rapists possibly going on to win his third super bowl championship.

1250
01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:45.990
Dude,
Ben Roethlisberger quietly,

1251
01:19:47.130 --> 01:19:47.970
very quietly.

1252
01:19:47.971 --> 01:19:51.600
I mean date rape charges really drown out a lot of on the field success.

1253
01:19:52.290 --> 01:19:56.220
Let's be fair,
very quietly,
uh,

1254
01:19:57.500 --> 01:20:00.800
could join the ranks of as far as I know,

1255
01:20:02.880 --> 01:20:05.820
if he wins his third one,
he's on the only,

1256
01:20:06.240 --> 01:20:09.750
he's with Tom and Troy Aikman.
They're the only other guys who have won three.

1257
01:20:09.751 --> 01:20:14.460
Right.
And then there's only two guys have one.
Four is Montana in Bradshaw.

1258
01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.940
Am I correct?
Am I missing somebody?
I thought Jim Plunkett for half a second,

1259
01:20:17.941 --> 01:20:22.150
but that was Kenny Stabler and 77.
So,
uh,
Oh,

1260
01:20:22.260 --> 01:20:24.960
let me tell jet fans.
I gotta get,
I gotta I owe this to you guys.

1261
01:20:24.961 --> 01:20:26.430
I got to let you know all my misery.

1262
01:20:28.060 --> 01:20:28.210
<v 13>Yeah.</v>

1263
01:20:28.210 --> 01:20:33.180
<v 7>So at the end of the show,
the show fucking ends and,</v>

1264
01:20:34.170 --> 01:20:36.420
uh,
the end of the week and,
uh,

1265
01:20:36.440 --> 01:20:40.700
I took a bunch of pictures with fucking jet fans wearing jerseys and,
uh,

1266
01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:44.620
it was actually,
we,
it was actually ended up being a good time,
but the,

1267
01:20:44.630 --> 01:20:49.410
the best thing was afterwards,
you know,
Norton into tell left,

1268
01:20:49.720 --> 01:20:51.460
cause you know,
they live in New York.
They took off,

1269
01:20:52.720 --> 01:20:54.250
Bro was handed with hang out with some friends.

1270
01:20:54.251 --> 01:20:58.390
So I go back to my fucking room by myself,
no security,

1271
01:20:58.420 --> 01:21:03.130
no nothing like now,
like I needed it.
But I walked back through the catacombs,

1272
01:21:03.400 --> 01:21:08.400
the fucking good fellas way by myself just thinking about the loss.

1273
01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:13.420
All I hear is the sound of my shoes hitting the tile floor,

1274
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:19.510
walking to that service elevator that looks like shit because they,
you know,

1275
01:21:19.511 --> 01:21:23.290
they move furniture in.
It went up to my floor.

1276
01:21:25.150 --> 01:21:25.220
<v 13>Okay.</v>

1277
01:21:25.220 --> 01:21:30.140
<v 7>Went into this amazing suite that they had given me</v>

1278
01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.690
by myself.
I sat there,

1279
01:21:34.470 --> 01:21:39.330
I ordered room service and by myself with the TV off and only one light on in

1280
01:21:39.331 --> 01:21:43.050
silence.
I ate a cheeseburger,

1281
01:21:43.830 --> 01:21:47.970
some French fries.
And I got,
uh,
some cheesecake for dessert

1282
01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:54.980
and I just sat there.

1283
01:21:54.981 --> 01:21:59.750
I couldn't put the TV on and I just sat there in silence and then it hit me and

1284
01:21:59.751 --> 01:22:04.070
I was like,
oh my God,
I have to do the podcast and relive this.

1285
01:22:07.750 --> 01:22:11.380
So there you go.
I hope you jet fans deserved not deserved.

1286
01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.740
[inaudible] jet fans enjoyed that.
And I,
I'm,
I apologize that I,

1287
01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:17.770
when I got off the plane that I didn't come home,

1288
01:22:17.771 --> 01:22:20.680
I didn't come right home and do a podcast I could have,

1289
01:22:20.920 --> 01:22:25.030
but I really wanted to make sure that I did it justice,

1290
01:22:25.031 --> 01:22:29.050
that I got a good night's sleep.
I didn't want to do a lame podcast.

1291
01:22:29.051 --> 01:22:30.400
That podcast last week sucked.

1292
01:22:30.401 --> 01:22:33.610
I was getting ready to leave as the worst podcast I think I've ever done.

1293
01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:38.890
And uh,
I wanted to make sure that I,
you know,

1294
01:22:38.891 --> 01:22:43.240
I tried to remember all of my misery because I really felt,
you know,

1295
01:22:43.270 --> 01:22:47.680
that's one of the joys of winning is when a loud mouth count from the other
team,

1296
01:22:48.460 --> 01:22:52.390
you know,
they're miserable.
So I hope I didn't leave any details out.

1297
01:22:52.391 --> 01:22:53.830
I got a couple of emails.

1298
01:22:56.120 --> 01:22:56.953
<v 13>MMM.</v>

1299
01:22:57.130 --> 01:22:59.080
<v 7>I Dunno,
but here's what I wanted that somebody said,</v>

1300
01:22:59.081 --> 01:23:00.700
there was a couple of things I thought was funny.

1301
01:23:00.701 --> 01:23:04.600
Some guy what a jets fan who went up to a

1302
01:23:06.440 --> 01:23:11.050
Foxboro.
Oh,
you know what?
I have,
I have a feeling,
I'm just worried.

1303
01:23:11.051 --> 01:23:12.900
I'm not going to end up talking about the amazing look.

1304
01:23:12.910 --> 01:23:16.060
Can I just talk about how great Atlantic City was and why you guys have to see

1305
01:23:16.061 --> 01:23:16.894
this show?

1306
01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:20.260
Because I think we're going to take it to Connecticut at one of the casinos up

1307
01:23:20.261 --> 01:23:23.380
there.
And even if we don't,
if things don't work out,

1308
01:23:23.381 --> 01:23:25.390
which I know they're going to,
cause it was a fucking,

1309
01:23:25.570 --> 01:23:28.570
I want to thank everybody who came out to the shows.

1310
01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:32.800
It was really a fucking event.
Um,

1311
01:23:33.220 --> 01:23:36.640
and I don't overhype shows that I'm on,

1312
01:23:36.641 --> 01:23:41.641
but it was arguably one of the best comedy show easily that I've been on in the

1313
01:23:43.121 --> 01:23:44.800
last fucking 10 years.

1314
01:23:46.150 --> 01:23:50.050
And it's the strongest tour I've,
I think I've ever been on.
I mean,

1315
01:23:50.051 --> 01:23:54.620
those opie and Anthony ones were fucking amazing.
Those were amazing though.
Uh,

1316
01:23:54.650 --> 01:23:55.810
especially that night in Philly.

1317
01:23:55.811 --> 01:23:58.390
That's what's so funny about those fucking idiot Philly fans.

1318
01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:04.330
If you saw the email,
the lineup that night was Patrice O'neil,
Robert Kelly,

1319
01:24:05.350 --> 01:24:09.370
Tracy Morgan,
Ralphie made Jim Norton,
me,
who else was out there,

1320
01:24:09.371 --> 01:24:13.370
I'm going to forget Bob set.
It was fucking insane.
It was like one of the,

1321
01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:13.530
you know,

1322
01:24:13.530 --> 01:24:16.690
when those rock and roll hall of fame shows where they bring out like fucking

1323
01:24:16.691 --> 01:24:20.890
all these musicians and stick them on the stage and then somehow it always
sucks.

1324
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:27.520
Is it ever good when you have 58 guitarist in 19 drummers that never,

1325
01:24:27.521 --> 01:24:28.510
it never sounds good.

1326
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:33.700
And then they always play like mama kin or some fucking standard,
um,
hail,
hail,

1327
01:24:33.701 --> 01:24:37.190
rock and roll or some stupid shit that the we,
this is what is the first show.

1328
01:24:37.260 --> 01:24:39.850
And we played,
we was chicks d,
um,

1329
01:24:41.050 --> 01:24:43.840
except it was actually a great show.
But um,
this is,
so,

1330
01:24:43.841 --> 01:24:48.841
this will be the strongest one that I've been on since the ONA virus tour and a

1331
01:24:49.120 --> 01:24:51.310
opie and Anthony came down to,
and it was fucking great.

1332
01:24:51.311 --> 01:24:54.220
I was hanging out with both of them.
Um,

1333
01:24:54.880 --> 01:24:59.320
Anthony is absolutely fucking hilarious and there needs to be a documentary made

1334
01:24:59.321 --> 01:25:02.380
about people who played blackjack.
He came,

1335
01:25:02.410 --> 01:25:06.430
he came in from playing blackjack and he had sweat under his armpits.

1336
01:25:06.670 --> 01:25:11.650
Like he had been playing full court basketball in a turtleneck sweater.

1337
01:25:12.850 --> 01:25:16.000
Um,
it was awesome.
And I went over and watched him gamble and he was hilarious.

1338
01:25:16.001 --> 01:25:18.640
He was cursing out this fucking retard who didn't know how to,

1339
01:25:19.060 --> 01:25:22.750
didn't know how to gamble.
He fucking hit on 17,

1340
01:25:22.810 --> 01:25:26.350
went over and then the dealer got 21.
And uh,

1341
01:25:27.490 --> 01:25:30.700
I swear to God,
if Anthony killed him right then and there,
I,
I would've,

1342
01:25:30.730 --> 01:25:32.680
I would've become an accessory to murder.

1343
01:25:33.010 --> 01:25:34.540
Not In that I would have helped them kill him,

1344
01:25:34.541 --> 01:25:38.950
but I definitely would have helped to hide Anthony from the authorities.
Um,

1345
01:25:38.980 --> 01:25:43.090
do you mind if we come in Mr. Byrd?
Ah,
yeah.
But Warren,
yes,
we do.

1346
01:25:44.260 --> 01:25:47.830
Ah,
yeah,
just a,
just stay out of the bedroom.
Uh,
it's not really cleaned up.

1347
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:53.050
Um,
anyways,
it was an unbelievable night.
And,
uh,

1348
01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:55.150
I don't know when we're going to do the show again,

1349
01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:58.120
but I have to tell you if you get a chance to see any of those three fucking

1350
01:25:58.121 --> 01:26:03.010
guys like Jim Norton's at that is the funniest I've ever fucking seen them.

1351
01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:08.210
Dave Attell is a fucking beast at Jim Brewer.
I'm telling you,

1352
01:26:08.360 --> 01:26:13.360
has one of the top 10 funniest fucking bits I've ever seen.

1353
01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:19.730
Uh,
obviously I'm not gonna,
you know,
ruin what the fuck it is.

1354
01:26:19.731 --> 01:26:21.290
But it starts off,

1355
01:26:21.291 --> 01:26:25.340
I was standing up watching him and by the time he was done,

1356
01:26:25.341 --> 01:26:29.120
I was slumped down.
I made us a fucking dirty casino rug.

1357
01:26:29.121 --> 01:26:32.150
If I could have fucking been laying on the ground laughing,
I would have.

1358
01:26:32.151 --> 01:26:34.670
But I was actually,
you know,
I was crouching down.

1359
01:26:34.671 --> 01:26:37.560
You ever see like when they gamble in China,
you know how they crouched down?

1360
01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:40.580
I was sorta sitting like that,
but I was fucking dying laughing,

1361
01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:44.600
like lean sideways into the wall.
This is our funny,

1362
01:26:44.601 --> 01:26:48.050
the joke was I actually was downstairs in the green room at one point and called

1363
01:26:48.051 --> 01:26:52.490
Nia while Jim was on stage and you could hear the show and I put the phone up to

1364
01:26:52.491 --> 01:26:54.320
the bit and she was dying laughing.

1365
01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:57.920
So if you guys get a chance to see any of them,

1366
01:26:58.280 --> 01:27:01.940
go on their websites,
go see them because,
uh,

1367
01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:06.140
it was just a fucking unbelievable weekend and I really,

1368
01:27:06.141 --> 01:27:09.710
really hope that we get to do it again and a,

1369
01:27:09.711 --> 01:27:12.200
and I want to thank Jim Norton for putting the whole thing together.

1370
01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:17.750
It's just a great idea.
And the fans were fucking amazing.
They were quiet.

1371
01:27:17.751 --> 01:27:21.170
They would laugh and then they,
then they would be quiet and let you set it up.

1372
01:27:21.171 --> 01:27:24.610
I felt like I was working at the cellar,
you know where you are,

1373
01:27:24.920 --> 01:27:26.420
just a great comedy room,

1374
01:27:26.660 --> 01:27:31.250
but it was this fucking 2100 Cedar Conference Room.

1375
01:27:31.251 --> 01:27:34.040
So,
um,
I hope you guys all had a great time.

1376
01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:38.180
I've got ridiculous emails about people telling me how funny the show was.

1377
01:27:38.181 --> 01:27:41.240
And I got like three emails from people telling me that was the first comedy

1378
01:27:41.241 --> 01:27:44.480
show they ever went to.
Um,
well,

1379
01:27:44.510 --> 01:27:48.140
all I can say is you pick the fucking right one.
So that's it.

1380
01:27:48.141 --> 01:27:52.010
So I'll let you guys know when we're going to be doing more.
Um,
all right,

1381
01:27:52.011 --> 01:27:53.780
so here's,

1382
01:27:53.781 --> 01:27:57.780
here's an email I got from a jet Fan who went up to Gillette stadium.
All right?

1383
01:27:58.830 --> 01:28:02.990
Uh,
pat fans are all scumbags who shop at ll bean.

1384
01:28:07.210 --> 01:28:08.680
Be Honest,
Patriot fans.

1385
01:28:08.681 --> 01:28:13.681
If you really remove yourself from the situation and you go buy a patriots

1386
01:28:13.830 --> 01:28:15.820
tailgate,
you know,

1387
01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:20.740
you know those fucking boots that are like,
they're like leather on top,

1388
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:22.960
but they're made out of rubber on the bottom.

1389
01:28:23.020 --> 01:28:26.830
They'll shoot those boots are actually the shit.
Yeah,
we are a bunch of groups.

1390
01:28:26.831 --> 01:28:28.990
The same way.
If you go down to giants stadium,

1391
01:28:29.450 --> 01:28:33.910
it's like the fucking Jersey shore
meets,

1392
01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:37.390
uh,
you know,
those Artie Lange looking guys,
you know,

1393
01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:40.270
and I'm not trashing already leg because look at me.

1394
01:28:40.300 --> 01:28:45.190
I am a pasty face and back from Boston.
Um,
w you know,

1395
01:28:45.460 --> 01:28:49.000
we really are the faces of our state.
When I think of New Jersey,

1396
01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:53.440
I definitely think of on on Artie Lange type of a guy and thought when you think

1397
01:28:53.441 --> 01:28:57.280
a of Massachusetts don't you think about about some Conan O'brien,

1398
01:28:57.281 --> 01:29:02.070
bill burr looking fucking high.
E T t t t H.
I g J Tattoo.
Um,

1399
01:29:02.970 --> 01:29:05.100
so I'm not going to lie with you and I'm not going to say that we aren't

1400
01:29:05.101 --> 01:29:09.600
scumbags up there.
Uh,
we are told that got is just um,
uh,

1401
01:29:09.630 --> 01:29:12.360
just got in from Foxborough.
The experience was a good time,

1402
01:29:12.361 --> 01:29:14.940
expected some heckling going and uh,

1403
01:29:14.941 --> 01:29:19.140
made it out without getting hassled to hard overall was an awesome experience.

1404
01:29:19.141 --> 01:29:22.320
Watching all pat fans empty the stadium before the game was over.

1405
01:29:22.590 --> 01:29:24.030
My section was packed with jets.

1406
01:29:24.031 --> 01:29:28.590
Fans felt bad for the guy and his daughter who was surrounded on every side,

1407
01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:30.030
I guess by jet fans.

1408
01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:35.300
I'm not sure if it's Foxboro or NFL fans in general that are just degenerates

1409
01:29:36.230 --> 01:29:40.320
scumbags since I've only been to the Meadowlands prior to this for NFL Games.

1410
01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:43.800
But here's a small list of Shit I saw throughout the day.

1411
01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:49.470
I saw a guy in his girlfriend get real racist with one jets fans sitting in

1412
01:29:49.471 --> 01:29:50.890
front of them.
Uh,
yeah,
that's,

1413
01:29:50.891 --> 01:29:55.110
that's Boston until he spit beer on the wrong group of people.

1414
01:29:55.620 --> 01:29:58.770
And it turned into a pats fan verse pats fan fight.

1415
01:30:03.260 --> 01:30:03.621
You know,

1416
01:30:03.621 --> 01:30:08.270
funny that is because I've always resented Gillette stadium and the lighthouse

1417
01:30:08.420 --> 01:30:10.850
and the way they paved over the,

1418
01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:16.000
the scumbag experienced that going to a patriots game used to be over in Foxboro

1419
01:30:16.311 --> 01:30:19.640
stadium.
I hated how when we became a championship team,

1420
01:30:19.850 --> 01:30:24.140
all those corporate seats and all those fucking white collar douchebags who

1421
01:30:24.141 --> 01:30:25.190
started showing up,

1422
01:30:25.250 --> 01:30:30.250
it was a fucking keg party from 19 fucking 70 right through most of bill

1423
01:30:33.831 --> 01:30:38.410
Parcells time.
Not until we started winning championships and a,
the shit started.

1424
01:30:38.670 --> 01:30:43.010
Turn it around that all of a sudden there was this expecting to win vibe and

1425
01:30:43.011 --> 01:30:47.690
everybody started acting classy.
The bottom line is no fans,
no fans are classy.

1426
01:30:49.040 --> 01:30:53.270
Um,
unless you're winning,
then when you're winning,
it's easy to be like,
you know,

1427
01:30:53.570 --> 01:30:57.380
they just a bunch of classes,
people,
you know,
what kind of behavior is that?
Um,

1428
01:30:57.440 --> 01:30:59.900
it's like,
dude,
why don't you look into your fucking closet?
[inaudible]

1429
01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:03.950
remember how you acted?
It's like Yankee fans.
Remember that Shit.

1430
01:31:04.760 --> 01:31:08.420
It was always red feather.
Red Sox fans are scumbags.
We have no class and blah,

1431
01:31:08.421 --> 01:31:10.730
blah,
blah,
blah.
And this is all why the Yankees were winning.

1432
01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:15.770
And then I remember when a rod slap the ball out of a,

1433
01:31:15.800 --> 01:31:17.930
was it Bronson or royals glove?

1434
01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:21.680
And the call went against him for the first time in history.

1435
01:31:22.130 --> 01:31:25.280
The Yankees got caught cheating.
You know,

1436
01:31:25.281 --> 01:31:28.310
if they're all the years of polling home runs into the fucking stands and

1437
01:31:28.311 --> 01:31:30.890
leaning into balls during,
uh,
when you're picked off,

1438
01:31:31.960 --> 01:31:34.670
they've call finally went against him and the Yankee fans,

1439
01:31:34.850 --> 01:31:37.790
these classy fucking metropolitan.

1440
01:31:39.020 --> 01:31:44.020
We live in the Paris of United States littered the fucking field with fucking

1441
01:31:45.111 --> 01:31:49.790
trash.
All right,
so there you go sir.
So yes,
let me,
let me just finish.

1442
01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:52.090
He says,
uh,
Buh Buh,
Buh,
Buh.

1443
01:31:52.850 --> 01:31:57.850
I saw dude cut off an entire line of track it and throw beers at someone's car.

1444
01:31:58.730 --> 01:32:03.400
This is after the game
or maybe it was before the game.
Who knows?

1445
01:32:03.640 --> 01:32:07.670
And when confronted threatened the dude and said he was going to get is get.

1446
01:32:08.410 --> 01:32:13.410
And I also saw a bunch of Douche bags on the way on the way out on that shitty

1447
01:32:13.871 --> 01:32:18.871
two lane highway guilty as charged route one baby spiking bears at people's cars

1448
01:32:20.650 --> 01:32:25.650
in dead stopped traffic looking to the Ford looking forward to the podcast and

1449
01:32:25.961 --> 01:32:30.790
gloating all week.
Yeah,
yeah,
definitely.
Um,
yeah,
no,
if you go,

1450
01:32:30.791 --> 01:32:34.540
if you go around the league,
if you go around the league,
yeah.

1451
01:32:34.570 --> 01:32:38.740
A sports fans or if they're losing their,
yeah,
they are scumbags.

1452
01:32:39.820 --> 01:32:44.200
Nobody.
Nobody's a good loser,
you know.
But there are definitely worse ones.

1453
01:32:44.201 --> 01:32:48.820
And someone actually asked me
because uh,
it was one patriots fan.

1454
01:32:48.850 --> 01:32:53.470
I liked this guy.
He was pissed at all the pats fans that left.
Um,

1455
01:32:54.580 --> 01:32:57.940
and I know a lot of jets fans are go.
Yeah,
the fucking lame ass fucking fans.

1456
01:32:57.970 --> 01:33:02.500
It's,
I'll fuck you.
You Green faggots.
You do it too.
Everybody does it.

1457
01:33:02.980 --> 01:33:06.460
Everybody does it.
And the only those people who stay,

1458
01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:09.790
those are die hard fans.
And if you noticed,

1459
01:33:09.820 --> 01:33:13.420
it's like 26 fucking people.
Okay?

1460
01:33:13.510 --> 01:33:18.510
You know those years when your team is like one in 15 in 2014 and there's 26

1461
01:33:18.761 --> 01:33:23.761
people at the game and you know when your team is supposed to win some big

1462
01:33:23.831 --> 01:33:25.190
playoff game and then they,

1463
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:30.210
they fucking lose and you're so embarrassed and,
but there's in this,

1464
01:33:30.220 --> 01:33:33.610
just that same 26 people,
that's the die hard fan.

1465
01:33:34.750 --> 01:33:38.650
And the only reason why they make the stadiums that fucking big is for the good

1466
01:33:38.651 --> 01:33:43.390
times when all the fairweather fags show up.
That's why.
That's why.

1467
01:33:43.391 --> 01:33:47.440
And you,
you saw how many die hard fucking Patriot fans they are.

1468
01:33:47.560 --> 01:33:50.260
There's the same level as diehard jet fans.

1469
01:33:50.350 --> 01:33:53.950
I'm telling you with that little fireman walkout,
he wasn't,

1470
01:33:54.700 --> 01:33:59.140
would most jet fans walk out then that 45 be honest.

1471
01:33:59.141 --> 01:34:03.430
You Green country 45 to three d drubbing if that took place down in the meadow

1472
01:34:03.970 --> 01:34:07.450
lands,
Huh?
I know hoe do.
I would've stayed.
Oh,

1473
01:34:07.451 --> 01:34:12.130
I would have been there with the hero going,
don't worry,
I'm still here for you.

1474
01:34:12.220 --> 01:34:15.100
You're full of shit.
You're full of shit.

1475
01:34:15.101 --> 01:34:18.280
You would have been out there on the fucking awful Jersey Turnpike,

1476
01:34:19.690 --> 01:34:20.620
y'all would have left.

1477
01:34:20.770 --> 01:34:24.310
I got so many emails of people telling me they shut off the game and discussed

1478
01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:27.430
all that type of shit.
All right,
so shut the fuck up.

1479
01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:31.600
Most people are fair weather.
Fuck it,
fan.
So,
uh,

1480
01:34:32.860 --> 01:34:36.580
you know,
pet fans don't suck pat fans or just a,

1481
01:34:36.820 --> 01:34:41.530
they're an example of what a most fans are.
So I don't think you have any,

1482
01:34:41.531 --> 01:34:45.700
right.
Getting mad at an athlete.
If he doesn't sign your autograph,

1483
01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:50.620
sign you a fucking autograph.
You know,
because most of you,

1484
01:34:50.710 --> 01:34:55.710
if they're down 45 to three or 28 fucking 21 down by seven onside kick,

1485
01:34:58.341 --> 01:35:01.340
where the fuck were you?
You're already on route one,

1486
01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:05.540
so you have no right getting mad at him.
But uh,
that's what sports fans do.

1487
01:35:06.500 --> 01:35:09.110
They all suck.
Look at all those giant fans getting met.

1488
01:35:09.111 --> 01:35:12.350
They have the nerve to get mad at Tom Kauflin and at and ask if he should be

1489
01:35:12.351 --> 01:35:16.550
removed.
The guys like two and a half years removed,

1490
01:35:17.630 --> 01:35:22.630
three years removed from beating and undefeated 17 point favorite in the

1491
01:35:23.470 --> 01:35:27.260
Superbowl.
And now everybody's acting like the game passed him by.
MMM.

1492
01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:31.850
I Dunno.
So I know this has been pretty much all sports this week.
It had to be,

1493
01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:36.470
it had to be,
uh,
but Patriot fans.
Okay.

1494
01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:41.770
A lot of you as zoned out from watching ESPN and all the hype about this

1495
01:35:41.771 --> 01:35:42.604
patriots team,

1496
01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:46.510
you gotta understand what Belicheck did this year is he's rebuilding a fucking

1497
01:35:46.511 --> 01:35:51.460
monster.
And the fact that we were able to get as far as we did with the team,

1498
01:35:51.461 --> 01:35:55.960
that we had that awful fucking defense to somehow go 14 and fucking too,

1499
01:35:56.410 --> 01:35:58.240
when you let up 24 fucking points.

1500
01:35:58.241 --> 01:36:01.630
I can't wait to run into this fucking dickhead down at the comedy store,

1501
01:36:01.780 --> 01:36:05.710
another Patriot's fan who
was,

1502
01:36:05.780 --> 01:36:08.590
do you know what I hate wins when you have a sports debate in somebody who has a

1503
01:36:08.591 --> 01:36:12.970
point.
Okay.
And not only did they not wait for you to finish,

1504
01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:17.330
they say their point and then they just keep repeating it.
He goes,

1505
01:36:17.331 --> 01:36:18.470
patriots are going to win it,
man.

1506
01:36:18.500 --> 01:36:20.300
They're going to win the fucking super bowl bell.

1507
01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:23.030
Bill Belichick has got these guys.
I go,
wait a minute to wait a minute.

1508
01:36:23.300 --> 01:36:27.110
That letting up like the defense is like last in everything in the league,

1509
01:36:27.111 --> 01:36:28.140
three quarters of season he goes,

1510
01:36:28.141 --> 01:36:31.730
stats don't mean not to stats on me not to and I might do the letting up.

1511
01:36:31.731 --> 01:36:33.620
24 to 26 jack told me nothing.

1512
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:37.430
She had told me not to now do to stats don't mean everything.

1513
01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:40.610
I love Peyton manning.
They don't mean everything,

1514
01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:45.170
but you know you can't ignore that.
I can't wait to fucking run into that guy.

1515
01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:48.540
I'm just going to walk up to him.
We stare at told me no eating.

1516
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:53.120
She has told me 93 and of course he won't remember and then I'll just look like

1517
01:36:53.121 --> 01:36:55.340
a psycho.
Is he drinking again?

1518
01:36:55.520 --> 01:36:58.700
Speaking of which people I am 93 fucking days,

1519
01:36:59.690 --> 01:37:03.470
93 fucking days into uh,

1520
01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:08.270
into this hundred day John.
I got seven.
Oh,
actually,
I'm sorry,

1521
01:37:08.271 --> 01:37:12.200
I'm 94 days to go.
So next week,
the Monday morning podcast,

1522
01:37:12.230 --> 01:37:17.120
I will be a hundred days in and a,
I'm actually going to the Bruins,
uh,

1523
01:37:17.210 --> 01:37:21.830
La Kings.
So just in case you think I'm going to retire as a sports fan,

1524
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:28.500
uh,
I'm not,
I have an odd sense of fucking relief.
I Dunno.

1525
01:37:28.510 --> 01:37:33.100
Maybe this podcast was like Cathartic.
I know.
I have no idea what and um,

1526
01:37:35.240 --> 01:37:38.120
I dunno.
I Dunno.
Am I going to be able to watch it next week?

1527
01:37:41.120 --> 01:37:44.860
I think Jay,
I think rex Ryan might be that,
you know,
when they say,
I tell you,

1528
01:37:44.861 --> 01:37:46.980
hey buddy,
if he played for you,
you'd fucking love them.
You know,

1529
01:37:46.981 --> 01:37:51.060
when they say it about off Samuelson and I say,
no,
no,
I wouldn't.
Uh,

1530
01:37:52.100 --> 01:37:53.090
there's something about rex.

1531
01:37:53.120 --> 01:37:56.250
He reminds me of all the meat had friends I had when we used to go out,

1532
01:37:56.251 --> 01:37:58.860
drink it when I was younger,
you know?

1533
01:38:00.010 --> 01:38:00.550
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

1534
01:38:00.550 --> 01:38:05.530
<v 7>But he's very hard to like,
he's very fucking hard to like,
you know,</v>

1535
01:38:05.531 --> 01:38:07.000
he's fat.
I,
and I was really,

1536
01:38:09.630 --> 01:38:12.260
you know what it was about that guy.
Did you guys,
I don't know if it was made,

1537
01:38:12.261 --> 01:38:16.920
did you guys notice that he was losing weight rapidly the entire year because of

1538
01:38:16.921 --> 01:38:21.921
that lap band surgery and then right after that patriots loss,

1539
01:38:22.071 --> 01:38:25.530
he kind of leveled off for half a second and maybe put on a few pounds.

1540
01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:26.900
Did you notice that?

1541
01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:30.840
Do you realize like the level of m and m's that guy was eating,
you know,

1542
01:38:30.900 --> 01:38:33.170
after his,
I don't give up,
play them again like that.

1543
01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:37.950
[inaudible] he was trying to fucking calm down his mind.
Um,

1544
01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:41.190
that was one thing I was looking at.
I was like,
Oh man,

1545
01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:46.280
I hope this guy is losing his fucking mind and I just really don't want to lose

1546
01:38:47.281 --> 01:38:51.800
to these guys.
And we did.
And Ah,
with fucking hurt me.

1547
01:38:51.801 --> 01:38:55.580
It was like the end of Braveheart,
except I did cry out

1548
01:38:59.210 --> 01:39:03.200
and I didn't yell freedom,
but it definitely began with an f word.
All right,

1549
01:39:03.201 --> 01:39:04.600
there we go.
That's the end of that bullshit.

1550
01:39:04.610 --> 01:39:06.830
So let's get on with the other rest of the podcast people.

1551
01:39:06.831 --> 01:39:09.890
I am going to be in Arlington,
Texas.
Oh,
how funny is this?

1552
01:39:09.891 --> 01:39:12.200
I actually have an opportunity to go to the Superbowl this year,

1553
01:39:12.201 --> 01:39:15.950
which just trait change drastically because this jets one,

1554
01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:17.510
not that I don't have a ticket,

1555
01:39:17.511 --> 01:39:22.340
but there's no fucking way I'm going to go there if the jets are in it.
Uh,

1556
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:25.820
I actually,
I might go cause I think I'm gradually getting past this shit,

1557
01:39:26.890 --> 01:39:31.370
you know,
come on Super Bowl and fucking Dallas.
That'd be awesome.
Um,

1558
01:39:32.230 --> 01:39:34.610
yeah,
and that's also,
you know,
if I'm back on the sauce,

1559
01:39:34.611 --> 01:39:38.270
that could be a really good fucking time.
You know,
by the way,

1560
01:39:38.271 --> 01:39:42.320
is that jet fan who's a fireman?
Is he actually a fireman?
And if he is,

1561
01:39:42.530 --> 01:39:47.210
when exactly does he fight fires because he's on all the home and away games.

1562
01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:52.370
How much money is he making as a firefighter that he can afford to do that?

1563
01:39:52.670 --> 01:39:55.570
Is it one of those gay things where he's living the way that the,

1564
01:39:55.571 --> 01:39:56.870
the fucking team,

1565
01:39:57.650 --> 01:40:01.010
the ownership or he's one of our super fans and the,

1566
01:40:01.011 --> 01:40:04.550
he gets like free season tickets.
Um,

1567
01:40:05.390 --> 01:40:08.120
is he part of the nine 11 clause?
Is that what it is?

1568
01:40:08.121 --> 01:40:11.510
Because he has a fireman hat on that,
you know,
they're like,
okay,

1569
01:40:11.511 --> 01:40:14.180
well we can't make this guy buy tickets.
He's a firefighter.

1570
01:40:14.181 --> 01:40:16.490
We all feel fucking horrific after nine 11,

1571
01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:20.480
let's fucking Hook this guy up at guys like one of the luckiest sports fans
ever.

1572
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:23.840
Although I do notice they always stick them down in the corner of the end zone.

1573
01:40:23.870 --> 01:40:28.220
They don't quite hook them up on the 50 yard line.
Do they?
Um,

1574
01:40:29.680 --> 01:40:33.280
is he a fireman?
I have no idea.
I've been making fun of that guy all weekend.

1575
01:40:33.490 --> 01:40:37.070
I do know that he's very close with his boyfriend who puts them on his shoulder.

1576
01:40:39.130 --> 01:40:40.870
I still maintain that jet fans.

1577
01:40:40.871 --> 01:40:44.430
I will not back down on that if that was my fucking son.
Don't you ever,

1578
01:40:44.650 --> 01:40:47.710
ever put another man on your fucking shoulders with fireman's hat?

1579
01:40:47.770 --> 01:40:49.840
Do you understand me?
If you got a fucking mustache,

1580
01:40:49.930 --> 01:40:52.760
I would never talk to you again.
Do you understand me?
Huh?
Hey,

1581
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:57.190
fucking talking to you.
As long as you carry my fucking last name.

1582
01:40:57.880 --> 01:41:02.230
All right.
They go to your room and think about it.
Um,
all right,

1583
01:41:02.231 --> 01:41:03.460
let's try and get something out of here.

1584
01:41:04.450 --> 01:41:08.620
Let's try to get something fucking going on about this.
Uh,
right.
Where are we?

1585
01:41:08.621 --> 01:41:12.460
Where are we?
Oh,
here's a revenge story in this one is disgusting.
All right.

1586
01:41:12.461 --> 01:41:15.100
If there's any women actually still listening to this podcast and for,

1587
01:41:15.101 --> 01:41:19.900
I did fucking an hour about a goddamn football game.
All right.
Revenge story.
Uh,

1588
01:41:19.901 --> 01:41:22.420
and I wrote gross in parentheses.
Okay.
Um,

1589
01:41:22.450 --> 01:41:25.180
I don't know if you still do those revenge stories anymore,

1590
01:41:25.181 --> 01:41:28.420
but I thought I'd pass mine along anyway.
All right.

1591
01:41:28.421 --> 01:41:31.870
I had this roommate in college who would chew loudly off.
That's,

1592
01:41:31.930 --> 01:41:33.910
that was one of my big pet peeves in life.

1593
01:41:34.060 --> 01:41:36.640
If you're a fucking adult and you eat with your mouth open,

1594
01:41:36.641 --> 01:41:39.040
I really think I should be able to leak legally.

1595
01:41:39.100 --> 01:41:43.600
Fucking stab you in the juggler with the utensil you're eating with.

1596
01:41:43.690 --> 01:41:47.590
Be it a chop stick.
A fork,
a fucking spoon.
I'm going to fucking spoon in there.

1597
01:41:47.680 --> 01:41:52.630
I will butter knife.
Slowly.
Fucking saw my way into that.

1598
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:56.050
Um,
he would chew too loudly.

1599
01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:59.530
Scream into the phone when I was trying to watch TV.

1600
01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:05.040
Leave the toilet seat up when there were lady over and generally gross out my

1601
01:42:06.671 --> 01:42:11.671
girlfriend with his caveman like habits between that and his constant messages.

1602
01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:18.730
Uh,
I was having to clean up.
I got fed up after awhile.
I'm talking,

1603
01:42:18.731 --> 01:42:22.540
did nothing.
So I had to get creative since we shared a bathroom,

1604
01:42:22.541 --> 01:42:27.100
we also shared the toilet paper.
All right people,

1605
01:42:27.310 --> 01:42:31.960
I'm giving you an opportunity to hit stop right now.
All right,
you can hit stop.

1606
01:42:31.961 --> 01:42:33.520
You can hit pause.
You can fast forward.

1607
01:42:33.521 --> 01:42:36.370
It's probably gonna take me another minute.
Okay.
Have you done it?

1608
01:42:36.610 --> 01:42:38.710
Cause I'm going to start reading in three,
two.

1609
01:42:40.090 --> 01:42:42.160
I took the role into my room,

1610
01:42:42.220 --> 01:42:47.220
unraveled it and with my girlfriends assistant drip,

1611
01:42:47.581 --> 01:42:49.750
some leftover Tj's on it.

1612
01:42:52.900 --> 01:42:57.070
Let me read that sentence again.
I took a role into my room,
unraveled it,

1613
01:42:57.430 --> 01:43:02.200
and with my girlfriends,
assistant assistance drip,
some leftover.

1614
01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:03.513
TJ's on it.

1615
01:43:04.690 --> 01:43:09.690
I made sure to space it out every few sheets so that it was throughout the role

1616
01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:16.480
in,
in a small enough quantity that wasn't obvious.

1617
01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:18.820
Just exactly how did you do that?

1618
01:43:20.910 --> 01:43:24.550
Will you fucking choking your cock on choking,

1619
01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:27.550
choking on chunking,
chunking?
Is that what you were doing?

1620
01:43:28.210 --> 01:43:30.970
Did you have a fucking Turkey based or this is disgusting.

1621
01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:33.850
This is fucking disgusting.

1622
01:43:34.450 --> 01:43:39.010
So he left a small enough quantity so it wasn't obvious the satisfaction of

1623
01:43:39.011 --> 01:43:42.290
knowing that when he white,

1624
01:43:42.310 --> 01:43:45.430
he would be rubbing my semen into his ass,

1625
01:43:48.460 --> 01:43:53.300
made the annoying habits far less annoying after.
After that,

1626
01:43:53.301 --> 01:43:55.420
whenever he would chew loudly or be annoying,

1627
01:43:55.430 --> 01:44:00.430
my girl and I would think of what we'd done and just start laughing though that

1628
01:44:01.101 --> 01:44:05.270
knowing that I had planted my seed inside of him,
so to speak,

1629
01:44:06.350 --> 01:44:07.850
highly recommended this to,

1630
01:44:07.851 --> 01:44:11.420
I highly recommend this to anyone who has an annoying rent.
A roommate.

1631
01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:16.970
Ed has never been tested a Po as and as tested negative for HIV.

1632
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:19.370
Dude,
that is fucking disgusting.
First of all,

1633
01:44:19.400 --> 01:44:22.080
how do you know when he went in there and wipe disasters?

1634
01:44:22.610 --> 01:44:27.350
Why are you thinking he's sticking his finger up his ass?
And,
uh,

1635
01:44:27.351 --> 01:44:29.780
what did you do when you went in and had to take a dump?

1636
01:44:30.970 --> 01:44:31.220
<v 14>Yeah.</v>

1637
01:44:31.220 --> 01:44:33.350
<v 7>You obviously brought in some different toilet paper.</v>

1638
01:44:34.740 --> 01:44:39.150
Did you have like your ear up to a glass waiting to hear the sound of fucking

1639
01:44:39.151 --> 01:44:40.620
shit hitting the toilet water.

1640
01:44:41.640 --> 01:44:45.990
And how did your girlfriend bring you to climax with that toilet paper right

1641
01:44:45.991 --> 01:44:49.080
there?
She just rub you out like it was a job,

1642
01:44:50.810 --> 01:44:52.700
Eh,
let's just fucking disgusting man.

1643
01:44:52.701 --> 01:44:56.150
That's really one of the creepy ones I've ever gotten a youtube videos this
week.

1644
01:44:56.151 --> 01:45:01.110
I only have one of them.
Um,
because I,

1645
01:45:01.111 --> 01:45:05.410
I seriously,
uh,
like I said,
I was flying back from Atlantic city and I,

1646
01:45:05.411 --> 01:45:10.070
I didn't have time to go through all the youtube,
so I apologize.
I only have one,

1647
01:45:10.460 --> 01:45:14.000
uh,
the left rights.
I'm on crack.
It's actually a really cool music video.

1648
01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:18.230
A silly song.
Uh,
maybe you can attest to this sort of what?
Happy one.
Let me,

1649
01:45:18.231 --> 01:45:22.070
let me do the,
I've got a couple of advice and then I'm going to tap out here.

1650
01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:27.770
Uh,
all right,
advice.
I know this girl.
I've known her for a bit.
Uh,

1651
01:45:27.771 --> 01:45:31.160
we're friends.
We've been for a while.
Okay,
now this one.

1652
01:45:31.161 --> 01:45:33.950
You know how everybody always trashes me for the way I fucking read.

1653
01:45:33.951 --> 01:45:35.870
I know I suck at reading,
but I have to let you know.

1654
01:45:35.871 --> 01:45:40.100
This is all in lower case and there's absolutely no punctuation whatsoever.

1655
01:45:40.101 --> 01:45:43.130
I don't know if this guy text messaged this or what,

1656
01:45:43.131 --> 01:45:47.570
but this is not my fucking fault.
Let me try my best to read this.
All right,
Bill.

1657
01:45:47.571 --> 01:45:50.900
I know this girl.
I've known her for a bit and we're friends.
No period.

1658
01:45:51.170 --> 01:45:55.130
We've been for awhile,
comma.
Anyway,

1659
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:59.990
about a month ago,
I asked her out on a date and she said yes,
comma,

1660
01:46:00.710 --> 01:46:04.190
continuing the sentence.
He doesn't have periods.
He just says calm as lowercase.

1661
01:46:04.280 --> 01:46:08.630
I took her out and we had fun.
No period.
We talked.
Shit

1662
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:15.110
was Hunky Dory.
No Comma,
we kissed it.
No period.
It was awesome.

1663
01:46:15.710 --> 01:46:20.180
First date,
it was an awesome first date.
Hey,
there's a period,

1664
01:46:20.210 --> 01:46:22.130
no capital letter.
Then I,

1665
01:46:22.340 --> 01:46:26.840
I barely fucking heard from her.
No.
Period.

1666
01:46:26.841 --> 01:46:30.620
I was running around like a fucking jackass.
No period.

1667
01:46:31.130 --> 01:46:34.730
Just trying to talk to her,
Eh,
I'm sorry.
The,
I guess it keeps going.

1668
01:46:34.731 --> 01:46:37.880
Just trying to talk to her and when we would talk it was fine.
Oh,

1669
01:46:38.080 --> 01:46:43.070
there's a period I was beating myself up going crazy.
No,

1670
01:46:43.071 --> 01:46:46.700
period.
I was some piece of shit.

1671
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:52.920
Anyway,
I pulled myself together and I asked her out again.
She once again said,

1672
01:46:52.921 --> 01:46:57.630
yes.
Awesome.
Right.
Well not your fucking lack of punctuation.

1673
01:46:57.631 --> 01:47:01.590
That's not awesome.
So we go out again,
went cool again.

1674
01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:05.820
I didn't kiss her this time.
I don't know it was just off,

1675
01:47:06.180 --> 01:47:10.230
but any way,
comma,
that was no punctuation and all of that.

1676
01:47:10.231 --> 01:47:15.150
You fucking Dick.
Once again,
I was fucking,
once again,

1677
01:47:15.151 --> 01:47:18.510
I fucking didn't hear a thing,
so I said,
fuck it.

1678
01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:21.810
I don't need this right now.
And we just went back to being friends.

1679
01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:24.930
Never talked about it.
Just let it lay.

1680
01:47:27.040 --> 01:47:31.170
Fucking see double at this point.
Anyway,
lately I've been talking to her a lot.

1681
01:47:31.171 --> 01:47:34.320
Like I said,
like I said,
we're friends,

1682
01:47:34.321 --> 01:47:37.980
but she's very clearly been flirting with me and I honestly have been flirting

1683
01:47:37.981 --> 01:47:41.940
back.
I still like the girl.
No,
period.
No,
nothing,

1684
01:47:42.450 --> 01:47:47.220
but I just don't know if it's worth it,
you know,

1685
01:47:47.310 --> 01:47:50.640
period.
No question mark.
She's got a lot of drama.

1686
01:47:50.641 --> 01:47:53.940
She's one of these girls that gets drunk at a party and cries.

1687
01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:55.740
Then ask people if she's pretty,

1688
01:47:56.940 --> 01:48:01.620
which she really fucking is like really hot dot,
dot,
dot,
dot,
dot.

1689
01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:03.450
Ah,
but I do like her,

1690
01:48:03.451 --> 01:48:06.300
I just don't know if I should put myself through this shit again.

1691
01:48:06.301 --> 01:48:08.400
What do you think bill?
I legitimately,

1692
01:48:08.580 --> 01:48:12.100
legitimately would like your advice slash opinion.
Um,

1693
01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:16.260
okay.
The first thing I would do,
I'd get some sort of spellcheck.

1694
01:48:17.340 --> 01:48:19.200
I would get some sort of uh,
um,

1695
01:48:20.160 --> 01:48:24.600
phonics or some sort of shit to teach you how to write.
All right?
People,

1696
01:48:24.601 --> 01:48:27.990
I know I suck at reading out loud,
but can,
can you do me a fucking solid?

1697
01:48:28.650 --> 01:48:32.520
I'm not reading any more fucking emails that,
that are like this.
All right.

1698
01:48:32.770 --> 01:48:37.710
Because this is literally is I'm starting to lose my fucking eyesight.
Um,

1699
01:48:38.100 --> 01:48:41.730
so what do I think?
Yeah.
Okay.
This is what I think.

1700
01:48:41.731 --> 01:48:44.520
I think you should definitely not get into a relationship with this girl,

1701
01:48:44.521 --> 01:48:47.370
this girl,
this girl is a fucking nightmare.
All right?

1702
01:48:47.371 --> 01:48:48.750
There's all kinds of red flags.

1703
01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:51.030
I don't know what happened to her and I can tell you right now,

1704
01:48:51.180 --> 01:48:53.910
you don't want to find out what's happening to her,
what happened to her.

1705
01:48:53.911 --> 01:48:58.800
You don't want to find out in that you don't want to have feelings for this
girl,

1706
01:48:59.490 --> 01:48:59.851
all right?

1707
01:48:59.851 --> 01:49:04.851
And when the other fucking bag of shit hits the floor and your heart is

1708
01:49:05.641 --> 01:49:07.170
underneath that,
you,
you don't,
you don't.

1709
01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:09.510
You don't let a girl like this break your heart,
all right?

1710
01:49:09.540 --> 01:49:12.930
You can see it from a mile away.
She is a fucking mess.

1711
01:49:14.160 --> 01:49:17.010
All right?
There's plenty of great girls out there.
You're a young guy.

1712
01:49:17.011 --> 01:49:21.870
Go find one.
All right?
Find a girl,
you know,
make a list of shit.

1713
01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:25.050
All right?
One of the big things,

1714
01:49:25.051 --> 01:49:29.760
if you want to find a really good girl is find one who has a great relationship

1715
01:49:29.761 --> 01:49:33.480
with her parents.
Hopefully they're still together,
all right?

1716
01:49:33.481 --> 01:49:36.150
That's another good thing.
Start with that,
but as I sit in there,

1717
01:49:36.330 --> 01:49:39.630
you have created,
they've got low self esteem issues,

1718
01:49:39.780 --> 01:49:41.130
you're going to kill a decade,

1719
01:49:41.190 --> 01:49:44.210
are your fucking life trying to build them up and it,

1720
01:49:44.220 --> 01:49:47.860
you know what it's going to be.
It's going to be fucking exhausting.
All right?

1721
01:49:47.890 --> 01:49:52.060
And then because she doesn't think she's pretty,
she might act out sexually,

1722
01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:54.640
um,
for some sort of,
you know,

1723
01:49:55.740 --> 01:49:55.950
<v 14>okay.</v>

1724
01:49:55.950 --> 01:50:00.890
<v 7>I don't know,
like
Geez,
I just really have an hour and six minutes in here.
Just,</v>

1725
01:50:00.891 --> 01:50:03.860
you know,
some sort of affirmation that she is pretty okay.

1726
01:50:03.861 --> 01:50:07.700
So what do I think you should do?
All right,
well,
if you're a well adjusted guy,

1727
01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:11.780
you'll just walk away from the situation and say that I'm not gonna just banger

1728
01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:14.090
and use that as a fucking Nacho.

1729
01:50:14.091 --> 01:50:17.510
My bed to make my ego feel good and I'm not going to hurt this person.

1730
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:22.760
But if you're,
how most people are your age,
I would just say bang her and then,

1731
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:27.390
uh,
I dunno,
it's,
it's going to be ugly.

1732
01:50:27.420 --> 01:50:29.100
If you want to bang this girl,
I got to tell you,

1733
01:50:29.101 --> 01:50:31.530
don't let your heart get involved.
At a,

1734
01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:37.090
I dunno,
not,
not having seen her.

1735
01:50:37.280 --> 01:50:39.920
I've seen how watch she is and being older and more mature,

1736
01:50:39.921 --> 01:50:44.230
I would say just walk away and go find some,
well adjusted hottie that's,

1737
01:50:44.240 --> 01:50:47.900
unless you just want to bank somebody,
but then you can do that.

1738
01:50:47.930 --> 01:50:49.760
You know what it's about this thing you don't want.
I don't like.

1739
01:50:50.120 --> 01:50:53.150
There's too much fucking history.
You gotta be able to leave.

1740
01:50:53.250 --> 01:50:56.570
You gotta be able to fucking go out the side door.

1741
01:50:57.380 --> 01:51:00.170
If you just gonna to bank somebody,
you can't have this.
Well,

1742
01:51:00.171 --> 01:51:02.930
we were friends at first and then it became romantic.

1743
01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:05.360
Then we went back to being friends and then we fucked.

1744
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:09.980
And it's just a fucking nightmare.
Yeah.
I'd find someone else to fuck.

1745
01:51:09.981 --> 01:51:12.060
But if you don't give a shit,
yeah,
I banger.

1746
01:51:12.170 --> 01:51:16.760
But by no means don't develop any sort of feelings for her.
All right,

1747
01:51:17.270 --> 01:51:20.030
there you go.
There's my advice.
I'm going to do one more and then that's it.

1748
01:51:21.190 --> 01:51:25.380
All right.
This one has punctuation.
So if I fuck up,
this one is on me.
Uh,

1749
01:51:25.490 --> 01:51:26.540
hey bill,
first of all,

1750
01:51:26.541 --> 01:51:29.200
if I want to thank you for your breakup advice I listened to.

1751
01:51:29.210 --> 01:51:30.590
I think this is just a thank you here.

1752
01:51:30.740 --> 01:51:33.650
I listened to the podcast a few weeks ago and heard this guy's story about

1753
01:51:33.651 --> 01:51:36.230
getting dumped on Christmas Eve.
Oddly enough,

1754
01:51:36.231 --> 01:51:40.160
I was also at the end of a relationship with a girl who had,
who had had a kid.

1755
01:51:40.730 --> 01:51:43.760
She waited until a week after new year's when I was out of town,

1756
01:51:44.450 --> 01:51:48.170
a center flowers because I could tell something was off.

1757
01:51:49.670 --> 01:51:53.660
Something was up.
I mean,
and I had been gone a lot recently.

1758
01:51:53.661 --> 01:51:57.200
She called when I got off work and confirmed my suspicion.

1759
01:51:57.770 --> 01:52:01.520
I don't need to get into all that shit.
It happened.
And uh,

1760
01:52:02.330 --> 01:52:05.840
the point is I just listened to your podcast after it all happened and decided

1761
01:52:06.410 --> 01:52:10.870
that's how it had to be.
No point in screwing anything else up in my life.
No,

1762
01:52:10.880 --> 01:52:12.560
no point in worrying about anything.

1763
01:52:12.561 --> 01:52:16.340
Get back to the gym and focus on finishing school and my career.
That's right.

1764
01:52:16.341 --> 01:52:19.880
There you go.
There you go.
That's a great fucking move.

1765
01:52:19.881 --> 01:52:24.410
That's a self esteem move right there.
You're going to find somebody else.

1766
01:52:24.411 --> 01:52:27.690
You're going to get somebody better.
Go get in great shape and uh,

1767
01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:31.520
get your career going.
Phenomenal.
Fucking move.
Uh,

1768
01:52:31.550 --> 01:52:35.090
thanks for the words of encouragement.
I think they did some good big fan man.

1769
01:52:35.091 --> 01:52:39.140
I bought you a DVD and I'll continue a support of the podcast.
Well,

1770
01:52:39.141 --> 01:52:41.730
thank you very much.
I appreciate that.
And uh,

1771
01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:45.710
thank you to everyone who's been listening to my podcast.
And again,

1772
01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:49.850
congratulations to the jets,
their organization and the fans.
You deserved it.

1773
01:52:50.150 --> 01:52:51.710
You went into our stadium,

1774
01:52:51.740 --> 01:52:55.940
you kicked our ass to the point that all you saw how many true Patriot fans

1775
01:52:56.090 --> 01:52:58.910
they're fucking are.
Um,

1776
01:52:59.090 --> 01:53:02.210
but there are just as many true jet fans to be honest with yourself.

1777
01:53:02.240 --> 01:53:06.440
Be honest with yourselves
when they suck.
Do you watch them?

1778
01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:10.940
Do you think?
I watched a Celtic game from like 2002 to 2006.

1779
01:53:11.390 --> 01:53:14.810
I didn't.
All right.
I jumped right back on that bandwagon.

1780
01:53:14.840 --> 01:53:18.590
I am a die hard Bruin fan.
Die Hard Patriot Fan.

1781
01:53:18.620 --> 01:53:22.130
I was a die hard red sox fan.
But uh,
you know,

1782
01:53:22.131 --> 01:53:26.930
what happened was they won the world series and I felt like a degenerate gambler

1783
01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:31.610
who finally made a big score and I just walked away from the table and I was

1784
01:53:31.611 --> 01:53:34.640
like,
that's it.
I'm up.
I'm buying my little fucking houseboat.

1785
01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:38.360
I'm going to throw down the anchor and drink Pina coladas the rest of my life.

1786
01:53:38.361 --> 01:53:40.010
See you later.
Thanks for the memories.

1787
01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:44.630
And I haven't been able to get back into them,
um,

1788
01:53:45.410 --> 01:53:50.320
since I gotta be honest with you.
And uh,
who else has left and the Celtics,

1789
01:53:50.580 --> 01:53:53.750
the Celtics,
I got back into the Celtics.
You know,
I'm not a big basketball fan.

1790
01:53:53.751 --> 01:53:57.110
I'm not a big professional basketball fan for the simple fact that the final

1791
01:53:57.111 --> 01:54:01.760
three minutes takes two hours and 17 minutes.
I don't like how they travel.

1792
01:54:01.761 --> 01:54:05.150
And that's all I,
they travel all the time,
all the fucking time.

1793
01:54:05.151 --> 01:54:06.080
When I want you to NBA game,

1794
01:54:06.081 --> 01:54:09.050
that's all I do is I just sit there watching both teams,
even my team,

1795
01:54:09.051 --> 01:54:09.884
and I just go,

1796
01:54:11.260 --> 01:54:12.650
<v 5>that's a fucking,
how do they,</v>

1797
01:54:13.700 --> 01:54:17.780
how do they not sit the fuck the guy fucking took that was three and a half

1798
01:54:17.781 --> 01:54:20.270
steps travel.

1799
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:25.220
Uh,
that that's,

1800
01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:26.910
<v 7>you know,
I'm just not into it,
but uh,</v>

1801
01:54:26.911 --> 01:54:30.510
I do like it when the Celtics and the Lakers are good.
That's when it's great.

1802
01:54:30.511 --> 01:54:33.600
That's the rivalry.
I like fucking watching the same way.

1803
01:54:33.780 --> 01:54:38.640
It sucks if the Canadians are awesome in the Bruins are bad or the other way

1804
01:54:38.641 --> 01:54:43.050
around.
I don't want the Canadians to suck.
I want it to be awesome.
The Bruins,

1805
01:54:43.051 --> 01:54:46.440
to be honest,
I like the fucking colliding.
Add a and that's it.

1806
01:54:46.441 --> 01:54:48.600
And Patriots fans keeping fucking heads up,

1807
01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:53.370
especially the 26 year who actually stuck around to the end of the fucking game.

1808
01:54:54.630 --> 01:54:55.890
All right,
keep your heads up.

1809
01:54:56.850 --> 01:55:00.420
Bill Belicheck is fucking the best guide them coach.
And um,

1810
01:55:01.350 --> 01:55:04.680
you know what he did starting for rookies on defense,

1811
01:55:04.950 --> 01:55:06.810
what he did this year was fucking phenomenal.

1812
01:55:07.050 --> 01:55:12.030
We laid an egg in the worst possible time,
but uh,
you know,

1813
01:55:12.031 --> 01:55:15.540
don't be a Douche and puts your pad skier away for the fucking year.
All right?

1814
01:55:15.541 --> 01:55:19.200
Don't be like that.
Don't be like,
or be like that.
Who gives a fuck?

1815
01:55:19.201 --> 01:55:22.050
You think these athletes give a shit about you?
You know,

1816
01:55:22.110 --> 01:55:26.430
they did not going to walk by in and fucking airport with their fucking $10,000

1817
01:55:26.431 --> 01:55:27.690
headphones on.
Actually.

1818
01:55:27.691 --> 01:55:30.420
They're not even going to walk by you on the head and at the fucking airport

1819
01:55:30.570 --> 01:55:35.310
cause they got their own goddamn plane
at Jesus.
You know,

1820
01:55:35.311 --> 01:55:38.670
this podcast could really be endless because I never run out of shit to bitch

1821
01:55:38.671 --> 01:55:42.120
about.
And that's a podcast for this week.
Uh,
that's it.

1822
01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:46.710
I will talk to you next week.
God bless all he is.
Even the jet fans,

1823
01:55:46.711 --> 01:55:50.190
you fucking green cons and everybody go fuck yourself.
I'll see ya.
