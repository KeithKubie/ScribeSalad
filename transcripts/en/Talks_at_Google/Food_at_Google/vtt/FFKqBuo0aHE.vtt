00:00:06.714 --> 00:00:07.880
APRAJITA JAIN: Hi, everyone.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:08.610
I'm Aprajita.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.180
I work for Executive Client
Summits and Ad Sales.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.230
And more importantly, I'm a
passionate cook, a foodie,

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.240
and also a big supporter
of Akshaya Patra,

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.090
a nonprofit organization that
enabled Chef's visit here

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.761
today.

00:00:21.761 --> 00:00:23.260
So thank you so
much, Akshaya Patra.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.551
And thank you so much, Chef,
for coming and visiting us

00:00:25.551 --> 00:00:27.180
at Google today.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.160
Before we start, I
want to remind everyone

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.780
to please be mindful of
Chef's attendance here.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.990
He is a very special guest.

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.660
We want to ensure that he has
a very special experience here

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.720
at Google.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.314
So while you can feel free
to take pictures and videos

00:00:40.314 --> 00:00:41.730
while we're doing
the talk, please

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.390
don't jump up afterwards
to ensue a selfie frenzy.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.430
You will have plenty of
pictures from in here.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.055
And then we have
videographers who will

00:00:49.055 --> 00:00:51.390
be recording the talk for you.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.790
Every one of us at
Google likes to work

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.410
on projects that work in many
different areas of our field

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.040
but also help
billions of people.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.750
So all of our products,
including Gmail, Search, Maps,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.590
YouTube, they touch
billions of lives.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.780
But Chef Kapoor, you have
touched billions of lives

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.090
through their heart
and into their stomach.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.850
So we are very, very happy
to have you here and ask

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.820
you some questions about
yourself, your career,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.090
but also your involvement
with Akshaya Patra.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.610
And I will share a
story about myself,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.710
how I got involved
with Akshaya Patra.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.380
So in 2009, I was
visiting India.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.520
My parents live in Germany.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.519
They were also visiting.

00:01:30.519 --> 00:01:32.959
And one morning, my dad
woke up at 6 o'clock.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:33.750
And he wakes me up.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.450
He's like, Aprajita, I need
you to wake up and go somewhere

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:37.384
with me.

00:01:37.384 --> 00:01:38.550
I said, it's 6 o'clock, Dad.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.840
Come on, I'm on a vacation.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.340
He said, no, I'll
take you somewhere

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.620
that will change
your life forever.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.640
And I said, OK, fine.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.840
So I woke up.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.790
He took me to the Jaipur
kitchen of Akshaya Patra.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.055
They have a facilities in
the outskirts of Jaipur,

00:01:51.055 --> 00:01:53.040
very large facilities.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.050
And he gave me a
tour of the kitchens

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.920
there and of all the people that
work there every single day.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.080
And he made me meet the
leadership team there.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.510
They were telling me about
their cause and what all

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.840
that they've been doing to
take Akshaya Patra to where

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.870
it is today.

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:12.780
The one thing that struck me
is that everybody working over

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.012
there was so selfless.

00:02:14.012 --> 00:02:15.720
They weren't doing it
for their own good.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.760
But they were doing
it for the good

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.910
of the kids that are served
these Akshaya Patra meals.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:25.290
This is an organization that has
its presence in over 11 states

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.100
now.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.620
They feed 1.6 million children
every single day across India.

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.302
And the only reason is,
if kids come to school

00:02:34.302 --> 00:02:35.760
and get that free
meal, the parents

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.650
are willing to send
their kids to school.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.690
So there's no child
labor anymore.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.070
And the kids get
a nutrition meal

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.910
and get their education
throughout until they graduate.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.580
A lot of those case studies
have actually now started

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.870
to get their first jobs
and are volunteering back

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.140
at Akshaya Patra.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.960
So that's how my story evolved
and how I got involved.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.520
And ever since, I've been
a supporter of this cause.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.520
But I want to know
from you, how did you

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.930
get involved in Akshaya Patra?

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.474
When did you hear about it?

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:03.390
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Right.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.800
Thank you, Aprajita.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.850
Good morning, everyone.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.550
So she's a passionate cook.

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.354
I'm passionate and a cook.

00:03:10.354 --> 00:03:12.250
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.060
SANJEEV KAPOOR: And so my
story with Akshaya Patra-- see,

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.840
Akshaya Patra is as a--

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.140
I know this ball that is there.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.850
It's in our--

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.380
I had heard stories of that it's
a pot which never goes empty,

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.640
and all of that.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.590
So when I heard
of Akshaya Patra,

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.450
I said, OK, I have to know
what is it being used for.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.170
What is it?

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.420
It's a great branding thing.

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.890
It was something
which was perfect.

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.980
But what are these guys doing?

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.110
And so I came to know,
OK, this is what they do.

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.740
And then I was involved
with the Midday Meal

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:57.640
program of government.

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.430
And they wanted me to do
something about the food,

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.780
how to make it healthy,
what kind of calories,

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.780
what nutrition, grammages,
and all of that.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.150
So I was doing that.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.500
And then there was ISKCON.

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.640
They were doing their bit.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.209
And they were moving in
all different directions.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.190
And I would say, oh, wow,
everyone is doing this.

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.410
So whatever I could do, I would
talk about this a little bit

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.830
but in a very unstructured way.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:37.170
And I realized that, as I
started to grow my businesses,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.130
that food has given me so much.

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.860
Whatever I have, it's
thanks to power of food.

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.250
So that is the
importance of food.

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.830
So people ask me what
does food mean to me.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.230
And I say, food is my life.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.410
That's what it is.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.640
So if it is so
important, then I have

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.840
to make sure that
I have to do more,

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:03.730
use the power of food in
a more meaningful way.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.660
So we started doing
things on our own.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.900
feed at times some
schools, randomly.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.530
Maybe someone's birthday,
we'll go and donate some food.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:19.300
We'll do all that.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.340
Then from there, we grew on
to donating to a bigger--

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.760
in a more consistent way, on a
monthly way, and all of that.

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.740
And then while we were
taking our baby steps,

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:41.110
I started to notice that
Akshaya Patra was doing things

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.640
in a more systematic way.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.940
And what caught my
eye and attention

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:49.410
was that here was an
organization which

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.975
had a great set of people
who were managing it, leading

00:05:52.975 --> 00:05:59.680
it, and doing it in a very
structured way, because I know

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.010
the size of the problem.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:08.710
So when I saw that,
and I saw the numbers,

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.570
that caught my
attention, that one child

00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:20.050
can be fed for one full
year for $15, which

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:23.510
means that you have the power--

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.390
yeah, let's say,
I'm sure all of you

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:32.860
have this power to
adopt at least 200 kids,

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:37.300
which means $3,000 in a year.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.760
Adoption of 200 kids?

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:43.510
Is that the power that
all of us here have?

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.410
Fantastic.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:45.730
That's something.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:51.490
So when I saw that, that they
have kept all the costs so low.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.960
And there's one way of managing
costs in a very frugal way.

00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.370
But the other thing is
bringing in efficiencies.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:03.910
I think that's what
Akshaya Patra does.

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:07.040
So I started to understand
a little bit more.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:10.510
So about a couple of
years ago, this brand

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.540
that I endorse, they
did did a marketing tab

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.560
with Akshaya Patra
that's sugar free.

00:07:17.560 --> 00:07:21.520
And that's where I
met the CEO, Shridhar.

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:24.220
And he invited me
and says, you must

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.350
come to Bangor, which I did.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.010
But I was keeping the track--

00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:32.170
I knew what was happening.

00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:39.820
And last year, my wife's friend,
she is at the Houston chapter.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:43.420
She contacted her
and says, we would

00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:48.140
like to do some
fundraising using Sanjeev.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:49.840
So would it be OK?

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:52.490
So as soon as she spoke to
me, and both of us said,

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:56.960
no, no, this is something
that we have to do.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:05.620
And once we did that, and
that that's where we met--

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:08.200
[INAUDIBLE] I, we
talked about it.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:16.450
And here we are again
trying to do this,

00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:19.840
because what do we realize?

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:27.230
See, we do multiple businesses.

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:31.090
But if I were to
say numbers-wise,

00:08:31.090 --> 00:08:32.980
the contribution--

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.700
so and this is something which
I normally say in India--

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:44.560
that we in India have not
learned the art of giving well.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.580
We are not great givers.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:47.290
We're not.

00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.940
We have to learn
it from America.

00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:53.320
The Americans have learned the
art of giving very well, much

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.330
better than what we do.

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.880
But the dichotomy here was
that when I got the numbers,

00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:04.930
I realized in Akshaya
Patra's case, actually,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:09.070
the numbers of India
are much bigger.

00:09:09.070 --> 00:09:11.180
And US is very good.

00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:17.470
But I think the total
impact that this country

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:20.860
can have, or Akshaya Patra,
in terms of contribution

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:21.649
can be many fold.

00:09:21.649 --> 00:09:23.440
APRAJITA JAIN: I think
the credibility also

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.840
comes from the fact that
Akshaya Patra is also partly

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:26.620
government funded.

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:28.080
So there's a stamp
of credibility

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:29.830
that it's actually a
genuine organization.

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:31.357
And it's regarded
by our government

00:09:31.357 --> 00:09:33.190
as something worthy
enough to contribute to.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.846
So that adds to people
wanting to do that as well.

00:09:35.846 --> 00:09:37.720
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah,
I think the credibility

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.390
comes from the kind of people.

00:09:40.390 --> 00:09:42.370
I think the set of
people that are all

00:09:42.370 --> 00:09:45.000
involved with
Akshaya Patra, they

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:48.050
are highly credible people.

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.800
So I think it's
something where I

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:56.120
would say that Akshaya
Patra's credibility is higher.

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.620
So I think it's a win-win.

00:09:59.620 --> 00:10:02.550
It's a win-win where
the Midday Meal program,

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:06.930
where it was not
something that it--

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:10.330
even today, it happens
without Akshaya Patra

00:10:10.330 --> 00:10:12.340
in a few states, a few places.

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:14.740
Not everywhere, it's done
through Akshaya Patra.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.080
But wherever it is done
with Akshaya Patra,

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.120
it's done more effectively,
more efficiently.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:24.760
So I think it's
[INAUDIBLE],, if you ask me.

00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.700
APRAJITA JAIN: Mhm.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.380
So Akshaya Patra is lending
credibility to our government.

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.505
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Completely.

00:10:29.505 --> 00:10:32.142
And I can say that.

00:10:32.142 --> 00:10:33.600
I will not shy away
from saying it.

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:34.430
APRAJITA JAIN: No, absolutely.

00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.833
I agree.

00:10:34.833 --> 00:10:35.236
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:10:35.236 --> 00:10:36.111
APRAJITA JAIN: Right?

00:10:36.111 --> 00:10:38.020
And we do have a donation
booth set up there.

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:41.230
So if you can give up three
Starbucks coffees a year,

00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:42.265
you can sponsor a child.

00:10:42.265 --> 00:10:44.015
So think about that
as you leave the room.

00:10:44.015 --> 00:10:46.320
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Wow,
yeah, that's amazing.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:53.032
Yeah, at first, I said, no,
the math does not add up.

00:10:53.032 --> 00:10:53.740
How does it work?

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.720
APRAJITA JAIN: I was shocked
when I first learned about $15.

00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.406
I give out $15 for
parking or coffees

00:10:59.406 --> 00:11:00.530
and small things like this.

00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:02.460
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Exactly,
the kind of things

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.960
that-- and that can be
a life-changing moment

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:15.290
for someone, because what
I believe is that all of us

00:11:15.290 --> 00:11:17.960
want to do more than
what we are doing today.

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:20.030
And that's what I see.

00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:23.910
But we don't get
opportunities, or as I call,

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:28.020
excuses, which are around us.

00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:30.500
We don't get-- it's not--

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.160
I have seen.

00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.310
I have two daughters.

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.500
I know that.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.470
So we came here, and
she studies in UK.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:40.160
And I was talking to her.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.900
I said, oh, your
flight leaves early.

00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.170
You could have taken
an earlier bus.

00:11:44.170 --> 00:11:46.650
She's about two hours
away from London.

00:11:46.650 --> 00:11:50.130
And she said, yeah,
Dad, I could have,

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:52.490
but I was helping
someone, this old lady.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:11:54.710
And I don't want to rush her.

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:55.647
I want to do it.

00:11:55.647 --> 00:11:56.480
So I'll take my bus.

00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.390
It's OK.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.060
It's fine.

00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.600
She's 19 years old.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:04.520
And so I know that all of
us, we want to do our bit.

00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.695
But we don't get enough chances.

00:12:06.695 --> 00:12:09.320
APRAJITA JAIN: They always say,
it's in giving that we receive.

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.922
And I think that's a really good
edict for the more you give,

00:12:12.922 --> 00:12:15.130
the more you get for yourself,
not in monetary terms.

00:12:15.130 --> 00:12:16.588
But there is
something that changes

00:12:16.588 --> 00:12:18.020
inside you, which is amazing.

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:20.436
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Definitely,
it's more fulfilling-- always.

00:12:20.436 --> 00:12:22.960
And we talked
about it yesterday.

00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.690
And I said, the joy of
giving is much more than joy

00:12:26.690 --> 00:12:27.400
of receiving.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.800
That's what is there.

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:33.050
But I also said this.

00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:34.580
And I'm again going to say this.

00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.060
You can't take credit for this.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:38.750
There's a natural
human instinct, OK?

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.120
Like we have
instinct to survive,

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:46.220
the instinct to get joy by
receiving is natural to humans.

00:12:46.220 --> 00:12:46.830
OK?

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:49.050
So you don't take
credit for it, OK?

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.200
So that is.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:52.430
Only thing is that
if you don't get it.

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:58.310
If you don't get that natural
instinct of the joy of giving

00:12:58.310 --> 00:13:01.440
is much more than
joy of receiving.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.430
It's a human instinct.

00:13:03.430 --> 00:13:06.499
So if you don't have
it, think about it.

00:13:06.499 --> 00:13:08.040
APRAJITA JAIN: OK,
Then let's move on

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:11.610
to talking about the
outstanding career.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:13.179
I hate to generalize,
but normally,

00:13:13.179 --> 00:13:14.970
what happens in India
as you're growing up,

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:16.870
your parents give
you two choices.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:20.020
You can either become a
doctor or an engineer.

00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:22.132
And I'm neither of those two.

00:13:22.132 --> 00:13:25.370
But how did you break
loose of that mold?

00:13:25.370 --> 00:13:28.975
And how did you get inspired
and maybe even rebel

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:32.312
a little bit against that
culture and become who you are?

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:34.770
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So I didn't
give that chance to my parents.

00:13:34.770 --> 00:13:35.649
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:36.690
APRAJITA JAIN: Oh, great.

00:13:36.690 --> 00:13:37.650
[CHUCKLES]

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:42.030
SANJEEV KAPOOR: No, so
fortunately, my parents

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:47.240
always believed in us in terms
of whatever we wanted to do.

00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:49.870
We had that freedom.

00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:53.580
We were never under any kind
of pressure that, OK, well,

00:13:53.580 --> 00:13:54.240
do this.

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.390
This is what you have to do.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.190
And yeah, of
course, all parents,

00:13:59.190 --> 00:14:02.410
they want their kids to do well.

00:14:02.410 --> 00:14:07.300
And so naturally,
when I was studying--

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:13.070
so doctors or
engineer at that time.

00:14:13.070 --> 00:14:15.120
These were two things.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.740
So at that time, actually,
doctor was a little higher.

00:14:19.740 --> 00:14:21.163
Engineer was a bit lower.

00:14:21.163 --> 00:14:22.670
APRAJITA JAIN: [CHUCKLES]

00:14:22.670 --> 00:14:30.270
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So I still
remember, in ninth standard,

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:33.180
I said, OK, doctor it
is, because if you're

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:35.657
good in studies, that's
what you would be.

00:14:35.657 --> 00:14:37.490
APRAJITA JAIN: I can
reach that level, yeah.

00:14:37.490 --> 00:14:37.990
[CHUCKLES]

00:14:37.990 --> 00:14:41.831
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah,
it's not difficult.

00:14:41.831 --> 00:14:45.450
So there was an
assignment, and we

00:14:45.450 --> 00:14:50.460
were asked to draw electron
microscope in our biology

00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:52.860
class.

00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:57.040
And what I drew was the best
in the class, fantastic.

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.230
I was so proud of it.

00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:02.280
So I showed it to the teacher,
thinking that now this is where

00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:04.170
I'll get the appreciation.

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.830
And he did not even look at me.

00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:09.150
He looked at that.

00:15:09.150 --> 00:15:12.930
He had a red pen, and
he put "Label it."

00:15:12.930 --> 00:15:16.740
In my excitement, I
had not labeled it.

00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:17.610
This is this lens.

00:15:17.610 --> 00:15:18.151
This is this.

00:15:18.151 --> 00:15:19.740
I had not done that.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.450
I was so upset.

00:15:22.450 --> 00:15:23.550
I said--

00:15:23.550 --> 00:15:25.090
APRAJITA JAIN: That was the
end of your medical career?

00:15:25.090 --> 00:15:25.780
SANJEEV KAPOOR: --that
was the end of it.

00:15:25.780 --> 00:15:26.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.110
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
Otherwise, you would be

00:15:27.110 --> 00:15:28.430
interviewing Dr. Kapoor here.

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:29.749
APRAJITA JAIN: [LAUGHING] OK.

00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:30.540
SANJEEV KAPOOR: OK?

00:15:30.540 --> 00:15:31.510
Yeah, you'd definitely
be interviewing him.

00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:31.760
Yeah.

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:32.475
APRAJITA JAIN: I'm
so glad that was

00:15:32.475 --> 00:15:33.650
the end of your medical career.

00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:34.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:15:34.170 --> 00:15:36.940
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So that
was out of the way.

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:43.980
So now I had to make that
choice, oh, OK, so no biology,

00:15:43.980 --> 00:15:46.620
because I'm not going
to study biology.

00:15:46.620 --> 00:15:48.480
So what else?

00:15:48.480 --> 00:15:49.680
Engineering drawing.

00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.070
So I studied engineering
drawing instead.

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:54.390
And I did well.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:59.870
So engineering, OK.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:02.210
No, this is not
what I want to do.

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:03.020
Why?

00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:05.450
Because it's very predictable.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:08.300
It's predictable that
this is what you will do.

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:13.640
This is what-- so by that time,
I had grown enough to rebel,

00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:18.530
to say that I will do something
that no one in our family,

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.560
no one in our neighborhood,
none of my friends

00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.899
should have done that.

00:16:22.899 --> 00:16:23.940
APRAJITA JAIN: [CHUCKLES]

00:16:23.940 --> 00:16:27.140
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So I just--

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:29.780
in school class,
everyone, so there

00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.700
are people who are
typecast that, oh, you're

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.340
good in science, you'll do IT.

00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.760
So I was the IT type, OK?

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:40.570
So I said, oh, no IT.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:43.240
So I did not appear
for the entrance exam.

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.420
I said, no, I'm not
going to do this.

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.840
Not this, but I don't
know what to do.

00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:53.170
So did I know cooking?

00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:54.770
Did I know who a chef was?

00:16:54.770 --> 00:16:57.590
I had no clue, knew
nothing about it.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:17:05.180
It So I just started to
understand what I will do.

00:17:05.180 --> 00:17:08.171
Then I said, OK, let
me become an architect.

00:17:08.171 --> 00:17:08.962
APRAJITA JAIN: Wow.

00:17:08.962 --> 00:17:10.740
[CHUCKLES]

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:14.900
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So
I did some research.

00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:17.780
There's a institute in
Delhi, the School of Planning

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:19.400
and Architecture, SPA.

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:21.140
There's entrance.

00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:23.150
I went for that entrance.

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:26.119
And they used to take about
18, 20 students every year

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:27.002
all over India.

00:17:27.002 --> 00:17:28.210
I said, that's a good chance.

00:17:28.210 --> 00:17:30.320
OK.

00:17:30.320 --> 00:17:35.480
Now little did I know that
I would be waitlisted there.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:37.430
Oops.

00:17:37.430 --> 00:17:40.390
So there's only one
choice that I've made.

00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:42.700
So I wanted to do something
which is creative,

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:44.140
be an architect.

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:46.540
Only one place that
I applied, the School

00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:51.910
of Planning and Architecture,
oh-oh, bad calls.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:56.230
Now Sanjeev Kapoor, a very
good student, everything,

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:59.070
has engineering.

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:02.020
So Delhi used to have a
college which was not--

00:18:02.020 --> 00:18:03.980
till that year, there
was no entrance exam.

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:06.790
Delhi College of
Engineering, DC.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.410
So I could get on merit.

00:18:08.410 --> 00:18:11.987
I said, engineering
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:18:11.987 --> 00:18:13.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:13.150 --> 00:18:13.805
APRAJITA JAIN: A
missed opportunity.

00:18:13.805 --> 00:18:14.100
[CHUCKLES]

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:14.430
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Right?

00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:15.460
Why would I do it?

00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:18.420
So no engineering, no way.

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:23.990
But so I had nothing.

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:25.300
So there was--

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.040
I didn't even know.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.240
So it was a case of
being too smart, right?

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:34.840
So I was left with
nothing in my hand.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.821
A brilliant student,
somebody who

00:18:36.821 --> 00:18:38.070
would have gone into the area.

00:18:38.070 --> 00:18:47.120
And so all my friends
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:49.900
So didn't have anything.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:55.780
A friend of mine, he wanted
to do this hotel management.

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:58.160
Hotel management back then,
actually even now, also,

00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.400
I think, to some extent,
is meant for people

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.137
who are good for nothing.

00:19:02.137 --> 00:19:02.970
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:02.970 --> 00:19:04.150
APRAJITA JAIN: In our
family, we used to say,

00:19:04.150 --> 00:19:05.024
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH].

00:19:05.024 --> 00:19:05.585
[CHUCKLES]

00:19:05.585 --> 00:19:07.501
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] It's like

00:19:07.501 --> 00:19:10.490
somebody who could discover
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] right?

00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:16.120
So [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:21.630
I also went and,
naturally, they asked me.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:22.630
They looked at the math.

00:19:22.630 --> 00:19:25.310
Why are you wasting our time?

00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:26.370
You will not join here.

00:19:26.370 --> 00:19:28.240
I said, this is what
I have always wanted

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.030
to do, right from my childhood.

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:31.964
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:31.964 --> 00:19:34.130
APRAJITA JAIN: That's how
you convince people, yeah.

00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:35.600
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So
right from my childhood,

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.766
this is what I wanted to do.

00:19:36.766 --> 00:19:37.430
I had no clue.

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:39.980
I had no clue what it was.

00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:43.570
And so this friend
of mine, Jasbir,

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:45.940
he was very keen to get in.

00:19:45.940 --> 00:19:46.700
I got admission.

00:19:46.700 --> 00:19:47.825
He did not.

00:19:47.825 --> 00:19:48.867
Oh, he's doing very well.

00:19:48.867 --> 00:19:50.241
Don't feel bad
about the trouble.

00:19:50.241 --> 00:19:50.785
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:58.360
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So he, in some
sense, helped me with this.

00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:02.650
I took admission, and I
said, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:20:02.650 --> 00:20:04.830
That's what I wanted to do.

00:20:04.830 --> 00:20:05.500
Got into this.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.166
But even at that time,
there was nothing

00:20:07.166 --> 00:20:09.790
about being a chef or cooking.

00:20:09.790 --> 00:20:16.210
So after I got into the
Institute, again, I did well.

00:20:16.210 --> 00:20:20.410
And then again, I said,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] So nobody

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.450
wanted to be a chef.

00:20:22.450 --> 00:20:27.490
So hardly any-- so
people who could not get

00:20:27.490 --> 00:20:32.260
into the mainstream, they
were [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:34.030 --> 00:20:36.230
SANJEEV KAPOOR: I
began by choice.

00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:40.090
So I just did that.

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:47.030
And somewhere, I guess, since
I was probably rebelling,

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:48.490
'cause [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.940
That probably helped me.

00:20:51.940 --> 00:20:53.403
And--

00:20:53.403 --> 00:20:55.861
APRAJITA JAIN: And the rest is
history [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:20:55.861 --> 00:20:56.280
[CHUCKLES]

00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:57.488
SANJEEV KAPOOR: I don't know.

00:20:57.488 --> 00:20:58.757
[NON-ENGLISH  SPEECH]

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:00.370
APRAJITA JAIN: [LAUGHING]

00:21:00.370 --> 00:21:01.870
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:03.070 --> 00:21:05.770
My brother, one day, he called
me and he says, [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:07.690
So I used to go to
the hotel at 7 o'clock

00:21:07.690 --> 00:21:11.110
in the morning, come back at
2:00 in the night, no day off,

00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:15.980
nothing, working so much,
not getting anything,

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:17.480
and he was in charge
of the counter.

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:21.546
So [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:21.546 --> 00:21:22.920
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:26.240
SANJEEV KAPOOR: And I'm saying,
I said, I'm a science student.

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.430
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
which is a fact.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:29.330
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:30.970
But [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:35.920
I would've wasted five
years in that field

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:37.960
and not be happy with that.

00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:43.637
But yeah, I actually thought
about it one whole night.

00:21:43.637 --> 00:21:44.720
Maybe I've made a mistake.

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:45.520
What am I doing?

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.880
Why am I doing this?

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.519
But I think [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:21:51.519 --> 00:21:52.560
APRAJITA JAIN: [CHUCKLES]

00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:54.050
SANJEEV KAPOOR: I guess, yeah.

00:21:54.050 --> 00:21:54.530
APRAJITA JAIN: Great.

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:56.950
Well, thank you for sharing
your long and very successful

00:21:56.950 --> 00:21:57.360
journey.

00:21:57.360 --> 00:21:58.150
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Thank you.

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.235
APRAJITA JAIN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:22:00.235 --> 00:22:01.570
We were having coffee with Chef.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:03.430
And I asked him if all
questions are game.

00:22:03.430 --> 00:22:05.330
He said, yes, if I'm
also game for that.

00:22:05.330 --> 00:22:06.205
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:22:06.205 --> 00:22:08.350
APRAJITA JAIN: So my next
question is about a story

00:22:08.350 --> 00:22:10.050
that I had heard.

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:13.000
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH],,
your lovely wife.

00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:15.910
So there was some struggle
to convince her parents

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:18.310
to let her marry you
because you were a chef.

00:22:18.310 --> 00:22:20.290
And back then, as
you said, it was not

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:21.850
an engineer or a doctor.

00:22:21.850 --> 00:22:25.492
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:22:25.492 --> 00:22:26.820

00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:28.700

00:22:31.382 --> 00:22:32.840

00:22:35.604 --> 00:22:36.520
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Right?

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.260
This story, [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:39.899
APRAJITA JAIN: Oh, OK.

00:22:39.899 --> 00:22:40.690
SANJEEV KAPOOR: OK?

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.450
Her sister was a chef.

00:22:42.450 --> 00:22:43.330
APRAJITA JAIN: Oh.

00:22:43.330 --> 00:22:46.060
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So
there was no trouble.

00:22:46.060 --> 00:22:51.190
Her sister married
a Catholic guy.

00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:52.440
There was a struggle.

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.490
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.880
APRAJITA JAIN: OK.

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:56.330
So there was no struggle there.

00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:58.371
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So it's
no problem, [NON-ENGLISH]

00:22:58.412 --> 00:22:59.120
AUDIENCE: Google.

00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.160

00:23:06.015 --> 00:23:07.640
APRAJITA JAIN: We
always love feedback.

00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.640
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Correct.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.340
So no, so I didn't have to--

00:23:10.340 --> 00:23:11.620
I had no struggle, actually.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:13.030
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:15.700
because that's the back, no?

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:20.380
So why people often ask
this is because early

00:23:20.380 --> 00:23:22.280
on, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:23:27.080 --> 00:23:27.580
OK.

[LAUGHTER]

[COUGHS]

00:23:31.554 --> 00:23:33.220
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So
there was an ad where

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.190
they wanted her as well, OK?

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:41.980
Part of that script
was so she says that--

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:42.822
what was it?

00:23:42.822 --> 00:23:44.280
ALYONA KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:45.470
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Ah,

APRAJITA JAIN: [LAUGHING]

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.063
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So
actually, her dad--

00:23:48.063 --> 00:23:48.979
I knew it was her dad.

00:23:48.979 --> 00:23:49.492
[LAUGHTER]

00:23:49.492 --> 00:23:51.200
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So I
knew it was her dad.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.945
She said, Dad,
it's just a story.

00:23:52.945 --> 00:23:54.030
It's just an ad.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.000
It's not real.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.215
Ah, OK, OK.

00:23:56.215 --> 00:23:56.940
[LAUGHS]

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:57.720
APRAJITA JAIN: It
shows that ads work.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:59.664
It becomes reality
for some people.

00:23:59.664 --> 00:24:00.830
SANJEEV KAPOOR: That's true.

00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:01.580
That's true, yeah.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.746
APRAJITA JAIN: Great, great.

00:24:02.746 --> 00:24:04.610
Thank you for sharing
that, the real story.

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:05.484
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:24:05.484 --> 00:24:07.840
APRAJITA JAIN: In general,
there's this image about,

00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:10.900
as you said, that chefs didn't
used to be as highly regarded,

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:11.920
until you came around.

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:15.100
And people started, ha
ha, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.440
So how has that changed
over the years in India?

00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:18.970
And with the new
crop coming up, how

00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:21.580
do you feel people are being
encouraged to take that up

00:24:21.580 --> 00:24:22.777
as a serious career option?

00:24:22.777 --> 00:24:24.610
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Well,
fortunately, the times

00:24:24.610 --> 00:24:26.750
have changed.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:30.340
So when my first
job in a hotel, I

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:35.080
was actually asked by
the GM of the hotel,

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:39.490
I'd gone to meet a tour
leader of a group checking

00:24:39.490 --> 00:24:40.690
into our hotel.

00:24:40.690 --> 00:24:41.560
So I'd gone to meet.

00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.050
And our reception was
in the lobby area.

00:24:44.050 --> 00:24:46.690
So I had gone from
kitchen there.

00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:49.150
And the GM of the hotel
was standing there.

00:24:49.150 --> 00:24:51.360
And he actually said, yes, Chef?

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.440
I said, sir, I have come
to meet the tour leader

00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:57.110
to ask what they want to eat.

00:24:57.110 --> 00:24:59.370
No, but you can't
be in the lobby.

00:24:59.370 --> 00:25:02.300
So it's not second-hand
information.

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.080
It's first-hand.

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.770
But I was actually asked
by the GM of a hotel

00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:11.060
that chefs are not allowed to be
in the lobby of the hotel, OK?

00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:14.650
So that was sad.

00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:15.870
That was not something.

00:25:15.870 --> 00:25:17.180
But I rebelled.

00:25:17.180 --> 00:25:21.530
I said, OK, now whatever I
couldn't do, I would change.

00:25:21.530 --> 00:25:26.280
I've worked really
hard to do that.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:27.540
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:29.690

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:31.960
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.610
So I often say this
in India, especially,

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.717
that [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:25:37.717 --> 00:25:39.060
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:41.685
So people now don't
want to be a chef.

00:25:41.685 --> 00:25:44.550
They often say, sir, how
can we be a celebrity chef?

00:25:44.550 --> 00:25:45.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:45.050 --> 00:25:47.549
SANJEEV KAPOOR: I said, there's
nothing as a celebrity chef.

00:25:47.549 --> 00:25:49.970
It's the world that you would
do should be celebrated.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:25:53.990
Yeah, it's not-- you
cannot become, so--

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:55.550
but no, it's a change.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:26:00.600
I'm glad that
change has happened.

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:03.710
It's not happened in a
rush, I can tell you.

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:08.090
It's been a very long
time it has taken.

00:26:08.090 --> 00:26:13.410
And even now, it's
not that easy.

00:26:13.410 --> 00:26:15.230
I can tell you.

00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:23.637
So two weeks ago, so I
was awarded the Padma Shri

00:26:23.637 --> 00:26:24.720
by the president of India.

00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:32.990
And so I decided that I would
wear chef's uniform for that.

00:26:32.990 --> 00:26:36.620
But the invitation that was
there, it said, national dress.

00:26:39.690 --> 00:26:40.930
OK?

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:44.970
So now what do you do?

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:46.906
What do you wear?

00:26:46.906 --> 00:26:48.780
Because it's the
invitation, and that's what,

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:49.613
and it's a protocol.

00:26:49.613 --> 00:26:52.400
You have to follow that.

00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.450
So I asked them,
and they said, yeah,

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:59.350
if it says national dress,
then it's national dress.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:02.750
So I said, OK.

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.140
What happens when these
awards and all are

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:11.020
given to uniformed
services people that's

00:27:11.020 --> 00:27:13.660
in military and Army, Navy?

00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:18.010
No, no, no, they get
decorated on their uniform.

00:27:18.010 --> 00:27:22.150
So I said, OK, I'm going
to wear my chef's uniform,

00:27:22.150 --> 00:27:25.334
and [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:27:25.334 --> 00:27:27.250
APRAJITA JAIN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [CHUCKLES]

00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:30.880
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:34.877
So it takes time, but
yeah, I will get there.

00:27:34.877 --> 00:27:35.960
APRAJITA JAIN: Absolutely.

00:27:35.960 --> 00:27:36.835
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:27:36.835 --> 00:27:38.337
APRAJITA JAIN: And
from not knowing

00:27:38.337 --> 00:27:40.670
what to do in your career to
becoming Padma Shri Sanjeev

00:27:40.670 --> 00:27:41.390
Kapoor.

00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:43.220
So tell us a little
bit about what

00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:46.130
are the qualities in a chef that
you think are really important.

00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:49.030
I mean, it sounds like it's not
something that is born, right?

00:27:49.030 --> 00:27:50.280
You can develop that talent.

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.760
But is it the right ingredients?

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.300
Is it the right cookware?

00:27:54.300 --> 00:27:55.300
Is it the right mindset?

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:57.722
Like what, for you,
makes a perfect chef?

00:27:57.722 --> 00:28:00.180
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Somebody who's
involved with Akshaya Patra.

00:28:00.180 --> 00:28:01.650
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:04.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.160
SANJEEV KAPOOR: No, the reason
that I'm here is Akshaya Patra.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:10.885
Lots of people who
have come in now,

00:28:10.885 --> 00:28:13.850
we have to raise lots of
money for Akshaya Patra.

00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:15.410
And we talked about it.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:21.940
It only takes $15 per
year to feed one child.

00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:28.360
And the 1.6 million kids a
day, a staggering number.

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:31.280
And as Sandeep
yesterday mentioned,

00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:37.660
it's only we are feeding 1.5%
of the total need that is there

00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:38.590
in India.

00:28:38.590 --> 00:28:40.780
So imagine what they needed.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:44.300
So one needs a lot
of money to grow.

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.460
So please do your bit.

00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:48.310
OK.

00:28:48.310 --> 00:28:59.440
Coming back to your question,
I think, in any profession,

00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:00.850
the ingredients are same.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:05.170
It's not-- they don't
work any differently,

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:08.350
so whether it's knowledge,
whether it's hard work.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:11.380
But what I have realized,
the biggest thing is--

00:29:14.770 --> 00:29:17.380
which we normally don't
quantify, we don't say,

00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.250
we don't factor that in--

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:23.810
is the value system.

00:29:23.810 --> 00:29:29.710
All the things that we learned
from our parents, family,

00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.030
It's all the good things that--

00:29:32.030 --> 00:29:34.760
all the boring things.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:39.920
That's something which
you'd say, oh, what is this?

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:47.450
I think that is probably one
of the most important things

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:48.800
in any success.

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:49.600
APRAJITA JAIN:
Especially In cooking.

00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:51.016
I think it's a
generational thing.

00:29:51.016 --> 00:29:52.480
I learned cooking from my mom.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:54.320
But [INAUDIBLE],,
there's certain things.

00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.630
I stand right next to
her when she's cooking.

00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:58.040
I write down
everything she does.

00:29:58.040 --> 00:29:59.680
I follow her instructions.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.782
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:30:01.782 --> 00:30:03.740
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Well,
she's just a better cook.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:04.100
Face it.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:04.350
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:04.350 --> 00:30:06.310
APRAJITA JAIN: Yeah,
I'm completely on board.

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:07.780
Yes, she is.

00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:08.350
Yes, she is.

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:10.625
Her rasgullas always turn
out spongier than mine.

00:30:10.625 --> 00:30:11.750
There's something about it.

00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:13.280
But you're right,
there is something

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.684
that is not quantifiable that
just comes with, I guess,

00:30:16.684 --> 00:30:17.350
experience, or--

00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:19.460
SANJEEV KAPOOR: No
these are experience.

00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:22.947
And also, we talk
about energies, right?

00:30:22.947 --> 00:30:23.780
APRAJITA JAIN: Yeah.

00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:26.660
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So same
is the case in cooking.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.220
So you cook with
positive energy.

00:30:29.220 --> 00:30:33.830
It'll come out--
it's a known thing.

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:36.750
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] mothers.

00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:40.520
So she exactly knows
who she's cooking for.

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.780
You can never get that
in restaurant food.

00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:45.410
Never, you would get it.

00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:53.300
But on especially
younger people,

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:59.820
people who want to become
chefs, so there are two things.

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:04.130
One is the skills, because
it's a job of skill, right?

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:07.610
So they have to
perfect the skills.

00:31:07.610 --> 00:31:14.720
And that's around a
big layer of knowledge.

00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:18.560
So get great skills,
have great knowledge.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.140
And then wrap that around
with a great value system.

00:31:22.140 --> 00:31:24.590
So if you get these
three things right--

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.610
skill, knowledge,
and value system--

00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:28.125
you can be a great chef, easy.

00:31:28.125 --> 00:31:29.000
APRAJITA JAIN: Great.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:30.050
Thank you.

00:31:30.050 --> 00:31:32.150
So you have done so many
things in your career,

00:31:32.150 --> 00:31:33.900
in addition to just
being an amazing chef.

00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:35.691
And I had to make a
list and write it down,

00:31:35.691 --> 00:31:37.490
because I would forget
all of those things.

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.580
Some of them are you
own over 75 restaurants,

00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:42.980
starting with The Yellow
Chilli, I believe.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.130
You have your own
cookbook series.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.630
You own a ready-to-cook
meal line.

00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:49.760
You have your own
food TV network.

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:53.030
You have hosted many TV shows.

00:31:53.030 --> 00:31:56.110
You are a brand ambassador for
kitchen brands and for Ariel,

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:57.620
as I learned.

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:01.790
You introduced a culinary art
course at Symbiosis in Pune.

00:32:01.790 --> 00:32:04.340
You have cooked for the
Indian prime minister.

00:32:04.340 --> 00:32:06.320
You have designed
an airline menu.

00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.810
And you have been approached
by the Indian railways

00:32:08.810 --> 00:32:11.180
to design their menu as well.

00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.957
How can you wear all
these hats and still

00:32:12.957 --> 00:32:14.040
do justice to all of them?

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.870
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Hold on,
I don't get paid so much.

00:32:16.870 --> 00:32:17.370
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:18.870
SANJEEV KAPOOR: I'm
still highly underpaid.

00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:20.000
APRAJITA JAIN: You should call
your accountant at present

00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:20.470
and ask what's going on.

00:32:20.470 --> 00:32:21.678
SANJEEV KAPOOR: What is this?

00:32:21.678 --> 00:32:23.000
What's going on?

00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:24.972
I feel highly underpaid now.

00:32:24.972 --> 00:32:26.328
[LAUGHTER]

00:32:26.328 --> 00:32:27.232
APRAJITA JAIN: And this
is just some of them.

00:32:27.232 --> 00:32:29.565
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah, and I
was working on weekend also.

00:32:29.565 --> 00:32:30.870
What is this?

00:32:30.870 --> 00:32:31.370
Not fair.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:32.060
[CHUCKLES]

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.518
APRAJITA JAIN: So
how do you do all

00:32:33.518 --> 00:32:36.812
of that and doing justice to
all of them at the same time?

00:32:36.812 --> 00:32:38.020
SANJEEV KAPOOR: I don't know.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:39.880
I don't think
about these things.

00:32:39.880 --> 00:32:40.930
I just do it.

00:32:40.930 --> 00:32:43.630
I don't
over-intellectualize things.

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:47.140
I think I just take
one day at a time.

00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:53.860
And I say that this is the
most important thing now.

00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:55.660
APRAJITA JAIN: Mhm,
be in the moment.

00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:56.535
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:32:56.535 --> 00:33:00.160
So that's how I deal with it.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:06.670
And you can only do it if you
have a great team with you,

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:13.120
starting with my wife, to all
our activities and everything

00:33:13.120 --> 00:33:15.810
that we do.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:18.160
So you mentioned
about Indian railways.

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.510
There's a big meeting in
Delhi with the team of Railway

00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:24.220
Ministry and everyone.

00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:28.906
So one of our chefs has
traveled from Mumbai.

00:33:28.906 --> 00:33:32.759
Actually, I had suggested that,
because we have chefs in Delhi,

00:33:32.759 --> 00:33:33.550
somebody come down.

00:33:33.550 --> 00:33:36.189
No, no, we want to
send someone senior.

00:33:36.189 --> 00:33:36.980
We want to do that.

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:39.030
I said, OK, fine,
whatever you want to do.

00:33:39.030 --> 00:33:41.187
So we have a good--

00:33:41.187 --> 00:33:43.270
APRAJITA JAIN: So you have
a good network of chefs

00:33:43.270 --> 00:33:44.510
that can also pitch in--

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:46.210
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
At our company, we

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:54.310
are fortunate to have good
people, talented, good value

00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.810
system.

00:33:54.810 --> 00:33:58.130
That's very, very
important to us.

00:33:58.130 --> 00:34:03.140
So yeah, I think because
of that, it just happens.

00:34:03.140 --> 00:34:06.640
APRAJITA JAIN: So I believe your
mainstream celebrity journey

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:07.926
started at "Khana Khazana."

00:34:07.926 --> 00:34:09.884
Many of us know you
because of "Khana Khazana."

00:34:09.884 --> 00:34:12.429
We have watched
many, many episodes.

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:14.510
You became a household
name through that.

00:34:14.510 --> 00:34:17.070
We have seen what happens on TV.

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:19.675
But tell us a fun,
behind-the-scenes story.

00:34:19.675 --> 00:34:28.276
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:34:28.276 --> 00:34:29.330
So tell us a fun story.

SANJEEV KAPOOR:

00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:42.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:46.790
SANJEEV KAPOOR: No, OK,
no always, it can happen.

00:34:46.790 --> 00:34:50.580
It's not something which is--

00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:54.760
but OK, on TV, now
this is unreal.

00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.050
I can't take credit for it.

00:34:58.050 --> 00:35:00.610
I've never cooked a dish twice.

00:35:00.610 --> 00:35:01.690
APRAJITA JAIN: Wow.

00:35:01.690 --> 00:35:02.606
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Never.

00:35:02.606 --> 00:35:04.900
APRAJITA JAIN: Of all these
shows, it never happened?

00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.524
SANJEEV KAPOOR: No,
because the reason,

00:35:06.524 --> 00:35:11.440
I'll tell you, because
when we cook on TV,

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.810
I do very simple dishes.

00:35:13.810 --> 00:35:16.850
I don't do something
which is complicated.

00:35:16.850 --> 00:35:21.760
So because it's very simple,
and I normally don't even plan.

00:35:21.760 --> 00:35:26.020
I just do whatever
comes to my mind.

00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:30.910
We have lots of ingredients
that are there, and I just cook.

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:35.570
And the results are predictable.

00:35:35.570 --> 00:35:38.230
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:35:38.230 --> 00:35:40.030
It's not something
you can cook in here.

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:44.500
It's not-- and over the years,
when you start to become

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:50.347
popular, other
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:35:50.347 --> 00:35:52.682
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:53.544 --> 00:35:54.460
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Right?

00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:55.774
So people are fine.

00:35:55.774 --> 00:35:57.565
APRAJITA JAIN: I'll
tell you a funny story.

00:35:57.565 --> 00:35:57.830
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:00.600
APRAJITA JAIN: So I went to
Germany a few months ago.

00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:02.290
And my dad makes
excellent malpuas.

00:36:02.290 --> 00:36:04.350
So my sister wanted
to eat malpuas.

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:07.930
So instead of using heavy
whipped cream in the malpuas,

00:36:07.930 --> 00:36:10.950
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]
sour cream [NON-ENGLISH]..

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:12.900
And we didn't know,
and he didn't tell us

00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:14.770
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:18.220
And when we ate them, they
were the most fabulous malpuas

00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:19.070
I've had in my life.

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:19.765
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Magic.

00:36:19.765 --> 00:36:21.681
APRAJITA JAIN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [CHUCKLES]

00:36:21.681 --> 00:36:23.260
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:36:23.260 --> 00:36:24.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:24.970 --> 00:36:28.930
SANJEEV KAPOOR: No, but so
there was this show I was doing.

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:31.420
It was a live cooking show.

00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:34.000
It was being done--

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.640
there was a new product launch.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.820
So there's a company
that was launching

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:43.180
cookware made with glass.

00:36:43.180 --> 00:36:47.460
And in Mumbai,
there's a new mall.

00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:55.540
Mumbai's first big mall
that opened was Crossroads.

00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:02.270
And so in their atrium, 500,
600 people, there's a stage.

00:37:02.270 --> 00:37:04.990
And normally, whenever
I do any live sessions,

00:37:04.990 --> 00:37:06.520
I say, OK, you can
ask me anything.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.110
Just raise your hand, and I'll
answer anything that you want.

00:37:09.110 --> 00:37:10.970
And I'll do that.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:13.960
And as soon as we started,
so there's a first dish

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:15.640
that I was going to cook.

00:37:15.640 --> 00:37:19.180
So I talked about
those pots made

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:21.510
with glass, shiny, very nice.

00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:24.640
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:29.710
And somebody raised their hand,
and they asked a question.

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:31.270
I got busy with that.

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:33.910
And it's OK, come
back to my cooking.

00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:35.610
And I was doing a soup.

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:38.870
And I poured the stock in that.

00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:43.710
As soon as I did that,
it shattered big time.

00:37:43.710 --> 00:37:47.360
Now here, there's a
new product launch.

00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:48.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:48.380 --> 00:37:50.631
SANJEEV KAPOOR: That
company is doing that.

00:37:50.631 --> 00:37:51.672
APRAJITA JAIN: It's live.

00:37:51.672 --> 00:37:52.654
[CHUCKLES]

00:37:53.636 --> 00:37:58.220
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah, and
there are 500-plus people.

00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.500
It happens live.

00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.530
But nothing happened.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:08.995
I said, you know what,
great pans, fantastic.

00:38:08.995 --> 00:38:11.360
But everything,
you need to care.

00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.870
One, you cannot drop it.

00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:14.330
It will break.

00:38:14.330 --> 00:38:17.390
Second, when you are
cooking like this,

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:22.310
don't start answering
questions, no matter what.

00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:23.420
OK?

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:25.520
Fortunately, at home,
you don't do that, right?

00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:26.660
APRAJITA JAIN: So you
had the presence of mind

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.910
to mitigate that
situation and get over it.

00:38:28.910 --> 00:38:29.570
Great.

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:30.750
[CHUCKLES]

00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:34.340
So there's a saying,
"You are what you eat."

00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.530
And for us Indians,
it's very hard

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:38.360
to follow certain
dietary precautions.

00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.120
Our food is so tasty.

00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:41.540
It's hard.

00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:43.460
There's all sorts
of fried foods,

00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:46.550
sweets, lots of carbohydrates.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:49.120
How do you think
about food and health,

00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.870
and especially
now, as people are

00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:54.410
becoming more aware of South
Asian diets and restrictions.

00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:56.684
How do you adapt
your recipes to that?

00:38:56.684 --> 00:38:58.100
SANJEEV KAPOOR: I
think it's easy.

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:08.450
It's nothing to do with which
region, geography, well,

00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:09.500
all that.

00:39:09.500 --> 00:39:12.920
In all parts of the world, there
are certain healthy things.

00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:17.090
There are certain not
so healthy things.

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:19.010
There are some people
who are healthier.

00:39:19.010 --> 00:39:21.876
There are some people
who are not as healthy,

00:39:21.876 --> 00:39:23.250
some people who
love to exercise,

00:39:23.250 --> 00:39:24.590
some people who don't.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:27.651
They exist everywhere.

00:39:27.651 --> 00:39:30.650
Indians are smart.

00:39:30.650 --> 00:39:33.170
They're intelligent.

00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:39.200
So the things that they cannot
do, they blame someone else.

00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:41.107
In this case, they blame food.

00:39:41.107 --> 00:39:42.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:42.850 --> 00:39:46.800
SANJEEV KAPOOR:

00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:03.440
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:08.120
SANJEEV KAPOOR: But
it's not difficult.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:10.295
Indian food, the
way we eat at home

00:40:10.295 --> 00:40:15.870
is one of the healthiest
meals that you can have.

00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:17.510
It's very balanced.

00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:21.320
It is balanced for
that geography.

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.220
Right?

00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:23.975
So [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:30.070 --> 00:40:31.100
Right?

00:40:31.100 --> 00:40:32.460
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:41.297 --> 00:40:42.130
APRAJITA JAIN: Yeah.

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:43.046
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Right?

00:40:43.046 --> 00:40:45.350
So use your intelligence to see.

00:40:45.350 --> 00:40:46.820
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:47.650 --> 00:40:49.561
APRAJITA JAIN: Yeah,
yeah, absolutely.

00:40:49.561 --> 00:40:50.060
[LAUGHS]

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:50.976
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Right?

00:40:50.976 --> 00:40:53.737
If you cannot, then
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:40:53.737 --> 00:40:54.402
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:54.402 --> 00:40:56.360
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] There's no

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.430
one else that you can blame.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:03.370
So it is not difficult.
All of us know.

00:41:03.370 --> 00:41:06.280
All of us know what is
healthy, what is not.

00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.090
We know it.

00:41:07.090 --> 00:41:08.840
It's just that it's a
choice that we make.

00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.506
APRAJITA JAIN: It's putting your
mind to it at the current time.

00:41:11.506 --> 00:41:13.540
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah,
it's not complex.

00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:14.630
It is not.

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:15.900
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:19.220 --> 00:41:21.760
And the good thing is our
body gives us signals.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.540
APRAJITA JAIN: Yeah.

00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.390
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Problem
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:29.013 --> 00:41:30.280
Right?

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:35.190
Over the years,
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:35.190 --> 00:41:35.830
Right?

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:38.040
It takes some time.

00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:41.100
It takes 1, 2, 3 years.

00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:45.510
And you feel
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] but not

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:46.020
much.

00:41:46.020 --> 00:41:47.660
I'll be able to
lose this, right?

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:48.780
APRAJITA JAIN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [CHUCKLES]

00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:50.655
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] And then

00:41:50.655 --> 00:41:55.380
one day you decide, and oh,
my god, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:56.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:41:56.730 --> 00:42:00.330
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Now that
is the day that you decide.

00:42:00.330 --> 00:42:04.600
And that's the day that you
want now instant results.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:07.660
That's the day you
want drastic results.

00:42:07.660 --> 00:42:14.470
So if you want that, then put
in that drastic effort also.

00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:17.140
If you do that, can
you get that result?

00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.609
Of course, you can.

00:42:18.609 --> 00:42:19.400
Of course, you can.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.945
APRAJITA JAIN: We have you.

00:42:20.945 --> 00:42:22.820
You have gone through
a major transformation.

00:42:22.820 --> 00:42:23.640
We have seen you on the shows.

00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:24.456
I mean--

00:42:24.456 --> 00:42:25.272
SANJEEV KAPOOR: No.

00:42:25.272 --> 00:42:26.346
OK, let me tell you.

[LAUGHTER]

00:42:33.130 --> 00:42:40.110
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So from
when I started till when

00:42:40.110 --> 00:42:44.000
I started in hotels and
now, from that weight,

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.297
I am 14 kilos more.

00:42:48.297 --> 00:42:49.130
APRAJITA JAIN: What?

00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:51.490
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yes.

00:42:51.490 --> 00:42:51.990
Yes.

00:42:55.014 --> 00:42:56.680
ALYONA KAPOOR: When
you started working.

00:42:56.680 --> 00:42:57.990
SANJEEV KAPOOR: When
I started working.

00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:59.580
Of course, when I
started working.

00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:03.750
When you started seeing TV,
one thing that you have not

00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:04.760
realized--

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:07.050
so you're meeting me for
the first time, right?

00:43:09.620 --> 00:43:15.330
I started TV,
almost 25 years old?

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:16.950
Something like that.

00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:20.340
So but do you
remember 25 years ago?

00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.842
Because do you
remember 25 years ago?

00:43:22.842 --> 00:43:24.093
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I remember.

00:43:26.895 --> 00:43:28.020
SANJEEV KAPOOR: They go up.

00:43:28.020 --> 00:43:29.326
TV, they had to stop--

00:43:29.326 --> 00:43:30.182
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:30.182 --> 00:43:31.431
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:31.431 --> 00:43:33.780
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:35.960
So you have watched--
no, but not me.

00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:37.120
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:37.900
AUDIENCE: Ah.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.850
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.100
AUDIENCE: [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.980
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:45.321
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:45.321 --> 00:43:46.820
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:47.695
APRAJITA JAIN: I see.

00:43:47.695 --> 00:43:48.612
AUDIENCE: Good answer.

00:43:48.612 --> 00:43:49.944
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Not good answer.

00:43:49.944 --> 00:43:50.740
It's right answer.

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:51.240
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.042
APRAJITA JAIN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:43:53.042 --> 00:43:55.375
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Ah, they all
wanted to go with the other

00:43:55.375 --> 00:43:55.770
now.

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:56.811
APRAJITA JAIN: [LAUGHING]

00:43:56.811 --> 00:44:02.900
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So actually,
if you notice the earlier TVs,

00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.560
they were not like this.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:06.090
It was 4 by 3.

00:44:06.090 --> 00:44:08.040
Now it's 16 by 9.

00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.940
So what it does, it stretches.

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:12.940
No kidding.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.430
I'm telling you so you see that.

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:25.600
So it feels-- but yeah, do I
put on weight and lose weight?

00:44:25.600 --> 00:44:28.510
So as compared to last
two months, three months,

00:44:28.510 --> 00:44:29.691
I've put on five kilos.

00:44:29.691 --> 00:44:30.274
AUDIENCE: Wow.

00:44:32.757 --> 00:44:33.590
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yes.

00:44:33.590 --> 00:44:35.570
APRAJITA JAIN: OK,
so it all comes back

00:44:35.570 --> 00:44:37.730
to being knowing
what you're eating

00:44:37.730 --> 00:44:40.120
and adjusting based
on that, yeah.

00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.540
OK, thank you.

00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:45.410
So you could be the best chef on
the earth, and you likely are.

00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:48.050
But [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.300
You want to eat it
made by somebody else.

00:44:50.300 --> 00:44:52.345
In my case, it's my
mom's palak paneer.

00:44:52.345 --> 00:44:54.114
In your case, there
must be some dish.

00:44:54.114 --> 00:44:55.280
And you can make everything.

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.770
But still, there must be some
dish that somebody else cooks

00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:59.226
for you, and you love that.

00:44:59.226 --> 00:45:00.350
Maybe it's the [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:00.350 --> 00:45:01.506
What is that one dish?

00:45:01.506 --> 00:45:03.380
SANJEEV KAPOOR: The
curry that you mentioned.

00:45:03.380 --> 00:45:05.530
APRAJITA JAIN: Oh, you're most
welcome to come home tonight.

00:45:05.530 --> 00:45:06.030
[CHUCKLES]

00:45:06.030 --> 00:45:08.290
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So she invited
me [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:45:08.290 --> 00:45:09.810
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:10.161 --> 00:45:11.660
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:14.390
What would be given
to eat, right?

00:45:14.390 --> 00:45:17.150
So I lose out on so
many good invitations.

00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:18.179
So as soon as she said--

00:45:18.179 --> 00:45:18.970
APRAJITA JAIN: Yes.

00:45:18.970 --> 00:45:21.840
SANJEEV KAPOOR: I
said, yeah, please.

00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:23.730
No, so I eat everything.

00:45:23.730 --> 00:45:25.900
There's nothing
that I don't eat.

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:31.430
I like to eat.

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:35.600
And I eat everything,
all kinds of cuisines,

00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:40.130
all foods, all tastes,
katami, tati, kanam, keen.

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:42.790
No matter what,
I eat everything.

00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:47.790
So but yeah, naturally,
food that you like,

00:45:47.790 --> 00:45:49.830
it's actually more the memories.

00:45:49.830 --> 00:45:51.020
It's more nostalgia.

00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:52.700
It's more than the taste.

00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:57.012
It's that [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:45:57.012 --> 00:45:58.470
APRAJITA JAIN:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:45:58.970 --> 00:46:00.970
SANJEEV KAPOOR: The memories--

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:04.400
and normally, it's
with the family.

00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:10.940
So it could be, again,
kadhi chawal made by my mom.

00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:13.310
Masala dosa, she
makes very good.

00:46:13.310 --> 00:46:16.920
And that's what she made
for our entire family

00:46:16.920 --> 00:46:20.679
when our family met
and went to her house.

00:46:20.679 --> 00:46:21.470
APRAJITA JAIN: Wow.

00:46:21.470 --> 00:46:24.750
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah, so
even now, I can eat that.

00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:25.690
APRAJITA JAIN: Nice.

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:27.930
Hence, your love for dosas that
you were just telling about.

00:46:27.930 --> 00:46:29.263
SANJEEV KAPOOR: That is correct.

00:46:29.263 --> 00:46:30.144
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:30.144 --> 00:46:31.560
APRAJITA JAIN: All
right then, you

00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.140
mentioned you have
two daughters.

00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:34.500
And one is in the UK.

00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:36.200
Is the other one
studying as well?

00:46:36.200 --> 00:46:40.940
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah, she just
finished her law from Pune.

00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:41.460
Yeah.

00:46:41.460 --> 00:46:45.360
APRAJITA JAIN: Any culinary
skills being passed on to--

00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:47.530
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Both
of them are very smart.

00:46:47.530 --> 00:46:50.150
So I said, [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:53.390
Dad, don't worry.

00:46:53.390 --> 00:46:56.926
We'll manage your businesses,
and we'll hire chefs.

00:46:56.926 --> 00:46:58.740
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:58.740 --> 00:46:59.610
So--

00:46:59.610 --> 00:46:59.950
APRAJITA JAIN: Great.

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:01.810
So they are going to help
you in some way or the other.

00:47:01.810 --> 00:47:01.990
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yes.

00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.800
APRAJITA JAIN: That's good.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.480
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Oh,
even now, they do.

00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.710
APRAJITA JAIN: Fantastic.

00:47:05.710 --> 00:47:09.150
With that, my last and very
important question for you,

00:47:09.150 --> 00:47:12.060
so at Google, we always
say, "In God we trust.

00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:13.860
Everybody else, bring data."

00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:16.980
So I brought some
data points for you.

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:21.330
In the Bay Area, there are
over 300,000 Indian Americans.

00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:24.210
That's more than 7 and
1/2% of Indian Americans

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:26.190
in the entire United States.

00:47:26.190 --> 00:47:28.530
So when are you planning to
open your first restaurant

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:29.430
in the Bay area?

00:47:29.430 --> 00:47:30.519
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:30.519 --> 00:47:31.310
SANJEEV KAPOOR: OK.

00:47:31.310 --> 00:47:33.178
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:35.980 --> 00:47:36.923
Let's see.

00:47:36.923 --> 00:47:37.634
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:37.634 --> 00:47:40.050
SANJEEV KAPOOR: No, actually,
somebody asked me yesterday,

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:44.420
oh, so you're opening somewhere
in Santa Clara, right?

00:47:44.420 --> 00:47:46.070
I had no clue.

00:47:46.070 --> 00:47:50.430
But no, we are opening
one in LA soon.

00:47:50.430 --> 00:47:55.000
And so that will be our
first Yellow Chilli.

00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.710
So we have multiple brands.

00:47:56.710 --> 00:47:59.934
Yellow Chilli is our--

00:47:59.934 --> 00:48:02.350
my team does not like it, but
I say it all the time-- it's

00:48:02.350 --> 00:48:03.660
our cheap and cheerful brand.

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:04.630
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:04.630 --> 00:48:08.456
SANJEEV KAPOOR:
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:48:08.456 --> 00:48:10.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:14.820
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So we
are starting with that.

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:18.600
And our most premium is
Signature by Sanjeev Kapoor.

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:22.580
And that, we are actually
planning one in Houston.

00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:27.240
So we were in a gala that
we did last time in Houston.

00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.900
So there's somebody who's
been in touch with us.

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:34.080
And they came to do a
Signature in Houston.

00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:39.595
So in this part also, I'm sure--

00:48:39.595 --> 00:48:41.720
APRAJITA JAIN: I mean,
there's a audience for both,

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:44.142
for the [INAUDIBLE]
and the high-end ones.

00:48:44.142 --> 00:48:46.350
So whatever you decide to
do will be successful here.

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:47.180
SANJEEV KAPOOR: No matter,
I'll give you [INAUDIBLE]..

00:48:47.180 --> 00:48:48.429
That's something I don't like.

00:48:48.429 --> 00:48:49.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:53.160
SANJEEV KAPOOR: No,
let me be very honest.

00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:57.630
Many of my friends, they
would always say that, yeah,

00:48:57.630 --> 00:48:58.830
America [NON-ENGLISH].

00:48:58.830 --> 00:49:00.530
Why are you not doing it?

00:49:00.530 --> 00:49:02.600
[NON-ENGLISH].

00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:07.440
So no, we do it in
a systematic way.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.890
So our growth
strategy has been more

00:49:10.890 --> 00:49:12.840
in India and the Middle East.

00:49:12.840 --> 00:49:17.100
And now, in the Middle
East, we have restaurants

00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:17.880
all over India.

00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.530
We have everywhere.

00:49:20.530 --> 00:49:25.650
So last part, Saudi Arabia was
left, so we've just signed.

00:49:25.650 --> 00:49:27.527
And we are opening
there very soon.

00:49:27.527 --> 00:49:29.610
So we'll be doing almost
30-odd restaurants there.

00:49:29.610 --> 00:49:30.568
APRAJITA JAIN: Oh, wow.

00:49:30.568 --> 00:49:33.870
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So next up, we
are looking at North America.

00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:36.070
So North America
is before Europe.

00:49:36.070 --> 00:49:38.590
So we are not looking at UK
and Europe at the moment.

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:42.490
So we opened two in Toronto.

00:49:42.490 --> 00:49:44.520
We have already opened.

00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:48.641
And so LA is next.

00:49:48.641 --> 00:49:50.890
APRAJITA JAIN: So we'll be
expecting you in California

00:49:50.890 --> 00:49:52.470
a lot more then, hopefully.

00:49:52.470 --> 00:49:55.140
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Oh, no,
that is no guarantee.

00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:57.900
So there are restaurants of
mine which I've never been to.

00:49:57.900 --> 00:49:59.275
APRAJITA JAIN: Oh, wow.

00:49:59.275 --> 00:50:00.150
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Yeah.

00:50:00.150 --> 00:50:02.580
Oh, for that matter,
owners of Google

00:50:02.580 --> 00:50:04.181
have not been to my house.

00:50:04.181 --> 00:50:05.564
[LAUGHTER]

00:50:05.564 --> 00:50:06.494
APRAJITA JAIN: Yeah.

00:50:06.494 --> 00:50:07.410
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Right?

00:50:07.410 --> 00:50:08.410
APRAJITA JAIN: We can
send them, if you'd like.

00:50:08.410 --> 00:50:08.963
[CHUCKLES]

00:50:08.963 --> 00:50:09.921
SANJEEV KAPOOR: Lovely.

00:50:09.921 --> 00:50:10.803
APRAJITA JAIN: OK.

00:50:10.803 --> 00:50:12.126
SANJEEV KAPOOR: [LAUGHS]

00:50:12.126 --> 00:50:12.570
APRAJITA JAIN: Awesome.

00:50:12.570 --> 00:50:14.340
So one question that
just came to my mind

00:50:14.340 --> 00:50:15.756
is you have all
these restaurants.

00:50:15.756 --> 00:50:18.300
And one thing I've
always been curious about

00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:20.130
is, what happens at
the end of the day

00:50:20.130 --> 00:50:22.170
when ingredients and
even cooked food is left?

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:24.212
Do you have a
system in place to--

00:50:24.212 --> 00:50:25.920
in the spirit of
Akshaya Patra and making

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.650
sure food doesn't go to waste,
what happens to that food?

00:50:28.650 --> 00:50:30.191
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So
this is a question

00:50:30.191 --> 00:50:31.380
that I'm asked all the time.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:36.840
So sensible, responsible
restaurants treat food the way

00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:40.110
we treat at our homes.

00:50:40.110 --> 00:50:46.240
So no hotel restaurant
wastes food.

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:51.400
It's not-- it's like if you have
here also, you would not waste.

00:50:51.400 --> 00:50:55.280
So there are cold
rooms, refrigerators.

00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.720
So whatever is used is used.

00:50:57.720 --> 00:51:03.720
Whatever is left is
put to use later.

00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:06.770
it's not wasted.

00:51:06.770 --> 00:51:09.690
It's again, the way you
would treat it at home.

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:14.800
If there's something
which is beyond its usage,

00:51:14.800 --> 00:51:17.469
utility, whatever the
time or whatever, yeah.

00:51:17.469 --> 00:51:19.510
APRAJITA JAIN: Sell-by
date or expiry date, yeah.

00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:21.176
SANJEEV KAPOOR: So
you would not use it.

00:51:21.176 --> 00:51:23.270
So that's how we treat it.

00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:25.810
We do not waste it.

00:51:25.810 --> 00:51:27.130
APRAJITA JAIN: Fantastic.

00:51:27.130 --> 00:51:29.380
With that, let's give a
huge round of applause

00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:33.192

hardworking team from Akshaya

00:51:33.192 --> 00:51:36.430
Patra, his wife, [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:39.020
Food means a lot of things
to different people.

00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.480
It can change people's lives.

00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:42.760
And we are, in this
room, privileged enough

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:44.270
