[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:15.810
One of the most interesting
phenomenons of human beings

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.470
is our creativity, right?

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.470
I mean our ability to transform
the world, our ability

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.930
to imagine new
possibilities, our ability

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.080
to probe the perimeters
of possibility,

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:29.770
remix the present to see
into the adjacent possible,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.075
which Steven Johnson refers to
as a shadow future that hovers

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:34.450
over the present
state of things,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.990
a map of all the ways in
which the present can reinvent

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:37.490
itself.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.900
Creativity is just connecting
things, as Steve Jobs says.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.350
And people who go into this
creative zone, virtuosos

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.150
of the imagination, those
ecstatic technicians

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.055
of the sacred spaces
of human virtuosity,

00:00:51.055 --> 00:00:53.680
athletes when they get into the
zone, scientists when they have

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.550
their eureka moments, musicians,
artists, when they enter

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.950
these flow states, jazz
musicians when they're

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.290
improving, Charlie Mingus as he
rhapsodizes through a tumbling

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.600
thicket of ideas with such
a sharp and vital alacrity

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.710
that it can take
the breath away.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.790
These flow states
are finally starting

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.840
to be understood,
thanks to neuroscience.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.360
The part of the brain
responsible for self-editing

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.760
literally goes dim.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.330
So there is this thing, a kind
of scrambling of the self.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.010
There is a scrambling
of the super ego that's

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.820
trying to correct
everything you do

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.960
and sensor and filter
what is otherwise

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.499
collective subconscious--
active imagination, so to speak.

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:29.665
And I think that these
artists, these athletes, when

00:01:29.665 --> 00:01:32.890
they go into the flow
state, I'm sure that they've

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.930
had their 10,000 hours
of practice in whatever

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.189
their skill is, but then
they go into that flow state.

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.730
Perfection is not
just about control.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:40.130
It's also about letting go.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.780
They shut down their
lateral prefrontal cortex

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.050
and they enter the realm
of the numinous, the realm

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.610
of the imaginal, the realm
where the dream becomes real.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.930
That space, that
head space of flow

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.790
is the place where
dreams are born.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:11.610
