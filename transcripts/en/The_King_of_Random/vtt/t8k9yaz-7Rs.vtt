00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.170
Hey guys welcome back I'm Nate. Thank you for joining me today on the king of random here in the studio

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.649
We love a good science experiment. I've learned about a good one recently that I want to try out

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:08.760
It's very simple

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:09.420
But should be fun some of you may be familiar with a movie called October sky about a boy named Homer Hickam who loves building

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.060
Rockets the movie is based off of a book called rocket boys and it explains that one of the fuels that Homer tested out was

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.830
A mixture of zinc powder and sulfur the mixture of zinc powder and sulfur is supposed to burn very quickly and with a very bright

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.549
Flash, so we're going to try and replicate that today in the studio using materials

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.209
We can easily get our hands on a cheap and easy source of zinc is pennies

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.240
Pennies look like they're made of copper, but since 1982 that's just been a thin coating on the outside. They're actually made

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.040
97.5%

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.560
Out of zinc obviously for a mixture with only two ingredients there's not a lot of supplies you need.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.910
First is some sulfur powder. This is a dusting sulfur

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.840
Which is used as a fungicide and insecticide

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.949
On plants you can pick this up in your local gardening store the ingredients list this as 90% sulfur, so it's not pure

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.029
But I've read that it will work for this experiment the second ingredient is zinc which as I explained?

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.989
We're gonna try filing down some pennies to get a nice zinc powder lastly

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.599
I have a metal file which I'm going to use to grind down the pennies

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.760
Hopefully I'll get a fine enough powder that it will burn our first step is to take some pennies and start filing

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.610
Now let's tape a piece of paper to the side of our clamp, so we don't lose all of our filings

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.949
There we go that doesn't look super pretty, but it should be very functional

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.940
I've now grabbed up quite a bit of zinc from our pennies, so let's put it on our scale and see how much we've got

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:05.200
Our scale says we have five point four grams of zinc powder which is a little bit more than the weight of two pennies

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.490
I've seen a few different mixed ratios of the zinc and sulfur that are supposed to work as a flash powder

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.619
I'm gonna try one two one for the first test

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.209
All right, we've got one gram of our zinc powder now, let's add one gram of our sulfur, okay?

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.988
I've now got two grams of our one-to-one mix of zinc and sulfur powder

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.830
Zinc fumes are not good to breathe in though so I am gonna try lighting this off outside

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.850
Now I'm not sure how sensitive this stuff is in theory if you've got a fine grain mixture it can even light off with static

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:39.939
Electricity so it's a good idea to be very careful with it however

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.029
I think that our filings from the pennies are gonna be a larger grain

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.750
It might be a little bit harder to ignite, so I'm going to start by trying a barbecue lighter

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.789
And then a few other things if that doesn't work

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:57.469
Oh, it's doing something oh, I wonder if it's just burning the sulfur a little bit

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.930
It's not very dark out here, so you can't see but I think the sulfur itself might have caught on fire

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.910
Okay, that's smoke rising right now. I think means it just went out

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.070
All right, the barbecue lighter didn't work

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.809
So let's go on to try using a little bit of fuse to see if the higher heat from the fuse will get it to

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.230
Ignite Wow look at that that that burned before

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.999
Kind of comes off as a shell so yeah, I think the zinc powder

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.439
Melted together, but wouldn't light that's interesting

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.049
I'm gonna use the scissors to hold the fuse down because otherwise it sort of tends to take off like a mini rocket

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.909
Kind of like that

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.480
Nothing

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:54.960
Again, I think we got some melted zinc and I think the sulfur has caught on fire again

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.409
Can you see a little bit of that blue flame in there there it is?

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.350
Yep, so that's the sulfur caught on fire

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:06.570
But the zinc won't catch on fire the barbecue lighter didn't work and the fuse didn't work

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:12.299
So I'm gonna try hitting the remaining powder with some matte gas out of the blowtorch and see if we can get a reaction out

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.300
of that

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.570
Nothing well that didn't seem to do anything either

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:26.379
I think I've successfully melted all of the zinc and probably burned all of the sulfur

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.059
But we didn't get any sort of ignition nothing that looked like flash powder nothing that looked like an explosion

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.070
So I don't think that this worked very well at all

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.939
I'm fairly certain that our problem was the size of the filings of the penny

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:42.339
So I'm gonna see if I can do something to grind them down even smaller to hopefully get a finer mesh of powder

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:47.229
I've never ground down zinc powder and a mortar and pestle before but I'm gonna try and see if it works

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:56.140
Four point three five grams of zinc and four point three five grams of sulfur I

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.369
Have my doubts that the zinc is a fine enough powder that it will ignite easily, but let's give it a try

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:15.989
Wow okay that lit yep

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.350
That's on fire. That's more of what we were looking for all right

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:25.799
We did get a reaction there it did light on fire now that might have just been because the map gas burns hot enough to

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:30.270
Ignite zinc powder. I'm not sure if the sulfur made any difference or not, but it did light

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:31.810
It was a cool green flame

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:34.229
So that was maybe a step in a better direction

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.379
But I have an idea for how we can test this at least as a proof-of-concept

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.289
Depending on the chemical reaction that took place. This is either zinc sulfide or zinc oxide

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:46.769
It's kind of hard to tell which since I don't know if the sulfur made a difference or not

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:51.299
So we barely got an ignition, and I think the problem is the size of the zinc powder

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.460
I'm not able to grind it to a fine enough point where it will really light easily to test this as a proof of concept

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:59.129
I've gone ahead and bought some commercially available zinc powder

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:04.320
And we'll use that in the mixture to see if it ignites as quickly as we're hoping it will two grams of zinc powder

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.840
two grams of sulfur powder

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:10.919
Let's go straight to math gas

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.780
Nothing Oh weird that's like

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:32.739
Gummy texture almost it's all squishy like a squishy sulfur zinc clay

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.909
That worked even less. Oh, we got some sulfur burning though blue flame

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:39.759
blue fire from burning sulfur

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.369
All right, I have one more thing we can try all right that didn't seem to work any better in fact

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.359
I think it worked less well because we were able to get our other one to light off with the map gas

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.379
But not this mixture

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:53.709
I do have one more idea there are different places that say different

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:58.689
Ratios that you're supposed to mix this - I've been trying one-to-one with equal weight of zinc and sulfur

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:03.189
But I've also seen something that says you should use three parts zinc to one part sulfur

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:07.028
So I'm gonna try that and see if it makes a difference alright. There's three grams of zinc

00:07:07.849 --> 00:07:14.079
And there's one gram of sulfur alright. This is the three to one ratio of the zinc dust to the sulfur

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:16.870
Hopefully this one works out a little better

00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:22.300
Woah

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:29.409
Alright that was a fast reaction that all just went up in a cloud all at once

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:33.370
That was really quick look at this you can see it even sprayed

00:07:34.009 --> 00:07:40.449
The reaction material all over so this is gonna be zinc sulfide all of this burned powder

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:43.838
That it just like sprayed everywhere. That's pretty cool

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.379
Alright now that was the kind of reaction

00:07:47.379 --> 00:07:51.908
I was hoping for from the beginning it went really quick it even like it launched itself through the air

00:07:51.909 --> 00:07:56.979
And you probably couldn't see very well, but there is like this mushroom shaped smoke cloud coming off it. It was pretty great

00:07:57.020 --> 00:08:00.669
Let's do that again. Okay. I've mixed up another batch spread that out on the ground

00:08:00.669 --> 00:08:06.008
I've made it into a little bit of a line to see if we get a slightly more delayed or stretched out reaction but same

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:08.009
Plan I'm just gonna hit it with the torch and watch and go

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.120
Wow

00:08:13.790 --> 00:08:20.079
It didn't slow it down pretty much at all to have it spread out the flame traveled along the line like him in an instant

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:25.120
That stuff has just a crazy amount of flash power to it very little noise

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.410
I would have thought it would be loud

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:30.939
It was just sort of a popping sound and just a very bright light a lot of smoke

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:35.830
But that looks pretty great I get why you would think that could be used as a rocket fuel

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:38.139
It's very fast burning one more time

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:48.860
Cloud kind of came right at me that time

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.360
That stuff is really fun that just goes up

00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:57.799
bright green flash and then big puff of smoke

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.820
And it's all gone in an instant and very quiet there you have it

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:07.400
We've tried mixing zinc powder and sulfur together, and we got some mixed results when filing down pennies

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.569
We couldn't get a small enough grain of zinc for it to really ignite the way we want it to

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.989
After grinding the zinc filings in a mortar and pestle for about 10 minutes

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:19.400
We were eventually able to get it to light off by hitting it with a map gas torch for a little while

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.690
That was a cool burn

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:26.119
But it wasn't really the explosive reaction we were hoping for it in the end we did unfortunately have to go some commercially available

00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:33.290
Pre-made zinc powder, but when you mix that with sulfur in the right three-to-one ratio it went off immediately those were some really cool

00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:39.950
Very fast burns bright green flame big puff of smoke that looked really cool, and I think in the near future

00:09:39.950 --> 00:09:43.369
We're going to try and use that same fuel to propel a small rocket

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.250
I would still love to be able to make this zinc powder at home

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:49.640
So if you have an idea of how I can make a fine enough zinc powder out of pennies

00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.640
Please let me know in the comments below there you have it now

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:59.059
You know that zinc powder and sulfur can be combined to make a very fast burning mixture that might work as a small rocket propellant

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.629
Thanks for joining us for this video today, and we look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:10:03.450 --> 00:10:05.450
Here you can see we've got a penny from

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.499
1974 this one should be almost entirely copper if we file off the edge

00:10:09.930 --> 00:10:12.770
Here's our 1974 penny on our 1983 penny

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:19.220
And you can see the difference when you file down both edges the penny from 1974 has a copper interior and the penny from

00:10:19.530 --> 00:10:21.530
1982 has a zinc interior

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:25.609
