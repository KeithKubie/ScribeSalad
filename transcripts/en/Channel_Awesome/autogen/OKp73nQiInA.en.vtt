00:05:59.720 --> 00:05:59.730 align:start position:0%
has to be CGI because you cannot make it
 

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
has to be CGI because you cannot make it
anyways<00:06:00.210><c> but</c><00:06:00.420><c> the</c><00:06:00.870><c> way</c><00:06:00.990><c> they</c><00:06:01.170><c> did</c><00:06:01.380><c> it</c><00:06:01.500><c> I'm</c><00:06:01.620><c> like</c>

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:01.770 align:start position:0%
anyways but the way they did it I'm like
 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
anyways but the way they did it I'm like
man<00:06:02.250><c> if</c><00:06:02.430><c> you</c><00:06:02.550><c> had</c><00:06:02.820><c> five</c><00:06:03.330><c> years</c><00:06:03.360><c> of</c><00:06:03.930><c> your</c><00:06:04.020><c> life</c>

to dedicate to this one scene you
 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
to dedicate to this one scene you
probably<00:06:06.210><c> could</c><00:06:06.510><c> because</c><00:06:06.870><c> they</c><00:06:07.020><c> did</c><00:06:07.350><c> it</c><00:06:07.470><c> with</c>

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770 align:start position:0%
probably could because they did it with
 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.370 align:start position:0%
probably could because they did it with

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
individually rendered Legos yeah so it's
 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.990 align:start position:0%
individually rendered Legos yeah so it's

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure the programmer was having
 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.150 align:start position:0%
which I'm sure the programmer was having
a<00:06:12.090><c> field</c><00:06:12.360><c> day</c><00:06:12.450><c> with</c><00:06:12.690><c> that</c><00:06:12.840><c> like</c><00:06:13.050><c> some</c><00:06:13.350><c> fish</c>

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
a field day with that like some fish
 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.770 align:start position:0%
a field day with that like some fish
it's<00:06:14.700><c> impressive</c><00:06:15.030><c> from</c><00:06:15.300><c> an</c><00:06:15.450><c> animation</c>

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:15.780 align:start position:0%
it's impressive from an animation
 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:18.710 align:start position:0%
it's impressive from an animation

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
standpoint surprisingly uh and then I
 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.660 align:start position:0%
standpoint surprisingly uh and then I
think<00:06:18.990><c> it's</c><00:06:19.170><c> impressive</c><00:06:19.860><c> from</c><00:06:20.160><c> an</c><00:06:20.310><c> animation</c>

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:20.670 align:start position:0%
think it's impressive from an animation
 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
think it's impressive from an animation
and<00:06:20.910><c> it's</c><00:06:21.480><c> impressive</c><00:06:21.870><c> from</c><00:06:22.470><c> a</c><00:06:22.680><c> community</c>

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:23.250 align:start position:0%
and it's impressive from a community
 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.190 align:start position:0%
and it's impressive from a community
standpoint<00:06:23.550><c> because</c><00:06:23.910><c> I</c><00:06:24.030><c> mean</c><00:06:24.270><c> I</c><00:06:24.300><c> can</c><00:06:24.690><c> think</c><00:06:24.960><c> of</c>

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:25.200 align:start position:0%
standpoint because I mean I can think of
 

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:28.250 align:start position:0%
standpoint because I mean I can think of
uh<00:06:25.970><c> and</c><00:06:26.970><c> like</c><00:06:27.420><c> I</c><00:06:27.450><c> said</c><00:06:27.720><c> the</c><00:06:27.870><c> story</c><00:06:27.930><c> actually</c>

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh and like I said the story actually
 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.380 align:start position:0%
uh and like I said the story actually
does<00:06:28.530><c> work</c><00:06:28.710><c> to</c><00:06:28.770><c> but</c><00:06:29.220><c> we</c><00:06:30.000><c> can't</c>

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 align:start position:0%
does work to but we can't
 

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.030 align:start position:0%
does work to but we can't
again<00:06:30.690><c> we</c><00:06:30.810><c> can't</c><00:06:31.050><c> say</c><00:06:31.230><c> why</c><00:06:31.440><c> without</c><00:06:31.710><c> ruining</c>

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:32.040 align:start position:0%
again we can't say why without ruining
 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.400 align:start position:0%
again we can't say why without ruining
it<00:06:32.310><c> uh</c><00:06:32.460><c> but</c><00:06:33.180><c> even</c><00:06:33.390><c> if</c><00:06:33.660><c> you're</c><00:06:33.840><c> watching</c><00:06:33.990><c> like</c>

one of them far it's go would have been
 

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.260 align:start position:0%
one of them far it's go would have been
fun<00:06:47.980><c> the</c><00:06:48.100><c> twist</c><00:06:48.370><c> gives</c><00:06:48.580><c> it</c><00:06:48.730><c> sort</c><00:06:48.850><c> of</c><00:06:48.970><c> a</c><00:06:49.060><c> sense</c>

00:06:49.260 --> 00:06:49.270 align:start position:0%
fun the twist gives it sort of a sense
 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
fun the twist gives it sort of a sense
of<00:06:49.360><c> meaning</c><00:06:49.570><c> to</c><00:06:49.990><c> it</c><00:06:50.140><c> that</c><00:06:50.500><c> elevates</c><00:06:51.130><c> it</c><00:06:51.340><c> a</c><00:06:51.400><c> bit</c>

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:51.550 align:start position:0%
of meaning to it that elevates it a bit
 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:52.920 align:start position:0%
of meaning to it that elevates it a bit
but<00:06:51.700><c> I</c><00:06:51.730><c> mean</c><00:06:51.910><c> even</c><00:06:52.120><c> if</c><00:06:52.270><c> I'm</c><00:06:52.540><c> thinking</c><00:06:52.690><c> like</c>

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:52.930 align:start position:0%
but I mean even if I'm thinking like
 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
but I mean even if I'm thinking like
what<00:06:53.350><c> if</c><00:06:53.440><c> you</c><00:06:53.500><c> remove</c><00:06:53.740><c> the</c><00:06:53.860><c> twist</c><00:06:54.040><c> this</c><00:06:54.250><c> is</c>

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:54.370 align:start position:0%
what if you remove the twist this is
 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
what if you remove the twist this is
just<00:06:54.550><c> straight-up</c><00:06:54.880><c> story</c><00:06:55.330><c> I'm</c><00:06:56.230><c> like</c><00:06:56.500><c> I</c><00:06:57.390><c> still</c>
