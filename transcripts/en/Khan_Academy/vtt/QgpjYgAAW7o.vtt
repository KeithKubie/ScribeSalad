00:00:00.947 --> 00:00:03.323
- [Instructor] The twice
differentiable function G

00:00:03.323 --> 00:00:07.232
and its second derivative
G prime prime are graphed.

00:00:07.232 --> 00:00:08.788
And you can see it right over here.

00:00:08.788 --> 00:00:10.802
I'm actually working off of the article

00:00:10.802 --> 00:00:12.441
on Khan Academy called

00:00:12.441 --> 00:00:14.942
Justifying Using Second Derivatives.

00:00:14.942 --> 00:00:16.427
So we see our function G.

00:00:16.427 --> 00:00:18.239
And we see not its first derivative

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:19.726
but its second derivative here

00:00:19.726 --> 00:00:21.089
in this brown color.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:23.505
So then, the article goes on to say,

00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:24.938
or the problem goes on to say,

00:00:24.938 --> 00:00:27.362
four students were asked
to give an appropriate

00:00:27.362 --> 00:00:30.497
calculus-based justification for the fact

00:00:30.497 --> 00:00:34.664
that G has an inflection point
at X equals negative two.

00:00:35.863 --> 00:00:38.213
So let's just feel good
that at least intuitively

00:00:38.213 --> 00:00:39.216
it feels right.

00:00:39.216 --> 00:00:41.198
So X equals negative two, remember what

00:00:41.198 --> 00:00:42.414
an inflection point is.

00:00:42.414 --> 00:00:44.387
It's where we're going
from concave downwards

00:00:44.387 --> 00:00:45.597
to concave upwards.

00:00:45.597 --> 00:00:48.306
Or, concave upwards to concave downwards.

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:50.026
Or another way to think about it

00:00:50.026 --> 00:00:51.551
it's a situation where

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:54.215
our slope goes from
decreasing to increasing,

00:00:54.215 --> 00:00:56.334
or from increasing to decreasing.

00:00:56.334 --> 00:00:57.970
And when we look at it
over here, it looks like

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.604
our slope is decreasing, it's positive,

00:01:00.604 --> 00:01:02.588
but it's decreasing, it goes to zero.

00:01:02.588 --> 00:01:05.301
Then it keeps decreasing, it becomes

00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:06.514
it's negative now.

00:01:06.514 --> 00:01:08.187
It keeps decreasing until we get to about

00:01:08.187 --> 00:01:09.184
X equals negative two

00:01:09.184 --> 00:01:11.164
and then it seems that it's increasing,

00:01:11.164 --> 00:01:13.410
it's getting less and less
and less and less negative.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.257
It looks like it's a zero right over here

00:01:15.257 --> 00:01:17.398
then it just keeps
increasing, it gets more

00:01:17.398 --> 00:01:18.774
and more and more positive.

00:01:18.774 --> 00:01:22.166
So it does, indeed, look
like at X equals negative two

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:24.437
we go from being concave downwards

00:01:24.437 --> 00:01:26.157
to concave upwards.

00:01:26.157 --> 00:01:28.747
Now a calculus based justification

00:01:28.747 --> 00:01:31.394
is we could look at its,
at the second derivative

00:01:31.394 --> 00:01:33.535
and see where the second derivative

00:01:33.535 --> 00:01:35.193
crosses the X-axis.

00:01:35.193 --> 00:01:37.813
Because where the second
derivative is negative

00:01:37.813 --> 00:01:40.167
that means our slope is decreasing

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:41.952
we are concave downwards.

00:01:41.952 --> 00:01:43.951
And where the second
derivative is positive

00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:46.435
it means our first derivative

00:01:46.435 --> 00:01:49.032
is increasing, our slope
of our original function

00:01:49.032 --> 00:01:50.669
is increasing and we are concave upwards.

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:53.677
So notice, we do indeed,
the second derivative

00:01:53.677 --> 00:01:55.966
does indeed cross the X-axis

00:01:55.966 --> 00:01:58.351
at X equals negative two.

00:01:58.351 --> 00:02:00.929
It's not enough for it to just be zero

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:01.923
or touch the X-axis,

00:02:01.923 --> 00:02:05.009
it needs to cross the
X-axis in order for us

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.470
to have an inflection point there.

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.824
So given that, let's look at the students

00:02:08.824 --> 00:02:10.755
in justifications and see

00:02:10.755 --> 00:02:12.972
what we can, if we can kind of play

00:02:12.972 --> 00:02:14.696
put the teacher hat in our mind

00:02:14.696 --> 00:02:16.036
and say what a teacher would say

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:17.657
for the different justifications.

00:02:17.657 --> 00:02:20.025
So the first one says,
the second derivative of G

00:02:20.025 --> 00:02:23.074
changes signs at X equals negative two.

00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:25.991
Well that's exactly what
we were just talking about.

00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:29.001
If the second derivative changes signs

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.253
in this case, it goes
from negative to positive,

00:02:31.253 --> 00:02:34.020
that means our first derivative went from

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.616
decreasing to increasing.

00:02:35.616 --> 00:02:39.083
Which is indeed, good for saying this is a

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:41.043
calculus-based justification.

00:02:41.043 --> 00:02:42.851
So, at least for now I'm gonna put

00:02:42.851 --> 00:02:45.182
kudos you are correct there.

00:02:45.182 --> 00:02:47.408
It crosses the X-axis.

00:02:47.408 --> 00:02:49.435
So this is ambiguous.

00:02:49.435 --> 00:02:50.724
What is crossing the X-axis?

00:02:50.724 --> 00:02:51.908
If a student wrote this I'd say,

00:02:51.908 --> 00:02:52.941
what are they talking about, the function,

00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:54.074
are they talking about
the first derivative,

00:02:54.074 --> 00:02:55.687
the second derivative.

00:02:55.687 --> 00:02:58.483
And so I would say, please
use more precise language.

00:02:58.483 --> 00:03:01.234
This cannot be accepted as
a correct justification.

00:03:01.234 --> 00:03:03.203
I will read the other ones.

00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:05.241
The second derivative of G is

00:03:05.241 --> 00:03:07.074
increasing at X equals

00:03:08.354 --> 00:03:09.569
negative two.

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.546
Well no, that doesn't justify

00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:13.230
why you have an inflection point there.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.524
For example,

00:03:14.524 --> 00:03:17.038
the second derivative is increasing

00:03:17.038 --> 00:03:19.121
at X equals negative 2.5.

00:03:20.238 --> 00:03:22.235
The second derivative is even increasing

00:03:22.235 --> 00:03:23.383
at X equals

00:03:23.383 --> 00:03:24.401
negative one.

00:03:24.401 --> 00:03:25.939
But you don't have an inflection point

00:03:25.939 --> 00:03:27.138
at those places.

00:03:27.138 --> 00:03:29.095
So I would say, this doesn't justify

00:03:29.095 --> 00:03:30.509
why G has an inflection point.

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:33.596
And then the last student response,

00:03:33.596 --> 00:03:35.544
the graph of G changes concavity

00:03:35.544 --> 00:03:37.304
at X equals negative two.

00:03:37.304 --> 00:03:38.976
That is true

00:03:38.976 --> 00:03:42.192
but that isn't a
calculus-based justification.

00:03:42.192 --> 00:03:45.903
We'd want to use our
second derivative here.
