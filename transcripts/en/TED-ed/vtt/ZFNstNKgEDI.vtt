00:00:06.553 --> 00:00:08.883
Have you ever sat in a doctor's
office for hours

00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:12.083
despite having an appointment
at a specific time?

00:00:12.083 --> 00:00:16.253
Has a hotel turned down
your reservation because it's full?

00:00:16.253 --> 00:00:20.264
Or have you been bumped off a flight
that you paid for?

00:00:20.264 --> 00:00:22.803
These are all symptoms of overbooking,

00:00:22.803 --> 00:00:25.015
a practice where businesses
and institutions

00:00:25.015 --> 00:00:29.034
sell or book more 
than their full capacity.

00:00:29.034 --> 00:00:31.264
While often infuriating for the customer,

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.715
overbooking happens because
it increases profits

00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:37.805
while also letting businesses
optimize their resources.

00:00:37.805 --> 00:00:40.786
They know that not everyone
will show up to their appointments,

00:00:40.786 --> 00:00:41.565
reservations,

00:00:41.565 --> 00:00:42.525
and flights,

00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:46.667
so they make more available
than they actually have to offer.

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:51.455
Airlines are the classical example,
partially because it happens so often.

00:00:51.455 --> 00:00:55.407
About 50,000 people get bumped
off their flights each year.

00:00:55.407 --> 00:00:59.426
That figure comes at little surprise
to the airlines themselves,

00:00:59.426 --> 00:01:04.207
which use statistics to determine
exactly how many tickets to sell.

00:01:04.207 --> 00:01:05.607
It's a delicate operation.

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:08.886
Sell too few, and they're wasting seats.

00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:12.507
Sell too many, and they pay penalties -

00:01:12.507 --> 00:01:17.727
money, free flights, hotel stays,
and annoyed customers.

00:01:17.727 --> 00:01:21.556
So here's a simplified version
of how their calculations work.

00:01:21.556 --> 00:01:24.268
Airlines have collected years worth
of information

00:01:24.268 --> 00:01:28.389
about who does and doesn't show up
for certain flights.

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:31.047
They know, for example,
that on a particular route,

00:01:31.047 --> 00:01:37.047
the probability that each individual
customer will show up on time is 90%.

00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:38.513
For the sake of simplicity,

00:01:38.513 --> 00:01:41.372
we'll assume that every customer
is traveling individually

00:01:41.372 --> 00:01:44.182
rather than as families or groups.

00:01:44.182 --> 00:01:49.652
Then, if there are 180 seats on the plane
and they sell 180 tickets,

00:01:49.652 --> 00:01:54.832
the most likely result is that 162
passengers will board.

00:01:54.832 --> 00:01:58.132
But, of course, you could also
end up with more passengers,

00:01:58.132 --> 00:02:00.121
or fewer.

00:02:00.121 --> 00:02:02.773
The probability for each value
is given by what's called

00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:04.976
a binomial distribution,

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:07.783
which peaks at the most likely outcome.

00:02:07.783 --> 00:02:09.764
Now let's look at the revenue.

00:02:09.764 --> 00:02:11.913
The airline makes money from each
ticket buyer

00:02:11.913 --> 00:02:15.095
and loses money for each person
who gets bumped.

00:02:15.095 --> 00:02:20.984
Let's say a ticket costs $250
and isn't exchangeable for a later flight.

00:02:20.984 --> 00:02:24.834
And the cost of bumping 
a passenger is $800.

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:27.084
These numbers are just for the sake
of example.

00:02:27.084 --> 00:02:29.654
Actual amounts vary considerably.

00:02:29.654 --> 00:02:36.084
So here, if you don't sell
any extra tickets, you make $45,000.

00:02:36.084 --> 00:02:40.396
If you sell 15 extras
and at least 15 people are no shows,

00:02:40.396 --> 00:02:44.056
you make $48,750.

00:02:44.056 --> 00:02:46.115
That's the best case.

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:48.845
In the worst case, everyone shows up.

00:02:48.845 --> 00:02:55.669
15 unlucky passengers get bumped,
and the revenue will only be $36,750,

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.777
even less than if you only sold 180
tickets in the first place.

00:02:59.777 --> 00:03:03.928
But what matters isn't just how
good or bad a scenario is financially,

00:03:03.928 --> 00:03:06.776
but how likely it is to happen.

00:03:06.776 --> 00:03:09.596
So how likely is each scenario?

00:03:09.596 --> 00:03:13.116
We can find out by using
the binomial distribution.

00:03:13.116 --> 00:03:18.517
In this example, the probability
of exactly 195 passengers boarding

00:03:18.517 --> 00:03:21.167
is almost 0%.

00:03:21.167 --> 00:03:28.738
The probability of exactly 184 passengers
boarding is 1.11%, and so on.

00:03:28.738 --> 00:03:32.437
Multiply these probabilities
by the revenue for each case,

00:03:32.437 --> 00:03:33.839
add them all up,

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:38.117
and subtract the sum from the earnings
by 195 sold tickets,

00:03:38.117 --> 00:03:43.616
and you get the expected revenue
for selling 195 tickets.

00:03:43.616 --> 00:03:47.038
By repeating this calculation
for various numbers of extra tickets,

00:03:47.038 --> 00:03:51.087
the airline can find the one likely
to yield the highest revenue.

00:03:51.087 --> 00:03:54.527
In this example, that's 198 tickets,

00:03:54.527 --> 00:03:59.977
from which the airline will probably
make $48,774,

00:03:59.977 --> 00:04:03.448
almost 4,000 more than without
overbooking.

00:04:03.448 --> 00:04:05.857
And that's just for one flight.

00:04:05.857 --> 00:04:09.137
Multiply that by a million flights
per airline per year,

00:04:09.137 --> 00:04:12.012
and overbooking adds up fast.

00:04:12.012 --> 00:04:15.763
Of course, the actual calculation
is much more complicated.

00:04:15.763 --> 00:04:19.694
Airlines apply many factors
to create even more accurate models.

00:04:19.694 --> 00:04:21.709
But should they?

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:24.559
Some argue that overbooking is unethical.

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:28.259
You're charging two people 
for the same resource.

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:31.069
Of course, if you're 100% sure 
someone won't show up,

00:04:31.069 --> 00:04:33.430
it's fine to sell their seat.

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.520
But what if you're only 95% sure?

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.719
75%?

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:43.754
Is there a number that separates being
unethical from being practical?
