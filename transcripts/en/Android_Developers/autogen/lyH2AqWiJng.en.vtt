and we found there was social source of
some slowdown and we were able to

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790
some slowdown and we were able to
 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.549
some slowdown and we were able to
optimize our views by using relative

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559
optimize our views by using relative

that anyone new to the platform

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120
that anyone new to the platform
 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.540
that anyone new to the platform
familiarize themselves with all the

familiarize themselves with all the
 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.740
familiarize themselves with all the
various view groups and how they're

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750
various view groups and how they're
 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.450
various view groups and how they're
implemented so they can keep their views

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460
implemented so they can keep their views
 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.750
implemented so they can keep their views
as responsive as possible
