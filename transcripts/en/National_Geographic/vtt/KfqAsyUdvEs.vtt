00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.671
( intro music )

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.051
( applause )

00:00:19.051 --> 00:00:23.089
Pan Conrad: We are on Mars!

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:26.993 line:0%
So, I'm going to go way back

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:28.527 line:0%
and to facilitate that

00:00:28.527 --> 00:00:31.598 line:0%
I've provided you
with my way back machine...

00:00:31.598 --> 00:00:33.633 line:0%
a blank slate.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.435
Because I want to take you
so far back,

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:38.437
we don't have a picture
of that.

00:00:38.437 --> 00:00:41.841
About 4.6 billion years ago,

00:00:41.841 --> 00:00:44.177
when the Universe was just
a little more than

00:00:44.177 --> 00:00:48.781
half as old as it is now,
the Solar System formed.

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:52.184
And it was
a supreme act of violence.

00:00:52.184 --> 00:00:54.787
<i> The sun was in the center,</i>

00:00:54.787 --> 00:00:58.992
<i> big hunks of rock were made
 from little hunks of rock,</i>

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.794
<i> which were made from
 little tiny grains.</i>

00:01:01.794 --> 00:01:05.465
<i> How everything came together
 was a function</i>

00:01:05.465 --> 00:01:08.267
<i> of the chemistry
 of the materials.</i>

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.502
<i> And the chemistry
 of the materials changed</i>

00:01:10.502 --> 00:01:12.905
<i> as a function
 of the relationships</i>

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:16.175
<i> between all these
 little bits of stuff.</i>

00:01:16.175 --> 00:01:18.611
When the bits of stuff became
bigger bits of stuff,

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.214
and we had big rocks
and then the big rocks became

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:25.918
really big rocks and they
glommed into each other,

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:28.387
we started getting these
protoplanets.

00:01:28.387 --> 00:01:32.992
And these big hunks of rock
that we call 'planetesimals'

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:35.127
generated
so much heat and pressure,

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:37.396
by the time you got
sufficient mass

00:01:37.396 --> 00:01:40.733
that you got a lot of melting
and recrystallization

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:43.169
and before you knew it,
well not before you knew it,

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:47.607
it did take
till 4.6 billion years ago.

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:50.709
<i> We got something that was
 an amalgamated planet</i>

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:53.045
<i> and that is
 the infancy of the Earth.</i>

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:55.215
<i> That is the infancy of
 all the planets</i>

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:57.116
and depending upon
where they sit

00:01:57.116 --> 00:01:59.752
with respect
to their central star

00:01:59.752 --> 00:02:02.955
and where they sit
with respect to each other,

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:05.624
they are all
a little bit different.

00:02:05.624 --> 00:02:08.560
<i> Our closest neighbor is Mars.</i>

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.631
<i> So, the reason we go to Mars
 is because</i>

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.900
<i> we want to understand
 ourselves.</i>

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.135
<i> Well, what can we learn about
 ourselves on Mars</i>

00:02:16.135 --> 00:02:18.137
<i> that we can't learn here?</i>

00:02:18.137 --> 00:02:22.775
During that
4.6 billion years of violence,

00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:27.814
some time we came to
a period of enough quiescence

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:31.651
so that we could begin to cool
on the surface.

00:02:31.651 --> 00:02:34.086
<i> And as the planet began to
 off gas</i>

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:36.055
<i> its hot interior a little bit</i>

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:40.059
<i> and create water,
 and create atmosphere,</i>

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:43.496
<i> we began to mature
 as a planet.</i>

00:02:43.496 --> 00:02:48.134
Somewhere between that
4.6 billion years

00:02:48.134 --> 00:02:53.206
and the 3.8 billion years
to which we can go back,

00:02:53.206 --> 00:02:57.576
we got life, but we don't know
exactly when,

00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:00.946
and we don't know exactly how.

00:03:00.946 --> 00:03:04.116
Our planet is
such a benefit to us in that

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:07.119
its surface keeps
reshaping itself.

00:03:07.119 --> 00:03:10.690
The skin basically dives
underneath itself.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:11.824
And that's good because

00:03:11.824 --> 00:03:13.692
that's how we recycle
our materials,

00:03:13.692 --> 00:03:14.860
but it is also bad

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.198
because the evidence
of our deep past... gone.

00:03:19.198 --> 00:03:21.200
Mars on the other hand

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.804
hasn't got all that activity
on the surface.

00:03:24.804 --> 00:03:28.908
Around 4 billion years ago,
4.1 to 3.9,

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:30.643
it was a really 'bad day'

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:34.980
and I use the term loosely
in our solar system,

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.349
another bunch of rogue

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.920
planetesimals came crashing
through the inner solar system

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.156
slamming into the planets

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:45.724
and you see the evidence today
by all the craters

00:03:45.724 --> 00:03:47.960
<i> on the moon, on Mars,
 on Mercury.</i>

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.796
<i> We can't quite see
 through the atmosphere</i>

00:03:49.796 --> 00:03:51.263
<i> on Venus very well</i>

00:03:51.263 --> 00:03:54.767
<i> and we've got that pesky
 ocean-covering on the Earth.</i>

00:03:54.767 --> 00:03:56.969
So, a lot of the evidence
on Earth

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.805
is... is very cryptic.

00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:04.043
But somehow during that time,
we recovered

00:04:04.043 --> 00:04:06.212
and we got
this robust biosphere.

00:04:06.212 --> 00:04:08.214
Obviously we are all here
tonight reading

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:10.817
the National Geographic,
right?

00:04:10.817 --> 00:04:13.419
But not so on Mars.

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:18.024
Mars looks very different
than Earth looks right now.

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:22.595
In that window of time
between 4.6 billion years

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.030
and that team of
bandit asteroids

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.531
that came through,

00:04:26.531 --> 00:04:30.669
was a 400 million year window.

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.040
If life formed here then
could it have formed on Mars?

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.845
And if it did form on Mars,

00:04:38.845 --> 00:04:41.480
where did it go?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.518
<i> Mars, we know had water on it.
 The evidence is ample.</i>

00:04:46.518 --> 00:04:48.921
<i> Not just water flowing
 and shaping,</i>

00:04:48.921 --> 00:04:51.424
<i> and weathering
 the surface of Mars,</i>

00:04:51.424 --> 00:04:55.627
<i> but water standing
 in a still pool.</i>

00:04:55.627 --> 00:04:58.797
<i> The evidence of which we found
 at Yellowknife Bay,</i>

00:04:58.797 --> 00:05:01.233
<i> the chemistry of which was
 benign enough</i>

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.869
<i> that it could've been
 habitable for life</i>

00:05:03.869 --> 00:05:06.271
<i> from a chemical point of view.</i>

00:05:06.271 --> 00:05:09.574
<i> But somewhere between this...</i>

00:05:09.574 --> 00:05:12.812
<i> and this, conditions changed.</i>

00:05:12.812 --> 00:05:14.479
<i> So, the question is</i>

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:18.684
<i> when did they change
 and what happened?</i>

00:05:18.684 --> 00:05:22.755
<i> So, we are standing here
 at this image,</i>

00:05:22.755 --> 00:05:24.490
<i> at Yellowknife Bay.</i>

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.492
<i> It looks a lot like
 a dried lakebed</i>

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:29.795
<i> and we came to the conclusion
 that that's the best model,</i>

00:05:29.795 --> 00:05:32.097
<i> for what that environment
 was like.</i>

00:05:32.097 --> 00:05:35.033
So now,
I'm going to ask you question.

00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:39.439
We've got the minerals.
We've got the water.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:41.807
We did some chemical analyses
and we determined

00:05:41.807 --> 00:05:43.909
we have the canonical
six elements

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:48.681
that we deem to be requisite
for life on Earth,

00:05:48.681 --> 00:05:50.616
but what else?

00:05:50.616 --> 00:05:52.951
What are we not seeing,
that tells us

00:05:52.951 --> 00:05:56.122
that an environment
could be habitable or not.

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:58.190
It's like
when you go to buy a house,

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.993
what is the owner covering up
that you don't discover

00:06:00.993 --> 00:06:04.363
until you've signed
for the mortgage.

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:08.100
But one clue
is the atmosphere.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:09.335
We are trying to figure out

00:06:09.335 --> 00:06:12.304
when the atmosphere got
so thin.

00:06:12.304 --> 00:06:14.140
I told you about
the rogue asteroids

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:15.441
coming through.

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:18.644
Unfortunately,
during the time of attack

00:06:18.644 --> 00:06:21.146
Mars lost its geo-dynamo...

00:06:21.146 --> 00:06:24.416
that is the convection
of metallic stuff

00:06:24.416 --> 00:06:26.152
in the interior of the planet

00:06:26.152 --> 00:06:28.120
that generates
a magnetic field

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.757
like our own protective
magnetic field,

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:33.859
which is really key
for protecting an atmosphere

00:06:33.859 --> 00:06:36.628
and preventing it from being
ionized away

00:06:36.628 --> 00:06:38.364
by the galactic cosmic rays

00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:40.299
and the solar energetic
particles

00:06:40.299 --> 00:06:42.501
all of which can do
your atmosphere dirt

00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:45.204
until you are left with this
thin little scum of air,

00:06:45.204 --> 00:06:47.907
which is what Mars
presently has.

00:06:47.907 --> 00:06:49.976
So, I ask you
to think about this.

00:06:49.976 --> 00:06:54.513
The chemistry was right,
the minerals were right...

00:06:54.513 --> 00:06:56.916
was the atmosphere right?
We don't know.

00:06:56.916 --> 00:06:58.884
So, then it tells us
two things.

00:06:58.884 --> 00:07:00.786
You gotta have
all the right stuff together

00:07:00.786 --> 00:07:02.487
in the right place,

00:07:02.487 --> 00:07:04.256
but you also have to
have everything together

00:07:04.256 --> 00:07:05.658
at the right time.

00:07:05.658 --> 00:07:08.361
So, the evolution
of the environment,

00:07:08.361 --> 00:07:11.330
not just in space,
but in time, is key

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:14.800
to determining whether or not
it is a habitable one.

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.369
<i> And so Curiosity came to
 Gale Crater</i>

00:07:17.369 --> 00:07:19.305
<i> to look at a bunch of history</i>

00:07:19.305 --> 00:07:21.774
<i> hoping that
 one of those layers of rock</i>

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:24.810
<i> might be the Dead Sea Scroll
 equivalent on Mars</i>

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:26.445
<i> that would tell us
 the secrets</i>

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:29.281
<i> of the evolution
 of the Martian surface.</i>

00:07:29.281 --> 00:07:31.450
Allow us to get
a little glimpse

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:32.885
into that window of history

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:37.322
that might tell us Mars had
or had not evolved life.

00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:41.160
At least we can evaluate Mars
from the perspective of

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:44.797
the most tolerant and
cosmopolitan life on Earth

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:47.400
that would be
the prokaryotic microbes.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.269
And so we measured these rocks
at Gale Crater,

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:52.938
in Yellowknife Bay
and we determined that

00:07:52.938 --> 00:07:57.109
the past environment
was probably hospitable

00:07:57.109 --> 00:08:01.247
for that type of Earth life.
Check.

00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:07.019
Then we took a step further
and we dated that rock.

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:08.754
Now the problem is the
error bars

00:08:08.754 --> 00:08:11.390
on an age date are huge.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.294
So, we don't really know with
precision the age,

00:08:15.294 --> 00:08:18.731
but we do know
when the rock was exposed.

00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:21.467
And we are now proceeding
to do likewise

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:22.735
on other rocks on Mars,

00:08:22.735 --> 00:08:24.569
so stay tuned
for more of that.

00:08:24.569 --> 00:08:26.772
But the point is,
you've gotta know

00:08:26.772 --> 00:08:29.074
what you've got,
where you've got it,

00:08:29.074 --> 00:08:31.310
and if it is all together
at the same time

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.677
in order to
make a judgment like,

00:08:32.677 --> 00:08:36.182
is the environment habitable?

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.350
<i> We can't do this alone.</i>

00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:41.387
<i> It takes the missions
 that came before us.</i>

00:08:41.387 --> 00:08:45.658
<i> The Viking, the Pathfinder,
 Spirit And Opportunity,</i>

00:08:45.658 --> 00:08:48.594
<i> and the orbital assets
 that are presently there</i>

00:08:48.594 --> 00:08:51.964
<i> to pick out the good spot
 and to guide us</i>

00:08:51.964 --> 00:08:54.366
<i> as we can pick up and go.</i>

00:08:54.366 --> 00:08:56.869
<i> Viking was an amazing mission,</i>

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:58.604
<i> but it couldn't
 get up and move to</i>

00:08:58.604 --> 00:09:00.573
<i> where the action is.</i>

00:09:00.573 --> 00:09:03.341
<i> We could and that's why
 we decided</i>

00:09:03.341 --> 00:09:05.711
<i> instead of going to
 Mount Sharp first,</i>

00:09:05.711 --> 00:09:08.647
<i> where all that history reading
 awaits,</i>

00:09:08.647 --> 00:09:11.116
<i> and we'll get there.</i>

00:09:11.116 --> 00:09:13.786
<i> We decided
 we needed to take a look first</i>

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:15.821
<i> at promising rock</i>

00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:19.124
<i> even in the midst of the lure
 of the history</i>

00:09:19.124 --> 00:09:21.326
<i> awaiting us on Mount Sharp.</i>

00:09:21.326 --> 00:09:22.494
And so we decided

00:09:22.494 --> 00:09:25.698
instead of going to
Mount Sharp, to the left,

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:28.701
that we would go to the right,
and check out

00:09:28.701 --> 00:09:31.836
<i> these interesting rocks,
 these features,</i>

00:09:31.836 --> 00:09:33.706
<i> these sedimentary structures</i>

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:37.910
<i> that portended
 a right sweet spot in history</i>

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.679
<i> when we might have had
 a habitable environment</i>

00:09:40.679 --> 00:09:43.349
<i> and so we went
 to Yellowknife Bay</i>

00:09:43.349 --> 00:09:45.384
<i> and I'm not going to describe
 the features</i>

00:09:45.384 --> 00:09:47.352
<i> of the three different rock
 types,</i>

00:09:47.352 --> 00:09:49.989
<i> but let me point out that
 that's key.</i>

00:09:49.989 --> 00:09:53.492
<i> You are not just looking
 at one event in time,</i>

00:09:53.492 --> 00:09:56.595
<i> you are looking
 at a change in time.</i>

00:09:56.595 --> 00:09:58.898
We are going across
the horizon,

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.232
over the edge of the world

00:10:00.232 --> 00:10:03.269
and looking at
three different eras.

00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:05.471
When we drilled the hole
there,

00:10:05.471 --> 00:10:08.306
<i> we showed that
 it was important</i>

00:10:08.306 --> 00:10:10.610
<i> to have a human
 make a decision,</i>

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.944
<i> not to just blindly
 make a plan and go there</i>

00:10:12.944 --> 00:10:14.914
<i> because
 of the sake of the plan.</i>

00:10:14.914 --> 00:10:18.150
<i> But to respond to the science
 in real time.</i>

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:19.718
Go to where the action is,

00:10:19.718 --> 00:10:21.787
go to
where the science story is,

00:10:21.787 --> 00:10:23.622
so we are not at the dock

00:10:23.622 --> 00:10:25.190
waiting for our ship
to come in,

00:10:25.190 --> 00:10:28.260
when it flies into
national airport.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:31.430
<i> So, we continue to explore.</i>

00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:33.766
<i> I love this selfie because</i>

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:36.335
<i> I can't tell you
 how amazing it is</i>

00:10:36.335 --> 00:10:37.870
<i> to get up every day,</i>

00:10:37.870 --> 00:10:39.972
<i> log on
 to the latest from Mars,</i>

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:42.741
<i> occasionally catch a glimpse
 of our own selves,</i>

00:10:42.741 --> 00:10:45.311
<i> and see stuff
 that I touched and made,</i>

00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.212
<i> and it's on Mars!</i>

00:10:47.212 --> 00:10:49.347
( laughter )

00:10:49.347 --> 00:10:51.350
<i> So, stay with us.
 There's more to go.</i>

00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:53.018
<i> We've finished
 our prime mission.</i>

00:10:53.018 --> 00:10:54.920
<i> We've been there
 for two years.</i>

00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.955
<i> It's a very exciting time</i>

00:10:56.955 --> 00:11:00.025
<i> and there are
 more exciting times ahead.</i>

00:11:00.025 --> 00:11:01.293
( applause )

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:08.067
( outro music )
