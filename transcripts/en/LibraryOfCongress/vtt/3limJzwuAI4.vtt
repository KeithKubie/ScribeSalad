&gt;&gt;From the Library of
Congress from Washington DC.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.510
&gt;&gt;Good morning!

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.810
I'm Carla Hayden, the
Librarian of Congress and I want

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.550
to welcome you to this
very special Story Time

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.850
at the Library.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.750
I love reading, don't you?

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.800
It's so much fun to let
our imaginations run wild.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.530
We're excited to be teaming

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.940
up with Ms. Dolly Parton's
Imagination Library

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.670
to introduce you to
some wonderful authors

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.650
who will share their
stories with us.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.680
Ms. Parton's work through
her Imagination Library

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.660
is awe-inspiring!

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.280
She and her team have given
away over 100 million books

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.600
to help encourage young readers
like you across the world.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.510
Here at the Library of
Congress we share that passion

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.260
for developing young readers!

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.280
And we know that the best way
to encourage people like you

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.450
to read is to make reading fun!

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:05.880
So that's what we're here to do.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.650
I hope you enjoy
today's story time!

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.840
Even more, I hope you keep
reading at home and having fun!

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.680
Today, you will warm up
by singing some songs,

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:23.010
touching your toes, and
then get comfortable

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:26.070
and get ready to hear stories.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.640
Now let's get started!

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.570
&gt;&gt;Welcome everybody to storytime
and the library of Congress.

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.210
We are here in this
beautiful room

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:38.110
and we have a very great story.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:39.410
I am sorry.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.920
I am not on.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.220
There I am.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.890
Welcome to everyone and everyone

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.790

and my name is Caroline

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.960
and this is Laura Murray, the
author of the gingerbread man.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.830
So today we are going to
start off with our hello,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:07.260
song and we just need to
learn a little bit of sign.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.480
So in salute for hello,
and then friends is

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.870

way and then the other way,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.260
condom hugging, friends,
hello, friends three times.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.340
Hello, friends and
then it is time --

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:27.620
touch or watch -- to say hello!

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.230
Okay? All right.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.530
. Let's go.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:38.720
Hello, friends, hello,
friends, hello, friends;

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.600
it's time to say hello!

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.300
(Applause) Good job.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.050
All right.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.940
Let's do our brains.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.200
Open, shut them,
open, shut them,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.000
put them in your lap, lap, lap.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.570
Close them, put them
near your chin, Chin,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:19.710
open up your little mouths --
let them in -- open, shut them,

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:28.710
open them, shut them, give
a little clap, clap, clap.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.470
Open them, shut them,
open, shut them.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.230
Put them in your lap, lap, lap.

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.620
Creep them, call them,
creep them, called them,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.770
right up to your
chin, chin, chin.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:50.300
Open up your little mouths
and do not let them in.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.600
Yeah! Yeah!

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.380
(Applause) All right.

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.180
So Laura, can you read us
some of the gingerbread man,

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.060
loose on the fire truck? »

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.600
LAURA MURRAY: Thank
you, so much.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.780
I am a very excited
person to be here today.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.630
My name is Laura Murray and
I am a children's author

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.750
and I also write the
words to the stories.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.990
And my stories are
about a gingerbread man!

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.870
And there is a series of them.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.170
The one at that we are going

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:27.580
to read today is the
second in the series.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:32.150
It is called, "The gingerbread
man, loose on the fire truck"

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.110
but before we read
this, you might want

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.550
to know why there
is a gingerbread man

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.060
on the fire truck?

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.170
And it starts with
the very first book.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:47.130
So a gingerbread man is made
by a classroom full of kids

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.160
and he gets to be
part of their class!

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.670
And since he is part of their
class, then he gets to go

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:56.930
on field trips with them.

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:02.150
So his first field trip
is to the fire station!

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.870
So let's get started!

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.540
Now I would like you
to help me if you can.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.460
Would you like to know how?

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.660
Okay. We will read a
story in this is our plan.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.890
When I say gingerbread,
you say man!

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:20.500
So let's try it --
gingerbread. »

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.320
: Man. » LAURA
MURRAY: Gingerbread. »

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:24.620
: Man. » LAURA
MURRAY: You guys got it.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.420
Let's try it with the title.

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:27.880
The gingerbread. »

00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.630
: Man. » LAURA MURRAY:
Loose on the fire chief --

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:35.920
fire truck by Laura Murray, that
is me because I wrote the words,

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.620
illustrated by Michael Lowery.

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.830
He drew the what do you think?

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.210
The pictures!

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.510
The pictures.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.760
Okay. So here we go.

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.130
On a bright Monday morning,
my teacher breezed in.

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.060
Let's all make a circle.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.950
It's time to begin.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:59.330
She winked and then whispered,
our field trip's today.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:04.220
The classroom erupted
with shouts of, "Hooray!

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.580
" Very good We're riding the
bus to the big fire station,

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.730
to meet firefighters and
Spot, their Dalmatian.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.380
So Sophia leaned down and
said, "You're coming too.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:22.850
You're our gingerbread man
-- we wouldn't leave you.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.260
Just jump in my backpack,
I'll give you a ride.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:30.890
There's a pocket for you
over here on the side.

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:32.790
The pocket was cozy.

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:34.760
I peeked from the top.

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.910
The bus drove 4 miles then
came to a stop In front

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.610
of the building with shiny red
doors stood two firefighters

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:47.630
from Company 4.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.430
One had on gear for
a quick demonstration

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:57.430
and standing beside him
was Spot, the Dalmatian.

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.900
That's right.

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:03.030
And the firefighter has
on goggles, a helmet,

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:11.050
and oxygen tank, a flashlight,
an axe, gloves, and boots.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.360
And in Spot the dog!

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.900
I was jostled and jiggled
as kids moved about.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.070
Then I fell from the pocket
right on the dog's snout!

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.260
Is that a good place for
a gingerbread man to be?

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:34.100
Ohno! Spot sniffed at my
face, taking one sticky lick.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.380
I needed a trick to
get out of there quick!

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.430
He tossed me up high
with his mouth open wide,

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:45.340
but I flipped toward his tail
and slid down like a slide.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.950
Weeee! My feet hit the ground.

00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:52.400
I took off for the station.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.500
But right on my heels was
that hungry Dalmatian.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:59.100
I'll run and I'll
dodge, as fast as I can.

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:00.640
I'm not a dog bone!

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:03.820
I'm the gingerbread man!

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:07.890
Very good The class
didn't notice.

00:08:07.890 --> 00:08:10.760
They tried on black
boots and helmets,

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.730
and air tanks, and
big heavy suits.

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:16.550
Do you see the gingerbread
man there writing?

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.080
And who is behind him?

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.730
Spot the Dalmatian!

00:08:20.730 --> 00:08:23.030
Oh, my goodness!

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:28.000
I dashed to the fire
truck, jumped in a seat.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.480
Whew! I was almost a
sweet doggy treat!.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:37.800
Wow! He got away I hopped on the
steering will, gave it a spin --

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:40.060
and yelled out, "Honk Honk!"

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.100
with a big cookie grin.

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:46.860
The wheel spun past gauges
and switches and knobs --

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:51.090
all kinds of buttons
that do different jobs.

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:53.240
I'll vroom and I'll
zoom, as fast as I can.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.750
I'll steer this big truck,
I'm the gingerbread man!

00:08:58.750 --> 00:09:01.310
That is where I am going
to pause for just a minute.

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.300
We are going to break the
book up into two sections

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.140
and we will do two songs
and then finish the book!

00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:09.240
All right!

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:11.710
Okay! All right!

00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:15.730
So we need to make
a gingerbread man!

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:24.830
So we are going to go bake,
bake, bake a gingerbread --

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:33.670
add sugar and spice,
and everything nice.

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.600
Look! We made our friend.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:40.700
Okay. One more time.

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:42.890
It is going to be row your boat.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:47.280
La, la, la, la, la, la, la,
la, bake, bake, bake all day,

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:52.450
bake a gingerbread, add spice
and everything nice, look!

00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:54.110
We made a friend.

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.640
One more time.

00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.730
Bake, bake, bake all
day, make a gingerbread.

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:03.730
Add sugar and spice and
everything nice, look!

00:10:03.730 --> 00:10:06.180
We made a friend!

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:08.600
Yeah! Good job!

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.230
(Applause) All right.

00:10:10.230 --> 00:10:15.530
Now a classic about a little
boy having an adventure.

00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:18.520
We are going to make a
candle with one finger

00:10:18.520 --> 00:10:22.840
and then the other is going to
be Jack and he is going to go

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.230
up to the candle and he
is going to jump over it.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:31.050
Okay? Jack be nimble,
Jack be quick,

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.640
Jack jump over the candlestick!

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.940
All right.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:37.240
Go the other way.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:43.390
Jack be nimble, Jack be quick,
Jack jump over the candlestick!

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:49.200
Good job! (Applause) Now
the other half of our story.

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:53.360
Okay. Now let's see what happens
with the gingerbread man.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.290
Does he get away from Spot?

00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:57.020
How does he help?

00:10:57.020 --> 00:11:02.630
Okay? Then I heard
someone whistle.

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.200
Spot trotted away.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:07.050
So I jumped through the
window without a delay.

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:10.630
I landed on a top of a
big several silver bowl.

00:11:10.630 --> 00:11:15.070
Oh, no! I cried out
as I leapt for a pole.

00:11:15.070 --> 00:11:19.870
I shimmied right up and I sprang
from the top and then jumped

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:23.370
on a bed with a big belly flop.

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:25.580
Who does belly flops
on their bed?

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:31.830
Anybody? (Laughter) There
were several more bunks

00:11:31.830 --> 00:11:35.010
with their covers pulled
tight for each firefighter

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:36.960
who stayed through the night.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.650
I bounced on each bed on my way
to the door, then into a room

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.170
with a bright checkered floor.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:46.550
Where is he going?

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:50.800
I peeked around the corner
and smelled something yummy --

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:54.980
a grumbling sound
rumbled up from my tummy.

00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:58.360
I spotted a fireman
filling up bowls

00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.360
with five-alarm chili
and buttery rolls.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:05.390
There he is, down Then all of
a sudden I heard a loud noise.

00:12:05.390 --> 00:12:06.690
there Woooo!

00:12:06.690 --> 00:12:12.540
Fire! One shouted, "No
lunch for us, boys."

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.390
They rushed to the bunk
room and slid down the pole.

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:21.030
I followed behind them
then peered down the hole.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.560
Spot wasn't there -- a
sure sign of good luck.

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.080
So I slipped down the pole
and then jumped on the truck.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:33.750
I'll ride to the
rescue, as fast as I can.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:42.160
I want to help, too!

00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:43.600
I'm the gingerbread man!

00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:45.410
Weeeee! Can you do that?

00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:49.150
Weeeee! went the sirens
the lights flashed around.

00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:55.270
As I zoomed past my
classmates below on the ground.

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.720
We sped through the streets
and I clung to the back.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.870
near ladders and hoses
piled up in a stack.

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:06.920
There he is The engine pulled
up, firefighters jumped out.

00:13:06.920 --> 00:13:11.300
They rushed to the hydrant
and opened the spout.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:16.080
I spied a large house
with a shed near the back.

00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:20.790
Smoke rose from its
window, all sooty and black.

00:13:20.790 --> 00:13:24.870
I'll put out that
fire, as fast as I can.

00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:26.420
I know I can help!

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:29.100
I'm the gingerbread man!

00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.710
I grabbed the hose
nozzle and gave it a pull.

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:36.760
But that hose whipped and
bumped like a rodeo bull!.

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.020
Because he is so small, is NT?

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.860
The water wooshed out and
it doused the old shed.

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:47.330
And the powerful spray
shot the hat off my head.

00:13:47.330 --> 00:13:49.520
He lost his hat!

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:53.890
The chief ran up quickly
and dove on the hose.

00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:59.610
She crawled her way up
until we came nose to nose.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.580
"Looked everyone!

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.760
It's a gingerbread man!

00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:08.170
Now where did you come from,"
Said the Fire Chief Anne.

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:13.790
"I came with the children
to visit the station.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:18.060
But I almost got eaten
by Spot, the Dalmatian.

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:21.050
I had to escape from that
hungry crumb-snatcher,

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:25.020
so I jumped on the truck
when I heard your dispatcher.

00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:28.890
" "Good thinking, smart cookie!

00:14:28.890 --> 00:14:30.800
We're glad you hopped on.

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.530
You wrestled that hose
till the fire was gone.

00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:36.530
" Did he help put out the fire?

00:14:36.530 --> 00:14:39.590
Yes, he did We packed
up the truck

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:41.330
and drove back to the station.

00:14:41.330 --> 00:14:45.260
Can you drive back
to the station?

00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:48.600
We pulled in the drive
to a standing ovation.

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.900
Can you clap?

00:14:49.900 --> 00:14:54.710
(Applause) That is
what innovation means.

00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:58.100
Your gingerbread guy
was a brave little man!

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.740
"He doused every flame,"

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.290
announced Fire Chief Anne
The children applauded

00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:06.880
and shouted, "Yeah!

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:12.860
" They held me up high,
yelling, "You saved the day!

00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:15.810
" And in the firefighter
said you are really a hero.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.150
You're part of our crew.

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.630
But you're missing
your hat so we have one

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:25.970

helmet from Company 4!

There are more for
your classmates stacked

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:36.620
up by the door I tried on my
helmet and shouted "Woohoo!

00:15:36.620 --> 00:15:44.790
I'm a gingerbread man
and a fireman too!

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:48.600
" And that is the end.

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.200
(Applause) You guys did a great
job finding all of the man's

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.720
Yes. This one is about
five gingerbread men.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.950
