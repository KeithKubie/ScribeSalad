00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.830
GINGER STRAND: OK.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.210
So I think I'm
introducing myself today,

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.700
which is really kind of fun.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.980
And I was trying to think
up some sort of Vonnegutian

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:12.960
introduction, like Ginger Strand
is the winner of the National

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.030
Book Award in the future.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.090
[LAUGHS] But I'll
just be more straight.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.600
I'm the author of four books.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.190
The most recent one I'm
here to talk to you about,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.330
"The Brothers Vonnegut,
Science and Fiction

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.540
in the House of Magic."

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.540
My previous two books are
also narrative nonfiction.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.400
One is about interstate
highways and serial killers,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.290
and the one before that
is the untold history

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.200
of Niagara Falls.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.100
And an interesting thing, if
you're purchasing the book

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.940
today, is that the first
printing of this edition

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.940
screwed up the subtitles
of the last two books.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.430
So there's a sort
of printing error

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.100
that maybe one day after I've
won the National Book Award

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.720
will be super, super valuable.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.240
But, yeah, my last book was
not Killer on the Road, Beauty,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.480
Power, and Lies.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.710
But that could be
kind of a fun title.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.090
What I'm going to
do today is talk

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.170
through basically the first
half of the book "The Brothers

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:19.450
Vonnegut."

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.900
I think it's more
fun just to talk,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.140
as opposed to
hearing writers read.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.520
And given that I'm
talking at Google,

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:33.240
I actually added to
the normal book talk

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.950
that I usually do
about this book.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.680
I put in some of the stuff about
the dawn of the digital age

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.644
that I have taken out
in previous versions.

00:01:41.644 --> 00:01:43.060
Because I was
thinking there might

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.030
be some fans of early
computers and things

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.840
like that in the audience.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.350
So I just took that opportunity.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.960
Because I kind of
geeked out myself

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.870
when I was writing the
book on that topic.

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.370
So I have this
nifty little thing.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.410
And my first slide is a
picture of the Catskills.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.770
And the reason is
because people always

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.199
want to know when you give
a book talk, why did you

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.919
write this book?

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.270
Like how did you
come to this story?

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.450
And most people assume
that since I wrote a book

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.190
about Kurt Vonnegut and
his older brother Bernard,

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.610
that I was a big Vonnegut fan.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.800
And actually, I really liked
a couple of Vonnegut novels,

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.060
but I had not read
everything when

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.630
I started working on this book.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.750
I came to this
book because I was

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.570
reading a history of New York
City's hydro infrastructure.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.820
I'm a huge fan of
hydro infrastructure,

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:37.560
and I hope some of you are too.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.480
I think it's a glorious thing.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.430
And New York City's
hydro infrastructure

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.890
is especially exciting.

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:48.400
And so I was reading
about this obscure episode

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.330
that nobody seems to
know about in 1950,

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.070
where New York City
had not yet completed

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.540
the last of its reservoirs
up in the Catskills.

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.360
They had been halted first
by lawsuits from New Jersey

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.160
and Pennsylvania who were upset
at us for taking their water.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.010
And then there was the
war, the Second World War.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.970
And so in 1949, there
was a big drought.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.890
By 1950, New York City
was running out of water.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.940
And the "New York Times"
was actually publishing

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.410
on the front page a
little thing every day

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.620
that said, days until
water pressure runs out.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.650
Like the water was going to
stop coming out of the taps.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.740
And they had-- it was
really fascinating.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.440
There were like shaveless
Fridays, and Thirsty Thursdays,

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.480
where you were supposed
to avoid drinking water.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.420
The mayor stopped
shaving and grew a beard.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.420
Volunteers were going door to
door, banging on the door like,

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.899
can we look at your plumbing
to see if you have leaks?

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:43.940
People were putting little
plastic swimming pools

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.130
on their roofs to collect water.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:47.366
So it was really serious.

00:03:47.366 --> 00:03:48.990
The city was going
to run out of water.

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.570
And so they decided to cloud
seed the Catskill Mountains

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:55.580
and make rain for
the reservoirs.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.830
So they started cloud seeding
the Catskill Mountains

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.300
in early 1950.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.180
They cloud seeded all
through the summer.

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.190
It rained all summer long.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.830
The people in the Catskills
were really annoyed.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.590
They're always annoyed at us,
but they were really annoyed

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.660
this time.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.310
And then they continued
seeding, the city

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.029
continued seeding in the fall.

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.970
And in Thanksgiving, 1950, there
was a huge storm system that

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.350
went through to the Northeast.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.890
And the floods in the
Catskills were devastating.

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.470
So New York City was slapped
with a couple million dollars

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.720
worth of lawsuits,
and the enthusiasm

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.490
for municipal rainmaking
kind of evaporated.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.670
And I just was like fascinated
by that whole episode.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:40.390
And then I found out that the
person who invented the method

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.270
and actually advised New
York City on this program

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:46.490
was Bernard Vonnegut, the
older brother of Kurt Vonnegut.

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.970
And knowing what I knew
about Kurt Vonnegut,

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.560
you know, that he nearly died
in a slaughterhouse basement

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.490
in the firebombing
of Dresden, I was

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.180
struck by this
beautiful juxtaposition

00:04:56.180 --> 00:05:00.310
of one brother trying to
bring down rain from the sky,

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.720
and the other brother hiding
in a slaughterhouse basement

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.850
while fire is
raining down on him.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.100
And I just thought, that
would be a really nice essay.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.780
And hence, I wrote a book.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.850
Because the more I looked into
it, the better the story got.

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.290
There were all these other
cool juxtapositions too.

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.320
Bernard was eight
years older than Kurt,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.814
and they were kind
of like opposites.

00:05:22.814 --> 00:05:24.480
They were at the two
ends of the family.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:26.270
They had a sister in between.

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:30.170
And Bernard was this brilliant
science guy who went to MIT

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.830
and got a Ph.D. In chemistry.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.260
He was the big
family success story.

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:36.820
He was the one everyone
expected to do something great.

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:39.310
The A student, the hard worker.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.410
Kurt was kind of like the class
clown, the family screw up.

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:47.240
He had gone to Cornell,
majored in biochemistry,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.490
because that's what his
brother told him he should do.

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.851
And he'd kind of flunked out.

00:05:51.851 --> 00:05:53.350
And then joined the
Army, and that's

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.980
how he ended up in Dresden.

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.370
So I really liked this
the sibling rivalry

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.790
that they had, and
this kind of opposition

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.990
that they had between
the two of them.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.440
And then I kept discovering
all these groovy, I don't know,

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:12.250
coincidences in a way.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.190
So one thing that I discovered,
and I would say this

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:16.630
was the point at
which I realized

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.110
that I was writing a book,
was that on February 14, 1945,

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.940
Bernard Vonnegut was in
Minneapolis at a place called

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.900
the Ice Research Base, which,
just the idea that there

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:33.780
was an ice research base is
pretty excellent in my opinion.

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.660
But Bernard had been recruited.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.790
He was doing secret war work for
the chemical warfare service.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:44.090
And his research at the time
was studying aircraft deicing.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:47.100
And of course, icing has
been a problem for aviation

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.860
since airplanes first
got up in the air.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.810
And it continues to
be a problem, right?

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:53.530
The icing on the
pitot tube is what

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.880
brought down that Air France
airliner a few years back.

00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.980
The military was
trying to figure out

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:02.050
how to deice their
bomber planes,

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:05.300
because they were flying over
Europe and getting iced over,

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.300
and it really was
screwing things up.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.910
So Bernard was actually
in a bomber in Minneapolis

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:15.060
studying ways of
mitigating the ice

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.060
in order to keep
the bomber planes

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.440
in the air on the very day that
Kurt, of course, February 14,

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:27.260
1945, was in the slaughterhouse
basement in Dresden.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:29.240
When he came up two
days later, this

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.610
is what Dresden looked like.

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:37.380
This, I think, was just-- that
was too compelling for me.

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.550
I had to follow up.

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.470
The reason that I knew that
Bernard was in Minneapolis

00:07:45.470 --> 00:07:49.320
the day that the firebombing
of Dresden occurred

00:07:49.320 --> 00:07:53.520
was because he wrote a letter
that day on hotel stationary

00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.450
from the King Cole Hotel.

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:00.870
And he sent it to GE
labs in Schenectady.

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.990
Basically, he was
accepting a job offer.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:06.130
As part of his
deicing research, he'd

00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:09.600
started to work with some
GE scientists who were also

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:15.970
studying icing-- Irving Langmuir
and Vincent Schaefer at GE.

00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:18.970
So as soon as the bombs
were dropped on Hiroshima

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:25.310
and Nagasaki, Bernard finished
up his military reports,

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:27.540
filed them, and became
a civilian again,

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:30.230
went to Schenectady to
work at General Electric.

00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:32.070
This is General Electric today.

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.190
It's still there.

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.950
Downtown Schenectady,
the big GE monogram

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:41.409
glowing over Erie Boulevard.

00:08:41.409 --> 00:08:44.010
I just kind of threw that in
'cause I like this picture,

00:08:44.010 --> 00:08:45.940
and I do spend a
lot of time when

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.350
I'm researching a book
just randomly driving

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:50.020
around and taking photographs.

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.010
So I try to use them
because it makes

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:57.720
me feel like it was
a useful thing to do.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.200
So those of you who haven't
heard of the GE Labs,

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.880
you've probably
heard of Bell Labs.

00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.480
Bell Labs was one of these
pioneering industrial research

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.310
laboratories.

00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:13.130
GE Labs, the GE Research Lab
was their first, in fact.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.290
They were an
incredible organization

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:20.910
begun in the early 20th century
by Charles Proteus Steinmetz.

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:24.970
And the GE Lab
was kind of unique

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.260
among industrial
research laboratories

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.340
in that the scientists were
allowed to pursue research

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:33.520
that just interested them.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.080
They were expected to
spend some time working

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:38.860
on making GE's light bulbs
better and stuff like that.

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.870
But they also were allowed to
just follow their passions.

00:09:41.870 --> 00:09:44.390
They had something sort
of Google-y, right?

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.870
The were kind of like
20% time or something.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:50.530
They were given the freedom to
pursue their own researches.

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:54.510
And those things often did
lead to new inventions for GE.

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:59.320
This is the hallway in the GE
Research Lab in about 1950.

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:02.240
The character, the
first guy on the left

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:03.520
there is Vincent Schaefer.

00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:06.450
And the next guy down, kind
of impishly peeking out

00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:09.270
of his office, is
Bernard Vonnegut.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:11.660
Bernard had a personality
quite similar to Kurt.

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.320
He looks like his
brother, but he also

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:17.010
was kind of a-- he had
a great sense of humor

00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:21.040
and a sense of
fun and jokes that

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:24.090
was fun to see, even in his
lab notebooks and things,

00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:26.070
as I was researching the book.

00:10:26.070 --> 00:10:28.640
So Bernard goes
off-- after the war,

00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.980
Bernard goes off to work
at the GE Research Lab.

00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:32.940
So it's still
looking like they're

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.300
going to follow these
trajectories that they're

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.280
in from the start.

00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.250
The older brother
who's the A student

00:10:39.250 --> 00:10:42.000
and the brilliant scientist, and
the younger brother who's kind

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.330
of flailing around.

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.490
Kurt came back from Dresden,
from his time as a POW,

00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.360
and he really didn't know what
he wanted to do with himself.

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.310
All he knew for sure
was that he wanted

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:57.580
to marry Jane Cox, his childhood
sweetheart pretty much.

00:10:57.580 --> 00:11:01.200
And so they quickly got married
when he got back from the war.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:05.260
This is shortly before their
marriage, this photograph,

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.830
I think, but it's kind
of a great picture.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:10.160
And then there's
this great series

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:12.560
of letters, because Kurt
was still in the Army

00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.250
and right after their
wedding was sent out

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:17.280
to Fort Riley in Kansas.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:21.070
And he and Jane
wrote back and forth

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.660
hundreds of letters
that are still

00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:24.510
in the family's possession.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:28.050
And they kind of show this
really interesting process

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:31.220
by which Jane convinced
Kurt to become a writer.

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:33.440
Kurt kept saying, you
know, I don't know.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.350
I like writing, but really
I should have an office job.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:38.190
Maybe I should go to law school.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.650
Maybe I should study
something else.

00:11:40.650 --> 00:11:43.010
I could probably be
good in human relations.

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:47.370
Why don't I become a
labor relations guy?

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.820
Why don't we open
a-- I like this idea.

00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:56.090
For a while, he was into,
let's open a library slash bar.

00:11:56.090 --> 00:12:00.120
He thought that would be really
cool, which it probably would.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:03.712
And Jane just kept saying, no,
you're a really good writer.

00:12:03.712 --> 00:12:04.420
You should write.

00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:07.210
And you should make it your
goal to write for a living.

00:12:07.210 --> 00:12:09.147
And he would be
like, don't say that.

00:12:09.147 --> 00:12:10.730
That's really scary
when you say that,

00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.590
because I could never do that.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.170
And she slowly but
surely convinced

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:17.749
him to start taking himself
seriously as a writer.

00:12:17.749 --> 00:12:19.290
So one of the things
he started doing

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:22.050
while he was at Fort
Riley in Kansas-- oh,

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:25.040
this is one of the letters.

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.050
The letters are so charming.

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.270
And he would draw these
little drawings on them.

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.690
Another thing funny thing
is that he was constantly

00:12:33.690 --> 00:12:37.380
talking about how they
would have seven kids.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.577
And he knew from the
time that they were 15

00:12:41.577 --> 00:12:43.910
that they were going to get
married and have seven kids.

00:12:43.910 --> 00:12:47.840
And if you know Kurt
Vonnegut's biography,

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:52.140
they did end up having seven
kids after they, Kurt and Jane,

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:56.610
had three, and his sister died
and they adopted her four.

00:12:56.610 --> 00:13:00.050
So that's just kind of spooky,
like he really kind of was

00:13:00.050 --> 00:13:02.050
time traveling at some point.

00:13:02.050 --> 00:13:04.710
This letter was published in
the "New Yorker Page-Turner,"

00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:05.760
an article I wrote.

00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:08.610
So you can, if you are
interested in reading

00:13:08.610 --> 00:13:11.355
it or having it, it's
on that newyorker.com.

00:13:14.770 --> 00:13:17.040
Kurt started writing
short stories

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.080
while he was at Fort Riley
and sending them to Jane.

00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.030
Jane would edit them and
retype them up and mail them

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:27.170
to editors at magazines.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.190
And I just like this.

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:29.890
It's just a fun little detail.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.310
He didn't have paper,
so he would type them

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:34.790
on the back of the
weather reports that

00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:36.560
would roll off the teletype.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:39.070
The story that's typed on the
back of this weather report

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:41.030
is called "Atrocity Story."

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:47.370
And it's about a guy who
steals a jar of string beans

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:52.370
while a POW in Dresden
and gets executed for it.

00:13:52.370 --> 00:13:54.149
So if you've read
"Slaughterhouse-Five,"

00:13:54.149 --> 00:13:55.940
you know that that's
kind of the dark heart

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:58.810
of "Slaughterhouse-Five,"
the execution of Edgar Derby

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:00.300
for stealing.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:03.900
Kurt eventually makes
it a Dresden teapot,

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.650
which is even more absurd.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.660
But this was based on
a real incident that

00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.900
had happened to him as a POW.

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:14.210
He was forced to be one of the
people attending this execution

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:16.060
and bury the guy afterwards.

00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:23.120
And he wrote this probably
almost 10 times in 10 different

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:28.350
ways before it became part
of "Slaughterhouse-Five."

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:35.100
So Kurt finishes, gets sent
home-- released from the Army,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:37.830
and decides to go to
University of Chicago

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:39.400
and study anthropology.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.265
Still kind of not
sure what he-- he's

00:14:41.265 --> 00:14:44.480
still convincing, telling Jane
he's got to have a day job.

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.420
He's got to have some kind of
day job, because seven kids,

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.310
it's a lot to support.

00:14:50.310 --> 00:14:55.140
Meanwhile, Bernard gets involved
in something very interesting

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.190
at the GE Lab.

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.560
Vincent Schaefer
and Irving Langmuir.

00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.275
Irving Langmuir is perhaps
the most famous scientist

00:15:03.275 --> 00:15:05.650
you may never have-- has anyone
heard of Irving Langmuir?

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.530
This would be an audience
where people have?

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:10.150
But yeah, not so many.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:14.280
He's a Nobel laureate chemist
who worked for GE Labs.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.970
And he was a household
name at this time.

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.400
He and his assistant,
Vincent Schaefer,

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.360
had decided they'd become
very interested in icing,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.910
and specifically in cloud
behavior during the war.

00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:30.060
And after the war
they decided, you

00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.340
know, why don't we see
if we can figure out

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:35.130
why it is that super-cooled
clouds, clouds that

00:15:35.130 --> 00:15:38.790
are cooled below the
temperature of freezing,

00:15:38.790 --> 00:15:40.630
hang onto their moisture.

00:15:40.630 --> 00:15:42.220
Often the water stays liquid.

00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:46.160
It doesn't crystallize
and fall as snow.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.020
So maybe we could figure
out why that happens

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.440
and see if we can affect it.

00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:53.770
So they were experimentalists.

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:57.610
They decided, well, let's
just try some stuff.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:15:59.690
So they got in a
freezer, which was

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.610
easy to get because
they worked at GE.

00:16:01.610 --> 00:16:04.416
And they lined it
with black velvet

00:16:04.416 --> 00:16:06.290
and they put a light on
it, and they breathed

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:08.260
into it which made a cloud.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.920
And then they just
started spraying stuff

00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:13.010
on this cloud to
see if any of it

00:16:13.010 --> 00:16:15.030
would cause the
cloud to nucleate.

00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:19.160
They had this theory that
the reason super-cooled

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:22.230
clouds produce rain eventually
is because something

00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:24.240
is introduced into
the cloud that

00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:27.850
provides a nucleus for
each little water droplet.

00:16:27.850 --> 00:16:30.790
Water droplets cling to this
and that makes them heavy enough

00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:32.120
to fall as rain.

00:16:32.120 --> 00:16:34.780
It was kind of, I
don't know, it was just

00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:39.010
kind of an intuitive sense
that they had watching clouds.

00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.504
So they start trying stuff.

00:16:40.504 --> 00:16:42.420
And they're spraying
things, different things,

00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.960
different chemicals
on the cloud.

00:16:43.960 --> 00:16:46.700
And it's going on and on
for a couple of months.

00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:50.530
And then one day in July,
it's really, really hot

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:52.090
in the GE offices.

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:54.600
And Vincent's having
a hard time keeping

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:57.260
the freezer cold enough,
so he throws some dry ice

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.170
into the freezer.

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:00.770
And immediately,
the cloud turns into

00:17:00.770 --> 00:17:02.320
a little miniature snowstorm.

00:17:02.320 --> 00:17:04.260
It's all these
little snowflakes.

00:17:04.260 --> 00:17:08.250
And he goes, wow,
dry ice did it.

00:17:08.250 --> 00:17:10.780
And you can repeat this
experiment at home.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:12.819
I did it while I was
working on the book

00:17:12.819 --> 00:17:15.250
when someone sent me some
steaks, those steaks that

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.589
come with dry ice.

00:17:16.589 --> 00:17:20.460
I was like, oh, going to
make some snow in my freezer.

00:17:20.460 --> 00:17:24.630
And then it actually worked,
which was pretty neat.

00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:27.640
So Bernard got involved.

00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.710
They brought Bernard in.

00:17:28.710 --> 00:17:30.980
And Bernard very
quickly discovered

00:17:30.980 --> 00:17:35.110
that-- he went through the
crystallography handbook

00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:37.050
and looked at all the
crystalline structures

00:17:37.050 --> 00:17:39.470
of different chemicals,
and found the one that

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:41.000
was closest to water.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.780
And that was silver iodide.

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:45.770
So he tried that on the little
cloud in the little freezer

00:17:45.770 --> 00:17:47.090
and that did the same thing.

00:17:47.090 --> 00:17:51.150
That actually caused the
cloud to precipitate.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:52.940
So then they were
really excited.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:58.140
They could not wait to go try
this in the actual atmosphere.

00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:02.240
And they went out
in November of 1946

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.520
and they sprayed some
clouds with dry ice.

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.740
And sure enough,
it carved-- this

00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:12.470
is a pattern of the
airplane carved in the cloud

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:15.210
by dropping dry ice.

00:18:15.210 --> 00:18:20.270
So GE issues a press
release-- GE scientists have

00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:23.640
learned to make snow and rain.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:27.570
And basically, the
world reacts like this.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.000
World weather control.

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:33.880
We're on the brink of
world weather control.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.470
We've got it.

00:18:34.470 --> 00:18:35.160
We've solved it.

00:18:35.160 --> 00:18:37.370
We're finally doing
something about the weather.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:40.140
And I mean, literally,
every newspaper--

00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:43.219
the Boston Globe had like a
two-inch headline-- Snowstorm

00:18:43.219 --> 00:18:43.760
Manufactured.

00:18:46.970 --> 00:18:52.810
And it kind of seems silly
now, but looking back at it,

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:56.040
the scientists had just
harnessed the most fundamental

00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.440
force in the universe, right?

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.869
They had just figured out
how to make an atomic bomb.

00:18:59.869 --> 00:19:01.910
Nobody even knew that that
research was going on,

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.350
and then suddenly they did it.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:07.310
So it just seemed
like yeah, science

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:10.290
is going to just go wild now.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:14.970
So GE was inundated,
not only with clippings,

00:19:14.970 --> 00:19:16.630
but with letters.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:18.700
And the letters still
exist in the GE archive.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.580
And they're hilarious,
because everybody wrote to GE,

00:19:21.580 --> 00:19:25.860
and they were like, so
we're doing a film shoot

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.170
a Buffalo on December 6, and we
really would like it to snow,

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:31.400
because that's important.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.950
Or we have a ski
slope in Vermont,

00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:38.100
and we would really encourage
you to come here and practice

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:39.480
your experiments.

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:42.050
The nation of Chile
wrote and were like,

00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:43.590
could you fix our deserts?

00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:45.210
Could you guys send
some scientists

00:19:45.210 --> 00:19:47.280
down here to fix our deserts?

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:49.260
And there were even
more interests--

00:19:49.260 --> 00:19:51.610
there were moments where
there would be forest fires

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:53.190
and people would call GE.

00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.339
Quick, we've got some
dry ice and an airplane,

00:19:56.339 --> 00:19:57.380
and we're going to go up.

00:19:57.380 --> 00:19:59.130
Tell us how to seed the clouds.

00:19:59.130 --> 00:20:03.350
And the scientists would
try to talk them through it.

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:08.020
There was a plane crash on
Mount Rainier, a military plane.

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:10.010
And the military
called GE and said,

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:12.670
we want to clear the
clouds away so we can find

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:14.030
this airplane that crashed.

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:19.140
And the GE scientists
tried to give them advice.

00:20:19.140 --> 00:20:21.250
So it was tremendous.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.900
Bernard, at this
point, is famous.

00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:25.140
He's appearing in
advertisements.

00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.350
His career is in overdrive.

00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:31.780
He's collecting patents for
various tools to do this.

00:20:31.780 --> 00:20:37.080
And they're preparing to
completely manage the climate.

00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:43.430
Around about this time, Kurt
Vonnegut's first son is born.

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.690
He's still a student at
the University of Chicago,

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:48.150
but the first of the
seven kids is here.

00:20:48.150 --> 00:20:53.020
He's got anxiety about
supporting his family.

00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.680
It was always really,
really important

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.610
to Kurt to support his family.

00:20:56.610 --> 00:20:59.430
So he starts looking for a job .

00:20:59.430 --> 00:21:03.490
And lo and behold, somebody
from she GE him and says,

00:21:03.490 --> 00:21:06.310
your brother said that you
would be really a good person

00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:08.260
in our publicity department.

00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.200
Maybe you could
come work for us.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.440
And the job was really good.

00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:16.050
It was like too good
an offer to pass up.

00:21:16.050 --> 00:21:19.530
Because Kurt Vonnegut always
wanted to be a newspaper man.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.740
He had worked at his college
newspaper, his high school

00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:23.570
newspaper.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.490
While he was at the
University of Chicago,

00:21:25.490 --> 00:21:27.060
he worked in the
city news bureau.

00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.240
He was really comfortable
in a newsroom.

00:21:30.240 --> 00:21:33.210
But a real newsroom is
not really a great job.

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.530
Being a real reporter is not
a great job for a family man.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.490
This was kind of
like a happy medium,

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:42.600
because the GE News Bureau
was organized like a newsroom

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.900
except, of course,
they weren't objective.

00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:48.100
But they had reporters.

00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:50.110
They had beat
reporters whose-- you

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:52.910
beat would be like
lighting and refrigeration.

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:57.060
And you would go out and find
stories and report on them.

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.590
And you would write
up the stories

00:21:58.590 --> 00:22:00.480
with pictures and
quotes and everything,

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.530
and then put them in an
envelope and send them

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:04.130
to editors all over the nation.

00:22:04.130 --> 00:22:07.280
And newspaper and magazine
editors appreciated this.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:08.980
It was free content.

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:12.430
And so GE was really
successful at this.

00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:15.710
They are the nation's
biggest corporate publisher.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:17.160
They were at the time.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:20.640
And they were also
incredibly successful

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.400
in placing news stories.

00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.100
So Kurt had a
science background.

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:27.710
He had a newsroom background.

00:22:27.710 --> 00:22:30.620
And he had a need for a
safe, comfortable job.

00:22:30.620 --> 00:22:33.200
So he took the job at
GE and he came to work.

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:35.240
He bought the house next
door to his brother's

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.426
and moved to Schenectady
with his wife and son.

00:22:38.426 --> 00:22:39.800
The first thing
they did was they

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.430
went appliance shopping, because
he got an employee discount

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:45.190
at GE.

00:22:45.190 --> 00:22:48.280
He writes his dad, he's
like, yeah, we got a fridge

00:22:48.280 --> 00:22:49.820
and we got a washing machine.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:52.030
And it's really cute.

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:55.170
So he starts being
a good company man,

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.070
going to work every day.

00:22:57.070 --> 00:23:01.320
Wearing a three piece
suit and a fedora.

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:03.730
This is the GE newsroom.

00:23:03.730 --> 00:23:06.180
Kurt's not in this
picture, but Bernard

00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.090
is, because of course, those
are press photographs pinned up

00:23:10.090 --> 00:23:11.340
to the wall back there.

00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:16.150
And about half of them are
about Bernard's project.

00:23:16.150 --> 00:23:20.950
It was GE'S biggest PR success.

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:23.920
This is Kurt at the time.

00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.590
This is Kurt Vonnegut
at the time of this job,

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.620
in front of his house.

00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:32.110
And it's not the Kurt
Vonnegut that we think

00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:33.360
of when we think the Vonnegut.

00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.380
We think of this kind of
rumpled, ironic, sarcastic,

00:23:36.380 --> 00:23:37.690
chain smoking guy.

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:39.340
The chain smoking, yes.

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.687
He was definitely
already chain smoking.

00:23:41.687 --> 00:23:43.770
But he was really trying
to be a good company man.

00:23:43.770 --> 00:23:46.810
He was trying to tow
the corporate line,

00:23:46.810 --> 00:23:49.160
to show the right
level of team spirit,

00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:53.260
and not actually talk about
the fact that secretly,

00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:57.130
at night and on weekends, he
was still writing short stories.

00:23:57.130 --> 00:24:01.220
All he was getting was a
series of rejections, one

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:01.920
after the other.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.790
He was writing story
after story that he

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:05.810
thought would appeal
to the slick magazines.

00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:07.992
He and Jane would
study the magazines,

00:24:07.992 --> 00:24:09.700
try to figure out what
the editors liked.

00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:12.900
He produced stories, and the
editors just rejected them.

00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:14.550
This went on for years.

00:24:14.550 --> 00:24:17.690
And the Lilly Library
that has Kurt's papers

00:24:17.690 --> 00:24:22.590
has a file called "rejection
letters," which for a writer

00:24:22.590 --> 00:24:24.850
is just so affirming
to go through.

00:24:24.850 --> 00:24:27.990
Because it's one rejection
after the other after the other.

00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:29.290
It goes on and on and on.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:31.664
And every now and then, there'd
be like a good rejection.

00:24:31.664 --> 00:24:35.900
Like well, we kind of
liked this, but no.

00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:38.670
And from all the big magazines.

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:41.460
I didn't have the foresight
when I was at the Lilly Library

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:43.980
to photograph the rejections.

00:24:43.980 --> 00:24:45.570
So these are actually
my rejections

00:24:45.570 --> 00:24:47.980
that I put in the slide show.

00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.950
And I'm very proud
to say that they're

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:52.514
from some of the same
prestigious magazines

00:24:52.514 --> 00:24:53.680
that rejected Kurt Vonnegut.

00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:01.450
Meanwhile, Bernie-- and this
is kind of how the book works.

00:25:01.450 --> 00:25:04.730
It goes back and forth with
these two narratives that

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:07.010
are kind of apart and
then they come together

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:08.810
at a certain point.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:13.880
Bernie's project takes
an interesting turn,

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:16.580
because GE is thinking,
this is really

00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:18.340
kind of not a great thing.

00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:21.630
Our scientists are out there
making it snow, or rain,

00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:23.310
or God knows what.

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:25.900
We could actually get sued.

00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.350
And the lawyers were just
totally beside themselves.

00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.620
They were apoplectic
about all of this.

00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:36.130
So GE decides, let's
bring in the government.

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:38.520
And in fact, the arm
of the government

00:25:38.520 --> 00:25:40.530
that's most interested
in weather control

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:42.510
is the military.

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.370
The GE scientists
are thinking, hey,

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:46.346
we're going to make
it rain in the desert.

00:25:46.346 --> 00:25:47.720
If we can control
the weather, we

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.100
can stop hurricanes
from hitting the shore.

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:53.300
We can stop hail storms
that damage crops.

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:54.910
We can do all kinds
of great stuff.

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:56.310
The admirals and
the generals are

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:58.440
thinking, if we can
control the weather,

00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:01.190
we could really
screw with Russia.

00:26:01.190 --> 00:26:02.860
So here they are.

00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:05.270
And I love the expression
on these guys' faces

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:06.870
as they're looking
into this fridge.

00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:08.570
They came for the
little demonstration.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.290
And Bernard in the
background there

00:26:10.290 --> 00:26:14.160
is using a child's toy, a pop
gun, to precipitate the cloud.

00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:17.280
Because he'd figured out
that that works as well.

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:18.900
And this is a
press photo that GE

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.300
took to announce that they
were handing this program

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:23.640
over to the military.

00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.230
That their scientists were
no longer actually conducting

00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.850
experiments.

00:26:26.850 --> 00:26:29.070
That all of the experiments
were being conducted

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:36.710
by the military, specifically,
the Army Signal Engineer Corps.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:41.390
And it would be done on military
planes with military pilots.

00:26:41.390 --> 00:26:44.680
And so GE was sort of
insulated from lawsuits

00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:49.480
by this wall of military brass,
which made them very happy.

00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.430
It was kind of a win
for Project Cirrus,

00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:55.470
as they gave the name, because
you can't have a weather

00:26:55.470 --> 00:27:00.590
control project without
a kind of sci-fi name--

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:02.620
super-secret sci-fi name.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:05.380
So they gave it the
name Project Cirrus,

00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:07.370
and they got military
planes and pilots.

00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:11.430
And here they are loading a
B17 bomber plane with dry ice

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.440
to go on a seeding run.

00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:18.960
Here's Vincent Schaefer
installing into the B17

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.370
a cloud droplet
meter that Bernie

00:27:21.370 --> 00:27:25.780
had invented to measure
the number of droplets

00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.010
in the clouds as they're
flying through them.

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:31.180
And here's Bernie--
I love this picture.

00:27:31.180 --> 00:27:35.270
Sort of Bernard Vonnegut
as Doctor Strangelove

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:37.960
meets Flash Gordon--
on the plane,

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.850
getting ready to go up there
and bombard some clouds.

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:42.890
Because of course,
the GE scientists

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:45.440
were totally out there
doing the experiments,

00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.830
but officially, they
were just consultants.

00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:51.340
So the first thing
that they-- and this

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:52.790
must have been
weird for Bernard,

00:27:52.790 --> 00:27:55.350
too, because now he's
on the same planes that

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:58.260
were raining down
death on his brother,

00:27:58.260 --> 00:28:01.420
trying to accomplish
something, he hopes,

00:28:01.420 --> 00:28:03.359
for the good of humanity.

00:28:03.359 --> 00:28:04.900
The first thing they
decide to do now

00:28:04.900 --> 00:28:08.570
that they have all this
new military hardware

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.460
is something they'd
been hoping they

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:15.770
could do from the start, which
is cloud seed a hurricane.

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:18.990
The idea was if you
could attack a hurricane,

00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.750
you could maybe steer it.

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:24.520
A hurricane contains more energy
than a thermonuclear bomb.

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:26.410
So you're not going
to ever control it.

00:28:26.410 --> 00:28:28.820
But you could possibly
like divert it

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.140
so that it would go away from
land instead of towards land.

00:28:32.140 --> 00:28:35.240
So they spend the whole
hurricane season of 1947

00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.950
waiting for the right
hurricane, like, we

00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:38.550
need a hurricane
that we can go--

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.340
and finally, one comes through.

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.310
And they jump on planes.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:44.960
And they fly down to the
military base in Florida.

00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:48.700
And the hurricane has
come up through the gulf,

00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:52.880
it's crossed the tip of Florida,
and it's chugging out to sea

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.070
in a northeasterly direction.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:58.756
And they fly out there and they
seed it, they cloud seed it.

00:28:58.756 --> 00:29:00.130
And the point at
which they cloud

00:29:00.130 --> 00:29:05.180
seed it is the point at which
makes that dog leg turn left.

00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:07.770
And it comes back to shore.

00:29:07.770 --> 00:29:11.300
It just turns around, comes back
to shore, slams into Savannah,

00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:13.760
hits Charleston, destroys
a whole bunch of planes

00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.120
at the airport.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:17.270
Millions of dollars
worth of property damage.

00:29:17.270 --> 00:29:19.100
A guy's killed by
a falling tree.

00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:20.340
It's a disaster.

00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.510
It's a total disaster.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:27.420
And everyone down
there is furious

00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.220
because it's been reported that
Project Cirrus is coming down

00:29:30.220 --> 00:29:32.130
to see if they can
steer a hurricane.

00:29:32.130 --> 00:29:34.570
The mayor of Savannah
says, if anybody from GE

00:29:34.570 --> 00:29:38.530
shows up in Savannah, he's
going to throw them in jail.

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:41.922
Another journalist says,
it's a low Yankee trick,

00:29:41.922 --> 00:29:43.380
which of course,
like they're still

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:46.180
fighting the Civil War, right?

00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.560
So GE gets all the
scientists on the plane,

00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:50.640
flies them back to
Schenectady, pushes them out

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:51.430
in a press talk.

00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.090
And they're like,
no, we did not seed.

00:29:54.090 --> 00:29:55.930
No, we didn't see the hurricane.

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:57.790
We were just looking
at the hurricane.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:29:59.700
We really-- nope, nope.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.830
They just deny, deny, deny.

00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:06.880
And so that's kind of
an interesting moment,

00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.120
I think, for Bernie.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:10.280
Because suddenly
it becomes clear

00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:13.270
that even if your goal
is not to make a weapon,

00:30:13.270 --> 00:30:15.300
you might make one by mistake.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.560
Because the atmosphere
is really unpredictable.

00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.580
On the other hand,
the entire world

00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:24.700
is really excited about
the fact that weather

00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:26.890
is going to be our
next big super weapon.

00:30:26.890 --> 00:30:29.040
And people are
going around saying,

00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.060
this is more important
than the atomic bomb.

00:30:32.060 --> 00:30:33.930
And I love this
cover of "Collier's."

00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:37.180
This is the kind of thing
that everyone's envisioning.

00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.800
We're just going to be at
our control panel here.

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:42.560
And this is written
by a military man.

00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.920
This is how we're going
to dominate the world.

00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.490
This is about the time
that Kurt Vonnegut

00:30:48.490 --> 00:30:52.830
decides to write a new kind
of story, a kind of story that

00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:54.190
features a scientist.

00:30:54.190 --> 00:30:58.090
And the scientist is kind of
faced with an ethical dilemma.

00:30:58.090 --> 00:31:01.290
And that is, he's invented
something new and cool,

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:02.510
but it could go wrong.

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:03.830
It could get out of his hands.

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:05.900
It could do something
really-- or it

00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.130
could be co-opted to
be used as a weapon.

00:31:09.130 --> 00:31:14.030
He writes a story called "Report
on the Barnhouse Effect,"

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.700
in which a scientist
discovers that he

00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:18.650
can control something
that was previously

00:31:18.650 --> 00:31:21.150
thought to be undiscoverable.

00:31:21.150 --> 00:31:23.830
He hopes to use his power
for humanity's good.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:26.100
And the military gets
involved and wants

00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:27.990
to use it as a super weapon.

00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:31.370
They take over, they give
it a sci-fi-like code name.

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:33.230
They call it Project
Wishing Well,

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:37.510
and they start trying to conduct
experiments to figure out

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:38.900
how to weaponize it.

00:31:38.900 --> 00:31:44.240
And professor Barnhouse has
to figure out what to do.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.720
This is Kurt Vonnegut's
first published story.

00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:49.400
He finally gets it right.

00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.180
He finally cracks the code.

00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:55.370
And in the meantime, starts
developing the voice that we

00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:59.500
think of as Kurt Vonnegut, and
the science fictional strategy

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.380
that we think of as
particularly Vonnegut's.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:06.840
And it's not really science
fiction of the old science

00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:11.070
fiction type, with like set
in alien worlds and space

00:32:11.070 --> 00:32:12.340
wars and stuff.

00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:14.440
All he does is he
takes the things

00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:18.050
that he's seeing at GE, and
particularly the dilemmas

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.630
that he's seeing his brother
go through, and amps them

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:26.300
up a little in order to
surface their ethical issues.

00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:32.510
For instance, GE is
the first corporation

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:35.400
that owned a
differential analyzer,

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.480
as they called it then.

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.770
A very early computer.

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:41.610
It was a room-sized,
extremely noisy computer.

00:32:41.610 --> 00:32:44.230
The programmers, however,
dressed very well,

00:32:44.230 --> 00:32:47.610
as you can see, to work on it.

00:32:47.610 --> 00:32:50.590
This computer was
called OMIBAC, which

00:32:50.590 --> 00:32:59.140
is ordinal memory inspection--
binary inspection computer,

00:32:59.140 --> 00:33:00.280
or something like that.

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.030
I can't remember
exactly what it is.

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:05.800
But all the computers
at this time

00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:09.040
had names like
this-- ENIAC, EDVAC.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.450
So OMIBAC is GE'S computer.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.670
Kurt writes a story
about a computer

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:19.210
called EPICAC--
and this also sells

00:33:19.210 --> 00:33:21.730
as a successful
story-- that falls

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:25.220
in love with its programmer's
object of affection,

00:33:25.220 --> 00:33:28.430
and is cranking out, in this
illustration from the story,

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:31.340
is cranking out
love poetry for her.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.280
EPICAC then goes on to become
the name of the computer

00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:36.180
in "Player Piano" that
controls everything.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.390
Kurt writes a story,
and this story

00:33:42.390 --> 00:33:46.060
is actually in the
GE house magazine,

00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:50.550
written by Kurt Vonnegut, but
unsigned, about ultrasonics.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:55.210
GE was just starting to enter
into research into ultrasonic.

00:33:55.210 --> 00:33:58.650
And Kurt did the press
release and story about it.

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:01.310
And then around
about the same time,

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:05.630
he writes a short story called
"The Euphio Question" in which

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:08.139
there's a radio wave
invented that's really

00:34:08.139 --> 00:34:09.965
this great sounding radio wave.

00:34:09.965 --> 00:34:11.340
And when people
hear it they just

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:14.239
drop whatever they're doing and
they lie around and bliss out

00:34:14.239 --> 00:34:16.639
listening to this radio wave.

00:34:16.639 --> 00:34:18.460
And so it's this huge
disrupting force.

00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:20.360
So again, he's
like saying, well,

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:24.210
there's this new
technology, but what if.

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:26.650
How it might go wrong?

00:34:26.650 --> 00:34:29.429
There's another story
called "Thanasphere"

00:34:29.429 --> 00:34:32.940
about a scientist who is
working for the military,

00:34:32.940 --> 00:34:35.400
helping them put a manned
satellite in space.

00:34:35.400 --> 00:34:38.179
Its job is to keep
tabs on the weather.

00:34:38.179 --> 00:34:40.710
But what the man inside
the satellite finds out

00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:43.770
is that space is actually
full of the dead.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:46.179
There are all these voices
of the dead up there

00:34:46.179 --> 00:34:47.730
that want to be heard.

00:34:47.730 --> 00:34:50.070
The military men
can't let this out

00:34:50.070 --> 00:34:51.820
because they don't
want to admit that they

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:55.130
have a satellite, because the
Russians might not like that.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:58.320
So they actually bring
it down and kill the guy.

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:03.450
The scientist in this
story is named Bernard.

00:35:03.450 --> 00:35:05.270
So this was really fun for me.

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.620
As you can imagine,
I totally geeked out

00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:12.840
and spent a few months knocking
around in the GE archive,

00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.870
and discovering many
of the source material

00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:20.670
sources for the early
Vonnegut short stories.

00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:24.640
So when I gave this
talk at Vonnegut fest,

00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.030
it was sort of like a,
identify this story.

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:30.620
Because there was
the time that a deer

00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:35.030
gets into the factory at
GE and has to be removed.

00:35:35.030 --> 00:35:36.950
And the press,
the GE news bureau

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:39.020
is called over to report on it.

00:35:39.020 --> 00:35:41.270
This, of course,
becomes the first story

00:35:41.270 --> 00:35:46.460
that Kurt sold to "Esquire"
called "Deer in the Works."

00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.610
There's the GE sales force
refrigerator that walks

00:35:49.610 --> 00:35:51.880
and talks and travels around.

00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.370
There's a salesman who
travels around with it.

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:59.190
And it's just a little PR stunt.

00:35:59.190 --> 00:36:01.850
Kurt-- and here is starting
to get really clever.

00:36:01.850 --> 00:36:05.720
He turns it into a female,
which then makes it

00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:09.450
into kind of a sexy sexbot,
and the salesman who

00:36:09.450 --> 00:36:12.420
travels with it loses his
ability to relate to real women

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:15.020
because he's so in
love with his fridge.

00:36:15.020 --> 00:36:19.230
It's like an early version
of Scarlett Johansson

00:36:19.230 --> 00:36:20.940
as an operating system.

00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:25.180
This poor guy is an air
conditioning engineer

00:36:25.180 --> 00:36:26.830
who really loved model trains.

00:36:26.830 --> 00:36:29.340
And Kurt reports on
his model train hobby,

00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:30.900
and then he writes
a story called

00:36:30.900 --> 00:36:33.230
"With his Hand on the
Throttle" about a guy who's

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:35.960
so obsessed with model trains
that he ignores his wife.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:41.970
And this is Liaquat Ali Khan,
the first prime minister

00:36:41.970 --> 00:36:46.310
of Pakistan, who comes to
the United States in 1950

00:36:46.310 --> 00:36:48.520
and is given a state tour.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:50.420
He's trotted all
around the country.

00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:54.680
He's taken to see an average
American family in Kansas City.

00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:57.320
He's taken to see the Tomb
of the Unknown Soldier.

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.340
He meets the president.

00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:02.280
He meets Eisenhower,
General Eisenhower,

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:04.790
whose then president
of Columbia University.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:10.420
He goes to see farms and
factories and prize cattle.

00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:14.210
And eventually, of course,
washes up on the shores of GE,

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:17.580
where they take him to see
a worker driving rivets

00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.620
into an enormous flywheel.

00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:26.010
Liaquat Ali Khan is
assassinated one year later.

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:28.200
No one's ever really
figured out who did it,

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:31.790
but the point at which Liaquat
Ali Khan is assassinated

00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:33.610
is the point at
which Kurt decides

00:37:33.610 --> 00:37:37.640
to write the Shah of
Bratpuhr into "Player Piano."

00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.870
And the Shah of Bratpuhr is
given the same exact state tour

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:45.520
that Liaquat Ali Khan was
given when he came in 1950.

00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:49.880
And then, of course, there was
GE's corporate retreat center

00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.240
on Association Island,
where you arrived

00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:55.040
and you were issued your GE
t-shirt and your straw boater.

00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.670
I'm not sure what
the boater was about,

00:37:56.670 --> 00:37:58.320
but you had to have your boater.

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.970
Every year the promising
young men of GE

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:08.850
would be taken to
Association Island

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:13.870
for an orgy of team building
and corporate pep rallies.

00:38:13.870 --> 00:38:16.090
This is, of course,
the meadows, the source

00:38:16.090 --> 00:38:19.300
for the meadows in
"Player Piano," which

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.870
is just almost a word for
word transcription of what

00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:25.150
it was like to be at
Association Island.

00:38:25.150 --> 00:38:29.300
It was so mercilessly
skewered in "Player Piano"

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:33.130
that GE closed Association
Island a few years later.

00:38:33.130 --> 00:38:35.080
And Kurt Vonnegut,
in later life,

00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:36.410
took total credit for that.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:40.350
He was like, yep, one good thing
came out of my writing at GE.

00:38:40.350 --> 00:38:45.000
I got them to shut down
that stupid island.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.250
But the most famous thing that
came out of his time at Ge

00:38:49.250 --> 00:38:51.850
was ice-nine.

00:38:51.850 --> 00:38:56.090
Ice-nine, of course, is the
premise of "Cat's Cradle,"

00:38:56.090 --> 00:39:00.750
really his breakthrough
book published in 1963.

00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:04.270
And Kurt always told the
story about how ice-nine

00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:06.330
was actually Irving
Langmuir's idea.

00:39:06.330 --> 00:39:10.000
This is Irving Langmuir who
was "Time's" Man of the Week

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.670
for his weather projects.

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:16.740
Ice-nine was an idea that
Irving Langmuir came up

00:39:16.740 --> 00:39:19.590
with to entertain HG Wells.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:23.020
When HG Wells was touring
the GE factor in the 1930s,

00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.410
he was given Langmuir
as his guide.

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:29.539
And Langmuir said he
figured out-- he thought,

00:39:29.539 --> 00:39:31.330
I don't really know
how to talk to a writer

00:39:31.330 --> 00:39:33.530
because I'm a scientist.

00:39:33.530 --> 00:39:35.230
So I guess when you
talk to writers,

00:39:35.230 --> 00:39:37.920
you just have to give
them new ideas for books.

00:39:37.920 --> 00:39:41.430
So he said, hey, HG Wells, I
have a great idea for a book.

00:39:41.430 --> 00:39:43.500
How about a book
about a form of ice

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:45.930
that's stable and solid
at room temperature.

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:49.020
And it gets loose and
it destroys the world.

00:39:49.020 --> 00:39:52.500
And HG Wells, was like, eh, eh.

00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:53.932
And so the story was told.

00:39:53.932 --> 00:39:56.140
There were lots of stories
told about Irving Langmuir

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.930
because he was
famously absent-minded.

00:39:57.930 --> 00:40:00.310
He would step in a
can of paint and just

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:02.630
pull his foot out
and keep walking.

00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:06.320
Or there was a famous story
about how a woman on the stairs

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:08.060
fell down in front
of him and he just

00:40:08.060 --> 00:40:10.335
like stepped over
her and kept going.

00:40:10.335 --> 00:40:12.970
He would not recognize you
if he was deep in thought.

00:40:12.970 --> 00:40:17.930
He was a classic scientist
with his head in the clouds.

00:40:17.930 --> 00:40:23.030
So he was also the source
for Felix Hoenikker

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:25.180
in "Cat's Cradle."

00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:31.110
And this story about ice-nine
was told around the GE cocktail

00:40:31.110 --> 00:40:31.860
circuit.

00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:35.290
Kurt heard it and
thought, finders keepers.

00:40:35.290 --> 00:40:38.410
But the real ice-nine is
actually Bernie's invention.

00:40:38.410 --> 00:40:41.690
This is Bernie using
a hydrogen generator

00:40:41.690 --> 00:40:44.200
to light his silver iodide.

00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.170
Because he'd found that
if you aerosolize it,

00:40:46.170 --> 00:40:49.340
turn it into a smoke,
it works even better

00:40:49.340 --> 00:40:52.080
to precipitate the clouds.

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.560
And when Kurt asked Bernie
to explain his invention,

00:40:55.560 --> 00:40:57.120
Bernie explained it.

00:40:57.120 --> 00:41:02.210
He said, well, the
molecules in ice,

00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:03.740
when it becomes
crystalline, they

00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:06.820
can lock in
different formations.

00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:09.120
Think about cannonballs
on a courthouse lawn.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.590
You could stack them in
different formations.

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:14.820
And that's kind of why we have
these different crystalline

00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:15.760
forms of ice.

00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:18.000
We have ice-one,
ice-two, ice-three.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.630
At the time, ice,
there were only five

00:41:19.630 --> 00:41:22.480
known crystalline forms.

00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:26.070
And so, in "Cat's Cradle"
that's exactly how

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:29.220
ice-nine is explained,
in Bernard's exact words.

00:41:31.830 --> 00:41:34.920
So Bernard, during
all of this time,

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:42.460
is deeply concerned about the
weaponization of his cloud

00:41:42.460 --> 00:41:43.920
seeding project.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:48.760
And I threw in some slides about
something else I geeked out

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:50.421
on while I was
working on this book,

00:41:50.421 --> 00:41:52.670
because there was actually
a competing weather control

00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:55.180
project going on at the time.

00:41:55.180 --> 00:41:59.260
This is John von Neumann,
who was one of the first five

00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:02.150
members of the Institute for
Advanced Study in Princeton,

00:42:02.150 --> 00:42:02.860
New Jersey.

00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.040
Famous brilliant mathematician.

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.390
So smart people thought that
he probably wasn't even human.

00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:13.810
von Neumann was actually working
on a weather control project

00:42:13.810 --> 00:42:18.290
that he'd had knocking around
in his head since 1946.

00:42:18.290 --> 00:42:20.660
His idea was very,
very different

00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:22.300
from the GE scientists.

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.190
The GE scientists
were experimentalists.

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:25.320
They were empiricists.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.361
They were like, let's go
out and spray the clouds

00:42:27.361 --> 00:42:29.510
with some stuff and
see what happens.

00:42:29.510 --> 00:42:34.070
von Neumann thought, you
know, the weather is simply

00:42:34.070 --> 00:42:36.310
a problem of fluid dynamics.

00:42:36.310 --> 00:42:38.190
And he knew a lot
about fluid dynamics.

00:42:38.190 --> 00:42:39.880
von Neumann actually
did the math

00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:43.130
that proved the
implosion theory that

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:46.920
was used on the plutonium
bomb, Fat Man, that

00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.290
was dropped on Nagasaki.

00:42:48.290 --> 00:42:50.410
He was part of the
Manhattan Project.

00:42:50.410 --> 00:42:54.715
He was already thinking about
the thermonuclear bomb, which

00:42:54.715 --> 00:42:56.590
he and Edward Teller
were convinced should be

00:42:56.590 --> 00:43:00.540
built before anyone else was.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:02.870
Von Neumann wanted
to build a computer.

00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:05.370
He wanted to build a
super-fast computer,

00:43:05.370 --> 00:43:07.960
because he wanted it
to do the calculations

00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:09.142
for the thermonuclear bomb.

00:43:09.142 --> 00:43:11.350
And there was no computer
with enough computing power

00:43:11.350 --> 00:43:12.430
yet to do it.

00:43:12.430 --> 00:43:15.520
But he thought he had an
architecture that would work.

00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.830
He needed, however,
a public thing

00:43:18.830 --> 00:43:20.100
for the computer to work on.

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:23.460
He needed a public reason
for this computer to happen.

00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:24.960
So he approached
the weather bureau.

00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.620
He said, I've got
this great idea.

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:31.420
We could use the computer
to forecast the weather.

00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.260
Because the weather is
a deterministic system.

00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:38.310
And once we've got enough data
and enough computing power,

00:43:38.310 --> 00:43:41.250
we will be able-- and obviously,
I'm shortcutting a lot here--

00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:44.550
but we'll be able to predict
the weather infinitely.

00:43:44.550 --> 00:43:48.290
And once we can do that, we will
be able to control the weather.

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:53.580
Because it will surely have
instabilities in the system.

00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:55.990
Freeman Dyson was
a young physicist

00:43:55.990 --> 00:43:59.230
at the Institute for Advanced
Study at the same time.

00:43:59.230 --> 00:44:02.520
He heard von Neumann
give a talk at the time.

00:44:02.520 --> 00:44:06.810
And he kind of summarized
it as, all stable systems

00:44:06.810 --> 00:44:08.030
we shall predict.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.560
All unstable systems
we shall control.

00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.560
So von Neumann gets together
two groups of people.

00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:17.390
The first is a group
of meteorologists.

00:44:17.390 --> 00:44:20.670
These are the meteorologists who
are going to produce the math.

00:44:20.670 --> 00:44:23.190
Because of course, the math
for modeling the weather

00:44:23.190 --> 00:44:24.910
didn't yet exist.

00:44:24.910 --> 00:44:27.160
So they had to get together
the best and the brightest

00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:32.870
of meteorologists to come
up with the equations

00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:34.820
that they would feed
to the computer.

00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.450
The first round
of equations where

00:44:36.450 --> 00:44:41.410
fed, actually, to ENIAC, because
John von Neumann's computer

00:44:41.410 --> 00:44:42.740
wasn't done yet.

00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:45.360
And when I was looking
at the log books,

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.970
I just thought this was using.

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.430
The ENIAC-- this is
why Jon von Neumann

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:53.080
wanted to build a new computer.

00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:58.890
It's like 14:05 ENIAC
down, 14:15 still no ENIAC.

00:44:58.890 --> 00:45:01.410
It was so hard working
with this computer.

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:06.120
So in 1952, von Neumann's
computer is finished.

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:10.730
This thing is a Ferrari in
a land that has only seen

00:45:10.730 --> 00:45:12.940
horse and carriages so far.

00:45:12.940 --> 00:45:15.060
I mean, this was a
beautiful-- this is

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:16.480
what's called the IAS machine.

00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:19.010
It actually is now at
the Smithsonian Museum

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:21.310
of American History.

00:45:21.310 --> 00:45:23.980
And those things
along the bottom

00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:26.770
are Williams cathode ray tubes.

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:27.760
That's the memory.

00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:30.610
There were 40 of those
adding up to a total

00:45:30.610 --> 00:45:33.750
of five kilobytes of memory.

00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:36.340
Five whole kilobytes.

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:39.320
This was a supercomputer.

00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:41.570
And it was so compact.

00:45:41.570 --> 00:45:44.430
It only weighed a couple tons.

00:45:44.430 --> 00:45:47.780
It was eight feet long
and two feet wide.

00:45:47.780 --> 00:45:49.180
It's a beauty.

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:50.740
von Neumann was
very proud of it.

00:45:50.740 --> 00:45:57.200
And he fed his equations into
it and began predicting weather.

00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:01.030
However, he was best friends
with another guy, Norbert

00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:03.850
Wiener, a mathematician
at MIT, who

00:46:03.850 --> 00:46:06.820
thought, you know
what, you're never

00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:09.370
going to be able to predict
the weather infinitely,

00:46:09.370 --> 00:46:12.470
because the weather
is really unstable.

00:46:12.470 --> 00:46:16.180
And it's just got all these
tiny little instabilities in it

00:46:16.180 --> 00:46:18.350
that are going to
magnify at great speed.

00:46:18.350 --> 00:46:20.900
So you might be able
to predict the weather

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.990
for, Wiener thought 30 days.

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:26.150
It turns out it's
two weeks, right?

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:29.160
We can predict the
weather with some accuracy

00:46:29.160 --> 00:46:30.930
for two weeks out.

00:46:30.930 --> 00:46:34.980
And then it just
all goes to hell.

00:46:34.980 --> 00:46:36.010
It's a funny thing.

00:46:36.010 --> 00:46:38.549
Wiener and John von
Neumann were best friends.

00:46:38.549 --> 00:46:39.840
They were very, very different.

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:42.410
Wiener was a famous
pacifist who, after the war,

00:46:42.410 --> 00:46:45.070
famously refused to
share his research

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:49.590
work with anyone in the military
or defense contractors at all.

00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.420
And he wrote famous
articles about this.

00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:56.240
von Neumann, of course, was
the military's right hand man.

00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:59.500
One person who really
agreed with Wiener,

00:46:59.500 --> 00:47:04.170
who thought that he was kind
of a hero, was Kurt Vonnegut.

00:47:04.170 --> 00:47:08.280
Kurt Vonnegut read Wiener's
book "Cybernetics."

00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:10.780
"Cybernetics" is a book
that kind of nobody

00:47:10.780 --> 00:47:14.880
reads anymore, because it's
conclusions are so much

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:18.280
now a part of our DNA that
we don't even have to think

00:47:18.280 --> 00:47:19.457
about it or talk about it.

00:47:19.457 --> 00:47:21.290
But he basically was
one of the first people

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:23.310
to say, look, the brain
is a kind of computer

00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:26.340
and a computer is
a kind of brain.

00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:30.090
And Wiener also wanted to think
about the moral issues of this.

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:33.740
If computers start
doing-- if machines

00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:35.960
are doing our physical
labor, and computers

00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:38.465
begin doing our mental
labor, what kind of world

00:47:38.465 --> 00:47:39.500
will we have?

00:47:39.500 --> 00:47:40.990
What will happen to humanity?

00:47:40.990 --> 00:47:42.890
What kind of people
will we turn into?

00:47:42.890 --> 00:47:46.050
He was thinking hard about
these things in "Cybernetics."

00:47:46.050 --> 00:47:50.110
And then he was encouraged
to write a version of it

00:47:50.110 --> 00:47:52.630
without the math that was
called "The Human Use of Human

00:47:52.630 --> 00:47:54.060
Beings."

00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.760
Kurt was a big fan of
Wiener and of "Cybernetics,"

00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.510
and when he wrote
"Player Piano,"

00:47:58.510 --> 00:48:01.150
he actually quotes
Wiener at a couple points

00:48:01.150 --> 00:48:02.610
in "Player Piano."

00:48:02.610 --> 00:48:05.062
He sent the book
to Norbert Wiener,

00:48:05.062 --> 00:48:06.520
thinking that Wiener
would love it.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.570
Because Kurt was
basically saying,

00:48:08.570 --> 00:48:10.590
in a fictional form,
exactly what Wiener

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:13.320
was saying in his own work.

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:16.590
Much to his chagrin,
Wiener hated the book.

00:48:16.590 --> 00:48:18.940
And he sent him a
really nasty letter

00:48:18.940 --> 00:48:22.180
that's still extant-- it's
at MIT in his papers--

00:48:22.180 --> 00:48:27.980
where he said, playing
around with this fiction,

00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:30.380
whatever, not very serious.

00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:32.280
But the real
objection that he had,

00:48:32.280 --> 00:48:34.060
and he went on and
on about it, was

00:48:34.060 --> 00:48:37.410
there's a character in "Player
Piano" who writes a manifesto.

00:48:37.410 --> 00:48:39.320
And the manifesto
is basically taken

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:40.730
from Norbert Wiener's work.

00:48:40.730 --> 00:48:42.890
It sounds exactly
like Norbert Wiener,

00:48:42.890 --> 00:48:45.620
in which he's saying
human beings need to think

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:47.290
of themselves as human beings.

00:48:47.290 --> 00:48:49.740
They need to consistently
remind themselves

00:48:49.740 --> 00:48:52.240
that they're human beings.

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.910
And not let technology take
their essential humanity away

00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:58.510
from them.

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:01.290
Kurt Vonnegut name that
character Ludwig von Neumann.

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:02.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:03.890
Yeah.

00:49:03.890 --> 00:49:07.470
Which I have to think
was done ironically,

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.280
because von Neumann
was very excited

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.100
about self-replicating automata.

00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:14.570
He wrote a famous
paper about it.

00:49:14.570 --> 00:49:16.900
In any case, Wiener
was a skeptic

00:49:16.900 --> 00:49:20.504
not only about Kurt Vonnegut,
but about weather control.

00:49:20.504 --> 00:49:22.420
He really thought that
weather control was not

00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:23.086
going to happen.

00:49:23.086 --> 00:49:24.550
The system was too unstable.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:27.210
And even weather prediction
was going to be hard.

00:49:27.210 --> 00:49:29.620
Bernard Vonnegut is starting
to think the same thing.

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:31.720
And one of the reasons
he's starting to think that

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:36.280
is because as soon as weather
control became a thing,

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:39.690
people were making the
pilgrimage nonstop to GE

00:49:39.690 --> 00:49:42.560
to find out how to seed clouds.

00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:44.670
So New York City is
seeding the Catskills

00:49:44.670 --> 00:49:45.830
to fill their reservoirs.

00:49:45.830 --> 00:49:47.920
People in the Great Plains
are seeding the clouds

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:51.540
to try to steer
away hail storms.

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:53.280
This is some people
from New Mexico

00:49:53.280 --> 00:49:55.290
who came to-- they
were, of course, having

00:49:55.290 --> 00:49:58.420
a drought because they
live in New Mexico.

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:01.360
They were coming to check out,
thinking that they could seed

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.880
the clouds and fix New Mexico.

00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:07.060
Bernard is starting to
think, well, you know,

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.520
we're stinking up the whole
atmosphere of the nation

00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:10.590
with silver iodide.

00:50:10.590 --> 00:50:12.430
What could we actually be doing?

00:50:12.430 --> 00:50:14.100
What might be
happening out there?

00:50:14.100 --> 00:50:17.060
This is a map that
he made in 1951

00:50:17.060 --> 00:50:19.280
showing the areas
in the United States

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.000
that were under cloud
seeding contracts.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:24.640
So this is where
people were going out,

00:50:24.640 --> 00:50:26.860
spraying massive amounts
of silver iodide,

00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.450
because nobody knew how much
or how little you could use.

00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:30.860
They were just going out.

00:50:30.860 --> 00:50:35.000
There was one congressman who
would go out with dry ice,

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:38.030
like in a yogurt container,
and used a teacup to throw it

00:50:38.030 --> 00:50:39.760
out the window of a Cessna.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:44.060
And then if it rained, he would
land and jump out of the plane

00:50:44.060 --> 00:50:45.700
and go up to the
ranchers and be like,

00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:48.360
I just made you that rain.

00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.560
There were astonishing
things going on.

00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:52.930
And Bernard was really
interested in finding out

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:55.320
what was actually happening.

00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:59.100
He thought that their work
and that the work of all

00:50:59.100 --> 00:51:01.280
these amateurs
might, in fact, be

00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:06.080
changing be atmospheric
dynamics of North America.

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:08.000
And he started saying this.

00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:12.250
And people, of course, said to
him, well, don't be ridiculous.

00:51:12.250 --> 00:51:14.610
Nothing that humans
do could change

00:51:14.610 --> 00:51:16.980
the atmospheric dynamics.

00:51:16.980 --> 00:51:21.090
I mean, that's the whole climate
we're talking about, right?

00:51:21.090 --> 00:51:24.590
So I'm going to leave you there.

00:51:24.590 --> 00:51:28.590
I hope I have time if
there are questions.

00:51:28.590 --> 00:51:31.180
That's pretty much an outline
of the first half of the book.

00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:33.000
What happens in
the second half is

00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:35.330
Kurt continues to
write short stories

00:51:35.330 --> 00:51:39.510
and writes "Player Piano"
about what he's seeing at GE.

00:51:39.510 --> 00:51:41.680
And Bernard becomes
more and more convinced

00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.650
that he has to do something.

00:51:43.650 --> 00:51:46.390
And he kind of figures
out what, in part,

00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:50.560
through his conversations and
relationship with his brother.

00:51:50.560 --> 00:51:55.880
So I'm just curious to know
how many people in the room

00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:57.240
are Vonnegut fans?

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:00.710
Interesting.

00:52:00.710 --> 00:52:07.490
So Vonnegut fans who've read
more than two of the books?

00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:08.950
All of the books?

00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:10.128
Anybody?

00:52:10.128 --> 00:52:11.337
AUDIENCE: How many are there?

00:52:11.337 --> 00:52:13.502
GINGER STRAND: I don't even
know the answer to that.

00:52:13.502 --> 00:52:14.530
There are a lot.

00:52:14.530 --> 00:52:17.400
I was talking to someone who
was a fan of the short stories,

00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.525
which is I think the Vonnegut
that most people don't read.

00:52:20.525 --> 00:52:22.250
But the short stories
are pretty fun.

00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:26.600
AUDIENCE: I had a question.

00:52:26.600 --> 00:52:30.090
Was there tension
between Bernard and Kurt,

00:52:30.090 --> 00:52:33.790
because here's Bernard working
as this corporate scientist.

00:52:33.790 --> 00:52:37.090
I mean, at some point these
stories start coming out,

00:52:37.090 --> 00:52:39.530
and their kind of
goofing on the whole sort

00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:41.560
of military industrial complex.

00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:44.830
Did Bernard ever feel any
sort of pressure or tension

00:52:44.830 --> 00:52:47.710
that he's got this corporate
job as an in-house scientist,

00:52:47.710 --> 00:52:51.210
and yet his brother, who's at
some point also employed by GE,

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:52.990
is writing these
stories that are kind

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:54.340
of mocking the whole thing?

00:52:54.340 --> 00:52:56.090
GINGER STRAND: Yeah,
there was quite a bit

00:52:56.090 --> 00:52:59.400
of, I think, tension felt,
both of their parts in a way.

00:52:59.400 --> 00:53:03.950
Because Bernard agreed with
Kurt, but he loved his job.

00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:07.450
And he loved working
at GE, but at the risk

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:11.520
of giving you spoilers,
he does quit eventually.

00:53:11.520 --> 00:53:15.100
And it's partly because of
exactly the same things that

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:16.720
drove Kurt to quit,
not wanting to be

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.080
part of that corporate
world, and not wanting

00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:22.190
to be told that he had to
work with the military,

00:53:22.190 --> 00:53:27.170
that he had to do whatever the
corporation wanted him to do.

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:31.590
So I would say that most of
the anxiety was on Kurt's part.

00:53:31.590 --> 00:53:34.330
And there's a very funny letter
that Kurt wrote to his editor

00:53:34.330 --> 00:53:36.420
when "Player Piano"
was about to come out.

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:37.906
Which is the dark
night of the soul

00:53:37.906 --> 00:53:40.030
that you always have when
your first book comes out

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:40.960
as a writer.

00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:44.170
You're like, holy
crap, what have I done?

00:53:44.170 --> 00:53:45.610
Like people are
going to read this

00:53:45.610 --> 00:53:50.380
and I've exposed
myself or my whatever.

00:53:50.380 --> 00:53:53.090
And so he writes this holy
crap letter to his editor.

00:53:53.090 --> 00:53:56.760
And he says, you can never tell
anybody that I worked for GE,

00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.355
because GE has a
hostage-- my brother.

00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:04.830
So anyway.

00:54:04.830 --> 00:54:06.890
Thanks so much for coming.

00:54:06.890 --> 00:54:10.240
[APPLAUSE]
