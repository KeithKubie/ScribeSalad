00:00:07.316 --> 00:00:11.356
&gt;&gt;Teacher: What are some of
the ways that we can use money?

00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:15.696
&gt;&gt;Student: Spending,
investing, sharing and saving.

00:00:16.566 --> 00:00:18.856
&gt;&gt;Elaine: The kids are saving
money and they're setting goals.

00:00:18.856 --> 00:00:20.706
What do I want to save my money for?

00:00:21.346 --> 00:00:23.476
And some of the children are
actually starting to save

00:00:23.476 --> 00:00:24.976
for college, which is just incredible.

00:00:31.796 --> 00:00:35.196
&gt;&gt;Krupa: Come on in, hi.

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:37.216
Good morning, how are you?

00:00:37.216 --> 00:00:39.096
Your saving to go to college?

00:00:39.096 --> 00:00:41.256
It's so good that you're
saving for it now.

00:00:41.376 --> 00:00:44.266
&gt;&gt;Anthony: If you teach financial
literacy without application,

00:00:44.606 --> 00:00:47.596
or you offer a bank account
without the financial literacy,

00:00:47.626 --> 00:00:48.606
it doesn't really work.

00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:53.226
So Bracken has actually combined both,
and is teaching financial literacy

00:00:53.226 --> 00:00:57.266
in the classrooms, sending homework
and curriculum home that actually works

00:00:57.266 --> 00:01:00.486
with parents, and then every Friday,
there's a live bank that goes on here.

00:01:00.636 --> 00:01:03.396
&gt;&gt;Krupa: We come on campus early
in the morning and we're on campus,

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:07.616
and we set up a small bank on
campus, in a little janitor's closet.

00:01:07.786 --> 00:01:09.196
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You have fourteen
twenty-five,

00:01:09.196 --> 00:01:10.886
so you're almost there, okay?

00:01:11.496 --> 00:01:14.136
&gt;&gt;Krupa: They are given a deposit
bag at the beginning of the year.

00:01:14.136 --> 00:01:17.756
The bag includes a deposit book and
deposit slips, and that's to allow them

00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:21.216
to track and record their
weekly deposits.

00:01:21.826 --> 00:01:25.716
&gt;&gt;Student: If I deposit the first
time, I would have got to the stamp.

00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:26.716
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yeah, it's okay.

00:01:26.716 --> 00:01:29.606
You just keep depositing,
even if it's just fifty cents

00:01:29.606 --> 00:01:31.306
or a quarter or a penny that you find.

00:01:31.306 --> 00:01:33.926
As long as you deposit every
Friday, you'll still make it, okay?

00:01:35.046 --> 00:01:38.236
&gt;&gt;Elaine: The kids can bring in as
little as a quarter and deposit it

00:01:38.236 --> 00:01:40.136
in their account every Friday.

00:01:43.046 --> 00:01:46.176
&gt;&gt;Katie: We always tell them, you can
at least find a penny or ask to do a job

00:01:46.176 --> 00:01:48.566
or see if you can earn some money
that you can put in your bank.

00:01:48.726 --> 00:01:53.126
&gt;&gt;Peyton: I am saving
for a car or a computer.

00:01:53.886 --> 00:01:55.926
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth: I want to use
my money, is by saving it,

00:01:55.926 --> 00:02:01.896
and so later on when I retire
and stuff, I have a lot of money.

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:04.676
&gt;&gt;Krupa: We stamp them, we help
them track their participation

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:05.946
and then we reward them with a sticker.

00:02:08.256 --> 00:02:10.226
&gt;&gt;Lance: It gets the kids
used to saving money.

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:11.936
It gets them looking forward to a goal.

00:02:11.936 --> 00:02:15.346
You're not allowed to take the money out
until you graduate from Walter Bracken.

00:02:15.406 --> 00:02:17.146
So they actually get to
watch that money grow,

00:02:17.146 --> 00:02:19.976
even if it's only a few cents a week
or a dollar here, a dollar there.

00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:22.946
&gt;&gt;Krupa: Participation,
yeah, super saver.

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:28.356
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So remember, when we're
thinking about needs and wants,

00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:32.846
we have to think about who we are,
because everybody is different

00:02:33.116 --> 00:02:34.796
and everyone has different needs.

00:02:35.176 --> 00:02:37.786
Something that I might
need, you might not need.

00:02:37.786 --> 00:02:39.156
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth: It's like, preparing me.

00:02:40.306 --> 00:02:43.996
Like, each time she comes in, I
learn something new about saving

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:46.356
and spending and investing and sharing.

00:02:46.836 --> 00:02:51.746
&gt;&gt;Ethan: They're teaching life lessons,
like how you should know how to save

00:02:51.746 --> 00:02:56.946
and spend, because when we become an
adult and if we're never taught this,

00:02:56.946 --> 00:02:58.636
then we're not going to know what to do.

00:02:58.636 --> 00:03:02.586
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Yes, you get
interest, and what is interest?

00:03:02.686 --> 00:03:05.346
&gt;&gt;Student: Interest is when the bank
gives you more money for spending.

00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:09.076
&gt;&gt;Elaine: So in the third grade,
they focus a lot on wants and needs.

00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:12.906
What do I want and what do I
really need to take care of myself?

00:03:13.236 --> 00:03:16.166
&gt;&gt;Teacher: We're going to pass
out the cards and when I say go,

00:03:16.416 --> 00:03:19.966
you and your table together
pick six things to try

00:03:20.046 --> 00:03:21.956
and help you survive on
the island, all right?

00:03:23.096 --> 00:03:30.916
&gt;&gt;Student: No, no, wait, a saw, yes,
to chop down trees to get firewood.

00:03:33.126 --> 00:03:34.416
&gt;&gt;Teacher: So what did
your group choose?

00:03:34.416 --> 00:03:43.186
&gt;&gt;Students: Clean water, dried food,
matches, medicine, seeds and blankets.

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:44.616
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Really, really good choices.

00:03:44.616 --> 00:03:45.926
I think you would survive.

00:03:46.146 --> 00:03:48.936
Awesome, you all made
amazing choices today.

00:03:50.056 --> 00:03:52.566
&gt;&gt;Teacher: How much money do
you think you have in total?

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.296
&gt;&gt;Katie: I want my students
not to have a ton of debt.

00:03:54.476 --> 00:03:57.556
I want them to know to have a savings
account in case of an emergency.

00:03:57.606 --> 00:04:00.916
I want them to plan for their
retirement and not get caught off guard,

00:04:00.916 --> 00:04:03.726
and so that they can
actually live a comfortable,

00:04:03.726 --> 00:04:04.946
financially secure life in the future.
