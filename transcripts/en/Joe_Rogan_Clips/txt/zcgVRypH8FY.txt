Speaker 1:          00:00          Happen, the Joe Rogan experience and uh, got some techno Huntin as well. But I told you about that game. That game's very addictive, isn't it? I'm already ready trying to get back out there to do some more when it is over. So itchy, right? Yeah. Yeah. No, it's amazing man that, that game is incredible. How long have you been bowhunting for? I've been bow hunting since I was 16 or 17, but I've been hunting my whole life. Wow. What switched you over to bow hunting? I'm a high school teammate, actually. I used to go right behind and stuff with a shotgun and I've been shooting the ball since I was like 12 or 11 just three d shooting. Are you ever bowhunter will you can hunt with this like yeah, like we go hunt all the time. So I, one day before school he picked me up, went over to my buddy's house and got up in the stand.

Speaker 1:          00:41          When he got into the stand I couldn't climb because I didn't know where I was doing. I got stuck at the bottom of the tree. I knew him a bowl on my lap. So, but that was my first time and after that I just kept going every now and then in between practices and whatnot. But now when I've got time between fight, knowing that I'm all hunting, that's it. Well I can tell by your Instagram, man, I follow your Instagram, all your, you're constantly shooting and hunting, practicing and it's, it gets in your blood. Lemme just like fighting. Like I said, we were doing technique. I do it so much, it's muscle memory. Like everybody thinks, oh you spent too much time hunting, you're not training. When I go win a fight. And I'm like, oh that was impressive. Like I still train two or three times a day, but I get off from the gym and my, I always have a bowl on my truck.

Speaker 1:          01:20          I have three bowls on one is always on my truck. So I pull up, popped the door is open, grab my speaker in the targets is right there, get like 30 to 60 shots and then go and spend time with the family, eat, go back to the gym, come, go to the range and shoot indoors and it's dark. And I'm always shooting. I just enjoy it. Wow. So is it like a part of meditation for you, do you think? 100% come out to OSP fight? That was actually the first time I find it in Jersey. I've been in Jersey since 2014 when the show came out and I have to Osp Phi and all that stuff and everybody told me, I don't pay it. That you was winning that fight. You got caught. Don't let do people get in your head and tell you you're not there.

Speaker 1:          01:54          So actually the next day I went home, I went and bought him a hunting license and bought a Stan and high in Jersey for the first time and it helped me. I didn't think about it all from November to February 1st I wasn't a Theresa and every day, and I went back to training, like fool camp, whatever. Everything in my mind I follow, forgot all about that OSP fight. And that's what I told my wife. I found my balance. You know, the thing was, I was always in the gym and that's why the name 25 eight came because Corey never at the time I didn't do anything else with train. You know, we're trained to go to the gym and train to go therapy, go back to the gym and train, go home, ruin, go to garage, hit the heavy bag, go to mark Henry's hit pads and go try again. So yeah.
