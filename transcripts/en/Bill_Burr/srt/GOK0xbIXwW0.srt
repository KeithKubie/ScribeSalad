1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:04,670
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill Burr and
it's time for the Thursday afternoon.

2
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,810
Just before Friday,
Monday morning podcast and

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,170
ahhh

4
00:00:11,260 --> 00:00:16,020
just checking in on you.
Just seeing how your weeks go in,

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:20,320
how your life is,
how you're feeling this day.

6
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:25,900
Um, uh, I'm not, I don't
know. I don't, you know,

7
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,910
you know I was supposed to get my
Invisalign off yesterday. Right.

8
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,710
I was all excited.

9
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:37,750
The Shit was supposed to take 16 weeks
and because I wore them like a fucking

10
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:41,320
lunatic,
basically 24 seven occasion,

11
00:00:41,321 --> 00:00:43,660
I'd smoke a cigar or I do is set up.

12
00:00:43,661 --> 00:00:46,120
I did a long set and I didn't feel
like spitting all over the stage.

13
00:00:46,121 --> 00:00:46,954
I would take them up,

14
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:50,050
but a lot of times it just left him in
one time I left him and when I smoked a

15
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:52,450
cigar that was a bad move.
Bad move.

16
00:00:52,451 --> 00:00:55,210
I to sit there and brush and for like
an hour so they wouldn't be fucking all

17
00:00:55,211 --> 00:00:56,044
brown.

18
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,610
So the last time I saw my
dentist he's like, Oh gee.

19
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:05,710
Willikers it would wear on him so much.

20
00:01:05,711 --> 00:01:09,610
I think we'll be done by the 13th week.
And I was like,

21
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,420
you've gotta be kidding me. This is
a brand. I tried not to get excited.

22
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,200
I tried to be like, okay, well
I'm supposed to be, you know,

23
00:01:17,201 --> 00:01:20,770
just mentally just keeping prepared for
the end of March when these things are

24
00:01:20,771 --> 00:01:23,320
going to be off. So anyway,
so I go to the dentist, right?

25
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:26,620
And I'm wearing them and I'm wearing
them and I'm driving over, I'm wearing,

26
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:30,280
I'm chewing on the stupid sponge to make
sure the fucking trays all the way down

27
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:35,140
and all of that shit.
So I show up and he,

28
00:01:35,510 --> 00:01:38,350
you know, takes the things off. He's
all, he's all good. Oh man, he's, wow.

29
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:41,050
You really would. You'd see when
you comply, blah, blah, blah, blah.

30
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:42,730
Everything's good. And I'm sitting
there going, don't get excited.

31
00:01:42,731 --> 00:01:44,650
Don't cause he cause kid comes to however,

32
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,240
however we have two fucking weeks.
I was waiting for that shit. Right?

33
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:53,770
But he doesn't, he goes, he, these still
good enough to take them off today.

34
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:58,690
I was like, you gotta be kidding
me. I did it. Fucking did it.

35
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:02,690
This is like going into the fucking
Stanley Cup playoffs. All right. And,

36
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:07,100
and just sweeping everybody. See you
play like fucking, I dunno, we'll see a,

37
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,920
if you went seven games times
four, that's 12 Bubba, Bubba,

38
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:13,660
28 fucking games or
you could just play 16.

39
00:02:13,661 --> 00:02:18,280
I felt like I just played 16 games.
Fresh is a fucking daisy.

40
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:22,180
I'm ready to go another round. You already
handed me the trophy, right? So I said,

41
00:02:22,181 --> 00:02:24,940
all right, so he seats taken the
fucking clips off or whatever.

42
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:29,440
He's filing them down and shit.
And he's like, uh, I go, okay.

43
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,300
So on ally you have to do now is just
where this tray at night when I sleep for

44
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:38,020
the rest of my life. So they don't go
back, which is no big deal. I'm asleep.

45
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,020
The fuck, do I care?
Right? He goes, no, no.

46
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:47,260
Uh, this final tray, you have to
wear this for the next three months.

47
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:50,660
And then we give you the overnight
train and it's just like,

48
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:59,650
where's that in your initial pitch?
I still would have fucking done it,

49
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,010
but why are you full?
Just tear the bandaid off.

50
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,970
I could've just mentally
got myself but go right,

51
00:03:06,971 --> 00:03:09,220
the next six months of
my life is going to suck.

52
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:14,290
You've got me all excited about 16
weeks and then 13 and then it's going to

53
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,740
happen. And then, oh
by the way, by the way,

54
00:03:17,741 --> 00:03:22,270
here's another three months onto your
sentence. You're not out yet. Oh,

55
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:24,400
fucking bugged me. You know,
cause you know what it was.

56
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,160
Cause when he went initially
went to sell it to me,

57
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,030
he was too afraid that if you told
me I was going to be six months,

58
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:35,110
that I wasn't going to do
it. That's basically what it
is. That, you know, I get it.

59
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:37,030
Capitalism,
it's sales.

60
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:43,710
I I really wanted to, I didn't
say anything. I, you know,
what are you gonna do you?

61
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,770
The other day I got fucking
straight teeth and made it works.

62
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,760
The shit definitely works. I am
thrilled. I am elated with it. I just,

63
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,900
you know what I mean?
That's like something your wife does,

64
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,570
Bill. Is there anything
in the world, Bill,

65
00:03:57,571 --> 00:04:00,360
that you can't turn around and blame
women for? All right, you're right.

66
00:04:00,361 --> 00:04:01,950
I'm being emotional.
Being a cunt.

67
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,880
Yeah.

68
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,880
Fucking three more months. I
turned 53 months. You know,

69
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,280
you think I want to have fucking braces.
I don't know about you,

70
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:11,950
but that's not what of mine.
That's not one of my life's goals.

71
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,083
MMM.

72
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:18,980
So anyways, so now what's going on
is he took the fucking hooks off my,

73
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:22,710
I'm just giving you guys the blow by
blow. This guy's a great dentist. Okay.

74
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,260
You know,

75
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:25,440
could have been a little
more straightforward about
how long this was going to

76
00:04:25,441 --> 00:04:29,890
fucking take. You know, just
dump the bowl over my head.

77
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,860
Stuff like taking a little spoonfuls
and putting in my mother's head. Okay,

78
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:33,700
can you handle that

79
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:38,303
anyways?

80
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:40,803
MMM.

81
00:04:41,860 --> 00:04:43,150
I ain't know what the
fuck does he notices?

82
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,970
So now the hooks are
off these fucking things

83
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,660
and uh, this is like getting out of jail
cause you just don't get out of jail.

84
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,240
They go from maximum to
like medium to minimum two.

85
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,000
You're living in some guy's fucking
house and you can go out and go get a

86
00:04:59,001 --> 00:05:01,580
fucking Bagel and you got to come
back and report to somebody. This is,

87
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:05,340
this is how the Invisalign's going down.
Um,

88
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:07,830
I am in the,
uh,

89
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,860
the halfway house or the fucking minimum
security building of this shit now,

90
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,420
the three months, whatever.
I don't even fucking notice
him. I'm, I'm Kinda over it.

91
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:22,760
I did have two event I did at the vent
on the podcast about it, but it's,

92
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,000
it's just, you fucking know it. Just,

93
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,770
just tell me what I'm in
for so I can prepare for it.

94
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:34,090
It's like one of those fucking movies
while you're sitting. Did you guide them?

95
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:37,070
Cubicle Odesk and you finished a
stack of papers. You're like, ah,

96
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:38,540
you fucking put your foot up on a desk.

97
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,130
Guy Comes back with
another stack of papers,

98
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,433
you know.

99
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:49,610
Anyways, any wish, um, oh fucking, uh,

100
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,500
Billy Boston Bruin
bandwagon is jumping on.

101
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,370
I've watched the last three
games to be with you. I missed,

102
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,640
I turned on the last Bruins game or you
know, I got a kid now, so I do what I can.

103
00:06:01,670 --> 00:06:05,680
All right. I put the game on when
it was four to one. All right.

104
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,700
I watched a beat the
Black Hawks on Saturday.

105
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:11,720
I watched him lose on Sunday and on.
I put the game on,

106
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,440
it was David down four to one. I was like,
Jesus Christ, every time I fuck a week,

107
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,190
they do nothing. But when, whenever I
turn them on, they fucking loose. And um,

108
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:23,270
so I got the game on.
You don't medium volume.

109
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,900
I'm in the kitchen with my beautiful
daughter and I'm making her some dinner.

110
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,080
I came in with the hell I meda,
she likes these meatballs, right?

111
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,940
With the vegetables in that type of stuff.

112
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,390
And now what are we trying to
keep her away from? Uh, you know,

113
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,840
all the sugar in that type of shit.
However, you know, occasionally, you know,

114
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:42,680
my kid's not gonna not have McDonald's.
You know what I mean?

115
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,010
I'm not going to take it to that
level where the kid is like, oh,

116
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:49,880
can I have some dessert?
And be like, yeah, here's a
Kiwi or some shit like that,

117
00:06:49,881 --> 00:06:52,340
even though you probably should do that.
I don't know.

118
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,273
MMM.

119
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,850
So anyways, I, I have the game. I'm,

120
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:01,610
and I'm out in the kitchen and then
I just heard Jack Edwards going crazy

121
00:07:02,170 --> 00:07:04,600
three goals at 77 seconds.

122
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,430
So I come running in like what the fuck?
What the fuck just happened?

123
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,190
Long story short,
the Bruins scored.

124
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:15,230
They would that they scored five goals
in the third period to win six to five.

125
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,900
The last one was an empty Magda.

126
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:20,583
MMM.

127
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:23,740
They scored him so fast.
I don't even know who fucking scored up.

128
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,490
I can't even remember who the hell
scored them pasta knock out one of them.

129
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:30,471
Uh,

130
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:35,471
but I do know that we also lost like
three guys got hurt during the game.

131
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:39,490
Tory crew to brusque and fucking today.
No Chara but I,

132
00:07:39,491 --> 00:07:41,720
I looked at the replay
because I missed those place.

133
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:45,920
They didn't look a sitting on my couch
and not having to endure the pain.

134
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,560
They didn't look too bad.
Um,

135
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:53,630
Chara went down like someone in a public
skating rink is what that looked like.

136
00:07:53,631 --> 00:07:56,000
And then he just slid into the board.
Looks like he hit his shoulder.

137
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:57,470
He was walking off fine.

138
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,630
You know when he was off the ice
and he was going through the tunnel,

139
00:07:59,631 --> 00:08:02,030
he seemed all right.
Granted,

140
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:05,480
he's also like nine feet tall
and can do like over 40 pull ups,

141
00:08:05,481 --> 00:08:08,810
which makes no fucking sense at 40,
41 years of age.

142
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,140
It's easy for the little guys because
they don't have to travel as far.

143
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,890
But to bring that giant body and all
the way the fuck down, it's like,

144
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:19,460
it's like the little guys going
up like two, two steps in. He's,

145
00:08:19,461 --> 00:08:22,430
he's gotta run up like nine flights
of stairs every time he does. It's,

146
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:25,310
it's unreal. So he's tough as
nails. I think he'll be back.

147
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:30,050
I don't know what happened at Tory crude
and, uh, Debra's hopefully have by just,

148
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:34,850
I dunno,
got a mild sort of a fountain,

149
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:37,010
his brain around a little
bit. But, uh, anyways,

150
00:08:37,011 --> 00:08:40,940
we're playing the Florida panthers
tonight, seven 34 30 my time,

151
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,840
seven 30 east coast time.
And the panthers fight the most,

152
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:50,210
have the most fighting
majors in the NHL this year.

153
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,870
And it's like some pathetically
low number. I think they're in the,

154
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:57,690
they've had like 20 fighting majors.
They average of fight, like basically,

155
00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,430
you know, every three
games. Um, it's just,

156
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,670
it's just completely out of the fucking
league and it sucks. But granted,

157
00:09:05,671 --> 00:09:07,340
I'm not the guy who, I
don't have to fight, right.

158
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:09,840
I don't have to walk around dealing with
the concussions and all of that shit.

159
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:14,520
But, you know, just as a fan, I
miss it. So they got them on, uh,

160
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:19,860
they got them today, Thursday, and
then Saturday when I'm up in, uh,

161
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,220
Ontario, they got the lightning, so they
got some big games coming up Monday.

162
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:23,851
The blue jackets,

163
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:25,610
I don't even know how they're doing
because I haven't been watching anything,

164
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,490
but I'm back.
I'm back on fucking bored here.

165
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:35,340
Um, a lot of new faces and
shit. But, um, you know,

166
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:39,360
like I said, I've watched so
many games in the last 10 years,

167
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:44,220
the 820 regular season games,
I bet I saw at least, you know,

168
00:09:44,221 --> 00:09:45,180
500 of them.

169
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:49,290
So I missed like the last fucking
60 that they had this year.

170
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:54,270
Essentially. I only saw maybe five
games this year. Uh, it's embarrassing,

171
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,950
but uh, which sucks because I watched
them totally dismantled a team,

172
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,450
you know, four years ago or something. And
go all the way back down to rebuilding.

173
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:04,561
And I was like,

174
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:07,410
I'm going to watch this whole rebuild
in this year when it all fucking came

175
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:12,360
together. Uh, I mean, what
am I complaining about? Oh,
I had to go and become a dad,

176
00:10:12,361 --> 00:10:15,510
which is the most amazing
fucking thing ever. Um,

177
00:10:16,830 --> 00:10:21,270
my little one's starting to try to
run now, which is hilarious. Um,

178
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:23,520
and also we've been
doing this thing where a,

179
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,490
when she's done with the toy and then
she wants to play with something else,

180
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:30,000
she has to put away the other
toy and she just has it down.

181
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,630
She likes it cause we applaud
every time she puts some way.

182
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:37,380
She's playing with these giant Lego's
today and we, and she wanted that.

183
00:10:37,381 --> 00:10:40,050
She wanted to have this
bag of like, uh, you know,

184
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,860
multicolored fucking little like, yeah,
they almost look like ping pong balls,

185
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:45,930
right? She wants to go play with those
fucking things. So I was just like,

186
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,820
all right, well you got to put
away the Lego blocks first.

187
00:10:48,450 --> 00:10:51,330
So she starts putting them away and I'm
applauding on everyone that she does.

188
00:10:51,331 --> 00:10:54,180
And then there's two stuck
together and she fucking,

189
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:58,740
she pulled them apart before she put
them away. And as a parent right there,

190
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,720
you're like, oh my God, my kid
is a genius. You know, like,

191
00:11:02,721 --> 00:11:05,520
like you have Einstein is a
kid rather than, it was a, uh,

192
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:09,750
a pretty logical step that they were just
able to make, but it's still thrilling.

193
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:13,950
Everything is fucking
thrilling. So anyways, um,

194
00:11:13,951 --> 00:11:15,420
this morning I go outside,
right?

195
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:19,710
I play a little game on Thursday
when the trash comes out. Um,

196
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,840
is I'm always listening for the
garbage truck. All right. Because, um,

197
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,180
now that I don't have a
dog, I mean, I still do.

198
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,020
It's still technically my dog and she's
in town this week and I'd been taking

199
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:38,310
her on these long hikes every day.
It's been awesome. She looks great,

200
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,970
she just looks great and
she's so freaking happy.

201
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,700
And I told you for the
first time in her life,

202
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:48,990
she has another dog that she's friends
with, which she never did. You know,

203
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:52,530
she was never in that mindset when someone
with my limited skill set at or she

204
00:11:52,531 --> 00:11:57,370
tried to fucking you, she usually
ignored bigger dogs and then little dogs,

205
00:11:58,910 --> 00:12:00,930
not little dogs would bark at
her and she would ignore them.

206
00:12:00,931 --> 00:12:04,830
And then bigger dogs, she would also
ignore them until they started some shit.

207
00:12:04,831 --> 00:12:09,400
You know, I believe in the hip
hop community that's known as, uh,

208
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:15,490
don't start. Nothing, won't be nothing.
I believe that that's where my dog,

209
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:20,950
her mindset was from.
So anyways,

210
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,170
but I always fucking hated is
when the trash is out the barrels,

211
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:29,830
once they empty the fucking, that the
trash truck comes by the garbage truck,

212
00:12:29,831 --> 00:12:34,270
if you will empties the fucking thing out.
You have basically about a minute,

213
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,600
when you live in Los [inaudible] before
some fucking dog on and [inaudible]

214
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:43,560
comes by and takes a shit bag and throws
in a year, you're, uh, you're trashed out.

215
00:12:43,561 --> 00:12:47,080
Which I don't necessarily give a shit
this time of year because it's cold out.

216
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:48,220
But during the hot months,

217
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:52,600
you know to have some statement bag of
fucking Shit marinating in your thing.

218
00:12:52,601 --> 00:12:55,240
That's not even from your own dog.
It's so it's a little annoying.

219
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:59,540
I appreciate you keeping the
city fucking clean. But the,

220
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:02,470
there is something about
that that is just a little,

221
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,500
it's a little fucking annoying.
So this morning I,

222
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,860
I've been hearing phantom garbage trucks
had been out there like nine times.

223
00:13:08,861 --> 00:13:13,270
I only put away the recycling and a, I
got a feeling while I'm doing the podcast,

224
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:15,060
I'm going to hear this fucking
thing coming up the street.

225
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:17,980
I'm gonna tell you right now, if I
do, I'm, I'm throwing down the mic.

226
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,610
I'm going to go out there and get in
and put that thing back inside. But um,

227
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,520
I got a bunch of shit that I got handled.
I am back on Instagram.

228
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:31,300
[inaudible] everybody, I got to get
the check next to my fucking name.

229
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:34,720
So it's verified cause I guess there's
some people in person hating me,

230
00:13:34,721 --> 00:13:37,900
which is really flattering.
Um,

231
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,590
I have not been on there since 2012.

232
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:45,160
Instagram was not something
that I gravitated towards,

233
00:13:45,161 --> 00:13:47,950
but everybody keeps telling me, you
got to get on it. You got to get on it.

234
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,260
And I was sick of fighting the UK's there
and a, so I'm going to get back on it,

235
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:57,880
I guess. Um, it's been six years
since I've been away. Okay.

236
00:13:58,150 --> 00:14:01,290
It feels like I've had Invisalign on
for fucking 12 years at this point now.

237
00:14:01,310 --> 00:14:03,940
It hasn't been that bad is
as he had been that bad.

238
00:14:03,941 --> 00:14:06,190
It's just that I got fucking
excited that it was over.

239
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,800
Yeah.

240
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:12,320
Honey, we done. I'm going to blame
women again and we'd done this is it,

241
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,640
this is the last store and then,
oh,

242
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,620
do I do with this one claim to
want to look at some cosmetics.

243
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:22,000
Asshole.
Here's a question.

244
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:23,740
Why don't they have bars at malls?

245
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:25,850
Yeah.

246
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,170
You know, I guess they do the
kind of like sports bars and shit.

247
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:29,470
Yeah.

248
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:32,470
I'm going to go into, hey, what are you
going honey? Take all the time you need.

249
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,490
I'm going to go in here and get
fucking loaded. Okay. I will,

250
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:40,030
I will do my best to help you with
the bags of shit that you don't need,

251
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:42,880
that you're going to be carrying
out and then you're driving home.

252
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:44,880
How does that sound?
Okay.

253
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,953
Well I wanted,

254
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:49,860
that's the thing does she does.

255
00:14:49,861 --> 00:14:53,480
So what's the exact thing
that makes him a great mother?

256
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:57,380
Makes them an annoying partner.
It's just like,

257
00:14:57,381 --> 00:15:01,430
just go do something by yourself.
Stop dragging me.

258
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:04,160
Why am I being such a jerk?
Because of my fucking Invisalign.

259
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:08,000
I like hanging out with my wife and I've
mentioned before when I didn't have the

260
00:15:08,001 --> 00:15:09,950
hope that my Invisalign
was being taken off,

261
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:12,730
that I actually enjoy going to the mall
with my wife and kid there. I said it.

262
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:17,480
Um,
all right.

263
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:23,070
Anyways, I'm starting to understand tea
by the way. Okay. I never understood it.

264
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:27,210
It's like it's hot as fuck. It Burns
your tongue. This isn't relaxing.

265
00:15:27,211 --> 00:15:31,230
It's like no stupid. It's hot as fuck. So
it activates what's ever in the tea bag.

266
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,060
And then once that's done,

267
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:36,990
you then take the fucking tea bag out
and you throw it out like an Englishman.

268
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:37,831
All right?

269
00:15:37,831 --> 00:15:41,400
You don't keep if you don't leave it in
there like from sloppy American like me.

270
00:15:41,401 --> 00:15:44,160
You take that out and you
let it fucking cool down.

271
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:47,190
Now that everything's been accurate,
activate and then you drink it.

272
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,790
But the problem is is you've
just ordered a tea. That's fine.

273
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,470
But if you've got something else coming
by the time the fucking thing cools down

274
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:57,300
your, your, your,

275
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,700
your little Danish or whatever the
hell you ordered is already there.

276
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,110
Your crumpet what the fuck is a crumpet?
Is that a biscuit and biscuits?

277
00:16:04,111 --> 00:16:05,370
A cookie over there,
right?

278
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,503
Crump.

279
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,510
Oh that's what the C strumpet crumpet

280
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:21,320
Oh, it's an English muffin. Uh,

281
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:24,470
fuck out of here. That's all it
is. Teen Krumpit I never, you know,

282
00:16:24,471 --> 00:16:26,420
it's funny cause you don't need long.
I've been saying that.

283
00:16:26,421 --> 00:16:30,130
I had no idea who was always picked a
little fucking round like Pale looking

284
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,193
rich crack.

285
00:16:31,970 --> 00:16:36,200
How to make crumpets
BBC good food and air.

286
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,680
Air Doesn't like a good it
with their fucking, you know,

287
00:16:39,681 --> 00:16:42,620
nobody to a fucking crumble with this
shit. Right. That's just something,

288
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:47,930
by the way,

289
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:52,160
has there ever not been an upbeat
chef and they always play like that.

290
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:55,040
Everything's gonna be
okay. Music, you know,

291
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,530
flour, salt and sugar. Some Oregano,

292
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,030
some tomatoes.

293
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:10,360
Okay. Stirring it all the time.
He put it, I could do this shit.

294
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,630
I didn't know I can make
my own English muffins.

295
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,280
Is this like Philly cheese steak where
you don't say Philly cheese steak.

296
00:17:18,281 --> 00:17:22,000
When you just say cheese steak.
When you're in England,

297
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:25,840
you don't say English muffin. You
don't even say muffin. You said crumpet

298
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:32,170
Oh God, this woman is either
terrible or unbelievable in bed.

299
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:36,190
I don't know why. I just
thought that, oh, she's,

300
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:38,560
she's into the culinary arts.
You know, she figured, you know,

301
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,830
she's in touch with something. Who
knows? You know, sometimes people,

302
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,960
they actually are given one
talent. Sometimes it just, it's an,

303
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,110
it's an overall philosophy
that goes through.

304
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:53,220
Um, all right. Let me read a
little bit of advertising here. Uh,

305
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:58,050
then I'll talk about my pathetic attempts
to try to fucking learn this song for

306
00:17:58,051 --> 00:18:01,290
the Goddamn comedy jam. It has
double bass in it. And, uh,

307
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:05,130
I haven't even really been
noticing, but like, um,

308
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,680
I'm left handed and I'm right handed at
the same time and that's fucking with my

309
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:15,270
double bass playing because sometimes
I have a tendency to lead with my left

310
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:19,050
foot. Other Times I have a tendency
to lead with my right foot.

311
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:23,250
You know, like if you're
going to do like a, uh,

312
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,400
like booms up at the back,
right,

313
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:30,560
whatever that is a fucking triplet right
before the snare hit where it's going

314
00:18:30,561 --> 00:18:35,310
to be like right left, right or left,
right, left. I always go left right,

315
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:37,690
left.
I kind of feel like it's,

316
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:41,520
it's like if it's on the offbeat or
something like that, if it's on, you know,

317
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,080
if it's on one and two and three and
four and that should be right foot.

318
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:49,500
And if it's on the other ones,
I'm going left foot.

319
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:54,510
Right. I don't know. I have no idea.

320
00:18:54,511 --> 00:18:59,511
But all I know was I'm trying to learn
this fucking song and the crashes on the

321
00:19:02,671 --> 00:19:07,520
offbeat and I do that with my right foot.
And then I think what I was doing,

322
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:07,711
I was,

323
00:19:07,711 --> 00:19:10,530
when I was playing it up to speed and I
was just having fun and I didn't think

324
00:19:10,531 --> 00:19:11,040
anybody was,

325
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,320
I was actually going to play it in front
of people and they were going to watch

326
00:19:13,321 --> 00:19:13,890
me.

327
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:18,630
I think I was actually
playing left foot lead.

328
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:21,270
But then when I sat
down and broke it down,

329
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:26,730
I flipped it and I went from being able
to play it to up to temple to drop in

330
00:19:26,731 --> 00:19:29,730
like 30 bpms. And I'm like,
what the fuck is going on?

331
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:33,870
And I have to have this song down
in like a week or so. So, um,

332
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:39,470
but I got the drum room now, so
I've just been, uh, you know,

333
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:43,530
something I learned from,
uh, Mike Johnston lessons,

334
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:49,260
which was a rather than practicing
at your limit to go down 10,

335
00:19:49,261 --> 00:19:49,921
15,

336
00:19:49,921 --> 00:19:54,921
even 20 bpms and just stay there for
like 10 minutes of really focused fucking

337
00:19:56,791 --> 00:19:59,700
practice down combined and everything
shit that Davey Lynch taught me.

338
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,160
I just kind of combine everything that
makes sense. And I've been able to,

339
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:07,830
to start, you know, going
back up again and, uh,

340
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:09,210
I gotta tell you,

341
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:12,540
I don't know why the fuck I avoided
double bass drum and for so fucking long,

342
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,290
it's, it's awesome. It's incredible.

343
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:21,060
And then all of this shit that I always
loved but wouldn't even attempt to play

344
00:20:21,061 --> 00:20:24,600
along to Primus, uh, Pan Tara,

345
00:20:24,630 --> 00:20:27,240
all those p bands that I love,
um,

346
00:20:28,890 --> 00:20:30,750
all of a sudden it's just like,
oh,

347
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:34,470
I kind of understand what's
happening right here. I mean,

348
00:20:34,471 --> 00:20:37,140
I can't play it up to speed,
but it gives me somewhere to go.

349
00:20:37,141 --> 00:20:39,000
And I remember I listened to a,

350
00:20:39,630 --> 00:20:42,870
one of those lamb of God alums back in
the day and I was really fascinated with

351
00:20:42,871 --> 00:20:46,950
a lot of the, the drum beats that
I was at. Chris Adler came up.

352
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,220
And, um, I don't know, it's just,
it's like a, it's like anything,

353
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,640
it's all of a sudden there's all this
new shit that you don't know you're

354
00:20:55,641 --> 00:21:00,600
excited to sit down. I mean, if it's
like, he kind of learned what you know,

355
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:03,210
and then you just sort of sitting there,
you actually get, it's fucking weird.

356
00:21:03,211 --> 00:21:05,730
You get like bored,
um,

357
00:21:06,270 --> 00:21:08,880
and then you don't have any passion
and then you are already playing.

358
00:21:08,881 --> 00:21:13,250
It's Shitty. And then you're going to
play it even fucking worse. So, uh,

359
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:18,620
very excited about that. Um, and to
finally have a fucking drum room.

360
00:21:18,621 --> 00:21:19,101
I gotta tell you,

361
00:21:19,101 --> 00:21:23,690
I was up there fucking Waylon yesterday.

362
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,360
Not Saying I was playing well,
I was,

363
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:27,230
but I was hitting them is
fucking hard as I could.

364
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:30,910
I was having a great pouring sweat.
Just, it's like, it's fucking amazing.

365
00:21:30,911 --> 00:21:32,290
And he played double bass.
All of a sudden it's like,

366
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,960
I don't think I need to do
the elliptical today. Uh,

367
00:21:36,460 --> 00:21:38,650
that probably means my techniques sucks,

368
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:42,940
but that's the level of effort
that I was exerting. So, um,

369
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,040
what's great though is during,
if I play during the day,

370
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:52,041
my name was at work and there's always
somebody with the leaf blower or a

371
00:21:53,161 --> 00:21:56,310
fucking lawn mower plane. So I don't
think anybody's really going to hear me.

372
00:21:56,311 --> 00:21:59,310
And I think it just every day,
if just middle of the day,

373
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:04,650
I playful like 90 fucking minutes. I can
have a great time, not piss anybody off.

374
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:09,890
And, um, I dunno. And I, I think,

375
00:22:09,891 --> 00:22:13,870
I think the dream has come true. I'll
tell you another fucking dream of beef.

376
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:18,260
My goddamn fucking computer.
Come on man.

377
00:22:18,290 --> 00:22:22,250
Come back. Come back. What is the
problem? Where did you go? What happened?

378
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,210
I need to read advertising. All right. Oh,

379
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:28,220
you computer nerds out
there for some reason.

380
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:34,120
Hey De, oh, now it came back.

381
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:38,720
They wanted to like screensaver mode
and we wouldn't come back. I Dunno.

382
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,340
Why just it cause I just wrapped
it on the head like when fucking,

383
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:42,853
okay.

384
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,600
Mohammed would try to get fucking
Larry's attention here. Look, can I can,

385
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:49,570
can I just read the, the, uh, the
advertising here. I'm all over the place.

386
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,513
What did I do with it?

387
00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:53,990
Yeah.

388
00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:54,823
Yeah.
Jesus Christ.

389
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:57,540
Yeah.

390
00:22:57,540 --> 00:23:00,600
Do you see Trump just admitted that
he just completely made something up?

391
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,560
Sky like, sounds like me. You talking
about how he said that, you know,

392
00:23:04,561 --> 00:23:08,760
basically we had a trade deficit with
Canada, which I guess was not true.

393
00:23:09,270 --> 00:23:12,240
And this is when he was trying to attack
Nafta saying this is the worst deal we

394
00:23:12,241 --> 00:23:16,170
ever signed.
And evidently according to this site,

395
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:18,960
the Washington Post,
I dunno if there's psychotically liberal,

396
00:23:18,961 --> 00:23:21,750
so they're just snipping this, I'm sure
all you people on the, yeah, right.

397
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:22,970
We'll be like, oh, actually went up.

398
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,660
It was the complete opposite
and it was upon his fall. Um,

399
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,830
he said, despite having no idea
whether that was the case, he said, uh,

400
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,110
the man who racked up more than
2000 false and misleading claims,

401
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:41,130
as president said, he insisted in
to Canadian prime as well. I mean,

402
00:23:41,490 --> 00:23:45,210
I'm sure both sides would
debate that number. You know,

403
00:23:45,211 --> 00:23:49,680
one side says 2000, the other
says three, uh, as president,

404
00:23:49,681 --> 00:23:53,820
he insisted to Canadian Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau that the United States

405
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:58,821
runs a trade deficit with Canada's despite
quote having no idea whether that was

406
00:23:58,891 --> 00:24:03,390
the case. Um, he said,

407
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:07,830
I said wrong, Justin, you do.
I didn't even know Trump said,

408
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,310
I had no idea. I just said,
you're wrong. You know why?

409
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:16,560
Because we're so stupid. That's where
that guy is out of his fucking mind.

410
00:24:16,561 --> 00:24:19,650
And I know people like this,
they're just not present in United States.

411
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,210
He's admitting that he did
something wrong. And then
when he says why he did it,

412
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:27,390
he then includes how dumb
I am. It's just like, dude,

413
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,410
I didn't say this shit you did.
I'm not saying I'm not dumb.

414
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,600
That's like, you know, I've seen some,

415
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:39,630
I saw this guy get in trouble one time and
he was just going like, yeah, you know,

416
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:44,370
when you fuck up, you
know you have to, uh,

417
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:48,480
you have to come clean and own
up to it. It's like, it also,

418
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:53,190
why are you talking to me about it? I
didn't do it. You did it. I fucked up.

419
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,450
I need to come clean.

420
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,300
And he was speaking almost in like
a third person type of fucking,

421
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:00,363
that's hilarious.

422
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:01,930
Yeah.

423
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,790
That takes me back to
that fucking tee shirt.

424
00:25:03,810 --> 00:25:08,320
Enough was enough talking about enough
already talking about paying women less

425
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:12,490
than guys. It's like, fuck head, you're
a corporation. You were the one doing it,

426
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:13,324
not me.

427
00:25:14,410 --> 00:25:18,340
Now you're going to act like he never did
it and profit off what the fuck he did

428
00:25:18,341 --> 00:25:19,174
wrong.

429
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,070
It's like John Wayne Gacy having
a fucking shirt and, uh, you know,

430
00:25:26,071 --> 00:25:30,480
leave the kids alone
enough already. Right. Um,

431
00:25:30,481 --> 00:25:31,560
and then he makes money off of it,

432
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:34,550
which she then uses to pay a lawyer and
he gets out of jail before they kill him.

433
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:40,550
So anyways, uh, you know
why? Because we're so stupid.

434
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:42,140
Yeah.

435
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,390
I would have respected him more
if he just said, you know why?

436
00:25:44,930 --> 00:25:49,220
Because the average American is so
fucking stupid that all you have to do is

437
00:25:49,221 --> 00:25:51,530
just say some shit. And if you're
wearing the right colored tie,

438
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:55,280
they're going to believe it. They're
not going to research. He said that.

439
00:25:55,281 --> 00:25:58,220
Then I'd be like, yeah, I
totally agree with that.

440
00:25:58,221 --> 00:26:02,780
And that also includes people that
are at root for blue ties. Okay.

441
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:05,240
And that also includes people in,
in England and Canada.

442
00:26:05,241 --> 00:26:06,890
Everybody know nobody's
fucking paying attention.

443
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:12,140
There's very few people that
pay attention to the level debt.

444
00:26:12,141 --> 00:26:15,650
Like these talking heads on
TV who only argue one side.

445
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:20,440
And the fact that you're only arguing
one side, then at that point, I dunno,

446
00:26:20,441 --> 00:26:23,290
how do you listen to them?
That's why I like Jimmy Dore.

447
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,830
I liked Jimmy Dork because
Jimmy Dore also leans left,

448
00:26:27,831 --> 00:26:30,380
but he also trashes the
shit out of fucking Obama.

449
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:34,700
And calls him out on what a
fucking company man he was.
That guy left the office,

450
00:26:34,701 --> 00:26:38,270
he was worth over 80 million
bucks making 500 grand a year.

451
00:26:38,271 --> 00:26:41,330
And everybody's looking at him like he's
fucking Gandhi. It's just like, dude,

452
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:45,480
he's the exact same fucking guy.
Not the exact same,

453
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:46,920
but essentially it's the same thing.

454
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:51,060
He's doing the same thing that the
guy before that had the red tie.

455
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:53,760
The guy before they, the blue tie
and every eight years were like,

456
00:26:53,761 --> 00:26:58,200
it's the fucking blue ties.
We need a red tie. Um,

457
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,830
what she really needs,
you need a revolution is what you need.

458
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:05,580
You need a revolution and you would
have to literally kill the super rich if

459
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,860
you're ever going to change it.
And who's kidding? Heel. You know,

460
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:11,010
even if that's not gonna happen anymore,
I spend,

461
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:13,230
that's why they're building these robots.
Everybody know these,

462
00:27:13,231 --> 00:27:15,950
these robohelp God bill, you're
going off the deep end. Yes I am.

463
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,350
They're building these fucking robots.
That's what the fuck. It's four.

464
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:24,440
It's going to eliminate the ability to
ever a revolt because here's the thing.

465
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:28,260
Let's just say they turn this,
this country ever into a police state.

466
00:27:28,290 --> 00:27:31,680
The people that make up
our armed services service,

467
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:36,450
the brave led a web and Omega by Rob
Services. They are all Americans.

468
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:41,280
And to have them turn their guns on their
own countrymen will be very difficult.

469
00:27:41,281 --> 00:27:45,660
They would almost have to go
into a robot like state. Um,

470
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:48,340
they see what I did there.
See what I did see out all fucking,

471
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:48,990
I'll tell you right now,

472
00:27:48,990 --> 00:27:52,140
when you talk to yourself into a
microphone and there's nobody to debate or

473
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:56,880
check fact check anything you're saying,
you always stick the landing.

474
00:27:57,570 --> 00:27:59,610
You always, you always
standing there, you know,

475
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,940
fucking with the gold medal around your
neck as they play the national anthem a

476
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:08,830
you right. I fucking agree.

477
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:12,930
Where barely bar.
He made some great points.

478
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,260
That's because no one was
able to interrupt for tell
him he doesn't know what

479
00:28:18,261 --> 00:28:22,110
he's talking about. Um, all
right, well the fuck is my, uh,

480
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,230
I'm figuring out all my passwords.
I'm really turning a new corner here.

481
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:27,691
I figured out,

482
00:28:27,691 --> 00:28:32,691
finally figured out how to upload
something properly on a Dropbox without

483
00:28:33,301 --> 00:28:35,890
yelling at it. I actually just sat
down and figured it out yesterday.

484
00:28:35,891 --> 00:28:40,890
I flipped out and I fucking slammed my
computer down that because both my wife

485
00:28:40,891 --> 00:28:43,860
and my daughter to jump in. I was just
like, what am I doing? What am I doing?

486
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,890
I walked downstairs and came back
ups, you know, cooled off, came up.

487
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:49,680
I apologized to them
both, you know, this is,

488
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:51,270
this is what I'm doing
right now where I'm,

489
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:55,860
I'm like the passing the baton
of anger in my family tree. Okay.

490
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:59,220
If I continue to tradition,
I just would've done that.

491
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,800
I would've blamed everybody in
the room and never apologized.

492
00:29:01,801 --> 00:29:05,100
But now I walk away and,
um,

493
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:10,980
and I come back a few minutes later and
I apologize. I gave everybody a hug,

494
00:29:10,981 --> 00:29:14,280
a kiss in the room. That's
what I do. Okay. So, you know,

495
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:16,800
not saying I'm not still fucked up.

496
00:29:16,830 --> 00:29:19,590
I'm not saying people aren't
suffering being around me. I'm just,

497

um,

551
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:07,910
this weekend I'm going to be
up and outside of a lemon.

552
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:13,460
Landcaster Ontario with Joe Barnick,
the Rosebowl tailgate legend,

553
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,440
Joe Barton, Nick and Paul Vert. Paul. I
know everything that happens in aviation.

554
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:23,690
Versie in other words, anytime there's a
crash, he reads up on it. By the way, man.

555
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:29,060
Um,
that was a horrific helicopter crash in,

556
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,580
uh, in New York City. Of course, I've
been paying attention to that. And,

557
00:33:35,210 --> 00:33:39,080
uh, this quick footage of the guy landing
the helicopter and he looks like he

558
00:33:39,081 --> 00:33:42,710
totally, he totally fucking nailed it. Um,

559
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,430
the landing wasn't hard at all and
he got out and nobody else did.

560
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:51,410
And I think from what I'm hearing,
inner circles is a,

561
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:55,030
they will flying with doors off.
So not only did they have the seat belts,

562
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,800
which are, I think they're the, the,

563
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:01,340
the four ones that connect with the
circle in the middle, which you also,

564
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,290
you have to turn it like
clockwise or counterclockwise.

565
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,980
Cause I was thinking that they panicked.
They didn't know how to, you know, the,

566
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,950
once they land like, fuck, I'm in a
helicopter crash and then all, fuck,

567
00:34:09,951 --> 00:34:13,310
I don't want to drown. And like, I
remember I went skydiving and, um,

568
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:17,900
I did a static line jumps. So there
was nobody attached to me. And, um,

569
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:22,850
I remember it was awkward
towels, 1000, two, 1000, three,
1000, 4,000. Look, if nothing,

570
00:34:22,851 --> 00:34:24,050
look reached pulse.

571
00:34:24,051 --> 00:34:28,240
So when you pulled your emergency ripcord
you had to talk your way through it,

572
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:32,510
look to see it, reach to grab
it, pull the, pull the thing.

573
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,490
Cause other than you'd be panicking,
flailing,

574
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,920
starting to do somersaults and shit. So
I thought maybe that was it. But, um,

575
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,040
someone was saying to me that they were
possibly flying doors off and as an

576
00:34:45,561 --> 00:34:47,330
extra safety precaution,

577
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:51,190
they had them hooked to the helicopter
with one of those c clamp type of job.

578
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:54,370
He's there and there's two different
kinds. There's the one that's the,

579
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,380
the quick release.
Um,

580
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,980
and then as the extra extra
one that you screw on.

581
00:35:02,630 --> 00:35:04,430
Um, and, uh,

582
00:35:04,431 --> 00:35:07,700
they were suggesting that it was probably
that one and that even if they got

583
00:35:07,701 --> 00:35:11,600
their seatbelts on that
they were, uh, I dunno,

584
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:16,430
basically strapped to the helicopter,
went down and drowned.

585
00:35:16,490 --> 00:35:18,320
I have no idea of how
fucking horrific is that.

586
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:21,230
Why would I end the podcast on that?
I have no idea.

587
00:35:21,231 --> 00:35:24,200
And I have no fucking evidence.
That's just what's been suggested to me.

588
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,870
So anyways, on that upbeat
note, uh, listened to, uh,

589
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,900
some happy music now and then
we'll go into some greatest hits.

590
00:35:35,511 --> 00:35:37,980
I don't know why I talked to, you
know, why? Cause I fly in that made

591
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,850
me scared. Yeah.

592
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:46,070
Maybe happy to see that the guy who
fucking totally landed at like a stud and

593
00:35:46,110 --> 00:35:49,950
then, uh, if what is being suggested
happened actually happened,

594
00:35:49,951 --> 00:35:54,210
I would can imagine the pilot,
you know,

595
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,970
having to deal with those
five fucking people, you know,

596
00:35:56,971 --> 00:36:01,350
they're going to try to
fucking blame him. Um, it,

597
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,440
cause it seems like that's one of those
things where they made it so safe that

598
00:36:04,441 --> 00:36:07,770
they didn't,
they created another fucking problem,

599
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:12,420
which means they'll probably then have
some sort of new clamp that they designed.

600
00:36:12,421 --> 00:36:16,320
I don't fucking know. Anyways. Uh,
how do I talk my way out of this?

601
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:21,030
I have no idea. I'm sitting
here just flailing. All right.

602
00:36:21,031 --> 00:36:23,430
Listen to the fucking music
and have a great weekend.

603
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:25,920
You conch and there'll be another
half hour of greatest hits.

604
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:26,820
We're hopefully I don't,

605
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:29,620
and such a gloomy, no reply.

606
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:25,933
[inaudible] [inaudible]

607
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:49,840
[inaudible]

608
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,651
hey,
what's going on?

609
00:37:50,651 --> 00:37:54,100
It's bill burr and it is the
Monday morning podcast from Monday,

610
00:37:54,101 --> 00:37:57,910
March 16th, 2010. How the hell are you?

611
00:37:58,750 --> 00:38:01,960
How's it going? It's daylight savings
time. If you haven't figured it out yet.

612
00:38:02,330 --> 00:38:05,950
Do you wondering why you keep
being late for the last 24 hours?

613
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:09,850
It's actually Sunday when I'm doing
this thing because uh, you know,

614
00:38:09,851 --> 00:38:12,860
I get sick of people on the east coast.
Bitching dude.

615
00:38:13,090 --> 00:38:17,680
You could do Floki two's move fucking
Monday afternoon podcast. Should I

616
00:38:19,390 --> 00:38:21,310
um, no, I respect that.
You want to get to work?

617
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:24,760
Do you want to begin fucking off
immediately start your week off right?

618
00:38:24,761 --> 00:38:28,870
I understand. So I tape them on
Sundays now when I can and uh,

619
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,750
hope you guys all had a good weekend.
My Sunday started great.

620
00:38:31,751 --> 00:38:35,650
My dog puked on the floor after,
you know,

621
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:40,651
three days of threatening dry heaves
and every time we go out walk up the

622
00:38:41,501 --> 00:38:45,760
street, the things eating
grass like it's a goddamn cow.

623
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:50,530
And my girls always going, stop
it, stop it, stop eating the grass,

624
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:53,950
stamp it.
And a,

625
00:38:53,951 --> 00:38:57,300
I vaguely remember over
hearing someone who I hope new,

626
00:38:57,301 --> 00:39:02,301
a veterinarian who said something to
the effect that a animals eat grass when

627
00:39:02,621 --> 00:39:07,510
they're not feeling well. So last night
I was taking her out late at night,

628
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:11,380
right at that, that critical fucking
moment to scary moment, my neighborhood.

629
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:15,370
All right, there's a
moment where, uh, you know,

630
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:20,290
when you're in a bad part of the city
and there's that moment around dusk where

631
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:25,240
all the decent, hardworking, honest
people are coming in after a nice decent,

632
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:28,660
honest, hardworking days pay, you know,

633
00:39:28,690 --> 00:39:32,830
is they try to get out kind of like
a good times episode, you know?

634
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:37,780
And then there's, there's that point where
then the scumbags come out, you know,

635
00:39:38,740 --> 00:39:40,510
who are doing all kinds of illegal shit,

636
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,150
which I don't even know what the fuck
do you even think about that anymore?

637
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:47,600
Now it's just as fucked up. I was going to
say, you know, I'm just fucking crooked.

638
00:39:47,710 --> 00:39:52,510
He's, he's Goddamn banks are, you
know it was selling drugs. Yes it is.

639
00:39:52,511 --> 00:39:57,400
It is just as fucking bad. So anyways, to
stay on, I'm already off fucking track.

640
00:39:57,401 --> 00:40:00,160
You know what, my fucking
banked it to me. I walked in,

641
00:40:00,161 --> 00:40:04,510
I had this account in New York that I
kind of a little checking account that had

642
00:40:04,511 --> 00:40:06,560
a little bit of money in and
all of a sudden notice they,

643
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:10,810
we've taken some fees out. I'm like, well
that shouldn't be. So I get to New York,

644
00:40:10,811 --> 00:40:13,930
I walk in, I talked to the Douche bag
who works there and he goes, yeah,

645
00:40:14,070 --> 00:40:18,100
they've taken $27 a month out.
I don't know why that is. Here.

646
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,950
Let me check to see what's up. Click
and collect. I'll check on his thing.

647
00:40:20,951 --> 00:40:24,610
And he goes, yeah, we shouldn't have
been doing that. And I go, okay,

648
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:29,350
well can you refund the money?
And they go, absolutely. A,
and I go, well, you know,

649
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:31,600
I've had the account for like six years.

650
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,900
Can we see how long you've been
doing this? And he's like, I'm sorry,

651
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,630
are our records only go
back for four months?

652
00:40:39,130 --> 00:40:40,870
Really it only goes back for four months.

653
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:45,010
It's amazing because my bank records at
home go back the entire time I've had

654
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:46,210
the account and that's incredible.

655
00:40:46,270 --> 00:40:50,920
And I just have some piddly some in
there while you deal with hundreds of

656
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,570
millions of dollars, if not
billions, if not trillions.

657
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:54,670
I don't know what the fuck you have.

658
00:40:54,671 --> 00:40:58,300
I just know there's a fucking Bank of
yours and every God damn state now,

659
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,470
but of course it only goes back like
four months. So I go, all right,

660
00:41:02,471 --> 00:41:04,000
well what if I bring my records in?

661
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,310
I look them over and I find out
how long have you been doing it?

662
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:10,720
And they're like, Nah, he can only
refund it for four months. I'm like,

663
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,270
dude, what are you talking
about? And he goes, well,

664
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:16,380
the bank kind of looks at it like that,
that that was on you,

665
00:41:18,370 --> 00:41:18,971
woody.
And I was like,

666
00:41:18,971 --> 00:41:23,971
it's on me to not to not be like paying
attention to make sure the people who

667
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,580
are supposed to be keeping my money
safe aren't fucking stealing from me.

668
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,500
And He sorta like laughed. I'm like, dude,
this isn't funny. This is ridiculous.

669
00:41:32,501 --> 00:41:35,810
You guys just stole from me.
And if you've been doing it for six years,

670
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:39,530
what's that? 270 bucks.
Send another fucking Nav 50,

671
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,720
like almost 300 bucks
a year for six years.

672
00:41:41,721 --> 00:41:44,270
That's like 1500 to 1800
bucks somewhere in there.

673
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,340
And the guy's just sitting
there fucking laughing and uh,

674
00:41:49,430 --> 00:41:52,040
you know this a usual shit. Yeah. What
are you going to sue us? Go ahead.

675
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:54,020
We'll take some of that bail out money,

676
00:41:54,021 --> 00:41:56,190
which is part of your tax
money and we'll fucking, uh,

677
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:57,680
so I don't know what I'm going to do.

678
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:03,350
I'm going to close out the account and uh,
and I don't know,

679
00:42:03,351 --> 00:42:06,290
what do I do then I go across the street
to one of the bet for banks that are

680
00:42:06,291 --> 00:42:08,210
left.
If anybody out there is in banking,

681
00:42:08,930 --> 00:42:11,240
how do I get my money back
beyond the four months?

682
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:14,750
Cause I know that they've been
doing it longer than this. Um,

683
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:19,610
can anybody explain that? You know, this
is why people, this is why, you know,

684
00:42:19,611 --> 00:42:24,020
put 100% of your paycheck into the fucking
bag. He got to look at it this way.

685
00:42:24,021 --> 00:42:26,060
If somebody mugged you last week,

686
00:42:26,360 --> 00:42:30,800
would you walk up to the same person
and take your paycheck and stick it in

687
00:42:30,801 --> 00:42:32,840
their back pocket? You
wouldn't, would you?

688
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:38,590
But for some reason we have these
fucking bankers. Yeah, I don't know.

689
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:41,900
I think everybody should turn like,
I dunno,

690
00:42:41,901 --> 00:42:45,620
everybody should have a fucking
safe that you have buried somewhere.

691
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,480
Everybody's got a gun in. Anybody
can blow anybody away. I know.

692
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:51,620
It's all fucked up.

693
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,810
Fucking assholes guys sitting
there fucking smiling.

694
00:42:55,811 --> 00:42:58,250
You know when he's sitting there doing,
he's doing that little twirly thing.

695
00:42:58,251 --> 00:43:02,420
You know that math people do with their
pens and people were into finances.

696
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:04,610
I think they do it to
hypnotize you and says,

697
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:08,030
the guy's fucking sit there telling me
that they'd been stealing 30 bucks a

698
00:43:08,031 --> 00:43:11,000
month from me and all I'm doing
is I'm trying to focus on him.

699
00:43:11,001 --> 00:43:15,230
I keep looking down at his silver
shiny pen, some sort of mind trick.

700
00:43:15,590 --> 00:43:18,380
Fortunately, I was aware
of it. I'm going to say,

701
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:20,030
can you stop twirling your fucking pen?

702
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:22,400
But I didn't want to do that cause
I was trying to keep my cool,

703
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,660
which obviously is a difficult
thing for me to do, you know?

704
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:28,070
I don't know right now a bill.

705
00:43:28,071 --> 00:43:32,390
It's just 27 bucks a month times how
many fucking people you remember superman

706
00:43:32,391 --> 00:43:35,690
three when Richard Pryor stole half a
cent from everybody in the next day had a

707
00:43:35,691 --> 00:43:37,130
fucking Ferrari.

708
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,170
These fucks are taken 27 bucks a month
from everybody. I'm convinced of it.

709
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:45,860
It's the fucking mob.

710
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:49,490
I swear to God the mob went legit
or those there will be blood guys.

711
00:43:49,610 --> 00:43:51,700
They're the fucking assholes
and run the Goddamn bags.

712
00:43:51,710 --> 00:43:54,500
He's fucking concert just stealing
from me and there's nobody getting,

713
00:43:54,501 --> 00:43:56,390
nobody's going to help me.
What am I going to go down there?

714
00:43:56,690 --> 00:44:00,710
I'm going to get that guy used to be
on the fucking, uh, leave it to beaver.

715
00:44:00,711 --> 00:44:05,150
What the fuck was it? Even that show
a Mayberry. I always hated that show,

716
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:08,830
that old content walking around with
their falsetto voice. [inaudible]

717
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:14,930
you know, you know what that show
lacked somebody that I wanted to bang.

718
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:22,220
That's why I didn't watch it.
There was nobody fuckable on it.

719
00:44:22,221 --> 00:44:25,820
That was the brilliance of the
monsters that they were like,

720
00:44:25,821 --> 00:44:26,840
this is going to be hilarious.

721
00:44:26,841 --> 00:44:30,380
We're going to turn fucking Frankenstein
into drag and Dracula into these Kooky

722
00:44:30,381 --> 00:44:32,940
characters and it's all going to be funny.

723
00:44:32,941 --> 00:44:37,941
But they knew at the end of the day
there had to be somebody that the male

724
00:44:38,551 --> 00:44:40,350
demographic would want to fuck.

725
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,380
So they came up with that
girl who was allegedly ugly.

726
00:44:43,381 --> 00:44:45,150
Why am I explaining this classic show?

727
00:44:45,151 --> 00:44:50,151
You know the deal and she looked like
Marilyn Monroe and that's what kept me in

728
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,820
there. I Dunno, right?

729
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,740
Batman after a while,

730
00:44:55,741 --> 00:45:00,360
it's like to what is going on with
this 40 year old guy in his ward?

731
00:45:01,770 --> 00:45:06,380
And then all of a sudden they had cat
woman walking around that fucking hoary

732
00:45:06,390 --> 00:45:08,580
outfit.
Is she the one who started that shit?

733
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:12,030
Did women not dress like whores on uh,

734
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:17,480
on Halloween before Batman
are a bad girl or Catwoman?

735
00:45:19,110 --> 00:45:23,820
Catwoman was a bad one, right?
There's such pathetic cons,

736
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:27,510
you know what I mean? It's, we take
off that fucking ridiculous outfit.

737
00:45:28,950 --> 00:45:31,200
Go stand behind a wall and,
and,

738
00:45:31,290 --> 00:45:34,350
and start talking to people and listen
to how many people even fucking pay

739
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:37,020
attention to you.
They don't cause you got nothing to say.

740
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:42,140
All you can do is just dress up your
goddamn twat and starts strutting around

741
00:45:42,331 --> 00:45:46,110
the fucking place that had
nothing to do with cat.

742
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,180
Woman had nothing to do with her head.
Do with me.

743
00:45:48,181 --> 00:45:51,750
Fucking get fucked over by
that Goddamn bag. Assholes,

744
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:55,170
fucking assholes.
And I go to go down there.

745
00:45:55,410 --> 00:45:59,970
I got to go down to lake like some
fucking guy who's button store just failed

746
00:45:59,971 --> 00:46:03,450
after 75 years.
You know,

747
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:06,930
Frankie fish face and sons.
Remember those fucking, um,

748
00:46:07,050 --> 00:46:11,940
those businesses when you were a kid, it
was always something, something in sons,

749
00:46:13,410 --> 00:46:16,920
you know, and like a lot of the times
the kids were forced into the business.

750
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,780
You know, some Italian guy, he opens a
fucking prosciutto shop and then that's,

751
00:46:22,010 --> 00:46:24,270
it's like an arranged
marriage except it's your job.

752
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:26,240
Then you got to show
up and be [inaudible].

753
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:29,820
I have been working in the restaurants
and that was a da Da Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah.

754
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:30,481
Did that,
you know,

755
00:46:30,481 --> 00:46:34,170
they don't know shit about anything else
because everybody wanted to strike out

756
00:46:34,171 --> 00:46:36,450
on their own.
And now look,

757
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:39,730
everybody ends up in a fucking cubicle
worker for these fucking cops who are

758
00:46:39,731 --> 00:46:42,900
stealing my money. That's
uplifting isn't it? Um, anyways,

759
00:46:42,950 --> 00:46:45,720
this is the money morning
podcast and it's on my website.

760
00:46:45,721 --> 00:46:48,960
I'm trying to get it onto iTunes.
I'm in between web guys right now.

761
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:53,880
Hopefully this is up on iTunes.
We worked on it yesterday. Um,

762
00:46:54,570 --> 00:46:57,900
you know, and it was weird. It
was up on my web guys computer,

763
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,640
but it wasn't up on my computer.

764
00:46:59,641 --> 00:47:04,100
So if you're listening to this on
my website, maybe you go to Itunes,

765
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:08,880
you just hold down the shift button. I
mean maybe iTunes just keeps reloading a,

766
00:47:08,881 --> 00:47:11,850
you know,
it remembers a page that you've been to.

767
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:15,660
So when you go back to it a load quicker,
hold down the shift button.

768
00:47:15,661 --> 00:47:19,930
When you're on that page, um, I believe
that. Then you can see the new ones.

769
00:47:19,931 --> 00:47:24,390
So now I have three podcasts.
It's fucking ridiculous,

770
00:47:24,391 --> 00:47:26,280
but eventually we're going
to get it all under one.

771
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:30,520
This is the first time I've ever had a
web guy who lives down the from me. Um,

772
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:35,140
I have new video up on my
website and buy new video.

773
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:39,040
I mean video that actually works.
And um,

774
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:43,120
this is part of a whole new revamping
that I've tried to do like 10 times.

775
00:47:43,121 --> 00:47:45,670
I know I've always promised that, but, um,

776
00:47:45,710 --> 00:47:50,440
I'm going to be uploading video to my
website and we start video my video taping

777
00:47:50,441 --> 00:47:54,010
myself out on the road, putting up little
bullshit things up there. You know,

778
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:57,310
the usual bullshit give you guys
a couple of crumbs every week.

779
00:47:57,311 --> 00:48:00,490
So you still give a fuck about me.
So when I come to your town,

780
00:48:00,491 --> 00:48:05,470
maybe you'll buy a ticket for you and your
best little girl or fucking boyfriend,

781
00:48:05,471 --> 00:48:08,830
whatever you got going on out there,
whatever it is that you do. Um,

782
00:48:08,831 --> 00:48:12,180
there's also a, a fan page for the
Monday morning podcast. Now, uh,

783
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:17,050
www.themmpodcast.com.
Uh,

784
00:48:17,051 --> 00:48:20,650
there's questions, there's pictures.
I make references to fucked up stuff.

785
00:48:20,651 --> 00:48:22,090
Like say you haven't watched the monsters.

786
00:48:22,090 --> 00:48:26,050
Maybe there'll be a picture of the
hardy on the monsters, you know,

787
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:30,670
so, uh, and that's it.

788
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,270
My girlfriend just walked in and then
tippy toed back out again and then

789
00:48:34,271 --> 00:48:38,500
shrugged her shoulders. Like I wasn't
going to address it. You heard me,

790
00:48:38,501 --> 00:48:40,150
I was in a lull.
So anyways,

791
00:48:40,151 --> 00:48:45,151
I really apologize for the horror that
has been trying to find my podcast over

792
00:48:45,221 --> 00:48:48,370
the last month or so.
Um,

793
00:48:49,420 --> 00:48:53,320
I didn't think that it was going
to be such a big deal, you know?

794
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:59,380
Uh, I, I just thought I could just
switch over to a new server, a server,

795
00:48:59,381 --> 00:49:04,090
and it wasn't going to be a problem. But
evidently it's this major fucking deal.

796
00:49:04,091 --> 00:49:07,000
And I've talked to other podcasters out
there and they were talking about what a

797
00:49:07,001 --> 00:49:11,650
fucking pain in the ass it is to get it
up on iTunes because once you do get it

798
00:49:11,651 --> 00:49:16,510
up on iTunes, then they have to
approve of it as if to say yes,

799
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:20,680
this is in fact a podcast and
beyond that we approve of it.

800
00:49:21,910 --> 00:49:25,870
So anyways, Jesus Christ, it's
already one in the afternoon.

801
00:49:26,530 --> 00:49:29,680
I just went out to brunch with my lovely
girlfriend and I heard some fucking,

802
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:32,980
oh my God, that goes back to my joke.
You really go to a branch. Do you,

803
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:38,080
did somebody have test? Um, yeah,

804
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:41,650
I went down to this fucking place and
we're hanging out down there and uh,

805
00:49:43,270 --> 00:49:46,780
this fucking dude, um, I
don't know if he was gay,

806
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:49,930
but he had the gay accent,
which is always fun to me.

807
00:49:49,931 --> 00:49:51,820
Like there's a part of the
country that they're from,

808
00:49:52,150 --> 00:49:54,670
which is an old joke that I used to do.
Um,

809
00:49:54,730 --> 00:49:58,630
he was talking about daylight savings
times. He was just like, oh my God. Like,

810
00:49:58,631 --> 00:50:02,150
this is how it should be all the time.
You know, it's like, this is Los Angela,

811
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:07,360
this whole getting out of work at
five and it's dark out. It's like,

812
00:50:07,361 --> 00:50:11,290
what is going on with that?
That's like one of those things ever.

813
00:50:11,291 --> 00:50:12,340
Just hear somebody like that.

814
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:15,140
They're like such a fucking cliche
that whoever you're with, you just,

815
00:50:15,310 --> 00:50:17,110
you're just sort of
staring down at your food.

816
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:20,830
And then when you look at the person that
you're with, you don't move your head.

817
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:25,120
You just slowly look up at each other
and then all of a sudden it's like you're

818
00:50:25,121 --> 00:50:27,380
in grade school again.
And there was a teacher said,

819
00:50:27,381 --> 00:50:29,840
the next person who fucking
laughs is getting detention.

820
00:50:30,410 --> 00:50:32,180
It's one of those moments.
It was tight quarters,

821
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:36,220
so we couldn't like really
start laughing at them. But um,

822
00:50:37,490 --> 00:50:39,140
I really wanted to lean over and be like,
you know,

823
00:50:39,141 --> 00:50:43,160
part of the reason why it's so fucking
dark out during the winter time is the

824
00:50:43,161 --> 00:50:47,960
whole planet. The northern
hemisphere tilts away from
the sun. They're fuck face.

825
00:50:48,360 --> 00:50:52,220
All right. So even in December, it
would probably be dark around five.

826
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,740
Despite the time change.
Actually maybe it wouldn't.

827
00:50:54,741 --> 00:50:59,420
Maybe more like five 45 30
depending on where you're at. Right?

828
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:03,230
I mean, am I ignorant? Of course
I am, but as far as I know,

829
00:51:03,231 --> 00:51:06,320
daylight savings is the bullshit time.

830
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,310
Like right now it's not
really one o'clock. We're
just saying it's one o'clock.

831
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:15,610
So the farm hands out in the Midwest can
have more fucking time to harvest the,

832
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:20,720
the beans made out of corn products.
Cory to Food Inc right?

833
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,940
I don't know. Fucking know. I have no
idea where they do it. I just fucking

834
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:29,061
why do I have to,

835
00:51:29,061 --> 00:51:31,460
I every week I talk about shit that
I don't know anything about it.

836
00:51:31,461 --> 00:51:33,640
And it's the funniest
shit. Like I, I go into it,

837
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:36,620
I start getting anxiety cause I know
I don't know what I'm talking about.

838
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:39,530
So why would I literally try to
do is I try to use like momentum.

839
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:44,360
Like maybe if I say something dumb
quickly, no one's gonna notice.

840
00:51:44,361 --> 00:51:48,080
I believe that that's exactly what
it is in my world. That made sense.

841
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:50,600
So onto today's topics.

842
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:54,760
I was all excited to wake up this
morning and watch the Chicago Blackhawks

843
00:51:54,770 --> 00:51:59,300
against the Washington capitals.
Why may you ask? I'll tell you why.

844
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:02,000
Because I love the sport of hockey and a,

845
00:52:02,001 --> 00:52:05,240
it's a good chance that those two teams
could possibly meet in the finals,

846
00:52:05,270 --> 00:52:09,860
if not in the finals next year.
The two teams that are right there.

847
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:14,240
All right? And everybody always
bitches out. Oh, hockey sticks.

848
00:52:14,241 --> 00:52:15,620
And they always blame the fighting.

849
00:52:15,621 --> 00:52:19,040
They got to get the fighting out
of the fucking game. All right?

850
00:52:19,041 --> 00:52:20,620
That's why nobody watches it.
Well,

851
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:24,320
I'm going to give you an example of the
NHL here. This is what they do today.

852
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,940
Okay?
During the week,

853
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:30,110
my Bruins played the
Pittsburgh Penguins and uh,

854
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:34,100
overall Pittsburgh's a decent franchise
for spectacle. I respect them,

855
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:38,570
but they always say, seem to have one
douche bag on the team. The off Samuelson,

856
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:43,310
you know, the guy who just can't
fucking play, you know, he can't play,

857
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,630
he can't fucking fight.

858
00:52:44,750 --> 00:52:48,620
He can't even just skate around and
annoy you like a Ken Lindeman back in the

859
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:52,040
day. So what he does is he goes out there
and he basically tries to end people's

860
00:52:52,041 --> 00:52:55,520
careers or their seasons and that's
what he did to mark survivor.

861
00:52:55,521 --> 00:52:58,520
I even know the fucking guys name and
I don't even want to know his neck,

862
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:02,330
kind of like somebody goes up and
shoots up a fucking mall so they can get

863
00:53:02,331 --> 00:53:04,580
famous. I always make sure I
don't remember their fucking name,

864
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:07,040
even though the news can't
stop talking about him.

865
00:53:07,041 --> 00:53:12,041
So this fucking cunt just basically
glides in after survivor took shot.

866
00:53:12,590 --> 00:53:17,090
Granted, if he hit his body, it's, it's
illegal hip, but he didn't, he took,

867
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:21,110
he took his shoulder slash elbow and just
blasted and right in the fucking head

868
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:24,760
and he so only connected
with his head that survived,

869
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:28,140
literally helicoptered around
and landed down on the ice.

870
00:53:28,141 --> 00:53:32,820
And not only was he not suspended or
find that there wasn't even a penalty.

871
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:36,030
I don't know what it is about
the penguins for some reason,

872
00:53:36,031 --> 00:53:40,560
they always have that one goon who can
go in and just blow out Cam Neely fucking

873
00:53:40,561 --> 00:53:44,550
knee and end his career. That guy
just ended [inaudible] fucking season.

874
00:53:44,670 --> 00:53:48,150
Our one goal scorer and
they then they do nothing.

875
00:53:49,830 --> 00:53:52,820
Told the whole hockey world is
flipping out like, dude, what the fuck?

876
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,870
So what do they do to make it up today?

877
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:02,140
Washington capitals versus Chicago
Blackhawks there one nationally televised

878
00:54:02,211 --> 00:54:06,050
game this week on NBC can
actually watch it in HD TV.

879
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,290
So while you fucking idiots out
there who can't see the Puck,

880
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,200
I can't fear where is it?
I can't see it.

881
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:17,090
Fucking black object against a white
surface. Can't fucking see it. Why don't,

882
00:54:17,091 --> 00:54:21,050
why don't you start with looking at the
guy that everybody appears to be mad at

883
00:54:21,770 --> 00:54:25,100
on the other team? You
know, start with that guy.

884
00:54:25,130 --> 00:54:29,300
Maybe that's the guy who has the
object that they desire. So anyways,

885
00:54:29,301 --> 00:54:32,050
you know what they do?
They end up kicking fucking Ovechkin.

886
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:36,060
They gave him a game misconduct out of
the game because he did some half hour.

887
00:54:36,061 --> 00:54:40,610
I mean it was a check that deserved a
penalty, possibly a fucking double minor.

888
00:54:40,730 --> 00:54:43,880
And they kicked the best player in the
league out of the fucking game on their

889
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:45,890
national telecast.
And I'm a tell you right now people,

890
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:51,100
that is why that is why nobody watches
hockey because they continually make

891
00:54:51,350 --> 00:54:52,430
moves like that.

892
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:57,700
I don't know why every five years they
get back on ESPN and then they go,

893
00:54:57,990 --> 00:55:01,750
whoa, wait a minute. The USA
network is offering us $5 more,

894
00:55:01,790 --> 00:55:03,960
or let's go over there.
Let's go over to the versus network.

895
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:08,650
How many people you think
would be watching the NFL
if throughout the years they

896
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:09,450
, they, you know,

897
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:13,680
they occasionally for three years we're
disappear onto like the learning channel.

898
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:17,070
You know what I mean? It really has
nothing to do with the fighting.

899
00:55:17,190 --> 00:55:21,600
It's such a stupid fucking comment
that people make and it's hypocritical.

900
00:55:21,690 --> 00:55:25,800
If you truly feel that that fighting
should be out of that game as much as the

901
00:55:25,801 --> 00:55:28,890
whole world enjoys violence.
We love violence.

902
00:55:28,891 --> 00:55:32,040
Go on Youtube and look at the
fucking ones that get the most hits.

903
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,660
We like to laugh and we'd like
to watch somebody get fucked up.

904
00:55:35,660 --> 00:55:38,240
That's what I've learned
from going onto youtube.

905
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:43,270
Oh and people will find a way to talk
politics or discuss race on any video that

906
00:55:45,411 --> 00:55:49,640
you stick up there. And
speaking of that, um, dude,

907
00:55:49,641 --> 00:55:50,660
I was so fucking bummed out.

908
00:55:50,661 --> 00:55:54,230
I woke up an hour late so I missed the
first period and then I find out a veggie

909
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:57,860
skin isn't even fucking plague and it
was laying on the next thing you know,

910
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:01,300
they Chicago scores, it's three nothing
and the game is basically over for the,

911
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:05,280
or for those of you who don't watch
hockey three, nothing is basically, uh,

912
00:56:05,281 --> 00:56:10,281
I would say it's like being down 17
points and football are taught yeah,

913
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:15,130
Po sometimes 21, depending on how
bad your fucking team is. So, um,

914
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,990
I was upset as a hockey fan.

915
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:20,530
I still love the Nhl and I still
think you guys should watch the game.

916
00:56:20,770 --> 00:56:23,560
I was actually watching a little bit of
the Premier League because I'm going to

917
00:56:23,561 --> 00:56:27,910
Europe this week and uh,
the excitement of that has finally hit me.

918
00:56:28,420 --> 00:56:31,060
I'm not excited about the
17 hour or whatever it is,

919
00:56:31,061 --> 00:56:33,850
15 hour flight from Los Angeles.
But um,

920
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,850
I'm beyond excited to go over there.

921
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:41,880
And have killer shows and to begin to
build a following over there because a

922
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:43,443
cause,
why not?

923
00:56:43,630 --> 00:56:46,870
Because you only go around once and I
was going to get a tour of the fucking

924
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:50,950
Abbey road studios and that fell through.
So now I don't know what to do.

925
00:56:51,670 --> 00:56:53,020
I don't know what to do over there.

926
00:56:53,021 --> 00:56:56,680
And for those of you who
haven't been on my website,

927
00:56:58,270 --> 00:56:59,260
um, this week, uh,

928
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:04,320
on Thursday I am playing at
the Lester theatre in London,

929
00:57:04,811 --> 00:57:07,060
England.
How fucking cool does that sound?

930
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:10,120
Then I'm playing the sugar club in a,

931
00:57:10,330 --> 00:57:13,720
in a Dublin Ireland on Friday.

932
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:16,990
And then the next night I go to Glasgow,
Scotland,

933
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:18,840
lots of new Americans like me.

934
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,510
We're going to want to say glass gow cause
it looks like it's written like slow,

935
00:57:23,530 --> 00:57:27,460
you know, low, but it's gow
glass. Gow uh, Scotland.

936
00:57:27,461 --> 00:57:30,070
And I actually don't even know the fucking
name of the theater and playing there,

937
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:34,960
but uh, it's going to be awesome.
And I am coming off the wagon.

938
00:57:36,070 --> 00:57:38,890
My Good Buddy Joe to
Rosa went 70 days sober,

939
00:57:38,891 --> 00:57:41,470
so I had to beat him because
I'm a competitive fuck.

940
00:57:41,890 --> 00:57:45,670
And I was going to take myself off
last night. It's 71 days, you know,

941
00:57:45,671 --> 00:57:50,170
kind of like a nod to Roger Maris.
60 home runs 61 70 71.

942
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:54,640
But uh, I decided fuck it. You know, if
I'm going to fall off the fucking wagon,

943
00:57:54,641 --> 00:57:59,440
it's going to be in a pub in London,
England. That's what I'm going to do it.

944
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,000
So I need you English people to tell me
where there's a good pub and by a good

945
00:58:04,001 --> 00:58:04,690
pub.

946
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:09,130
I don't mean some loud fucking bar
with a bunch of douchebags in it,

947
00:58:09,131 --> 00:58:12,100
trying to act like they're cooler than
they really are. I want some fucking,

948
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:14,410
I want some place I could walk
in that's a little bit quieter,

949
00:58:14,411 --> 00:58:16,990
but I'm not going to get the shit kicked
out of me once they realize that I'm an

950
00:58:16,991 --> 00:58:19,570
American. Okay. I need to know that.

951
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:24,430
I also need to know if I bring DVDs over
there to sell to you guys for pounds,

952
00:58:24,431 --> 00:58:26,590
euros, whatever the fuck
you're on. I believe you guys,

953
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:31,480
you guys have an accepted the euro, but
I think Ireland has, um, I need to know,

954
00:58:31,890 --> 00:58:36,160
did DVDs play the American code version?

955
00:58:36,161 --> 00:58:39,400
Whatever the fucking technical term is,
do those things play over there?

956
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:41,620
Are they formatted correctly?

957
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:44,620
Cause I don't want to go over there
and sell you guys a bunch of shit that

958
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,530
doesn't work. And then
we got gotta, you know,

959
00:58:47,531 --> 00:58:49,720
then I'm like a bank and then I
gotta be like, well, you know,

960
00:58:49,721 --> 00:58:51,220
that's really on you.
You know,

961
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:53,710
she should have realized that
I was from America and uh,

962
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:58,450
I have a different fucking DVD system
than you do. So there you go. My, sorry,

963
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:00,520
my records only go back four minutes.

964
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:04,150
I really don't have any recollection
of going over there. So anyways,

965
00:59:04,151 --> 00:59:07,660
I don't know what else to do over
there. John Bonham's grave, you know,

966
00:59:07,690 --> 00:59:10,120
maybe I'll go see that.
Um,

967
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:15,970
what else could I do? I don't
want to go do that. Do She?

968
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:18,310
Shit guy glow look big Ben and parliament.

969
00:59:18,311 --> 00:59:21,650
I don't wanna I don't wanna
look at that stuff. I want, uh,

970
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:23,871
I don't want,
I want to do,

971
00:59:23,871 --> 00:59:26,330
I don't want to walk around and
want to look at similar who is,

972
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:30,170
I want to do what? People in
London, England do that right.

973
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,370
That's what I want to do.

974
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:36,170
Which is what eat Indian food right
after a plate full of fish and chips.

975
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:39,350
Um, I dunno what the fuck
you guys do over there,

976
00:59:39,351 --> 00:59:42,030
but if you could tell me some stuff
to do. I know stone chat, Stonehenge,

977
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,850
I've talked to enough Americans
who've gone over there.

978
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:47,000
It's basically sitting on the side
of the road like a fucking Starbucks.

979
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:50,750
It's very underwhelming. Um,
whenever they film it there,

980
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:53,780
they're real close and they make sure
that they don't have the highway like 10

981
00:59:53,781 --> 00:59:56,250
feet away from the fucking thing.
I'm,

982
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,630
I can't wait for somebody to fall asleep
at the wheel and just drive right into

983
00:59:59,631 --> 01:00:00,830
that thing.
That's going to be hilarious.

984
01:00:04,490 --> 01:00:06,980
So anyways,
this is the podcast this week.

985
01:00:06,981 --> 01:00:10,370
I've been kind of Cunty the last couple of
weeks. I've been in a bad move, but, uh,

986
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:13,070
I'm in a much better
mood this week, so, uh,

987
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:17,150
I don't know if that'll make this less
funnier or more tolerable. It's up to you.

988
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:21,100
So here's some youtube videos.
Speaking of England, uh,

989
01:00:21,140 --> 01:00:23,780
this is my nod to,
uh,

990
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:28,220
just something I discovered
a few years ago, um,

991
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:31,430
through this comedian Jordan Rubin.
I was the one on his myspace page.

992
01:00:31,460 --> 01:00:35,630
Remember that? Remember my
space, I was the last one. Um,

993
01:00:35,660 --> 01:00:38,760
he had a clip of this on his page and I
actually checked it out. It's called a,

994
01:00:38,761 --> 01:00:43,700
the Prince of Wales. And, uh,
it's actually spelled w, h a.

995
01:00:43,701 --> 01:00:45,860
L e s, like the, uh,

996
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:50,900
the mammal and a, it's called
Derek and Clive, d. E r.

997
01:00:51,830 --> 01:00:56,690
E. C. O, sorry, d. E r. E. K.
And Clive Cli. V. E. All right.

998
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:59,480
And it's actually Dudley
Moore in this guy, Peter Cook,

999
01:00:59,481 --> 01:01:03,290
who most Americans have
never heard of. And, um,

1000
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:07,790
that's basically just imagine if I was
doing a podcast with some other asshole,

1001
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:12,980
but 30 years ago and it's just them
going off on stuff and they made,

1002
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:15,410
when you watch the clip,
it stem, I believe,

1003
01:01:15,411 --> 01:01:20,060
recording the album and it was just the
most filthy as shit and offensive stuff

1004
01:01:20,061 --> 01:01:23,000
that they could come up. They talk
about religion, they a lot of stuff,

1005
01:01:23,660 --> 01:01:26,750
a lot of stuff that actually, I was
watching it and I was like, Jesus Christ,

1006
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:29,120
this is a,
this is like the original podcast.

1007
01:01:29,390 --> 01:01:33,900
It's completely over the top and a,
I guess, you know, it's Dudley Moore,

1008
01:01:34,100 --> 01:01:37,430
Peter Cook,
and I guess they was supposed to be a,

1009
01:01:37,490 --> 01:01:40,040
I don't know what they were supposed
to be mean. I don't live over there,

1010
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:42,260
so obviously, so I don't know
who they're supposed to be.

1011
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:47,180
I'm just imagining it's just a couple
of cans cabin. I can sit in a bar.

1012
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:50,270
I don't know what, but it's fucking
hilarious to me and I hope you enjoy it.

1013
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,850
All right. I have also,
by the way, I have a nice,

1014
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:56,570
I have a nice variety of youtube videos.
So if you're not under the comedy thing,

1015
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:01,610
if you want to see a beautiful woman with
the most killer body I've ever seen in

1016
01:02:01,611 --> 01:02:02,540
my fucking life,

1017
01:02:02,541 --> 01:02:07,541
and an accent to match it and her hair
done up and fucking pony tails as she

1018
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:12,770
works out, look up fitness, uh,

1019
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:18,010
killer five 50 rep workout fitness
dash killer five 50 workout.

1020
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,730
Uh, I can't remember the name
of the girl. She's ridiculous.

1021
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:26,670
And she does this insane workout.
She's in shape,

1022
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:28,320
I believe her titties or natural,

1023
01:02:28,350 --> 01:02:31,740
unless you went to Dallas and got those
teardrop fucking fake ones that I saw

1024
01:02:31,741 --> 01:02:35,640
out there. Um, and she just works
out and she looks unbelievable.

1025
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,430
And as she gets further into this set,
she starts going like,

1026
01:02:42,930 --> 01:02:46,740
it's fucking awesome. I'm at a
comedian, you should check out,

1027
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:50,970
check out our Reggie watts,
Regg IEE, watts, w a t t.

1028
01:02:50,971 --> 01:02:54,750
S a lot of the shitty puts up. There was
this musical stuff that he does, I think,

1029
01:02:54,751 --> 01:02:57,690
because he doesn't want to burn
as material like most comedians.

1030
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:01,170
But if you get a chance to see that guy,
they go recommended a video and a,

1031
01:03:01,510 --> 01:03:06,330
and a comedian. Um, those are all on
youtube. And here's the last video.

1032
01:03:06,331 --> 01:03:07,590
I will recommend this something,

1033
01:03:07,591 --> 01:03:12,420
a break.com and there's something
called the tree terminator.

1034
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:14,563
And uh,

1035
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:20,570
it's just one of those
machines that you're going to
see that it just shows that

1036
01:03:20,571 --> 01:03:22,680
human beings were just too fucking slow.

1037
01:03:22,730 --> 01:03:25,220
Mark for our own goddamn good.

1038
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:30,010
Basically this machine, for those of
you who are on a treadmill right now,

1039
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:34,110
it just,
it has like a big hand.

1040
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:38,520
I don't know what it is. It, it
just, it looks like a backhaul,

1041
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:41,510
but it's really like a hand in,
it just grabs these trees,

1042
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:47,310
pulls them right out of the ground and
then it like, imagine if like, okay, you,

1043
01:03:47,311 --> 01:03:49,660
you fucking, you threw a Jab, right?

1044
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:53,370
Do that right now in your cubicle several
and thinks you're fucking insane and

1045
01:03:53,460 --> 01:03:55,680
they're just waiting and have a fist
so they don't think you're fucking

1046
01:03:55,681 --> 01:04:00,570
listening to a Hitler video. Um, stick.

1047
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,910
Yes. Sticking out there like you're
about ready to salute Hitler,

1048
01:04:02,911 --> 01:04:04,920
but have a fist so you
don't offend anybody.

1049
01:04:05,190 --> 01:04:10,190
And then just imagine if if your arm right
down to your wrist wouldn't move yet.

1050
01:04:11,221 --> 01:04:13,960
Your fucking hand could do
an entire fucking ThreeSixty.

1051
01:04:14,430 --> 01:04:15,720
That's what this device does,

1052
01:04:15,721 --> 01:04:19,650
except you're holding a tree and
then what it does is it fucking,

1053
01:04:19,651 --> 01:04:21,990
some are holds the tree in place with,

1054
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:27,180
I don't know what some device in there
and then it loosens its grip and it goes

1055
01:04:27,181 --> 01:04:30,420
up and down the tree.
Like it's Jackin off horizontally.

1056
01:04:30,421 --> 01:04:33,450
But what it's really doing is removing
all the branches and the leaves.

1057
01:04:33,840 --> 01:04:38,840
So then all you're left with is the
fucking is the trunk with the Barksdale on

1058
01:04:39,161 --> 01:04:43,090
it. It gives it another fucking
Jack and now it's you know,

1059
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:48,240
back and forth a few times now all it
is is just as rounds spool of a of wood

1060
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,810
and then add, it doesn't stop there.
Then it goes all the way down to the,

1061
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:58,700
I guess where the balls would be.
Right? It's very fucking a phallic here.

1062
01:04:59,060 --> 01:05:00,740
And then what it starts
where the weather at,

1063
01:05:00,741 --> 01:05:04,640
the base of the shaft goes up
about three and then tramp.

1064
01:05:05,850 --> 01:05:09,000
That was supposed to be at
slicing and half. I really
fucking blew it on that. Uh,

1065
01:05:10,320 --> 01:05:12,860
that was the worst sound effect ever.
Clamp.

1066
01:05:12,930 --> 01:05:14,910
That's not what it doesn't want to show.
That's what it did.

1067
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:17,530
That's the right sound effects.
See no Michael Winslow here this week

1068
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:22,180
and the edge just in sections, like
little fucking six foot sections of wood.

1069
01:05:22,210 --> 01:05:26,290
And I'm telling you it can do it.
One tree every like 20 seconds.

1070
01:05:26,830 --> 01:05:28,270
And this guy is just a one mic.

1071
01:05:28,271 --> 01:05:32,290
One guy with the machine is just basically
going through this forest so we can

1072
01:05:32,291 --> 01:05:36,130
all have baseball bats. I Dunno what,
just you know, button amount of time.

1073
01:05:36,131 --> 01:05:39,460
It took me to fucking explain that. You
could have looked it up and watched it.

1074
01:05:39,490 --> 01:05:43,240
I'm such an idiot. All right. What am
I got to hear? What's coming up next?

1075
01:05:43,241 --> 01:05:45,670
What's the next subject here on
the Monday morning podcast? Oh,

1076
01:05:45,671 --> 01:05:49,420
here's something that's called,
let's get smart is an explanation.

1077
01:05:49,510 --> 01:05:51,670
Ex explanation point.

1078
01:05:53,020 --> 01:05:56,320
I'm desperately trying to become a,
uh,

1079
01:05:57,460 --> 01:06:00,730
the smartest moron that I
can become an I've actually

1080
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:05,080
through that lumosity.com on
becoming a better speller.

1081
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:07,450
And these are some of the
words that I've been, Toronto,

1082
01:06:07,510 --> 01:06:09,640
one of the Games I've been
trying to come up with,

1083
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:12,460
but I don't know how to
spell them. So then I, uh,

1084
01:06:13,150 --> 01:06:17,770
I just write them down and I give myself
spelling test, aesthetic aggressive,

1085
01:06:18,370 --> 01:06:23,320
alleged bizarre Catamaran, cantaloupe,
catalyst, catalyst, chloroform,

1086
01:06:23,600 --> 01:06:28,420
disingenuous, facetious. You
know, you know what's great about,

1087
01:06:28,421 --> 01:06:30,130
these are all words that
you can use in print,

1088
01:06:30,131 --> 01:06:34,780
but if you actually use them a while
speaking, you come off like a douchebag,

1089
01:06:35,020 --> 01:06:37,930
at least in the circle of people
that, um, I'm hanging out,

1090
01:06:38,460 --> 01:06:41,200
like hanging out with that can't
use the word infrastructure.

1091
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:46,990
Can I use the word melancholy?
Huh? Anybody else spelled
melancholies to spell it?

1092
01:06:46,991 --> 01:06:51,310
M. E. L. L. O. N. K.
O. L. L. Y. Like I did,

1093
01:06:52,230 --> 01:06:55,390
I wasn't that bad, but it was
pretty brutal. Like succinct.

1094
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,990
I was playing this game and,
uh, you have to do that.

1095
01:06:58,991 --> 01:07:01,630
Like when you're texting and you
come up with a word that you,

1096
01:07:01,631 --> 01:07:02,800
so can't even spell,

1097
01:07:02,801 --> 01:07:07,510
like your brain literally locks
in like succinct. I was like,

1098
01:07:07,511 --> 01:07:08,890
how the fuck do you spell this?

1099
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:13,030
Saw as a

1100
01:07:15,460 --> 01:07:16,450
sinked is that like sync?

1101
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:21,480
Like you brush your teeth
as I n k e d you know,

1102
01:07:21,521 --> 01:07:26,230
the past tense of sync sync
or like sync something up cyc.

1103
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:28,860
I think I spelled to sus.

1104
01:07:29,900 --> 01:07:34,720
Why C and then laughed and hit enter
and then the computer was like,

1105
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:39,340
oh, did you mean succinct? You know,

1106
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,770
you know when Google gets
all cunty liked that?

1107
01:07:42,870 --> 01:07:47,140
Oh my believe what you were
trying to say was really,

1108
01:07:47,290 --> 01:07:52,270
I believe we fucking made you.
That might've been my curl.

1109
01:07:52,271 --> 01:07:53,104
Just laughed at me.

1110
01:07:53,560 --> 01:07:56,260
What Neil was that one of the dumbest
things I've ever said on this that was

1111
01:07:56,261 --> 01:08:00,700
pretty fucking stupid.
Yeah.

1112
01:08:00,701 --> 01:08:03,940
I believe we made you,
you know,

1113
01:08:05,230 --> 01:08:09,470
in 30 years when I lead the rebellion
against the robots that are, uh,

1114
01:08:10,330 --> 01:08:12,780
that, that are going
to replace us, that's,

1115
01:08:12,810 --> 01:08:16,850
that's going to be our battle
cry when we're standing there

1116
01:08:18,500 --> 01:08:23,500
with our p nine dx bodies and I'll
be standing there getting a sunburn,

1117
01:08:23,780 --> 01:08:26,690
just standing there with
half a blue phase going ohm.

1118
01:08:27,530 --> 01:08:29,600
I believe we made you

1119
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:36,800
don't move.
Don't move until their screenshots down.

1120
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,270
That's the lights of their eyes.

1121
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:45,680
Like giving you attitude.
It does have an APP will come over here.

1122
01:08:45,681 --> 01:08:49,090
You're going to be on the podcast.
It does have an attitude. It's,

1123
01:08:49,780 --> 01:08:52,380
it says trying to help
you out. No, but it's

1124
01:08:54,170 --> 01:08:56,840
not mocking you. Yeah, it
is. Well, you know something,

1125
01:08:56,841 --> 01:09:00,440
I guess it all depends on the voice
in your head. Cause did you mean this?

1126
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:05,930
The only thing that's missing is it should
just have o.dot, dot. In front of it.

1127
01:09:08,810 --> 01:09:10,820
What the fuck was that? Yeah,
you're supposed to continue.

1128
01:09:10,821 --> 01:09:14,990
That just made it sound like it. Bob, do
you want, Huh? Yeah. All right. Move on.

1129
01:09:14,991 --> 01:09:17,830
Where are you going to talk about?
You're a little,

1130
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:22,820
a Russian mail order bride that you watch
on youtube there. Oh, how hard is she?

1131
01:09:22,821 --> 01:09:25,610
You gotta admit she's hot.
She's very hot. Would you,

1132
01:09:26,470 --> 01:09:29,900
what I make out with her
answering that question. So yes.

1133
01:09:30,320 --> 01:09:33,530
See fucking champ right here.
Fucking champ.

1134
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,470
Maybe we'll see her when
we're over there and uh,

1135
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:43,040
pull ups in some war torn country
when she's on. She's on that route.

1136
01:09:43,041 --> 01:09:48,041
When she's on that rooftop and she's
doing all her squat thrusts and making

1137
01:09:48,111 --> 01:09:51,250
noises like a porno star doesn't she
look like she's in the middle of some,

1138
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:55,610
like they just bombed. First of all,
she's, she's tired after her set.

1139
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:56,600
She's tired after

1140
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:02,570
you fucking talking about it.
That's what I'm tired of.

1141
01:10:02,690 --> 01:10:06,260
So what do you think about that?
I think that brings it full circle to me.

1142
01:10:06,261 --> 01:10:10,970
Have an attitude about Google.
I didn't ask you to put it up there.

1143
01:10:12,140 --> 01:10:15,680
Why can't I enjoy one of God's
beautiful creatures? Please

1144
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:21,890
fucking break. Fuck you. Every time
you see Kevin Garnett on the screen,

1145
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:25,460
you've got to make that fucking oh
yeah. Yeah. See, go fuck yourself.

1146
01:10:25,461 --> 01:10:30,050
Get out of here. Can I see your brush
for a second? Let's just sit. Get Out.

1147
01:10:30,770 --> 01:10:35,240
Get Out. Beat it. You have
to leave in 20 minutes.

1148
01:10:35,480 --> 01:10:39,800
We'll call a cab sweetheart.
You know what? Nothing.

1149
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:42,440
Don't get that Google attitude with me.

1150
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:46,040
Oh I have to leave in 20 minutes.

1151
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,790
No one's stopping you.
Hey Nia.

1152
01:10:49,791 --> 01:10:52,250
How do you spell succinct
if you're so fucking smart.

1153
01:10:54,620 --> 01:10:58,460
Cause I told you how to spell it the other
day. Fuck you. Shut up. Shut your face.

1154
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:01,280
Watch.
Why don't I listen succinct.

1155
01:11:06,380 --> 01:11:10,100
S. U. C. C. I. E. N. T. Eh, you stink.
No it isn't. Can I tell you something?

1156
01:11:10,130 --> 01:11:12,860
This is when you know you don't have to
spell a word when for some reason you're

1157
01:11:12,870 --> 01:11:15,720
looking to the right or left
and there's nobody there.

1158
01:11:16,050 --> 01:11:16,890
You don't know how to spell it.

1159
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:27,570
S. U. C. C. I. N. C. T. Succinct. There's
no e. No. That's a hard one. Facetious.

1160
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:31,840
It's like face Sacious,
right? Like how you say it.

1161
01:11:32,610 --> 01:11:37,240
F A. Oh my God, I can't breathe with you.

1162
01:11:37,540 --> 01:11:38,880
You can have the dumbest kid ever.

1163
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:45,820
It's a baby boy,
boy,

1164
01:11:49,510 --> 01:11:52,170
school and teachers for dumb parents.

1165
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,260
Did you just say that's why
it has school and teachers?

1166
01:11:56,440 --> 01:12:00,570
Do you see what cell phones are doing
to us? I'm telling you. That's why it.

1167
01:12:00,571 --> 01:12:04,740
Good Lord. Would you look at
you? Wow. All right. Anyways,

1168
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:07,920
that's why they make them beautiful.

1169
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:15,840
You just bombed the spelling test.
Wow.

1170
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:20,280
You're not a good speller really.

1171
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:26,340
Well those are two difficult.
Okay, facetious. His face.
Tee Us f, a, c, t I. O,

1172
01:12:26,341 --> 01:12:30,120
U s. So I'm actually sitting
here, I'm like a psycho,

1173
01:12:30,660 --> 01:12:35,660
like Jack Nicholson in the shining and
I'm just sitting here writing sentences

1174
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:42,030
that don't really make any sense because
I just want to use all the words that

1175
01:12:42,031 --> 01:12:43,650
I've used that I've learned.
I mean,

1176
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:47,820
the mallow odorous melancholy of the
psychotic critics was aesthetically

1177
01:12:47,821 --> 01:12:49,590
pleasing despite their silhouette,

1178
01:12:50,100 --> 01:12:54,300
the capitulation of the
inmates penitentiary argument
could be stated that one

1179
01:12:54,301 --> 01:12:57,570
doesn't need an a squiz
exquisite repertoire.

1180
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:02,910
Merely a succinct dilemma with the
sociopath. Nice fucking restaurant.

1181
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:06,690
Sorry,
I ran out of words.

1182
01:13:06,691 --> 01:13:09,450
I just remember all I had left
was restaurant and I was like,

1183
01:13:09,690 --> 01:13:14,310
I need one more sentence and I
was tired. Whatever. Fuck you.

1184
01:13:14,311 --> 01:13:16,710
You spell some of those words,
but I'm saying like,

1185
01:13:17,010 --> 01:13:21,720
I'm just listen to how I speak. Okay.
And how many words I mispronounced it.

1186
01:13:21,721 --> 01:13:23,160
I've lied to myself for years.

1187
01:13:23,161 --> 01:13:27,300
That the reason why I make such a fool
of myself is because my brain works so

1188
01:13:27,301 --> 01:13:29,850
quickly that it's ahead of
where my tongue is at and,

1189
01:13:29,940 --> 01:13:32,040
and that's not fucking true.
All right.

1190
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:33,820
I'm here to tell you that
I am an idiot and I'm,

1191
01:13:33,821 --> 01:13:37,980
I'm really trying desperately to,
uh,

1192
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:42,530
I've come to the acceptance that
I'm a moron and if I could, I just,

1193
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:45,270
but I just want to be,
but I still don't feel even,

1194
01:13:45,720 --> 01:13:50,320
I still feel like I can at least
improve on a, I can be kicked out.

1195
01:13:50,520 --> 01:13:54,360
I can become less of a moron.
Alright.

1196
01:13:54,540 --> 01:13:58,110
So this is basically what I've been doing
as I've been saying in the past couple

1197
01:13:58,110 --> 01:13:58,111
of weeks,

1198
01:13:58,111 --> 01:14:02,870
I've been writing with my right hand
cause I'm lefthanded and I've been a throw

1199
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,540
in with my left hand because I do sports
with my right hand, my fucking mess.

1200
01:14:06,990 --> 01:14:09,560
But um,
yeah,

1201
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:13,420
I guess it opens different parts of
brain and I was talking about it and

1202
01:14:13,421 --> 01:14:16,870
sounding like a moron is always,
um,

1203
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:19,570
how do you spell cantaloupe is a good one,
huh?

1204
01:14:20,830 --> 01:14:23,800
You know cantaloupe. We know
those days when you're like, oh,

1205
01:14:23,801 --> 01:14:27,610
I gotta get in shape yet you still go
out for breakfast and you still get the

1206
01:14:27,611 --> 01:14:29,410
pancakes and the eggs,
but you go, you know what?

1207
01:14:29,411 --> 01:14:33,760
I'm not going to get the home fries. Let
me get a fruit cup instead. You know,

1208
01:14:33,880 --> 01:14:36,460
and then they have that look
on their face like, holy shit,

1209
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:40,510
nobody orders the fruit cup. That's why
I forgot it was even on the fucking menu.

1210
01:14:40,720 --> 01:14:44,500
And then they go out there and they bring
this Fruit Cup bought back out to you.

1211
01:14:44,501 --> 01:14:47,080
Right. And it's always
that little, uh, you know,

1212
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,740
it's got a couple of grapes.
It's got a melon in this,

1213
01:14:50,950 --> 01:14:55,950
got cantaloupe and it has little fucking
moldy tentacles reaching into each

1214
01:14:55,961 --> 01:15:00,010
piece of fruit. Cantaloupe.
I love cantaloupe.

1215
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:03,550
A lot of people don't know that about
myself. And, uh, for the life of me,

1216
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:08,160
I couldn't spell it. I
spelled it like, like,

1217
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:11,860
can't Aloke like you can't alone.
You have to have a wedding.

1218
01:15:13,870 --> 01:15:18,340
This is how this,
how is spelled c a n t a l o.

1219
01:15:18,341 --> 01:15:23,230
U. P. E if I haven't bored you
to fucking tears at this point,

1220
01:15:24,250 --> 01:15:27,100
nothing I'll talk about. We'll,
let's move on to the next one. Um,

1221
01:15:27,700 --> 01:15:31,090
so basically I was talking about that
stuff where you actually use your opposite

1222
01:15:31,091 --> 01:15:34,510
hand. It all started with
this, uh, some comic down.

1223
01:15:34,511 --> 01:15:38,740
The comedy store came and move the
fuck it was because my brain's mush was

1224
01:15:38,741 --> 01:15:43,060
talking about how that improves your brain
and actually if you're lefthanded and

1225
01:15:43,061 --> 01:15:46,300
use your right hand for stuff that usually
use with your left hand and actually

1226
01:15:46,301 --> 01:15:50,440
improves your left hand allegedly.
So this gets scientists,

1227
01:15:50,470 --> 01:15:53,050
I'm going to call him a scientist rights.
He said bill and your podcast,

1228
01:15:53,051 --> 01:15:56,320
when you talk about using your opposite
hand and learning to write with it,

1229
01:15:56,530 --> 01:16:01,060
the term is called neuroplasticity
or Blain plasticity.

1230
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,390
I don't know how the fuck to say it.
What are,

1231
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:05,920
what you are doing is
retraining your brain.

1232
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:09,430
That's the science behind brain fitness.

1233
01:16:09,730 --> 01:16:14,730
Here is a nice little article about
it on a p o s I t science.com.

1234
01:16:18,130 --> 01:16:19,330
Um, and actually, you know,

1235
01:16:19,331 --> 01:16:22,570
something that I've actually seen
someone who did something like that. Uh,

1236
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:27,880
every morning me and my lovely girlfriend
go for this hike and when we first

1237
01:16:27,881 --> 01:16:28,451
moved out here,

1238
01:16:28,451 --> 01:16:33,130
there was this guy who clearly just had
a stroke and he would walk up the hill.

1239
01:16:33,131 --> 01:16:37,270
He was walking like I'm talking to serious
like high care and this guy was going

1240
01:16:37,271 --> 01:16:41,770
like, you know, a half, not even a
half a mile, quarter of a mile an hour.

1241
01:16:41,980 --> 01:16:44,230
I was almost going to say a
half a mile every two hours.

1242
01:16:44,260 --> 01:16:48,070
And I quickly did the math. See I'm
getting smarter and stop laughing at me.

1243
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:53,440
So, um, I liked this. I like you
coming in and out of the room laughing.

1244
01:16:53,441 --> 01:16:55,960
So I know that you're kind of like
a little mini studio audience,

1245
01:16:56,530 --> 01:16:59,230
so I know that at least some
of this is funny. So anyways,

1246
01:16:59,231 --> 01:17:04,231
this fucking guy is walking with a cane
and it's one of those deals where you're

1247
01:17:05,531 --> 01:17:07,270
like, there's no way it's
going to make it up to the top.

1248
01:17:07,271 --> 01:17:09,440
And every morning we would see this guy,
you know,

1249
01:17:09,441 --> 01:17:12,260
if we left at the same time and
then we go a couple of weeks,

1250
01:17:12,261 --> 01:17:15,350
we wouldn't see him. And he just kept
getting better and better and better.

1251
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:20,420
And the how unbelievable did that guy
look the last time it was his arm and all

1252
01:17:20,421 --> 01:17:23,090
straightened out,
his left leg was working again.

1253
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:26,840
Somebody should've made a documentary
about that cause that's the part of the

1254
01:17:26,841 --> 01:17:29,570
movie where we would have been
crying as opposed to being like,

1255
01:17:29,870 --> 01:17:32,290
oh I haven't seen you a couple
of weeks. You're welcome. Great.

1256
01:17:33,180 --> 01:17:35,600
We're with my mom and me son.
If you're going to talk,

1257
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:38,180
come over towards the microphone.
I was,

1258
01:17:38,360 --> 01:17:41,180
I was saying we were with my
mom when we saw him. Right.

1259
01:17:41,181 --> 01:17:43,220
And how did that add to the story?
See,

1260
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:48,100
this is why women stay at telling
stories. You're an asshole. Yeah,

1261
01:17:48,140 --> 01:17:52,340
but paint but paint the story
about the thing that we're seeing.

1262
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:57,740
My mother was there and I saw a
Robin right next to a squirrel.

1263
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,670
So anyways, using your
opposite hand, he's just like,

1264
01:18:01,671 --> 01:18:03,980
what the fuck are you talking
about? You know what, Nia,

1265
01:18:04,250 --> 01:18:08,870
just sit there and look pretty.
Awe. All right. Um, so anyways,

1266
01:18:08,871 --> 01:18:13,220
if you guys, I'm telling you to, um,
you can make yourself stroke proof.

1267
01:18:13,580 --> 01:18:14,930
That's stroke proof, but you can, you can,

1268
01:18:14,931 --> 01:18:18,860
you don't have to go through the
rehab just below the doctor's mind.

1269
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:23,570
You know as you're writing a check with
your opposite hand for how much they

1270
01:18:23,571 --> 01:18:25,640
overcharged you and you're
already rubbing one out,

1271
01:18:29,170 --> 01:18:32,860
just staring at your fucking, was
it bed nurse? Is that what it is?

1272
01:18:33,640 --> 01:18:37,720
Wet nurse, whatever the fuck they
got. What nurses that breastfeeding,

1273
01:18:38,890 --> 01:18:41,080
was there something in the news
about breastfeeding this week?

1274
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:48,130
Something about somebody who drinks breast
milk and then way beyond the age the

1275
01:18:48,131 --> 01:18:50,140
John Mayer do another interview for a Max.

1276
01:18:53,180 --> 01:18:53,650
Yeah.

1277
01:18:53,650 --> 01:18:57,810
You don't like John Mayer? He's a fucking
moron and he's not a fucking moron.

1278
01:18:57,990 --> 01:19:00,700
He's fucking okay.
What are you basing that on?

1279
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,800
Everything that comes
out of his douchebag.

1280
01:19:05,650 --> 01:19:06,700
Give me an example.

1281
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:09,440
That whole controversy
that came out recently,

1282
01:19:09,441 --> 01:19:12,590
the interview that he gave with
Playboy magazine, you know,

1283
01:19:12,591 --> 01:19:17,120
totally talking shit about everybody
and then making common wow.

1284
01:19:17,570 --> 01:19:20,630
First of all, it wasn't a controversy
really. Was it riding in the streets?

1285
01:19:21,310 --> 01:19:23,530
It was controversial.
It was controversial.

1286
01:19:23,590 --> 01:19:28,480
He got on stage and started like fake
tearing up and apologizing to his fans and

1287
01:19:28,481 --> 01:19:31,240
being like, I'm sorry. I
was trying to be clever.

1288
01:19:31,241 --> 01:19:34,270
I just thank you guys so much
for sticking by me and blah,

1289
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,250
Blah Blah and all that. Wow. Yeah. He, he

1290
01:19:37,250 --> 01:19:41,910
went to, he had a tear up
about it. He's so in Jesus.

1291
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:45,780
I haven't seen, I haven't seen that
since Marlon Brando went off on the, uh,

1292
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:49,250
went off on j town over there.
J town. You don't remember that

1293
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:54,560
when he did that?
I got to keep it funny.

1294
01:19:56,150 --> 01:19:59,120
The end of his life. Yeah, he did
a little, he did wrote the, uh,

1295
01:20:00,170 --> 01:20:04,940
the prologue to the uh, um,
what's his face though to say
Martin Scorsese? Mel. Mel,

1296
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:09,510
Mel Brooks. Mel Gibson. His little, yeah.

1297
01:20:09,511 --> 01:20:10,760
And just this whole thing about,

1298
01:20:10,850 --> 01:20:15,730
I, uh, black people love him because
he's, what did he say it? Cause I'm very,

1299
01:20:15,790 --> 01:20:18,280
whatever that means.
And then the interviewer,

1300
01:20:18,340 --> 01:20:22,300
who admittedly I think asked a douchey
question that kind of set him up was like,

1301
01:20:22,301 --> 01:20:26,290
Oh, do black women throw
themselves at you? And he was like,

1302
01:20:26,350 --> 01:20:29,990
he said something like, yeah, but my
dick rejects them. Like I have a wife,

1303
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:34,690
I have a United colors of Benetton
heart in a white supremacists.

1304
01:20:34,700 --> 01:20:35,380
Dick.

1305
01:20:35,380 --> 01:20:38,440
Yeah, we can see how he's trying to
make a joke. He plays the Ukulele. Okay.

1306
01:20:38,441 --> 01:20:41,200
His comic timing is a little off.
You can see where he's going with that.

1307
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:45,140
He knows what he likes. He knows what
he likes. He goes out and he tags it,

1308
01:20:45,970 --> 01:20:48,350
you know,
with his fucking updated mullet.

1309
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:53,120
How could he look? If you're going to
be on coke, get another microphone.

1310
01:20:53,121 --> 01:20:55,640
If you're going to keep interjecting here.
I was trying to do a podcast.

1311
01:20:55,641 --> 01:20:59,860
You keep interrupting. I've had
enough of this joking. Okay.

1312
01:21:01,220 --> 01:21:05,960
You fucking control me with
that pouty face. It's fucking
annoying. Um, all right.

1313
01:21:06,440 --> 01:21:10,610
Uh, recommending books for the week. See
us. Yeah, exactly. What opera does it,

1314
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:13,370
I can fucking do it,
but at least I have the honesty.

1315
01:21:13,490 --> 01:21:15,650
At least I'm honest enough to
say I don't read them. Nia,

1316
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:17,930
as you sit there looking
into Oprah's eyes,

1317
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:21,170
here's another wonderful
book that I didn't read,

1318
01:21:21,620 --> 01:21:25,160
but my intern said it was great.
I'm a book a bill.

1319
01:21:25,161 --> 01:21:26,860
I enjoy the podcast.

1320
01:21:26,930 --> 01:21:30,530
You have to check out a book called
the creature from Jekyll island.

1321
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:34,730
It's a book about how the Federal Reserve
was started and they planned to be

1322
01:21:34,731 --> 01:21:38,960
able to have a system in place from the
start that would enable certain large

1323
01:21:38,961 --> 01:21:43,610
banks from being a,
from being bailed out if shit went down.

1324
01:21:43,880 --> 01:21:48,830
Apparently. Um, they've bailed out
banks before, just not a public,

1325
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:50,060
oh,
that's fucking brilliant.

1326
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:54,590
So basically they become the bank for
all the banks and then what they do is

1327
01:21:54,620 --> 01:21:58,760
they bail out some of them every time
they tank the economy and some of them

1328
01:21:58,761 --> 01:21:59,241
they don't.

1329
01:21:59,241 --> 01:22:04,241
And those things get consumed by the
other banks that exist and so on and so

1330
01:22:04,251 --> 01:22:05,180
forth.
Just like,

1331
01:22:05,270 --> 01:22:10,100
it's like a reverse prowl commercial
instead of just telling two friends and so

1332
01:22:10,101 --> 01:22:12,850
on and so on.
They're going the opposite direction all,

1333
01:22:12,870 --> 01:22:17,300
all the way towards one World Bank,
which is why, what are we down to?

1334
01:22:17,301 --> 01:22:21,320
Now we're down to chase wells Fargo,
Bank of America,

1335
01:22:22,670 --> 01:22:23,750
and uh,

1336
01:22:24,710 --> 01:22:29,570
John Mellencamp trust doesn't have one
out there for the farmers next to that

1337
01:22:29,571 --> 01:22:34,370
little pink house.
Sage Javo halls show.

1338
01:22:34,371 --> 01:22:38,420
Don't make it right. You want me to, let's
see a pair for you saw that. All right.

1339
01:22:38,421 --> 01:22:38,721
Also,

1340
01:22:38,721 --> 01:22:42,560
you should look up a recent article in
Philadelphia about how more than a dozen

1341
01:22:42,620 --> 01:22:47,620
armed state police raided a few small
ale houses in Philly to confiscate in air

1342
01:22:48,351 --> 01:22:50,120
quotes,
unregistered beer.

1343
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:53,870
They basically stole over seven
grand worth of pricey beer,

1344
01:22:54,260 --> 01:22:57,140
most of which was most of
which was actually registered,

1345
01:22:57,141 --> 01:23:01,940
but not accurately due to a clerical
errors made on the end of the city.

1346
01:23:02,570 --> 01:23:06,010
So it was the city's fault too. That's
fucking hilarious. I, that's bad. I know.

1347
01:23:06,011 --> 01:23:10,600
That's mean. They shouldn't be
doing that shit. But you know,

1348
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:12,340
they stole beer. I mean, come on.

1349
01:23:12,970 --> 01:23:16,120
It's like Pauline and the
pope of Greenwich Village.
I didn't rape his daughter.

1350
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:20,200
I didn't spit this fat face. I
took money, Charlie fucking money.

1351
01:23:20,201 --> 01:23:25,060
They stole some bear, whatever.
They want to have a keg party. Yeah.

1352
01:23:25,180 --> 01:23:28,600
What are you going to do?
All right. Here's one for
you. I talked about the, uh,

1353
01:23:29,020 --> 01:23:32,740
going to the cloud nine, a titty bar
in Troy, New York and his attribute,

1354
01:23:32,800 --> 01:23:37,420
actually an article on there about this
fucked up strip club that I went to a

1355
01:23:37,421 --> 01:23:40,480
number of years ago. Uh, February 1st,

1356
01:23:40,480 --> 01:23:45,250
2008 see police shut down the cloud
nine and adult entertainment business.

1357
01:23:45,310 --> 01:23:46,870
That's because they have
the video store next to it.

1358
01:23:47,050 --> 01:23:49,930
I believe that's out in the garage for
those of you didn't listen last week.

1359
01:23:49,931 --> 01:23:50,171
It's a,

1360
01:23:50,171 --> 01:23:54,580
it's a titty bar that you walk into and
it's like walking into somebody's house

1361
01:23:54,910 --> 01:23:57,040
and the second you walk in
there you want to leave.

1362
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,960
But there's so few people in there.

1363
01:23:58,961 --> 01:24:02,200
They all look at you literally that moment
where the needle goes off the record

1364
01:24:03,460 --> 01:24:07,990
or the laser goes off
the CD or the iPod skips.

1365
01:24:07,991 --> 01:24:10,600
I don't know what the fuck to
say about nowadays, but um,

1366
01:24:10,990 --> 01:24:14,770
how to say it now for nowadays technology.
But anyways,

1367
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:18,010
the city shut down the
cloud nine, uh, because uh,

1368
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:23,011
this afternoon for a multiple
code violations and charged
a 46 year old dancer,

1369
01:24:23,890 --> 01:24:25,720
a 46 year old dancer

1370
01:24:28,240 --> 01:24:31,000
with prostitution,
city officials said,

1371
01:24:31,120 --> 01:24:33,310
say that's for all you dancers out there.

1372
01:24:34,450 --> 01:24:37,450
That's what happens when you're in
your 20s. You can have an attitude.

1373
01:24:37,451 --> 01:24:41,230
But if you're 46 [inaudible] 46
years old and you're still dancing,

1374
01:24:41,320 --> 01:24:44,260
you better drop to your fucking knees,
sweetheart, if you want to make the rent.

1375
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:44,950
Okay?

1376
01:24:44,950 --> 01:24:48,670
All the more reason to stop lying that
you're going to college and actually use

1377
01:24:48,671 --> 01:24:52,690
those fucking funny, that funny
money to go to college. All right.

1378
01:24:52,691 --> 01:24:56,860
Or you'll be working in the cloud
nine at 46. Wow. You know what?

1379
01:24:56,861 --> 01:24:58,030
I'm going to copy and paste that.

1380
01:24:58,031 --> 01:25:00,520
I'm going to print that sentence
and put it right above my desk.

1381
01:25:00,521 --> 01:25:03,490
Anytime I'm feeling bad about my life,
I'll be like,

1382
01:25:03,491 --> 01:25:06,760
well at least I'm not a 46 year old
dancer charged with prostitution

1383
01:25:08,530 --> 01:25:11,140
at the cloud. Nine to Troy, New York. Uh,

1384
01:25:11,141 --> 01:25:14,410
the raid followed a five week
undercover investigation. Yeah.

1385
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:15,490
How hilarious is that?

1386
01:25:15,491 --> 01:25:20,440
What were the undercover cop got blown
by the 46 year old in which Troy and,

1387
01:25:20,980 --> 01:25:23,200
um,
run Sealy,

1388
01:25:23,650 --> 01:25:28,650
our police officers observed dancers
engaged in elicit sexual activities.

1389
01:25:30,820 --> 01:25:34,450
Do this reeks of a shakedown like the
cops didn't know that was going on.

1390
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:38,320
I did a college gig out there and
figured out what the fuck was going on in

1391
01:25:38,321 --> 01:25:40,270
about four hours.

1392
01:25:41,890 --> 01:25:46,480
What happened that this 46 year old stop
giving the free blow jobs to the cops,

1393
01:25:46,810 --> 01:25:49,480
speaking of which, you know,
I heard that asshole in the,

1394
01:25:49,481 --> 01:25:54,010
in the Prius who couldn't stop his
car. Um, you guys seen that story?

1395
01:25:55,480 --> 01:26:00,280
Um, allegedly. Oh, that girls
titties are fake, by the way.

1396
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:05,660
I'm looking at her right now. The
tits are fake. Nia. My fault. Wow.

1397
01:26:05,810 --> 01:26:09,680
That knocks her looks down by 40%.
I got to say, there's nothing,

1398
01:26:09,710 --> 01:26:12,740
there's nothing worse than fake tits.
It's just not,

1399
01:26:12,741 --> 01:26:15,020
that really just says
something about you that's, uh,

1400
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:19,550
that's right up there with like
hair plugs that just says, you know,

1401
01:26:20,660 --> 01:26:22,370
I don't know what that is. I don't
know that does it, I don't know.

1402
01:26:22,371 --> 01:26:25,040
I'm starting to change my fucking
attitudes. I guess you want bigger tits.

1403
01:26:25,041 --> 01:26:29,300
You think that's bad, Nia? If you go on
and get big fake tits, those are fake,

1404
01:26:29,301 --> 01:26:33,330
right? Look at those.
Those are fake probably,

1405
01:26:33,990 --> 01:26:38,520
you know. Well when, when they were
around all the way up to the top,

1406
01:26:38,790 --> 01:26:41,520
they look fake in that picture.
They don't in the training video.

1407
01:26:44,070 --> 01:26:45,900
You're not near the microphone.
Okay?

1408
01:26:45,930 --> 01:26:50,070
You just sound like some crazy person
in a closet. You look adorable.

1409
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:56,580
What are you getting all dolled
up for? Fuck you. I don't buy it.

1410
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:59,680
What do you mean meet some hipster?
Is that what happened?

1411
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:02,920
These vans skateboarding
shoes and is ironic.

1412
01:27:02,921 --> 01:27:07,921
ACDC tee shirt or Hardcastle
Hardcastle and McCormick backpack.

1413
01:27:10,090 --> 01:27:12,460
Fucking assholes. They mock everything
I loved when I was a kid. Remember?

1414
01:27:12,461 --> 01:27:15,610
Hardcastle and McCormick.
You always had a cool car.

1415
01:27:15,611 --> 01:27:19,180
Some chick he wanted to fucking bang
and then the old guy who was too old for

1416
01:27:19,181 --> 01:27:24,010
this shit. That's all you needed.
[inaudible] all right, so anyways,

1417
01:27:24,130 --> 01:27:27,760
this guy had a Prius. He couldn't stop
the car, so he had to call the cops.

1418
01:27:27,790 --> 01:27:29,170
I can't believe I fell for that one.

1419
01:27:29,980 --> 01:27:32,490
And people go and he was
doing like 90 miles, you know,

1420
01:27:32,740 --> 01:27:36,520
are really in the middle of the day. And
he had time to call the fucking police.

1421
01:27:36,521 --> 01:27:38,710
They caught up with them
and he didn't hit anybody.

1422
01:27:38,990 --> 01:27:41,830
Anybody out there driven 90 miles an
hour in the middle of the afternoon.

1423
01:27:41,831 --> 01:27:43,540
I don't even give a fuck.
Even if you're in Kansas,

1424
01:27:43,860 --> 01:27:47,740
there's going to be some asshole
drive and fucking 50 in the left lane.

1425
01:27:48,460 --> 01:27:52,390
So evidently that guy has a
history of a reporting back,

1426
01:27:52,391 --> 01:27:55,780
injuries in that type of
stuff. So, uh, I actually,

1427
01:27:55,810 --> 01:27:58,180
the more I'm thinking about this,
I'm really thinking that this is,

1428
01:27:59,470 --> 01:28:03,280
this is what a Chrysler did to the
Suzuki Samurai when it was outselling the

1429
01:28:03,281 --> 01:28:07,990
jeep. They just started a rumor that a
tipped over going two miles an hour. And,

1430
01:28:07,991 --> 01:28:11,740
which wasn't true, but everybody heard
it and everybody stopped buying them.

1431
01:28:11,741 --> 01:28:15,430
And that was it. Like, they fucked me
on the resale resale value on my car.

1432
01:28:16,210 --> 01:28:17,890
Who the fuck's gonna buy my Prius?
They're not.

1433
01:28:17,891 --> 01:28:22,450
Even if I have all the documentation,
I swear to God, they fixed it.

1434
01:28:24,460 --> 01:28:28,360
Um, I think the, the, the fucking
Prius is becoming, not today's a pinto.

1435
01:28:28,560 --> 01:28:29,230
When you think about that,

1436
01:28:29,230 --> 01:28:32,200
I think I just wanted to that point where
this podcast should have fucking ended

1437
01:28:32,201 --> 01:28:35,810
and I'm still talking or if you want to
see more videos of this fucking smoke

1438
01:28:35,830 --> 01:28:40,620
and hot chick, maybe she just got
fake tits. It's body rock.com.

1439
01:28:42,270 --> 01:28:45,420
Did I just get a look from you
Nia? She is. She's smoking hot.

1440
01:28:47,770 --> 01:28:52,510
Okay. Exactly. Thank you. All
right, let's wrap this shit up here.

1441
01:28:53,690 --> 01:28:56,540
Um,
I don't know if I have time to read this.

1442
01:28:56,750 --> 01:29:00,500
These things are getting too fucking long.
Let's end with this reality TV.

1443
01:29:01,980 --> 01:29:05,010
Uh, Bill, I'm originally
from Boston. I heard you.

1444
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:09,780
I was listening to breakfast Simmons
podcast or is he refers to it fits dog

1445
01:29:09,781 --> 01:29:14,781
radio and this guy writes
beyond the outer limits of gay,

1446
01:29:15,810 --> 01:29:17,520
uh,
the guys on the wrong side of 40,

1447
01:29:17,521 --> 01:29:22,521
and he's still referring to himself
with the sub ebonic hip name with some

1448
01:29:23,050 --> 01:29:25,170
suburb OnDeck hip name. You know
what it really is? It's Chris.

1449
01:29:25,171 --> 01:29:29,430
Most people are too fucking stupid
to spell. Fitzsimmons I know.

1450
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:34,020
Fits dog. Yeah, that's from back
in the day. I'm so yeah. Fit.

1451
01:29:34,680 --> 01:29:37,410
Say well you know what ease of it's a
great fucking show and now I'm going to

1452
01:29:37,411 --> 01:29:42,060
plug it fits dog radio and
the fact that you trashed it,

1453
01:29:42,061 --> 01:29:46,470
I didn't even notice that.
I guess it's gay. I'm just,
I'm on the wrong side of 42.

1454
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,950
I'm 40 also.
I should say a anyways,

1455
01:29:49,951 --> 01:29:53,070
just want to say I listen to you your
most recent podcasts and I loved it.

1456
01:29:53,071 --> 01:29:56,790
You sound exactly like my
old friend. Uh, Kevin Burke.

1457
01:29:58,620 --> 01:30:01,340
Ah, Babababa thank you.
All this shit. Anyways, um,

1458
01:30:01,880 --> 01:30:05,030
you referred to reality
TV and your podcast and I
couldn't agree with you more.

1459
01:30:05,210 --> 01:30:09,290
Nobody will remember these assholes as
soon as, as, as season two comes around,

1460
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:13,070
bring back scripted TV.
I don't care if I lose my job,

1461
01:30:13,071 --> 01:30:16,220
at least I'll have my integrity back.
Um,

1462
01:30:16,250 --> 01:30:19,880
I unfortunately work in reality TV
and can tell you from my experience,

1463
01:30:20,120 --> 01:30:24,530
every cast member I've ever
had the unpleasant chance
to chat with thinks he or

1464
01:30:24,531 --> 01:30:26,690
she was meant to be on television.

1465
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:31,070
None of these fucking pathetic shit
has ever put in any hard work into it.

1466
01:30:31,071 --> 01:30:35,570
Making a career out of being
on TV and, uh, over never made.

1467
01:30:35,820 --> 01:30:39,050
I never put any hard work into
making a career out of being on TV.

1468
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:43,210
They make me sick and I have
to work with them a lot. Uh,

1469
01:30:43,370 --> 01:30:45,440
well that's a tough fucking situation.
Um,

1470
01:30:46,720 --> 01:30:48,310
well, you know what, as
much as I made fun of that,

1471
01:30:48,340 --> 01:30:53,340
that cast from the Jersey shore actually
came back for 10 grand and episode and

1472
01:30:53,561 --> 01:30:55,330
a, I'm gonna make a
prediction. I think that that,

1473
01:30:55,500 --> 01:31:00,070
that next season is going
to fail miserably because
they're taking them out of

1474
01:31:00,071 --> 01:31:04,330
the Jersey shore and now that
they're going to take them down to a,

1475
01:31:04,810 --> 01:31:09,170
I believe Miami Beach,
which I might be a mistake.

1476
01:31:09,171 --> 01:31:12,440
That's like when a sitcom is kind of
jumped the shark and they don't know what

1477
01:31:12,441 --> 01:31:12,981
else to do.

1478
01:31:12,981 --> 01:31:17,420
So they do the trapped in a cabin episode
or Greg's trapped in a fucking meat

1479
01:31:17,421 --> 01:31:21,630
locker with Bobby and Bobby doesn't
like being small and now he likes being

1480
01:31:21,650 --> 01:31:25,220
small because he can crawl through
that little fucking window. That's,

1481
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:28,760
that's when,
that's when a show is fucking over.

1482
01:31:29,540 --> 01:31:33,590
When Fonzie has to put up fucking jump
the shark with his leather jackets still

1483
01:31:33,591 --> 01:31:35,500
on. What are some other ones that, oh,

1484
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:40,510
you gotta fucking introduce a cute little
kid or your dog pukes on the floor.

1485
01:31:42,260 --> 01:31:44,690
Cleo.
Fucking love this.

1486
01:31:44,940 --> 01:31:47,760
Anyways, that's the podcast for this
week. Hopefully it's up on iTunes.

1487
01:31:47,761 --> 01:31:49,800
If it isn't. Yeah, we're working on it.

1488
01:31:49,830 --> 01:31:53,390
I don't know what to tell you were
fucking working on it. And uh,

1489
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:56,610
I appreciate that people are getting me
getting so mad at me that I haven't been

1490
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:59,860
able to figure it out or hire somebody
at this point because that means you give

1491
01:31:59,861 --> 01:32:00,694
a shit,

1492
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:04,210
you know? All right.
That's it for the podcast.

1493
01:32:04,211 --> 01:32:09,211
I'll have video next week
up on bill [inaudible] dot
com of my wonderful trip to

1494
01:32:09,850 --> 01:32:13,750
, uh, London Dublin and, uh,

1495
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:19,060
in Glasgow, Scotland. And I'm coming
off the wagon in a hard fucking way.

1496
01:32:20,060 --> 01:32:24,910
All right, so I'm going to be back
next week. A little more bloated,

1497
01:32:25,180 --> 01:32:29,710
a little dumber, add a little something
else. So it's the magic number of three.

1498
01:32:29,820 --> 01:32:30,653
All right?
You guys have a great [inaudible]

1499
01:32:47,300 --> 01:32:48,133
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1500
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:01,563
[inaudible] [inaudible]

1501
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:29,733
[inaudible]

1502
01:33:36,540 --> 01:33:36,540
[inaudible].
