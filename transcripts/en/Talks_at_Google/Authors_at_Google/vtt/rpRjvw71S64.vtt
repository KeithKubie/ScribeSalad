[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:07.907 --> 00:00:09.490
- Just a couple of
days ago, actually,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.364
they were shooting by my best
friend's house, so it was,

00:00:12.364 --> 00:00:14.950
kind of-- yeah.

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.660
- And, like, you
never know what type

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:23.460
of car going to drive
past and do some shooting.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.890
You come down south,
or come over east,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.587
or something like
that, it's going

00:00:27.587 --> 00:00:29.420
to-- you're going to
see run-down buildings,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.680
abandoned buildings, home--
a lot of homeless people,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.810
like, a lot of, just, bad.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.650
- My name is [? Cordell ?]
[? Samson. ?]

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.150
- My name is Mariah Lopez.

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:47.740
- My name is
[? Ramil ?] [? Ward. ?]

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.448
- My name is [? Jetly ?]
[? Henderson. ?]

00:00:49.448 --> 00:00:52.057
- I'm from 59th and Aberdeen,
Southside of Chicago.

00:00:52.057 --> 00:00:53.140
- The Eastside of Chicago.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.760
- I stay on 80th and Saginaw.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.500
- I am from Chicago, Illinois.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.610
And I-- I live on--

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.450
I heard about My Block,
My Hood, My City.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.660
At first, I had saw
a video on YouTube

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.160
with a person wearing a My
shirt-- a regular sweatshirt.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.512
And then I also heard
about it from my principal.

00:01:09.512 --> 00:01:10.720
- Hi, my name is Vincent Gay.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.905
I'm the founding Principal
at Baker College Prep.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:15.097
I heard about My Block,
My Hood, My City.

00:01:15.097 --> 00:01:16.430
Our social worker brought it up.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.138
We were trying to
think of different ways

00:01:18.138 --> 00:01:19.870
that we can get our
students exposed

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.000
to different parts of Chicago.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.740
And then through
a couple emails,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.020
we were able to connect
with the organization.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.860
- And he said we could be taking
a trip to a White Sox game.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.432
And I was interested in
it, because, like, my mom's

00:01:32.432 --> 00:01:34.140
always saying I should
get out the house.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.750
And then so I just
figured, like, why not?

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.750
Yeah, I had a good time.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.480
Like, I was talking.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.220
I saw some good swings.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.560
It got me out my comfort
zone, because, like, I'm

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.601
not really that type of
person that be going out.

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:48.850
Like, I'm an inside
person most of the time--

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:50.004
all the time, actually.

00:01:50.004 --> 00:01:50.920
[MUSIC - COMMON, "BE"]

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.420
- That's when we went on the
fieldtrip with my softball team

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.250
to the fitness gym.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:57.850
At the end of the workout,
I actually felt tired.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.570
But it felt, like,
good at the same time.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.570
I felt like-- it kind of
made me feel, kind of, grown.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.680
My favorite part about
the My Block, My Hood,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.149
My City is the
experience that I get

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.690
to have of going to
different places,

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:08.850
like when we went
to that restaurant--

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:09.997
the [INAUDIBLE] restaurant.

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:10.830
When we went there--

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.621
I'd never been to a
place like that before.

00:02:12.621 --> 00:02:14.560
And it was actually
very fun to be

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.540
able to experience a
new opportunity to be

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.340
able to do something else.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.257
My family, we really
don't really go out much.

00:02:20.257 --> 00:02:21.839
And when I go downtown,
I don't really

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:23.447
have enough money
to go out like that.

00:02:23.447 --> 00:02:25.203
So it was, kind
of, fun-- it was,

00:02:25.203 --> 00:02:26.369
not kind of, but really fun.

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:27.869
- I think My Block,
My Hood, My City

00:02:27.869 --> 00:02:31.290
is an amazing organization
which exposes students

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.630
from different neighborhoods
to different parts of the city.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.430
What I really like
about it for the school

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.939
is, that they are
100% in charge.

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:40.480
We just give the
the list of students

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.320
who are going to attend.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.069
And they take it from
the moment that they

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.680
pick the kids up at
school until they

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.200
bring them back safely as well.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.700
- Like, if I just had, like, a
little taste of what it it is

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.590
to have a lot of money,
and be able to do--

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.575
take care of my sister, and
my family, and my brothers,

00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:53.390
and all of them.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.135
Like, I'd never
want to let that go.

00:02:55.135 --> 00:02:56.250
Like, I'm going to keep
working harder and harder

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.075
to get to to where I want to be.

00:02:58.075 --> 00:03:00.700
- It was awesome, because
I got this, like--

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.190
I got to be people--
around people

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.680
that was trying to take
us out for a good time,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.680
like, just in case, like, if
our parents didn't ever had time

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.525
to do all that.

00:03:09.525 --> 00:03:11.380
You know, we have
people at our program

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:12.695
to help us out with that.

00:03:12.695 --> 00:03:14.440
- It was basically
like a place for me

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.000
to have fun, and, like, take
the negative out, and just keep

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.150
everything positive.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.191

Chicago Googlers.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.450
Thank you so much for
joining us on a Friday.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.680
As we were planning, we
know that this office

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.627
is fairly busy, and getting more
and more popular with events,

00:04:11.627 --> 00:04:13.710
so this is one of the only
times we had available.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.850
And we're super excited.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.839
And wow, this room is
filled, so I'm super pumped.

00:04:18.839 --> 00:04:20.579
We've been working
with Jahmal and Codi

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.040
in My Block, My Hood, My
City for almost a year now.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:25.350
And I'm not going to take
too much time up here,

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.470
but it's-- they just have
such a fascinating story.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:30.780
And the reach that
they've been able to make

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.030
in the city of
Chicago, and the impact

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.760
that they've been able to
have in the lives of so

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.840
many kids in this city is just
something that caught our eye.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.260
And it's-- we're really, really
excited about the partnerships

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.950
we've had with
this organization.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.050
There's a lot of people
doing good in this city,

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.530
but when you talk, and
you'll hear from Jamal,

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.190
like, someone who is truly
passionate about putting

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.070
his life on the line, and
really making sure that he's

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.530
out there for the kids.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.550
And he'll talk about some of the
risks that he's taken his life.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.760
But it's really,
for me, it's just

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.220
been, sort of, a good
person to look up to,

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.740
in terms of how much
commitment and giving back

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.450
to the community you can do.

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.730
So, again, super
excited that you all

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.405
are here to listen
to his message,

00:05:16.405 --> 00:05:18.030

a round of applause.

JAHMAL COLE: Last
night I couldn't sleep.

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:30.980
You know, it wasn't
because we don't have heat.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:33.420
Like, not having heat on
my block is regular stuff.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:36.460
We heat the house with the
oven, go back to sleep.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.729
But I still couldn't
sleep last night.

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:40.645
You know, it wasn't
because I heard gunshots--

00:05:40.645 --> 00:05:41.919
[POW] [POW].

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:43.960
I mean, I hear gunshots
all the time on my block.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.832
Hearing gunshots
is regular stuff.

00:05:45.832 --> 00:05:47.290
I tell myself
they're firecrackers.

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:50.216
I go back to sleep, no biggie.

00:05:50.216 --> 00:05:53.300
But I still couldn't
sleep last night.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.640
You know, it wasn't
because of the helicopters

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:56.700
flying over my house.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:58.580
Hearing helicopters
is regular stuff.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.142
They fly over every night.

00:06:01.142 --> 00:06:03.600
I couldn't sleep, because, the
lights from the helicopters,

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.400
they were shining
through my window.

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.681
They had the whole
block lit up at 2:00 AM.

00:06:07.681 --> 00:06:09.430
Like broad day, you
could see every bullet

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.650
casing on the ground.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:13.740
I couldn't sleep.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:19.180
I live in a house with my
Aunt and her husband, Marvin.

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.360
Both of them are drug addicts.

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.190
The last time I see
my Aunt, she came

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.770
into the house with a black
t-shirt with a Batman logo

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:28.120
on the chest, and half
of her ear was missing.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:30.917
And she lay on the
kitchen floor, bleeding.

00:06:30.917 --> 00:06:33.000
She got into a fight with
the drug addict outside,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.665
by the way.

00:06:35.665 --> 00:06:38.277
My house is run by
my older cousins.

00:06:38.277 --> 00:06:39.360
Both of them are in gangs.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:40.260
And both them sell drugs.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:42.551
But nobody says that, being
in a gang is regular stuff.

00:06:42.551 --> 00:06:44.010
They say, this is my set.

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:45.270
These are my friends.

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:47.480
I'm maintaining.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.565
I love my older cousins.

00:06:49.565 --> 00:06:50.450
I love them.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:51.950
They tell me I'm smart.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.290
My teachers don't
tell me I'm smart.

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.970
My cousins say I'm smart,
because I'm the lookout.

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.290
I know all nine cars that are
supposed to be on my block.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.160
I know there's a Chevy
with a black tint,

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.030
a baby-blue Cadillac, a van
with the curtains in it,

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.070
the man with the motorcycle,
or royal-blue Acura,

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.820
a Toyota Camry with a City
College bumper sticker,

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:13.370
a lady with a Cherokee,
this all-black Charger

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:16.360
with silver rims, and there's
a brown Honda minivan.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.470
And if any one of those
nine cars aren't there

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:20.570
and someone else pulls
up, I tell my cousins.

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:21.230
They say I'm a smart--

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:21.896
I'm the lookout.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.140
I order my food in the morning
through bulletproof glass

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:33.369
windows with mugshots of
black faces on the front.

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:35.410
There's no microphone, so
I have to yell my order

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:36.660
to the guy behind the counter.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.170
I say, hey, I want the Doritos.

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.820
No, not the Spicy Nachos.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.250
I want the Blue Ranch, the
blue bag, the blue bag,

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:43.827
the blue bag.

00:07:43.827 --> 00:07:44.660
He goes and gets it.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:48.310
And he drops my Doritos inside
the bulletproof glass drawer.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:50.790
And he slides it out to me,
like he's a prison guard

00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:52.540
and I'm an inmate in
solitary confinement.

00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.790
I'm in the real world, though.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.930
There's ShotSpotters on the
poles, blue lights flashing.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.330
German Shepherds sniff us
when you get on the train.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.190
If society was a
person, I wouldn't

00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:08.794
think society liked
me, so I steal anyway.

00:08:08.794 --> 00:08:10.710
I am looking forward to
going to school today,

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:12.668
because I'm a part of
the after-school program.

00:08:12.668 --> 00:08:14.580
It's called My Block,
My Hood, My City.

00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.740
It's ran by this guy
named Jahmal Cole.

00:08:16.740 --> 00:08:18.060
I believe in him.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:19.500
Jahmal is always
saying, he can't

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.220
afford to take us to China,
so he takes us to Chinatown.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.020
He can't afford to
take us to Poland,

00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:27.030
so he takes us to
Jefferson Park.

00:08:27.030 --> 00:08:28.710
He can't afford to
take us to India,

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.382
so he takes us to Divine Avenue.

00:08:30.382 --> 00:08:32.340
Jahmal is always saying
we can travel the world

00:08:32.340 --> 00:08:34.598
without leaving Chicago.

00:08:34.598 --> 00:08:36.264
Just last week, Jahmal
took us downtown.

00:08:36.264 --> 00:08:38.080
And we went to a museum.

00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:40.960
But the coolest part about
the trip was not the museum,

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:43.030
the coolest part was that,
you know, I never seen

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:44.790
anybody wave for a taxi before.

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:46.360
And Jahmal let us
all wave for taxis.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.693
And we got to ride a few blocks.

00:08:47.693 --> 00:08:49.651
I thought that was amazing.

00:08:49.651 --> 00:08:52.110
I was telling Jahmal that I
don't like to go see my Father,

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:53.442
because he just got out of jail.

00:08:53.442 --> 00:08:54.620
And he's on house arrest.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.331
And every time I see him,
he sends me on errands.

00:08:58.331 --> 00:09:00.080
I noticed, the last
time I was over there,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.510
my Mom posted a picture of
her and her new boyfriend

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.410
on Facebook.

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.457
And my Dad liked that picture.

00:09:05.457 --> 00:09:07.040
But when my Mom
posted a picture of me

00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:11.955
having a 3.2 GPA on Facebook,
my Dad never liked that picture.

00:09:11.955 --> 00:09:12.830
And that bothered me.

00:09:16.490 --> 00:09:18.037
My name is Jahmal Cole.

00:09:18.037 --> 00:09:20.120
I thought it was important
to start off, and paint

00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.540
that picture, because the more
we're separated as a city,

00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:26.094
the less empathy we
have for each other.

00:09:26.094 --> 00:09:28.010
When most people hear
about something negative

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.390
happening in another
Chicago community,

00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.920
especially where people look
a lot different from them,

00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:35.164
it might as well happen
in another country.

00:09:35.164 --> 00:09:36.830
But when you visit
different communities

00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:38.510
and you interact
with the residents,

00:09:38.510 --> 00:09:40.810
you can change all that.

00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.270
I grew up in a household
where my older cousins

00:09:43.270 --> 00:09:46.090
are both-- one is doing 80,
one is doing 40 years in jail.

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:47.830
I love my cousins--

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:48.839
love them.

00:09:48.839 --> 00:09:49.630
I still write them.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:52.570
I write them by hand, so they
can know I still love them.

00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.880
Last letter, I said, hey
man, how's it going in there?

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.162
How's it going?

00:09:57.162 --> 00:09:59.370
He said, you know what,
Jamal, on my block-- in jail,

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.036
there's blocks--

00:10:00.036 --> 00:10:02.332
A block, B block, C block--
he said on my block,

00:10:02.332 --> 00:10:03.665
you know, there's no pedophiles.

00:10:03.665 --> 00:10:07.260
You know, on my block, someone
might have sold a little drugs,

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.660
caught a homicide,
racketeering-- you know,

00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:10.440
regular stuff.

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.880
It is not regular
to have to order

00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:20.010
your food through
three-inch bulletproof glass

00:10:20.010 --> 00:10:21.540
windows in the morning.

00:10:21.540 --> 00:10:24.780
If I put a three-inch
bulletproof glass window

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.990
in the Gold Coast,
they would have a fit.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:29.970
It is not regular
for German Shepherds

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:32.417
to sniff you when you get
on the train in the morning.

00:10:32.417 --> 00:10:34.500
It's not regular for people
to check your receipts

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.749
when you're leaving the store.

00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:39.530
It is not regular
for helicopters

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:43.160
to fly over your house at night.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.240
They say my program works
with at-risk teenagers.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.770
I think the
integrity of our city

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:51.860
is at risk if we're
not supporting programs

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.640
that are focused on teenagers.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.620
I was born on the Greyhound bus.

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.800
Not literally, but it's a place
where the most formative years

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:05.527
of my life took place.

00:11:05.527 --> 00:11:07.610
Every time my Father and
my Mother would break up,

00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:12.200
I'd take the Greyhound from
Chicago to Fort Worth, Texas.

00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:13.897
Yeah, you can imagine
an 11-year-old

00:11:13.897 --> 00:11:14.980
taking the train to Texas.

00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:17.275
That's not the safest thing,
but those experiences,

00:11:17.275 --> 00:11:19.570
they really transformed me.

00:11:19.570 --> 00:11:22.720
Any fears I had of being in a
new or foreign place, that was

00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:25.440
overcome by sheer curiosity.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:28.740
I became somewhat of an
amateur anthropologist.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:31.140
You know, we'd head
from the cornfields of--

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.860
you know, the concrete of
Chicago to the cornfields

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:34.950
a greater Illinois.

00:11:34.950 --> 00:11:38.130
I get out of Memphis, Tennessee;
Little Rock, Arkansas.

00:11:38.130 --> 00:11:41.460
I notice the sights, the
sounds the food, the scenery.

00:11:41.460 --> 00:11:43.790
I expanded my world view.

00:11:47.526 --> 00:11:49.150
While volunteering
at Cook County Jail,

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.130
and talking with
the young men there,

00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:53.680
it became clear
that a lot of them

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.262
had never traveled
outside of their block.

00:11:57.262 --> 00:11:58.220
I said, where you from?

00:11:58.220 --> 00:11:59.900
They say, my block
is 21st Street.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:02.590
My hood is the low end.

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:05.050
I said, well what
about your city?

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:08.640
To me, it was tragic they
had never left anywhere.

00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:10.970
So I started a program,
where I take teenagers

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:13.130
from the block on
educational field trips.

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.300
And we expose them to
different cultures,

00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.370
different professions,
and different cuisines.

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.670
And that's what we do.

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:22.970
I believe exposure is key to
solving violence in the city.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:30.770
My Father, my role model--

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:32.687
I went to a alternative
high school.

00:12:32.687 --> 00:12:34.020
I said, I want to go to college.

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:36.900
I told my guidance counselor,
I want to go to college.

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:39.270
She said, you don't need to
go to a alternative school.

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.530
You know, why do you
want to go to college?

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:41.340
Go to the Army.

00:12:41.340 --> 00:12:42.580
Go to the military.

00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:44.370
Go to a trade school.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:46.767
Her phone rang.

00:12:46.767 --> 00:12:47.600
She left the office.

00:12:50.029 --> 00:12:51.320
I took a book off of her shelf.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.640
It said All-American Colleges.

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.282
I ripped a page out.

00:12:54.282 --> 00:12:55.650
It said, Wayne State Nebraska.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.255
I was like, ah, Nebraska!

00:12:57.255 --> 00:12:58.150
I was so mad.

00:12:58.150 --> 00:12:59.860
I was like, why couldn't it
have said Florida or New York.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:00.443
It's Nebraska.

00:13:00.443 --> 00:13:03.160
It's crazy.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.310
That was my options.

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:07.340
So prior to this, I only
applied to one college.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.160
I applied to one
college senior year.

00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:10.772
And that was Howard University.

00:13:10.772 --> 00:13:12.730
And that's because Sean
Puffy Combs went there.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:15.280
And I was like, man, I want to
start my own business, right?

00:13:15.280 --> 00:13:17.196
But two weeks before
graduation, I had never--

00:13:17.196 --> 00:13:18.520
I hadn't heard back.

00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:20.440
And them applications
was like $75.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.480
I didn't hear anything back.

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:24.490
Two weeks before high
school graduation,

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:26.320
I'm in my guidance
counselor's office.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:29.040
And I take this paper, and
shove it in my pocket--

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:29.890
Wayne State College.

00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:32.050
She comes back, bla, bla,
bla, bla, bla, telling me--

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.380
she was telling me the
truth, at the time.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:34.840
But as a kid, you know, I'm--

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:36.355
you know, I wanted
to go to the NBA.

00:13:36.355 --> 00:13:37.480
That's what I wanted to do.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.130
I'm going to college.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:39.880
I go downstairs.

00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:44.339
I dial 402-375-7000.

00:13:44.339 --> 00:13:45.130
Nancy was her name.

00:13:45.130 --> 00:13:46.754
Hey, do you guys got
a basketball team?

00:13:46.754 --> 00:13:47.420
Yes.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:49.070
Do you guys got a
history program?

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:49.610
Yes.

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:50.110
Cool.

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:55.450
God was shining on me,
because they accepted kids

00:13:55.450 --> 00:13:56.420
from alternative
high schools, it

00:13:56.420 --> 00:13:57.940
didn't matter what your GPA was.

00:13:57.940 --> 00:13:58.967
They accepted me.

00:13:58.967 --> 00:14:01.300
I walked around with that
acceptance letter in my pocket

00:14:01.300 --> 00:14:01.900
all summer.

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:03.400
I showed it to my friends.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:04.690
I got my jaw broke.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:06.660
You leaving the block?

00:14:06.660 --> 00:14:08.460
Now you going nowhere.

00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:10.950
I got my jaw broke.

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:12.590
I showed acceptance
letter to my Mom.

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:14.260
You trying to be white.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:16.106
Do you think you're
better than all of us?

00:14:16.106 --> 00:14:16.980
You going to college?

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:19.629
You ain't better than us.

00:14:19.629 --> 00:14:20.670
Took my car away from me.

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:25.480
I went to my Father.

00:14:25.480 --> 00:14:28.560
I showed him this
acceptance letter.

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:33.374
He Stole a U-Haul truck,
took me to Nebraska.

00:14:33.374 --> 00:14:35.540
Now, when you're 17 years
old, you get a credit card

00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.700
in the mail for a $500 limit.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:42.519
We used that credit card to
put gas in the U-Haul truck

00:14:42.519 --> 00:14:43.310
to get to Nebraska.

00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:45.620
I had nothing in the back
of a big U-Haul truck

00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:47.780
with a cornstalk
symbol on the side.

00:14:47.780 --> 00:14:50.297
I had some Air Force 1s,
a Michigan State visor,

00:14:50.297 --> 00:14:51.380
and a few white t-shirts--

00:14:51.380 --> 00:14:53.190
I didn't know-- what's the
weather like in Nebraska?

00:14:53.190 --> 00:14:53.690
Who knows?

00:14:57.340 --> 00:14:59.000
We took off.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:01.000
15 minutes before we
pulled up to Wayne State,

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.440
my dad was telling
me, man, you've

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.750
already accomplished more
than anybody in this family.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:06.541
There's really nothing
else I can tell you,

00:15:06.541 --> 00:15:13.250
but I wanted to let you know
that Howard University--

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.000
excuse me, I might get
emotional about it.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.350
But he said, Howard
University sent that letter.

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:21.230
And they didn't accept you.

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:24.336
And I didn't show it
to you, because I knew

00:15:24.336 --> 00:15:25.460
you'd be like your cousins.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:26.990
I knew you'd be
like your brothers.

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:28.760
I knew you would give up.

00:15:28.760 --> 00:15:32.980
I knew it would be
devastating to you.

00:15:32.980 --> 00:15:36.790
That was one of the best things
anybody had ever done to me.

00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.144
So when I graduated
college at Wayne State,

00:15:39.144 --> 00:15:41.060
I come back to Chicago,
and start volunteering

00:15:41.060 --> 00:15:42.499
in a Cook Count Jail.

00:15:42.499 --> 00:15:44.040
Because I'm a graduate
of alternative

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:46.280
high school, and
going to college

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.780
was exposure that I needed.

00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:50.870
It showed me the world doesn't
end at the corner of my block.

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:52.935
We can dream bigger
than our surroundings.

00:15:55.610 --> 00:15:58.080
We work with 120 kids
from the lowest performing

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.950
schools in Chicago--

00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.419
the lowest performing.

00:16:02.419 --> 00:16:03.710
We say, what do you want to be?

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.043
They say, I want to be a rapper.

00:16:05.043 --> 00:16:07.560
I want to be a
basketball player.

00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.000
We take them to Gatorade.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:10.860
They talk to them about
consumer engagement.

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.050
They never knew that job existed
prior to that educational field

00:16:14.050 --> 00:16:15.940
trip.

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:17.700
We take them to Google.

00:16:17.700 --> 00:16:20.530
And we use VR goggles.

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:24.780
We get to explore places
through the Expedition Program.

00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:26.330
They're getting
hands-on experience

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:29.520
with people like Roberto,
and the other people here.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:30.940
That is powerful.

00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:33.832
They know it's possible
now, because of our program.

00:16:33.832 --> 00:16:35.040
Thank you guys for having me.

00:16:44.660 --> 00:16:45.910
JEN WESLEY: Thank you, Jahmal.

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:46.630
That was--

00:16:46.630 --> 00:16:47.588
JAHMAL COLE: Thank you.

00:16:47.588 --> 00:16:48.750
JEN WESLEY: --very moving.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:49.330
JAHMAL COLE: Thank you.

00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:50.890
JEN WESLEY: I really
appreciate you coming today.

00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:52.306
JAHMAL COLE: Thanks
for having me.

00:16:52.306 --> 00:16:54.130
JEN WESLEY: Roberto
and the whole team

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.480
here has been thinking
a lot about My Block,

00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.380
My Hood, My City.

00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.940
And we're excited
to hear your story.

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:00.601
The timing couldn't
be more perfect,

00:17:00.601 --> 00:17:02.350
with your book just
coming out this week--

00:17:02.350 --> 00:17:03.440
or was it last week?

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.065
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah,
it was Saturday, so,

00:17:05.065 --> 00:17:06.319
yeah, it just came out.

00:17:06.319 --> 00:17:09.109
JEN WESLEY: You can download
this on Google Play,

00:17:09.109 --> 00:17:10.890
as well as keep your
copy from today.

00:17:10.890 --> 00:17:11.952
JAHMAL COLE: Cool.

00:17:11.952 --> 00:17:13.660
JEN WESLEY: I was
really moved by hearing

00:17:13.660 --> 00:17:17.109
your story about college
acceptance and rejection.

00:17:17.109 --> 00:17:19.780
And one of the things you
talk about in your book

00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:22.180
is, how many grants
you've had to apply for

00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:24.087
as you started My
Block, My Hood, My City.

00:17:24.087 --> 00:17:26.170
I'm wondering if you could
talk to us a little bit

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:28.750
about the story of
resilience that you

00:17:28.750 --> 00:17:31.524
explain in this-- in the
book-- getting the rejection,

00:17:31.524 --> 00:17:33.690
being able to, not even
read more than one sentence,

00:17:33.690 --> 00:17:35.815
and know where it's going,
and how you bounced back

00:17:35.815 --> 00:17:38.010
and keep going with your vision.

00:17:38.010 --> 00:17:39.850
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah, so when you--

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:41.350
it's hard to write
grants, you know?

00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:42.770
You don't know what they want.

00:17:42.770 --> 00:17:46.360
And just because you started
a program doesn't mean

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.735
you know how to write out a
mission statement perfectly,

00:17:51.735 --> 00:17:54.767
or you know how to track
the data perfectly.

00:17:54.767 --> 00:17:55.850
God's working through you.

00:17:55.850 --> 00:17:57.870
And you have a vision,
but for grants, they

00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:59.975
want copy-pastable data.

00:17:59.975 --> 00:18:02.100
And so, yeah, I got turned
down by a lot of grants.

00:18:02.100 --> 00:18:05.105
But when they start sending
me the email saying,

00:18:05.105 --> 00:18:07.480
hey, you're not going to get
this grant, I just started--

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.920
I recognized, you
know, this oh, they're

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.044
not going to give it to me.

00:18:10.044 --> 00:18:13.525
But you know what,
it's inconsequential.

00:18:13.525 --> 00:18:16.030
It doesn't make a lot of--
it doesn't make a difference

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:18.340
to me, because I sell hoodies.

00:18:18.340 --> 00:18:19.240
I sell t-shirts.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:21.740
And I use that money to
take kids around the city.

00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:26.787
So people recognize
that exposure is key.

00:18:26.787 --> 00:18:28.620
And the power will
travel as transformative.

00:18:28.620 --> 00:18:30.300
And I will stand Downtown
in front of Foot Locker

00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:31.050
and sell t-shirts.

00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:33.990
I will do whatever I got to do
to get these teenagers access

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:35.010
to opportunities.

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:38.060
And one thing I've learned,
if you do what you love to do,

00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.200
you organically build
relationships that

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:43.120
will help you be successful.

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.390
JEN WESLEY: So you take
kids outside of Chicago,

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.250
as well as into Chicago.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:50.630
You've been everywhere from
Lake Michigan, to DC, to Ghana.

00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:51.750
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah, yeah.

00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:52.500
JEN WESLEY: And
do you personally

00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.610
go on all those trips?

00:18:53.610 --> 00:18:54.150
JAHMAL COLE: I do.

00:18:54.150 --> 00:18:55.390
I do, but we're
getting bigger now,

00:18:55.390 --> 00:18:57.150
so I don't get to go on
as many as I'd like to.

00:18:57.150 --> 00:18:58.720
And it's hard for me
to let go of my babies.

00:18:58.720 --> 00:18:59.300
I love them.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:00.770
But it has to happen.

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:04.860
We have 120 to 150 kids right
now, that we serve per month.

00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:08.580
But yeah, so we take
kids to the Greektown.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.880
And we'll explore the National
Hellenic Museum, or the Athena

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.990
Greek Restaurant.

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:15.840
And we might visit, you know,
Havas Worldwide International,

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.450
you know, advertising firm.

00:19:17.450 --> 00:19:20.590
And one of the kids said, the
only Greek food he ever tasted

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:22.030
was a gyro from Aldi's.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.690
You know, and so it's
like, that's the only--

00:19:24.690 --> 00:19:27.360
and again, when they
get Downtown Chicago,

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:28.579
they've never, like--

00:19:28.579 --> 00:19:30.370
the elevators that are
here with no buttons

00:19:30.370 --> 00:19:32.245
on the elevator, that'd
just blow their mind.

00:19:32.245 --> 00:19:35.500
They'd be like, hey, there's
no buttons on the elevator.

00:19:35.500 --> 00:19:38.310
The things we take for
granted are fish-out-of-water

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:41.010
experiences for teenagers
from under-resourced Chicago

00:19:41.010 --> 00:19:41.942
communities.

00:19:41.942 --> 00:19:43.360
JEN WESLEY: That's awesome.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.090
So one of the
things you mentioned

00:19:45.090 --> 00:19:48.420
is the idea of expanding
your world view.

00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:49.170
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah.

00:19:49.170 --> 00:19:52.440
JEN WESLEY: And the truth is
that a lot of people at Google,

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:56.250
surprisingly, we need to
expand our world view, as well.

00:19:56.250 --> 00:20:00.110
We get very comfortable
in the bubble that

00:20:00.110 --> 00:20:03.450
is working in the West Loop,
without even any traffic,

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:05.270
and access to lunch--

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:07.610
I mean, definitely a
different experience

00:20:07.610 --> 00:20:10.780
than the kids you're spending
time with, and taking

00:20:10.780 --> 00:20:12.140
around Chicago.

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.760
What would be your
recommendation to our team,

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.760
so that they could get--
expand their world view,

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.949
and get exposure themselves?

00:20:18.949 --> 00:20:20.990
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah, to
truly make our city better,

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.290
we need more people to explore
communities outside their own,

00:20:24.290 --> 00:20:24.950
right?

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:26.130
It is not true.

00:20:26.130 --> 00:20:30.680
A lot of things in the media
get said to sell papers.

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.290
There's 2.7 million
people in Chicago.

00:20:34.290 --> 00:20:35.960
We know that there's
1,200 people that's

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.500
doing the shooting,
doing the violence.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.212
The most dangerous streets,
like 79th Street, that they say

00:20:42.212 --> 00:20:44.170
is dangerous, I jog down
that street every day.

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:47.119
And say hi to my
neighbors every day.

00:20:47.119 --> 00:20:47.910
It's just not true.

00:20:47.910 --> 00:20:49.970
You have to have an
appetite for adventure.

00:20:49.970 --> 00:20:53.810
Just like you would
study hard for an exam,

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:58.310
or you would exercise, you
have to exercise your empathy

00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.690
towards the suffering of
other people in Chicago.

00:21:00.690 --> 00:21:03.110
And once we do that, we'll
stop seeing ourselves

00:21:03.110 --> 00:21:06.180
as part of 77 different
community areas.

00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:08.360
And we'll see ourselves as
part of a greater whole,

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:09.650
and one Chicago.

00:21:09.650 --> 00:21:11.900
JEN WESLEY: I like that idea
of exercising your muscle

00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:15.747
to go and see other things,
and do different things.

00:21:15.747 --> 00:21:17.330
I think you also,
you have a daughter.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:19.070
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah, a
six-year-old daughter, yup.

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:20.819
She's six, going on
25, but, yeah, she's--

00:21:20.819 --> 00:21:22.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:22.550 --> 00:21:25.119
She's already using the virtual
reality goggles from Google,

00:21:25.119 --> 00:21:27.410
so shout out to Google for
those, because she does it--

00:21:27.410 --> 00:21:29.560
JEN WESLEY: If you keep her with
the virtual reality glasses,

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:31.250
she won't leave
you, so that's good.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:32.330
JAHMAL COLE: Oh
Lord, every night--

00:21:32.330 --> 00:21:34.080
I'm, like, trying to watch
the Cubs game last night.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.240
She's like, I want
to do the goggles.

00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:36.755
I'm like, no,
Zobrist is up to bat.

00:21:36.755 --> 00:21:37.160
Chill out.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:37.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:40.056
But it is what it is.

00:21:40.056 --> 00:21:41.180
JEN WESLEY: That's awesome.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:43.650
Six years old, and she knows
how to use virtual reality.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:44.740
You're on the right track.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:46.020
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah,
she's amazing.

00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.840
She's teaching me how
to be a better Pops.

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:50.390
And I'm-- yeah, I'm blessed.

00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.999
I'm blessed.

00:21:50.999 --> 00:21:52.040
JEN WESLEY: That's great.

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:55.967
Well, we were reading
your Twitter feed,

00:21:55.967 --> 00:21:58.550
so that's how I get to know your
daughter was, and everything.

00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:00.560
But one of the things
that you talked about

00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:03.620
is, just this
notion that we have

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:06.710
to look around the corner,
wherever we are, and get

00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:08.451
into every part of our city.

00:22:08.451 --> 00:22:09.200
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah.

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.890
JEN WESLEY: What would
you say is the place,

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:12.520
or the trip that
you've taken the kids

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.180
on that really changed--

00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.079
had the biggest impact on you.

00:22:16.079 --> 00:22:17.620
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah,
I would say that--

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.220
we take them to the
homeless shelters.

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:26.137
And we give back, first.

00:22:26.137 --> 00:22:27.970
That's always the best
exploration for them,

00:22:27.970 --> 00:22:29.845
because we're giving
them stuff all the time,

00:22:29.845 --> 00:22:31.750
taking them places,
paying for food for them.

00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:33.124
But at the beginning
of the year,

00:22:33.124 --> 00:22:35.960
we always take them all to
give back, and pass out food

00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.760
at Catholic Charities.

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:41.170
And you know, I grew
up homeless, you know?

00:22:41.170 --> 00:22:42.924
And so I know what
it's like to--

00:22:42.924 --> 00:22:45.340
I didn't know what volunteer
groups were when I was a kid,

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.970
but I just knew the
people behind the counter

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:51.550
at Thanksgiving at the shelter
that were giving me food,

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:53.710
they were very nice people.

00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:56.060
And I said, when I get older,
I want to be like that.

00:22:56.060 --> 00:22:58.175
And so I just
remember being really

00:22:58.175 --> 00:23:00.550
embarrassed at that time of,
like, you know, high school.

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:01.765
People would see me.

00:23:01.765 --> 00:23:02.890
And they'd be volunteering.

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.630
But I'd take the food.

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:06.360
But anyway, when I
got older, I said

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.870
that that's a meaningful
deposit into your life.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:11.370
And so I want teenagers to know
what it's like to give back.

00:23:11.370 --> 00:23:13.275
So that's-- they
always say, hey,

00:23:13.275 --> 00:23:15.400
this is my favorite
exploration, because, you know,

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:18.341
I realize that homeless people
aren't-- they've fallen on bad

00:23:18.341 --> 00:23:18.840
times.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:20.450
It's not like they
asked to be homeless.

00:23:20.450 --> 00:23:22.450
They actually could have
been-- had a great job,

00:23:22.450 --> 00:23:23.200
and been laid off.

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:25.120
And now their family
has no place to stay,

00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.410
So they get to develop
empathy, and we--

00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:29.650
by going to give back.

00:23:29.650 --> 00:23:30.980
JEN WESLEY: That was an
interesting part of the story

00:23:30.980 --> 00:23:33.021
when, you talked about
taking the kids to Uptown,

00:23:33.021 --> 00:23:36.190
to show them that the Northside
wasn't just this vision they

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:37.479
had created in their minds.

00:23:37.479 --> 00:23:39.770
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah, Uptown
looks like the hood at night.

00:23:39.770 --> 00:23:42.730
I mean, if anybody has
been to Uptown, it's a--

00:23:42.730 --> 00:23:45.049
Chicago is a city of blocks.

00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:46.840
You now, block-by-block,
things can change.

00:23:46.840 --> 00:23:49.630
But at the same time, the
people under the bridge--

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:51.010
the bridges in Uptown--

00:23:51.010 --> 00:23:52.540
you know, they need our support.

00:23:52.540 --> 00:23:57.040
And so what's happening
on Wilson Avenue,

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:59.080
that matters to me, even
though I live on 79th.

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.079
You see what I'm saying?

00:24:00.079 --> 00:24:02.500
Like, what's happening
in Pilsen matters

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:06.070
to me, even if I live
in Chatham, right?

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:07.950
Those things are interconnected.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.136
And so I want to get
people to think that way.

00:24:10.136 --> 00:24:12.295
JEN WESLEY: Well, I think
it's working, for sure.

00:24:12.295 --> 00:24:15.062
From what we read in your
book, and what you said today.

00:24:15.062 --> 00:24:16.020
JAHMAL COLE: Thank you.

00:24:16.020 --> 00:24:17.400
JEN WESLEY: One of the areas
I wanted to ask you about

00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.750
is, part of this
journey for you--

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.208
I mean, this isn't
your first book.

00:24:20.208 --> 00:24:21.606
You've written six-- is it six?

00:24:21.606 --> 00:24:22.770
Is this the sixth
one, or the fifth one?

00:24:22.770 --> 00:24:23.380
JAHMAL COLE: That's
the fifth one-- yeah--

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:23.410
JEN WESLEY: OK,

00:24:23.410 --> 00:24:24.190
JAHMAL COLE: --fifth one.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:25.650
JEN WESLEY: --so, six is coming.

00:24:25.650 --> 00:24:27.662
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah, sure.

00:24:27.662 --> 00:24:30.120
JEN WESLEY: You've spent a few
years of your life dedicated

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.390
to My Block, My Hood, My City.

00:24:31.390 --> 00:24:33.370
And you quit your job to do it.

00:24:33.370 --> 00:24:34.140
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah.

00:24:34.140 --> 00:24:36.270
JEN WESLEY: What's the
hardest thing about that?

00:24:36.270 --> 00:24:39.210
JAHMAL COLE: It's tough,
man, when you have to sell--

00:24:39.210 --> 00:24:41.740
stand Downtown to sell books
to pay bills for your family.

00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:42.656
You know, I'm married.

00:24:42.656 --> 00:24:44.370
I got a daughter of six.

00:24:44.370 --> 00:24:46.700
And I've got to stand out
in front of Foot Locker,

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:48.660
and do what I got to do.

00:24:48.660 --> 00:24:50.520
It's tough when your
water bill goes off.

00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.680
And you've got to watch
your wife go next door,

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.120
and connect the other
neighbor's hose--

00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.880
a hose to the neighbor's
water, and put--

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:58.600
that sucks.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.520
Like, it sucks.

00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:00.940
Like, it really does.

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:06.725
But I got tired of
hearing gunshots.

00:25:06.725 --> 00:25:07.600
You know what I mean?

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.200
I got tired of it.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.740
I'm jaded from hearing
people make promises.

00:25:11.740 --> 00:25:14.170
Like, what's
something simple I can

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:17.530
do that will make a
positive impact on my block?

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:20.160
And how can that send ripple
effects through the city?

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.780
So my wife knows who I am.

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.620
My heroes are, like,
Robert Kennedy,

00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:27.170
Malcolm X, Martin Luther
King Jr. They gave

00:25:27.170 --> 00:25:29.190
their life for what they love.

00:25:29.190 --> 00:25:33.440
They gave their life for it,
so if I have to risk my home,

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:38.560
if I have to risk
stability, if I have to be--

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:40.790
risk wearing some nice
shoes in front of people,

00:25:40.790 --> 00:25:43.070
and keeping up with the
Joneses, I don't care.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.510
In this short moment
of life that I got,

00:25:46.510 --> 00:25:48.730
I'm going to do my best
to give teenagers access

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.529
to opportunities.

00:25:50.529 --> 00:25:52.320
JEN WESLEY: That's
amazing, very inspiring.

00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:53.130
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:53.790
JEN WESLEY: I'm
going to just let

00:25:53.790 --> 00:25:55.248
people know, if
you have questions,

00:25:55.248 --> 00:25:58.050
this would be a time to
think of them, and get ready.

00:25:58.050 --> 00:26:00.600
My last question for
you is, what's next?

00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.770
This is an amazing moment.

00:26:01.770 --> 00:26:02.894
You're launching your book.

00:26:02.894 --> 00:26:05.185
And we're here to
help you, so tell us

00:26:05.185 --> 00:26:09.100
how-- what your vision is, and
how we can be part of that.

00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:12.770
JAHMAL COLE: Well, I want to see
my seniors graduate this year.

00:26:12.770 --> 00:26:14.500
This is the first
cohort of seniors

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.930
that we're going to have.

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.381
And they want to
go to Notre Dame.

00:26:18.381 --> 00:26:19.630
You know, they want to go to--

00:26:19.630 --> 00:26:20.170
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:20.170 --> 00:26:20.961
JAHMAL COLE: --LSU.

00:26:20.961 --> 00:26:21.544
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.040
And I'm going to them there.

00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.560
And you know, we
went from 60 students

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:32.515
last year, to having
close to 150 right now.

00:26:32.515 --> 00:26:34.390
There's a block and a
hood everywhere, right?

00:26:34.390 --> 00:26:37.709
So how can we get My Block, My
Hood, My City in Panama, right?

00:26:37.709 --> 00:26:39.500
How can we get it in
Harlem Public Schools?

00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:41.650
How can we get in Compton
Public Schools, right?

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:51.290
When I say, if you show somebody
better, they'll do better.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:53.630
That's just not a catch phrase.

00:26:53.630 --> 00:26:56.930
What we know intuitively
is backed by a wealth

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.550
of youth development research.

00:26:58.550 --> 00:27:02.150
And that suggests that
neighborhoods impact teenagers

00:27:02.150 --> 00:27:04.040
through exposure-based
influences and forces.

00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.192
So exposure to institutions
and organizations,

00:27:07.192 --> 00:27:09.650
and the quality of safety of
them-- that's a key mechanism,

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:14.090
and through which neighborhoods
impact youth outcomes.

00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:18.160
And so I want to continue to
show the world that, hey, these

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:19.210
are not just field trips.

00:27:19.210 --> 00:27:22.270
These are educational
explorations,

00:27:22.270 --> 00:27:24.670
in which we're making meaningful
deposits into kids life.

00:27:24.670 --> 00:27:26.086
And when they come
out of it, they

00:27:26.086 --> 00:27:28.450
can say, hey, I want
to work at Google.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.490
There's, 15 minutes
away from here,

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.270
kids ordering food through
bulletproof glass right now.

00:27:34.270 --> 00:27:36.190
They don't know Google is here.

00:27:36.190 --> 00:27:38.140
They don't know these
elevators are here.

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.494
They don't know that this is--

00:27:40.494 --> 00:27:42.160
and when I take them
into the West Loop,

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:43.410
they look over their shoulder.

00:27:43.410 --> 00:27:45.190
And they're like,
wow, like, I don't--

00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:46.315
I don't have to be fearful.

00:27:46.315 --> 00:27:48.580
Do you know how hard it is
to go to school if you have

00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.927
to worry about being shot down.

00:27:49.927 --> 00:27:52.510
Can you-- like, why do we even
grade people on the same scale.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:53.574
How-- what is--

00:27:53.574 --> 00:27:54.740
does that make sense to you?

00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:55.906
It doesn't make sense to me.

00:27:55.906 --> 00:27:58.900
How can a kid do well on the
ACT if they've never been

00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:02.967
exposed to a ACT practice test.

00:28:02.967 --> 00:28:03.550
So I want to--

00:28:03.550 --> 00:28:04.950
I think exposure
is key, not just

00:28:04.950 --> 00:28:07.530
for inner cities of
Chicago, but inner cities

00:28:07.530 --> 00:28:09.030
throughout the country.

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:10.170
JEN WESLEY: Well, one of
the things we'd like to do

00:28:10.170 --> 00:28:11.794
is be part of more
of your expeditions.

00:28:11.794 --> 00:28:13.429
So I know we talked
before today,

00:28:13.429 --> 00:28:14.970
but we're going to
schedule sometimes

00:28:14.970 --> 00:28:16.820
for Googlers to go on
expeditions with you,

00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:20.690
and bring your kids here,
as well throughout the year,

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:21.960
so that'll be exciting.

00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:22.380
JAHMAL COLE: Thank you.

00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:23.550
Thank you-- anybody
want to join,

00:28:23.550 --> 00:28:24.750
you guys are
definitely welcome too.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.220
We need-- the kids
need exposure.

00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.650
And they need to meet
mentors, role models

00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:29.912
like you all, so thank you.

00:28:29.912 --> 00:28:31.620
JEN WESLEY: Any
questions from the group.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:32.780
I have one more.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:34.155
AUDIENCE: Just
building on that--

00:28:34.155 --> 00:28:34.780
I was curious.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:37.380
I have a son in pre-school,
and one in fifth grade,

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:39.460
who I would love to bring
on expeditions, too.

00:28:39.460 --> 00:28:42.780
So are you thinking this
as [INAUDIBLE] or can we--

00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:43.780
JAHMAL COLE: Absolutely.

00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:45.670
Absolutely, Codi
Tranel is in back.

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.290
She's is our Chief
Operating Officer.

00:28:47.290 --> 00:28:48.956
Just make sure you
grab one of our cards

00:28:48.956 --> 00:28:51.820
before we leave, because that
is-- we always bring chaperones

00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.920
on the explorations,
just because we want

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.020
to know your world
view, and hear

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:57.834
about your story of
how you got to Google.

00:28:57.834 --> 00:28:59.500
A lot of times, things
aren't so linear,

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.970
where people, just,
hey, I went to college,

00:29:00.970 --> 00:29:02.803
got my Master's degree,
got hired at Google.

00:29:02.803 --> 00:29:04.632
Some people got here
through other means.

00:29:04.632 --> 00:29:06.340
And that's great
knowledge for teenagers,

00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.650
because they can
realize that they

00:29:08.650 --> 00:29:11.156
don't have to fit in
some kind of certain mold

00:29:11.156 --> 00:29:12.280
that society tells them to.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.450
So yeah, that would be great.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:14.410
Just get-- grab a card.

00:29:14.410 --> 00:29:15.784
We want to get
your information--

00:29:15.784 --> 00:29:18.597
anybody that wants to go
on explorations can do it.

00:29:18.597 --> 00:29:24.792
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
or anything

00:29:24.792 --> 00:29:27.125
you might need help with?

00:29:27.125 --> 00:29:28.110
JAHMAL COLE: Funding.

00:29:28.110 --> 00:29:30.229
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:30.229 --> 00:29:32.770
Funding, you know, that comes,
if you're doing what you love.

00:29:32.770 --> 00:29:40.000
I think the biggest
problem is, we--

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:45.390
what we're doing
essentially is studying

00:29:45.390 --> 00:29:49.440
can we use the power of travel
to defibrillate a kid back

00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.300
to having hope?

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.570
You see, that hasn't been done.

00:29:54.570 --> 00:29:57.200
So the metrics that
are out there--

00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:02.360
attendance rates, GPA, in-school
suspension, graduation rate,

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:04.760
college persistence-- these
are great things to track.

00:30:04.760 --> 00:30:08.570
But we're talking about is,
will the power of travel

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:12.380
have a impact on
a teenager's life.

00:30:12.380 --> 00:30:14.410
Long-term, are we
making better citizens?

00:30:14.410 --> 00:30:17.690
So it would be helpful to
work with more companies,

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:20.630
to be able to
track data, to work

00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:24.210
with people with that study
these things, so that we can--

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.980
we don't know we
don't know, right?

00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.930
And so it's-- we need support.

00:30:27.930 --> 00:30:30.502
But also, having a
company like Google say,

00:30:30.502 --> 00:30:31.710
hey, this is a great program.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:33.281
That really helps us out a lot.

00:30:33.281 --> 00:30:35.030
JEN WESLEY: And you're
working with some--

00:30:35.030 --> 00:30:36.446
at the University
of Chicago to do

00:30:36.446 --> 00:30:37.655
some of that studying, right?

00:30:37.655 --> 00:30:38.695
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah, we do.

00:30:38.695 --> 00:30:40.460
We work with the
University of Chicago.

00:30:40.460 --> 00:30:45.050
We work with-- unofficially, the
Crime Lab has been helping us

00:30:45.050 --> 00:30:48.230
create pre-surveys and
post-surveys for our students,

00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:49.940
so we can track if they--

00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:52.190
how comfortable do you
feel in your own community?

00:30:52.190 --> 00:30:54.489
How connected do
you feel to Chicago?

00:30:54.489 --> 00:30:56.030
Do you even know
your community name?

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:57.770
You know, a lot of
our students do not--

00:30:57.770 --> 00:31:01.940
like, 75% of our students
don't know what community area

00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:03.290
they live in.

00:31:03.290 --> 00:31:05.929
At the end of our program,
100% know what community

00:31:05.929 --> 00:31:06.470
they live in.

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:08.600
And they know the hidden
gems in their community.

00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:09.920
They know the
artful intersections

00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:10.711
in their community.

00:31:10.711 --> 00:31:12.080
They know the community roots.

00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.700
They know how to contact
their local official.

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:15.170
They know the faith-based
organizations.

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.300
We are building better
citizens through My Block,

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:19.692
My Hood, My City, with
the help of people

00:31:19.692 --> 00:31:20.900
that are way smarter than me.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:28.030
JEN WESLEY: Any other questions?

00:31:28.030 --> 00:31:29.280
JAHMAL COLE: How're you doing?

00:31:29.280 --> 00:31:30.821
AUDIENCE: Hi, can
you talk more about

00:31:30.821 --> 00:31:33.330
how you find students
who are in the program?

00:31:33.330 --> 00:31:34.962
And how long are they involved?

00:31:34.962 --> 00:31:36.845
Is it like, they go
on one expedition?

00:31:36.845 --> 00:31:38.992
Or are they in there
for all high school--

00:31:38.992 --> 00:31:39.812
that sort of thing?

00:31:39.812 --> 00:31:42.270
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah, so initially,
we wanted to work with a--

00:31:42.270 --> 00:31:43.770
I went to a alternative
school, so I

00:31:43.770 --> 00:31:46.140
wanted to work with
students that had--

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:47.310
that were a Level 3 school.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:50.340
So Chicago rates schools
Level 1, Level 2, Level 3

00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:52.050
with a school quality
rating report.

00:31:52.050 --> 00:31:54.220
And schools that have
lower than 80% attendance,

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:56.850
and a low graduation
rate, they are--

00:31:56.850 --> 00:31:57.940
they fall at Level 3.

00:32:00.307 --> 00:32:01.890
The issue was, going
to those schools,

00:32:01.890 --> 00:32:03.134
and finding students that--

00:32:03.134 --> 00:32:04.550
you know, that was
our threshold--

00:32:04.550 --> 00:32:05.880
80% attendance.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.820
The problem is that, if a
school has 2,500 capacity,

00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.520
and there's only 130 kids
that go to the whole school,

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:14.235
and of those 130 kids there's
only a 58% attendance rate,

00:32:14.235 --> 00:32:16.110
than the school-- the
students are struggling

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:18.730
through all this data, right?

00:32:18.730 --> 00:32:20.442
And so we had to
go to the schools,

00:32:20.442 --> 00:32:22.650
and work with the principals
and assistant principals

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:24.960
to find out who is
the most disconnected,

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.840
and who can we connect to more
opportunities in the city?

00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:30.430
And so, yes, it's a
program where you're

00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:32.530
in our program for four years.

00:32:32.530 --> 00:32:35.910
So if you start a freshmen, you
take 12 explorations that year.

00:32:35.910 --> 00:32:37.540
By senior year,
when you graduate,

00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:39.820
you've been exposed to
48 different professions.

00:32:39.820 --> 00:32:41.340
And you have 48
different options

00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:43.170
to choose from besides violence.

00:32:43.170 --> 00:32:44.970
You might say, I want
to be a chiropractor,

00:32:44.970 --> 00:32:47.490
or I might want to do
Microsoft engineering.

00:32:47.490 --> 00:32:49.230
I might want to work at a bank.

00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:51.439
We expose them to 48
different professions

00:32:51.439 --> 00:32:53.230
throughout their entire
high school career.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.000
JEN WESLEY: So just to
clarify-- so there's data

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.590
that you look at, but sometimes
the data can't even tell you

00:32:58.590 --> 00:33:01.550
who are the kids who need
the emotional support

00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:02.305
and connection.

00:33:02.305 --> 00:33:05.217
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah,
because data is important.

00:33:05.217 --> 00:33:05.925
And data matters.

00:33:05.925 --> 00:33:07.920
I was going to wear a shirt
today that said data matters,

00:33:07.920 --> 00:33:08.910
but I was, like, you know,
I'm going to wear My Block,

00:33:08.910 --> 00:33:09.445
My Hood, My City.

00:33:09.445 --> 00:33:11.570
JEN WESLEY: You don't have
to wear that shirt here.

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:13.418
We know.

00:33:13.418 --> 00:33:14.850
JAHMAL COLE: It does.

00:33:14.850 --> 00:33:15.810
It matters so much.

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:17.940
It matters so much to funders.

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:19.802
And they want to see the data.

00:33:19.802 --> 00:33:21.010
Let me tell you this, though.

00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.330
Kids believe in me.

00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:27.580
And that's why they come back.

00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:29.130
They believe in my staff.

00:33:29.130 --> 00:33:30.600
That's why they come back.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:34.090
Because what the
data doesn't say,

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:38.810
is that when the
[INAUDIBLE],, when

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:42.690
Deonte, when their
lights go off,

00:33:42.690 --> 00:33:45.780
when their phone goes off, when
they don't got no ride at 2:00

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.750
in the morning, are you going
to show up for them or not?

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:50.550
The data doesn't say that.

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:51.450
Guess what?

00:33:51.450 --> 00:33:54.460
But having empathy
says, go do that.

00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.460
And that's why they show
back up to our program.

00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:59.070
We have a 100% retention
rate in our program.

00:33:59.070 --> 00:34:00.154
Students come back to my--

00:34:00.154 --> 00:34:01.153
they're recruiting kids.

00:34:01.153 --> 00:34:02.530
And we say, we can only take 15.

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:04.080
There's 70 kids per
school that wants

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.246
to be a part of our program.

00:34:05.246 --> 00:34:07.400
They know we'll
be there for them.

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.980
And everybody that's a part
of My Block, My Hood, My City,

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:12.296
they have those same values.

00:34:12.296 --> 00:34:14.245
JEN WESLEY: That's
very meaningful to us,

00:34:14.245 --> 00:34:15.620
because we look
at a lot of data.

00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.500
But at the end of the day,
relationships, commitment,

00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:21.280
and empathy are really
what makes things happen,

00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:22.400
so that's awesome.

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.441
JAHMAL COLE: I love that.

00:34:23.441 --> 00:34:24.817
I love how you said that.

00:34:24.817 --> 00:34:26.900
JEN WESLEY: I think we
even have some visitors who

00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.919
came in while we were talking.

00:34:27.919 --> 00:34:28.710
JAHMAL COLE: I saw.

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:30.380
I saw-- how you all doing?

00:34:30.380 --> 00:34:32.067
JEN WESLEY: Who joined us?

00:34:32.067 --> 00:34:33.150
JAHMAL COLE: I'm not sure.

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:33.691
I'm not sure.

00:34:33.691 --> 00:34:35.908
JEN WESLEY: Was there
students in that group?

00:34:35.908 --> 00:34:36.408
I think.

00:34:36.408 --> 00:34:37.118
AUDIENCE: From Namaste.

00:34:37.118 --> 00:34:37.591
JEN WESLEY: Ah.

00:34:37.591 --> 00:34:38.064
JAHMAL COLE: They're
from Namaste.

00:34:38.064 --> 00:34:39.320
JEN WESLEY: From Namaste, yeah.

00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:39.830
JAHMAL COLE: How is it going?

00:34:39.830 --> 00:34:40.070
I love that school.

00:34:40.070 --> 00:34:41.530
JEN WESLEY: I thought it
was from My Block, My Hood.

00:34:41.530 --> 00:34:41.920
But we can--

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.461
JAHMAL COLE: No, we can get--
we would love to be at Namaste,

00:34:44.461 --> 00:34:46.449
but your guys' waiting
list is so long.

00:34:46.449 --> 00:34:48.425
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:50.572 --> 00:34:52.780
AUDIENCE: So, Jahmal, thank
you for being here today.

00:34:52.780 --> 00:34:55.889
I'm learning an incredible
amount about what you guys do.

00:34:55.889 --> 00:35:00.067
And I realize we
can do a lot more.

00:35:00.067 --> 00:35:01.900
One of the things that
strikes me are that I

00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.470
love your perspective on--

00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:09.900
you used-- you overcame
a lot in your story.

00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.650
And one of the biggest
things you overcame

00:35:11.650 --> 00:35:16.540
was the people who you
love, and support you--

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:23.460
still support you-- but
also said, are you too good?

00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:26.490
Are you-- what are you
trying to do, right?

00:35:26.490 --> 00:35:29.986
How do you think about
helping other kids who

00:35:29.986 --> 00:35:31.110
are in that same situation?

00:35:31.110 --> 00:35:34.550
Because when they're with you,
when they're with the group,

00:35:34.550 --> 00:35:36.510
I imagine they feel terrific.

00:35:36.510 --> 00:35:39.540
But then there are so
many individual moments

00:35:39.540 --> 00:35:44.680
where they have to have the
resolve, the courage, strength,

00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:48.057
the things you did, to say,
if I didn't get into Howard,

00:35:48.057 --> 00:35:49.140
I'll get somewhere, right?

00:35:49.140 --> 00:35:50.350
I mean, and you kept going.

00:35:50.350 --> 00:35:52.350
Like, how do you
think about instilling

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:53.490
that kind of perseverance?

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:58.590
Because I imagine you see it a
lot more, in kids everywhere.

00:35:58.590 --> 00:36:00.585
But it also--

00:36:00.585 --> 00:36:01.314
I don't know.

00:36:01.314 --> 00:36:03.480
It's hard to actually think
about how to really give

00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.070
somebody that kind of strength.

00:36:07.070 --> 00:36:10.790
JAHMAL COLE: It's-- do
it through storytelling.

00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:13.546
You tell a kid, hey,
there's a salesman.

00:36:13.546 --> 00:36:14.420
There's two salesmen.

00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:16.350
And it's raining
really bad outside.

00:36:16.350 --> 00:36:17.910
You know, one salesman
looks outside.

00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:19.993
And he says, hey, you know,
it's raining real bad.

00:36:19.993 --> 00:36:22.680
With weather like this,
the boss can't expect me

00:36:22.680 --> 00:36:24.150
to go outside and make sales.

00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:25.279
So he stays home, right?

00:36:25.279 --> 00:36:27.195
And then the other
salesman, he looks outside.

00:36:27.195 --> 00:36:27.990
He sees a storm.

00:36:27.990 --> 00:36:29.845
He says, man, it's
raining real bad.

00:36:29.845 --> 00:36:31.582
With weather like
this, what a great day

00:36:31.582 --> 00:36:33.540
to go outside and make
sales, because everybody

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.050
is going to be home,
especially the sales people.

00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:38.550
And so I tell the teenagers,
it's the same thing in Chicago.

00:36:38.550 --> 00:36:41.709
Because some people say,
man, the city is messed up.

00:36:41.709 --> 00:36:42.750
The weather is messed up.

00:36:42.750 --> 00:36:43.959
The politicians is messed up.

00:36:43.959 --> 00:36:45.416
They're not going
to go to college.

00:36:45.416 --> 00:36:47.730
Whereas there are other
kids, same North Lawndale

00:36:47.730 --> 00:36:48.425
community-- they're
going to say,

00:36:48.425 --> 00:36:49.650
man, the city is messed up.

00:36:49.650 --> 00:36:50.550
The weather is messed up.

00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:51.320
The police is messed up.

00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.028
And they're still
going to go to college.

00:36:53.028 --> 00:36:56.460
So I, kind of, use storytelling
to get through to him.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:36:58.380
And also, we connect
them to mentors.

00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:01.320
I mean, that's the best way.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.435
I mean, you can save 10
years by reading a book.

00:37:03.435 --> 00:37:05.370
But wow, if you can
connect to somebody that's

00:37:05.370 --> 00:37:07.780
a mentor, that can work
with you once a month,

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:11.670
it really breaks down a lot of
those self-confidence issues

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.091
and barriers.

00:37:13.091 --> 00:37:13.924
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:13.924 --> 00:37:14.924
JAHMAL COLE: No problem.

00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:19.000
JEN WESLEY: So we
always end our sessions

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.330
with a question for
people who are here

00:37:22.330 --> 00:37:24.676
to ask us, or tell us, rather.

00:37:24.676 --> 00:37:26.050
What are the things
you would ask

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:28.960
of us to do differently
when we leave here today,

00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:31.590
or to stop doing?

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:35.560
And how would you ask this group
to make a commitment to you?

00:37:38.488 --> 00:37:41.770
JAHMAL COLE: Well, I know
Dr. Martin Luther King says--

00:37:41.770 --> 00:37:44.770
he says, in a real sense,
all life is interrelated.

00:37:44.770 --> 00:37:47.590
He says, all men are caught
in this inescapable network

00:37:47.590 --> 00:37:48.640
of mutuality.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:51.040
And that's bound by a
single garment of destiny.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:53.950
He says, what affects one person
directly, affects all of us

00:37:53.950 --> 00:37:55.120
indirectly.

00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:57.190
He says, I can't be what
I ought to be until, you

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.450
are what you ought to be.

00:37:58.450 --> 00:38:00.190
And you can't be
what you ought to be,

00:38:00.190 --> 00:38:01.440
until I am what I ought to be.

00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:04.090
And that's the interrelated
structure of reality.

00:38:04.090 --> 00:38:07.600
So in this interconnected
Chicago that I envision, like,

00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:09.180
all 77 communities,
they're going

00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:12.030
to contribute to the
music of the city--

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:14.390
or this is Google-- the
network in the city.

00:38:14.390 --> 00:38:17.320
So the residents
of Humboldt Park,

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.100
they be the motherboard,
or whatever.

00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:23.300
The residents of Woodlawn,
they be the flash.

00:38:23.300 --> 00:38:26.879
No, we're Chatham-- Chatham
is going to be the flash.

00:38:26.879 --> 00:38:28.420
The residents of
South Shore, they're

00:38:28.420 --> 00:38:30.170
going to be the peripherals.

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:32.980
And if one community
area is struggling,

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:35.820
and they can't play their
part, the entire system

00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:36.860
is going to suffer.

00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:38.260
And we should all be concerned.

00:38:38.260 --> 00:38:41.320
So I would encourage everybody
to step outside their comfort

00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.530
zone, and expose themself--

00:38:43.530 --> 00:38:46.030
like, look up from your cell
phone when you're on the train,

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.130
and just see what you can
notice from the sights

00:38:48.130 --> 00:38:49.270
and sounds around you.

00:38:49.270 --> 00:38:51.370
Go visit a different
community area once a month.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:53.770
Go get your hair done
somewhere else, right?

00:38:53.770 --> 00:38:55.570
That's how Chicago is
going to be better.

00:38:55.570 --> 00:38:58.390
They say a chain is only as
strong as the weakest link.

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:00.100
Chicago is only
as strong as it's

00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:01.790
most under-resourced community.

00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:04.335
And so I encourage
you all to explore,

00:39:04.335 --> 00:39:06.710
because you can travel the
world without leaving Chicago.

00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:07.834
JEN WESLEY: That's awesome.

00:39:07.834 --> 00:39:09.860
Well, I can tell you,
from reading your book,

00:39:09.860 --> 00:39:11.360
and our conversation
before, you're

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.580
a philosopher, an
activist, an organizer.

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.640
You really don't fit one mold.

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.722
And that usually means
great things are ahead.

00:39:18.722 --> 00:39:21.180
And we really wish the best
for My Block, My Hood, My City.

00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.930
And we want to be part of
it, so we will definitely

00:39:23.930 --> 00:39:26.360
follow through on that
over the coming months.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.070
And I know Google.org
will continue

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.450
to follow through on that.

00:39:29.450 --> 00:39:29.930
JAHMAL COLE: That's amazing.

00:39:29.930 --> 00:39:30.735
Thank you guys for having me.

00:39:30.735 --> 00:39:31.340
I appreciate it.

00:39:31.340 --> 00:39:32.256
JEN WESLEY: Thank you.

00:39:32.256 --> 00:39:34.634
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:36.071 --> 00:39:38.100
Before we go, I
did wan to give you

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:39.880
a chance to just
talk about the donuts

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:40.963
that you brought with you.

00:39:40.963 --> 00:39:42.670
JAHMAL COLE: Yeah,
it's Dat Donuts,

00:39:42.670 --> 00:39:44.620
right there on-- what is that?

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:47.950
83rd third and Cottage
Grove, Chatham--

00:39:47.950 --> 00:39:49.430
you know, that's my community.

00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:50.980
Chatham's not a community.

00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:52.020
It's a state of mind.

00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:53.728
And that state of mind
is you know, like,

00:39:53.728 --> 00:39:55.270
African-American
entrepreneurship,

00:39:55.270 --> 00:39:58.000
homeownership, manicured
lawns, brick bungalows.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.740
And I'm telling you,
if you have you ever

00:39:59.740 --> 00:40:01.699
been to, like, Norwood
Park, or Jefferson Park,

00:40:01.699 --> 00:40:03.864
you could-- and then you
see Chatham, you'd be like,

00:40:03.864 --> 00:40:04.935
wow, it looks identical.

00:40:04.935 --> 00:40:06.340
So you guys can visit Chatham.

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:09.761
We are a great community
on the Southside.

00:40:09.761 --> 00:40:11.510
JEN WESLEY: So Donuts
from Chatham, today.

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:12.015
JAHMAL COLE: Yes.

00:40:12.015 --> 00:40:12.320
Thank you.

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.236
JEN WESLEY: Thank you.

00:40:13.236 --> 00:40:15.670
[APPLAUSE]
