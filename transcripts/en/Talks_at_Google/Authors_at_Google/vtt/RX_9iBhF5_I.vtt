00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:05.988
FEMALE SPEAKER: All right.

00:00:05.988 --> 00:00:06.380
Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.530
So a little bit about Maria.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.700
She is a brand strategist,
author and speaker, who

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.630
believes cash flow and
creativity are

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.580
not mutually exclusive.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:19.600
As brand chief strategist and
creator of Red Slice, she

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.630
advises start-ups, solopreneurs,
and small- to

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.080
mid-sized growth companies
on how to craft

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.850
irresistible brands.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.570
Maria is the author of two
books, "Branding Basics for

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.370
Small Business," and, what
we're going to look into

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:35.660
today, her humorous and
heartfelt memoir "Rebooting My

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.730
Brain." So Maria's been also
featured on MSNBC, ABC News,

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.850
NPR, "Entrepreneur,"
and the "LA Times."

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.680
We often don't get to hear a lot
about severe brain trauma

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.140
patients, because, sadly, they
don't always have the means or

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.490
cognitive ability to communicate
their experience.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.640
Maria has had an amazing
recovery from a ruptured brain

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.950
aneurysm just over
four years ago.

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.620
She now uses her voice to
educate and inspire others

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.820
about both the unseen effects
of brain injury, as well as

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.250
how to bounce back after
any crisis yanks

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.760
you out of your life.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.040
So please, let me welcome, and
join me to welcome Maria Ross.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.290
Thank you.

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.900
MARIA ROSS: Thanks for
having me today.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.430
I really appreciate it.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.310
So yeah, as Rachel said,
my name is Maria Ross.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.040
And I want to talk to
you a little bit.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.660
My mission is two-fold in
talking to you today.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.350
Number one is to educate you a
little bit about brain injury

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.750
and brain aneurysms,
in particular.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.740
As we all know from all the
quarterbacks that got

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.630
concussions this past weekend
in the NFL, brain injury is

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.380
finally getting in
the spotlight.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.730
And so more people need to
understand some of the unseen

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.630
effects that go along with it,
because too often, people try

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.480
to diagnose it as, oh,
they look fine.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.310
And so I'm really on a mission
to educate people about what

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.380
brain injury patients, no matter
how they got their

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:00.040
brain injury-- whether it's
concussion, or, like me, an

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.760
aneurysm, or a stroke or some
other traumatic event--

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.750
many of the effects
are the same.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.199
So I'm on a mission to educate
as well as inspire people,

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:13.310
because my story, where I was
in my life, is probably very

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.300
similar to where you guys are.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.640
And when life yanks you out of
it because of a crisis, it can

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.520
really can make you
lose your balance.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.080
And so it's all about how
do you get back into the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.200
slipstream of your life and
rebuild, hopefully, a little

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.540
bit wiser and a little bit
changed by the experience.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.240
So let me paint a picture for
you of what was going on when

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.110
this whole aneurysm hit my
life and the life of my

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.790
husband, Paul.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.510
In 2007, we had been living in
the San Francisco Bay Area--

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.720
and I had been here for
almost eight years--

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.330
both living similar lives to
what you guys are living.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.130
We were both marketing
professionals, marketing

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.000
executives in technology,
working down in the valley,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.310
living up in San Francisco.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.360
So commuting, really fast-paced
lifestyle, really

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.710
doing a lot and trying
to fit a lot in.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.950
My husband got a job offer
from Microsoft.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.480
So we ended up moving to Seattle
because of that.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.350
And you can imagine that
that was a huge change.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.350
Not only did we move to
a new city, but we

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.430
had to make new friends.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.910
We bought our first house.

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.740
We adopted our first dog.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.550
And as if that wasn't enough
change and stress, after my

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.180
company that I was working for
in the valley had some

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.260
layoffs, I decided to hang out
my own shingle and start my

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.530
brand consultancy, which I'd
wanted to for a long time.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.440
So I was getting into the swing
of owning a new business

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.720
and all the legal requirements
and the accounting

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.740
requirements and networking and
trying to build up that

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.240
base of clients.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.680
So it was a really crazy and
stressful time for us.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.220
And we were going at, probably,
about 300 miles an

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.760
hour, as I'm sure many of
our lives feel like in

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.020
this day and age.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:55.130
In addition to all of
that-- as if, again,

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:56.240
that all wasn't enough--

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:58.100
I'm also an actress
in my spare time.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.190
So I was investigating the
Seattle theater scene as well,

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.580
thinking I'm not sure how I was
going to have time to do

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.770
another play on top
of all of this.

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:08.430
So it was a pretty crazy time.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.840
And after an initial episode--

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.430
which maybe we can talk about
in the Q&amp;A if you want--

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.399
I started having some pretty
debilitating migraines on a

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:19.870
regular basis, to the point
that I was vomiting.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:20.890
I couldn't go into work.

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.750
And there was one particular
episode that

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:25.040
stopped me in my tracks.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.080
And when I went to the doctor,
he thought it was just all the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.880
stress and change that was
going on in our lives.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.840
And my blood pressure
was through the roof

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.850
when he took it.

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.570
But there's high blood pressure
in my family, so we

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.430
really weren't surprised that
all the stress and change had

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.440
caused the high blood
pressure.

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.480
So fast forward about a month
and a half of the occasional

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.400
dealing with these headaches,
monitoring my blood pressure.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.810
He said to monitor it for a
month and, if it wasn't going

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.380
down, to come back in.

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.050
I was about to get ready to make
that call to go back in

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.640
to see him.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:59.870
But on August 4, 2008, I
collapsed, unconscious, on my

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.320
bathroom floor.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:04.910
And luckily, my husband decided
to leave work early

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.220
that day and come home and
work from home, because I

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.630
wasn't feeling well.

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:10.780
So had he not been
there, I probably

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.930
wouldn't be here today.

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.230
But he immediately called 911.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:17.640
And we also were very fortunate
enough to live about

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.120
five miles from the region's
top trauma center that

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.990
attracts some of the top
neurosurgeons in the country.

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.070
So that was another stroke of
luck or destiny that was on my

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.470
side that day.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:32.020
And when they rushed me to
the ER, unconscious and

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.690
unresponsive, they did an
emergency scan and found that

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.930
an aneurysm had ruptured, and
it was causing a hemorrhage.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.010
So before we go any further, I
just want to clarify a few

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.900
definitions.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.090
How many of you know what
an aneurysm is?

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.410
Anyone?

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:48.720
Yeah.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.870
I didn't know what
it was either.

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.610
So I always thought an aneurysm
was an event, like a

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.220
heart attack, like someone
has an aneurysm.

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:57.030
But an aneurysm is
actually a thing.

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.320
It's a ballooning of a weak spot
in your artery wall or

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.680
your blood vessel.

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.960
And it can either get so big
that it causes problems.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.580
Or, like in my case, it can
rupture, because of all the

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.090
pressure of your blood pumping
through the vessel as it gets

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:13.600
bigger and bigger and bigger,
until, like a balloon, it

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.910
actually pops.

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.970
So I wanted to read some
statistics to you about brain

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:19.440
aneurysm, because a lot
of people don't

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:21.540
know a lot about it.

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.360
An estimated 6 million people
in the US have an unruptured

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.140
aneurysm but don't know it.

00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.960
That's about 1 in 50 people.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:31.850
So you can actually have an
aneurysm and live your life

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.540
and be fine.

00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:34.630
And it may never cause
you any problems.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:36.900
In fact, I actually have
another aneurysm

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:38.110
that's really small.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:40.460
But because of what happened to
me, it's being monitored by

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.260
the doctors.

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.660
The rate of rupture is
approximately 8 per 100,000

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:48.460
people, or 25,000 people.

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:51.820
And about 40% of all people
who have ruptured brain

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.220
aneurysm will die as a result.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.540
Four out of seven people who
actually survive will have

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:58.980
disabilities.

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:03.830
And shockingly enough, the
most prevalence of brain

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.370
aneurysms is in people between
the ages of 35 and 60.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.630
So I had my aneurysm burst
when I was 35.

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:12.170
And everyone thought,
oh, that's so young.

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:15.540
But it's actually right in the
beginning of that sweet spot.

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:19.040
And for some reason that science
hasn't quite figured

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:22.670
out yet, women suffer more than
men from brain aneurysms,

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:25.170
at a ratio of about
three to two.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:28.440
And brain aneurysm ruptures
are 3% to

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.380
5% of all new strokes.

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.300
So it's pretty compelling,
when you look at the

00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:36.310
statistics, that someone,
somewhere may be touched in

00:07:36.310 --> 00:07:39.200
their lives, either themselves
or someone close to them, by a

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:40.540
ruptured brain aneurysm.

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.600
And I've heard so many stories
from emails, since I've gotten

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.890
the book, about all different
kinds of scenarios, where

00:07:46.890 --> 00:07:49.830
people discovered their aneurysm
or had it rupture and

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:53.100
didn't know or had misdiagnosis
upon misdiagnosis

00:07:53.100 --> 00:07:54.280
from doctors.

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.260
So a lot of the nonprofit groups
that are out there

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:59.830
really seek to not just educate
the public but educate

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.230
primary care physicians.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.510
Because many of them
don't-- like mine--

00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:05.910
know that those are the
common symptoms of

00:08:05.910 --> 00:08:07.940
an unruptured aneurysm.

00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:13.160
So back to the ER, they also
discovered that when I had

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.300
this ruptured aneurysm--

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.560
obviously, when it ruptures,
it causes a cerebral

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.170
hemorrhage.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:20.560
And that's really where
the danger is.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.280
In my case, the specific
hemorrhage that I had was

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:25.100
called a subarachnoid
hemorrhage.

00:08:25.100 --> 00:08:27.430
And it doesn't have anything
to do with spiders.

00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:31.340
But as one doctor explained to
me in a great way, he said,

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.900
it's really just not your
brain and your skull.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:36.340
There's a bunch of layers that
protect your brain, sort of

00:08:36.340 --> 00:08:39.039
like Saran Wrap, that you
don't really know the

00:08:39.039 --> 00:08:40.500
technical terms for.

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:44.059
And between two of those layers
is a space called the

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:45.190
subarachnoid space.

00:08:45.190 --> 00:08:48.400
And what makes that hemorrhage
really dangerous is that it's

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.450
not localized.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:51.750
So once it gets into the
subarachnoid space, it

00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:54.490
actually surrounds the
circumference of your brain

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.650
and causes pressure, which
is what is really

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:57.900
deadly in most cases.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.090
The subarachnoid hemorrhage
is about 1% to

00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.170
7% of all new strokes.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:09.380
And the statistics around that
is about 50% of the people who

00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.100
have those don't survive.

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:13.460
About 10% to 15% of them
never even make it to

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.930
the hospital in time.

00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.930
And of those that survive, they
often have neurological

00:09:17.930 --> 00:09:19.250
or cognitive impairments.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:22.000
So it was pretty nasty.

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.810
And I'm very blessed
and very lucky.

00:09:23.810 --> 00:09:27.450
And I've actually surprised many
of my neurosurgeons with

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:31.580
my recovery, because I really
beat the statistics with

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:33.370
what's happening to me.

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:37.380
But to get back to the story,
so I was in the hospital, in

00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:40.240
summary, around six
weeks, total.

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:43.390
I was in the ICU for about three
or four weeks, between

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.510
ICU and the neurosurgery ward.

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.690
What they did was,
initially, they

00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:48.990
have to stop the bleeding.

00:09:48.990 --> 00:09:51.830
That's the imperative the day
that I was brought in.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:54.440
And there's two ways to
stop an aneurysm.

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:57.200
One way is clipping, which is,
literally, you go in and you

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.090
surgically almost, like,
put a clothespin and

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:02.030
close off the aneurysm.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:05.030
The other way, depending on
where it's located and how big

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:07.150
it is, is to do a coiling,
which is what

00:10:07.150 --> 00:10:07.930
they did with me.

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.610
They did it an emergency coiling
procedure, which is

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.770
pretty crazy.

00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:15.430
So they go through an artery
in your thigh.

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:17.110
And they put a catheter
that goes all the

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:18.230
way up to your brain.

00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.590
And they thread platinum
wires, one by one, and

00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:25.650
basically create a knitted ball
to block the flow of the

00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:26.830
blood in the aneurysm.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.790
So it's basically like I have
a plug that's stopping the

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:32.050
flow of the blood from
the aneurysm.

00:10:32.050 --> 00:10:34.880
So that kind of blows my mind.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.960
Pardon the pun.

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.200
So that's what they
did with me.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:42.360
And then, as a result, I had a
couple of other setbacks while

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.850
I was in ICU and neurosurgery.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.900
I had what's called
an angioplasty.

00:10:46.900 --> 00:10:50.330
Because a common side effect
from brain trauma is, a few

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.430
days later, like clockwork, what
happens is your brain is

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.680
trying to protect itself
from the trauma.

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.650
So some of your blood vessels
snap shut without warning.

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:01.630
And that can cause stroke-like
symptoms.

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:04.400
So for me, it was a degradation
of my left side,

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.890
just about the third or fourth
day that I was in ICU.

00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.270
And they realized I needed
an angioplasty.

00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:12.300
And that's just, basically, when
they go in with a balloon

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:15.600
and pump up and prop up the
blood vessel again so that

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.950
it's not snapped shut anymore.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:21.310
I also had an issue with an
increase of intracranial

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:24.970
fluid, or ICF, which, again, is
common with brain trauma.

00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:29.100
What happens is our bodies
all produce ICF

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.170
on a regular basis.

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.910
And in a normal, healthy body,
it's absorbed back into the

00:11:32.910 --> 00:11:36.000
bloodstream in a routine way.

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.300
But when you have a brain
trauma, sometimes the body

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:42.360
can't absorb the fluid as fast
as it's being produced.

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:45.170
And so it causes excess pressure
on your brain.

00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.730
So they did several spinal taps
on me, but it's still

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.510
wasn't alleviating
the pressure.

00:11:49.510 --> 00:11:52.190
So I had to get a shunt
implanted in my skull, which

00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:53.330
is still there.

00:11:53.330 --> 00:11:56.070
And that's just sort of like a
release valve, that when the

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:59.670
fluid built up too high, it
would release the fluid.

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:01.950
There's actually a tube that
goes down the back of my ear

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:05.240
and down my chest into
my abdominal area.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:07.840
Now, it's probably not working
now, because this was over

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.590
four years ago.

00:12:08.590 --> 00:12:11.260
But it's too invasive to go
back in and remove it.

00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:13.530
So I just sort of have this
shunt in my head for the rest

00:12:13.530 --> 00:12:15.580
of my life.

00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.880
And then in addition, I did a
couple weeks of inpatient

00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:22.380
therapy while I was in the
hospital, because I also

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.020
forgot to mention, I was blind
the entire time that I was in

00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:25.710
the hospital.

00:12:25.710 --> 00:12:28.960
I had what's called Terson's
syndrome, which is a side

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.710
effect of a subarachnoid
hemorrhage, because the hits

00:12:31.710 --> 00:12:33.510
just keep on going.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:35.920
And it basically caused another
hemorrhage in my

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.880
retinas that impaired
my vision.

00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:41.120
So I had no short-term memory.

00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:44.610
I was on ICU drugs and totally
confused and rambling and

00:12:44.610 --> 00:12:46.790
making up stories and
conspiracy theories.

00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:48.950
And then, on top of that,
I couldn't see.

00:12:48.950 --> 00:12:51.090
So that was my experience
in the hospital.

00:12:51.090 --> 00:12:53.160
I got released.

00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:56.430
And then a week later, the eye
doctors did a surgery on one

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.690
of my eyes, to at least
clear the vision so

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.490
that I could rehab.

00:13:00.490 --> 00:13:04.240
But they don't like to do that,
because they don't like

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:06.130
mucking in your eye if
they don't have to.

00:13:06.130 --> 00:13:09.390
So they let the other eye heal
on its own, which took about 9

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:11.950
or 10 months for it to
completely clear out to the

00:13:11.950 --> 00:13:14.540
point that I could
drive again.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:18.200
And then, when I got home, I
continued therapies, physical,

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.290
occupational, and speech.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:23.130
And speech was not because I
had speech problems, but

00:13:23.130 --> 00:13:25.590
speech covers all the cognitive
issues that you

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:29.010
have-- so memory, organization,
comprehension,

00:13:29.010 --> 00:13:31.400
vocabulary recall.

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:34.520
I was not speaking as fast as
I'm speaking right now.

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:38.030
I couldn't find the right words,
which still kind of

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.780
hits me every now and then,
on a daily basis.

00:13:40.780 --> 00:13:42.570
But I went through different
therapies.

00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.530
And then, after a few months,
I went to some group rehab

00:13:45.530 --> 00:13:48.980
therapies, both cognitive
and psychotherapy.

00:13:48.980 --> 00:13:52.240
Because there's a lot of effects
that come with brain

00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:54.750
injury, again, whether it's
a stroke or traumatic or

00:13:54.750 --> 00:13:57.370
whatever, things like
depression, things like

00:13:57.370 --> 00:14:01.570
anxiety, things like aggression,
lack of filter.

00:14:01.570 --> 00:14:04.150
Some people really lose
their social graces.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.340
If you've ever met someone who's
had a stroke and has had

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:10.860
that particular impact, if it's
a frontal lobe injury, it

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:12.940
can impact your regulation
center.

00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:15.280
So some people say inappropriate
things or do

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:17.950
inappropriate things or
things like that.

00:14:17.950 --> 00:14:21.430
The other big one, that was a
huge surprise for me, was your

00:14:21.430 --> 00:14:24.330
initiation gets impacted
chemically.

00:14:24.330 --> 00:14:27.400
So in that part of your brain
where your executive skills

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.100
are stored, that also stores
your get-up-and-go, your

00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:34.430
ability to initiate, your
ability to start something.

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.550
And so I struggled for a really
long time as to why

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:38.610
this was happening to me.

00:14:38.610 --> 00:14:41.910
Because I couldn't figure out
why I wasn't back to the old

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:46.690
Maria, of doing 500 things and
making things happen and being

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:48.570
type A and being a
control freak.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:50.150
And that was really
what was going on.

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:54.380
So those group therapies really
helped with that.

00:14:54.380 --> 00:14:58.690
But it took about six or seven
months, which is actually

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:00.790
quite fast given what
had happened to me.

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:03.620
But I slowly started to get back
into work again and test

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:04.860
the waters.

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.010
The challenge with a brain
injury like mine is, because

00:15:08.010 --> 00:15:09.970
there's nothing physical
that you see--

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.320
I mean, if you break your arm
or you break your foot, you

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.290
know when it's healed, right?

00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:14.890
And you know there's
a problem.

00:15:14.890 --> 00:15:18.060
But how do know you're not as
good at prioritization anymore

00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:19.660
until you have to prioritize?

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:24.040
So I had to get back into work
just to test the boundaries of

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.130
what was happening to me.

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:29.500
And over the course of the
recovery, that full year, as I

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.080
was slowly getting back into
work and doing client work

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.120
again and making sure I wasn't
screwing up my accounting

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:38.450
books or anything like that,
and then even the last few

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:40.860
years, I deal with things
differently.

00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:44.500
I've learned to adapt to, what
I call, the new me, because I

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.110
had to learn to adapt to
things being different.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:50.150
And things that used to
come easy for me don't

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:51.070
come as easy for me.

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:53.090
So my brain has to
work harder.

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:56.220
That also means that fatigue
is a huge issue with brain

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.580
injury patients and can
sometimes last the whole rest

00:15:58.580 --> 00:15:59.530
of their lives.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:03.520
So I have to plan my weeks very
carefully and my days,

00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.570
because if I try to do too much
in one day, it literally

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:10.220
exhausts me, because my brain's
working harder to do

00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:12.660
things that used to be a little
bit more automatic than

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:14.120
they are now.

00:16:14.120 --> 00:16:18.370
So I tell you all this because,
whether it's a brain

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.300
aneurysm or whether it's a
divorce or a death or a

00:16:21.300 --> 00:16:24.850
medical diagnosis, we all have
some major crisis at some

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:27.950
point, unfortunately, that, like
I mentioned before, yanks

00:16:27.950 --> 00:16:29.550
us out of our lives.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:33.170
And I was fortunate enough, with
my recovery, that I was

00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:35.320
able to see what happened
to me as a gift.

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.900
I know there's a lot of other
patients that I hear from that

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.130
are not as fortunate as I am.

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:44.950
But I did learn to re-frame my
life and reboot my brain,

00:16:44.950 --> 00:16:48.240
which is why I call the book
"Rebooting My Brain." Because

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:49.250
I was forced to.

00:16:49.250 --> 00:16:52.210
Because I had to learn how
to operate in a new way.

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.790
And I learned some valuable
lessons about what got me

00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:58.750
through that crisis that can
apply to any crisis of you

00:16:58.750 --> 00:17:00.700
trying to get back on
your feet again.

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.850
So I'm going to share those
with you and read a couple

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:06.099
passages that illustrate
those points.

00:17:06.099 --> 00:17:08.730
There's three major ones that,
as I was writing the book, I

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:11.829
started to realize were
important to getting back into

00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:13.140
your life again.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:18.710
And the first one is really
all about patience.

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:22.069
I am a redhead, and
I'm also Italian.

00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:23.460
I'm 100% Italian.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.359
So patience is not something
that I'm

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:26.960
really well versed in.

00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:30.350
And being a type-A personality,
I'd always

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:34.020
equated patience as a very
negative thing, that maybe

00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.290
people didn't care enough if
they were too patient.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:38.380
Or they were just being lazy
if they were trying to be

00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:40.020
patient and wait things out.

00:17:40.020 --> 00:17:43.870
And I was pretty much smacked
in the face that I had to

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:44.770
learn to be patient.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:47.590
And I wasn't going to go back
to normal two weeks later,

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:49.720
which is what I was telling
my doctors as I'm in the

00:17:49.720 --> 00:17:53.480
hospital, blind, with a shaved
head, with tubes in my head,

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.550
going yeah, I'm going to get
back to work in five weeks.

00:17:55.550 --> 00:17:58.100
I mean, all over my charts,
they're like, she seems to not

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:00.910
understand the severity
of her injury.

00:18:00.910 --> 00:18:02.740
So I really had to learn
that lesson.

00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:05.420
And I'm going to read a quick
passage to you that

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.370
exemplifies that.

00:18:06.370 --> 00:18:08.730
Because my husband and I had
this really great trip to

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:12.150
Spain planned, that happened
right when this aneurysm hit.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:16.310
So, obviously, we didn't go, but
I couldn't let go of the

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:17.940
fact that we weren't
going to be going.

00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.400
So I'm just adapting this
passage for you.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.340
"During that crazy autumn in the
hospital, I faced my first

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:27.700
lesson with a teacher that
came along and smacked me

00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.790
around quite often
during recovery--

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:30.950
patience.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.900
Paul and I had spent early
2008 planning a trip to

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.170
northern Spain.

00:18:35.170 --> 00:18:38.090
Our plan was to jet off to
Bilbao out for a romantic

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.420
five-day road trip, heading
south into the Rioja region to

00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:44.660
spend the night at a charming
winery bodega, then cruising

00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:47.600
east into the Pyrenees for
hiking in the mountains, and

00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:50.580
finally up to San Sebastian,
along the northern coast, for

00:18:50.580 --> 00:18:53.000
two days of seaside fun.

00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:56.970
The trip was scheduled for
September 10, 2008, about five

00:18:56.970 --> 00:18:59.490
weeks after all hell
broke loose.

00:18:59.490 --> 00:19:02.140
I, however, was convinced we
were still going to get on

00:19:02.140 --> 00:19:04.870
that plane and fly halfway
across the globe.

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:10.410
Shaved, blind, frail, weak,
underweight, fatigued,

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.590
cognitively damaged, I still
believed we were going to be

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:16.420
sunning ourselves in Spain,
munching on Manchego, and

00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:18.260
sipping Rioja.

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:20.870
Mind you, Paul told me several
times that he'd canceled the

00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:22.860
trip, but I kept forgetting.

00:19:22.860 --> 00:19:25.420
I constantly said, don't forget
to ask the doctor if I

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.450
can fly with the shunt
in my head.

00:19:27.450 --> 00:19:30.830
Paul would sigh and have to tell
me, again and again and

00:19:30.830 --> 00:19:33.740
watch me get angry,
again and again.

00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.420
But we have to go, I pleaded.

00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.050
It'll help me heal, I cajoled.

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:39.770
We're really not going to
be doing much walking.

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:42.010
It'll be good for
me, I reasoned.

00:19:42.010 --> 00:19:44.330
I wasn't even going to be
released from the hospital

00:19:44.330 --> 00:19:48.340
until September 12, but I still
thought we were going.

00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:52.240
People who don't know the real
me, the medical staff for

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:54.090
instance, thought this
was merely my

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:55.640
brain injury at play--

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.750
memory deficiencies,
aggression,

00:19:57.750 --> 00:19:59.550
over-emotional outbursts.

00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:01.030
And it partly was.

00:20:01.030 --> 00:20:03.770
But I also have an insanely
stubborn streak born of my

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:07.030
Italian heritage and my status
as a feisty redhead.

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:10.010
Patience is just not
in my vocabulary.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:13.430
I was forced to learn that life
is not on my timeline.

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.060
This brain injury was one glitch
I was not going to be

00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:19.220
able to overcome with sheer
determination and grit.

00:20:19.220 --> 00:20:22.810
This was serious business, and
I had serious healing to do.

00:20:22.810 --> 00:20:25.370
For someone who is used to
simply making up her mind and

00:20:25.370 --> 00:20:28.150
getting things done, how was I
going to learn that I could

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:32.320
not go from 0 to 100, or
hospital bed to Spanish beach,

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:34.500
in 60 seconds?

00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:36.900
Now, once again, I was put in
my place, when I tried to

00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:39.510
rally against something I could
not control, simply by

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:41.230
willing it to be so.

00:20:41.230 --> 00:20:44.210
Most likely, this delusion that
I can control everything,

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.030
combined with my inability to
surrender to things outside of

00:20:47.030 --> 00:20:50.960
that control, led to the damn
aneurysm in the first place.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.780
I had to learn that this
was more serious

00:20:52.780 --> 00:20:54.230
than I wanted to admit.

00:20:54.230 --> 00:20:56.640
Several psychologists noted
in my chart that they were

00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:59.270
concerned I didn't fully
appreciate the severity of my

00:20:59.270 --> 00:21:01.750
injury and that I was
overestimating my current

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:04.240
abilities and recovery time.

00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.550
Progress had to happen
in small steps,

00:21:06.550 --> 00:21:08.290
not in giant leaps.

00:21:08.290 --> 00:21:11.020
I was going to have to set some
goals, yet focus on the

00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:14.690
immediate step in front of me in
order to make any progress.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:16.980
There had already been enough
setbacks just while I was in

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.750
the hospital, and there would
be more when I left.

00:21:19.750 --> 00:21:22.930
But patience, a virtue with
which I've always struggled,

00:21:22.930 --> 00:21:24.570
finally had me by the throat.

00:21:24.570 --> 00:21:26.810
And I was going to have to
listen if I wanted to pick up

00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:28.690
my life again.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.330
It dawned on me that this was
the beginning of re-framing

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.400
the way I lived my life if I
wanted to have a life to

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:37.080
live."

00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:40.130
So the second lesson that really
helped me get back on

00:21:40.130 --> 00:21:43.150
my feet was all about
acceptance.

00:21:43.150 --> 00:21:46.150
And again, this is another word
that I'd equated very

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:50.200
negatively as compromise or
not getting what you want.

00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.150
And I had to learn that
there was a new me.

00:21:53.150 --> 00:21:56.100
I kept trying to get back to the
old me and do things the

00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.020
way I used to do them before.

00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.400
And I was actually my own worst
enemy, for a really long

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:03.440
time, during this crisis,
because I kept thinking the

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.100
game was the same.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.880
And the game had changed, and I
had to accept that in order

00:22:07.880 --> 00:22:09.390
to overcome it.

00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:12.990
So I'm going to read a quick
passage to you about one of

00:22:12.990 --> 00:22:14.020
the lessons in that.

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:17.880
When I was home, and I was
trying to start to get used to

00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:21.460
working again, I literally
couldn't get up off the couch,

00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:22.790
and I couldn't understand why.

00:22:22.790 --> 00:22:23.860
I mean, I was still healing.

00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:25.090
I was still blind in one eye.

00:22:25.090 --> 00:22:27.870
It wasn't like I was
completely healthy.

00:22:27.870 --> 00:22:30.500
But I couldn't understand, as I
was mentioning, this lack of

00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:31.300
initiation.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.200
I couldn't understand why I just
couldn't get myself down

00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:36.720
to my desk and at least check
email for 10 minutes a day.

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:39.630
So we brought a speech therapist
back in to help put

00:22:39.630 --> 00:22:42.670
me on a schedule and
get me ready to get

00:22:42.670 --> 00:22:43.830
back to work again.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:48.340
And she really opened my eyes
as to this fact that things

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:49.700
were different now.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:50.980
And her name is Jane.

00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.650
So I'm just reading a
quick passage about

00:22:53.650 --> 00:22:55.380
my work with her.

00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:58.050
"It was like the sun burst
into my cloudy day.

00:22:58.050 --> 00:23:00.520
I don't know if it was her
education and experience with

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:03.250
what was happening to me or her
reassurance that what I

00:23:03.250 --> 00:23:06.390
was going through was normal,
given my brain injury, but it

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:08.540
helped me get past trying
to make sense of it

00:23:08.540 --> 00:23:10.710
all and just adapt.

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:11.950
Acceptance--

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:13.710
that lesson was key to
getting me through

00:23:13.710 --> 00:23:15.540
the rest of my recovery.

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.270
Before this, I had seen
everything as

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.750
so black and white.

00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:20.760
If I say I'm brain injured,
I won't ever

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.050
get back to my life.

00:23:22.050 --> 00:23:24.430
So I'll minimize the injury
as much as possible

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.240
and just push through.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:29.900
I had thought admitting to
change meant I was broken.

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:31.410
What I learned from Jane
was that there was

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.180
going to be a new me--

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.800
not better or worse, but new.

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.970
I could fight it all I wanted,
but the sooner I accepted this

00:23:38.970 --> 00:23:43.160
new reality, the sooner I could
adapt and deal with it.

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.600
Acceptance doesn't
mean giving up.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:47.940
It's seeing the reality in front
of you and making the

00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:49.910
best out of the situation.

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:52.580
To me, getting well had meant
getting back to the old

00:23:52.580 --> 00:23:54.030
baseline again.

00:23:54.030 --> 00:23:55.400
Not true.

00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.400
It was now a new
playing field.

00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:00.010
Getting healthy meant that I
needed to honestly assess the

00:24:00.010 --> 00:24:03.850
obstacles and then see how far I
could knock them over or how

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:05.100
I could zip around
them instead.

00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:11.910
Jane let some light into that
darkness, so I could realize

00:24:11.910 --> 00:24:13.600
it was not about the old me.

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.970
It was about the here and now
and making the new me work.

00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:18.890
Working with her rebooted
my system and

00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:20.530
my approach to recovery.

00:24:20.530 --> 00:24:23.960
This turning point, of asking
for help, completely rewired

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:26.120
my thinking."

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:28.900
And one of the things that you
may have gotten with your book

00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:31.040
is a card for a free
trial from a

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:32.560
website called Lumosity.

00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:35.430
It's a brain games website
developed by a bunch of

00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:36.200
neuroscientists.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.330
It's actually based
in the Bay Area.

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:40.790
And Jane actually turned
me on to that website.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:45.050
And playing those games, it
has been shown, they're

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:48.860
finding, to help improve brain
injury patients and stroke

00:24:48.860 --> 00:24:50.110
patients as well.

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:53.220
So I played those games
for several weeks.

00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:55.580
And actually, it helped me
get my vocabulary back.

00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.260
It helped me get my cognitive
edge back.

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:01.980
And it helped me with recall,
as well as things like

00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.480
visual-spatial recognition,
which I was

00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:05.680
having problems with.

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.940
So it's a really
great website.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:09.750
And you have a card there for a
one-month free trial if you

00:25:09.750 --> 00:25:11.320
want to check it out.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.420
So the third lesson, which is,
I think, a really important

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:17.140
one, no matter what challenge
we're facing,

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:19.370
is to find the humor.

00:25:19.370 --> 00:25:21.480
So you might think,
OK, this is a

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.780
near-fatal brain aneurysm.

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.290
There's nothing really
funny about that.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:28.110
But my family and friends, true
to form, found moments of

00:25:28.110 --> 00:25:30.440
humor to lighten their stress
and lighten their

00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:31.670
mood and just cope.

00:25:31.670 --> 00:25:34.520
It's a human reaction, and
people shouldn't feel guilty

00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:36.880
about making off-color jokes.

00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.040
I mean, my husband and I,
between us, we joke a lot

00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:41.660
about brain injury and
things like that.

00:25:41.660 --> 00:25:43.400
And sometimes, we do it in front
of other people, and

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.940
they're kind of shocked.

00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:46.370
But that's how we
deal with it.

00:25:46.370 --> 00:25:51.250
So it's OK to let go and find
the humor in things.

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.940
I think it really helps people
deflate the pressure and be

00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:57.410
able to problem solve and
think more clearly.

00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:00.620
So there was actually a lot to
laugh about, even though I

00:26:00.620 --> 00:26:05.500
don't remember the entire
month of August, 2008.

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.450
My friend, who's a writer, who
happened to be in town, in

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:11.010
Seattle, the weekend that this
happened and extended her

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:14.570
stay, she started a journal for
me, where she documented

00:26:14.570 --> 00:26:16.720
everything that was
going on in ICU.

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.170
And a few other people chimed
in with entries.

00:26:19.170 --> 00:26:22.170
But she noted all these humorous
moments, even though

00:26:22.170 --> 00:26:24.260
they didn't know if these were
things that were going to last

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:26.940
me the rest of my life.

00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:29.180
Because of the drugs and because
of the brain injury

00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:33.020
and because of being in ICU, a
common side-effect is called

00:26:33.020 --> 00:26:34.400
ICU psychosis.

00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.230
And I don't know if any of have
actually had friends or

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:37.400
family in the ICU.

00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.290
But often people will come up
with conspiracy theories.

00:26:41.290 --> 00:26:42.890
They'll get paranoid.

00:26:42.890 --> 00:26:45.400
They'll think they're late for
meetings they never had.

00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.270
They think there's things
they need to be doing

00:26:47.270 --> 00:26:48.750
that it's not true.

00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:50.280
They just start making
things up.

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.260
And so some of these stories,
I was saying, were actually

00:26:53.260 --> 00:26:53.800
pretty funny.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.420
And she documented some of them,
hoping that one day we'd

00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.450
be able to laugh about
it, which we do.

00:26:58.450 --> 00:27:00.930
But my husband, in
particular--

00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:03.570
obviously, you can guess, he
was under a lot of stress.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:08.090
And he found his own way of
humorously dealing with this

00:27:08.090 --> 00:27:09.700
situation, among other things.

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.180
So I'm going to read you
this quick passage.

00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.360
"As the days passed, medical
staff did daily neurological

00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.150
assessments, sometimes
multiple times a day.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.850
They asked me a series of
questions to see where I was,

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:22.770
from a cognitive standpoint.

00:27:22.770 --> 00:27:24.870
While I could have conversations
when I was alert

00:27:24.870 --> 00:27:26.880
and awake, I still didn't
always have a

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:28.660
firm grasp on reality.

00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:31.050
But I think my friends and
family enjoyed the barraged of

00:27:31.050 --> 00:27:34.310
questioning more than I did,
especially my friend Tracy,

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:37.510
who wrote, 'they started a lot
of testing and assessment for

00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:38.880
future therapy.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.310
Lots more questions followed.

00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:43.000
The first being, does
a cork float?

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.780
I wasn't sure on this either.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:46.230
We just drink the wine.

00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:49.120
We don't bother putting
the cork in water.'

00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:51.800
Over the course of my hospital
stay, Paul, along with

00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.010
everyone else, turned to humor
as a coping mechanism.

00:27:55.010 --> 00:27:58.200
He invented his own battery
of memory tests.

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:02.010
That fall, two prominent men
made headlines, John Edwards

00:28:02.010 --> 00:28:03.410
and Brett Favre.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.320
John Edwards' scandal involved
a secret affair.

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.990
Brett Favre, the famous Green
Bay Packers quarterback, went

00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:11.020
to play for the New York Jets.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:13.540
As I'm a big football fan, this
bit of news mattered to

00:28:13.540 --> 00:28:17.450
me, because I loved Brett Favre,
and I'm a Jets fan.

00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:20.380
Each day, Paul asked me, do you
remember what I told you

00:28:20.380 --> 00:28:21.450
about John Edwards?

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:23.950
Do you remember what I told
you about Brett Favre?

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:26.480
And each day I forgot.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:28.690
You know that movie, "50 First
Dates" with Drew Barrymore and

00:28:28.690 --> 00:28:31.290
Adam Sandler, where each day he
has to woo his girlfriend

00:28:31.290 --> 00:28:32.990
all over again, because
she suffers from

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:34.730
no short-term memory?

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.420
Yeah, it was kind
of like that.

00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:36.840
Shut up.

00:28:36.840 --> 00:28:41.160
No way, I would exclaim in
shock, every single time.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:43.310
Never gets old, he joked.

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:46.310
But Paul's amusement masked a
nagging worry that I might be

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:48.680
like this for the
rest of my life.

00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:51.780
In the vast blackness of a month
entirely lost to memory,

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.280
I know there were glimpses of
the old Maria that offered

00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:57.030
hope and comfort to everyone,
just as much as there were

00:28:57.030 --> 00:28:58.820
some scary setbacks.

00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.160
Even in my ramblings, I itched
to be busy, telling people the

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:05.050
location of things that I
thought I needed from home--

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:06.130
I didn't--

00:29:06.130 --> 00:29:08.190
or asking what I needed
to be doing--

00:29:08.190 --> 00:29:09.250
nothing.

00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:12.060
My mind reeled off an ambitious
to-do list on

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:14.810
autopilot, even though
none existed.

00:29:14.810 --> 00:29:17.340
Not all of it made sense, but
everyone took it as a good

00:29:17.340 --> 00:29:19.060
sign that I wanted to
be kicking ass and

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.380
taking names again.

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.350
Especially Carey, who wrote,
'August 9, 2008.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:27.000
We're trying to sort out a
good pillow-bed position

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:28.350
because of your neck pain.

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:30.510
So you're getting jostled
quite a bit.

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.820
During one of the jostles,
your gown slipped a bit.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.210
And you said, very distinctively
to the nurse,

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.860
well, shit, and yanked
it back up.

00:29:37.860 --> 00:29:43.000
Little victories, tiny friend,
little victories,'"

00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:46.450
So I share those lessons with
you about patience,

00:29:46.450 --> 00:29:48.960
acceptance, and humor, again,
because I'm hoping that you

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.290
don't have to have a brain
aneurysm to be able to find

00:29:52.290 --> 00:29:55.720
opportunities in your everyday
adversities to re-frame the

00:29:55.720 --> 00:29:56.740
conversation.

00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.840
I was forced to because of
what had happened to me.

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.410
And like I said earlier, I'm
fortunate enough to see this

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:04.780
as a gift because of my
amazing recovery.

00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.370
But a lot of these changes I'm
really glad that I've made, in

00:30:08.370 --> 00:30:10.670
terms of slowing down and
appreciating the moment a

00:30:10.670 --> 00:30:14.140
little bit more and trying to
control my stress level.

00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:16.670
Because of that other aneurysm
that I have, that I mentioned,

00:30:16.670 --> 00:30:18.880
I do have to keep my blood
pressure in check so that it

00:30:18.880 --> 00:30:20.730
doesn't get any bigger.

00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:22.120
And I'm not perfect.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.260
I haven't reached some Zen
Buddhist state about my life.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:26.660
And I still get caught
up in things.

00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:29.890
I still work with crazy clients
and doing all sorts of

00:30:29.890 --> 00:30:30.670
stuff like that.

00:30:30.670 --> 00:30:33.640
But I try to stay a little bit
centered and a little bit

00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:37.160
present, realizing that there
are worse things that could be

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.920
happening to me right now.

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.780
So I just want to leave you with
one last passage, which

00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:46.150
is kind of about a lot of
thinking that I did because of

00:30:46.150 --> 00:30:47.990
the changes that
happened to me.

00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:49.660
Again, it wasn't like I
became a completely

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:51.130
different person overnight.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:53.410
But there are a lot of
personality and emotional

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.030
changes that happen to brain
injury patients.

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:59.780
And so it led me on this
question of, do our brains

00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:03.010
define who we are?

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.760
"I've been asked, do you
think your brain

00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:06.370
defines who you are?

00:31:06.370 --> 00:31:07.990
Interesting question.

00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:10.290
I've learned that our brain
function is responsible for

00:31:10.290 --> 00:31:13.690
not just our physical being but
how we plan, whether we're

00:31:13.690 --> 00:31:17.030
organized or not, how much
initiative we have, and

00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.670
whether we get angry, sad,
happy, or hopeful.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:23.200
It conducts each instrument
that makes up the grand

00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.440
orchestra of who we are.

00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.710
He's a go-getter.

00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:28.110
She's a neat-freak.

00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:29.750
She's good with numbers.

00:31:29.750 --> 00:31:32.130
He's such a spontaneous guy.

00:31:32.130 --> 00:31:35.110
All of these personality types
and traits that define us as

00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:38.830
human beings can be impacted
by damage to our brains.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:41.560
If that happens, then
who are we?

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:45.190
Does brain function dictate your
personality or, if you

00:31:45.190 --> 00:31:48.330
believe personality is a part
of your soul, then does that

00:31:48.330 --> 00:31:49.680
come first?

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.560
And if it does come first, does
it dictate the way your

00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.810
brain learns to operate?

00:31:59.820 --> 00:32:02.290
I strongly believe that your
brain function impacts your

00:32:02.290 --> 00:32:05.880
personality, but it doesn't have
to define who you are.

00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.860
My cognitive deficits and
emotional changes threatened

00:32:08.860 --> 00:32:12.100
to change my very core, leaving
paralyzing fear,

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.590
sadness, and frustration
in their wake.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:17.310
But the ability to fight through
them, to keep trying

00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:20.660
to find a way around them, to
deal with the tears by trying

00:32:20.660 --> 00:32:24.110
to find something to laugh at,
that's all a very real part of

00:32:24.110 --> 00:32:26.380
who I was before the injury.

00:32:26.380 --> 00:32:28.920
These days, I realize that this
desire to keep moving

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.030
forward, to keep pushing through
is what makes me who I

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:34.550
am, pre or post brain injury.

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:37.590
As a result, the success or
failure of the attempt doesn't

00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:39.310
really matter.

00:32:39.310 --> 00:32:40.870
My hope is twofold.

00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:43.580
First, that people take brain
injury more seriously and

00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:45.750
understand what its effects
can be on those

00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:47.040
they know and love.

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.710
And second, that it doesn't
take a brain aneurysm for

00:32:49.710 --> 00:32:52.800
people to learn the lessons I
learned about slowing down,

00:32:52.800 --> 00:32:56.240
finding the humor, having more
patience, and savoring each

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.830
activity in our 24 by
7 connected world.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.580
Everyday challenges can present
a new opportunity to

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:06.500
reboot, start over, and re-frame
the conversation with

00:33:06.500 --> 00:33:09.650
your work, your relationships,
and with yourself.

00:33:09.650 --> 00:33:10.830
It's not easy.

00:33:10.830 --> 00:33:13.770
And like me, you won't be great
at it every single day.

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:16.730
But again, it's the attempt that
matters the most, not the

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:18.660
outcome."

00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:22.450
So I just want to leave you with
a quote that I've found

00:33:22.450 --> 00:33:24.650
that kind of has given me
comfort through this journey.

00:33:24.650 --> 00:33:26.720
And I'm going to paraphrase,
because I--

00:33:26.720 --> 00:33:27.460
short-term memory.

00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.860
I can't seem to remember
the exact quote.

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:32.600
And then we're going to take
some questions, if you guys

00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:35.380
have questions about brain
injury or writing the book or

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.560
anything like that.

00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:39.490
But there's a quote that I found
that said something to

00:33:39.490 --> 00:33:41.730
the effect of, life's challenges
are not meant to

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:42.980
paralyze you.

00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:45.350
They're supposed to show
you who you are.

00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:46.680
And I really believe that.

00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:48.840
I really believe that it's
when we're tested--

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:50.570
and I know that sounds trite--

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:52.630
but that's when the real
you comes out,

00:33:52.630 --> 00:33:54.110
brain injury or not.

00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:59.960
And the real hearts of those
around you come out as well.

00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:02.510
So I was very fortunate to
have a really supportive

00:34:02.510 --> 00:34:05.610
community of friends and family
that flew in from all

00:34:05.610 --> 00:34:06.770
over the country
to be with me.

00:34:06.770 --> 00:34:09.560
But I know that there's a lot
of brain injury patients who

00:34:09.560 --> 00:34:11.150
are abandoned by
their families.

00:34:11.150 --> 00:34:13.820
Their families don't understand
the personality

00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:16.949
changes or the psychological
changes that are taking place.

00:34:16.949 --> 00:34:20.530
And it's those people, many of
whom I met in my rehab group,

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:23.969
that are the reason that I wrote
this book, because more

00:34:23.969 --> 00:34:26.440
people need to understand what
these effects of brain injury

00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:29.449
are, again, even if a
person looks fine.

00:34:29.449 --> 00:34:30.570
So thanks for your time.

00:34:30.570 --> 00:34:33.040
And I will take any questions,
if you guys have any.

00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:37.130
I'm pretty open, so you
can ask me anything.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:37.523
Thanks.

00:34:37.523 --> 00:34:38.310
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.815
MARIA ROSS: I'm sorry?

00:34:38.815 --> 00:34:40.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:41.620
MARIA ROSS: I will, for sure.

00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:42.000
Yes?

00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:43.772
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:43.772 --> 00:34:46.092
would you say you're a happier
person now, with all these

00:34:46.092 --> 00:34:48.889
things you've learned, than you
were before your accident?

00:34:48.889 --> 00:34:51.190
MARIA ROSS: So the question was,
do I think I'm a happier

00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:53.949
person now than I was before
because of all the things that

00:34:53.949 --> 00:34:55.730
I've learned?

00:34:55.730 --> 00:34:58.000
I have to admit, I was
pretty happy before.

00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:01.470
But I think I'm just
more aware.

00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:05.410
And so it's made my life a
little bit more richer.

00:35:05.410 --> 00:35:07.950
I think I was always just going,
going, going on the

00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:09.920
treadmill and not really
realizing why

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:11.600
I was going, before.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:14.370
I was just always looking for
the next job opportunity, the

00:35:14.370 --> 00:35:17.230
next career advancement, the
next activity I could

00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:18.070
participate in.

00:35:18.070 --> 00:35:22.150
And I wasn't really stopping
long enough to consider why.

00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:25.010
And so now, because I have to
be more thoughtful about my

00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:27.950
day and my schedule and the
things that I choose to

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:31.960
volunteer for or get dragged
into or whatever you want to

00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:34.720
call it, I feel like
I'm living with a

00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.960
little bit more intention.

00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:40.550
Again, not every day, but I'm
not some Yogi on the mat.

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:44.100
So I guess, in that respect, I'm
a little bit more present

00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:46.720
in my life now than I was
before, which, before, I

00:35:46.720 --> 00:35:48.770
probably would have said was
a bunch of psychobabble.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:52.220
But I kind of get it now.

00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:54.661
So thanks.

00:35:54.661 --> 00:36:00.860
Any other questions you guys
have about brain injury or

00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:02.929
anything like that?

00:36:02.929 --> 00:36:04.179
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:21.230
MARIA ROSS: So the question is,
how have things have been

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:23.730
like using this platform
of education and

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:24.710
inspiration of the book?

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:26.240
Is that kind of a
good summary?

00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.180
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:27.180 --> 00:36:28.240
MARIA ROSS: It's actually
been really great.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:31.140
I still have my consultancy
and my branding business.

00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:32.980
But I feel like this has
opened up a whole

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:34.760
other avenue for me.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:37.570
I'm actually going to be
speaking on a lot more medical

00:36:37.570 --> 00:36:40.810
conferences, representing the
patient point of view, not

00:36:40.810 --> 00:36:42.570
just about brain injury
but just about

00:36:42.570 --> 00:36:44.320
patient care in general.

00:36:44.320 --> 00:36:48.570
And I took this as an
opportunity to go volunteer at

00:36:48.570 --> 00:36:50.270
the hospital that
saved my life.

00:36:50.270 --> 00:36:53.830
When I was still in Seattle, I
became a patient adviser on

00:36:53.830 --> 00:36:55.770
the family and education
committee.

00:36:55.770 --> 00:36:57.750
And basically, I was the
voice of reality.

00:36:57.750 --> 00:36:59.720
When they were trying to think
of new programs and new

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:03.540
training modules, I was like,
yeah, that's too complicated.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:05.920
Or yeah, they're not going
to be looking at that.

00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.400
So I've used that as an
opportunity to be able to

00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:10.970
educate about brain injury.

00:37:10.970 --> 00:37:14.980
But I just think like, everybody
else, I just wasn't

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:16.290
really as aware.

00:37:16.290 --> 00:37:18.770
And I grew up in a house where,
in high school, my

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:20.430
great aunt had suffered
a stroke.

00:37:20.430 --> 00:37:21.565
And she was living with us.

00:37:21.565 --> 00:37:23.160
My mother was taking
care of her.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.100
And I had no idea what was
going on with her.

00:37:25.100 --> 00:37:30.020
I had no idea, at 14, why she
had become a different person.

00:37:30.020 --> 00:37:33.180
And I don't know if she actually
was aware, as aware

00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.270
as I am, of what was
happening to her.

00:37:35.270 --> 00:37:37.870
But you just hear the same
stories over and over.

00:37:37.870 --> 00:37:39.410
And like I said, I keep
getting these emails.

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:41.310
And it doesn't really matter
what the injury is.

00:37:41.310 --> 00:37:42.920
People are like, oh my god,
I read your book.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:44.760
And I didn't have a brain
aneurysm, but everything you

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:47.400
described was like my story.

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.520
And so just really understanding
these effects,

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.990
because I alluded to
the fact about

00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:54.520
people in my group rehab.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.740
I remember one guy in
particular, which was so sad.

00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:59.830
His wife was divorcing him
because she couldn't

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:03.340
understand why he was lazy now
and couldn't get his act

00:38:03.340 --> 00:38:06.520
together and was having such a
hard time just getting back

00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:09.050
into his life and getting back
to work after, I think, it was

00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:10.460
a car accident.

00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:13.980
And I remember when he finally
was educated about, these are

00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.630
the common effects
of brain injury.

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:18.240
And he went down the list
and went, yep, yep, yep.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.150
He's like, I'm going to take
this binder home and show it

00:38:20.150 --> 00:38:22.690
to my wife, because she thinks
I'm making all this up.

00:38:22.690 --> 00:38:26.250
Which is just really sad to me,
because I imagine it's got

00:38:26.250 --> 00:38:28.040
to be very hard to
live with that.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.460
I know it's been challenging
for my husband, at times.

00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:32.530
But at least he was willing to

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:34.310
understand and educate himself.

00:38:34.310 --> 00:38:35.710
And I was very fortunate
about that.

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:39.040
But when we talk about the
concussions, like that

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.270
happened Alex Smith and
whatever, I'm so glad those

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:42.690
guys are getting pulled
out of the game.

00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:46.180
Because right around the time
that I had my brain aneurysm,

00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:49.480
there was a high schooler in
Seattle, named Zack Lystedt.

00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:51.490
I don't know if any of you
guys have heard of him.

00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:55.540
But he got a concussion during
a game and was put back in--

00:38:55.540 --> 00:38:56.440
or during practice.

00:38:56.440 --> 00:38:57.600
I can't remember.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.020
And he collapsed on the field
and was taken to, actually,

00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:02.660
the same place that
I was taken to,

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.490
the same trauma center.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:06.040
He's just learning
to walk again.

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.120
And this was four years ago.

00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:12.730
So, again, the diagnosis is
not, how many fingers am I

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:14.820
holding up, and do you
know your name?

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:18.050
Because I was able to answer
those questions.

00:39:18.050 --> 00:39:20.420
But I don't even remember
answering those questions.

00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.810
So I'm really happy to see
that that awareness is

00:39:23.810 --> 00:39:26.560
building up, with people taking
brain injury more

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:31.050
seriously, that sometimes the
effects can't be seen.

00:39:31.050 --> 00:39:33.742
But we need to be just really
careful when we fall or get in

00:39:33.742 --> 00:39:37.370
a car accident or take a
hit by the end zone.

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:39.120
We really need to be more
cognizant of that.

00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:43.220
Sorry, I got on my
soapbox there.

00:39:46.230 --> 00:39:49.590
Any other questions?

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:52.660
Do any of you guys have brain
injury or stroke in your

00:39:52.660 --> 00:39:57.271
family or know anyone that
is brain injured?

00:39:57.271 --> 00:39:58.640
Is it a stroke or?

00:39:58.640 --> 00:40:00.010
AUDIENCE: It was an accident.

00:40:00.010 --> 00:40:01.300
MARIA ROSS: An accident.

00:40:01.300 --> 00:40:04.760
So those are called traumatic
brain injuries, versus what I

00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.820
had is called an acquired
brain injury, because it

00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.180
happened organically.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.760
But that's the thing with
concussion, is that TBIs can

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:15.190
cause aneurysms to form.

00:40:15.190 --> 00:40:18.860
And so, going back to the
football thing, that's why, if

00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.830
they do have a concussion,
it can cause a

00:40:20.830 --> 00:40:24.560
future brain aneurysm.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:27.120
I don't know if any of this
resonates for you, with this

00:40:27.120 --> 00:40:30.760
person's behavior, but maybe.

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.030
Yeah?

00:40:31.030 --> 00:40:33.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah, my mother-in-law
actually had an

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:36.958
aneurysm that ruptured,
like, I think it

00:40:36.958 --> 00:40:40.172
was seven years ago.

00:40:40.172 --> 00:40:41.465
MARIA ROSS: Did she survive?

00:40:41.465 --> 00:40:41.800
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.154
MARIA ROSS: Oh, good.

00:40:43.154 --> 00:40:44.636
AUDIENCE: But it was similar,
a lot of the

00:40:44.636 --> 00:40:45.624
things you talked about.

00:40:45.624 --> 00:40:47.600
[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:50.490
She collapsed in the
bathroom, too.

00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:51.450
MARIA ROSS: Everybody's
in the bathroom.

00:40:51.450 --> 00:40:52.620
I don't know why.

00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:53.910
It's weird.

00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:54.830
At least they're not
on the road.

00:40:54.830 --> 00:40:58.448
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] grandma,
[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:58.448 --> 00:41:03.245
She was showering, and
then [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:03.245 --> 00:41:05.745
She was in the shower for,
like, 40 minutes.

00:41:05.745 --> 00:41:08.290
She went up and checked
on her, and she was--

00:41:08.290 --> 00:41:08.990
MARIA ROSS: Oh my gosh.

00:41:08.990 --> 00:41:09.400
AUDIENCE: --unconcious.

00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:10.852
She called the [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:18.112 --> 00:41:18.596
I don't know.

00:41:18.596 --> 00:41:20.532
It makes me have a lot of
respect for her recovery,

00:41:20.532 --> 00:41:22.950
because she is doing
amazingly, too.

00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:25.950
And she's [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:30.280
MARIA ROSS: Yeah, and the
interesting thing, which is I

00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:33.910
never really had a stance about
health care reform.

00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:35.650
But we were very fortunate.

00:41:35.650 --> 00:41:38.630
My husband was working for
Microsoft, and they covered

00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:39.930
everything, 100%.

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:41.560
And our medical bills
were well over

00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:43.300
half a million dollars.

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:49.950
And I've talked to aneurysm
groups who didn't even know

00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:51.930
about some of the rehab
groups after.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.060
Because, since they didn't have
insurance, they weren't

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:56.380
going to be able to get into
those rehab groups.

00:41:56.380 --> 00:42:00.720
And yes, the doctor saving your
actual life is important.

00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.470
But what gets you back into
society again, as a productive

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:06.380
member of society, is
the follow-up rehab.

00:42:06.380 --> 00:42:08.770
And that's where the care falls
down, because a lot of

00:42:08.770 --> 00:42:11.740
insurance companies don't cover
the rehab, because they

00:42:11.740 --> 00:42:15.130
think it's a luxury, versus hey,
at least let the person

00:42:15.130 --> 00:42:16.330
take the full eight weeks.

00:42:16.330 --> 00:42:21.640
And then they can be back
to work and back being

00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:23.086
productive.

00:42:23.086 --> 00:42:25.072
AUDIENCE: Yeah, because she just
retired, but she would

00:42:25.072 --> 00:42:25.620
like to [INAUDIBLE].

00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:26.140
MARIA ROSS: That's good.

00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:26.510
Yeah.

00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:29.912
AUDIENCE: She definitely
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:29.912 --> 00:42:31.748
I mean, my mom does too.

00:42:31.748 --> 00:42:34.250
[INAUDIBLE].

00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:37.490
MARIA ROSS: Well, I can't
explain it anymore.

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:42.210
It's not that I can't do things
I didn't do before,

00:42:42.210 --> 00:42:43.410
necessarily.

00:42:43.410 --> 00:42:45.990
I used to be really, really
good at project planning.

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.710
I was queen of that.

00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:49.460
I organized an 80-city global
roadshow in one of my

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.350
technology jobs before.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:42:55.290
The thought of actually seeing a
blank spreadsheet right now,

00:42:55.290 --> 00:42:58.360
and organizing a project like
that, with multiple tabs, just

00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.480
makes my head spin.

00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.540
I wouldn't even know.

00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:01.990
I get really overwhelmed.

00:43:01.990 --> 00:43:04.320
That's a big effect
that hits a lot of

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:05.600
brain injury patients.

00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.790
As I was mentioning, that
filter gets damaged.

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:12.750
And so in the book, I have an
example of, it's like the

00:43:12.750 --> 00:43:15.610
bouncer of my brain was
really good before.

00:43:15.610 --> 00:43:18.150
And now he got replaced with
someone who's brand new.

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:20.020
And he just lets everything
in at the same time.

00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:23.920
So for example, in this group,
we're completely focused.

00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:25.280
And I can talk to you guys.

00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:28.430
If there was another meeting
going on over there, it's hard

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:31.680
for me to filter out
what's going on.

00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:34.240
So things like that just
require more effort.

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:36.950
So I'd have to spend more effort
trying to focus on this

00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:37.980
conversation.

00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.930
It hits me in restaurants
all the time.

00:43:39.930 --> 00:43:42.750
And stroke victims and aneurysm
patients always talk

00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:45.500
about this, that they have
a really hard time with

00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:48.300
filtering out conversations in
a restaurant, because your

00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:51.150
brain's taking everything in the
equal weight, because your

00:43:51.150 --> 00:43:53.690
filter is broken.

00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:56.080
And it leaves you exhausted,
because if you can imagine

00:43:56.080 --> 00:44:00.460
taking everything in at the
same time, you're chugging

00:44:00.460 --> 00:44:02.730
really hard to try to stay
focused on the person that

00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:03.270
you're talking to.

00:44:03.270 --> 00:44:05.340
And that can exhaust
you after an hour.

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:09.330
So no texting and
talking for me.

00:44:09.330 --> 00:44:10.580
I try not to.

00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.750
Yes?

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:16.510
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:44:16.510 --> 00:44:18.950
breaking a leg, where it's
obvious [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:27.330 --> 00:44:28.720
MARIA ROSS: That's really
good question, actually.

00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.570
So the question was, since
there's a lot of unseen

00:44:31.570 --> 00:44:35.000
effects, did I come up with
strategies to tell people that

00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.040
I might be struggling?

00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.720
Is that where you're
going with that?

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:39.360
So it's just funny that you
chose to use the word

00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.120
"strategies," because that's
the big word in rehab is

00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:45.330
coming up with strategies to
deal with your issues.

00:44:45.330 --> 00:44:47.230
And they use that word
all the time.

00:44:47.230 --> 00:44:49.900
But yeah, I mean, it was kind
of challenging for me at

00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:53.050
first, because I didn't know how
much of it to bring into

00:44:53.050 --> 00:44:53.780
my business.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:57.220
I don't want to be a brand
consultant to $30 million

00:44:57.220 --> 00:45:01.170
companies and say like, oh,
I forget stuff sometimes.

00:45:01.170 --> 00:45:04.510
So I have found ways to
work around that.

00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:06.560
This sounds silly, but
I write down a lot

00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.080
more than I used to.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:11.660
So I'm always taking notes,
or I'm always recording.

00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:14.080
And even today, I
have my notes.

00:45:14.080 --> 00:45:16.340
So I'm always writing stuff
down, whereas before,

00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:17.540
I didn't have to.

00:45:17.540 --> 00:45:19.300
So that's not necessarily
something that

00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:20.310
people would notice.

00:45:20.310 --> 00:45:25.770
But sometimes I will ask the
same question twice in one

00:45:25.770 --> 00:45:28.980
conversation, because I've
forgotten what the answer was.

00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:31.780
So it hasn't caused too
much of an issue.

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:34.680
And most of the partners that
I work with on projects know

00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:35.780
about my situation.

00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:38.130
So I tend to rely on them.

00:45:38.130 --> 00:45:40.720
If we're having a conference
call, I'll make sure I'm

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:42.990
taking notes, and somebody else
is taking notes so that,

00:45:42.990 --> 00:45:46.710
if I missed something or I
didn't understand something,

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:48.250
they have my back.

00:45:48.250 --> 00:45:51.940
But it hasn't been a situation
where people have

00:45:51.940 --> 00:45:53.930
been mean about it.

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:55.200
But I don't necessarily
go like,

00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:56.140
hi, I want your business.

00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:57.250
And I had a brain injury.

00:45:57.250 --> 00:45:58.610
I don't lead with that.

00:45:58.610 --> 00:46:00.940
But if they go to my website,
they'll know that I'm an

00:46:00.940 --> 00:46:02.550
author and that I've
written this book.

00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:06.320
And ironically, bringing that
into my brand, as a business,

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:10.270
has actually really helped
my business because it

00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:11.960
differentiates me,
in a weird way.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:16.350
But they also just see this
story of overcoming adversity,

00:46:16.350 --> 00:46:18.340
and they feel like, well, that's
kind of a person that I

00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:20.770
want to work with, which
I was surprised.

00:46:20.770 --> 00:46:25.130
I wasn't sure how people we're
going to respond to that.

00:46:25.130 --> 00:46:25.960
I joke with my husband.

00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:29.200
I call it, playing the brain
injury card, about if

00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:31.320
something goes wrong.

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:33.730
I've never not delivered
something for a client and

00:46:33.730 --> 00:46:36.220
blamed it on my brain injury
or anything like that.

00:46:36.220 --> 00:46:39.190
But there have been a couple
things that, literally, is

00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:41.670
because of my overwhelm
problem or whatever.

00:46:41.670 --> 00:46:44.545
And I've just found a
way to deal with it.

00:46:44.545 --> 00:46:45.970
I double check everything.

00:46:45.970 --> 00:46:49.360
I turn off my email, while I'm
trying to work on something

00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:49.830
with people.

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:51.480
So those are the kinds
of strategies that

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.800
I've tried to employ.

00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:56.600
But yeah, there's only been one
or two times where I've

00:46:56.600 --> 00:46:59.340
told somebody, you have to slow
down, because I have to

00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.490
write this down, because
I had a brain injury.

00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:02.630
Because then that invites
a whole bunch of other

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:03.630
questions, right?

00:47:03.630 --> 00:47:04.510
It's like, oh, what's that?

00:47:04.510 --> 00:47:06.135
And when did that happen?

00:47:06.135 --> 00:47:07.865
You're like, no, I'm just trying
to get the information

00:47:07.865 --> 00:47:10.190
down right now.

00:47:10.190 --> 00:47:11.680
So good question, though.

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:13.039
Thanks.

00:47:13.039 --> 00:47:15.304
Anyone else?

00:47:15.304 --> 00:47:16.210
No?

00:47:16.210 --> 00:47:17.330
Well, thanks for your
time today.

00:47:17.330 --> 00:47:18.390
I really appreciate it.

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:19.640
And I hope you enjoy the book.
