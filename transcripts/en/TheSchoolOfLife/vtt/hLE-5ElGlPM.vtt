00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.460
If you had the misfortune to do too much of
it at school, you’ll probably remember one

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.169
thing about history: just how boring it can
be.

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.599
You might harbour painful memories of the
100 Years War, the War of Spanish

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.410
Succession, Crop Rotation in the Middle
Ages or - heaven forbid - the good

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.519
deeds of Florence Nightingale.

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:27.139
As a result, it wouldn’t be surprising if
- nowadays - you tended to steer well clear of the whole topic.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:31.279
But that would be a pity. The real reason
why history is so boring is that we’re not

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.270
clear about what it should be for.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.930
Here’s the big reason why history matters:
it matters because it can provide us with

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.370
solutions to many of the problems of the present.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.000
At its best, history is there to introduce
us to some of the things we need but that

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.820
aren’t sufficiently visible in the world
today.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.160
As a society, we’re very obsessed by what
we’re up to right now.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.080
Unknowingly, we’re hugely biased towards
the present. The news - which is about the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.830
most prestigious force in the world today
- circles obsessively around some of the things

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.400
that have happened in the last five minutes

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.540
and yet, many of the most important things
that we need to nourish, sustain and inspire us

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.220
are a lot
older.

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.020
What we nowadays need above all else are GOOD IDEAS

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.860
 and history is full of them. Imagine you’re dissatisfied with aspects

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.570
of contemporary Capitalism. It might help hugely to read

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.229
about the HISTORY of the Levellers, a group
of English radicals writing and acting between

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.420
1645 and 1650.
Or if you question what the point of going

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.969
on holiday is, you might dramatically enrich
your thoughts by considering the HISTORY of

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:40.759
pilgrimage, especially the
motives which people had for trekking off

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:42.879
to visit distant shrines.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.900
History teaches us that THINGS CAN CHANGE.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.100
People haven’t always been as they are now: materialistic
and work obsessed.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.420
unable to build nice architecture, over-concered with being “connected”

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.000
or hung up on  being absurdly thin 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.340
There’s an annoying saying that goes: THOSE WHO DON’T KNOW HISTORY ARE DOOMED TO REPEAT IT.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.820
But that’s suggesting the only thing
history is full of is mistakes.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.840
Yet it's as fair to say, those who don't know history

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.560
won't be able to IMPROVE the present.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.400
History can also teach us COURAGE. It’s
easy to feel, when you’re pressed up against

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.500
the present, that things are exceptionally
awful right now

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.560
but they rarely are, once you open the lens wide enough.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.460
The present isn't unusual in its levels of mediocrity and compromise. Once you read the

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.150
letters, the old guys were just as bad. And though our challenges

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.540
are of course great, they aren’t exceptional
- when compared with say, those facing the

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.100
survivors of the sack of Rome or
the Lisbon earthquake.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.100
History ends up as a tool for the APPRECIATION
of some of our advantages which is easy to miss.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:50.420
It can teach us to judge our society
against other societies rather than against

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.980
our ideals. Of course the European Union has problems, but the Habsburg Empire

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.260
had them too and many more. Our governments are
deeply imperfect, but there have been worse.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.040
Traffic is terrible, but so was
the siege of Leningrad.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.360
History can console.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.200
Getting clearer about what history is for
should change how the subject is taught. In

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:15.690
the future, we should treat history a little
like a doctor treats a medicine cabinet.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.680
Before diving into history, we’d first have
to work out what was wrong with us, what we

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.010
were lacking in the here and now. We be might
diagnosed for a lack of courage, or a spoilt

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:31.020
nature or a hesitation about whether to marry.
And we should be prescribed history accordingly

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.920
For their part, historians themselves should
get clearer about what problems in the present

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.100
they’re trying to solve. They should explicitly
aim to tell us things about the past that

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:47.470
can help us with issues of today. Not the
past for its sake, but the past for our sakes.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.330
Good history should always mean: history with
solutions or consolations for today.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.860
Now that could be interesting…
