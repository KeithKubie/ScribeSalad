[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.628 --> 00:00:07.090
SPEAKER 1: Welcome, everybody.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:13.408
I'm excited today to introduce
Stand.earth and Todd Paglia.

00:00:13.408 --> 00:00:16.180
In tech industry,
we have this notion

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.030
of the frenemy,
two companies that

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:22.060
compete in one area and
partner in another area.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.090
And Stand.earth has
taken that approach

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.250
to environmental activism.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:34.180
And their approach is to say,
we'll help companies clean up

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.510
their act, and act
responsibly with respect

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.670
to the environment, show
them how to do that.

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.200
But if they don't, then we'll
bring the righteous wrath

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.470
of the public down upon them.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.060
And I think this is
a great approach,

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.040
and it's proven to
be very successful.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.160
Stand's had great success in
transforming the paper industry

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.440
to use forests more
responsibly and in saving

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.560
the great rainforest.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.860
We saw some of the
pictures up there

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.220
from when I got a chance
to accompany them up

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.470
to British Columbia.

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.340
And let's let Todd tell you
all about it and about some

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.140
of the opportunities where
we can help in this mission

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.880
by bringing some
of the technologies

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.900
that we have in mapping,
and satellites, and so on.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.550
Todd, welcome to Google.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.050
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.050
TODD PAGLIA: Thanks so
much for being here today.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.740
I want to take you back to the
founding of Stand.earth, which

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.640
was in the mid-1990s about
1,000 miles north of here

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.840
on the west coast of Canada.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.460
There was a line being
drawn in the sand in a place

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.600
called Clayoquot Sound.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.840
The small town of Tofino
is in Clayoquot Sound.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.820
It was the last old
growth rainforest

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.750
valley on the west coast
of Vancouver Island,

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.750
and people had had enough.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.610
They began organizing to try to
stop the logging of this area.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.160
And it's a rainforest valley
of just incredible beauty.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.260
1,000 year old Western red
cedar trees, Doug firs,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.070
trees so big that 10
people linked arm to arm

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:22.070
could barely wrap their
arms around the trunks

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.140
of these trees, and
they're being cut down

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.660
to make toilet paper,
newsprint, two-by-fours,

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.440
and other products.

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.930
So the organizers started
what was a very small effort

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:37.880
in the beginning, and
little by little, gained

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.640
momentum, getting people
out to this remote area

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.500
to actually put their
bodies on the line

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.910
to try to stop the bulldozers
and the logging trucks

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.220
from coming in.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.020
And this, for whatever reason--

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.240
it was partly the time, partly
so much had been lost already,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.510
people responded.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.880
It struck a nerve.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.060
And hundreds of
people showed up.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.510
And little by little,
thousands of people showed up.

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:06.170
And they began
organizing protests

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.570
to try to stop the logging.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:09.890
The media followed.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.450
It became known as
the War in the Woods.

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.850
It went on for months.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.710
And celebrities
started showing up,

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.750
and rock stars, and
everybody wanted

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.930
to come, and get arrested,
and stand on the line

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.890
with the protesters protecting
this old growth river valley.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.150
And it culminated with an
international media storm.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.580
1,000 arrests, the
biggest civil disobedience

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.820
in Canadian history,
and it didn't work.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.460
It wasn't enough.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.560
And it was from that--

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.900
exceeding all expectations,
every goal they

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.380
set as far as turnout,
media, everything they did

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.720
went way beyond their
goals, and they still

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.790
didn't stop the logging.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.690
MacMillan Bloedel,
the logging company,

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.690
just kept moving right along.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.580
And it was from that sort
of moment of desperation

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.800
that the founders of
Stand.earth decided

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.860
to think about who
was buying this stuff.

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.080
So something's driving
what's happening.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.920
So they took a
very basic approach

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.710
and went out to the marketplace
with hundreds of letters

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.250
to any company they thought
might somehow be connected

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.560
to the logging in Clayoquot
Sound and the broader

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.110
logging on the coast
of British Columbia,

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.120
and companies were concerned.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.970
They didn't realize that
their purchasing dollars were

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.830
destroying this rainforest.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.290
And for the first time in
British Columbia-- and logging

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.370
was king in British Columbia
and had been for decades--

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.270
for the first time, the logging
company was on its heels.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.830
The logging stopped.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:46.640
They started having to answer
questions to their customers.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.670
They started having to
work to keep contracts.

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.094
They started to lose
some contracts, companies

00:04:52.094 --> 00:04:53.510
not wanting to be
part of what was

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.284
happening in Clayoquot Sound.

00:04:56.284 --> 00:04:58.700
And that was the first time
that the companies were really

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.200
put on the defensive.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.850
And the trees Clayoquot
Sound, the old growth forest

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.950
of Clayoquot Sound
are still standing

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:10.160
to this day because
of that effort

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:13.340
at the tail end of
years of protest

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.530
to bring some transparency.

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.740
And I think it was this
little glimpse of transparency

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.320
of a tree in a forest being cut,
five or six different mills,

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.550
way stations, middlemen
to big-branded companies

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:29.475
at the other end.

00:05:29.475 --> 00:05:31.850
And it was just a little bit
of a glimpse of transparency

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.770
that changed the
entire equation.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:37.280
So we took that lesson
of Clayoquot Sound

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.790
and started thinking, so,
how do we build campaigns

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.560
from the front end that, yes,
use communications, organizing,

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.740
protests, all the
traditional tools,

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:53.090
but also start to bring some
transparency to the issues

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.990
we are taking on?

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.440
So from one old growth
rainforest valley,

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.860
we decided to try to protect a
hundred old growth rainforest

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:05.930
valleys in an area known at
that time as the Midcoast Timber

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:10.280
Supply area, quite
a catchy name.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.679
The first piece of business for
the groups working on this--

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:15.470
and there were a lot
of other organizations

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:19.730
beyond Stand, including NRDC,
and Greenpeace, and Rainforest

00:06:19.730 --> 00:06:22.010
Action Network, and many others.

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:25.250
The first piece of
business was to rename it.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.190
We retained the
Great Bear Rainforest

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.440
after the spirit bear, which is
the iconic symbol of the Great

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.530
Bear Rainforest.

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:37.640
It's the only place in the
world where 1 out of every 10

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:40.310
black bears is born white.

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.360
They're not albinos.

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:43.010
They're not polar bears.

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:47.400
They're actually a white bear
known as the spirit bear,

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.400
and revered by the
First Nations who

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.860
have lived in this landscape
for thousands of years.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.780
And we started building into
the campaign transparency,

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:03.150
trying to track from this very
remote area wood, paper, pulp,

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:05.160
all the way through
the entire system

00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.410
to big-branded companies.

00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:13.200
So now, we had 100 valleys,
3 companies, and literally

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:15.780
thousands of big-branded
companies buying the product

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:17.280
at the end of the
line, and they had

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:18.820
no idea they were doing that.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:23.070
So it was a major private
eye investigation effort

00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.430
to figure out where all this
stuff went to and then to begin

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:27.810
educating the companies.

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.020
Our methods got a little
bit better at that point.

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:33.240
We went from just sending
a scattershot letter

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:37.540
to hundreds of companies to
actually tracking the wood,

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:40.500
paper, and pulp using a bunch
of different methods, some

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.600
of which meant just
going to mill towns,

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:45.060
and hanging out in the
bar, and figuring out

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:47.100
where the customers were.

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.984
So folks at the
bar would say, hey,

00:07:48.984 --> 00:07:50.650
we just got a big
order from Home Depot.

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:54.180
We just got a bigger
order from Staples.

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:55.560
We also ended up using--

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.890
anybody remember the
LoJack car device?

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:02.130
So we would use the LoJack which
would track your stolen car.

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:06.300
So we would track
our stolen forests

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:10.980
and use that sort of device
to track from especially rail

00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:14.520
shipments all the way to
the big-branded companies.

00:08:14.520 --> 00:08:16.470
And little by little,
we chipped away

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.512
at the transparency
problem we were having.

00:08:19.512 --> 00:08:21.720
And a lot of companies, just
like in Clayoquot Sound,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.830
didn't want to be part of
destroying a rainforest.

00:08:25.830 --> 00:08:28.320
Over time, it became
millions of dollars

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.044
of contracts put online
to tens of millions

00:08:31.044 --> 00:08:32.460
to hundreds of
millions of dollars

00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:34.950
of contracts put on the line.

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:38.400
And using that power, we
were able to bring industry

00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.659
to the table.

00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:44.110
At the same time, First
Nations on the coast of DC,

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:46.390
for the first time
in a long time,

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:50.640
got organized in a way that
went beyond individual First

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.720
Nations.

00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:55.770
They became a collective known
as the Coastal First Nations

00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.730
in British Columbia.

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:58.380
They have not signed treaties.

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:02.610
So they have actual a somewhat
undefined but very powerful

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:03.630
right to title.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.360
And so they became a
political force of their own

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.760
while we were driving the
marketplace towards change.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.540
And through a series
of negotiations,

00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.260
we went from the starting point,
which you can barely see here

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:20.140
on the screen, but almost no
protection in the Great Bear

00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:22.830
to a third of it
being protected.

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:25.020
2005, we got to round 50--

00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:25.620
no.

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:27.680
2009, we got to 50%.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.190
2015, we put the final
details into place

00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:35.970
to get over 80% of the Great
Bear Rainforest protected,

00:09:35.970 --> 00:09:37.590
off limits to logging.

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:42.570
And we created fiber flow
processes for the logging

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:45.720
companies to have a
lower impact but be

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.620
able to maintain
their businesses.

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.810
So it was a real win-win.

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.690
And what we found is once First
Nations, environmental groups,

00:09:51.690 --> 00:09:55.020
and industry were on the same
page with a very detailed plan,

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.660
the government was more than
happy to move forward and move

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.640
that into permanent legislation.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:02.730
So using these methods of
really increasing and building

00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.670
transparency into
our campaigns, we've

00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:09.030
been able to move around 60
million acres of old growth

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:11.850
and endangered forest towards
protection over the last 2

00:10:11.850 --> 00:10:13.560
decades.

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:18.150
And we then started
getting pulled increasingly

00:10:18.150 --> 00:10:20.100
into climate change.

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:22.950
One of the first issues
that we had to address,

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:27.210
in the middle of this map,
there was a pipeline proposal

00:10:27.210 --> 00:10:30.240
by the Enbridge Corporation
to bring a giant tar sands

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.500
pipeline.

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:33.960
Right at the point
when we were going over

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:37.170
50% of the Great Bear
protected, heading towards 80,

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.260
they thought it would be a great
time to bring a giant pipeline

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.360
right into the Great
Bear Rainforest,

00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.920
bringing hundreds of tankers
into the Great Bear Sea.

00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:49.290
This was a fight that
went on for the better

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:51.210
part of a decade.

00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:54.720
We were able largely through
leadership of First Nations

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.540
groups to beat
that pipeline back,

00:10:57.540 --> 00:10:59.250
tremendous organizing
on the ground.

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:02.950
And this movement of people
all around North America

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.700
and beyond fighting
oil infrastructure

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:06.856
has had incredible success.

00:11:06.856 --> 00:11:08.730
You've all heard about
the Keystone Pipeline,

00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:11.260
which has been beaten a
couple of times by now.

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.226
The Enbridge pipeline,
we're in the midst

00:11:13.226 --> 00:11:15.600
of the fight of our lives with
the Kinder Morgan pipeline

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.370
coming into Vancouver on
the port of Vancouver.

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:21.990
We're hopefully going to
be able to turn that back.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:25.310
But as we as a movement
succeeded on pipelines,

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.850
the oil companies
developed a plan B.

00:11:27.850 --> 00:11:30.701
The plan B was oil trains.

00:11:30.701 --> 00:11:32.700
So if they couldn't get
their pipelines through,

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.330
and they were getting delays
and defeats on pipelines,

00:11:36.330 --> 00:11:38.910
they thought they might be able
to start moving oil by rail,

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:41.730
and this took
everybody by surprise.

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:45.210
This was something
that heretofore, oil

00:11:45.210 --> 00:11:50.220
would occasionally go on rail,
but not very often and not

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:51.780
in any quantity that mattered.

00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.390
And suddenly, you were
getting about five years ago,

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:57.600
thousands of percent
increase every single year.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.930
And suddenly, there were
more than two dozen oil

00:12:00.930 --> 00:12:04.410
by rail terminals, new
terminals being sighted

00:12:04.410 --> 00:12:06.600
all across North America.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.330
So what we did is we were
far too small to take on

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:10.800
this challenge ourselves.

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.980
We started partnering with
Frontline Communities,

00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:17.610
developed a network,
Crude Awakening Network,

00:12:17.610 --> 00:12:21.150
which is 275 group strong
at this moment, everything

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.910
from a couple of people
working at the kitchen table

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:27.240
to the Sierra Club and Natural
Resources Defense Council.

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.100
Banding together, we
were able to begin

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.510
to push back on this threat.

00:12:30.510 --> 00:12:32.490
And one of the key
components, though,

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.000
was getting back to the
issue of transparency.

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.940
We created a tool called
The Blast-Zone.org.

00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:40.860
And this is a map.

00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:44.900
We're somewhere over in here
outside of the blast zone.

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.390
As more and more oil by
rail was being shipped,

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:51.750
the trains had a tendency to
explode more and more often.

00:12:51.750 --> 00:12:54.180
Usually because a
lot of the rails

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.850
are in somewhat isolated areas,
there were not a lot of deaths.

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:00.930
Thank god.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.590
But in some places, there were.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:06.540
In Lac-Megantic,
Quebec, 47 people

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:09.150
lost their lives in an
oil train explosion.

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:11.130
We had a number of
very close calls

00:13:11.130 --> 00:13:14.310
with, for example, an
oil train turning over

00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:17.040
in a tunnel in Seattle
during the summer.

00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.150
It didn't ignite.

00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:19.770
But there were so
many close calls

00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.750
and so many communities
were up in arms

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:26.007
and trying to fight this
that we created this tool.

00:13:26.007 --> 00:13:27.840
And it was really kind
of the next iteration

00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:29.280
of transparency for us.

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.780
This wasn't just
information we were

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.257
trying to get for ourselves.

00:13:32.257 --> 00:13:33.840
It was information
that we were trying

00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:35.940
to get, and then sort
of unleash it, and see

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:37.399
what people did with it.

00:13:37.399 --> 00:13:39.690
So you can put in any address
anywhere in North America

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.200
and find out how far you were
from the blast zone, which

00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.430
is the federally-defined area
where you can see from red,

00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:50.100
this is basically almost
sort of an incineration

00:13:50.100 --> 00:13:52.450
zone to an evacuation zone.

00:13:52.450 --> 00:13:54.720
You don't want to be
near any one of those.

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.180
And they go right through
many of our cities and towns.

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:00.650
So this was an incredible
mobilizing tool.

00:14:00.650 --> 00:14:05.530
We were able to allow groups all
over North America to use it.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:07.290
And they got the
attention of the mayor

00:14:07.290 --> 00:14:09.780
when the mayor's house
was in the blast zone,

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:12.240
the city councilor's house
was in the blast zone,

00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:15.640
when their schoolchildren, when
the school was in the blast

00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.140
zone.

00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:19.140
And it also led to a number
of reports that had never

00:14:19.140 --> 00:14:23.640
been possible before,
including many of the areas

00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:26.160
that we were working
on, like this picture

00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.680
here, were in very
low-income areas.

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:30.360
And so we were able
to actually use

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.990
demographic data, partnering
with environmental justice

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:38.340
groups, to show some of the
new terminals who was at risk.

00:14:38.340 --> 00:14:41.250
In many of these
places, it was 80%, 90%

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:43.500
and higher low-income
communities

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.150
and communities of color.

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.510
This also became a huge rallying
point for these communities

00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:53.370
to push their elected leaders to
reject the oil train terminals.

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.990
And over the course
of a few years,

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:02.770
we were able, with this network,
to beat over 20 oil train

00:15:02.770 --> 00:15:05.710
terminals and really
answer a threat that

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:11.220
was popping up everywhere in
an incredibly effective way.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:14.260
And a lot of it really came
down to transparency and access

00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:17.050
to the information.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.364
The Blast-Zone has been one
of the best tools we've ever

00:15:20.364 --> 00:15:22.030
come up with, and
it's the kind of thing

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.390
that is really way out
there for groups like us.

00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.094
It is an outlier,
and it's something

00:15:27.094 --> 00:15:29.260
that we actually need to
see a lot more of, I think,

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.020
in the future.

00:15:31.020 --> 00:15:35.620
Our work on climate change has
gone from oil infrastructure

00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:39.260
now more and more into
changing industries.

00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.580
We have a new campaign actually
launched as of this morning

00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.660
on the fashion industry.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:49.660
The fashion industry itself is
the fifth largest contributor

00:15:49.660 --> 00:15:51.550
to climate change,
if it were a nation.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:56.230
So that's about 5 and 1/2% of
total greenhouse gas emissions.

00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:58.630
And again, like we've
learned over time,

00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:01.360
we're trying to build
more and more transparency

00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:02.320
into this system.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.350
And there's a new
fledgling effort

00:16:05.350 --> 00:16:08.140
by a couple of our
allies, IPE, which

00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:12.310
is a group run by Ma Jun, the
Goldman Environmental Prize

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:15.010
winner, and NRDC is
partnering with this effort

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:21.990
as well, for the first time
to map factories in China

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:24.210
and the brands
associated with them.

00:16:24.210 --> 00:16:27.300
So you'll see Puma,
New Balance, Target.

00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:28.670
And this is a voluntary effort--

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:30.360
Esprit is also part
of this effort--

00:16:30.360 --> 00:16:33.090
it's a voluntary
effort to begin to show

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.000
where they're making
the shoes and apparel

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.780
that they manufacture.

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:43.700
And this is paired with
real-time pollution monitoring

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:44.490
data.

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:50.390
So any lack of compliance
is going to be known,

00:16:50.390 --> 00:16:53.420
and local people on the
ground can access this

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:56.640
and actually go to the factories
and see what's happening.

00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:00.380
And the photographic
and other information

00:17:00.380 --> 00:17:03.800
you can get when a mill
is out of compliance

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.380
will lead directly
to a complaint

00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.140
to the company that is
the ultimate buyer of what

00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:10.099
that factory makes.

00:17:10.099 --> 00:17:13.490
And I think this is the very
beginning of what's going

00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:15.049
to change the apparel sector.

00:17:17.780 --> 00:17:20.240
Our part of this is we
launched our campaign actually

00:17:20.240 --> 00:17:24.890
a few hours ago at
Levi's in San Francisco,

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.460
the iconic California
jeans company,

00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:31.820
and we are encouraging them to
get on the pathway to Paris.

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:35.360
I think part of how they are
going to be part of the broader

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:39.440
campaign is to set a real
goal to reduce their climate

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:40.580
impacts.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:43.700
This campaign is well timed
because it's very possible.

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:45.837
In fact, they have a
mill that waterless.

00:17:45.837 --> 00:17:47.670
They can be running
their mills not on coal,

00:17:47.670 --> 00:17:49.550
but on alternative energy.

00:17:49.550 --> 00:17:51.470
And this is an
effort that we think

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:56.420
will drive companies to produce
real long-term commitments

00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:59.090
and begin mapping
their supply chains.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:01.140
They're incredibly complex.

00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:03.860
And there's no way they
or officials in China

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:07.670
can possibly monitor it and
keep tabs on whether or not

00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:09.890
they're in compliance,
but this network

00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:13.850
of groups working on climate
issues and local pollution

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:14.810
issues can.

00:18:14.810 --> 00:18:19.990
So I think this is really a
whole new world when we're

00:18:19.990 --> 00:18:25.360
looking at what's possible
for mapping and giving access

00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:28.630
to ordinary citizens, let's
say nothing of local government

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.460
officials, about
what's happening

00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.120
in their homes, their towns, and
cities that might impact them.

00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:36.490
And so over time, over
the last two decades,

00:18:36.490 --> 00:18:38.420
I think that there
is this trend--

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:43.710
this is a very
imperfect calculation,

00:18:43.710 --> 00:18:47.820
the kind only a liberal arts
major would come up with.

00:18:47.820 --> 00:18:49.610
But I really think
that our work has

00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:51.200
shown over the last
couple of decades

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:54.890
that transparency plus
strategy equals change.

00:18:54.890 --> 00:19:02.900
And people like me who are
lawyers, campaign strategists,

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.791
media people,
that's most of what

00:19:04.791 --> 00:19:06.290
the environmental
movement is about,

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.930
and lawyers, and other folks.

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:12.250
And I think we need
to increasingly build

00:19:12.250 --> 00:19:14.540
a bridge to folks like
some of the people

00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:18.240
in this audience who know
how to manage data, capture

00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:21.620
data, and provide
simple access to people

00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:23.432
to be able to see
what's happening

00:19:23.432 --> 00:19:25.640
in their homes, what's
happening in the world, what's

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.960
happening with the companies
that they do business with.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.250
And I think this is
the recipe for change

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:32.690
that we really
have to look at it.

00:19:32.690 --> 00:19:35.690
When I look at Clayoquot Sound,
the Great Bear Rainforest, oil

00:19:35.690 --> 00:19:37.490
train work,
everything we've done

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.730
for two decades as a
pretty small group,

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.670
we've been able to
move millions of acres

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:45.950
to protection,
change industries,

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:48.890
and transparency has
been a big part of it.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.600
In the next decade,
you all know we

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.460
have a huge challenge
in front of us

00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.400
with climate change
and many other issues.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:57.800
I think that to
the extent that we

00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:00.890
can get folks that are
campaigners working with folks

00:20:00.890 --> 00:20:05.660
that are coders with
common cause to try to map

00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:07.694
and provide access to
information for some

00:20:07.694 --> 00:20:09.110
of our greatest
challenges, that's

00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.830
going to be how we provide
the world we want to hand off

00:20:12.830 --> 00:20:15.630
to our kids and to
the next generation.

00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:20.490
And here's to campaigners
and coders working together.

00:20:20.490 --> 00:20:22.835
Thank you so much for listening.

00:20:22.835 --> 00:20:26.090
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:27.874 --> 00:20:29.290
So that's the
formal presentation.

00:20:29.290 --> 00:20:32.390
We were actually hoping to get
into a little bit of dialogue,

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:35.560
because I think you
people who work at Google

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:38.230
and other tech
industries probably know

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:41.880
and have ideas about things that
we would never even think of.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:46.480
And so if you folks
think about what you do

00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.930
and some of the things
that we're trying to do,

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:51.760
there's a bunch of
issues that we're

00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:56.450
taking on beyond
the apparel sector,

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.480
including a new campaign
against the shipping sector.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.650
I'll just give you
one quick story,

00:21:02.650 --> 00:21:05.690
working with some
indigenous groups in Alaska

00:21:05.690 --> 00:21:09.940
and the Alaskan arctic whose
livelihoods, their culture

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:13.070
depends upon
hunting and fishing.

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.430
And the biggest
single threat to them

00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:19.240
is cruise ships coming
into their areas.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.390
It would be a huge thing.

00:21:20.390 --> 00:21:23.590
If they just knew when
the ships were coming,

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:26.261
and what ship it was, and when
they were arriving, and when

00:21:26.261 --> 00:21:27.010
they were leaving.

00:21:27.010 --> 00:21:31.930
And there are ways to do that
through different mapping

00:21:31.930 --> 00:21:38.500
and commercial vessel
traffic monitoring tools.

00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:41.530
But, like, how you take that
information and actually get it

00:21:41.530 --> 00:21:45.070
to something that's usable for
somebody in a First Nations

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:47.020
community, an
indigenous community,

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:51.640
so that they can begin to manage
this risk while we put pressure

00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:56.140
on Carnival to stay out of there
is just one of the many things

00:21:56.140 --> 00:21:59.897
we're like, somebody could
figure this out, but we can't.

00:21:59.897 --> 00:22:01.480
So I wanted to just
open it up and see

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:06.160
if you have, first of all,
questions or ideas on how

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.080
campaigners and coders
might work together

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:10.724
to tackle some of these things.

00:22:10.724 --> 00:22:12.390
AUDIENCE: Thank you
very much for coming

00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:13.473
and for your presentation.

00:22:13.473 --> 00:22:20.320
And I think that you and I
should talk later longer.

00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.260
I lead the Google Earth
Outreach team here at Google.

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:26.200
And our mission is
to empower everyone

00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:28.120
to use Google's
mapping tools to change

00:22:28.120 --> 00:22:30.586
the world in a
positive way, and we

00:22:30.586 --> 00:22:32.710
focus on different social
and environmental issues.

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.709
And I won't take
up this whole time.

00:22:34.709 --> 00:22:35.500
It's not my podium.

00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.070
But fishing, so you
probably may have

00:22:39.070 --> 00:22:40.930
heard of Global Fishing Watch.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:42.650
So our team did that.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:46.330
And what a cool idea to
repurpose that same data,

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:50.530
apply different kind of machine
learning and proximity alerts

00:22:50.530 --> 00:22:52.660
to be able to give
real time updates

00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:55.240
to indigenous communities
in Canada or wherever.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.190
We work very actively
with the First Nations,

00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:59.410
and aboriginal groups
in Canada, as well

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:03.564
as New Zealand, and Australia,
and, of course, US, and Brazil,

00:23:03.564 --> 00:23:04.230
and many others.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.580
So I see a lot of things
that could be repeated.

00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:08.740
And of course, with
Google, you want

00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:11.049
to start somewhere and then
repeat it and scale it so

00:23:11.049 --> 00:23:12.340
that everybody can have access.

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.890
And so there's that.

00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:17.000
I love that idea.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:18.260
So yes, we should talk.

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.910
That's a very cool idea.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:24.430
Second, supply tracking
is something that--

00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:26.060
we were at Rio+20.

00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:35.420
And Rio+20, I remember being in
this panel with Unilever's CEO,

00:23:35.420 --> 00:23:38.820
and Richard Branson,
and a couple of others.

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.801
And they were saying,
the Consumer Goods Forum.

00:23:40.801 --> 00:23:42.300
And I know that
that's still active,

00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:44.510
and I know Consumer
Goods Forum is

00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:48.650
doing great things
for sustainable

00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.070
management of goods.

00:23:50.070 --> 00:23:54.200
But I feel like
the tools out there

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.440
aren't living up to
the people's needs,

00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:59.600
your needs for supply tracking.

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:00.760
We've talked to Patagonia.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:03.500
They're, like,
superior in their kind

00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:06.960
of mapping their supply train
for some of their products.

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.960
They're also interested.

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:10.520
So there's a big,
huge desire for it,

00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:11.900
but it's super complicated.

00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:16.136
And I think even
though Google has data,

00:24:16.136 --> 00:24:19.730
we're starting to understand
that for our own products,

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:21.860
how to track our consumer goods.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.265
But we don't have the
history and probably

00:24:24.265 --> 00:24:25.890
the breadth of
knowledge that you have.

00:24:25.890 --> 00:24:28.280
So I'd love to have a
conversation about that,

00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:30.290
how we can map those.

00:24:30.290 --> 00:24:32.100
The map you have is fantastic.

00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:34.490
But then, how do you map--

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:35.642
how do you track?

00:24:35.642 --> 00:24:37.100
How do you tell
that kind of story?

00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:38.516
And we're good at
telling stories,

00:24:38.516 --> 00:24:40.370
but it's a different
kind of story,

00:24:40.370 --> 00:24:42.800
and you can't just throw it
into some story template.

00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:44.415
You got to really
understand pathways.

00:24:44.914 --> 00:24:46.430
TODD PAGLIA: And
it's not static.

00:24:46.430 --> 00:24:47.330
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:49.250
TODD PAGLIA: Each year, there
will be new factories to map.

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.208
AUDIENCE: Yep, totally.

00:24:50.208 --> 00:24:50.785
Yep.

00:24:50.785 --> 00:24:53.450
TODD PAGLIA: It'd have to be
flexible and able to adapt

00:24:53.450 --> 00:24:56.180
to changing circumstances
on the ground.

00:24:56.180 --> 00:24:57.890
AUDIENCE: That's right, yeah.

00:24:57.890 --> 00:25:00.650
And the last question I'll have,
and I'll let somebody else talk

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:04.100
or you can keep
going is I would love

00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:09.410
to know-- so I lead the effort
to map air pollution worldwide

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:12.705
and get that data into
everybody's hands.

00:25:12.705 --> 00:25:15.080
And one of that is just there's
the lack of measurements,

00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:16.790
so we're trying
to help that, too.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:21.340
And so I would love to know
when you talk about pollution,

00:25:21.340 --> 00:25:26.120
have you heard of the
Landsat group Pure Earth?

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.480
They were part of
the Landsat report

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:31.932
that just recently reported
that one in five people

00:25:31.932 --> 00:25:32.640
die of pollution.

00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:33.980
There's lots of different
kinds of pollution,

00:25:33.980 --> 00:25:35.570
but one in five people die
of pollution in the world.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:36.390
TODD PAGLIA: Yeah.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:39.890
AUDIENCE: And what's interesting
about that is they're

00:25:39.890 --> 00:25:42.620
trying to map it, so might be
an interesting collaboration

00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:42.740
there.

00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:43.940
But I would love to
talk more about, like,

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:45.890
when you said you
connect those supply

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:49.415
chain factories with pollution,
what kind of pollution?

00:25:49.415 --> 00:25:50.540
Where do you get that data?

00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.490
Because in China,
that's very sparse.

00:25:52.490 --> 00:25:53.360
Air is one thing.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:55.651
I know about air, but I don't
know about the other one.

00:25:55.651 --> 00:25:58.020
TODD PAGLIA: Well, so
there are actually--

00:25:58.020 --> 00:26:03.170
and this is largely
the work of IPE, which

00:26:03.170 --> 00:26:06.190
is a very small group like us.

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.047
But they have been
able to access--

00:26:09.047 --> 00:26:11.130
there's not a lot being
done with any information.

00:26:11.130 --> 00:26:13.160
It's real-time water
pollution information

00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:16.020
on a bunch of different
chemical outputs

00:26:16.020 --> 00:26:18.200
as well as air pollution.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:21.500
And because the government
is relatively small

00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:25.350
and doesn't enforce, nobody
does anything with that data,

00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:26.515
but it's there.

00:26:26.515 --> 00:26:29.098
AUDIENCE: And who put that-- did
they put it on the factories,

00:26:29.098 --> 00:26:32.330
and the factory voluntarily
put it on their [INAUDIBLE]??

00:26:32.330 --> 00:26:35.330
TODD PAGLIA: The actual
government is requiring it.

00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:36.230
AUDIENCE: Oh, OK.

00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:38.800
TODD PAGLIA: And so what's
happening is basically,

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:43.790
IPE is tapping into that data
and just beginning to map it.

00:26:43.790 --> 00:26:46.340
But it's not leading to
any compliance efforts

00:26:46.340 --> 00:26:47.930
by the Chinese government.

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:50.690
But when something gets out
of compliance and people

00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.226
email these companies
directly, it gets fixed.

00:26:53.226 --> 00:26:53.850
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:56.450
TODD PAGLIA: So
expanding on that

00:26:56.450 --> 00:26:59.660
and having somebody
other than us, and IPE,

00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.969
and NRDC doing this
would be incredible.

00:27:01.969 --> 00:27:03.010
AUDIENCE: That's amazing.

00:27:03.010 --> 00:27:04.450
What does IPE stand for again?

00:27:04.450 --> 00:27:07.640
TODD PAGLIA: Well, in Chinese,
it makes a lot more sense.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.882
[LAUGHTER]

00:27:08.882 --> 00:27:10.632
AUDIENCE: OK, so I'll
follow up and we can

00:27:10.632 --> 00:27:11.923
talk more about ideas together.

00:27:11.923 --> 00:27:13.610
TODD PAGLIA: Yeah,
that sounds great.

00:27:13.610 --> 00:27:14.680
Thank you.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:15.860
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.160
Thank you very much.

00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:18.660
I really enjoyed
your presentation.

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:22.040
I also would like to second I
love the idea of transparency

00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:26.860
as a tool to allow people to do
what they want to do and know

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:28.730
is right.

00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:30.560
I'm part of the
Geo Organization,

00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:36.020
and my teams do the aerial,
and satellite, and street view

00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:39.950
geometry and reconstruction
of all over the planet.

00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:44.570
And I'm also heading up the
nascent geo augmented reality.

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:48.440
And we are interested
in what kinds

00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:50.580
of applications using
augmented reality--

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.700
So what this means
is that Google

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:57.470
has this incredible asset of a
very rich, detailed, physical

00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:59.130
model of the world.

00:27:59.130 --> 00:28:01.280
And we can marry
that with people

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:07.250
being able to create
content, virtual content,

00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:10.630
and pin it to the world,
and it's [? ACLED ?]

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:12.050
and shared appropriately.

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:13.910
So as you were talking,
I was thinking, boy,

00:28:13.910 --> 00:28:16.190
I could easily imagine
applications of somebody

00:28:16.190 --> 00:28:18.380
holding up their device--
or there might be headsets

00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:19.880
in the future--

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:21.980
looking at the
dress in the window,

00:28:21.980 --> 00:28:25.580
and not just getting information
about the cost, and sizes,

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:30.110
and so forth, but the source of
where the material came from,

00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:33.380
what factories, what the
environmental footprint

00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:36.650
of that, and maybe even
push a button that says,

00:28:36.650 --> 00:28:38.680
tell the manufacturer
that you love this dress

00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:42.437
or you'd love it even more if
they were more responsible--

00:28:42.437 --> 00:28:43.270
something like that.

00:28:43.270 --> 00:28:46.760
So I would be very interested in
talking with you and your team

00:28:46.760 --> 00:28:51.290
about what applications could
be developed using this ability

00:28:51.290 --> 00:28:54.710
to augment a model of
the physical world that's

00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:57.710
visible to anyone
and would give them

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:00.380
more information
about the products,

00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.290
maybe holding it up to
factories in the city

00:29:03.290 --> 00:29:05.069
to tell you what that
factory is doing,

00:29:05.069 --> 00:29:06.860
and putting it right
in the hands of people

00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.859
on their mobile devices.

00:29:07.859 --> 00:29:09.570
TODD PAGLIA: Yeah, that's great.

00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:14.990
One of the things that's been
incredible over the last, oh,

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:18.590
year or so is that
we've had so many more

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:21.650
people wanting to
be active, wanting

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:24.800
to try to take control
of the choices they make,

00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:27.290
what's happening in
their cities and towns.

00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:29.120
And we've had, in
some cases, like,

00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:31.370
add a zero to a number
of people showing up

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:33.600
for a protest or demonstration.

00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:36.980
And so right now, the
appetite for people out there

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:39.540
to actually have information
they can take action on

00:29:39.540 --> 00:29:41.149
is higher than it's
ever been in my 20

00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:42.440
years of working on this stuff.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:45.110
So that would be an
incredible tool to have.

00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:47.450
AUDIENCE: And that's just one.

00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:49.970
This group also--
and you're related

00:29:49.970 --> 00:29:54.620
to the Sunroof Group of
identifying good areas

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:56.257
for putting in solar panels.

00:29:56.257 --> 00:29:58.340
We could partner with stuff
like that, also again,

00:29:58.340 --> 00:29:59.660
with augmented reality,
where you could

00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.790
have virtual landmarks
to show you appropriate

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.130
places for whatever.

00:30:04.130 --> 00:30:07.310
This is a fertile area
for attention in some way.

00:30:07.310 --> 00:30:09.490
You can do that with
virtual landmarking.

00:30:09.490 --> 00:30:13.350
TODD PAGLIA: So I have a
question maybe for you, too,

00:30:13.350 --> 00:30:14.700
but maybe for someone else.

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.000
So one of the things
that we were thinking

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:22.950
about with the shipping
issue is that these ships

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:25.640
run on a variety
of different fuels.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.130
And we're trying to get
permanent change towards much

00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:31.280
more sustainable fuels,
but the switch fuels.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:35.780
So in addition to being able--
like we had a very small system

00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:37.844
that allowed us to track--

00:30:37.844 --> 00:30:40.010
it was really funky and put
together by volunteers--

00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:42.650
to track ships in
Puget Sound that

00:30:42.650 --> 00:30:44.672
were carrying tar sands oil.

00:30:44.672 --> 00:30:46.130
And then we would
kind of lose them

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.270
at the mouth of the
Strait of Juan de Fuca,

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:51.050
and then they would show up
elsewhere at certain times.

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:53.780
It was very funky,
but some people really

00:30:53.780 --> 00:30:56.420
liked it because they
would be out in the islands

00:30:56.420 --> 00:31:00.690
and they could see a tanker and
say, that's a tar sands tanker.

00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:03.066
So that feels like that's
something that's very possible.

00:31:03.066 --> 00:31:04.523
And the thing I
was wondering about

00:31:04.523 --> 00:31:06.410
is because of the
fuel switching,

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:08.770
again, what we've seen
over the last 20 years

00:31:08.770 --> 00:31:09.770
is government shrinking.

00:31:09.770 --> 00:31:13.530
There's no enforcement
of fuel switching.

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:18.020
But is there a way using
satellite data to tell, like,

00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.205
if you look at the ship--

00:31:19.205 --> 00:31:21.080
AUDIENCE: What do you
mean by fuel switching?

00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:22.530
A boat goes up next to
it and they're like,

00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:24.904
OK, let me give you your fuel,
and then you go off, and--

00:31:24.904 --> 00:31:28.080
TODD PAGLIA: So this
ship right here,

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:30.460
it would still be horrendous,
but there would not

00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:32.740
be a black plume of
smoke when they're

00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:35.307
within certain
distances of the shore.

00:31:35.307 --> 00:31:36.140
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:31:36.140 --> 00:31:36.325
TODD PAGLIA: Right?

00:31:36.325 --> 00:31:38.325
And then they switch to
a different type of fuel

00:31:38.325 --> 00:31:41.117
once they're a dozen
miles offshore.

00:31:41.117 --> 00:31:43.450
But nobody knows if they're
actually complying with what

00:31:43.450 --> 00:31:43.620
they're--

00:31:43.620 --> 00:31:45.115
AUDIENCE: Cheaper [INAUDIBLE].

00:31:45.115 --> 00:31:46.210
TODD PAGLIA: Exactly.

00:31:46.210 --> 00:31:48.580
They mostly use heavy fuel
oil, which is actually

00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:50.060
a solid at room temperature.

00:31:50.060 --> 00:31:52.660
It's like the grossest stuff
you could possibly burn.

00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:55.450
But is it possible
to in addition

00:31:55.450 --> 00:31:57.850
to mapping the ships, could
you figure out how to map

00:31:57.850 --> 00:31:59.710
what they're burning?

00:31:59.710 --> 00:32:03.340
Because there's a
footprint, a visible

00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.169
footprint in many cases.

00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:10.250
AUDIENCE: Well, as micro
satellites become more common

00:32:10.250 --> 00:32:13.620
by some companies on
the planet, for example,

00:32:13.620 --> 00:32:15.170
we're going to have
an eye in the--

00:32:15.170 --> 00:32:18.220
the society is going to have
an eye in the sky in more

00:32:18.220 --> 00:32:20.440
frequent intervals.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:25.210
And that's good because their
mapping satellites are, like,

00:32:25.210 --> 00:32:27.016
one meter or five meters.

00:32:27.016 --> 00:32:29.770
Like, you can see every--

00:32:29.770 --> 00:32:31.840
at least twice a day--

00:32:31.840 --> 00:32:34.570
don't quote me, but if you
can imagine a world where you,

00:32:34.570 --> 00:32:36.040
like, twice or
three times a day,

00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:39.140
you could see that's a ship.

00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:40.370
Wow, look at the plume.

00:32:40.370 --> 00:32:43.584
It's a half mile
long and this color.

00:32:43.584 --> 00:32:44.207
That's good.

00:32:44.207 --> 00:32:45.790
I don't know if we're
quite there yet.

00:32:45.790 --> 00:32:48.405
I'm not a super expert,
but when we all talk,

00:32:48.405 --> 00:32:50.530
you can connect to the
right people that know more.

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:52.910
AUDIENCE: Hi. thank
you so much for coming.

00:32:52.910 --> 00:32:55.930
I actually come from a long line
of sustainability work myself,

00:32:55.930 --> 00:32:58.814
and I was at the WTO
conference in 1999,

00:32:58.814 --> 00:32:59.980
if you remember, in Seattle.

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:00.670
TODD PAGLIA: I was there.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:01.496
In tear gas.

00:33:01.496 --> 00:33:02.510
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:03.190
Yeah, me too.

00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:04.700
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:04.700 --> 00:33:07.570
And anyway, so I've been in
the sustainability movement

00:33:07.570 --> 00:33:11.770
for a very long time, ranging
from United Nations conferences

00:33:11.770 --> 00:33:14.600
to the WTO to a lot of others.

00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.350
And what has struck
me time and again

00:33:17.350 --> 00:33:19.510
is that every time I go
to these conferences,

00:33:19.510 --> 00:33:20.560
and then we'd go out--

00:33:20.560 --> 00:33:23.530
some of us panelists
or attendees

00:33:23.530 --> 00:33:26.320
would go out to dinner,
and we'd go out.

00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.630
We'd leave the hotel, and
there's the real world.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:30.580
There are people
walking on the street,

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.038
and they're looking at their
iPhones, and they're chatting.

00:33:33.038 --> 00:33:37.240
And I'm like, do they
think about these things?

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.520
And so over these
years, and also because

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:41.260
of a previous
career in Hollywood,

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:45.460
being kind of on the other
side of things in storytelling,

00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:48.610
it kind of dawned on me over
time that what you really need

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:52.611
is storytelling on a very
emotional, very emotive level,

00:33:52.611 --> 00:33:53.110
right?

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:53.900
TODD PAGLIA: Yeah.

00:33:53.900 --> 00:33:55.483
AUDIENCE: And that
has to start young.

00:33:55.483 --> 00:33:57.280
I mean, I have a
seven-year-old daughter,

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:00.220
and she loves Minecraft, but
she also likes little birdies.

00:34:00.220 --> 00:34:04.510
She'll stop dead and just
look at hummingbirds.

00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:08.320
And so I think if we can
encourage in our children

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:11.500
this very real connection
to the real world, not just

00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.610
technology, right?

00:34:12.610 --> 00:34:15.880
It kind of has to go
hand-in-hand, I think.

00:34:15.880 --> 00:34:18.980
Because if not, then we
really become disconnected,

00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:20.469
and I see that.

00:34:20.469 --> 00:34:24.310
So what I'm actually
actively doing is in my team,

00:34:24.310 --> 00:34:26.260
trying to see how
can we use technology

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.719
to tell these
stories, not overtly.

00:34:28.719 --> 00:34:31.389
Not saying, hey, did you
know that you should never

00:34:31.389 --> 00:34:33.219
go on a cruise ship
because they pollute?

00:34:33.219 --> 00:34:36.370
But tell stories through
mythology, through fiction,

00:34:36.370 --> 00:34:37.300
through narratives.

00:34:37.300 --> 00:34:40.420
I would love to see
"Game of Thrones"

00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:42.629
mention something about that.

00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:43.920
AUDIENCE: What team are you on?

00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.639
AUDIENCE: Google Assistant.

00:34:44.639 --> 00:34:45.472
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:34:45.472 --> 00:34:46.520
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:48.699
And so we reach out there.

00:34:48.699 --> 00:34:53.290
And for example, we
have Earth Day content.

00:34:53.290 --> 00:34:56.170
And I also suggested,
well, if you

00:34:56.170 --> 00:34:58.870
do Christmas holiday
suggestions, why don't you

00:34:58.870 --> 00:35:00.910
put in something
about green Christmas?

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:02.510
And so my team liked that.

00:35:02.510 --> 00:35:04.060
So even little
tidbits like, hey,

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.430
consider the packaging
that you're buying,

00:35:06.430 --> 00:35:09.970
because the gift wrapping gets
ripped off, and off it goes.

00:35:09.970 --> 00:35:10.750
It's one use.

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:11.620
TODD PAGLIA: Yeah.

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.440
AUDIENCE: So that's what I'm
thinking about constantly

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:19.090
is how can we tell these
kinds of very emotive stories,

00:35:19.090 --> 00:35:20.140
and as young as possible?

00:35:20.140 --> 00:35:20.710
TODD PAGLIA: Yeah.

00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:22.460
AUDIENCE: And I'm not
trying to brainwash,

00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:25.060
but it's just how we're
biologically wired.

00:35:25.060 --> 00:35:27.560
We're biologically
wired for stories,

00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:29.470
for the stories of our elders.

00:35:29.470 --> 00:35:32.200
Our elders right now are movies.

00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.340
TODD PAGLIA: Yeah.

00:35:33.340 --> 00:35:35.110
And the environmental
movement needs a lot

00:35:35.110 --> 00:35:37.101
of help with the
stories, because we're

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:38.350
getting a little better at it.

00:35:38.350 --> 00:35:41.170
But the story that
everything is terrible

00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:44.605
and we're all going to
die is really not working.

00:35:44.605 --> 00:35:47.000
AUDIENCE: It never did.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.760
TODD PAGLIA: We have
a campaign right now

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.580
against Starbucks
because of their cups.

00:35:51.580 --> 00:35:53.560
This is just an
example of, like,

00:35:53.560 --> 00:35:56.250
to think about how we could
tell this story better.

00:35:56.250 --> 00:35:58.267
So their cups are
not recyclable.

00:35:58.267 --> 00:35:59.350
Everybody thinks they are.

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:00.730
They're not.

00:36:00.730 --> 00:36:03.400
They go here four
billion of them per year.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.722
And this is our
cup wall, which we

00:36:05.722 --> 00:36:07.180
have in front of
their headquarters

00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:11.050
every once in awhile, which
is 8,181 cups, which is 1

00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:13.156
minute of Starbucks cups.

00:36:13.156 --> 00:36:14.780
And so if you think
about storytelling,

00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:16.690
so you have a forest.

00:36:16.690 --> 00:36:19.120
And then the process
to make this cup,

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:21.316
it's in your hand
for 20 minutes,

00:36:21.316 --> 00:36:22.690
and it's in the
landfill forever.

00:36:22.690 --> 00:36:23.740
AUDIENCE: Are they compostable?

00:36:23.740 --> 00:36:24.590
TODD PAGLIA: Nope.

00:36:24.590 --> 00:36:26.687
AUDIENCE: Why aren't
they compostable?

00:36:26.687 --> 00:36:28.270
TODD PAGLIA: Because
they just haven't

00:36:28.270 --> 00:36:31.390
been sufficiently motivated,
but we're getting there.

00:36:31.390 --> 00:36:32.680
Yeah, it's a plastic liner.

00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:33.596
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:33.596 --> 00:36:35.040
TODD PAGLIA: Yeah, I know.

00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.600
Well, the thing is
they're kind of like--

00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:39.762
I joke about them being
sort of like Canada.

00:36:39.762 --> 00:36:42.220
Like, everybody, because of
health care and the good things

00:36:42.220 --> 00:36:44.340
Canada does, they think
they're environmental.

00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:46.447
Same thing with Starbucks,
because they are really

00:36:46.447 --> 00:36:47.530
good companies as far as--

00:36:47.530 --> 00:36:48.430
AUDIENCE: Fair trade.

00:36:48.430 --> 00:36:51.520
TODD PAGLIA: Fair trade,
good wages, pay for college,

00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.530
hire all sorts of
different groups

00:36:53.530 --> 00:36:55.210
of post-military refugee.

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:57.950
Like, they're great, but
they're terrible on this issue.

00:36:57.950 --> 00:37:00.550
And there's got to be a way
to tell this story that's

00:37:00.550 --> 00:37:04.050
empowering and not, like,
oh, another bad thing,

00:37:04.050 --> 00:37:05.690
because they're going to change.

00:37:05.690 --> 00:37:06.650
It's going to take
us a little while,

00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:07.210
but they're going to change.

00:37:07.210 --> 00:37:09.070
But it's exactly, I
think, the kind of thing

00:37:09.070 --> 00:37:11.120
that we need to tell
in a better way.

00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.180
So tell me how to
tell that story.

00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:17.010
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
the interesting talk.

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:19.380
So in the spirit of what
previous questioners have done,

00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:20.796
I'll start with
my qualifications.

00:37:20.796 --> 00:37:23.074
I was camped at the Black
Hole in the summer of '93.

00:37:23.074 --> 00:37:24.240
You'll know what that means.

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.310
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.680
But my question is
about transparency,

00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.110
and I'm wondering what the
obstacles have been to that.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.276
For example, I would think
a forest company wouldn't

00:37:33.276 --> 00:37:36.240
want its competitors knowing
who its clients were,

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:41.190
or an apparel
company's competitors

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:45.195
knowing who its suppliers were.

00:37:45.195 --> 00:37:48.086
TODD PAGLIA: Transparency
is always impossible.

00:37:48.086 --> 00:37:50.850
AUDIENCE: What obstacles
have you run into with that,

00:37:50.850 --> 00:37:52.075
and what can we do about it?

00:37:52.075 --> 00:37:52.825
TODD PAGLIA: Yeah.

00:37:52.825 --> 00:37:57.590
We started tracking or trying
to track extreme oil, so

00:37:57.590 --> 00:38:00.020
oil from the tar sands.

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:05.270
And we were told by our
allies, funders, and companies,

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:06.350
you cannot track it.

00:38:06.350 --> 00:38:08.150
Like, it was not possible.

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:11.990
Not only do they not
want it to be tracked.

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:15.017
They didn't think it
was possible to track.

00:38:15.017 --> 00:38:16.850
But if you think about
it, it's a little bit

00:38:16.850 --> 00:38:20.000
like pulp and paper, which they
also said it was impossible.

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.290
But it's all connected.

00:38:21.290 --> 00:38:23.840
Like, with oil,
it's even easier.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.530
It's a pipe.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:27.410
Like, it's a pipe from one
place to a refinery, and a pipe

00:38:27.410 --> 00:38:30.930
from there to somewhere else,
and then eventually to trucks.

00:38:30.930 --> 00:38:34.700
So we started going about
mapping it not the way

00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:38.030
you folks map it, but very
sort of, like, notebooks,

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:43.070
and tracking a truck that left
a certain refinery that we knew

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:47.180
had tar sands, following
it to a refueling station,

00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:50.840
and then seeing corporate
semis come in and refuel there,

00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:53.540
thus linking them
to the tar sands.

00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:54.710
And so we did that.

00:38:54.710 --> 00:38:57.650
And eventually, we got
all these companies

00:38:57.650 --> 00:39:03.740
to agree to get off of using tar
sands oil to fuel their fleets.

00:39:03.740 --> 00:39:06.410
They didn't like it
because they don't

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.090
want a lot of transparency.

00:39:08.090 --> 00:39:12.090
It results in a lack of control.

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:15.150
And the whole idea that
everything is a trade secret

00:39:15.150 --> 00:39:17.510
is insane, and that's
what they usually

00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:20.220
trot out in one way or another.

00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:22.160
But what we've seen
over the last 20 years

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:25.990
is once transparency is
sort of forced upon them,

00:39:25.990 --> 00:39:28.720
that they operate just fine.

00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:31.360
Everything from pulp paper to
two-by-fours, like, yes, there

00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:35.260
are some things that are actual
trade secrets 99% of what they

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.440
say are trade secrets are not.

00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.730
And so we're willing
to carve out that 1%.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:40.510
Fine.

00:39:40.510 --> 00:39:42.100
You can keep that secret.

00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.540
But the world, I think, is
going in this direction,

00:39:46.540 --> 00:39:48.190
and Google is one
of the drivers.

00:39:48.190 --> 00:39:49.750
And I think that
companies that are

00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:52.210
going to succeed in
the next decade-plus

00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:54.020
are going to be able
to deal with it.

00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:56.650
And those that can't are
going to suffer, I think,

00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:58.541
in the marketplace.

00:39:58.541 --> 00:40:00.040
And it's not something
they're going

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.950
to like or be comfortable with,
but it's happening anyway.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:06.280
And every industry that we've
seen that we've worked with

00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:09.410
has said it's impossible and
then was able to deal with it.

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:12.697
So I think it's more
myth than anything else.

00:40:12.697 --> 00:40:13.530
AUDIENCE: All right.

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:15.210
Well, thank you, Mr. Paglia.

00:40:15.210 --> 00:40:17.390
Thank you, everyone, for coming.

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:19.922
TODD PAGLIA: Thank you for
your questions and your ideas.

00:40:19.922 --> 00:40:20.880
I really appreciate it.

00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:24.230
[APPLAUSE]
