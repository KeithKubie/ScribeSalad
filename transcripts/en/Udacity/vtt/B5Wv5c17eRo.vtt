Now that we know that information about the registration fees, what do you

00:00:03.856 --> 00:00:07.672
notice about the hourly car rental rate? Think about this for both of the

00:00:07.672 --> 00:00:11.927
companies and then answer this question. Which lengths of time could you rent a

00:00:11.927 --> 00:00:16.134
car from either company and pay the same amount? Check any of these answers that

00:00:16.134 --> 00:00:20.183
apply. Or maybe they never cost the same or maybe they always cost the same.
