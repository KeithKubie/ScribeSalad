So far we've seen success with loading image data. But it would be great if we

00:00:03.349 --> 00:00:07.068
could extend this functionality into loading JavaScript files too. The good

00:00:07.068 --> 00:00:10.524
news is that you can add a JavaScript file to the DOM dynamically and just like

00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:15.578
with images, you get a callback function, once the file has been loaded. So,

00:00:15.578 --> 00:00:18.384
what you need to do now, is to fill in the rest of this code, to allow the load

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:21.052
assets function to take a list of file names, which might be images, or

00:00:21.052 --> 00:00:25.768
JavaScript, and load them correctly. Which means is that in here, before we

00:00:25.768 --> 00:00:28.792
actually issue off our command, we need to figure out what type of file we're

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:33.066
trying to load. Tricky, tricky. You may have to look at the file name's

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.840
extension, to determine this.
