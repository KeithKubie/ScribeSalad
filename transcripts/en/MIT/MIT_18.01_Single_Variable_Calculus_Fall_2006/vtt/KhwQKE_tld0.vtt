00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.000
PROFESSOR: Now, today
we are continuing

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.090
with this last unit.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.650
Unit 5, continued.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:48.490
The informal title of this unit
is Dealing With Infinity.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:53.280
That's really the extra little
piece that we're putting in to

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.080
our discussions of things like
limits and integrals.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:09.680
To start out with today, I'd
like to recall for you,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:20.290
L'Hopital's Rule.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.180
And in keeping with the spirit
here, we're just going to do

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:32.670
the infinity / infinity case.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.140
I stated this a little
differently last time, and I

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.750
want to state it again today.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.220
Just to make clear what the
hypotheses are and what the

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.880
conclusion is.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.350
We start out with, really,
three hypotheses.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.160
Two of them are kind
of obvious.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.020
The three hypotheses are that
f (x) tends to infinity, g (

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.000
x) tends to infinity, that's
what it means to be in this

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.380
infinity / infinity case.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.160
And then the last assumption
is that f ' ( x) / g ' (x),

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.660
tends to a limit, L. And this
is all as x tends to some a.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.180
Some limit a.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:27.470
And then the conclusion is that
f( x) / g ( x) also tends

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:37.260
to L, as x goes to a.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.900
Now, so that's the way it is.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.750
So it's three limits.

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.660
But presumably these are
obvious, and this one is

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.180
exactly what we were going
to check anyway.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.790
Gives us this one limit.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:54.390
So that's the statement.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.620
And then the other little
interesting point here, which

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.610
is consistent with this idea of
dealing with infinity, is

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.570
that a equals plus or minus
infinity and L equals plus or

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.590
minus infinity are OK.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.990
That is, the numbers capital L,
the limit capital L and the

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:21.090
number a can also be infinite.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.240
Now in recitation yesterday,
you should have discussed

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.830
something about rates of growth,
which follow from what

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.970
I said in lecture last time and
also maybe from some more

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.440
detailed discussions that
you had in recitation.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.130
And I'm going to introduce a
notation to compare functions.

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.270
Namely, we say that f ( x) is
a lot less than g ( x).

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:58.330
So this means that the limit,
as it goes to infinity, this

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.280
tends to 0.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.700
As x goes to infinity,
this would be.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.310
So this is a notation, a new
notation for us. f is a lot

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.160
less than g.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.150
And it's meant to be read
only asymptotically.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.890
It's only in the limit
as x goes to

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.890
infinity that this happens.

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.510
And implicitly here, I'm always
assuming that these are

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:28.130
positive quantities. f
and g are positive.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.230
What you saw in recitation was
that you can make a systematic

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.950
comparison of all the standard
functions that we know about.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:38.050
For example, the ln function
goes to infinity.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.500
But a lot more slowly
than x to a power.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.920
A lot more slowly then e^ x.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:48.220
A lot more slowly than,
say, e ^ x ^2.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.850
So this one is slow.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.580
This one is moderate.

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.830
And this one is fast.
And this one is very

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:02.900
fast. Going to infinity.

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:04.650
Tends to infinity, and
this is of course

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.570
as x goes to infinity.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:12.270
All of them go to infinity, but
at quite different rates.

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.630
And, analogous to this, and
today we're going to be doing

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:23.530
this, needing to do this quite
a bit, is rates of decay,

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:26.460
which are more or less the
opposite of rates of growth.

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.270
So rates of decay are rates
at which things tend to 0.

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:39.820
So the rate of decay, and for
that I'm just going to take

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:41.890
reciprocals of these numbers.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:45.820
So 1 / ln x tends to 0.

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.260
But rather slowly.

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:51.220
It's much bigger
than 1 / x ^ p.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.910
Oh, I didn't mention that
this exponent p

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:55.750
is meant to be positive.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:58.360
That's a convention that I'm
using without saying.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.310
I should've told you that.

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:06.790
So think x ^ 1/2, x ^ 1, x ^2,
they're all in this sort of

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:09.000
moderate intermediate range.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.860
And then that, in turn, goes to
0 but much more slowly then

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.220
1 / e ^ x, also known
as e^ - x.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.220
And that, in turn, this guy
here goes to 0 incredibly

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:33.270
fast. e ^ - x ^2 vanishes
really, really fast. So this

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.130
is a review of the
L'Hopital's Rule.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.140
What we said last time, and the
application of it, which

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:43.870
is to rates of growth and tells
us what these rates of

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:50.860
growth are.

00:06:50.860 --> 00:07:01.830
Today, I want to talk about
improper integrals.

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:07.430
And improper integrals, we've
already really seen one or two

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.050
of them on your exercises.

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.950
And we mention them a
little bit, briefly.

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:14.120
I'm just going to go through
them more carefully and more

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.110
systematically now.

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.180
And we want to get just exactly
what's going on with

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:20.910
these rates of decay and
their relationship

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:21.940
with improper integrals.

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.490
So I need for you to understand
on the spectrum of

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.380
the range of functions like
this, which ones are suitable

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:38.320
for integration as x
goes to infinity.

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.130
Well, let's start out
with the definition.

00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.780
The integral from a to infinity
of f(x) dx is, by

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:55.780
definition the limit as n goes
to infinity of the ordinary

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:00.430
definite integral up to some
fixed, finite level.

00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:01.760
That's the definition.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:07.550
And there's a word that we use
here, which is that we say the

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:15.150
integral, so this is terminology
for it, converges

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:20.560
if the limit exists.

00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:28.630
And diverges if not.

00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:34.340
Well, these are the key
words for today.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:39.870
So here's the issue that we're
going to be addressing.

00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.430
Which is whether the limit
exists or not.

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.260
In other words, whether
the integral

00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:50.820
converges or diverges.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:54.270
These notions have a geometric
analog, which you should

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:56.320
always be thinking of at
the same time in the

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:57.730
back of your head.

00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:00.840
I'll draw a picture of the
function Here it's

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.510
starting out at a.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:05.790
And maybe it's going
down like this.

00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:09.840
And it's interpreting
it geometrically.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:15.520
This would only work
if f is positive.

00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:18.830
Then the convergent
case is the case

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:25.900
where the area is finite.

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:29.660
So the total area is finite
under this curve.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:43.750
And the other case is the
total area is infinite.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:46.920
I claim that both of these
things are possible.

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:51.910
Although this thing goes on
forever, if you stop it at one

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:54.310
stage, n, then of course
it's a finite number.

00:09:54.310 --> 00:09:56.590
But as you go further and
further and further, there's

00:09:56.590 --> 00:09:58.290
more and more and more area.

00:09:58.290 --> 00:10:00.420
And there are two
possibilities.

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:04.860
Either as you go all the way
out here to infinity, the

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:08.900
total that you get adds
up to a finite total.

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.280
Or else, maybe there's
infinitely much.

00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.700
For instance, if it's a straight
line going across,

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:23.340
there's clearly infinitely
much area underneath.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:25.500
So we need to do a bunch
of examples.

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.360
And that's really our main job
for the day, and to make sure

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.810
that we know exactly what
to expect in all cases.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:42.390
The first example is the
integral from 0 to infinity of

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:45.410
e^ - kx dx.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.550
Where k is going to be
some positive number.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:54.080
Some positive constant.

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:58.670
This is the most fundamental,
by far, of

00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:02.970
the definite integrals.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:03.710
Improper integrals.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:07.370
And in order to handle this, the
thing that I need to do is

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:13.000
to check the integral from
0 up to n. e ^ - kx dx.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.080
And since this is an easy
integral to evaluate, we're

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.650
going to do it.

00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:22.590
It's - 1 / k e ^ - kx, that's
the antiderivative.

00:11:22.590 --> 00:11:26.450
Evaluated at 0 and n.

00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:37.320
And that, if I plug in these
values, is - 1 / k, e^ - k N.

00:11:37.320 --> 00:11:46.860
Minus, and if I evaluate it at
0, I get a (- 1 / k) e^ 0.

00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:48.690
So there's the answer.

00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:51.120
And now we have to think
about what happens

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.040
as n goes to infinity.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:12:00.290
So as n goes to infinity, what's
happening is the second

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.400
term here stays unchanged.

00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:06.940
But the first term is e to
some negative power.

00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:08.700
And the exponent is getting
larger and larger.

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:10.830
That's because k is
positive here.

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:12.590
You've definitely got
to pay attention.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.020
Even though I'm doing this with
general variables here,

00:12:15.020 --> 00:12:17.940
you've got to pay attention
to signs of things.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:20.130
Because otherwise you'll always
get the wrong answer.

00:12:20.130 --> 00:12:22.710
So you have to pay very
close attention here.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.450
So this is, if you like, e ^
minus infinity in the limit,

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:26.720
which is 0.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:30.720
And so in the limit, this
thing tends to 0.

00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:33.870
And this thing is just
equal to 1 / k.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:43.610
And so all told, the answer
is 1 / k And that's it.

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.100
Now we're going to abbreviate
this a little bit.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:48.390
This thought process, you're
going to have to go through

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:50.070
every single time you do this.

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:53.400
But after a while you also get
good enough at it that you can

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:55.770
make it a little bit
less cluttered.

00:12:55.770 --> 00:13:09.350
So let me show you a shorthand
for this same calculation.

00:13:09.350 --> 00:13:14.650
Namely, I write 0 to infinity
e ^ - kx dx.

00:13:14.650 --> 00:13:23.890
And that's equal to - 1 / k
e ^ - kx 0 to infinity.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:27.710
That was cute.

00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:35.600
Not small enough, however.

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.490
So, here we are.

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:38.290
We have the same calculation
as we had before.

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.400
But now we're thinking, really,
in our minds that this

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.100
infinity is some very,
very enormous number.

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:44.790
And we're going to plug it in.

00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.060
And you can either do this
in your head or not.

00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.760
You say - 1 / k e^ - infinity.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.510
Here's where I've used the
fact that k is positive.

00:13:53.510 --> 00:13:57.300
Because e ^ - k times a large
number is minus infinity.

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:01.090
And then here + 1
/ k - (- 1 / k).

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:05.780
Let me write it the same
way I did before.

00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:11.840
And that's just equal to 0 + 1
/ k, which is what we want.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.470
So this is the same calculation,
just slightly

00:14:14.470 --> 00:14:17.430
abbreviated.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.740
Yeah.

00:14:17.740 --> 00:14:18.180
Question.

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:29.050
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:29.050 --> 00:14:30.770
PROFESSOR: Good question.

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:31.960
The question is, what
about the case when

00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:34.830
the limit is infinity?

00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:37.980
I'm distinguishing between
something existing and its

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:39.690
limit being infinity here.

00:14:39.690 --> 00:14:45.330
Whenever I make a discussion
of limits, I say a finite

00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:49.100
limit, or in this case, it works
for infinite limits.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.230
So in other words, when
I say exists, I mean

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.970
exists and is finite.

00:14:54.970 --> 00:14:58.190
So here, when I say that it
converges and I say the limit

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:00.500
exists, what I mean is that
it's a finite number.

00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.630
And so that's indeed
what I said here.

00:15:02.630 --> 00:15:04.570
The total area is finite.

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.100
And, similarly, over here.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:08.460
I might add, however, that
there is another

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:09.770
part of this subject.

00:15:09.770 --> 00:15:11.410
Which I'm skipping entirely.

00:15:11.410 --> 00:15:13.020
Which is a little bit subtle.

00:15:13.020 --> 00:15:14.330
Which is the following.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.020
If f changes sign, there can
be some cancellation and

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.040
oscillation.

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.060
And then sometimes the limit
exists, but the total area, if

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:25.680
you counted it all positively,
is actually still infinite.

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:29.120
And we're going to
avoid that case.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:31.820
We're we're just going to treat
these positive cases.

00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.460
So don't worry about
that for now.

00:15:33.460 --> 00:15:36.080
That's the next layer of
complexity which we're not

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.450
addressing in this class.

00:15:38.450 --> 00:15:39.140
Another question.

00:15:39.140 --> 00:15:45.610
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.260
PROFESSOR: The question is,
would this be OK on tests.

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.870
The answer is, absolutely yes.

00:15:49.870 --> 00:15:51.550
I want to encourage
you to do this.

00:15:51.550 --> 00:15:53.660
If you can think about
it correctly.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.260
The subtle point is
just, you have to

00:15:55.260 --> 00:15:57.270
plug in infinity correctly.

00:15:57.270 --> 00:15:59.830
Namely, you have to realize
that this only

00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:01.190
works if k is positive.

00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:03.240
This is the step where you're
plugging in infinity.

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.940
And I'm letting you put this
infinity up here as an

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.390
endpoint value.

00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:12.470
So in fact that's exactly
the theme.

00:16:12.470 --> 00:16:16.810
The theme is dealing
with infinity here.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.550
And I want you to be able
to deal with it.

00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.440
That's my goal.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:32.660
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.180
PROFESSOR: OK, so another
question is, so let's be sure

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:40.640
here when the limit exists,
I say it has to be finite.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:46.910
That means it's finite,
not infinite.

00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:48.270
The limit can be 0.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.790
It can also be - 1.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:51.880
It can be anything.

00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:58.590
Doesn't have to be a
positive number.

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:04.840
Other questions.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.180
So we've had our
first example.

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:23.650
And now I just want to add one
physical interpretation here.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:29.430
This is Example 1,
if you like.

00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:32.930
And this is something that was
on your problem set, remember.

00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:36.800
That we talked about the
probability, or the number, if

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:47.370
you like, the number of
particles on average that

00:17:47.370 --> 00:18:02.540
decay in some radioactive
substance.

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:12.840
Say, in time between 0 and some
capital T. And then that

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:21.010
would be this integral, 0 to
capital T, some total quantity

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:22.560
times this integral here.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.640
This is the typical kind
of radioactive decay

00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:29.800
number that one gets.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:38.620
Now, in the limit, so this is
some number of particles.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:41.170
If the substance is radioactive,
then in the

00:18:41.170 --> 00:18:47.610
limit, we have this.

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:56.070
Which is equal to the total
number of particles.

00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:58.790
And that's something that's
going to be important for

00:18:58.790 --> 00:19:00.510
normalizing and understanding.

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:03.000
How much does the whole
substance, how many moles do

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.840
we have of this stuff.

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:05.960
What is it.

00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:08.390
And so this is a number that
is going to come up.

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:14.040
Now, I emphasize that this
notion of T going to infinity

00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.890
is just an idealization.

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:20.800
We don't really believe that
we're going to wait forever

00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:23.580
for this substance to decay.

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:27.980
Nevertheless, as theorists, we
write down this quantity.

00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.110
And we use it.

00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:31.970
All the time.

00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:34.840
Furthermore, there's other good
reasons for using it, and

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.930
why physicists accept
it immediately.

00:19:36.930 --> 00:19:39.230
Even though it's not really
completely physically

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.760
realistic ever to let
time go very, very

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.890
far into the future.

00:19:43.890 --> 00:19:47.980
And the reason is, if you notice
this answer here, look

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:53.860
at how much simpler this number
is, 1 / k, than the

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.940
numbers that I got in the
intermediate stages here.

00:19:57.940 --> 00:20:01.800
These are all ugly, the
limits are simple.

00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.130
And this is a theme that
I've been trying to

00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:05.790
emphasize all semester.

00:20:05.790 --> 00:20:07.990
Namely, that the infinitesimal,
the things that

00:20:07.990 --> 00:20:09.780
you get when you do
differentiation, are the

00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:10.580
easier formulas.

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:14.030
The algebraic ones, the things
in the process of getting to

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.500
the limit, are the ugly ones.

00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.650
These are the easy ones, these
are the hard ones.

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:21.260
So in fact, infinity is
basically easier than any

00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.040
finite number.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:27.110
And a lot of appealing formulas
come from those kinds

00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:28.470
of calculations.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.840
Another question.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:39.310
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:43.040
PROFESSOR: The question is,
shouldn't the answer be a?

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.070
Well, the answer turns
out to be a / k.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:49.930
Which means that when you set
up your arithmetic, and you

00:20:49.930 --> 00:20:53.750
model this to a collection
of particles.

00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:55.550
So you said it should be a.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.290
But that's because you
made an assumption.

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:01.190
Which was that a was the total
number of particles.

00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:03.200
But that's just false, right?

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:04.810
This is the total number
of particles.

00:21:04.810 --> 00:21:07.410
So therefore, if you want to set
it up, you want set up so

00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:11.500
that this number's the total
number of particles.

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.560
And that's how you set up a
model is, you do all the

00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:16.040
calculations and you see what
it's coming out to be.

00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:24.490
And that's why you need to do
this kind of calculation.

00:21:24.490 --> 00:21:25.540
OK, so.

00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:27.260
The main thing is, you shouldn't
make assumptions

00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:27.710
about models.

00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:29.950
You have to follow what the
calculations tell you.

00:21:29.950 --> 00:21:32.110
They're not lying.

00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:34.990
OK, so now.

00:21:34.990 --> 00:21:36.300
We carried this out.

00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:42.210
There's one other example which
we talked about earlier

00:21:42.210 --> 00:21:42.830
in the class.

00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:44.470
And I just wanted to
mention it again.

00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:48.800
It's probably the most famous
after this one.

00:21:48.800 --> 00:21:51.510
Namely, the integral from minus
infinity to infinity of

00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:53.740
e^ - x ^2 dx.

00:21:53.740 --> 00:21:56.930
Which turns out, amazingly, to
be able to be evaluated.

00:21:56.930 --> 00:21:59.500
It turns out to be the
square root of pi.

00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:04.340
So this one is also great.

00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:09.840
This is the constant which
allows you to compute all

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.230
kinds of things in
probability.

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:22.760
So this is a key number
in probability.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:25.940
It basically is the key to
understanding things like

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:29.230
standard deviation and basically
any other thing in

00:22:29.230 --> 00:22:31.010
the subject of probability.

00:22:31.010 --> 00:22:37.790
It's also what's driving these
polls that tell you within 4%

00:22:37.790 --> 00:22:40.570
accuracy we know that
people are going to

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:42.430
vote this way or that.

00:22:42.430 --> 00:22:44.990
So in order to interpret all of
those kinds of things, you

00:22:44.990 --> 00:22:48.360
need to know this number.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:53.060
And this number was only
calculated numerically

00:22:53.060 --> 00:22:59.570
starting in the 1700s or so by
people who, actually, by one

00:22:59.570 --> 00:23:03.700
guy whose name was de Moivre,
who was selling his services

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:06.390
to various royalty who were
running lotteries.

00:23:06.390 --> 00:23:09.190
In those days they ran
lotteries, too.

00:23:09.190 --> 00:23:13.750
And he was able to tell them
what the chances were of the

00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:15.590
various games.

00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:17.720
And he worked out this number.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:19.780
He realized that this
was the pattern.

00:23:19.780 --> 00:23:21.730
Although he didn't know that it
was the square root of pi,

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.510
he knew it to sufficient
accuracy that he could tell

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:27.660
them the correct answer to how
much money their lotteries

00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.770
would make.

00:23:29.770 --> 00:23:33.070
And of course we do this
nowadays, too.

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.530
In all kinds of ways.

00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:45.440
Including slightly more legit
businesses like insurance.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:49.920
So now, I I'm going to give
you some more examples.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:56.130
And and the other examples are
much more close to the edge

00:23:56.130 --> 00:23:59.320
between infinite and finite.

00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:02.500
This distinction between
convergence and divergence.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:07.260
And let me just, maybe I'll say
one more word about why we

00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:10.810
care about this very gross issue
of whether something is

00:24:10.810 --> 00:24:12.630
finite or infinite.

00:24:12.630 --> 00:24:15.640
When you're talking about
something like this normal

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:24.290
curve here, there's an issue of
how far out you have to go

00:24:24.290 --> 00:24:29.280
before you can ignore
the rest.

00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:34.500
So we're going to ignore what's
called the tail here.

00:24:34.500 --> 00:24:36.440
Somehow you want to know that
this is negligible.

00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.790
And you want to know how
negligible it is.

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:42.580
And this is the job of a
mathematician, is to know what

00:24:42.580 --> 00:24:45.050
finite region you have to
consider and which one you're

00:24:45.050 --> 00:24:47.130
going to carefully calculate
numerically.

00:24:47.130 --> 00:24:49.030
And then the rest, you're going
to have to take care of

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.690
by some theoretical reasoning.

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:52.830
You're going to have to know
that these tails are small

00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:57.150
enough that they don't matter
in your finite calculation.

00:24:57.150 --> 00:24:59.070
And so, we care very much
about the tails.

00:24:59.070 --> 00:25:00.140
Because they're the only
thing that the

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.700
machine won't tell us.

00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:05.090
So that's the part that
we have to know.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.280
And these tails are also
something which are discussed

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.870
all the time in financial
mathematics.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.830
They're very worried
about fat tails.

00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:16.270
That is, unlikely events that
nevertheless happen sometimes.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:18.570
And they get burned fairly
regularly with them.

00:25:18.570 --> 00:25:25.440
As they have recently, with
the mortgage scandal.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.480
So, these things are pretty
serious and they really are

00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.540
spending a lot of
time on them.

00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.310
Of course, there are lots of
other practical issues besides

00:25:33.310 --> 00:25:34.130
just the mathematics.

00:25:34.130 --> 00:25:37.340
But you've got to get
the math right, too.

00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:40.860
So we're going to now talk about
some borderline cases

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.950
for these fat tails.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:45.820
Just how fat do they have to be
before they become infinite

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:51.820
and overwhelm the
central bump.

00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:56.120
So we'll save this for
just a second.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:59.310
And what I'm saving up here is
the borderline case, which I'm

00:25:59.310 --> 00:26:02.960
going to concentrate on, which
is this moderate rate, which

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.500
is x to powers.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:09.570
Here's our next example.

00:26:09.570 --> 00:26:13.230
I guess we'll call
this Example 3.

00:26:13.230 --> 00:26:17.540
It's the integral from
1 to infinity dx / x.

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:20.800
That's the power p = 1.

00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:23.980
And this turns out to be
a borderline case.

00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:26.790
So it's worth carrying
out carefully.

00:26:26.790 --> 00:26:29.820
Now, again I'm going to do
it by the slower method.

00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:31.290
Rather than the shorthand
method.

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.030
But ultimately, you can
do it by the short

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.100
method if you'd like.

00:26:36.100 --> 00:26:39.770
I break it up into an integral
that goes up to some

00:26:39.770 --> 00:26:42.580
large number, n.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.940
I see that its logarithm
function is the

00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:47.060
antiderivative.

00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:51.740
And so what I get is ln n
- ln 1, which is just 0.

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:53.180
So this is just log n.

00:26:53.180 --> 00:26:55.450
In any case, it tends
to infinity

00:26:55.450 --> 00:26:57.860
as n goes to infinity.

00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.660
So the conclusion is, since the
limit is infinite, that

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:12.020
this thing diverges.

00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:17.230
Now, I'm going to do this
systematically now with all

00:27:17.230 --> 00:27:20.830
powers p, to see what happens.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.050
I'll look at the integral.

00:27:22.050 --> 00:27:23.900
Sorry, I'm going to have
to start at 1 here.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:28.290
From 1 to infinity, dx
/ x ^p, and see what

00:27:28.290 --> 00:27:29.480
happens with these.

00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:32.570
And you'll see that p = 1 is
a borderline when I do this

00:27:32.570 --> 00:27:35.720
calculation.

00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:39.060
This time I'm going to do the
calculation the hard way.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.470
But now you're going to have to
think and pay attention to

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:43.710
see what it is that I'm doing.

00:27:43.710 --> 00:27:45.350
First of all, I'm going to
take the antiderivative.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:53.590
And this is x ^ - p, so it's
- p + 1 / - p + 1.

00:27:53.590 --> 00:28:00.960
That's the antiderivative of
the function 1 / x ^ - p.

00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:07.710
And then I have to evaluate
that at 1 and infinity.

00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:10.600
So now, I'll write this down.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.990
But I'm going to be particularly
careful here.

00:28:13.990 --> 00:28:14.880
I'll write it down.

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:27.040
It's infinity to the -
p + 1 / - p + 1 -,

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:29.160
so I plug in 1 here.

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:34.870
So I get 1 / - p + 1.

00:28:34.870 --> 00:28:36.440
So this is what I'm getting.

00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.480
Again, what you should be
thinking here is this is a

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:45.410
very large number
to this power.

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:47.770
Now, there are two cases.

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:48.880
There are two cases.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:52.530
And they exactly
split at p = 1.

00:28:52.530 --> 00:28:55.280
When p = 1, this number is 0.

00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.660
This exponent is 0, and in fact
this expression doesn't

00:28:57.660 --> 00:29:01.310
make any sense because the
denominator is also 0.

00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:03.610
But for all of the
other values, the

00:29:03.610 --> 00:29:05.310
denominator makes sense.

00:29:05.310 --> 00:29:10.480
But what's going on is that
this is infinite when this

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:13.420
exponent is infinity to
a positive power.

00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:20.070
And it's 0 when it's infinity
to a negative power.

00:29:20.070 --> 00:29:22.210
So I'm going to say it
here, and you must

00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:22.970
check this at home.

00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:25.240
Because this is exactly what
I'm going to ask you

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.060
about on the exam.

00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:28.590
This is it.

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:33.360
This type of thing, maybe with
a specific value of p here.

00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:45.660
When p &lt; 1, this thing
is infinite.

00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:53.560
On the other hand, when p
&gt; 1, this thing is 0.

00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:59.260
So when p &gt; 1, this
thing is 0.

00:29:59.260 --> 00:30:01.040
It's just equal to 0.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:09.380
And so the answer
is 1 / p - 1.

00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:10.250
Because that's this number.

00:30:10.250 --> 00:30:15.720
Minus the quantity
1 / - p + 1.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:17.480
This is a finite number here.

00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:19.910
Notice that the answer would
be weird if this thing went

00:30:19.910 --> 00:30:22.840
away in the p &lt; 1 case.

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.740
Then it would be a
negative number.

00:30:24.740 --> 00:30:28.520
It would be a very strange
answer to this question.

00:30:28.520 --> 00:30:29.920
So, in fact that's
not what happens.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.490
What happens is that the answer
doesn't make sense.

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:33.060
It's infinite.

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:35.620
So let me just write this
down again, under here.

00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:42.160
This is a test in a
particular case.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:47.190
And here's the conclusion.

00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:48.060
Ah.

00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:48.610
No, I'm sorry.

00:30:48.610 --> 00:31:03.760
I think I was going to write
it over on this board here.

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:11.770
So the conclusion is that the
integral from 1 to infinity dx

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:21.000
/ x^p diverges if p &lt;= 1.

00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:33.130
And converges if p &gt; 1.

00:31:33.130 --> 00:31:35.550
And in fact, we can actually
evaluate it.

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.380
It's equal to 1 / p - 1.

00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:44.050
It's got a nice, clean
formula even.

00:31:44.050 --> 00:31:45.820
Alright, now let
me remind you.

00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:47.870
So I didn't spell the word
diverges right, did I?

00:31:47.870 --> 00:31:49.170
Oh no, that's an r.

00:31:49.170 --> 00:31:55.530
I guess that's right.

00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.040
Diverges if p &lt;= 1.

00:31:57.040 --> 00:32:00.310
So really, I needed both of
these arguments, which are

00:32:00.310 --> 00:32:02.310
sitting above it in
order to do it.

00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:06.510
Because the second argument
didn't work at all when p = 1

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:09.650
because the formula for the
antiderivative is wrong.

00:32:09.650 --> 00:32:11.580
The formula for the
antiderivative is given by the

00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:13.570
ln function when p = 1.

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:15.780
So I had to do this
calculation too.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:21.420
This is the borderline case,
between p &gt; 1 and p &lt; 1.

00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:23.820
When p &gt; 1, we got
convergence.

00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:27.140
We could calculate
the integral.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:30.290
When p &lt; 1, when we got
divergence and we calculated

00:32:30.290 --> 00:32:31.510
the integral over there.

00:32:31.510 --> 00:32:34.430
And here in the borderline case,
we got a logarithm. and

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:35.940
we also got divergence.

00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.520
So it failed at the edge.

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:46.980
Now, this takes care
of all the powers.

00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:55.120
Now, there are a number of
different things that one can

00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:58.320
deduce from this.

00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.390
And let me carry them out.

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.465
So this is more or less
the second thing that

00:33:04.465 --> 00:33:07.030
you'll want to do.

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:12.440
And I'm going to emphasize
maybe one aspect of it.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:14.510
I guess we'll get rid of this.

00:33:14.510 --> 00:33:17.500
But it's still the issue that
we're discussing here.

00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:20.230
Is whether this area
is fat or thin.

00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:24.500
I'll remind you of that.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:29.240
So here's the next idea.

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:34.250
Something called limit
comparison.

00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:37.360
Limit comparison is what you're
going to use when,

00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:41.210
instead of being able actually
to calculate the number, you

00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:42.670
don't yet know what
the number is.

00:33:42.670 --> 00:33:45.920
But you can make a comparison to
something whose convergence

00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:48.940
properties you already
understand.

00:33:48.940 --> 00:33:50.780
Now, here's the statement.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:57.090
If a function, f, is similar to
a function, asymptotically

00:33:57.090 --> 00:34:00.940
the same as a function, g, as
x goes to infinity, I'll

00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:03.830
remind you what that
means in a second.

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:10.130
Then the integral starting at
some point out to infinity of

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:20.900
f(x) dx, and the other
one, converge and

00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.230
diverge at the same time.

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:29.740
So both, either, either
-- sorry, let's try

00:34:29.740 --> 00:34:30.320
it the other way.

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.940
Either, both.

00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:42.700
Either both converge,
or both diverge.

00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.840
They behave exactly
the same way.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:50.800
In terms of whether they're
infinite or not.

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:56.650
And, let me remind you what
this tilde means.

00:34:56.650 --> 00:35:14.750
This thing means that f(
x) / g ( x) tends to 1.

00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:20.270
So if you have a couple of
functions like that, then

00:35:20.270 --> 00:35:21.990
their behavior is the same.

00:35:21.990 --> 00:35:25.050
This is more or less obvious.

00:35:25.050 --> 00:35:30.120
It's just because far enough
out, this is for

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:35.020
large a, if you like.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.670
We're not paying any attention
to what happens.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:40.560
It just has to do with the tail,
and after a while f ( x)

00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:42.290
and g(x) are comparable
to each other.

00:35:42.290 --> 00:35:46.980
So their integrals are
comparable to each other.

00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:51.290
So let's just do a couple
of examples here.

00:35:51.290 --> 00:35:56.500
If you take the integral from 0
to infinity dx / the square

00:35:56.500 --> 00:36:07.140
root of x ^2 + 10, then I claim
that the square root of

00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:16.220
x^2 + 10 resembles the square
root of x ^2, which is just x.

00:36:16.220 --> 00:36:19.090
So this thing is going
to be like.

00:36:19.090 --> 00:36:22.570
So now I'm going to have to
do one thing to you here.

00:36:22.570 --> 00:36:26.180
Which is, I'm going to
change this to 1.

00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:35.210
To infinity. dx /x And the
reason is that this x = 0 is

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:35.870
extraneous.

00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:37.680
Doesn't have anything to
do with what's going

00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:39.710
on with this problem.

00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:48.440
This guy here, the piece of it
from, so we're going to ignore

00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:57.060
the part integral from 0 to 1 dx
/ square root of x ^2 + 10,

00:36:57.060 --> 00:37:01.480
which is finite anyway.

00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:03.340
And unimportant.

00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:06.640
Whereas, unfortunately, the
integral of dx will have a

00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:08.310
singularity at x = 0.

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:12.040
So we can't make the
comparison there.

00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:14.910
Anyway, this one is infinite.

00:37:14.910 --> 00:37:21.490
So this is divergence.

00:37:21.490 --> 00:37:27.600
Using what I knew from before.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:27.840
Yeah.

00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:33.680
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:39.770
PROFESSOR: The question is, why
did we switch from 0 to 1?

00:37:39.770 --> 00:37:43.280
So I'm going to say a little
bit more about that later.

00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:48.750
But let me just make
it a warning here.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:58.010
Which is that this guy here is
infinite for other reasons.

00:37:58.010 --> 00:38:04.310
Unrelated reasons.

00:38:04.310 --> 00:38:06.830
The comparison that we are
trying to make is with the

00:38:06.830 --> 00:38:09.400
tail as x goes to infinity.

00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.820
So another way of saying this
is that I should stick an a

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:16.940
here and an a here and
stay away from 0.

00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:18.770
So, say a = 1.

00:38:18.770 --> 00:38:21.820
If I make these both 1,
that would be OK.

00:38:21.820 --> 00:38:24.700
If I make them both 2,
that would be OK.

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:27.250
If I make them both 100,
that would be OK.

00:38:27.250 --> 00:38:29.450
So let's leave it as
100 right now.

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:30.640
And it's acceptable.

00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:33.360
I want you to stay away
from the origin here.

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.820
Because that's another
bad point.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:40.380
And just talk about what's
happening with the tail.

00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:44.860
So this is a tail, and I
also had a different

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.580
name for it up top.

00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.810
Which is emphasizing this.

00:38:47.810 --> 00:38:49.770
Which is limit comparison.

00:38:49.770 --> 00:38:52.740
It's only what's happening at
the very end of the picture

00:38:52.740 --> 00:38:53.920
that we're interested in.

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:56.710
So again, this is as
x goes to infinity.

00:38:56.710 --> 00:38:59.880
That's the limit we're talking
about, the limiting behavior.

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.430
And we're trying not to pay
attention to what's happening

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:10.890
for small values of x.

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:14.090
So to be consistent, if I'm
going to do it up to 100 I'm

00:39:14.090 --> 00:39:25.240
ignoring what's happening up
to the first 100 values.

00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:28.950
In any case, this
guy diverged.

00:39:28.950 --> 00:39:33.120
And let me give you
another example.

00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:36.050
This one, you could
have computed.

00:39:36.050 --> 00:39:38.040
This one you could have
computed, right?

00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:44.590
Because it's a square root of
quadratic, so there's a trig

00:39:44.590 --> 00:39:48.420
substitution that evaluates
this one.

00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:52.330
The advantage of this limit
comparison method is, it makes

00:39:52.330 --> 00:39:54.640
no difference whether you can
compute the thing or not.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.440
You can still decide whether
it's finite or infinite,

00:39:57.440 --> 00:39:58.820
fairly easily.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:10.850
So let me give you an
example of that.

00:40:10.850 --> 00:40:13.030
So here we have another
example.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:21.560
We'll take the integral dx
/ square root of x^3 + 3.

00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:25.080
Let's say, for the
sake of argument.

00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.970
From 0 to infinity.

00:40:28.970 --> 00:40:35.200
Let's leave off, let's make it
10 to infinity, whatever.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:42.360
Now this one is problematic
for you.

00:40:42.360 --> 00:40:44.910
You're not going to be able
to evaluate it, I promise.

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:53.660
So on the other hand 1 / the
square root of x^3 + 3 is

00:40:53.660 --> 00:41:00.580
similar to 1 / the square root
of x ^3, which is 1 / x ^ 3/2.

00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:10.680
So this thing is going to
resemble this integral here.

00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:16.870
Which is convergent.

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:25.660
According to our rule.

00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:31.950
So those are the, more or less
the main ingredients.

00:41:31.950 --> 00:41:36.280
Let me just mention one other
integral, which was the one

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:37.900
that we had over here.

00:41:37.900 --> 00:41:39.830
This one here.

00:41:39.830 --> 00:41:43.130
If you look at this integral, of
course we can compute it so

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:45.270
we know the area is finite.

00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:52.000
But the way that you would
actually carry this out, if

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.680
you didn't know the number and
you wanted to check that this

00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.200
integral were finite, then you
would make the following

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:00.880
comparison.

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.710
This one is not so difficult.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:06.220
First of all, you would write it
as twice the integral from

00:42:06.220 --> 00:42:11.770
0 to infinity of e^ - x ^2 dx.

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:15.800
This is a new example here, and
we're just checking for

00:42:15.800 --> 00:42:18.970
convergence only.

00:42:18.970 --> 00:42:25.700
Not evaluation.

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:37.120
And now, I'm going to make a
comparison here, Rather than a

00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:39.380
limit, comparison I'm actually
just going to make an ordinary

00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:39.810
comparison.

00:42:39.810 --> 00:42:42.530
That's because this thing
vanishes so fast. It's so

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:45.330
favorable that we can only put
something on top of it, we

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:47.090
can't get something underneath
it that exactly

00:42:47.090 --> 00:42:48.280
balances with it.

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.700
In other words, this wiggle was
something which had the

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.050
same growth rate as the
function involved.

00:42:53.050 --> 00:42:55.830
This thing just vanishes
incredibly fast. It's great.

00:42:55.830 --> 00:42:58.500
It's too good for us,
for this comparison.

00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.970
So instead what I'm going
to make is the following

00:43:00.970 --> 00:43:07.650
comparison. e ^ - x
^2 &lt; = e ^ - x.

00:43:07.650 --> 00:43:10.990
At least for x &gt;= 1.

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:20.150
When x &gt; = 1, then x ^2 &gt;=
x, and so - x ^2 &lt; - x.

00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:22.830
And so e^ - x^2 is
less than this.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:26.440
So this is the reasoning
involved.

00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:29.350
And so what we have here
is two pieces.

00:43:29.350 --> 00:43:33.460
We have 2, the integral from
0 to 1, of e^ - x ^2.

00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:35.430
That's just a finite part.

00:43:35.430 --> 00:43:38.340
And then we have this other
part, which I'm going to

00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:42.490
replace with the e ^ - x here.

00:43:42.490 --> 00:43:50.310
2 times 1 to infinity
e ^ -x dx.

00:43:50.310 --> 00:43:53.460
So this is, if you like,
this is ordinary

00:43:53.460 --> 00:43:54.480
comparison of integrals.

00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:57.010
It's something that we did way
at the beginning of the class.

00:43:57.010 --> 00:43:59.750
Or much earlier on, when we were
dealing with integrals.

00:43:59.750 --> 00:44:04.940
Which is that if you have a
larger integrand, then the

00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.630
integral gets larger.

00:44:07.630 --> 00:44:08.810
So we've replaced
the integral.

00:44:08.810 --> 00:44:11.360
We've got the same integrand
on 0 to 1.

00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.370
And we have a larger integrand
on, so this

00:44:14.370 --> 00:44:20.680
one is larger integrand.

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.200
And this one we know
is finite.

00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:24.830
This one is a convergent
integral.

00:44:24.830 --> 00:44:29.760
So the whole business
is convergent.

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.970
But of course we replaced it
by a much larger thing.

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:33.600
So we're not getting the right
number out of this.

00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:47.920
We're just showing that
it converges.

00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:51.060
So these are the main
ingredients.

00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:54.380
As I say, once the thing gets
really, really fast decaying,

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:57.310
it's relatively straightforward.

00:44:57.310 --> 00:45:04.790
There's lots of room to show
that it converges.

00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:08.520
Now, there's one last item of
business here which I have to

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.080
promise you.

00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:16.860
Which I promised you, which had
to do with dealing with

00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:22.220
this bottom piece here.

00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:25.300
So I have to deal with what
happens when there's a

00:45:25.300 --> 00:45:26.050
singularity.

00:45:26.050 --> 00:45:56.800
This is known as an improper
integral of the second type.

00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:01.200
And the idea of these examples
is the following.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:06.010
You might have something
like this.

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:11.200
Something like this.

00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:16.770
Or something like this.

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:20.690
These are typical sorts
of examples.

00:46:20.690 --> 00:46:27.510
And before actually describing
what happens, I

00:46:27.510 --> 00:46:28.540
just want to mention.

00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:32.130
So first of all, the key point
here is you can just calculate

00:46:32.130 --> 00:46:32.760
these things.

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:37.940
And plug in 0 and it works and
you'll get the right answer.

00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:41.050
So you'll determine, you'll
figure out, that it turns out

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:43.190
that this one will converge,
this one will diverge, and

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:44.120
this one will diverge.

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:46.340
That's what will turn
out to happen.

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:50.610
However, I want to warn you that
you can fool yourself.

00:46:50.610 --> 00:46:53.150
And so let me give you a
slightly different example.

00:46:53.150 --> 00:46:58.410
Let's consider this
integral here.

00:46:58.410 --> 00:47:05.850
The integral from -
1 to 1 dx / x ^2.

00:47:05.850 --> 00:47:09.690
If you carry out this integral
without thinking, what will

00:47:09.690 --> 00:47:12.870
happen is, you'll get the
antiderivative, which is - x ^

00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:16.250
-1, evaluated at - 1 and 1.

00:47:16.250 --> 00:47:20.550
And you plug it in.

00:47:20.550 --> 00:47:21.520
And what do you get?

00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:30.880
You get - 1 (1 ^ - 1) -,
uh-oh. (- ( -1) ^ - 1).

00:47:30.880 --> 00:47:33.610
There's a lot of - 1's
in this problem.

00:47:33.610 --> 00:47:35.090
OK, so that's - 1.

00:47:35.090 --> 00:47:37.780
And this one, if you work it all
out, as I sometimes don't

00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:41.160
get the signs right, but this
time I really paid attention.

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:44.480
It's - 1, I'm telling you
that's what it is.

00:47:44.480 --> 00:47:46.880
So that comes out to be - 2.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:50.450
Now, this is ridiculous.

00:47:50.450 --> 00:48:01.400
This function here
looks like this.

00:48:01.400 --> 00:48:03.640
It's positive, right?

00:48:03.640 --> 00:48:06.000
1 / x ^2 is positive.

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:10.290
How exactly is it that the area
between - 1 and 1 came

00:48:10.290 --> 00:48:13.990
out to be a negative number?

00:48:13.990 --> 00:48:16.510
That can't be.

00:48:16.510 --> 00:48:18.420
There was clearly something
wrong with this.

00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.440
And this is the kind of thing
that you'll get regularly if

00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:25.740
you don't pay attention to
convergence of integrals.

00:48:25.740 --> 00:48:29.360
So what's going on here is
actually that this area in

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:33.130
here is infinite.

00:48:33.130 --> 00:48:38.090
And this calculation that
I made is nonsense.

00:48:38.090 --> 00:48:41.060
So it doesn't work.

00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:42.010
This is wrong.

00:48:42.010 --> 00:48:50.240
Because it's divergent.

00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:52.490
Actually, when you get to
imaginary numbers, it'll turn

00:48:52.490 --> 00:48:56.710
out that there's a way
of rescuing it.

00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:59.450
But, still, it means something
totally different when that

00:48:59.450 --> 00:49:03.160
integral is thought
to be at - 2.

00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:04.000
So.

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:08.865
What I want you to do here, so
I think we'll have to finish

00:49:08.865 --> 00:49:11.590
this up very briefly
next time.

00:49:11.590 --> 00:49:14.340
We'll do these three
calculations and you'll see

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:19.910
that these two guys
are divergent

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:21.990
and this one converges.

00:49:21.990 --> 00:49:24.110
And we'll do that next time.
