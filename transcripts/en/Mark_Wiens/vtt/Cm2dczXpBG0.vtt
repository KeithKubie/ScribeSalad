00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.190
good morning, David morning, and we are

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.010
On our way to go find chef hero Sato who is a master Xu sushi chef

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.879
And he's going to be taking us into the market every sushi chef in Tokyo

to get fresh fish for the day

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.209
We met up with Chef Hiro Sato and we're now just walking into the inner market of sketchy market this is

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.349
This is where you want to be careful not to get hit by by carts or our trolleys

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.129
Oh, man, this is this is awesome. I'm starting to get really really excited

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.810
At this time you can see all of the vendors, they're setting up, there is a fresh catch of the day as in and

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.619
Every sushi chef in Tokyo has their own

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.470
vendor that they go back to over and over again, and so chef knows exactly where we're going oh

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.440
wow

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.709
Before we do anything though proper footwear is a must

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:42.489
Oh

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.930
and a cap

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.950
Okay, oh yeah, I'm fully totally ready for the fish market so nice outfit. Yeah

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.420
This is seriously a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Not only are we at an?

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.590
exclusive area

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.799
for buyers only at Tsukiji market

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.239
That is in the fest and the boots

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:17.810
And by the way Iggy fish market is the this is the biggest fish seafood market in the entire world, it's gigantic

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.669
All of a sudden we're entering into the Arctic chill room. Oh, this is the tuna room?

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:30.920
Oh, this is where the auction is happening

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.750
This is by far the most

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:40.349
Gigantic tuna I have ever seen in my entire life

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:41.530
oh

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:43.530
It's massive

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:52.730
If you ever eat the best sushi the best quality tuna it all passes through this market and this auction

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.999
We got bleacher seats I think that Bell signifies the start of the auction

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:21.629
So amazingly organized, but it just sounds it's actually quite soothing to listen to them

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:56.659
He actually like sings a song it's so methodical iterally

00:04:56.659 --> 00:05:02.838
Just go fish after fish we spending a few seconds bird fish and just go down the line auctioning off all of the tuna

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.020
I

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:14.199
Guess so really quickly just to explain the tuna are auctioned and there are buyers

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.030
So they buy the tuna and then they bring it back to the fish market

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:25.269
Where they cut it and where they distribute it and sell it and then sushi chefs

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.139
They they go they have their own vendor that they

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.430
I'm sure they go to they're loyal to their vendor and

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:42.040
So the best sushi chefs have their own vendor who is one of the best buyers because they buy the best quality of tuna

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.910
And so that's just that's just a really really quick

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.750
brief overview of a little bit of how the system works

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:59.199
Unfortunately, I had to give up the hat and the vest, but we are back at the tuna king

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:11.470
All right, and this is also known as the tuna king women king they buy the best units in the world

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.060
These are the highest quality tuna in the entire world and

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.710
This is the part

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.629
I'm really looking forward to actually is when they're gonna start cutting the tuna and the tuna are straight from the auction

00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:00.270
I'm just overwhelmed right now. It's so fascinating you're watching this he cuts up that to an end there there

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.460
So they know it's the exact move

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.890
They need to make they cut off the fins they cut off the head they cut off various bones

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:15.450
But they know it's so precise they know exactly what they're doing and there's there's no room for error

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.989
And as he's slicing up that tree no we got another another shipment was delivered look at the size of this

00:07:28.289 --> 00:07:30.289
It's huge

00:07:30.989 --> 00:07:32.989
142 kilos

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:23.019
Oh, Oh that is the purest sashimi you will ever have in your life

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:28.990
Right out of the carcass

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.350
Oh

00:08:52.899 --> 00:08:59.759
That was just incredible to watch them slicing up those slabs of tuna they there's no room for error

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.760
They make slices

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:09.209
They can only make it or just one cut and just they literally cut that tuna like it's butter just straight through it

00:09:09.209 --> 00:09:12.779
It's just such an incredible art and those guys are the best in the world

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.609
For anything very didn't going to have

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.770
a person

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:45.740
I don't got the goods endeth

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.659
This is possibly the greatest treat

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:55.589
You could ever have it's slimy and still kind of squirming around and all man. It does not get fresher than this

00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:01.320
One bite

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:09.950
All the fur it's sweet and firm you can taste the salt water college all the sweetness keeps on coming

00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:21.090
We trick

00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:34.220
Chef's just killed me another shrimp, and this is our boat on trip. Oh

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:42.710
That shrimp literally almost has the sticky texture of peanut butter oh, but with like a a

00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.970

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:46.970
Natural almost nutty taste to it

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.760
amazing

00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:57.579

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.910
That tastes like cream

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:37.180
It tastes like it tastes like ice cream. I had this tiny little perfect bitterness to it

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.749
balanced by a sweetness and juiciness

00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:43.990

00:13:02.369 --> 00:13:04.369
What really strikes me about

00:13:04.740 --> 00:13:07.519
Japanese culture in general is just how?

00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:13.639
How they respect and take such incredible care of the natural products than the natural?

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:19.519

00:14:16.679 --> 00:14:18.679
Sushi bar there

When you dream about a sushi bar, this is the exactly like environment atmosphere that you would think of

crunchy head and like suckin buttery slightly bitter

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.040

Your next byte is monkfish liver, and it has it has an orange color to it

00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:33.309
Oh, that's like custard no I forgot on that one to add the wasabi I'm gonna add the whole blob of wasabi on this button

00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:47.760

00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.829
They just have like different purposes. Ah this is a chawanmushi

00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:18.780
It's a type of egg custard

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:23.189
And there's a little dab of wasabi on the top so you can kind of mix that mix that all around

00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:28.200
There's like some it looks all that a custard is on the bottom there, and then there's kind of like some gooey sauce

00:19:33.490 --> 00:19:39.689
Hmm, it's so light and just dissolves it you know they're pieces of fish on the bottom as well

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:57.420
The sushi has begun we are starting with a piece of flounder is such an expert at making sushi

00:19:57.420 --> 00:19:59.430
It's even hard to like keep up with the camera

00:20:01.150 --> 00:20:03.150
Oh

00:20:04.330 --> 00:20:08.099
The balance is just insane and also when you eat sushi

00:20:08.590 --> 00:20:12.059
Just eating it with your fingers grabbing it right from the chef

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:18.239
He makes it eat it right off the table you use your fingers that just adds another element to it the next piece is

00:20:19.180 --> 00:20:21.070
squid and

00:20:21.070 --> 00:20:23.070
he added on a squeeze of

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:27.450
The citrus yuzu, I think and then a little bit of wasabi in there

00:20:32.170 --> 00:20:34.859
I've never had raw squid like that. That's so

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.540

00:20:37.540 --> 00:20:38.740
Mmm

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:42.840
It has a little crunch to it, but it's so soft. It's not chewy whatsoever oh

00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:46.200
That's citrus is amazing oh

00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.770

The fish just melts in your mouth the rice is perfectly balanced, and it's just the perfect temperature like

00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:18.070
It's like mouth temperature the entire bite

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:23.830

00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:08.810

00:22:37.149 --> 00:22:39.149
Buts about gold

Jews it's done a lot buddy so far everything has been exceptional

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:49.860
But this is one light that I've been waiting for it is the oath total the fatty tuna belly and to me it almost looks

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:54.509
Like like scales almost because it's so fatty that it just kind of like almost like

00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:57.029
Starting to fall apart

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.010
For ladies

Let's just bite after bite of just life-changing food next up is Spanish mackerel

00:23:47.130 --> 00:23:52.010
Although it has it like kind of gooey texture to it what I really love the flavor of

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:58.189
The chef at is sushi though, it's more on the salty side with a little bit of sourness

00:23:59.279 --> 00:24:04.129
Without much, sweetness in the rice. It's absolutely perfect detail

00:24:06.270 --> 00:24:08.270
It is in style

00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:19.219
Just beautiful again, you can see there's tiger stripes on it

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:32.170
Boy next up is baby scallop

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.400
The crunch from the two weed

00:24:39.620 --> 00:24:41.620

00:24:42.020 --> 00:24:44.020

00:24:44.780 --> 00:24:52.149
that literally has the crunch of a mushroom - it almost is his salmon roe, and he put a better price down and just a

00:24:52.670 --> 00:25:00.069
Heap of salmon roe. This is like a little bowl of pudding you do with a spoon look that is just incredibly beautiful

00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:06.670
They're transparent and they're actually like like light orange in color if you look at them through the light

00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:20.680
Sometimes it takes fishy and tastes a little hot. This is like so neutral tasting

00:25:21.230 --> 00:25:26.230
They just like burst with like slightly salty or like juice

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.890
