00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.630
Hey, I'm Jad Aboumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich, this is Radiolab, and today, uh,

2
00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.380
today we're falling in many different flavors and we're at number three.

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.030
So next we have the story of a different kind of fall. Alright. Or father. Yeah,

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.620
it comes from science writer, David Coleman.

5
00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.430
One article in particular that he wrote caught our attention. All right,

6
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.610
I'm going to quote you to yourself. Okay. Nowadays, true enough,

7
00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:25.990
we know quite a bit about cats. They'd been dissected in uncountable numbers,

8
00:00:25.991 --> 00:00:29.590
their anatomy, their physiology, their behavior had been my noodly studied,

9
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.600
but there is much that we still don't know among all the other intractable

10
00:00:34.601 --> 00:00:36.340
issues. One in particular arrest me.

11
00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.200
What's the terminal velocity of a plummeting cat?

12
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:46.120
Can you give me a little history? Why did that question arrest you? I mean,

13
00:00:46.121 --> 00:00:48.130
when I used to write for outside magazine,

14
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.700
I would browse through journals and I would come across obscure papers.

15
00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.850
How I happened upon the Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association,

16
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.370
familiarly known as j v. A. M. A,

17
00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.420
I don't know. I don't remember,

18
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.380
but I'm sure that that was the starting point because it was in that journal.

19
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.130
The David ran across a research paper yeah. By two vets.

20
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.250
Wayne Whitney and Cheryl Mel Hoff who worked in um,

21
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.740
the mid town veterinary hospital right there on Sixth Avenue and 72nd.

22
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.060
And they noticed that, um,

23
00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.770
that in Manhattan there were a lot of cats falling out of windows high windows,

24
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.130
falling off ledges falling off roofs. And what, what is it, what is a lot?

25
00:01:33.131 --> 00:01:34.670
I mean, how many cats were coming into this?

26
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:41.180
<v 1>We saw 132 cats fall in a five month summer period during 13.</v>

27
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.650
That's in home and house. She actually works in the, um,

28
00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.070
in the veterinary hospital here at the Animal Medical Center and she's been

29
00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:51.940
there since that research paper was written back in 1986 when I came to New York

30
00:01:51.941 --> 00:01:54.460
City. I said, what do you mean cats fall out of buildings?

31
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.560
It doesn't make sense. I said, why were the cat fall out?

32
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.910
But we'll get back to her. And I'm just a little bit,

33
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.260
<v 0>130, two and five months. That's almost a reign of cats. Well, no,</v>

34
00:02:03.261 --> 00:02:06.300
don't say that because I think people should visit New York without, um,

35
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.800
without fan receiving umbrellas. You too. What are you doing?

36
00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:13.660
I'm doing the math to see how many of that is in a week of, uh,

37
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.380
[inaudible] days. It's about, it's about four cats a day, isn't it yet? Geez,

38
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.211
let me see.

39
00:02:20.211 --> 00:02:23.930
I think it takes a little less bit to falling out of buildings is what is with

40
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.500
this. It's a shame. We can only be about that. But according to David,

41
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.320
it's actually not as much of a shame as you would think.

42
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:34.610
22 of the cats that they saw had fallen from eight stories or higher.

43
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.650
And out of those 22, only one died.

44
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.290
21 Katz survived from eight stories or higher. Wow. That's a long way.

45
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.320
And there was one cat that fell 32 stories and the cat had a little bit of sort

46
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:51.920
of thoracic bruising and a chip tooth. And that was it to the quote. I mean,

47
00:02:51.921 --> 00:02:55.280
how in the world do cats? I mean, we all know cats land on their feet. Yeah,

48
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.980
yeah, yeah. But how do they do that? Like these are not magical creatures. Wow.

49
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:02.270
If you go back about a thousand years, the, you know,

50
00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.580
it was thought that they consorted with witches, with the devil, uh,

51
00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.830
and their reputation got darker and darker.

52
00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.460
The more people started to distrust and dislike cats,

53
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.850
the more they started to do horrible things to them.

54
00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:19.660
They would put cats in a barrel and then they went run the barrel through with

55
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:23.530
sword. Oh, I'm also throwing them out of windows.

56
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.280
The defenestration of cats.

57
00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:27.970
W what is a defenestration means showing up the window.

58
00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.880
Really an extra is that was the word. Oh Jan.

59
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.730
Add that to your active vocabulary today. I glad to. So what,

60
00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.880
what happened when they would defend a straight, these cats,

61
00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.310
the cats would land on their feet and walk away

62
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.120
<v 1>way that made people even crazier.</v>

63
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.690
No, of course we love our cats now. We don't do that to our cats anymore.

64
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.110
But when we went to visit Ann back at the veterinary hospital,

65
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.620
we were asking her about the falling cats research paper,

66
00:03:58.621 --> 00:04:02.430
which is called the feline high rose. The feeling of High Rise Syndrome.

67
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:06.980
Then the mystery of how cats from far from these amazing heightened survive.

68
00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.200
Yeah. You got a lot deeper. Yeah. Well, cats,

69
00:04:10.201 --> 00:04:14.280
it felt less than five stories. They did fine.

70
00:04:14.281 --> 00:04:18.810
She's not too bad. CATSA fell over nine stories. They did find two,

71
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:21.810
she's not so bad, which is weird, but cats,

72
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.930
it fell between five and nine 25 floors and nine floors had really serious

73
00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:32.070
injuries and had more injuries per cat. So cats did fill a little ways for,

74
00:04:32.071 --> 00:04:35.910
okay. Cats fill a long ways where, okay, weirdly,

75
00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.420
but this five to nine thing. Yeah. Yeah. So the,

76
00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.950
so we had to get a physicist to help us explain this.

77
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.180
This is where we get back to what Kleiman calls the terminal velocity issue.

78
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:50.010
Or here's how an put it to us. Well,

79
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:53.310
say you're living on the 30th floor of a building and it's summertime.

80
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.520
You get done at work at five you go home and get there about six the apartment's

81
00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:58.830
hot and stuffy and you open up those windows

82
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.980
and fluffy says, I'd like that pigeon out there.

83
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.600
And the next thing you know the misstep

84
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.753
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

85
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.530
<v 1>as the cat starts to fall, he's all disoriented and almost immediately,</v>

86
00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.040
probably within the first six feet, the cat's brain says, okay,

87
00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:21.840
turn your front half over. Now bring your back legs around.

88
00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.980
Like instant cat can apparently do that move lickety split,

89
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.940
but the cat is still speeding up, going faster and faster. Three floors,

90
00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.410
five floors, seven floors.

91
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:35.360
Then after falling about nine floors and accelerating the speeds up to about 60

92
00:05:35.361 --> 00:05:37.800
miles an hour, something happens to

93
00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.790
<v 0>hit an equilibrium between the pull of gravity and wind resistance.</v>

94
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:45.550
What it means is gravity is pulling down on you.

95
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:49.090
In the peak pole is between five and nine floors for a cat,

96
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:52.210
but after nine floors, the wind resistance,

97
00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.200
which all the while has been pushing back up on you, starts to slow you down.

98
00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:57.980
You don't speed up. So that's your

99
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.750
<v 3>cruising speed. It's your cruising speed. After the cat's hit,</v>

100
00:06:02.751 --> 00:06:07.520
terminal velocity and the sensation of acceleration was gone. They relaxed.

101
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.210
Did they sort of stretch out like a flying squirrel

102
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.310
and then they hit the ground belly flop.

103
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.790
And you're saying that because they hit this screws in speed and then relaxing

104
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.930
to the flying squirrel? The impact is less. Yes. Yeah.

105
00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:28.270
And in our record here, it wasn't in this paper,

106
00:06:28.271 --> 00:06:32.380
but our record is 42 floors and the cat walked away. Wow. 42.

107
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.140
Is that a lucky cat or that just plain physics?

108
00:06:35.141 --> 00:06:38.860
Should cats everywhere go to the 42nd floor before jumping out of the window.

109
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:44.320
[inaudible] dot of a window. That's right. Stay in doors. No fluffy back.

110
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.990
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

111
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.750
<v 3>oh, okay. So the next, uh, falling, what are we gonna call these falling,</v>

112
00:06:57.320 --> 00:07:01.400
falling, falling nodes. Now is there an f word you could use? Features. Yes. Oh,

113
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.200
great. Great. Our next falling feature. Oh boy. Okay. No,

114
00:07:05.201 --> 00:07:07.040
I mean it's okay if you will.

115
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:10.510
You invited Columbia University physics Professor Brian Green into our studios.

116
00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.770
I get to play with any buttons. Uh, yeah,

117
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.800
we wanted to ask him what we know really one of the most basic questions you

118
00:07:15.801 --> 00:07:19.830
could ask a physicist, why do we fall?

119
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:21.241
You know,

120
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:26.241
we all know that Newton wrote down a law of gravity to calculate how gravity axa

121
00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:30.090
from one object to another. Yeah. Like if you dropped your pen, that's right.

122
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.630
But there's a difference between being able to predict what will happen and be

123
00:07:33.631 --> 00:07:38.180
able to explain why it happens. And Newton could not explain why it happens.

124
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.750
He could only tell you what would happen.

125
00:07:39.870 --> 00:07:42.000
But I mean how it works is it just pulls to the pen down.

126
00:07:42.001 --> 00:07:43.710
What does that mean though? Has it pull it.

127
00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:46.230
I don't see anything between the table and your pen.

128
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:51.000
So what is the agent responsible for the pole? Um

129
00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.440
hmm. This is something, even Albert Einstein himself couldn't quite figure out.

130
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:00.670
He was struggling to understand how the force of gravity works and it was a big,

131
00:08:00.671 --> 00:08:01.480
big puzzle.

132
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:05.170
And the legend goes at Albert Einstein was walking around one day and he found

133
00:08:05.171 --> 00:08:10.171
himself imagining a person riding in an elevator and all of a sudden the cable

134
00:08:10.751 --> 00:08:14.410
gets cut and the elevator starts a plunge right down towards the earth

135
00:08:14.411 --> 00:08:14.831
diversion.

136
00:08:14.831 --> 00:08:18.000
I know right that he was actually sitting at his desk looking out the window and

137
00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.690
was imagining window washers falling sorta from their scaffolding,

138
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.650
but it's the same, same exact idea. But anyway,

139
00:08:24.690 --> 00:08:26.960
we were going to stick with the elevator version for now. Einstein,

140
00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:31.670
imagine this person standing actually on a bathroom scale in the elevator,

141
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:34.040
in the elevator. This is before the cable gets cut.

142
00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:37.010
If the person is in the elevator standing on a scale,

143
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:40.590
they see that they weigh 160 pounds and then snip

144
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.090
when the elevator cable is cut,

145
00:08:44.390 --> 00:08:48.290
they look down at the scale and the scale will drop to zero because the scale

146
00:08:48.291 --> 00:08:50.990
will be falling away from their feet at exactly the same, right?

147
00:08:50.991 --> 00:08:54.650
That their feet are falling so their feet won't push on the scale any longer

148
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:58.380
cause this, we'll be moving downward with that. In my mind,

149
00:08:58.381 --> 00:09:01.980
I've imagined like the Hollywood movie where it's falling so fast,

150
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:05.130
everybody kind of drifts up, right? So I Stein said to himself,

151
00:09:05.131 --> 00:09:06.060
hang on a second,

152
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.900
here's an environment where in essence I can turn gravity off.

153
00:09:12.990 --> 00:09:16.470
Another way of saying it that flips it around and may make it more clear.

154
00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:19.980
Just as you can turn gravity off by snapping the cable,

155
00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:24.540
you can actually simulate gravity by pulling on the cable that pulls that

156
00:09:24.541 --> 00:09:26.490
elevator up really, really quickly.

157
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.180
Cause now the scale is running into your feet. If you're standing on that scale,

158
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:33.020
they won't read 160 it might read 250 huh?

159
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:37.200
It seems like gravity and being pulled up really fast.

160
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.740
They're the same thing. They are Jan, look what that look at you.

161
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.470
You just have the insight on your own. That's right. He walked,

162
00:09:43.471 --> 00:09:46.770
he walked us 17 steps and I just made the last baby step. You did it.

163
00:09:46.771 --> 00:09:50.880
You did it man. So whenever you're faced with a gravitational problem,

164
00:09:50.970 --> 00:09:55.710
this allowed you to ignore gravity and translate it into a problem about motion.

165
00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.430
Does that, does that solve the the what is gravity question? It just sorta, no,

166
00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.430
he then had to make one more leap and it's not obvious how we took the final

167
00:10:03.431 --> 00:10:06.220
step, but the final step was to realize that the,

168
00:10:06.221 --> 00:10:10.330
what is gravity is the curvature of space and time.

169
00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:17.200
That's a lead. I don't know what that means. This is a very difficult concept.

170
00:10:17.201 --> 00:10:18.034
Do you understand it?

171
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:22.450
I understand what Einstein w tells you when he explained it. He said,

172
00:10:22.451 --> 00:10:26.580
if you imagine the universe as a vast rubber mat,

173
00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:31.960
a rubber mat held really, really taught, let's just take, oh,

174
00:10:31.961 --> 00:10:36.320
I don't know. Let's take the earth and just plop it on to the mat.

175
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:40.900
So what just happened? Well, it sunk into the rubber. It's stretched the rubber,

176
00:10:40.901 --> 00:10:44.320
didn't it? Yeah. The rubber is kind of curved around underneath it.

177
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:48.880
In Einstein's mind he thought maybe this is how to explain gravity.

178
00:10:48.881 --> 00:10:53.530
This is what gravity is. That curved shape of space,

179
00:10:53.531 --> 00:10:54.364
he said,

180
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:59.560
and the pen falls because it's following a contour in that curved space time

181
00:10:59.561 --> 00:11:02.590
environment. So like if we're living on the curve,

182
00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.780
then we're constantly falling down that down that curve. Yeah. Yeah.

183
00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:08.560
We have no choice.

184
00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:12.160
And the reason why right now I feel the chair pushing up on me is again,

185
00:11:12.161 --> 00:11:15.300
my body also wants to slide down, but the chair's getting in the way.

186
00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:18.660
So we're all sort of on some kind of slope sliding down unless we're,

187
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:21.480
that's right. That's right. I like that. Yeah.

188
00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:25.200
I'm now an adherent to that theory. Again, not knowing anything else.

189
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:30.440
Now for number five, should we call it falling fortunes or, well,

190
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.340
falling fortunes is a good one for this, I think. Yeah,

191
00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:37.770
because someone is seeking fame and fortune and then false.

192
00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.330
The idea of the uh, gravity hero. Uh,

193
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.440
to me one of the things that it goes along with that,

194
00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:49.350
was that a term that was used? Gravity heroes? No, that's my term.

195
00:11:49.351 --> 00:11:52.050
I like it though. It's a really catchy term. Well, thanks. Yeah,

196
00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.070
this is Garrett Soden. He's an author,

197
00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.280
<v 5>author of a defying gravity original title falling.</v>

198
00:11:57.281 --> 00:12:01.090
How our greatest fear became our greatest thrill of history and speaking of

199
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:03.220
history and fears and thrills.

200
00:12:03.221 --> 00:12:06.520
And I would add to that list tragedy he tells the following story.

201
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.850
It really started with a Niagara Falls because up to that point people had done

202
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:13.960
all kinds of things at Niagara Falls,

203
00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:19.570
tobacco Edis the 1850s and at Niagara Falls you've got these two guys doing

204
00:12:19.761 --> 00:12:24.270
tight rope tricks over the falls. Yeah. Um, a fellow named Charles Blondin,

205
00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.520
famous French wire walker and a Canadian guy who called himself great Freeney

206
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:31.520
and they would Duke it out, right. London came out,

207
00:12:31.521 --> 00:12:35.540
strung a rope across Niagara Falls, put a chair down,

208
00:12:35.690 --> 00:12:39.470
bounced on two legs and stood Adi. Well one time he carried a guy over.

209
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.520
He had to keep upping the ante. So Tau for his greatest trick,

210
00:12:44.110 --> 00:12:48.740
he carried a small cast iron stove on his back with some firewood.

211
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:53.480
He got out there and he put the stove down, lit a fire,

212
00:12:53.570 --> 00:12:58.570
had a couple of eggs in a fry pan and made an omelet right over this churning.

213
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.140
Like rapid. Yes. Wow. So the great Freeney came out with a washing machine.

214
00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:09.240
That was his answer. Wanted wash some clothes out there. Yeah.

215
00:13:09.800 --> 00:13:13.130
The thing to know about these guys is it does. This is basically just a show,

216
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:16.160
cause for example, the wire that they walked on,

217
00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:20.270
it was pretty wide about the diameter of a Coffee Cup and really they were just

218
00:13:20.271 --> 00:13:23.120
avoiding the big trick, the most anticipated trick.

219
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.930
The one that everybody was waiting for was somebody going over the falls in the

220
00:13:26.931 --> 00:13:27.764
barrel.

221
00:13:29.070 --> 00:13:34.000
The guy who did that would be the real gravity. Woo.

222
00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:38.590
You were walking [inaudible] Niagara Falls with be great forces of nature.

223
00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:43.890
Every second 600,000 gallons fall over the edge pound rocks below was such a

224
00:13:44.621 --> 00:13:48.670
fury that you can hear it five miles away,

225
00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:53.860
which is why in 1850 when PT Barnum saw the fall,

226
00:13:53.890 --> 00:13:57.730
he said that if someone could figure out a way to go over that, that would,

227
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:02.170
that would be a huge strength that would give them fame and fortune.

228
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:05.620
That's a Joan Marie been poet, she's a poet.

229
00:14:05.890 --> 00:14:10.360
She's written in a whole book for us about the first person to conquer the falls

230
00:14:10.361 --> 00:14:15.130
in a barrel and it's called Queen of the missed queen in the mist. Huh?

231
00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:17.320
Yup. So it wasn't a guy then? No,

232
00:14:17.321 --> 00:14:19.990
I just said it was a guy to set you up so that you would ask me that question

233
00:14:19.991 --> 00:14:23.810
because in fact it was a woman. Wow. Props to her. Thank you for acting.

234
00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:26.120
To phrase, what's her name? Chad. Danny Taylor.

235
00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.630
When we first meet any Taylor,

236
00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:35.020
this was 1901 she was down on her luck because she had been a a,

237
00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.820
she'd done a lot of different things. She'd run a dancing school.

238
00:14:37.821 --> 00:14:40.580
She had been a principal. She had traveled all over the world.

239
00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.150
Her only child had died, her husband right after that,

240
00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.420
and she was broke,

241
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.863
but then it hit her.

242
00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:56.650
<v 7>She was sitting at home sitting your newer apartment in Bay city, Michigan,</v>

243
00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:58.760
and for some odd reasons,

244
00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:03.370
she read an article about the goings on at Niagara Falls and she decided she

245
00:15:03.371 --> 00:15:04.670
would go over Niagara Falls.

246
00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.840
<v 5>Well, why?</v>

247
00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:11.870
I mean do we know she's looking to save herself from the poor house?

248
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:14.940
She was after money and when she read about these guys at Niagara Falls,

249
00:15:14.941 --> 00:15:16.020
she thought this is it.

250
00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:19.920
<v 7>Right? So she called a Cooper to build the barrel. At first.</v>

251
00:15:19.921 --> 00:15:22.740
He refused to build it when he heard what her plan was. But finally

252
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:26.190
<v 5>you did, and not long after Annie was on a train with her barrel</v>

253
00:15:27.870 --> 00:15:31.670
headed to the falls. By the way, a what day are we talking about?

254
00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:32.613
So we have a date,

255
00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:37.780
October 24th in 1901 okay.

256
00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:42.890
Word had spread. This was going to be a spectacle. Everyone was there.

257
00:15:42.891 --> 00:15:45.950
Mobs of people, thousands up and down the river.

258
00:15:45.980 --> 00:15:50.510
Tens of thousands and Annie shows up waving to the crowd wearing a very fancy

259
00:15:50.511 --> 00:15:55.130
Victorian dress and a hat with ostrich feathers. Wow. She's quite the lady.

260
00:15:55.131 --> 00:15:56.920
But then they go on an island

261
00:15:57.260 --> 00:16:01.050
<v 0>where's she changes into some gym clothes and now she gets in the barrel.</v>

262
00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.080
They tow her out to the middle of the river. Then they knock

263
00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:07.470
and cut the rope

264
00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:09.700
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

265
00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.760
<v 0>and off she goes to the brain.</v>

266
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:16.810
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

267
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:17.830
<v 7>the roar of the river.</v>

268
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:22.220
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

269
00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.053
<v 5>enormous</v>

270
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:30.790
and it's wet at my feed and I'm feeling while I'm in there that this is

271
00:16:30.951 --> 00:16:35.390
miserable. The interesting thing is that Joan's poem, she actually becomes,

272
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:37.790
and I careened and spun,

273
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:42.050
she's in the barrel getting hurled down the river tossed and turned my brain

274
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:45.470
toilet, and as she gets closer to the edge, it's about a half mile journey.

275
00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.440
She begins to go

276
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:49.830
<v 8>hallucinate Michael Glimpse through the turbulence.</v>

277
00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:54.450
There was my young husband, his arms, our baby

278
00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:58.420
<v 5>rambling and the wind, and then</v>

279
00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.600
<v 7>this moment of weightlessness,</v>

280
00:17:04.590 --> 00:17:06.830
<v 0>she's going [inaudible]</v>

281
00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:11.990
<v 5>down [inaudible] pools below the great mass of foam and boiling water,</v>

282
00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:15.830
and then she shoots out again

283
00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:20.810
<v 7>through the buoyancy of the barrel, about 15 feet in the air.</v>

284
00:17:20.910 --> 00:17:25.080
<v 5>Wow. The barrel crashes back back down on the water,</v>

285
00:17:25.530 --> 00:17:26.460
and then it floats

286
00:17:28.770 --> 00:17:32.100
over to some rocks and a rescue team paddle out to the barrel right away.

287
00:17:32.580 --> 00:17:35.970
They get the barrel and they have to Assad open the crowd,

288
00:17:35.971 --> 00:17:37.710
no doubt his thinking. That woman is dead.

289
00:17:37.740 --> 00:17:41.280
There is nothing but a dead woman in that barrel. But

290
00:17:43.990 --> 00:17:46.660
<v 0>when they pull her out route, she's alive.</v>

291
00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:50.070
Hi Alive.

292
00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.310
<v 5>She took on this thing that the world was waiting for</v>

293
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:57.870
<v 3>and she did it.</v>

294
00:17:57.871 --> 00:18:02.490
She was the first to ever try and Joan when she was pulled out of that barrel

295
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:06.900
and presumably she's going to take the next step into fame and fortune.

296
00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:10.860
What happened? More or less, nothing.

297
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:17.200
She stepped out of the barrel and she didn't look right.

298
00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:22.180
She didn't look like a hero. [inaudible] at me.

299
00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.440
Well, I've kept something from you coalition. What to think,

300
00:18:26.441 --> 00:18:30.870
I haven't told you is that not only was she wet and soggy and according to the

301
00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:33.430
newspaper accounts hysterical. And who wouldn't be?

302
00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:38.530
She was 63. She was your grandmother.

303
00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:43.210
She was an older lady. Like Joan said, you know, for the hero consuming public.

304
00:18:43.211 --> 00:18:44.980
She just didn't look right

305
00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.650
<v 7>after that exhibition. Um,</v>

306
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:52.710
her manager ran off with the barrel and he took the barrel and he started,

307
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:56.230
uh, going on the circuit with a lovely young woman.

308
00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.460
Did he claimed was Annie Taylor? No. Much better showpiece. Oh, Yay.

309
00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:01.830
<v 3>Well, what happened to Andy though?</v>

310
00:19:01.950 --> 00:19:06.950
She would drag herself to Niagara each spring and summer.

311
00:19:07.330 --> 00:19:10.350
<v 7>We just sit on a street with a barrel. It wasn't the original barrel,</v>

312
00:19:10.351 --> 00:19:12.390
but it was a barrel and do what?

313
00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.190
She probably had photographs of herself that she signed.

314
00:19:16.190 --> 00:19:19.480
<v 3>And did she ever make any money off this? No. No.</v>

315
00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:21.440
She died in a poor house,

316
00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:25.300
<v 7>which is where she didn't want to wind up, but that is where she wound up.</v>

317
00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:27.400
<v 3>And just 10 years later,</v>

318
00:19:27.970 --> 00:19:32.320
somebody repeats Annie's feet a man and he tours the world.

319
00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:37.100
Bastard. Yeah. Bastard. But

320
00:19:38.530 --> 00:19:42.550
<v 5>because the heavens are merciful during this guy's victory lap,</v>

321
00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:45.160
as he's traveling around the world, he's, he slipped.

322
00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:49.990
He slipped on an orange rind in Australia or New Zealand.

323
00:19:50.110 --> 00:19:53.650
Got a compound fracture of his leg. Huh?

324
00:19:54.940 --> 00:19:58.720
She says that leg got gangrene and he died. Yeah,

325
00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.140
there is. There is cosmic justice.
