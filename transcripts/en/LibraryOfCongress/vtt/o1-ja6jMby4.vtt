&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.570
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: Good evening
everybody, thank you so much

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.460
for coming and spending a bit
of your evening with us tonight,

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.400 position:56%
I'm delighted to be here on stage
with these two incredible historians

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.500
and biographers and all
around great people.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.320
I'm Melissa Block, with
National Public Radio and PR,

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.820
Annette Gordon-Reed and Peter
Onuf, as you know the authors

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.880
of the new book Most
Blessed of the Patriarchs.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.800
And we're going to talk about
Thomas Jefferson and other things,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.370
so welcome to all of you and
again thanks for being with us

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.540
on this beautiful night I
should say, you're indoors

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.510
on a gorgeous Washington night.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.480
I want to start with the title
of the book, The Most Blessed

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.230
of the Patriarchs, which you
talk about in the preface

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.610
of the book coming from a letter

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.190
that Thomas Jefferson
writes in 1793.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.720
So he's back from Paris, he's back
home, he's not quite back home

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.520
but he's planning on going
back to Monticello in Virginia.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.460
He's writing a letter to
Angelica Schuyler Church which,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.890 position:56%
for those of us who have been
steeped in the Hamilton sound track,

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.520
can I hear the name without
thinking Angelica, Eliza.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.820
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: And Peggy.

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.220
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: And Peggy -- he's
writing to Angelica Schuyler Church

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.950
in London talking about his
plans to go back to Monticello,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.590
and part of the letter reads as
follows: I have my house to build,

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.720
my fields to form and to
watch for the happiness

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.680
of those who labor for mine.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.510
I have one daughter married
to a man of science, sense,

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:30.660
virtue and competence in whom
indeed I have nothing more to wish.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.490 position:56%
They live with me, if the other
shall be as fortunate in due process

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.680
of time I shall imagine
myself as blessed

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.370
as the most blessed
of the patriarchs.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:42.900 position:56%
So Annette Gordon-Reed why don't you
talk a little bit about what it was

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.630 position:56%
in that seemingly innocuous
paragraph in a letter to Angelica --

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.430
you're taking umbrage at innocuous.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.810
But what was it about that
language that intrigued you

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.460
and made you think that
was root of this book?

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.760
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed:
Well, first I want to say

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.340
that the title was somewhat
controversial, we had to fight

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.210
to have quotes because this is
a Jefferson quote about himself

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.590
and we didn't want people to think

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.580
that we were calling him the
most blessed of the blessed

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.480
of the patriarchs because
I thought you know --

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.780
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Because I'm the
most blessed of the patriarchs.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.250
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Peter
might be able to get away with that

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.780
but of course I could not get away

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.960
with calling Jefferson
the most blessed

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.360
of the blessed of patriarchs.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:26.530
But we thought it was intriguing
because it is so different

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.800
from the idea of being a -- you the
apostle of liberty, a Republican,

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.370
a person who saw himself
as an avatar

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:41.390
of the enlightenment calling
himself something that calls

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.240
to mind an ancient patriarch.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.390
It's biblical, it's ancient times
and he in another letter refers

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.670
to himself as living at Monticello
like an Antediluvian patriarch.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.960
So he's the harbinger of the new

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.090 position:56%
but at the same time he is seeing
himself as this figure, a patriarch.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.510
So we thought we would try
to unpack that as they say --

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.960
historians say because we've
sort of come to a point

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:13.810
where there's a set picture
of Jefferson and a lot

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.460
of what people are doing and
writing about him is writing

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.780
about what they wish he had done or
that they're mad that he didn't do.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.860
And we wanted to try to figure out
what did he think he was doing,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.780
which is sort of an important
thing we think to try to uncover.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:32.080
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: You're
trying really

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.370
to get inside his head
as much as you can.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.510
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: And we want
to draw attention to what seems

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:44.500
to be a paradox because the past as
is well-known is a foreign country

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.560
and our idea is that Jefferson
studies have been distorted

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.630
by the need to make
him speak to us now.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.860
And we're not going to be able
to draw anything from Jefferson

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:00.210
until we can put him in his
place and that was our goal.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.350
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: How do you think
he interpreted that patriarchy

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.990
that he's talking about, what
is he talking about there,

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:08.670
what does that symbolize for him?

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.480
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: He wasn't
embarrassed to use the term

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:13.450
and I think that's something
that we need to explore

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.480
and that was the point of
this, how could he say this

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.880
and what does it signify and
the point of departure for us is

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.740
that the world he created
for himself

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:33.330
at Monticello is foundational to
his career in American History.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.740
His public life is not
disconnected from his private life.

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:39.910
If you want to understand
Jefferson you have

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:42.770
to put those two things together.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:45.040
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: And seeing
himself as a patriarch is sort

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.100
of accepting his position in the
world, this is a person who's born

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.280 position:56%
at the top of the hierarchy in
Virginia, he's you know, he's white,

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.160
he's male, he's the first son.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.800
He's tall, he's intelligent, he's
well-educated and he sees himself

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.930
as having a special role.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.840
It's sort of an interesting thing
to think of somebody who is sort

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.770
of in the middle of nowhere
who decides that he is going

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.800
to be a mover and shaker in
the world, that he is going

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.150
to sort of make his mark.

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.180
And he's actually able to do that
through the force of a personality

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.330
that is very self-assured,
confident,

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:24.920
you might say arrogant in a way.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:29.800
But certainly believing that he
had a special place and patriarch

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.660
to us is -- it's a negative
thing for most people maybe,

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:41.390
it's a problematic concept but it
was not problematic to him at all

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.590
because he's thinking I'm
doing this the right way.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.600
And that's the thing that's
great I think a lot --

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.260
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: And it's
important to keep in mind

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:54.070 position:56%
that Jefferson's whole career is
dedicated to eradicating aristocracy

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.690
and that's a challenge for us
because aristocracy and monarchy,

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.070
patriarchy, these are
all dirty words for us.

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:06.900 position:56%
That's the old regime, Jefferson saw
himself inaugurating a new regime,

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:11.600 position:56%
he didn't reject, however, this
fundamental notion of the centrality

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.480
of the family and the household
to the future of the republic.

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:19.190
And that's what he's celebrating
is the role he's playing

00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:20.550
in his household.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:21.850
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: So
does that notion

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.050
of patriarchy do you think
extend beyond the household,

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:30.240
beyond Monticello, his
family, his enslaved workers

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.210 position:56%
to how he approached the
presidency, to politics [inaudible]?

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:36.750
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: He didn't
think of himself as a patriarch.

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:39.590
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: That
was Washington.

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.890 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Washington--

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:42.830
no he may have thought he was
really the father of the country,

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:45.030
Jefferson may have thought he was
the real father of the country

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.150
but I don't think he -- he did
not see himself as a patriarch

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:54.350
of the people of -- Americans,
I mean the people were supposed

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.180
to be the rulers but I think
his understanding of family

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:03.230
and how people should relate
to one another was central,

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:06.430
it came from his conception
of what family was like at --

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:10.170
what he conceived family was
supposed to be like at Monticello.

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.470
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Well,
do you remember

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:12.940
when the nuclear family
was [inaudible]

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:16.000
that is most Americans
lived in nuclear families,

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000
some of you probably still
do, a few of you at least.

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.080 position:56%
But Jefferson thought it was natural

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.090
and that's a key word
for him is nature.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.540 position:56%
If a family comes together naturally

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:31.740
and he imagines the republic is the
most natural form of government,

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:36.110
it's self-government, it's true
to the nature of human beings.

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.200
Therefore, the United States will
be a kind of model to the world.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:41.900
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: Let's
talk about the structure

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.140
of the book a little bit
because you approach it

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.840 position:56%
in a really interesting way, you're
not -- you're moving chronologically

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.960
but you're not focused on his
political life where the minutia

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:56.540
of his time as president you have
chapters on music and on privacy

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:59.000
and how vital privacy was to him.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.890
Why don't you talk a little bit
about how you came to that approach

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:03.840
and why you approached it that way.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.600
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: We
wanted to do something different,

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.190
we wanted try to show
what we thought,

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:10.850
the things that we
thought were important

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:13.220
to shaping Jefferson's
life and we've done --

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:16.050
you know he was born in Shadwell
and then one thing happened

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:18.250
and then the other thing
happened, another thing happened.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:22.320
The idea was to have things,
things that were important to him,

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.610
things that we think are sort
of key to his personality.

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:28.190
We start out with patriarchy and
sort of unpack that and think

00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:33.280
about how he became a patriarch,
the second section is traveler

00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.660
and it talks about the influence
of France, what happened to him

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:41.010
when he leaves Monticello
and Shadwell

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.310
and goes out into the world.

00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.560 position:56%
And the last one is called
enthusiast, and that's where we talk

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.200 position:56%
about music and visitors and things
that are not, the sort of influences

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:53.980
that shaped him but would
not be in a typical kind

00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:57.110
of biography thought
in that particular way.

00:08:57.110 --> 00:09:00.550
The idea was to sort of get
inside of his head in a fashion

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:03.920
and not just do sort of the
laundry list of details.

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.750
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: And if we
successfully integrate his private

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:11.260
life into his public like then
we can show how the performances

00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:15.830
that he orchestrates in his
house then appeal to him

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:20.900 position:56%
and in a way it's a microcosm of
how he imagines the world should be.

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:26.190
Civil conversation, music in
which everybody knows her part

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:28.040
and they harmonize.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:33.680
There's a political meaning to all
this, I think it's profoundly basic

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.710
to his political philosophy,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:41.680
the idea about Jefferson is
you can never know who he is

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.600
and we think that's
stupid, it's foolish.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.230
He's supposed to be impenetrable,
he's been called a sphinx, well,

00:09:49.230 --> 00:09:53.410
Jefferson himself made a
big deal about his privacy,

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:59.780
you mentioned that Melissa and
that privacy is foundational

00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:03.480
to how he understands
his public life.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:09.430
Take this simple idea, in a
republic citizens are equal,

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:16.420
they have to consent to the laws
that the majority decides on

00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:22.150
and that consent has to be
truly voluntary, it has to come

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:25.340
from the self determination
of the individual,

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:29.930
so how do you protect individuals
from insidious influences.

00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:34.250
How do you take for instance the
common person out of the mob,

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:40.620 position:56%
how do you avoid the usual
problems or pathologies of democracy

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.900
because democracy was a
dirty word in the street?

00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:46.190
Put a bunch of people together
and they're going to get drunk

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:48.760
and if they had a government

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.310
and they controlled the
government what would you do?

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:53.880 position:56%
Well, you would pass an agrarian law

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:56.600
that means you'd redistribute
property.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:00.680
So how do you lift people
up, that's his big challenge

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:03.460
and crucial is the project
of lifting people up,

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:08.350
true republican government is a new
conception of the consenting self.

00:11:08.350 --> 00:11:12.070 position:56%
And Jefferson's project we described
as a self-fashioning project

00:11:12.070 --> 00:11:14.780
to make himself somebody, he wants

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:20.010 position:56%
to exemplify how an enlightened
republican criticize can become well

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:23.060
informed and can become
a part of a new kind

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.720
of public life based
on informed consent.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.290
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: He sees
himself you might say as an avatar,

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:30.900
he sees himself as an
example of all of this.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:34.060
There's sort of an arrogance to
this, the idea that he's sort

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.040
of the national teacher, that he
is sort of an example to people.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:39.930
And that's what Monticello
is supposed to be,

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.200
I mean you go to Monticello
if you've been there,

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.400
you go into the Indian Hall and
the foyer there, there's all kinds

00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:50.520 position:56%
of you know paintings and sculptures
and everything and the idea is

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.680
that these are things that
he's brought back with him

00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:55.840
from France to show to people.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.590
And he's going to show
people how to be --

00:11:59.590 --> 00:12:04.350
to model this civilized behavior
and so it's an interesting idea

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:06.740
to say that I am an example.

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:09.230
You know of something that
I want other people to see

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.250
and this is how you
model yourself in the way

00:12:12.250 --> 00:12:16.180
to be educational to other people.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.640
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: Speaking
of the consenting self

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:20.440
and obviously a whole
category of people who were

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.740
by no means [cross-talk].

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:24.570
But I'm curious I mean
obviously Annette Gordon-Reed

00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:30.450
as you know wrote the seminal
book, The Hemingses of Monticello,

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:35.670 position:56%
they spent a lot of time looking
into the family, the extended family

00:12:35.670 --> 00:12:39.140
of Thomas Jefferson
through Sally Hemings.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.680
Did you come to a different
understanding

00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.180
of how he viewed slavery, so much
has been written, you studied it

00:12:45.180 --> 00:12:49.740
so many times, this fatal
stain as he described it.

00:12:49.740 --> 00:12:55.590 position:56%
You do spend some time talking about
how when he goes to France you say

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.980
in France slavery became fully
domesticated in his mind,

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.590
what is that, what does that mean?

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:03.330
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: What it
means is before he went to France,

00:13:03.330 --> 00:13:07.750
Jefferson had a reputation
as being antislavery.

00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:11.880 position:56%
The first indication of this, he's a
young man in his 20's and he copies

00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:15.310
into his common place
book parts of a poem.

00:13:15.310 --> 00:13:18.800
When William Shenstone that talks
about the evils of the slave trade

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:21.340
and somebody yanked from
his native land to --

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:24.310
you know brought across the
ocean to labor for someone else.

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:32.280
And he as a young legislator
wanted to introduce legislation

00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:38.560
to for emancipation plan, which
nowhere in Virginia, went no place

00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.300
and he wrote about this and
as I said had a reputation

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.340
as being antislavery.

00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:51.390
Well, when he goes to France and he
sees French society in a situation

00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.280
where you go, you leave
your country and you think

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.750
that there are bad things about
your country, you go someplace else

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.640
and you say well at least
we're not like that.

00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:05.210
You can be French you know,
that was his attitude he saw --

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:07.870
he's in France during the
prerevolutionary period

00:14:07.870 --> 00:14:13.240
and people are starving, there's
unrest, bread riots all kinds

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:18.270
of things and he says, you know
we have problems in America

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:21.220 position:56%
but this place has lots of problems.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.780
And they're just on the road
no to being able to solve some

00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:27.030
of those problems because he
was very, very much in favor

00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:28.400
of the French Revolution.

00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:30.920
He was excited by all of that.

00:14:30.920 --> 00:14:33.690
It gave him a sense
that well we have time

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:35.290
to solve our problems as well.

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.900 position:56%
The other thing that happens he's in
France with James and Sally Hemings

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:43.080
who are his wife's half siblings.

00:14:43.080 --> 00:14:47.740
And he begins to treat them there
in a way, he pays them wages

00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:52.360
and he's starts a practice that he
continues when he comes back home,

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:57.330
that is paying whenever he's in a
city and he's mixing enslaved labor

00:14:57.330 --> 00:14:59.180
and free labor, he pays everybody

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.520
because I guess it
causes less of a conflict.

00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:07.080
He's living there with these people
who have an opportunity to be free

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.680
because every person who
petitioned for freedom

00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:11.310
in France, it was granted.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:14.330
So like a pro forma thing
which they could have done,

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:18.970
James and Sally Hemings could
have done but they didn't do

00:15:18.970 --> 00:15:21.380
and while he's there he's
living with these people

00:15:21.380 --> 00:15:24.690
who become the face of
slavery for him in a way.

00:15:24.690 --> 00:15:29.970
Jefferson, and he continues this
when he comes home, he sees himself

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:33.800
as a [inaudible] through his
relationship with the people

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.360 position:56%
who were the closest to him, who are
around him but that's unrealistic.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.360
Because they're not the people down
the mountain, they're not the bulk

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.650
of -- this is his wife's family

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.100
and they have a completely
different relationship

00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.900
to him than the others do.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:52.070
I mean Sally Hemings' brothers
lots of times he didn't know

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:55.370
where they were, I mean they
hired their own time and went out

00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:57.950
and kept the money and you
know he would call them back

00:15:57.950 --> 00:16:01.940 position:56%
when he needed them for something so
that's a very different relationship

00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:06.340
that he had with the vast over
700 people, we think that he owned

00:16:06.340 --> 00:16:07.790
over the course of his life time.

00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:10.550
This is a tiny, tiny group
of people who were pulled

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:16.520
out so he sees himself as a slave
owner through those relationships.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:20.300
And we think France really
heightened that for him

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.040
and because they do come back
with him, they don't stay.

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:29.570
And slavery becomes domesticated,
he's thinking about them as members

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.390
of his household, and how he treats
people in his household but that's

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.180
as I said is very, very
different than the situation.

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:37.480
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: There's a kind

00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:41.810
of reciprocity then it's not
symmetrical, they're not equal

00:16:41.810 --> 00:16:45.450
but like family members and I
use the word natural before,

00:16:45.450 --> 00:16:51.380
he has created what he thinks
is a kind of family that extends

00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:55.020
and I think that it's using the
right word when she says face,

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.900
this is how he sees or
wants to see slavery.

00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:03.080
But the other crucial thing to keep
in mind is that Jefferson's urgency

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:06.570
in doing something
about slavery varies

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:08.500
with the GO political situation.

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.800
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Yes.

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.220
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: To put
it narrowly and neatly

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:16.900 position:56%
in the American revolution, enslaved
people could run the British lines

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:22.100
and join the counter revolution
later on in the revolution

00:17:22.100 --> 00:17:24.300
and what becomes Haiti --

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:28.120
the possibility of
uprising in the hemisphere,

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:34.930
could spread to the continent,
drain the War of 1812.

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:37.750
The British come again and
it's another opportunity

00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:39.720
for enslaved people to
take advantage of this.

00:17:39.720 --> 00:17:44.530
At moments like this Jefferson
says my fellow Republicans,

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:46.340
we've got to do something
about this.

00:17:46.340 --> 00:17:52.550
I know slavery is an unjust
institution we need to act

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.670
and his solution of
course is emancipation,

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.960
we have to free these people,
this is a radical injustice,

00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.750
he never backs off from that.

00:17:59.750 --> 00:18:02.200
And then we have to send
them to another country,

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.700
expatriation is his solution.

00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.000
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: To
Liberia and [inaudible].

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.900
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: To
wherever, he thinks about maybe

00:18:08.900 --> 00:18:10.740
in the Trans Mississippi, but well

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.100
after all we might
need that territory.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:16.280
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: No
not there like California.

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.730
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: He thinks
about Sandemang [phonetic]

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:24.100 position:56%
because there there's a black
republic it's not recognized as such

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:27.040
but well maybe Africa but
that's very expensive.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:29.540
He goes through all
these possibilities

00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:35.500 position:56%
but the important thing is that when
the peace comes the urgency goes.

00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:39.420
When the peace comes then he
sees himself and I think this is

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.620
where this is crucial,
as a master he's a kind

00:18:42.620 --> 00:18:46.060 position:56%
of steward, he has a responsibility.

00:18:46.060 --> 00:18:50.450
Just as the father in the
family has a responsibility

00:18:50.450 --> 00:18:53.810
and he has a responsibility to
look after the happiness of those

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:57.260
who labor for mine to borrow
another phrase from that letter

00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:59.760
that we started off
with in our title.

00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:03.030
And then we have a
kind of domestication

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:09.140
and that's talking about, that
is we're trying to create a sense

00:19:09.140 --> 00:19:15.130
within this household of good
treatment, he's an emulator,

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:18.320
he wants to improve things, he
wants to rationalize things.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:19.940
There are ways in other words

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:24.350
in which he can practice
the enlightenment at home,

00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:29.720
make things better while we
wait for his fellow Virginians

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:33.410
to see the light, to use that
[inaudible] again and then come

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:36.360
to the collective decision
we have to do something

00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:38.070
to end this unjust institution.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:40.640
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Because
he understands, he doesn't believe

00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:44.130
that there's what he would call a
Republican solution to the problem,

00:19:44.130 --> 00:19:47.080
that is to say white people of
Virginia were not going to vote

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:51.180
to do away with slavery,
that's not going to happen.

00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.060
I mean during his lifetime that's
not going the only way [inaudible]

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:57.870
but he knew that that was not
going to happen at the time,

00:19:57.870 --> 00:20:00.040
it was going to end
by the time he gets

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:01.910
to the Missouri crisis he realizes

00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.690
that it could end pretty much the
way it ended and that is with a war

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:09.100
and that is not something that
he would have contemplated.

00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:12.770
I mean yeah, I think Jefferson
and Haiti is fascinating

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:15.320
because when he first hears
about it and he writes a letter

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:18.550
to his daughter, he's like well
you know the Negros have taken

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:20.940
over the island which is going
to happen in the Caribbean

00:20:20.940 --> 00:20:24.120
and that's the -- it was sort
of like oh isn't this the age

00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:28.050
of revolution and we've got the
French and all of a sudden he hears

00:20:28.050 --> 00:20:34.110
that lots of white people are being
killed and then the tone changes.

00:20:34.110 --> 00:20:39.990 position:56%
It's not -- it's one thing for white
people to kill for their freedom

00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:44.070
in France essentially which he
supported the French revolution far

00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:49.780
longer than people think he should
have but for the black republic,

00:20:49.780 --> 00:20:52.060 position:56%
you know at first it's okay but then

00:20:52.060 --> 00:20:55.670
when they start killing
then it's not okay.

00:20:55.670 --> 00:20:58.250
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Of course
that reinforces that idea

00:20:58.250 --> 00:21:02.200
of racial national difference and I
think one of the key terms we play

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.100
with is the very idea of race,

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:06.900
which doesn't have a fixed
meaning at this period.

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:12.400
It's equivalent to nation, people,
race in the modern sense, ethnicity

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:15.620
and if enslaved Africans

00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:21.630 position:56%
and African-Americans are a distinct
people nation race then how could

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:27.470
they possibly live with the
people who had enslaved them.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:29.490
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Yeah,
but there would be no peace

00:21:29.490 --> 00:21:32.560
and that's the thing that
really gives people a problem

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:35.750
about Jefferson because we
congratulate ourselves and think

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:37.800
that well we're better,
we're enlightened now,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.590
we're all living together in
peace and harmony, yeah, right?

00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:42.670
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Oh,
come on, we get along.

00:21:42.670 --> 00:21:43.970
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: We get --

00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:45.270
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: It's
going well up here.

00:21:45.270 --> 00:21:46.570
I'm happy.

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:49.090
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed:
You're happy, you're happy.

00:21:49.090 --> 00:21:51.420
We're kind of getting along.

00:21:53.060 --> 00:21:56.970
We're getting along yeah but I mean
but he doesn't have the confidence

00:21:56.970 --> 00:22:00.080
that -- how could blacks love a
country that has treated them --

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:01.380
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: No, exactly.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.750
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: So
poorly, how could you do

00:22:02.750 --> 00:22:05.560
that because this is him
saying I know what I would do

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:09.420
and so transferring, basically
saying that other people --

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:10.720
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: That's
the down side

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:15.300
of like a sentimental conception of
what nation is a great big family.

00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.600
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed:
Who love each other.

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:20.570
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Yeah, well how
long did it take for the laws

00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:23.550
to change on interracial
marriage in America.

00:22:23.550 --> 00:22:25.920
I mean we're talking about
basic stuff for Jefferson,

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:30.170
would I want my daughters
to marry black people.

00:22:30.170 --> 00:22:33.120
This is insane and so that idea

00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.510
of the unnaturalness
of the races mixing --

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.990
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: But except,
it's interesting we talk about this

00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:46.330
in the book that it's very, very,
it's the attitude of the conqueror,

00:22:46.330 --> 00:22:50.630
white men have access to the
bodies of white women, black women,

00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:54.840
Native American women but
not the other way around.

00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:57.440
And so really for Jefferson and
those in the state of Virginia

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.690
when he's talking about mixing
he's talking about the horror

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:05.060
of the mixing of white yes

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.270
of a black men having
access to white women.

00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:11.400
To white women -- to black
women, black men having access

00:23:11.400 --> 00:23:14.110
to white women, that's the
problem, he didn't have any problem

00:23:14.110 --> 00:23:19.150 position:56%
with the other way around it because
he knows, he knows that in slavery,

00:23:19.150 --> 00:23:21.750
slavery is a laboratory
for that kind of thing.

00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:23.050
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: In
his own household.

00:23:23.050 --> 00:23:25.360
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: In his own
household, in his own household,

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:29.520
in his father-in-law, people in
Virginia just in general it's clear

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.760
that this is something
that was a big part

00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.290
of life during that time period.

00:23:34.290 --> 00:23:35.650
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Think
about the implications

00:23:35.650 --> 00:23:40.920
of abolishing artificial
hierarchy's among white people,

00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.360
that is aristocracy, monarchy
all people are white people,

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:50.250
citizens are created
equal but you can do that

00:23:50.250 --> 00:23:52.880
but then you draw attention
to divisions

00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:56.120
that you consider natural,
not artificial.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:59.910
To have a king what does a king
do, Thomas Payne tells us all

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:01.410
about this in Common Sense.

00:24:01.410 --> 00:24:05.770 position:56%
He's just descended from a French
bastard, there's nothing legitimate,

00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:08.630
a very important word in regimes,
there's nothing legitimate

00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:11.950
about monarchy so you abolish
all those things and we agree

00:24:11.950 --> 00:24:13.250
on that, we celebrate this.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.800
This was the first
grade modern republic,

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:18.570
yet what that then
draws your attention

00:24:18.570 --> 00:24:21.110
to is well how is society
constituted,

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:23.850
what are the natural sorts
of relations that emerge.

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:27.150
And we'd like to think that would
mean everybody who's involved

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:29.790
in the revolution, we'd let the
loyalists go back to Britain,

00:24:29.790 --> 00:24:31.310
or the maritime provinces.

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:33.820
They're going to love each
other; it's going to be fine.

00:24:33.820 --> 00:24:38.160
But there's a distinction
here, a distinction that runs

00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:40.850
down through the society itself,

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:43.190
we have two peoples
living in one place.

00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:47.460
It's unnatural because it's vitally
important to have this relationship

00:24:47.460 --> 00:24:48.800
to the land, to your country,

00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:52.600
this is what patriotism
means is love of country.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:54.700
And we have a people
here against their will

00:24:54.700 --> 00:25:00.400
who we own unjustly,
this is impossible.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.720
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed:
They cannot look --

00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.130
they cannot love us and we won't
love them and they cannot love us

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:09.890
and we cannot form families,
how can you be equal citizens

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.870 position:56%
if you cannot be in the same family.

00:25:13.870 --> 00:25:17.530
Yes, we're all equal the same but
you can't be my daughter-in-law,

00:25:17.530 --> 00:25:19.050
you can't be my son-in-law.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.590
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: You
include part of a letter

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:24.300
that Thomas Jefferson writes
to John Adams towards the end

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:27.480
of both their lives,
there's this historic miracle

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.360
that both John Adams and Thomas
Jefferson die on the same day,

00:25:30.360 --> 00:25:33.360
on July 4th, fifty
years after the signing

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.710
of the Declaration of Independence.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:40.890
He says time which outlives all
things will outlive this evil also,

00:25:40.890 --> 00:25:42.900
clearly taking the long
view [inaudible] who knows

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:46.030
when exactly he's thinking
that will happen.

00:25:46.030 --> 00:25:48.100
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: But remember
he believes in the afterlife.

00:25:48.100 --> 00:25:49.400
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: That's
true he believes

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.800
in the afterlife imagine
him looking down.

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:58.100
But I'm curious in his writings
and his letters he talks of slavery

00:25:58.100 --> 00:26:02.000
on a grand scale as an institution
but does he ever refer to it

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:03.610
within the context of his family.

00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:07.250
Does he talk about any of the
paradox or the contradiction

00:26:07.250 --> 00:26:11.160
that we see now in his relations
with Sally Hemings or any

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:14.380
of the other enslaved people on
the plantation, in a direct way.

00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.610
Does he wrestle with that ever?

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:20.300
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: No,
he's not wrestling with this,

00:26:20.300 --> 00:26:25.180
he's not wrestling with Sally
Hemings, you know talking

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:27.350
about Sally Hemings
or anything like that.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:34.060 position:56%
He doesn't as I was saying before he
sees himself as being a good master

00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:39.420
to these people and is not
-- to my family and it's not,

00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:42.940
this is not something that is
keeping him up at night and most

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:47.380
of the time that he's talking
about slavery it's at the request

00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:51.200
of somebody, somebody has written
to him and asked him about it.

00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:53.100
He's not being proactive,
going out [inaudible].

00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:56.090
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: If he were
from New England he'd feel guilty

00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:58.650
and he wouldn't sleep
at night, but he's not.

00:26:58.650 --> 00:26:59.950
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: He's a Virginian.

00:26:59.950 --> 00:27:01.250
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Yeah.

00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:02.550
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: No offense.

00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:03.850
You, I'm sorry.

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:07.400
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: No I was going
to say though there's a lot

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:11.170
of projection in Jefferson,
when I least liked Jefferson,

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:15.890
when I most dislike him is
when solution to any problem,

00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:19.620
why there is a problem it's
somebody else's fault and this idea

00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:22.790 position:56%
of the scenario that we sketched out
of how you would have emancipation

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:26.780
in Virginia the white majority
finally realized it has to act

00:27:26.780 --> 00:27:28.910
because that's the basic
republican requirement.

00:27:28.910 --> 00:27:33.200
Well, whose fault is it and
he says this repeatedly,

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:37.310
I have made it clear
what my position is,

00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:40.380
this is the only solution
you're going to have to wake

00:27:40.380 --> 00:27:42.800
up to this and now as you quoted.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:44.760
It's going to take an age;
it's not going to happen

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.550
in my life time but
it's not his fault.

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:51.380
See that's where we have the
problem, we said Jefferson come on,

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:55.710
go to church, get down,
apologize, I mean feel bad.

00:27:55.710 --> 00:27:57.010
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Get down?

00:27:57.010 --> 00:27:59.490
Get down on your knees.

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Is that idiomatic?

00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:03.640
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: I
have no idea what that means.

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:06.470
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: Pray
for forgiveness.

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:07.770
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Gosh.

00:28:07.770 --> 00:28:11.820
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: I
have to say one of my --

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:13.800
shifting gears here just a
little bit before this gets

00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:15.450
too controversial.

00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:20.100
You talk about exploding some of
the myths around Thomas Jefferson

00:28:20.100 --> 00:28:23.310
and one of my favorites I have
to say is the notion that he goes

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:28.050
to France as a minister to France
he arrives in 1784 in [inaudible]

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.710
and as you describe it,
promptly flees by porters

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:33.970
because he really spoke
very little French.

00:28:33.970 --> 00:28:37.280
He studied French, he was
[inaudible] he knew all sorts

00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:40.260
of things but his language
skills were not up to snuff.

00:28:40.260 --> 00:28:41.860
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Well,
he knew how to read French

00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.830
and if you -- I mean speaking a
language is very, very different,

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:47.530
I mean difficult, I mean it's
one thing to study something

00:28:47.530 --> 00:28:51.300
and then actually go to France and
having people speak in the normal,

00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:54.610
it sounds like a mile a minute
but the normal way of speaking

00:28:54.610 --> 00:28:57.460
to sort of pull it altogether.

00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:01.890
He read French well and
he can understand people

00:29:01.890 --> 00:29:03.730
but he had difficulty
speaking the language.

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:09.420 position:56%
His daughters and Sally Hemings and
James Hemings eventually learned how

00:29:09.420 --> 00:29:13.680
to speak pretty well but he was
older when he goes to France.

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.080
He was in his 40's and
language is not easily acquired

00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.570
at that time period.

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:22.740
My favorite story about of
that time period is him going

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.540
to a chess club and --

00:29:25.540 --> 00:29:26.840
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: In Paris.

00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.550 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: In Paris and
then getting beaten really easily,

00:29:29.550 --> 00:29:33.200
handily by people and
he doesn't go back.

00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.750
And we think that's
interesting because my husband

00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:40.660
who played chess competitively
said the only way

00:29:40.660 --> 00:29:43.550
to get better playing chess
is to play with people

00:29:43.550 --> 00:29:44.850
who are better than you are.

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:48.870
And it's sort of an interesting
thing that he did not --

00:29:48.870 --> 00:29:51.440
he loved to play chess but
he did not want to do it,

00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:54.540
he didn't love it enough,
to go get beat repeatedly

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:58.460
until he got better
and better at it.

00:29:58.460 --> 00:30:00.380
So some very thin skinned
person [inaudible].

00:30:00.380 --> 00:30:02.970
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: And he's
very anxious and it's --

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:04.360
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed:
You identify with that.

00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:12.150
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Yeah, I'm a
white guy it's hard but when he's

00:30:12.150 --> 00:30:14.430
in France what is most remarkable

00:30:14.430 --> 00:30:19.720
to us I think beyond the initial
culture shock and his need

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.520
to create a little Virginia at
home, so he could be comfortable.

00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.950
He needs a comfort zone, it's
the danger he feels that lurks

00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:31.370
in French society to
impressionable young people,

00:30:31.370 --> 00:30:34.400
he can barely resist
the temptations himself

00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:38.030
so young people don't
go to Paris because --

00:30:38.030 --> 00:30:39.840
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed:
You got women who are

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:44.890
in the streets you know
messing in politics.

00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:48.750
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: And that's why he
celebrates the properly constituted

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:54.780
republican family where women have
their place, they play their role

00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:00.650
but they're not doing politics,
they're not influencing society,

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:03.980
they're in their place
and he's upset with this.

00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:07.750
And it has a lot to do with
sexuality with the temptations

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:12.100 position:56%
that he sees there and one of his
letters he suggests that if you come

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:16.420
to France at an impressionable
age two things will happen to you.

00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:20.030
You'll develop a taste for
whores and you'll never learn

00:31:20.030 --> 00:31:22.640
to speak your own language well

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:27.070
because during this crucial period
you'll be speaking another language

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:28.990
and having too much of a good time.

00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:31.660
And what's really important
you know --

00:31:31.660 --> 00:31:36.720
what's really important is that
you're going to have to go back

00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:40.110
in a republic, the key art
in a republic is persuasion,

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:43.170
you know speaking well,
oratory is very important.

00:31:43.170 --> 00:31:46.930
So if you can't speak
the language well

00:31:46.930 --> 00:31:52.420
and if you're proclivities
sexually develop

00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:56.590
in this abnormal pathological
way, then the very foundation

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:58.470
of the republic is
going to be subverted.

00:31:58.470 --> 00:32:00.760
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: I'm want to leave
time for questions but I do want

00:32:00.760 --> 00:32:02.870
to ask you one thing, as
co-authors of this book

00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:06.970
and I'm enjoying listening to
your slight disagreements here.

00:32:06.970 --> 00:32:11.020
Were there points when
you really couldn't agree,

00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:12.390
I mean how did you divide --

00:32:12.390 --> 00:32:13.690
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Tell the story --

00:32:13.690 --> 00:32:14.990
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: Did you
go chapter by chapter,

00:32:14.990 --> 00:32:19.930
did have to come to consensus.

00:32:19.930 --> 00:32:22.760
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: She's going to
talk about religion now, okay.

00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.200
I pray you do.

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:27.940
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Oh,
I suppose the biggest dispute

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.380
between us was Jefferson's
Christianity.

00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:35.950
Peter, he calls himself
a lapsed Unitarian.

00:32:35.950 --> 00:32:38.330
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Redundant.

00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:43.550
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: And my
thing was always how could you tell

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:46.810
and I grew up in the
United Methodist tradition

00:32:46.810 --> 00:32:50.880
and Jefferson calling himself
a Christian I was not convinced

00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:52.180
about that.

00:32:52.180 --> 00:32:53.480
And I was sort of --

00:32:53.480 --> 00:32:55.180
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: That's when I was
reduced to prayer at that point.

00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.480
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed:
Reduced to prayer at that point

00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:02.060
and he convinced me that I was
perhaps being too judgmental

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:06.520
in that idea because
to sort of suggest

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.300
that Jefferson did not
believe in the divinity

00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:14.100
of Christ he believed Jesus
was a great moral teacher

00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:17.480
and that you should live
according to the precepts of Jesus

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.260
but not Jesus the Christ.

00:33:19.260 --> 00:33:23.060
That's why he writes the Life and
Morals of Jesus of Nazareth instead

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:26.500
of Jesus Christ and when
he takes out the Bible,

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:31.600 position:56%
he scissors out parts -- razors out
parts of the Bible that he considers

00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:35.840
to be the mysticism and
sort of magical thinking.

00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:43.230
But he convinced me that I had too
narrow of a view of all of this.

00:33:43.230 --> 00:33:47.280
So that was an area that
he persuaded me about.

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:49.530
We had other small disputes

00:33:49.530 --> 00:33:53.330
and sometimes you just
you know, just let it go.

00:33:53.330 --> 00:33:56.130
It was the song -- the
movie with let it go,

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.630
let it go [inaudible]
let it go, let it go.

00:33:58.630 --> 00:34:03.160
No I'm not going to sing it,
no I'm not going to sing that.

00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:07.980
But we didn't have a lot,
we basically agreed --

00:34:07.980 --> 00:34:10.780
the basic understanding
about Jefferson it's not

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:12.670
that different [inaudible].

00:34:12.670 --> 00:34:16.310 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: What was wonderful
about this collaboration for me

00:34:16.310 --> 00:34:22.750
and I think for both of us was that
we brought complimentary knowledge

00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:27.870
and skills together and I think
the fit has been wonderful.

00:34:27.870 --> 00:34:31.240
We've enjoyed working
together, the only down side

00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:33.920
for me is I am now
known as a biographer,

00:34:33.920 --> 00:34:36.440
I don't do biographies,
don't believe it.

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:38.260
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: There are
two microphones by the way

00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:42.810 position:56%
if people want to make their way for
any questions that you might have,

00:34:42.810 --> 00:34:44.110
feel free to come forward.

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:47.240
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Well, here
comes some people, yay, questions.

00:34:47.240 --> 00:34:48.950
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: And you have
gotten there first so we're going

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:50.440
to go to this mic first, yeah.

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:55.740
&gt;&gt; Oh, I'm so excited to be
first, Annette I loved your book,

00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:59.070
Hemings of Monticello, it's
been a huge inspiration for me.

00:34:59.070 --> 00:35:00.370
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Thank you.

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:03.710
&gt;&gt; And I'm writing a book
and I'm interested in craft,

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:06.360
a craft question for you, how --

00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:09.610
what are the biggest
obstacles you had

00:35:09.610 --> 00:35:12.070
in trying put together the sources

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:15.380
that you were using
to create a narrative?

00:35:16.590 --> 00:35:17.890
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Well,

00:35:17.890 --> 00:35:22.790
the biggest obstacle is actually
pulling it altogether and trying

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:27.640
to find the right way
to craft a narrative.

00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:31.680 position:56%
I mean to have lots of information,
to know what to go in and what to go

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:36.910
out -- what to leave in and what to
take out that's the biggest thing.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:40.610
There was a lot there I
think but we don't have a lot

00:35:40.610 --> 00:35:46.400 position:56%
of direct evidence form or any
evidence from sally Hemings herself,

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:49.920
but you have to sort of
research around the situation.

00:35:49.920 --> 00:36:00.740 position:56%
It's funny because I didn't perceive
it as a problem, it was fun,

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:04.550
I mean I think I'm a natural
detective, I love to write

00:36:04.550 --> 00:36:10.650
but I love to research, if not
more but certainly as much.

00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:12.110
But I would say if I were

00:36:12.110 --> 00:36:14.980
to say what a problem would
be it was learning how

00:36:14.980 --> 00:36:18.450
to take the material and
turn it into a narrative

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:26.380 position:56%
and to know I have a file -- the old
saying, you know kill your darlings.

00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.490
I never killed them I
just sort of exiled them.

00:36:29.490 --> 00:36:30.950
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: They're
still there.

00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:32.250
They're zombies.

00:36:32.250 --> 00:36:34.490
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: They
are exiled, it's called outtakes

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:37.720
and you just take stuff and put
it away and say you may be able

00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:39.020
to come back to that later on.

00:36:39.020 --> 00:36:40.320
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: On another day.

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.250
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: So it
really is just paring things

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.010
down was the biggest problem.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:46.690
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: thank you
for your question, over here.

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:51.770
&gt;&gt; Yeah, Annette and Peter, the big
thing today in New York is Hamilton

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:56.680 position:56%
and if you look at Chernow's book --
I've read your book, I've read a lot

00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:01.690
of books, it's a big emphasis
of the fighting that went

00:37:01.690 --> 00:37:08.460
on between Jefferson, Hamilton,
Adams and Madison joining

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.180
with Jefferson and others.

00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:16.660
And you know -- it's and then
you know it's secretary of state

00:37:16.660 --> 00:37:23.020 position:56%
and leaving and I don't know whether
it was a temporary perspective

00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.700
that Jefferson had during the
Washington administration.

00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:28.760
And Washington is from Virginia.

00:37:28.760 --> 00:37:35.540
And I was sort of surprised to
see after reading your books,

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.720 position:56%
how Jefferson turned out to be evil.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:40.220
Am I crazy or --

00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:41.520
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Did
you just say evil?

00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:46.580 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Evil, I mean because of he was
against the Washington's approach --

00:37:46.580 --> 00:37:48.680
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: How many
times have you seen Hamilton?

00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:57.930
&gt;&gt; I have the CD here, no, no, no
and also you know Miranda's book.

00:37:57.930 --> 00:38:01.290
No, no, no the fact of looking

00:38:01.290 --> 00:38:06.750
at Chernow's book he takes
a certain perspective.

00:38:06.750 --> 00:38:08.050
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Could
I start an answer?

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:09.350
&gt;&gt; Go ahead.

00:38:09.350 --> 00:38:10.650
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: Okay and
Annette will set me right,

00:38:10.650 --> 00:38:18.060
first of all the idea of
political opposition is

00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.760
absolutely illegitimate.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.960
Party faction no good, a
republic, we've been talking

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.810
about love ad nauseam,
it's supposed to be

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:30.490
that people do recognize
common values and commitments.

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:31.790
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:34.500
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: And they don't
and of course love always makes --

00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:36.980
failed love always
makes things worse.

00:38:36.980 --> 00:38:41.040
As Freud would tell you
about love, hate and confect.

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.830
And the second thing is to
get back to the real world,

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:48.710
there's no guarantee that the
American Union will survive.

00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:53.690 position:56%
There's no guarantee that the United
States should ever cut a figure

00:38:53.690 --> 00:38:57.710
in world affairs, it's from a
world historical perspective,

00:38:57.710 --> 00:39:00.390
it's the odds against
it are tremendous.

00:39:00.390 --> 00:39:03.570
In other words, there
is so much at stake.

00:39:03.570 --> 00:39:04.870
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:06.910
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: And of course
with the image of planting the seed

00:39:06.910 --> 00:39:10.670
and this tree starts to grow in one
direction that could be forever.

00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:12.730 position:56%
They know they're starting something

00:39:12.730 --> 00:39:15.580
and if they start it
wrong it will fail.

00:39:15.580 --> 00:39:16.880
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.800
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: And so everything
is at stake and I personally

00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:22.210
and I do get in trouble with
Annette on this, I'm a little hard

00:39:22.210 --> 00:39:25.360
on Jefferson when we write
about politics, I don't know,

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:29.800
I understand what they're
both doing,

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:31.100
they make a lot of sense to me.

00:39:31.100 --> 00:39:33.910
The physical military state,
Hamilton, he's got it.

00:39:33.910 --> 00:39:35.540
Jefferson has the notion of how

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:38.680
to create a legitimate regime
that's going to connect people.

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:42.640
Forge new kinds of attachments
that will sustain the government.

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:45.630
All that makes sense, they
all made their contribution

00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:48.500
but you can see what the stakes
are and why they would be

00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.640
at each other's throats and all

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.200
because Washington is
listening to Hamilton too much.

00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.140
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: We only
have a few minutes left,

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:59.150
I want to go to another question.

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:01.870
&gt;&gt; I have two if you allow it.

00:40:01.870 --> 00:40:03.170
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: Fast.

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:06.390
&gt;&gt; Frist of all when I went to
Monticello one thing that occurred

00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:11.850
to me was that what Jefferson was
doing relied a lot on his leisure,

00:40:11.850 --> 00:40:14.700
his ability to just kind of spend
time on the things he wanted

00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:20.360
to spend time on and so clearly he
relied heavily on slave ownership

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:22.250
in order to do those things.

00:40:22.250 --> 00:40:28.720
And yet you are also saying that
he saw his lifestyle as a model

00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:33.550
for people to live by, so in a
sense he thought that the model

00:40:33.550 --> 00:40:38.430
of the republic would have had to
rely on the institution of slavery

00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:42.330
for people to continue
to try to model that.

00:40:42.330 --> 00:40:49.200
So was he conscious of that and how
would he deal with that in terms

00:40:49.200 --> 00:40:50.710
of his idea of the ideal republic?

00:40:50.710 --> 00:40:52.010
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: All right
do you want to take that,

00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:53.310
we're going to have to
leave it at one question

00:40:53.310 --> 00:40:54.610
to try to get in someone else.

00:40:54.610 --> 00:40:57.360
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Well, I
think that he felt that eventually,

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.790
it's back to this point about
what would change later on,

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:04.820
he did not think the model
would not be slave owner

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:08.940
because eventually slavery would
go away and what he wanted would be

00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:14.030
to have family farms, yeoman
farmers, they would take over.

00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:17.520
But what he wanted people to
model was his ideas about science,

00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:20.220
his ideas about art,
those kinds of things,

00:41:20.220 --> 00:41:27.420
I don't think he saw plantation
life as a that aspect of his life.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:32.740 position:56%
It was the exalted, the more exalted
things and not just the institution

00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.520
that he thought was going to leave.

00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:36.820
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: And
one way of thinking

00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.700
about it is his educational
system capped

00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:44.420
by the university is the very
narrow apex of a great pyramid

00:41:44.420 --> 00:41:46.850
that beings with primary education.

00:41:46.850 --> 00:41:49.020
He doesn't think everybody
is going to reach the top,

00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:51.700
so he's not modeling in that sense,

00:41:51.700 --> 00:41:54.740
you might say that what has
characterized American middle class

00:41:54.740 --> 00:41:58.390 position:56%
society is its aspirational quality.

00:41:58.390 --> 00:42:04.070
Be all you can be, be
learned, learn, be enlightened

00:42:04.070 --> 00:42:07.580
and every man can participate
in enlightenment.

00:42:07.580 --> 00:42:12.420
And I think that's the idea so that
anyone would be edified, educated

00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:15.590
and enlightened by visiting
Monticello and pearls

00:42:15.590 --> 00:42:19.320
of wisdom falling from the great
man, what a magnificent thing.

00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.580
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: One more
question before we have to break.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:27.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; I'd like to go back to this issue
of writing a joint historical study

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:30.110
like this and perhaps you
could tell us a little bit

00:42:30.110 --> 00:42:35.920
about how you got the idea of
working together on this book

00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:42.350
and then how coordinated
different sections

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:45.080
or different aspects of the book.

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.380
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: Sure, thank you.

00:42:46.380 --> 00:42:47.680
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: Okay,

00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:49.400
well Peter said he was
going to retire and --

00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:50.700
&gt;&gt; Peter S. Onuf: I did.

00:42:50.700 --> 00:42:53.130
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed: And he
did retire and I got the idea

00:42:53.130 --> 00:42:55.820
that he should -- I didn't
want him to sort of ride off

00:42:55.820 --> 00:43:05.720 position:56%
into the sunset yet, and I asked him
to write a book with me [inaudible].

00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:11.040
Well, you know it's what I
can do, I did what I could,

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:16.050
so that's how we got
the idea of doing it.

00:43:16.050 --> 00:43:18.550
We've been talking to
each other since 1995

00:43:18.550 --> 00:43:22.640
and I thought you know we should do
something together and so instead

00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:25.290
of -- our editor wanted
us to have one voice.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:27.040
So it wouldn't be good
for him to write a chapter

00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:28.870
and me write a chapter,
just to do it like

00:43:28.870 --> 00:43:33.030
and have somebody responsible
for different sections of it.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:36.700
So we tried to write sections
and send them to each other.

00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:40.080
We skyped every week for a period
of time when we were being very,

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:43.580
very efficient, we went out
on the road and we talked

00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:46.460
about this quite a bit even
before we began to write.

00:43:46.460 --> 00:43:49.370
So we wanted to try to craft
as much as we possibly could,

00:43:49.370 --> 00:43:51.930
I mean there's some things,
some sections that are more him

00:43:51.930 --> 00:43:56.450
and more me but everything we
all went over and approved it.

00:43:56.450 --> 00:43:58.170
Changed sentences,
moved things around.

00:43:58.170 --> 00:44:01.770
There's some little quirks and
whatever that I can recognize

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:04.210
that are mine and some that
I can recognize are him

00:44:04.210 --> 00:44:07.280
but a lot times I don't
really know who wrote what.

00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:08.580
&gt;&gt; Melissa Block: And they're
still talking [laughter].

00:44:08.580 --> 00:44:11.890
Do we have time for
one more question?

00:44:11.890 --> 00:44:13.790
We're over time, thank you.

00:44:13.790 --> 00:44:17.630
Annette Gordon-Reed, Peter Onuf,

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:20.280
thank you so much [inaudible]
thank you for coming.

00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:22.510
&gt;&gt; Annette Gordon-Reed:
Thank you very much.
