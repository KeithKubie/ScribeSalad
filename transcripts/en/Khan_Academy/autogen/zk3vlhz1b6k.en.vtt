00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.960
 In modern times we tend to have cells 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.500
 All living organisms consist of cells 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Human beings and all living organisms are made up of many cells 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:19.380
 Cells in the human body are estimated at 37 trillion cells! 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.200
 But if we return 400 years ago in the 1960s 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.000
 This was not clear 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.920
 Because people did not have enough tools 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.960
 To study the cells and did not know their existence 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.040
 Nor were they aware of the existence of organisms such as single cells 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.340
 But all that changed with Robert Hook 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.500
 When he could invent a primitive microscope 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.400
 This is the microscope image 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.980
 See how similar 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.720
 Modern microscope 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.660
 The microscope has lenses to enlarge 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.280
 But Robert had to use - this torch to direct the light 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.420
 To reflect on what he is watching 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.840
 In 1665, Robert published "microscopy". 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.340
 Maybe you did not type the name correctly 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.740
 This is the year 1665 where Robert Hook describes 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.760
 And draws a lot of 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.680
 Of his observations using an engraver 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.320
 Robert has some amazing graphics where he was a good painter 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.720
 He was able to draw pictures 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.940
 Of his observations, such as lice, fleas. 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.580
 But he did not watch only lice and fleas 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.880
 But was able to observe the so-called piles or what he saw as cufflinks 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:49.160
 When he noticed something, he said, "Look at these little squares here 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:56.160
 "It reminds me of the little rooms called cells 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.040
 So Robert called them cells 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.220
 Hence came the label 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:02.060
 Cells in the "microscopy". 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.020
 This is the cell 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.140
 Unfortunately, Robert was a wonderful artist 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.780
 It was good at drawing things 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.580
 Drawing a lot using "microscopy" but do not have any pictures of Robert Hook 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.880
 It is a wonderful story where most novels claim 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.920
 That Isaac Newton burned the only original painting of Robert Hook. 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.320
 It's an interesting story that we'll talk about later 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:31.800
 Robert Hook discovered "cells" - but he was looking at the dead tissue, and actually he was 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.040
 Look at the cell residue. What he saw was just the remnants of the cell wall. 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.920
 He was not able to observe the "living cells" directly he was wondering 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.140
 "Maybe this is a stone building in life and cells multiply by themselves" 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:52.520
 "The cells produce other cells." We need to go deeper into history to see the evolution of these stages 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.320
 A few years later Anthony von Ewenhoek appeared. 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.320
 He may not have pronounced his name correctly 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.640
 He was a Dutch lens maker, and the work of Robert Hook was an inspiration 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.940
 "Hey, I can make the lenses to make the microscopes better, so I watch better." 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.240
 He was able to do this, and already he watched 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:17.040
 Living cells and single - cell organisms. 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.920
 And watch the sperm. 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.340
 "This thing seems alive," he said, 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:30.960
 It was able to monitor cells directly - these single-cell and eukaryotic cells ... 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.780
 Which have walls of cells, and these things look like single-celled animals. 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.780
 They were called "microscopic animals". 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:47.240
 He said, "Hey, it looks like these little animals that are going on here." 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.060
 "Maybe this is a basic form of life," he said, 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.300
 Or on this basis there is life 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:03.040
 But the modern theory of cells appeared only after 100-150 years 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.480
 Here we are in the early 1980s 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:13.620
 If we progress quickly to the year 1830. These two men Matthias Schladin and Theodore Xuan 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.360
 Laying the foundation 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.240
 What we call today "modern cell theory". 

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.320
 Modern cell theory 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.720
 Based on their observations and conclusions 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.480
 They said, "Perhaps all organisms are made up 

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:42.360
 Of one or more cells ". 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.660
 Today we are sure of this but it was not clear 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.600
 It was not clear that these things were the foundation stone of life 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.100
 Since life consists of one or more cells, 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.740
 It can also be said that the cell, is the basic unit of life. 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:07.480
 Cell is the basic unit of life 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:09.680
 These powerful statements that all life forms from the smallest things 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.820
 Consists of the cells that make up life. 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.840
 Well, the theory is not yet complete. These two men learned that the cells are made up of other cells 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.320
 They were able to control cell proliferation however 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.820
 The question still exists "Maybe some cells are produced by other cells, while some are automatically made up of themselves in one way or another 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.700
 If the elements and conditions are appropriate these cells appear from nowhere 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:46.580
 Modern cell theory only emerged in the mid 1800s 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.300
 The idea is that all cells are produced from other cells. 

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:56.340
 All cells are produced from other cells 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.960
 And the true founder who proved this idea 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.800
 This guy is here, Robert Remac. 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.200
 Sometimes thanks to this man Rudolph Verschau but turned out to be 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:17.840
 He stole the work from Remac, so the biggest credit to Remac 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.060
 At this stage all cells come from other cells. 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:23.980
 Again, I was not the first person to say "hey, we will note that some cells .. 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:31.560
 Produced from other cells. "But he said:" This is the basic thing, all cells appear on their own " 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.780
 In our world today, people see 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.020
 That cells are produced from other cells 

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:42.740
 It is normal to ask "Is there a first cell or an initial set of" cell model? "He said. 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:47.100
 People were not so sure but if 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:53.320
 Going back, to the evolution of life on earth, it is possible that the first cells emerged about three and a half billion years ago. 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:57.480
 And we are not quite sure of the way it appeared, but there are some theories that explain: 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:00.600
 For example, there are videos on phosphatic lipids, 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:09.460
 Phosphate lipids were formed from the double layers 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:15.500
 In fact, they are made up of spherical membranes made up of double phosphorous layers. 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.320
 Here the beginning, so that can be formed spontaneously. 

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.700
 There are also theories that explain the mechanism of action of cells 

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.520
 Maybe if we came back three and a half billion years ago 

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:34.840
 RNA molecules may be self-replicating or perhaps self-replicating proteins 

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:39.820
 With a lot of time passing 

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:44.820
 Was able to start repeating itself as it had more sophisticated mechanisms, 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:50.500
 Those that have formed modern cells and are able to produce more, 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:54.340
 They were able to utilize more energy, resources and environment. 

00:07:54.340 --> 00:08:00.540
 Finally we end up getting modern cells but this wonderful question is still under consideration.
