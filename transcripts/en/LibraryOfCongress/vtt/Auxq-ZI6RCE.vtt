00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.560
&gt;&gt; Betsy Peterson: Hello, everyone.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.860
I'm Betsy Peterson, director of
the American Folklife Center here

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.830
at the Library of Congress
and I want to welcome you

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:32.900
to the latest presentation in the
Benjamin Botkin Lecture Series.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:37.410
The Botkin series is an opportunity
for the American Folklife Center

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.820
to present the very best research
from leading scholars in folklore,

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.970
ethnomusicology, world
history, and cultural heritage.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.680
It also allows us to
enhance our collections.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.390
And by that, what I mean is each
of these lectures are videotaped

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.810
and they become a part
of our archive.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.500
They also are eventually
posted in the library's website

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.200
and made available to Internet
patrons throughout the world

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.700
and are preserved for
future generations.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.850
So with all of that
description, please let me ask

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.690
if you have any electronic
devices turned

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.750
on at this point, please
turn them off.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.760
We would greatly appreciate it.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.050
And while you're doing that,

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:29.870
let me tell you a little
bit about today's lecture.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:31.260
Today, I have the owner honor

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.770
of introducing the distinguished
scholar Gearóid Ó hAllmhuráin.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.070
Professor Ó hAllmhuráin is
an award-winning Irish musician

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.400
ethnomusicologist and
cultural historian.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:48.550

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.990
And he currently holds the
bilingual Johnson chair

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.440
A native of County Clare, he has
performed, broadcast, adjudicated,

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.250 position:56%
and lectured on Irish music

He holds degrees from
University College Cork,

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.870
Queens University Belfast
and the Sorbonne.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:22.970
His musical career is

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.120
as distinguished as
his academic career.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.650
A formal member of the
Kilfenora Ceili Band,

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:35.530 position:56%
he is a five-time all-Ireland
champion musician on uilleann pipes,

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.950

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.010
And he is a fourth-generation
Clare concertina player.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.560
He's also produced numerous
CDs, documentary films,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.070
and radio programs, and
is a frequent commentator

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.460
on Irish music and culture.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:56.680
He is also the author of a pocket
history of Irish traditional music,

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.230
which has just been
re-released as a short history

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.820
of Irish traditional music as
well as writing numerous chapters

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.970
and articles on Irish
music and culture.

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:12.150
His widely acclaimed book,
Flowing Tides: History and Memory

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.090
in an Irish Soundscape,

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.930
was published by Oxford
University press in 2016.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.010
Both books are being
offered for sale today

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.250
by the LOC bookshop
just right outside.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.730
And Professor Ó hAllmhuráin
will be taking part

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.310
in a book signing immediately
following his talk.

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.730
So again, thank you for coming
today, and please join me

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.210
in welcoming Profewssor Ó
hAllmhuráin for his talk

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.200
on Flowing Tides: Musical Memory,
History, and Global Culture

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:45.730
in County Clare, Ireland.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.030
Thanks.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.590
[ Applause ]

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.890
&gt;&gt; Gearóid Ó hAllmhuráin:
Thank you so much.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.510
Thank you so much.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:14.630
[ Speaking Irish ]

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.170
Good afternoon, and welcome.

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.190
I should like to say at the
onset that it's a singular honor

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.250
to be invited to give a
Benjamin Botkin lecture

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.180
by the American Folklife Center,
and to be given an opportunity

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.740
to present that lecture here in
the historic Library of Congress.

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:39.750
Before commencing, I would like to
start by thanking Betsy Peterson

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.950
for that wonderful,
warm introduction.

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.110
It's a pleasure to cross the
Canadian border and travel

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.740
down the historic East Coast
to this historic center.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.740
I know I'm in the company
of Beethoven

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.670
and a whole lot of
other musical greats.

00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:03.550
Before commencing, I would also
like to extend my sincerest thanks

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.110
to the directors, librarians
and staff

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:11.570 position:56%
of both the American Folklife Center
and also the Library of Congress

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:13.950
for making this opportunity
possible.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.750
And while I'm thanking
people, I would especially

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.640
like to think Kia [phonetic],
John [assumed spelling],

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.170
Mike [assumed spelling],
Grant [assumed spelling],

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.110
and all of the IT team
for working with me

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.540
so diligently for the last hour.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:34.620
I'd also like to thank the bookshop
people for selling the books.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:39.180
They are offered today at a
discount, so I would be more

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:41.160
than honored to go
home with all of you.

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:43.300
[ Laughter ]

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:48.630
I first read about the Library
of Congress as a child growing

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.110
up in a small town in
the west of Ireland

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:56.690
where our own small library
was our center of cultural

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:59.170
and intellectual engagement.

00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.880
And I remember being so impressed
by the vision of James Madison,

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.090
John Adams, and Thomas
Jefferson that led to the birth

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.730
and the early development
of the Library of Congress.

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.590
As a child, I remember being
extremely envious of the number

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.660
of books housed here --
almost 24 million, I believe,

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.000
at the present time, and 164
million different items --

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.530
and thinking as a child how
lucky Americans were to have

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:34.960
such a Promethean storehouse
at their disposal.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:40.090
Walking in here this morning, I
was again struck by that same sense

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:45.390
of wonder, but this
time, it was for real.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.600
Indeed, there is an awesome sense
of pride and reassurance in knowing

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.800
that the vision of these Founding
Fathers continues to resonate

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:00.160
in this place, particularly at
this difficult time in our history

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.110
when science and intellectual
culture are being denigrated

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.810
by political expediency.

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.970
My presentation today, however,
takes us beyond the world of books

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:16.020
and the world of text
into the world of sound.

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:21.410
To another time and another place
on the western fringe of Europe,

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:25.250
where culture and politics
have also clashed,

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:29.810
leaving in their wake a
soundscape that has endured

00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:34.550
and thrived both locally
and globally.

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:38.930
Ireland, as many of you
know, is a natural haven

00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:41.980
on the Atlantic seaways
that link Nordic Europe

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.840
with the Mediterranean Sea.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:49.660
For 8,000 years, it has experienced
cultural and economic contact

00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:55.060
with people and civilizations
along this oceanic fringe from Cork

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:58.670
to Compostela, from
Limerick to Narvik.

00:07:58.670 --> 00:08:03.530
These exchanges brought priests,
traders, migrants and settlers

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:05.540
to Ireland over the centuries.

00:08:05.540 --> 00:08:09.500
From Mesolithic hunters who crossed
the land bridge from Scotland

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:12.690 position:56%
to Ireland to the Eastern European's

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.610
who serviced the recent
Celtic Tiger economy,

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:21.660
each wave of newcomers brought
artistic and material goods,

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:27.250
languages, music and folkways
that mingled and merged

00:08:27.250 --> 00:08:32.060
to form Ireland's vibrant
mosaic of cultures.

00:08:32.060 --> 00:08:36.890
Guarding Ireland's main
river archery, the Shannon,

00:08:36.890 --> 00:08:41.170
Clare separates the barren
wilderness of the western province

00:08:41.170 --> 00:08:46.110
of Connacht from the rich farmlands
of Munster in the south of Ireland.

00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:52.480
Prolonged periods of geological
time conspired to surround Clare

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:58.970
on three sides by water and
insulated from its neighbors.

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:04.990
Its only land access is through
the mountains of Slieve Aughty

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:08.980
or across the [inaudible] of
the Burren where according

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:13.840
to one Cromwellian general, there
was not enough wood to hang a man,

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:17.510
enough water to drown a man,
or enough dirt to bury a man.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:20.100
[ Laughter ]

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:23.690
This is what the Burren
looks like today,

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:28.300
as it did when the
Cromwellian cynic visited.

00:09:28.300 --> 00:09:33.320
Indeed, human history in the
Burren predates the Cromwellians

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.830
by 6,000 years.

00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:41.080
Its first Neolithic farmers
arrived about 4000 BC.

00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:47.150 position:56%
And since then, human traffic in and
out of Clare has continued unabated.

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:53.960
Its 7,000 archaeological sites
contain Bronze Age tombs,

00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:00.520
Iron Age forts -- like this one
-- and early Christian churches.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:04.850
Clare also contains the
remains of Viking, Norman,

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:06.150
and [inaudible] settlers.

00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:11.060
This is a well-known landmark in
County Clare that I'm sure many

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:14.720
of you are familiar with,
Bunratty Castle, which was built

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:18.300
by the Norman Richard the Clare.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:22.500
Landlord estates, garrison
towns, chapel villages

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:28.100 position:56%
and railroads reshaped the geography
of Clare in more recent times,

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:32.150
as did famine, eviction,
and immigration.

00:10:32.150 --> 00:10:38.380
From a land perspective, Clare is
a remote, liminal place in the west

00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:42.430
of Ireland to where the
Celts supposedly retreated

00:10:42.430 --> 00:10:45.020
in the centuries before
the birth of Christ

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.370
after fighting a long
rearguard action

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.950
from the Alps to the Atlantic.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:54.960
Creative writers and social
scientists have been intrigued

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:58.260
by this liminality.

00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:01.250
In literary and socio-analytical
text,

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:05.340
Clare and its hinterlands are
designated sanctuaries of tradition

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:10.340
and authenticity, not to
mention back orders of madness,

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:13.930
repression, and social enemy.

00:11:13.930 --> 00:11:16.310
A maritime compass, however,

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:20.350
presents a very different
perspective of this region.

00:11:20.350 --> 00:11:24.950 position:56%
Situated at the mouth of the
Shannon, Clare was in the slipstream

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:30.380
of ocean trade and migration
since early Christian times.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:34.030
The cults of its early
Christian saints, for example,

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:38.930
can be found in Scotland,
Wales, Cornwall, and Brittany.

00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:43.810
In the wake of the voyages of
discovery, Ireland, which was once

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:48.340
on the edge of the known world
now found itself near the center

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:50.210
of the New World.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.440
During this extended age of
sale, coastal communities

00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:00.060
on Clare's Erris Peninsula provided
river pilots for toll ships going

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:04.050
up the river Shannon to Limerick,
which was a last port of call

00:12:04.050 --> 00:12:06.840
for fleets crossing
the North Atlantic.

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.870
Before the arrival of railroads
in the mid-19th century,

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:15.420
a network of satellite ports
dotted Clare's fractal coast

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.510
from Lough Derg on the Shannon to
Lukead [phonetic] on the Atlantic

00:12:19.510 --> 00:12:22.950
and North towards Galway Bay.

00:12:22.950 --> 00:12:29.030
Like this Port of Kilrush, which is
on the mouth of the river Shannon,

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:33.730
they all shared some sense
of clans' local engagement

00:12:33.730 --> 00:12:35.730
with the outside world.

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:38.350
[Inaudible] culture
currents reached Clare

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:45.510
from rather unlikely destinations
in the past two millennia.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:49.790
Coptic stonework, for example,
similar to carvings found

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:51.930
in the lower reaches
of the river Nile,

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.270
survives in early Christian
churches in the Burren

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.560
in the Aran islands,
it's geological annex.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:01.900
Here, for example, you
see one of these crosses

00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.950
in the village of Kilfenora.

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.930
And I'd like to direct
your attention

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:09.890
to the second panel
beneath the bishop.

00:13:09.890 --> 00:13:14.830
And if you look at the figure on
the right-hand side of the screen,

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:19.120
you will notice the flat,
Coptic Egyptian cross.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:24.310
This is a rare example of
stone masonry that traveled

00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:27.960
from the lower reaches of the
Nile across the Mediterranean,

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:35.850
out through the point of Gibraltar
and around Spain, traveling north

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.170
into the western part of Ireland

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:42.830
where these stonemasons
created Coptic artifacts.

00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:50.670
During the 12th and 13th centuries,

00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:56.210
avant-garde European scholasticism
found eager patrons in Clare

00:13:56.210 --> 00:14:03.180 position:56%
when the old Gaelic world synergized
by a new European age of faith.

00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:07.800
Here, for example, is the
Franciscan Friary in Ennis

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:14.490 position:56%
in County Clare dating from the
mid-13th century, and again evidence

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:18.980
of European migration
to the west of Ireland.

00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:23.930
The arrival of mendicant orders,
particularly the Augustinians,

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:29.750
the Franciscans, the Dominicans,
changed Irish Christianity

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:33.520
and linking it with
a new renaissance

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:36.270
of European Christianity.

00:14:36.270 --> 00:14:40.050
Outward-bound currents,
too, were impressive.

00:14:40.050 --> 00:14:44.020
Clare [inaudible] families sent
their offspring to University

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.860
in Prague, Leuven, and
Paris during the Penal Era

00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:52.690
when its military exiles
fought imperial wars

00:14:52.690 --> 00:14:58.010
and explored New World colonies
from new Newfoundland to Brazil.

00:14:58.010 --> 00:15:04.020
Nowhere is the imprint of global
culture flows more pronounced,

00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:07.930
however, then in Clare's
traditional soundscape.

00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:11.060
That has been a site
of cultural convergence

00:15:11.060 --> 00:15:14.330
and coalescence for centuries.

00:15:14.330 --> 00:15:17.530
Music, irrespective of genre,

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:22.200
is a nomadic art whose
journeys are frequently lost

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:26.260
in what French historian
Jacques Le Goff called the

00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:30.550
"indefinable residue of
historical analyses."

00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:36.870
The transcultural odyssey of the
Arabic guitar, the African banjo,

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:42.100
and European Baroque dancing all
bear witness to this phenomenon.

00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:45.960
In contrast to the architects
of the Celtic twilight

00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.970
in the late 19th century who saw
the west of Ireland as a place

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:56.500
of timeless, romantic authenticity,
Clare musicians have a long history

00:15:56.500 --> 00:16:00.390
of moving beyond the
injunctions of the past.

00:16:00.390 --> 00:16:03.930
By the end of the 18th
century, the Italian violin --

00:16:03.930 --> 00:16:07.410
which we see here in
the case beside us --

00:16:07.410 --> 00:16:11.690
had reached Clare and was
notarized and nativized

00:16:11.690 --> 00:16:14.320
as the Irish fiddle,
[speaking Gaelic].

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:19.960
Baroque flutes and fifes
were also nativized.

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.610
In the half-century
after the great famine,

00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:25.670
the region welcomed
German concertinas --

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:29.350
which you'll hear at the
end of this performance --

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:35.560 position:56%
Sicilian coral societies and British
and German style brass bands,

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.580
American Victrolas in
jazz, Italian accordions,

00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:43.500
and Balkan bouzoukis all
arrived during the next century,

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.720
ferried in by trains,
planes, and automobiles.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:55.530
Clare's bricolage of Irish tunes
today contains Scottish reels,

00:16:55.530 --> 00:17:00.990
French galops, Bavarian marches,
and North Hungarian horn pipes,

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:05.170
while its set dancers
trace their ancestry

00:17:05.170 --> 00:17:09.860
to the choreographers
of [inaudible] France.

00:17:09.860 --> 00:17:15.110
Despite their so-called geographic
isolation on the outer edge

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:19.640
of Europe, Clare music makers
have released an impressive corpus

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:25.940
of tunes and songs into the
transcultural tide of world music.

00:17:25.940 --> 00:17:30.150
I've no doubt that many of you
are familiar with these figures.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:34.370
Master performers like Martin
Hayes, Michael Tubridy,

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:39.010
and Sharon Shannon are not just
local carriers of tradition.

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:43.320
These are the global
faces of Clare today.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:50.790 position:56%
Similarly, the Kilfenora Ceili Band,
the oldest dance band in Ireland,

00:17:50.790 --> 00:17:54.530
performs Clare's repertoire
in symphony halls

00:17:54.530 --> 00:17:57.850 position:56%
and folk festivals across the globe.

00:17:57.850 --> 00:18:02.460
In the market speak of Irish
cultural tourism, Clare,

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.020
for the music, is a
ubiquitous calling card

00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:10.370
that beckons tourists west
from Dublin to the festivals

00:18:10.370 --> 00:18:13.160
and singing pubs of Clare.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:18.220
Every summer, its towns and
villages become makeshift academies

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:23.000
of tradition, none more so than
Milltown Malbay and Doolin,

00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.820
Ireland's mecca of traditional
music, known to music pilgrims

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:32.330
and aficionados from Jura to
Japan, from the Austrian Alps

00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:35.370
to the Pampas of Argentina.

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:39.960
Today, traditional music
in Clare no longer lives

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:45.620
in little thatched cottages in
isolated places, nor does it travel

00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:49.720
by donkey and cart along
lonesome country roads.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:55.190
It is, in fact, a polyverse of
music communities whose voices are

00:18:55.190 --> 00:19:01.370
as vibrant in the music pubs of New
York, Washington, D.C., Montréal,

00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:04.900
Chicago, and San Francisco
as they are

00:19:04.900 --> 00:19:08.530
in the dance halls of
Kilfenora and Tulla.

00:19:08.530 --> 00:19:12.980
Focusing on the interplay
between history and memory,

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.240
which are not synonymous, by the
way, my book Flowing Tides --

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:22.970 position:56%
which is available today -- examines
the impact of global cultural flows

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:28.480
on Clare's so-called isolated
soundscape from the Napoleonic wars

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:35.810
to the Celtic Tiger boom in the
period from 1995 until 2005.

00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:43.390
It focuses ostensibly on musical
roots but also musical routes,

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:45.620
both in Clare and beyond,

00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:49.890
to a century of austere
British colonialism

00:19:49.890 --> 00:19:54.010
and an equally strained
century of post-colonialism,

00:19:54.010 --> 00:19:59.380
both of which exposed the region
to intense musical traffic.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:02.940
Allow me to take you
through very briefly some

00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:08.460 position:56%
of the key musical moments and what
they tell us about the local as well

00:20:08.460 --> 00:20:11.970
as the global music
history of the region.

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:17.210
Several key political and
economic events sourced

00:20:17.210 --> 00:20:19.750
in Clare during the 19th century

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:23.760
and that were felt
throughout the British Empire

00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.310 position:56%
and among Irish diasporic
communities throughout the world are

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:32.900
centered and located and
articulated initially

00:20:32.900 --> 00:20:37.600
in Clare before spreading outwards
throughout the island of Ireland

00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:41.820
and elsewhere throughout
the British Empire.

00:20:41.820 --> 00:20:47.470
For example, the election of
Catholic lawyer Daniel O'Connell

00:20:47.470 --> 00:20:52.200
to the British Parliament for
Clare in 1828 and the passing

00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:58.220
of Catholic emancipation a year
later changed the lives of millions

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:04.790
of Catholics not just in Ireland
but throughout the British Empire.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:08.060
Although the Penal Laws,
which delight denied civil

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:12.390
and religious rights to Catholics,
were now officially revoked,

00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:17.040
the long-term impact of
rapid population growth

00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:20.000 position:56%
and unsustainable economic practices

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.270
in Ireland proved ultimately
far more catastrophic.

00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:28.940
This was evident in Clare

00:21:28.940 --> 00:21:32.750
in the decades following
the Napoleonic wars.

00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:37.170
But its population
peaked as never before.

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:39.240
Remember today the population

00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:43.510
of Ireland is approximately
4 million people.

00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:50.660
In 1821, the population of
County Clare was 208,000.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:56.020
But it grew to 286,000 on the eve

00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.590
of the Great Famine,
which began in 1845.

00:22:00.590 --> 00:22:05.400
Clare, however, was
decimated by this catastrophe.

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.720
And I want to show you some images
that speak to that catastrophe.

00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:14.660
Unlike other famines and
particularly modern famines,

00:22:14.660 --> 00:22:16.600
the Great Irish Famine
-- which is was one

00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:22.580
of many famines throughout the
17th and 18th century and indeed

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:25.830
into the latter years
of the 19th century --

00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:29.600
the Great Famine was
not a pictorial famine.

00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.010
There were no photojournalists
like Steve Winick [phonetic] --

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.620
[ Laughter ]

00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:38.040
-- or any other major
photographic figure.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:43.670
The people who chronicled
the Great Irish Famine were

00:22:43.670 --> 00:22:46.080
government statisticians.

00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:52.030
Eventually, the London Illustrated
News sent illustrators to Ireland

00:22:52.030 --> 00:22:57.680
to document the famine, and here
we have an example of their work.

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:05.490
This is a deserted village in the
Erris Peninsula in Southwest Clare,

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:13.870
which was not simply deserted
by famine but was evicted

00:23:13.870 --> 00:23:19.900
by the local landlord for --
excuse me -- nonpayment of rent.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:23.230
What's interesting is that if
you travel throughout the west

00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:26.280
of Ireland you'll see many examples

00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:32.810
of village communities completely
abandoned leaving nothing

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:37.440
in their wake except the
foundations of their houses.

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.960
Here is another example perhaps
if I can use the expression,

00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:47.030
the poster child of the Great
Irish Famine, Brigit O'Donnell

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:54.450
and her children photographed
or drawn so to speak in 1849

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:59.430
by the illustrator from the
London Illustrated News.

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:05.400
The area of Clare and particularly
Southwest Clare topped the national

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:08.350 position:56%
grid in famine deaths and evictions.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:14.210
By 1851, its population
had fallen to 212,000.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:20.710
A century later, less than
100,000 people lived in Clare.

00:24:20.710 --> 00:24:26.270
By now, its voluntary exiles were
dispersed throughout the New World

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:31.130
in Canada, the United
States, Argentina, Australia,

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:33.540
New Zealand, and South Africa.

00:24:33.540 --> 00:24:40.210
An estimated 400,000 people left
Clare in the past two centuries.

00:24:40.210 --> 00:24:46.310
People of Clare extraction today
who live overseas outnumber those

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:52.610
who live in Clare by a
ratio of three to one.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:56.350
All of these events,
from the excitement

00:24:56.350 --> 00:25:00.030
of Napoleon Bonaparte's
battles and campaigns

00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:05.520
to Daniel O'Connell's electoral
victories, to the human tragedy

00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:11.380
of famine and diastral all
found a voice and a sonic memory

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:15.500
in the music, song, and
dance of County Clare.

00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:18.900
The long campaign to remove Ireland

00:25:18.900 --> 00:25:21.710
from the British Empire
had a critical impact

00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:24.050
on the lives of Clare people.

00:25:24.050 --> 00:25:27.820
From the Fenian movement -- which
you are very familiar with here

00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:32.490
in the United States -- and the
land war to the plan of campaign

00:25:32.490 --> 00:25:35.190
and the War of Independence.

00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:38.210
But this particular
photograph is interesting.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:41.780
Is a photograph from the
land war in County Clare.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:48.570 position:56%
And remember within a 30-year
window, now we have photojournalism.

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:54.080
Now we're familiar with
the sight and sounds

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:59.780
of cameras chronicling political
events, unlike the experience

00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.000
of the Great Famine which
was not a photographic event.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:09.050
And again, we're still
singing songs and ballads

00:26:09.050 --> 00:26:12.930
about the land war in County Clare.

00:26:12.930 --> 00:26:16.620
Ninety years after
electing Daniel O'Connell,

00:26:16.620 --> 00:26:21.610
Clare elected the American-born
Eamon de Valera to Parliament

00:26:21.610 --> 00:26:26.390
on a Sinn Fein ticket in 1917.

00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:32.540
Born in New York City of an Irish
mother and a Spanish father,

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:37.480
Eamon de Valera was a daunting
and enigmatic political figure.

00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:42.810
He dominated Irish life for most
of the 20th century as a national

00:26:42.810 --> 00:26:45.530
and international statesman
and an architect

00:26:45.530 --> 00:26:48.570
of social and cultural change.

00:26:48.570 --> 00:26:52.890
All of these symbolic events and
characters are remembered as much

00:26:52.890 --> 00:26:57.280
in music and song as
they are textual history.

00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:03.720 position:56%
Feigning separatism, and
19th-century politics are still sung

00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:10.580
about today in Clare and among
Clare exilic communities.

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:14.300
Likewise, the first and
second temperance movements,

00:27:14.300 --> 00:27:19.350
public processions led by
marching bands were popular rituals

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:22.540
of this anti-drink crusade.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:28.670
Fife and drum bands formed to rally
the faithful and to route the evil

00:27:28.670 --> 00:27:31.450 position:56%
of drink in rural and urban Ireland.

00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.750
Imagine that.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.350
These drum bands were
formed initially

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.470
to perform at religious events.

00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:48.840
But eventually they began to
arouse less devout congregations

00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:53.280
of Irish hurling matches
and football matches,

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:58.200
at land league rallies and trade
union meetings, eventually morphing

00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:00.560
into brass and reed bands.

00:28:00.560 --> 00:28:06.730
As funds improved, these ensembles
also spread musical literacy.

00:28:06.730 --> 00:28:12.810 position:56%
Like this particular brass and reed
band from Kilfenora in County Clare.

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:18.830 position:56%
And this band was a very active
musical ensemble until the Irish War

00:28:18.830 --> 00:28:23.500
of Independence when the blackened
towns, destroyed their instruments,

00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:28.040
in an act of social
and cultural reprisal.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:31.350
Some were trained by
British Army band masters

00:28:31.350 --> 00:28:35.390
who had sufficient peace time on
their hands between the Crimean

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:39.820
and the Second Boer War to make
a real artistic contribution

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.590
to her majesty's subjects.

00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:46.440
New instruments were also
introduced during this period,

00:28:46.440 --> 00:28:50.710
in particular the Anglo-German
concertino --

00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:54.800
which you'll hear in
a few moments --

00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:58.260
which became a sonic
insignia in Clare

00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.310
that brought musical
liberation, particularly to women

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:05.440
in a male-dominated world.

00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:09.180
Cultural nationalism
designed, brokered,

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:14.450
and delivered by the Gaelic league
was a potent mobilizing agent

00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:18.860
in late 19th century Ireland,
especially its rhetoric

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:22.470
of linguistic pride,
grassroots activism,

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:26.610
and competitive music making
that spread systemically

00:29:26.610 --> 00:29:30.230
from metropolitan areas like
Dublin, Cork and Limerick

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:34.630
out into the rural
peripheries of Ireland.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:39.750
This ideoscape reached its apogee
in Clare and in other parts

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:44.370
of the country with the
Rebellion of 1916 and the War

00:29:44.370 --> 00:29:48.510
of Independence that
followed in 1919.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:54.490
Caught in a vortex of chaos
and terror, musicians, too,

00:29:54.490 --> 00:29:57.480
fell victim to the
atrocities of war.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.620
Especially the Black
and Tans which were

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:03.550
who were irregular British
troops sent to Ireland

00:30:03.550 --> 00:30:08.200
to reinforce the Royal
Irish Constabulary police.

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:13.550
During these turbulent times,
house dances were rated,

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:17.200
instruments were destroyed --
as in the case of this band --

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:19.920
and musicians were
forced to immigrate

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.570
to escape political violence.

00:30:22.570 --> 00:30:26.300
In the wake of the Anglo-Irish
Treaty and Civil War,

00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:31.340
the fledgling Irish Free
State proved rather powerless

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:37.630
to hold back the rising tide of
the roaring '20s from America.

00:30:37.630 --> 00:30:42.020
That flowed without end,
it seemed, into Ireland,

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:46.510
particularly in the form of
jazz and its attendant sins.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:49.350
[ Laughter ]

00:30:49.350 --> 00:30:56.200
Here is an example of an Irish
jazz band, which came to prominence

00:30:56.200 --> 00:31:02.290
in the 1920s and '30s, taking
their cues from similar kinds

00:31:02.290 --> 00:31:08.300
of jazz bands that were active
throughout the United States.

00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:16.340 position:56%
Ireland's moral response to jazz was
to pass a draconian Dance Halls Act

00:31:16.340 --> 00:31:22.750
in 1935 which radically altered
the musical life of the nation.

00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:26.210
By the time World War
II began in 1939

00:31:26.210 --> 00:31:30.280
and the Irish Free State
declared itself neutral,

00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:36.290
Ireland's audiences had already
developed a taste for Hollywood

00:31:36.290 --> 00:31:41.460
and indeed modern as
well as ceili dancing.

00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:48.280
Now you will notice that in both of
these prints, this is a ceili band

00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:53.050
from County Clare an early
example of a ceili ensemble.

00:31:53.050 --> 00:31:56.990
But you'll notice that the
fiddle player just to the right

00:31:56.990 --> 00:32:00.740
of the piano is, in
fact, the banjo player

00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.290
at the center of the jazz band.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:09.170
So they're going back and
forth between two traditions.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:12.000
The countryside in
Clare and in other areas

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:16.200
of Ireland was now dotted with
small cinemas and dance halls.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:19.980
Most of them managed by the
priest, the Catholic priest,

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.790
who brokered moral
agendas, vetted movies,

00:32:23.790 --> 00:32:27.710
formed ceili bands,
and paid the musicians.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:31.440
If the Emergency -- which
was the official title

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:34.240
for the World War II
period in Ireland.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.370
Ireland, because it was neutral,
never referred to it publicly

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:43.210
at least in the press the war.

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:47.280
It was always referred to by
the rather euphemistic term

00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:52.080
in our Irish parlance
as The Emergency,

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:58.470
which lasted between 1939 and 1945.

00:32:58.470 --> 00:33:01.220
So the Emergency, which
was the official term,

00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:04.290
seamed the country off
from the outside world.

00:33:04.290 --> 00:33:08.700
And indeed, the depression
that followed failed

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:13.330
to stem the tide of freeing exiles.

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:18.980
This flight of people sparked a
crisis that entered the psyche

00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:22.650
of the nation as the hungry '40s.

00:33:22.650 --> 00:33:26.990
Now I'd like to show
you a photograph taken

00:33:26.990 --> 00:33:31.580
by the famous American
photographer Dorothea Lange,

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:33.890
who most of you Americans will know

00:33:33.890 --> 00:33:38.490
for her work chronicling the Great
Depression and the internment

00:33:38.490 --> 00:33:41.090
of Japanese communities, etc.,

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:46.440
etc. And these two ladies were
photographed in County Clare

00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:51.380
in the fall of 1954,
and they're just

00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:54.060
about to leave Ireland for America.

00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:59.010
The immigration of young women,
particularly from rural areas,

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:02.040
is very significant
because for the most part,

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:05.140
women did not inherit land.

00:34:05.140 --> 00:34:11.230
And so they became the
diasporic members of the family,

00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:15.540
as in the case of these two women
the O'Hallaren [phonetic] sisters

00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:18.540
from Mount Callan in County Clare.

00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:23.640
These dull, sepia-toned
years saw hundreds

00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:30.200 position:56%
of Clare musicians fall victim to
anti-jazz crusades, priestly purges,

00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:35.070
and indeed forced exile to
quote/unquote heathen England --

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.130
[ Laughter ]

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:38.780
-- and America.

00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:44.110
If Clare was on the periphery
of Irish economic life

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:48.480
in the early decades of Irish
independence, that isolation came

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:56.250
to an end on the 24th of October
1945 when Captain Charles Blair --

00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:00.660
who most of you will know is the
husband of actress Marine O'Hara --

00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.200
piles at the first
commercial flight from New York

00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:07.240
to Shannon in a four engine DC-4.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.270
For the next four decades,
Shannon County Clare,

00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:14.080
the most westerly international
Airport in Europe --

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:17.200
although I suppose the
Portuguese would dispute that --

00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:21.980
was a gateway for traffic
crossing the Atlantic.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:27.050
It also became the world's
first duty-free zone and a hub

00:35:27.050 --> 00:35:29.950
of international industrial
development,

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:34.970
all of which changed perceived
notions of centers of peripheries

00:35:34.970 --> 00:35:38.900
in Clare and its west
of Ireland hinterland.

00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:42.640
From now on, America had
moved closer to the social

00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:44.910
and cultural life of the region.

00:35:44.910 --> 00:35:49.090
As American aircrews were ferried
back and forth to local hotels

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:54.550
to rest between flights and
indeed relatives took vacations

00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:55.850
to the Old Country.

00:35:55.850 --> 00:36:01.810
In the 1960s, Shannon was
Clare's horn of plenty,

00:36:01.810 --> 00:36:04.590
a site of paid factory work,

00:36:04.590 --> 00:36:08.420
a place where material progress
was possible close to home

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:11.010
without the burden of immigration.

00:36:11.010 --> 00:36:14.520
And indeed, if industrialization
lifted the region

00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.730
out of agrarian dependency,

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:20.990
it did not make it
impervious to economic change.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:25.110
In the past half-century,
Shannon has experienced good

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:30.110
and bad economic times, the latter
which brought prolonged periods

00:36:30.110 --> 00:36:32.930
of unemployment and immigration.

00:36:32.930 --> 00:36:37.400
Ennis, Clare's County town,
followed a similar although less

00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.540
intensive trajectory.

00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:44.560
Traditionally a farmers' town that
hosted historic fairs and markets,

00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:48.640
Ennis acquired light industry
after Irish independence.

00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:53.270 position:56%
And attempting to follow Shannon's
lead it expanded its industrial base

00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:54.760
in the 1960s.

00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:00.430
However, it really became an
international town in the 1990s

00:37:00.430 --> 00:37:05.700
when it became Ireland's
first Information Age town,

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:10.110
a town in which every home
was connected to the Internet

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:14.310
and every child became
computer literate.

00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:22.710
Clare's cultural life also
responded to these postwar changes.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:26.180
Brokered by Northern
piper Sean Reid --

00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:30.620
who you see here in the back
row second from the right --

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.950
Reid and his cohorts
at [speaking Irish]

00:37:32.950 --> 00:37:36.340
which is Ireland's
music Association --

00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:41.810
you also have a branch of that
organization here in the area

00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:44.440
of Washington, D.C. Baltimore.

00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:47.560
And I should remind
you that [inaudible]

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:53.430
in Bethesda is hosting its
annual Mad Week next week,

00:37:53.430 --> 00:37:55.460
which is music and dance week.

00:37:55.460 --> 00:38:00.360
And please take home some
information from outside.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:05.110
And if you're free, it's
a wonderful way to engage

00:38:05.110 --> 00:38:10.260
in what we call some wonderfully
constructive musical enjoyment

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:12.510
and laziness.

00:38:12.510 --> 00:38:15.700
All constructive, of course.

00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.570
But back to Clare.

00:38:17.570 --> 00:38:24.680
In 1954 [speaking Irish]
came together in County Clare

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.700
and they campaigned to bring
the All-Ireland Flack Hill Music

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:30.240
Festival to the region.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.910
This is the World's
Fair of Irish music.

00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:38.150
And indeed, they made
that happen in 1956.

00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:41.920
Now, it will convene for the
fourth time in Ennis next month.

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:45.480
So if you're in Ireland
between August 14th to 21st,

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:48.100
you should not miss this event.

00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:51.890
Now Reid was a very
interesting gentleman.

00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:55.690
He was what I describe
as a Renaissance man,

00:38:55.690 --> 00:39:00.590
interested in classical music,
jazz, philosophy, and athletics.

00:39:00.590 --> 00:39:04.510
He came to County Clare to work
as a civil engineer in the 1930s

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:08.850
and he broke all the rules
of social engagement.

00:39:08.850 --> 00:39:12.890
He did not stay and associate
with members of his own class.

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:18.260
He sought out the plebs, the people
who played traditional music,

00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:22.180
sang songs, and engaged
in traditional dancing,

00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:29.670 position:56%
which was not kosher among bourgeois
society in Ireland in the 1940s.

00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:34.910
So Reid stepped away from that
bourgeois small-town world

00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:39.970
and became a cultural
revolutionary in every sense.

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:46.810
He campaigned vigorously to bring
the All-Ireland Music Festival

00:39:46.810 --> 00:39:49.040
to the region and succeeded.

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:53.910 position:56%
Now this new forum attracted musical
exiles from Britain and America,

00:39:53.910 --> 00:39:56.890
and it marked a turning point
when traditional musicians

00:39:56.890 --> 00:40:00.810
for the first time
claimed urban space.

00:40:00.810 --> 00:40:04.860
This kind of music was a
traditional rural form of music

00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.740
that you would not usually find

00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.880
in metropolitan Dublin
or Limerick or Cork.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:16.990 position:56%
And finally, with the arrival of
the music festival, the feile ceoil,

00:40:16.990 --> 00:40:22.480
people came to perform
music in urban spaces.

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:26.540
A model of civic engagement,
tourism, and business enterprise,

00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:32.630
the 1956 festival in Ennis was also
a site of visceral public discourse

00:40:32.630 --> 00:40:35.430
on Irish musical authenticity.

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:40.890
Not least the issue of whether
set dancing was actually Irish.

00:40:40.890 --> 00:40:42.580
Was it authentic?

00:40:42.580 --> 00:40:44.420
Most people didn't think so.

00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:48.250
In fact, people saw it
as a foreign abomination.

00:40:48.250 --> 00:40:52.620
The people who belonged to the
Gaelic League especially saw it

00:40:52.620 --> 00:41:00.030 position:56%
as something quote/unquote that came
to Ireland with Cromwell's dragoons.

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.550
What an awful legacy.

00:41:02.550 --> 00:41:07.580
And, in fact, it took most of four
decades for traditional set dancing

00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:14.540
to purge itself of this
strange, European historiography.

00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.920
Indeed, the feile itself was
an acoustic lieu de memoire

00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:23.830
of par excellence, thanks to the
great Robbie McMahon [phonetic],

00:41:23.830 --> 00:41:27.120
a ballot maker who
immortalized it in song.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:32.630
The feile down in Ennis in
1956 is still remembered today

00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:36.360
as a rare Nirvana of
traditional song,

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:42.190
particularly because of
its initial excitement.

00:41:42.190 --> 00:41:45.790
This was Clare's Woodstock,
if you will.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:51.290
And even last year you see
here one of the two ceili bands

00:41:51.290 --> 00:41:55.670 position:56%
that traveled to Ireland from Japan.

00:41:55.670 --> 00:42:00.650
Twenty ensembles like this
competing for the world title

00:42:00.650 --> 00:42:04.170
of Irish ceili band music.

00:42:04.170 --> 00:42:05.850
A six hour marathon.

00:42:05.850 --> 00:42:08.010
Not for the weak of heart.

00:42:08.010 --> 00:42:09.710
[ Laughter ]

00:42:09.710 --> 00:42:13.190
And if you're in Ireland
again, as I say, in August,

00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:18.380
you will probably get to
hear the Toyota ceili band

00:42:18.380 --> 00:42:21.460
who won a standing
ovation from the crowd.

00:42:21.460 --> 00:42:25.030
They did not win the
title, by the way,

00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:26.930
but they certainly
changed the feile.

00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:32.460
Ireland's traditional
soundscape experienced accelerated

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.560
commodification between the 1960s

00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:38.710
until the Celtic Tiger
boom in the 1990s.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:43.630
If this new departure was linked
to tourism, regional development,

00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:45.670
and new professional opportunities,

00:42:45.670 --> 00:42:53.110
it also fueled an increasing
excitement among young people

00:42:53.110 --> 00:42:56.530
who for the first time choose
to learn traditional music

00:42:56.530 --> 00:43:00.250
in formal educational settings.

00:43:00.250 --> 00:43:04.130
Intercultural organization
of the music of Clare shifted

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:10.640
in the 1960s away from rural
kitchens and country settings

00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:14.290
into formal school rooms.

00:43:14.290 --> 00:43:20.900 position:56%
Where we had a tradition of informal
classes, now the music became part

00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:23.300
of the school curriculum.

00:43:23.300 --> 00:43:26.650
In the same way as a
child going to school

00:43:26.650 --> 00:43:31.720
in Ireland could learn Gaelic,
they also now had the opportunity

00:43:31.720 --> 00:43:33.790
to learn traditional music.

00:43:33.790 --> 00:43:35.680
One of the key architects

00:43:35.680 --> 00:43:41.480
of this pedagogical revolution
was Frank Custy who began teaching

00:43:41.480 --> 00:43:44.990
in the small hamlet
of Tulla in 1963.

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:48.580 position:56%
In a sense, taught music to hundreds

00:43:48.580 --> 00:43:52.580
of young people for
most of 50 years.

00:43:52.580 --> 00:43:57.250 position:56%
Many of his students, among them
Sharon Shannon and James [inaudible]

00:43:57.250 --> 00:44:02.260
and went on to become superstars
of the Celtic music industry.

00:44:02.260 --> 00:44:07.220
When the manufacturing industries
have come and gone from Clare,

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:12.580
tourism has long been its
economic and cultural elixir.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:16.750
In the early 19th century,
steamboats transported day trippers

00:44:16.750 --> 00:44:22.460
from Shannon down the river to
Kilrush and Kilkee from Limerick.

00:44:22.460 --> 00:44:28.200 position:56%
While Bianconi coaches made overland
trips for those willing to put

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:32.230
up with the discomfort of
bad roads and poor lodgings.

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:36.020
However, the completion from
Ennis to Limerick of the Railway

00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:41.000
in 1859 brought new traffic
along the River Fergus valley.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.820
And eventually, Clare's famous
railroad, the West Clare Railway --

00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:51.500
it was always late, at least
according to Percy French --

00:44:51.500 --> 00:44:56.290
in the 1880s finally opened
up access to the coast.

00:44:56.290 --> 00:45:00.840 position:56%
Victorian tourists, however, were
very different from the mass tourism

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.690
that developed in Clare
after World War II.

00:45:04.690 --> 00:45:08.710
Victorian tourists were
aristocrats, professional families,

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:12.030
who frequented the seaside
resorts in Kilkee and Spanish Point

00:45:12.030 --> 00:45:16.300
and Lahinch or indeed they
went to take the sulfur baths

00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:21.420
in Lisdoonvarna at holiday in
expensive lodges and hotels

00:45:21.420 --> 00:45:27.790
that were accessible only to
the rich and the well-endowed.

00:45:27.790 --> 00:45:30.410
In contrast, the development
of Shannon

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:34.360
in the 1950s opens the
floodgates to cheap holidays

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:38.740
for returning immigrants, and
particularly Irish Americans,

00:45:38.740 --> 00:45:42.580
many of whom made a
once-in-a-lifetime trip home,

00:45:42.580 --> 00:45:46.670
particularly after seeing
John Wayne and Maureen O'Hara

00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:50.370
in that famous movie in the 1950s.

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:54.960
If mass tourism created seasonal
and full-time jobs in the transport

00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:59.640
and service industry, it
also fueled a huge surge

00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.330
in the heritage industry.

00:46:02.330 --> 00:46:06.210
So we began packaging
tradition and artifacts

00:46:06.210 --> 00:46:09.320
from medieval castles
to folk villages.

00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.440
And indeed, the people
who packaged Clare

00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.860
for tourist consumption
walked a very fine line

00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:19.780
between preserving the past
and embracing the future.

00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:24.490
Yes, they capitalized on movie
and postcard images of Ireland

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:27.900
and they capitalized on
the marketing synergies

00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.460
of airline and vacation companies.

00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:33.520
And indeed by the 1970s
Clare tourism kicked

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:38.690
into high gear offering medieval
banquets, music festivals,

00:46:38.690 --> 00:46:42.810
golfing holidays, river
cruises and luxury tours

00:46:42.810 --> 00:46:46.690 position:56%
through Clare's unspoiled heartland.

00:46:46.690 --> 00:46:52.030
Positioning itself as a homely and
a pastoral antidote to the speed

00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:55.780
and the stress of the 21st
century, Clare continues

00:46:55.780 --> 00:47:00.840
to market its history, its cultural
capital and its exotic landscape.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:04.240
Ironically, the products
and the vistas

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:08.420
that are packaged today are
largely the same as those

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:12.690
that first enticed Victorian
tourists to the region a century

00:47:12.690 --> 00:47:16.420
and a half ago: the
Crescent Strand in Kilkee,

00:47:16.420 --> 00:47:19.940
the Spa Wells in Lisdoonvarna,
the archaeological wonders

00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:24.520
of the Byrne -- which you've seen
-- and of course Clare's icon,

00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:26.550
the Cliffs of Moher, the latter

00:47:26.550 --> 00:47:30.930
of which attracted a million
visitors a year during the height

00:47:30.930 --> 00:47:35.170
of the Celtic Tiger boom.

00:47:35.170 --> 00:47:38.740
Now not all cultural heritage
however fared as well as that

00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:40.720
which was packaged for tourists.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:44.190
Juxtapositioned with the
rise of industrial tourism

00:47:44.190 --> 00:47:47.310
in Clare was an equally
precipitous decline

00:47:47.310 --> 00:47:49.880 position:56%
in the Irish language in the region.

00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:54.770
In the early 19th century, most
of Clare was Irish-speaking.

00:47:54.770 --> 00:47:58.540
Throughout the 18th century,
English was confined mainly

00:47:58.540 --> 00:48:03.010
to colonial bureaucrats, the
courts, and the Protestant church.

00:48:03.010 --> 00:48:06.050
It made progress outside of
the rural areas by the end

00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:09.600
of the century as a result
of newspapers, commerce,

00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:13.960
and indeed British soldiers
billeted in garrison towns.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.370
The primary conduit of English in
19th century Clare and other parts

00:48:18.370 --> 00:48:22.250
of Ireland were what we call the
national schools that were set

00:48:22.250 --> 00:48:25.620
up throughout Ireland
thanks to Lord Stanley

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:29.700
who passed an educational
bill in the 1830s.

00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.610
That's the same Lord
Stanley who many

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.200
of you hockey fans
appreciate so much.

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:36.390
[ Laughter ]

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:42.290 position:56%
Designed to educate
quote/unquote good English children.

00:48:42.290 --> 00:48:43.700
I'll say that again.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:47.610
Designed to educate
good English children,

00:48:47.610 --> 00:48:49.900
these national schools
became bedrocks

00:48:49.900 --> 00:48:53.440 position:56%
of education in most Irish villages.

00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:57.050
They discouraged the use
of Irish in the classroom

00:48:57.050 --> 00:49:02.510
and they had a tally stick which
child wore around his or her neck.

00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:07.440
And the tally stick was designed
so that your parents were required

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:12.110
to put a little notch on the stick
every time you spoke Irish at home.

00:49:12.110 --> 00:49:15.930 position:56%
And when you showed up at school the
following day, you were punished.

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:20.570
Now this story was told
to me by this gentleman

00:49:20.570 --> 00:49:23.160
when I was about my son's age.

00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:25.200
And his name was Anraoi de Blaca.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:28.390
He was one of the last of
the Gaelic speakers of Clare.

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:37.500 position:56%
And tragically, in my lifetime, I've
lived through the actual decline

00:49:37.500 --> 00:49:40.250
of the Gaelic language,
the oldest spoken language

00:49:40.250 --> 00:49:43.190
in Western Europe, in
my particular region.

00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:45.920
However, north and south of Clare,

00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:50.550
Irish is still very much
a successful vernacular

00:49:50.550 --> 00:49:56.560
and very much part of the
Irish cultural mainframe.

00:49:56.560 --> 00:50:02.330
Clare's recent Irish-speaking past,
while inaccessible and invisible

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:06.720
to most tourists and non-natives,
had a very profound impact

00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:09.140
on its music and folk life.

00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:13.790
Clare musicians, people like Willie
Clancy, Chris Droni [phonetic],

00:50:13.790 --> 00:50:17.940
were all first-generation
English language speakers.

00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:24.190 position:56%
They grew up in a bicultural world
shaped by a Gaelic past that endured

00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:27.850
for centuries on modern
times that emerged

00:50:27.850 --> 00:50:31.230
from the colonial ashes
of World War I.

00:50:31.230 --> 00:50:36.280
Their speech, syntax, and their
wits reflected an older world

00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:39.210
of poets and characters.

00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:44.950
And their collective psyche really
sat uncomfortably beside the

00:50:44.950 --> 00:50:48.980
progressive crust of
the 20th century.

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:54.240
Now new media and new
audiences reshaped Clare music

00:50:54.240 --> 00:50:57.090
since Ireland joined the
European Economic Community,

00:50:57.090 --> 00:51:01.310
which you know today
as the EU, in 1973.

00:51:01.310 --> 00:51:05.820
Less preoccupied with jaded
notions of authenticity,

00:51:05.820 --> 00:51:11.420
young audiences reshuffled older
definitions of Irish music,

00:51:11.420 --> 00:51:15.610
moving it away in a sense from
its former ethnic moorings

00:51:15.610 --> 00:51:17.960
into mainstream culture.

00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:21.600
Countercultural and transcultural
elements were also scooped

00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:27.950
up in this trajectory, particularly
in the village of Doolin,

00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:31.210
which I'm sure many of you know.

00:51:31.210 --> 00:51:33.720
In Clare, the village of
Doolin and the small town

00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:37.580
of Milltown Mel Bay became nodal
points in this transformation.

00:51:37.580 --> 00:51:43.740
Now 40 years later, Doolin is a
paradoxical musical sanctuary.

00:51:43.740 --> 00:51:48.900
In a sense, it's a postmodern
simulacrum of its former self

00:51:48.900 --> 00:51:52.400
where today the people who came

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:58.790
and settled I Doolin
radically outnumber the natives

00:51:58.790 --> 00:52:00.180
of the village.

00:52:00.180 --> 00:52:08.110
So the pilgrims now outnumber those
they came to worship and honor.

00:52:08.110 --> 00:52:12.940
What's interesting is that Doolin
has become highly commodified,

00:52:12.940 --> 00:52:17.200
as you can see, with the
confusion at the crossroads.

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.380
Whereas Milltown Mel Bay, on the
other hand, which is the site

00:52:20.380 --> 00:52:23.880
of Ireland's largest summer
school has avoided the paradox

00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.950
of its northern neighbors.

00:52:25.950 --> 00:52:31.420
Now we're running a little short of
time, but I did have a clip from,

00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:35.770
believe it or not,
Central China Television,

00:52:35.770 --> 00:52:40.290
which is a multilingual television
service coming out of China.

00:52:40.290 --> 00:52:43.890
A number of years ago,
they sent a team to record

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:47.630 position:56%
at the Willie Clancy Summer School,
which was just finished, by the way.

00:52:47.630 --> 00:52:49.870
It was on last week.

00:52:49.870 --> 00:52:54.380
And what they were quite intrigued
by coming from China to experience

00:52:54.380 --> 00:52:58.430
in Irish cultural revolution, they
were quite intrigued by the number

00:52:58.430 --> 00:53:02.000
of non-Irish people
who came to participate

00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.070
in this great gathering
of musicians.

00:53:05.070 --> 00:53:08.440
And in the clip -- which we
won't have time for formally

00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:15.360
but I'll be glad to show to you
on my smaller laptop at the end

00:53:15.360 --> 00:53:19.570
of the talk -- they speak
with Russian dancers,

00:53:19.570 --> 00:53:22.050
they speak with Malaysian
flute players,

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:25.720
they speak with Argentinian
pipers and Cuban pipers,

00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:31.350
and hundreds of people from
all over the world who are now,

00:53:31.350 --> 00:53:34.450
if I can use the expression,
prosthetically inducted

00:53:34.450 --> 00:53:36.860
into the world of Irish music.

00:53:36.860 --> 00:53:41.130
They are more Irish than the
Irish themselves in many respects.

00:53:41.130 --> 00:53:45.590
We speak about the Normans who
came to Ireland in the 13th

00:53:45.590 --> 00:53:50.590
and 14th centuries becoming more
Irish than the Irish themselves.

00:53:50.590 --> 00:53:51.980
They stopped speaking French.

00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:54.180
I love saying this in
Québec to my students.

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.350
[ Laughter ]

00:53:56.350 --> 00:54:00.540
They stopped speaking French
so that they can know, learn,

00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:04.180
and speak Irish and
become Gaelic poets.

00:54:04.180 --> 00:54:05.480
And this is the kind

00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:09.650
of transformation we've had
throughout late medieval Ireland.

00:54:09.650 --> 00:54:12.960
And I think it's intriguing
that what's happening today

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:17.700
in the Irish world soundscape
is that throughout the world,

00:54:17.700 --> 00:54:21.900
not just in the United States
or Canada, but in South America,

00:54:21.900 --> 00:54:27.220
Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe,
Alaska, places along the edges

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:30.660
of Western civilization -- if
I can use that expression --

00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:36.670
are now becoming inducted and
becoming excited about Irish music

00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:41.780
and dance; and in fact becoming
master performers of that genre,

00:54:41.780 --> 00:54:45.590
which is truly intriguing and very,

00:54:45.590 --> 00:54:50.080
very complementary
to Irish performers.

00:54:51.210 --> 00:54:55.870
The economic boom during the
Celtic Tiger years from 1995

00:54:55.870 --> 00:55:00.710
until 2005 also transformed
Clare's soundscape.

00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:03.940
And indeed, music became a
key element in the branding

00:55:03.940 --> 00:55:06.710
and the commodification
of the region,

00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:10.330
particularly by tourism
managers, bar owners,

00:55:10.330 --> 00:55:13.070
and other culture entrepreneurs.

00:55:13.070 --> 00:55:16.960
That a term we've become
very used to in our Ireland,

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:19.580
cultural entrepreneurship.

00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:24.620
And music is a key
asset in that process.

00:55:24.620 --> 00:55:28.610
A time of new trends,
creative alliances,

00:55:28.610 --> 00:55:30.940
and conspicuous consumption.

00:55:30.940 --> 00:55:35.780
Cultural production in the Celtic
Tiger years spawned a whole new

00:55:35.780 --> 00:55:40.170
generation of Clare superstars
and Clare super groups.

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:44.380
People like Sharon Shannon,
Martin Hayes, and Maura O'Connell,

00:55:44.380 --> 00:55:48.440
and indeed the Kilfenora ceili
band, who I like to describe

00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:52.920
as the avant-garde ceili
band of Celtic Tiger Ireland.

00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:56.950
They graduated from the village
hall to the national concert hall

00:55:56.950 --> 00:56:00.240
and indeed the International
Folk Festival.

00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.310
The [speaking Irish], the
Irish Music Association,

00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:08.250
was also synergized during
these opportunistic times,

00:56:08.250 --> 00:56:11.100
sometimes challenging
the onslaught of change

00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:16.770
and indeed more times quite
powerless to alter its trajectory.

00:56:16.770 --> 00:56:22.410
Internet sociology and indeed new
cultural flows also reconfigured

00:56:22.410 --> 00:56:25.970
Clare music particularly
outside of Clare.

00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:30.710
In the process, another
musical Clare emerged,

00:56:30.710 --> 00:56:33.910
one that was virtual on vicarious.

00:56:33.910 --> 00:56:37.970
If cultured tourism filled
the region with European

00:56:37.970 --> 00:56:42.680
and American music tourists
in the 1970s and 1980s,

00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:48.620
by the end of the century it was
not uncommon to meet young Asian,

00:56:48.620 --> 00:56:52.340
particularly Japanese and Chinese
musicians, as well as Australians

00:56:52.340 --> 00:56:58.690
and South Americans, all performing
music from Clare in Clare,

00:56:58.690 --> 00:57:01.960
and bringing that music home
to their respective nations

00:57:01.960 --> 00:57:08.350 position:56%
and spreading the music quite
passionately among their own people.

00:57:08.350 --> 00:57:11.840
As I said, they were passionate
about the region and its music.

00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:17.650
These tourist performers,
vicarious Clare people of sorts,

00:57:17.650 --> 00:57:22.120
galvanized their new identities
in sessions and in summer camps --

00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.400
like Mad Week, which
is happening next week.

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:29.840
Please, if you're at all
interested come and enjoy.

00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:33.830
Now indeed there are dedicated
communities of Clare musicians

00:57:33.830 --> 00:57:41.330
in Paris, Buenos Aires, New York,
Tokyo, Washington, D.C. And indeed,

00:57:41.330 --> 00:57:45.650
few have any ethnic connection
to the region, yet they continue

00:57:45.650 --> 00:57:50.490
to redefine its soundscape
in absentia.

00:57:50.490 --> 00:57:55.340
While global culture flows
continue to create new topographies

00:57:55.340 --> 00:58:00.580
and new memories of Clare music,
they also mask deep crevices

00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:03.070
of musical forgetting and amnesia.

00:58:03.070 --> 00:58:08.270
And this, we're rather
reluctant to talk about in Clare,

00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:10.900
not least the cultural
fallout from the loss

00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:13.390 position:56%
of the Irish language in the region.

00:58:13.390 --> 00:58:18.200
While the region today basks in the
success and notoriety of its music,

00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:22.540
it seldom takes stock of the
musical losses of the past,

00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:27.220
not least the vast storehouse
of songs that disappeared

00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:32.520 position:56%
with the decline of the Irish
language, that once kept them alive.

00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:37.280
While cultural nationalists still
regard Irish traditional music is a

00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:45.520
sacred cow, a kind of lost Eden,
it is also an evolving ideoscape

00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:51.210 position:56%
where tensions between past and
present, remembering and forgetting,

00:58:51.210 --> 00:58:57.370
nationalism and revisionism collide
and rebound through various spheres

00:58:57.370 --> 00:58:59.970
of Irish cultural discourse.

00:58:59.970 --> 00:59:04.370
In this sense, players' traditional
soundscape is no different

00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:10.260
from any other soundscapes where
musicians are asked to preserve

00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:12.870
as well as perform tradition while

00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:17.150
at the same time carrying
it forward in time.

00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:23.370 position:56%
As mediators of tradition, musicians
are called upon to shape the destiny

00:59:23.370 --> 00:59:25.740
of their heritage in the world

00:59:25.740 --> 00:59:29.940
that is constantly
shifting beneath their feet.

00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:35.400
I have little doubt that this
creative and symbiotic tension

00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:39.990
between musical roots and
musical routes will continue

00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:44.470
to impact the soundscape
of Clare as it will

00:59:44.470 --> 00:59:49.360
in other traditional soundscapes
irrespective of where they are

00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.790
in our ever-changing world.

00:59:51.790 --> 00:59:53.590
Thank you.

00:59:53.590 --> 01:00:08.740
[ Applause ]

01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:10.820
Now you didn't get an
opportunity to hear the music

01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:14.450
from Central China Television,
so I thought I would leave you

01:00:14.450 --> 01:00:16.380
with some of the music live.

01:00:16.380 --> 01:00:22.050
The first short piece I'll
play for you is a [inaudible]

01:00:22.050 --> 01:00:28.870
for the musical immigrants who
left Ireland during the centuries

01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:31.260
since the Napoleonic wars.

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:37.800
It is particularly associated with
the western part of County Clare.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.630 position:56%
It's a tune called [speaking Irish].

01:00:39.630 --> 01:00:45.030
And I'll follow with a very short
jig, which we know in County Clare

01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:47.610
as the Green Fields of America.

01:00:47.610 --> 01:00:51.410
The Green Fields of America
is a very popular theme both

01:00:51.410 --> 01:00:54.880
in song and in dance music.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:58.390
American musicians are quite
familiar with the real version.

01:00:58.390 --> 01:01:03.510
I would leave you today with
the jig version reminding you

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:08.890
that this again speaks to that
universal theme of cultural flow

01:01:08.890 --> 01:01:14.190
and musical engagement that
travels and has sustained itself

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:18.470
so successfully over the centuries.

01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:20.860
So again [foreign language
spoken], thank you.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:22.760
And thank you sincerely.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.760 position:56%
Might I mention, before closing, all
of the wonderful people who I've met

01:01:27.760 --> 01:01:29.180
since arriving this morning.

01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.480
And I would particularly

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.110
like to thank my friend Dr.
Nancy Gross [assumed spelling]

01:01:33.110 --> 01:01:39.080
for her wonderful logistical
and professional coordination

01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:42.880
of this event during the past
six months since I was invited.

01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:45.510
And thank you all for
coming out this afternoon.

01:01:45.510 --> 01:04:47.500
[ Music ]

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:52.620
[ Applause ]

01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:53.920
Thank you.

01:04:53.920 --> 01:04:56.330
Thank you so much.

01:04:56.330 --> 01:04:59.200
Thank you.

01:04:59.200 --> 01:05:00.500
Thank you so much.

01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:01.800
Thank you.

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:04.490
