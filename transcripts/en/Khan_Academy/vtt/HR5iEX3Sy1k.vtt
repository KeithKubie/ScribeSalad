00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.327
- [Instructor] Get excited

00:00:01.327 --> 00:00:04.170
because in this video
we're going to talk about

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.600
one of the most important
laws in all of science.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.260
And that is the law of
conservation of energy.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.520
You'd be amazed by how
much of the universe

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.670
we can infer based on the law
of conservation of energy.

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.810
And you'll be amazed by
how many holes you can poke

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:22.330
in science fiction plots based on the law

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.210
of conservation of energy.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.270
Let's just start with the language

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.690
that you might typically see.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:30.494
And then we'll try to understand
it a little bit deeper.

00:00:30.494 --> 00:00:33.411
So it tells us that the total energy

00:00:33.411 --> 00:00:37.139
of an isolated system is constant.

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:40.457
Energy is neither created nor destroyed.

00:00:40.457 --> 00:00:45.050
It could only be transformed
from one form to another

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.810
or transferred from one system to another;

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.970
I pretty much underlined the whole thing

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.280
because it's so important.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.300
Now to understand this,
let's just think about

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.435
the types of energy that we have studied.

00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:59.706
We have studied things
like kinetic energy,

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:04.706
which is the energy due
to an object's motion.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.460
We have talked about potential energy,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.440
which you could view as energy
due to an object's position.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.310
And that would be the case of
mechanical potential energy.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.016
If you were to combine
these two types of energy,

00:01:19.016 --> 00:01:22.560
together, they're known
as mechanical energy.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.890
So let me put a little box around it.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.763
That is mechanical energy.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.550
And when you're first learning physics,

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.840
these are the types of
energies that we focus on.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.383
But there are other types of energy.

00:01:35.383 --> 00:01:37.160
There's thermal energy.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.900
You have nuclear energy.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.490
You have chemical energy.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.060
And so these aren't the only forms.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.587
So when we talk about the law
of conservation of energy,

00:01:45.587 --> 00:01:48.221
things like kinetic energy
could be transformed

00:01:48.221 --> 00:01:50.500
into chemical energy.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.882
But we're not gonna talk about
those other types of energies

00:01:52.882 --> 00:01:55.160
in this video.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:56.923
So to start to appreciate this,

00:01:56.923 --> 00:02:00.260
let's first think about
how mechanical energy

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.320
can be conserved.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.660
So you could almost view this as a law

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.920
of conversation of mechanical energy.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.790
But then we're gonna make things

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.970
a little bit more complicated

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.490
and see if we can trip ourselves up

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.320
and see if we can somehow defy the law

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.630
of conservation of energy.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.760
And be very skeptical of anyone who claims

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.460
that they can defy the law

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.722
of conservation of energy.

00:02:17.722 --> 00:02:20.781
So let's start with a system that contains

00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:22.460
all of the Earth in a ball.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.693
So let's just call this
the Earth-ball system.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.410
And when you're dealing with

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:32.950
the law of conservation of energy,

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.127
it's important to specify your system.

00:02:34.127 --> 00:02:36.950
And we're going to assume
that it's an isolated system,

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.280
that it's not interacting much

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.888
with other outside systems,

00:02:39.888 --> 00:02:42.110
the things like the sun or whatever else.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.300
And so we have, I've drawn the Earth here,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.630
in this kind of grass flat thing.

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.030
And then let me draw my ball.

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:52.180
And let's say my ball
is held above the Earth,

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.650
just like that.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.720
So while the ball is stationary,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.713
and we'll assume that there's no air here.

00:02:57.713 --> 00:03:00.837
So while the ball is stationary like that,

00:03:00.837 --> 00:03:03.970
then we have all potential energy,

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.070
we could call it gravitational
potential energy.

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.730
So it's all, and the symbol

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.490
for potential energy we tend to use is U.

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.120
And we could say this is
gravitational potential energy.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.998
And we could say there's
no kinetic energy.

00:03:15.998 --> 00:03:19.820
No kinetic energy.

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.430
If we thought about a broader system,

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.998
if we talk about the solar
system or something like that,

00:03:23.998 --> 00:03:26.530
then the Earth is orbiting around the sun,

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.600
the sun is orbiting around
the central of the galaxy.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.750
But that's why we're specifying,

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.330
this is the Earth-ball system.

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.750
But what would happen if I
were to let go of the ball?

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.380
And especially what is the
energy profile of the ball

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.730
right as it touches the
ground right over here?

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.550
And I'm assuming it's just
going to hit the ground

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:45.190
and just not bounce in any way,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.040
that would complicate things.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.320
Well, in that situation, all of a sudden

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.320
you have no gravitational
potential energy,

00:03:54.471 --> 00:03:57.200
but right as it touches it,
not when it's stationary,

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.810
right as it touches it, it's gonna have

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.253
a lot of kinetic energy.

00:04:00.253 --> 00:04:05.170
So all kinetic energy.

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.240
And so what we saw, what we see here,

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.240
is that that potential
energy all gets transferred

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.240
into kinetic energy right as
that ball touches the ground.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.387
Now I know what you're thinking.

00:04:15.387 --> 00:04:18.020
But what about right after that moment?

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.600
If that ball, especially
if doesn't bounce,

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.830
if it just sits there,

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:22.450
it looks like we have no energy anymore.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.156
It looks like energy has been destroyed.

00:04:25.156 --> 00:04:28.900
So my question to you is
where did that energy go?

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.000
Pause the video and try to think about it.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.087
So some of you might
say, "Hey, once the ball

00:04:34.087 --> 00:04:35.937
"has just, it's at rest there,

00:04:35.937 --> 00:04:37.367
"well, maybe we found a case

00:04:37.367 --> 00:04:40.110
"where we have defied the law
of conservation of energy."

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:41.420
And, remember, I told you, be skeptical

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.390
if (chuckles) anyone ever tells you that.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:47.120
Where the energy has gone,
it's been dissipated.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.490
It has gone into heat.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.160
It would have been converted
into thermal energy.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:55.420
So the ball and the
ground would actually get

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.760
that much warmer because
that kinetic energy,

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.010
right as it touches the ground

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:02.480
would be turned into thermal energy.

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.090
So one again, we have not defied the law

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.140
of conservation of energy.

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.572
Now another thing you might say is,

00:05:08.572 --> 00:05:11.340
"Well, okay, imagine a
world that there is air."

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.510
So let me draw a bunch of air particles

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:14.580
right over here.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.650
And we know that if as a ball falls down

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:19.320
it goes through the air,

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.130
you could consider that air resistance.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.216
Some people would call that
the friction due to air.

00:05:24.216 --> 00:05:26.770
Well, that would slow that ball down.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.830
So maybe it would not have
as much kinetic energy

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.090
when it gets down here.

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.285
And so it seems like
energy would be destroyed

00:05:32.285 --> 00:05:33.760
in that situation.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.310
And, once again, I would tell you, no,

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.600
the energy has not been destroyed.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.420
As the ball falls down, it's
going to heat up the ball

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:43.220
and the air around it.

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.507
And so, once again, that air resistance,

00:05:45.507 --> 00:05:48.060
that is a dissipative force.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:51.430
It's going to result in the
generation of thermal energy.

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:52.860
And if we wanted to write this

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.000
in terms of equations,
there's a couple of ways

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:55.885
to write this.

00:05:55.885 --> 00:05:57.868
We could write, if we're
just writing the law

00:05:57.868 --> 00:06:00.040
of conservation of mechanical energy,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.912
and we're not talking
about dissipative forces,

00:06:01.912 --> 00:06:05.265
we could say that the
initial kinetic energy

00:06:05.265 --> 00:06:10.265
plus the initial potential
energy is going to be

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.134
equal to, is gonna be equal
to your final kinetic energy,

00:06:15.134 --> 00:06:20.023
your final kinetic energy, plus
your final potential energy.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.263
Now another way to write
this exact same thing

00:06:23.263 --> 00:06:27.258
is to say that the
change in kinetic energy

00:06:27.258 --> 00:06:31.612
plus the change in potential energy

00:06:31.612 --> 00:06:34.259
is going to be equal to zero,

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:37.485
assuming we don't have
any dissipative forces,

00:06:37.485 --> 00:06:39.500
and assuming that we're not converting

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.100
into some of these other forms of energy,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.902
like chemical energy, or thermal energy.

00:06:43.902 --> 00:06:47.785
But if you wanted to
include dissipative forces,

00:06:47.785 --> 00:06:50.618
dissipative forces do something called

00:06:50.618 --> 00:06:53.250
non-conservative work.

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.863
They do actually negative work,

00:06:54.863 --> 00:06:56.780
because the force of, say, friction,

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.383
is always acting opposite
in the direction of motion.

00:06:59.383 --> 00:07:03.130
So to factor that in, we
could rewrite these equations.

00:07:03.130 --> 00:07:06.600
We could write that your
initial kinetic energy,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.786
plus your initial potential energy,

00:07:09.786 --> 00:07:14.090
plus any work done by
non-conservative forces,

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:16.640
this would be like air
resistance or friction.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.120
And this would be negative right over here

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.618
if we're talking about, say, friction.

00:07:20.618 --> 00:07:25.146
That is going to be equal to
your final kinetic energy,

00:07:25.146 --> 00:07:28.440
plus your final potential energy.

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.985
Or this one right over here,

00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:33.167
we could write your change,

00:07:33.167 --> 00:07:38.167
change in kinetic energy, plus
change in potential energy

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:45.020
is going to be equal to the
work done by dissipative forces.

00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:47.216
And, remember, if we're
talking about friction,

00:07:47.216 --> 00:07:49.250
dissipative forces, this right over here

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:51.616
is going to be negative.

00:07:51.616 --> 00:07:53.900
Another way that you
could've thought about this

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.959
is we could've put in thermal energy,

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:58.480
we could say that our
change in kinetic energy,

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.220
plus our change in potential energy,

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.150
plus our change in thermal energy

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:04.640
is going to be equal to zero.

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.081
Or you can include the work done

00:08:07.081 --> 00:08:08.860
by a dissipative force.

00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.960
And so, for example,
if you saw a situation

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.890
where your total change
in mechanical energy

00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:16.717
right over here was negative,

00:08:16.717 --> 00:08:20.000
you're not defying the law
of conservation of energy.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.930
It's not the energy was destroyed,

00:08:21.930 --> 00:08:25.818
it's that you had this negative work done

00:08:25.818 --> 00:08:28.980
by those dissipative forces.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:30.366
And where did that energy go?

00:08:30.366 --> 00:08:34.070
It gets converted to thermal energy.

00:08:34.070 --> 00:08:36.080
So let's do a couple of other examples

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.115
just to appreciate this.

00:08:37.115 --> 00:08:40.956
So let's do a Earth pendulum system here.

00:08:40.956 --> 00:08:43.617
So here, that's the Earth.

00:08:43.617 --> 00:08:47.019
And then I have some type of tower.

00:08:47.019 --> 00:08:49.492
And let's say I have a pendulum here.

00:08:49.492 --> 00:08:52.680
I have a pendulum.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.723
And at the low point, the ball

00:08:54.723 --> 00:08:56.340
just goes right over there,

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.030
then it goes back up to that point.

00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:00.680
And let's say the difference in height

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.626
between this point right over here,

00:09:02.626 --> 00:09:05.430
and this point where
it is right over there,

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:08.683
it is equal to H.

00:09:08.683 --> 00:09:10.780
And let's say this is the highest point

00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:14.086
that the end of the pendulum will get to.

00:09:14.086 --> 00:09:17.770
So at this point we are
maximum potential energy.

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.971
And right as it's about
to change direction,

00:09:19.971 --> 00:09:21.820
we have no kinetic energy,

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.544
it's gonna be stationary
for just a moment.

00:09:23.544 --> 00:09:26.420
But then the pendulum's
going to swing back.

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.000
And when it gets right over here,

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:28.833
all of that potential energy

00:09:28.833 --> 00:09:31.060
is gonna be converted to kinetic energy,

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:33.020
assuming we don't have
any dissipative forces

00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:35.020
like friction, slash, air resistance.

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:38.380
And then all that kinetic
energy gets converted back

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.840
into potential energy.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.570
Another example that we could look at

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:44.520
that would complicate
this a little bit more

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:48.480
is to think about an
Earth spring ball system.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:49.760
So that's the Earth.

00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:53.060
And let's say there's a
spring right over here.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:57.861
And we have a ball that starts stationary.

00:09:57.861 --> 00:10:00.950
So up here it's all potential energy,

00:10:00.950 --> 00:10:02.999
gravitational potential energy.

00:10:02.999 --> 00:10:07.000
So all gravitational potential energy.

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.175
Assuming we have no air
resistance, we let go.

00:10:09.175 --> 00:10:11.551
Right before it touches the spring

00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:14.580
when we have maximum velocity,

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:18.770
here it is going to be all kinetic energy,

00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:19.900
all kinetic energy,

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.810
but then it's going to
compress the string.

00:10:22.810 --> 00:10:26.010
And assuming we don't have
any thermal energy generated,

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.710
you actually will always,
in the real world,

00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:29.470
have some thermal energy generated,

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:31.290
but if the spring gets
compressed and at some point

00:10:31.290 --> 00:10:34.120
the ball is over here, well, now,

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:36.330
you have some of that
energy that's been converted

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.729
into spring potential energy.

00:10:38.729 --> 00:10:41.940
Or sometimes it's called
elastic potential energy,

00:10:41.940 --> 00:10:44.630
because by virtue of
compressing that spring,

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:46.200
this thing's going to rebound

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.680
and it could be converted
back into kinetic energy

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:51.953
and/or gravitational potential energy.
