00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.720
I said I would get you a more
interesting mass composition

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.100
to empirical formula problem,
one that doesn't just have a

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.590
straight-up 2:1 ratio.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:09.880
And so here it is.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.350
I have a bag of stuff.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.160
Or let's call this a
bottle of stuff.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.930
Maybe it's in its liquid form.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:21.930
And it happens to be 2.04%
hydrogen, 65.3% oxygen, and

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.070
32.65% sulfur.

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.950
What is the empirical formula,
what's our best stab at the

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.240
empirical formula, of
this substance?

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.479
So what we would do, like we
do in all these problems,

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.690
let's just assume we've got
100 grams of the stuff.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.840
So we have 100 grams
of the stuff.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.400
So we assume 100 grams. Let me
do that in a good yellow.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:52.110
So let's say, assume I have 100
grams. How many grams of

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.180
hydrogen do I have?

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.080
If I have 100 grams total, 2.04%
of that is hydrogen, so

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.360
I have 2.04 grams of hydrogen.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.349
I have 65.3 grams of oxygen.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:13.030
And I have 32.65 grams
of sulfur.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.280
Now, what we need to do now is
figure out how many moles of

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.100
hydrogen is this.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.580
How many moles of oxygen.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.900
And how many moles of sulfur.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.570
Then we can compare the ratios
and we should be able to know

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:22.820
the empirical formula.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.080
What is the mass of 1
mole of hydrogen?

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.370
Let me write that.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:36.130
So 1 mole of hydrogen.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.160
Well we know what the mass
number for hydrogen is.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.100
It's 1.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.400
And especially, the atomic
weight, also for hydrogen, if

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.800
we were to take it on Earth.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.120
The composition, you
pretty much just

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.340
find hydrogen nucleuses.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.520
If it's neutral, it
has an electron,

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.250
but it has no neutrons.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.220
So it has an atomic mass of
one atomic mass unit.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.520
So one mole of hydrogen.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.470
If you have a ton of hydrogens
together, or a mole of them,

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:07.930
not a ton, I shouldn't say, you
have 6.02 times 10 to the

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.360
23 hydrogens.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.590
Then you take hydrogen's atomic
mass number in atomic

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.050
mass units.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.250
And you say, well, it'll
be that many grams

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.360
of hydrogen, right?

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.230
So if you immediately look up
here, if we have 2.04 grams of

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.680
hydrogen, how many moles
of hydrogen do we have?

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.110
Well, one mole is one
gram, so we have

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.720
2.04 moles of hydrogen.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.460
Notice, this said what the
mass of the hydrogen is.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.100
This tells us how many hydrogen
molecules we have.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.000
Remember, this is 2.04 times
6.02 times 10 to the 23

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.050
hydrogen atoms. Moles
of hydrogen.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.410
Maybe I should write
that down.

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:50.450
So one mole of hydrogen.

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.890
There you go.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.210
And then oxygen.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:57.200
One mole of oxygen.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.560
Oxygen's mass number, in
case you forgot, is 16.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.110
Right there.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.270
Oxygen's mass number is 16.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.740
So one mole of oxygen has a mass
of 16 grams. 6.02 times

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:15.650
10 to the 23 oxygen atoms
has a mass of 16 grams.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.490
So how many moles
do we have here?

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.850
Let's see.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:30.850
So if we take 65.3
grams of oxygen.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.220
And we have 16 grams per mole,
so you divide by 16.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.180
It equals 4.08125.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.760
I don't want to get
too precise here.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.540
But let me just write that.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.810
4.08 moles of oxygen.

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:46.920
So I'm going to write that
in oxygen color.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:53.870
So I have 4.08 moles
of oxygen.

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.410
And then finally, sulfur.

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.755
What is sulfur's atomic mass?

00:03:58.755 --> 00:04:00.630
The one thing I'll never
forget about

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:02.460
sulfur is its smell.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.540
There's a city in Louisiana
which we used to drive to all

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.170
the time -- I think we had some
family friends there--

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.790
called Port Sulfur.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.640
And they did a lot of sulfur
processing there.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.130
And lucky for the residents,
at least at the time-- I

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.160
apologize if they fixed the
issue-- it smelled like

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.940
sulfur, which smells
like rotten eggs.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.390
But anyway, one mole
of sulfur.

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.680
So sulfur's atomic mass
is 32 atomic mass

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.310
units per sulfur atom.

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.630
So a whole mole of it is going
to have a mass of 32 grams. So

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.650
a mole of sulfur-- not a mule.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.410
Maybe I should invent a new
unit called the mule.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.230
So a mole of sulfur is
32 grams. So how

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:53.380
many moles do we have?

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:55.730
We have a little bit more than
one, but let's be precise

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.600
here, because everything else is
a little bit of a decimal.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:09.050
So if we have 32.65 grams of
sulfur and we divide by the

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:13.170
number of grams per mole--
divided by 32 grams per mole--

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:25.280
we have 1.02 moles of sulfur.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.590
This was hydrogen up here.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:30.320
So here, you should hopefully
see a pretty good ratio, here.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.690
For every one sulfur atom-- I
mean, the ratio worked exactly

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.640
out and that's because I did
this problem before.

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.250
I actually made up this problem
before we worked, so I

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.860
made it so the numbers
worked out.

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.210
But one mole of sulfur, for
every mole of sulfur, so for

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.380
every 6.02 times 10 to the 23
sulphur atoms, you have two

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.290
moles of hydrogen, right?

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.840
This ratio is 1:2.

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:52.240
Two times 1.02 is 2.04.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.430
And then, for every one mole
of sulfur, you have

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.930
four moles of oxygen.

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:56.380
Right?

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.380
Literally, if you multiply this
times four you get 4.08.

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:09.960
So the ratio of hydrogen to
sulfur to oxygen is for every

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.620
one sulfur, we have
two hydrogens and

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.930
we have four oxygens.

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:25.110
So the empirical formula
of this is H2.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:28.200
And then we have one sulfur.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:30.290
And then we have four oxygens.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.770
And this is sulfuric acid, one
of the things you would least

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.500
like poured on you
most of the time.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.230
Anyway, hope you found
that useful.
