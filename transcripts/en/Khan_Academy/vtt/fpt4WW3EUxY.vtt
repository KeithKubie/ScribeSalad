00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.350
- [Instructor] In response to
fears of a chocolate shortage,

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.150
farmers are looking to
a high-yielding variety

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.528
of cocoa tree.

00:00:07.528 --> 00:00:12.528
Which was developed by Ecuadorian
agronomist Homero Castro.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.370
So this was a bit strange
that we end a sentence,

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.280
and then we start a sentence with,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.170
which was developed by Ecuadorian
agronomist Homero Castro.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.140
Because this right by itself,
this isn't a sentence,

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.140
this isn't a sentence by itself.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.170
This feels like this which is referring,

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.170
it's giving us more explanation
of this high-yielding

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.100
variety of cocoa tree.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.500
So I definitely don't wanna separate it

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.810
as a separate sentence
so I'm gonna change it,

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.440
so I'm gonna scratch out no change.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.530
So let's look at this choice, so this say,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.760
farmers are looking to
a high-yielding variety

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.920
of cocoa tree comma,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.100
which was developed by Ecuadorian
agronomist Homero Castro.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.910
So this one feels quite good.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.340
I would use a comma and just
go straight to the which,

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.007
so this one looks right.

00:01:00.007 --> 00:01:02.479
Let's look at the other choices.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:04.890
Farmers are looking to
a high-yielding variety

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.400
of cocoa tree, and that tree was developed

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.760
by Ecuadorian agronomist Homero Castro.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.280
Well this is just unnecessarily wordy,

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.680
we're using the word tree
twice, so I don't like that one.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.840
And this last choice is
just like the second choice,

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.260
but instead of a comma
we have a semicolon.

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.370
And the reason why I like a
comma more than a semicolon,

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:27.360
I imagine, I view a semicolon
as separating two clauses

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.790
that can almost stand on
themselves, and in fact,

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.630
sometimes they can stand on themselves,

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.030
but there's a semicolon to kind of show

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.500
that they are related.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.730
While a comma is, for the most part,

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:38.700
separating clauses that can't stand,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.760
the first one can stand
alone by themselves.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.840
In response to fears of
a chocolate shortage,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.869
farmers are looking to
a high-yielding variety

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:45.870
of cocoa tree.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.280
That can stand by itself.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.500
But the second clause has
trouble standing by itself,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.290
in fact, it can't stand as a sentence,

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.770
which was developed by Ecuadorian
agronomist Homero Castro.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.076
So I feel good about the
comma right over here.

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:00.460
No need to over-complicate things,

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.933
if the simpler tool works.
