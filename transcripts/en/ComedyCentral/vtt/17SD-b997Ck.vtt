(Tate)
Ah, the old submopod.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.571 align:start position:0%
You know, your mother and I
conceived you

00:00:05.604 --> 00:00:07.106 align:start position:0%
in a vessel like this.

00:00:07.139 --> 00:00:08.574 align:end position:100%
Dad, that--
that's inappropriate.

00:00:08.607 --> 00:00:10.243
No, no, no, no,
it's fascinating.

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:11.611
How did you find the space?

00:00:11.644 --> 00:00:13.746
Well, she kinda shimmied up
the side.

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:15.048
Can I--Can I--
Can I show you?

00:00:15.081 --> 00:00:16.249
Sure.
Am I you or your wife?

00:00:16.282 --> 00:00:17.683
- Ugh.
- No, I'm me.

00:00:17.716 --> 00:00:19.318 align:start position:0%
And then if you just scoot up
and spread eagle.

00:00:19.351 --> 00:00:20.386
- Ugh.
- Like this?

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:21.454 align:start position:0%
Not quite.

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:22.789 align:start position:0%
She had her leg
up on that panel.

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:24.190
- And she--
- No, don't.

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:26.292 align:start position:0%
Let me just
adjust your hips.

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:27.393
Stop it!

00:00:27.426 --> 00:00:29.295 align:start position:0%
Not now, Chrysalis.
Daddy's busy.

00:00:29.328 --> 00:00:31.364 align:end position:100%
FYI, I'm very comfortable
with my body.

00:00:31.397 --> 00:00:32.765 align:end position:100%
So just really invade
my personal space.

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:33.766 align:start position:0%
[hoarse murmur]

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:34.767
Dad, stop!

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.269
[rattle, all screaming]

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:37.470
Oh, my God!
[overlapping yelling]

00:00:37.503 --> 00:00:39.105 align:start size:13% position:88%
Agh!

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:40.673 align:end position:100%
Look, Dazzle.
It's Splasha, your girlfriend.

00:00:40.706 --> 00:00:43.109 align:start size:31% position:69%
Thank God.

00:00:43.142 --> 00:00:46.245 align:start position:0%
Splasha, I've missed you
so much.

00:00:46.278 --> 00:00:47.613 align:start position:0%
I know!

00:00:47.646 --> 00:00:50.750 align:start position:0%
Every second we're apart
is like a million eternities.

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:53.186 size:75% position:38%
No,<i> you</i> try and keep up.
