00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.890
Okay Michael, so here's the first sort
of real example that I want to give you

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:06.540
and it's going to be in peer teaching,
which hopefully is near and

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.130
dear to some of our listener's hearts so
here's the idea.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.000
The idea is that we've got a student.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.920
Let's called the student curly,
and we've got a teacher.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.040
Let's called his teachers smooth and
there's a bunch of questions, okay,

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.650
on some subject.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:21.970
Pick a subject you like.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.520
&gt;&gt; Dinosaurs.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.070
&gt;&gt; Dinosaurs.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.360
Okay good, so if you want your questions
on dinosaurs, you should draw dinosaurs.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.120
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.560
There I've drawn
a dinosaur in white ink.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.190
Okay, so what we have here is we have
a bunch of questions about dinosaurs

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.036
from the
&gt;&gt; It's a snow dynamicus.

00:00:37.036 --> 00:00:40.485
&gt;&gt; A snow
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH] Okay, let's try that again.

00:00:40.485 --> 00:00:43.300
So what we have is we have a bunch
of questions, and let's just say for

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:47.380
the sake of this discussion that
we can sort them, and order them

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.940
from really really easy questions
to really really hard questions.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.940
And what I really mean
is that down here,

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.560
people with very little knowledge about
dinosaurs can answer people up here.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.690
You really have to have
learned a lot about dinosaurs,

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.380
and it kind of moves between
the spectrum from easy to hard.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.200
That make sense?

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.880
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
I guess as a coarse approximation.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.930
&gt;&gt; Sure, and so
what we're trying to figure out and

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.890
this is important the goal
here is to figure out

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.550
what incentives we can give to both
the student and to the teacher.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.620
So that learning happens over time so
the goal is learning and

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.500
what we need to do is design mechanism.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.330
And mechanism in this setting means
like a payoff function essentially.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.800
&gt;&gt; Yeah,
because we're talking game theory, so

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.630
in the end we're always going to be
talking about some kind of payoff.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.340
Some way providing utility for taking
some kinds of actions in the world.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:39.450
&gt;&gt; Now, it's important course this
is not just simply a one shot game.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.950
This really is a case that room will
be taking actions over a period

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.900
of time because of course learning is
going to happen over a period of time.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.440
And we want to figure out how
we're going to get someone to

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.370
kind of get out these questions.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.460
This is all we've got right.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.140
We've got learning, we got a teacher,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.060
we got a bunch of questions we know
they're easier or easy and hard and

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.100
we're going to try to figure out
what we want the teacher to do.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.870
And what we want to learner to do so
the learning happen, okay.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.790
So we need to design a mechanism
that will ensure the goal.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.690
&gt;&gt; And
just to be clear is your assumption that

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.440
answering questions actually helps
you learn or is this just assessment?

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.950
&gt;&gt; This is a sort of assessment.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.600
This is assessment but of course if
you can reliably answer questions

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.680
then it suggests that
you know something.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.230
Okay.
&gt;&gt; Does that make sense?

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.600
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I guess I'm just
wondering to what end, right?

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.450
So, what kind of questions
should be asked.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.290
&gt;&gt; Ones that help me to figure
out that you've learned.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.150
&gt;&gt; That you've learned.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.870
&gt;&gt; Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.770
&gt;&gt; Now,
other stuff can be happening here.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.780
And there's you know
whole complicated things.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.680
Readings can happen in between.

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.090
There can be tutorials or whatever but

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.550
we're trying to make this game really
sort of simple to illustrate the idea.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.980
So in between questions
things might happen.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.520
&gt;&gt; Okay.
&gt;&gt; And

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.860
perhaps answering the question
requires that you go off and

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.900
you do some reading or do some work.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.200
&gt;&gt; Which could promote some learning.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.270
&gt;&gt; Which could promote some learning.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:56.256
Some of these questions might be.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.940
Take implement five supervised
learning algorithms on two

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.550
datasets that are interesting run them
and write a talker to say for example.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.480
&gt;&gt; My gosh,
that's a terrible assignment.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.240
&gt;&gt; Yeah, but
you will learn something in.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.410
&gt;&gt; Yeah, you'll learn that some
people give terrible assignments

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.540
that cause you to learn.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.860
I think that's what
really important here.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.440
&gt;&gt; So are you with me?

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.470
Kind of understand what it is
we're trying to accomplish here?

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:18.080
&gt;&gt; I think so, yeah.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.230
&gt;&gt; Okay, cool.
&gt;&gt; So let me give you a proposal for

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.740
some instances and you tell me
what you think is going to happen.
