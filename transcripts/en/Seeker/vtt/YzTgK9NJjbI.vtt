00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.150
Apparently some adults prefer to drink breast
milk, but is that really what’s breast for

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:09.559
them?

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:11.860
Whatup my mammals, I’m Julian for DNews.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.330
There’s a small community of adults who
have taken to drinking human breast milk.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.289
Some for the taste or pleasure, others for
the supposed health benefits.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.580
While science can’t dictate whether or not
someone’s personal preferences are right

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.750
or wrong, it can debunk health claims, so
let’s see if breast milk is the “superfood”

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.540
some forums claim it is.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.300
Some fitness forums claim human breast milk
is a good supplement for bulking routines

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.050
because, they say, it has more nutritional
value than dairy and can help athletes recover

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.520
from workouts faster.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.059
But breast milk’s composition doesn’t
totally agree with those claims.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:51.649
On average mature human milk is 0.8%-0.9%
protein, far less than whole milk’s 3.3%.

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.570
As for caloric content, it’s slightly above
whole milk.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.710
Whole milk offers 62.6 kcal per 100 ml, and
human milk is 60-75 kcal per 100 ml.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.660
Breast milk does have more lactose in it,
around 7% while whole milk has about 4%, so

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.259
the higher levels of that carbohydrate may
indeed help replenish energy stores faster.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:18.310
By comparison though Gatorade is 13% carbohydrates,
so the self-reported energy benefits are likely

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:19.599
a placebo effect.

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:23.509
Another purported benefit of breast milk is
it’s easier to digest and has antibodies

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:24.659
from the mother in it.

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.840
With that in mind, some chemotherapy patients
have taken to drinking it as a source of nutrition

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.310
and to bolster their immune system.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.799
There’s a few problems with this line of
thinking though: chemotherapy can cause a

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.689
lactase deficiency for some patients and because
breast milk has more lactose in it, it’s

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.009
actually harder to digest.

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:42.329
Then there’s the claim about antibodies.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.979
The most common antibody in breast milk is
immunoglobulin A. These antibodies protect

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.819
surfaces of the body like the nose, ears,
eyes, breathing passages, digestive tract,

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:52.819
and vagina.

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:55.810
While they may actually benefit the patient,
they’re going to lose some effectiveness

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:59.700
if the mother lives elsewhere and so is exposed
to different pathogens.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.329
Which brings us to a bigger problem.

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.229
There are non-profit breast milk banks in
the United States, but they cater to infants

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.020
who need milk and the cost of operation means
the milk can be expensive.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.920
There are sites like Only the Breast that
allow mothers to sell and ship their product

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.069
to anyone directly.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.209
Since there’s no standard on how the milk
is packed and shipped, it’s often stored

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:22.650
in a way that allows bacteria to contaminate
it.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.090
The New York Times found that 64% of samples
from milk sharing sites had staph, 36% had

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.390
strep, and a whopping 74% would have failed
milk bank criteria.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.420
Plus the milk is usually unscreened or unpasteurized.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.269
A milk bank in San Jose, California that screens
potential donors had to turn away 3.3% of

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:46.269
them because they tested positive for HIV,
syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or human

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:51.239
T-cell lymphotropic virus, which is a virus
that can actually cause cancer.

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.939
If a mother has any of these, she can pass
them on in her breast milk.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:59.769
That is the absolute last thing immunocompromised
chemo patients need, and if they’re buying

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:03.030
milk from unscreened donors, they’re taking
a huge risk.

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.920
So it looks like breast milk isn’t the wonder
food some health or fitness forums make it

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:07.920
out to be.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.719
It’s absolutely top notch for babies, but
the benefits for adults are negligible and

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:14.590
it can even be very harmful if it comes from
a bad source.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.689
As for the weirdness factor of drinking breast
milk as an adult?

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.719
Well keep in mind adult humans couldn’t
drink any milk until a genetic mutation about

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.159
12,000 years ago.

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.530
And it’s still primarily a european thing.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.569
It’s why 95% of asians and almost 100% of
native americans are lactose intolerant.

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.439
So maybe reconsider that drinking cow boob
juice is pretty weird already, when you think

00:03:35.439 --> 00:04:04.400
about it.
