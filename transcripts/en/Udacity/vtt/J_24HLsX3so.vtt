00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.630
Let's talk for a moment about this metric of time between selections.

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.100
Suppose that an Airhead is selected.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.440
Followed by a Starburst.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:10.790
Followed by two Hershey's.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.770
Followed by an Airhead again.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.330
Let's define the number of candies that come between two Airhead selections as

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.300
the interselection time between Airheads.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.133
So if someone were to choose an Airhead here,

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:26.797
there would be zero turns in between Airhead selections.

00:00:26.797 --> 00:00:31.273
If someone were to choose an Airhead here, there would be one turn,

00:00:31.273 --> 00:00:32.774
two turns, and so on.

00:00:32.774 --> 00:00:36.143
Until here, where someone actually chose an Airhead again.

00:00:36.143 --> 00:00:40.360
We have an interselection time of 4 turns between Airhead selections.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.210
And just to reiterate, the interselection time for

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.070
a candy c is the number of turns between selections of that candy c.
