00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.680
So how do you identify competitors?

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.910
Well, you could always just ask.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.105
Ask potential customers how they
solve the same need you solve.

00:00:09.105 --> 00:00:11.580
So with the bark myth,
we can go to a dog park and

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.160
talk to different dog owners and
ask them how they solve the problem

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.430
of having someone watch their
dog while they're on vacation.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.400
We can ask them,
do you take your dog to a kennel?

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.700
Do you get your dog walker to come
a few times a day when you're out?

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.610
Do you ask your friends to watch
your dog when you're gone?

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.100
We can try to find out how they do
research to figure out where to

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.175
put their dog.

00:00:31.175 --> 00:00:32.905
Maybe it's just word of
mouth between people.

00:00:32.905 --> 00:00:34.255
Maybe they go online.

00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:36.915
Maybe they ask each
other at the dog park.

00:00:36.915 --> 00:00:40.565
Another way to identify your competitors
is to just search for them yourself.

00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:42.315
Here, let's try it with a bark myth.

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:44.260
If I search dog sitting online.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.380
I can see who my biggest
competitors are.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.310
Look, the first people who come
up are Rover and Doggy Vacay.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.840
They're very well known
names in the industry.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.290
And I can see who's buying ads for
this same keyword search.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.920
I want you to take a moment to
think about your own app idea or

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.070
business idea.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.540
Who are your competitors?

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.190
I want you to think about some
keywords you would use to search for

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.580
your potential business.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.960
And so some search queries to see
whose at the top of the list.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.190
You can check out the Playstore or
any app store to do the same thing.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.260
Now if you don't have an app idea
feel free to use a bark myth but

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.230
don't use the competitor
examples we already talked about.

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.880
Insert the competitors
names in these three boxes.
