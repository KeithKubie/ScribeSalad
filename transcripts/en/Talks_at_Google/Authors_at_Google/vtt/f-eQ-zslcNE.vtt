[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.570
DAVID PABLO COHN: OK, so I
get to do the introduction.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.472
Our speaker today
is David Pablo Cohn.

00:00:15.472 --> 00:00:16.930
It would be impossible
to overstate

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:20.268
the impact that every aspect
of his work has had on my life.

00:00:20.268 --> 00:00:21.642
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:25.560
Because I can.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.520
He describes himself
as a failed academic.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.300
He came to Google in 2002, after
writing for previous startups

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.070
down into smoking craters.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.900
He finally listened to
Peter Norvig's good advice

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.330
and joined.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.830
Started--

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.204
PETER NORVIG: But
I also gave you

00:00:42.204 --> 00:00:43.551
bad advice to join another one.

00:00:43.551 --> 00:00:44.050
But--

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.460
DAVID PABLO COHN: Yeah,
on average, we did OK.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.180
I started out by
trying to apply machine

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.980
learning to search quality.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.010
And in the subsequent 11 years,
bounced around nearly a dozen

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.310
different teams from
spam fighting to .org.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.180
Pablo's internal Google title
was Instigator-at-Large.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.670
And he says he's most
proud of his 20% projects,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.550
one of which was creating--
again, this is your fault--

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.010
the first machine learning
curriculum inside Google

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.670
as a 20% project, taught
thousands of engineers.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.350
And the other was
that he accidentally

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.080
found himself in
charge of Google Labs,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.460
also as a 20% project.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.790
And both of those launched
without ever actually entering

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:25.570
the official PDB.

00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:31.500
OK, I'm going to
continue the charade.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.900
In 2010, he spent his
sabbatical working

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.180
for the US Antarctic
program at the South Pole,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.880
as the Help Desk at the
Bottom of the World;

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.630
left Google in 2013 to spend
more time writing and working

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.590
in Antarctica.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.490
Ah.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.720
There we go.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.860
Thank you.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.150
Oh, that's cool all
kind of fun recursive.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.212
You can watch--

00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:53.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.730
Recently, as last
Friday, was announced

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:03.020
to be the winner of this year's
Palo Alto Short Story Contest.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.120
Grab this last week's
copy of the "Weekly."

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.180
There we go, that was what
I was going to show off,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.810
the Instigator-at-Large.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.200
And he is here on the
first stop of publicizing

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.650
his just-released second book,
a collection of short stories,

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.050
titled "Eight in Three Weeks
and Other Early Stories,"

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.910
published by Montemayor Press.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.320
And I'm going to stop
here, because I can't think

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.403
of anything I can say that
he couldn't say just as

00:02:26.403 --> 00:02:27.050
well himself.

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.998
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.215
Thank you very much.

00:02:34.215 --> 00:02:34.715
OK, no.

00:02:34.715 --> 00:02:36.881
I'm going to get rid of the
hat, because that's just

00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:40.055
a little too silly.

00:02:40.055 --> 00:02:44.460
OK, let's do this.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.780
"Seems like it rained fire
ants all afternoon that day.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.120
They dripped from the gutters
and the old [AUDIO OUT]

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.450
and drizzled from the
leaves of the sycamore that

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.570
stood a little further
up the mossy rise.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.270
Sometimes, they just seemed to
fall from the clear Missouri

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.210
sky itself."

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.950
I love first lines.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:05.070
So for me, first lines are like
that woman in the red dress

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.640
who's just walked in the room.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.270
And you have no idea who she
is or where she came from.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:11.820
You've just been plunged
into a brand new world.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.430
And your brain is
saying, what's going on?

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.770
It's screaming for context.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.870
It's screaming for clues.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.100
For me, I guess, first lines are
this crazy romantic invitation

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.940
to fall in love.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.440
"No one was willing to say for
sure whether Billy Ericsson's

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.620
body was in the boat when
they set it afire that night.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.190
I suppose it was
better that way.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.120
Any certainty one
way or the other

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.960
would have raised
uncomfortable questions

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.210
about the disposal
of human remains.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.910
And those noncommittal
hmm's from the boys

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.429
down at the shipyard seemed
to give everyone enough leeway

00:03:45.429 --> 00:03:47.470
to believe that things
had been resolved in a way

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.290
that Billy would
have appreciated."

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.260
I should warn you, people
tend to die in my stories,

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.850
I mean, not like
horror [INAUDIBLE]..

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.550
The They die--

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:58.480
I kill them lovingly.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.818
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.204
So sometimes, when you dive
into one of these things,

00:04:06.204 --> 00:04:07.870
you're looking for
long-term commitment.

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.030
You want to meet a
character slowly.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.950
You want to get to know
them, meet the family,

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:13.812
watch them grow up,
watch their kids.

00:04:13.812 --> 00:04:15.520
And if you're reading
George R.R. Martin,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.649
watch them all
brutally slaughtered.

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.260
But you're looking for
something that will last you.

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.960
You're looking for
half a million words

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.820
in 1,000 pages or so.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.740
Other times, you're
not up for that.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.520
You really just want to dive in,
have your world turned upside

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.070
down, and find
yourself, like, whoa!

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:39.350
--as you watch the tail lights
disappear off into the dawn,

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.600
going, wow!

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.780
So I think we have short
stories for the same reason we

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:45.620
have singles' bars.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.300
Turns out, I write
short stories.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:52.280
I've tried a couple of novels.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.750
"The Heller's
Tale," the novella,

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:56.770
is the longest thing I've
actually managed to complete.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.230
But yeah, I seem to just
write short stories.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.000
I come up with an idea.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.050
I go forward with it.

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.570
And 3,000 words later, I'm done.

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.490
And there's really nothing
else I want to say about it.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:13.680
So the way I think this works
is I start out by saying,

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.460
I'll talk a little bit about me.

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.217
Then, I read you a story.

00:05:17.217 --> 00:05:19.300
And then I talk a little
about my writing process.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.500
At least, that's the way I
saw the other authors' talks

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.100
operate back when I was here.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.560
In fact, my last day
at Google, no one

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.210
knew it was my last day
except for my manager and me.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:38.130
But it was when I helped out
with the Neil Gaiman talk.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.120
And I was sitting
there in the front row.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.090
And I knew I was leaving
Google to sit down and write.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:45.190
And he was up there
reading from his new book

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.820
and talking about--

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.010
and he gave this
awesome amazing advice.

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.110
And I was thinking,
there is nothing else

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.650
I can imagine wanting to do
right now than write stuff

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.850
that would have me stand up and
talk about what I've written.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:01.062
So here I am.

00:06:01.062 --> 00:06:01.562
Whoo!

00:06:01.562 --> 00:06:02.187
AUDIENCE: Whoo!

00:06:02.187 --> 00:06:03.200
DAVID PABLO COHN: Yes.

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.871
Any case, me--

00:06:04.871 --> 00:06:05.370
Google.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.290
I was going to be a professor.

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:09.300
I failed, failed.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.490
Applied for faculty jobs
four years in a row.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:12.720
Five startups in six years.

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:13.710
Four smoking craters.

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:16.440
Found one I couldn't kill.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:20.160
My dissertation, back in
1992, was on this fringe thing

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:22.626
called machine learning.

00:06:22.626 --> 00:06:24.270
Yeah, yeah.

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.460
I got out too early.

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.960
The dissertation developed an
approach to machine learning

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.080
called active learning which,
again, I got out too early.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:35.870
But yay!

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:37.250
As I said, I bounced around.

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:40.500
As my introducer
said, I bounced around

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:43.680
a bunch of teams, created
the machine learning course,

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:45.720
found myself in
charge of Google labs.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:48.330
And I'm not good at being
in charge of things.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:49.930
And I tried to get
un-in-charge of it.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.888
And the only way I could
get un in-charge of it

00:06:51.888 --> 00:06:54.030
was by going away
on a sabbatical.

00:06:54.030 --> 00:06:56.700
And for various
reasons, I was offered

00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.980
a job at the South
Pole, being the helpdesk

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:01.920
at the bottom of the world.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:07.260
And [DEEP SIGH] that kind
of gets under your skin.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.300
You either love it or you don't.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:13.650
And I kind of loved it.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:19.280
So two, three years
later, I left for good.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:24.420
I spent my time split
between writing and working

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.969
in Antarctica.

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:28.260
When I started writing, I
was just writing travel blog.

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.320
I'd been writing travel blogs
for, like, 11 or 12 years.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:36.090
And when I was at the
South Pole, though,

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.230
there was this thing--

00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:40.809
this great thing-- that
I observed happening.

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:42.600
And I thought, this
would be really awesome

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.637
if this one other thing that
wasn't true were also true.

00:07:46.637 --> 00:07:48.220
But I don't know how
to make stuff up.

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.032
I only know how to
write what I see.

00:07:50.032 --> 00:07:51.490
And I thought,
someone really ought

00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:53.740
to write this story where
the thing that didn't happen

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:55.402
did happen.

00:07:55.402 --> 00:07:57.610
And that sat on me, and sat
with me, and sat with me.

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:58.430
And finally, I did write.

00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:59.930
And that's actually
"Heller's Tale."

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:08.190
And once you start making
shit up, it's hard to stop.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:11.620
Because it's so much
easier to write about stuff

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:14.200
that didn't actually
happen than to stick

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.170
with what actually did.

00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.240
So I'm going to
read a story now.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:24.460
And here's the problem, I
can't decide which one to read.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.360
I was figuring I'd have to
do something Antarctic-ish.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.760
Because, you know, Antarctica.

00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:35.440
But I could also do
something that's local.

00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.659
It's funny and a
little bit bitter.

00:08:37.659 --> 00:08:40.270
Nobody dies.

00:08:40.270 --> 00:08:46.060
Nostalgic-- the
raining fire ants one,

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:50.400
or "Sweet'n Morbid,"
where people do die.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.810
You all, I think I'm going to
just go with Antarctica, OK?

00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:55.470
OK.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.582
This one's called "Artifacts."

00:08:58.582 --> 00:09:00.040
And I've got my
reading glasses on.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.320
OK.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.840
Actually, let me just--
before I dive into this--

00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.840
most of my stories start
with those first lines.

00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:10.270
I just write
something down, just

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:11.775
to get a sentence on the page.

00:09:11.775 --> 00:09:13.150
And I have no idea
what it means.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:14.980
And I spend the rest
of the story trying

00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:17.380
to figure out what that means.

00:09:17.380 --> 00:09:18.580
Like, the fire ants thing--

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:21.430
when I wrote that, I had
no idea what it meant.

00:09:25.094 --> 00:09:27.010
So again, we're going
to dive into first lines

00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:30.010
that aren't quite so drastic as
the ones I've given you before.

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:32.590
But again, when I wrote
this first sentence,

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:35.896
I had no idea what it meant.

00:09:35.896 --> 00:09:37.770
"It was pretty obvious
that the girls thought

00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.290
I shouldn't have those bowls.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.105
And I wasn't at all
sure they were wrong.

00:09:42.105 --> 00:09:44.880
They, the bowls, had
arrived down at the station

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.460
under circumstances that
weren't entirely official.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:49.290
Come to think of it,
so had the girls.

00:09:49.290 --> 00:09:52.350
But the bowls arrived in a long
wooden crate with some sorts

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:54.990
of machinery-- honestly, it
could have been tractor parts--

00:09:54.990 --> 00:09:56.611
that came down from Ushuaia.

00:09:56.611 --> 00:09:58.110
There were the
official parts listed

00:09:58.110 --> 00:10:00.120
on the manifest,
the usual dunnage

00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:03.780
and then, stuffed under some
of the padding, the bowls.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:07.110
On some other planet, they could
have been tractor parts too,

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:07.890
I suppose.

00:10:07.890 --> 00:10:10.560
They reminded me
of Navajo pottery

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:13.230
but looked like they'd been
carved from spun metal instead

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:14.340
of clay.

00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.650
Which meant maybe they
weren't bowls at all.

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:18.540
I'd been meaning to
look up the definition,

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.592
if only so I could
tell the story right.

00:10:20.592 --> 00:10:22.050
Well, whatever they
were, they were

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:23.280
going to get checked
out on the berms

00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:25.440
once the folks from logistics
got their parts out.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.710
So I took them, put them on the
shelf of my bunk to brighten it

00:10:28.710 --> 00:10:30.570
up a bit, put them
next to the dream

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:33.840
catcher my little girl had given
me before I deployed out there.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.920
When the sun came around
to my side of J-95,

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.570
it came through the window and
glinted, threw the light around

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.410
with little tiny
spot on green canvas,

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.450
like stars in my own
personal planetarium."

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:46.560
I forgot, I actually
have a slide of context.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.830
Just for where we are.

00:10:51.830 --> 00:10:53.570
"I missed the
stars, still missed

00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:54.950
getting them every night.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:10:56.630
Another month here at the
South Pole, and the sun

00:10:56.630 --> 00:10:57.230
would be gone.

00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.740
And then, of course, we'd have
six months of stars nonstop,

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.120
and I'd miss the sun.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.980
OK, closer to 4 and 1/2 months.

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:06.300
Twilight on either end would
make up the difference.

00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:08.750
But when telling other people
about how things were here

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:10.820
at the pole, we
all simplified it.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:12.910
Six months of day, one sunset.

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.350
Then, six months of night
and a single sunrise.

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:17.900
Repeat ad infinitum, until
the Herc comes and gets you

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.960
for redeployment.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.854
Anyhow-- the bowls.

00:11:20.854 --> 00:11:22.520
I'd had them for a
couple of months now.

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:24.853
And they'd sort of become
part of the background for me.

00:11:24.853 --> 00:11:27.340
There were three of them,
one big and two little.

00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:29.720
And they'd nest if you slid
them together just right.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.490
They had a dull finish,
like old aluminum.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.370
And instead of
painted decorations,

00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:36.470
there were swirling patterns
cut out from the sides--

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.200
a mountain with the sun behind
it, some lightning bolts,

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:41.120
a man, and a
stylized running bird

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.610
whose tail stretched
halfway around the midpoint

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:45.350
of the largest one.

00:11:45.350 --> 00:11:47.810
I'd had them up there in the
shelf since-- oh, when was it?

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.890
Probably December.

00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:50.691
But no one had been
in my bunk since then.

00:11:50.691 --> 00:11:52.940
Come to think of it, no one
but me had been in my bunk

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.420
since November, when Michelle
left a bar of Kiwi chocolate

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.790
she'd brought in from
Scott base on my pillow,

00:11:58.790 --> 00:12:00.886
as a thank you for
fixing her computer.

00:12:00.886 --> 00:12:03.260
There weren't a lot of places
to be alone on the station,

00:12:03.260 --> 00:12:06.216
so you tended not to mess
with other people's bunks.

00:12:06.216 --> 00:12:07.840
But there had been
some sort of problem

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.670
with the cooling
recirc in our pod.

00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.040
Funny how, even down here,
you needed a cooling loop.

00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:13.831
And when the UTs fixed
it, they knocked out

00:12:13.831 --> 00:12:15.317
a couple of overhead panels.

00:12:15.317 --> 00:12:17.900
So I filed the ticket for a carp
to put up the panels back in.

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.482
And the carp brought the girls.

00:12:19.482 --> 00:12:21.940
It was still strange to think
of families living down here.

00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:24.370
I suppose it was
strange to them too.

00:12:24.370 --> 00:12:25.570
All part of the new "now."

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:29.324
We were doing our best to, as
they say, embrace the change.

00:12:29.324 --> 00:12:30.490
Anyhow, the girls were fine.

00:12:30.490 --> 00:12:31.490
I'm sure they had names.

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:32.560
But they never spoke.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:33.490
Well, almost.

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:35.510
And at least not to
anyone except each other.

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:37.690
And when they did, it was
in their own language.

00:12:37.690 --> 00:12:40.390
Their mother had come down
from some small village

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:43.530
along the spine of Patagonia,
down with the most recent wave.

00:12:43.530 --> 00:12:45.940
She'd gotten work as a welder
on one of the vessels--

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.732
apparently, she was
phenomenal with metal--

00:12:47.732 --> 00:12:49.190
then made her way
south until there

00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:50.590
wasn't anywhere farther to go.

00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:52.660
And the girls came with her.

00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:54.370
Somehow, when they
got to station,

00:12:54.370 --> 00:12:56.530
the girls latched on to
L2 as a surrogate hen

00:12:56.530 --> 00:12:58.630
and followed her around instead.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.347
L2-- her real name was Laura.

00:13:00.347 --> 00:13:01.930
But down here, I
guess we tend to lose

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.227
track of the names
our parents gave us.

00:13:04.227 --> 00:13:06.310
When she'd showed up at
the carp shop last season,

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:08.670
they already had a
Laura, also a carpenter.

00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.080
So for a while, she was Other
Laura and, then, Laura two,

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.710
before her name settled on
the present two-letter form.

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:14.835
It wasn't a big thing.

00:13:14.835 --> 00:13:16.210
I can think of
half a dozen folks

00:13:16.210 --> 00:13:18.168
that I only knew by
something their own mothers

00:13:18.168 --> 00:13:19.270
wouldn't recognize--

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:21.700
Storm, Froggy, Mutt.

00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.360
Any case, as I said, I'm
sure the girls had names.

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.970
But they just seemed like
L2's unlikely adopted brood,

00:13:27.970 --> 00:13:28.900
as they followed.

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:31.000
And we all called
them "the girls."

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.680
Straight black hair
framing little round

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:34.352
faces under their
hand-knit chullos.

00:13:34.352 --> 00:13:36.310
I thought the older one
couldn't have been more

00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.360
than eight or nine.

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:40.210
But I never was good at
telling ages of mountain folk.

00:13:40.210 --> 00:13:46.150
And those wide dark eyes made
theirs even harder to guess.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:47.925
So L2 was standing
on the ladder,

00:13:47.925 --> 00:13:50.050
poking her head up through
where the broken ceiling

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:51.107
panel was supposed to be.

00:13:51.107 --> 00:13:52.690
And the girls were
bouncing on my bed,

00:13:52.690 --> 00:13:54.310
chattering at each other.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:57.070
They'd tumbled into my bunk when
L2 had knocked, pushed past me,

00:13:57.070 --> 00:13:59.380
started sniffing and
scouting every corner

00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:03.460
of my little 6-by-8 wedge,
like puppies let off-leash.

00:14:03.460 --> 00:14:04.780
Sorry, do you mind?

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:07.720
L2 gestured towards the girls
with an air of resignation,

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.614
like there was nothing
she could do about it.

00:14:09.614 --> 00:14:10.530
There probably wasn't.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:12.161
Nah, it's fine.

00:14:12.161 --> 00:14:13.660
I didn't have
anywhere better to be.

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.310
So I watched as she
set up the ladder

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.260
and started poking
around the ceiling.

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:18.010
Watched her.

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:18.769
Watched them.

00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:20.560
I figured I ought to
try and be a good host

00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.934
and reached for
a box of gumdrops

00:14:21.934 --> 00:14:24.680
I'd picked up from a beaker
who'd left early in the season.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.530
Hey, girls, want a gumdrop?

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:28.420
They looked at me
briefly, with expressions

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.730
you might find on the
faces of zoo patrons

00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.530
who have just
watched a seal bark,

00:14:32.530 --> 00:14:34.260
and then resumed their play.

00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.030
Hey, here.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:37.517
I pulled one out, threw it.

00:14:37.517 --> 00:14:39.600
The older one caught it,
unwrapped the gooey blob,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:40.730
and sniffed at it.

00:14:40.730 --> 00:14:42.540
Handed it to her sister.

00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:44.640
She considered me again
for a moment, trying

00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:47.070
to determine whether a second
gumdrop would be coming,

00:14:47.070 --> 00:14:49.860
then turned back to the
task of bouncing on the bed.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.330
OK, here is another.

00:14:51.330 --> 00:14:53.430
She caught this one,
almost without looking,

00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:55.652
and stuffed it into the
pocket of her dress.

00:14:55.652 --> 00:14:57.360
I could have just left
well enough alone,

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.651
but this felt like a challenge.

00:14:58.651 --> 00:15:00.840
And, well, Sundays
were slow days.

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.180
Hey, girls, let me
show you Something

00:15:03.180 --> 00:15:04.710
I thought of the
Navajo-like motifs

00:15:04.710 --> 00:15:07.043
on the bowls, reached up to
where the top shelf hid them

00:15:07.043 --> 00:15:08.240
from below.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.450
There was a high,
brief, piercing shriek.

00:15:11.450 --> 00:15:12.890
When I looked back
down, the girls

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.265
had pressed themselves flat
against the plywood partition

00:15:15.265 --> 00:15:17.240
and slid as far away
from me as they could,

00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.037
eyes fixed in something close to
terror on the bowl in my hand.

00:15:21.037 --> 00:15:23.370
L2 had ducked her head back
down from the overhead space

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:25.119
and was crouched at
the top of the ladder.

00:15:25.119 --> 00:15:27.240
Jesus, Karl, what
the hell did you do?

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.910
I looked back and forth
between her and the girls.

00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:33.210
I-- um-- well--

00:15:33.210 --> 00:15:33.720
nothing.

00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:34.050
Really!

00:15:34.050 --> 00:15:35.610
I just wanted to
show them the bowls

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.590
I saved from getting burnt.

00:15:37.590 --> 00:15:38.160
Well, don't.

00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.740
Christ, can't you see
they're freaking out?

00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.250
I see.

00:15:41.250 --> 00:15:41.940
I see.

00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:43.140
But I don't know why
they're freaking!

00:15:43.140 --> 00:15:44.860
Look, they're just
metal bowls I found.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:45.780
See?

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.880
I hold up the smallest one
so she could examine it

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:49.440
and watched the
girls eyes track it

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.200
the way you'd watch a snake
moving through the grass.

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:52.830
They're nice.

00:15:52.830 --> 00:15:53.400
Where did you get them?

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:54.120
No, no, wait.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:54.930
Put them away.

00:15:54.930 --> 00:15:56.820
The girls are freaked.

00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:00.060
I took the bowl back, moving
slowly, smiling as reassuringly

00:16:00.060 --> 00:16:02.430
as I could, as I nested the
bowls inside each other,

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.772
lifted the stack to place
in the drawer at my feet.

00:16:04.772 --> 00:16:06.480
There was a brief
stampede of small feet.

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.830
And when I turned to look
again, the girls were gone.

00:16:09.830 --> 00:16:12.580
L2 regarded me with interest.

00:16:12.580 --> 00:16:16.425
Well, that was something.

00:16:16.425 --> 00:16:18.050
I figured I'd tracked
their mother down

00:16:18.050 --> 00:16:20.840
that evening to apologize
for whatever it was I'd done.

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:24.620
She was a sleeper, though,
welding on the night shift,

00:16:24.620 --> 00:16:26.910
so she wouldn't be
up until dinner.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:29.099
L2 had told me her name
half a dozen times.

00:16:29.099 --> 00:16:30.515
But I still couldn't
get it right.

00:16:30.515 --> 00:16:31.800
Iqueta, she'd said.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.840
But all I could ever
remember was equator.

00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.390
I finally asked her
to write it down.

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:40.652
Yeah, I'd find Iqueta at
the galley at dinnertime.

00:16:40.652 --> 00:16:42.110
But it was about
half an hour later

00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:44.350
that Carter came
knocking on my door.

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:46.720
Now, I don't think I'd
ever seen Dan Carter out

00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:48.806
in the Jamesways of
his own free will.

00:16:48.806 --> 00:16:50.680
Like most of the station's
senior management,

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.179
he kept to the
warmth of the station

00:16:52.179 --> 00:16:54.340
when he wasn't out in the
field making his rounds.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:57.190
Carter's primary job
was physical security,

00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:59.440
which didn't involve theft
and petty indiscretion so

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.850
much as it involved preventing
folks from hurting themselves

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.542
or others in stupid ways.

00:17:05.542 --> 00:17:07.500
Someone nicked your boots
from the locker room?

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:09.819
He'd put up a notice
on the bulletin board.

00:17:09.819 --> 00:17:12.490
Someone set up a jet
fuel-powered hibachi

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:13.720
in the smokers' lounge?

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.980
Now, that was his
bread and butter.

00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:18.430
So having Dan Carter at my
door on a Sunday afternoon

00:17:18.430 --> 00:17:21.009
was cause for at
least a little alarm.

00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:24.010
Uh, here to check out
the carps handiwork?

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:25.450
Uh, finally got
something in that

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:27.859
resembles the ceiling again.

00:17:27.859 --> 00:17:30.140
Sorry, Karl, this is business.

00:17:30.140 --> 00:17:33.950
I understand you're keeping some
sort of demon artifacts here.

00:17:33.950 --> 00:17:35.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:35.210 --> 00:17:36.200
He paused.

00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.700
It was a measured
pause, calculated

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.250
to gauge my surprise
before continuing.

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:41.577
Yeah, that's what I thought.

00:17:41.577 --> 00:17:42.410
Sorry to bother you.

00:17:42.410 --> 00:17:44.390
But Iqueta came at me
like I'd tried to feed

00:17:44.390 --> 00:17:45.560
her kids for the Rodwell.

00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.410
I mean, Megan was
doing the translating.

00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:48.710
You know my Spanish is crap.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:52.000
But the gist was you had some
sort of machine or device here

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.390
that was a danger to them--

00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:55.730
mm-- the whole station,
by the sound of it.

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.634
You have any idea what
she's talking about?

00:17:58.634 --> 00:18:00.800
I showed him the bowls and
told him the story of how

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:02.430
I'd ended up with him.

00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:07.320
He admitted, he had no better
idea what they were than I did.

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:09.610
You've-- uh-- checked
they're not radioactive?

00:18:09.610 --> 00:18:12.809
Wh-- why would I have done that?

00:18:12.809 --> 00:18:14.350
Mysterious metal
objects showing up--

00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:16.270
who knows where they're from?

00:18:16.270 --> 00:18:18.580
They're out of USAP crate
shipped from Ushuaia.

00:18:18.580 --> 00:18:20.362
The entire
continent's nuke free.

00:18:20.362 --> 00:18:21.820
Don't they check
that sort of thing

00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:23.830
when they let stuff on board?

00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:25.350
I suppose.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.800
Do you even have
a Geiger counter?

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:28.270
Does anyone here?

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:29.380
Point taken.

00:18:29.380 --> 00:18:31.954
But look, these things
are freaking Iqueta out.

00:18:31.954 --> 00:18:33.370
And honestly, I
think they're fine

00:18:33.370 --> 00:18:35.370
and you're not doing
anything to endanger anyone

00:18:35.370 --> 00:18:36.760
in the life-and-limb category.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:38.080
But wherever she
comes from, they've

00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:40.205
probably got some pretty
deep-rooted superstitions.

00:18:40.205 --> 00:18:42.372
And these things have kind
of snapped her mousetrap.

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:44.038
You're well in your
rights to keep them.

00:18:44.038 --> 00:18:45.820
But I'd take it as
a kindness to Iqueta

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:48.190
if you'd consider
shipping them back home

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:49.900
or, at the very
least, telling her you

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:52.316
were shipping them back home
and making a good show of it.

00:18:52.316 --> 00:18:53.685
Could you do that for me?

00:18:53.685 --> 00:18:54.310
I said I would.

00:18:54.310 --> 00:18:58.930
And he said he owed me a beer
for the favor and said goodbye.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.030
I figured I'd still catch
Iqueta at the galley

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.920
and apologize for
causing her kids grief.

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:05.140
I could pick up a shipping
box and some packing tape

00:19:05.140 --> 00:19:06.640
from cargo at the
same time and have

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:10.210
the double bowls on an outbound
Herc by tomorrow afternoon.

00:19:10.210 --> 00:19:12.999
Shipping them to my brother
seemed like the obvious thing,

00:19:12.999 --> 00:19:14.290
not because of the devil thing.

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:15.970
But because, over
the years, his garage

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:18.130
had ended up storing
most of the useless crap

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:20.740
I acquired when it was no
longer practical to drag around

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:22.480
the world with me.

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:23.980
So I threw the bowls
in my knapsack,

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:25.930
stepped into my bunny
boots, and pushed out

00:19:25.930 --> 00:19:27.460
through the front door of J-95."

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.750
That's the front door
there of a Jamesway tent.

00:19:32.710 --> 00:19:34.930
"Iqueta was there
waiting for me.

00:19:34.930 --> 00:19:38.260
Well, not quite waiting,
more like preparing.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:40.900
She'd carved deep gouges in the
ice surrounding the entrance

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:42.820
and filled them with
bits of scrap metal.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.560
The effect was that
of a miniature Nazca

00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:47.929
lines painting-- spirals and
pictograms, cut in a half

00:19:47.929 --> 00:19:50.470
circle, surrounding the door,
brought into relief by handfuls

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:53.860
of washers, bent wires,
and machine screws.

00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:56.060
You stop.

00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.980
Her voice was
authoritative, commanding,

00:19:57.980 --> 00:19:59.510
with a raised palm
outstretched like

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.400
an old-fashioned policeman.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.350
She was a small brown
woman with a heavy rope

00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:05.140
of thick black hair
that she wore braided

00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:06.590
and tied back behind her.

00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:10.190
But she spoke with a conviction
that stopped me in my tracks.

00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.740
Hey, sorry.

00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:12.740
I was meaning to come and
find you and apologize

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:13.850
for the trouble.

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:14.510
Carter told me.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:15.967
I'm getting rid of the bowls.

00:20:15.967 --> 00:20:17.300
I knew she didn't speak English.

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.425
But I had to say something.

00:20:18.425 --> 00:20:22.010
And I was hoping my posture
and conciliatory tone

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.240
would get the message across.

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:24.860
You stop!

00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:26.750
She said it again,
like a magic spell

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:29.720
whose words had no meaning to
her but held someone's promise

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:31.220
that, if uttered
in the right tone,

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.780
would produce the
desired result.

00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:33.560
Yes, yes, yes.

00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:34.496
I'm stopping.

00:20:34.496 --> 00:20:35.870
But I'm getting
rid of the bowls.

00:20:35.870 --> 00:20:36.370
See?

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.000
I've got them right
here in my bag.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.100
I patted my bag over my
shoulder to add emphasis.

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:44.870
And as I did, her eyes
grew wide in terror.

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:46.504
Her next, you stop!

00:20:46.504 --> 00:20:48.170
--was not so much the
voice of authority

00:20:48.170 --> 00:20:50.860
but almost screamed loud
enough that the doors

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:53.870
slammed open on J-93 next door.

00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:55.430
A couple of husky
firemen burst out

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:56.971
at a run to stop
what they could only

00:20:56.971 --> 00:21:00.740
assume was some violent assault.
I dropped the bag at my feet,

00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:02.000
arms outstretched.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:03.740
Her eyes followed
the bag as it fell.

00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:05.990
And the bowls emitted a
muffled bell-like clang

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:07.400
when they hit the ground.

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:09.800
By now, Mike was
between us, sizing me up

00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:12.710
as an unlikely assailant, but
still using his fire chief's

00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:14.300
command-and-control voice.

00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:16.190
What happened here, Karl?

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.070
He was in my face, ready
to grab, tackle me,

00:21:19.070 --> 00:21:19.970
whatever was needed.

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:20.469
It's OK.

00:21:20.469 --> 00:21:20.979
It's OK.

00:21:20.979 --> 00:21:23.520
Apparently, I've got something
in my bag that freaks her out.

00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:25.520
I was telling her that
it was getting rid of it.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:26.990
And, well, she freaked out.

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.959
What is it?

00:21:27.959 --> 00:21:29.750
But he didn't wait for
an answer and turned

00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:32.570
to where Jake was already
trying to calm Iqueta and assess

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:34.382
whether there had
been any actual harm.

00:21:34.382 --> 00:21:36.590
That's when he looked down
and saw the lines of metal

00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:37.980
drawn in the snow.

00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:39.275
He turned back to me.

00:21:39.275 --> 00:21:41.760
What the-- did you do this?

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.447
No, I-- I've got these
metal bowls I found.

00:21:44.447 --> 00:21:46.780
Carter told me they freaked
Iqueta out and her kids out.

00:21:46.780 --> 00:21:47.840
So I was going
over to the station

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:49.270
to get some boxes
to ship them out.

00:21:49.270 --> 00:21:50.103
I came out the door.

00:21:50.103 --> 00:21:52.514
And she was here with
all this ice voodoo,

00:21:52.514 --> 00:21:53.430
yelling at me to stop.

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.136
Honest, I'm just as
confused as you are.

00:21:56.136 --> 00:21:58.490
Iqueta was talking fast
to Jake, pantomiming

00:21:58.490 --> 00:22:02.360
a pushing motion directed
at my dropped knapsack

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.850
and the bowls it contained.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.139
Uh, Mike, you speak Spanish?

00:22:06.139 --> 00:22:07.180
I'm kind of limited here.

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.140
And she's going crazy fast.

00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:12.410
None of us did, other than the
usual, una cerveza, por favor.

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:15.500
So Mike called for someone
in the now-assembled crowd

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.800
to go find L2, Megan, or
someone who could translate.

00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:21.650
In the meantime, it became
clear that it wasn't me

00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.300
that Iqueta had
the problem with.

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.030
It was whatever was in my bag.

00:22:25.030 --> 00:22:27.950
And as I stepped clear of the
half circle of snow drawing,

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:33.226
she shook her head
and gestured for me

00:22:33.226 --> 00:22:35.600
to go back inside, to take
the bowls, and put them away."

00:22:35.600 --> 00:22:38.340
Who wrote this stuff?

00:22:38.340 --> 00:22:38.840
"Fine.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:40.670
I nodded in ascent,
scooped up the bag,

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:43.250
and retreated back into
the darkness of J-95.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:45.679
Once inside, I slid the
drawer out under my bed,

00:22:45.679 --> 00:22:47.720
dumped the bowls away,
and pushed the drawer back

00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:48.585
with my foot.

00:22:48.585 --> 00:22:50.900
I came out, holding the
bag up, open and empty,

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:53.270
as though I were leaving
the target of a police siege

00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:55.190
and wanted to assure
the assembled SWAT

00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:59.079
team that I was carrying
no armaments or explosives.

00:22:59.079 --> 00:23:00.870
Someone had fetched
Carter in the meantime,

00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:01.770
with Megan in tow.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:03.728
And the rest of the crowd
had mostly dispersed.

00:23:03.728 --> 00:23:06.347
But Iqueta still stood
there, like a defiant sentry

00:23:06.347 --> 00:23:07.680
at the edge of the carved rings.

00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:09.450
And the firefighters
were absent-mindedly

00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.600
digging the toes of
their boots into the ice.

00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:14.490
Carter was out of
breath from running.

00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:17.040
He looked back and forth
between me and Iqueta,

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.370
sizing up the situation
before speaking.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:23.810
OK, sounds like Operation
Get Rid of Devil Bowls

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.790
didn't go as smoothly
as I'd hoped.

00:23:25.790 --> 00:23:28.950
Anyone want to fill me
in on what happened?

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:30.370
Megan translated his question.

00:23:30.370 --> 00:23:32.530
And Iqueta burst into
a river of Spanish,

00:23:32.530 --> 00:23:35.830
gesturing wildly at me, at
J-95, and at the rings of ice

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:37.270
and scrap metal at our feet.

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:41.140
Mike raised his hand slowly,
authoritatively, for attention.

00:23:41.140 --> 00:23:42.950
He was a head taller
than the rest of us.

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:45.430
And even Iqueta stopped
to give him the floor.

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:47.680
He gave, in my view, a
fair and measured account

00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.138
of what he had seen and assured
Carter that the bowls were,

00:23:50.138 --> 00:23:51.340
again, secured in my bunk.

00:23:51.340 --> 00:23:53.923
Megan raised her hand-- it felt
a little like we'd been called

00:23:53.923 --> 00:23:56.350
out by the principal for
fighting on the playground--

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:59.140
and gave her understanding
of Iqueta's account.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:01.671
She says the bowls have
demons and that they can't

00:24:01.671 --> 00:24:02.920
be brought inside the station.

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.690
She says that they have to
stay inside the circles here.

00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:09.620
If they get out, they'll
take her and her daughters.

00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:10.910
Carter was intrigued.

00:24:10.910 --> 00:24:12.170
She said that?

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:14.150
The bowls will take her?

00:24:14.150 --> 00:24:17.050
What does that mean?

00:24:17.050 --> 00:24:18.050
Why would they take her?

00:24:18.050 --> 00:24:18.920
Where?

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.840
Again, Megan asked
and then listened.

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:24.870
Because she-- left-- no,
it's like-- it's like left,

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.660
but she's saying,
[SPANISH],, which is,

00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:29.570
like, landed or went down?

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:31.290
Her husband or the
village or wherever--

00:24:31.290 --> 00:24:32.400
there are a lot of
names I'm getting here.

00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.180
But she left.

00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:35.910
And someone wants to bring her
back to wherever she came from.

00:24:35.910 --> 00:24:37.860
Iqueta pantomimed
incomprehensibly,

00:24:37.860 --> 00:24:40.380
presumably acting out what
she thought Megan was saying."

00:24:40.380 --> 00:24:42.210
Pretend I'm pantomiming here.

00:24:42.210 --> 00:24:44.460
"Carter put a hand
to his forehead.

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:45.090
Oh, god.

00:24:45.090 --> 00:24:46.417
So it's an HR issue too.

00:24:46.417 --> 00:24:47.250
Let's go find Linda.

00:24:47.250 --> 00:24:48.960
Mike, Jake, thanks for the help.

00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.780
Think you can go.

00:24:49.780 --> 00:24:51.210
Megan, do you have
a few minutes?

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:52.585
At this point, I
think you've got

00:24:52.585 --> 00:24:55.182
more of the story
than anyone else here.

00:24:55.182 --> 00:24:57.140
We sat together in the
upstairs conference room

00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:59.190
as Megan, Carter, and I
repeated what we knew.

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:02.481
Iqueta nodded enthusiastically,
while Megan spoke.

00:25:02.481 --> 00:25:04.230
Linda's Spanish wasn't
as good as Megan's.

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:05.340
But it was good
enough for her to ask

00:25:05.340 --> 00:25:06.810
a few questions of her own.

00:25:06.810 --> 00:25:08.820
It just seemed to be
that the bowls were sent

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.980
or, as Iqueta had
had it, had come

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:12.654
to take her and
her daughters back.

00:25:12.654 --> 00:25:14.820
That's why there were three
of them, one big and two

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:15.930
little ones.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:19.110
Now that the bowls had seen the
girls and knew they were there,

00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:21.680
they were a problem.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:22.840
What could the bowls do?

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:23.830
She didn't know.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:25.720
Couldn't know exactly
without seeing them.

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:26.650
But they were metal.

00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:28.776
And it was metal in the
earth that gave them power.

00:25:28.776 --> 00:25:30.900
That's why she'd come to
the ice in the first place

00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:31.750
when she ran away.

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.242
Ice was a barrier that kept
her people's magic off.

00:25:34.242 --> 00:25:35.950
She insisted that the
bowls needed to go.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.866
But they couldn't come
into the station first.

00:25:37.866 --> 00:25:40.215
There was too much metal
there and they'd get loose.

00:25:40.215 --> 00:25:42.090
For now, they needed to
stay where they were,

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:45.100
out in the outskirts, in J-95.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:47.860
Carter kept shaking his
head in gentle disbelief--

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.400
the things I have
to put up with--

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:51.566
but was willing to go along
with any plan that would

00:25:51.566 --> 00:25:52.780
restore peace to the station.

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:54.988
We agreed that I'd bring
some shipping materials back

00:25:54.988 --> 00:25:56.920
to my bunk, pack
the bowls up there.

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.141
We'd get Riley to print a label
for me, just guess the postage.

00:26:00.141 --> 00:26:02.140
And when the mail bag
went out tomorrow morning,

00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:04.389
I'd meet her at the ramp as
she handed everything over

00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:05.860
to the plane's loadmaster.

00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.170
No hazmat stickers, nothing
fragile, just three metal

00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:12.420
bowls with bad juju that
were causing a stink.

00:26:12.420 --> 00:26:15.150
The sky was another
bluebird morning, as Poll 57

00:26:15.150 --> 00:26:17.070
landed the next day,
probably the first

00:26:17.070 --> 00:26:21.900
of six Hercules supply
planes we were going to get.

00:26:21.900 --> 00:26:23.704
I'd come down to the
ramp a little early.

00:26:23.704 --> 00:26:24.870
I liked watching the planes.

00:26:24.870 --> 00:26:27.360
And Carter had given me the
equivalent of a hall pass

00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:28.230
for the morning.

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:30.760
Sorry, Bill, I'm going to
be out for an hour or so.

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.815
Need to do something for Carter.

00:26:32.815 --> 00:26:34.440
I felt the cold on
my chin and listened

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.380
to the unearthly
crackling of ice crystals

00:26:36.380 --> 00:26:39.620
forming in the air, swirled
up by the enormous plane's

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:42.939
propellers as it pulled
abeam the cargo shed.

00:26:42.939 --> 00:26:44.480
I'd almost forgotten
what I was there

00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.510
for when Riley pulled up
behind me in a Ski-Doo,

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.395
dragging two green canvas bags
behind her in the banana sled.

00:26:50.395 --> 00:26:52.610
Is that my special delivery?

00:26:52.610 --> 00:26:54.680
--she asked, pointing
at the box at my feet.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.910
Yep.

00:26:55.910 --> 00:26:59.155
No liquids, hazardous materials,
drugs, firearms, or contraband?

00:26:59.155 --> 00:27:00.530
Hey, if I had
drugs, do you think

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:01.654
I'd be getting rid of them?

00:27:01.654 --> 00:27:02.806
Just got to ask.

00:27:02.806 --> 00:27:05.180
I'm legally post-master on
this godforsaken chunk of ice.

00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:07.700
So it's my ass in a can
if you ship something bad.

00:27:07.700 --> 00:27:09.567
Frankly, I like my
ass where it is.

00:27:09.567 --> 00:27:11.900
I had no idea whether that
was an invitation to comment.

00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:13.774
So I just put my hand
over my heart and said,

00:27:13.774 --> 00:27:15.530
I promise, no liquids,
drugs, firearms,

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.821
or whatever else you just said.

00:27:16.821 --> 00:27:18.180
Just three metal bowls.

00:27:18.180 --> 00:27:19.034
OK, give me here.

00:27:19.034 --> 00:27:19.700
See you tonight.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:22.962
I hear Baker John's making
cheesecake for dessert.

00:27:22.962 --> 00:27:24.920
From my desk in the lower
level of the station,

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.753
I heard the Herc depart,
the heavy thrumming

00:27:26.753 --> 00:27:29.690
of four big engines resonating
even through the thick walls.

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:30.967
You couldn't hear them land.

00:27:30.967 --> 00:27:33.050
But there were three more
departures that morning.

00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.258
And every time one left, I
felt another light blanket

00:27:35.258 --> 00:27:36.665
of calm descend over me.

00:27:36.665 --> 00:27:39.110
The past 24 hours had
been pretty rattling.

00:27:39.110 --> 00:27:41.360
And my dreams last
night had been restless.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:44.240
The stick figure man from the
bowls, pulling at my arms,

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.610
sliding flat like a shadow
across the wall of my bunk,

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:47.630
watching me.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:50.720
The running bird, now flying,
circling high over the snow.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:52.850
Only it, too, was a
shadow on my wall.

00:27:52.850 --> 00:27:54.830
I'd woken exhausted and
had to unpack the bowls

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.356
just to convince myself that
they were really still there.

00:27:58.356 --> 00:28:00.230
The afternoon went
quickly with menial tasks.

00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:01.510
And by the time we
knocked off for dinner,

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:03.801
I'd lost myself in the rhythm
of tracing network cables

00:28:03.801 --> 00:28:05.454
and reconfiguring servers.

00:28:05.454 --> 00:28:07.120
I caught Riley in the
galley as everyone

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.260
was lining up for the bell.

00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.801
Hey, thanks for the
help this morning

00:28:09.801 --> 00:28:10.840
with my mystery package.

00:28:10.840 --> 00:28:12.330
Good to have it out of here.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:13.330
Don't thank me just yet.

00:28:13.330 --> 00:28:15.402
You didn't hear
about the mechanical?

00:28:15.402 --> 00:28:17.530
What mechanical?

00:28:17.530 --> 00:28:20.059
Your Herc had a turbine failure
on launch, threw a blade.

00:28:20.059 --> 00:28:21.600
Turned around and
set back down here.

00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:22.141
They're fine.

00:28:22.141 --> 00:28:23.970
They're keeping it
warm until MacTown

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:26.610
can get parts and equipment
delivered-- probably tomorrow

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:28.580
morning, mid-afternoon.

00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:29.374
And the mail?

00:28:29.374 --> 00:28:30.040
Oh, don't worry.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.090
Offloaded everything,
put it back

00:28:31.090 --> 00:28:32.964
in the mail room--
federal procedure and all.

00:28:32.964 --> 00:28:34.256
Can't let it be left unguarded.

00:28:34.256 --> 00:28:34.755
Wait!

00:28:34.755 --> 00:28:35.920
So it's in the station?

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:38.320
Yeah, is that a problem?

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:41.250
Just-- just don't say
anything to Iqueta please?

00:28:41.250 --> 00:28:41.750
What?

00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:43.166
That your box
didn't go out today?

00:28:43.166 --> 00:28:44.442
You've kind of lost me.

00:28:44.442 --> 00:28:45.900
What does she have
to do with this?

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.860
Some kind of reverse
birthday present?

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:49.779
Oh, I don't know.

00:28:49.779 --> 00:28:50.820
It's kind of complicated.

00:28:50.820 --> 00:28:51.720
It's a superstition thing.

00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:54.150
I promised her I wouldn't bring
those bowls into the station.

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:55.590
Well, they're all
locked up and impounded.

00:28:55.590 --> 00:28:56.879
It's federally-protected mail.

00:28:56.879 --> 00:28:58.920
It's not like anyone could
get at them except me.

00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.795
And I'm not going to.

00:28:59.795 --> 00:29:03.110
Remember that bit
about my ass in a can.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:05.599
Is there any way I can take
the box back and keep it away

00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:07.015
from the station,
like it's cargo,

00:29:07.015 --> 00:29:08.970
or until it's ready to go?

00:29:08.970 --> 00:29:11.670
Legally, no.

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:14.370
OK, what if you happened
to weight the thing

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:16.380
and discovered that it
had insufficient postage?

00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:19.380
Like, I couldn't come up with
the extra until tomorrow?

00:29:19.380 --> 00:29:20.557
God, Karl, that's a stretch.

00:29:20.557 --> 00:29:21.640
Can't we just leave it be?

00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:23.015
I'll go out first
thing tomorrow.

00:29:23.015 --> 00:29:24.590
Pretty much no
one but you and me

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.250
are ever going to have to know--

00:29:26.250 --> 00:29:28.724
or care-- that it
wasn't already gone.

00:29:28.724 --> 00:29:30.640
I couldn't explain why
it was important to me.

00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:32.223
Maybe it was the
look in Iqueta's eyes

00:29:32.223 --> 00:29:33.760
when she saw me with the bowls.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:34.770
Maybe it was the dreams.

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.050
Please?

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:38.250
Jesus.

00:29:38.250 --> 00:29:41.589
OK, after dinner, after
the cheesecake, find me.

00:29:41.589 --> 00:29:43.380
And we'll go indulge
in your little felony.

00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:48.320
The air in the mail
room had an acid tang,

00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.690
the scent of something not
quite finished burning.

00:29:51.690 --> 00:29:53.550
The bag had spilled
open, as if slit.

00:29:53.550 --> 00:29:56.160
And there were scorch marks on
the floor, as if around a patch

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.135
that looked like electricity
had arced through.

00:29:58.135 --> 00:29:59.510
Shit, Karl, get
the extinguisher!

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:00.542
Is this your doing?

00:30:00.542 --> 00:30:02.250
I didn't think it was,
and I told her so,

00:30:02.250 --> 00:30:04.620
as I grabbed the red,
metal, CO2 extinguisher.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:06.930
There was no obvious fire,
at least, not anymore.

00:30:06.930 --> 00:30:08.460
But she called an
alert on comms.

00:30:08.460 --> 00:30:10.500
And the firefighters
were on their way.

00:30:10.500 --> 00:30:11.970
Pieces of mail had been singed.

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:15.390
And Riley dug through the slit
in the bag for the source.

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:17.674
It was my box, blackened
and cut through on one side,

00:30:17.674 --> 00:30:19.590
as though someone had
drawn thunderbolts on it

00:30:19.590 --> 00:30:20.790
with a flaming rod.

00:30:20.790 --> 00:30:22.880
Jesus, Karl, you promised!

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.330
They're just bowls, Riley.

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:25.260
Carter looked at them.

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:27.230
They're just metal bowls.

00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:30.450
By now, Don was at the doorway
in first-responder gear,

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:32.544
with Jake, Billy,
and Freya behind him.

00:30:32.544 --> 00:30:33.210
Riley looked up.

00:30:33.210 --> 00:30:34.210
Thanks for coming, boys.

00:30:34.210 --> 00:30:35.190
I think we've got this.

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.680
But I'd love it if you
could stay with us.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.486
Don advanced and
kneeled beside her.

00:30:40.486 --> 00:30:42.400
Uh, maybe we ought to
open that up for you.

00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:48.460
Billy, keep a bottle ready, OK?

00:30:48.460 --> 00:30:51.610
Billy stood to the side, nozzle
aimed at the charred box.

00:30:51.610 --> 00:30:53.680
We backed away, while Don
lowered his face guard,

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.112
slit the packing tape
away, pulled open the lid.

00:30:56.112 --> 00:30:57.820
The bulls were still
inside, still nested

00:30:57.820 --> 00:31:00.315
and undisturbed, except
for shreds of burnt paper.

00:31:00.315 --> 00:31:02.440
They were cool to the touch
as he lifted them clear

00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:04.390
and held them up for all to see.

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:07.480
On the side of the largest
one were the etched patterns--

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.980
the mountain with
the sun behind it,

00:31:08.980 --> 00:31:11.080
the man with the thunderbolts.

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.890
But now, there was
no running bird.

00:31:12.890 --> 00:31:14.690
In its place, there
was an etched drawing

00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:17.540
of a woman, long black hair tied
behind her with one hand held

00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:21.602
up, like a policeman,
as if to say, stop.

00:31:21.602 --> 00:31:22.185
AUDIENCE: Ooh!

00:31:26.097 --> 00:31:27.564
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:28.194 --> 00:31:29.360
DAVID PABLO COHN: Thank you.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:30.860
The fun thing, somebody
pointed out to me--

00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:32.860
it's like, we actually
don't know what happened.

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:39.770
Did Iqueta manage to,
like, ward them off?

00:31:39.770 --> 00:31:41.690
And that's kind of the--

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:45.680
or did-- I don't know.

00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:48.082
Any case-- so, yeah.

00:31:48.082 --> 00:31:49.540
When I started
that, all I know is,

00:31:49.540 --> 00:31:53.790
OK, let's imagine I ended
up with these bowls,

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.854
and I had no idea
where they came from.

00:31:56.854 --> 00:31:59.760
Mmrr.

00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:01.990
So let's see.

00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:03.940
Let me go back to my notes here.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:05.906
What was I going to talk about?

00:32:05.906 --> 00:32:07.420
So yeah, let me
talk a little bit

00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.650
about the writing process, which
I have already a little bit.

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:16.180
In a lot of the stories--

00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:20.930
actually, those two that I gave
you just the first lines of,

00:32:20.930 --> 00:32:23.930
it's pretty clear
that, chronologically,

00:32:23.930 --> 00:32:31.437
the first lines of the story
happen after everything

00:32:31.437 --> 00:32:32.270
that's in the story.

00:32:32.270 --> 00:32:34.147
It's like, we're at some point.

00:32:34.147 --> 00:32:34.980
How did we get here?

00:32:34.980 --> 00:32:37.520
We're going to step back
and just walk through.

00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:41.960
And I don't know how
other people write.

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.240
I figured out how to write
fiction just by writing it.

00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:48.200
I took a course with Sarah
Hotaling at Stanford,

00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:50.840
"Practicing the
Basics of Fiction."

00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:53.750
And the key thing on that
was, just write everyday.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.110
Actually, one of Neil Gaiman's
great bits of advice--

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:59.360
somebody asked-- yeah.

00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:01.330
He would say, yes, sir?

00:33:01.330 --> 00:33:02.330
The person in the back--

00:33:02.330 --> 00:33:04.370
I don't think it's anyone here--

00:33:04.370 --> 00:33:06.205
said, so I've also
wanted to be a writer.

00:33:06.205 --> 00:33:07.080
How do I get started?

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:08.644
And Gaiman said, well, depends.

00:33:08.644 --> 00:33:09.560
What do you write now?

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:11.390
And he said, mostly JavaScript.

00:33:14.276 --> 00:33:16.440
And he said, just write.

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.602
Imagine you have a million
words of crap in your head.

00:33:19.602 --> 00:33:21.060
And you can't get
to the good words

00:33:21.060 --> 00:33:23.780
until you've got those
first million out.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:26.030
So there's this process
called "morning pages."

00:33:26.030 --> 00:33:29.000
You get up-- first thing, just
sit and write for 20 minutes.

00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:30.880
It's stuff that's going
to get thrown away.

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.240
In fact, here, I can show you.

00:33:32.240 --> 00:33:33.130
Let me pop over here.

00:33:33.130 --> 00:33:34.520
Do I have morning pages here?

00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:38.910
Crazy screens.

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:41.008
Maybe it's over-- whoohoo!

00:33:45.770 --> 00:33:48.140
So this is my unedited
morning pages.

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.390
I've just got a couple of
sentences, a couple of notes

00:33:50.390 --> 00:33:52.570
on something I want to write.

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:54.080
Here are a few paragraphs.

00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:58.280
Most of it is utter crap.

00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.161
And most of it will never
see the light of day.

00:34:02.161 --> 00:34:02.660
And--

00:34:05.978 --> 00:34:07.890
AUDIENCE: You
misspelled my name.

00:34:07.890 --> 00:34:08.489
DAVID PABLO COHN:
Different Jeffrey.

00:34:08.489 --> 00:34:10.080
I think it's a
different Jeffrey.

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.580
I don't think he survives.

00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.900
AUDIENCE: Oh, no!

00:34:12.900 --> 00:34:15.300
DAVID PABLO COHN: Oh, yeah.

00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:16.679
Yeah, I'm sorry.

00:34:16.679 --> 00:34:19.907
Actually, he was dead before
the start of the story.

00:34:19.907 --> 00:34:21.365
AUDIENCE: Are you
going to read it?

00:34:21.365 --> 00:34:24.650
DAVID PABLO COHN: Uh, yeah.

00:34:24.650 --> 00:34:26.340
That's a really dark one.

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:27.630
I haven't finished yet.

00:34:27.630 --> 00:34:28.199
I don't know.

00:34:28.199 --> 00:34:29.698
But basically, I
write these things.

00:34:29.698 --> 00:34:32.820
And I circle back occasionally.

00:34:32.820 --> 00:34:35.010
And the goal is to do
it every single day

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:37.214
and not worry about
it being utter crap.

00:34:37.214 --> 00:34:38.380
And so I started doing that.

00:34:38.380 --> 00:34:39.921
And I spent the
first couple of years

00:34:39.921 --> 00:34:42.948
trying the traditional
publishing route.

00:34:42.948 --> 00:34:44.739
So when you take these
short story courses,

00:34:44.739 --> 00:34:46.364
there are all of
these literary fiction

00:34:46.364 --> 00:34:49.409
journals where you submit.

00:34:49.409 --> 00:34:51.420
And you wait.

00:34:51.420 --> 00:34:55.235
And you wait six to
nine, maybe 12 months.

00:34:55.235 --> 00:34:56.610
And you don't hear
anything back.

00:34:56.610 --> 00:34:57.510
And you prod them.

00:34:57.510 --> 00:34:58.530
And they say, oh, yeah.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:01.990
Um, yeah, if you haven't heard
back from us after 12 months,

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:05.040
then it's probably no.

00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:09.030
Actually, I just got a
rejection, last month,

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.470
from something I'd
submitted in 2014.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:15.310
So you want to be
a better writer?

00:35:15.310 --> 00:35:20.600
You can just sit there, waiting
by your inbox, waiting for--

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.980
no, sorry.

00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:25.900
We couldn't be bothered
to get back to you.

00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:29.250
That is a soul-crushing life.

00:35:29.250 --> 00:35:33.780
So what I decided, I followed--
less successfully so far--

00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:36.780
the Andy Weir model.

00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:38.850
I got to talk with Andy Weir.

00:35:38.850 --> 00:35:42.510
And he describes-- he's a techie
guy who just started writing

00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:44.490
and putting his stories online.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:46.630
And people subscribe
to his stories.

00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:49.780
And he quit his tech
job to write full-time.

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:50.970
And he was having a blast.

00:35:50.970 --> 00:35:53.460
And he had this kind
of serialized thing

00:35:53.460 --> 00:35:56.580
that some people said, well,
can you put this as an e-book,

00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:58.030
so I can read it all at once?

00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:59.550
Or can you make a PDF?

00:35:59.550 --> 00:36:02.730
And there's this story of
how that was "The Martian.

00:36:02.730 --> 00:36:07.157
And next, you've got Matt
Damon and Ridley Scott and all.

00:36:07.157 --> 00:36:07.990
And I talked to him.

00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:10.530
And I said, you
know, I like writing.

00:36:10.530 --> 00:36:12.914
I don't like this whole
trying to get published thing.

00:36:12.914 --> 00:36:13.830
And he said, it sucks.

00:36:13.830 --> 00:36:15.810
It completely sucks.

00:36:15.810 --> 00:36:17.490
Put your stuff out there.

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:18.210
And I did.

00:36:18.210 --> 00:36:19.210
And it was a revelation.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.590
I just created a
little medium.com site.

00:36:22.590 --> 00:36:26.100
And I also created a Patreon
page with the promise

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:29.580
that, every month, I would put
one new short story up online

00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:30.370
for free.

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:33.960
If you wanted to
support by pledging $1

00:36:33.960 --> 00:36:35.550
or whatever a
month, that's great.

00:36:35.550 --> 00:36:37.296
But you can read
everything for free.

00:36:37.296 --> 00:36:38.670
And it was just
this thing that--

00:36:38.670 --> 00:36:41.100
it commits me to have
something that I'm

00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.680
willing to show other
people once a month.

00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.180
And it was a
magnificent feeling.

00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.772
Because I put it up there.

00:36:46.772 --> 00:36:50.370
And I may have only
got 100 readers--

00:36:50.370 --> 00:36:52.710
add a couple of zeros
for Andy Weir there.

00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:54.780
10,000 readers, I think he has.

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:56.760
But these are people
who'd write back to me

00:36:56.760 --> 00:36:58.657
and say, I really
loved this part here.

00:36:58.657 --> 00:36:59.490
That was so awesome.

00:36:59.490 --> 00:37:02.320
And I've been here
or there or wherever.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.520
And it just gave me
these warm fuzzies

00:37:04.520 --> 00:37:06.600
and made me want to write
more and more and more.

00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:09.130
And two years in, I'd go back
and I'd read my early stories

00:37:09.130 --> 00:37:09.630
from there.

00:37:09.630 --> 00:37:13.230
And I'd go, I've
gotten a lot better.

00:37:13.230 --> 00:37:16.590
as I said, so far, the place
where the arc is right now--

00:37:16.590 --> 00:37:21.810
last week, one of my
more recent stories

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:27.390
just won first prize in the
"Palo Alto Weekly" short story

00:37:27.390 --> 00:37:28.560
contest.

00:37:28.560 --> 00:37:31.770
Now, I don't actually just
put the stories up un-checked.

00:37:31.770 --> 00:37:34.689
I have a friend of a friend,
a friend of the family, who

00:37:34.689 --> 00:37:35.730
is a professional editor.

00:37:35.730 --> 00:37:37.690
And she's a novelist herself.

00:37:37.690 --> 00:37:40.020
And I pay her an hourly rate.

00:37:40.020 --> 00:37:43.470
I think it's, like, $75 an
hour to read and edit and make

00:37:43.470 --> 00:37:44.555
suggestions.

00:37:44.555 --> 00:37:48.019
And so each story costs
me about $150 in editing.

00:37:48.019 --> 00:37:49.060
But we go back and forth.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:51.480
And Marilyn is actually--

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.850
because you can write
some really dark stuff.

00:37:53.850 --> 00:37:56.640
Marilyn has become, sort of,
half therapist, half editor.

00:38:00.570 --> 00:38:03.697
And occasionally--
with one of my stories,

00:38:03.697 --> 00:38:06.030
"Tales from the Ice," we went
back and forth five times.

00:38:06.030 --> 00:38:08.310
And she said, Pablo,
you don't really

00:38:08.310 --> 00:38:10.200
know what this story
is about, do you?

00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:10.860
I said, yeah.

00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:15.214
It's a bunch of guys hanging
around the summer camp

00:38:15.214 --> 00:38:17.130
lounge at the South Pole,
drinking and telling

00:38:17.130 --> 00:38:19.589
stories of people screwing up.

00:38:19.589 --> 00:38:20.130
She said, no.

00:38:20.130 --> 00:38:21.864
That's not what it's about.

00:38:21.864 --> 00:38:22.530
What's it about?

00:38:22.530 --> 00:38:24.840
She said, it's about leaving.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.930
Everyone in this story realizes
that they have to leave.

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:30.420
And it's a matter of
what control they want

00:38:30.420 --> 00:38:32.067
to exert over how they leave.

00:38:32.067 --> 00:38:33.150
And I looked at the story.

00:38:33.150 --> 00:38:34.470
I said, oh, my god!

00:38:34.470 --> 00:38:36.600
She's right.

00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:37.850
And I changed it a little bit.

00:38:37.850 --> 00:38:39.266
And it was a so
much better story.

00:38:39.266 --> 00:38:40.340
It was like, ooh.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.330
And when I put that last
paragraph on, afterwards,

00:38:43.330 --> 00:38:44.190
it was like shivers.

00:38:44.190 --> 00:38:46.080
It was, like, right.

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:49.410
So if you have a friend who
you can bounce stuff off with

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:54.030
or a writing buddy or an
editor, it's really worth it.

00:38:54.030 --> 00:38:56.610
But what happened
about six months ago

00:38:56.610 --> 00:39:03.910
was Marilyn pointed her
publisher at my medium.com

00:39:03.910 --> 00:39:04.540
page.

00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.450
And I got email from Ed Meyers,
Montemayor Press, saying, hey,

00:39:07.450 --> 00:39:10.300
would you mind if we put these
together in a published volume?

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.970
I said, but they're already
out there for free on the web.

00:39:12.970 --> 00:39:15.400
And he said, yeah, I know.

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:16.640
OK!

00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.370
And so, we've been
about six months

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:20.890
putting the book together.

00:39:20.890 --> 00:39:26.590
And it's really exciting.

00:39:26.590 --> 00:39:28.060
And I'm still writing.

00:39:32.015 --> 00:39:35.770
And one more note, before
I open for questions.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:37.312
I don't think I
have anything else.

00:39:37.312 --> 00:39:39.020
Yeah, I don't think
I have anything else.

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:43.950
So you can buy it on Amazon.

00:39:43.950 --> 00:39:47.090
You can also buy it at
Montemayor Press, directly

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:48.579
at the URL on my website.

00:39:48.579 --> 00:39:50.120
Or you can go to
your local bookstore

00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:51.980
and ask them to
order it for you.

00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:55.340
If you buy it for Amazon,
Montemayor Press and I each

00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:56.565
get about $1.

00:39:56.565 --> 00:39:59.150
And Amazon gets--
how much is the book?

00:39:59.150 --> 00:40:00.260
It's $16.95.

00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:02.240
And Amazon gets all of the rest.

00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.440
If you buy it from a bookstore,
the bookstore gets 40%.

00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:10.810
And the publisher
and I split the rest.

00:40:10.810 --> 00:40:14.730
And if you buy it from the
Montemayor Press directly,

00:40:14.730 --> 00:40:16.200
then they and I split it.

00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:19.050
So I'm going to encourage you,
if you don't pick one up here,

00:40:19.050 --> 00:40:22.830
to go to your local
bookstore and say, hey,

00:40:22.830 --> 00:40:25.130
can I order a copy of
"Eight in Three Weeks"

00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:28.714
by upcoming, award-winning,
local author David Pablo Cohn?

00:40:31.380 --> 00:40:34.110
But yeah, let me just
open for questions.

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:35.910
Oh, and actually how
many people here were

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:38.950
in my machine learning class?

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:40.090
Excellent, right.

00:40:40.090 --> 00:40:42.865
You remember the deal with
questions in the class?

00:40:47.090 --> 00:40:50.680
OK, so let me open
it for questions.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.660
AUDIENCE: So you talked about
getting paid $1 every month

00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:55.830
by a reader.

00:40:55.830 --> 00:40:58.260
And yet, multiply that by 100.

00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:03.090
And your cost is $150, so you're
losing money along the way.

00:41:06.390 --> 00:41:09.840
Economically, how
do you do this?

00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:12.750
DAVID PABLO COHN: That's
why I have another job.

00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:13.250
Hang on.

00:41:13.250 --> 00:41:16.100
I was going to show you some--

00:41:16.100 --> 00:41:17.250
di-be-da.

00:41:17.250 --> 00:41:19.740
Yeah, that's my desk.

00:41:25.370 --> 00:41:26.270
That's my desk.

00:41:26.270 --> 00:41:28.880
So I work part-time for
the US Antarctic program.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.330
I'm not at the
South Pole anymore.

00:41:30.330 --> 00:41:34.310
I'm working on the Nathaniel
B. Palmer, like, two or three

00:41:34.310 --> 00:41:36.020
months a year.

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:41.670
I've got some-- here, let me
do a brief commercial here.

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:44.581
How do we get out of-- escape.

00:41:44.581 --> 00:41:47.020
Add.

00:41:47.020 --> 00:41:49.368
Human software.

00:41:49.368 --> 00:41:51.900
Op, OK, there we are.

00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:53.834
And now, I want to
find something from--

00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:59.800
PowerPoint is not liking me.

00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:01.470
Minimize that.

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:04.400
Find QuickTime Player.

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:05.540
Sorry, I just have to--

00:42:08.984 --> 00:42:09.484
aah!

00:42:14.907 --> 00:42:15.893
So that's the ship.

00:42:21.316 --> 00:42:25.780
This is a journalist with
a drone who went along

00:42:25.780 --> 00:42:26.860
with us on the last--

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.461
so it's a desk job.

00:42:28.461 --> 00:42:29.585
It's a hell of a good desk.

00:42:35.200 --> 00:42:38.154
Yeah, and so basically I'm
tech support on a ship.

00:42:38.154 --> 00:42:39.820
Officially, I'm a
systems administrator.

00:42:39.820 --> 00:42:43.540
But in practice,
what I'm doing is

00:42:43.540 --> 00:42:46.390
rewriting the data
acquisition system

00:42:46.390 --> 00:42:48.790
that runs all of the sensors.

00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:51.610
And we've actually
convinced the NSF

00:42:51.610 --> 00:42:54.280
to allow us to open source
it, so research vessels

00:42:54.280 --> 00:43:00.790
all over the world can work
with a common bit of code.

00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:02.833
OK, let's see if I close it up--

00:43:02.833 --> 00:43:03.640
"doop."

00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.030
OK, next question.

00:43:06.030 --> 00:43:08.770
AUDIENCE: So when you did
the machine learning class,

00:43:08.770 --> 00:43:12.690
another nonfiction, one of
the things you have to do

00:43:12.690 --> 00:43:14.940
is make things unambiguous.

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:16.860
But when you do
the short stories,

00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:18.360
it seems like you
were intentionally

00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:21.753
making things ambiguous.

00:43:21.753 --> 00:43:23.620
And what do you
think about that?

00:43:23.620 --> 00:43:26.430
DAVID PABLO COHN:
That's a good question.

00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:30.357
So do you want, like, caramel
or double-dark chocolate?

00:43:30.357 --> 00:43:31.440
AUDIENCE: Oh, double-dark.

00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:31.939
Yeah.

00:43:31.939 --> 00:43:34.020
DAVID PABLO COHN: OK.

00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:36.104
There are plenty of
these for more questions,

00:43:36.104 --> 00:43:38.520
if somebody else wants to get
on queue while I work on it.

00:43:41.365 --> 00:43:42.790
I hadn't thought about that.

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:50.680
So some of my stories are--

00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:52.960
I guess what it is is
it's paying attention

00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:56.950
to what information
the words convey

00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:59.260
and being very tuned
into the nuances,

00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:03.400
so that if you want to be very
clear, you can be very clear.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.110
And if you want
to be unclear, you

00:44:05.110 --> 00:44:08.110
can basically say, warning,
warning-- ambiguity.

00:44:08.110 --> 00:44:10.750
And the other person
will actually know.

00:44:10.750 --> 00:44:13.300
So yeah, maybe it's
just trying to be tuned

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.972
into the nuances of the words.

00:44:15.972 --> 00:44:17.430
I hadn't thought
about that before.

00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:18.130
Thank you.

00:44:18.130 --> 00:44:19.588
And I need to get
you [INAUDIBLE]..

00:44:19.588 --> 00:44:22.180
AUDIENCE: In brief, do you
like, actually, writing?

00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:25.720
Or do you enjoy the more the
responses to your writing?

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:27.100
DAVID PABLO COHN: I like--

00:44:27.100 --> 00:44:31.640
actually, I don't particularly
like the sitting down

00:44:31.640 --> 00:44:33.070
and plowing through.

00:44:33.070 --> 00:44:36.310
What I like is when
I get that hook.

00:44:36.310 --> 00:44:39.736
It's sort of like when you're
surfing and you're-- paddle,

00:44:39.736 --> 00:44:40.360
paddle, paddle.

00:44:40.360 --> 00:44:40.880
And you don't get in.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:43.505
Paddle, paddle-- and then, when
you paddle and you get the wave

00:44:43.505 --> 00:44:45.160
and you see where
the story is going

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:47.020
and it's just crashing
towards the end

00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:50.470
and you hit that last
line, you go, yeah!

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:52.310
nailed it!

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:54.130
That's the real endorphin thing.

00:44:54.130 --> 00:44:58.530
And yeah, hadn't
thought about that.

00:44:58.530 --> 00:44:59.030
Cool.

00:44:59.030 --> 00:44:59.330
Good question.

00:44:59.330 --> 00:44:59.940
Oh right.

00:44:59.940 --> 00:45:02.640
So I've got a couple more of
the dark chocolate and a bunch

00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:04.890
of the caramelie things.

00:45:04.890 --> 00:45:05.450
Oh!

00:45:05.450 --> 00:45:06.200
AUDIENCE: Caramel.

00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.730
DAVID PABLO COHN: OK.

00:45:07.730 --> 00:45:09.470
I think they're caramel.

00:45:09.470 --> 00:45:10.430
AUDIENCE: Chocolate.

00:45:10.430 --> 00:45:13.280
DAVID PABLO COHN: Dark, yes.

00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:15.570
Whoop.

00:45:15.570 --> 00:45:16.565
Anyone else?

00:45:16.565 --> 00:45:17.290
We good?

00:45:17.290 --> 00:45:19.760
Oop.

00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:23.020
And I can give you a
couple more paragraphs

00:45:23.020 --> 00:45:24.290
at the end, once we're done.

00:45:24.290 --> 00:45:25.390
AUDIENCE: So you
describe the way

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:27.040
you do your short
novel by having

00:45:27.040 --> 00:45:28.362
an interesting first sentence.

00:45:28.362 --> 00:45:29.320
DAVID PABLO COHN: Yeah.

00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:30.820
AUDIENCE: Do you
think, if you could

00:45:30.820 --> 00:45:33.587
invent six interesting
sentences like that, turn that

00:45:33.587 --> 00:45:35.050
into a novel, saying they all--

00:45:35.050 --> 00:45:35.230
DAVID PABLO COHN: No.

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:37.146
AUDIENCE: --have to be
part of the same thing?

00:45:37.146 --> 00:45:38.780
DAVID PABLO COHN:
No, the problem

00:45:38.780 --> 00:45:42.010
is that I can't seem to
get stuff to hold together.

00:45:45.418 --> 00:45:48.970
I have a novel that I've
rewritten four times now.

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:52.630
And it's just, like, there are
these beautiful short arcs,

00:45:52.630 --> 00:45:54.490
but they don't line up.

00:45:54.490 --> 00:45:57.230
I can't get the person--

00:45:57.230 --> 00:46:00.880
he's supposed to be
in Monrovia, Liberia.

00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:04.120
But the way the story
goes, he's in Thailand

00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:05.770
with absolutely no--

00:46:05.770 --> 00:46:06.940
why would he go to--

00:46:06.940 --> 00:46:09.230
why would he go to--

00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:11.500
yah!

00:46:11.500 --> 00:46:13.210
And these two
people actually are

00:46:13.210 --> 00:46:16.030
supposed to be the same
person for this arc to work.

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:17.486
And I can't--

00:46:17.486 --> 00:46:19.732
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
Martin has a process

00:46:19.732 --> 00:46:24.940
where he rewrites every novel,
like, umpteen times, which

00:46:24.940 --> 00:46:26.072
is why it's slow.

00:46:26.072 --> 00:46:27.280
DAVID PABLO COHN: Yeah, yeah.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:27.730
AUDIENCE: But a writ--

00:46:27.730 --> 00:46:29.990
AUDIENCE: Maybe eventually,
it will work out.

00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:31.315
Oh, sorry.

00:46:31.315 --> 00:46:33.520
AUDIENCE: A writer's
existential question-- once you

00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:36.280
have those eight
sentences, how long do

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:38.830
you think it would be before
you can throw a machine learning

00:46:38.830 --> 00:46:43.370
process at it and come out with
stories where it's hard to tell

00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:47.740
whether I wrote it, Pablo wrote
it, or a machine in the cloud

00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:49.390
wrote it?

00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:52.180
DAVID PABLO COHN: I've
read some draft novels

00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.340
that I think were at
that point already.

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:55.641
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:56.140 --> 00:46:59.410
I guess the question
is, how long will it

00:46:59.410 --> 00:47:01.540
be before we can
get something where

00:47:01.540 --> 00:47:04.882
we can't tell who wrote it and
we'd actually like to read.

00:47:04.882 --> 00:47:05.465
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:47:08.864 --> 00:47:11.280
DAVID PABLO COHN: Yeah, I think
we're actually out of time

00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.270
here.

00:47:12.270 --> 00:47:14.070
So anyone else?

00:47:14.070 --> 00:47:14.820
Thank you so much.

00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:15.120
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.020
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:16.020 --> 00:47:17.570
AUDIENCE: Whoo!
