00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.050
Let's do some more word
problems. And this first one's

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:04.660
a bit of a classic.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.020
Brit has $2.25 in nickels
and dimes.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.750
If she has 40 coins in total,
how many of each

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.175
coin does she have?

00:00:15.175 --> 00:00:17.770
So let's define some
variables here.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.175
Let's let n equal the number
of nickels she has.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:37.810
And let d is equal to the
number of dimes she has.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.010
So let's see, the first thing we
know is that she has $2.25

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.690
in nickels and dimes.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.760
So how much money
does she have?

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.330
Well, if you take the number
of nickels, each nickel is

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:49.630
worth $0.05.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:57.030
So the number of nickels times
0.05, that's how much money

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.790
her nickels represent,
plus the amount of

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.270
money her dimes represent.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.290
So she's got d dimes.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.940
They're each worth 0.1 of a
dollar, or .10, or 0.10 if we

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.070
want to put the 0 in front
of the decimal.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.490
So this is the total amount
of money she has.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.390
If she has 5 nickels, you'd do
5 times $0.05, it'd be $0.25.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.370
If she had 4 dimes, that'd be
$0.40, and you would add it

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.940
all together.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.550
Now, the problem tells us that
the total amount of money she

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.400
has is $2.25.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:36.210
So this the first statement
right there can be translated

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.180
into this equation right here.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.620
She has a certain number
of nickels and a

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.930
certain number of dimes.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.760
You multiply $0.05 times the
nickels, plus $0.10 times the

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.930
number of dimes, you
end up with 225.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.400
Now, this second statement,
she has 40 coins in total.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.790
And I'm assuming that she only
has nickels and dimes, that

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.470
there aren't any other coins.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:59.380
So 40 coins in total, that
means that the number of

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.820
nickels plus the number of dimes
has to be equal to 40.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:11.590
So the nickels plus the dimes
has got to be equal to 40.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.020
That's what that information
tells us.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.440
Now, we have two equations with
two unknowns, and there's

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.530
two ways we can do this.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.050
We can do this as a system,
and we can subtract one

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.400
equation from the other.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:23.490
Or we can do substitution.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.030
Let's do substitution.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.010
That's often a more intuitive
way to do it.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:30.650
So what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to solve for-- I

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.800
could solve for either one-- but
I want to solve for-- I'll

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.030
solve for d and then I'll
substitute whatever I get for

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.670
the d in this equation
right here.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.070
So if we subtract n from both
sides of this equation-- so

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.710
let me do that.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:45.760
Negative n plus this, minus n.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.350
Obviously, these cancel out and
you're just left with d is

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.900
equal to 40 minus n.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.460
Now, we can take this.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:56.500
We just established using the
second equation, using this

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.480
second statement, that d is
equal to 40 minus the number

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:01.620
of nickels.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.790
And we can use that to
substitute back in for d.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:11.770
So this first equation will
now become 0.05 times our

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.890
number of nickels, plus 0.--
I'll just write 0.1-- times

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.790
our number of dimes.

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.040
We already know that the
number of dimes is

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:22.200
equal to 40 minus n.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.470
That's what that second
statement told us.

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.820
So instead of d, I'm going to
substitute it with 40 minus n.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.670
40-- that's the number of dimes
we have. It's 40 minus

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.750
the number of nickels, and
that is equal to $2.25.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.450
And now we can just try
to solve for n.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:47.720
So we get a 0.05n plus .1
times 40, that is 4.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.130
Let me show you that I'm
distributing it.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:57.970
So .1 times 40, that is 4 minus
0.1n-- I just distribute

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:07.030
this times each of these terms--
is equal to $2.25.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:08.530
And then what can we do?

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:16.199
Well, we can take .05 minus .1--
or your .10, depending on

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:19.285
how you want to do it-- if you
take those two terms, you're

00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:28.870
actually going to get a negative
0.05n minus .10--

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.870
this is twice as big as that,
so it's going to get a

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.820
negative number-- plus 4--
so I still have that

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.370
4-- is equal to $2.25.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.220
Now I can subtract 4 from both
sides of this equation.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:47.250
I get negative 0.05n is equal
to-- if you subtract 4 from

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.840
the left, that 4's going to go
away-- you subtract 4 over

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:59.020
here; 2.25 minus 4-- that's
negative 1.75.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.490
All right.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:02.020
Now we can multiply both sides
of this equation by negative

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.960
1, just to make it a little bit
cleaner, so that becomes a

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.280
plus and a plus.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.390
And then divide both
sides by .05.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.200
I could have just divided both
sides by negative .05 to begin

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.160
with, but I like getting
everything positive.

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:24.640
So if you divided by 0.05, you
get n is equal to $1.75

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.176
divided by 0.05.

00:05:28.176 --> 00:05:30.235
So let's do this division.

00:05:30.235 --> 00:05:32.750
Let me do it in a
different color.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:40.880
0.05 divided into $1.75--
let's multiply both the

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:43.680
divisor and the dividend
by 100.

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.710
So we're going to go over two
decimal spaces, so this just

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.080
becomes a 5.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.270
This becomes 175.

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:53.450
This is the same thing
as 175 divided by 5.

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:56.330
5 goes into 17 three times.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:59.160
3 times 5 is 15.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.480
17 minus 15 is 2.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.370
Bring down the 5.

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.080
25.

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.260
5 goes into 25 five times.

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:10.400
5 times 5 is 25.

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.740
You have no remainder.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.830
So this is equal to 35.

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:19.170
So n is equal to 35, and now we
can solve for d. d is equal

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.440
to 40 minus n.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:25.960
So d is equal to 40 minus
35, which is equal to 5.

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:33.310
So we have 5 dimes
and 35 nickels.

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:38.970
And just to verify that that
actually does make sense, 35

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.600
nickels are going to
be worth how much?

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:44.210
Well 35 times 5 cents is
going to get us to

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:47.400
175 cents or $1.75.

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:53.890
So this times 35, that is going
to be $1.75 in nickels.

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:57.170
35 times 5 or times .05,
depending on how you

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:58.060
want to view it.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.150
And then this is
going to be 5.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.740
So this right here is going
to be $0.50 in dimes.

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.200
$1.75 plus $0.50,
that's $2.25.

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:11.280
Let's do one more.

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.480
A pattern of squares is
out together-- oh.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:18.620
A pattern of squares is
out together as shown.

00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:19.870
I guess they're hanging out.

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.340
How many squares are in
the 12th diagram?

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:23.150
So let's see what's happening.

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:29.280
So this is the first, that is
the second, that is the third.

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.830
Let's see here, each side, this
is a 1 by 1 square, and

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.720
then here it's 2 by 2, but then
they take out this block

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.140
right over there.

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.170
So let's see.

00:07:40.170 --> 00:07:44.020
So one way you could think about
it is this is 2 by 2,

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:51.250
and this is a 3 by 3, but they
took out the 2 by 2.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:57.120
And so the next one is going to
be a 4 by 4 where they took

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.140
out the 3 by 3.

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:05.000
So I guess one way that we can
describe the number of

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.826
squares-- actually, the easiest
way, you don't have to

00:08:07.826 --> 00:08:14.780
think about that is, look, I
have 3 here, and then I have 3

00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:16.340
minus 1 over here.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:18.150
Let me do that in a
different color.

00:08:18.150 --> 00:08:20.570
3 minus 1 over here.

00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:25.220
Here I have 2, and here
I have 2 minus 1.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:27.740
And then here I have 1, and then
here I have 1 minus 1.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.840
I have nothing.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.799
So in general, the number of
squares for any n is going to

00:08:33.799 --> 00:08:43.169
be n plus, then we
have n minus 1.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:48.910
Plus n minus 1, which is the
same thing as 2n minus 1.

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:50.300
And it works, right.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:51.290
2n minus 1.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.550
2 times 3 minus 1 is 5.

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:55.890
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:08:55.890 --> 00:08:57.350
So works for these three.

00:08:57.350 --> 00:09:01.520
So the 12th square, so when n is
equal to 12, it's going to

00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:06.460
be 2 times 12 minus 1, which is
equal to 24 minus 1, which

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:12.710
is equal to 23 squares
in the 12th diagram.

00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:15.450
Actually, I said lets do only
one, let's do another one.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:17.610
We're in the zone.

00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:21.470
Grace starts biking at
12 miles per hour.

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:26.220
1 hour later, Dan starts biking
at 15 miles per hour.

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:29.900
Following the same route, how
long will it take him to catch

00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:31.430
up with Grace?

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:39.940
So let t equal the time
Grace is biking.

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.510
Actually, let me
do it this way.

00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:48.180
Let me do it the time
Dan is biking.

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.010
Then how long will
Grace be biking?

00:09:51.010 --> 00:09:53.430
Well, he starts an hour-- let's
see, did I say, yeah--

00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:55.420
an hour later, he starts.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:09:58.380
So whatever number this is,
Grace is going to be biking

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:59.390
for 1 more hour.

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:07.370
So t plus 1 is equal to
time Grace is biking.

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.025
When this is 0 this
is going to be 1.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:13.480
She will have already been
biking for 1 hour.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.240
And we just have to remember
that distance is equal to rate

00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.990
times time.

00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:28.450
So Dan's distance is going to
be equal to 15 miles an hour

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:30.580
times the time in hours.

00:10:30.580 --> 00:10:32.250
This is Dan's distance.

00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.630
And then Grace's distance--
maybe I'll call that g, or

00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:42.420
let's say D for Grace, that's
her distance as well-- is

00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:45.500
going to be equal to
12 miles an hour.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.730
And her time in terms of t
is going to be t plus 1.

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:50.280
She's going to be always
be traveling for 1

00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:52.090
more hour than Dan.

00:10:52.090 --> 00:10:54.350
12 times t plus 1.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:10:57.290
And the point at which they
catch up, that's the point at

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:59.380
which these two things are
going to be equal to.

00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.330
That Dan's distance
is going to be

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.760
equal to Grace's distance.

00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:07.260
So we just have to set these two
to be equal to each other.

00:11:07.260 --> 00:11:13.750
So you get 15t is going to be
equal to-- that is how far Dan

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.910
has been riding his bike-- and
then it's going to be equal to

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:20.080
12 times t plus 1.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:22.020
That is how far Grace
has ridden her bike.

00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:25.270
And remember, her time is always
going to be 1 hour more

00:11:25.270 --> 00:11:26.290
than Dan's.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.720
So let's just solve for time.

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:36.350
So we get 15t is equal
to 12t plus 1.

00:11:36.350 --> 00:11:39.010
12t plus 1.

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:43.810
And then if we subtract 12--
I'm sorry, 12t plus 12-- I

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.190
don't want to make
a mistake there.

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:47.840
If we subtract 12t from
both sides, you get

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:52.940
3t is equal to 12.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:56.940
Divide both sides by 3-- let me
scroll down a little bit--

00:11:56.940 --> 00:11:59.990
you get t is equal to 4.

00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:05.290
So after 4 hours, after Dan has
been riding for 4 hours,

00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:07.400
he will catch up with Grace.

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:12.240
This is Dan, and if Dan's ridden
for 4 hours, Grace has

00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:14.370
been riding for 6 hours.

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:17.060
6 hours is how far Grace
has ridden for.

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:23.030
And Dan after 4 hours,
4 times 15, he would

00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:25.860
have gone 60 miles.

00:12:25.860 --> 00:12:30.220
And Grace after-- sorry, there's
1 more, this isn't a

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:32.300
six-- she goes 1 more
hour than Dan.

00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:35.000
So it's 5, she's traveled
for 5 hours.

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.730
So Grace would have gone 5 hours
at 12 miles an hour.

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:46.100
And that, once again,
is also 60 miles.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:50.480
So they meet at exactly
the 60 mile mark.
