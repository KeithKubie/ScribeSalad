00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:10.019
Vaportini is a device that lets people inhale
alcohol. And this parasite eats the tongue

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.690
of a fish, hooks itself into the muscles of
the tongue stub, and becomes its new tongue.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.110
Vsauce, Kevin here. This is Mind Blow.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:26.110
This DNA gun invisibly tracks criminals for
weeks. Developed by UK-based company Selectamark,

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:33.160
the High Velocity DNA Tagging System fires
small, soft, green pellets, kind of like a

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.559
paintball, filled with a unique DNA code that
can penetrate clothing and mark a suspects

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:43.170
skin. The idea is to mark criminals during
a riot so they can be arrested later when

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.809
DNA tag is revealed using a UV light.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.780
The Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam, Germany
has an interactive floor that creates a computer-generated

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.979
reflection of you. The video screen floor
is touch-sensitive and the system uses an

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:03.269
infrared camera and high-resolution projector.
It tracks footsteps and beams video up to

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:08.670
the glass. The hope is that this technology
eventually leads to new ways of playing games,

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.790
controlling objects in the home, or assisting
disabled people.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.320
The Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering
department at NC State University has developed

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.960
self-healing stretchable wires. The wire is
made of a gallium liquid-metal alloy, and

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.710
a self-healing polymer that heals it both
mechanically and electrically after being

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.210
severed with scissors.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:35.980
"Dear Diary. Today I's made a desk wit a pillow
on it. So's I can sleeps on my desk. Yeah!"

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.680
Engineers in Taiwan are developing displays
for fingertips. The point is to still be able

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.720
to see the display on your smartphone or tablet
while your thumb is obscuring it. It even

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.300
enlarges the view so it's easier to tap small
buttons on a 2.5 cm diagonal OLED screen.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.470
And, you can also see and answer incoming
calls with it.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.390
The Artificial Photosynthesis System is being
developed by Panasonic and is producing organic

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.340
materials with the efficiency of real plants
used in biomass energy. It uses sunlight to

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.940
produce oxygen from water and carbon dioxide,
and they hope to use this to solve global

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.000
warming and energy problems. Find the link
below for more.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.280
Kilobots are tiny, cheap robots that are being
used to research swarm algorithms. Designed

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.830
by a research group at Harvard, they cost
about $14 each, are 33 mm in diameter, and

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.830
can communicate with neighbors up to 7 cm.
Now, let's just watch them swarm for a second.

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.569
Okay.

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.569
The University of Southern California did
a real-time MRI study of human beatboxing.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.550
This allows researchers to visualize the movement
of the vocal tract from the upper trachea,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:56.280
to the lips, and the opening and closing of
the vocal folds, to help study the mechanisms that

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:01.120
produce various sounds.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:08.120
Finally, the Monterey Bay Aquarium has a great
video of the Lobed Comb Jelly which has comb

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:16.180
rows that diffract light as they swim...

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.520
I'm gonna leave you with sperm from two males
competing within the reproductive tract of

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:37.520
a female fruit fly...Seriously...and, as always,
thanks for watching.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:07.940
"I have such a large selection of crackers
in my grocery store. It's a Mind Blow."

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.930
"Wait, what's a mind blow?"

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.770
"Ah, I've been waiting for you Vsauce."

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.600
"Darth Vader, why are you working in a grocery
store?"

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.120
"I'm Chad Vader, and I don't work here, I
rule here! As day shift manager...Click here

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.419
to check out the latest season of Chad Vader..."

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:52.690
"Oh...and, as always?"

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:59.690
"And, as always, thanks for choosing the dark
soul half."

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.960
"Eh...close enough."
