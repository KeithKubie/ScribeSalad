people training them supporting them and

00:00:36.509 --> 00:00:36.519
people training them supporting them and
 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.819

confidence and compassion you can see
that all through research going way back

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550
that all through research going way back
 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.970
that all through research going way back
those are the people who tend to rise to

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980
those are the people who tend to rise to
 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.229
those are the people who tend to rise to
the leadership positions in

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239
the leadership positions in
 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.119
the leadership positions in
pre-industrial tribes and those are the

00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:54.129
pre-industrial tribes and those are the
 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.099
pre-industrial tribes and those are the
people who we also want as our leaders

00:00:56.099 --> 00:00:56.109
people who we also want as our leaders
 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:00:58.590
people who we also want as our leaders
so at the most abstract level that's who

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600
so at the most abstract level that's who
 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.959
so at the most abstract level that's who
that's who we want to lead us as human

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969
that's who we want to lead us as human
 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.229
that's who we want to lead us as human
beings but but at different times the

question of what somebody who's got your

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:06.820
question of what somebody who's got your
 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.940
question of what somebody who's got your
back or is compassionate I think that

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950
back or is compassionate I think that
 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.069
back or is compassionate I think that
gets reinterpreted so so one of the

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079
gets reinterpreted so so one of the
 

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:13.050
gets reinterpreted so so one of the
issues that the Millennials have which

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060
issues that the Millennials have which
 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.270
issues that the Millennials have which
for example my parents my parents didn't

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280
for example my parents my parents didn't
 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.090
for example my parents my parents didn't
have and even my generation to a lesser

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100
have and even my generation to a lesser
 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.020
have and even my generation to a lesser
extent is that first of all that they

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030
extent is that first of all that they
 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.149
extent is that first of all that they
want both men and women want to be more

00:01:24.149 --> 00:01:24.159
want both men and women want to be more
 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:25.620

so in that case having a job where

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450
so in that case having a job where
 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.690
so in that case having a job where
you're working 75 hours a week doesn't

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:30.700

you're working 75 hours a week doesn't
work out too well for everyone and

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200
work out too well for everyone and
 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.050
work out too well for everyone and

parents or even to some extent my
 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:40.740
parents or even to some extent my
generation and I definitely see this at

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750
generation and I definitely see this at
 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.770
generation and I definitely see this at
Stanford with my students is boy did I

my family and other families you'd see
 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:49.859
my family and other families you'd see
that somebody would work for a large

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869
that somebody would work for a large
 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.480
that somebody would work for a large
corporation for years and would be okay

you've been layoffs are at an all-time
 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.020
you've been layoffs are at an all-time
high and in fact there's evidence it

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030
high and in fact there's evidence it
 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.640

isn't just the economic times that

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650
isn't just the economic times that
 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.480
isn't just the economic times that
layoffs are becoming a more

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490
layoffs are becoming a more
 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.460
layoffs are becoming a more
increasingly an increasingly sort of

frequent response to economic troubles
they happen quicker and they happen

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560
they happen quicker and they happen
 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.620
they happen quicker and they happen
deeper and then there there's fewer

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630
deeper and then there there's fewer
 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.940

essentially the employment contract has
 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.390
essentially the employment contract has
changed so so my perspective on the

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400
changed so so my perspective on the
 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.860
changed so so my perspective on the
Millennials is no wonder you act that

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870
Millennials is no wonder you act that
 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.300
Millennials is no wonder you act that
way you you've been taught that the

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310

the woman if you're working for somebody
like Meg Whitman or something or Carly

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110
like Meg Whitman or something or Carly
 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.570
like Meg Whitman or something or Carly
Fiorina who actually laid off lots of

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580
Fiorina who actually laid off lots of
 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.740
Fiorina who actually laid off lots of
people Meg didn't lay off very many

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750
people Meg didn't lay off very many
 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.180
people Meg didn't lay off very many
people so so so in some ways the

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190
people so so so in some ways the
 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.320
people so so so in some ways the
Millennials are acting completely

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.330
Millennials are acting completely
 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.290
Millennials are acting completely
rational and it and therefore I guess

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300
rational and it and therefore I guess
 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.710
rational and it and therefore I guess
the definition of a competent and

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720
the definition of a competent and
 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.020
the definition of a competent and
compassionate boss changes it's it's

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.030
compassionate boss changes it's it's
 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.650
compassionate boss changes it's it's
somebody who is skilled at I'm giving

00:02:59.650 --> 00:02:59.660
somebody who is skilled at I'm giving
 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.870
somebody who is skilled at I'm giving
you the skills and abilities and

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:01.880
you the skills and abilities and
 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.250
you the skills and abilities and
connections you need to continue

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260
connections you need to continue
 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:04.720
connections you need to continue
throughout your career even after they

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730
throughout your career even after they
 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.990
throughout your career even after they
fire you so so I thought do you think

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000
fire you so so I thought do you think
 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.330
fire you so so I thought do you think
that relationship has changed some and I

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340
that relationship has changed some and I
 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.220

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700
 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.030
so the notion is in a business book

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040
so the notion is in a business book
 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.559
so the notion is in a business book
author I should probably make the
