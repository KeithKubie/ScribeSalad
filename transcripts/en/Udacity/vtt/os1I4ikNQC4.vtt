00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So congratulations.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm impressed you made it so far.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
You really learned a lot about SLAM.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
You learned about the MAP, which is a sequence of coordinates,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
and you learned about Localization--

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
and "L" and "M" are really important letters here.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The Simultaneous and the And are not that essential.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We put all of those into a big Matrix, Omega, and a vector, Xi.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And every time, we got some relative information between poses.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We carved out some stuff in here

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or we measured something.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We added some stuff in here, and over here.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
These were all just additions

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and, as we now understand,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
those implement the straightforward constraints

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
that come from the motion--the measurements.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And then the key thing was that you could solve,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
with a simple piece of equation,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
for the Path and the Map at the same time.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
That was quite an amazing achievement.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So you've implemented this,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
you've implemented your first SLAM algorithm.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That was way beyond anything I ever taught

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
students at Stanford in a single class.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Congratulations for doing this.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So this is the last, and final, class.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I'm going to output a challenge to everybody, briefly,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
where you can write a Robot program

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
that puts most of the stuff we talked about together.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
But, for now, congratulations for making it so far.

00:01:19.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That is really impressive.
