You know that
one teacher that everybody has

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.920
that nobody respected? You know,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.889
everybody just knew, first day
of class everybody just knew.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.922
You just looked at each other,
all the kids, and nonverbally

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.864
they were just like. With their
minds they'd be like, we're

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:17.840
going to fuck with him until he
quits right?

00:00:44.444 --> 00:00:46.413
Thank you everybody.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:47.881
So if you donít know,
here's what the show is. It's

00:00:47.915 --> 00:00:51.385
just a bunch of funny people
telling 100% true stories.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:54.388
Tonight's topic is childhood.
Ladies and gentlemen, Ari

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:59.593
Shaffir. So, I got this
Facebook message from this girl

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:02.663
[bleep] [bleep] once. And by the
way, I'm going to say this name

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:05.566
[bleep] [bleep] a lot in this
and they're going to bleep it

00:01:05.599 --> 00:01:09.469
every time on television. But
you guys should just all know

00:01:09.503 --> 00:01:11.939
that when you hear a bleep
that's because I'm saying the

00:01:11.972 --> 00:01:19.580
name [bleep] [bleep].
So I got this Facebook message.

00:01:19.613 --> 00:01:21.481
You ever get a Facebook message
from somebody that's like from

00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:23.217
high school or something, "Well,
hey, we drifted apart." And

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.987
you're like, "I know, we did it
on purpose. Why are you ruining

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:31.158
what we built up for so long?"
So [bleep] [bleep] wrote me and

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:33.327
she goes, "Ari I noticed you
have a lot of Twitter followers

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.230
Facebook friends and I'm in some
online contest to win a trip to

00:01:36.263 --> 00:01:39.099
the Superbowl and if you tell
them all to vote for me in this

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:42.336
online contest I could win this
trip to the Superbowl."

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.173
And my first thought was, "Go
fuck yourself. I barely even

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:49.676
know you, no fucking way." But
since I barely knew her, I felt

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.247
super obligated to do everything
she asked of me. You know that

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.383
weird dynamic. Where like, like
if your best friend asked you

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:58.852
for a ride to the airport. Your
best friend. You can be like,

00:01:58.886 --> 00:02:04.191
"You can get a ride to lick my
asshole. There's a shuttle

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:07.094
leaving every four minutes right
there. Just cut it under there,

00:02:07.127 --> 00:02:10.531
it needs licking." But, no, I'll
never take you to the airport.

00:02:10.564 --> 00:02:14.768
You can go fuck yourself. Eat a
plate of shit. I'd rather watch

00:02:14.801 --> 00:02:19.139
you eat a plate of shit than
ever take you to the airport. In

00:02:19.173 --> 00:02:20.874
fact, now you know what now, if
I happen to see you at the

00:02:20.908 --> 00:02:23.877
airport I'm going to punch you
in the dick so you associate me

00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:27.548
and the airport with bad
thoughts together. That's your

00:02:27.581 --> 00:02:31.084
best friend. Like if somebody
you met at work like a month

00:02:31.084 --> 00:02:33.220
ago, if they asked you for a
ride to the airport then it's

00:02:33.253 --> 00:02:35.656
super uncomfortable. How do you
say no to that? It's always

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:41.562
like, "Um, uh." You thought
you'd think of any excuse

00:02:41.595 --> 00:02:44.631
possible. You're like, "You
know, I work nights." "Oh, it's

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:50.437
a daytime thing? Uh, I guess
we're going to the airport!"

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.406
There's just no way around it.
So I didn't know if I

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.708
should say yes or no to [bleep]
[bleep]. So, here's what I

00:02:54.741 --> 00:02:56.510
thought. I thought that I'll
look back to when I liked her

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:59.780
the most and if I would do it
for that person, then I would

00:02:59.813 --> 00:03:01.882
still help her. I'll tell
everybody to fucking vote for

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:04.785
her in this online contest. And
so when I liked [bleep] the

00:03:04.818 --> 00:03:06.854
most, when I liked her the most
was the ninth grade. She was the

00:03:06.887 --> 00:03:08.689
hottest girl in my ninth grade
class. Like by far the hottest

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:12.059
one. She always wore a miniskirt
which, to an all Jewish school

00:03:12.059 --> 00:03:16.063
meant she wore it like right on
the line. That was as low as you

00:03:16.063 --> 00:03:19.066
were allowed to go. Most girls
wore it sock or below. Not this

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:24.238
slut, uh uh. Rockin' some knee
at thirteen. She was so fucking

00:03:24.271 --> 00:03:27.441
hot, man. That was as high as
you were allowed, too.

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:29.810
We had this rule where if a
Rabbi, if a Rabbi saw a girl in

00:03:29.843 --> 00:03:31.845
a miniskirt, he would just yell
out the word "knees". He would

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.681
just go, "Knees!" And she would
have to get on her knees in

00:03:34.715 --> 00:03:39.953
front of the Rabbi. [crowd
laughs] It's not sexual, you

00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:46.460
guys. It's not a Catholic
school, it's a Jewish school.

00:03:46.493 --> 00:03:55.102
Relax. What, "oh?" Who's still
Catholic, by the way? Enough.

00:03:55.102 --> 00:03:58.305
What else are you waiting for?
Like what other sign do you need

00:03:58.338 --> 00:04:01.508
to not be Catholic anymore? I'm
not saying don't be Christian,

00:04:01.542 --> 00:04:03.744
you can keep being Christian,
but just join another Jesus

00:04:03.777 --> 00:04:08.282
club. There's like thirty
different Jesus clubs, right?

00:04:08.315 --> 00:04:11.318
They're all pretty much the same
shit. Love Jesus and hate the

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:16.456
Jews. Is that pretty much?
Except one of the clubs loves to

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:22.296
rape children. Don't be a part
of that club anymore. And if

00:04:22.329 --> 00:04:24.498
you're like, "Oh, are you just
hearing about this right now? Am

00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:28.135
I just breaking the news to
you?" Yeah, its been going on

00:04:28.168 --> 00:04:32.973
for a while. "For like months?"
Even longer than that. Like

00:04:33.073 --> 00:04:41.582
1,500 years, continuous child
rape. It's totally trending. Be

00:04:41.615 --> 00:04:45.085
Protestant, be Methodist,
whatever. Be Mor-. Don't be

00:04:45.085 --> 00:04:52.159
Mormon, obviously not. But like,
be one of the other ones.

00:04:52.192 --> 00:04:54.161
My friend, Steve, he's
a Catholic and I tell him this

00:04:54.194 --> 00:04:56.563
all the time Iím like, "Dude,
you gotta.." And he goes, "Ari,

00:04:56.597 --> 00:04:58.699
I get what you're saying. I
understand what you're saying.

00:04:58.732 --> 00:05:00.434
You have to understand,
tradition is really important to

00:05:00.467 --> 00:05:06.306
me and my grandfather was raped
here and I want one day for

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.611
my.." Alright. Anyway,
it was nothing sexual. Our rule

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:13.847
was if they were on the ground
and the skirt didn't touch the

00:05:13.881 --> 00:05:15.749
ground it was considered
immodest. It was a half day

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:22.556
suspension. See the difference
there? See the two religions? On

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:30.097
one hand, you have a half day
suspension, nobody wants that.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:34.067
Okay, so anyway. So
[bleep] [bleep], she would sit

00:05:34.101 --> 00:05:37.671
in the front of our class with
her skirt on and she would let

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:39.439
it ride up to around there. And
I would just sit in the back

00:05:39.473 --> 00:05:43.977
just staring at her with a boner
in my chin and these weird

00:05:44.077 --> 00:05:47.114
feelings I didn't understand.
Just like I liked her, man. She

00:05:47.147 --> 00:05:49.082
was hot. I liked her.
So we had this math class taught

00:05:49.116 --> 00:05:53.320
by this guy named Mr. Sager and
Mr. Sager was that one teacher.

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.088
You know that one teacher that
everybody has that nobody

00:05:55.088 --> 00:05:58.892
respected? You know, everybody
just knew, first day of class

00:05:58.926 --> 00:06:00.761
everybody just knew. You just
looked at each other, all the

00:06:00.794 --> 00:06:04.031
kids, and nonverbally they were
just like. With their minds

00:06:04.031 --> 00:06:06.900
they'd be like, we're going to
fuck with him until he quits

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:12.739
right? I mean, it's obvious.
Mr. Sager, the only

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:15.542
thing he ever did wrong, he had
a deep voice and a little bit of

00:06:15.576 --> 00:06:19.546
a lisp. That was it. He'd be
like, "The x-axis meets the

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.351
y-axis." And we were like, "Oh
yeah, you're fucked. How dare

00:06:24.384 --> 00:06:29.189
you try to teach children?" So
one day, Mr. Sager, he was

00:06:29.223 --> 00:06:32.626
turned around, he was writing on
the chalkboard, like this. And I

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:34.695
figured out, that if you take a
rubber band, if you tie it

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:38.198
around your fingers, if you then
take a half a paperclip, if you

00:06:38.232 --> 00:06:42.436
hook it on the rubber band and
pull back, you've got a weapon,

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:45.739
you've got a gun. It's as close
as the Jews got to gang

00:06:45.772 --> 00:06:48.909
violence. Like this is it. And I
was pointing it at Mr. Sager. I

00:06:48.942 --> 00:06:50.878
was never going to do anything;
I was just pointing it at him

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.146
trying to get [bleep [bleep]
attention. You know, like, "Aha,

00:06:53.180 --> 00:07:00.287
woohoo, look at me! Class clown.
I'm not learning and just being

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:03.223
a badass." But then as
I was doing it, my fingers, they

00:07:03.257 --> 00:07:07.060
started getting real sweaty. So
it was like getting hard to hold

00:07:07.094 --> 00:07:10.697
onto the paperclip and I was
point it right at Mr. Sager.

00:07:10.731 --> 00:07:13.800
Like, "Uh oh, this is bad." And
I didn't know what to do and if

00:07:13.834 --> 00:07:17.337
I knew anything at all about
tensile strength I would have

00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:23.710
realized like, oh, I could just,
I could just do that and itís

00:07:23.744 --> 00:07:26.713
not a problem at all anymore.
Completely negated, just like

00:07:26.747 --> 00:07:30.284
that, it's over. But that was
the lesson I was missing on the

00:07:30.317 --> 00:07:32.186
chalkboard right then so I was
like, "I don't know how to

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:35.889
handle this situation and math
is stupid, by the way." And so I

00:07:35.923 --> 00:07:38.458
thought maybe, "Do you go away
from the target? Does that make

00:07:38.492 --> 00:07:42.296
sense?" Yeah." As soon as I was
like, "Nope, thatís wrong." And

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:45.065
I couldn't hold on anymore and
the paperclip just shot out of

00:07:45.065 --> 00:07:48.402
my fingers and went right at Mr.
Sager, no arch at all, like a

00:07:48.435 --> 00:07:51.872
straight line through the air.
It made that noise. You

00:07:51.905 --> 00:07:56.343
know, like, "[inaudible]." Like
it made that. And it hit him, it

00:07:56.376 --> 00:07:59.079
hit him right in the back of the
head right where the ear meets

00:07:59.112 --> 00:08:00.581
the head. It hit him right here
and it drew a little beat of

00:08:00.614 --> 00:08:06.687
blood. Yeah, sick shot, right?
We're talking back of the

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:13.327
classroom trying not to let go.
Never miss a target.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.933
So, Mr. Sager, he goes, "Ow, who
did that?" And he starts to turn

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:22.603
around and he looks at the
class. And you know the rule;

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:24.371
you know the code of conduct in
high school. Nobody ever rats on

00:08:24.404 --> 00:08:26.640
anybody, so nobody's going to
say a word; nobody's going to

00:08:26.673 --> 00:08:29.343
talk about it. But then, Mr.
Sager, he starts upping it, he

00:08:29.376 --> 00:08:32.913
starts going, "If nobody tells
me who did that, nobody is

00:08:32.946 --> 00:08:37.885
leaving this class. You'll all
be late for your next class."

00:08:37.918 --> 00:08:43.724
And all these little Jew-lick
kids, they start thinking, I can

00:08:43.757 --> 00:08:45.626
see them murmuring to each other
like, theyíre like, "Wait, if I

00:08:45.659 --> 00:08:47.528
get a tardy on my record, am I
not getting into Harvard

00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:50.364
Business School?" They start
wondering, "I don't know Ari

00:08:50.397 --> 00:08:53.300
that well. Do you know him? I'm
not even friends with him. I

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:55.402
never played football with him.
Why would I even suffer for

00:08:55.435 --> 00:09:08.715
him?" And then [bleep] [bleep],
this kike heed. I think

00:09:08.749 --> 00:09:13.387
my favorite line in all of
comedy. She raised her hand up

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:15.522
and she goes, "Ari did it." And
I'm like, "Motherfucker." And I

00:09:15.556 --> 00:09:21.595
got sent to the principal's
office, I got suspended for five

00:09:21.628 --> 00:09:25.365
days. [inaudible] No, I should
have been, dude. You can't shoot

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:28.168
a teacher in the face and get
away with that, gotta set a

00:09:28.202 --> 00:09:31.171
precedent down. It was the worst
trouble I've ever gotten in

00:09:31.205 --> 00:09:33.674
though. My parents thought I was
a bad kid after that. They made

00:09:33.707 --> 00:09:37.744
me see a therapist for like two
years. The whole time I was like

00:09:37.778 --> 00:09:41.915
"My fingers got sweaty, that's
all that happened."

00:09:41.949 --> 00:09:46.053
Anyway, twenty-two years later,
I got a Facebook from [bleep]

00:09:46.053 --> 00:09:51.091
[bleep] saying, "Can you help me
win a trip to the Superbowl?"

00:09:51.124 --> 00:09:54.261
And I just wrote back, "Why
donít you ask Mr. Sager for

00:09:54.294 --> 00:09:57.631
help?" It felt so good.
