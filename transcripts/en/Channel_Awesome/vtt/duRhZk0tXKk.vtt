00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.800
"Fun and Fancy Free." Only one thing can be gayer than that title...

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.160
...aaaand there he is.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.060
Yeah, as I said before, I'm not a huge fan of Jiminy Cricket, but luckily, he doesn't have that much to do in this.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.940
Just like the other films, there's no one story, but in this, there's not really a bunch of 'em, either.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.180
There's only two.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.060
And Jiminy Cricket, for whatever reason, hosts them.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.860
It's strange that they would actually call this movie "Fun and Fancy Free," instead of just the two titles.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.780
It's not like "Make Mine Music," where if you listed all the titles, there wouldn't be enough room.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.840
Here, there's only two: "Bongo" and "Jack and the Beanstalk."

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.960
Heck, that's a shorter title than "Ichabod and Mr. Toad;" they could've done it.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.100
But heck with that. How do the stories hold up?

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.960
Well, as the other Disney stories go, even for the short ones, it's nothing that special.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.260
They're okay, though.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.220
The first one is called "Bongo," and it's about a bear who used to work in the circus, but escapes to live in the wild.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.040
He finds he doesn't quite fit in, but things change when he comes across a female bear.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.160
But then he gets confused when she starts beating the shit out of him.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.180
But then the movie so colorfully tells us that the way bears show that they love each other IS beating the shit out of each other.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.500
Makes sense to me.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.680
Yeah, even as a kid, I thought that was a little weird, and I'm still not sure I buy it now, but it makes for a cute song.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.660
-[singing] "Every pigeon likes to coo when he says, 'I love you,' but a bear likes to say it with a slap."

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:22.720
*slap*
*slap*

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:25.640
-And that's the best way to describe the first short: cute.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.640
I really liked it as a kid, but looking back, it does go on a little too long.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.540
If they were gonna do this and make it work, they should either make it its own movie with much more characters, or make it a lot shorter.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.480
Then there's a really weird transition where Jiminy Cricket is somehow invited to a party.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.920
A party where puppets come to life and strange, creepy men do weird sounds with their hands.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.140
A-and the parents are nowhere to be seen.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.160
Yeah, this would not fly today.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:53.460
-"You know, Ophelia, you look so sweet."

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.640
- *gasp* "What'd you say?"
-" I said, I think you look so sweet."
-"Yes?"

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.840
-But that segues into "Jack and the Beanstalk."

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.580
The first appearance of Mickey Mouse in any movie since "Fantasia."

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.320
And believe it or not, the last time you'll ever hear Walt Disney do his voice.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:10.300
We also Goofy and Donald into the mix, as it's pretty much just the straightforward story of "Jack and the Beanstalk."

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.260
Not really any major differences.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.960
I'd say the only thing that really stands out about it is the Giant, who is sort of this enjoyable doofus.

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.560
And they added this really weird plot device where he could change into anything.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.920
Isn't that strange?

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.060
He's already a giant; why do you have to give him more magical stuff?

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.760
Being a giant's enough.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.860
On top of that, they don't really do anything with it.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.500
There's a whole chase scene at the end where he's trying to get 'em, but wouldn't it just make more sense if he turned into a cheetah or something?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.800
The film doesn't quite have the flow or creativity that "Make Mine Music" had.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.760
And to be honest, I don't know what the connection is with all of these things.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.420
You have Jiminy Cricket, then a bear from a circus into the wild, then a creepy man with puppets, and then "Jack and the Beanstalk."

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:51.740
How's it all tied together?

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.680
Individually, they work okay. As cartoons.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.660
But I don't think there's enough of them to really warrant a film.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.020
Or if they did pick two, they'd have to do ones that are particularly unique or particularly cinematic.

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.880
And neither of these really are.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.360
Again, they're not bad, they're just not anything that special.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800
But they have their own charm and likability to 'em, so I guess they work out.

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:15.300
I'd say it's probably better just to rent them individually and skip the middle parts, but that's just me.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.400
If it looks good to ya, you'll probably like it.
