00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.560
It's just one of the many lovely
encounters I've had with food.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.960
"Yara what are you eating?"

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.960
But for one week, I tried eating like a refugee. I attempted what's called the Ration Challenge.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.660
That means I lived off the same food rations handed out to Syrian refugees by an Australian NGO

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.300
and observed the effects it had on my body.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.520
It was actually really hard.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.720
"Brain just hurts."

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.760
"I was constipated."

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.640
"Very lethargic."

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.840
"I can't even talk."

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.480
And at times,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.920
How did I get involved in this? Well, at AJ+,
we cover the refugee crisis closely.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.800
They've been on this road since September.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:52.040
And although I've even made videos about refugees, I've always felt disconnected from their struggles.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.380
So when my coworker Christina suggested
I take the Ration Challenge,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:58.800
I thought maybe, perhaps, possibly,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.940
I'd catch the tiniest glimpse of
what they go through every single day.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.600
The food rations were sent to me in a package.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.840
"Guess what this is Yara."

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.000
I sense lentils.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.620
Before I unboxed it though,

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.000
I thought I'd get some tips from people
who had already completed the challenge,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.120
which raises money to pass out the exact
same food rations to Syrian refugees.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.020
What am I getting myself into?

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.440
You're getting yourself into a week of ...

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.700
You're gonna be hungry. You're gonna be tired.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.100
You will never feel full or satisfied.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.120
And with that, I got to opening the box.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.920
I'm supposed to eat whatever's in this box.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.920
That included: sardines, red lentils,
dried chickpeas, oil, red kidney beans, and rice.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.620
And some extra rice and flour 
that I had to supply myself.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.940
Altogether, the instructions said the meals contained
a little over 1,700 calories per day.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.280
But something was noticeably absent.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.860
"I wonder how much salt and pepper I can use ...

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.880
... salt and pepper ...

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:10.440
... salt ...

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.160
... salt and pepper ...

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.060
... salt and pepper ...

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.060
"They didn't give you any salt or pepper in here?"

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.520
There were recipes for a number of dishes
like falafel and hummus.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.480
But the ingredients were so limited.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.240
"Seriously, like, how much falafel
can you make with this?"

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.440
"Like, three falafels?"

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.820
"One very large ..."

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.780
And I wanted to make sure I got a little bit
of everything in every meal.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.740
"This has to last me through the week."

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.160
"This is like having my own cooking show."

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.860
"Oh my God, that looks ...

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.100
not great."

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.700
So, I basically made one dish with slight variations and ate it every single day for lunch and dinner.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.480
And when I ran out of lentils, I added in a can of kidney beans that I'd saved for the end.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.860
Breakfast was basically two thin slices of
flatbread that I made in one batch.

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.920
As I started my first day, I talked to Karen.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.180
She's part of the campaign.

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.060
"The physical and mental toll that
it takes on your body in a week

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.040
– you'll see it in a few days' time –

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.280
is huge.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.620
It makes you really angry and
frustrated and unable to concentrate.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.520
For refugees, you can't walk away from this.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.920
This is their everyday."

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.520
Day 1 looked like this:

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:27.600
... which progressed into ...

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.780
And then ...

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.320
Over the course of the week,
I got a number of headaches.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.620
I had trouble thinking and working.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.720
My roommate told me I looked kind of pale.

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.260
I regularly felt exhausted and sometimes cold.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.720
I also noticed changes in my personality.

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.800
"I'm becoming more direct, less polite."

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.000
The instructions came back to haunt me.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.460
it says.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.420
"What does that smell? It smells vinegary."

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.760
–&nbsp;"What is that?"

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:02.520
"Cinnamon donut."

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.120
"These images of Fettuccine Alfredo ..."

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:07.000
"What is that?"

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.760
– "What you have?"

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.320
"Oh, it's just some leftovers."

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.540
It was kind of like what Karen said.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.560
"If you're living on this kind of diet, which is
basically carbohydrates and oil,

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:22.780
you're getting just enough calorie intake,
but you're not getting any fresh food,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.240
you're not getting nutrients.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.660
You're not getting all of the things that, you know,
are meant to boost the human body."

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.620
So I asked Martin McDonald, a nutritionist.

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:42.160
The diet that you followed was by any
stretch of the imagination not particularly healthy.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:45.020
Martin told me my symptoms were
caused by a number of factors.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.760
I was exhausted because I wasn't getting enough calories for someone of my weight, height and age.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.820
I need about 2,100 calories a day but was getting 1,700.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.660
"I have a call with someone in a few minutes.
I don't have enough energy."

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.820
It didn't help that vitamins and proteins
were lacking too.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.000
– "Yes, there's half a dismembered
sardine inside of this rice."

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000
But why couldn't I concentrate at work?

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.420
"Concentration, brain function, can be heavily
related to things like dehydration."

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.500
But I thought I drank plenty of
water throughout the challenge.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.860
"Even though you had some access to water,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:21.220
you don't have salt or potassium
to help you retain some of that water."

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:25.620
Ultimately, I learned one of the
biggest flaws in my diet was

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.240
"You probably were getting between
a fifth and a sixth as much iron as you would need."

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.640
Iron deficiency is actually the most common
nutritional deficiency in the world.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.340
And for growing children, it's a serious health risk.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.820
Your body uses iron to make red blood cells.

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.580
But what happens when you don't
have enough iron to make them?

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.860
You could develop

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.860
For kids and infants, anemia
weakens their immune system

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:53.720
making them way more susceptible
to disease and infection.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:57.080
and it can permanently impair a
child's mental development.

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:04.140
That's a terrifying prospect when you consider that half the world's twenty 22.5 million refugees are children.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.580
2016 study revealed something shocking at one of the UN's largest camps for Syrian refugees in Jordan:

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.340
Nearly 50% of children suffered
from some kind of anemia.

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.760
And it's not just among Syrian refugees.

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.380
Anemia is thought to affect one in three children worldwide.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:24.680
Refugee camps in Kenya and Ethiopia have some of the highest rates of anemia in the world.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:30.980
Refugees across the world
are not eating exactly what I ate

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:36.640
This is, after all, one specific food ration passed out
by one specific Australian NGO.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:39.900
Refugees might combine them with other
ingredients they have access to.

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.780
But they also might not have access to anything at all.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.200
But there are some basic realities.

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.500
Refugee diets are usually lacking
in fresh produce and meats.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:53.060
If you're a refugee in a pinch, you'll probably have to
eat a food ration at some point.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.200
And those food rations are nowhere near ideal.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.320
You can survive off them, but your body will be hurting.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.560
It all reminded me of something I was told earlier.

00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:07.040
"I was able to do this challenge, and I always had in the back of my mind, like, 'This is only for seven days.

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.220
I can get through this.'"

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:22.480
Refugees live this life for days, months and years.
I only ate like them for a week.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.420
I didn't have to worry about shelter, weathering the sub-zero temperatures of the winter in my tent.

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.100
I didn't have to worry about contracting a disease, the psychological trauma of fleeing a war,

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:35.500
looking after kids, trying to find a job
to make some extra money on the side

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:41.169
so I might – just might – be able to procure a tiny
amount of meat or fresh produce.

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:43.400
I was uncomfortable,

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.360
but I was privileged in a way refugees are not.

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.760
So, when you hear about families
fleeing their homes in Iraq,

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:50.640
in Syria,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:51.480
in Sudan,

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:52.420
in Eritrea,

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:53.700
in Myanmar,

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:54.560
in Afghanistan

00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:56.720
try to keep this in the back of your mind:

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.280
"When you struggle with something yourself so much,

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.160
you start to understand someone else's pain –
when you actually put yourself in their shoes.

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:09.520
And you can look away from a video or you can forget about a political argument

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.380
or a discussion that you may have had,

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:18.000
but when everything about what you're eating and drinking and doing in your life has to do with that,

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:30.220
The Ration Challenge really put things into perspective for me, but just one note:

00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:32.860
It's not a way to simulate the experience of a refugee,

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:35.180
and I would never frame it that way
because there's no comparison.

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:38.700
But for me at least, it was an opportunity
to learn about some of the basic realities

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.700
that refugees face on a daily basis.

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.860
So if you have any friends or family who might not be fully aware of some of those realities,

00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:45.640
send this video over to them and see what they think.
