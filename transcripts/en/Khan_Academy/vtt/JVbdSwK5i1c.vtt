00:00:00.259 --> 00:00:02.433
- {Voiceover] Phototropism in plants is a

00:00:02.433 --> 00:00:04.546
response in which a plant shoot grows

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:06.151
toward a light source.

00:00:06.151 --> 00:00:08.305
The results of five different experimental

00:00:08.305 --> 00:00:10.357
treatments from classic investigations

00:00:10.357 --> 00:00:12.937
of phototropism are shown above.

00:00:12.937 --> 00:00:15.822
Part A: Give support for the claim that

00:00:15.822 --> 00:00:18.565
the cells located in the
tip of the plant shoot

00:00:18.565 --> 00:00:20.962
give support for the claim that the cells

00:00:20.962 --> 00:00:23.014
located in the tip of the plant shoot

00:00:23.014 --> 00:00:25.371
detect the light by comparing the results

00:00:25.371 --> 00:00:27.728
from treatment group one with

00:00:27.728 --> 00:00:29.394
the results from treatment group two

00:00:29.394 --> 00:00:31.751
and treatment group three.

00:00:31.751 --> 00:00:32.868
So we wanna compare these first

00:00:32.868 --> 00:00:36.079
three treatment groups, and you see when

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:38.618
you have an unaltered tip that the whole

00:00:38.618 --> 00:00:42.194
plant is going to bend in
the direction of the light,

00:00:42.194 --> 00:00:44.368
when you remove the tip, it no longer

00:00:44.368 --> 00:00:47.781
bends in the direction of the light,

00:00:47.781 --> 00:00:49.590
or if you were to cover the tip with

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.296
some type of an opaque cap so the light

00:00:51.296 --> 00:00:54.832
can't go through it, it's
still not going to bend.

00:00:54.832 --> 00:00:56.396
So this is pretty good
evidence that there is

00:00:56.396 --> 00:00:59.240
there is something about
the tip of the plant

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.821
that allows the phototropism to occur,

00:01:01.821 --> 00:01:04.381
it allows the plant to
know which direction

00:01:04.381 --> 00:01:06.819
the light is and then makes somehow causes

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:08.912
it to bend in that direction.

00:01:08.912 --> 00:01:11.329
So I'll just write that down.

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:13.036
Give support for the claim,

00:01:13.036 --> 00:01:17.004
so we can say that phototropism

00:01:18.115 --> 00:01:19.064
phototropism

00:01:20.664 --> 00:01:22.075
phototropism

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:29.835
only occurred only occurred when

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:37.715
there is an

00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:42.715
unaltered tip unaltered tip

00:01:43.932 --> 00:01:46.411
that has access to the light

00:01:46.411 --> 00:01:51.232
that has access to light.

00:01:53.725 --> 00:01:58.648
No bending occurred no bending occurred

00:02:00.044 --> 00:02:05.044
occurred when either the tip was removed

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:11.522
the tip was removed

00:02:11.522 --> 00:02:15.633
that was that was treatment two

00:02:16.541 --> 00:02:21.541
so treatment treatment two,

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:27.759
or the tip was tip had an opaque cover,

00:02:28.813 --> 00:02:33.813
the tip had an opaque cover,

00:02:36.453 --> 00:02:40.150
that was treatment treatment

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:45.447
treatment three.

00:02:45.447 --> 00:02:46.970
So that's all there is
to it, it only occurred

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.819
when there was an unaltered tip, so that

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:52.212
was treatment one that
has access to light,

00:02:52.212 --> 00:02:54.061
no bending occurred when
either the tip was removed

00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:55.991
in this one, in treatment two,

00:02:55.991 --> 00:02:57.576
or treatment three, so it's a pretty good

00:02:57.576 --> 00:02:58.978
indication that you need that tip and it

00:02:58.978 --> 00:03:00.360
needs to have access to light,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.554
something about the
tip lets the plant know

00:03:02.554 --> 00:03:05.378
what direction to start bending in.

00:03:05.378 --> 00:03:07.714
All right, let's do part B now.

00:03:07.714 --> 00:03:09.041
Part B.

00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:12.591
In treatment groups four and five,

00:03:12.591 --> 00:03:14.155
so that's these two treatment groups

00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:17.548
right over here, the tips
of the plants are removed

00:03:17.548 --> 00:03:20.352
and placed back onto the shoot on either

00:03:20.352 --> 00:03:23.196
a permeable or impermeable barrier.

00:03:23.196 --> 00:03:24.903
Using the results from treatment groups

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:28.012
four and five, describe two
additional characteristics

00:03:28.012 --> 00:03:30.776
of the phototropism response.

00:03:30.776 --> 00:03:32.746
Well, when the tip was placed on top of a

00:03:32.746 --> 00:03:37.053
permeable barrier, the phototropism

00:03:37.053 --> 00:03:39.938
still happens, the plant still bends.

00:03:39.938 --> 00:03:43.128
So even though the tip is disconnected,

00:03:43.128 --> 00:03:44.895
because this barrier is permeable,

00:03:44.895 --> 00:03:48.106
the tip must be able
to sense the light and

00:03:48.106 --> 00:03:51.580
release some type of substance or hormone

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:53.307
or chemical or something that's able to

00:03:53.307 --> 00:03:56.497
go through this permeable barrier,

00:03:56.497 --> 00:03:57.878
some type of substance that goes through

00:03:57.878 --> 00:03:59.707
this permeable barrier, and somehow

00:03:59.707 --> 00:04:01.556
signals to the rest of the plant to bend

00:04:01.556 --> 00:04:03.323
in the right direction.

00:04:03.323 --> 00:04:05.091
Because when you put
an impermeable barrier

00:04:05.091 --> 00:04:08.403
right over here, the tip
might be trying to release

00:04:08.403 --> 00:04:10.191
those same substances but they can't get

00:04:10.191 --> 00:04:12.141
through and so the rest
of the plant doesn't

00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:14.864
know to bend or in what direction to bend.

00:04:14.864 --> 00:04:17.830
So we could say, we could say

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.830
tip, tip must release some type

00:04:29.695 --> 00:04:34.695
of hormone hormone I say chemical

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:42.193
chemical that signals to

00:04:44.264 --> 00:04:49.264
rest of plant to bend to bend

00:04:51.537 --> 00:04:56.537
and in which direction which direction

00:05:00.334 --> 00:05:02.596
we know this, we know this,

00:05:05.393 --> 00:05:06.781
because

00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:13.709
only the or only I
could say treatment four

00:05:14.658 --> 00:05:19.658
only treatment four treatment four

00:05:20.672 --> 00:05:23.516
permeable barrier, and I'll say

00:05:23.516 --> 00:05:25.426
where the barrier's permeable to that

00:05:25.426 --> 00:05:29.435
substance, where the barrier

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:37.090
is permeable to that substance

00:05:40.928 --> 00:05:45.928
that substance we know this because

00:05:46.739 --> 00:05:48.426
only treatment four where the barrier

00:05:48.426 --> 00:05:49.726
is permeable to the substance

00:05:49.726 --> 00:05:54.726
shows shows phototropism, phototropism.

00:06:00.551 --> 00:06:05.551
Not treatment treatment five.

00:06:06.708 --> 00:06:07.825
We know this, we could say, because

00:06:07.825 --> 00:06:12.825
of the two, of four and
five, only treatment

00:06:14.714 --> 00:06:16.216
four where the barrier's permeable

00:06:16.216 --> 00:06:20.259
to that substance shows phototropism.

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:21.763
That's the only explanation here,

00:06:21.763 --> 00:06:23.307
that it's not doing somehow doing it

00:06:23.307 --> 00:06:26.355
through radio waves or
releasing substances

00:06:26.355 --> 00:06:28.346
that somehow float in the air to the rest

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:30.032
of the plant, that somehow some type

00:06:30.032 --> 00:06:33.120
of substance is going through through

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.980
directly from the tip to
the rest of the plant,

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:38.565
and when you block it,
it's not able to send

00:06:38.565 --> 00:06:40.536
those chemical signals.

00:06:40.536 --> 00:06:42.832
That's the best that's
the best explanation

00:06:42.832 --> 00:06:46.327
that I can think of for
this behavior that we

00:06:46.327 --> 00:06:47.607
see between between treatments

00:06:47.607 --> 00:06:49.563
four and five.
