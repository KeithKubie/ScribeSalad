00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.570
ATISSA BANUAZIZI: the feedback
that we give them really

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.660
involves encouraging
them to show them

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.170
how they can use the core
material on their slides,

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.990
but also their
metadiscourse in presenting,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.380
and that's sort of
like a term that we

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.840
use to explain like
how you talk about what

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.100
you're talking about.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.950
And so the
metadiscourse is often

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.950
what does the best job of making
those links for the benefit

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.420
of the audience.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.530
And ultimately, a lot of the
feedback that we offer to them

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.150
has to do with getting them
to think about the audience

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.540
and who they are and helping
them understand, because this

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.100
isn't something that
they necessarily

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.690
come in understanding, that they
need to speak and write in such

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.780
a way that it can be understood
not only by the professor who

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.539
obviously knows
more than they do,

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.830
but by somebody who isn't
familiar with the experiment,

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:01.303
who's coming to it
for the first time.
