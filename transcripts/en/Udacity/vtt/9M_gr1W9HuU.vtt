00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.650
As we just heard from Professor Bohem, software

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.970
engineering is an important and critical discipline, concerned

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.100
with cost effective software development. We also heard

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.170
that this is based on a systematic approach

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.580
that uses appropriate tools and techniques, operates under

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.130
specific development constraints. And most importantly, follows a

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:20.890
process. As we discussed in the previous lesson,

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.770
the software development process contains fundamental activities, or phases.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.480
Since we will discuss several processes, I'm going to remind

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.150
you what these phases are. We start with requirements

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.630
engineering, followed by design,

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.980
implementation, verification and validation, and

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.950
finally maintenance. Note that we will revisit each of

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.940
these phases and devote an entire lesson or more

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.160
to each phase. So what I want to do next

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.210
is simply to give you a quick overview of

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.020
what these phases are. Note also that for now

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.330
I will follow a very traditional take on these topics. Later on in the

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.260
class we will see how things can change and did change over the years.
