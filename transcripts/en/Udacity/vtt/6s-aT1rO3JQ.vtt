00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.440
So the question is, if the only rule that we have for making words is this

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:04.900
one, the one I should you before, where

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.390
we have the non-terminal word, and that can be

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.030
replaced by counter followed by another word, then the question is, how many

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.079
words can we make starting from the non-terminal word? And the possible answers

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:24.851
are none, one, two, or infinitely many.
