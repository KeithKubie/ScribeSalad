00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.590
Ok. so you’re camping with your friends
and the mosquitoes are driving everyone crazy.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:07.320
You have some bug spray with DEET and it really
works great

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.560
But is it safe to spray this chemical all
over yourself?

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.720
Today, studies show that DEET has harmful
effects to cells in our bodies.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.270
It can dissolve nylons.

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.430
It can dissolve plastics.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.360
It can dissolve your watchband.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.120
This is Anandasankar Ray, he’s trying to
find safer AND more effective ways to repel

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.120
insects.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.329
Insect repellant that we commonly use called
DEET has remained unchanged since the 1950s.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.300
This is actually kind of crazy.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:42.880
Bug spray has pretty much stayed the same
for 70 years.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.220
And when Scientists first developed DEET they
didn’t really understand why it repelled

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:48.220
mosquitoes.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.080
And it’s hard to improve something when
you don’t even understand how it works.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:54.060
So first, Ray wanted to figure out how mosquitoes
smell.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.960
So the mosquito has an incredibly sensitive
nose.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.750
We emit quite a substantial amount of carbon
dioxide and this gets carried downwind in

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.010
the shape of plumes.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.400
And the mosquito when it comes across one
such plume, it starts to move in closer and

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:16.810
closer towards us and recognizes that oh,
this is a human being that is going to be

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.280
a source of blood, and makes a beeline for
us.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.400
And once Ray understood what attracts mosquitoes
to people he turned his attention to repellants

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.570
to understand what chemical features caused
this repellency.

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.220
He looked at a mosquito’s nose to see which
receptors detect DEET.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.000
And then using this really powerful computer
he took all of this data

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.430
and found some alternatives.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.360
We were able to very rapidly screen nearly
half a million chemicals in one afternoon

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.390
and identify 1000 new DEET substitutes.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.260
And one hundred of these are already considered
safe by the FDA.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.560
And these aren’t going to destroy fabrics
like DEET.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.940
These are chemicals that are actually found
in fruits, found in plants, and some of these

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.310
are used in our food for flavoring.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.329
So right now, he’s developing a lotion that’s
as strong as DEET, but uses natural compounds

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.080
We have some that smell like orange blossoms,
some that smell like sandalwood.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.690
And really what he’s doing here is trying
to find scents that WE think smell really

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.680
nice, but mosquitoes don’t like.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.360
And Mosquitoes aren’t just annoying when
you’re camping — they can be really dangerous.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.100
Nearly a BILLION people worldwide are affected
by mosquito-borne diseases

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.580
like Zika, West Nile, Dengue and Malaria.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:33.290
And so I am hopeful that this approach will
lead to interventions that could be useful

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.170
in the field and perhaps not only help protect
us in our backyard barbeques, but also help

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.900
have an impact on malaria, in Africa.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.340
And these same compounds also repel bedbugs,
ants and even agricultural pests that destroy

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:47.340
the food we grow.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.270
So it may not seem important or glamorous
to understand just how a mosquito’s nose

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.200
works, but this research has opened up a lot
of new possibilities.
