1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:02,490
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,990
So when you decide to move or
you taking anybody with you,

3
00:00:06,991 --> 00:00:11,430
you go solo. I'm going to
start off going solo. Um,

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:15,030
I would like to get, you know,
my brother to come visit.

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:19,400
I'd like to get my mom to come out really
as many them out there. Yeah. Yeah. And,

6
00:00:19,401 --> 00:00:23,130
and just cheap and just kind of
simple living my end. My mom,

7
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:24,690
I don't think she's ever left the country,

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:27,690
so I think it'd be really
cool for her to go out there,

9
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:30,090
but at the moment I'm just really like,

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,150
this place is great for my career
right now, Greg from my training.

11
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:36,840
So I just want to get there asap
out. Get back to work. Sorry.

12
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:40,920
How do you account for
Jet Lag? Like, do you,

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,290
do you just,
uh,

14
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,320
like do you give yourself enough time
to adjust to the time difference?

15
00:00:46,830 --> 00:00:50,490
You know what, the whole time I was
there, I would, my sleep schedule was off.

16
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,480
I never adjusted.

17
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,630
So I was going to bed maybe 2:30
AM every morning then like get up,

18
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,890
run at five and then, you know, get tired
later. Get tired later. Yeah. Weird,

19
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:03,330
right schedule is all off.

20
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,540
And then when I came back it took
me like a week or two to adjust.

21
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:11,220
So I was disappointed how stupid
my body was. Yeah. Hey dummy,

22
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:14,710
go to bed now I'm telling you,
you just go to bed now. Like,

23
00:01:14,730 --> 00:01:17,670
like I didn't know my body
had such a rigid schedule.

24
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,330
When you jack that thing sideways and
you're on the other side of the planet

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,090
that your body just really doesn't know
what the fuck is going on. Seriously.

26
00:01:24,091 --> 00:01:28,140
And then for me being stuck in that plane
for so long, yeah. I was like, ah, yeah,

27
00:01:28,141 --> 00:01:31,650
you're too big for them. Little
seats too. So when you do that,

28
00:01:31,651 --> 00:01:34,560
if say if you have a fight in Vegas,
you're going to go from Thailand to Vegas.

29
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:36,780
Do you show up two weeks early?
Yeah.

30
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:41,070
Well this is my first time flying back
to the states after being in Thailand and

31
00:01:41,071 --> 00:01:43,890
I flew a week early. No,
I flew two weeks early.

32
00:01:43,891 --> 00:01:46,830
One Week I stayed in Vegas and then
fight week stayed in Atlanta. And look,

33
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,630
I think that was perfect
timing. Oh, that's good.

34
00:01:48,631 --> 00:01:52,500
So like you get a little difference in
time between those weather too, man.

35
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:57,450
It's so hot. Like we train outside
and it's humid and hot. So, um,

36
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:02,460
between every round it feels like, you
know, like the third round of a fight.

37
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,130
If they were going into the championship
rounds, I've never been there,

38
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:09,450
but I'd imagine that it feels very
shitty and uh, that's how it feels.

39
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,160
Every round in Thailand, just like
you're covered in sweat, hot, thick.

40
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,820
Yeah. That was probably like my
fifth round or something like that.

41
00:02:17,821 --> 00:02:20,790
And when we do it, I was
dead by this point. Um,

42
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,670
shout out to the editor for making
me not look as tired as I was.

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,231
Yeah.

44
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:32,160
So what we're looking at folks for the
people who are just listening as a bunch

45
00:02:32,161 --> 00:02:36,780
of videos of you training, strength and
conditioning palling up against the wall.

46
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,500
So you get getting everything down there.
Yeah. That's Joseph Hanley right there.

47
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:44,280
He was on the, uh, on the
ultimate fighter, I forgot
what season they called them.

48
00:02:44,281 --> 00:02:48,260
Leah notice he's a black belt out there
and he helped me out a lot. Man, there's,

49
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,080
you run into so many different people
and he's like, yeah, like black belt,

50
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,630
any type of grappling you want,
any positions you want to work,

51
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:56,530
like we'll go over it, we'll
create a system, whatever.

52
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,170
And so he was really big help and
this preparation for this fight. Yeah.

53
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,340
A bunch of free spirits live in
there. Right. So many, so many.

54
00:03:03,341 --> 00:03:05,980
But everybody's down there with a
goal and they want to get in shape.

55
00:03:05,981 --> 00:03:10,030
They want to get healthy or, yeah.
Spiritual path, whatever it may be. Yeah.

56
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,570
There's something romantic about the
ex pat living in Thailand having a good

57
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:17,850
time, you know, something romantic
about that. So it's interesting. Yeah.

58
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:21,400
That's really cool. Yeah, I mean
that whole culture man, I mean the,

59
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:25,840
the tie and Moyie Thai culture.
What a phenomenon.

60
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:31,020
If you look at combat sports and then
this one that it's so tied into these

61
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:35,690
stadiums, it's so tied into gambling
and betting. It's so, I mean,

62
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:40,230
kids get indoctrinated into it at a
very young age, young, super young.

63
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,080
There's not, there's guys at the
gym that I was at, um, little kids,

64
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:47,440
they'd come right after school and
they go to Muay Thai training and their

65
00:03:47,441 --> 00:03:50,770
training just like the older guys and
then they go right back to the home,

66
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:55,450
like home, eat dinner. But
that's just their lifestyle
so that it starts as a kid.

67
00:03:55,451 --> 00:03:58,480
It's like go to school,
Moy, Tai, go sleep.

68
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:02,530
And then as an adult it's like
Moy Moitai feed your family.

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,980
Moitai feed your family. These
guys live at the gym. It Jesus,

70
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,150
they live at the gym and they go home
maybe two days after a fight just to take

71
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,330
care of their families and then come
right back to the gym and you're ready for

72
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:17,830
the next height. Now of course, at
Tiger Moitai, you know, you've guys,

73
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,470
everybody knows diff,
various people in different organizations.

74
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:26,560
UFC Bella tour would have you, uh, one FC.

75
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,760
But what about those guys
that are fighting in those
little small tie gyms and

76
00:04:30,761 --> 00:04:34,500
stadiums? Like, how much access do
they have to grappling or how about,

77
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:38,980
do they ever, do they, are they satisfied
to just do more tires here at all?

78
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,240
Like a movement in Thailand and
my MMA, especially at tiger, um,

79
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,390
a lot of those guys are coming
over to the MMA and learning,

80
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:50,350
Jujitsu and wrestling. One of the guys
I was learning to clinch from, um,

81
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,690
he was like, um, he's got
probably 300 fights, um,

82
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:58,810
300 Muay Thai fights and he started
training MMA and taking him and may fight.

83
00:04:58,811 --> 00:04:59,890
So it's deaf there.

84
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:02,890
They're definitely opening their mind
to it and hopping in there and there's

85
00:05:02,891 --> 00:05:05,590
access in Bangkok, it's
a little different. Um,

86
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,740
cause that's very like stadium based,
you know,

87
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:13,540
like high level Moitai and uh,
they're not too focused on in May,

88
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:15,700
there are a couple of MMA gyms,
but if you want to do that,

89
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:18,790
if you want to get the best of both
worlds, it's in, it's implicate a tiger.

90
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:24,570
So in, is there any MMA
at all in Bangkok? Uh,

91
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,140
they got a couple of places but nothing
with like at like providers or any high

92
00:05:29,141 --> 00:05:30,460
level fighters.
But they do have,

93
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,200
they do have maybe three or four MMA
gyms there with just guys stopping in or

94
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,840
guys who practice, you know,
a little bit of everything.

95
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:42,430
I'm always really interested in countries
that figure something out better than

96
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:44,760
everybody else when it comes
to leg kicking and look,

97
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,730
nobody figured it out any better than
the tie. It's like no one argues that,

98
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:53,110
right? No seriously. And their shins
man, like I think they're just,

99
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,101
that's done for,

100
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:56,860
they don't even feel the front of
their legs anymore cause they can kick

101
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,770
anything and they're getting kicks
checked. There's guys that Joe,

102
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,630
they'll fight one night at the stadium,

103
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,810
go five rounds and then sleep and maybe
the next day go fight like another small

104
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:13,610
event or a smaller event sometime even
in the same night. And it's like, man,

105
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:17,750
aren't you like your shins?
Don't hurt your elbows. No
hurt, nothing in these guys.

106
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:21,680
They're just like, they're bulletproof.
They're used to this man. It's crazy. Wow.

107
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,840
And their first time in my life,

108
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:29,420
I go into a locker room and the red and
blue corner is both in the same room,

109
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,010
probably as big as this studio.

110
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,350
And they're all getting
their hands wrapped together,

111
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:35,120
getting massaged out together.
Everything,

112
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:40,160
no weird energy in the room
like, you know, in the UFC,

113
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:43,400
like they separate us. We have to
kind of be separate whatever purposes.

114
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:47,390
But like in Thailand they're just like
hanging out, same room, you know, talking,

115
00:06:47,391 --> 00:06:51,070
whatever, and then they just
go fight right after. It's
so weird, like the piece,

116
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,200
it's, it's so weird man. It was the first
time I experienced that and I was like,

117
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,820
maybe I can start lightening up a
little bit. Like it's only a fight.

118
00:06:57,821 --> 00:06:59,990
And that's kind of something
I had to tell myself. Um,

119
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:04,130
for this one I had to like really fall
back and rely on my training because I

120
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,680
was really nervous. I
was nervous to start, um,

121
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,500
to try the new stuff that I learned out.

122
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,220
I never through many leg
kicks in any of my fights. Um,

123
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,630
I'd never really did that stance.

124
00:07:14,631 --> 00:07:19,340
Everything that I did was pretty much
brand new. Um, and I was really nervous.

125
00:07:19,341 --> 00:07:23,540
I was like, what if it doesn't work?
You know, like so many different,

126
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:27,140
so many different feelings.
And, um, for this one, I,

127
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,840
the only thing I can tell myself as like,
rely on your training.

128
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,100
Okay.
