the lab we had exciting discussion and

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760
the lab we had exciting discussion and
 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:03:00.440
the lab we had exciting discussion and
then I got a very annoying phone call I

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450
 
 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.870
 
understood after a while that the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880
understood after a while that the
 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.080
understood after a while that the
message was not

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090
message was not

okay so this was a memory I wanted to

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340
okay so this was a memory I wanted to
 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.840
okay so this was a memory I wanted to
share with you and what is important

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850
share with you and what is important
 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.650
share with you and what is important
here is that this is an example of a

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660
here is that this is an example of a
 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.699
here is that this is an example of a
very strong episodic memory and under

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709
very strong episodic memory and under
 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.780
very strong episodic memory and under
tuning in the 70s he said if you want to

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790
tuning in the 70s he said if you want to
 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.400
tuning in the 70s he said if you want to
study episodic memory there are three

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410
study episodic memory there are three
 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.770
study episodic memory there are three
key questions that you have to

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780
key questions that you have to
 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.349
key questions that you have to
understand and if you want to understand

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359
understand and if you want to understand
 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.409
understand and if you want to understand
how the brain is dealing with this then

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419
how the brain is dealing with this then
 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.990
how the brain is dealing with this then
you know a bit more about that the

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000
you know a bit more about that the
 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.210
you know a bit more about that the
Tzadik memory and that is what I hope

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220
Tzadik memory and that is what I hope
 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:31.880
Tzadik memory and that is what I hope
that we can do today so there are three

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890
that we can do today so there are three
 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:33.970
that we can do today so there are three
questions

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:33.980
questions
 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:37.480
questions
where did it happen

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490
where did it happen
 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.400
where did it happen
when did it happen and what happened

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410
when did it happen and what happened
 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:45.830
when did it happen and what happened
what we also know is that there is a

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840
what we also know is that there is a
 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.210
what we also know is that there is a
brain structure just inside here in the

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220
brain structure just inside here in the
 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.190
brain structure just inside here in the
temporal lobe that is called hippocampus

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200
temporal lobe that is called hippocampus
 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.370
temporal lobe that is called hippocampus
in fact there two of them and it's

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380
in fact there two of them and it's
 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.490
in fact there two of them and it's
called hippocampus as you know because

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500
called hippocampus as you know because
 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.390
called hippocampus as you know because
it's hippocampus is seahorse and it

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.400
it's hippocampus is seahorse and it
 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.830
it's hippocampus is seahorse and it
looks like a seahorse so this this

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840
looks like a seahorse so this this
 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.980
looks like a seahorse so this this
hippocampus here is dissected out by

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990
hippocampus here is dissected out by
 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:14.810
hippocampus here is dissected out by

Sarah's just to show how similar

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120
Sarah's just to show how similar

Sarah's just to show how similar
hippocampus is to seahorse what is

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450
hippocampus is to seahorse what is
 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.830
hippocampus is to seahorse what is
important is that even in the 50s we

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840
important is that even in the 50s we
 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.380
important is that even in the 50s we
heard about this structure because there

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390
heard about this structure because there
 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.300
heard about this structure because there
was one man that you probably have heard

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310
was one man that you probably have heard
 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.240
was one man that you probably have heard
about he was called a gem at that time

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250
about he was called a gem at that time
 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:37.640
about he was called a gem at that time
and I'm iliza he had removed both of his

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650
and I'm iliza he had removed both of his
 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.380
and I'm iliza he had removed both of his
super company because he had a plastic

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390
super company because he had a plastic
 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.140

seizures and the medicine didn't help

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:42.150
seizures and the medicine didn't help
 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.440
seizures and the medicine didn't help
him and then they did some experimental

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:45.450
him and then they did some experimental
 

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:48.980
him and then they did some experimental
surgeries and to remove the per compass

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990
surgeries and to remove the per compass
 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.960
surgeries and to remove the per compass
he woke up and he was a very nice guy so

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970
he woke up and he was a very nice guy so
 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:54.290
he woke up and he was a very nice guy so
he was

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300
he was
 

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.830
he was
social he was laughing he was he looked

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840
social he was laughing he was he looked
 

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.960
social he was laughing he was he looked
very normal and then they started to

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970
very normal and then they started to
 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:03.860
very normal and then they started to
test him with IQ tests and he was better

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870
test him with IQ tests and he was better
 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.409
test him with IQ tests and he was better
than before because he wasn't disturbed

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419
than before because he wasn't disturbed
 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:11.809
than before because he wasn't disturbed
by the seizures but when people came

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819
by the seizures but when people came
 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:16.610
by the seizures but when people came
back even after 15 minutes he said I

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:16.620
back even after 15 minutes he said I
 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:19.390
back even after 15 minutes he said I
never seen you before

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400
never seen you before
 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.570
never seen you before
so he couldn't encode new episodic

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:23.580
so he couldn't encode new episodic

he couldn't even know how to find a
 

00:06:27.509 --> 00:06:30.350
he couldn't even know how to find a
bathroom so he didn't have the where and

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:30.360
bathroom so he didn't have the where and
 

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.320
bathroom so he didn't have the where and
he didn't have the time because he

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:33.330
he didn't have the time because he
 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:36.680
he didn't have the time because he
didn't know when things had happened and

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:36.690
didn't know when things had happened and
 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:40.550
didn't know when things had happened and
in what sequence but he could learn

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560
in what sequence but he could learn
 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.999
in what sequence but he could learn
other things he could learn to write

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:43.009
other things he could learn to write
 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.920
other things he could learn to write
from a mirror and he could learn quite

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930
from a mirror and he could learn quite
 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.610
from a mirror and he could learn quite
some some things but everything that had

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620
some some things but everything that had
 

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.850
some some things but everything that had
to do with episodic memory even to learn

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:52.860
to do with episodic memory even to learn
 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:56.540
to do with episodic memory even to learn
that his uncle had died he couldn't

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:56.550
that his uncle had died he couldn't
 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:02.680
that his uncle had died he couldn't
encode into his brain so in our lab we

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:02.690
encode into his brain so in our lab we
 

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.830
encode into his brain so in our lab we
were restarted with where but before we

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840
were restarted with where but before we
 

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.950
were restarted with where but before we
started with the where question there is

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:09.960
started with the where question there is
 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.680
started with the where question there is
an important man

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:12.690
an important man
 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.559
an important man
besides my ex-husband Edward Moussa and

00:07:15.559 --> 00:07:15.569
besides my ex-husband Edward Moussa and
 

00:07:15.569 --> 00:07:19.249
besides my ex-husband Edward Moussa and
that was my supervisor John Okeefe who

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:19.259
that was my supervisor John Okeefe who
 

00:07:19.259 --> 00:07:22.790
that was my supervisor John Okeefe who
we learned a Nobel Prize with what he

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:22.800
we learned a Nobel Prize with what he
 

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.409
we learned a Nobel Prize with what he
did was to ask there's something special

00:07:27.409 --> 00:07:27.419
did was to ask there's something special
 

00:07:27.419 --> 00:07:29.809
did was to ask there's something special
with this hippocampus structure since

00:07:29.809 --> 00:07:29.819
with this hippocampus structure since
 

00:07:29.819 --> 00:07:31.939
with this hippocampus structure since
it's so important for HM and other

00:07:31.939 --> 00:07:31.949
it's so important for HM and other
 

00:07:31.949 --> 00:07:34.519
it's so important for HM and other
patients if you don't have it you can't

00:07:34.519 --> 00:07:34.529
patients if you don't have it you can't
 

00:07:34.529 --> 00:07:38.570
patients if you don't have it you can't
encode episodic memory so he had done a

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:38.580
encode episodic memory so he had done a
 

00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:42.769
encode episodic memory so he had done a
lot and he had small sensors close to

00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:42.779
lot and he had small sensors close to
 

00:07:42.779 --> 00:07:46.100
lot and he had small sensors close to
the cells in the hippocampus and rot was

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:46.110
the cells in the hippocampus and rot was
 

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:49.430
the cells in the hippocampus and rot was
just walking around happy so in his lab

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:49.440
just walking around happy so in his lab
 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:53.180
just walking around happy so in his lab
they got rise in my lab like a chocolate

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:53.190
they got rise in my lab like a chocolate
 

00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:57.499
they got rise in my lab like a chocolate
of course so what happened is that he

00:07:57.499 --> 00:07:57.509
of course so what happened is that he
 

00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:01.040
of course so what happened is that he
was just studying this rat running

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:01.050
was just studying this rat running
 

00:08:01.050 --> 00:08:04.010
was just studying this rat running
around chasing rice or chocolate and

00:08:04.010 --> 00:08:04.020
around chasing rice or chocolate and
 

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.530
around chasing rice or chocolate and
then he asked himself

00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:06.540
then he asked himself
 

00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:11.090
then he asked himself
if I listen to one hippocampus cell what

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:11.100
if I listen to one hippocampus cell what
 

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:15.530
if I listen to one hippocampus cell what
is this hippocampal cell reacting to can

00:08:15.530 --> 00:08:15.540
is this hippocampal cell reacting to can
 

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.530
is this hippocampal cell reacting to can
I understand that and I'm going to play

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:18.540
I understand that and I'm going to play
 

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:21.820
I understand that and I'm going to play
the video and then you can see yourself

00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:21.830
the video and then you can see yourself
 

00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:27.010
the video and then you can see yourself
even though I have given you a cue here

00:08:27.010 --> 00:08:27.020
even though I have given you a cue here
 

00:08:27.020 --> 00:08:32.600
even though I have given you a cue here
so now you hear one single cell that is

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:32.610
so now you hear one single cell that is
 

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:44.690
so now you hear one single cell that is
active and you see the raft is doing

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:44.700
active and you see the raft is doing
 

00:08:44.700 --> 00:09:02.530
active and you see the raft is doing
exactly the same thing chasing chocolate

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:02.540
 
 

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:05.720
 
so what is so special about this corner

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:05.730
so what is so special about this corner
 

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:09.410
so what is so special about this corner
we even use this the color code to show

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:09.420
we even use this the color code to show
 

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.080
we even use this the color code to show
you that there is something very hot in

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.090
you that there is something very hot in
 

00:09:12.090 --> 00:09:14.900
you that there is something very hot in
that corner this cell is responding to

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:14.910
that corner this cell is responding to
 

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:18.140
that corner this cell is responding to
something in that corner and then could

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.150
something in that corner and then could
 

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:20.600
something in that corner and then could
it be that as a special order coulda be

00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:20.610
it be that as a special order coulda be
 

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:25.160
it be that as a special order coulda be
some scratch in the floor what is it so

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:25.170
some scratch in the floor what is it so
 

00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:29.450
some scratch in the floor what is it so
John and others recorded money cells and

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:29.460
John and others recorded money cells and
 

00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:32.990
John and others recorded money cells and
I found out that each cell had its own

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:33.000
I found out that each cell had its own
 

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.010
I found out that each cell had its own
preference

00:09:34.010 --> 00:09:34.020

00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:36.110
preference
where to be active and where to be

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:36.120
where to be active and where to be
 

00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:38.780
where to be active and where to be
silent and if you record more than

00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:38.790
silent and if you record more than
 

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.330
silent and if you record more than
hundred cells at the same time for some

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:41.340
hundred cells at the same time for some
 

00:09:41.340 --> 00:09:45.380
hundred cells at the same time for some
time then you can predict where the

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:45.390
time then you can predict where the
 

00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:49.640
time then you can predict where the

precision that's quite remarkable so

00:09:52.790 --> 00:09:52.800
precision that's quite remarkable so
 

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:55.940
precision that's quite remarkable so
just by listening to the cells of this

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:55.950
just by listening to the cells of this
 

00:09:55.950 --> 00:09:59.000
just by listening to the cells of this
animal you know where the animal is with

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.010
animal you know where the animal is with
 

00:09:59.010 --> 00:10:02.660
animal you know where the animal is with
the precision of 5 centimeters that's

00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:02.670
the precision of 5 centimeters that's
 

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:11.090
the precision of 5 centimeters that's
scary so for every to me it started

00:10:11.090 --> 00:10:11.100
scary so for every to me it started
 

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:13.670
scary so for every to me it started
really started when we could have our

00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680
really started when we could have our
 

00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:18.830
really started when we could have our

that was quite easy at a time we brought

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:42.570
that was quite easy at a time we brought
 

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:47.630
that was quite easy at a time we brought
two children with us and we brought this

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:47.640
two children with us and we brought this
 

00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.570
two children with us and we brought this
technique to Trondheim so the first

00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:50.580
technique to Trondheim so the first

question we had when we explored this

00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:53.910
question we had when we explored this
 

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:57.200
question we had when we explored this
was exactly what I asked you about why

00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:57.210
was exactly what I asked you about why
 

00:10:57.210 --> 00:11:00.290
was exactly what I asked you about why
are these cells active and where is this

00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300
are these cells active and where is this
 

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.350
are these cells active and where is this
information coming from is it so that

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360
information coming from is it so that
 

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.600
information coming from is it so that
the information is processed within the

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:05.610
the information is processed within the
 

00:11:05.610 --> 00:11:09.230
the information is processed within the
hippocampus itself or is it fed in

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240
hippocampus itself or is it fed in
 

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:11.900

this is a rabbit brain drawn by my
supervisor paramedicine you see if you

00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:35.580
supervisor paramedicine you see if you
 

00:11:35.580 --> 00:11:38.090
supervisor paramedicine you see if you
lift the cortex then you see this

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.100
lift the cortex then you see this
 

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.340
lift the cortex then you see this
beautiful structure it looks like a

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:40.350
beautiful structure it looks like a
 

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:44.930
beautiful structure it looks like a
sausage but but but it's beautiful

sausage but but but it's beautiful
and if you don't slice it you see these

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:49.649
and if you don't slice it you see these
 

00:11:49.649 --> 00:11:53.949
and if you don't slice it you see these
lines of cells here and information in

the cortex so we asked is it so that if
 

00:12:09.390 --> 00:12:13.550
the cortex so we asked is it so that if
we block this loop in the hippocampus do

00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:13.560
we block this loop in the hippocampus do
 

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:17.680
we block this loop in the hippocampus do
you still get place else

00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:17.690
you still get place else
 

00:12:17.690 --> 00:12:23.360
you still get place else
yes so we got through higher examples of

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:23.370
yes so we got through higher examples of
 

00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:28.250
yes so we got through higher examples of
seven beautiful places even though we

seven beautiful places even though we
 

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.210
seven beautiful places even though we
cut this loop in the hippocampus so what

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:32.220
cut this loop in the hippocampus so what
 

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.019
cut this loop in the hippocampus so what
did I tell us the information that these

00:12:36.019 --> 00:12:36.029
did I tell us the information that these
 

00:12:36.029 --> 00:12:39.980
did I tell us the information that these
cells use to generate the place signal

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:39.990
cells use to generate the place signal
 

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:43.519

guess that was an tryna cortex so then

00:12:48.889 --> 00:12:48.899
guess that was an tryna cortex so then
 

00:12:48.899 --> 00:12:51.920
guess that was an tryna cortex so then
we took our sensors our electrodes and

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:51.930
we took our sensors our electrodes and
 

00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.819
we took our sensors our electrodes and
we decided to place these electrodes in

00:12:55.819 --> 00:12:55.829
we decided to place these electrodes in
 

00:12:55.829 --> 00:12:58.699
we decided to place these electrodes in
the internal cortex so this is a brain

00:12:58.699 --> 00:12:58.709
the internal cortex so this is a brain
 

00:12:58.709 --> 00:13:02.150
the internal cortex so this is a brain

running his own group and we decided to

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:22.110
running his own group and we decided to
 

00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:23.269
running his own group and we decided to
put our sense

00:13:23.269 --> 00:13:23.279
put our sense
 

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:25.460
put our sense
in the most dorsal part of the middle

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:25.470
in the most dorsal part of the middle
 

00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:28.369
in the most dorsal part of the middle
and around cortex people had been

00:13:28.369 --> 00:13:28.379
and around cortex people had been
 

00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:31.280
and around cortex people had been
recorded up before but they had recorded

00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:31.290
recorded up before but they had recorded
 

00:13:31.290 --> 00:13:33.920
recorded up before but they had recorded
down here and concluded that there is

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:33.930
down here and concluded that there is
 

00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:38.090
down here and concluded that there is
nothing interesting so now you have to

00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:38.100
nothing interesting so now you have to
 

00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.249
nothing interesting so now you have to
see yourself I'm going to play another

see yourself I'm going to play another
video there's no sound but there are

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860
video there's no sound but there are
 

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:48.920
video there's no sound but there are
some white dots telling do you see

00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:48.930
some white dots telling do you see
 

00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:50.900
some white dots telling do you see
anything good there's some strong light

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:50.910
anything good there's some strong light
 

00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.809

00:13:53.819 --> 00:14:00.129
tears I don't know if you see you see it
okay so you see these white dots and

00:14:00.129 --> 00:14:00.139
okay so you see these white dots and
 

00:14:00.139 --> 00:14:04.189
okay so you see these white dots and
this is the activity of one single cell

00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199
this is the activity of one single cell
 

00:14:04.199 --> 00:14:07.100
this is the activity of one single cell
in this area in the internal cortex and

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:07.110
in this area in the internal cortex and
 

00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:10.400
in this area in the internal cortex and
you see that that it looks not so nice

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:10.410
you see that that it looks not so nice
 

00:14:10.410 --> 00:14:13.879
you see that that it looks not so nice
so maybe these people were right there's

00:14:13.879 --> 00:14:13.889
so maybe these people were right there's
 

00:14:13.889 --> 00:14:17.540
so maybe these people were right there's
nothing interesting in the dorsal or in

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:17.550
nothing interesting in the dorsal or in
 

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:22.639
nothing interesting in the dorsal or in
in the entry on the cortex but if you

00:14:22.639 --> 00:14:22.649
in the entry on the cortex but if you
 

00:14:22.649 --> 00:14:26.869
in the entry on the cortex but if you
have a big enough environment and you

00:14:26.869 --> 00:14:26.879
have a big enough environment and you
 

00:14:26.879 --> 00:14:30.860
have a big enough environment and you
have really happy animals that love to

00:14:30.860 --> 00:14:30.870
have really happy animals that love to
 

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.499
have really happy animals that love to
chase chocolates so that you get enough

00:14:33.499 --> 00:14:33.509
chase chocolates so that you get enough
 

00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:37.280
chase chocolates so that you get enough
coverage you get the pattern that looks

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:37.290
coverage you get the pattern that looks
 

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:41.840
coverage you get the pattern that looks
like this so this is another 150 by 150

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:41.850
like this so this is another 150 by 150
 

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:42.439

potential from these cells and what you

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:53.970
potential from these cells and what you
 

00:14:53.970 --> 00:14:57.350
potential from these cells and what you
see here is that there is a very regular

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.360
see here is that there is a very regular
 

00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:01.460
see here is that there is a very regular
pattern and this is biology so it

00:15:01.460 --> 00:15:01.470
pattern and this is biology so it
 

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:05.079
pattern and this is biology so it
shouldn't be so that you can fit in

00:15:05.079 --> 00:15:05.089
shouldn't be so that you can fit in
 

00:15:05.089 --> 00:15:09.139
shouldn't be so that you can fit in
equilateral triangles into a pattern

00:15:09.139 --> 00:15:09.149
equilateral triangles into a pattern
 

00:15:09.149 --> 00:15:13.660
equilateral triangles into a pattern
that is generated from biology and

00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:13.670
that is generated from biology and
 

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:18.049
that is generated from biology and
remember how deep the cell is in the

00:15:18.049 --> 00:15:18.059
remember how deep the cell is in the
 

00:15:18.059 --> 00:15:22.189
remember how deep the cell is in the
brain so we did this together with

00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:22.199
brain so we did this together with
 

00:15:22.199 --> 00:15:24.980
brain so we did this together with
Mariana feenin and until Knopf think

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:24.990
Mariana feenin and until Knopf think
 

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:27.410
Mariana feenin and until Knopf think
when Mariana was a PhD student in our

when Mariana was a PhD student in our
 

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.759
when Mariana was a PhD student in our
lab and we decided that this cell which

00:15:31.759 --> 00:15:31.769
lab and we decided that this cell which
 

00:15:31.769 --> 00:15:33.169

hippocampus might function as
 

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.860
hippocampus might function as
the ruler a metric system in the brain

00:15:39.860 --> 00:15:39.870
the ruler a metric system in the brain
 

00:15:39.870 --> 00:15:43.400
the ruler a metric system in the brain
what this fascinating is that when you

00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:43.410
what this fascinating is that when you
 

00:15:43.410 --> 00:15:47.330
what this fascinating is that when you
go from dorsal to ventral then it's like

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:47.340
go from dorsal to ventral then it's like
 

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:50.330
go from dorsal to ventral then it's like
if you if you draw these grid cell

00:15:50.330 --> 00:15:50.340
if you if you draw these grid cell
 

00:15:50.340 --> 00:15:52.550
if you if you draw these grid cell
pattern on a balloon and you blow up

00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560
pattern on a balloon and you blow up
 

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:56.690
pattern on a balloon and you blow up
then there's an expansion when you go

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:56.700
then there's an expansion when you go
 

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.840
then there's an expansion when you go
more and more mental in this structure

00:15:59.840 --> 00:15:59.850
more and more mental in this structure
 

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:02.300
more and more mental in this structure
that you see here so cell one very

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:02.310
that you see here so cell one very
 

00:16:02.310 --> 00:16:07.280
that you see here so cell one very
torsion small fields close by and then

00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:07.290
torsion small fields close by and then
 

00:16:07.290 --> 00:16:11.000
torsion small fields close by and then
bigger fields further away and then you

00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:11.010
bigger fields further away and then you
 

00:16:11.010 --> 00:16:13.580
bigger fields further away and then you
have fields that are really big and

00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:13.590
have fields that are really big and
 

00:16:13.590 --> 00:16:16.330
have fields that are really big and
quite far away so why do I tell you this

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:16.340
quite far away so why do I tell you this
 

00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:19.070
quite far away so why do I tell you this
because I want to bring you back to your

00:16:19.070 --> 00:16:19.080
because I want to bring you back to your
 

00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:24.280
because I want to bring you back to your
poor compass and ask how can you come

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:24.290
poor compass and ask how can you come
 

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:28.400
poor compass and ask how can you come
from these grid cells to a place that is

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:28.410
from these grid cells to a place that is
 

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:29.660
from these grid cells to a place that is
that possible

00:16:29.660 --> 00:16:29.670
that possible
 

00:16:29.670 --> 00:16:34.940
that possible
because that is our hypothesis yes you

00:16:34.940 --> 00:16:34.950
because that is our hypothesis yes you
 

00:16:34.950 --> 00:16:35.510
because that is our hypothesis yes you
can

00:16:35.510 --> 00:16:35.520
can
 

00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:39.200
can
so if you align these grid cells on top

00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:39.210
so if you align these grid cells on top
 

00:16:39.210 --> 00:16:41.420
so if you align these grid cells on top
of each other you just do a normal

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:41.430
of each other you just do a normal
 

00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:45.050
of each other you just do a normal
linear summation then you see here in

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:45.060
linear summation then you see here in
 

00:16:45.060 --> 00:16:49.310
linear summation then you see here in
the middle there's a bump but at the

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:49.320
the middle there's a bump but at the
 

00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:52.100
the middle there's a bump but at the
edges everything is canceled out and

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:52.110
edges everything is canceled out and
 

00:16:52.110 --> 00:16:55.640
edges everything is canceled out and
what do you get then you get one pump as

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:55.650
what do you get then you get one pump as
 

00:16:55.650 --> 00:17:00.500
what do you get then you get one pump as
we saw in the hippocampus I have another

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:00.510
we saw in the hippocampus I have another
 

00:17:00.510 --> 00:17:05.300
we saw in the hippocampus I have another
question to ask - and that is how carry

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:05.310
question to ask - and that is how carry
 

00:17:05.310 --> 00:17:09.530
question to ask - and that is how carry
this cell be so precise it doesn't have

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:09.540
this cell be so precise it doesn't have
 

00:17:09.540 --> 00:17:11.300
this cell be so precise it doesn't have
eyes it doesn't have ears it doesn't

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:11.310
eyes it doesn't have ears it doesn't
 

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:14.870
eyes it doesn't have ears it doesn't
have a nose except on the animal of

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880
have a nose except on the animal of
 

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:18.050
have a nose except on the animal of
course so what type of information does

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:18.060
course so what type of information does
 

00:17:18.060 --> 00:17:21.429
course so what type of information does
this cell need in order to be so precise

00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439
this cell need in order to be so precise
 

00:17:21.439 --> 00:17:24.920
this cell need in order to be so precise
it needs to know the direction of the

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:24.930
it needs to know the direction of the
 

00:17:24.930 --> 00:17:27.260
it needs to know the direction of the
animal and it needs to know the speed

00:17:27.260 --> 00:17:27.270
animal and it needs to know the speed
 

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:29.780
animal and it needs to know the speed
because when the animal is eating

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:29.790
because when the animal is eating
 

00:17:29.790 --> 00:17:32.450
because when the animal is eating
chocolate it's stopping its running fast

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:32.460
chocolate it's stopping its running fast
 

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.820
chocolate it's stopping its running fast
and it's changing position all the time

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:34.830
and it's changing position all the time
 

00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:38.680
and it's changing position all the time
so then we asked are there such cells

00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:38.690
so then we asked are there such cells
 

00:17:38.690 --> 00:17:42.470
so then we asked are there such cells
close to the grid cells and Franciscus

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:42.480
close to the grid cells and Franciscus
 

00:17:42.480 --> 00:17:45.620

are greenly from Rome she came to a lab

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:45.630
are greenly from Rome she came to a lab
 

00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:49.650
are greenly from Rome she came to a lab
and she showed that are some cells

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:49.660
and she showed that are some cells
 

00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:53.400
and she showed that are some cells
to the grid cells that we call head

00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:53.410
to the grid cells that we call head
 

00:17:53.410 --> 00:17:54.840
to the grid cells that we call head
Direction cells and they were not

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:54.850
Direction cells and they were not
 

00:17:54.850 --> 00:17:56.790
Direction cells and they were not
discovered by us because they were

00:17:56.790 --> 00:17:56.800
discovered by us because they were
 

00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.480
discovered by us because they were
discovered in another brain area by a

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:00.490
discovered in another brain area by a
 

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:06.810

cortex so these cells work like this so

00:18:12.990 --> 00:18:13.000
cortex so these cells work like this so
 

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.240
cortex so these cells work like this so
when the animal is going west

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:15.250
when the animal is going west

when the animal is going west
then his Papa Papa Papa and then there's

00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520
then his Papa Papa Papa and then there's
 

00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:21.240
then his Papa Papa Papa and then there's
another cell so it doesn't help if

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:21.250
another cell so it doesn't help if
 

00:18:21.250 --> 00:18:23.310

they're a novela is going only to west

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:23.320
they're a novela is going only to west
 

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.890
they're a novela is going only to west
but it has to point north in order to

00:18:25.890 --> 00:18:25.900
but it has to point north in order to
 

00:18:25.900 --> 00:18:28.320
but it has to point north in order to
get this cell to be active so this

00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:28.330
get this cell to be active so this
 

00:18:28.330 --> 00:18:31.200
get this cell to be active so this
information is then giving to given to

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.210
information is then giving to given to
 

00:18:31.210 --> 00:18:35.130
information is then giving to given to
the grid cell but we also need

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:35.140
the grid cell but we also need
 

00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:37.410
the grid cell but we also need
information about the speed of the

00:18:37.410 --> 00:18:37.420
information about the speed of the
 

00:18:37.420 --> 00:18:40.430
information about the speed of the
animal and then the question this

00:18:40.430 --> 00:18:40.440
animal and then the question this
 

00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:45.560

you want to find cells that respond to

00:19:01.740 --> 00:19:01.750
you want to find cells that respond to
 

00:19:01.750 --> 00:19:04.050
you want to find cells that respond to
the speed of the animal you have to

00:19:04.050 --> 00:19:04.060
the speed of the animal you have to
 

00:19:04.060 --> 00:19:06.860
the speed of the animal you have to
control the speed of the animal and then

00:19:06.860 --> 00:19:06.870
control the speed of the animal and then
 

00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:10.100
control the speed of the animal and then
if you can decide the speed of the car

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:10.110
if you can decide the speed of the car
 

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:11.820
if you can decide the speed of the car
then it's fine

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:11.830
then it's fine
 

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.950
then it's fine
but it's not completely fine because the

00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:13.960
but it's not completely fine because the
 

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:16.920
but it's not completely fine because the
animal might fall asleep so how can you

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:16.930
animal might fall asleep so how can you
 

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.190
animal might fall asleep so how can you
keep the animal awake animal has to run

00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200
keep the animal awake animal has to run
 

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.590
keep the animal awake animal has to run
and that is why we have the Flintstone

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600
and that is why we have the Flintstone
 

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:25.170
and that is why we have the Flintstone
car here to remind us that the animal is

00:19:25.170 --> 00:19:25.180
car here to remind us that the animal is
 

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:26.940
car here to remind us that the animal is
running and in this way

00:19:26.940 --> 00:19:26.950
running and in this way
 

00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:29.730
running and in this way
Emilio could change the speed of the

you have seen how so many times on these

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:31.660
you have seen how so many times on these
 

00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.790
you have seen how so many times on these
videos so here we have 12 cells and what

00:20:35.790 --> 00:20:35.800
videos so here we have 12 cells and what
 

00:20:35.800 --> 00:20:38.760
videos so here we have 12 cells and what
you see here is that the pattern and the

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:38.770
you see here is that the pattern and the
 

00:20:38.770 --> 00:20:41.190
you see here is that the pattern and the
firing pattern is not interesting but

00:20:41.190 --> 00:20:41.200
firing pattern is not interesting but
 

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:44.180
firing pattern is not interesting but
what is interesting is to see the

00:20:44.180 --> 00:20:44.190
what is interesting is to see the
 

00:20:44.190 --> 00:20:47.550
what is interesting is to see the
correlation between the activity of the

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:47.560
correlation between the activity of the
 

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.900
correlation between the activity of the

linear summation so these two types of

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:00.850
linear summation so these two types of
 

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:05.460
linear summation so these two types of
cells they inform the grid cells about

00:21:05.460 --> 00:21:05.470
cells they inform the grid cells about
 

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:09.020
cells they inform the grid cells about
the speed of the animal and direction

00:21:09.020 --> 00:21:09.030
the speed of the animal and direction
 

00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:13.620
the speed of the animal and direction
then we asked the question how is this

00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:13.630
then we asked the question how is this
 

00:21:13.630 --> 00:21:18.740
then we asked the question how is this
process running and we had two Chinese

00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:18.750
process running and we had two Chinese
 

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:22.080
process running and we had two Chinese

the precision of the firing of the grid
 

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:41.220
the precision of the firing of the grid
cells so to address that question they

00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:41.230
cells so to address that question they
 

00:21:41.230 --> 00:21:45.840
cells so to address that question they
ordered cream eyes that had a creativity

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:45.850
ordered cream eyes that had a creativity
 

00:21:45.850 --> 00:21:49.200
ordered cream eyes that had a creativity
on the part of mean cells and also the

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:49.210
on the part of mean cells and also the
 

00:21:49.210 --> 00:21:53.420
on the part of mean cells and also the
somatostatin and they used this

00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:53.430
somatostatin and they used this
 

00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:57.000
somatostatin and they used this
artificial receptor technique the dred

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:57.010
artificial receptor technique the dred
 

00:21:57.010 --> 00:21:59.370
artificial receptor technique the dred
technique so you just use the virus then

00:21:59.370 --> 00:21:59.380
technique so you just use the virus then
 

00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:01.770
technique so you just use the virus then
that will go only to those cells that

00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:01.780
that will go only to those cells that
 

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.910
that will go only to those cells that
has the critic in this mutant mice and

00:22:05.910 --> 00:22:05.920
has the critic in this mutant mice and
 

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:09.420
has the critic in this mutant mice and
then you use an artificial lightened

00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:09.430
then you use an artificial lightened
 

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:12.510
then you use an artificial lightened
like this you know and then you can

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:12.520
like this you know and then you can
 

00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:16.140
like this you know and then you can
activate or inhibit only those cells

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:16.150
activate or inhibit only those cells
 

00:22:16.150 --> 00:22:16.890
activate or inhibit only those cells
that

00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:37.450
when the drug is working and this is
 

00:22:37.450 --> 00:22:40.140
when the drug is working and this is
when the drug is leaving the body and

00:22:40.140 --> 00:22:40.150
when the drug is leaving the body and
 

00:22:40.150 --> 00:22:43.740
when the drug is leaving the body and
you see that when there is drug in the

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:43.750
you see that when there is drug in the
 

00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:47.370
you see that when there is drug in the
brain of this mouse this grid cell

00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:47.380
brain of this mouse this grid cell
 

00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:49.140
brain of this mouse this grid cell
doesn't look like a grid cell anymore

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:49.150
doesn't look like a grid cell anymore
 

00:22:49.150 --> 00:22:52.950
doesn't look like a grid cell anymore
and if you ask the grid square how much

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960
and if you ask the grid square how much
 

00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:57.600
and if you ask the grid square how much
grid-like is there cells then you see

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:57.610
grid-like is there cells then you see
 

00:22:57.610 --> 00:23:00.900
grid-like is there cells then you see
that when this drug is working then we

00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:00.910
that when this drug is working then we
 

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:04.380
that when this drug is working then we
have much fewer grid cells in these mice

00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:04.390
have much fewer grid cells in these mice
 

00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:07.530
have much fewer grid cells in these mice
than before and the same thing happened

00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:07.540
than before and the same thing happened
 

00:23:07.540 --> 00:23:10.260
than before and the same thing happened
with the speed so you see here's the

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:10.270
with the speed so you see here's the
 

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:13.230
with the speed so you see here's the
speed signal when they have the drug

00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:13.240
speed signal when they have the drug
 

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:16.380
speed signal when they have the drug
it's flat when the drug is out of the

00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:16.390
it's flat when the drug is out of the
 

00:23:16.390 --> 00:23:18.570
it's flat when the drug is out of the
body then there's a speed signal and

00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:18.580
body then there's a speed signal and
 

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:21.330
body then there's a speed signal and
that is summed up here and you see that

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:21.340
that is summed up here and you see that
 

00:23:21.340 --> 00:23:25.860
that is summed up here and you see that
the speed score is very very bad when

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:25.870
the speed score is very very bad when
 

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:29.040
the speed score is very very bad when
when this drug is working and then so

00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:29.050
when this drug is working and then so
 

00:23:29.050 --> 00:23:32.070
when this drug is working and then so
what we showed here is that the power of

00:23:32.070 --> 00:23:32.080
what we showed here is that the power of
 

00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:35.250
what we showed here is that the power of
immune cells are giving inhibition to

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:35.260
immune cells are giving inhibition to
 

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:37.530
immune cells are giving inhibition to
the grid cells to keep the correct

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:37.540
the grid cells to keep the correct
 

00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:39.600
the grid cells to keep the correct
position of the fields and the

00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:39.610
position of the fields and the
 

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:41.010
position of the fields and the
somatostatin

00:23:41.010 --> 00:23:41.020
somatostatin
 

00:23:41.020 --> 00:23:44.760
somatostatin
they did not have this effect but I

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:44.770
they did not have this effect but I
 

00:23:44.770 --> 00:23:50.630
they did not have this effect but I
worked on on on different type of cells

00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640
 
 

00:23:50.640 --> 00:23:53.850
 
so I'm sorry that I'm I'm rushing

00:23:53.850 --> 00:23:53.860
so I'm sorry that I'm I'm rushing
 

00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:55.920
so I'm sorry that I'm I'm rushing
because I have so much to tell you I

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:55.930
because I have so much to tell you I
 

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.930
because I have so much to tell you I
don't know that I have limited time so

00:23:57.930 --> 00:23:57.940
don't know that I have limited time so
 

00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.360
don't know that I have limited time so
you have to shout at me if you think

00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:00.370
you have to shout at me if you think
 

00:24:00.370 --> 00:24:04.260
you have to shout at me if you think
that I should move on or go a bit slower

00:24:04.260 --> 00:24:04.270
that I should move on or go a bit slower
 

00:24:04.270 --> 00:24:08.430
that I should move on or go a bit slower
or we have some questions at the end we

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440
or we have some questions at the end we
 

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.220
or we have some questions at the end we
also want to compare the different maps

00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:11.230
also want to compare the different maps
 

00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:17.330
also want to compare the different maps
in the hippocampus and and the

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:17.340
in the hippocampus and and the
 

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:22.680
in the hippocampus and and the
entorhinal cortex and what is that very

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:22.690
entorhinal cortex and what is that very
 

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.690
entorhinal cortex and what is that very
very different

00:24:24.690 --> 00:24:24.700
very different
 

00:24:24.700 --> 00:24:28.500
very different
these maps so the grid maps they work

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:28.510
these maps so the grid maps they work
 

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:30.510
these maps so the grid maps they work
together all the greats

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:30.520
together all the greats
 

00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:33.510
together all the greats
from the same motor and it's like a

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:33.520
from the same motor and it's like a
 

00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:36.330
from the same motor and it's like a
mathematical paper that you bring with

00:24:36.330 --> 00:24:36.340
mathematical paper that you bring with
 

00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:36.630
mathematical paper that you bring with
you

00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640
you
 

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:38.790
you
you might rotate it you might shift it

00:24:38.790 --> 00:24:38.800
you might rotate it you might shift it
 

00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:43.170
you might rotate it you might shift it
but it's always the same and that is

00:24:43.170 --> 00:24:43.180
but it's always the same and that is
 

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:45.840
but it's always the same and that is
illustrated here that you go from room

00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:45.850
illustrated here that you go from room
 

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:49.290
illustrated here that you go from room
to room and it's absolutely the same map

00:24:49.290 --> 00:24:49.300
to room and it's absolutely the same map
 

00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.220
to room and it's absolutely the same map

PhD student in the lab she worked with

00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:56.470
PhD student in the lab she worked with
 

00:24:56.470 --> 00:24:59.910
PhD student in the lab she worked with
the hippocampus and she tested the

00:24:59.910 --> 00:24:59.920
the hippocampus and she tested the
 

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:04.230
the hippocampus and she tested the
animals in eleven rooms and she asked is

00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240
animals in eleven rooms and she asked is
 

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:07.560
animals in eleven rooms and she asked is
it so that the hippocampal map is

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:07.570
it so that the hippocampal map is
 

00:25:07.570 --> 00:25:10.890
it so that the hippocampal map is
similar to the internal map that it is

00:25:10.890 --> 00:25:10.900
similar to the internal map that it is
 

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:13.470
similar to the internal map that it is
the same map that is used over and over

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:13.480
the same map that is used over and over
 

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:17.670
the same map that is used over and over
again or does the hippocampus create new

00:25:17.670 --> 00:25:17.680
again or does the hippocampus create new
 

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.480
again or does the hippocampus create new
maps and what is a map in this case it's

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:21.490
maps and what is a map in this case it's
 

00:25:21.490 --> 00:25:25.920
maps and what is a map in this case it's
the activity of the different cells so

00:25:25.920 --> 00:25:25.930
the activity of the different cells so
 

00:25:25.930 --> 00:25:28.320
the activity of the different cells so
what she did was to put all the

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:28.330
what she did was to put all the
 

00:25:28.330 --> 00:25:31.070
what she did was to put all the
recordings from the different eleven

00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080
recordings from the different eleven
 

00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:35.370
recordings from the different eleven
exposures to different rooms put them on

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:35.380
exposures to different rooms put them on
 

00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:39.090
exposures to different rooms put them on
top of each other and then she asked odd

00:25:39.090 --> 00:25:39.100
top of each other and then she asked odd
 

00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:41.730
top of each other and then she asked odd
is correlated and you see here's

00:25:41.730 --> 00:25:41.740
is correlated and you see here's
 

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:44.040
is correlated and you see here's
familiar one familiar one and of course

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:44.050
familiar one familiar one and of course
 

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:47.190
familiar one familiar one and of course
the same room is very correlated but

00:25:47.190 --> 00:25:47.200
the same room is very correlated but
 

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:50.010
the same room is very correlated but
it's a lot of blue here meaning that

00:25:50.010 --> 00:25:50.020
it's a lot of blue here meaning that
 

00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:52.770
it's a lot of blue here meaning that
it's not correlated at all that means

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:52.780
it's not correlated at all that means
 

00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.920
it's not correlated at all that means
that cells that are active in this room

00:25:55.920 --> 00:25:55.930
that cells that are active in this room
 

00:25:55.930 --> 00:26:00.350
that cells that are active in this room
are not active at all in the other rooms

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360
are not active at all in the other rooms
 

00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:03.780
are not active at all in the other rooms
except if you go back to the same room

00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:03.790
except if you go back to the same room
 

00:26:03.790 --> 00:26:07.770
except if you go back to the same room
then even after one exposure the

00:26:07.770 --> 00:26:07.780
then even after one exposure the
 

00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:11.490
then even after one exposure the
hippocampus is using the same map so to

00:26:11.490 --> 00:26:11.500
hippocampus is using the same map so to
 

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:15.330
hippocampus is using the same map so to
just sum it up it seems like we have so

00:26:15.330 --> 00:26:15.340
just sum it up it seems like we have so
 

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:17.880
just sum it up it seems like we have so
many uncorrelated maps in the

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:17.890
many uncorrelated maps in the
 

00:26:17.890 --> 00:26:20.100
many uncorrelated maps in the
hippocampus where you can store your

00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:20.110
hippocampus where you can store your
 

00:26:20.110 --> 00:26:24.420
hippocampus where you can store your
memory and that is different and from

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:24.430
memory and that is different and from
 

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:28.140
memory and that is different and from
the grid cells that can rather give the

00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:28.150
the grid cells that can rather give the
 

00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:33.870
the grid cells that can rather give the
metric to the spatial input so then we

00:26:33.870 --> 00:26:33.880
metric to the spatial input so then we
 

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.940
metric to the spatial input so then we
have to rush on to ask the next question

00:26:37.940 --> 00:26:37.950
have to rush on to ask the next question
 

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:43.820
have to rush on to ask the next question
or any indication of information in the

00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:43.830
or any indication of information in the
 

00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:46.220
or any indication of information in the
and Tirana cortex telling the

00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:46.230
and Tirana cortex telling the
 

00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:50.240
and Tirana cortex telling the
hippocampus about time then we got this

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:50.250
hippocampus about time then we got this
 

00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.360
hippocampus about time then we got this

00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:38.860
love this PhD student so much because he
was so skilled we said this is not right

00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:38.870
was so skilled we said this is not right
 

00:27:38.870 --> 00:27:42.440
was so skilled we said this is not right
because he had so unstable recordings

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:42.450
because he had so unstable recordings
 

00:27:42.450 --> 00:27:46.030
because he had so unstable recordings
that we said something must be wrong and

00:27:46.030 --> 00:27:46.040
that we said something must be wrong and
 

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:51.170
that we said something must be wrong and
it took him eight years and us to

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:51.180
it took him eight years and us to
 

00:27:51.180 --> 00:27:53.840
it took him eight years and us to
discuss this and before he found out

00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:53.850
discuss this and before he found out
 

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:57.260
discuss this and before he found out
what was wrong with the data what was

00:27:57.260 --> 00:27:57.270
what was wrong with the data what was
 

00:27:57.270 --> 00:28:00.350
what was wrong with the data what was
wrong with it data was that time had

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360
wrong with it data was that time had
 

00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:04.550
wrong with it data was that time had
been running in between and this is

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:04.560
been running in between and this is
 

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:08.720
been running in between and this is
illustrated in the experiment that he

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:08.730
illustrated in the experiment that he
 

00:28:08.730 --> 00:28:13.250
illustrated in the experiment that he
and and Jurgen another PhD student or a

00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260
and and Jurgen another PhD student or a
 

00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:18.440
and and Jurgen another PhD student or a
postdoc in the lab did so that was in

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:18.450
postdoc in the lab did so that was in
 

00:28:18.450 --> 00:28:20.600
postdoc in the lab did so that was in
the same room you can have this

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:20.610
the same room you can have this
 

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:22.070
the same room you can have this
situation where the animal is running

00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080
situation where the animal is running
 

00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:24.230
situation where the animal is running
around in this box you can have white

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:24.240
around in this box you can have white
 

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.230
around in this box you can have white
walls black walls and you run the animal

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:27.240
walls black walls and you run the animal
 

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.480
walls black walls and you run the animal
put the animal in the box put it back

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:29.490
put the animal in the box put it back
 

00:28:29.490 --> 00:28:32.360
put the animal in the box put it back
again you clean between each and that is

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:32.370
again you clean between each and that is
 

00:28:32.370 --> 00:28:34.490
again you clean between each and that is
exactly what happened so this is the

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:34.500
exactly what happened so this is the
 

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.200
exactly what happened so this is the
black box white box whatever

00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:36.210
black box white box whatever
 

00:28:36.210 --> 00:28:38.420
black box white box whatever
white box and then in between you have

00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:38.430
white box and then in between you have
 

00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:42.110
white box and then in between you have
this pot situation what happened with

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120
this pot situation what happened with
 

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:45.920
this pot situation what happened with
the cells is that each individual cells

00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:45.930
the cells is that each individual cells
 

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.920
the cells is that each individual cells
seemed to respond differently to this

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:48.930
seemed to respond differently to this
 

00:28:48.930 --> 00:28:49.790
seemed to respond differently to this
situation

00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:49.800
situation
 

00:28:49.800 --> 00:28:53.000
situation
so if we go to this cell this cell said

00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:53.010
so if we go to this cell this cell said
 

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:57.110
so if we go to this cell this cell said
I'm measuring how much time the

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:57.120
I'm measuring how much time the
 

00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:59.660
I'm measuring how much time the
animal is running in the box so you see

00:28:59.660 --> 00:28:59.670
animal is running in the box so you see
 

00:28:59.670 --> 00:29:03.140
animal is running in the box so you see
if it's the black box the firing rate is

00:29:03.140 --> 00:29:03.150
if it's the black box the firing rate is
 

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:06.049
if it's the black box the firing rate is
slow and then increasing low increasing

00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059
slow and then increasing low increasing
 

00:29:06.059 --> 00:29:09.590
slow and then increasing low increasing
low increasing so it's measuring time in

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:09.600
low increasing so it's measuring time in
 

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:13.670
low increasing so it's measuring time in
or the trial time this cell is doing

00:29:13.670 --> 00:29:13.680
or the trial time this cell is doing
 

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:17.810
or the trial time this cell is doing
something different it's measuring the

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:17.820
something different it's measuring the
 

00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:20.990
something different it's measuring the
whole session starting with high firing

00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000
whole session starting with high firing
 

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.020
whole session starting with high firing
rate and at the end of the last white

00:29:24.020 --> 00:29:24.030
rate and at the end of the last white
 

00:29:24.030 --> 00:29:27.400
rate and at the end of the last white
box it is almost no firing at all and

00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:27.410
box it is almost no firing at all and
 

00:29:27.410 --> 00:29:32.140
box it is almost no firing at all and
another cell is telling about what color

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:32.150
another cell is telling about what color
 

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:36.980
another cell is telling about what color
the box had and also how much time the

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:36.990
the box had and also how much time the
 

00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:40.070
the box had and also how much time the
rat was spending in each box and then

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080
rat was spending in each box and then
 

00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:42.020
rat was spending in each box and then
you have the same thing here with with

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.030
you have the same thing here with with
 

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.850
you have the same thing here with with
the world color and the different

00:29:43.850 --> 00:29:43.860
the world color and the different
 

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:47.150
the world color and the different
sessions so this was the confusing part

00:29:47.150 --> 00:29:47.160
sessions so this was the confusing part
 

00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:50.630
sessions so this was the confusing part
so then Albert came up with what if we

00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640
so then Albert came up with what if we
 

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:55.930
so then Albert came up with what if we
use the general linear model to to ask

00:29:55.930 --> 00:29:55.940
use the general linear model to to ask
 

00:29:55.940 --> 00:30:01.640
use the general linear model to to ask
what can tell us best how can explain

00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:01.650
what can tell us best how can explain
 

00:30:01.650 --> 00:30:03.980
what can tell us best how can explain
the variance in these data in the best

00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:03.990
the variance in these data in the best
 

00:30:03.990 --> 00:30:06.410
the variance in these data in the best
way so then he asked what about the

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:06.420
way so then he asked what about the
 

00:30:06.420 --> 00:30:08.600
way so then he asked what about the
world color does that explain any

00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:08.610
world color does that explain any
 

00:30:08.610 --> 00:30:11.960
world color does that explain any
variance at all and he compared the data

00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:11.970
variance at all and he compared the data
 

00:30:11.970 --> 00:30:14.360
variance at all and he compared the data
from the lateral entorhinal cortex which

00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:14.370
from the lateral entorhinal cortex which
 

00:30:14.370 --> 00:30:16.490
from the lateral entorhinal cortex which
structures that we were happy about to

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:16.500
structures that we were happy about to
 

00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.070
structures that we were happy about to
see a tree from the hippocampus and

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080
see a tree from the hippocampus and
 

00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:21.590
see a tree from the hippocampus and
medial internal cortex and not much

00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600
medial internal cortex and not much
 

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.760
medial internal cortex and not much
happened when it was only wool color

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:24.770
happened when it was only wool color
 

00:30:24.770 --> 00:30:28.340
happened when it was only wool color
then he asked about the position and you

00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:28.350
then he asked about the position and you
 

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.830
then he asked about the position and you
see that the middle internal cortex with

00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840
see that the middle internal cortex with
 

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:34.940
see that the middle internal cortex with
the grid cells they signal position best

00:30:34.940 --> 00:30:34.950
the grid cells they signal position best
 

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:39.470
the grid cells they signal position best
of these three structures then he asked

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480
of these three structures then he asked
 

00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:43.940
of these three structures then he asked
about wall color and position asking is

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:43.950
about wall color and position asking is
 

00:30:43.950 --> 00:30:47.390
about wall color and position asking is
it a white box or black box and where is

00:30:47.390 --> 00:30:47.400
it a white box or black box and where is
 

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.990
it a white box or black box and where is
the animal in the box then we see a tree

00:30:50.990 --> 00:30:51.000
the animal in the box then we see a tree
 

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.090
the animal in the box then we see a tree
said hey this is my function then he

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:56.100
said hey this is my function then he
 

00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:00.640
said hey this is my function then he
came to lateral and Rhino cortex and

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:00.650
came to lateral and Rhino cortex and
 

00:31:00.650 --> 00:31:03.350
came to lateral and Rhino cortex and
lateral anterior cortex was telling

00:31:03.350 --> 00:31:03.360
lateral anterior cortex was telling
 

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.590
lateral anterior cortex was telling
about time so it was like a clock

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600
about time so it was like a clock
 

00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.870
about time so it was like a clock
ticking tick tock tick tock tick tock

00:31:08.870 --> 00:31:08.880
ticking tick tock tick tock tick tock
 

00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:10.760
ticking tick tock tick tock tick tock
and giving a tag

00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:10.770
and giving a tag
 

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:13.670
and giving a tag
to each episode that the animal

00:31:13.670 --> 00:31:13.680
to each episode that the animal
 

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:19.060
to each episode that the animal
experienced each box and this is just

00:31:19.060 --> 00:31:19.070
experienced each box and this is just
 

00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:22.220
experienced each box and this is just
when it was mixed it didn't say much so

00:31:22.220 --> 00:31:22.230
when it was mixed it didn't say much so
 

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:24.110
when it was mixed it didn't say much so
it seems like you have this roaming

00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120
it seems like you have this roaming
 

00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:27.110
it seems like you have this roaming
clock that can give you a tag to every

00:31:27.110 --> 00:31:27.120
clock that can give you a tag to every
 

00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:29.840
clock that can give you a tag to every
episode ik memory so that you can sort

00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:29.850
episode ik memory so that you can sort
 

00:31:29.850 --> 00:31:33.050
episode ik memory so that you can sort
your episodic memories in the correct

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:33.060
your episodic memories in the correct
 

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:38.030
your episodic memories in the correct
sequence but as the spatial information

00:31:38.030 --> 00:31:38.040
sequence but as the spatial information
 

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:43.070
sequence but as the spatial information
is subjective also time is subjective

00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080
is subjective also time is subjective
 

00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:45.470
is subjective also time is subjective
and you know that maybe some of you

00:31:45.470 --> 00:31:45.480
and you know that maybe some of you
 

00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:48.800
and you know that maybe some of you
think that this is such a slowly moving

00:31:48.800 --> 00:31:48.810
think that this is such a slowly moving
 

00:31:48.810 --> 00:31:52.790
think that this is such a slowly moving
hour and some of you think oh time is

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:52.800
hour and some of you think oh time is
 

00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.930
hour and some of you think oh time is
going so fast

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:53.940
going so fast
 

00:31:53.940 --> 00:31:57.140
going so fast
and this happens also in the brain of

00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:57.150
and this happens also in the brain of
 

00:31:57.150 --> 00:31:59.960
and this happens also in the brain of
these animals because when the animals

00:31:59.960 --> 00:31:59.970
these animals because when the animals
 

00:31:59.970 --> 00:32:03.050
these animals because when the animals
were allowed to run in another task that

00:32:03.050 --> 00:32:03.060
were allowed to run in another task that
 

00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:06.260
were allowed to run in another task that
was very repetitive so they were asked

00:32:06.260 --> 00:32:06.270
was very repetitive so they were asked
 

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:09.470
was very repetitive so they were asked
run and his ate maze out them down

00:32:09.470 --> 00:32:09.480
run and his ate maze out them down
 

00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:11.270
run and his ate maze out them down
and up and down and up and down and they

00:32:11.270 --> 00:32:11.280
and up and down and up and down and they
 

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:16.730
and up and down and up and down and they
got a reward ten time between each trial

00:32:16.730 --> 00:32:16.740
got a reward ten time between each trial
 

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:20.480
got a reward ten time between each trial
that they went to this apparatus was

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:20.490
that they went to this apparatus was
 

00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.270
that they went to this apparatus was
gone they couldn't these cells didn't

00:32:23.270 --> 00:32:23.280
gone they couldn't these cells didn't
 

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:28.190
gone they couldn't these cells didn't
tell much about that time but now these

00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200
tell much about that time but now these
 

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:31.520
tell much about that time but now these
cells this exactly the same selves told

00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:31.530
cells this exactly the same selves told
 

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:35.470
cells this exactly the same selves told
about how much we're in this apparatus

00:32:35.470 --> 00:32:35.480
about how much we're in this apparatus
 

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:40.460
about how much we're in this apparatus
is the animal because the experience is

00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:40.470
is the animal because the experience is
 

00:32:40.470 --> 00:32:43.610
is the animal because the experience is
telling you about time and this

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620
telling you about time and this
 

00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:46.940
telling you about time and this
experience is so different from running

00:32:46.940 --> 00:32:46.950
experience is so different from running
 

00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:51.260
experience is so different from running
in these different boxes how much time

00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:51.270
in these different boxes how much time
 

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.250
in these different boxes how much time
do I have now

00:32:52.250 --> 00:32:52.260
do I have now
 

00:32:52.260 --> 00:32:57.140
do I have now
I have 10 minutes maybe or less 5 15

00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:57.150
I have 10 minutes maybe or less 5 15
 

00:32:57.150 --> 00:32:59.560
I have 10 minutes maybe or less 5 15
minutes you are an angel

00:32:59.560 --> 00:32:59.570
minutes you are an angel
 

00:32:59.570 --> 00:33:02.940
minutes you are an angel
Wow then I can relax

00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:02.950
Wow then I can relax
 

00:33:02.950 --> 00:33:09.529
Wow then I can relax
ah okay so then the last question

00:33:09.529 --> 00:33:09.539
ah okay so then the last question
 

00:33:09.539 --> 00:33:12.450
ah okay so then the last question
because when we have memories we don't

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:12.460
because when we have memories we don't
 

00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:15.810
because when we have memories we don't
only know where it happened when it

00:33:15.810 --> 00:33:15.820
only know where it happened when it
 

00:33:15.820 --> 00:33:16.769
only know where it happened when it
happened

00:33:16.769 --> 00:33:16.779
happened
 

00:33:16.779 --> 00:33:19.680
happened
did it happen before lunch or didn't

00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:19.690
did it happen before lunch or didn't
 

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:22.590
did it happen before lunch or didn't
happen after lunch but we also have

00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600
happen after lunch but we also have
 

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:26.220
happen after lunch but we also have
people in our memories we have objects

00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:26.230
people in our memories we have objects
 

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:28.979
people in our memories we have objects
and for the rats it's easier for us if

00:33:28.979 --> 00:33:28.989
and for the rats it's easier for us if
 

00:33:28.989 --> 00:33:34.489
and for the rats it's easier for us if
we ask this what question with objects

00:33:34.489 --> 00:33:34.499
we ask this what question with objects
 

00:33:34.499 --> 00:33:37.979
we ask this what question with objects
so we have this situation for the route

00:33:37.979 --> 00:33:37.989
so we have this situation for the route
 

00:33:37.989 --> 00:33:43.049
so we have this situation for the route
or for the mouse that animal is exposed

00:33:43.049 --> 00:33:43.059
or for the mouse that animal is exposed
 

00:33:43.059 --> 00:33:47.369
or for the mouse that animal is exposed
to at deplore or Lego tower or some toys

00:33:47.369 --> 00:33:47.379
to at deplore or Lego tower or some toys
 

00:33:47.379 --> 00:33:49.889
to at deplore or Lego tower or some toys
that we put in because you remember the

00:33:49.889 --> 00:33:49.899
that we put in because you remember the
 

00:33:49.899 --> 00:33:53.789
that we put in because you remember the
other boxes they had only chocolate now

00:33:53.789 --> 00:33:53.799
other boxes they had only chocolate now
 

00:33:53.799 --> 00:33:59.970
other boxes they had only chocolate now
we have chocolate and a queue and Jim

00:33:59.970 --> 00:33:59.980
we have chocolate and a queue and Jim
 

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:04.560
we have chocolate and a queue and Jim
Kinnear him in in the states he asked

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:04.570
Kinnear him in in the states he asked
 

00:34:04.570 --> 00:34:08.220
Kinnear him in in the states he asked
this question first so he had these

00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:08.230
this question first so he had these
 

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:11.129
this question first so he had these
different objects he put them in the box

00:34:11.129 --> 00:34:11.139
different objects he put them in the box
 

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:13.409
different objects he put them in the box
did exactly what we have been doing

00:34:13.409 --> 00:34:13.419
did exactly what we have been doing
 

00:34:13.419 --> 00:34:16.039
did exactly what we have been doing
giving the animal chocolate and these

00:34:16.039 --> 00:34:16.049
giving the animal chocolate and these
 

00:34:16.049 --> 00:34:22.079
giving the animal chocolate and these
white circles that is that is four of

00:34:22.079 --> 00:34:22.089
white circles that is that is four of
 

00:34:22.089 --> 00:34:24.659
white circles that is that is four of
these objects and then these are

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:24.669
these objects and then these are
 

00:34:24.669 --> 00:34:27.539
these objects and then these are
different cells that respond to these

00:34:27.539 --> 00:34:27.549
different cells that respond to these
 

00:34:27.549 --> 00:34:30.450
different cells that respond to these
objects and when the cell is responding

00:34:30.450 --> 00:34:30.460
objects and when the cell is responding
 

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:33.389
objects and when the cell is responding
to the object you know now the code that

00:34:33.389 --> 00:34:33.399
to the object you know now the code that
 

00:34:33.399 --> 00:34:36.419
to the object you know now the code that
when there is color there is activity so

00:34:36.419 --> 00:34:36.429
when there is color there is activity so
 

00:34:36.429 --> 00:34:39.659
when there is color there is activity so
then this cell is just a object papapapa

00:34:39.659 --> 00:34:39.669
then this cell is just a object papapapa
 

00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:47.250
then this cell is just a object papapapa
a object is an object then how many of

00:34:47.250 --> 00:34:47.260
a object is an object then how many of
 

00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:51.629
a object is an object then how many of
you remember this guy the time guy he is

00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:51.639
you remember this guy the time guy he is
 

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:56.730
you remember this guy the time guy he is
also the object guy so what he did was a

00:34:56.730 --> 00:34:56.740
also the object guy so what he did was a
 

00:34:56.740 --> 00:34:59.849
also the object guy so what he did was a
game to play so you know it's so

00:34:59.849 --> 00:34:59.859
game to play so you know it's so
 

00:34:59.859 --> 00:35:03.870
game to play so you know it's so
important when you have questions that

00:35:03.870 --> 00:35:03.880
important when you have questions that
 

00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:08.370
important when you have questions that
you really wonder how to address that

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:08.380
you really wonder how to address that
 

00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:13.079
you really wonder how to address that
you can play so we have people in our

00:35:13.079 --> 00:35:13.089
you can play so we have people in our
 

00:35:13.089 --> 00:35:16.110
you can play so we have people in our
lab playing trying out things and

00:35:16.110 --> 00:35:16.120
lab playing trying out things and
 

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.050
lab playing trying out things and
suddenly they see something that is so

00:35:19.050 --> 00:35:19.060
suddenly they see something that is so
 

00:35:19.060 --> 00:35:19.880
suddenly they see something that is so
exciting

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:19.890
exciting
 

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:24.030
exciting
so what Albert did was he was recording

00:35:24.030 --> 00:35:24.040
so what Albert did was he was recording
 

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:27.360
so what Albert did was he was recording
them in lateral internal cortex and he

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:27.370
them in lateral internal cortex and he
 

00:35:27.370 --> 00:35:29.400
them in lateral internal cortex and he
had this situation it was this box he

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:29.410
had this situation it was this box he
 

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:32.760
had this situation it was this box he
had to deplete our here and he had

00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:32.770
had to deplete our here and he had
 

00:35:32.770 --> 00:35:35.970
had to deplete our here and he had
trained a rat for 14 days and then he

00:35:35.970 --> 00:35:35.980
trained a rat for 14 days and then he
 

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.400
trained a rat for 14 days and then he
said I have found some of these cells

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:38.410
said I have found some of these cells
 

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:40.890
said I have found some of these cells
that in cream found that respond to the

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:40.900
that in cream found that respond to the
 

00:35:40.900 --> 00:35:44.580
that in cream found that respond to the
object but I want to see what happens if

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:44.590
object but I want to see what happens if
 

00:35:44.590 --> 00:35:49.050
object but I want to see what happens if
I remove the object so it is like you

00:35:49.050 --> 00:35:49.060
I remove the object so it is like you
 

00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.230
I remove the object so it is like you
sit in a pot and you wait for your best

00:35:52.230 --> 00:35:52.240
sit in a pot and you wait for your best
 

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.350
sit in a pot and you wait for your best
friend and your best friend's chair is

00:35:55.350 --> 00:35:55.360
friend and your best friend's chair is
 

00:35:55.360 --> 00:35:59.010
friend and your best friend's chair is
empty where is my best friend so that

00:35:59.010 --> 00:35:59.020
empty where is my best friend so that
 

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:02.370
empty where is my best friend so that
happened to the RuPt the rat was walking

00:36:02.370 --> 00:36:02.380
happened to the RuPt the rat was walking
 

00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.890
happened to the RuPt the rat was walking
here in the object it had been exposed

00:36:04.890 --> 00:36:04.900
here in the object it had been exposed
 

00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.850
here in the object it had been exposed
to this object for 14 days and this cell

00:36:08.850 --> 00:36:08.860
to this object for 14 days and this cell
 

00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:13.190
to this object for 14 days and this cell
said something is wrong

00:36:13.190 --> 00:36:13.200
 
 

00:36:13.200 --> 00:36:18.240
 
look it's firing even though there is no

00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:18.250
look it's firing even though there is no
 

00:36:18.250 --> 00:36:23.960
look it's firing even though there is no
object so we decided to call these cells

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:23.970
object so we decided to call these cells
 

00:36:23.970 --> 00:36:28.140
object so we decided to call these cells
tracers because they are the memories of

00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:28.150
tracers because they are the memories of
 

00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:31.500
tracers because they are the memories of
what was there before and then Albert

00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:31.510
what was there before and then Albert
 

00:36:31.510 --> 00:36:35.130
what was there before and then Albert
started to play so he moved the object

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:35.140
started to play so he moved the object
 

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:39.510
started to play so he moved the object
to a new position and you see that when

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520
to a new position and you see that when
 

00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:44.010
to a new position and you see that when
he was moving the trace was also exposed

00:36:44.010 --> 00:36:44.020
he was moving the trace was also exposed
 

00:36:44.020 --> 00:36:47.580
he was moving the trace was also exposed
so in this situation he had moved so

00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:47.590
so in this situation he had moved so
 

00:36:47.590 --> 00:36:51.210
so in this situation he had moved so
many objects and this cell responded to

00:36:51.210 --> 00:36:51.220
many objects and this cell responded to
 

00:36:51.220 --> 00:36:54.240
many objects and this cell responded to
all of these moved objects there's

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:54.250
all of these moved objects there's
 

00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:57.120
all of these moved objects there's
nothing there and even cleaned the box

00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:57.130
nothing there and even cleaned the box
 

00:36:57.130 --> 00:37:00.210
nothing there and even cleaned the box
with alcohol with soap there's nothing

00:37:00.210 --> 00:37:00.220
with alcohol with soap there's nothing
 

00:37:00.220 --> 00:37:03.030
with alcohol with soap there's nothing

memory for this place there was an
object I have a memory for this place

00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:06.790
object I have a memory for this place
 

00:37:06.790 --> 00:37:09.990

there was an object how much time now 10

00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000
there was an object how much time now 10
 

00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.370
there was an object how much time now 10
minutes thank you

00:37:11.370 --> 00:37:11.380
minutes thank you
 

00:37:11.380 --> 00:37:17.070
minutes thank you
then I will end with something that is

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:17.080
then I will end with something that is
 

00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:19.380
then I will end with something that is

when you think about your episodic

00:37:26.070 --> 00:37:26.080
when you think about your episodic
 

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:29.700
when you think about your episodic
memory and if you think about an odor

00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:29.710
memory and if you think about an odor
 

00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:34.140
memory and if you think about an odor
it's so easy to retrieve a memory can

00:37:34.140 --> 00:37:34.150
it's so easy to retrieve a memory can
 

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.270
it's so easy to retrieve a memory can
you think about her order that can give

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:36.280
you think about her order that can give
 

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.650
you think about her order that can give
you a memory that you haven't been

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.520
child he was sitting with his aunt and
he got the tea and he could dip the

00:38:02.520 --> 00:38:02.530
he got the tea and he could dip the
 

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.190
he got the tea and he could dip the
Madeleine cake into the tea and it was

00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200
Madeleine cake into the tea and it was
 

00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:07.740
Madeleine cake into the tea and it was
this lovely taste then when he was a

00:38:07.740 --> 00:38:07.750
this lovely taste then when he was a
 

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:10.859
this lovely taste then when he was a
grown-up he did the same and he was sent

00:38:10.859 --> 00:38:10.869
grown-up he did the same and he was sent
 

00:38:10.869 --> 00:38:20.160
grown-up he did the same and he was sent
back to his aunt we studied this in the

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:20.170
back to his aunt we studied this in the
 

00:38:20.170 --> 00:38:22.849
back to his aunt we studied this in the
lab how can you study this in the lab

00:38:22.849 --> 00:38:22.859
lab how can you study this in the lab
 

00:38:22.859 --> 00:38:26.880
lab how can you study this in the lab
can you think about a task you need an

00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:26.890
can you think about a task you need an
 

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:27.329
can you think about a task you need an
aunt

00:38:27.329 --> 00:38:27.339
aunt
 

00:38:27.339 --> 00:38:29.069
aunt
you need a Madeleine cake you need a cup

00:38:29.069 --> 00:38:29.079
you need a Madeleine cake you need a cup
 

00:38:29.079 --> 00:38:35.670
you need a Madeleine cake you need a cup
of tea at least we have odors in the lab

00:38:35.670 --> 00:38:35.680
of tea at least we have odors in the lab
 

00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:40.200
of tea at least we have odors in the lab
and we have the rat Emma and Amash is

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:40.210
and we have the rat Emma and Amash is
 

00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:43.349
and we have the rat Emma and Amash is
giving the task that when she is

00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359
giving the task that when she is
 

00:38:43.359 --> 00:38:47.309
giving the task that when she is
smelling chocolates she should go to

00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:47.319
smelling chocolates she should go to
 

00:38:47.319 --> 00:38:49.650
smelling chocolates she should go to
this corner and then she is getting a

00:38:49.650 --> 00:38:49.660
this corner and then she is getting a
 

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:53.849
this corner and then she is getting a
reward when she is smelling banana here

00:38:53.849 --> 00:38:53.859
reward when she is smelling banana here
 

00:38:53.859 --> 00:38:56.309
reward when she is smelling banana here
then she should go to this corner and

00:38:56.309 --> 00:38:56.319
then she should go to this corner and
 

00:38:56.319 --> 00:38:59.670
then she should go to this corner and
then she gets another reward do you

00:38:59.670 --> 00:38:59.680
then she gets another reward do you
 

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:01.230
then she gets another reward do you
think that I'm not gonna do this task

00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240
think that I'm not gonna do this task
 

00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.970
think that I'm not gonna do this task
it's quite complicated yeah

00:39:04.970 --> 00:39:04.980
it's quite complicated yeah
 

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:14.780
it's quite complicated yeah
should we see that was chocolate

00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:14.790
 
 

00:39:14.790 --> 00:39:22.710
 
chocolate Amana

00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720
 
 

00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:35.190
 
she's good chocolate no it doesn't help

00:39:35.190 --> 00:39:35.200
she's good chocolate no it doesn't help
 

00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.770
she's good chocolate no it doesn't help
to cheat and now she is she can't

00:39:40.770 --> 00:39:40.780
to cheat and now she is she can't
 

00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:41.690
to cheat and now she is she can't
concentrate

00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:41.700
concentrate

you know rats are like offs they give up

00:39:45.300 --> 00:39:45.310
you know rats are like offs they give up
 

00:39:45.310 --> 00:39:53.609
you know rats are like offs they give up
sometimes banana yeah and now she's back

00:39:53.609 --> 00:39:53.619
sometimes banana yeah and now she's back
 

00:39:53.619 --> 00:39:57.420
sometimes banana yeah and now she's back
on track and what this guided Kay

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:57.430
on track and what this guided Kay
 

00:39:57.430 --> 00:40:01.319
on track and what this guided Kay
Igarashi from Japan was to record

00:40:01.319 --> 00:40:01.329
Igarashi from Japan was to record
 

00:40:01.329 --> 00:40:05.089
Igarashi from Japan was to record
simultaneously from the hippocampus and

00:40:05.089 --> 00:40:05.099
simultaneously from the hippocampus and
 

00:40:05.099 --> 00:40:09.390
simultaneously from the hippocampus and
the lateral internal cortex when Emma

00:40:09.390 --> 00:40:09.400
the lateral internal cortex when Emma
 

00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:13.410
the lateral internal cortex when Emma
and her friends solved this task what

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:13.420
and her friends solved this task what
 

00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:16.440
and her friends solved this task what
was so exceptional with what he did was

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:16.450
was so exceptional with what he did was
 

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:20.609
was so exceptional with what he did was
that he was able to record from the self

00:40:20.609 --> 00:40:20.619
that he was able to record from the self
 

00:40:20.619 --> 00:40:24.059
that he was able to record from the self
when Emma started to learn this when she

00:40:24.059 --> 00:40:24.069
when Emma started to learn this when she
 

00:40:24.069 --> 00:40:26.730
when Emma started to learn this when she
was completely naive until she had

00:40:26.730 --> 00:40:26.740
was completely naive until she had
 

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:30.120
was completely naive until she had
learnt the task so he could follow the

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:30.130
learnt the task so he could follow the
 

00:40:30.130 --> 00:40:33.270
learnt the task so he could follow the
process in the brain when these two

00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280
process in the brain when these two
 

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.990
process in the brain when these two
positions were coded and the positions

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:37.000
positions were coded and the positions
 

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:41.880
positions were coded and the positions
were associated with the orders and this

00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:41.890
were associated with the orders and this
 

00:40:41.890 --> 00:40:45.870
were associated with the orders and this
is this is the last complicated slide I

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:45.880
is this is the last complicated slide I
 

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:47.400
is this is the last complicated slide I
will promise you and it's very

00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:47.410
will promise you and it's very
 

00:40:47.410 --> 00:40:51.660
will promise you and it's very
complicated but we will just go through

00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:51.670
complicated but we will just go through
 

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:57.020
complicated but we will just go through
it and then you get some idea so this is

00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:57.030
it and then you get some idea so this is
 

00:40:57.030 --> 00:40:59.609
it and then you get some idea so this is
recordings from the hippocampus and

00:40:59.609 --> 00:40:59.619
recordings from the hippocampus and
 

00:40:59.619 --> 00:41:01.559
recordings from the hippocampus and
these are recordings from the lateral

00:41:01.559 --> 00:41:01.569
these are recordings from the lateral
 

00:41:01.569 --> 00:41:07.319
these are recordings from the lateral
internal cortex each line here is one

00:41:07.319 --> 00:41:07.329
internal cortex each line here is one
 

00:41:07.329 --> 00:41:13.950
internal cortex each line here is one
cell here and another cell in lateral

00:41:13.950 --> 00:41:13.960
cell here and another cell in lateral
 

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:19.109
cell here and another cell in lateral
internal cortex here this first panels

00:41:19.109 --> 00:41:19.119
internal cortex here this first panels
 

00:41:19.119 --> 00:41:22.260
internal cortex here this first panels
that is when emma is naive she doesn't

00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:22.270
that is when emma is naive she doesn't
 

00:41:22.270 --> 00:41:27.150
that is when emma is naive she doesn't
know the task at all where she has had

00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.160
know the task at all where she has had
 

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.819
know the task at all where she has had
some trials and then this is when she is

00:41:29.819 --> 00:41:29.829
some trials and then this is when she is
 

00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:32.819
some trials and then this is when she is
more skilled and this is when she's very

00:41:32.819 --> 00:41:32.829
more skilled and this is when she's very
 

00:41:32.829 --> 00:41:36.859
more skilled and this is when she's very
very good doing just a few errors

00:41:36.859 --> 00:41:36.869
very good doing just a few errors
 

00:41:36.869 --> 00:41:39.920
very good doing just a few errors
and this is when she is doing errors

00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:39.930
and this is when she is doing errors
 

00:41:39.930 --> 00:41:43.319
and this is when she is doing errors
then you can see these colors that we

00:41:43.319 --> 00:41:43.329
then you can see these colors that we
 

00:41:43.329 --> 00:41:47.220
then you can see these colors that we
have here these colors are just the

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:47.230
have here these colors are just the
 

00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:50.849
have here these colors are just the
activity the poo poo poo poop of the

00:41:50.849 --> 00:41:50.859
activity the poo poo poo poop of the
 

00:41:50.859 --> 00:41:54.630
activity the poo poo poo poop of the
different cells some cells prefer the

00:41:54.630 --> 00:41:54.640
different cells some cells prefer the
 

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:58.710
different cells some cells prefer the
chocolate red and some cells prefer the

00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720
chocolate red and some cells prefer the
 

00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.220
chocolate red and some cells prefer the
purnama

00:41:59.220 --> 00:41:59.230
purnama
 

00:41:59.230 --> 00:42:04.559
purnama
and this is where Emma is smelling the

00:42:04.559 --> 00:42:04.569
and this is where Emma is smelling the
 

00:42:04.569 --> 00:42:07.530
and this is where Emma is smelling the
different odors what I want you to see

00:42:07.530 --> 00:42:07.540
different odors what I want you to see
 

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:11.640
different odors what I want you to see
here is that here the maps are quite

00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:11.650
here is that here the maps are quite
 

00:42:11.650 --> 00:42:15.150
here is that here the maps are quite
empty there's not so much colours but

00:42:15.150 --> 00:42:15.160
empty there's not so much colours but
 

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:18.240
empty there's not so much colours but
when the animal when emma is killed you

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:18.250
when the animal when emma is killed you
 

00:42:18.250 --> 00:42:21.180
when the animal when emma is killed you
see there's a lot of red activity and a

00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:21.190
see there's a lot of red activity and a
 

00:42:21.190 --> 00:42:25.099
see there's a lot of red activity and a
lot of green activity in both structures

00:42:25.099 --> 00:42:25.109
lot of green activity in both structures
 

00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:29.640
lot of green activity in both structures
so that means that in Emma's brain she

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:29.650
so that means that in Emma's brain she
 

00:42:29.650 --> 00:42:32.790
so that means that in Emma's brain she
has developed a map that is the

00:42:32.790 --> 00:42:32.800
has developed a map that is the
 

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:36.540
has developed a map that is the
combination of the odor and the place

00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:36.550
combination of the odor and the place
 

00:42:36.550 --> 00:42:40.079
combination of the odor and the place
and what happens when Emma is doing an

00:42:40.079 --> 00:42:40.089
and what happens when Emma is doing an
 

00:42:40.089 --> 00:42:44.940
and what happens when Emma is doing an
error her brain is empty have you ever

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:44.950
error her brain is empty have you ever
 

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:46.890
error her brain is empty have you ever
had this feeling that your brain is

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:46.900
had this feeling that your brain is
 

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:52.109
had this feeling that your brain is
empty that happens there's almost no

00:42:52.109 --> 00:42:52.119
empty that happens there's almost no
 

00:42:52.119 --> 00:42:56.309
empty that happens there's almost no
color no active cells telling Emma where

00:42:56.309 --> 00:42:56.319
color no active cells telling Emma where
 

00:42:56.319 --> 00:43:02.880
color no active cells telling Emma where
to go that's life so we think that we

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:02.890
to go that's life so we think that we
 

00:43:02.890 --> 00:43:07.200
to go that's life so we think that we
have now discovered cells in the brain

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:07.210
have now discovered cells in the brain
 

00:43:07.210 --> 00:43:10.579
have now discovered cells in the brain
that code for where something happens

00:43:10.579 --> 00:43:10.589
that code for where something happens
 

00:43:10.589 --> 00:43:13.650
that code for where something happens
when it happened and what happened and

00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:13.660
when it happened and what happened and
 

00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:16.349
when it happened and what happened and
then the hippocampus is fed this

00:43:16.349 --> 00:43:16.359
then the hippocampus is fed this
 

00:43:16.359 --> 00:43:18.210
then the hippocampus is fed this
information is receiving this

00:43:18.210 --> 00:43:18.220
information is receiving this
 

00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.089
information is receiving this
information so that the hippocampus can

00:43:21.089 --> 00:43:21.099
information so that the hippocampus can
 

00:43:21.099 --> 00:43:25.079
information so that the hippocampus can
generate our episodic memory there are

00:43:25.079 --> 00:43:25.089
generate our episodic memory there are
 

00:43:25.089 --> 00:43:30.540
generate our episodic memory there are
some people who can't do this and out is

00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:30.550
some people who can't do this and out is
 

00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:34.859
some people who can't do this and out is
those people who have a lesion a damage

00:43:34.859 --> 00:43:34.869
those people who have a lesion a damage
 

00:43:34.869 --> 00:43:38.609
those people who have a lesion a damage
when these cells are dead this happens

00:43:38.609 --> 00:43:38.619
when these cells are dead this happens
 

00:43:38.619 --> 00:43:40.730
when these cells are dead this happens
in some groups of Alzheimer's disease

00:43:40.730 --> 00:43:40.740
in some groups of Alzheimer's disease
 

00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:45.200
in some groups of Alzheimer's disease
patients in happens in also other people

00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:45.210
patients in happens in also other people
 

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:47.910
patients in happens in also other people
so they have problems to encode new

00:43:47.910 --> 00:43:47.920
so they have problems to encode new
 

00:43:47.920 --> 00:43:49.640
so they have problems to encode new
memories because these says

00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:49.650
memories because these says
 

00:43:49.650 --> 00:43:51.950
memories because these says
are dead they have problems with spatial

00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:51.960
are dead they have problems with spatial
 

00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:54.920
are dead they have problems with spatial
navigation they even have problems to

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:54.930

and I'm super excited this might be a

00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880
and I'm super excited this might be a
 

00:46:38.880 --> 00:46:41.240
and I'm super excited this might be a
bit of a controversial question but um I

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:41.250
bit of a controversial question but um I
 

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:43.670
bit of a controversial question but um I
assume most of the rats are made for

00:46:45.289 --> 00:46:45.299
like interference with hormones and so
 

00:46:45.299 --> 00:46:46.789

but you were talking about Emma and

00:46:46.789 --> 00:46:46.799
but you were talking about Emma and
 

00:46:46.799 --> 00:46:49.670
but you were talking about Emma and
since spatial awareness is kind of like

00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680
since spatial awareness is kind of like
 

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.190
since spatial awareness is kind of like
a gender issue there's people saying oh

00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200
a gender issue there's people saying oh
 

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:55.099
a gender issue there's people saying oh
you know women have less of a spatial

00:46:55.099 --> 00:46:55.109
you know women have less of a spatial
 

00:46:55.109 --> 00:46:56.839
you know women have less of a spatial
awareness and memory so I was wondering

00:46:56.839 --> 00:46:56.849
awareness and memory so I was wondering
 

00:46:56.849 --> 00:46:59.960
awareness and memory so I was wondering
if in in the lab you've put an Emma and

00:46:59.960 --> 00:46:59.970
if in in the lab you've put an Emma and
 

00:46:59.970 --> 00:47:03.049

Langston and when she started in lab she
said I'm only going to work with females

00:47:24.019 --> 00:47:24.029
said I'm only going to work with females
 

00:47:24.029 --> 00:47:27.230
said I'm only going to work with females
because I'm going to prove that females

00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240
because I'm going to prove that females
 

00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:30.380
because I'm going to prove that females
have great selves borders as head

00:47:30.380 --> 00:47:30.390

this new data in in this fantastic venue
so my question is regarding cahal so

00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319
so my question is regarding cahal so
 

00:48:10.319 --> 00:48:13.069
so my question is regarding cahal so
cahal identified the neuronal doctrine

00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079
cahal identified the neuronal doctrine
 

00:48:13.079 --> 00:48:16.640
cahal identified the neuronal doctrine
in which the self identity is the

00:48:16.640 --> 00:48:16.650
in which the self identity is the
 

00:48:16.650 --> 00:48:18.829
in which the self identity is the
building block of the brain so my

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839
building block of the brain so my
 

00:48:18.839 --> 00:48:23.029
building block of the brain so my
question is whether do you think that

00:48:23.029 --> 00:48:23.039
question is whether do you think that
 

00:48:23.039 --> 00:48:26.210
question is whether do you think that
the functional categories are related

00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:26.220
the functional categories are related
 

00:48:26.220 --> 00:48:31.789
the functional categories are related
with a cell type specificity what to say

00:48:31.789 --> 00:48:31.799
with a cell type specificity what to say
 

00:48:31.799 --> 00:48:36.470
with a cell type specificity what to say
if the functional grid cells or speech

00:48:36.470 --> 00:48:36.480
if the functional grid cells or speech
 

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.190

oh yeah how you get functions out of the

00:48:40.849 --> 00:48:40.859
oh yeah how you get functions out of the
 

00:48:40.859 --> 00:48:43.940
oh yeah how you get functions out of the
network whether they could be related

00:48:43.940 --> 00:48:43.950
network whether they could be related
 

00:48:43.950 --> 00:48:45.829
network whether they could be related
with cell type-specific

00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839
with cell type-specific
 

00:48:45.839 --> 00:48:47.809
with cell type-specific
of the internet thank you for asking

00:48:47.809 --> 00:48:47.819
of the internet thank you for asking
 

00:48:47.819 --> 00:48:50.329
of the internet thank you for asking
that question so so that was our dream

00:48:50.329 --> 00:48:50.339
that question so so that was our dream
 

00:48:50.339 --> 00:48:53.720
that question so so that was our dream
when we found order to discover the grid

00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:53.730
when we found order to discover the grid
 

00:48:53.730 --> 00:48:57.019
when we found order to discover the grid

if you did only Anatomy that would have
been fantastic but we haven't been able

00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:09.900
been fantastic but we haven't been able
 

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:13.400
been fantastic but we haven't been able
to do that so the only the closest we

00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:13.410
to do that so the only the closest we
 

00:49:13.410 --> 00:49:17.510
to do that so the only the closest we
have come is this data that I showed you

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:17.520
have come is this data that I showed you
 

00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:20.240
have come is this data that I showed you
from the Chinese couple in the lab where

00:49:56.070 --> 00:49:56.080
they were left alone on
 

00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:59.460
they were left alone on
we'd had inhibition that surrounded them

00:49:59.460 --> 00:49:59.470
we'd had inhibition that surrounded them
 

00:49:59.470 --> 00:50:02.340
we'd had inhibition that surrounded them
and another input and that is the head

00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:02.350
and another input and that is the head
 

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:06.030
and another input and that is the head
direction and what happened then was

00:50:06.030 --> 00:50:06.040
direction and what happened then was
 

00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.540
direction and what happened then was
that before the grid cells disappeared

00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:09.550
that before the grid cells disappeared
 

00:50:09.550 --> 00:50:13.130
that before the grid cells disappeared
some of them became head Direction cells

00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.140
some of them became head Direction cells
 

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:16.290
some of them became head Direction cells
so that is telling us something about

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:16.300
so that is telling us something about
 

00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:18.210
so that is telling us something about
this network and that is also why we

00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:18.220
this network and that is also why we
 

00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.700
this network and that is also why we
thought this was so interesting to see

00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:20.710
thought this was so interesting to see
 

00:50:20.710 --> 00:50:23.850
thought this was so interesting to see
that the inter neurons staying with

00:50:23.850 --> 00:50:23.860
that the inter neurons staying with
 

00:50:23.860 --> 00:50:27.500
that the inter neurons staying with
somatostatin they are not involved in

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:27.510
somatostatin they are not involved in
 

00:50:27.510 --> 00:50:29.790
somatostatin they are not involved in
generating the grid cells so we are

00:50:29.790 --> 00:50:29.800
generating the grid cells so we are
 

00:50:29.800 --> 00:50:32.460
generating the grid cells so we are
closer to this but what we also know is

00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:32.470
closer to this but what we also know is
 

00:50:32.470 --> 00:50:35.700
closer to this but what we also know is
that the cell itself are also bored

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:35.710
that the cell itself are also bored
 

00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:37.470
that the cell itself are also bored
ourselves and they could have other

00:50:37.470 --> 00:50:37.480
ourselves and they could have other
 

00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.540
ourselves and they could have other
different functions right it doesn't

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:39.550
different functions right it doesn't
 

00:50:39.550 --> 00:50:43.050
different functions right it doesn't
even it's not enough to just say still

00:50:43.050 --> 00:50:43.060
even it's not enough to just say still
 

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:46.020
even it's not enough to just say still
it sells the grid cells so it's still a

00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:46.030
it sells the grid cells so it's still a
 

00:50:46.030 --> 00:50:48.240
it sells the grid cells so it's still a
very puzzling question but highly

00:50:48.240 --> 00:50:48.250
very puzzling question but highly
 

00:50:48.250 --> 00:50:52.190
very puzzling question but highly
exciting so we have some interesting

00:50:52.190 --> 00:50:52.200
exciting so we have some interesting
 

00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:55.710
exciting so we have some interesting
ideas how to solve that and we have some

00:50:55.710 --> 00:50:55.720
ideas how to solve that and we have some
 

00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:58.470
ideas how to solve that and we have some
wonderful wonderful postdocs working in

what happens if the animal is flying
 

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:20.500
what happens if the animal is flying
even though it's not in outer space but

even though it's not in outer space but
 

00:52:20.510 --> 00:52:22.900
even though it's not in outer space but
even to fly it's a different information

00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:22.910
even to fly it's a different information
 

00:52:22.910 --> 00:52:25.870
even to fly it's a different information
to you and if you count your steps and

00:52:25.870 --> 00:52:25.880
to you and if you count your steps and

animal enough ski and he is studying
 

00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:36.400
animal enough ski and he is studying
bats and when the bats are flying he can

00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:36.410
bats and when the bats are flying he can
 

00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:39.220
bats and when the bats are flying he can
record from the hippocampus or from the

00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:39.230
record from the hippocampus or from the
 

00:52:39.230 --> 00:52:42.820
record from the hippocampus or from the
adrenal cortex and he has shown that the

00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:42.830
adrenal cortex and he has shown that the
 

00:52:42.830 --> 00:52:46.450

hippocampal play cell is now a sphere
 

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:50.560
hippocampal play cell is now a sphere
and then the question is and says he

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:50.570
and then the question is and says he
 

00:52:50.570 --> 00:52:52.990
and then the question is and says he
come from physics how could you predict

00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.000
come from physics how could you predict
 

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.930
come from physics how could you predict
the grid cell which should be a crystal

00:52:55.930 --> 00:52:55.940
the grid cell which should be a crystal
 

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.510
the grid cell which should be a crystal
should it be a perfect crystal could it

00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520
should it be a perfect crystal could it
 

00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:01.060
should it be a perfect crystal could it
be a squeezed crystal how would these

00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:01.070
be a squeezed crystal how would these
 

00:53:01.070 --> 00:53:03.520
be a squeezed crystal how would these
different fields be and he's still

00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:03.530
different fields be and he's still
 

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:05.500
different fields be and he's still
struggling with that because to get the

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:05.510
struggling with that because to get the
 

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:07.390
struggling with that because to get the
coverage enough when the bat is flying

00:53:07.390 --> 00:53:07.400
coverage enough when the bat is flying
 

00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:09.640
coverage enough when the bat is flying
that has been difficult but the rumour

00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:09.650
that has been difficult but the rumour
 

00:53:09.650 --> 00:53:14.590
that has been difficult but the rumour
tells us that there is one 3d grid cell

00:53:14.590 --> 00:53:14.600
tells us that there is one 3d grid cell
 

00:53:14.600 --> 00:53:17.230
tells us that there is one 3d grid cell
that looks like a crystal but we are

00:53:17.230 --> 00:53:17.240
that looks like a crystal but we are
 

00:53:17.240 --> 00:53:19.359
that looks like a crystal but we are
still waiting science need a lot of

00:53:19.359 --> 00:53:19.369
still waiting science need a lot of
 

00:53:19.369 --> 00:53:24.330
still waiting science need a lot of
people

00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:27.040
 
thank you so much for your speech it has

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:27.050
thank you so much for your speech it has
 

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:29.590
thank you so much for your speech it has
been really interesting so my question

00:53:29.590 --> 00:53:29.600
been really interesting so my question
 

00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:34.720
been really interesting so my question
was we don't see many female Nobel

00:53:34.720 --> 00:53:34.730
was we don't see many female Nobel
 

00:53:34.730 --> 00:53:38.140
was we don't see many female Nobel
Prizes so I would like to ask you in

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:38.150
Prizes so I would like to ask you in
 

00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:40.090
Prizes so I would like to ask you in
your personal experience have you ever

00:53:40.090 --> 00:53:40.100
your personal experience have you ever
 

00:53:40.100 --> 00:53:43.030
your personal experience have you ever
faced any kind of discrimination against

00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040
faced any kind of discrimination against
 

00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:47.410
faced any kind of discrimination against
you for being a woman that's a very

00:53:47.410 --> 00:53:47.420
you for being a woman that's a very
 

00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:50.410
you for being a woman that's a very
interesting question so you know this

00:53:50.410 --> 00:53:50.420
interesting question so you know this
 

00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:52.870
interesting question so you know this
little child that you saw a little girl

00:53:52.870 --> 00:53:52.880
little child that you saw a little girl
 

00:53:52.880 --> 00:53:55.810
little child that you saw a little girl
she had a bigger brother ten years older

00:53:55.810 --> 00:53:55.820
she had a bigger brother ten years older
 

00:53:55.820 --> 00:54:00.640
she had a bigger brother ten years older
and I wanted to be him because he was so

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:00.650
and I wanted to be him because he was so
 

00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:04.210
and I wanted to be him because he was so
tough so I never realized that I was

00:54:04.210 --> 00:54:04.220
tough so I never realized that I was
 

00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:06.730
tough so I never realized that I was
different from the boys I didn't think

00:54:06.730 --> 00:54:06.740
different from the boys I didn't think
 

00:54:06.740 --> 00:54:10.000
different from the boys I didn't think
about it but of course now I'm a

00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:10.010
about it but of course now I'm a
 

00:54:10.010 --> 00:54:15.070
about it but of course now I'm a
grown-up I'm soon an old woman and I

00:54:15.070 --> 00:54:15.080
grown-up I'm soon an old woman and I
 

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:21.760
grown-up I'm soon an old woman and I
have realized that the expectations that

00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:21.770
have realized that the expectations that
 

00:54:21.770 --> 00:54:26.410
have realized that the expectations that
you have towards a man and a woman it's

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:26.420
you have towards a man and a woman it's
 

00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:30.790
you have towards a man and a woman it's
not always equal and of course if you

00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800
not always equal and of course if you
 

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:37.570
not always equal and of course if you
want to grow curiosity and passion if

00:54:37.570 --> 00:54:37.580
want to grow curiosity and passion if
 

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:41.800
want to grow curiosity and passion if
you if you don't expect people to do

00:54:41.800 --> 00:54:41.810
you if you don't expect people to do
 

00:54:41.810 --> 00:54:45.250
you if you don't expect people to do
well then it's more difficult but for

00:54:45.250 --> 00:54:45.260
well then it's more difficult but for
 

00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:48.280
well then it's more difficult but for
some people it's whew I'm going to show

00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:48.290
some people it's whew I'm going to show
 

00:54:48.290 --> 00:54:53.260
some people it's whew I'm going to show
them so what I'm saying is that in

00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:53.270
them so what I'm saying is that in
 

00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:59.380
them so what I'm saying is that in
Norway we have been blessed with not so

00:54:59.380 --> 00:54:59.390
Norway we have been blessed with not so
 

00:54:59.390 --> 00:55:02.820
Norway we have been blessed with not so
much discrimination and not to myself

00:55:02.820 --> 00:55:02.830
much discrimination and not to myself
 

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:08.050
much discrimination and not to myself
but I am aware that we have some

00:55:08.050 --> 00:55:08.060
but I am aware that we have some
 

00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:11.590
but I am aware that we have some
challenges and what is important is that

00:55:11.590 --> 00:55:11.600
challenges and what is important is that
 

00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:16.150
challenges and what is important is that
we all love science and we need

00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160
we all love science and we need
 

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:20.650
we all love science and we need
diversity we need different cultures we

00:55:20.650 --> 00:55:20.660
diversity we need different cultures we
 

00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:25.480
diversity we need different cultures we
need men and women young and old and we

00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:25.490
need men and women young and old and we
 

00:55:25.490 --> 00:55:27.610
need men and women young and old and we
need to talk to each other to solve

00:55:27.610 --> 00:55:27.620
need to talk to each other to solve
 

00:55:27.620 --> 00:55:31.210
need to talk to each other to solve
these big questions and I think we will

00:55:31.210 --> 00:55:31.220
these big questions and I think we will
 

00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:48.910
these big questions and I think we will
do that if we work together

00:55:48.910 --> 00:55:48.920
 
 

00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:51.070

nice talk I'd like to ask okay we now
 

00:55:56.440 --> 00:56:00.070
nice talk I'd like to ask okay we now
know where the information that the

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:00.080
know where the information that the
 

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:05.230
know where the information that the
hippocampus is analyzing comes from but

00:56:05.230 --> 00:56:05.240
hippocampus is analyzing comes from but
 

00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.540
hippocampus is analyzing comes from but
where is information entering our

00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:07.550
where is information entering our
 

00:56:07.550 --> 00:56:10.140
where is information entering our
quarters coming from

00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:10.150
quarters coming from
 

00:56:10.150 --> 00:56:13.060
quarters coming from
that's a brilliant one so of course we

00:56:13.060 --> 00:56:13.070
that's a brilliant one so of course we
 

00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:19.360
that's a brilliant one so of course we
have students in our lab one protégée

00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:19.370
have students in our lab one protégée
 

00:56:19.370 --> 00:56:23.320

student and one a postdoc and a postdoc

00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:23.330
student and one a postdoc and a postdoc
 

00:56:23.330 --> 00:56:26.740
student and one a postdoc and a postdoc
from from Holland working on for example

00:56:26.740 --> 00:56:26.750
from from Holland working on for example
 

00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:28.870
from from Holland working on for example
a question where's the speed information

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:28.880
a question where's the speed information
 

00:56:28.880 --> 00:56:31.990
a question where's the speed information
coming from and it's not published yet

00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000
coming from and it's not published yet
 

00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:39.250
coming from and it's not published yet
but they have been tracing the brain

00:56:39.250 --> 00:56:39.260
but they have been tracing the brain
 

00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:43.690
but they have been tracing the brain
stem and diagonal band and it seems like

00:56:43.690 --> 00:56:43.700
stem and diagonal band and it seems like
 

00:56:43.700 --> 00:56:46.270
stem and diagonal band and it seems like
this loop is very important for the

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:46.280
this loop is very important for the
 

00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:48.750
this loop is very important for the
speed information then you have

00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:48.760
speed information then you have
 

00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:52.000
speed information then you have
information about the visual spatial

00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:52.010
information about the visual spatial
 

00:56:52.010 --> 00:56:54.400
information about the visual spatial
environments of parietal cortex is

00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:54.410
environments of parietal cortex is
 

00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:55.720
environments of parietal cortex is
extremely important

00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:55.730
extremely important
 

00:56:55.730 --> 00:56:58.030
extremely important
you have the poster on an important and

00:56:58.030 --> 00:56:58.040
you have the poster on an important and
 

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:00.190
you have the poster on an important and
then of course the hippocampus is

00:57:00.190 --> 00:57:00.200
then of course the hippocampus is
 

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.650
then of course the hippocampus is
sending information back to the

00:57:02.650 --> 00:57:02.660
sending information back to the
 

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:04.900
sending information back to the
entorhinal cortex telling them to run

00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:04.910
entorhinal cortex telling them to run
 

00:57:04.910 --> 00:57:07.000
entorhinal cortex telling them to run
the cortex some important things and and

00:57:07.000 --> 00:57:07.010
the cortex some important things and and
 

00:57:07.010 --> 00:57:09.910
the cortex some important things and and
so under there's older information to

00:57:09.910 --> 00:57:09.920
so under there's older information to
 

00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:12.310
so under there's older information to
the lateral entorhinal cortex and what

00:57:12.310 --> 00:57:12.320
the lateral entorhinal cortex and what
 

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:15.070
the lateral entorhinal cortex and what
is so special is that as I said this is

00:57:15.070 --> 00:57:15.080
is so special is that as I said this is
 

00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:18.220
is so special is that as I said this is
so far away from the direct sensory

00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:18.230
so far away from the direct sensory
 

00:57:18.230 --> 00:57:21.430
so far away from the direct sensory
organs so what we see in these

00:57:21.430 --> 00:57:21.440
organs so what we see in these
 

00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:24.400
organs so what we see in these
structures is what the brain is

00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:24.410
structures is what the brain is
 

00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:26.800
structures is what the brain is
generating from all this information

00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:26.810
generating from all this information
 

00:57:26.810 --> 00:57:29.590
generating from all this information
that it's receiving so that makes this

00:57:29.590 --> 00:57:29.600
that it's receiving so that makes this
 

00:57:29.600 --> 00:57:33.010
that it's receiving so that makes this
even more interesting because we go so

00:57:33.010 --> 00:57:33.020
even more interesting because we go so
 

00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:35.080
even more interesting because we go so
deep in the brain and we are trying to

00:57:35.080 --> 00:57:35.090
deep in the brain and we are trying to
 

00:57:35.090 --> 00:57:39.280
deep in the brain and we are trying to
understand how the brain is working how

00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:39.290
understand how the brain is working how
 

00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:45.010
understand how the brain is working how

00:57:53.170 --> 00:57:53.180
shown that younger people nowadays are
 

00:57:53.180 --> 00:57:56.620
shown that younger people nowadays are
less interested in in the STEM fields so

00:57:56.620 --> 00:57:56.630
less interested in in the STEM fields so
 

00:57:56.630 --> 00:58:00.070
less interested in in the STEM fields so
my question is what would you tell oh I

00:58:00.070 --> 00:58:00.080
my question is what would you tell oh I

how would you convince younger young

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:02.750
how would you convince younger young
 

00:58:02.750 --> 00:58:06.190
how would you convince younger young
people to to get into STEM fields and

00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200
people to to get into STEM fields and
 

00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:14.920
people to to get into STEM fields and
and to make science so I think that the

00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:14.930
and to make science so I think that the
 

00:58:14.930 --> 00:58:17.920
and to make science so I think that the
advice I have to both you the young ones

00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:17.930
advice I have to both you the young ones
 

00:58:17.930 --> 00:58:22.000
advice I have to both you the young ones
but also my generation is to give

00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:22.010
but also my generation is to give
 

00:58:22.010 --> 00:58:24.849
but also my generation is to give
opportunities for curious people to

00:58:24.849 --> 00:58:24.859
opportunities for curious people to
 

00:58:24.859 --> 00:58:28.540
opportunities for curious people to
follow their passion so if you have

00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:28.550
follow their passion so if you have
 

00:58:28.550 --> 00:58:32.079
follow their passion so if you have
passion for some questions that are

00:58:32.079 --> 00:58:32.089
passion for some questions that are
 

00:58:32.089 --> 00:58:36.520
passion for some questions that are
extremely important for you you can't

00:58:36.520 --> 00:58:36.530
extremely important for you you can't
 

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:41.530

stop it you just have to ask this

00:58:41.530 --> 00:58:41.540
stop it you just have to ask this
 

00:58:41.540 --> 00:58:43.960
stop it you just have to ask this
question and that is the question I got

00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:43.970
question and that is the question I got
 

00:58:43.970 --> 00:58:46.750
question and that is the question I got
when we got the Nobel Prize why why

00:58:46.750 --> 00:58:46.760
when we got the Nobel Prize why why
 

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:48.849

01:00:35.050 --> 01:00:37.800
chocolate or a banana it contract the
order and actually track it in a in a

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:37.810
order and actually track it in a in a
 

01:00:37.810 --> 01:00:40.020
order and actually track it in a in a
space gosh

01:00:40.020 --> 01:00:40.030
space gosh
 

01:00:40.030 --> 01:00:43.230
space gosh
the rat was looking right he has humans

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240
the rat was looking right he has humans
 

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:43.920
the rat was looking right he has humans
can't

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:43.930
can't
 

01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:48.480
can't
so I'm that's a question so are you

01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:48.490
so I'm that's a question so are you
 

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:52.530
so I'm that's a question so are you
asking about the vomeronasal organ or

01:00:52.530 --> 01:00:52.540
asking about the vomeronasal organ or
 

01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:55.200
asking about the vomeronasal organ or
asking about the experiment with Emma

01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:55.210
asking about the experiment with Emma
 

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:59.609
asking about the experiment with Emma
yeah okay with Emma so so you you have

01:00:59.609 --> 01:00:59.619
yeah okay with Emma so so you you have
 

01:00:59.619 --> 01:01:02.040
yeah okay with Emma so so you you have
to remember that she got the chocolate

01:01:02.040 --> 01:01:02.050
to remember that she got the chocolate
 

01:01:02.050 --> 01:01:05.099
to remember that she got the chocolate
and the banana order in the same place

01:01:05.099 --> 01:01:05.109
and the banana order in the same place
 

01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:09.720
and the banana order in the same place
so it was this central place and and

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:09.730
so it was this central place and and
 

01:01:09.730 --> 01:01:12.599
so it was this central place and and
both orders were there so in order for

01:01:12.599 --> 01:01:12.609
both orders were there so in order for
 

01:01:12.609 --> 01:01:16.590
both orders were there so in order for
her to know where she should go to write

01:01:16.590 --> 01:01:16.600
her to know where she should go to write
 

01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:20.609
her to know where she should go to write
or to left she had to make this

01:01:20.609 --> 01:01:20.619
or to left she had to make this
 

01:01:20.619 --> 01:01:25.680
or to left she had to make this
association between the order and the

01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:25.690
association between the order and the
 

01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:29.070
association between the order and the
position but but what is interesting in

01:01:29.070 --> 01:01:29.080
position but but what is interesting in
 

01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:32.400
position but but what is interesting in
your question is if you did this test

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:32.410
your question is if you did this test
 

01:01:32.410 --> 01:01:37.680
your question is if you did this test
with me maybe having not developed my

01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:37.690
with me maybe having not developed my
 

01:01:37.690 --> 01:01:40.890
with me maybe having not developed my
olfactory system as well as Emma could I

01:01:40.890 --> 01:01:40.900
olfactory system as well as Emma could I
 

01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:46.500
olfactory system as well as Emma could I
do the task I don't think so because but

01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:46.510
do the task I don't think so because but
 

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:50.700
do the task I don't think so because but
maybe so but what is important is that

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:50.710
maybe so but what is important is that
 

01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:52.680
maybe so but what is important is that
this is a redundant system so

01:01:52.680 --> 01:01:52.690
this is a redundant system so
 

01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:56.160
this is a redundant system so
is back to your question because into

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:56.170
is back to your question because into
 

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:58.950
is back to your question because into
the hippocampus you get all kinds of

01:01:58.950 --> 01:01:58.960
the hippocampus you get all kinds of
 

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.550
the hippocampus you get all kinds of
information so if you to generate for

01:02:02.550 --> 01:02:02.560
information so if you to generate for
 

01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.770
information so if you to generate for
example the grid cell under speed you

01:02:04.770 --> 01:02:04.780
example the grid cell under speed you
 

01:02:04.780 --> 01:02:06.960
example the grid cell under speed you
have the optical flow you have the

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:06.970
have the optical flow you have the
 

01:02:06.970 --> 01:02:10.079
have the optical flow you have the
number of steps you have also how fast

01:02:10.079 --> 01:02:10.089
number of steps you have also how fast
 

01:02:10.089 --> 01:02:12.510
number of steps you have also how fast
you move so if you remove the optical

01:02:12.510 --> 01:02:12.520
you move so if you remove the optical
 

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.270
you move so if you remove the optical
flow you can still count the number of

01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:15.280
flow you can still count the number of
 

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.250
flow you can still count the number of
steps and you know how fast you have

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:17.260
steps and you know how fast you have
 

01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:20.010
steps and you know how fast you have
gone so it is a very redundant system so

01:02:20.010 --> 01:02:20.020
gone so it is a very redundant system so
 

01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.640
gone so it is a very redundant system so
so you don't if you don't have the

01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:23.650
so you don't if you don't have the
 

01:02:23.650 --> 01:02:26.520
so you don't if you don't have the
ability to smell something you can still

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:26.530
ability to smell something you can still
 

01:02:26.530 --> 01:02:34.490
ability to smell something you can still
do very fine so that is my only response

01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500
do very fine so that is my only response
 

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.440
do very fine so that is my only response
normally you don't when you're in a room

01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:37.450
normally you don't when you're in a room
 

01:02:37.450 --> 01:02:39.030
normally you don't when you're in a room
normally you don't know where the north

01:02:39.030 --> 01:02:39.040
normally you don't know where the north
 

01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:42.750
normally you don't know where the north
real north is so for the grid map you

01:02:42.750 --> 01:02:42.760
real north is so for the grid map you
 

01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:45.180
real north is so for the grid map you
need to fix the north how do you fix it

01:02:45.180 --> 01:02:45.190
need to fix the north how do you fix it
 

01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:47.460
need to fix the north how do you fix it
or thank you for that question

01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:47.470
or thank you for that question
 

01:02:47.470 --> 01:02:50.400
or thank you for that question
it's a wonderful question so III talked

01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:50.410
it's a wonderful question so III talked
 

01:02:50.410 --> 01:02:52.680
it's a wonderful question so III talked
briefly about it when it came to time

01:02:52.680 --> 01:02:52.690
briefly about it when it came to time
 

01:02:52.690 --> 01:02:57.210
briefly about it when it came to time
the time is so subjective and it's the

01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:57.220
the time is so subjective and it's the
 

01:02:57.220 --> 01:03:00.329
the time is so subjective and it's the
same with the metric and the grid sets

01:03:00.329 --> 01:03:00.339
same with the metric and the grid sets
 

01:03:00.339 --> 01:03:03.059
same with the metric and the grid sets
so when I told you about these compasses

01:03:03.059 --> 01:03:03.069
so when I told you about these compasses
 

01:03:03.069 --> 01:03:06.630
so when I told you about these compasses
I I shouldn't call them compass because

01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640
I I shouldn't call them compass because
 

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:10.790
I I shouldn't call them compass because
it's not connected to the magnetic north

01:03:10.790 --> 01:03:10.800
it's not connected to the magnetic north
 

01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:17.099
it's not connected to the magnetic north
so it is a map that is generated in US

01:03:17.099 --> 01:03:17.109
so it is a map that is generated in US
 

01:03:17.109 --> 01:03:20.280
so it is a map that is generated in US
and in the animal so when when you come

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:20.290
and in the animal so when when you come
 

01:03:20.290 --> 01:03:23.400
and in the animal so when when you come
to a room for the first time these cells

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:23.410
to a room for the first time these cells
 

01:03:23.410 --> 01:03:28.470
to a room for the first time these cells
just decide this is north this is east

01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480
just decide this is north this is east
 

01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.650
just decide this is north this is east
and so on and if you don't go to a

01:03:31.650 --> 01:03:31.660
and so on and if you don't go to a
 

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:36.589
and so on and if you don't go to a
different room having the same magnetic

01:03:36.589 --> 01:03:36.599
different room having the same magnetic
 

01:03:36.599 --> 01:03:40.319
different room having the same magnetic
or different magnetic directions then

01:03:40.319 --> 01:03:40.329
or different magnetic directions then
 

01:03:40.329 --> 01:03:44.490
or different magnetic directions then
north only can be there for this head

01:03:44.490 --> 01:03:44.500
north only can be there for this head
 

01:03:44.500 --> 01:03:46.920
north only can be there for this head
Direction cells the same cell so it's

01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:46.930
Direction cells the same cell so it's
 

01:03:46.930 --> 01:03:50.880
Direction cells the same cell so it's
just it's a system to help us to

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:50.890
just it's a system to help us to
 

01:03:50.890 --> 01:03:54.480
just it's a system to help us to
organize life and those of you who know

01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:54.490
organize life and those of you who know
 

01:03:54.490 --> 01:03:58.050
organize life and those of you who know
a tiny bit of philosophy can't he said

01:03:58.050 --> 01:03:58.060
a tiny bit of philosophy can't he said
 

01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:01.950
a tiny bit of philosophy can't he said
you can't explore the word if you don't

01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:01.960
you can't explore the word if you don't
 

01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:03.380
you can't explore the word if you don't
have this faculty

01:04:03.380 --> 01:04:03.390
have this faculty
 

01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:06.320
have this faculty
before you start to explore so it's just

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:06.330
before you start to explore so it's just
 

01:04:06.330 --> 01:04:10.940
before you start to explore so it's just
a help for us to understand the world

01:04:10.940 --> 01:04:10.950
a help for us to understand the world
 

01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:17.510
a help for us to understand the world
the mission of the tiny girl hi and

01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520
the mission of the tiny girl hi and
 

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.670
the mission of the tiny girl hi and
thank you very much for your talk it was

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:19.680
thank you very much for your talk it was
 

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:20.480
thank you very much for your talk it was
incredible

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:20.490
incredible
 

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:23.000
incredible
and I would like to know if you talked

01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:23.010
and I would like to know if you talked
 

01:04:23.010 --> 01:04:25.250
and I would like to know if you talked
about the others and the relationship

01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:25.260
about the others and the relationship
 

01:04:25.260 --> 01:04:27.680
about the others and the relationship
with a memory and I want to know if the

01:04:27.680 --> 01:04:27.690
with a memory and I want to know if the
 

01:04:27.690 --> 01:04:31.970
with a memory and I want to know if the
sounds have the same effect the music or

01:04:31.970 --> 01:04:31.980
sounds have the same effect the music or
 

01:04:31.980 --> 01:04:33.890
sounds have the same effect the music or
something like that could have the same

01:04:33.890 --> 01:04:33.900
something like that could have the same
 

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:38.150
something like that could have the same
effect could be related to the memory so

01:04:38.150 --> 01:04:38.160
effect could be related to the memory so
 

01:04:38.160 --> 01:04:42.740
effect could be related to the memory so
absolutely and even in in patients with

01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:42.750
absolutely and even in in patients with
 

01:04:42.750 --> 01:04:45.860
absolutely and even in in patients with
memory problems some of their problems

01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:45.870
memory problems some of their problems
 

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:49.610
memory problems some of their problems
is to find a good retrieval cue and then

01:04:49.610 --> 01:04:49.620
is to find a good retrieval cue and then
 

01:04:49.620 --> 01:04:52.370
is to find a good retrieval cue and then
you see with with really severe

01:04:52.370 --> 01:04:52.380
you see with with really severe
 

01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:54.800
you see with with really severe
Alzheimer's disease that if you play

01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:54.810
Alzheimer's disease that if you play
 

01:04:54.810 --> 01:04:57.770
Alzheimer's disease that if you play
some music that I know it sees seems

01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:57.780
some music that I know it sees seems
 

01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:01.250
some music that I know it sees seems
like it can circumvent and tirana cortex

01:05:01.250 --> 01:05:01.260
like it can circumvent and tirana cortex
 

01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.290
like it can circumvent and tirana cortex
and hippocampus that is damaged and then

01:05:03.290 --> 01:05:03.300
and hippocampus that is damaged and then
 

01:05:03.300 --> 01:05:09.040
and hippocampus that is damaged and then
go to a storage out in the cortex so the

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:09.050
go to a storage out in the cortex so the
 

01:05:09.050 --> 01:05:12.320
go to a storage out in the cortex so the
challenge for a memory is interference

01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:12.330
challenge for a memory is interference
 

01:05:12.330 --> 01:05:15.230
challenge for a memory is interference
that you start to mix memories and also

01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240
that you start to mix memories and also
 

01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:18.680
that you start to mix memories and also
to find a retrieval cue and that is why

01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:18.690
to find a retrieval cue and that is why
 

01:05:18.690 --> 01:05:23.390
to find a retrieval cue and that is why
odors are so fantastic because so I was

01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400
odors are so fantastic because so I was
 

01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:27.980
odors are so fantastic because so I was
at one conference and then John Gurdon

01:05:27.980 --> 01:05:27.990
at one conference and then John Gurdon
 

01:05:27.990 --> 01:05:32.290
at one conference and then John Gurdon
told me about a museum in New York and

01:05:32.290 --> 01:05:32.300
told me about a museum in New York and
 

01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.850
told me about a museum in New York and
that's a Viking Museum and you know

01:05:34.850 --> 01:05:34.860
that's a Viking Museum and you know
 

01:05:34.860 --> 01:05:39.170
that's a Viking Museum and you know
Norwegians we are Vikings so he said at

01:05:39.170 --> 01:05:39.180
Norwegians we are Vikings so he said at
 

01:05:39.180 --> 01:05:41.930
Norwegians we are Vikings so he said at
this museum they had the Viking

01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:41.940
this museum they had the Viking
 

01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:48.980
this museum they had the Viking
exhibition and they smelt terribly these

01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:48.990
exhibition and they smelt terribly these
 

01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:52.640
exhibition and they smelt terribly these
Vikings and you could buy these terrible

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:52.650
Vikings and you could buy these terrible
 

01:05:52.650 --> 01:05:57.350
Vikings and you could buy these terrible
smells in the souvenir shop at Museum so

01:05:57.350 --> 01:05:57.360
smells in the souvenir shop at Museum so
 

01:05:57.360 --> 01:06:00.770
smells in the souvenir shop at Museum so
John he went there and he bought these

01:06:00.770 --> 01:06:00.780
John he went there and he bought these
 

01:06:00.780 --> 01:06:04.400
John he went there and he bought these
odors and he met people that hadn't been

01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:04.410
odors and he met people that hadn't been
 

01:06:04.410 --> 01:06:08.300
odors and he met people that hadn't been
to this museum for 20 years and he

01:06:08.300 --> 01:06:08.310
to this museum for 20 years and he
 

01:06:08.310 --> 01:06:09.950
to this museum for 20 years and he
exposed these people from different

01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960
exposed these people from different
 

01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:12.650
exposed these people from different
odors and then he asked what what do you

01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.660
odors and then he asked what what do you
 

01:06:12.660 --> 01:06:14.090
odors and then he asked what what do you
think about when you smell ism

01:06:14.090 --> 01:06:14.100
think about when you smell ism
 

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:17.890
think about when you smell ism
oh this is the York

01:06:17.890 --> 01:06:17.900
oh this is the York
 

01:06:17.900 --> 01:06:22.520
oh this is the York
you know odors are even pleasant odors

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:22.530
you know odors are even pleasant odors
 

01:06:22.530 --> 01:06:25.880
you know odors are even pleasant odors
are very very good retrieval cues so you

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:25.890
are very very good retrieval cues so you
 

01:06:25.890 --> 01:06:28.490
are very very good retrieval cues so you
just have to find out and that is also

01:06:28.490 --> 01:06:28.500
just have to find out and that is also
 

01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:31.010
just have to find out and that is also
useful when you have to to memorize

01:06:31.010 --> 01:06:31.020
useful when you have to to memorize
 

01:06:31.020 --> 01:06:34.430
useful when you have to to memorize
things that you just have to memorize

01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440
things that you just have to memorize
 

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:36.620
things that you just have to memorize
that you don't understand and then you

01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:36.630
that you don't understand and then you
 

01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:38.569
that you don't understand and then you
can use this old-fashioned technique

01:06:38.569 --> 01:06:38.579
can use this old-fashioned technique
 

01:06:38.579 --> 01:06:40.730
can use this old-fashioned technique
with the memory palace which is very

01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:40.740
with the memory palace which is very
 

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:44.599
with the memory palace which is very
useful then you use space as a retrieval

01:06:44.599 --> 01:06:44.609
useful then you use space as a retrieval
 

01:06:44.609 --> 01:06:47.720
useful then you use space as a retrieval
cue so you go from room to room and then

01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:47.730
cue so you go from room to room and then
 

01:06:47.730 --> 01:06:50.750
cue so you go from room to room and then
pick up your memories when you mentally

01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760
pick up your memories when you mentally
 

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:54.800
pick up your memories when you mentally
travel from room to room we have time

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:54.810
travel from room to room we have time
 

01:06:54.810 --> 01:06:57.680
travel from room to room we have time
for only two questions there was one

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:57.690
for only two questions there was one
 

01:06:57.690 --> 01:07:02.750
for only two questions there was one
question over there so I think that I

01:07:02.750 --> 01:07:02.760
question over there so I think that I
 

01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:05.240
question over there so I think that I
understood that many of the graphics

01:07:05.240 --> 01:07:05.250
understood that many of the graphics
 

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:08.390
understood that many of the graphics
that you showed us we're representing

01:07:08.390 --> 01:07:08.400
that you showed us we're representing
 

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.240
that you showed us we're representing
the activity of just one neuron and I

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:11.250
the activity of just one neuron and I
 

01:07:11.250 --> 01:07:12.920
the activity of just one neuron and I
was just really curious if you could

01:07:12.920 --> 01:07:12.930
was just really curious if you could
 

01:07:12.930 --> 01:07:15.319
was just really curious if you could
tell us how the sentence sensors work

01:07:15.319 --> 01:07:15.329
tell us how the sentence sensors work
 

01:07:15.329 --> 01:07:20.060
tell us how the sentence sensors work
and are showing just the response of one

01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:20.070
and are showing just the response of one
 

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:22.760
and are showing just the response of one
neuron oh yeah thank you for that

01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:22.770
neuron oh yeah thank you for that
 

01:07:22.770 --> 01:07:28.059
neuron oh yeah thank you for that
question so what we do is that we have

01:07:28.059 --> 01:07:28.069
question so what we do is that we have
 

01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:31.970
question so what we do is that we have
ultra thin electrodes so it's a quarter

01:07:31.970 --> 01:07:31.980
ultra thin electrodes so it's a quarter
 

01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:35.630
ultra thin electrodes so it's a quarter
over here that is one then we twist four

01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640
over here that is one then we twist four
 

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:39.349
over here that is one then we twist four
of them together and we cut them with a

01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359
of them together and we cut them with a
 

01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:43.040
of them together and we cut them with a
golden sister so that these four are so

01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:43.050
golden sister so that these four are so
 

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:49.069
golden sister so that these four are so
close like this then we put the animal

01:07:49.069 --> 01:07:49.079
close like this then we put the animal
 

01:07:49.079 --> 01:07:52.700
close like this then we put the animal
down with morphine and I suffer rain and

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:52.710
down with morphine and I suffer rain and
 

01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:55.790
down with morphine and I suffer rain and
we open a tiny bit in the skull and then

01:07:55.790 --> 01:07:55.800
we open a tiny bit in the skull and then
 

01:07:55.800 --> 01:08:00.109
we open a tiny bit in the skull and then
we can insert this here thin electrodes

01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119
we can insert this here thin electrodes
 

01:08:00.119 --> 01:08:04.250
we can insert this here thin electrodes
into the brain close to where we want to

01:08:04.250 --> 01:08:04.260
into the brain close to where we want to
 

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:07.460
into the brain close to where we want to
go but then when the animal is awake and

01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:07.470
go but then when the animal is awake and
 

01:08:07.470 --> 01:08:11.599
go but then when the animal is awake and
happy running around we can turn these

01:08:11.599 --> 01:08:11.609
happy running around we can turn these
 

01:08:11.609 --> 01:08:15.260
happy running around we can turn these
electrodes down without an animal can

01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:15.270
electrodes down without an animal can
 

01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:18.160
electrodes down without an animal can
feel anything and then we can listen and

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:18.170
feel anything and then we can listen and
 

01:08:18.170 --> 01:08:22.249
feel anything and then we can listen and
we can test the animal and then finally

01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259
we can test the animal and then finally
 

01:08:22.259 --> 01:08:25.340
we can test the animal and then finally
we hear a response papapapa because we

01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:25.350
we hear a response papapapa because we
 

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:27.709
we hear a response papapapa because we
have a camera above the animal when

01:08:27.709 --> 01:08:27.719
have a camera above the animal when
 

01:08:27.719 --> 01:08:29.289
have a camera above the animal when
animal is running so we can

01:08:29.289 --> 01:08:29.299
animal is running so we can
 

01:08:29.299 --> 01:08:31.539
animal is running so we can
tract behavior and we can track the

01:08:31.539 --> 01:08:31.549
tract behavior and we can track the
 

01:08:31.549 --> 01:08:34.720
tract behavior and we can track the
signals and what we do is just to

01:08:34.720 --> 01:08:34.730
signals and what we do is just to
 

01:08:34.730 --> 01:08:39.660
signals and what we do is just to
correlate two and two electrodes and ask

01:08:39.660 --> 01:08:39.670
correlate two and two electrodes and ask
 

01:08:39.670 --> 01:08:42.669
correlate two and two electrodes and ask
how does the cell look like on this so

01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679
how does the cell look like on this so
 

01:08:42.679 --> 01:08:46.089
how does the cell look like on this so
this is extracellular recordings and in

01:08:46.089 --> 01:08:46.099
this is extracellular recordings and in
 

01:08:46.099 --> 01:08:49.200
this is extracellular recordings and in
this way we have these clouds of

01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:49.210
this way we have these clouds of
 

01:08:49.210 --> 01:08:53.109
this way we have these clouds of
activity that are separated because

01:08:53.109 --> 01:08:53.119
activity that are separated because
 

01:08:53.119 --> 01:08:56.140
activity that are separated because
there is a distance between the

01:08:56.140 --> 01:08:56.150
there is a distance between the
 

01:08:56.150 --> 01:08:59.189
there is a distance between the
electrode and the different cells and

01:08:59.189 --> 01:08:59.199
electrode and the different cells and
 

01:08:59.199 --> 01:09:02.589
electrode and the different cells and
this way you can follow these clouds for

01:09:02.589 --> 01:09:02.599
this way you can follow these clouds for
 

01:09:02.599 --> 01:09:07.240
this way you can follow these clouds for
days and weeks and even I followed some

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:07.250
days and weeks and even I followed some
 

01:09:07.250 --> 01:09:11.140
days and weeks and even I followed some
of my cells for half-year and that's

01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:11.150
of my cells for half-year and that's
 

01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:13.780
of my cells for half-year and that's
possible because you know the signature

01:09:13.780 --> 01:09:13.790
possible because you know the signature
 

01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:17.649
possible because you know the signature
for each cell and you magnify these

01:09:17.649 --> 01:09:17.659
for each cell and you magnify these
 

01:09:17.659 --> 01:09:22.019
for each cell and you magnify these
small electrical potentials 10,000 times

01:09:22.019 --> 01:09:22.029
small electrical potentials 10,000 times
 

01:09:22.029 --> 01:09:25.120
small electrical potentials 10,000 times
so that you can see it on a similar

01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:25.130
so that you can see it on a similar
 

01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:28.809
so that you can see it on a similar
scope and you can listen so we've time

01:09:28.809 --> 01:09:28.819
scope and you can listen so we've time
 

01:09:28.819 --> 01:09:30.910
scope and you can listen so we've time
for one last question at the back there

01:09:30.910 --> 01:09:30.920
for one last question at the back there
 

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.640
for one last question at the back there
I thank you for your talk I was

01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:33.650
I thank you for your talk I was
 

01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:36.959
I thank you for your talk I was
wondering about the encoding process

01:09:36.959 --> 01:09:36.969
wondering about the encoding process
 

01:09:36.969 --> 01:09:40.390
wondering about the encoding process
when you study those animals and you

01:09:40.390 --> 01:09:40.400
when you study those animals and you
 

01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:44.309
when you study those animals and you
study these grid cells and play cells

01:09:44.309 --> 01:09:44.319
study these grid cells and play cells
 

01:09:44.319 --> 01:09:47.740
study these grid cells and play cells
about the molecular process of how do

01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:47.750
about the molecular process of how do
 

01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.919
about the molecular process of how do
they encode if you have performed some

01:09:50.919 --> 01:09:50.929
they encode if you have performed some
 

01:09:50.929 --> 01:09:54.459
they encode if you have performed some
experiments for example I think about

01:09:54.459 --> 01:09:54.469
experiments for example I think about
 

01:09:54.469 --> 01:09:56.890
experiments for example I think about
the cinah Jocelyn's papers about the

01:09:56.890 --> 01:09:56.900
the cinah Jocelyn's papers about the
 

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:59.649
the cinah Jocelyn's papers about the
internal cortex and how do they increase

01:09:59.649 --> 01:09:59.659
internal cortex and how do they increase
 

01:09:59.659 --> 01:10:03.640
internal cortex and how do they increase
CREB levels on those cells and they see

01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:03.650
CREB levels on those cells and they see
 

01:10:03.650 --> 01:10:06.100
CREB levels on those cells and they see
that they are more prone to encode this

01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:06.110
that they are more prone to encode this
 

01:10:06.110 --> 01:10:08.979
that they are more prone to encode this
this new information if you have to

01:10:08.979 --> 01:10:08.989
this new information if you have to
 

01:10:08.989 --> 01:10:11.470
this new information if you have to
think about this process could be

01:10:11.470 --> 01:10:11.480
think about this process could be
 

01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.479
think about this process could be
happening at your model because they

01:10:13.479 --> 01:10:13.489
happening at your model because they
 

01:10:13.489 --> 01:10:16.660
happening at your model because they
study context or fear memories but this

01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:16.670
study context or fear memories but this
 

01:10:16.670 --> 01:10:18.819
study context or fear memories but this
is another kind of memory but is very

01:10:18.819 --> 01:10:18.829
is another kind of memory but is very
 

01:10:18.829 --> 01:10:23.859
is another kind of memory but is very
related and also how the neurogenesis

01:10:23.859 --> 01:10:23.869
related and also how the neurogenesis
 

01:10:23.869 --> 01:10:27.970
related and also how the neurogenesis
could also interfere in the throat the

01:10:27.970 --> 01:10:27.980
could also interfere in the throat the
 

01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:30.910
could also interfere in the throat the
time the forgetting those memories that

01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:30.920
time the forgetting those memories that
 

01:10:30.920 --> 01:10:34.660
time the forgetting those memories that
you're studying hmm thank you for that

01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:34.670
you're studying hmm thank you for that
 

01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:38.379
you're studying hmm thank you for that
question so I can't answer you so much

01:10:38.379 --> 01:10:38.389
question so I can't answer you so much
 

01:10:38.389 --> 01:10:42.180
question so I can't answer you so much
because we have a postdoc in the lab

01:10:42.180 --> 01:10:42.190
because we have a postdoc in the lab
 

01:10:42.190 --> 01:10:44.580
because we have a postdoc in the lab
who is applying for a European Research

who is applying for a European Research
Council grant he's the most fantastic

01:10:48.510 --> 01:10:48.520
Council grant he's the most fantastic
 

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:52.620
Council grant he's the most fantastic
postdoc from Italy and as I can't tell
