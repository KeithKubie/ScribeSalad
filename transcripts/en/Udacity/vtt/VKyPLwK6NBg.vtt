Hey, Jeremy.

00:00:02.123 --> 00:00:06.360
What are you working on?

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.200
&gt;&gt; Just developing.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.040
&gt;&gt; Really?

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.400
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's actually going super well.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.492
Thanks for all the help with Gradle.

00:00:14.492 --> 00:00:15.150
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.640
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's really helped
me keep my bill organized.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.980
&gt;&gt; Well, I'm glad to help.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.300
&gt;&gt; You know what?
I think I'm actually finished.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.294
Well, nice work.

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:28.775
&gt;&gt; Yeah, my plans for
world domination are complete.

00:00:28.775 --> 00:00:30.728
Thanks, Mark.

00:00:30.728 --> 00:00:35.130
Oh hey, do me a favor though,
will you meet me at the radio tower and

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.720
bring along some chicken wire,
a frying pan, and two AA batteries?

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.646
&gt;&gt; Sure.
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:41.343
Thanks, Mark.

00:00:41.343 --> 00:00:42.560
You're the best.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.060
&gt;&gt; Sure.
Wait, what?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.640
Well, I hope you learned
something in this course.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.570
Familiarity with Gradle
will serve you well,

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.600
no matter where your
development journey takes you.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.620
Testing and build automation
make even the largest projects

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.980
easy to create and deploy.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.967
This is Mark from Gradle, signing off.

00:01:00.802 --> 00:01:03.720
Jeremy, what'd you mean
by world domination?

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.541
What did you build?
