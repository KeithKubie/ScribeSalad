00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.640
Responsive design goes a long way in making the website usable.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.950
Let's take a look at Gizmodo which has a pretty awesome responsive design.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:09.150
Let's see what happens as we change the size of the screen.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.210
Let's make it smaller and smaller.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:11.990
Oh. And there we go.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.379
Now the ad disappears on the left and we have the stories expand downward.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.450
Keep going.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:18.090
And look at that.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.330
The stories on the left side of the screen disappeared and

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.750
we're just left with the list.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.130
This would be great on tablet, this is perfect for tablet.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.950
Let's make it even smaller, and now we've got our mobile view.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:30.310
You can see that it's nicely laid out to fit within a nice thin screen.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.080
This is an awesome example of responsive design because it changes to

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.060
fit the size window that it's got.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:37.390
The way this is accomplished is with media queries.

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.170
Gizmodo used media queries to change the CSS of their page as

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.670
the screen got re-sized.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.770
Using media queries, you can change your page's CSS depending on what type of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.120
device somebody's using, whether it's a mobile screen or it's a desktop screen,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.280
how big it is, its height and width, or even the color of screens, go figure.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.760
Let's take a look at a media query.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.730
Inside the site's CSS file, I've added this media query.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.280
We know it's a media query because it starts with @media.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.990
We start off every media query with @media.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.420
Then we have the keyword "only", which is going to help us with older browsers.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.080
Then we have this keyword, screen.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.260
This media type here, screen, is telling us that this media query applies to any

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:19.090
kind of screen, whether that's the tablet that I've got here, your desktop

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.950
computer, your laptop computer, or your phone, they're all kinds of screens.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.520
You might see print here.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.420
It's fairly common for websites to style themselves differently if they know

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.050
that somebody's going to print something out.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.010
Then we have the logical operator and a condition within parenthesis.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:37.220
In this case, our condition is max-width 300 pixels which is telling us that

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.050
this media query should apply only if the width of

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.070
the screen is smaller than 300 pixels.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.570
If these two conditions match,

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.930
when the web page opens, we apply these styles which in this case is

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.860
the changing the background color of all the paragraph tags to blue.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.690
So if we open our website and resize the screen to make it smaller than

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.790
300 pixels, we should see a blue background behind all of our paragraphs.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.200
Let's see if it worked.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.150
I will save it and open up Chrome and let me refresh the page just to make sure.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.229
This is a little different than what we had before.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.720
I've simplified it quite a bit.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.980
We only have one paragraph and it's right here.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.350
Let's make the screen smaller.

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.900
I'll grab right here and shrink it, shrink it, shrink it, shrink it.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.500
And there we go, we hit the media query and the background turned blue.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.470
For this quiz, I want you to experiment a little bit.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.650
Which of these media queries will make paragraphs disappear when

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.050
screens are smaller than 500 pixels?

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.040
In the Instructor notes,

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.480
you'll find a sample HTML file, which should look pretty familiar.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.470
Try adding these styles to main.css and see what happens.
