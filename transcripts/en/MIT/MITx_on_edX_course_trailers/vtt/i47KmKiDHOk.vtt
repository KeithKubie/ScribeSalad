00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.190
CASPAR HARE: Is there a God?

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.450
You may well have an answer
to that question.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.260
Most people have an answer
to that question.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.330
This is a matter of religion.

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.680
Now ask yourself do you
know you're right?

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.172
Could you persuade a reasonable
person that you're right?

00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:22.690
To answer these questions, we need an
understanding of what it is to know

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:27.870
something, and of when it is reasonable
to believe something.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.400
And then we are doing philosophy.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.400
My name Caspar Hare, and I teach
introductory philosophy here at MIT.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.280
In this course we'll cover several
big topics in philosophy.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.890
We begin with knowledge and God,
as I alluded to earlier.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.880
We'll then move to talking
about consciousness.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:50.910
Some things are conscious.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.580
Some things aren't.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.580
You're watching this on a
machine of some kind.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.010
I don't exactly know what.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:56.450
It isn't conscious.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.690
You are conscious.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.800
What's the difference between a thing
that's conscious, like you, and a

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.660
thing that isn't, like your machine?

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.320
We'll then move to talking
about free will.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.410
Some things have free will.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.134
You have free will, or at
least you think you do.

00:01:11.134 --> 00:01:16.120
But how exactly can you have free will,
given that the matter in your

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.030
body is pushed around by the immutable
iron laws of physics?

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:25.970
And finally, we'll talk
about identity.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.170
What sort of a thing are you?

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.660
What is the basis of your
identity over time?

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.410
These questions have been discussed in
some form or other for thousands of

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.150
years by many great thinkers.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.930
We will read some of the great thinkers
in this course and try to

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.830
draw from them.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.290
Our aim is not to celebrate and
appreciate and applaud these thinkers,

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.970
but to use the insights
that they give us.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.300
The activity here is active
and not passive.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.130
This is the MIT way of
doing philosophy.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.100
Thousands of students here at MIT have
taken the course, although it's

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.560
available here online
for the first time.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.030
STUDENT 1: So probably the three words
that I would use to describe this

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.389
course to a friend is
really stimulating.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:12.830
It's really deep, because we cover
a lot of really important issues.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.050
And also, it's quite comprehensive,
because we cover a lot of really

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.170
fundamental topics in philosophy.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.330
STUDENT 2: You go to class and you
listen to the lecture, and it's not

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.860
even a lecture where you take notes.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.210
It's a lecture where you become engaged
in the material and engaged in

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.530
what he's teaching, because
it matters to you.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.370
STUDENT 1: One of the main reasons why
should take this course is because you

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.610
get to have a debate on these issues
that are really fun to talk about.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.380
STUDENT 2: Professor Hare
is just amazing.

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.370
He really is.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.750
And you always hear, oh, the
professor makes the class.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.300
And this is absolutely true of 24.00.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.890
CASPAR HARE: I hope that this course
will help you to become a better

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.730
thinker, more accurate, more
disciplined, and more creative.
