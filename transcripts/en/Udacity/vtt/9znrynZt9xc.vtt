00:00:00.008 --> 00:00:01.800
Welcome back.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.830
&gt;&gt; So, Nosmo, what happened to your neck?

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.365
&gt;&gt; Oh, I hurt it. I actually have slightly limited range of motion

00:00:07.365 --> 00:00:09.356
and so I can only move this way, kind of like a robot.

00:00:09.356 --> 00:00:09.740
&gt;&gt; Oh, no.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.240
&gt;&gt; Kind of like an alive Android.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.350
&gt;&gt; Sounds like you have a constraint.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.380
&gt;&gt; I know, it, it is a constraint, but instead of

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.980
fighting against it, I'm going to totally embrace it and work with

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.370
it. Well actually this lesson is all about how to work within

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.480
constraints and deliver great user experiences.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.160
So you're actually right at home.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.480
&gt;&gt; I know. That's awesome. Let's get started. So in lesson

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.150
two we taught you some tools called personas in use cases that

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.800
allow you to better prioritize your future lists and make really

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.730
good applications. And you also learned a little bit about UX research.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.795
&gt;&gt; And in lesson one, we taught you about hi, low-res

00:00:40.795 --> 00:00:44.210
wire framing. Which helps you think about the big picture first, before

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.480
you go into things like flows and details and UI elements.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.660
So, Nosmo, let's talk about what you're going to learn in lesson three.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.160
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.190
&gt;&gt; In this lesson you'll learn how to design for

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.580
the Mobile user. And how this is different from designing for

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.330
a web or a desktop user. You'll also learn about

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:02.900
four mobile constraints that you'll need to keep in mind for

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.260
any mobile apps that you'll build. Then you'll learn more

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.780
about wire framing and picking up from where we left off

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.980
in lesson one. We're going to go deeper into how to design

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.940
a flow of screens to support each step inside your application.
