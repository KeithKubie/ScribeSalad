00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.403
- [Instructor] In this video,

00:00:01.403 --> 00:00:02.290
we're going to dig a little bit

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:07.060
into the idea of what it
means to be a monopoly,

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.960
and so to help us appreciate that,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.700
let's think about the spectrum
on which firms can be.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.960
So this is going to be my
spectrum right over here.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.130
Now at the left end,

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.390
we can imagine this idealized
perfect competition,

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.773
perfect competition,

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.450
and we've talked about
that in the other videos,

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.600
but just as a review, this
is where you have many firms.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.080
This is where they are selling
an undifferentiated product

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.360
or service,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.723
undifferentiated,
undifferentiated product.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.150
The firms over here,

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.450
well, they have no
barriers to entry or exit,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.900
so no barriers

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.620
to entry

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.810
or exit.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.970
These firms that we've
talked about in other videos,

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.510
they need to be price takers.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.660
Why do they need to be price takers?

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.650
Well, whatever the market price is,

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.980
since no one cares which of these firms,

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.110
which of these many firms
they get the product from,

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.790
none of those firms can
really set their own price.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:09.570
If they were to go above the market price,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.050
well then no one will buy from them,

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.293
and so they will just
be price, price takers,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.240
and other things that we assume
about perfect competition is

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.690
that all of the actors in
the market, both the buyers,

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.470
the many buyers and the many sellers,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.310
they all know what the
transactions are going on for.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.110
They know who's selling
to whom for what amount.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.160
Now the other extreme,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.827
this is where we have
the monopoly, monopoly.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.950
Here, instead of many firms
selling or many firms producing,

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:47.490
you have exactly one firm producing.

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.200
Instead of an undifferentiated product,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.610
well, it's differentiated
because it's the only firm.

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.640
Instead of no barriers to entry or exit,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.110
here we have the exact opposite,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.820
so you could say insurmountable,
insurmountable, mountable,

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.760
I'll just abbreviate it,
barriers, especially to enter,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.690
and instead of being a price
taker, you are a price setter,

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.000
price setter.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.150
You're the only player.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.260
You're the only actor
who is selling anything,

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.040
So you can decide what
price to sell it at.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.040
Now, perfect competition
as I talked about,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.440
it's a bit of a theoretical idea.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.910
It's hard to say any market
that is absolutely perfect,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.120
but we can imagine markets
that are on this spectrum,

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.910
some closer to perfect competition,

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:33.020
some closer to a monopoly.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.760
Things that I can imagine that are closer

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.740
to perfect competition
might be, let's say,

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.110
agriculture or a certain
type of agriculture.

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.220
Let's say you are buying
pistachios, and you might be,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.310
most people are indifferent

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.790
as to where their pistachios come from,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.210
although some people might beg to differ

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.680
that certain types of pistachios
are better than others,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.590
but for the most part,

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.920
that'd be closer to perfect competition.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:57.060
There will be just a price
in the market for pistachios.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.040
If someone wants to grow pistachios,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.520
I'm not familiar with what
it takes to grow pistachios,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:03.300
and I apologize to any offense

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.010
to any pistachio growers out there,

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.010
but maybe they can just get enough land,

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.190
and there's very close
to low barriers to entry,

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.370
and they can start producing pistachios.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.670
As I mentioned, many would
perceive it as undifferentiated,

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.000
and there might be many firms
in, say, the pistachio market.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.370
I actually don't know if that's the case,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.350
but let's just assume

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.760
if that were the case it would be closer

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.360
to a perfect competition.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.330
Now a monopoly, you can
imagine things like things

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.010
that take a lot of infrastructure

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.350
in order to do that service.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.020
So I can imagine things like,
over here, close to monopoly

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.920
or at monopoly.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.870
You can imagine things like
utilities providers, utilities,

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.840
where it's hard for multiple
people to run power lines

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.810
to the various houses.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.500
You can imagine things like this.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.210
Telecom, telecom providers might be close,

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.620
although in most geographies,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.390
you have more than one telecom providers,

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.520
although in some parts of the world,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.510
you're getting pretty close
to one because, once again,

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.630
there's very, very, very
high barriers to entry

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.463
in either one of those.

00:04:04.463 --> 00:04:08.810
You gotta launch satellites
and put cable under the ground

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.000
and dig up roads and
whatever until you get closer

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.650
and closer to this notion
of maybe there's one firm.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:16.910
If you're in a situation
like telecom in a lot

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.680
of the places where you have
only a handful of firms,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.650
that's known as an oligopoly,

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.640
but let's just think about the extreme,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:26.140
when you're in a monopoly situation,

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.410
and so the next few videos,

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:28.690
we're gonna dive a little bit deeper

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.710
into what it means to be a monopoly,

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.020
and what is the rational quantity

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.670
for a profit-maximizing monopolistic firm

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.140
to actually produce,

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.583
and what would be their economic profit?
