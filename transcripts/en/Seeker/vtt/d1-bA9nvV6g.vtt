Like people, stars can teach us a lot, but
through a telescope old galaxies look young,

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:10.139
and old stars have iron deficiency.

Hey everyone, Trace here for DNews with our
Weekly Space Update, this week was a fun week

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.730
for space -- with astronomers discovering
the YOUNGEST galaxy in the universe, and the

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.770
OLDEST star in the universe! Same week, guys!
Crazy.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.949
Thirteen point seven five BILLION years ago,
the Big Bang happened. Then a few million

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.620
years later, the first stars formed. Just
this week astronomers at The Australian National

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.649
University identified one of those first stars,
and it's only 6,000 light-years away from

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.100
earth! These scientists were able to discern
the QUOTE "fingerprint" of an ancient star

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.269
at the Mount Stromlo Observatory.

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.800
Basically, new stars have way more iron than
ancient stars. For instance, to make a star

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.300
like our sun, you need a mass of 1,000 Earths
of iron, plus a lot of hydrogen and helium.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.000
Easy. But ancient stars have no detectable
level of iron, and THIS one is very rich in

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.480
carbon! The theory is, this is a "second generation"
star that formed in the wake of a primordial

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.510
star, which are 60 times the mass of our Sun.
The primordial star had lots of hydrogen and

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.280
helium just like today, but when it collapsed,
the ensuing black hole sucked in the iron,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.630
leaving this characteristic fingerprint. Hopefully,
this discovery will help astronomers learn

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.930
about how stars formed in the early universe,
AND gives us a glimpse into the birth of everything

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.000
we know!

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.710
The youngest galaxy can ALSO teach us about
the early universe, because it's not actually

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:45.000
young... NOW. The Hubble Space Telescope just
spotted the YOUNGEST galaxy ever discovered:

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Abell2744_Y1. It is SO FAR AWAY it took 13
billion years for the light to get to us.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:59.140
Remember, the Big Bang, 3.75 billion years
ago, so the light getting to us NOW was generated

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.570
by this galaxy only 650 million years after
the Big Bang! It took so long for us to see

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.999
it, we're literally looking back in time to
how it WAS not how it IS.

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:14.299
We're hoping this will help us learn how early
galaxies formed in the first billion years

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.819
of the universe's existence. Scientists publishing
their findings in Astronomy and Astrophysics

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.819
Letters are also hoping they can use Abell
to explore dark matter. Abell2744_Y1 is 30

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.219
times smaller than the Milky Way, but has
a MASSIVE amount of gravity for some reason.

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:37.219
The gravity is so strong, it warps space around
it! It creates a strange lens, sort of like

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:44.659
bending glass, which causes nearby objects
to look brighter than they really are. Abell2744_Y1

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:51.030
is also churning out at least 10 times more
stars and contains a large amount of gas,

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.060
but they don't really know why.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.280
To get as much information as they can, NASA
and other astronomers are using the infrared

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.870
from the Spitzer Telescope, x-ray from the
Chandra X-Ray Observatory, and the Hubble!

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.909
It's KIND OF A big deal. Discoveries like
this uncover how the universe formed, why

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.989
it exists and why it looks like it does now.

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.680
