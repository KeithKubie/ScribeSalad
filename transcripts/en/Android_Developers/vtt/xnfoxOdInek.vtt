00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:01.430
Hello.

00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:03.990
My name is Rich Hyndman, and
welcome to This Week in Android

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.130
Development on Monday,
February 10, 2014.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.830
Last week, Paul Carff gave us
an overview of the Google Cast

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.180
SDK, while Kevin Nilson gave
us the highlights on the SDK

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.100
for iOS.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.460
Krispy went over Cast Receivers
and Google Cast for Chrome--

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.250
and yes, that is his name.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.970
Nazmul and special
guest, Richard Fulcher

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.190
of the Android design team,
explained User Research.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:27.790
Nazmul is special guest crazy.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.920
Has one every single week.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.070
Todd had another
Play Games for iOS.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.010
And coming this week,
Fred's mystery DevByte

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.102
might actually launch.

00:00:36.102 --> 00:00:38.310
I wonder what one thing
Android developers are hoping

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.540
will come really, really soon?

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.850
Also this week, Katherine
Kuan makes her debut

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.779
explaining the Google API
Client and Google Play Services.

00:00:46.779 --> 00:00:48.320
My contribution to
the team this week

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.070
is to solemnly promise never to
play flap, flap, flapping games

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:52.080
ever again.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:53.830
And with that, that's
all for this week

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.180
in Android Development.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.220
I'm Rich Hyndman, and
my head is an animal.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.220
And once there was an animal, it
had a son that mowed the lawn.
