00:00:01.534 --> 00:00:06.539
( intro music )

00:00:34.266 --> 00:00:38.203 line:0%
( applause )

00:00:38.203 --> 00:00:41.240
Robert: I'm going to
start off with a bold

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.676
and probably
unsubstantiated claim

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.079 line:0%
which is that robotics
is the next internet.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.415 line:0%
What I mean by that is
it's the next big thing

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:51.583 line:0%
to impact our lives whether

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:53.118
it's biomedical applications,

00:00:53.118 --> 00:00:55.055
whether it's automating
our daily lives.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:59.492
Before I get into what I
think are the big topics,

00:00:59.492 --> 00:01:02.261
the hot topics in
some of our research,

00:01:02.261 --> 00:01:04.730
I want to give you
a little bit of history.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.334
Robotics as a term was
coined actually back

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.870
in the 1920's by
a Czech playwright

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.007
in a play called "Rossum's
Universal Robots."

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:16.376
Apparently, the play wasn't
very good but nonetheless,

00:01:16.376 --> 00:01:18.378
it brought the word robots
to the English language.

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:21.180
In fact, the word
initially meant

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.550
the use of mechanized labor.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.153
Basically, doing things
that we didn't wanna do,

00:01:27.153 --> 00:01:29.155
automating our lives.

00:01:29.155 --> 00:01:33.926
The next example I'll give is
from Fritz Lang's "Metropolis"

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:37.063
which I'm sure most of
you have seen or if not,

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:40.366
have seen some of the iconic
art work from this film.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:43.436
Another example progressing
on in terms of time

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:45.237
is Asimov's robot series.

00:01:45.237 --> 00:01:47.507
I won't keep going
on forward through

00:01:47.507 --> 00:01:49.308
Terminator movies
and Star Wars movies

00:01:49.308 --> 00:01:51.110
and that sort of thing.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.946
You'll notice a theme
in these examples

00:01:53.946 --> 00:01:58.284
is the robot uprising
and the dystopic view

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:01.054
of what robots will
do to the world.

00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:03.189
To depart from that, I'd
like to give an example

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.793
of what I think are my two
favorite robots in history.

00:02:07.793 --> 00:02:09.795 line:0%
Voyager 1 was a robot.

00:02:09.795 --> 00:02:11.564 line:0%
It was a teleoperated
robot but it took

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:14.066 line:0%
one of the most
profound pictures,

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:16.535
I'm sure you now
agree, of earth.

00:02:16.535 --> 00:02:18.037
This is back in 1990.

00:02:18.037 --> 00:02:23.609
The second photo that I
think is very telling about

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:27.146
not just robots
but human curiosity

00:02:27.146 --> 00:02:29.815
and the advances of technology
is what I would think

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:31.283
is one of the
first robot selfies

00:02:31.283 --> 00:02:33.586
which is the Curiosity
rover on Mars.

00:02:33.586 --> 00:02:36.121
These are two of
my favorite images

00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:39.158
and what I find the
most powerful and moving

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:41.694
photographs that I've ever seen.

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:45.031
Okay, that said and
if you think about

00:02:45.031 --> 00:02:47.800
these examples and
you think about

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.368
all the science fiction
movies that you've seen

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:51.270
that have robots in them,
you could be asking,

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.039
"Where are all the robots?

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.509
Why are there no robots
that are making me dinner,

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.212
and folding my
clothes et cetera?"

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.747
The answer is that there's
a lot of big challenges.

00:03:01.747 --> 00:03:02.982
There's a lot of difficulty

00:03:02.982 --> 00:03:04.650
in bringing these
things to real life.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.618
I'll show you just
a couple brief examples

00:03:06.618 --> 00:03:08.220
of where these
things actually exist

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.057
in modern life and technology.

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:13.326
One is the things that
are welding the doors

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.061
on your cars in
the assembly line.

00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:18.064
These are big, bulky,
very precise fast things.

00:03:18.064 --> 00:03:19.765
One of the things
you'll notice in this

00:03:19.765 --> 00:03:21.266
is that there's no humans
anywhere near these

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:22.668
because they're very dangerous.

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:25.505
Thinking about adopting
these technologies

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:28.106
to more household
or everyday use,

00:03:28.106 --> 00:03:29.475
there's some challenges there.

00:03:29.475 --> 00:03:31.544
Perhaps, you have one
of these in your house.

00:03:31.544 --> 00:03:34.246
Here's what might be the
first useful, accessible

00:03:34.246 --> 00:03:36.849
robotic technology
that you can use.

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:41.921
The obligatory bullet points to
tell you what we are working on

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:43.322
and our view of the world

00:03:43.322 --> 00:03:45.258
in terms of the
opportunities in robotics.

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.892
The opportunities
to get these things

00:03:46.892 --> 00:03:50.929
to be more useful, more
ubiquitous, cheaper, et cetera,

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:53.299
we focus on a couple of things.

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.666
One is...

00:03:54.666 --> 00:03:56.836
I guess they can be
collectively combined

00:03:56.836 --> 00:03:58.337
into where we get
our inspiration.

00:03:58.337 --> 00:04:01.140
The first one is
inspiration from nature.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:02.908
For a lot of the
different functions

00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:05.011
that we might to
achieve with our robots

00:04:05.011 --> 00:04:07.480
there is likely
a biologic analog.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.315
We work with
biologists extensively

00:04:09.315 --> 00:04:12.852
to try to extract
out those principles

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:15.588
and try to embody them
in our engineered systems.

00:04:15.588 --> 00:04:18.458
The second one is
non-traditional places.

00:04:18.458 --> 00:04:20.259
That'll become a little bit
more clear in a few slides

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:21.560
when I show you some
of the ways

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.128
that we actually
build these robots.

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:25.731
What I'm going to talk about

00:04:25.731 --> 00:04:28.033
is one example, I guess
a couple of examples,

00:04:28.033 --> 00:04:30.903 line:0%
but one example in particular
of bioinspired robots

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:33.272 line:0%
and to do this, we have
to answer questions

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:34.874 line:0%
in new manufacturing,
new materials

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:37.309 line:0%
in ways of building
these systems.

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:39.612
Okay so to phrase this question,

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.080
let's watch these video.

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:43.616
This is a carpenter bee.

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.685
As an engineer,
I can look at this

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:48.721
and start to ask some
really well-posed questions

00:04:48.721 --> 00:04:50.590
that drives some
of our research.

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.891
How are the wings moving?

00:04:51.891 --> 00:04:53.225
How are the wings
interacting with the air

00:04:53.225 --> 00:04:54.760
and generating vortices

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.361
that it's then manipulating
through its wings?

00:04:56.361 --> 00:04:58.764
What is the thoracic mechanics

00:04:58.764 --> 00:05:00.599
that is moving the wings about?

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:02.401
What is the muscular that's
driving thoracic mechanics?

00:05:02.401 --> 00:05:03.602
What are the metabolic processes

00:05:03.602 --> 00:05:04.670
that are driving the muscles,

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:05.704
that are driving the mechanics,

00:05:05.704 --> 00:05:06.605
that are driving the wings?

00:05:06.605 --> 00:05:07.506
What is the flight mode?

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:08.641
What are the sensors
that it's using?

00:05:08.641 --> 00:05:09.775
What are the control
methodologies?

00:05:09.775 --> 00:05:10.809
What is the neurobiology?

00:05:10.809 --> 00:05:13.612
All these really
interesting questions...

00:05:13.612 --> 00:05:15.948
( audience laughing )

00:05:15.948 --> 00:05:21.087
...that we as engineers
can start to sort of boil down

00:05:21.087 --> 00:05:24.623
into the topics that
we have to work on

00:05:24.623 --> 00:05:27.860
if we wanted to actually
make one of these.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:32.531
This is the... one prototype
of our robotic insects.

00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.099
I'm not going to pass it around.

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:38.170
I'd be happy to show
it to you afterwards.

00:05:38.170 --> 00:05:40.973
Questions about if we're
going to make something

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:42.641
that operates like this,

00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:46.445
this is just an
animation of a hoverfly.

00:05:46.445 --> 00:05:48.480
If we're going to make something
in an engineered system

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.248
that works something like this,

00:05:49.248 --> 00:05:50.416
how do we do it?

00:05:50.416 --> 00:05:51.617
What are the answers
to those questions

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:53.485
that I just posed
that are derived from

00:05:53.485 --> 00:05:55.187
these natural systems?

00:05:55.187 --> 00:05:57.823
One of the biggest ones
is how do you make it?

00:05:57.823 --> 00:05:59.825
The first question that I had

00:05:59.825 --> 00:06:03.529
is how would I piece together
the components for this?

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:06.298
I would argue that I don't
want to do it this way.

00:06:06.298 --> 00:06:09.168
I don't want to take
hundreds or even thousands

00:06:09.168 --> 00:06:10.669
of very complex
geometrical components

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:12.371
and piece them together
under a microscope.

00:06:12.371 --> 00:06:16.642
That would my drive my
graduate students crazy.

00:06:16.642 --> 00:06:18.544
That wouldn't work.

00:06:18.544 --> 00:06:21.280
We had to come up with
alternative solutions.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.783
I'm contradicting myself
because this is actually

00:06:23.783 --> 00:06:25.551
an attempt to sort of a
nuts and bolts approach,

00:06:25.551 --> 00:06:27.853
to actually piece
together components.

00:06:27.853 --> 00:06:30.422
This is the old way before
we had the discovery

00:06:30.422 --> 00:06:31.791
which I'll show you in a minute.

00:06:31.791 --> 00:06:33.392
This is literally
what it looks like.

00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:35.561
You're actually piecing together
all the different components

00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:37.196
and I won't get into the
details what these things are.

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:38.798
There are the motors.

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:40.365
There are the wings.

00:06:40.365 --> 00:06:41.600
There are the little mechanisms

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.569
that cause the thing
to move properly

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.137
and that sort of thing.

00:06:45.137 --> 00:06:46.672
If we want to get around that,

00:06:46.672 --> 00:06:47.940
how do we do this?

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.710
Well, it turns out we
took inspiration from,

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:53.212
I guess in hindsight, is
a nontraditional place,

00:06:53.212 --> 00:06:56.481
my son's library.

00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:58.517
My son at the time,
a couple of years ago,

00:06:58.517 --> 00:07:00.319
was really into pop-up books.

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:02.288
If you think about
a pop-up book,

00:07:02.288 --> 00:07:04.122
I think about it as
fantastically

00:07:04.122 --> 00:07:06.225
complicated structures
and mechanisms

00:07:06.225 --> 00:07:08.527
that are created by
extremely unskilled users.

00:07:08.527 --> 00:07:10.163
I'm not talking about the
people that made the book.

00:07:10.163 --> 00:07:12.331
I'm talking about the kids
that operate the books.

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:13.533
You open up the books.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:15.601
You do something very
simple like opening a page

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:17.537
or pulling something

00:07:17.537 --> 00:07:20.705
and out of this page comes
these fantastic structures.

00:07:20.705 --> 00:07:22.275
We do something very similar.

00:07:22.275 --> 00:07:24.243
We call this process
pop-up book MEMS.

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:25.844
It goes as follows.

00:07:25.844 --> 00:07:28.481
You basically build all of
the components that you want.

00:07:28.481 --> 00:07:30.916
Like I said, the motors,
the wings, et cetera.

00:07:30.916 --> 00:07:32.819
You also build
a scaffold around it.

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:35.788
That's what this sort of
surrounding area is here.

00:07:35.788 --> 00:07:39.058
Then by proper design of all
the individual components

00:07:39.058 --> 00:07:41.828
in this quasi
two-dimensional composite.

00:07:41.828 --> 00:07:43.795
If it's designed right
and constructed properly,

00:07:43.795 --> 00:07:46.832
which of course I'm not
getting much into the details,

00:07:46.832 --> 00:07:49.001 line:0%
then all I'd have
to do is push on it

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:50.802 line:0%
and that's we'll
show in this video.

00:07:50.802 --> 00:07:52.271 line:0%
All you have to do is push on it

00:07:52.271 --> 00:07:53.472 line:0%
and out pops the
device that I want

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:55.141 line:0%
because all of the
trajectories that

00:07:55.141 --> 00:07:56.709 line:0%
are associated with the
assembly of this device

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:58.944 line:0%
are controlled by
the mechanisms that

00:07:58.944 --> 00:08:00.812 line:0%
are built into this
pop-up structure.

00:08:00.812 --> 00:08:04.483 line:0%
This allows us to build our
computational origami friends.

00:08:04.483 --> 00:08:06.585 line:0%
This is a real thing.

00:08:06.585 --> 00:08:09.454 line:0%
Actually, you can prove that
you can make anything you want

00:08:09.454 --> 00:08:11.890 line:0%
in terms of any
geometric complexity,

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:13.859 line:0%
any mechanism that
you want to build

00:08:13.859 --> 00:08:14.993 line:0%
can be done in this way.

00:08:14.993 --> 00:08:16.562 line:0%
We can make things
arbitrarily complicated.

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:19.365 line:0%
We can make things with
any material combination,

00:08:19.365 --> 00:08:22.301 line:0%
metals, composites, polymer,
ceramics, doesn't matter.

00:08:22.301 --> 00:08:23.769 line:0%
We can do this very quickly.

00:08:23.769 --> 00:08:25.137 line:0%
We're experimental robotics,

00:08:25.137 --> 00:08:27.272 line:0%
we know actually very
little about the physics

00:08:27.272 --> 00:08:30.275 line:0%
of the devices that we make.

00:08:30.275 --> 00:08:32.110
Not for lack of trying
but just because

00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.679
it's complex, fluid
structure interactions,

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:36.248 line:0%
all these difficult things.

00:08:36.248 --> 00:08:37.949 line:0%
What we do then is
we build and test,

00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:39.784 line:0%
build and test, and
often test to failure

00:08:39.784 --> 00:08:40.986 line:0%
as I'll show you in a moment.

00:08:40.986 --> 00:08:42.554 line:0%
This is a resulting device.

00:08:42.554 --> 00:08:43.922
You'll notice that every device

00:08:43.922 --> 00:08:45.124
that I show you
will look different.

00:08:45.124 --> 00:08:46.258
That's just because
we learn something

00:08:46.258 --> 00:08:48.294
and change the design
and reiterate on that.

00:08:48.294 --> 00:08:50.062
I should mention the way
that we're building things,

00:08:50.062 --> 00:08:51.664
this concept of a scaffold

00:08:51.664 --> 00:08:53.398
building all the
components for you.

00:08:53.398 --> 00:08:54.800
We like to think in some way

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.802
fulfills Richard
Feynman's prophecy

00:08:56.802 --> 00:08:59.304
about small robots
building small robots.

00:08:59.304 --> 00:09:01.674
That's the way that
we think about this.

00:09:01.674 --> 00:09:04.243
We can build things in
bulk just by the fact

00:09:04.243 --> 00:09:07.446
that this is inherently
parallelizable process.

00:09:07.446 --> 00:09:09.915
Bulk, for us, is only
a few but that's okay.

00:09:09.915 --> 00:09:11.751
We plugged these things in.

00:09:11.751 --> 00:09:12.785
We test them.

00:09:12.785 --> 00:09:15.020
Flap wings around, do some
system identification,

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.722
all sorts of interesting things

00:09:16.722 --> 00:09:20.459
to try to understand how
this thing actually works.

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:22.294
Then plug it in, turn it on.

00:09:22.294 --> 00:09:24.863 line:0%
This has sped down by
a factor of one eighth

00:09:24.863 --> 00:09:26.231 line:0%
and this is what happens...

00:09:26.231 --> 00:09:27.600 line:0%
( audience laughing )

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.869
...every time.

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:34.039 line:0%
In fact, if you look at it in
real time, this is very fast.

00:09:34.039 --> 00:09:38.243
This is just a consequence of
the dynamics of this system.

00:09:38.243 --> 00:09:43.982
Insects are very unlike
the airplanes that we ride in.

00:09:43.982 --> 00:09:46.852
The 747s of the world are
designed to be passively stable.

00:09:46.852 --> 00:09:50.790
If the engines turn off, it
should glide down to safety

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:55.461
without the presence
of active control.

00:09:55.461 --> 00:09:56.762
Insects are not that way.

00:09:56.762 --> 00:09:58.997
They're unstable and this
leads to the maneuverability

00:09:58.997 --> 00:10:01.467
that you've experienced if
you ever try to swat them.

00:10:01.467 --> 00:10:02.801
( audience laughing )

00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:07.005
What I'm saying is they're
the fighter jets of the world.

00:10:07.005 --> 00:10:09.141
If we can properly
stabilize these systems

00:10:09.141 --> 00:10:10.809
then they become
quite maneuverable.

00:10:10.809 --> 00:10:12.878 line:0%
After plenty of trial and error,

00:10:12.878 --> 00:10:14.713 line:0%
again this has sped
down one eighth time.

00:10:14.713 --> 00:10:17.349
We are able to control
the flight of these things.

00:10:17.349 --> 00:10:18.817
One of the first
demonstrations that we had,

00:10:18.817 --> 00:10:19.985
which we were very excited about

00:10:19.985 --> 00:10:22.654
a couple of years ago,
was just hover.

00:10:22.654 --> 00:10:24.723
It turns out that's one of
the more difficult things

00:10:24.723 --> 00:10:25.991
that we can try to do.

00:10:25.991 --> 00:10:27.993
We can also take advantage of
some of these fast dynamics

00:10:27.993 --> 00:10:29.895
that I was alluding
to and also some of

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:32.665
the physics of scaling to
allow these things to perch.

00:10:32.665 --> 00:10:33.999
Once we have these
things working,

00:10:33.999 --> 00:10:35.634
we're doing all sorts
of cute demonstrations

00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:39.271
of how they can behave
like the insects that
we try to mimic.

00:10:39.271 --> 00:10:43.475
I just want to wrap up with
a couple of other topics

00:10:43.475 --> 00:10:45.645
and other broad
statements of course.

00:10:45.645 --> 00:10:49.081
We also make a host of
other bioinspired robots.

00:10:49.081 --> 00:10:51.984 line:0%
I'm showing you these not just
because they're cool or creepy

00:10:51.984 --> 00:10:55.453 line:0%
but because they actually
represent one of our big pushes

00:10:55.453 --> 00:10:58.623
which is all of our bioinspired
work takes cues from nature

00:10:58.623 --> 00:11:01.126
and tries to instantiate
that in robots.

00:11:01.126 --> 00:11:03.896
We're actually seeing that
arrow of bioinspiration reverse

00:11:03.896 --> 00:11:05.764
because now we can
start to build robots

00:11:05.764 --> 00:11:07.900
which mimics some of the
features of natural systems

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:10.335
that we can test our
hypothesis on natural systems

00:11:10.335 --> 00:11:13.105
and I say us, our
biologist colleagues,

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:16.474
in ways that would be difficult
to do with the actual animal.

00:11:16.474 --> 00:11:18.209
This is really exciting for us.

00:11:18.209 --> 00:11:20.179
We also make little
cockroach-like robots.

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.181
This is in real time.

00:11:22.181 --> 00:11:24.549
I'm just showing you this
because we can make claims that

00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:25.751
these things are actually some

00:11:25.751 --> 00:11:27.186
of the fastest
robots in the world

00:11:27.186 --> 00:11:30.088
if you normalize the body
length which of course a caveat.

00:11:30.088 --> 00:11:32.391
In fact, twice as fast
as Usain Bolt.

00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:33.325 line:0%
Okay.

00:11:34.626 --> 00:11:37.196
I often get the questions so
I will preemptively answer it

00:11:37.196 --> 00:11:38.597
which is what would you
do with these things?

00:11:38.597 --> 00:11:40.666
Why are you doing this?

00:11:40.666 --> 00:11:43.335
The main thing that
gets us excited

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:45.837
is that it's a basic
research topic

00:11:45.837 --> 00:11:48.974
that all of these topics
in fluid mechanics

00:11:48.974 --> 00:11:52.444
and microfabrication and
bioengineering, et cetera

00:11:52.444 --> 00:11:54.312
are what really drive us.

00:11:54.312 --> 00:11:56.282
The technology fallout
that comes from this

00:11:56.282 --> 00:11:59.751
meaning technology fallout
like I have a former student

00:11:59.751 --> 00:12:01.253
that started a company
that's trying

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:02.955
to find commercial
applications for the way

00:12:02.955 --> 00:12:04.590
that we build things.

00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:06.091
We also have prototypes
for making little,

00:12:06.091 --> 00:12:08.394
minimally invasive surgical
tools using the same techniques.

00:12:08.394 --> 00:12:10.996
But you can also use these
things in the future,

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:13.131
10-20 years down the road
when they're working

00:12:13.131 --> 00:12:16.168
for things like search
and rescue where

00:12:16.168 --> 00:12:18.570
a firefighter might have a
thousand of these things onsite

00:12:18.570 --> 00:12:21.040
that flies through a building
looking for human survivors,

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:23.541
or even hazardous
environment explorations,

00:12:23.541 --> 00:12:25.010
space exploration, et cetera.

00:12:25.010 --> 00:12:27.379
These are the common
themes that are

00:12:27.379 --> 00:12:28.781
the longer term goals of this.

00:12:28.781 --> 00:12:31.717
Lastly, I'll say that
these things turn out

00:12:31.717 --> 00:12:34.920
to be extremely useful
for education purposes.

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:36.589
We go from school to school,

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:39.325
and also festivals,
local and national

00:12:39.325 --> 00:12:41.826
to try to get kids excited
in STEM.

00:12:41.826 --> 00:12:43.963
It turns out and I
mean no disrespect

00:12:43.963 --> 00:12:47.666
to our theoretical
physicist colleagues

00:12:47.666 --> 00:12:50.770
that this is much more
likely to get kids interested

00:12:50.770 --> 00:12:52.604
in science and engineering
than string theories.

00:12:52.604 --> 00:12:55.007
I apologize if that's your area.

00:12:55.007 --> 00:12:57.943
With that, I will stop and
I'll thank you for listening.

00:12:57.943 --> 00:12:59.144
Thank you.

00:12:59.144 --> 00:13:01.580
( applause )

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:06.585 line:0%
