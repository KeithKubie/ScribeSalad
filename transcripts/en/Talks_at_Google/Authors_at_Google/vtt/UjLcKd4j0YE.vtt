MALE SPEAKER: Happy Halloween.

00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:22.600
Welcome to Talks at
Google in Cambridge, Mass.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.700
It's great to see
such a big crowd.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.370
I think we all know
why we're here,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:31.680
because this office is such a
huge supporter of neuroscience.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.960
I'm sure I am not
the only person who

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.000
subscribes to Alerts
on Google Scholar.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.470
Tim Verstynen, faculty
at Carnegie Mellon today.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.060
This is just a small
sample of his papers.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.680
His co-author, Bradley Voytek
of UC San Diego, similarly.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.860
These are giants in the field.

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.790
They're also pioneers in the
field of zombie research.

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.785
And there's not a
lot more to say.

00:01:02.785 --> 00:01:05.760
I know their parents are
exceptionally proud of them.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.760
I know we're eager
to hear what Tim

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.870
has to say about developments
in this emerging field

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.430
that he is helping
to blaze a path in.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.630
So without further
ado, please join me

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.620
in welcoming the author of
this seminal and groundbreaking

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.750
book, "Do Zombies
Dream of Undead Sheep?

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.760
A Neuroscientific View of the
Zombie Brain," Tim Verstynen.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.940
TIM VERSTYNEN: Thank you, and
Happy Halloween, everybody.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:37.130
Thanks for coming.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.273
Before I get into
it, I just would

00:01:39.273 --> 00:01:41.810
like to point out that my
collaborator, Bradley Voytek,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.540
and I have kind of
teamed up on this.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.250
And what you're going
to see is a hobby

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.020
that's gone out of hand.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.230
It's just-- we are
both zombie geeks,

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.940
and how this started was
that in graduate school

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.120
we were both in the same
program, and in our off hours

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.360
we liked to just geek out
and watch zombie movies.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.744
And being nerds,
we decided, well,

00:02:01.744 --> 00:02:03.410
what would happen
with the zombie brain?

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.100
And it all went
downhill from there.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.229
So you're about to see
the aftermath of that.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.110
But before I really get into
the nitty gritty details, just

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.150
a disclaimer, I'm going to be
showing clips from some zombie

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.400
movies, primarily "Night
of the Living Dead,"

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.950
because it's the best
zombie movie ever.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.640
So it's going to be a little
bit of 1960s-style gore,

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.560
and some spoilers.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.371
So just be warned.

00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:27.870
All right.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.460
So I get asked this question
a lot by my colleagues

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.130
in neuroscience.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.960
Why zombie neuroscience?

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:36.790
Why are we doing this silly
endeavor on our off hours

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.880
instead of writing another Grant

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.732
Well, Brad and I are both big
science outreach advocates.

00:02:42.732 --> 00:02:44.440
And one of the things
we're interested in

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.370
is trying to get general
audiences more engaged

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.950
with basic science information.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.120
By and large, the way
the broader public

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.080
gets science is filtered through
types of media sources that

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.604
try to spin it and make big
mountains of small molehills.

00:03:01.604 --> 00:03:02.770
And often it gets distorted.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.930
So I think we need to get the
general public more engaged

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.465
in the real core
scientific literature.

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:10.590
So we've thought about
possibilities of doing this.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.580
One, we thought about using
internet memes as our figures

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:15.040
to illustrate our findings.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.510
So, you know, use your LOL cat
to display heavy in networks.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:20.900
That didn't go over so well.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.940
We pondered accidentally
releasing sex tapes

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.520
during our lectures to get a
broader audience coming in.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.080
Our lawyers suggested
that we don't do that.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.100
And we thought well, maybe
we could attract more readers

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.610
to our journal
articles if we just

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.680
added a Kardashian
to the author list.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.694
Again, apparently, you
need their permission

00:03:39.694 --> 00:03:41.360
in order to put them
on the author list.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.550
So this didn't work.

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.600
And each one of these approaches
has the following structure.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.610
What we're doing is we're
trying to take aspects

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.740
of popular culture and
inject it into science,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.050
and kind of pull people
into the basic science.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:55.540
And it's kind of hard to do.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.270
So I think what we need to
do is, instead, flip this,

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.170
and say bring science
into popular culture.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.890
How can we start bringing
real scientific principles

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.560
into popular culture in
order to educate the broader

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.370
public on scientific issues?

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.980
And so this was
our first attempt

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.330
at this kind of leveraging
of science information

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.320
into popular culture.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.490
And so, of course, us
being zombie nerds,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.649
well, we're going to take
a look at zombies first.

00:04:19.649 --> 00:04:21.370
They're actually
a perfect example

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.680
for exploring neuroscientific
ideas in this broader context.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.500
So that's why
zombie neuroscience.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.320
So for the next about half
an hour or so, bear with me.

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.930
We're going to be
suspending our disbelief

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.880
and pretending that outside,
around Kendall Square,

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.200
the undead are walking around.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.880
In fact, on a Halloween
like today, there probably

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.890
are undead walking
around Kendall Square.

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.480
So welcome to The Science
of Surviving the Zombie

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:51.430
Apocalypse, more importantly
the neuroscience of it.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.170
So as a scientist, and as a
neuroscientist in particular,

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.910
when I see a zombie
like this woman here,

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.370
I see an undead
creature, yes, but I also

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.080
see a spectrum of very
particular types of behaviors

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.390
that you see repeated
again and again

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:10.620
and again in "The Walking Dead."

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.620
You see things like
hyperaggression,

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.300
memory deficits,
attention problems.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.030
You'll see language destruction,
reduced impulse control,

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.520
movement disorders, and even
visual recognition impairments.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.240
And these are seen across
almost every genre of the zombie

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.370
movie.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.060
So as a neuroscientist,
this tells us

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.380
something very interesting.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.080
This gives us some
pretty key insights

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.360
into what's happened to
this individual's brain

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.610
as she's gone from being
a high school cheerleader

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:43.600
into being a ravenous zombie.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.997
So using this collective
set of behaviors

00:05:48.997 --> 00:05:50.455
that have changed
in the zombie, we

00:05:50.455 --> 00:05:52.070
were able to
actually reconstruct

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.539
a model of what the
zombie brain looks like.

00:05:54.539 --> 00:05:55.830
Let me show you our model here.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.330
So on the left, right here, is
a normal, neurologically healthy

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:00.592
human individual.

00:06:00.592 --> 00:06:02.925
There's lots of tissue packed
into a really small space,

00:06:02.925 --> 00:06:05.000
so it's very wrinkly.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.110
And it's a very robust,
healthy-looking structure.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:11.490
On the right is
the zombie brain.

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.910
And what you see is
lots of big gaps,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.150
lots of space that's unused.

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:17.580
In fact, this
little guy back here

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.370
is completely gone
in the zombie brain.

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:21.660
We're going to get to
that a little bit later.

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:24.290
So this shows atrophy
in the zombie brain.

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:27.340
And this atrophy that
you're seeing isn't random.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:30.010
Each one of the areas that's
decayed away in the zombie

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:32.520
brain reflects a very
particular symptom

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.510
that we see in zombieism.

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.630
So the goal of "Do Zombies
Dream of Undead Sheep?"

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.420
is to take apart the
behavior of zombies

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.990
and link it back up to each one
of these brain regions that's

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:46.295
been atrophied and destroyed
in the zombie brain.

00:06:46.295 --> 00:06:47.920
So that's what we're
going to do today,

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:50.520
and just looking at a
few of these symptoms.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.680
Now before we do,
we're scientists.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.330
We like to take what seems
like supernatural phenomenon

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:00.690
and make it dry and boring
and clinically defined.

00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:02.150
So we're going to
define zombieism

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.785
not as zombies, but as
a clinical disorder.

00:07:04.785 --> 00:07:06.910
And so we're going to call
it Consciousness Deficit

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.910
Hypoactivity
Disorder, CDHD, which

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:12.180
is defined as the loss of
rational, voluntary, and

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:14.160
conscious behavior
that's been replaced

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.190
by delusional
impulsive aggression,

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.120
stimulus-driven attention, and
the inability to coordinate

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.140
motor or linguistic behaviors.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.640
There.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.740
We've stripped away
all the really weird,

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:26.350
supernatural stuff and made
it a nice, clean, studyable

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.240
phenomenon.

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.952
Also, with a cool
name like CDHD,

00:07:28.952 --> 00:07:30.660
maybe we can get a
pharmaceutical company

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.390
to fund our research.

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.900
All right.

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:36.646
So from now we're going to
be calling zombieism CDHD.

00:07:36.646 --> 00:07:38.020
And we're going
to try to explore

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:40.490
the neural underpinnings
of CDHD by going

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.080
through a set of symptoms
that we see with the disorder.

00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.830
So the first symptom, or the
first behavioral characteristic

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.730
that people notice when
they encounter the undead,

00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.660
is their hyperaggression.

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:56.570
Let's see an example
of this behavior.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.020
This is Karen.

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:01.350
Karen's just recently
turned to the undead.

00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:04.272
And here she's, I believe,
eating the arm of her father.

00:08:04.272 --> 00:08:06.730
And let's see what happens when
Karen runs into her mother.

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.714
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:08.714 --> 00:08:10.694
-Karen?

00:08:10.694 --> 00:08:11.194
Karen?

00:08:15.158 --> 00:08:15.658
Karen.

00:08:18.634 --> 00:08:19.626
What, baby?

00:08:22.598 --> 00:08:23.098
Baby!

00:08:26.945 --> 00:08:28.320
TIM VERSTYNEN:
Because you always

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.487
gotta get the garden shears.

00:08:29.487 --> 00:08:37.027
[SCREAMING]

00:08:37.027 --> 00:08:37.610
[END PLAYBACK]

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.901
TIM VERSTYNEN: We'll save
you the blood and gore there,

00:08:39.901 --> 00:08:42.020
but I think it's pretty
safe to say that Karen's

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:43.740
pretty angry with
her mother, right?

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:46.160
Now most normal kids who are
not angry with their parents

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.790
don't grab a garden shear
and start stabbing them.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:52.280
So this type of
aggression is interesting

00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.730
because it's very reflective of
a well-described type of anger

00:08:56.730 --> 00:08:59.640
known as reactive-impulsive
regression.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:01.242
This is a subtype
of aggression--

00:09:01.242 --> 00:09:03.450
and this is a quote from an
actual scientific paper--

00:09:03.450 --> 00:09:05.116
"a subtype of aggression
that can result

00:09:05.116 --> 00:09:07.690
in sudden, heightened, enduring,
or inappropriate aggressive

00:09:07.690 --> 00:09:08.580
responses."

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.624
So this is the stimulus-driven
type of aggression

00:09:12.624 --> 00:09:15.040
that you'll see when you engage
the body's fight or flight

00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:15.685
responses.

00:09:15.685 --> 00:09:17.810
And it's very different
than the type of aggression

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:20.380
you see in, say, something
like a school shooting, which

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.101
is a very calculated, decisive,
cool type of aggression.

00:09:25.101 --> 00:09:27.100
And we know a lot about
the neural underpinnings

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:28.683
of this reactive-impulsive
aggression.

00:09:28.683 --> 00:09:32.280
We sometimes call this
road rage aggression.

00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:34.540
So this type of
aggressive behavior

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:36.506
is well-characterized
in many animal models.

00:09:36.506 --> 00:09:38.630
So we've laid out a lot of
the neural circuits that

00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:40.550
drive this type of response.

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:44.120
So let's take a look at
those neural circuits.

00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:46.880
The control of
aggression, normally,

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:49.580
in hopefully everyone
in this room,

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:51.370
is regulated by
areas in the front

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:53.600
of the brain in the
prefrontal cortex,

00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.870
usually around what's known
as the orbitofrontal cortex

00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:57.880
or complex.

00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.110
And this is a set of
higher-level brain areas

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:02.790
that regulate a lot
of different things.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:04.331
But one of the things
they do is they

00:10:04.331 --> 00:10:06.790
regulate control of
subcortical networks, networks

00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:09.010
that are buried
deep in the brain.

00:10:09.010 --> 00:10:11.920
And in particular, one
area, known as the amygdala,

00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:15.340
receives extensive input from
this orbitofrontal complex.

00:10:15.340 --> 00:10:17.370
And what this does is
it acts as a cooling

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:19.400
mechanism for amygdala function.

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.640
So the orbitofrontal cortex
is doing the, sshhh, it's OK.

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:23.450
It's OK.

00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:25.364
And the amygdala
is hypersensitive

00:10:25.364 --> 00:10:27.030
to potential threats
in the environment.

00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:29.049
It's always looking
for a threat.

00:10:29.049 --> 00:10:31.590
So if we wanted to couch this
in Freudian terms-- and please,

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:32.650
I hope my department
chair doesn't

00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.149
hear me talking about Freud
in this talk-- you can think

00:10:35.149 --> 00:10:37.190
of the amygdala as being
the id and orbitofrontal

00:10:37.190 --> 00:10:38.770
cortex as being the superego.

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:43.180
It's trying to keep this
reactive, primal, instinctive

00:10:43.180 --> 00:10:45.440
fight or flight response intact.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.960
So the amygdala
controls aggression

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.950
through a very particular set
of interactions between areas

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:53.120
known as the hypothalamus
and the thalamus,

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:56.270
which in turn send
excitatory projections

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.980
to an area of the brain known
as the periaqueductal gray.

00:10:58.980 --> 00:11:01.750
This is buried deep,
deep in the brain.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:03.820
And the periaqueductal
gray stimulates

00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:07.510
your arousal mechanisms, so
it's what gets you ramped up,

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.650
and in this case, aggressive.

00:11:09.650 --> 00:11:11.840
So normally the
prefrontal cortex

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.900
is saying, calm
down, don't react.

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.390
That guy cut you off in traffic.

00:11:15.390 --> 00:11:17.130
Don't throw a brick
through his window.

00:11:17.130 --> 00:11:19.100
But if you remove the
orbitofrontal cortex

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.630
from the equation, what
happens is these subcortical

00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:23.870
fight or flight
responses are unchecked.

00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.800
So you get an unconstrained
amygdala response,

00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.260
which, through this
network of other areas,

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.600
increases sensitivity
to reactive behaviors.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.050
And what you get if you wipe
out those prefrontal control

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:40.360
mechanisms is you get a
unconstrained, impulsive rage.

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.930
You get more appetite
dysregulation, chronic stress

00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:44.940
responses.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:47.240
You'll even get
appetite dysregulation.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:50.390
So these are all behaviors that
you see in animals with damage

00:11:50.390 --> 00:11:51.570
to the orbitofrontal areas.

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.210
And you also see it in zombies.

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:54.760
So I think it's a
pretty good guess

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:57.310
that that's what we're
seeing, at least in this case,

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:58.540
with zombies.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:01.510
So if you look at the human
brain and the zombie brain side

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:03.880
by side, the
orbitofrontal areas that

00:12:03.880 --> 00:12:06.000
tend to control this
type of reactive response

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.130
rest right up here.

00:12:07.130 --> 00:12:09.620
This is the front side of the
brain, looking at the front,

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:11.714
and this is an underview
of the brain here.

00:12:11.714 --> 00:12:13.130
If we look at the
zombie brain, we

00:12:13.130 --> 00:12:15.790
see an atrophy of these
prefrontal networks.

00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:19.170
So that control
region has gone away.

00:12:19.170 --> 00:12:20.579
But that's not all.

00:12:20.579 --> 00:12:22.870
We don't just see extensive
damage to the zombie brain.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:24.960
We actually see some
plasticity as well.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.940
So if we look at those
subcortical areas,

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:29.130
like the amygdala and
the thalamus-- so this

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.230
is a slice through the brain
right about here on the left,

00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:35.210
showing the may amygdala in
red, and this guy on the right,

00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:38.850
this is a slice of the brain
this way showing the thalamus.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:43.170
And if you look at the volume
of these two subcortical areas,

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:45.850
the humans are displayed
in gray and zombies

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:46.940
are displayed in orange.

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:49.660
And we see, actually, these
areas should be bigger.

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:54.840
These areas are more enlarged
in the zombie or CDHD subtypes

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.580
than what you see in humans.

00:12:56.580 --> 00:12:58.040
So they're unconstrained.

00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:00.780
They're using more resources and
they're building more neurons,

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:02.930
so they're becoming
more sensitive.

00:13:02.930 --> 00:13:05.040
So this explains
a little bit how

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:10.170
you have this reactive
aggression in the zombie brain.

00:13:10.170 --> 00:13:14.220
So let's look at another
symptom of the zombie epidemic,

00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:15.875
or the CDHD epidemic.

00:13:15.875 --> 00:13:17.250
Let's look at
visual recognition.

00:13:17.250 --> 00:13:20.430
I'm going to show you two scenes
of the same two individuals.

00:13:20.430 --> 00:13:23.550
The first is the scene before
this gentleman here, Johnny,

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:24.320
has turned.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.800
And this is his sister Barbara.

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:26.466
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:26.466 --> 00:13:28.720
-So really be scared here.

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.190
-Johnny.

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:31.940
-You're still afraid.

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:32.730
-Stop it, now.

00:13:32.730 --> 00:13:33.330
I mean it.

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:41.350
-They're coming to
get you, Barbara.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:42.277
-Stop it.

00:13:42.277 --> 00:13:42.860
[END PLAYBACK]

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:43.359
OK.

00:13:43.359 --> 00:13:47.920
So it's very obvious he knows
who this person is, right?

00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.194
Now let's look at Johnny
after he's become a zombie.

00:13:51.194 --> 00:13:51.860
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:13:51.860 --> 00:13:52.840
[SCREAMING]

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.290
-No!

00:13:55.290 --> 00:13:56.270
No, get out!

00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:00.680
No!

00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:04.110
No, Johnny, no!

00:14:04.110 --> 00:14:06.070
No, no!

00:14:06.070 --> 00:14:06.987
No!

00:14:06.987 --> 00:14:07.570
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.340
So notice he doesn't have
that glint of recognition

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.220
in his eye.

00:14:11.220 --> 00:14:12.990
He doesn't see his sister.

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:16.990
He just sees a human that
he can devour, right?

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:19.580
He doesn't recognize her at all.

00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.090
This seems to be a
common phenomenon

00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:25.220
throughout the
zombie genre, right?

00:14:25.220 --> 00:14:28.240
You see, many times, two
high school sweethearts.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.980
One gets bitten and
turns into a zombie.

00:14:29.980 --> 00:14:31.270
As soon as they
turn into the zombie

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:33.320
they start to eat the
cheek of their loved one

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:34.903
because they no
longer recognize them.

00:14:34.903 --> 00:14:37.390
They just react as if this
is just some random person

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:39.210
they can devour.

00:14:39.210 --> 00:14:41.990
And this type of visual
recognition problem

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.090
resembles a well-described
psychiatric disorder

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.100
known as Capgras Delusion.

00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:49.079
Capgras Delusion
is the false belief

00:14:49.079 --> 00:14:51.620
that the people you know well
have been replaced by impostors

00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:54.004
and are typically
seen as a threat.

00:14:54.004 --> 00:14:56.170
This is kind of the "Invasion
of the Body Snatchers"

00:14:56.170 --> 00:14:57.470
psychiatric disorder.

00:14:57.470 --> 00:14:59.007
Very real disorder.

00:14:59.007 --> 00:15:00.590
So, you know, you
wake up one morning,

00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:02.798
and suddenly that's not your
wife laying next to you.

00:15:02.798 --> 00:15:05.620
That's some alien that's
inhabited your wife's body.

00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:07.970
She might look, sound,
talk like my wife,

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:10.240
but she's not really my wife.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.310
This isn't always bad.

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.976
There was a case
reported of a woman who

00:15:12.976 --> 00:15:15.550
was in a miserable
marriage for years.

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.000
She, I think, had a stroke,
developed Capgras Delusion,

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.958
and was convinced that
her husband was replaced

00:15:19.958 --> 00:15:21.565
by Casanova and
that she was having

00:15:21.565 --> 00:15:23.150
an illicit affair
with this Casanova

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.160
that was in her husband's body.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.868
And then her love life
actually improved.

00:15:25.868 --> 00:15:28.370
So it's not always bad.

00:15:28.370 --> 00:15:30.929
But Capgras Delusion is
a psychiatric problem,

00:15:30.929 --> 00:15:32.720
which means it's
characterized at this kind

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:33.870
of behavioral level.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:36.990
But we don't really know the
neural underpinnings of it.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.460
But the phenomenon
is very similar

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:42.030
to a well-described
neurological phenomenon

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:44.310
known as prosopagnosia.

00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:48.010
Prosopagnosia is the inability
to link a person's identity

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:50.320
to the visual image
of their face.

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.070
So in the classic scenario,
somebody with prosopagnosia,

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:56.250
you stand them in front
of a mirror and say, who's

00:15:56.250 --> 00:15:57.790
looking back at you?

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.900
And they won't be able
to tell you who they are.

00:15:59.900 --> 00:16:01.630
They'll just say, I see a face.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:02.590
I see that person.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.340
They've got a beard.

00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.350
But I don't know who they are.

00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:09.940
Or another famous example
is an experimenter

00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:11.840
will be showing a set
of faces on the screen.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:14.430
The experimenter's face
will come on the screen.

00:16:14.430 --> 00:16:16.270
The experimenter's
right here, and the guy

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:18.700
asks, who are you
seeing on the screen?

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.190
And the patient will reply,
I don't know, somebody.

00:16:22.190 --> 00:16:25.010
So this type of
disorder has been

00:16:25.010 --> 00:16:29.210
described in the neurological
literature for about 100 years

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:31.090
or so now.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.330
And it's linked to
disorders or damage

00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:38.430
to a particular network of areas
in the brain known as the face

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:39.101
network.

00:16:39.101 --> 00:16:39.600
OK.

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:41.970
So the face network,
particularly an area

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:44.810
known as the fusiform face
area, are a well-described set

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.970
of brain areas that
are sensitive to seeing

00:16:47.970 --> 00:16:49.540
faces more than
any other object.

00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:53.210
In fact, the face area
was first described at MIT

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:56.229
by Nancy Kanwisher
about 20 years ago.

00:16:56.229 --> 00:16:58.062
So the way the face
network is characterized

00:16:58.062 --> 00:17:00.586
is, let's say I put
you in an MRI scanner

00:17:00.586 --> 00:17:02.710
and look at the functional
activation of your brain

00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:03.751
when I show you pictures.

00:17:03.751 --> 00:17:05.680
So I show you a picture
of this dude here,

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:08.710
and then I show you
pictures of houses or cars.

00:17:08.710 --> 00:17:12.050
And I say, which areas are
more active to this face

00:17:12.050 --> 00:17:13.720
than to these cars?

00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:15.280
Well, what you
would see is a set

00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.780
of regions in the
back of the head

00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.910
on the underside
of the neocortex.

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.400
So each one of these blobs
here shows a separate region

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.089
that's more responsive to
this face than anything else.

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:26.780
This is sometimes known
as the core face network.

00:17:26.780 --> 00:17:30.480
And what these are is a set of
well-connected brain regions

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.440
that basically deconstruct
the visual image of the face,

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:39.140
reassemble it, and link it
categorically to an individual.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.830
So it's a stream of information
starting in the back, where

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:45.510
the primary visual cortex is,
that just sees spatial features

00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:48.220
and keeps moving forward to
higher-level areas of the brain

00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:51.050
until it's linked up to a face.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.650
So damage to any
part of this network

00:17:53.650 --> 00:17:55.290
can lead to prosopagnosia.

00:17:55.290 --> 00:17:57.290
And I'm going to show you
an interesting example

00:17:57.290 --> 00:18:00.320
of temporarily
induced prosopagnosia.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.630
What we're going
to see is a patient

00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:04.400
who's about ready to
undergo neurosurgery.

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.960
He's got a tumor
in the underside

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.220
of his brain near that
core face network.

00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:09.994
And surgeons want
to resect the tumor,

00:18:09.994 --> 00:18:11.910
but they don't want to
make him prosopagnosic.

00:18:11.910 --> 00:18:14.080
So what they did is they
implanted stimulators

00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.331
on the underside of his brain.

00:18:15.331 --> 00:18:16.955
And what they're
going to do is they're

00:18:16.955 --> 00:18:18.910
going to stimulate
different parts and see

00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:21.402
where does his face
perception get disrupted?

00:18:21.402 --> 00:18:22.860
And that way they
can map out where

00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.985
those face-selective areas
are and the neurosurgeon

00:18:24.985 --> 00:18:26.810
can kind of work around them.

00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:28.910
So you're going to
see two trials here.

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:31.160
In one trial, the
experimenter isn't

00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.560
going to deliver any
stimulation at all.

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:35.280
In the second trial,
they're actually

00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:37.470
going to deliver simulation.

00:18:37.470 --> 00:18:40.420
So this took place in
Stanford, and this patient

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:43.060
has no neuroscience or
psychology background

00:18:43.060 --> 00:18:43.592
whatsoever.

00:18:43.592 --> 00:18:45.050
So he doesn't know
what's going on.

00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:45.716
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:18:45.716 --> 00:18:50.411
-And tell me what happens
when I do this, all right?

00:18:50.411 --> 00:18:50.911
-OK.

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:58.060
-One, two, three.

00:18:58.060 --> 00:18:59.530
-Nothing.

00:18:59.530 --> 00:19:01.010
-Nothing?

00:19:01.010 --> 00:19:03.300
I'm going to do
it one more time.

00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:06.520
Look at my face.

00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:11.000
One, two, three.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.680
-You just turned
into somebody else.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.165
Your face metamorphosed.

00:19:16.165 --> 00:19:19.300
Your nose got saggy,
went to the left.

00:19:19.300 --> 00:19:23.460
You almost looked like
somebody I'd seen before,

00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:25.404
but somebody different.

00:19:25.404 --> 00:19:26.070
That was a trip.

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:27.090
[END PLAYBACK]

00:19:27.090 --> 00:19:28.760
I love that last line.

00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.570
So just a brief stimulation
of these face areas--

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:36.430
in this particular case it
was the fusiform face area--

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:39.230
cause this disruption of
the perception of the face.

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:41.147
And so as the clip goes
on-- I don't have time

00:19:41.147 --> 00:19:43.313
to show you the entire
clip-- the experimenter keeps

00:19:43.313 --> 00:19:46.060
turning down the voltage and
keeps turning down the current.

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.980
And eventually he says,
your face didn't change.

00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:51.370
I just didn't know you were you.

00:19:51.370 --> 00:19:54.805
So the disconnect between
seeing the face and the identity

00:19:54.805 --> 00:19:57.350
of the experimenter-- he was
looking at the experimenter,

00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:00.620
he knew who this person
was-- just got disconnected.

00:20:00.620 --> 00:20:03.300
So this is a great example
of a transiently induced

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:04.800
prosopagnosia.

00:20:04.800 --> 00:20:09.400
The whole image of the
face just got torn apart.

00:20:09.400 --> 00:20:14.240
So the face network is part
of a larger visual network

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.790
in the brain known as the
ventral visual stream.

00:20:16.790 --> 00:20:19.530
And so this is the ventral
visual stream in one

00:20:19.530 --> 00:20:22.050
of our zombie
experimental subjects.

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:24.740
So this is the primary
visual cortex here.

00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:27.430
And the information that flows
on the underside of the brain,

00:20:27.430 --> 00:20:29.730
mostly along the
temporal lobe-- and this

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:31.520
is the undercurrent
here-- is part

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.890
of the ventral visual stream.

00:20:32.890 --> 00:20:36.060
So this is the fusiform face
area I talked about earlier.

00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:38.712
This is known classically
is the "what" pathway.

00:20:38.712 --> 00:20:40.170
It's the pathway
in your brain that

00:20:40.170 --> 00:20:42.000
tries to assemble
object knowledge

00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.470
and recognize
objects in the world.

00:20:44.470 --> 00:20:46.820
So if we look at this
what pathway in a human--

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:48.570
if we did a slice right
through the brain,

00:20:48.570 --> 00:20:51.240
this would be like a sagittal
slice right through here--

00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.540
this is the main
core of the what

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.640
pathway on the left
and right side.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.410
In the zombie brain,
the what pathway

00:20:57.410 --> 00:20:58.760
would be extensively damaged.

00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:02.610
So they would have impaired face
knowledge, object knowledge.

00:21:02.610 --> 00:21:04.590
And this is actually
where the fusiform face

00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:06.540
area sits in the
right hemisphere.

00:21:06.540 --> 00:21:09.550
So we're going to say
that not only are zombies

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:12.820
losing the prefrontal
control of their aggression.

00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:14.930
They've also lost the
ability to recognize

00:21:14.930 --> 00:21:18.590
faces and other objects,
with few exceptions.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:19.590
OK.

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:22.330
Another classic
deficit we see in CDHD

00:21:22.330 --> 00:21:23.950
all the time is language.

00:21:23.950 --> 00:21:25.470
Zombies don't talk.

00:21:25.470 --> 00:21:28.280
In fact, I'm going to show
you an example of the most

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:31.410
fluent zombie we know of,
if you ignore that movie

00:21:31.410 --> 00:21:32.537
"Warm Bodies."

00:21:32.537 --> 00:21:33.468
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:33.468 --> 00:21:33.968
-Brains.

00:21:36.277 --> 00:21:36.860
[END PLAYBACK]

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:37.359
OK.

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:38.490
That's Tarman.

00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:44.500
Tarman is the individual who
single-handedly linked brains

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.460
to zombies.

00:21:45.460 --> 00:21:48.136
Up until Tarman, brains
and zombies weren't linked.

00:21:48.136 --> 00:21:49.760
Zombies would eat
any part of the body.

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.220
They'd go for the liver before
they'd go for the brain.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.420
But Tarman had a particular
taste for brains.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:21:58.592
And so he was the one who was
always going after brains.

00:21:58.592 --> 00:22:00.050
But I want you to
notice something.

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:04.400
Here he was asking this teenager
if he could eat her brains.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.292
But he didn't say,
can you come over

00:22:06.292 --> 00:22:07.750
here so that I can
eat your brains?

00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:10.440
Or, please come by because your
gray matter looks delicious.

00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.900
No, he just said, brains, right?

00:22:12.900 --> 00:22:15.760
You got the idea, but it
was a single-word sentence.

00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:19.480
That type of
phenomenon, if we see it

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.500
in clinical
neurological patients,

00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.520
is known as telegraphia.

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:26.410
So the idea being that patients
who are having difficulty

00:22:26.410 --> 00:22:30.260
getting words out will resort
to just the most critical parts

00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:32.560
of the sentence, the most
critical semantic parts

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.590
of the sentence, and take
away all the other fluency.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:37.890
And the name comes
from the old telegraph,

00:22:37.890 --> 00:22:41.980
for long-distance communication
a hundred and some years ago.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:43.900
In that case you paid
by the character, right?

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:48.360
So you had to make your notes
short, sweet, and to the point.

00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.180
The same is true
with these patients.

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:51.860
They have trouble
getting out words.

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:53.880
So the whole idea
is just to get out

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:56.730
the key most important
parts of the sentence.

00:22:56.730 --> 00:22:58.520
Now telegraphia is a
symptom that you've

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.260
seen in a larger class of
disorders known as aphasias.

00:23:02.260 --> 00:23:06.350
And aphasias are a broad
term that reflect, really,

00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:08.434
any language deficit, but
there's many subtypes.

00:23:08.434 --> 00:23:09.850
For example, there's
the inability

00:23:09.850 --> 00:23:11.720
to produce language,
which is classically

00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:15.030
known as Broca's Aphasia,
or difficulty comprehending

00:23:15.030 --> 00:23:19.410
language, which is classically
known as Wernicke's Aphasia.

00:23:19.410 --> 00:23:23.105
And each one of these two areas
has different cortical sources

00:23:23.105 --> 00:23:25.750
but that play a larger
part in the language

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:27.460
networks of the brain.

00:23:27.460 --> 00:23:31.360
So this is Tarman here,
holding his favorite dish,

00:23:31.360 --> 00:23:33.420
so this is a human
brain right here.

00:23:33.420 --> 00:23:35.260
We're looking on the left side.

00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:38.440
So Broca's area is
right up here in front.

00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:40.410
And this is the area
that, if you damage it,

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.830
gets you Broca's Aphasia.

00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:45.440
It's tightly linked up
to the motor cortex,

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:51.080
and it's single-handedly linked
to the language production

00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:51.850
end of things.

00:23:51.850 --> 00:23:54.670
So it's what forms
your mouth movements

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:59.090
and your gestural patterns
to producing language.

00:23:59.090 --> 00:24:01.870
In the back, right
in the temporal lobe,

00:24:01.870 --> 00:24:04.060
or right by the temporal
lobe and the parietal

00:24:04.060 --> 00:24:07.180
where they meet, you
see Wernicke's Area,

00:24:07.180 --> 00:24:10.250
which is a region that's linked
to language comprehension.

00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:13.560
So if you damage Wernicke's
Area, you can get words out.

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:14.940
They're just discombobulated.

00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:16.610
They're not well-structured.

00:24:16.610 --> 00:24:19.300
You also have difficulty
understanding people.

00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:21.810
And these two areas
are connected together

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:24.757
by a very large bundle of
white matter pathways known

00:24:24.757 --> 00:24:25.840
as the Arcuate Fasciculus.

00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:28.910
These are big superhighways
of the brain that

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:30.652
connect Wernicke's
and Broca's area.

00:24:30.652 --> 00:24:32.860
And you think about it as
language, what you're doing

00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.360
is you're constructing the idea
and semantics of what you're

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:38.630
saying, you're shipping all that
information out to the output

00:24:38.630 --> 00:24:41.110
area of the language
circuit and saying,

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:43.340
ship out this information
to the rest of the world.

00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:45.930
So information typically
flows from Wernicke's over

00:24:45.930 --> 00:24:46.890
to Broca's.

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:49.220
And damage to any
one of these areas

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.030
will impair language function.

00:24:52.030 --> 00:24:55.480
So if we look at this circuit
in the human and zombie brain--

00:24:55.480 --> 00:24:58.340
this is the human on the left--
Broca's would be right about up

00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.900
here and Wernicke's
right about back here--

00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:03.590
if you look in the zombie
brain, we see extensive atrophy

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:05.470
in both ends of the circuit.

00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:08.810
So basically this tells us,
don't try talking to a zombie.

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.310
They're not going
to understand you,

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.590
and they're not really
going to talk back

00:25:11.590 --> 00:25:13.610
except for maybe
asking for your brains.

00:25:13.610 --> 00:25:16.170
So this could
explain how you get

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:20.115
these sorts of language fluency
problems in the CDHD disorder.

00:25:23.230 --> 00:25:26.910
The final symptom I'm going to
go over for CDHD is movement.

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:29.220
And this is what really--
when you ask somebody

00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:32.740
to pretend to be a zombie, the
first thing they do is move

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.430
and walk like a
zombie-- so let's

00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:36.344
see a classic zombie
movement here.

00:25:36.344 --> 00:25:37.760
I want you to pay
attention to how

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:38.926
these creatures are walking.

00:25:38.926 --> 00:25:47.230
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:48.890
TIM VERSTYNEN: All right.

00:25:48.890 --> 00:25:53.780
So we have arms out, wide
lumbering stiff stance.

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.920
They tend to do this, right?

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:00.690
So there's obviously
something wrong with the way

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.280
their brains are
coordinating their actions.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.700
So let's take a quick look
at the general circuits

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:07.830
in the brain the
regulate our movements.

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.960
There are three big
collective circuits

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.529
in the brain that
drive our actions.

00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:14.070
There's actually
many more than this.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:16.750
These are just the
big sets of them.

00:26:16.750 --> 00:26:17.790
In the neocortex.

00:26:17.790 --> 00:26:19.520
You have the
cortical motor areas.

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:22.030
So this is our
zombie subject here.

00:26:22.030 --> 00:26:23.270
This is their brain.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:25.925
Everything shown here in gray
are cortical motor areas.

00:26:25.925 --> 00:26:27.300
And this is actually
a collection

00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:30.350
of a few dozen different
areas that collectively

00:26:30.350 --> 00:26:31.794
coordinate your actions.

00:26:31.794 --> 00:26:33.210
And they're
responsible for things

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:36.950
like sensory integration,
movement planning, and movement

00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:38.090
execution.

00:26:38.090 --> 00:26:41.070
So they kind of plan what to
do with the marionette strings

00:26:41.070 --> 00:26:43.880
of your muscles and joints
and coordinate those movements

00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:45.610
together.

00:26:45.610 --> 00:26:48.390
Underneath the motor cortex
and deep in the brain

00:26:48.390 --> 00:26:50.330
is an area known as
the basal ganglia.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:52.470
This is the second
major motor pathway.

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:56.240
So this little alien-looking
creature in here, that's

00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.020
a subcortical nuclei and part
of the basal ganglia circuit.

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:05.070
And what they do is they're
responsible for gating

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:06.430
or inhibiting actions.

00:27:06.430 --> 00:27:08.710
So really they're the
gatekeepers of the movements

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:09.766
that you execute.

00:27:09.766 --> 00:27:11.640
So they decide whether
or not you're actually

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:14.470
going to throw a brick
through a window or not.

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:18.070
So they kind of make that
final output decision.

00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:20.320
And then in the back
of the head here--

00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:21.910
this is shown right
back here-- is

00:27:21.910 --> 00:27:25.250
a little cauliflower-shaped
area of the brain

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:26.860
known as the cerebellum.

00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.940
Cerebellum's responsible
for motor timing

00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:32.490
and actual temporal
perception, too,

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.110
coordination, and
error correction.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:37.660
So it's the kind of quality
assessment guy that makes sure

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:40.450
that your actions are
being conducted smoothly

00:27:40.450 --> 00:27:43.980
and without major errors.

00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:46.920
So each one of these three areas
contributes in different ways

00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.180
to different types
of motor control.

00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:54.140
Now when most people look at
the way that zombies move,

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.019
the first thing
they'll say is, oh,

00:27:56.019 --> 00:27:57.560
they look like they
have Parkinson's.

00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.354
In fact, "Slate" just had a
write-up of one of our chapters

00:28:00.354 --> 00:28:01.270
in the book yesterday.

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:04.350
And their first title, before
we got them to change it,

00:28:04.350 --> 00:28:06.520
was "Do Zombies
have Parkinson's?"

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.020
And Parkinson's is a disorder
of the basal ganglia.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:11.910
So patients with Parkinson's
lose a major pathway

00:28:11.910 --> 00:28:15.130
in this system, and it results
in a very particular type

00:28:15.130 --> 00:28:16.250
of movement disorders.

00:28:16.250 --> 00:28:19.150
But let me show you what
Parkinson's patients look

00:28:19.150 --> 00:28:22.250
like when they have
full-blown movement disorders.

00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:24.590
So typically they'll
have slouched posture.

00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:26.700
They're losing postural control.

00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.820
Their hands are
closer to their sides.

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.480
And the way they walk are
short, shuffling steps.

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.690
This is a very characteristic
Parkinson's walk.

00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:39.870
That's not what we see in
the CDHD disorder at all.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:44.760
We see wide legs, stiff, arms
out as if balance problems,

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:46.850
and these kind of
lumbering walks.

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.550
That kind of movement actually
resembles a different motor

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:53.740
disorder known as
Spinocerebellar Ataxia.

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.890
So individuals with SCA,
or Spinocerebellar Ataxia,

00:28:56.890 --> 00:28:59.230
suffer from an
inability to produce

00:28:59.230 --> 00:29:01.200
smooth, coordinated actions.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.000
And it results in these kind
of lumbering movements, balance

00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.310
problems, tremors, slurred
speech, visual eye movement

00:29:08.310 --> 00:29:09.080
problems.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.270
So a host of different
movement problems.

00:29:11.270 --> 00:29:13.020
And they all resolve
around the fact

00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.360
that patients with this
disorder are suffering

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:18.630
from a degeneration of
the cerebellum itself.

00:29:18.630 --> 00:29:20.220
So the cerebellum
atrophies away,

00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.220
and it causes these
movement disorders.

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:25.090
In fact, if you want to know
just a very little bit what

00:29:25.090 --> 00:29:27.580
it's like to suffer
from this disorder,

00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:29.560
think about the last
time you were drunk.

00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.500
You had balance problems,
your slurred speech,

00:29:32.500 --> 00:29:33.920
your kind of stumbled walk.

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:36.040
Those are all
cerebellar symptoms,

00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:39.270
because the alcohol's explicitly
influencing and affecting

00:29:39.270 --> 00:29:40.410
the cerebellum.

00:29:40.410 --> 00:29:43.480
So that's what these individuals
suffer on a daily basis

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:46.340
without the euphoria of alcohol.

00:29:46.340 --> 00:29:50.470
So those kind of movements
are very, very characteristic

00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:52.400
of cerebellar damage.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:56.610
Now the cerebellum is probably
my favorite area of the brain.

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.990
It's that kind of
underappreciated

00:29:58.990 --> 00:30:01.100
in the neuroscientific
community.

00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:03.860
It contains half of the
neurons in the brain,

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:06.410
so even though the
neocortex is bigger,

00:30:06.410 --> 00:30:08.540
the cerebellum contains
half of the neurons.

00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.100
And it had a sordid history.

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:14.580
There were a ton of really
off-the-wall theories

00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.190
about what the cerebellum did.

00:30:16.190 --> 00:30:18.140
Early on, it was
thought to regulate

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.150
the fluids of the body.

00:30:20.150 --> 00:30:23.960
There was once a theory that it
was the battery of the brain,

00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:28.690
so it was just doing voltaic
battery generation in order

00:30:28.690 --> 00:30:30.300
to produce electrical impulses.

00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:32.880
But perhaps my favorite early
theory of the cerebellum

00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.850
came from the phrenologists.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:38.410
The phrenologists were
the early neuroscientists

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:40.820
who tried to map out
lumps on the head

00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:43.130
with certain personality
characteristics.

00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:45.610
And the phrenologists
thought that the cerebellum

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:47.920
is the root of the libido.

00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:49.910
They thought that
all your sexual drive

00:30:49.910 --> 00:30:52.240
came from the cerebellum.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.930
And they were scientists.

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:55.980
I like to knock
the phrenologists,

00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:58.237
but they practiced
the scientific method.

00:30:58.237 --> 00:30:59.820
And they figured
this out because they

00:30:59.820 --> 00:31:01.640
would go to French
prisons and then feel

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.390
bumps on the heads of
different criminals.

00:31:03.390 --> 00:31:05.210
And they just noticed
that criminals

00:31:05.210 --> 00:31:09.280
with chronic habitual
masturbation problems

00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.300
had larger bumps over
the back of their head

00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:12.920
by where the cerebellum was.

00:31:12.920 --> 00:31:16.050
So they thought, ah, they've
got large cerebellum,

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:18.860
so that's what's driving
these sexual impulses.

00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:20.850
And to their credit,
they actually

00:31:20.850 --> 00:31:22.440
tried an experimental
manipulation

00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.220
to see if they could
prove this theory.

00:31:25.220 --> 00:31:28.150
So in one individual,
this poor female inmate,

00:31:28.150 --> 00:31:32.340
they strapped an ice cube
to the back of her head,

00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:35.240
strapped it in, tied it
in, a giant block of ice,

00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:39.500
and noticed that this inmate
stopped touching herself

00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:41.990
when the ice cube was strapped
to the back of her head.

00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:45.560
So voila, they proved
that the cerebellum

00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:48.980
is responsible for the libido.

00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.220
So if you're like me,
you could probably

00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.240
see many different
reasons why people

00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:55.070
would stop touching themselves
with a giant block of ice

00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:56.060
strapped to the
back of their head.

00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.859
And another
individual who kind of

00:31:57.859 --> 00:31:59.650
shared this theory was
this gentleman here,

00:31:59.650 --> 00:32:00.767
Pierre Flourens.

00:32:00.767 --> 00:32:02.600
Pierre Flourens was a
classic neuroanatomist

00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:05.020
and neurophysiologist
who was really

00:32:05.020 --> 00:32:08.180
a pioneer of early neurology.

00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.730
And he thought this
was ridiculous.

00:32:09.730 --> 00:32:12.100
So I'm going to read you
a quote from an article

00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.710
about his discovery of how
the cerebellum is actually

00:32:14.710 --> 00:32:16.670
linked to motor control.

00:32:16.670 --> 00:32:19.080
"Flourens dismissed as
unfounded the claims

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.440
for the sexual function
of the cerebellum.

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:24.130
He removed the cerebellum
of a mature rooster.

00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:26.860
The animal was still deeply
interested in the hens,

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.680
but motor dysfunction
made it difficult

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.200
for him to express his
feelings towards them."

00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:33.920
I love that little
delicate ending there.

00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:37.730
So basically the
rooster was still randy,

00:32:37.730 --> 00:32:40.520
but he couldn't really
coordinate his actions

00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:42.000
to make his affections known.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.870
So this was actually
the first explicit case

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:47.840
showing that the cerebellum
was linked to motor control.

00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.560
And it didn't happen
until the mid-1800s.

00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:52.650
So since then, we've
done a lot of work

00:32:52.650 --> 00:32:54.240
characterizing how
the cerebellum is

00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.950
linked to motor control.

00:32:56.950 --> 00:33:00.030
Now, cerebellum sits
right back here in humans.

00:33:00.030 --> 00:33:01.460
And over here in
the zombie brain,

00:33:01.460 --> 00:33:03.210
you see that the
cerebellum is pretty much

00:33:03.210 --> 00:33:04.650
completely atrophied.

00:33:04.650 --> 00:33:07.260
So these kinds of
movement disorders

00:33:07.260 --> 00:33:12.900
that you see in zombies reflect
severe cerebellar dysfunction.

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:18.930
Now any zombie movie
fan in the audience

00:33:18.930 --> 00:33:21.840
is going to be a little
bit frustrated this point,

00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:23.870
because so far I've
only been talking

00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:28.180
about one very particular
subtype of the CDHD disorder

00:33:28.180 --> 00:33:30.330
known as the Slow
Zombie Subtype, right?

00:33:30.330 --> 00:33:32.350
These are the
classic early forms

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:34.090
of the disease as we saw it.

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:35.910
But more recently
another subtype

00:33:35.910 --> 00:33:38.793
has emerged, particularly
starting around 2000 to 2004,

00:33:38.793 --> 00:33:41.740
and that's the Fast
Zombie Subtype, right?

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.100
These guys don't lumber.

00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:46.770
They don't have
discoordinated actions.

00:33:46.770 --> 00:33:48.710
They can climb.

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:51.210
They can-- if you've watched
the movie "World War Z,"

00:33:51.210 --> 00:33:53.120
they can swarm.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:55.820
And these are vicious,
vicious predators out there.

00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:59.000
So we wanted to
say, OK, well, what

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:01.720
is the difference between
this guy and this guy?

00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:04.750
So Brad and I could have
flew out to England,

00:34:04.750 --> 00:34:06.426
grabbed ourselves a
set of fast zombies,

00:34:06.426 --> 00:34:08.800
brought them back to the lab,
and looked at their brains.

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.870
And if you compare the
brains of the slow zombie

00:34:10.870 --> 00:34:14.395
to the fast zombie, you see
some very interesting things.

00:34:14.395 --> 00:34:16.020
First off, you see
that the fast zombie

00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.909
has an intact cerebellum.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:22.070
So they still have this motor
coordination ability intact.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:26.830
They also have no atrophy in
the superior parietal portions

00:34:26.830 --> 00:34:27.380
of the brain.

00:34:27.380 --> 00:34:28.710
These are the brain
portions up here,

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:31.001
which means they have actually
better spatial attention

00:34:31.001 --> 00:34:31.800
as well.

00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:34.800
So there's not as
extensive brain damage

00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.360
in the fast zombie as what
you see in the slow zombie

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:40.000
variant of the CDHD disorder.

00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.679
So what drives this difference?

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:45.330
Why do we suddenly see
this different subtype

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:46.530
in the disease?

00:34:46.530 --> 00:34:48.659
Well, again, we did
extensive research.

00:34:48.659 --> 00:34:51.150
We watched a ton
of movies, and then

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:53.770
had to re-watch them
when we were sober.

00:34:53.770 --> 00:34:57.170
The one thing we
noticed time and time

00:34:57.170 --> 00:35:01.310
again was that in the
new fast zombie subtype,

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:03.950
the time between infection
and resurrection to zombie

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:05.790
became quite short.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.450
So we developed what
we call now the Time

00:35:08.450 --> 00:35:10.457
to Resurrection hypothesis.

00:35:10.457 --> 00:35:12.040
So according this
hypothesis, the time

00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:14.940
between sudden death due to
infection and resurrection,

00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:18.780
if it's short, as you see in a
fast zombie, the amount of time

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:21.510
that the brain is starved
of oxygen and glucose

00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:22.954
is relatively short.

00:35:22.954 --> 00:35:25.120
So what happens when the
brain the starved of oxygen

00:35:25.120 --> 00:35:27.290
and glucose, it
starts to die away.

00:35:27.290 --> 00:35:30.410
It induces itself into this
hypoxic state and tissue

00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:31.790
loss occurs.

00:35:31.790 --> 00:35:33.390
So if that's
relatively short, you

00:35:33.390 --> 00:35:35.860
don't get as extensive
of tissue loss.

00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:38.120
But if-- as in
the older variant,

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.380
like we saw in
"The Living Dead,"

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:43.920
it would take hours, days,
weeks, or months in order

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:45.940
to resurrect-- that's
going to lead to much more

00:35:45.940 --> 00:35:47.398
extensive damage,
because the brain

00:35:47.398 --> 00:35:50.080
is starved of those
resources for much longer.

00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:52.000
The cerebellum and
early visual areas

00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.560
are particularly
sensitive to hypoxia.

00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.360
So this would predict
that we should

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.420
see a negative correlation
between the walking

00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:01.480
speed of an undead individual
and the time at which it

00:36:01.480 --> 00:36:03.472
took them to resurrect.

00:36:03.472 --> 00:36:05.930
So this could explain why we
get the two different subtypes

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.900
of the CDHD disorder.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:09.540
All right.

00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:12.120
So what might cause CDHD?

00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.350
Well, there's lots of
potential pathogens

00:36:15.350 --> 00:36:17.220
that could cause this disorder.

00:36:17.220 --> 00:36:19.400
Viruses are known
to attack the brain.

00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.220
What you're seeing
here is an individual

00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:25.530
who had a neural infection
with the herpes simplex virus.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:27.250
So everything you
see here in white

00:36:27.250 --> 00:36:28.819
is calcified neural tissue.

00:36:28.819 --> 00:36:30.360
This is the same
virus that gives you

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.780
cold sores in your mouth,
except every once in awhile,

00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:35.596
instead of traveling
out a cranial nerve,

00:36:35.596 --> 00:36:36.720
it travels up to the brain.

00:36:36.720 --> 00:36:39.390
And it can cause extensive
damage up in, particularly,

00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:41.170
the prefrontal cortex.

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.610
But most viral damages
we know to the brain

00:36:43.610 --> 00:36:46.120
are very nonspecific
and just very global.

00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:48.400
They wouldn't lead to
a very specific pattern

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.640
of global behavioral deficit.

00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:54.380
So we don't think viruses
are what's causing the zombie

00:36:54.380 --> 00:36:57.680
brain, much to the frustration
of the producers of "28 Days

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.580
Later."

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.780
Bacteria is another potential
source of the infection.

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:04.710
This is an image of
an individual who

00:37:04.710 --> 00:37:07.740
had meningitis, which is
a bacterial infection.

00:37:07.740 --> 00:37:11.240
And you see that meningitis
ate away basically the lower

00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.860
quarter of this
individual's brain.

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:16.040
It's a massive
infectious disease.

00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:19.180
And the damage that it does
is, again, very nonspecific.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:22.800
So while viruses and bacteria
know to influence the brain,

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:26.290
they don't lead to these
coordinated, specific regional

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:29.400
changes in brain tissue.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:32.280
Another potential
candidate is prions.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.700
So prions are little
forms a protein

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:40.010
that can unfold the cellular
structure of, basically,

00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:41.950
all cell types,
particularly neurons.

00:37:41.950 --> 00:37:43.900
And so this is a brain
image of an individual

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.860
with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease.

00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.640
Everything in white, again,
is areas of calcified tissue

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.490
that have been damaged.

00:37:50.490 --> 00:37:52.950
And again, prions
are nonspecific.

00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:55.580
Now, I apologize if you
don't sleep tonight,

00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.230
but another potential
candidate is brain worms.

00:37:58.230 --> 00:38:00.820
Yes, brain worms are real.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.660
This is a syndrome known
as neurocysticercosis.

00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:07.330
And these arrows pointing
to these little sacks here,

00:38:07.330 --> 00:38:09.570
can you guess what's
in the little sacks?

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:10.180
Yes.

00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:13.380
A little tapeworm that
buries itself in the brain

00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.410
and siphons off nutrients
from your blood supply.

00:38:16.410 --> 00:38:20.502
And this happens from eating
fecal-contaminated foods.

00:38:20.502 --> 00:38:21.960
And we actually
think it's probably

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:24.770
epidemic in third
world countries.

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.874
But normally these brain
worms don't do any harm.

00:38:27.874 --> 00:38:29.540
They just take up a
little bit of space.

00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.290
They siphon off a
little bit of resources.

00:38:31.290 --> 00:38:33.420
But they don't cause
big behavioral problems,

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:36.090
until you have,
as I tell you now,

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.780
one patient had three
dozen worms in his head.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:41.546
He started showing
behavioral symptoms,

00:38:41.546 --> 00:38:43.170
but that was because
his head basically

00:38:43.170 --> 00:38:46.090
turned into Swiss cheese.

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:49.540
So we can imagine a case where
maybe a subtype of these worms

00:38:49.540 --> 00:38:52.530
is forming a chemical
interaction with the brain

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:56.080
and leading to these slow
specific behavioral changes.

00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:00.190
Another hypothesis that was
put out in the literature is--

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.190
if anybody's seen the
movie "The Signal"--

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:06.700
that TV and radio transmissions
can emit a particular EM

00:39:06.700 --> 00:39:09.700
frequency that causes the neuron
activity patterns to change

00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:10.697
fundamentally.

00:39:10.697 --> 00:39:12.530
And we know that you
can actually kill cells

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:14.480
by letting them just fire a lot.

00:39:14.480 --> 00:39:17.370
So you can see coordinated
brain damage, which we sometimes

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:21.750
call excitotoxicity, induced
by particular stimulus inputs.

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:26.240
And again, this is the premise
for the movie "The Signal."

00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:28.550
And I first thought that
was silly, until I saw this.

00:39:28.550 --> 00:39:32.340
[MUSIC - RICK ASTLEY, "NEVER
 GONNA GIVE YOU UP"]

00:39:36.840 --> 00:39:38.550
So I don't know
about you, but that

00:39:38.550 --> 00:39:39.870
makes me want to kill somebody.

00:39:39.870 --> 00:39:42.770
So I'm going to go
with the Rick Astley

00:39:42.770 --> 00:39:46.170
theory of the CDHD disorder.

00:39:46.170 --> 00:39:46.880
All right.

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.420
So, so far I've
shown how you can

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:53.850
look at this silly pop
culture supernatural

00:39:53.850 --> 00:39:57.960
entity, this little zombie
here, characterize it

00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:02.510
in a very rigorous way, in
a scientific manner, where

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:04.970
we can link up specific
behavioral traits to the brain

00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:09.310
and use real science to kind
of explain a relatively silly,

00:40:09.310 --> 00:40:12.310
supernatural organism
like the zombie.

00:40:12.310 --> 00:40:13.960
So this really
shows the potential

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.930
of trying to kind of
push this scientific idea

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:18.810
into popular culture
in order to educate

00:40:18.810 --> 00:40:21.140
real scientific principles
and the general public.

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.640
So in a way, what
we're trying to do

00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:26.110
is keep building this bridge
between popular culture

00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:28.660
and science, and get these
to interplay more in order

00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:31.770
to facilitate greater
scientific education.

00:40:31.770 --> 00:40:35.430
So if you want to know more,
you can obviously read our book,

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:37.620
"Do Zombies Dream
of Undead Sheep?"

00:40:37.620 --> 00:40:40.320
We also have a set of
animated videos released

00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:42.080
through the Ted Ed Foundation.

00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:44.760
They are great supporters
of science outreach.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:46.930
I love the Ted Ed Foundation.

00:40:46.930 --> 00:40:49.380
So we have two videos up about
how to diagnose the zombie

00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:52.070
brain, and some fallacies
in using your imaging

00:40:52.070 --> 00:40:55.121
to explain brain
behavior relationships.

00:40:55.121 --> 00:40:56.495
We also have a
set of colleagues,

00:40:56.495 --> 00:40:58.840
a collective in the
Zombie Research Society.

00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.710
This is a bunch of
academics who use zombies

00:41:01.710 --> 00:41:03.114
to teach their particular field.

00:41:03.114 --> 00:41:05.280
Actually, two members of
the Zombie Research Society

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:07.550
are here in Boston
and Cambridge.

00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:13.300
Dan Dresner teaches the
politics and political science

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:15.930
of zombies, and
he's over at Tufts.

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:20.460
And Steve Schlozman is at
MGH, and he's a psychiatrist,

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.420
and he does these
psychiatry of zombies.

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.310
And he actually published a
novel on the zombie disorder

00:41:26.310 --> 00:41:29.270
as a psychiatric condition,
which is really fun.

00:41:29.270 --> 00:41:32.009
So if you're not interested in
neuroscience, but other fields,

00:41:32.009 --> 00:41:34.300
check out the people who are
associated with the Zombie

00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:36.850
Research Society because
they do great work like this.

00:41:36.850 --> 00:41:38.714
So thank you guys.

00:41:38.714 --> 00:41:45.140
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:46.930
Questions.

00:41:46.930 --> 00:41:48.300
Yeah.

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.110
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about popular zombie movies

00:41:51.110 --> 00:41:54.400
and TV shows, where you see
them as truly scientifically

00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:58.670
inaccurate, either in general
or in specific important scenes.

00:41:58.670 --> 00:42:00.270
TIM VERSTYNEN:
Actually, I would say

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:04.860
99% of the zombies
seen in TVs and movies

00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:09.240
are so unrealistic as
to make them impossible.

00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:12.560
There are a few exceptions.

00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.120
There is a video game,
"The Last of Us,"

00:42:15.120 --> 00:42:18.810
in which a evolution of
the cordyceps fungus, which

00:42:18.810 --> 00:42:23.470
actually induces zombieism
in ants-- really, it does--

00:42:23.470 --> 00:42:26.416
somehow mutates and causes the
same thing to happen in humans,

00:42:26.416 --> 00:42:28.040
so you see these
zombies running around

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.350
with giant fungi
attached to their heads.

00:42:30.350 --> 00:42:33.287
And that is one that
I thought was actually

00:42:33.287 --> 00:42:35.620
a fairly realistic one, because
they're also not undead.

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:38.140
You could easily kill them.

00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:40.740
And then the most
realistic representation

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:45.480
of zombies that I would say
had the biological plausibility

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:48.200
were the zombies in the "28
Days Later" and "28 Weeks Later"

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:49.092
movies.

00:42:49.092 --> 00:42:50.800
And for those of you
who haven't seen it,

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:53.989
the premise of the movie is
that scientists in Oxford

00:42:53.989 --> 00:42:56.530
are trying to understand rage,
and they develop a virus known

00:42:56.530 --> 00:43:00.094
as the rage virus, which
plays with the aggression

00:43:00.094 --> 00:43:01.010
circuits in the brain.

00:43:01.010 --> 00:43:04.080
And it gets loose in the
general public, and what happens

00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.850
is people just become really
just ravenously aggressive.

00:43:08.850 --> 00:43:10.050
They're not undead.

00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:12.699
In fact, the premise is that 28
days later means that they're

00:43:12.699 --> 00:43:14.240
not thinking about
eating, so they're

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.120
going to starve to
death in 28 days.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:19.810
And so you can ideally wait
out the zombie apocalypse

00:43:19.810 --> 00:43:21.790
just by letting them
starve to death.

00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:23.540
So I thought that
probably "28 Days Later"

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:25.440
was the most biologically
plausible one.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:28.120
But even then the behavioral
patterns and the transmission

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.560
rates were nowhere
near plausible.

00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.670
The scene that
frustrated me the most

00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:35.880
was the last-- at the
end of "The Walking Dead"

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:37.770
first season, when
they were in the CDC

00:43:37.770 --> 00:43:40.410
and there was this biologically
plausible explanation

00:43:40.410 --> 00:43:42.030
of the neuroscience of zombies.

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:45.650
Was so bad that it made me cry.

00:43:45.650 --> 00:43:46.400
Yeah.

00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.191
AUDIENCE: So speaking
of realistic zombies,

00:43:48.191 --> 00:43:53.830
there's this notion
of the voodoo zombies

00:43:53.830 --> 00:43:58.840
and being controlled by
drugs on mutations and stuff.

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:03.667
I'm just curious how
that plays into--

00:44:03.667 --> 00:44:04.500
TIM VERSTYNEN: Yeah.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:07.180
So that's actually another
little side tangent of mine,

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:11.630
because the zombieism that you
see in Haitian voodoo culture

00:44:11.630 --> 00:44:15.180
is quite interesting
in that it has

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:18.390
a proposed neuropharmacological
explanation.

00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:21.070
So there's a classic
book by Wade Davis, who

00:44:21.070 --> 00:44:24.210
was an ethnobotanist,
who went down to Haiti

00:44:24.210 --> 00:44:27.610
and made two particular
pharmacological links

00:44:27.610 --> 00:44:28.970
to Haitian zombieism.

00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:32.290
One was tetrodotoxin,
which was the poison used

00:44:32.290 --> 00:44:33.720
to simulate death.

00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:36.700
And tetrodotoxin works by
blocking the sodium channels

00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:39.830
that allow neurons to fire in
the peripheral nervous system.

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:42.350
So your muscles
become paralyzed.

00:44:42.350 --> 00:44:46.150
And it actually won't kill
you unless your diaphragm

00:44:46.150 --> 00:44:47.440
stops working.

00:44:47.440 --> 00:44:49.707
So basically it kills you
because the diaphragm muscle

00:44:49.707 --> 00:44:50.290
stops working.

00:44:50.290 --> 00:44:53.190
But if you get a low
enough dose, what'll happen

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:56.470
is that your diaphragm will
keep moving so slowly that you

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:57.650
can't really detect it.

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:00.060
But in all intents and
purposes you look dead.

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:01.310
So that's the simulated death.

00:45:01.310 --> 00:45:03.570
And then the control
aspects, he proposed

00:45:03.570 --> 00:45:11.620
that the bokors, who are kind of
the bad or evil voodoo priests,

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:15.120
would dose the individual after
the tetrodotoxin had worn off--

00:45:15.120 --> 00:45:16.670
when they dug them
out of their grave

00:45:16.670 --> 00:45:21.010
that they were buried alive in--
would douse them with Datura,

00:45:21.010 --> 00:45:23.010
which has three
major psychoactive

00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:26.850
ingredients, hyoscopine,
scopalamine, and atropine,

00:45:26.850 --> 00:45:27.800
I think.

00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:31.100
Each one of those will
induce a psychotic state.

00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:33.580
And so the idea is that you
can make this person who is now

00:45:33.580 --> 00:45:37.314
convinced that he's dead--
because he saw himself dead,

00:45:37.314 --> 00:45:39.730
he was well aware of everything
that was happening to him,

00:45:39.730 --> 00:45:41.960
felt buried-- and
then he gets raised

00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.000
and then there's a
psychoactive chemical

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.489
that keeps him compliant.

00:45:45.489 --> 00:45:46.780
That was the Wade Davis theory.

00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:48.738
It's controversial, hasn't
been replicated yet.

00:45:48.738 --> 00:45:51.570
And people are saying that
there's probably other aspects

00:45:51.570 --> 00:45:54.480
to it that link more to
psychological belief.

00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:56.180
But yeah, the
Haitian voodoo zombie

00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:59.020
kind of links to neurobiology,
quite interesting that way.

00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:03.370
Yeah.

00:46:03.370 --> 00:46:05.210
AUDIENCE: Two questions.

00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:08.650
So one was what
causes zombieism.

00:46:08.650 --> 00:46:14.540
So in some forms of movies, it's
kind of like a venomous thing,

00:46:14.540 --> 00:46:17.050
that if you're bitten, you're
infected, and you get it.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:18.840
In other more recent
ones, it's everyone's

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:21.680
infected, when you
die, you're a zombie.

00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.520
They're really
different outcomes.

00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:26.420
I don't know if you had any
thoughts about that difference.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:29.087
TIM VERSTYNEN: Yeah, I--
the, we're all infected

00:46:29.087 --> 00:46:31.170
and we're just going to
reanimate when we're-- you

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:34.340
know, whenever we kind of
transition from one state.

00:46:34.340 --> 00:46:37.080
Romero was-- so we actually
got to interview George Romero

00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:38.413
and we were asking him about it.

00:46:38.413 --> 00:46:41.050
And he said the way he made it,
particularly in his first three

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:43.722
movies, he didn't care about it.

00:46:43.722 --> 00:46:45.680
He was trying to use the
zombies as a metaphor.

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:47.840
So in the first one, he
kept it vague, right?

00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.904
There was the satellite from
outer space that had come back,

00:46:52.904 --> 00:46:54.320
and it was somehow
linked to that.

00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.087
But it could've been
space radiation.

00:46:56.087 --> 00:46:57.670
And he was saying
he explicitly didn't

00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:00.090
care about what caused it.

00:47:00.090 --> 00:47:02.430
He just wanted them to be there.

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:06.894
In fact, he put the nail
in our coffin of our theory

00:47:06.894 --> 00:47:07.810
about zombie movement.

00:47:07.810 --> 00:47:08.310
Them.

00:47:08.310 --> 00:47:10.980
But I'll tell you
about that later.

00:47:10.980 --> 00:47:13.350
So I think what happened
was because the early zombie

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:15.350
cultures didn't really
care about the mechanism,

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:17.760
there were just lots of
different explanations.

00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:19.440
From a biological
standpoint it doesn't

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:21.060
seem like that
would be the case.

00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:24.290
There is one-- so
I like the idea

00:47:24.290 --> 00:47:27.460
of the infection
theory of zombieism.

00:47:27.460 --> 00:47:28.820
AUDIENCE: Like [? latents. ?]

00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:30.090
TIM VERSTYNEN: Yeah.

00:47:30.090 --> 00:47:33.840
The real phenomenon that I think
fascinates me the most in this

00:47:33.840 --> 00:47:35.930
is toxoplasmosis.

00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:38.120
So toxoplasmosis is a
single-cell organism.

00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.020
It's what lives in cat poop.

00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.640
And it's why pregnant
women shouldn't

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:44.230
be around cat poop
is because it induces

00:47:44.230 --> 00:47:47.080
flu-like symptoms if
you get the infection.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.770
And it can be dangerous to
fetuses and young children.

00:47:50.770 --> 00:47:53.070
But normally, if you're
an adult and you get it,

00:47:53.070 --> 00:47:54.920
you just get a flu and
it seems to go away.

00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:58.490
But really what happens is it's
a single-cell organism that

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:01.945
reproduces sexually in the
gut of a feline, right,

00:48:01.945 --> 00:48:04.070
so that's where it gets
its most genetic diversity.

00:48:04.070 --> 00:48:07.990
When it's outside the feline,
it can only reproduce asexually,

00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:09.670
so it clones itself.

00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:12.235
So what this organism does
is, even after the infection,

00:48:12.235 --> 00:48:14.520
it stays latent in your system.

00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:20.070
And in the mammals that it
infects-- rodents, humans--

00:48:20.070 --> 00:48:24.470
it actually starts modifying
the neuropharmacology

00:48:24.470 --> 00:48:26.100
of the individual's brain.

00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:29.080
And what you see is, you see
characteristic behavioral

00:48:29.080 --> 00:48:33.290
differences in people who have
had toxoplasmosis and survive

00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:34.900
versus those who don't.

00:48:34.900 --> 00:48:36.660
And the most
classic case of this

00:48:36.660 --> 00:48:38.180
was an experimental
study where they

00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:41.000
took a rat-- and rats
normally hate cats,

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:43.216
they're instinctively
afraid of cats-- gave it

00:48:43.216 --> 00:48:46.880
a toxoplasmosis intervention,
and across time,

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:50.090
if you had a glass wall
between the rat and the cat,

00:48:50.090 --> 00:48:52.180
normally the rat's over here.

00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:54.290
But as the infection
rate occurs,

00:48:54.290 --> 00:48:55.930
the rat actually
starts to not only

00:48:55.930 --> 00:48:59.080
not be afraid, but want
to be near the cat.

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:02.140
So there's increased
risk-taking behavior

00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:04.110
that happens as a
result of the infection.

00:49:04.110 --> 00:49:06.340
And actually, that same
kind of behavior-- not

00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:08.780
towards cats, obviously, but
more risk-taking behavior

00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:11.520
is seen in human individuals
who've had the infection.

00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.620
So somehow, the
single-cell organism

00:49:13.620 --> 00:49:15.690
is hijacking the
complex circuits

00:49:15.690 --> 00:49:19.060
that induce our ability to
be afraid of certain things

00:49:19.060 --> 00:49:20.640
and increase risk taking.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:23.290
So that, coupled with the
kind of popularization

00:49:23.290 --> 00:49:24.820
of the infection
theory of zombies,

00:49:24.820 --> 00:49:26.880
I think, is the more
interesting link there.

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:29.860
And if you were going to ask
me about biologically possible,

00:49:29.860 --> 00:49:33.222
with the caveat that it's still
way, way far away, that, I

00:49:33.222 --> 00:49:35.430
think, is more the route
that you would see something

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.929
like this.

00:49:35.929 --> 00:49:37.456
AUDIENCE: This is
more than the rat

00:49:37.456 --> 00:49:38.955
simply becoming
acclimated to having

00:49:38.955 --> 00:49:39.980
a cat on the other
side of a glass wall.

00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:40.400
TIM VERSTYNEN: Yeah.

00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.050
So you don't see
it all in rats that

00:49:42.050 --> 00:49:43.591
have never been
exposed to the virus.

00:49:43.591 --> 00:49:46.230
They stay far away.

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:47.000
Yeah.

00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.400
AUDIENCE: Another question
I had for you, quickly.

00:49:49.400 --> 00:49:56.000
So you talked about the amygdala
and rage and anger, aggression.

00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:58.420
There's also-- I've heard of
Kluver-Bucy syndrome, which

00:49:58.420 --> 00:50:00.837
is behind controlled appetite.

00:50:00.837 --> 00:50:03.170
You didn't talk much about
why the appetite side of rage

00:50:03.170 --> 00:50:04.837
can be all sorts of
aggressive behavior.

00:50:04.837 --> 00:50:05.670
TIM VERSTYNEN: Yeah.

00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:08.150
So Kluver-Bucy syndrome is
a rare neurological disorder

00:50:08.150 --> 00:50:09.691
that happens-- it
can only occur when

00:50:09.691 --> 00:50:11.620
you get both amygdala damaged.

00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:16.710
And they exhibit
hyperorality, hypersexuality,

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:19.920
and it's a very odd
characteristic feature.

00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.170
So you caught a
hole in our theory,

00:50:22.170 --> 00:50:25.090
because according to
our theory, zombies

00:50:25.090 --> 00:50:27.230
should be hyperoral,
hypersexual.

00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:29.010
They should also
be hyperfearful,

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:33.440
because the amygdala actually
controls fight and flight.

00:50:33.440 --> 00:50:35.650
So what it's doing is,
if you leave it intact,

00:50:35.650 --> 00:50:39.130
zombies should be just as
easily spooked as pissed off.

00:50:39.130 --> 00:50:42.950
So you did catch the
hole in the theory.

00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:43.840
Right, right, right.

00:50:47.830 --> 00:50:48.330
All right.

00:50:48.330 --> 00:50:49.121
Any more questions?

00:50:49.121 --> 00:50:50.550
OK, go ahead.

00:50:50.550 --> 00:50:55.110
AUDIENCE: So there was this
CDC blog post awhile ago about

00:50:55.110 --> 00:50:59.380
what to do in the event
of a zombie outbreak.

00:50:59.380 --> 00:51:01.260
Do you have any
critiques of that?

00:51:01.260 --> 00:51:02.250
Did they do a good job?

00:51:02.250 --> 00:51:03.020
TIM VERSTYNEN: I loved that.

00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.978
I thought they did a
great job, because really,

00:51:04.978 --> 00:51:07.480
what they were doing is epidemic
preparedness and emergency

00:51:07.480 --> 00:51:11.070
preparedness, but just
couched in zombies.

00:51:11.070 --> 00:51:12.950
I mean, it got
people's attention.

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:14.717
It got people excited
about doing it.

00:51:14.717 --> 00:51:16.300
Instead of just
doing, OK, we're going

00:51:16.300 --> 00:51:18.870
to pretend that there's
a SARS virus out.

00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:21.230
People kind of habituate
to these things.

00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:23.600
But if you do it tongue in
cheek, people got engaged,

00:51:23.600 --> 00:51:25.770
and it got a lot
of-- I think it got

00:51:25.770 --> 00:51:27.490
a lot more people
interested and thinking

00:51:27.490 --> 00:51:31.200
about preparedness for
epidemics and emergencies

00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:33.270
than if they had just
done anything else,

00:51:33.270 --> 00:51:36.770
except for maybe now they could
probably do it with ebola.

00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:39.480
But otherwise, yeah, I
thought it was a great idea.

00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:42.310
And I like seeing agencies
do that tongue-in-cheekness

00:51:42.310 --> 00:51:45.535
to kind of engage
awareness and attention.

00:51:45.535 --> 00:51:46.910
Did you still have
your question?

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:47.320
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:49.028
Just real quick, First
of all, thank you.

00:51:49.028 --> 00:51:49.800
Super helpful.

00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.650
I added more cardio into my life
after I watched "Zombieland,"

00:51:52.650 --> 00:51:54.030
so I'm more prepared.

00:51:54.030 --> 00:51:57.280
The second was, do you and your
friends at The Zombie Research

00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:00.050
Society plan on doing research
into other parts of the zombie

00:52:00.050 --> 00:52:02.010
body, so beyond the brain?

00:52:02.010 --> 00:52:07.620
TIM VERSTYNEN: Yeah,
so we did a Reddit AMA.

00:52:07.620 --> 00:52:09.910
And one of the questions
was about the gut system.

00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:15.880
And I think the next
avenue of zombie science

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.620
is zombie internal medicine.

00:52:17.620 --> 00:52:20.320
Because how do zombies
get their nutrients

00:52:20.320 --> 00:52:23.040
when you've got your entrails
dragging on the ground?

00:52:23.040 --> 00:52:25.910
I think that's a
fascinating question.

00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:30.040
So I think that getting
people interested in talking

00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:32.410
about digestive systems
and poop is normally not

00:52:32.410 --> 00:52:36.000
that interesting, but couched in
zombies, it can be interesting.

00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.200
Same with, I think, cardiac
systems and blood systems

00:52:40.200 --> 00:52:41.280
from a biological angle.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.260
I think there's lots
on the biological side

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:45.382
that you could explore
on the zombie body,

00:52:45.382 --> 00:52:47.840
because their physiology-- how
do you explain how you could

00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:51.970
have somebody that's got thick,
viscous blood, but somehow

00:52:51.970 --> 00:52:54.490
still manages to be animated?

00:52:54.490 --> 00:52:55.990
So yeah, I think
that would be a fun

00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:57.740
avenue on the biological side.

00:52:57.740 --> 00:52:59.830
And of course, on
the social side,

00:52:59.830 --> 00:53:03.330
you can use zombies to
explain anything, right?

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:09.690
Different hierarchical
societies, zombie cognitive

00:53:09.690 --> 00:53:12.494
phenomenon, I think, would
be really interesting.

00:53:12.494 --> 00:53:14.160
So I don't really
think there's anything

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:16.794
you can't do with zombies just
because they keep changing.

00:53:16.794 --> 00:53:18.460
They're not like
vampires or werewolves,

00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:21.130
which have a very
static structure.

00:53:21.130 --> 00:53:23.270
Zombies keep changing with
time, so you can always

00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:25.080
find an example of a
zombie doing something

00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:28.929
that you want to study.

00:53:28.929 --> 00:53:31.220
But yeah, I'm waiting for
the zombie internal medicine.

00:53:34.570 --> 00:53:37.100
AUDIENCE: So one connection
that you didn't touch on

00:53:37.100 --> 00:53:40.004
is between rabies and zombieism.

00:53:40.004 --> 00:53:41.420
I've heard people
talk about that.

00:53:41.420 --> 00:53:44.265
Any comments on whether rabies
would be, or a form of rabies

00:53:44.265 --> 00:53:45.140
would be [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:45.140 --> 00:53:46.780
TIM VERSTYNEN: So
the longer version

00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.982
of the talk we actually
go over this, because when

00:53:49.982 --> 00:53:52.190
we go over the memory systems
and the impulse control

00:53:52.190 --> 00:53:56.770
systems, those are all linked up
to a system known as the Papez

00:53:56.770 --> 00:53:57.620
circuit.

00:53:57.620 --> 00:53:59.570
That's a classic
neurological circuit

00:53:59.570 --> 00:54:02.500
that was discovered
in the 1930s.

00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.280
It was discovered
using the rabies virus.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:07.462
And so what this guy,
James Papez would do is,

00:54:07.462 --> 00:54:09.920
he was trying to find a link
between emotion and intention.

00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:12.964
How is it that we can't remember
what we did at the store

00:54:12.964 --> 00:54:14.380
yesterday, but
everybody remembers

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:15.671
where they were at 9/11, right?

00:54:15.671 --> 00:54:19.280
How do we have these emotional
bondings of memories?

00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.940
And so he mapped out
this theoretical circuit,

00:54:21.940 --> 00:54:24.620
and then would map it out in
cats by injecting the rabies

00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.930
virus and watching the
virus propagate from one

00:54:26.930 --> 00:54:28.740
area to the next, look
for the connections.

00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:32.530
And he actually made cats
that had memory problems,

00:54:32.530 --> 00:54:34.620
they were hyperaggressive.

00:54:34.620 --> 00:54:36.590
So we do a tongue-in-cheek
thing saying

00:54:36.590 --> 00:54:40.030
that James Papez made
the first zombie cats.

00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:44.790
But the rabies virus is a very
specific type of infection,

00:54:44.790 --> 00:54:47.260
and it's very general.

00:54:47.260 --> 00:54:51.430
So what it does is, it kind
of attacks a particular cell,

00:54:51.430 --> 00:54:53.710
jumps across what's
under the synapse, which

00:54:53.710 --> 00:54:56.340
is the gap between
cells, and keeps

00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:57.830
propagating down
to the next cell.

00:54:57.830 --> 00:54:58.870
And it just wanders.

00:54:58.870 --> 00:55:01.290
It just kind of follows
from place to place.

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:04.220
So if you get an infection in
one part of the brain, where

00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:06.490
it goes is determined by
who it's connected with.

00:55:06.490 --> 00:55:08.780
And it'll keep traveling
until it basically

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:11.190
kills the organism.

00:55:11.190 --> 00:55:13.250
Now normally you
get some symptoms

00:55:13.250 --> 00:55:16.560
like cognitive disorders.

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.200
You'll get delusions and
dementia with rabies infection.

00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:24.260
You get hydraphobia,
so individuals

00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:26.782
infected with rabies virus
will be afraid of water.

00:55:26.782 --> 00:55:27.490
They won't drink.

00:55:27.490 --> 00:55:29.250
They become dehydrated.

00:55:29.250 --> 00:55:33.960
And some of those are
explained by the virus

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.480
doesn't survive well when
there's lots of brain swelling,

00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:39.350
so it automatically
dehydrates you

00:55:39.350 --> 00:55:41.820
to keep that brain
swelling down.

00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:43.560
Things like that
have been put forth

00:55:43.560 --> 00:55:45.750
as explanations for
those kind of behaviors.

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:47.291
But I think a lot
of them just happen

00:55:47.291 --> 00:55:49.780
to be, people show those
when the virus has spread

00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:52.900
so far throughout the brain
as to basically wipe away

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:54.470
most of the neocortex.

00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:57.730
And so it's nonspecific in the
sense of where it's attacking,

00:55:57.730 --> 00:55:59.980
but we really start to see
the symptoms once it's just

00:55:59.980 --> 00:56:03.410
so widespread as
to be catastrophic.

00:56:03.410 --> 00:56:06.450
So yeah, the rabies
virus has been

00:56:06.450 --> 00:56:10.200
linked to zombies more times
than, I think, anything else.

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.200
So the book "World War Z,"
the first name for the virus

00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.370
was African Rabies
because they first

00:56:15.370 --> 00:56:16.984
talked about it in South Africa.

00:56:16.984 --> 00:56:19.400
And there's been a lot of
movies that talk tongue-in-cheek

00:56:19.400 --> 00:56:22.760
about a rabies-like infection.

00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:24.890
So I think that's
just because more

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:27.660
of the kind of hyperaggressive
impulsive responses.

00:56:27.660 --> 00:56:31.450
But we don't really see
how that's occurring yet

00:56:31.450 --> 00:56:33.280
until you get to this
catastrophic stage.

00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:34.669
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:37.910 --> 00:56:39.320
TIM VERSTYNEN: Yeah.

00:56:39.320 --> 00:56:39.820
Right.

00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:40.510
Oh, that's true.

00:56:40.510 --> 00:56:40.870
That's true.

00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:41.369
Yeah.

00:56:41.369 --> 00:56:45.230
So that's a good kind of
infectious disease that way,

00:56:45.230 --> 00:56:46.201
to use the metaphor.

00:56:46.201 --> 00:56:46.700
Yeah.

00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:50.480
All right?

00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.030
Any other questions?

00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:52.020
Thank you guys very much.

00:56:52.020 --> 00:56:53.145
Thanks for inviting me out.

00:56:53.145 --> 00:56:54.650
Happy Halloween.
