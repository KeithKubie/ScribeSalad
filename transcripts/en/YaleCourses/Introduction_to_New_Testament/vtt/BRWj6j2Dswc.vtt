1
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.600
We've reviewed several times already,

2
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.070
at least some of the stuff for your paper this week.

3
00:00:08.071 --> 00:00:10.330
If you're writing a paper on,
um,

4
00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.670
Judaism and the law in early Christianity,
different varieties,

5
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.910
if you'll remember,
and I've heard I've reviewed this several times,

6
00:00:18.911 --> 00:00:21.230
so this is just really briefly,
but domain,

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.290
one of the main themes of the whole course is the diversity of early

8
00:00:25.291 --> 00:00:29.400
Christianity.
How many different times of early Christianity's there were.

9
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.300
And one of the important things is always to look at that is what were their

10
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:36.780
different views of the law.
So of course with Matthew,
as we've seen,

11
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.640
Matthew treats the law,

12
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.440
the Jewish law as something that apparently he considers his the followers of

13
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:46.290
his own church,
uh,
to continue to keep.

14
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:50.810
There's no hint in Matthew that the law would be abrogated.
Uh,

15
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.080
it's interpreted of course.

16
00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.280
So some of the aspects of the sabbath observance Jesus interprets differently in

17
00:00:56.281 --> 00:01:00.750
Matthew then do say the Pharisees in Matthew or the scribes and Matthew are

18
00:01:00.751 --> 00:01:02.310
other Jews.
So,

19
00:01:02.311 --> 00:01:06.390
but Matthew's tends to give us the idea that the law is just there to be

20
00:01:06.391 --> 00:01:09.030
observed by everybody.
When we got to Luke acts,

21
00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.000
we saw that the NOAA hide laws,

22
00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:16.920
that is the laws given after the flood to Noah,
which are only,
uh,
four of them,

23
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:21.030
right?
You don't eat things that are strangled.
You don't eat blood ya,

24
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.160
you don't eat.
You don't sacrifice idols.

25
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.790
An idol meat and I can't work.
One of them was,

26
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:31.350
but there are certain laws that the Jews considered were given to Noah after the

27
00:01:31.351 --> 00:01:36.210
flood and that all peoples,
even gentiles were expected to follow those rules.

28
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.270
But the Jews didn't expect gentiles to keep other peculiarly Jewish laws.

29
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.810
Jews never expected gentiles not to eat pork,
to keep the sabbath,

30
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:46.950
to circumcise their children,

31
00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.010
and they never thought there was anything wrong with gentiles doing those
things.

32
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.770
Of course,
that's one of the things that separated them from the Jews.

33
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.420
Luke acts seems to take that kind of view of the law,
that the law is an ethnic,

34
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.270
the ethnic customs of the Jews,

35
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.690
similar to the ways that the Romans would have their own laws and customs.

36
00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.910
The Greeks would have their own laws and customs.

37
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.730
The Egyptians who have their laws and customs,
the Babylonians,

38
00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.500
the Persians would have their laws and customs.

39
00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.090
So that seems to be the way the Jewish laws treated.
Uh,
in Luke and acts,

40
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.150
Paul,
we've talked about Paul in Romans and Galatians.

41
00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.610
He has a much more radical teaching about the law that the law is.
Uh,

42
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.840
Paul never says that Jewish followers of Jesus,
uh,
shouldn't keep the law,
uh,

43
00:02:27.841 --> 00:02:32.841
but he certainly discourages in fucking forbids gentile converts to keep the

44
00:02:33.841 --> 00:02:36.450
law.
He in Galatians,
he says,
you,

45
00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:40.050
who would be justified by the law that you've cut out,
you're cut off from grace.

46
00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:44.130
So Paul has a much more radical position and we could look at others.
You talked,

47
00:02:44.131 --> 00:02:48.270
we talked about Marcien member Marcien from the very beginning of the course,

48
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.490
the guy who,
uh,
in the second century in Rome,

49
00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.420
he taught a version of Christianity in which he only had recognized the gospel

50
00:02:57.421 --> 00:02:59.800
of Luke and just the letters of as his,

51
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:02.140
he was the first one to come up with a canon list,
we think.

52
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:05.850
And then he edited those to wear anything positive about,
uh,

53
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.400
the Jewish law or the God of the Jews,
uh,

54
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.580
was taken out because he believed that was a junior false bad god and not the

55
00:03:12.581 --> 00:03:16.870
father of Jesus Christ.
So Marcian throughout the whole Hebrew Bible,

56
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.540
the scriptures of Jews entirely and substituted for Jewish scripture,
uh,

57
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.300
his own edited version of Luke and the golf and the letters of Paul.

58
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.320
So all of these are different ways that early Christians talked about what to do

59
00:03:29.321 --> 00:03:30.154
about the law.

60
00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.360
We'll get to some of that again in James Today because we can,

61
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.100
you can read James as Luther and some other people read it as being basically a

62
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:41.440
disagreement with Pauline Christianity.

63
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.280
We'll talk about whether that's a good reading of James or not,
but quite often,

64
00:03:45.281 --> 00:03:47.800
especially in Protestant Christianity,

65
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.240
James has been read to be arguing against Paul's law,

66
00:03:52.241 --> 00:03:56.890
Free Gospel or justification by faith,
by grace,
through faith alone.

67
00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.520
Before we get to James,

68
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:03.340
I want to highlight one other aspect that we've talked about a bit,

69
00:04:03.341 --> 00:04:07.720
but I want to review it again as another illustration of the diversities of

70
00:04:07.721 --> 00:04:11.680
early Christianity.
And this is our wonderful favorite topic.

71
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.850
Christologies we've talked about Chris.
Dot.
Different Christologies all along.

72
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:17.620
We've looked at everyone's in John and that sort of thing,

73
00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.300
but let's just look at a few texts and read them together.
First,
look at Luke.

74
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.551
Of course,

75
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:27.750
Christology Christologies you recall is what do you believe about Christ?

76
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.020
What kind of nature is Jesus Christ or was Jesus Christ?

77
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:34.840
Luke three 22.

78
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:38.563
<v 1>Okay.</v>

79
00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.140
<v 0>The Holy Spirit descended upon Jesus in bodily form like a dove and a voice came</v>

80
00:04:47.181 --> 00:04:51.530
from heaven.
You are my son,
the beloved with whom?
With you.

81
00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:56.000
I am well pleased.
Now if you notice,
that's a quotation from the song.

82
00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.930
You can see it down in your footnotes.
If you have a study Bible,
Psalm two,

83
00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:01.430
seven and also at sites.

84
00:05:01.431 --> 00:05:06.431
Isaiah 42 one if you also know there are some little words,

85
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:10.640
um,
a little numbers that have footnotes.
Probably if you,

86
00:05:10.641 --> 00:05:14.720
it's certainly in the new revised standard version.
The letter footnote numbers.

87
00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.880
There's one that says other ancient authorities read.
You are my son today.

88
00:05:19.881 --> 00:05:23.210
I have been gotten you.
I've talked about this already in the class.

89
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.660
Now the the debate among scholars would be was today I have the gotten you

90
00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.630
originally in Luke's Gospel and then some scribe took it out because we do find

91
00:05:35.841 --> 00:05:40.841
it in some Greek manuscripts or was it not there originally in Luke's Gospel and

92
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.890
other scribes put it in.

93
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.433
<v 1>Okay,</v>

94
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:45.643
<v 0>nice question.</v>

95
00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:50.420
Did the original gospel of Luke have today I had the gotten you said by the

96
00:05:50.421 --> 00:05:54.020
voice from heaven at the baptism of Jesus or not.
Now,

97
00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:56.390
why would this be an important issue?

98
00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:59.630
Because if the voice from heaven saying,

99
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.330
today I have the gotten you,

100
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.030
which is a quote from the psalm after all,

101
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:10.780
then wouldn't that imply that Jesus was not the son of God yesterday and that's

102
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:14.090
exactly the way some Christians took it.

103
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.690
They believe that Jesus became the son of God.

104
00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:19.820
He wasn't born the son of God.

105
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.710
He was adopted as the son of God and some Christian said it was at his baptism

106
00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.900
and they would cite some Greek version of this text.
Now,

107
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:32.390
scholars have debated about whether it was rigid in a text.

108
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:36.190
If it's not in the text,
how it get there,
what a scribe would see this.
Uh,

109
00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.610
you are my beloved son and the scribe might know the songs very well and might

110
00:06:40.611 --> 00:06:43.910
know that the next line of the Psalm was today I had the gotten you and so just

111
00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.540
quoted it almost from memory from the psalm and therefore it got into the text

112
00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:51.050
or as Bart Ehrman,

113
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.630
the author of your textbook has said,

114
00:06:53.631 --> 00:06:57.920
Bart actually became very famous first as a text critic of the New Testament.

115
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.270
That is his profession,

116
00:06:59.271 --> 00:07:03.770
was trying to figure out what was the most likely original reading of the Greek

117
00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:06.500
New Testament texts by comparing all these different manuscripts.

118
00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.360
And he's argued that he thinks that maybe the texts originally said today I had

119
00:07:11.361 --> 00:07:16.010
been gotten you and Orthodox scribes took it out in the second century.

120
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:20.120
And you can tell why Orthodox scribes may have taken it out if they thought that

121
00:07:20.121 --> 00:07:23.540
that gave weight to an adoption is Christology,

122
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.700
which they considered heretical.
They would take it out of the text.
So it's an,

123
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:31.940
it's an open question that some scholars say they think that today had the

124
00:07:31.941 --> 00:07:33.230
gotten you was not originally,

125
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:37.430
and therefore they agree with the new revised standard version and not putting

126
00:07:37.431 --> 00:07:39.980
it in the Bible,
but putting it in a footnote in stead.

127
00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:43.070
And others would agree with Bart Ehrman and say,
no,

128
00:07:43.071 --> 00:07:46.220
it probably was in the text and an Orthodox scribes took it out because it

129
00:07:46.221 --> 00:07:48.440
didn't sound orthodox for them.
Anyway,

130
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:52.490
that's a clue that one of the Chris' Dolly's uses was around and was debated in

131
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:57.120
the second century was precisely was Jesus born son of God or did he become son

132
00:07:57.121 --> 00:07:58.910
of God by adoption at his baptism?

133
00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.680
And you've and a psalm two seven is the one that you can look that up also.

134
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:06.050
Now look at Luke nine 35,

135
00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.390
nine 35 also in Luke.

136
00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.680
Where am I?
Okay.
Then a cloud came from,
uh,

137
00:08:18.900 --> 00:08:22.610
then from the cloud came a voice.
This is at the transfiguration of Jesus.

138
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.990
Remember when he's up on the mountain and he,
his clothing changes,

139
00:08:26.991 --> 00:08:29.150
his face changes.
You start shining.
Now,

140
00:08:29.151 --> 00:08:32.870
here's what the voice from heaven says this time,
this is my son,

141
00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:37.280
my chosen.
Listen to him,
my chosen.

142
00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:41.510
Again,
that sounds like God.

143
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:46.511
The father chose Jesus maybe because of his special righteousness to be his son.

144
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.400
Look at acts two 36 now.
Acts of course,

145
00:08:52.401 --> 00:08:55.470
written by the same person who wrote Luke.
So we're not changing authors here.

146
00:08:55.650 --> 00:09:00.180
We're just changing books.
X Two 36 this is in a speech,

147
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.780
a sermon,
one of the first sermon in acts by Peter.

148
00:09:05.900 --> 00:09:08.540
So on the day of Pentecost,
you know the story,

149
00:09:08.541 --> 00:09:13.100
the spirit in flames come down and rest on the Christians and they all start

150
00:09:13.101 --> 00:09:15.740
speaking in tongues and languages of everybody around the world.

151
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:20.300
Then Peter gives a sermon to 36,

152
00:09:20.330 --> 00:09:24.080
therefore let the entire house of Israel.
Now this is the way he ends the sermon.

153
00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:27.830
So this is an emphatic position in the text.
This is the end of Peter's sermon.

154
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.200
Let the entire house of Israel know with certainty that God has made him both

155
00:09:33.230 --> 00:09:38.150
Lord and Messiah.
This Jesus whom you crucified has made him again,

156
00:09:38.151 --> 00:09:42.260
that idea.
Look at acts 1333.

157
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:51.510
Uh,
go back to verse 32 and we bring you the good news.
That what?

158
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:55.380
That what God promised to ours.
Ancestors,
he has fulfilled for us,

159
00:09:55.381 --> 00:09:59.550
their children by raising Jesus as also it is written in the second song.

160
00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:04.410
You are my son today.
I have been gotten you.
Oh,
now that's now.
It's the today.

161
00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:08.880
But what is the day that this text seems to be referring to the resurrection.

162
00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:15.480
So is this a hint that there were other Christians who believed that Jesus was

163
00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:18.540
human until he was raised from the dead,

164
00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:21.750
and that's when he became divine and the son of God.

165
00:10:23.610 --> 00:10:26.940
Look at Romans now we're going to go to Paul.
Romans one.

166
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:30.113
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

167
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:38.080
<v 0>Romans chapter one verses three and four,</v>

168
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:44.090
which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures,

169
00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:49.010
the Gospel concerning his son who was descended from David according to the

170
00:10:49.011 --> 00:10:54.011
flesh and was declared to be son of God with power according to the spirit of

171
00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:56.990
holiness by resurrection from the dead.

172
00:10:57.590 --> 00:11:00.170
Now I would dispute that translation.

173
00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:04.820
The Greek there that's translated by your Bible as declared,

174
00:11:04.821 --> 00:11:06.080
at least by the NRSV,

175
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:10.700
I think is actually better translated as a point our designate.

176
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.690
Does anybody else have a different word for declare in that verse?

177
00:11:16.170 --> 00:11:19.590
Let me read it again.
You look at verses three and four of Romans one,

178
00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:21.241
verse four,

179
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:24.660
and was declared to be son of God with power according to the spirit of
holiness,

180
00:11:24.661 --> 00:11:28.470
by resurrection from the dead.
Anybody else have a different word than declare?

181
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.450
Yes,
yes.
Designated.
See,
that's exactly the word I would have used.

182
00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:37.780
Is there a difference?
Well,
it could be.
There could be a slight difference in,

183
00:11:37.781 --> 00:11:40.200
in the idea,
didn't Jesus,

184
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:45.230
did God just announce that Jesus was divine at his resurrection or did he make

185
00:11:45.901 --> 00:11:47.190
him designate him?

186
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.910
Like when you designate someone to be the leader of the class,

187
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:52.260
to be the president of the United States,

188
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:56.830
you designate to an office and it's at the designation of the office office.

189
00:11:56.831 --> 00:11:59.050
That's the actual person becomes that official.

190
00:12:00.150 --> 00:12:02.500
I think that's actually the better translation of the Greek.

191
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:07.890
That again though would imply that Paul May be quoting a,

192
00:12:07.911 --> 00:12:12.911
an uh phrase that he's maybe gets from elsewhere that believed that Jesus became

193
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:19.660
the son of God divine at his resurrection.
Now,

194
00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:23.350
of course I say Paul quoting something because there are other indications in

195
00:12:23.351 --> 00:12:26.140
Paul that he probably didn't believe that Paul seems to,

196
00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:30.580
I'd give the idea to other places that he can hit a Christology that Jesus was

197
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:34.070
preexistent as divine.
In Philippians,
you get the,

198
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:38.330
the famous hymn where Christ descends into the body and is suffers as a slave

199
00:12:38.331 --> 00:12:40.150
and his raised back up there,

200
00:12:40.151 --> 00:12:43.780
you almost get the idea that Paul believed that Jesus was in a preexistent state

201
00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:45.160
as some,
as the son of gun.

202
00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:49.900
So this may not be Paul's own considered theology,

203
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:52.450
Christology,
and therefore Pete some scholars who said,

204
00:12:52.451 --> 00:12:54.760
maybe he's quoting along that it gets from some of those,

205
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:59.050
but it does show us that there may have been other Christians who believe that

206
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:02.830
Jesus became divine only at his resurrection.
In other words,

207
00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:06.010
we can map out all these differences.
And of course,

208
00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:09.310
what does the gospel of John,
what would the god,

209
00:13:09.340 --> 00:13:11.020
what was the Christology of the gospel of John?

210
00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:15.880
When did Jesus Become divine according to the gospel of John?
Anybody?

211
00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:19.570
He always was.
He was with God and very beginning,

212
00:13:19.571 --> 00:13:22.060
everything was created through him.
So the Gospel,

213
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.470
the beginning of the gospel of John,

214
00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.800
ends up having the Christology that now has become Orthodox Christianity and

215
00:13:29.531 --> 00:13:30.880
these other Christologies.

216
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:34.960
We're all declared heretical at some point in Christian history.

217
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:40.210
But notice how what we've got,
let's say we've got the historical Jesus,

218
00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:45.070
and we can say certainly he was a prophet.
He was recognized as a prophet.

219
00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:47.050
He seems to accept himself as a prophet,

220
00:13:47.560 --> 00:13:51.280
and it may be that he claimed to be a king or a messiah,

221
00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:53.650
but certainly by the time of his,
his execution,

222
00:13:53.770 --> 00:13:56.590
some people thought he was a king because that's the charge on which he was

223
00:13:56.591 --> 00:13:59.470
executed.
This is Jesus of Nazareth,
King of the Jews.

224
00:13:59.620 --> 00:14:03.970
So the Romans executed Jesus because at least either he or other people were

225
00:14:03.971 --> 00:14:07.030
claiming that he was a king.
So he's a prophet and he's a king.

226
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.940
Does that mean Jesus divine?
No,
of course not.

227
00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.180
The Jews had lots of kings that were not divine did.

228
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:15.580
You just has lots of profits that we're not denying divine modern.

229
00:14:15.581 --> 00:14:20.581
People sometimes get the idea that the word Christ or Messiah in itself

230
00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:25.360
signifies divinity,
but it doesn't.
The Messiah in,
in Paul's Day,

231
00:14:25.361 --> 00:14:29.890
in Jesus' Day was simply some Jewish figure who would rise up and take over the

232
00:14:29.891 --> 00:14:32.830
throne of David and reestablish the Kingdom of Israel.

233
00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.360
So calling someone a messiah in the ancient world didn't mean that he was
divine.

234
00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:42.340
It might,
but it didn't necessarily at all.
So Jesus is a prophet.

235
00:14:42.370 --> 00:14:45.280
Maybe he's even considered the messiah that doesn't make him a divine.

236
00:14:45.670 --> 00:14:50.500
Some Christians though for head to make a decision,
is he human

237
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.870
and only human or is he human?

238
00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:58.393
<v 1>Okay</v>

239
00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.603
<v 0>and divine.</v>

240
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:06.900
This is the take that most followers of Jesus ended up taking.

241
00:15:07.140 --> 00:15:09.810
Although there were some followers of Jesus who existed all the way into the

242
00:15:09.811 --> 00:15:11.970
second century who believed he was just,
he was purely human.

243
00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:16.170
They tended to be Jewish followers of Jesus.
They accept them as a great prophet.

244
00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.900
David except them has been psi.
But that didn't mean they thought it was God.

245
00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:22.980
They still want it to be complete monotheist and have only God,
only one God.

246
00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:25.860
So they said,
no,
Jesus can't be divine.

247
00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:29.310
So some followers of Jesus chose this route.
Others,

248
00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.230
as we've seen in the New Testament,
chose this route.

249
00:15:31.650 --> 00:15:33.360
Then though you have to split this up.

250
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:37.240
When did he become,
uh,

251
00:15:37.380 --> 00:15:41.070
was he always divine or did he become divine?

252
00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.010
Am I doing this right Jen?
Jen,
is this the next level?

253
00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.170
I had this chart in my notes,

254
00:15:46.171 --> 00:15:49.920
but I gave it to Jan Jan cause I thought she might have to lecture today and uh,

255
00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:54.430
I forgot it.
So we're winging it folks.

256
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.830
He became divine.

257
00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:00.840
He always was divine.

258
00:16:05.750 --> 00:16:06.440
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

259
00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:07.800
<v 0>So if he became divine,</v>

260
00:16:07.820 --> 00:16:11.630
then when did he become divine and you had different choices again,
like we said

261
00:16:13.190 --> 00:16:14.023
at his birth,

262
00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.470
because then you have the songs that all the angels sing and,

263
00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:20.390
and you take some of those songs,
the beginning of Luke,

264
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:22.520
and it sounds like they're talking about his divine.

265
00:16:22.521 --> 00:16:26.660
Now Ed is a baptism.

266
00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.460
As we've seen.
Some people tend to believe art is resurrection.

267
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:34.303
<v 1>Okay,</v>

268
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:39.650
<v 0>so Christians again seem to have divided up.
Do you take him as becoming divided,</v>

269
00:16:39.651 --> 00:16:44.300
his birth,
his baptism or his resurrection?
We've seen other Christians say no,

270
00:16:44.301 --> 00:16:46.610
he always was defined.
But even then,

271
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:50.330
they split up into different choices too because some of them,

272
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:55.040
um,
believed that he was,

273
00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.910
they still said he was divine,
but also fully human.

274
00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.480
So he was both divine but also fleshly.

275
00:17:05.190 --> 00:17:06.023
<v 1>Okay.</v>

276
00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.580
<v 0>Where are we seeing this people,</v>

277
00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.220
a letter in the new testament insisting that you can't have Jesus as divine

278
00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:14.620
without also having him has come in the flesh.

279
00:17:15.450 --> 00:17:19.900
Do you remember first John,
exactly like the letters of John?

280
00:17:20.170 --> 00:17:23.770
Get into this argument?
Apparently some people in the Johanan community,

281
00:17:23.950 --> 00:17:28.510
we're climbing,
that Jesus was fully divine but not fleshly.
And then you have,

282
00:17:28.930 --> 00:17:29.980
so this became

283
00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:34.580
that position flush and divine.

284
00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.360
And the other position I called it when I'd lectured on John Docetism,

285
00:17:42.230 --> 00:17:46.340
that is what came to be a heresy.
Remember in the second century,

286
00:17:46.341 --> 00:17:50.090
there was no organized church that could be able to declare what counted is

287
00:17:50.091 --> 00:17:54.540
orthodoxy and heresy.
But this idea was Jesus was not fully flesh.

288
00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:57.050
He was so,
he was so divine.
He was God.
So they,

289
00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:59.990
when he walked along the or wet sand on the beach,
his foot,

290
00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.720
his feet didn't leave footprints.
That's how divine he was.

291
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.780
He didn't have any weight about him.
He was not even fully flesh.

292
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:12.190
Cause I notice all of these are choices that followers of Jesus had to make in

293
00:18:12.241 --> 00:18:16.970
the decades following his death.
Some of them took the human routes,

294
00:18:16.971 --> 00:18:19.170
some of them took the human and divine route.
Some of them took this,

295
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.950
that he became divine.
This became declared as a heresy.

296
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.010
We call it adoptionism of some sort.

297
00:18:27.030 --> 00:18:31.110
Then of those who took the always divine route,
which we became orthodoxy,

298
00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.640
some of them also took the [inaudible] route that he wasn't fully few human

299
00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.230
fleshly and then others took this route like the gospel of John Does and the

300
00:18:40.231 --> 00:18:44.940
letters of John,
that he is both fleshly and divine.
Now,
all of those,

301
00:18:44.941 --> 00:18:49.380
notice how what this shows is it from simply the the historical existence of

302
00:18:49.381 --> 00:18:52.740
Jesus and his existence as a prophet or a king.

303
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:57.570
You had to make all these different choices to get down to this one because

304
00:18:57.690 --> 00:19:02.400
which of these all these different,
we have one,
two,
three,
four,

305
00:19:02.401 --> 00:19:06.000
five different possibilities down here.
Six right there,

306
00:19:06.690 --> 00:19:07.710
out of six choices,

307
00:19:07.711 --> 00:19:12.711
only one of them is considered orthodox by the later church.

308
00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:19.890
I do this just to show these.
These diversity's are there.
Um,

309
00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:22.350
if you're a Christian,
you believe that,
well,

310
00:19:22.351 --> 00:19:27.060
the Holy Spirit are God's providence led the way through this history so that

311
00:19:27.061 --> 00:19:31.440
what we end up with as the Nicene creed or the creative calcium is what we ought

312
00:19:31.441 --> 00:19:34.260
to believe as Christians.
But as a historian,

313
00:19:34.261 --> 00:19:37.680
you can't make that judgment as a historian.
You simply seem to,

314
00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:41.700
he just simply have to point out that there were lots of complexities in early

315
00:19:41.701 --> 00:19:46.701
Christianity that finally got whittled down into a more United consensus view on

316
00:19:47.641 --> 00:19:50.400
Christology.
Any questions about any of that?

317
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.050
This is,
I'm,

318
00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:57.180
I'm doing this partly just to show you how this happened historically,

319
00:19:57.360 --> 00:20:02.340
and this actually gets you into a post new testament kind of a subject.

320
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:05.970
You could easily take a course after this,
uh,

321
00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.580
say the one taught by Bentley Leighton or Steven Davis.

322
00:20:08.790 --> 00:20:11.870
That analyze is called a course from Jesus to Augustine or something.

323
00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.540
I think he's taken it past past.

324
00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:16.320
I've Guston now that covers a little bit of the new testament texts,

325
00:20:16.321 --> 00:20:19.890
but really that's of course on the development of early Christianity in its

326
00:20:19.891 --> 00:20:21.030
first few centuries.

327
00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:25.260
Or you can even take courses that talk about the development of Christianity all

328
00:20:25.261 --> 00:20:28.230
the way up from the beginning to the reformation or even beyond.

329
00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:30.930
And in any of these historic Shargel courses,

330
00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.780
you're going to see this kind of diversity in the shaping of this that comes

331
00:20:33.781 --> 00:20:36.710
about.
So part of what I'm doing is just,
uh,

332
00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:39.840
illustrating the diversity of Christianity and how it came about.

333
00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:44.430
But I'm also trying to model a behavior for you of thinking Theola thinking

334
00:20:44.431 --> 00:20:48.880
historically about what we are actually theological text,

335
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.450
thinking about the growth of Christianity as if it didn't just plop out of the

336
00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.640
sky all in one orthodox piece.

337
00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:59.500
But it took a host historical process of struggle to,
uh,

338
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:04.200
come about.
And it was a complicated historical process.
Now what?

339
00:21:04.270 --> 00:21:06.610
Where does that leave us with James?

340
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:09.910
James provides us another example of uh,

341
00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:14.890
of differences in notions of faith and works when compared to Paul.

342
00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:18.610
First,
I'm going to take some examples from Hebrew scripture.

343
00:21:18.850 --> 00:21:23.850
So if you've got your Bible not haven't taught you a song for the old testament

344
00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:26.760
books,
the books of Hebrew scriptures,

345
00:21:26.761 --> 00:21:29.140
so you'll just have to follow along as best you can.

346
00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:31.810
Proverbs and my Bible,

347
00:21:31.811 --> 00:21:35.740
it's page nine oh four in the Hebrew Bible,

348
00:21:35.741 --> 00:21:37.030
but that's not the Bible you have,

349
00:21:37.031 --> 00:21:41.410
I would hasten to say the proverbs of Solomon,

350
00:21:41.411 --> 00:21:43.600
son of David,
King of Israel

351
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.930
for learning about wisdom and instruction for understanding words of insight for

352
00:21:49.931 --> 00:21:52.060
gaining instruction and wise dealing righteousness,

353
00:21:52.061 --> 00:21:55.960
justice and equity to teach trueness to the simple knowledge improvements to the

354
00:21:55.961 --> 00:21:56.530
young,

355
00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:00.760
let the wise also here and gain and learning and did a surrounding acquire skill

356
00:22:00.761 --> 00:22:04.600
to understand a proverb and a figure.
The words of the wise and their riddles.

357
00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:08.380
The fear of the Lord is one of my mom's favorite verse when I was a kid,

358
00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:12.070
caught it all the time.
To us,
the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.

359
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:14.530
Fools,
despise wisdom and instruction.

360
00:22:15.370 --> 00:22:17.830
Kind of a motherly type verse,
isn't it?

361
00:22:19.150 --> 00:22:23.890
That what you've got in proverbs is a whole series of teachings,

362
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:28.840
wisdom sayings.
And some of them are pretty nondescript.
It's just like,

363
00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:32.540
you know,
cover your mouth when you cough type thing is there,

364
00:22:32.541 --> 00:22:34.510
there are some things that aren't particularly heavy,

365
00:22:34.780 --> 00:22:39.730
our philosophical or theological,
uh,
but just sayings,
wisdom.

366
00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:40.900
Sangs uh,

367
00:22:40.901 --> 00:22:44.830
another one of my mother's favorite ones was there was a women's Club at the

368
00:22:44.831 --> 00:22:48.030
college.
She went to the Christian college you went to,
and the,

369
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:50.890
the quotation of it,
it was from this proverb,

370
00:22:50.891 --> 00:22:54.940
we're just talking about a worthy woman and the quotation of the buy was her

371
00:22:54.941 --> 00:22:58.840
price is far above rubies.
And that was the motto for this girl's Club.

372
00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.110
And My mother always said,
I wonder how much ruby charges

373
00:23:05.670 --> 00:23:09.700
let that sort of is a little sayings.
Like how much does ruby charge?

374
00:23:09.701 --> 00:23:13.830
That's not part of the scriptures.
But the other part is part of group.

375
00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.020
These are wisdom sayings and this is wisdom literature.

376
00:23:17.290 --> 00:23:20.740
So in the Jewish scripture you have whole books that are basically wisdom

377
00:23:20.741 --> 00:23:23.460
literature and scholars will use that term.
They're sayings of,

378
00:23:23.461 --> 00:23:27.460
of wisdom kind of sayings.
You get it also in job.
Um,

379
00:23:27.610 --> 00:23:32.610
look at job is before psalms job 14 one

380
00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.110
Joe is also one version of wisdom literature,

381
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:48.890
a mortal barn of woman few of days and few and full of trouble comes up like a

382
00:23:50.691 --> 00:23:54.740
flower.
And withers is like a shadow and does not last.

383
00:23:56.870 --> 00:24:01.610
Ah,
how sad.
Notice wisdom literature isn't always very cheery.

384
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:06.170
A lot of wisdom literature is about how difficult life is.

385
00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:09.500
That life is fleeting that you just come up like a flower.
You,

386
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:11.840
you're beautiful and young for you know,

387
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:16.720
two weeks and then you fade and get old and ugly and then you die.
You know,

388
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.090
a lot of wisdom literature is sort of like,
you know,
life's a bitch.

389
00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:21.830
So just enjoy it while you can.

390
00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:26.090
And that's where you get some of the sayings out of job and the proverbs,

391
00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.830
the wisdom of Solomon that may be in your,
oh,

392
00:24:30.831 --> 00:24:33.500
I don't have the wisdom of Solomon.
Uh,
in your Apocrypha,

393
00:24:33.501 --> 00:24:36.380
if you have a bible that has the Apocrypha in it,

394
00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:39.280
you'd find the wisdom of Solomon,
which also has a,

395
00:24:39.290 --> 00:24:40.850
if you looked at the wisdom of Solomon,

396
00:24:40.851 --> 00:24:44.600
six 17 through 20 has some wonderful wisdom sayings.

397
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.930
Uh,
sir,

398
00:24:47.990 --> 00:24:52.990
Ciroc for has sayings about the poor that remembering the poor.

399
00:24:54.490 --> 00:24:57.980
It's admonitions to rich people to remember the poor,
do not forsake the poor.

400
00:24:58.550 --> 00:25:02.510
And Ciroc six five has a warning about speech.

401
00:25:02.540 --> 00:25:06.320
Control your speech,
watch your tongue.
So notice these sayings,

402
00:25:06.620 --> 00:25:11.150
things about how life is fleeting.
You come up like flowers,
like grass,

403
00:25:11.151 --> 00:25:13.490
it fades,
uh,
take care of the poor.

404
00:25:13.491 --> 00:25:17.270
Don't forget the poor wisdom literature often seems to be written within a

405
00:25:17.271 --> 00:25:20.690
context of people who are fairly well off themselves,
rich people.

406
00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:23.000
And it's written to these rich people.

407
00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:26.600
But in order to also get them not to forget the poor and then in the saying

408
00:25:26.601 --> 00:25:31.601
about watch your mouth control the tongue that we see in a Ciroc six five is

409
00:25:32.001 --> 00:25:35.990
also there.
Now with that in mind,
all these other kinds of wisdom literature,

410
00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:37.010
turn to James

411
00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:49.140
and look at chapter three of James.

412
00:25:52.450 --> 00:25:52.950
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

413
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:56.130
<v 0>Not many of you should become teachers.
My brothers,</v>

414
00:25:57.210 --> 00:25:58.740
my translation says sisters,

415
00:25:58.741 --> 00:26:03.060
but in the Greek it's just brothers for you know that we who teach will be

416
00:26:03.061 --> 00:26:06.000
judged with greater strictness for all who make money.

417
00:26:06.090 --> 00:26:07.500
All of us make many mistakes.

418
00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:11.940
Anyone who makes no mistakes in speaking as perfect able to keep the whole body

419
00:26:11.941 --> 00:26:12.990
in check with a bridle.

420
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:16.740
If we put bits into the mouths of horses to make them obey us,

421
00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:18.570
we guide their whole bodies.

422
00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:23.100
Notice this is just folk wisdom,
right?

423
00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:27.450
Look how you control a horse.
You put a bit and its mouth.

424
00:26:27.690 --> 00:26:30.840
You pull the horses mouth this way the horse goes that way.

425
00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:33.150
You pull the hardest math that way the horse goes that way.

426
00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.940
This is nothing really big revelation type stuff,
right?

427
00:26:36.270 --> 00:26:40.680
This is not kind of revealing secrets of God or this is not even revealing

428
00:26:40.681 --> 00:26:44.100
secrets of the Gospel.
This is not,
this is just wisdom.

429
00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:47.880
That's what a lot of wisdom literature in the Bible also it looks like folk

430
00:26:47.881 --> 00:26:49.800
wisdom or look at ships.

431
00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:53.970
He says another example though they are so large that it takes strong winds to

432
00:26:53.971 --> 00:26:54.660
drive them.

433
00:26:54.660 --> 00:26:58.200
Yet they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot

434
00:26:58.201 --> 00:26:58.680
directs.

435
00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:03.680
So also the tongue is a small member yet it boasts of great exploits almost.

436
00:27:05.401 --> 00:27:10.401
It just really echos that kind of stuff we've you can see in Sirach and proverbs

437
00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:11.610
and those kinds of things.

438
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:16.820
So one of the things that James is the letter of James is a representation of

439
00:27:16.831 --> 00:27:21.420
typical Jewish wisdom literature.
Why do I say Jewish?

440
00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:23.580
Because this is actually a very Jewish document.

441
00:27:23.581 --> 00:27:25.350
There's almost no mention of Christ in it.

442
00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:28.110
If you took out a few sentences here and there,

443
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.800
the letter of James could read as a non Christian document because most of this

444
00:27:31.801 --> 00:27:33.510
stuff about them,
the tongue,

445
00:27:33.511 --> 00:27:36.360
how you control the tongue about remembering the poor,
all these sorts of things.

446
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:39.540
This is stuff anybody,
any Jewish person in the ancient world could have said.

447
00:27:39.690 --> 00:27:44.130
It's not particularly Christian,
so that James is a,
an example of ancient,

448
00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:47.670
typical Jewish wisdom literature,
but,

449
00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:52.410
and here's where James becomes very interesting for Christian readings.

450
00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:56.720
Look at,
okay,

451
00:27:56.721 --> 00:27:59.090
keep your finger on James,

452
00:28:00.430 --> 00:28:01.263
<v 2>but</v>

453
00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.570
<v 0>well,
no,
I'll,
I'll skip that.
You know?
Yes.
Let's read Romans Four.</v>

454
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:07.920
Look at Romans four quickly.

455
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:17.480
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

456
00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.120
<v 0>Romans four one and now you're familiar with this.</v>

457
00:28:20.121 --> 00:28:23.720
You've already talked about Paul.
You've written about Paul,
you know about Paul.

458
00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:26.750
What then are we to say was gained by Abraham,

459
00:28:26.751 --> 00:28:31.190
our ancestor according to the flesh,
for if Abraham was justified by works,

460
00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:34.370
he has something to boast about,
but not before God.

461
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.320
For what does the scripture say?

462
00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:40.310
Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.

463
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.890
Now keep that scripture in mind.
It's a quotation from genesis.

464
00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:46.640
Abraham believed God and it was reckoned to him as righteousness.

465
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.960
Now to one who works wages are not reckoned as a gift,
but it's something do.

466
00:28:50.961 --> 00:28:53.780
But to one who without works,
trust him,
who justifies the ungodly,

467
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:55.610
such faith as record as righteousness,

468
00:28:55.790 --> 00:28:58.250
and then he goes on and makes Paul makes his argument further.

469
00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:01.070
Galatians three has a very similar thing.

470
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:05.010
It quotes the same kind of Christmas scriptures from Galatians and Paul in

471
00:29:05.011 --> 00:29:09.350
Galatians makes the same point.
Abraham was not justified by works.

472
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:13.580
Any quotes,
some of the very,
this very scripture to prove according to Paul,

473
00:29:13.581 --> 00:29:17.180
that genesis shows that Abraham was not justified by works.

474
00:29:17.330 --> 00:29:20.390
He was justified by faith.
Now look back at James

475
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:23.623
<v 2>One</v>

476
00:29:24.390 --> 00:29:27.270
<v 0>I should have kept my finger there.
Want to be flipping back and forth.</v>

477
00:29:30.330 --> 00:29:33.960
First Chapter of James Verses 20 through 22 through 25

478
00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:42.680
but be doers of the word and not merely hearers who deceive themselves for if

479
00:29:43.571 --> 00:29:45.820
any,
are hearers of the word and not doers.

480
00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:48.400
They are like those who look themselves in a mirror,

481
00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.120
look at himself in the mirror for they look at themselves and on going away

482
00:29:52.121 --> 00:29:55.570
immediately.
Forget what they were like,
but those who look into the perfect law,

483
00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.070
the law of liberty,
and persevere not being hearers who forget,

484
00:30:00.071 --> 00:30:03.490
but doers who act,
they will be blessed in they're doing.

485
00:30:04.270 --> 00:30:09.270
Look at James Two 14 what good is it my brothers?

486
00:30:10.091 --> 00:30:14.440
If you say you have faith but do not have works,
can faith save you?

487
00:30:15.610 --> 00:30:19.390
Well,
I think Paul would say,
as a matter of fact,
James.
Yes.

488
00:30:20.950 --> 00:30:21.470
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

489
00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:23.780
<v 0>If a brother or sister is naked and lacks daily food,</v>

490
00:30:23.781 --> 00:30:26.870
and one of you says to them,
go in peace,
be warmed and eat your fill,

491
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:29.630
and yet you do not supply their bodily needs.
What good is that?

492
00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:33.170
So faith by itself,
if it has no works,
is dead.

493
00:30:35.090 --> 00:30:40.010
Look at 21 through 26 of the same chapter.
James Two 21 through 26

494
00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.370
was not our ancestor.

495
00:30:43.371 --> 00:30:48.080
Abraham justified by works when he offered his son Isaac on the altar.

496
00:30:48.470 --> 00:30:52.700
You see that faith was active along with his works and faith was brought to

497
00:30:52.701 --> 00:30:54.320
completion by the works.

498
00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:58.850
Thus the scripture was fulfilled that says Abraham believed God and it was

499
00:30:58.851 --> 00:31:00.350
reckoned to him as righteousness.

500
00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:06.820
Notice this guy quotes the exact same verse Paul quotes,

501
00:31:08.030 --> 00:31:09.650
but to make the opposite point,

502
00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:14.660
Paul had quoted this very verse to argue that Abraham was justified by his
faith,

503
00:31:14.661 --> 00:31:19.640
not by works.
This writer close to the same verse from Genesis to say,

504
00:31:19.940 --> 00:31:21.410
Abraham was justified by works.

505
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:25.850
You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone likewise was

506
00:31:25.851 --> 00:31:26.510
not Rayhab.

507
00:31:26.510 --> 00:31:30.410
The prostitute also justified by works when she welcomed the messengers and sent

508
00:31:30.411 --> 00:31:31.550
them out by another road.

509
00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.530
This is when the Israelites were surrounding the city of Jericho before they'd

510
00:31:35.531 --> 00:31:37.310
marched around it and made all the walls fall down.

511
00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.150
Two of the spies came into Jericho and they were received by a prostitute Rayhab

512
00:31:41.660 --> 00:31:43.820
for just as the body without the spirit is dead,

513
00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:48.380
so faith without works is also dead.
Now this,

514
00:31:48.530 --> 00:31:49.520
these texts

515
00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:56.270
seem to be arguing against Paul and it makes us wonder,

516
00:31:56.510 --> 00:32:01.310
does the author actually have text to Paul in front of him?

517
00:32:02.050 --> 00:32:05.630
Is he actually reading Romans and Galatians and he sees that Paul quotes this

518
00:32:05.631 --> 00:32:09.410
passage from genesis and therefore he coached the same patches to make the

519
00:32:09.411 --> 00:32:13.700
opposite point or has he heard about Paul's Gospel,

520
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:18.970
about a works free gospel in some places and he's responding to rumors or is he

521
00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.990
just responding to Paul Type Christians?

522
00:32:24.320 --> 00:32:26.840
He may not know Paul himself and man don't even have access to Paul's work,

523
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:31.940
but he's heard some people who are followers of Paul and promote his kind of law

524
00:32:31.941 --> 00:32:36.380
free faith dominated Gospel and he's writing against those kinds of people.

525
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:41.320
It's very difficult to say,
but as a lot of,

526
00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:46.380
as I think Bart Ehrman in the textbook points out and other people have said all

527
00:32:46.631 --> 00:32:47.230
along,

528
00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:52.230
there is a way to sort of get beyond this contradiction and to say that maybe

529
00:32:52.841 --> 00:32:57.280
the writer of James is not saying really the opposite of what Paul is saying.

530
00:32:57.310 --> 00:33:02.230
After all.
Have you picked up on that argument?
Yes.

531
00:33:02.231 --> 00:33:03.670
What do you,
what is it?
What's the argument?

532
00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:08.120
Yes,

533
00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:12.350
they're operating on different definitions of works and faith and that's a very

534
00:33:12.351 --> 00:33:15.290
good point.
So notice for example,
for what,

535
00:33:15.291 --> 00:33:18.680
what was faith for Paul faith.

536
00:33:18.740 --> 00:33:22.880
And this is something that modern people,
Christians as well as non Christians,

537
00:33:23.540 --> 00:33:27.680
radical atheists,
you know,
Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens,

538
00:33:28.130 --> 00:33:31.060
uh,
you know,
publish these books saying,
you know,

539
00:33:31.070 --> 00:33:35.420
Christian or any religious people in general are crazy people who believe lots

540
00:33:35.421 --> 00:33:38.870
of ridiculous things before breakfast.
And just think that that's that.

541
00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:42.290
And the idea is that if you're a religious person,
you do believe that,
you know,

542
00:33:42.291 --> 00:33:44.150
people go around walking on water all the time,

543
00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:46.970
that hell both exist under the ground below our feet,

544
00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:50.420
that God is this man with a beard who sits up in the cloud somewhere.

545
00:33:50.630 --> 00:33:53.630
And so there are a lot of people who think what his religious faith,
well,

546
00:33:53.631 --> 00:33:57.140
it's actually believing certain propositions.
It's believing a proposition.

547
00:33:57.141 --> 00:33:59.000
Like there is a God,

548
00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:01.880
God is alive in the same way that you would believe the proposition.

549
00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:05.540
It's sun shining outside.
It's a proposition.
You just look at nature.

550
00:34:05.541 --> 00:34:06.374
You figure it out.

551
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:11.240
Now in the Terry lectures a year ago or yeah,

552
00:34:11.241 --> 00:34:14.540
by I believe a year ago.
Um,
Terry Eagleton,

553
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:18.620
who's a very famous Marxist literary critic,
but he grew up Catholic.

554
00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:19.940
He gave the Terry lectures.

555
00:34:19.941 --> 00:34:22.940
They've just come out in publication by Yale University press.

556
00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:26.490
I recommend them very highly gay four lectures in which he took,
uh,

557
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:31.370
took on these sort of radical atheists and Terry Eagleton wasn't arguing himself

558
00:34:31.371 --> 00:34:32.630
for Christian faith.

559
00:34:33.110 --> 00:34:35.630
I don't even know whether he believes Christian stuff or not.

560
00:34:35.631 --> 00:34:39.500
But what he was trying to argue is that what count has counted as Christian

561
00:34:39.501 --> 00:34:43.910
faith over the centuries is more complicated than simply believing a proposition

562
00:34:44.390 --> 00:34:48.590
that say the proposition God exists for Paul in his matter.
As a matter of fact,

563
00:34:49.070 --> 00:34:52.610
having faith is more a sense of putting your trust in God.

564
00:34:53.330 --> 00:34:55.250
So talking about trust,

565
00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.600
faith for Paul is trusting God to do what you need.

566
00:35:00.110 --> 00:35:03.380
So faith is not simply a belief in certain kinds of propositions,

567
00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.570
like a scientific proposition.

568
00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:10.810
It's actually an attitude of putting all of your trust in God through Jesus

569
00:35:10.850 --> 00:35:11.631
Christ.
This notion,

570
00:35:11.631 --> 00:35:16.631
therefore that faith is something that you believe about is not really matched

571
00:35:17.091 --> 00:35:19.160
by Paul's writings on faith,

572
00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.250
which are much more complex and they're much more like the idea that faith is a

573
00:35:22.251 --> 00:35:25.730
way of living.
Faith is,
uh,
is a,
uh,
uh,
does decision.

574
00:35:26.030 --> 00:35:30.410
Soren Kierkegaard the great leap of faith,
the 19th century philosopher,
faith,

575
00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.590
faith is this willingness to just throw it all in.

576
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:37.770
Even though all the evidence might be to the contrary,
it's a,
you make,

577
00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.700
it's a leap of faith and carry God's image.
That's what it's more like for Paul.

578
00:35:42.090 --> 00:35:46.050
But notice that's not exactly what James seems to think faith is.

579
00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:49.710
And this is why some people have said Paul and James are not really disagreeing

580
00:35:49.711 --> 00:35:51.660
with each other because they're working with different notions of faith and

581
00:35:51.661 --> 00:35:56.100
works.
So what does James say
a to 19

582
00:35:59.070 --> 00:36:02.850
James Two 19.
You believe that God is one.

583
00:36:03.390 --> 00:36:06.840
You do well,
even the demons believe and shudder.

584
00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.380
Ah,
see that's a pretty big clue.

585
00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:15.950
Do you think Paul would've ever said that demons have faith in Christ?

586
00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:17.653
<v 2>No.</v>

587
00:36:18.290 --> 00:36:21.350
<v 0>Paul actually doesn't talk about demons enough for us to really be sure.</v>

588
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:24.080
He only mentions demons once in all of his letters.

589
00:36:24.081 --> 00:36:27.040
And that's in First Corinthians 10 and he's just talking,

590
00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.070
took the courage and saying,

591
00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:32.510
don't participate in idle sacrifices because that's participating in the table

592
00:36:32.511 --> 00:36:36.860
of demons.
But Paul's not too concerned about demons,
but he doesn't.

593
00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.100
I think it'd be outlandish to think that Paul would have considered demons as

594
00:36:40.101 --> 00:36:44.480
having faith in Christ.
Demons believe that Christ exists.

595
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:49.040
Polity.
Yeah,
of course they know.
Damon's know God exists.

596
00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:50.150
Name is no Christ exist.

597
00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:53.420
So that's not what Paul's definition of Christian faith is.

598
00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:55.970
But that is what James seems to be thinking.

599
00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:01.000
Faith is it simply the mental acknowledgement of the existence of God and that

600
00:37:01.521 --> 00:37:02.354
God is one.

601
00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:05.810
That is the rejection of idolatry and polytheism and the idea that God is one.

602
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:11.230
So now faith therefore for James is not the same kind of thing as faith is for

603
00:37:11.691 --> 00:37:12.350
Paul.

604
00:37:12.350 --> 00:37:16.970
And that's why you can have Paul saying you're justified by faith and James

605
00:37:16.971 --> 00:37:19.970
disagreeing with him,
but saying,
look,
even demons have faith.

606
00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:23.420
They believe and they're not saved by it.
So you have to have works also,

607
00:37:23.930 --> 00:37:28.370
but also works is not really the same thing for Paul.
As for James,

608
00:37:28.700 --> 00:37:31.760
remember I talked about how the traditional way of understanding Paul,

609
00:37:31.790 --> 00:37:36.200
this sort of Lutheran way was that when Paul is talking about salvation by works

610
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:39.290
versus salvation by faith,
what he's talking about,

611
00:37:39.291 --> 00:37:41.630
and this is sort of the Protestant way of thinking,
ah,

612
00:37:41.631 --> 00:37:45.830
this become more popular than modern world work stand for anything humans can
do.

613
00:37:46.310 --> 00:37:49.850
So for Martin Luther works weren't just circumcision,

614
00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:53.570
are keeping cash route,
are keeping the sabbath.
In other words,

615
00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:54.740
works of the Jewish law.

616
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:59.570
For Martin Luther works where indulgences sold by the Roman Catholic Church

617
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:05.150
works were be even being baptized works where uh,

618
00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:10.250
confessing and doing penance for Martin Luther the works he was saying,

619
00:38:10.251 --> 00:38:15.251
don't save you were any activity that human beings do in order to try to earn

620
00:38:16.221 --> 00:38:17.054
their own salvation.

621
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:24.080
That's not what works are for Paul.
When Paul talks about works in Romans,

622
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:29.180
he's clearly talking about works of Jewish law.
He's talking about circumcision.

623
00:38:30.020 --> 00:38:33.350
Now.
I'm not saying that that means that you can't read Paul as a protestant.

624
00:38:33.351 --> 00:38:35.000
If you want to read positive Protestant,
that's fine.

625
00:38:35.110 --> 00:38:39.670
You can read a certain kind of idea of salvation by grace through faith,

626
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:43.300
apart from even human endeavor in Paul's letter to the Romans,

627
00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.610
but that's not the main thing he would.
Paul was talking about,

628
00:38:45.611 --> 00:38:48.430
the main thing Paul was doing was trying to get gentiles in Rome,

629
00:38:48.910 --> 00:38:52.180
not to feel like they had to keep Jewish law,

630
00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:56.200
but also then not to despise Jewish followers of Jesus and not to despise
Israel.

631
00:38:56.530 --> 00:38:58.180
So Romans is a complicated letter,

632
00:38:58.510 --> 00:39:02.470
but it wasn't as simple as you might get the idea from traditional Protestant

633
00:39:02.471 --> 00:39:06.460
piety,
which is works our human activity period.

634
00:39:07.510 --> 00:39:10.870
That is obviously what James takes works to be right?

635
00:39:11.410 --> 00:39:13.720
Because he's not talking about works of Jewish law.

636
00:39:13.721 --> 00:39:15.010
He's not talking about circumcision.

637
00:39:15.130 --> 00:39:17.640
There's nowhere in the letter of James that he tells his followers,

638
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:20.060
you have to be circumcised.
There's no worry.

639
00:39:20.070 --> 00:39:21.460
He says you have to keep the sabbath.

640
00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:27.340
What he does say is you've got to take care of the poor.
You have to do justice.

641
00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:28.690
You have to do right things.

642
00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:33.960
So notice how the social situation of James Churches might tell us something

643
00:39:34.181 --> 00:39:39.181
about why he comes to a belief in faith that he does and why he comes to a

644
00:39:39.491 --> 00:39:40.690
belief about works that he does.

645
00:39:40.930 --> 00:39:45.070
Look at James Two one through seven and remember now when I was reading about,

646
00:39:45.380 --> 00:39:47.910
I mentioned Searac,
uh,

647
00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:51.760
and these other wisdom literature that mentioned the poor my brothers do you

648
00:39:51.761 --> 00:39:56.050
with your acts of favoritism that is favoring the rich in your church.

649
00:39:56.650 --> 00:39:59.020
Really believe in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ.

650
00:39:59.890 --> 00:40:02.830
If a person with gold rings and and find clothes come into your assembly,

651
00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:05.500
if a poor person is in dirty clothes also comes in,

652
00:40:05.710 --> 00:40:08.080
you take no notice of the one wearing the fine clothes and say,

653
00:40:08.081 --> 00:40:10.780
have a seat here please.
While to the one who was poor,
you say,

654
00:40:10.781 --> 00:40:12.460
stand there or sit at my feet.

655
00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:16.510
Have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil

656
00:40:16.511 --> 00:40:17.950
thoughts?
Listen,

657
00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:22.980
my beloved brothers has not God chosen the poor in the world to be rich in faith

658
00:40:23.111 --> 00:40:25.690
and to be heirs of the kingdom that he has promised to those who love him,

659
00:40:26.110 --> 00:40:30.280
but you have dishonored the poor.
Is it not the rich who oppress you?
Is it not?

660
00:40:30.281 --> 00:40:33.490
They who drag you into court?
Is it not they who blasts fame?

661
00:40:33.491 --> 00:40:38.050
The excellent name that is invoked over you.
James is written not to the rich.

662
00:40:38.710 --> 00:40:41.650
It's written to the poor and so it's saying,

663
00:40:41.651 --> 00:40:43.900
don't kowtow to the rich and your town.

664
00:40:44.410 --> 00:40:46.510
Don't give them the best places in church.

665
00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:52.140
Look at James Five one two six he gets really heated towards the end of the

666
00:40:52.420 --> 00:40:55.210
sermon because it actually reads more like a sermon than it does a letter.

667
00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.450
Come now you rich people.
Now he's talking to the rich,

668
00:40:59.410 --> 00:41:02.560
but I think he's kind of talking to the rich with the understanding that his

669
00:41:02.561 --> 00:41:06.760
real audience of the poor,
he wants them to overhear him condemned the rich,

670
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:12.670
weep and wail for the miseries that are coming on you.
Your riches have rotted.

671
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:16.120
Your clothes are moth eaten.
Your gold and silver has rested.

672
00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.840
Their rust will be evidence against you and it will eat your flesh like fire.

673
00:41:20.050 --> 00:41:23.380
You have laid up treasure for the last days.
Listen,

674
00:41:23.710 --> 00:41:28.690
the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields,
which you kept back by fraud,

675
00:41:28.691 --> 00:41:33.080
cry out and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of

676
00:41:33.081 --> 00:41:36.320
hosts.
You have lived on the earth in luxury and pleasure.

677
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:38.780
You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.

678
00:41:38.930 --> 00:41:42.350
You have condemned and murdered the righteous one who does not resist you.

679
00:41:43.970 --> 00:41:48.970
James is written to a Christian community that's apparently either very Jewish

680
00:41:50.750 --> 00:41:53.420
or he himself is writing from a very Jewish kind of point of view.

681
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:58.220
And he uses this wisdom tradition of Jewish literature that's already very well

682
00:41:58.221 --> 00:42:01.880
known by the time you've got all kinds of books in this kind of wisdom
tradition.

683
00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.580
And he uses common sayings,
but notice what kind of context he's writing.

684
00:42:05.830 --> 00:42:09.290
He's writing in a context where most of the,
the members of this church are poor,

685
00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:10.333
not wealthy,

686
00:42:10.910 --> 00:42:14.720
and he's riding to condemn the rich for not taking that into account.

687
00:42:15.050 --> 00:42:18.440
So when James says you can't have,

688
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:20.990
you can't be saved by faith apart from works.

689
00:42:21.290 --> 00:42:24.380
What are the work she's talking about justice.

690
00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:25.860
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

691
00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:30.860
<v 0>It started like that bumper sticker that says you can't have peace without</v>

692
00:42:31.041 --> 00:42:35.240
justice.
Some people running around the world saying,
Oh,
let's have pizza.

693
00:42:35.241 --> 00:42:36.650
Let's have peace,
let's have peace.
Well,

694
00:42:36.651 --> 00:42:40.820
it's easy to say if you're rich or you're middleclass.

695
00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.440
But if you're poor and you're oppressed than just hotter,

696
00:42:45.470 --> 00:42:47.090
hollering about peace all the time.

697
00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:50.640
Doesn't sound very just does it.

698
00:42:51.540 --> 00:42:52.020
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

699
00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:56.490
<v 0>So the bumper sticker,
if you want peace work for justice.</v>

700
00:42:56.820 --> 00:42:57.870
That's where James's,

701
00:42:58.230 --> 00:43:02.130
so what works for James doesn't is not talking too much about circumcision.

702
00:43:02.131 --> 00:43:06.330
The sabbath keeping kosher like it seems to Ben.
For Paul,

703
00:43:06.600 --> 00:43:09.360
what he's talking about is you have to have justice.

704
00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:15.270
So it's almost as if the writer of James is in a social situation where he

705
00:43:15.271 --> 00:43:19.620
didn't have the luxury of teaching salvation by faith alone.

706
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:27.600
He needed to talk about what you needed to do to supplement your belief that God

707
00:43:29.021 --> 00:43:33.190
exists with pursuing justice toward the poor.

708
00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.990
That means that,
and here's the debate among scholars.

709
00:43:40.030 --> 00:43:44.230
Some people have given this answer of why James and Paul don't really disagree,

710
00:43:45.130 --> 00:43:47.260
because as some of you already picked up,

711
00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:51.310
they're working with what seemed to be different definitions of both faith and

712
00:43:51.311 --> 00:43:52.144
works,

713
00:43:53.380 --> 00:43:58.380
but clearly James thinks he's disagreeing with some kind of version of

714
00:44:00.461 --> 00:44:03.970
Christianity that looks an awful lot like Paul's letters.

715
00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:09.280
James May think he's disagreeing with Paul even.
It's hard to say.

716
00:44:09.281 --> 00:44:10.480
He doesn't ever mention by name,

717
00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:15.130
but this rider may indeed think he's disagreeing with another form of

718
00:44:15.131 --> 00:44:19.750
Christianity that he may view as dangerous because if it teaches you that you're

719
00:44:19.751 --> 00:44:22.690
justified by faith alone,
apart from works,

720
00:44:23.350 --> 00:44:25.690
then that may let a lot of rich people off the hook.

721
00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.620
They don't have to do anything to prove their faith.

722
00:44:31.020 --> 00:44:34.980
So James and Paul May indeed still being something of a disagreement,

723
00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:39.060
although you can see how they wouldn't be disagreed with each of the quite

724
00:44:39.061 --> 00:44:42.390
directly.
But James is operating in a system,

725
00:44:42.391 --> 00:44:46.740
in a situation where it's almost as if he looks at some gospel that says,

726
00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.800
you're not saved by works.
You're saved by faith.
And he says,
well,

727
00:44:49.801 --> 00:44:53.970
that's nice and convenient for those people who don't want to work for justice.

728
00:44:54.990 --> 00:44:59.990
So he writes his letter giving actually even interpreting the same verses from

729
00:45:00.031 --> 00:45:02.100
genesis that Paul had used,

730
00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:07.080
but using them to emphasize justice as the work that has to supplement your

731
00:45:07.081 --> 00:45:10.680
faith rather than an idea that you're saved by faith alone.

732
00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:16.230
So does he disagree with Paul?
Maybe yes,
maybe.
No.

733
00:45:16.770 --> 00:45:21.570
Maybe it's a little bit of both.
Does he have a different view of law?
Maybe yes,

734
00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:22.493
maybe.
No.

735
00:45:23.010 --> 00:45:28.010
That's for you to decide and to write your paper about this week are make

736
00:45:29.671 --> 00:45:33.000
scintillating comments and your discussion sections,

737
00:45:34.830 --> 00:45:39.450
questions,
