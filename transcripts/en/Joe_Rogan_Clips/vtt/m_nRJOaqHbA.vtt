00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.550
What did you think of the Pico fight?
Oh Man.
So unfortunate.
Crazy,
right?

2
00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.310
Because he's just,

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.570
he's such a killer that he wants to knock everyone out.

4
00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.490
Not only does he want to be the best fighter in the world,

5
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:13.410
but he wants to be the most entertaining fighters in the world.

6
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:16.710
So he's looking to punish you because he's got so many weapons that he doesn't

7
00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:19.620
use.
Um,
he's so good man.
Um,

8
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.650
but he lives by the sword and he dies by the sword kind of thing.
You know,

9
00:00:22.651 --> 00:00:23.640
he wants to be that,

10
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.680
that knock you out entertaining fight or he wants to be able to show a highlight

11
00:00:28.681 --> 00:00:32.670
reel,
first round knockouts,
you know,
um,
which is great.
Yeah.

12
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.380
But you always have to understand that you are just like the guy right in front

13
00:00:37.381 --> 00:00:42.090
of you.
Yeah.
And then one shot,
especially in MMA,
one shot can turn it all around.

14
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.923
And it did.

15
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.290
It was one of the most shocking knockouts or think I've ever seen because it

16
00:00:46.291 --> 00:00:48.180
looked like he looked fucking phenomenal.

17
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:50.880
He came out there and we knew that he had been trading with you for this fight.

18
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.920
Who was fucking shredded.
He looked like a world beater.
Yeah.

19
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.360
Went out there and landing that clean up or caught and then got just way carried

20
00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:58.194
away.
Yup.

21
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.740
And it's unfortunate because you think I'm in shape and I do crazy things.

22
00:01:01.741 --> 00:01:05.220
This guy's putting me to shame like at in Sam's garage,

23
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:08.700
but he's able to do on the bike and just his workout regimen and like just how

24
00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:11.880
competitive he is.
Man.
He's a,
he's a world beater.

25
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:13.920
He could be by far will champion,
you know,

26
00:01:13.921 --> 00:01:16.080
there's some things that he's so young,

27
00:01:16.081 --> 00:01:18.060
so there's some things we need to get to figure out.

28
00:01:18.061 --> 00:01:20.190
Everyone takes losses and uh,
help them.

29
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.550
One of these is going to spark him to realize how good he is everywhere,

30
00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.080
you know?
And uh,
it's just an unfortunate situation.
MMA.
Yeah.

31
00:01:28.081 --> 00:01:32.280
I mean guys have bounced back from knockouts and become world champions

32
00:01:32.281 --> 00:01:33.330
unquestionably.
It's just,

33
00:01:33.331 --> 00:01:35.700
he's got to make sure it doesn't have too many of those,
you know,

34
00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:37.260
and make sure we fight smart.

35
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.280
The grade [inaudible] use that goddamn wrestling too.
It's insane risks.
I mean,

36
00:01:41.281 --> 00:01:44.370
he's so good as a wrestler and when he gets that guy hurt,

37
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.310
he's collar tie there.

38
00:01:46.311 --> 00:01:49.150
They're grabbing each other by neck and just swinging shots.
You're,

39
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.240
you're flipping a coin,

40
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.130
you're rolling the dice once he got six fights or something like that.
Yeah.

41
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.220
I mean,
it's one of those inexperienced things and he's only 22.
Yeah.
I mean,

42
00:01:56.221 --> 00:01:59.250
that's the other thing.
And you realize like when he dropped me,

43
00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:01.710
could've jumped on him.
He could have swarmed him like Hillary did to me,

44
00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.000
you know,
like jump on them and swarm them and look for that finish.
But,
um,

45
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.780
definitely I think the inexperienced kind of makes him realize like maybe he's

46
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:12.900
invincible and just,
I don't know,
man.
There's,

47
00:02:12.901 --> 00:02:14.980
there's things that you kind of figure out when you've been out in the cage and

48
00:02:14.981 --> 00:02:16.380
longer and longer,
and you've been around the crew,

49
00:02:16.381 --> 00:02:19.440
you understand there's ways to finish a fight or,
or how to,

50
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.560
how to just be a smart fighter.
Yeah.
They,
he'll figure out.
