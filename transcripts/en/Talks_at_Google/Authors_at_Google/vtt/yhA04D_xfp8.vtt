00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
&gt;&gt; Hi, everyone. I'm Ario from the Authors
at Google program.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.581
And it's -- very happy to introduce Scott
Berkun today, who's our speaker.

00:00:06.581 --> 00:00:11.700
He's going to be talking about public speaking.
And he's famous for just having great pieces

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.430
that he writes on his blog.
And he's written three excellent books for

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.480
O'Reilly.
So please give him a warm welcome.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.350
And I'll hand it off to Scott.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.350
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.570
Scott Berkun: How are you doing?
You hear me okay? Volume good?

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.320
Loud enough in the back?
Still awake? Good. Excellent. Okay.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.000
So, my first confession I want to share with
you is that I am not an extrovert.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.770
I am not someone who -- at the age of five
 -- told my mom, "I want to be a public speaker

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:42.770
when I grow up."
That is not who I am.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.730
And the fact that I've written a book about
public speaking is kind of an odd story.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.060
And the story goes something like this: I
actually believe in ideas.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:56.040
I'm a creative person.
I believe in ideas and learning about ideas

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.690
and sharing them and trying to think better
and share stuff that I find that's important

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.589
or can make the world better.
That is why I quit my job to write books.

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.050
But a funny thing happens when you do anything
interesting.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:11.430
A funny thing happens when you write books
is that people want you to talk about the

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.100
stuff that you've written.
And in all the stuff that I've done about

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.320
the history of innovation, a lot of my work
is on creative thinking and the history of

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.500
how ideas become things and affect the world.
Is that's one of the threads that runs through

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.120
all those stories too.
Is that if you invent a cure for a disease

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.140
 -- if you create something that earns a patent
 -- eventually someone's going to want you

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.071
to come and talk about those ideas.
And the quality how you talk about your ideas

00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:39.520
is going to affect how they perceive the quality
of the actual ideas themselves.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.930
So, I've sort of stumbled backwards into becoming
a public speaker.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.600
And then, I recognize that -- if you care
about ideas and you care about progress, that

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.090
eventually your communication skills are really
the gaining factors to what you can make happen

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.119
in the world.
So I quit my job. I used to work at Microsoft.

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.780
I worked on Internet Explorer in the early
days.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.659
But I quit my job at Microsoft in 2003 to
write books.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:04.040
And as a side effect of writing books that
have had the good fortune to be successful,

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.639
I've done lots and lots of public speaking.
I've been on national television. I've been

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.329
on NPR.
I've been flown all over the world to give

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:16.959
lectures on stuff basically that I had written
about, which -- if you think about it -- is

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.680
a really kind of lousy reason to hire someone
to speak.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.889
Because just because you can write well has
almost no bearing on the fact that you can

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.680
speak well.
So over the course of the last ten years or

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.659
so, I've probably given hundreds of lectures.
I've taught college courses. I've taught workshops.

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:35.519
I've been on all different kinds of media.
And because I care about ideas, I've become

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.419
someone who cares a lot about communication.
And I felt like, of all the books I had seen

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:43.900
or come across about public speaking, they
all tend to be very dry and kind of generic.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.930
And I know, from my own mistakes, that I have
all these fantastic stories of doing really

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:50.809
stupid, embarrassing things in front of other
people.

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:53.319
And I've learned from those mistakes how to
do this stuff well.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:59.049
And that's what the book is about.
It's a capturing of all the stuff that I have

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.549
talked about -- all the stuff that has gone
wrong for me and what the lessons are that

00:03:02.549 --> 00:03:05.360
can be learned from anyone else.
You know, for any of you who are following

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.659
online -- any Twitterers here -- any Twitter
users, anybody? Couple of you.

00:03:09.659 --> 00:03:13.799
If you want to tweet as we're going, you want
to blog as we're going, you want to take pictures

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.549
of me or send smoke signals, you're free to
use whatever media you want at all, because

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.599
I'm here promoting the book.
So feel free to distract yourself from what

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:25.669
I'm saying if you're going to talk about what
I'm doing to people who aren't here.

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:32.419
You know, the first thing you should know
about public speaking is that, we are all

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.549
public speakers.
That everyone speaks all the time.

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:39.400
And on average -- the average American says
about 12,000 words a day.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.819
12,000 words a day.
Now, of course, since there's no actual, average

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.459
person, there's probably no one person who
just says 12,000 words.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.430
Some people say as few as five.
Some people say as many as 20.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.370
We all have a friend who probably says more
than 20,000 words a day that we'd rather that

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.540
they didn't.
But we're all speakers.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.049
And in our ordinary lives, the fact that you
have a job, the fact that you have friends,

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:04.079
the fact that you have a girlfriend or boyfriend
 -- the only way that you communicate to share

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:07.839
a life with them is through speaking and telling
stories and explaining what it is you're trying

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:11.900
to do with your life.
So we are all inherently good speakers.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.510
Anyone who's listening to this conversation,
listening to me talk right now, we're all

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:18.010
good speakers.
The problem, though, is as soon as you get

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.430
into a environment where you are like I am
right now -- at the front of the room with

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.730
a microphone with a bunch of people who you
don't know staring at you -- all the dynamics

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.170
start to change.
It gets kind of weird now.

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.690
You feel judged. You feel you're going to
be challenged.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.660
You feel vulnerable.
And because of those feelings, your natural

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.070
abilities to tell stories and to communicate
clearly -- diminishes.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.000
The other problem that we have when it comes
to public speaking is that most of the public

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.720
speaking that we experience in our lives -- in
high school and in college -- is really bad.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.010
Like, most public speaking is bad. It's boring;
it's dull.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.930
There's a reason why the word 'lecture' is
not a compliment.

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.940
It's kind of an insult. It's a pejorative.
People say, "Stop lecturing me."

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.650
So we know that there's all these bad habits
that most people have when they speak.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.480
But whenever it's our turn -- whenever most
people get the opportunity to be up in front

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.320
of a room, the thing they do is repeat all
the same mistakes they saw other people do,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.750
because they think that's just how it's done.
So what I'm going to do for the next 20 minutes

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:20.000
or so, I'm going to give a very -- I'm going
to pick the stuff that most bad speakers do,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.380
and explain to you how not to do it, which
is the easiest, most 'low-hanging fruit' way

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:31.300
in the world to get better at being a speaker.
And the first one -- actually, before I jump

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.900
into the first one -- these are the six I'm
going to talk about.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.530
It'll take me about 25 minutes to get through
all this stuff.

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.880
And then, we'll have about 20 minutes or so
for Q and A.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:46.340
So as I'm going along, if I'm not talking
about the thing you hoped I would talk about

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.660
when you came into this room, keep that in
the back of your mind, and we'll have plenty

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.710
of time at the end to talk about those things
that I didn't get to.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.490
So these are the six things that most bad
speakers do.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:01.830
Now, the first one is the obvious one, which
has to do with fear of public speaking.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:07.620
So how many of you get nervous before you
give a pitch or talk at a meeting or give

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:09.481
a lecture?
How many of you have a fear of public speaking,

00:06:09.481 --> 00:06:14.070
just raise your hand.
Okay. So that's about seventy percent of you.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:19.710
So the rest of you are liars. You are liars.
And the reason you are liars is not necessarily

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:23.740
because you're fully aware that you're lying,
but there's a fact -- it's biological -- that

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:26.520
explains the fear response people have when
they're speaking.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:29.700
And it has to do with the oldest part of your
brain called the 'amygdala', which is in the

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.120
core of your brain.
It's about the size of a peanut.

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.890
And it's kind of scary when you think about
it -- this tiny part of your brain -- that's

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:40.960
what controls a lot of really important stuff:
Controls your heart rate, controls your adrenaline,

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:44.900
fight or flight response stuff.
And we have very little control over it -- by

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.110
design. By design.
Because the amygdala thinks it's smarter than

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:53.100
you are.
Now, evolutionarily speaking, millions of

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.840
years ago, hundreds of thousands of years
ago -- that's where the program for the amygdala

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.100
was generated -- if you were a creature standing
alone on the field in front of a large crowd

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:05.700
of other creatures who were staring at you
that you didn't know, that would be bad.

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:08.260
That would mean you're going to die or you're
going to get eaten.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.340
That's what it would mean -- one of those
two things.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:15.870
So the creatures who found this cool, and
had a positive response to this, stuck around

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:19.380
and died.
Those ancestors no longer are around anymore.

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:23.380
The ones who were afraid of it -- who were
freaked out by that kind of environment -- are

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.850
the ones who run away.
And those are our great grandparents and great

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:30.139
grandparents, grandparents whatever.
We are descended from that line of genetics.

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:33.810
So that means that, whenever you get up in
front of a crowd -- whenever you're going

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:37.710
to pitch an idea to someone, even if it's
in a small group -- you're going to feel that

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:41.310
fight or flight response kick in.
Because biologically, your body's telling

00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:46.470
you, based on millions of years of programming,
"This is bad. This is dangerous."

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.320
So you can't control that.
You can not entirely control that.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:55.940
And in all the research I did for the book,
I could not find a single example -- not one

00:07:55.940 --> 00:08:01.160
example -- of a famous performer, a rock star,
an athlete, anyone who performs regularly

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:05.040
in front of crowds, that did not admit they
got nervous before they performed.

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:10.520
It's a universal fact, because it's biological.
What this means, though, if you're going to

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.639
speak -- it means that sometimes you'll be
nervous for reasons that have nothing to do

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:17.490
with how smart you are, nothing to do with
how well you prepared.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:20.210
It's a physiological response that you can
not control.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:24.370
So the first thing you have to do then is,
acknowledge, "Okay, I am going to be nervous.

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:28.050
I can't shut that off.
I have to take responsibility for all the

00:08:28.050 --> 00:08:31.470
things that I can take care of.
I have to take responsibility for those."

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:36.019
You know, the first one, which is really obvious
 -- if you think about it -- is, if your body

00:08:36.019 --> 00:08:39.370
is going to have a physiological response,
you want to make sure you get exercise that

00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:42.240
day.
The average American gets way below what their

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.100
genetic disposition is for how much exercise
they need to get.

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:49.990
So if you actually exercise your body that
morning and exhaust your body's natural fear

00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:54.350
response energy -- that nervous energy -- you'll
be way calmer, because your body's calmed

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:57.170
down.
So, it's physiological -- physiological problem

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:01.519
 -- solve it through physiological means.
The other thing you have to think about are

00:09:01.519 --> 00:09:05.550
all the things that are within your control,
which means like getting to the place early,

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.410
which helps your body calm down that you're
in the environment that you're going to be

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.089
speaking in.
Or whatever material you use, you have to

00:09:11.089 --> 00:09:13.209
practice it.
All this stuff that people tend to discount

00:09:13.209 --> 00:09:16.112
as being irrelevant to the fear.
Those are things you can control, you have

00:09:16.112 --> 00:09:22.600
to make sure that you take care of those things.
You know, the second thing that many speakers

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:28.260
do that's a problem is that they allow themselves
to be perceived as never having done what

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:32.510
they're doing before that they make it look
like it's their first time.

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:34.829
And no one in the world wants to be a guinea
pig.

00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:39.170
No one wants to feel like they are the experiment.
This is the first time this guy's ever done

00:09:39.170 --> 00:09:41.779
this demo.
That's why he hasn't figured out how it works.

00:09:41.779 --> 00:09:44.069
And he's going to spend ten minutes fiddling
with his laptop.

00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:48.269
No one wants to feel that way.
And, although it's more of a superficial complaint

00:09:48.269 --> 00:09:53.029
about speakers in general, if you take the
time to make sure that you practice all the

00:09:53.029 --> 00:09:57.199
things that you do so it seems natural to
you, it makes it much easier for people to

00:09:57.199 --> 00:10:00.931
follow along with whatever it is you're saying.
So it's an obligation you have if you're speaking.

00:10:00.931 --> 00:10:05.139
Now, I have about -- there's probably about
a hundred people in this room right now.

00:10:05.139 --> 00:10:09.329
And there's only one of me.
If I'm going to spend an hour talking, that

00:10:09.329 --> 00:10:12.149
means there's a hundred hours that have been
spent by you listening.

00:10:12.149 --> 00:10:17.329
If I'm looking to practice for a couple of
hours, then I am creating "public speaking

00:10:17.329 --> 00:10:20.490
hour debt."
Because there's 97 or 99 hours are being spent

00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.339
by you and only one that's spent by me.
If I don't practice, I'm effectively telling

00:10:24.339 --> 00:10:28.449
you, "My one hour is more important than your
99," which is really an offensive kind of

00:10:28.449 --> 00:10:32.540
way to think about public speaking.
So anything you do -- anything you're going

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:35.699
to talk about, anything you're going to show
 -- you have to practice it.

00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:38.839
So at least it feels natural to you, and it
makes it easier for people who are going to

00:10:38.839 --> 00:10:44.230
follow along with whatever it is that you're
going to say.

00:10:44.230 --> 00:10:46.980
My third point has to do with rhythm.
Are any of you guys musicians?

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:51.569
Even amateur musicians? Anyone play guitar?
What do you play in the back?

00:10:51.569 --> 00:10:52.980
A I play guitar.

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.149
Scott Berkun: Any drummers? Percussion? No
drummers.

00:10:56.149 --> 00:11:00.060
We'll have to rely on you then, my friend.
Do you play rhythm guitar?

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.060
A Sometimes.

00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:05.259
Scott Berkun: Okay, there we go.
So, it turns out -- and you'll know this -- it

00:11:05.259 --> 00:11:09.139
turns out that most -- we are all rhythmic
creatures.

00:11:09.139 --> 00:11:14.430
We all have a heart rate that's relatively
constant that gives us a steady pace for how

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:18.889
we absorb all the information that's out there
when we're trying to pay attention.

00:11:18.889 --> 00:11:24.029
There's a beat that exists just within us.
And one of the main problems in most lectures

00:11:24.029 --> 00:11:27.689
 -- in most public speaking -- is that the
pace is always really slow.

00:11:27.689 --> 00:11:31.620
Lectures are boring, because the pace is slow.
And that's a problem.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:35.930
But what's worse than a slow lecture is a
slow lecture that's erratic.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:40.199
So I have a picture up here of a turtle for
a reason.

00:11:40.199 --> 00:11:44.269
So, turtles are slow. No argument there.
Anyone want to argue about that?

00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:47.629
Turtle's slow? Turtles are slow.
I've never seen a fast turtle.

00:11:47.629 --> 00:11:52.619
The only thing worse -- and I know in my life,
sometimes I get frustrated from standing behind

00:11:52.619 --> 00:11:55.279
someone in line who's slow, because I'm waiting
for them to do their thing.

00:11:55.279 --> 00:11:59.019
I got to get past them.
The only thing that's worse than being behind

00:11:59.019 --> 00:12:02.589
a turtle is being behind a turtle that's on
drugs.

00:12:02.589 --> 00:12:09.959
So a turtle on drugs is still slow.
You're not going to fix that through biochemistry.

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:15.800
But turtle on drugs is now going to be erratic.
So it's slow and erratic, which is much worse.

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.010
Because slow and predictable means you at
least know, "Okay, it's going to take a certain

00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:21.439
amount of time for this guy to get through
his stuff and then he's going to move on to

00:12:21.439 --> 00:12:23.899
the next thing."
Slow and unpredictable means you're going

00:12:23.899 --> 00:12:27.050
to have this kind of experience where you're
going to be in the audience -- someone's in

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:30.580
the audience -- you're going like, "He's been
going for 20 minutes like, has he started

00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:33.749
yet?
What is he talking about?" That's a turtle

00:12:33.749 --> 00:12:36.399
on drugs.
It's someone who's not figured out that there's

00:12:36.399 --> 00:12:39.740
pace and rhythm that's important anytime someone's
speaking.

00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.360
And if the person speaking isn't controlling
the pace and the rhythm in some way, it's

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:48.360
very difficult for people to follow along.
In doing research for the book, one of the

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:52.860
angles I took was to dig up all the research
that's been done about lecturing and all the

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:58.230
cognitive psychology and the cognitive science
about what goes on in our brains when we're

00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:02.610
listening to lectures.
And to condense that down in a fairly unscientific

00:13:02.610 --> 00:13:08.160
and made-for-television kind of way, the best
basic rule of thumb about attention is, most

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.059
people on average can pay attention for about
five to ten minutes.

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:15.879
That's a sweet-spot number for if you're going
to make a rough assumptions about crowds of

00:13:15.879 --> 00:13:18.819
people, that's your number.
Five to ten minutes.

00:13:18.819 --> 00:13:22.220
So that means if ever you're giving a lecture,
it's going to be a half hour, or you're giving

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:26.100
a talk, or anything that goes longer than
that, you have to be thinking about how to

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:30.459
construct your material in units of five to
seven minutes, creating a rhythm that's going

00:13:30.459 --> 00:13:34.559
to be easier for people to follow along with.
Very basic.

00:13:34.559 --> 00:13:38.879
One mistake most people make, though, is when
you're doing a presentation or giving a pitch

00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:44.200
or -- you usually use a keynote or Powerpoint.
Who here has used keynote or Powerpoint in

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.600
the last week?
Okay. Most of you, right?

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:52.489
The flaw is, people usually think then in
terms of slides.

00:13:52.489 --> 00:13:56.470
How many slides am I going to have?
But a slide is not a measure of time.

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.670
So if you're thinking about your presentation,
"Oh, yeah.

00:13:58.670 --> 00:14:02.389
I got 30 slides. That seems about right."
You could end up spending 20 minutes talking

00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:07.489
about one slide, or maybe go quickly through
30 slides and only do that within five minutes.

00:14:07.489 --> 00:14:13.300
So you have to be thinking about the pace
chronologically rather than in terms of the

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:16.220
content material.
You're trying to make it easy for people to

00:14:16.220 --> 00:14:19.720
follow along through what you're going to
say.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:24.149
The other bit of research that I dug up, which
is pretty fun -- although lecturing is the

00:14:24.149 --> 00:14:29.709
dominant form of communication that teachers
use and professors have used for probably

00:14:29.709 --> 00:14:33.970
hundreds of years, there's been very little
research done as to what's actually going

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:36.920
on physiologically for people who are in the
audience.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:41.069
So there's this guy Bly, who's a professor
and a researcher who wrote this excellent

00:14:41.069 --> 00:14:46.370
book about all the science behind teaching.
And in the book, he explains a study that

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.940
he did that no one had ever done before.
He's a professor, and he's like, "Hey, I want

00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.110
to find out what's actually going on for people
who are listening to lectures."

00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:59.079
So he took his class -- college students -- strapped
them all up to heart rate monitors, and then

00:14:59.079 --> 00:15:02.949
lectured to them.
And this is what happened, you know.

00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:06.199
Not a surprise, because most of you probably
went to college and you fell asleep in at

00:15:06.199 --> 00:15:08.660
least one class.
I'm sure how many fell asleep in at least

00:15:08.660 --> 00:15:11.689
one class.
Yeah, this is part of the process, right,

00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:13.389
we know?
But there's actually data.

00:15:13.389 --> 00:15:17.220
He's like, "Look, your bodies are clearly
not built to be lectured to."

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.619
We're built to hunt and gather and do all
kinds of active things.

00:15:20.619 --> 00:15:24.490
And sitting and listening is entirely passive.
So this means, if you're a speaker -- and

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:28.749
again, you're speaking for a length of time
 -- you have to do something to help people's

00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:33.100
natural physiology work with you rather than
against you.

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:37.639
So instead of being a turtle on crack or turtle
on drugs where you have an inconsistent rhythm,

00:15:37.639 --> 00:15:42.279
"It doesn't really make any sense," you need
to be constructing your stuff with a pace

00:15:42.279 --> 00:15:46.639
that, at least, is clear to you.
Preferably, it's clear to whoever you're talking

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:48.049
to.
You're telling them, "I've got five things

00:15:48.049 --> 00:15:50.339
to say.
I'm going to spend 30 minutes going through

00:15:50.339 --> 00:15:52.970
those five."
Then, at least, people know there's a pace

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:57.249
they can follow.
One trick -- one question I get asked a lot

00:15:57.249 --> 00:16:03.439
is, What to do when people start losing interest?
What do you do when people start tuning out?

00:16:03.439 --> 00:16:05.179
And my answer to that question is always the
same.

00:16:05.179 --> 00:16:11.309
It's like, "People tune out all the time."
Especially today, in 2009, with all the things

00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:14.949
we can carry with us that are fun distractions.
People tune out all the time.

00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:16.639
Or they start thinking about, "Wait, did I
walk the dog this morning?

00:16:16.639 --> 00:16:19.790
I can't remember." Or "What am I going to
have for dinner tonight?"

00:16:19.790 --> 00:16:23.829
All these things that run through people's
minds. And that's fine.

00:16:23.829 --> 00:16:28.300
But if you don't provide a rhythm, you don't
provide a pace, then when they tune out, they're

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:31.799
probably gone for the entire lecture, or the
entire talk.

00:16:31.799 --> 00:16:36.040
If you provide some kind of rhythm, then you
give a trigger that they'll hear.

00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:38.119
They'll go, "Oh, wait. Oh, right. I'm in a
lecture now.

00:16:38.119 --> 00:16:40.610
What is he talking about? Oh, he moved on
to the next point. Okay."

00:16:40.610 --> 00:16:43.679
And there's some way for them to come back
in.

00:16:43.679 --> 00:16:47.019
You never want to be in a position where you
go on for 30 minutes and people who've tuned

00:16:47.019 --> 00:16:54.749
out, they have no way they could possibly
come back in and join the rest of the crowd.

00:16:54.749 --> 00:16:59.730
And speaking of crowds -- I mentioned earlier
on, I sort of gave you a compliment for being

00:16:59.730 --> 00:17:02.270
a human being and that "We're all good at
speaking."

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:06.089
It's something we all do.
But I have to admit that there are people

00:17:06.089 --> 00:17:11.450
who can make anything boring.
That you could have a super-exciting thing

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:13.339
happen.
You could, I don't know -- you could be in

00:17:13.339 --> 00:17:17.000
a car accident or meet a famous person on
the street who gives you a thousand dollars

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.140
just because he liked you that day.
Some amazing story.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:24.120
And then you go somewhere else and you're
about to tell that story to other people and

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:27.550
your friend starts telling the story, and
he totally blows it.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:31.150
He tells it in the most long-winded way.
Starts talking about what he had for breakfast

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.260
that morning and just rambling on and on.
And you're like, "Oh, my God."

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:39.570
Because you were there and you know what happened.
So it's possible -- despite all of our natural

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:44.370
instincts for communication -- it is possible
to make anything boring.

00:17:44.370 --> 00:17:49.541
Typically, by including too much.
Typically, when you include too much, it makes

00:17:49.541 --> 00:17:52.160
things boring.
If your goal is to be comprehensive, it makes

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:55.250
things boring.
Good stories are never comprehensive.

00:17:55.250 --> 00:17:58.100
Never, ever comprehensive.
They have a narrative. They have a hook.

00:17:58.100 --> 00:18:02.730
They have some line of thinking that's interesting
or piques your curiosity, and they run with

00:18:02.730 --> 00:18:07.230
that hook.
So, the bad news is, there are some people

00:18:07.230 --> 00:18:11.250
 -- and maybe some of you -- I haven't had
anything exciting happen yet with you in the

00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:13.740
room that I can tell you how you would tell
a story about it.

00:18:13.740 --> 00:18:18.550
But, while it's possible that you can make
anything boring, the counterpoint -- which

00:18:18.550 --> 00:18:22.510
is good -- is that it's also possible to make
anything interesting.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:25.650
You can make anything interesting.
And that's what good storytellers do.

00:18:25.650 --> 00:18:27.670
That's what good speakers do.
That's what good salesmen do.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:30.871
They find a way to make the thing they're
talking about interesting to you.

00:18:30.871 --> 00:18:36.760
And I have two tricks for this -- two tricks
that make it easier to do.

00:18:36.760 --> 00:18:41.440
The metaphor that works best is to think of
a pitch -- where you're trying to convince

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:46.130
someone of something or a meeting or presentation
 -- to think of it as a path.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:51.470
You, as the pitcher -- as the presenter -- you're
trying to create a path that people can follow

00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:53.130
along on.
They want to make it so they're interested

00:18:53.130 --> 00:18:57.300
all the way through.
And the metaphor works best when you think

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.870
about, People are going to take the next step
if they're interested.

00:19:00.870 --> 00:19:04.760
The word 'interesting' is probably the best
word when you're thinking about trying to

00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:09.490
keep people's attention.
And there are two easy ways to use that word

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:12.370
to your advantage.
Now, the first one is the easiest, but it's

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:13.590
low-hanging fruit.
It doesn't have a huge payoff.

00:19:13.590 --> 00:19:18.371
And that is, if ever you're trying to convince
someone of something -- you have something

00:19:18.371 --> 00:19:21.490
you want to talk about, some knowledge you
want to share -- you have to make sure you

00:19:21.490 --> 00:19:25.990
found an angle to talk about it that, at least,
you're interested in personally.

00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:30.440
That you found a way to find meaning in whatever
it is, so it matters to you.

00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:35.210
All the research about communication and speaking
and teaching -- there is this factor.

00:19:35.210 --> 00:19:40.151
It's entirely -- I don't want to say 'superficial',
but we put a lot of weight on people's enthusiasm.

00:19:40.151 --> 00:19:44.410
It makes a huge difference.
People's retention -- their ability to pay

00:19:44.410 --> 00:19:48.820
attention, their ability to learn and recall
facts -- goes up when the person who gave

00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.940
those things to them was enthusiastic.
So, how do you become enthusiastic?

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.301
Well, you have to make sure whatever you're
talking about, you found a way to think about

00:19:57.301 --> 00:20:01.570
it -- however boring it might be -- you found
a way to think about it that's at least interesting

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:05.240
to you.
And the trick for this -- one trick -- is

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.290
to think about, instead of the technology
that you're talking about, or the information

00:20:10.290 --> 00:20:13.620
you're talking about, which is kind of abstract
and maybe kind of boring, but to think about

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:15.800
the effect you want that information to have
on the world.

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.920
That it can have an effect that you care about.
And that's the passion that you need to make

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.740
sure carries on through in whatever it is
that you're talking about.

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:26.870
Whether that's a line of code, whether that's
some idea for a product or feature -- think

00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:30.230
about the effect.
It's much easier to get excited about effects

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.980
and people and the effects your idea or that
thing can have on people.

00:20:32.980 --> 00:20:37.580
So that's the easier one.
The harder one, which is the higher payoff,

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:42.760
but requires more work is, to think about
the people who are in the audience and why

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.270
they're there.
Many people when they present -- they give

00:20:46.270 --> 00:20:50.400
a lecture or even when they teach a college
course -- they get wrapped up in themselves.

00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.500
Well, what do I want to talk about?
How should I make this slide? Ooh, this is

00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:57.190
a fun story to tell.
And it becomes very selfish and egocentric,

00:20:57.190 --> 00:21:01.461
which -- if you think about the world from
a design or user experience perspective -- is

00:21:01.461 --> 00:21:04.140
a fatal mistake.
Instead, what you want to do is say, "Hey,

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:05.990
why are these people coming?
They have a thousand other things they could

00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:09.250
do.
Why are they going to sit here and listen?

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:13.020
What are the questions they're likely to have?
What did I put in the description that set

00:21:13.020 --> 00:21:15.800
them up?
What expectations are they going to have?

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:20.540
How do I take all the knowledge or wisdom
or stories that I have and put that in a format

00:21:20.540 --> 00:21:26.170
that's interesting to the people who are coming?"
Does not take a whole lot of work to do this

00:21:26.170 --> 00:21:30.260
 -- especially, if you're speaking somewhere
where there's a host who's invited you in

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:32.800
or it's a conference or it's an event of some
kind.

00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:37.410
They have data about who shows up and why.
How old they are. What degrees they have.

00:21:37.410 --> 00:21:40.240
What background they have.
How many years they've been in the industry.

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.010
Or, there's a thousand questions that you
can ask that all of a sudden feed your thinking

00:21:45.010 --> 00:21:49.280
as to what the artifact of a presentation,
what problem it's intended to solve for the

00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:53.620
people who show up.
Most of the time when you are bored, it means

00:21:53.620 --> 00:21:56.890
the person who's speaking -- and if you're
bored right now, this applies to me as well.

00:21:56.890 --> 00:22:00.900
It means the person who's speaking did not
think carefully enough -- or possibly not

00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:05.410
even at all about why you're here.
Don't ever let that happen to you.

00:22:05.410 --> 00:22:09.980
If you're thinking clear about why people
are there -- even if you don't like public

00:22:09.980 --> 00:22:14.000
speaking, even if you don't think of yourself
as charismatic, even if you talk into your

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.010
shoes -- if you're talking about stuff people
really care about, they will pay attention.

00:22:18.010 --> 00:22:24.460
You know, a simple trick is to think about
 -- people talk all the time about how to

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:27.280
keep people's attention as if there's some
gimmick to it.

00:22:27.280 --> 00:22:31.100
But, if I went -- if this lecture -- if I
were to switch gears and say, "What this lecture's

00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:36.160
really about is I'm going to give away $500
million at the end of this lecture and I'm

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:40.750
going to talk for the next 20 minutes about
how I'm going to choose who gets the money."

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:44.440
All of a sudden, it's interesting.
No matter what superficial things as a speaker

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:46.850
I'm not doing well.
On the other end of the spectrum, you could

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:51.400
have Tony Robins or Barack Obama or some great
charismatic speaker, and if you asked him

00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:55.740
to speak for 20 minutes about who's going
to help with his taxes or something, your

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.090
interest level would drop.
So a lot of the whole game is matching the

00:22:59.090 --> 00:23:02.630
stuff that you think you're supposed to share
or you have that's valuable to the people

00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:09.490
who are there and make sure that Venn diagram
is a rich Venn diagram -- that you're covering

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:13.450
both stuff that make it interesting to you,
but also make it interesting to them.

00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.650
So instead of being the kind of guy who tells
these long-winded stories and is comprehensive,

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.860
you've thought about it carefully.
You've at least found a way to make it interesting

00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:23.110
yourself.
Maximally, you've found a way to think about

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:25.110
why people are there, and you're solving those
problems for them.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:29.940
We're on the home stretch now.
I have two more of these.

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.850
So if you're thinking, "Man, he still hasn't
talked about my thing."

00:23:32.850 --> 00:23:35.900
Keep it in mind.
Because we'll have Q and A in about ten minutes.

00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.660
Maybe eight minutes. Seven minutes.
Five minutes. Soon. [laughter]

00:23:40.660 --> 00:23:44.580
So, this point -- it has to do with being
smart.

00:23:44.580 --> 00:23:48.100
And you guys are all smart.
A lot of smart people out there.

00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:52.710
Smart people often make a smart person's mistake
when it comes to presenting a pitch.

00:23:52.710 --> 00:23:58.020
Because there's this habit that many smart
people have of, When you're in an argument

00:23:58.020 --> 00:24:05.990
and you start to lose, you increase the syllable
count per word.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:10.640
Like the vocabulary complexity goes up.
And you're betting, at some point, you'll

00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.090
use a word that the other person doesn't understand.
And since you're in an argument, they're not

00:24:15.090 --> 00:24:18.290
going to say, "I don't know what that means."
They're just going to back out of the argument,

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.190
and you're going to win by like, technical
knock out. [laughter]

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:24.910
That you've now done this, "Okay, you win."
You're like, "Yes."

00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:29.500
Does not actually mean the argument was sound.
It means you used kind of a technicality -- a

00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:34.240
word they didn't know -- to win.
This habit is a defensive way to communicate.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:37.090
You are actually -- literally, you're trying
to push people away.

00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:42.970
And any time I see someone use a lot of jargon
 -- any time I see someone making choices

00:24:42.970 --> 00:24:47.100
where they are picking complex words rather
than simple, even though a simple one is probably

00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.790
just as good, they are saying, "Back off.
I am pushing you away.

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:55.460
I really don't want you to understand.
I don't really want you to follow along on

00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.450
my path.
I'm pushing you away."

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:01.631
That's a response many smart people have when
they're up here, because you feel vulnerable

00:25:01.631 --> 00:25:03.720
up here.
We feel like we're going to be attacked.

00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:09.250
So we want to push people away.
The goal instead, though, of allowing rhetoric

00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:18.520
to be the flaw is to think again about what
the whole purpose of all this is.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.880
If you're actually speaking about something
you care about, then you want people to follow

00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:24.260
along.
If you have an idea you're trying to convince

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.860
someone to adopt or give you money for or
support in some way, you want them to be on

00:25:27.860 --> 00:25:31.620
your side.
So this approach of being complex first is

00:25:31.620 --> 00:25:33.800
never going to work.
Instead, you have to be thinking the opposite

00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:36.580
way.
What's the simplest way I can explain what

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.570
it is my purpose is?
I'm trying to make the world better. Well,

00:25:39.570 --> 00:25:42.032
how?
Whatever the high-level goal is, you have

00:25:42.032 --> 00:25:45.750
to make sure that becomes clear first -- and
enthusiastically.

00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:49.300
And then, you follow up with the things that
are more complex and more advanced, assuming

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:55.050
people can follow along with you.
And I studied philosophy in college.

00:25:55.050 --> 00:26:01.230
And there's this thing about rhetoric that
is very important when it comes to speaking.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:04.610
And it has to do with the difference between
points and arguments.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:09.430
Points and arguments.
A 'point' is the message -- the five things

00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:13.290
you want people to leave with or the actions
you want them to take.

00:26:13.290 --> 00:26:17.450
That's the point of what you're doing.
Whether that's a pitch, whether that's an

00:26:17.450 --> 00:26:22.970
idea pitch, whether that's a status meeting,
there's a set of things you want to make clear.

00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:27.560
And those have to be crystal clear.
There should never be someone who leaves listening

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:32.120
to you and is not clear on what your points
were, which is separate from the arguments

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.260
for those points.
The arguments that support the points, "Okay,

00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.760
maybe people won't agree with those, or be
confused by them.

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:41.770
They didn't fully understand my rationale.
But they should never misunderstand the purpose

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:44.820
that I was trying to get across."
So points and arguments.

00:26:44.820 --> 00:26:49.910
And many times, when you're in a bad lecture
or bad presentation, they've never figured

00:26:49.910 --> 00:26:53.101
out -- the speaker has never thought through
enough to clarify what the points are and

00:26:53.101 --> 00:26:58.110
what the arguments were.
Instead, it's just this, you know, this blob

00:26:58.110 --> 00:27:01.400
of facts and stories and data that doesn't
make any sense.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:05.820
Coherence comes largely from, Before you sit
down and make a slide, writing down what the

00:27:05.820 --> 00:27:09.160
things are you want people to leave with:
The five things they should learn.

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:12.820
The five new ideas they should have.
The five questions they should now be prepared

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:15.530
to answer.
If you don't know what those five things are,

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.680
then there's almost no chance that anyone's
going to leave with anything at all.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.279
So points and arguments.
Make sure your points are clear.

00:27:21.279 --> 00:27:26.080
And I highly recommend not starting in Powerpoint
or keynote when you start a talk, because

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.750
that will largely get you on the track of
putting this stuff in.

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:31.200
It's fun to do.
Makes you feel like you're making progress

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:33.690
quickly, but you really have not thought at
all about your audience.

00:27:33.690 --> 00:27:36.440
You have not thought at all about the things
you want them to leave with.

00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.940
That requires your brain.
No software tool can really do that for you.

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:47.431
Speaking of software and slides.
I'm not a huge believer in slides being the

00:27:47.431 --> 00:27:51.400
problem.
If -- we're almost done here -- if you do

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.220
the four, five things I've talked about already,
then by the time you get to making slides,

00:27:55.220 --> 00:27:58.370
most of your problems that people create with
slides will go away.

00:27:58.370 --> 00:28:02.470
But I have to talk about at least for a minute.
So this is a very typical kind of slide.

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:08.010
This is, you know, a generic template you
can find in almost any presentation tool,

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:11.820
with a bulleted list and a title at the top.
And there are all these rules you might have

00:28:11.820 --> 00:28:14.590
heard about, like, how to do these well.
Seven by seven.

00:28:14.590 --> 00:28:19.030
Has anyone heard of the seven by seven rule?
There's a rule for this, that you're supposed

00:28:19.030 --> 00:28:24.300
to -- if ever you have bullets, you should
have -- this is my bad advice voice -- "If

00:28:24.300 --> 00:28:28.230
ever you have a bulleted slide, you should
have seven bullets and never more than seven

00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:30.210
words per bullet."
Sounds like, "Okay."

00:28:30.210 --> 00:28:34.320
Now, who made this up?
Like, what research did they do on this?

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:36.310
I have no idea, because there probably isn't
any.

00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:41.110
When I see a slide like this, I'm always -- especially
when someone asks me to look at their slide

00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:44.740
deck -- like before they're going to give
a talk -- I know, right off the bat, this

00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:48.370
is someone who has made a bunch of mistakes
we've talked about already.

00:28:48.370 --> 00:28:51.930
First, it probably means they didn't practice.
They don't know what they're going to say.

00:28:51.930 --> 00:28:54.990
So they've listed a whole bunch of stuff in
the hopes that one of those things will make

00:28:54.990 --> 00:29:00.150
sense when they're up here speaking.
Second, if they haven't practiced, it increases

00:29:00.150 --> 00:29:03.570
the odds when there's this much density on
the screen, they're going to do this.

00:29:03.570 --> 00:29:05.370
And they're going to turn and talk to their
slides.

00:29:05.370 --> 00:29:07.540
Because they're almost a conversation.
There's so much language here, they're going

00:29:07.540 --> 00:29:14.320
to end up having a conversation with the slides.
And turning your back on your audience, there's

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:19.450
a whole bunch of very bad things.
I mean, in some countries when you do this,

00:29:19.450 --> 00:29:22.270
you'll get killed. [laughter]
Not appropriate to do.

00:29:22.270 --> 00:29:26.360
And it also -- any energy or enthusiasm, theatrically,
should be directed at the audience.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.950
As soon as you turn -- even if you're just
going back and forth -- it diffuses your energy,

00:29:29.950 --> 00:29:33.730
which is a bad thing to do.
The other problem with this kind of stuff:

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:39.820
Bullet lists tend to make speakers feel like
they are obligated to speak to everything

00:29:39.820 --> 00:29:42.920
on there.
So it becomes comprehensive again.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.500
Now, there's all this stuff that I feel like
"I got to say this" and "I got to say that,"

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:51.220
which is boring and repetitive.
And you're unlikely to be enthusiastic about

00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.220
it.
So when you have this much visual density

00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:55.450
 -- in terms of language, there's a lot of
stuff here -- it usually means they didn't

00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:57.170
practice.
They did not think what their points were,

00:29:57.170 --> 00:30:03.040
right off the bat.
The other end of visual density has to do

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:06.230
with actual, visual, graphic design stuff.
So this is another slide.

00:30:06.230 --> 00:30:09.290
This is an actual slide from the Department
of Defense.

00:30:09.290 --> 00:30:14.180
And it's a report on the Iraqi war from a
couple years ago.

00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:17.261
And when I see this slide -- without knowing
the speaker, without knowing anything about

00:30:17.261 --> 00:30:20.581
it -- I also can make another set of assumptions,
which again, are similar to the first one.

00:30:20.581 --> 00:30:24.220
Does not know what he's going to say when
this is up.

00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:31.150
There's so much data here visually and dimensionally.
I mean, he's got, you know, orange squares

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:35.910
and red squares and gradient squares.
And there's like this huge tree of the complexity

00:30:35.910 --> 00:30:38.820
of stuff here.
You could talk for hours about the data represented

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.140
here, which is not what you want to do when
you're talking.

00:30:42.140 --> 00:30:44.280
That's bad.
That means not clear.

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:47.780
And if I had to make a whole bunch of assumptions
even further, the goal of this meeting to

00:30:47.780 --> 00:30:54.220
show stuff like this is probably the nature
of, "How's it going? Is it going well?"

00:30:54.220 --> 00:30:55.960
Okay, what are the five things that are going
well?

00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:59.170
What are the five things that are not?
What are the dimensions of those things?

00:30:59.170 --> 00:31:01.740
And that's a simple question.
It's an important question, but it's a simple

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.720
question.
This -- don't know what the question is.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.230
Therefore, you don't know what the answer
is.

00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:10.780
Therefore, I can guess, the guy spent a whole
ton of time playing around with Powerpoint,

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.059
getting really excited at how much detail
he put in there, without ever thinking about

00:31:14.059 --> 00:31:17.920
his audience or what he was going to say or
what he wanted them to leave with.

00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:22.890
So, the goal for all the slide stuff, really,
instead of having confused slides or distracting

00:31:22.890 --> 00:31:27.160
slides -- Slides are a prop.
They're in support of whatever it is that

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.870
you're saying.
If you need a bulleted list that actually

00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:31.901
supports you, Great.
I've had bulleted lists in the slide deck

00:31:31.901 --> 00:31:34.420
already.
I'm not saying, "Never use bulleted lists."

00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:39.961
But you have to make sure they are in service
of a higher purpose -- the audience's purpose,

00:31:39.961 --> 00:31:41.890
your purpose, and the point you're trying
to make.

00:31:41.890 --> 00:31:45.910
And never allow them to be the focal point.
When you start out in Powerpoint -- you spend

00:31:45.910 --> 00:31:49.270
hours in there -- you're going to tend to
want to talk about your work, because it's

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:51.360
your thing you're proud of.
You want to show it off.

00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:55.360
No one really is going to care.
They came for reasons they care about that

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.850
have nothing to do with your ability to make
slides or not.

00:31:57.850 --> 00:32:01.130
So those are the six reasons for badness -- for
evil.

00:32:01.130 --> 00:32:08.990
To be less sarcastic or cynical, flip these
over, and these are the positive things that

00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:11.660
I hope that you'll think about next time you
give a talk.

00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:15.760
First, just to summarize, right off the bat.
The amygdala -- you are going to be afraid;

00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:17.380
everyone is.
Can't turn that off.

00:32:17.380 --> 00:32:21.440
You have to control the things you can.
At a minimum, help your body out -- get some

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.050
exercise that morning.
By far, that will make a radical difference.

00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:29.690
You're helping your body deal with the physiological
fears involved in speaking.

00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:31.970
Second, practice.
This is a performance.

00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:35.750
Whether you're pitching or giving a talk in
a small group, you have some idea you're trying

00:32:35.750 --> 00:32:38.820
to convey, there are performance aspects to
having arguments.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:42.130
Even in the small.
If you don't practice it, then you're making

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:44.990
them the guinea pig.
And if you care about your ideas, it's a stupid

00:32:44.990 --> 00:32:47.400
thing to do.
You want to do a dry run. You want to run

00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:50.050
it by people.
Get their feedback on your pitch, how to make

00:32:50.050 --> 00:32:55.130
it sharper or tighter.
Obvious easy thing to do; no technology required.

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.430
Fourth, about being interesting.
Emotion counts. Enthusiasm counts.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:03.140
It's up to you to find a way to make it interesting
yourself when you open your mouth.

00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:07.030
You could have the best idea in the world,
if you seem bored by it, we know from the

00:33:07.030 --> 00:33:10.920
psychology -- from the cognitive psychology
data that we have -- likelihood of people

00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.310
believing you and following your idea goes
down.

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:18.060
And then, lastly, anything you use or show
 -- slides, demos, whatever it is that you

00:33:18.060 --> 00:33:21.340
feel obligated to show -- make sure it really
supports the points.

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:23.460
And make sure it supports the reasons why
people came.

00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:27.170
The slide should be a prop in support of whatever
it is that you're doing.

00:33:27.170 --> 00:33:31.690
So those are my photo credits.
And I'm on a book tour.

00:33:31.690 --> 00:33:34.460
I'm on the tail end of my book tour.
I'm almost done. I've been all over the place.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:37.000
I've been in Boston. I've been in New York.
I've been here all week.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:41.940
And tonight is my last lecture of the year,
which I am so thrilled and excited about.

00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:46.070
And if you think I did an okay job today,
and you know someone else who may want to

00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:50.600
come along and be entertained or learn about
the amygdala and other cool brain science

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.950
stuff, tell them to come along tonight, and
we'll probably have a really good time.

00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:57.480
Because it's going to be -- I get kind of
goofy when it's my last lecture.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:01.591
So with that, I will open the floor for Q
and A.

00:34:01.591 --> 00:34:04.110
And think about -- you guys came here for
a reason.

00:34:04.110 --> 00:34:08.869
And if I didn't give you what you wanted,
we have time now to try and get at it.

00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:18.300
So who wants to start with a question?
Oh, okay. Who's got a question?

00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:22.399
Yeah, sorry, you're going to engage your body
to make a move.

00:34:22.399 --> 00:34:27.790
Q Hi. I'm Charles.
I was kind of interested in something that

00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:32.600
you mentioned, kind of early on, in the presentation.
You said that you made a lot of mistakes kind

00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:38.750
of over your years doing presentations.
So, what are maybe one of the top or the top

00:34:38.750 --> 00:34:42.850
two things that you've done that would be
just like, were stupid mistakes?

00:34:42.850 --> 00:34:45.950
Scott Berkun: Okay. So, the question was top
mistakes.

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:55.670
Well, the biggest one by far is 'not practicing'.
It's easy to see doing this as just something

00:34:55.670 --> 00:34:59.270
that's done.
And until I started practicing before -- well,

00:34:59.270 --> 00:35:02.140
the real story that led me down this path
is why I'm in front of you today.

00:35:02.140 --> 00:35:04.390
I was a manager at Microsoft. I worked on
Internet Explorer.

00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:07.800
And I was asked to give a presentation in
front of about 300 people -- biggest lecture

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:11.730
I'd ever done. And I did it.
And this is probably ten years ago, so I was

00:35:11.730 --> 00:35:15.070
a lot younger then.
And I watched the video of it.

00:35:15.070 --> 00:35:21.580
It was awful. It was just bad.
I came across as angry and unpleasant.

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:25.610
I gave off all the energy in the world of
not wanting to be there, but like pissed at

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:30.090
the audience that I had to be. [laughter]
And I was devastated, but it's not because

00:35:30.090 --> 00:35:34.040
I'm a bad speaker, but again, I believe in
the work my team was doing.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.350
I believe in the stuff we were making.
And I'm up here representing it.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:41.250
And the fact that I behaved that way tainted
whatever it was that I had to show.

00:35:41.250 --> 00:35:47.500
And I felt that was a kind of tragedy.
So that's when I started saying, you know,

00:35:47.500 --> 00:35:51.920
"If I want to work on important stuff.
If I want to have ideas and convince other

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:55.960
people of the stuff, then I have to take responsibility
for how I communicate, because that's how

00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:58.940
these ideas will make their way or not in
the world."

00:35:58.940 --> 00:36:02.680
And so, most of my stories -- and a lot of
the stories in the book -- are what happens

00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:05.240
when you do this a lot.
I mean, I've had everything go wrong.

00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:07.310
I mean, sometimes the mistakes are not your
fault.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:09.520
I've had fire alarms go off in the middle
of talks.

00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:13.690
I've had laptops crash. I've had hecklers.
And, you know, people ask a question that

00:36:13.690 --> 00:36:16.480
goes on for five minutes.
I've had all that stuff happen.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:20.080
And then, I go back, and I'm like, "I got
to get better at this."

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:24.240
So I have gotten a lot better, and the book
is largely what I learned from doing this

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.290
thing.
So, I bet any mistake you can imagine, I probably

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:30.820
done it at some point or another.
But most of the mistakes people worry about

00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:34.540
is stupid.
Like typos. Who cares?

00:36:34.540 --> 00:36:39.300
Like really, this is your big criticism of
my hour -- that I spelled a word wrong?

00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:42.470
Like, c'mon. That's the criticism?
Okay. I'll take that.

00:36:42.470 --> 00:36:45.960
Most of the things people worry about are
trivial things, I think.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:48.360
Yeah. Book for you for asking the first question.

00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:55.540
Q Just got a question about practice.
You were just talking about how you saw yourself

00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:00.110
in a video and that helped sort of trigger
the idea that you needed to get better.

00:37:00.110 --> 00:37:04.230
There's a book by a guy called Daniel Coyle.
I think it was called "The Talent Code," just

00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:06.631
talking about intentional types of practice.

00:37:06.631 --> 00:37:07.631
Scott Berkun: Yeah.

00:37:07.631 --> 00:37:12.800
Q Do you have tips on what are ways to practice
that really kind of extract as much value

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:13.800
out of that process?

00:37:13.800 --> 00:37:17.220
Scott Berkun: Sure, so I can tell you what
I do.

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:21.200
And I recommend it, but you really need to
do it yourself to find what works best.

00:37:21.200 --> 00:37:25.820
The thing that I do is, all the advice I just
offered, I follow -- I think -- most of it.

00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:32.270
And I know that, since I want this to feel
natural, I don't spend hours making a slide

00:37:32.270 --> 00:37:35.480
deck and then start to practice.
That's a fatal -- then I got this thing I

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:38.800
spent hours on, that I don't want to cut.
So I work the other way.

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:43.080
I think on paper -- just my list of points.
What do I think people are going to want to

00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:44.860
know?
Or questions we want to answer.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:47.770
And I fleshed it out a little bit, like a
rough outline.

00:37:47.770 --> 00:37:51.930
And then, I start making slides.
And then, once I have like, you know, five

00:37:51.930 --> 00:37:57.290
slides -- I have a chunk that is like rough
 -- I'll start practicing.

00:37:57.290 --> 00:38:02.470
This is ridiculous. It's embarrassing.
I'll stand up in my office alone, or I'm in

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:06.453
a hotel room alone, and I'll start doing it.
And I'll just go.

00:38:06.453 --> 00:38:09.240
And usually I'll go for a minute, then, I'm
like, "I have no idea what comes next."

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:12.570
But then, I'll sit down and go, "Well, if
I can't get past a minute, then that part

00:38:12.570 --> 00:38:15.180
of my outline needs more fleshing -- I need
to think more about that."

00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.810
And then, I keep going, and I iterate.
And as I'm going, I'm refining my slides.

00:38:18.810 --> 00:38:21.960
When I get stuck.
And then, eventually, I got five or ten minutes

00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:25.250
of material that works.
And once I have that unit, then making the

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:28.210
rest of it's much easier, because I've put
this together.

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:31.390
And that prevents the problem of overdoing
the slides.

00:38:31.390 --> 00:38:36.410
And it enforces me thinking clearly about
each part, because I'm doing it a lot.

00:38:36.410 --> 00:38:39.950
Then, once I get up here, I've actually said
this stuff before.

00:38:39.950 --> 00:38:44.230
And it might not be great, but it's way better
than it was the first time I said it.

00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:49.690
So the more you actually do it -- stand up
and do it -- the better.

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:54.290
A lot of people, they make their slides, and
they sit there and like, flip through.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:57.280
And they're thinking in their head what they're
going to say -- doesn't count.

00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.980
Not practice.
That's thinking about practice.

00:38:59.980 --> 00:39:02.430
Not the same thing.
You have to actually do it.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:03.590
It's physical.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:06.500
Q Sounds like agile development.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:10.201
Scott Berkun: Yeah. No big schedules.
Little pieces. Book for you.

00:39:10.201 --> 00:39:11.850
You want to come up and get it.

00:39:11.850 --> 00:39:13.380
Q Hi Scott.

00:39:13.380 --> 00:39:14.380
Scott Berkun: I know you.

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:19.119
Q I have a couple of questions.
So, the first one is, a lot of times when

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:24.430
we're trying to get ideas across -- and sort
of pitches across -- it's not kind of the

00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:26.360
big lecture halls or it's like the small conference
rooms.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:30.830
It might be just a few people there.
It might be a lot of people on VC.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:35.080
It might be a few people.
The kind of typical thing you do is you stay

00:39:35.080 --> 00:39:37.480
sitting.
What about the energy in those kinds of rooms?

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:38.710
Different from the big room.

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:40.980
Scott Berkun: It's different, but the principles
are the same.

00:39:40.980 --> 00:39:45.240
And our bodies are the same.
So, even though you're sitting down or whatever,

00:39:45.240 --> 00:39:50.800
if you find a way to describe whatever you're
talking about that you're enthusiastic about

00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.000
it, people's attention will tend to remain
on you longer.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:58.340
So if you're bored, well, it's going to hurt
what you're saying.

00:39:58.340 --> 00:40:04.280
So, the principles I think are the same.
This format is extreme. It is more hierarchical.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.311
There's one speaker, and it's less interactive.
It's all true, and that is a difference.

00:40:08.311 --> 00:40:13.011
But, if I'm preparing to talk to five people,
and I know I have these three important things

00:40:13.011 --> 00:40:16.240
I want to say, all the stuff -- the same stuff
works.

00:40:16.240 --> 00:40:20.370
I don't want to make a 50-thing slide deck.
I want to think about what questions am I

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:23.080
going to get asked?
That's actually a question I get a lot about,

00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:27.730
What do you do when people interrupt you?
What do you do? Well, you plan for that.

00:40:27.730 --> 00:40:32.760
If you know who you're presenting with, you
know your audience, who's likely to ask -- you

00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:37.710
know people's hot buttons and you know the
things they most like to go into rat holes

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:41.460
about.
So you plan for that, and you anticipate that.

00:40:41.460 --> 00:40:45.260
And you can't control it completely, but if
you're afraid of that thing, then you practice

00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:47.359
to prepare for those situations.

00:40:47.359 --> 00:40:52.080
Q Okay. My other question is probably on the
other extreme with the -- you probably know

00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:53.600
this one's coming up.
It's about the back channels and the presenting

00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.600
back channels.

00:40:54.600 --> 00:40:56.091
Scott Berkun: Yes, the back channel.

00:40:56.091 --> 00:41:01.580
Q There's been -- so just to put this in context.
There's the big -- usually at the bigger forums

00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:07.040
and there might be some sort of Twitter back
channel going on or other back channels and

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:12.109
sometimes these are presented.
So, what is your take on how a presenter should

00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:14.880
deal with this and kind of vibes from the
audience?

00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:17.670
Scott Berkun: Okay. So the question is -- for
those of you who don't know -- at some conferences

00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:22.670
now, where there's support of Twitter, they
have a screen on -- in some cases behind the

00:41:22.670 --> 00:41:28.350
speaker -- that shows the Twitter stream.
So as people in the audience -- it's up there.

00:41:28.350 --> 00:41:32.960
You can do whatever you want.
And so, there have been some bad experiences

00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:36.460
that speakers have had at some recent conferences.
And I spoke at a conference recently, where

00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.940
they had this up there.
The short answer is that, you never have anyone's

00:41:40.940 --> 00:41:43.480
complete attention anyway.
You never do.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.830
And so, again, if people tune out, they want
to do their laptop.

00:41:45.830 --> 00:41:49.641
It's going to happen. It's just natural.
It's got nothing to do entirely with you.

00:41:49.641 --> 00:41:53.550
The better you are as a speaker -- the better
you match what you're talking about to what

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:57.910
they're interested in, again, the $500 million
thing -- the more likely it is that you can

00:41:57.910 --> 00:42:00.930
keep their attention.
But I know I never have everybody -- Obama

00:42:00.930 --> 00:42:06.020
never has everybody -- no one ever has everybody.
The other challenge is, sometimes the way

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:10.160
the room feels is different from how the room
actually is.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:15.270
That the room can seem cold, but maybe there's
some bad news that was mentioned that morning.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:17.530
Or maybe -- there could be something else
going on in the environment that has nothing

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:20.670
to do with you.
And you have to have a -- kind of tune that

00:42:20.670 --> 00:42:22.130
out.
You're going to do your thing, and you're

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:26.820
listening, but you can't read too much into
how they're responding, unless they're throwing

00:42:26.820 --> 00:42:30.950
things at you.
Now, the Twitter thing -- I'm like, "Great.

00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:34.970
If you guys are bored with me, and you want
to have a side conversation in the background,

00:42:34.970 --> 00:42:37.900
that's fine."
Like, putting it behind me?

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:41.420
You're now putting that in competition with
what I'm trying to do, and that's just unfair.

00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:45.300
I mean, it's hard enough to speak.
There's enough stresses and challenges in

00:42:45.300 --> 00:42:49.109
speaking at all.
This is adding a degree of difficulty, because

00:42:49.109 --> 00:42:56.510
now, I can't even see what it is.
And it allows anyone -- ANYONE -- to participate.

00:42:56.510 --> 00:43:01.230
And I'm all for participation, but 'anyone'?
I mean, it's like heckler fodder.

00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:03.590
You're giving this environment, where they
have an abstract name, where no one might

00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:06.900
even know who they are.
How does that add value?

00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:10.030
So the question I ask about any of that stuff
is, What problem are you trying to solve?

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:14.201
If the problem is people are bored, well,
you probably need better speakers or you need

00:43:14.201 --> 00:43:17.830
to coach the speakers better, so they're more
attuned to what the audience wants.

00:43:17.830 --> 00:43:22.980
Then the need for the back channel is diminished.
Not that it shouldn't exist, but the need

00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:26.500
for it goes away.
Yeah. Yep.

00:43:26.500 --> 00:43:29.630
Q Quick question.
It almost sounds like we should be making

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:34.680
movies, not presentations.
Do you think that's a better way of thinking

00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:38.740
of it?
Of an arc and engaging people's attention

00:43:38.740 --> 00:43:39.740
that way?

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.810
Scott Berkun: Yes and no.
So I believe that, yes, in that you are thinking

00:43:42.810 --> 00:43:46.560
about narrative and story and keeping people
engaged, so absolutely.

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:50.690
But a movie is an artifact. It's a crafted
production.

00:43:50.690 --> 00:43:54.119
And I'm a believer that -- I don't think,
most of the time, that's what people want.

00:43:54.119 --> 00:43:58.830
They want something that feels natural and
authentic and real, because that actually

00:43:58.830 --> 00:44:02.250
keeps your attention better.
If you think that a lot of the stuff that

00:44:02.250 --> 00:44:07.810
people are afraid of -- like their personality
or the fact that they have opinions or they're

00:44:07.810 --> 00:44:11.030
animated, that those are negatives, that it's
unprofessional to do those things.

00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:16.109
And my experience is, it's just the opposite.
So you don't want it to be so polished that

00:44:16.109 --> 00:44:20.251
it's its own -- like it's a work of art.
You want it to serve a purpose, and the audience

00:44:20.251 --> 00:44:23.869
feels like you're a real person who really
believes what you're saying.

00:44:23.869 --> 00:44:29.609
So, I try to find the sweet spot with anything
I use -- I don't want that to overpower -- some

00:44:29.609 --> 00:44:32.660
people make beautiful slides.
Like, they're like beautiful.

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:36.360
You know, they spent hours on this.
And it could be overwhelming.

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:39.830
That can draw way more of your attention away
from the message or the points you're trying

00:44:39.830 --> 00:44:44.500
to make or the reasons people came.
They probably didn't come to see works of

00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:46.930
art on your slides while you're talking about
something else over them.

00:44:46.930 --> 00:44:52.220
It's probably not why they're there.
So I do agree on the movie thing from a narrative

00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:56.650
and functional perspective, but not in the
sense that you should have these perfectly

00:44:56.650 --> 00:45:01.060
constructed, highly produced, theatrical performances
 -- no.

00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:05.550
I think that betrays what most people want
most of the time.

00:45:05.550 --> 00:45:13.920
Q One last question.
The slide that you had up there with the heart

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:14.920
rate and time?

00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:15.920
Scott Berkun: Yeah.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:18.640
Q It also, I think, correlates to another
dimension of attention.

00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.590
So it's 'attention' and 'time'.
Those are the two things that we're dealing

00:45:23.590 --> 00:45:26.180
with.
But we have these artificial constructs.

00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:29.250
There's societal constructs of 60 minute presentations
or meetings --

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:30.440
Scott Berkun: Yes.

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.350
Q -- and we're always bound by that.

00:45:32.350 --> 00:45:33.350
Scott Berkun: Yes.

00:45:33.350 --> 00:45:34.950
Q Are there ways that you've found to be like,
"Screw that.

00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:39.360
I'm going to give my presentation in six minutes?
The meeting is over in 12?"

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:42.760
Scott Berkun: Yeah, no one is ever upset -- ever
 -- that you ended early.

00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.880
Like, never, ever, ever, ever.
Never, ever, ever. Never happens.

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:51.370
There's no recording in the history of the
world the meeting ended early -- except unless

00:45:51.370 --> 00:45:55.470
they paid to be there, right?
I saw a lecture by David Mamet, the screenwriter.

00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:59.750
And he spoke -- and I paid money to see this.
He spoke for like 35 minutes, and said, "Well,

00:45:59.750 --> 00:46:02.200
I don't want to take up more of your time."
[Pshuu!] He's gone.

00:46:02.200 --> 00:46:06.950
I was like, "What the fuck?" [laughter]
Like, you know, "I paid money. I want more,

00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:09.430
you know?"
But in general, less is better.

00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:12.570
Always less is better.
And the best thing to do is what I try to

00:46:12.570 --> 00:46:16.630
do here -- maybe it worked, maybe it didn't.
25 minutes is a decent chunk of time.

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:18.950
Give people enough like, Is this guy credible
or not?

00:46:18.950 --> 00:46:22.410
Then I open the floor.
If there were no questions, that's a vote

00:46:22.410 --> 00:46:25.210
of, "We're done."
If there are questions, that means -- at least

00:46:25.210 --> 00:46:28.160
for some people -- there's more they wanted,
let's keep going.

00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.640
So I'm always like, "I'll keep going as long
as people have questions.

00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:34.560
There's no questions, well, I don't want to
bore you anymore.

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.550
Let's go."
So standing meetings.

00:46:36.550 --> 00:46:40.220
Have you heard of 'standing meetings.'?
Similar principle, right? Yeah.

00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:43.511
Q So we have about ten more minutes left.
I wanted to ask a question.

00:46:43.511 --> 00:46:46.920
And then, if anybody's on VC and wanted to
ask something, you can jump in right after

00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:48.820
Scott's finished with the answer on this.

00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:49.820
Scott Berkun: Okay.

00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:53.210
Q So the name of the book is "Confessions
of a Public Speaker," which sort of 'confessions'

00:46:53.210 --> 00:46:56.980
has like a bit of a negative connotation.
Like, they're revealing something bad.

00:46:56.980 --> 00:47:00.540
And I think when you were researching the
book you had solicited examples of when the

00:47:00.540 --> 00:47:05.540
presentation had gone horribly wrong.
Is there some example or anecdote that stood

00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:08.260
out in your mind from that research?

00:47:08.260 --> 00:47:10.270
Scott Berkun: Yeah, so there's a chapter in
the book.

00:47:10.270 --> 00:47:12.000
There's two chapters in the book that are
related to that.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:14.680
One chapter in the book is called, "What to
do when things go wrong."

00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:18.960
And it's an index of all the things people
are usually afraid of, and they've all happened

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.290
to me.
And how to prevent them from happening.

00:47:21.290 --> 00:47:25.250
And what to do if it happens anyway.
So it's like this 'countermove' thing in the

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:27.099
book for the stuff people are usually worried
about.

00:47:27.099 --> 00:47:28.970
Although, these things don't tend to happen
that often.

00:47:28.970 --> 00:47:32.869
And the last chapter in the book, I went around
to all the other people who I know are sort

00:47:32.869 --> 00:47:37.551
of like me -- who are authors or famous people
 -- who end up, as a by-product, doing a lot

00:47:37.551 --> 00:47:40.810
of speaking.
They're not actors or, you know, motivational

00:47:40.810 --> 00:47:43.369
speakers or anything.
And I took all their best stories.

00:47:43.369 --> 00:47:46.120
So one of my favorites is Dan Roam.
You guys know who Dan Roam is?

00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:49.740
Back of the Napkin.
He wrote this book called "Back of the Napkin."

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:53.230
And he has a story in there about speaking
in Russia years ago.

00:47:53.230 --> 00:47:59.990
And midway through his presentation, a bunch
of -- the equivalent of a SWAT team -- the

00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:07.300
Moscow like, SWAT team comes barging in, and
with AK-47s and the whole deal and go to the

00:48:07.300 --> 00:48:09.700
four corners of the room.
They identify the person they're looking for,

00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:15.070
they grab him, and then, they leave.
[laughter] Like, how do you follow that?

00:48:15.070 --> 00:48:18.400
Like, do you try to explain?
Or do you just pretend it didn't happen?

00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:22.241
So that's one of my favorite stories.
Like, that's like, you know, all the things

00:48:22.241 --> 00:48:24.300
you worry about, like that's something to
worry about.

00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:28.550
Like a terrorist group coming in and invading
your thing.

00:48:28.550 --> 00:48:32.960
Once AK-47s enter the situation, it's a whole
another game, I think.

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:36.410
Q Was there anybody on VC?
I don't even know if anybody's there.

00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:39.090
Okay. Well, let's give Scott a round of applause.
Thanks for coming.

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:43.310
Scott Berkun: Thanks guys.

00:48:43.310 --> 00:48:44.360
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]
