00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:13.740
Saturn was one of the
most radical innovations

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.980
in work organization of
the last several decades,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.540
but it was not alone.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.710
So let's take a look at
a number of companies

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:23.500
that are proof of
concept that you

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.480
can compete with what
we call high road

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.510
strategies, with good
jobs that provide

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.890
good returns to shareholders,
by using what we call

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.850
human capital, that is,
essentially workers, skills,

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.990
and their social networks
to drive innovation,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.920
good jobs, and high performance
for the organization.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.580
Let's start with one that I
think almost everyone knows,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.250
Southwest Airlines.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.700
This is an airline that
was created in the 1970s,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.750
and it's been an anomaly to
our friends on Wall Street.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.540
Southwest has been one of
the most profitable airlines

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.200
in the United States
over the last 30 years.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.090
Yet at the same time, it
breaks a lot of rules.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.220
First of all, it's been roundly
criticized by Wall Street

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.400
for not expanding fast enough,
not growing fast enough,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.210
but using its retained
earnings to share them

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.070
more equitably with
their employees

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.370
than growing the airline.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.730
Secondly, it's highly
unionized airline.

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.440
Wall Street thinks
unions are a drag.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.690
Third, it has the
best customer service

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.330
of any airline in the country,
and it builds that customer

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.510
service by engaging
employees in successful ways.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.970
And it has continued
to be successful

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.200
even after the retirement of
its charismatic founder, the CEO

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.100
Herb Kelleher.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.840
We're now on the fourth
CEO at Southwest,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.390
and it continues to do well.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.570
And so Southwest does get good
ratings from its employees.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.150
And now, even, it gets good
ratings from Wall Street.

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.970
So this is from a
Glassdoor survey

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.860
where employees can
voluntarily offer

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.340
their assessment of their
companies and their CEO.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.920
And you can see
that Southwest is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.230
ranked number one in the country
in terms of a place to work.

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.920
So we can do this.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.060
We can make companies,
design companies that

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.190
are successful for employees
by listening to them,

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.740
by engaging them, by
engaging in the teamwork

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.890
that Southwest
provides, as well as

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.000
producing high quality
services and highly profitable

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.160
companies.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.120
But Southwest is not alone.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.880
Let's dig a little bit
deeper and understand

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.260
what the difference is between
a high road and a low road

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.900
company.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.570
Let's do that by first
looking at Walmart,

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:50.620
and then comparing it to
another company called Costco.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.285
As you know, Walmart
is the largest employer

00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:54.160
in the United States.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.120
It has over 1.2 million,
quote, "associates."

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.170
They like to use
the term associates

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.380
to describe their employees.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.190
Walmart has been
successful financially.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.750
Yet Walmart has the tightest
controls on its employees.

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.240
It gets its financial
success by having, as you

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.860
know, a motto of low
prices all the time.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.580
How does it get
those low prices?

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:22.800
By having very low wage rates,
by controlling employees,

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.030
by having high
turnover so employees

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.480
don't become more expensive.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.010
It has no unions, and in fact,
it fights unions tooth and nail

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.300
to make sure it stays non-union.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:35.300
So here's a company that
works for shareholders

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.990
but is very tough
on its employees.

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.120
But then compare that to Costco.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.940
Costco competes with
some of Walmart's stores

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:45.380
that are called Sam Club.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.240
And Costco has a
very different model.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.490
It emphasizes product quality,
it emphasizes customer service,

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:55.710
it pays wages that are
higher than Walmart.

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.150
It allows employees
to unionize if that's

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.180
what they choose to do.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.160
So some of their stores are
unionized and some are not.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:06.430
It has a very long
tenure of its employees

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:08.190
because they learn
about the business

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.440
and they become more
productive over time.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.170
And so here we have
two alternatives.

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:15.760
We have a high road
employer called Costco.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.970
We have a low road
employer called Walmart.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.050
Both can be reasonably
successful financially,

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.810
but only one can be
successful financially

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.950
and provide good jobs
and good opportunities

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.470
for its employees.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.280
And in fact, this
chart shows that Costco

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.940
has outperformed Walmart
on financial grounds

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:38.120
in recent years.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.310
And so there are
two ways to compete.

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.810
There's a low road.

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.300
There's a high road.

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.320
Let's review.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.870
Just how do you get these
high road practices?

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.260
How can you build companies
that are successful

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.120
for both investors, for
employees, and for customers?

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.780
Well, it starts by
selecting employees

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.290
both for technical skills
and for teamwork skills

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.680
so that they're ready to
work together effectively

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.070
with their colleagues.

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.350
Secondly, it requires continuous
training and investment

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:11.270
of front line workers
as well middle managers

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.440
and supervisors.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.930
It requires us to work together
to build a culture of trust

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.290
at the workplace,
to engage employees,

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:22.980
and to get them to want to
cooperate with each other

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.700
to get the jobs done.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.360
It requires compensation systems
that align the incentives so

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.840
that employees share in the
income and the productivity

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.760
that they help to produce by
profit sharing or various kinds

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.500
of incentive systems.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.520
It requires, if unionized,
to have labor management

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.610
partnerships where labor and
management work together,

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.900
and the union leaders are
taken into the confidence

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.530
of management representatives
to get the job done together.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.620
And these principles
apply to organizations

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:56.910
not just in the US, but
all around the world.

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.590
Recall that we mentioned earlier
companies like Semco in Brazil,

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.520
where employees help
design their own jobs

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.820
and work in partnership
with management

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.190
to improve operations,
and sometimes

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.850
to create new businesses.

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:12.830
Or Ikea in Sweden.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:15.620
Or let's take the
classic example of Toyota

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.990
in Japan or in its plants
all around the world.

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.580
In fact, Toyota's model of
so-called lean production

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.350
is the source of many of
the ideas and practices that

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.770
need to be fitted together
in high road firms

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:33.980
to achieve world class
productivity, quality,

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:35.690
and good jobs.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:37.490
We're going to see
in another video

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.250
my colleague Zeynep Ton
talking about a grocery chain

00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:43.970
here in the Northeastern
part of the United States

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:47.110
that has been very successful
in building a company that

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:51.030
works for shareholders as well
as customers and employees.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.250
And in fact, the
employees and managers

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:57.570
revolted to save the company
from a change in strategy

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.160
in the summer of 2014.

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.430
So let's get on with
the task of building

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:05.560
these high road,
good jobs companies,

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.620
or, if you're not
in a top management

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.710
position at the
moment, demanding

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.700
that your employer follow
these principles wherever

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:15.450
you happen to live and work.

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:17.960
That's the challenge
you face, not only

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.500
in creating these, but spreading
these to become the norm

00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:25.270
across American industry.
