00:00:00.831 --> 00:00:01.740
- [Voiceover] We've learned about series

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.666
and parallel resistors,
we've learned how to

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.990
simplify series and parallel resistors

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.991
into an equivalent resistor,
and just to review,

00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:15.158
for the series resistor, R
series, an equivalent R series

00:00:16.366 --> 00:00:18.816
is equal to the sum of
resistors in series.

00:00:18.816 --> 00:00:19.733
R1 plus R2.

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:26.898
And we learned that if we
have resistors in parallel,

00:00:26.898 --> 00:00:30.021
meaning they share the same
nodes, if they're in parallel,

00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:33.179
we can get a parallel equivalent resistors

00:00:33.179 --> 00:00:37.080
R parallel, and if
there was two resistors,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.656
if there's two resistors in
parallel, the formula was

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:41.989
R1 times R2 over

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.245
R1 plus R2, plus R2.

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:54.321
And if there's three
resistors or more in parallel

00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:55.714
it's a little more complicated.

00:00:55.714 --> 00:00:57.095
This formula look like this.

00:00:57.095 --> 00:01:01.262
One over R parallel, this is
for three or more resistors.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.097
One over R1

00:01:05.072 --> 00:01:06.489
plus one over R2,

00:01:09.368 --> 00:01:11.618
plus one over R3, etcetera,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.906
for as many resistors as you have.

00:01:16.906 --> 00:01:19.431
These two parallel
formulas do the same thing.

00:01:19.431 --> 00:01:21.172
This one's a little more convenient to use

00:01:21.172 --> 00:01:23.922
when you just have two resistors.

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:27.209
So now, this problem in this video,

00:01:27.209 --> 00:01:30.240
we're going to look at a
complicated resistor circuit.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.237
There's a lot of resistors here.

00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:34.593
The question we're going
to ask is, if we plug in

00:01:34.593 --> 00:01:37.519
this voltage source here
into our resistor network

00:01:37.519 --> 00:01:40.436
there's the two little plug points,

00:01:41.652 --> 00:01:43.916
the question is what kind
of current is going to be

00:01:43.916 --> 00:01:45.774
pulled out of this voltage source?

00:01:45.774 --> 00:01:47.597
That's what I want to know.

00:01:47.597 --> 00:01:49.791
And if I stare at this, I go,

00:01:49.791 --> 00:01:52.798
well how am I going to figure that out?

00:01:52.798 --> 00:01:55.213
The important part of what
we're doing here is to

00:01:55.213 --> 00:01:58.649
stop for a minute and just see
what this circuit looks like,

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.983
just be with it for a second.

00:02:00.983 --> 00:02:03.363
Let your eyes wander over it and find

00:02:03.363 --> 00:02:05.557
resistor patterns that you recognize.

00:02:05.557 --> 00:02:08.057
And you just wait and do that.

00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:11.919
All right, so we're looking
for series in parallel patterns

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:16.018
and there's one, and this
is not in series, no.

00:02:16.018 --> 00:02:19.122
Okay, oh, there's a possibility,
here's a possibility

00:02:19.122 --> 00:02:21.584
of parallel resistors.

00:02:21.584 --> 00:02:24.161
This, is there a series one over here.

00:02:24.161 --> 00:02:27.481
I don't see a series head
to tail connection here

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:32.381
and there's a series connection
here that we can use.

00:02:32.381 --> 00:02:34.819
Okay, so there's a couple of possibilities

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:36.468
here for simplification.

00:02:36.468 --> 00:02:40.183
And one of the questions
is, okay, where do we start?

00:02:40.183 --> 00:02:43.724
We want to start this problem
at the end farthest away

00:02:43.724 --> 00:02:45.373
from the thing we care
about, what we care about

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:48.530
is this right here, this
is what we're looking for.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.108
And so, a good way to start this problem

00:02:51.108 --> 00:02:53.906
is to start at the very
far end of the circuit

00:02:53.906 --> 00:02:56.460
and work our way backwards.

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.596
And this is opposite the
way you read sentences

00:02:58.596 --> 00:03:00.442
and things like that, but in circuits

00:03:00.442 --> 00:03:02.497
it's sometimes what we want to do.

00:03:02.497 --> 00:03:05.876
So what I'm going to do is
start over here on this side

00:03:05.876 --> 00:03:07.617
and we're going to
disassemble this circuit

00:03:07.617 --> 00:03:09.700
and simplify it as we go.

00:03:10.973 --> 00:03:12.958
So we've actually at this
point, we've actually done

00:03:12.958 --> 00:03:15.277
the hard work of this, and
the rest of it's going to be

00:03:15.277 --> 00:03:17.994
relatively straightforward application

00:03:17.994 --> 00:03:19.677
of these two formulas.

00:03:19.677 --> 00:03:22.057
We decided what our
unknown is, and we decided

00:03:22.057 --> 00:03:25.134
where to start and that
strategy is the key

00:03:25.134 --> 00:03:29.174
to making this a simple
straightforward process.

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:30.497
All right, so let's go after it.

00:03:30.497 --> 00:03:32.375
We're going to, we're
basically now going to do

00:03:32.375 --> 00:03:35.231
the work of simplifying this network.

00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:39.909
So, what I see here is
two resistors in series,

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:43.242
two ohms plus eight ohms equals 10 ohms.

00:03:45.134 --> 00:03:48.134
So I can remove these resistors here

00:03:53.272 --> 00:03:55.105
and we place them with

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.217
a 10 ohm resistor, that's step one.

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:04.650
What do we do next? Now
we look at it again.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.098
Right here we see we have
two parallel resistors.

00:04:08.098 --> 00:04:10.455
So we're actually going to use this form.

00:04:10.455 --> 00:04:13.033
We're going to use this form
of the parallel resistor

00:04:13.033 --> 00:04:16.283
formula, and that says that 10 times 10

00:04:18.071 --> 00:04:19.404
over 10 plus 10,

00:04:22.414 --> 00:04:24.747
this is equal to 100 over 20

00:04:26.779 --> 00:04:27.779
or five ohms

00:04:30.717 --> 00:04:32.342
and I could've done this a little quicker

00:04:32.342 --> 00:04:35.442
if I know that if two
resistors in parallel

00:04:35.442 --> 00:04:38.101
have the same value, 10 and 10.

00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:40.539
I know that the parallel combination

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.617
of those is exactly half.

00:04:42.617 --> 00:04:45.334
So now we have an equivalent
resistor for those two guys.

00:04:45.334 --> 00:04:47.001
We can take them out

00:04:51.963 --> 00:04:53.963
and we replace that with

00:04:57.095 --> 00:04:58.762
a five ohm resistor.

00:05:00.853 --> 00:05:02.096
You can see where this is going,

00:05:02.096 --> 00:05:03.976
we're just basically going
to collapse this circuit

00:05:03.976 --> 00:05:05.335
one step at a time.

00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:09.502
Five ohms plus one ohm is
this series combination here

00:05:11.372 --> 00:05:15.539
and that is equal to six ohms,
so I can replace this now

00:05:17.154 --> 00:05:19.975
with six ohms, we're just
consuming our circuit

00:05:19.975 --> 00:05:22.892
and erasing and rewriting as we go.

00:05:28.764 --> 00:05:33.628
And I said six ohms here,
and what do we have now?

00:05:33.628 --> 00:05:34.963
Now this is a little more challenging.

00:05:34.963 --> 00:05:37.390
I have three resistors in parallel

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.188
and I'm going to use now this formula here

00:05:40.188 --> 00:05:42.812
for resistors in parallel, so

00:05:42.812 --> 00:05:45.812
one over the parallel combination is

00:05:47.189 --> 00:05:48.522
one over 12 plus

00:05:50.707 --> 00:05:52.207
one over four plus

00:05:54.364 --> 00:05:58.114
one over six and the
common denominator is 12

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:59.783
so that is

00:06:04.232 --> 00:06:07.204
something over 12, which will be

00:06:07.204 --> 00:06:09.037
one plus three over 12

00:06:11.767 --> 00:06:15.517
plus two over 12, and
that equals six over 12

00:06:17.793 --> 00:06:19.210
which is one half

00:06:21.322 --> 00:06:23.725
and one over Rp, that's one over Rp,

00:06:23.725 --> 00:06:26.892
so Rp equals two over one or two ohms.

00:06:29.925 --> 00:06:31.429
And now I can replace all three of these.

00:06:31.429 --> 00:06:33.512
I get to erase all three.

00:06:39.254 --> 00:06:40.754
We're almost done.

00:06:50.492 --> 00:06:53.825
And that was, I said two ohms, two ohms.

00:06:54.672 --> 00:06:58.815
The final step is one
and two ohms in series.

00:06:58.815 --> 00:07:00.898
One plus two equals three

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.017
and finally we get to the last step

00:07:06.814 --> 00:07:07.647
which is

00:07:26.737 --> 00:07:28.200
All right, so we're done.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:31.427
What that means is, from the viewpoint,

00:07:31.427 --> 00:07:34.527
as far as that voltage source can tell,

00:07:34.527 --> 00:07:38.115
it's putting out enough
current to drive three ohms.

00:07:38.115 --> 00:07:42.074
And that whole rest of
that complicated network,

00:07:42.074 --> 00:07:44.210
looks like three ohms to that resistor,

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:46.567
to that voltage source.

00:07:46.567 --> 00:07:50.224
And we have taken a complicated circuit

00:07:50.224 --> 00:07:52.488
and turned it into a really simple one.

00:07:52.488 --> 00:07:54.334
So that's the steps of simplification.

00:07:54.334 --> 00:07:57.364
The key was figuring out what you want

00:07:57.364 --> 00:07:59.454
and then going to the
far end of the circuit

00:07:59.454 --> 00:08:01.486
and working your way backwards

00:08:01.486 --> 00:08:03.653
and simplifying as you go.
