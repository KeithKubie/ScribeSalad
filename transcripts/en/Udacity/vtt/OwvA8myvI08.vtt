00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, we have a right triangle--we know something about the side opposite α--

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
that's the length of the shadow--and the side adjacent to α--that's the length of the bar.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Opposite and adjacent are the tangent, so that tells us the tangent of α is equal to the opposite

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:24.000
0.126 over the adjacent, just 1.00, and that's just equal to 0.126.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Now, I know that the tangent of this angle is 0.126, I can go into my table of trig values,

00:00:29.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and I see--hey, that corresponds to an angle of 7.2 degrees.
