00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.210
In recent years, Marvel movies have absolutely
dominated the box office and have brought

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.950
us some of the most memorable performances
of all time.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.320
From Robert Downey Jr’s Ironman to Ryan
Reynolds Deadpool, some of the greatest actors

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.770
in the world are lining up to play heroes
from the Marvel comics.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.360
While there is fantastic writing behind every
one of these characters, some of the most

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.460
amazing moments from these films happen when
the actors decide to go off script and just

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.110
let their impulses drive them.

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.460
For this video we are taking a look at some
of the best examples in our list of 10 Marvel

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.690

See Coming!

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.069
The Avengers – RDJ’s Snacks
Robert Downey Jr has famously played badass

00:00:57.069 --> 00:01:02.100
billionaire turned superhero Tony Stark since
2008 and it seems that his personality and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.760
the character’s are starting to meld into
one.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.180
During the filming of The Avengers RDJ hid
snacks around the set and as much as the crew

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.190
tried, they were unable to find them all.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:15.690
The filmmakers decided to just go with it
and make snacking part of Tony Stark’s character.

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.650
During one scene where the gang is talking
about SHIELD Robert Downey Jr. starts randomly

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.490
offering blueberries to everyone and snacking
down on them himself.

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.421
This scene was of course not written into
the script at all and came as a total, but

00:01:27.421 --> 00:01:48.850
admittedly pleasant, surprise to his 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:02:11.140
scene mates.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.900
Age Of Ultron – Hawkeye Line
Until 2015’s Avengers Age Of Ultron, Hawkeye

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.450
was often ridiculed for being the most underused
and useless member of The Avengers.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.599
The second team up movie gave Jeremy Renner’s
character more to do and the fans definitely

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:25.599
appreciated it.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.299
On top of the action, Hawkeye and Quicksilver
begin to develop a fun love-hate relationship,

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.200
constantly challenging each other and at one
point, Quicksilver obnoxiously speeds away

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.200
from Hawkeye.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.439
The archer then utters the hilarious line
“Nobody would know… ‘last I saw him,

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.890
Ultron was sitting on him!’”.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.849
It was revealed later that this moment was
completely unscripted and something that Renner

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.129
came up with on the spot!

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:47.129
The Avengers – Shawarma Scene
2012’s The Avengers is still regarded as

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:48.129
one of the best superhero movies of all time
as it was brilliantly able to blend amazing

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:49.129
action and witty banter into one cohesive
super film.

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:50.245
The success of this franchise is in large
part due to the writers, but credit must also

00:02:50.245 --> 00:02:51.245
be given to the cast who were able to find
chemistry with each other and even improvise

00:02:51.245 --> 00:02:52.245
a bunch of the lines.

00:02:52.245 --> 00:02:53.245
At the end of the movie, Robert Downey Jr.’s
Tony Stark delivers one of the best-unscripted

00:02:53.245 --> 00:02:54.245
moments of the film when he suggests that
the crew head out for shawarma now that they

00:02:54.245 --> 00:02:55.245
are done saving the world from Loki.

00:02:55.245 --> 00:02:56.245
This improvised line was so good that it prompted
the now famous post credit scene of the whole

00:02:56.245 --> 00:02:57.245
team chowing down together.

00:02:57.245 --> 00:02:58.245
The Incredible Hulk Post Credit Scene
Marvel has had their shared universe all planned

00:02:58.245 --> 00:02:59.245
out for years now but that doesn’t mean
that there wasn’t room for some fun improvisation

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:01.120
even at the beginning of the process.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:05.459
At the end of 2008’s Incredible Hulk, Thaddeus
“Thunderbolt” Ross is drinking alone when

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:06.470
Tony Stark shows up.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.870
A few jokes are made between the two, before
Tony Stark reveals that he is building a super

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.239
team (The Avengers).

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.010
The scene is great and feels very natural
so it made sense when the actors revealed

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.090
that the entire dialogue was improvised.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.749
We are guessing that they were given some
guidelines (like make sure to mention The

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:25.400
Avengers), but the rest was left up to the
actors and the result was appreciated!

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.950
Thor – Odin Growls
Anthony Hopkins is one of the most respected

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.950
and talented actors working in Hollywood,
so it was pretty cool that he agreed to play

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:28.950
Asgardian ruler Odin in Thor.

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:29.950
Hopkins is known for completely throwing himself
into any role he does, and it turns out that

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:30.950
this one was no different.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:31.950
In the scene where Odin is banishing Thor
and taking away his hammer, Anthony Hopkins

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:32.950
got so into character that when Hiddleston’s
Loki went to speak he let out a totally unscripted

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:33.950
but undeniably awesome growl.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:34.950
When you watch the scene you can see the genuine
surprise on Thor and Loki’s faces, which

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:35.950
makes the moment all the more memorable.

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.950
Ant-Man – Three way conversations
Ant-Man is one of the funnier Marvel movies,

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:38.549
which makes sense when you consider that it’s
star, Paul Rudd, has mostly been a comedic

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.010
actor throughout his career.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.810
As it turns out, Rudd wasn’t the only one
going off script during the shooting of the

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.170
heist superhero movie.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.159
The cast revealed that most of the dialogue
in the scenes between Bobby Cannavale, Judy

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:51.780
Greer and Paul Rudd was completely improvised
and the actors were only given general directions

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.780
as to where the scenes needed to go.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.079
The three characters are in a complicated
relationship, so the fact that they were able

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.910
to improvise together to create more genuine
dialogue is impressive.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.939
Additionally, Michael Pena has also stated
that most of his scenes with Paul Rudd featured

00:04:02.939 --> 00:04:04.639
improvised dialogue as well.

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:08.870
All of this makes you wonder if there ever
was a real script for Ant-Man or if they just

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:19.739
put a lot of trust in the talented cast.

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:46.270
The Amazing Spider-Man – Godzilla Joke
As bad as 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:05:04.490
the sequel was, The Amazing Spider-Man is
actually a pretty decent movie and it features

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.210
a lot of great performances.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.590
One of the most underrated ones came from
Denis Leary who plays Captain Stacy in the

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:11.590
movie.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.500
He is a very talented actor and one scene
has him make a pretty hilarious unscripted

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.680
joke that the cast did not see coming.

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.181
In the scene where Garfield’s Spider-man
is trying to worn Stacy and the rest of the

00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:23.160
police force about a crazy giant lizard on
the loose and Leary quickly hits him back

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.100
with an improvised joke about Godzilla.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.530
The joke took the rest of the cast by surprise
but they were able to not break character

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:36.600
and the great moment was able to make it into
the film in its purest form.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.790
Guardians of The Galaxy – Rocket Raccoon
Chris Pratt has gotten a lot of credit for

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.630
the great improvised moments that he brought
to Guardians Of The Galaxy, but it turns out

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:47.530
that he wasn’t the only one bringing the
unscripted magic.

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.930
While Bradley Cooper voiced Rocket Raccoon,
it was actually director James Gunn’s brother,

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:56.210
Sean Gunn, who played the pre-CGI’d raccoon
during filming and it turns out he came up

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.300
with one of the best lines all on his own.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.240
The line comes when the team is all gearing
up and agreeing to head off on their final

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.980
(and presumably fateful) mission.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.080
Rocket Raccoon utters the line “We’re
all standing now.

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:10.790
Bunch of jackasses, standing in a circle,”
which turns out to have been a completely

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:18.550
unplanned moment courtesy of Sean Gunn.

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:23.140
Deadpool – ‘You Look Like’ Joke
Deadpool was one of the best movies of 2016

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.030
and it is now even being recognized with major
award nominations.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.200
The script for the film was amazing but when
you put hilarious guys like Ryan Reynolds

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.640
and TJ Miller together, you are bound to end
up with some pretty great-unscripted moments.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.340
The best-improvised moments from Deadpool
didn’t actually make it into the theatrical

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.470
release, but they can now be found online
and in the DVD special features.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:46.300
In the scene where Reynolds is showing his
post operation face to TJ Miller, the two

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:50.810
actors were given the green light to improvise
and riff out as many zingers as they could.

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:54.710
One of the most hilarious moments that was
deemed to racy for the R rated flick came

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:58.830
when Miller said: ‘You look like a trucker
took a shit on your shoulders and then shaped

00:06:58.830 --> 00:06:59.830
ears onto it’.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:09.160
We understand why all these lines couldn’t
make the final cut, but they are awesome nonetheless.

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:14.300
Captain America: The First Avenger
There is no denying that Chris Evans got incredibly

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.590
jacked to play Steve Rogers in Captain America:
The First Avenger and we imagine that a lot

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.430
of people on set were taken by his incredible
physique.

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:25.280
Usually, that type of admiration stays out
of the actual production, but it turns out

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:29.710
that Hayley Atwell (who plays Peggy Carter
in the film) was unable to control herself.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.030
In the scene were Christ Evans first emerges
as the jacked up super soldier, Atwell can’t

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.310
help but instinctively reach out and grab
his giant peck.

00:07:37.310 --> 00:07:41.250
This scene is hilariously genuine as it turns
out that it was totally unplanned.

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:47.670
Evans reacted naturally and the moment was
able to stay in the film.

00:07:47.670 --> 00:07:53.070
So there is our list of 10 Marvel Superhero
Movie Moments That Actors Did Not See Coming.
