LONGEST SIDE

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.241
IS CALLED THE HYPOTENUSE,

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:10.309
AND IT'S THIS SIDE HERE.

00:00:10.342 --> 00:00:15.381
- HEY, I WISH I WERE HIGH
ON POTENUSE.

00:00:15.414 --> 00:00:17.316

00:00:19.218 --> 00:00:22.422

TODAY WE HONOR TROY MORRISON.

00:03:36.048 --> 00:03:38.484
NOW TROY WAS IN GEOMETRY CLASS

00:03:38.517 --> 00:03:41.554
WHEN HIS TEACHER MENTIONED
THE HYPOTENUSE OF A TRIANGLE.

00:03:41.587 --> 00:03:44.357
TROY SAID, "I WISH I WAS HIGH
ON POTENUSE."

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.758
THAT REALLY CRACKED ME UP,

00:03:45.791 --> 00:03:48.527
AND IT CRACKED UP
THE REST OF AMERICA TOO,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.997
