Hi, my name is I am

00:00:31.877 --> 00:00:35.650
the one that tangles up
consonants and vowels.

00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:37.751
I am international.

00:00:38.221 --> 00:00:40.291

as we mix our vowels,

00:01:08.778 --> 00:01:10.762
and we make the saddle.

00:01:10.786 --> 00:01:14.890
I appreciate less the consonants
of those we haven't sounded.
