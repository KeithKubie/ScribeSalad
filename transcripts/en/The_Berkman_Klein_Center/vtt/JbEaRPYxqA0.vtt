00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.560
My name is Janina Loh, and I'm working at
the University of Vienna as a post doc in

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.490
the field of philosophy of technology and
media, and specialized in robot ethics and

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.760
responsibility research and transposed humanism.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.919
I'm not afraid of autonomous vehicles.

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:24.210
I'm just a little bit worried because I think
that people misinterpret the challenges and

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.749
the problems that come along with developing
autonomous vehicles.

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:36.329
When I sit on panel discussions on these topics
one of the first questions is always "will

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:42.680
machines run over the world" and this dystopian
"Terminator" scenario.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.050
Another question arises like "we're going
to be wonderful, and we will merge with nanobots

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.750
and upload our mind on a computer, and be
virtually immortal!"

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.769
So we always have these extreme scenarios,
like the dystopian scenario on the one hand,

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:02.780
and the utopian scenario on the other hand.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.420
And I think it's much more complicated than
that.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:06.420
It's not that easy.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.140
We don't have the luxury to choose either
a black or a white scenario.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.230
We have to get in the messy grey area that
is in between.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:21.730
And we have to look at concrete artificial
technological developments.

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.040
So I am not a prophet!

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:33.479
I'm not but a philosopher and it's my responsibility
to figure out the challenges that go along

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.990
with each and every technological development.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.689
And not jump on the train of a dystopian vision
or a utopian vision.
