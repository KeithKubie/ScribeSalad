00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.110
In just 3 easy steps, you'll be able to flash
freeze a bottle of water just by touching

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.110
it.

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.680
Next you'll learn how to to freeze flowing
water, the instant it's poured from the bottle.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.220
And your training will be complete when you
can eliminate the bottle altogether.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.710
Now this might seem slightly supernatural,
but you don't have to be a master to do it.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:47.300
In this project, we're discovering the secrets
to Ice-bending - in real life.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.870
For this project, we'll be using these bottles
of purified water.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.620
I've got the 16.9 ounce bottles, and they've
never been opened, so the water is extremely

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:56.710
pure.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.969
Now the secret to instant ice is just about
as simple as placing your bottles in the freezer.

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:06.090
I let these ones sit for 2 hours and 45 minutes
exactly, and here you can see the water is

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.820
still liquid, but it's actually cooled down
to a temperature well below freezing.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.910
All it takes from this point is a sharp jolt
to the bottle, and you can see the water flash

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.100
freezes to ice right in the palm of your hand.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.390
How cool is that?

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.220
You can also start the reaction by using an
ice crystal, like one these ice cubes.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.850
Just carefully remove the cap from the bottle,
and pour the water directly onto the ice.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.320
The water immediately beings to crystalize,
giving you the power to create your own instant

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.990
ice sculptures.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.880
The end result is a slush that has the consistency
of a watery snowball .. which, of course,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.060
is 100% edible, and refreshingly delicious.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.150
Now try pouring your super-cooled water into
a clean glass, and drop a bit of ice right

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.591
in the center.

00:01:48.591 --> 00:01:53.460
You'll see the ice crystal beings to grow
until it fills the glass completely.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.850
That's perfectly chilled for a hot summers
day.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.660
Alright, let's finish up by dipping just the
tip of an ice cube in to see what happens.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:05.010
Within a couple of seconds it's frozen in
place, and the entire cup is solid.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.619
Well, now you know the secret to pouring yourself
some instant ice, and making water freeze

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:10.619
on command.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:15.350

Instant Ice.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.170
That's it for now.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.050
