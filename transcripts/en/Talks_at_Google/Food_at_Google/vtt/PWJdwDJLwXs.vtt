PRESENTER: I'd like to
welcome everyone to our talk

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.430
with Tom Standage, who's
currently on his phone,

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.820
I believe, on Facebook,
which is appropriate

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.345
for-- well, it's
OK for the topic.

00:00:19.345 --> 00:00:19.878
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:20.794
TOM STANDAGE: Twitter.

00:00:20.794 --> 00:00:21.277
Twitter.

00:00:21.277 --> 00:00:21.760
Twitter.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.760
FEMALE SPEAKER: Twitter.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.420
Oh, much better.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.093
Tom is currently
at editor at-- is

00:00:29.093 --> 00:00:30.843
editor at "The Economist,"
editor-in-chief

00:00:30.843 --> 00:00:32.237
of the economist.com.

00:00:32.237 --> 00:00:33.320
Am I getting that correct?

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.570
TOM STANDAGE: That is correct.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.350
FEMALE SPEAKER: And
has written a book

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.880
on social media starting
back 2,000 years.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.760
I think we're all excited
to hear what he has to say.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.680
So please join me
in welcoming Tom.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.440
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440
TOM STANDAGE: Thank you.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.760
Thanks very much.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.218
It's great to be
here, particularly

00:00:54.218 --> 00:00:56.280
to be not just at
Cambridge and at Google,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.520
but in the age of
Lovelace work as well.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.048
And my daughter has
two guinea pigs.

00:01:01.048 --> 00:01:02.024
Actually, they died.

00:01:02.024 --> 00:01:03.649
But they were called
Artemis and Athena

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:06.100
because she's really into
Ancient Greek mythology.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.040
And she's going to get
two new guinea pigs.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.170
And she knows she's going
to call one of them Ada.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.050
But she's looking
for a similarly--

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.719
she wants another kind of
epic female figure from

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:17.260
the history--

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.260
FEMALE SPEAKER: Augusta.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.704
TOM STANDAGE: Augusta?

00:01:19.704 --> 00:01:20.620
AUDIENCE: Same person.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.110
Same person.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.600
AUDIENCE: They're the same one.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.280
TOM STANDAGE: Oh, same name.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.420
OK.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.070
From "The History of
Science and Technology."

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.014
But what's her name?

00:01:25.014 --> 00:01:25.960
They just made that movie with--

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.793
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:01:30.285 --> 00:01:31.160
TOM STANDAGE: Oh, OK.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.530
Brilliant.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:32.363
OK, well, fantastic.

00:01:32.363 --> 00:01:35.720
I'll talk to you
afterwards and get these.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.330
Anyway, so it's great
to be here to talk

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.430
to you about my crazy idea
that social media is old.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.690
But this is something I
make a habit of doing,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.750
which is to look
at the precursors

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.690
of modern technologies,
whether they

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.750
are the internet or
social media or planet

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.577
hunting or artificial
intelligence.

00:01:52.577 --> 00:01:55.035
And these are all things I've
covered in my previous books.

00:01:55.035 --> 00:01:57.940
So this time, I'm looking at
the prehistory of social media

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.664
going back to the Romans.

00:01:59.664 --> 00:02:01.330
So in order to get
away with that claim,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.520
I need to define what
I mean by social media.

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.030
So what do I mean
by social media?

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.491
So I think the brilliant
characteristic of social media

00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:10.115
is it's media we get
from other people.

00:02:10.115 --> 00:02:13.450
So it's horizontal, P2P
conversational transfer

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.235
of stuff rather than vertical
top-down one-directional

00:02:18.235 --> 00:02:19.840
broadcast transfer of stuff.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:25.394
And here is a way of putting
that into prose-- media

00:02:25.394 --> 00:02:26.810
we get from other
people, the idea

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.520
that it's exchanged
along a social graph,

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.050
and that that
creates a distributed

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.440
discussion or community.

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.440
So what I'm doing now,
this is not social media.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.870
There is no media involved here.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.770
It's just a speech.

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.166
Similarly, passing on
gossip by word of mouth I

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:43.040
don't count as media.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.180
It's when you have the
use of technology-- media

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.263
is basically the use of
communications technology,

00:02:47.263 --> 00:02:48.520
as far as I'm concerned.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.080
Then you get social media.

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.825
So you then are able to have
this distributed conversation

00:02:52.825 --> 00:02:54.720
with people who
aren't directly there.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.095
We're used to doing this
on the internet today.

00:02:57.095 --> 00:02:59.370
You choose your social network.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.200
You map your social
graph onto it.

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.040
You add other people who aren't
on your social graph onto it.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.295
And then stuff can flow
around in this rather

00:03:07.295 --> 00:03:08.847
sort of unpredictable P2P way.

00:03:08.847 --> 00:03:10.222
And that person
in the middle can

00:03:10.222 --> 00:03:12.555
connect the graph on the left
to the graph on the right.

00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:15.025
And so we understand how that
works today on the internet.

00:03:15.025 --> 00:03:17.233
But I don't think you actually
need a digital network

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:19.052
to make all of this possible.

00:03:19.052 --> 00:03:21.230
And I think that social
media environments,

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.090
if you know what
you're looking for,

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.720
and if you use my definition to
define what you're looking for,

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.022
have actually been
around for centuries.

00:03:28.022 --> 00:03:29.563
And the first one
you get is actually

00:03:29.563 --> 00:03:33.182
in the late Roman Republic
in the first century BC.

00:03:33.182 --> 00:03:35.140
So in order to have a
social media environment,

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.639
I think you need
to have two things.

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.139
You need to have
literacy, so people

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.889
need to be able to
operate the technology,

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.400
in this case
reading and writing.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.422
And you also need the cost
of copying and delivering

00:03:44.422 --> 00:03:47.420
information to be zero
or very close to zero.

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.370
And we have broadband,
which delivers

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.830
the second of those
two conditions today.

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:52.645
The Romans didn't.

00:03:52.645 --> 00:03:53.520
But they had slavery.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:55.850
So slavery was the
Roman broadband.

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:58.970
And slavery makes the
marginal cost per page zero.

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.445
So if you're Cicero, and
you've bought your scribe,

00:04:01.445 --> 00:04:05.390
and you're paying for his upkeep
and the roof over his head,

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.580
then when you want him
to copy another document,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:08.800
you give him another
document, and you

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.799
wait for him to copy it.

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:12.300
So you just have to wait
for the extra document.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:13.720
And it's just like
in a broadband,

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.178
you can download as
much as you like,

00:04:15.178 --> 00:04:16.636
as long as you're
prepared to wait.

00:04:16.636 --> 00:04:19.552
Similarly, many
rich nobles in Rome

00:04:19.552 --> 00:04:21.730
had entire staffs
of people called

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.550
tabellarii who were messengers.

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.600
There was no public
postal service.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.100
And so what you did
was you employed

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.308
a group of these people,
and they had specific rounds

00:04:30.308 --> 00:04:30.961
that they did.

00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:32.539
And they went to lots
of your friends' houses

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:33.667
and picked up anything
that they had for you

00:04:33.667 --> 00:04:35.792
and delivered stuff in
the other direction.

00:04:35.792 --> 00:04:37.500
And we see this in
the letters of Cicero.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.290
He writes to one of
his friends, oh, now

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.140
your wretched messenger's
knocking on the door again.

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:42.473
Just give me a chance, will you?

00:04:42.473 --> 00:04:44.694
And this is how it worked.

00:04:44.694 --> 00:04:46.530
And if you didn't have
access to messengers,

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:47.470
then you would just give
letters to your friends,

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.570
and they would be heading
in the right direction.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.861
And it was very much like
sort of best-effort delivery.

00:04:51.861 --> 00:04:54.354
They would take it in the
direction of Asia Minor.

00:04:54.354 --> 00:04:56.520
And then they'd go, oh, I'm
not going the right way.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.910
And they'd give it
to someone else.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.750
So you sometimes had to send
two or three copies because it

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.999
wouldn't always get through,
and then ships would sink

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:02.953
and things like that.

00:05:02.953 --> 00:05:05.399
But essentially, we have a
peer-to-peer transmission

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:05.899
system.

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:08.336
And we have very
low-cost delivery,

00:05:08.336 --> 00:05:10.086
at least for those
people who are literate

00:05:10.086 --> 00:05:11.310
and for those of the rich.

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.630
So what we see is a
social media ecosystem

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.090
emerging within the Roman elite.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:18.616
And the Roman elite is a bunch
of intermarried rich families.

00:05:18.616 --> 00:05:21.070
And so for them, the political
news and the social news

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.890
are intertwined.

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:22.910
They're the same.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.230
If two families fall out, it
can literally lead to civil war.

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:29.350
Whereas if two families
decide to get together

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.530
and then they cement this
alliance with a marriage,

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:33.800
then that means that
maybe war will be averted.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.360
So knowing who's
going to marry who

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.869
and if there are divorces and
births and deaths and so on

00:05:37.869 --> 00:05:40.410
becomes actually crucial to your
survival in the Roman world.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:41.370
So if we look at one
of Cicero's letters,

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:42.950
here's a great example.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.756
"I sent you on March 24th
a copy of Balbus' letter

00:05:45.756 --> 00:05:47.910
to me and of Caesar's
letter to him."

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.082
I think Cicero is writing to his
friend Atticus, in this case.

00:05:51.082 --> 00:05:53.920
They wrote to each other
every day, at least once.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.969
And they wrote things
like, write to me anyway

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:57.302
even if you have nothing to say.

00:05:57.302 --> 00:05:59.066
They just wanted to
be on the network.

00:05:59.066 --> 00:06:03.270
And what's happening here is
Cicero is saying to Atticus,

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.751
I sent you on March 24 a
copy of Balbus' letter to me.

00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:06.875
So think about that letter.

00:06:06.875 --> 00:06:08.671
That letter's gone
from Balbus to Cicero.

00:06:08.671 --> 00:06:10.295
And then Cicero's
copied it to Atticus.

00:06:10.295 --> 00:06:12.360
And Caesar's letter to
him, so that letter's

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:15.988
gone from Caesar to Balbus
to Cicero to Atticus.

00:06:15.988 --> 00:06:18.976
So that's sort of a
third order retweet.

00:06:18.976 --> 00:06:22.524
And this is the way it
worked, that the Romans were

00:06:22.524 --> 00:06:23.440
writing to each other.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.340
They were passing
the news around.

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.240
They were quoting bits of
letters, although sometimes

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:27.946
whole letters, to
each other to keep

00:06:27.946 --> 00:06:30.312
each other informed
of what was going on.

00:06:30.312 --> 00:06:32.020
They could also write
these open letters.

00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.644
So this is another
example from Cicero.

00:06:33.644 --> 00:06:37.820
In this case, he's written an
open letter criticizing Caesar.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:39.846
And he says to one
of his friends,

00:06:39.846 --> 00:06:41.720
"You say my letter has
been widely published.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:42.511
Well, I don't care.

00:06:42.511 --> 00:06:45.172
Indeed, I myself allowed several
people to take a copy of it."

00:06:45.172 --> 00:06:47.130
Cicero's interesting
because we have his inbox,

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:48.590
and we also have his outbox.

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:51.500
So he would dictate a
letter to his scribe Tiro.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.876
And when they were
happy with it,

00:06:52.876 --> 00:06:54.333
and they'd sort of
edited it a bit,

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:56.396
Tiro would write out
the neat form of it,

00:06:56.396 --> 00:06:58.100
and it would be sent
to the recipient.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.490
And then copies could also be
made from the rough version

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:02.700
and sent to other recipients.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.100
And the rough version
would stay in the outbox.

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.267
And so if anyone were to
come around Cicero's house,

00:07:07.267 --> 00:07:09.766
oh, I hear you wrote a really
scorching letter about Caesar.

00:07:09.766 --> 00:07:11.060
Can I have a copy of it?

00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.600
And they would then pass
these onto their friends.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.120
So this is very much
like writing a pamphlet

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.788
or a bit like writing
an open letter

00:07:17.788 --> 00:07:20.310
to the newspaper in the sense
that you expect lots of people

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:22.632
to see it and you expect
it to be passed around.

00:07:22.632 --> 00:07:24.465
And Cicero writes about
this, that he writes

00:07:24.465 --> 00:07:25.975
in a particular
tone of voice when

00:07:25.975 --> 00:07:28.812
he's writing an open letter
and in another tone of voice

00:07:28.812 --> 00:07:30.020
when he's writing to friends.

00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.210
And then he'll sometimes
say-- and this bit's

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:33.680
not for circulation, but.

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:35.680
And that would be a
paragraph, and he might even

00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.056
write that bit in
his own hand so

00:07:37.056 --> 00:07:38.263
that his scribe can't see it.

00:07:38.263 --> 00:07:40.370
But the general presumption
was that these letters

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.380
were going to be
copied and shared.

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:44.220
And we have other
examples of this, too.

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.050
We have the example
of Roman books,

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.100
and Roman books were
also social media.

00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:52.600
They were passed around
from person to person.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:54.960
And they would be a
box full of scrolls.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:57.314
And if go back to here,
the guy on the right here,

00:07:57.314 --> 00:07:58.230
this is Terentius Neo.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.834
He's a baker in Pompeii.

00:07:59.834 --> 00:08:02.250
And he's holding a scroll, and
it's got a red label on it.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.810
And the red label
is like the spine

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:05.570
of a book in that it
allows us to identify

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.010
what it is when it's on a shelf.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.593
And his wife there, who seems
to have done the books for him--

00:08:09.593 --> 00:08:12.230
he was baking and she
was doing the money--

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:15.198
is holding a Samsung Galaxy
Note 3, as you can see.

00:08:15.198 --> 00:08:18.840
But it's a Roman wax tablet,
and it was used to make notes.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.090
And you used it with a stylus.

00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:22.300
And that was how you kind
of kept track of things.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.994
And in fact, we see Cicero
sending sort of text messages

00:08:24.994 --> 00:08:26.410
in Rome using one
of these things.

00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:27.785
He'll write a
letter to somebody.

00:08:27.785 --> 00:08:30.205
The messenger will carry
it, bring it back, and then

00:08:30.205 --> 00:08:32.080
have it written the
result, the answer on it.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:34.840
And that way, they don't
have to use papyrus.

00:08:34.840 --> 00:08:36.450
Anyway, so books
would have looked

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.075
like a bunch of these
scrolls in a box.

00:08:38.075 --> 00:08:40.450
And if I was an author
and I'd written a book,

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.408
then I wouldn't expect
to make any money on it.

00:08:42.408 --> 00:08:44.720
What I would do instead is
I would give a copy of it

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.810
to-- I would dedicate
the book to the richest,

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.400
most influential person I knew
who had a big library with lots

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:50.774
of foot traffic
going through it.

00:08:50.774 --> 00:08:53.450
And the idea was that the
philosophers and intellectuals

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.450
going through the
library would see my book

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:57.310
and would read it, and go,
oh, this is great stuff.

00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:58.810
And then they would turn
on the Roman broadband.

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:00.972
They'd say to the patron, could
I have a copy of this, please?

00:09:00.972 --> 00:09:03.056
And he'd go, sure, I'll get
the scribes to make you one

00:09:03.056 --> 00:09:04.340
and send it around
in the morning.

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.715
And so the scribes
would all have

00:09:05.715 --> 00:09:07.759
to stay up all night
making this copy.

00:09:07.759 --> 00:09:09.425
But then it would
reach another library.

00:09:09.425 --> 00:09:11.995
And then people visiting that
library might do the same,

00:09:11.995 --> 00:09:13.411
saying, can I have
a copy of this?

00:09:13.411 --> 00:09:15.140
And as an Roman
author, you knew you'd

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:18.347
succeeded if you went to the
bookseller street in Rome

00:09:18.347 --> 00:09:20.805
and you saw your book on sale
because the booksellers would

00:09:20.805 --> 00:09:22.340
only bother to make
copies of books

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.840
they were being
asked for regularly.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:25.082
They would only
make them if they

00:09:25.082 --> 00:09:26.325
were sure they would
be able to sell.

00:09:26.325 --> 00:09:27.816
So as an author, I wouldn't
make any money from this.

00:09:27.816 --> 00:09:29.865
But I would know that
my book had succeeded.

00:09:29.865 --> 00:09:32.470
And I would expect payback
in the form of patronage

00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:35.150
and a cushy job and
this sort of thing.

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:36.650
The other thing
that was distributed

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:38.477
socially by the Romans
was their newspaper.

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:39.970
The Romans had the
first newspaper.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:43.169
It was founded by Julius Caesar
in 59 BC, which kind of makes

00:09:43.169 --> 00:09:44.710
him the founder of
my whole industry.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.920
And it's called the "Acta
Diurna"-- "diurna" meaning

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:50.520
daily, the root of the word
journalism and journal.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:53.010
And the idea was that
the "Acta Diurna"

00:09:53.010 --> 00:09:56.560
would have a summary of the
most important speeches given

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.005
the previous day in the
Senate and in the Peoples'

00:09:59.005 --> 00:10:01.450
Assembly, the two houses
of the Roman system.

00:10:01.450 --> 00:10:03.569
And it would also have
births, marraiges, deaths

00:10:03.569 --> 00:10:06.027
and so because those were very
important in Roman politics.

00:10:06.027 --> 00:10:08.155
And this was put
up in the forum.

00:10:08.155 --> 00:10:11.420
So exactly one copy of
this newspaper was made.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:14.629
And essentially the state
said, look, we've produced it.

00:10:14.629 --> 00:10:15.920
It's your job to distribute it.

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:18.040
It was left to
the audience to do

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:20.040
social distribution
of the newspaper.

00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.760
And the way they
would do it is they

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.756
would go down and read the
bits they're interested in

00:10:22.756 --> 00:10:23.589
and write them down.

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.910
Or in fact, they would send
a scribe down to do it,

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:27.285
if they were wealthy enough.

00:10:27.285 --> 00:10:30.365
And the scribe would sketch out
the bits of the newspaper that

00:10:30.365 --> 00:10:32.850
were relevant on a device that
also looks quite familiar.

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.460
This is a Roman iPad.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:38.272
It's exactly the size and
aspect ratio of an iPad.

00:10:38.272 --> 00:10:40.280
And as you can see, it's
got scribbles on it.

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:42.530
And this is how you would
read the news over breakfast

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:45.157
if you were a Roman nobleman.

00:10:45.157 --> 00:10:46.490
So this is what they used to do.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:49.343
And then I could copy
the bits of the news

00:10:49.343 --> 00:10:52.229
that I thought were
relevant to my friends.

00:10:52.229 --> 00:10:54.640
And again, we see this
in Cicero's letters

00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.500
and those of Pliny
the Elder and Tacitus.

00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.150
When they're outside
Rome, they've

00:10:58.150 --> 00:11:00.912
got their friends sending
them highlights of the news

00:11:00.912 --> 00:11:02.620
to keep them informed,
and in some cases,

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.586
entire copies of the news.

00:11:04.586 --> 00:11:06.370
Cicero asks one of
his friends to do

00:11:06.370 --> 00:11:09.330
this when he's sent to be the
governor of what's basically

00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:10.794
Syria now.

00:11:10.794 --> 00:11:12.835
And Caelius, his
friend, is so desperate

00:11:12.835 --> 00:11:14.210
not to leave
anything out that he

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.640
has an entire copy of
the "Acta" made everyday.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.077
And Cicero quickly stops
him and says, look,

00:11:19.077 --> 00:11:19.910
this is oversharing.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:21.368
I don't need the
gladiator results.

00:11:21.368 --> 00:11:21.990
I'm serious.

00:11:21.990 --> 00:11:22.910
That's what he said.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.020
And he just wanted
the political news.

00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:27.050
And he wanted crucially
Caelius' commentary

00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:30.569
on the political news
because he didn't just

00:11:30.569 --> 00:11:31.610
want the raw information.

00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:33.360
He wanted his friend
to filter it for him.

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.355
So the Romans were
distributing and filtering

00:11:35.355 --> 00:11:38.390
and copying news and other
documents for their friends.

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:41.000
So this is a social
media ecosystem.

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:44.290
The most effective use of the
system was the Apostle Paul.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.364
If you think about
Paul's epistles

00:11:46.364 --> 00:11:49.395
to the various churches that
he'd founded around Asia Minor

00:11:49.395 --> 00:11:51.024
and Greece and
elsewhere, you can

00:11:51.024 --> 00:11:52.940
see that there's social
distribution going on.

00:11:52.940 --> 00:11:54.970
So this is his letter
to the Colossians--

00:11:54.970 --> 00:11:56.636
"After this letter
has been read to you,

00:11:56.636 --> 00:11:58.100
see that it is also read in
the church of the Laodiceans

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.700
and that you in turn read
the letter from Laodicea."

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.693
What the churches in his
network were doing was

00:12:02.693 --> 00:12:04.090
they were all
copying the letters

00:12:04.090 --> 00:12:05.320
that Paul wrote
them to each other.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.795
And he knew this was happening.

00:12:06.795 --> 00:12:09.730
And it had the beneficial effect
of binding them all together

00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:11.640
into this community
of churches that

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:13.570
felt that they were
part of a wider network.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.080
Some of them were
being persecuted.

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:16.190
Some of them were
having problems.

00:12:16.190 --> 00:12:18.690
There were doctrinal differences
that needed to be resolved.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.485
And Paul could just
write to one church

00:12:20.485 --> 00:12:22.760
where a particular argument
was taking place and say,

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.890
you need to do this.

00:12:23.890 --> 00:12:26.131
And he could be confident
that his views would

00:12:26.131 --> 00:12:27.380
ripple to the other churches.

00:12:27.380 --> 00:12:29.130
And at the time, Paul's
having an argument

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:33.241
with other early members of the
Christian church, some of whom

00:12:33.241 --> 00:12:35.490
think that Christianity ought
to be open only to Jews.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.287
And Paul disagrees
with that and thinks

00:12:37.287 --> 00:12:38.620
it ought to be open to everyone.

00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:41.509
And his social media campaign
is so effective that he wins.

00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:43.300
And that shapes the
early Christian church.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:47.550
So it ends up shaping the way
that Christianity evolves.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:50.901
And in fact, still today when
you hear the Epistle-- you

00:12:50.901 --> 00:12:52.651
go to church and you
hear the Epistle--

00:12:52.651 --> 00:12:54.359
that is the social
distribution that Paul

00:12:54.359 --> 00:12:57.267
started still going on today.

00:12:57.267 --> 00:12:59.100
Let's jump forward a
bit to another example.

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.242
I've many examples of
different social media

00:13:01.242 --> 00:13:01.723
ecosystems in the book.

00:13:01.723 --> 00:13:03.806
But I'm just going to look
at three quickly today.

00:13:03.806 --> 00:13:06.634
The second also involves the
church, the Catholic Church.

00:13:06.634 --> 00:13:08.050
This time they're
on the receiving

00:13:08.050 --> 00:13:10.575
end of the social media
campaign, and launching it

00:13:10.575 --> 00:13:12.901
is that chap at the bottom
right who is Martin Luther.

00:13:12.901 --> 00:13:16.590
And the chap on the top
left is a pamphlet seller.

00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:19.830
And this is because Luther
wrote a series of pamphlets

00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:21.810
that took on doctrine
in the Catholic Church,

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.810
in particular the doctrine
of indulgences, which

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:26.171
is the "get out of
purgatory free" ticket.

00:13:26.171 --> 00:13:27.170
Well, they weren't free.

00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:28.495
That was the problem.

00:13:28.495 --> 00:13:31.782
The church made people buy
these tickets to ensure

00:13:31.782 --> 00:13:34.342
that they and their relatives
would supposedly get out

00:13:34.342 --> 00:13:36.240
of purgatory more
quickly after they died.

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:38.660
And Luther thought this
was straightforwardly

00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:41.380
a way of fleecing the poor to
pay for the construction of St.

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:43.670
Peter's in Rome, which
is exactly what it was.

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:46.519
And so he wrote a
list of 95 reasons why

00:13:46.519 --> 00:13:48.560
he thought this was a bad
idea and invited people

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:49.364
to a public debate.

00:13:49.364 --> 00:13:50.780
So if he'd done
it today, it would

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.940
have been a Buzzfeed post
with 95 crazy reasons

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.430
why the Pope is wrong
about indulgences.

00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:57.495
But it wasn't a Buzzfeed post.

00:13:57.495 --> 00:13:58.300
It was 1518.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.870
So instead, he wrote it
in Latin, handwritten,

00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.260
and he pinned it to the door
of the church in Wittenberg

00:14:03.260 --> 00:14:05.210
where he was a theologian.

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.710
And this was really hot stuff.

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:08.752
So people stated copying
it down and sending it

00:14:08.752 --> 00:14:09.460
to their friends.

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:10.270
So far, so Roman.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:13.530
This is bits of paper with
Latin on them flying around.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.955
Paper, not papyrus, but
essentially the same idea.

00:14:15.955 --> 00:14:19.886
However, in the intervening
period since the Romans,

00:14:19.886 --> 00:14:22.350
the printing press has appeared.

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:24.625
So when printers get a
hold of this, and they go,

00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:26.375
wow, this is really
hot stuff, and they

00:14:26.375 --> 00:14:28.630
print a thousand copies of it,
it spreads a lot more quickly.

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:30.100
And when those
printed copies reach

00:14:30.100 --> 00:14:32.470
other towns that also have
printing presses and people

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:34.598
are making a fuss about
this, those printers

00:14:34.598 --> 00:14:35.308
realize there's a market.

00:14:35.308 --> 00:14:36.727
And they print
another 1,000 copies,

00:14:36.727 --> 00:14:38.018
and they ripple somewhere else.

00:14:38.018 --> 00:14:41.440
And the net result is that
Martin Luther's 95 theses,

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.820
these 95 things that
he wanted to debate,

00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:46.460
spread throughout the whole
of Germany in two weeks

00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:48.560
and throughout the whole
of continental Europe

00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:50.790
in four weeks.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:53.981
So this is a description by
one of Luther's contemporaries.

00:14:53.981 --> 00:14:55.605
This was a complete
surprise to Luther.

00:14:55.605 --> 00:14:56.950
He hadn't expected this at all.

00:14:56.950 --> 00:14:58.770
He said the theses are
printed and circulated

00:14:58.770 --> 00:14:59.600
far beyond my expectation.

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:01.474
But he realized that
this was an opportunity.

00:15:01.474 --> 00:15:03.899
He could use this system,
the fact that there seemed

00:15:03.899 --> 00:15:05.690
to be quite a lot of
sympathy for his views

00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:09.034
to the extent which people
would actually propagate them

00:15:09.034 --> 00:15:09.880
for him.

00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.160
So he responded.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.350
He followed up with
a series of pamphlets

00:15:13.350 --> 00:15:15.845
that were written not
in Latin, but in German

00:15:15.845 --> 00:15:17.992
because German was far
more easily understandable.

00:15:17.992 --> 00:15:21.260
And also, they were written in a
very deliberately simple German

00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:23.183
that didn't use local
dialects or idioms.

00:15:23.183 --> 00:15:24.766
So they could be
understood throughout

00:15:24.766 --> 00:15:26.432
the German-speaking lands.

00:15:26.432 --> 00:15:28.820
And he produced a series
of these pamphlets.

00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:31.990
And they, like the 95
theses, spread very quickly

00:15:31.990 --> 00:15:32.587
on their own.

00:15:32.587 --> 00:15:34.670
All he had to do was give
the text to one printer,

00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:36.169
usually the printer
in his hometown.

00:15:36.169 --> 00:15:37.566
No money changes hands.

00:15:37.566 --> 00:15:39.214
That printer prints
1,000 copies.

00:15:39.214 --> 00:15:40.380
They go to the nearby towns.

00:15:40.380 --> 00:15:42.725
The printers there reprint
them, and so on and so on.

00:15:42.725 --> 00:15:43.515
And it ripples.

00:15:43.515 --> 00:15:46.291
Now these days, we measure the
effectiveness of a social media

00:15:46.291 --> 00:15:48.079
campaign looking at
the number of ripples,

00:15:48.079 --> 00:15:51.810
the number of +1s or re-tweets
or Likes or reblogs or repins

00:15:51.810 --> 00:15:52.820
or whatever.

00:15:52.820 --> 00:15:55.290
It turns out you can do
the same for Martin Luther.

00:15:55.290 --> 00:15:57.760
And if you look at his sort of
traffic stats, you get this.

00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.724
And this is the
number of pamphlets

00:16:00.724 --> 00:16:02.206
that had been
printed or reprinted

00:16:02.206 --> 00:16:05.664
in each year during the early
years of the Reformation.

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:09.030
So start down there and
you can see in 1523,

00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:10.800
there's this massive
traffic spike.

00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:13.870
And the blue is the
Latin pamphlets,

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:15.370
and the red is the
German pamphlets.

00:16:15.370 --> 00:16:17.801
And the darker bits are
the number of new pamphlets

00:16:17.801 --> 00:16:18.301
by Luther.

00:16:18.301 --> 00:16:19.759
And the lighter
bits are the number

00:16:19.759 --> 00:16:21.290
of reprints of pamphlets.

00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:23.045
So you can see in
1523, it's said

00:16:23.045 --> 00:16:25.400
to be 3/4-- a bit
more-- of the pamphlets,

00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.114
call it 350 reprints,
are going on there.

00:16:29.114 --> 00:16:31.280
And let's assume they
had 1,000 copies each.

00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:32.860
That's 350,000
just in that year.

00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:35.980
And actually, over the
whole of the first decade

00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:38.296
of the Reformation,
there's about 5

00:16:38.296 --> 00:16:40.935
to 7 million pamphlets
whizzing around in Europe.

00:16:40.935 --> 00:16:42.992
And they're amazingly
accessible unlike a book.

00:16:42.992 --> 00:16:44.450
I mean, the Gutenberg
Bible, if you

00:16:44.450 --> 00:16:46.190
were going to buy that, it's
like buying a very, very

00:16:46.190 --> 00:16:47.112
expensive car.

00:16:47.112 --> 00:16:48.956
It's not something
everyone could afford.

00:16:48.956 --> 00:16:50.970
A pamphlet cost about
the same as a chicken.

00:16:50.970 --> 00:16:54.630
So it was a reasonable thing
for a literate working man,

00:16:54.630 --> 00:16:58.155
a blacksmith or
a weaver, to buy.

00:16:58.155 --> 00:17:00.500
And as a result, they did.

00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.564
And it was very often the
first printed document

00:17:02.564 --> 00:17:03.466
that they owned.

00:17:03.466 --> 00:17:06.971
And so the effect of this was to
spread Martin Luther's message

00:17:06.971 --> 00:17:07.720
all around Europe.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.268
The Catholic Church was
pretty useless at responding.

00:17:10.268 --> 00:17:11.976
The Pope said, they
don't have to respond

00:17:11.976 --> 00:17:13.470
because I'm infallible.

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.240
So why bother?

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:16.136
Which is pretty much
what large companies

00:17:16.136 --> 00:17:17.760
said when bloggers
were rude about them

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:18.676
five or six years ago.

00:17:18.676 --> 00:17:21.246
They were, well, why do we
care about some stupid blogger?

00:17:21.246 --> 00:17:23.329
But then when the blogger
starts to gain traction,

00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:24.359
you realize you need to respond.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:26.616
But then you need to do
a good job of responding.

00:17:26.616 --> 00:17:28.140
And the Pope didn't do a
very good job of responding.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:30.150
He asked the bishops to
respond on his behalf.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:33.795
And they responded in Latin,
where almost no one would read

00:17:33.795 --> 00:17:35.982
them, and with an
argument that Luther

00:17:35.982 --> 00:17:38.079
had to be wrong because
the Pope is infallible.

00:17:38.079 --> 00:17:39.870
And this was not a very
convincing argument

00:17:39.870 --> 00:17:42.107
even when translated
later into German.

00:17:42.107 --> 00:17:44.190
And so Martin Luther
basically had the best of it.

00:17:44.190 --> 00:17:46.730
And the result was
that the church split.

00:17:46.730 --> 00:17:49.221
And this was the result
of his canny recognition

00:17:49.221 --> 00:17:51.620
of the power of
social distribution.

00:17:51.620 --> 00:17:54.881
Let's jump forward again,
now to the 17th century.

00:17:54.881 --> 00:17:56.380
This is one of my
favorite examples.

00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.005
I've touched on this
in a previous book

00:17:58.005 --> 00:17:59.395
about the history of drinking.

00:17:59.395 --> 00:18:00.345
This is a coffeehouse.

00:18:00.345 --> 00:18:04.050
And the coffeehouses in England
were fantastically alluring

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.210
social media environments.

00:18:06.210 --> 00:18:08.360
So you can see all these
chaps with their hats

00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:10.126
on and their wigs
in a coffeehouse.

00:18:10.126 --> 00:18:12.000
And there are lots of
documents on the table.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.583
This is because a
coffeehouse is where

00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:15.542
you went to read
stuff and discuss it.

00:18:15.542 --> 00:18:17.500
And sometimes the
discussions got a bit heated,

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.916
which is why the
guy in the middle

00:18:18.916 --> 00:18:22.056
is throwing his coffee over the
person on the left whose hat is

00:18:22.056 --> 00:18:22.592
coming off.

00:18:22.592 --> 00:18:24.550
But that wasn't how you
were supposed to do it.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:26.758
What you were supposed to
do is go to the coffeehouse

00:18:26.758 --> 00:18:28.580
and read all the
stuff that they had,

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.550
which would be news
books and pamphlets

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:32.460
and handwritten
newsletters and broadsides

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:34.668
and all sorts of things like
that, all the stuff that

00:18:34.668 --> 00:18:35.660
came out.

00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.652
And coffeehouses were
very often specialists

00:18:37.652 --> 00:18:38.610
in particular subjects.

00:18:38.610 --> 00:18:41.020
So there might be one where
the scientists went to,

00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.560
and one where the
sailors went to,

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.920
and one where the
marine insurers went to,

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.130
and one where the priests
went to, and so on.

00:18:47.130 --> 00:18:49.919
So you have to sort of
filter this massive load

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:51.960
of information by going
to the right coffeehouse.

00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:53.640
And you'd find the
right kind of people.

00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.223
And you could join
that social network

00:18:55.223 --> 00:18:57.120
and discuss stuff with them.

00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.800
But there was this
rule that coffeehouses

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.050
forced the patrons
who attended them

00:19:02.050 --> 00:19:04.212
to leave class
distinctions at the door.

00:19:04.212 --> 00:19:05.920
And this meant that,
in theory, at least,

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:08.980
"gentleman, mechanic, lord,
and scoundrel" could mix.

00:19:08.980 --> 00:19:12.810
And this was,
actually, a new thing.

00:19:12.810 --> 00:19:15.840
It meant that ideas could
pass from one social group

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.397
to another in ways
that they maybe

00:19:17.397 --> 00:19:18.480
couldn't have done before.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.185
And so you have all of these
unexpected collisions of ideas

00:19:21.185 --> 00:19:23.772
and of people taking
place in coffeehouses.

00:19:23.772 --> 00:19:25.230
Now this is
fantastically exciting.

00:19:25.230 --> 00:19:27.030
If you look at the
diary of Samuel Pepys,

00:19:27.030 --> 00:19:29.657
he's often saying thanks
to the coffeehouse.

00:19:29.657 --> 00:19:31.990
And the reason he liked going
there, well, you then see.

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:33.333
He describes the
amazing things he

00:19:33.333 --> 00:19:34.999
learned when we went
to the coffeehouse.

00:19:34.999 --> 00:19:37.550
He met a merchant who'd
been to the South Seas

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.220
and had seen that
some of the people

00:19:39.220 --> 00:19:41.723
there had learned to write
with their feet just as well

00:19:41.723 --> 00:19:42.557
as with their hands.

00:19:42.557 --> 00:19:44.890
Or he learned that there was
an amazing new fruit called

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:46.820
pineapple.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:48.562
So this was a very
alluring environment

00:19:48.562 --> 00:19:50.270
because you never knew
who you might meet

00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:51.395
or what you might find out.

00:19:51.395 --> 00:19:54.330
And people would go there for
hours and just sort of while

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.702
away the time reading stuff
and talking to people.

00:19:56.702 --> 00:19:58.160
And then if they
wanted to respond,

00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.327
they might write a pamphlet.

00:19:59.327 --> 00:20:00.868
And then they knew
which coffeehouses

00:20:00.868 --> 00:20:02.544
to leave it in because
they specialized

00:20:02.544 --> 00:20:03.460
in different subjects.

00:20:03.460 --> 00:20:06.300
So this sounds very
familiar to us today.

00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:08.890
Some people actually
complained that coffeehouses

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:10.920
were too alluring,
luring people away

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:15.100
from more constructive things
that they might be doing, which

00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:17.217
again is quite a
modern criticism, which

00:20:17.217 --> 00:20:18.400
we'll return to in a minute.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:20.430
Anyway, so those
are three examples.

00:20:20.430 --> 00:20:22.160
There's a bunch more
of them in the book.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.464
This is a commonplace book.

00:20:23.464 --> 00:20:25.630
Commonplace books are quite
interesting because they

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:27.970
were books where you wrote
down cool stuff so you

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:29.000
could get to it later.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.917
And it was usually cool
stuff by other people.

00:20:30.917 --> 00:20:31.708
It might be by you.

00:20:31.708 --> 00:20:33.660
But a lot of the time
it would be a new sonnet

00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:36.175
that you'd heard, maybe a
friend had sent you a letter,

00:20:36.175 --> 00:20:39.680
or it might be an aphorism,
or a quote from the classics,

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.750
or a good quote from a play,
or really good put-down.

00:20:43.750 --> 00:20:46.340
And you would put all of this
stuff in your commonplace book

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:47.230
because the act
of writing it down

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:48.776
would make it easier
to remember it,

00:20:48.776 --> 00:20:51.220
and you could also
retrieve it later.

00:20:51.220 --> 00:20:53.549
And this is, I think,
very similar to the way

00:20:53.549 --> 00:20:55.840
that people use things like
Tumblr and Pinterest today.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.310
Because commonplace books were
a means of self-expression.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:02.129
If I swap commonplace
books with you,

00:21:02.129 --> 00:21:04.170
we might copy bits out
that we thought were cool.

00:21:04.170 --> 00:21:06.920
But the stuff that I chose
to put in my commonplace book

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.958
or chose to pass on to
other people by post

00:21:08.958 --> 00:21:11.150
so that they could put in
their commonplace books

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:12.600
was a form of self-expression.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:14.854
This is what we see in
Tumblr and Pinterest.

00:21:14.854 --> 00:21:16.315
They are forms of
self-expression

00:21:16.315 --> 00:21:19.479
and self-definition based
around the curation mostly

00:21:19.479 --> 00:21:20.562
of other people's content.

00:21:20.562 --> 00:21:23.508
So 80% of the stuff on
Tumblr and on Pinterest

00:21:23.508 --> 00:21:25.963
is repinnings or reblogs
of other people's stuff.

00:21:25.963 --> 00:21:27.421
And that doesn't
mean it's any less

00:21:27.421 --> 00:21:29.400
of a medium of
self-expression than launching

00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:31.855
your own blog where
all of it's by you.

00:21:31.855 --> 00:21:34.310
So I think there's an
interesting parallel there.

00:21:34.310 --> 00:21:35.768
And then there's
a bunch of others.

00:21:35.768 --> 00:21:38.930
There's the poetry that was
passed around the Tudor court,

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:41.310
the pamphlets around the time
of the English Civil War,

00:21:41.310 --> 00:21:43.559
and in the run-up to the
American War of Independence,

00:21:43.559 --> 00:21:45.600
as we call it on our
side of the pond,

00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.730
and the French Revolution
a century later.

00:21:47.730 --> 00:21:50.820
All of these had social media
environments surrounding them

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.922
which I go into.

00:21:52.922 --> 00:21:53.630
So what happened?

00:21:53.630 --> 00:21:55.785
If it's the case that
social media's been around

00:21:55.785 --> 00:22:00.020
for 2,000 years, why have
we failed to notice this?

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.650
And essentially
what happened was

00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:04.790
that this peer-to-peer,
horizontal transmission,

00:22:04.790 --> 00:22:06.620
two-way conversational
system was

00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.215
replaced in the 19th
century by this.

00:22:09.215 --> 00:22:11.548
And this was because a series
of machines were invented.

00:22:11.548 --> 00:22:13.260
First was the steam
press and then

00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:15.600
the radio and the
TV transmitter.

00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:17.530
And they allowed
people, provided

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.460
they had access
to these machines,

00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:21.304
to send a message
very, very efficiently

00:22:21.304 --> 00:22:22.345
to a very large audience.

00:22:22.345 --> 00:22:24.390
And this hadn't been
possible before.

00:22:24.390 --> 00:22:26.232
And so we see, for
example, newspapers

00:22:26.232 --> 00:22:28.023
go from having a
circulation of about 1,000

00:22:28.023 --> 00:22:31.440
on average in the US at the
beginning of the 19th century,

00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.740
being very, very local,
little publications

00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.675
where a lot of the
stuff that's in them

00:22:34.675 --> 00:22:36.389
is actually written by
members of the local community

00:22:36.389 --> 00:22:38.321
just sending in
letters and things.

00:22:38.321 --> 00:22:40.736
Here's the speech I gave
and that sort of thing.

00:22:40.736 --> 00:22:41.702
So they were very much
sort of social platforms.

00:22:41.702 --> 00:22:44.600
By the end of the 19th century,
you have newspapers in the US.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.280
You have several with a
circulation of a million copies

00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:47.988
a day, and that's a
very different world.

00:22:47.988 --> 00:22:50.615
They're written by professional
journalists whose job is just

00:22:50.615 --> 00:22:52.656
to write stuff to go in
the paper to sell papers.

00:22:52.656 --> 00:22:55.012
Similarly, with
radio and TV, you

00:22:55.012 --> 00:22:56.220
can reach millions of people.

00:22:56.220 --> 00:22:59.150
But it's a one-way channel
that hardly anyone has access

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.586
to in the grand
scheme of things.

00:23:00.586 --> 00:23:03.070
And probably the most
infamous example is this.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:04.650
This is the Volksempfanger.

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:06.830
So you've heard of the
Volkswagen, the people's car.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:08.724
Well, the Nazis also
made the people's radio,

00:23:08.724 --> 00:23:10.140
people's receiver,
which was this.

00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:12.820
And "Ganz Deutschland
Hurt Den Fuhrer,"

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:15.300
which means the whole of
Germany hears the Fuhrer.

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:18.010
And you can see that this
radio is symbolically

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.392
in this poster binding
together all of the people

00:23:20.392 --> 00:23:23.810
and imposing upon them the view
of one man, the vision of one

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:25.195
man, Adolf Hitler.

00:23:25.195 --> 00:23:27.570
And this is as far away from
social media as you can get.

00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:29.090
This is not a conversation.

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:30.822
And moreover, the
Volksempfanger was

00:23:30.822 --> 00:23:33.280
designed so that it could only
pick up domestic broadcasts.

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.821
You couldn't pick
up any other points

00:23:34.821 --> 00:23:37.855
of view except what the German
government was putting out.

00:23:37.855 --> 00:23:40.342
So this is actually the
antithesis of social media

00:23:40.342 --> 00:23:41.800
and sort of as far
as the pendant's

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.154
swung in the other
direction towards tyranny.

00:23:44.154 --> 00:23:47.470
But now, social media is
back, thanks to the internet.

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:49.400
Because essentially,
if you look at it

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.470
in a sort of historical
context, the internet

00:23:52.470 --> 00:23:55.134
means that you can deliver
a message very cheaply

00:23:55.134 --> 00:23:56.300
to a large number of people.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:23:59.540
And it can actually take on the
power of broadcast distribution

00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:01.620
in a way that wasn't
previously possible.

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.570
So social systems were
overshadowed by broadcast

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:07.072
and by steam printing and so on.

00:24:07.072 --> 00:24:08.780
But now, they've been
able to fight back.

00:24:08.780 --> 00:24:12.106
And actually we see stuff that
becomes popular and becomes

00:24:12.106 --> 00:24:15.224
famous not because a broadcaster
has decided to show it

00:24:15.224 --> 00:24:17.390
or because a newspaper
editor thinks it's important,

00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:19.306
but just because enough
people on the internet

00:24:19.306 --> 00:24:22.534
think it's funny or think it's
relevant or think it's cool.

00:24:22.534 --> 00:24:24.950
So something like Gangnam style
or the woman the other day

00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:27.280
who resigned from her job
and videoed herself dancing

00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:30.424
around the office and that went
nuts, these sorts of things

00:24:30.424 --> 00:24:32.590
that you don't need the
endorsement of a large media

00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:35.365
organization to make
a splash anymore.

00:24:35.365 --> 00:24:38.265
And essentially, that's the
re-democratization of media

00:24:38.265 --> 00:24:39.900
that the internet
has made possible.

00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:42.270
So I think we need to look
at the history of media

00:24:42.270 --> 00:24:42.990
in a slightly different way.

00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:44.406
We're used to this
sort of framing

00:24:44.406 --> 00:24:48.060
where we had "old" media
that was analog and one-way

00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.523
and was sort of print
and broadcast, basically.

00:24:50.523 --> 00:24:51.981
And then we have
"new" media, which

00:24:51.981 --> 00:24:54.723
was digital and was two-way,
and we could be more social.

00:24:54.723 --> 00:24:56.380
And that's only
part of the picture.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:57.776
I think we actually should
look at it like this.

00:24:57.776 --> 00:25:00.630
And we need to think about the
period of "really old" media,

00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:03.470
which dominated much of
the past 2,000 years.

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:05.560
And "old" media was really
a very recent thing.

00:25:05.560 --> 00:25:08.095
I've dated it starting
at 1833 here, which

00:25:08.095 --> 00:25:10.900
is the year of the first
penny-press newspaper.

00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:12.975
It was founded in New
York, the "New York Sun."

00:25:12.975 --> 00:25:15.099
And that was really the
beginning of the mass media

00:25:15.099 --> 00:25:17.276
model because the
newspaper was priced

00:25:17.276 --> 00:25:20.254
to sell at a penny instead
of sixpence, or $0.06.

00:25:20.254 --> 00:25:22.545
And most of the revenue
actually came from advertising.

00:25:22.545 --> 00:25:24.590
So it was based on
a large circulation,

00:25:24.590 --> 00:25:25.780
advertiser-funded model.

00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:28.770
Well, that worked
fine until about 2007

00:25:28.770 --> 00:25:31.520
when the newspaper industry
peaked at 87% of its revenue

00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.440
from advertising.

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:36.030
And it's clearly been in very
swift decline since then.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:39.224
So I think this way
of looking at things

00:25:39.224 --> 00:25:40.640
shows us that "old"
media was sort

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:42.919
of a phase we went through.

00:25:42.919 --> 00:25:44.710
And that "new" media
and "really old" media

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:46.700
have quite a lot in
common with each other.

00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:48.991
And if that's the case, then
these ancient social media

00:25:48.991 --> 00:25:50.809
systems have lessons
for us today.

00:25:50.809 --> 00:25:52.600
So let's just quickly
look at three of them

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:55.410
from each of those examples
that I had early on.

00:25:55.410 --> 00:25:56.410
So here's the first one.

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.460
Is social media a dangerous
distraction that wastes time?

00:25:59.460 --> 00:26:01.280
This is the idea that instead
of calling it social networking,

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.010
it should more accurately by
called social not-working.

00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.551
And this is quite
a common criticism,

00:26:04.551 --> 00:26:06.476
or at least it was sort
of a few years ago,

00:26:06.476 --> 00:26:08.634
that you must ban
Facebook in the workplace.

00:26:08.634 --> 00:26:09.630
Otherwise no one will
get anything done.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:11.522
Definitely ban YouTube
or people will just

00:26:11.522 --> 00:26:13.242
spend all day watching kittens.

00:26:13.242 --> 00:26:14.950
And this turns out to
be a pretty-- well,

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:17.477
apart from the kittens--
a pretty old criticism.

00:26:17.477 --> 00:26:19.685
So if you look at what people
said about coffeehouses

00:26:19.685 --> 00:26:22.515
in the 1670s in Oxford,
there was great concern

00:26:22.515 --> 00:26:24.390
that students were
spending all of their time

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:25.780
in the coffeehouses.

00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:28.971
And this was going to lead to,
essentially, the ruin of Great

00:26:28.971 --> 00:26:31.470
Britain because all of our next
generation of great thinkers

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:35.190
were going to be just addling
their brains with coffee

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.057
and sharing information
in coffeehouses.

00:26:37.057 --> 00:26:39.392
And this was a similar
complaint in Cambridge,

00:26:39.392 --> 00:26:41.493
hours spent in talking and
less profitable reading

00:26:41.493 --> 00:26:42.670
of newspapers.

00:26:42.670 --> 00:26:46.339
And this was a pamphlet from
1673 criticizing coffeehouses

00:26:46.339 --> 00:26:48.130
and ironically distributed
in coffeehouses,

00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:50.171
saying that they were
"great enemies to diligence

00:26:50.171 --> 00:26:53.236
and industry" and the ruin
of "serious and hopeful

00:26:53.236 --> 00:26:54.212
young gentlemen."

00:26:54.212 --> 00:26:57.587
So this was, I think, quite a
familiar-sounding complaint.

00:26:57.587 --> 00:27:00.045
But actually, if you look at
what came out of coffeehouses,

00:27:00.045 --> 00:27:02.215
it turned out to be
completely wrong.

00:27:02.215 --> 00:27:04.799
They weren't enemies of
diligence and industry.

00:27:04.799 --> 00:27:06.590
They were actually
crucibles of innovation.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:08.810
If you look at the
coffeehouse culture,

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.930
there's an amazingly fertile,
intellectual environment

00:27:11.930 --> 00:27:14.270
because it allowed people
and ideas to mix in ways they

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:15.020
previously hadn't.

00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.770
And look at what came out
of the late 17th century

00:27:17.770 --> 00:27:20.350
coffeehouses, things like
the financial revolution.

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:22.395
So Jonathan's
Coffeehouse, where people

00:27:22.395 --> 00:27:25.330
when to discuss share
prices and to make deals

00:27:25.330 --> 00:27:27.677
turns into the London
Stock Exchange.

00:27:27.677 --> 00:27:29.260
Lloyd's Coffeehouse
turns into Lloyd's

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:31.636
of London, the first
insurance market.

00:27:31.636 --> 00:27:33.088
People used to go
there to meet--

00:27:33.088 --> 00:27:34.713
and they used to rent
specific tables--

00:27:34.713 --> 00:27:35.992
to discuss marine insurance.

00:27:35.992 --> 00:27:37.742
And my favorite example,
the Royal Society

00:27:37.742 --> 00:27:40.680
grows out of
coffeehouse discussions

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:43.230
by great scientists in
Oxford and then later

00:27:43.230 --> 00:27:44.810
in London as well.

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:46.993
And they used to go to
the Rainbow Coffeehouse.

00:27:46.993 --> 00:27:49.326
And Isaac Newton actually
writes "Principia Mathematica"

00:27:49.326 --> 00:27:53.496
in order to settle a coffeehouse
argument between Hooke, Halley,

00:27:53.496 --> 00:27:54.784
and Wren.

00:27:54.784 --> 00:27:57.050
So people are prepared to
say things in coffeehouses

00:27:57.050 --> 00:27:58.832
that maybe they wouldn't in
more formal circumstances.

00:27:58.832 --> 00:28:01.510
And imagine trying ideas out
and taking them for a walk,

00:28:01.510 --> 00:28:02.460
and discuss them.

00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:05.310
I think there's a lesson
for us there today.

00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:06.980
Forward-looking
companies are trying

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.255
to work out how to recreate
the spirit of the coffeehouse

00:28:10.255 --> 00:28:10.755
internally.

00:28:10.755 --> 00:28:12.296
Sometimes that's
physically, and they

00:28:12.296 --> 00:28:15.410
kind of coffee bars into their
campuses or their offices.

00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:18.370
And sometimes it's through the
use of internal social media

00:28:18.370 --> 00:28:20.375
to encourage collaboration
and innovation.

00:28:20.375 --> 00:28:22.030
And then there's
the question of how

00:28:22.030 --> 00:28:26.347
you extend that to your partners
and your customers and so on.

00:28:26.347 --> 00:28:27.981
But I think the
lesson of history

00:28:27.981 --> 00:28:30.083
is that social media
isn't just a distraction.

00:28:30.083 --> 00:28:32.499
It's actually an amazingly
powerful tool for collaboration

00:28:32.499 --> 00:28:34.192
if you use it correctly.

00:28:34.192 --> 00:28:36.400
Next, what's the role of
social media in revolutions?

00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:39.760
Again, a very popular subject
because of the Arab Spring.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:42.145
And it turns out we
can ask Martin Luther.

00:28:42.145 --> 00:28:44.686
Martin Luther says that "from
the rapid spread of the theses,

00:28:44.686 --> 00:28:46.800
I gather what the greater
part of the nation

00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:47.770
thinks of indulgences."

00:28:47.770 --> 00:28:49.825
So the fact that his
message spread so quickly

00:28:49.825 --> 00:28:51.200
without him having
to do anything

00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:54.160
told him that people supported
him and told the people who

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.937
were doing the distribution that
people supported him as well.

00:28:56.937 --> 00:28:58.520
And this is what
modern media scholars

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:00.260
call synchronization of opinion.

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.470
It's where people who
are under a regime

00:29:02.470 --> 00:29:05.330
that they don't like but aren't
sure how many other people feel

00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:08.051
the same way figure out how
many people feel the same way

00:29:08.051 --> 00:29:09.580
through the sharing of media.

00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.080
And that was done
in the Arab Spring

00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:15.145
by Wael Ghonim's page
of-- what was it--

00:29:15.145 --> 00:29:17.186
"We Are All Khaled Saeed"
and that sort of thing.

00:29:17.186 --> 00:29:20.380
When [INAUDIBLE] 1,000 Likes in
an hour and is then taken down,

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:24.640
you know that there's a lot of
people who feel the same way.

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:28.150
And that's what we also saw with
the spread of videos in Tunisia

00:29:28.150 --> 00:29:31.880
on YouTube as a sign of protest
following Mohamed Bouazizi's

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:33.100
self-immolation.

00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:35.120
So it's a very
similar model, which

00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.980
is that people are
able to work out

00:29:36.980 --> 00:29:38.920
that other people feel
the same way as them.

00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:41.859
In Martin Luther's case, if
I was living in the 1520s

00:29:41.859 --> 00:29:43.900
and I went to the printer
in my village and said,

00:29:43.900 --> 00:29:45.300
I hear there's a
new Martin Luther.

00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:45.955
Have you got a copy?

00:29:45.955 --> 00:29:47.190
And the printer says,
well, I had some yesterday,

00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:48.065
but they've all gone.

00:29:48.065 --> 00:29:50.189
Then I knew that lots of
other people in my village

00:29:50.189 --> 00:29:52.485
would be feeling the same
way as me, even if I've never

00:29:52.485 --> 00:29:53.255
spoken to them about it.

00:29:53.255 --> 00:29:55.046
And so it's this
synchronization of opinion

00:29:55.046 --> 00:29:56.180
that I think is important.

00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:58.604
And in fact, Jared Cohen,
another Googler, has, I think,

00:29:58.604 --> 00:30:00.270
put his finger on the
right way to think

00:30:00.270 --> 00:30:02.847
about this, which is that
social media doesn't spark.

00:30:02.847 --> 00:30:03.930
It doesn't cause the fire.

00:30:03.930 --> 00:30:07.765
But it helps it spread much more
quickly once it starts moving.

00:30:07.765 --> 00:30:08.759
It's an accelerant.

00:30:08.759 --> 00:30:11.250
And I think that's exactly the
right way to think about it.

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.750
Finally, is social media a fad?

00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:16.290
I think if we go back
to this diagram here,

00:30:16.290 --> 00:30:18.170
you can see that the
anomaly is actually

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:20.930
the "old" media, the mass media
period, the industrial media

00:30:20.930 --> 00:30:24.072
period, the period where
the technology needed

00:30:24.072 --> 00:30:25.530
to spread a message
widely happened

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:27.160
to be expensive and
subject to things

00:30:27.160 --> 00:30:28.630
like bandwidth limitations.

00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:30.500
And the internet does
away with all of that.

00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.364
So that looks like the anomaly.

00:30:32.364 --> 00:30:33.977
Social media isn't a fad.

00:30:33.977 --> 00:30:35.393
It's the mass-media
era that looks

00:30:35.393 --> 00:30:39.050
like the anomaly in
world historical terms.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:41.610
And that means that we,
social media users today,

00:30:41.610 --> 00:30:43.342
are heirs to a
centuries-long tradition.

00:30:43.342 --> 00:30:44.800
There are these
very nice parallels

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:47.660
between old forms of social
media and modern ones.

00:30:47.660 --> 00:30:50.180
that I hope will change the way
you think about social media

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.319
next time you log onto your
social network of choice.

00:30:53.319 --> 00:30:55.235
And I hope you'll believe
me and my contention

00:30:55.235 --> 00:30:58.452
that social media doesn't just
join us to each other today.

00:30:58.452 --> 00:30:59.660
It also links us to the past.

00:30:59.660 --> 00:31:00.480
Thank you.

00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:05.915
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:05.915 --> 00:31:07.540
TOM STANDAGE: Oh,
and there's the book,

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.081
which I think you
all have a copy of.

00:31:09.081 --> 00:31:10.076
AUDIENCE: Right.

00:31:10.076 --> 00:31:12.496
PRESENTER: Questions?

00:31:12.496 --> 00:31:14.910
AUDIENCE: What about
social media like Reddit?

00:31:14.910 --> 00:31:17.326
Do you see an equivalent to
that now with previous things?

00:31:17.326 --> 00:31:20.230
Would that be closest
to a common book?

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:22.188
TOM STANDAGE: I think
both Reddit and something

00:31:22.188 --> 00:31:24.140
like the Huffington Post are
examples of social news, which

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:25.790
is kind of the
analogy I've drawn

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:28.180
there is with the Roman system.

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:29.875
So what Reddit does
is it essentially

00:31:29.875 --> 00:31:33.190
allows you to say, oh, god,
there's so much stuff out there

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.813
that I need help filtering it.

00:31:35.813 --> 00:31:39.115
And if you look at the history
of information more broadly,

00:31:39.115 --> 00:31:41.134
every time there's a
publishing technology that

00:31:41.134 --> 00:31:43.300
makes more stuff available,
people feel overwhelmed,

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.432
and you get complaints
about information overload

00:31:45.432 --> 00:31:47.240
And then they
respond by inventing

00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:49.290
things that help them
do filtering better.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.620
So the classic example
in the case of books

00:31:51.620 --> 00:31:55.470
was they invent things like book
reviews and literature reviews

00:31:55.470 --> 00:31:57.759
and bibliographies and table
of contents and indices.

00:31:57.759 --> 00:32:00.300
And that enables you to find
the stuff that's relevant to you

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.260
without having to read all
the books in the world, which

00:32:02.260 --> 00:32:03.380
is plainly impossible.

00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:05.960
And on the internet, we've
gone through the same thing

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.030
with we had Yahoo that
had a directory model.

00:32:08.030 --> 00:32:10.196
And then we had Google that
did a pure search model.

00:32:10.196 --> 00:32:12.430
And then we had sort of
social things like Twitter.

00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:16.720
And now we're seeing this hybrid
social search thing emerging.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.255
But what it's doing
in each case is

00:32:18.255 --> 00:32:20.117
trying to help us find
the relevant stuff.

00:32:20.117 --> 00:32:21.700
Reddit I put in that
category as well.

00:32:21.700 --> 00:32:23.757
Essentially, this is what
the Romans were doing, too.

00:32:23.757 --> 00:32:26.257
They were saying, look, I can't
figure out what's important.

00:32:26.257 --> 00:32:28.810
So I'm going to use my
friends to work it out for me.

00:32:28.810 --> 00:32:31.630
And I'm going to trust what
they say because I trust them.

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:32.670
And I also want to hear
what their commentary

00:32:32.670 --> 00:32:33.570
on these things is.

00:32:33.570 --> 00:32:36.385
And then I'll put
all that together.

00:32:36.385 --> 00:32:38.336
I actually did a piece
on this, funny enough

00:32:38.336 --> 00:32:40.586
for the Huffington Post,
where I said, sorry, Arianna,

00:32:40.586 --> 00:32:43.240
but Julius Caesar got
there way, way before you.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.890
And that we think that
things at HuffPo and Reddit

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:49.060
are-- or using Twitter in
this way-- are very new.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:53.170
But actually that's exactly
what the Romans were doing.

00:32:53.170 --> 00:32:56.910
AUDIENCE: So roughly speaking,
the mass media anomaly

00:32:56.910 --> 00:33:02.482
corresponds to the time when
people who generate content

00:33:02.482 --> 00:33:04.725
get paid for it directly.

00:33:04.725 --> 00:33:07.150
TOM STANDAGE: Yeah, it's
a commercial thing, yeah.

00:33:07.150 --> 00:33:08.023
Because the big
machines that spread

00:33:08.023 --> 00:33:09.090
it are expensive to maintain.

00:33:09.090 --> 00:33:10.548
And so you need to
have some model.

00:33:10.548 --> 00:33:12.740
And that means having
advertisers fund it.

00:33:12.740 --> 00:33:16.010
And then you have to have
incentives for the journalists.

00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:17.480
And you only get
paid journalists

00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:20.280
in that period, really,
for the first time as well.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:23.130
AUDIENCE: Do you see that that's
going to go away going forward?

00:33:23.130 --> 00:33:25.630
TOM STANDAGE: I don't think
it's going to go away completely

00:33:25.630 --> 00:33:28.296
because I don't think mass media
is going to go away completely.

00:33:28.296 --> 00:33:30.790
We are going into a
hybrid world where

00:33:30.790 --> 00:33:34.366
things like reality TV and sport
make most sense to distribute

00:33:34.366 --> 00:33:35.365
those through broadcast.

00:33:35.365 --> 00:33:37.490
But we already see the
stuff that people time shift

00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:38.823
and the stuff that people don't.

00:33:38.823 --> 00:33:41.290
And we see Twitter sort of
piling on to the live TV

00:33:41.290 --> 00:33:43.690
stuff as the most
promising business model.

00:33:43.690 --> 00:33:46.150
So I think there are going
to be some things that where

00:33:46.150 --> 00:33:48.552
broadcast still makes sense.

00:33:48.552 --> 00:33:50.135
But that said, I
think there are going

00:33:50.135 --> 00:33:51.218
to be a lot fewer of them.

00:33:51.218 --> 00:33:54.220
And I think no one knows these
industries are [? living. ?]

00:33:54.220 --> 00:33:55.215
And I think it's quite
funny that journalists

00:33:55.215 --> 00:33:56.860
are used to writing about
the decline of the car-maker

00:33:56.860 --> 00:33:58.020
or the decline of
the steam engine.

00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:00.050
But when it happens to their
industry, they say, oh, no.

00:34:00.050 --> 00:34:01.044
No, this is terrible.

00:34:01.044 --> 00:34:02.710
And we need the
government to intervene.

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:04.309
There's some
God-given right they

00:34:04.309 --> 00:34:06.479
have to have the industry
the size that it is.

00:34:06.479 --> 00:34:07.937
The music industry
has got smaller,

00:34:07.937 --> 00:34:10.370
but is growing again now.

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:13.470
The newspaper industry is
going to get a lot smaller.

00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:16.449
I'm pretty sure of it.

00:34:16.449 --> 00:34:18.810
I think the crucial thing
for all of these industries,

00:34:18.810 --> 00:34:20.518
if they want to stay
alive as industries,

00:34:20.518 --> 00:34:23.306
is they need to find a way
to make sharing their friend.

00:34:23.306 --> 00:34:25.139
And we see that music
has gone through that.

00:34:25.139 --> 00:34:27.060
Music has figured out that you
basically give away the music

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.340
or charge very little for it.

00:34:28.340 --> 00:34:30.090
When I pay iTunes for
something on iTunes,

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:31.280
I'm not really
paying for the music.

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.821
I'm paying for the
convenience of not

00:34:32.821 --> 00:34:34.929
having to go onto BitTorrent.

00:34:34.929 --> 00:34:37.550
It's really a
convenience of delivery.

00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:41.681
And then Spotify has essentially
this convenience mobile premium

00:34:41.681 --> 00:34:43.010
model.

00:34:43.010 --> 00:34:44.850
So you make the money
elsewhere, which

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:46.308
is just what the
Roman authors did.

00:34:46.308 --> 00:34:48.260
They didn't make money
from the content.

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:49.375
They made it elsewhere.

00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:51.374
And we see that some
industries have figured out

00:34:51.374 --> 00:34:52.350
how to do this.

00:34:52.350 --> 00:34:53.698
The movie industry doesn't.

00:34:53.698 --> 00:34:55.989
The movie industry is saying
there must be a model that

00:34:55.989 --> 00:34:58.511
allows us to go on making a
quarter of a billion dollar

00:34:58.511 --> 00:34:59.802
{blockbuster.} But there isn't.

00:34:59.802 --> 00:35:00.800
And I don't think
the world will mourn

00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:02.258
when these stupid--
I mean, they're

00:35:02.258 --> 00:35:04.210
just getting sillier and
sillier, I would say.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:05.626
So actually, going
back to a world

00:35:05.626 --> 00:35:07.990
of much simpler
and cheaper films

00:35:07.990 --> 00:35:10.470
that are maybe funded through
Kickstarter or something,

00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:12.345
I don't think that would
be a terrible thing.

00:35:12.345 --> 00:35:13.928
The most interesting
example, I think,

00:35:13.928 --> 00:35:15.986
is video games where
the Asian video game

00:35:15.986 --> 00:35:19.151
model is particularly
clever because you basically

00:35:19.151 --> 00:35:20.400
give away the client software.

00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:23.175
You encourage people to share
it with their friends as much as

00:35:23.175 --> 00:35:24.264
possible, and put
it on BitTorrent,

00:35:24.264 --> 00:35:25.350
and all that kind of thing.

00:35:25.350 --> 00:35:27.680
It allows you to play this
massively multiplayer online

00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:28.692
role-playing game free.

00:35:28.692 --> 00:35:31.150
And so you get a big community
of people playing this game.

00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:32.816
And then you sell
them in-game upgrades.

00:35:32.816 --> 00:35:34.722
And that's the bit
they can't actually

00:35:34.722 --> 00:35:36.100
share with their friends.

00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:38.817
So that is a model which
makes sharing work for you

00:35:38.817 --> 00:35:39.442
as an industry.

00:35:39.442 --> 00:35:41.406
And I think that's the challenge
that industries all face now.

00:35:41.406 --> 00:35:42.406
This is going to happen.

00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:44.538
How do you make it your
friend and not your enemy?

00:35:44.538 --> 00:35:46.538
And how do you just go
beyond sticking your head

00:35:46.538 --> 00:35:49.030
in the ground and pretending
it's going to go away?

00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.950
And we saw the music
industry go through that.

00:35:49.950 --> 00:35:51.420
And I think they're
out of it now.

00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:53.054
It's sometimes hard to tell.

00:35:53.054 --> 00:35:55.220
Movies are still fairly
head-in-the-sand about these

00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:55.462
things.

00:35:55.462 --> 00:35:57.770
The newspaper industry is
totally head-in-the sand.

00:35:57.770 --> 00:36:00.485
You go to the sort of events
that I sometimes go to

00:36:00.485 --> 00:36:01.985
and people are sort
of saying, where

00:36:01.985 --> 00:36:03.610
is the model we find
that will allow things

00:36:03.610 --> 00:36:05.190
to go on the way
they were before?

00:36:05.190 --> 00:36:09.110
And that just ain't
going to work, guys.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:13.030
That's what the
steam industry said.

00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:14.592
So I think that's
the challenge--

00:36:14.592 --> 00:36:15.550
make this your friend.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:17.300
One of the things
that's my responsibility

00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.991
to do at "The
Economist" is use this.

00:36:19.991 --> 00:36:23.372
And we see social sharing of
our content as an extremely

00:36:23.372 --> 00:36:25.810
valuable way to reach the
people out there who we think

00:36:25.810 --> 00:36:27.726
ought to be "Economist"
subscribers but aren't

00:36:27.726 --> 00:36:30.035
because they think all we
do is write about economics.

00:36:30.035 --> 00:36:31.780
And our biggest
challenge is actually

00:36:31.780 --> 00:36:34.180
overcoming that preconception
that people have.

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:36.160
And when we help people
over that, and they go,

00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.743
oh, wow, this is
actually pretty cool,

00:36:37.743 --> 00:36:39.820
then we can pick up
more subscribers.

00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.820
So for us, social is an
amazingly powerful way

00:36:41.820 --> 00:36:43.570
of reaching out to
those people, not least

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:45.778
because the people who like
reading our stuff already

00:36:45.778 --> 00:36:47.237
love to share it
with their friends

00:36:47.237 --> 00:36:48.778
because they can
go, hey, look at me,

00:36:48.778 --> 00:36:50.252
I'm reading "The Economist."

00:36:50.252 --> 00:36:52.722
So it's a bad plan that
works really nicely.

00:36:57.662 --> 00:37:00.626
AUDIENCE: I was going to probe
a little bit on your three

00:37:00.626 --> 00:37:02.108
points at the end there.

00:37:02.108 --> 00:37:05.566
It's the first time I've heard
the "Principia Mathematica"

00:37:05.566 --> 00:37:07.542
credited to a
coffeehouse, especially.

00:37:07.542 --> 00:37:09.024
So what's the equivalent?

00:37:09.024 --> 00:37:11.494
What's the "Principia
Mathematica" on Facebook?

00:37:11.494 --> 00:37:12.810
Let's just speculate.

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:15.060
TOM STANDAGE: I think Twitter
is probably more likely.

00:37:17.610 --> 00:37:20.354
The way that Twitter works
is very coffeehouse-like.

00:37:20.354 --> 00:37:22.834
So if I follow two people,
even if they're actually

00:37:22.834 --> 00:37:25.350
two celebrities I don't know,
and they tweet each other,

00:37:25.350 --> 00:37:27.010
I can see those
tweets in my timeline.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:29.397
And then I can hit Reply
and reply to both of them.

00:37:29.397 --> 00:37:30.772
And they may choose
to ignore me.

00:37:30.772 --> 00:37:31.640
But they may not.

00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.973
And this is kind of one of
the fun things about Twitter.

00:37:35.656 --> 00:37:37.335
If you do this at
a drinks party,

00:37:37.335 --> 00:37:38.710
people might think
it's annoying,

00:37:38.710 --> 00:37:39.870
that you're eavesdropping
and then butting in.

00:37:39.870 --> 00:37:42.264
But in coffeehouses, it
was actually encouraged.

00:37:42.264 --> 00:37:43.680
This is what you
were meant to do.

00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:44.812
People had to be polite.

00:37:44.812 --> 00:37:46.270
And if someone
stuck their nose in,

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:47.815
you couldn't just
say, oh, go away.

00:37:47.815 --> 00:37:48.940
You had to be nice to them.

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:52.415
So there's some quite
interesting stuff.

00:37:52.415 --> 00:37:53.790
There was a project,
for example,

00:37:53.790 --> 00:37:58.155
to build a computational
model of the C. elegans work.

00:37:58.155 --> 00:37:59.542
And it started with a tweet.

00:37:59.542 --> 00:38:01.750
So there were bunches of
scientists talking about it.

00:38:01.750 --> 00:38:04.195
And one of them said, oh,
why don't we just do this?

00:38:04.195 --> 00:38:06.570
And so they started doing it.

00:38:06.570 --> 00:38:08.470
We're right at the
beginning of this process.

00:38:08.470 --> 00:38:10.636
But that's the kind of thing
that's going to happen,

00:38:10.636 --> 00:38:12.310
that people are
going to encounter

00:38:12.310 --> 00:38:17.387
ideas and people and potential
projects in public on Twitter.

00:38:17.387 --> 00:38:19.345
And some of those are
actually going to happen.

00:38:19.345 --> 00:38:21.149
If I go back to "Principia
Mathematica," what actually

00:38:21.149 --> 00:38:23.540
happened there was that there
was a series of discussions

00:38:23.540 --> 00:38:25.480
called coffeehouse
discussions that took place

00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:30.330
in the evenings of
January 1660 something.

00:38:30.330 --> 00:38:31.962
And it was Hooke,
Halley, and Wren.

00:38:31.962 --> 00:38:34.170
And they were arguing about
whether an inverse square

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:38.082
of the law of gravity implicitly
gave you elliptical orbits.

00:38:38.082 --> 00:38:40.038
And we now know that it does.

00:38:40.038 --> 00:38:41.961
But they no one had a proof.

00:38:41.961 --> 00:38:43.461
And Hooke, in typical
Hooke fashion,

00:38:43.461 --> 00:38:45.906
said, well, I did have a
proof, but I can't find it.

00:38:45.906 --> 00:38:47.862
And to be honest,
the thing about Hooke

00:38:47.862 --> 00:38:50.350
is that he claimed to have
invented everything first.

00:38:50.350 --> 00:38:51.867
But very often, he really had.

00:38:51.867 --> 00:38:53.450
But in this case,
he couldn't find it.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:57.850
And Halley was also
involved in this.

00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:01.650
And I think Halley offered Hooke
and Wren a very expensive book

00:39:01.650 --> 00:39:03.217
if either of them
could prove this.

00:39:03.217 --> 00:39:04.300
And neither of them could.

00:39:04.300 --> 00:39:06.800
And then Halley went and saw
Newton and mentioned it to him.

00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:09.300
And Newton said, oh, yeah,
yeah, inverse square of law

00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:10.250
of two ellipses.

00:39:10.250 --> 00:39:11.130
Yeah, yeah, totally,
I've got that.

00:39:11.130 --> 00:39:12.350
I'll send you it next week.

00:39:12.350 --> 00:39:16.171
So Newton starts writing
it out to send to Halley.

00:39:16.171 --> 00:39:18.087
And then he gets a bit
carried away and writes

00:39:18.087 --> 00:39:19.614
the whole "Principia
Mathematica."

00:39:19.614 --> 00:39:21.780
So that was how it happened,
that they were prepared

00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:23.447
to sort of dare each
other to do things.

00:39:23.447 --> 00:39:24.946
And you wouldn't
necessarily do that

00:39:24.946 --> 00:39:26.555
on the floor of
the Royal Society

00:39:26.555 --> 00:39:28.391
or in the pages of a
scientific journal.

00:39:28.391 --> 00:39:30.339
But you would do it
in a coffeehouse.

00:39:33.261 --> 00:39:35.700
AUDIENCE: I had a
question about, like,

00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.650
what about other ancient
civilizations that

00:39:37.650 --> 00:39:39.400
had postal systems?

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:41.851
Why didn't they develop
the same way as the Romans?

00:39:41.851 --> 00:39:43.392
TOM STANDAGE: Well,
I should say they

00:39:43.392 --> 00:39:44.558
may have done in some cases.

00:39:44.558 --> 00:39:46.710
So I have limited my
scope here to the West

00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:48.340
because I didn't
feel like I could

00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:51.970
see into the literature of
other cultures and civilizations

00:39:51.970 --> 00:39:52.480
properly.

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:54.730
And so I didn't want to kind
of generalize about them.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.700
But I have found a few examples.

00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.700
The interesting ones are
from China and Japan.

00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.472
So China, there do seem to
have been kind of social media

00:40:02.472 --> 00:40:04.680
systems, but they seemed to
be terribly hierarchical.

00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.980
So what happened was that the
local governors would gather.

00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.146
They would do things like
listen to the songs people

00:40:09.146 --> 00:40:12.368
were singing, a bit like sort of
sentiment analysis on Twitter.

00:40:12.368 --> 00:40:14.576
And they would write these
down and then send them up

00:40:14.576 --> 00:40:16.035
to the regional governors,
and they would send them up.

00:40:16.035 --> 00:40:18.118
So there was this sort of
very hierarchical system

00:40:18.118 --> 00:40:18.835
going on there.

00:40:18.835 --> 00:40:20.900
But the thing is
that may just be me

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:23.385
imposing that sort of frame
on the way we think of China

00:40:23.385 --> 00:40:26.040
as always being very
top-down hierarchical.

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:29.035
The thing that's clearly more
social is the Japanese example.

00:40:29.035 --> 00:40:32.150
There are a couple of cases
in the 10th and 11th century

00:40:32.150 --> 00:40:34.510
of traditions of social poetry.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:38.220
And one of them is the sort of
batting backwards and forwards,

00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.242
being expected to write poems
at the drop of a hat in poetry

00:40:41.242 --> 00:40:43.280
writing competitions.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.011
And the most famous ones
would be sort of passed around

00:40:46.011 --> 00:40:46.760
and become famous.

00:40:46.760 --> 00:40:48.965
And people would write them
in their commonplace books.

00:40:48.965 --> 00:40:51.140
And in fact, "The Pillow Book,"
which is, in effect, a diary

00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:53.270
commonplace book, has
a very nice line in it

00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:56.710
where it's about how lovely
it is when one of your poems

00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:58.670
goes viral in the court.

00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.334
And poor old Sie Shonagon is
saying that this has never

00:41:01.334 --> 00:41:03.250
happened to her, but it
must be really awesome

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:04.630
when it happens to you.

00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:09.084
And there was also a
custom from social poetry

00:41:09.084 --> 00:41:10.750
where people would
write a line or verse

00:41:10.750 --> 00:41:12.514
and pass it on to
the next person.

00:41:12.514 --> 00:41:15.100
And so it was sort of a
collaborative poetry-writing

00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.220
exercise.

00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:19.415
And again, that looks quite
similar to some of the things

00:41:19.415 --> 00:41:20.047
we have today.

00:41:20.047 --> 00:41:21.463
And what I'm hoping
will happen is

00:41:21.463 --> 00:41:23.671
the publication of this book
will flush out some more

00:41:23.671 --> 00:41:25.927
non-European
examples, and I'll be

00:41:25.927 --> 00:41:28.556
able to add them to
a future edition.

00:41:28.556 --> 00:41:31.900
So let me know if you have any.

00:41:31.900 --> 00:41:34.339
AUDIENCE: So you
describe the entire range

00:41:34.339 --> 00:41:36.311
of those 2,000 years
between the Romans

00:41:36.311 --> 00:41:38.125
and the coffeehouses
as kind of one block.

00:41:38.125 --> 00:41:39.500
But it seems like
the Middle Ages

00:41:39.500 --> 00:41:42.086
would be kind of an
exception where you really

00:41:42.086 --> 00:41:45.700
did have a hierarchical
transfer of information

00:41:45.700 --> 00:41:46.760
along the feudal lines.

00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:50.915
Would that be kind
of more comparable

00:41:50.915 --> 00:41:52.749
to what we saw in "old" media?

00:41:52.749 --> 00:41:55.040
TOM STANDAGE: Yeah, you do
have sort of quasi-broadcast

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.890
there because the king can
say to his barons, say this.

00:41:58.890 --> 00:42:00.557
And then they would
sort of once a month

00:42:00.557 --> 00:42:02.556
have courts where they'd
read out proclamations.

00:42:02.556 --> 00:42:04.420
And then you also
have pseudo-broadcast

00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.500
from the Catholic Church
because the Pope could

00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:08.800
say to all of the bishops,
tell the priests to say

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:10.466
that Martin Luther
is really, really bad

00:42:10.466 --> 00:42:11.560
and no one should believe him.

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:13.175
And so they would get up
in the pulpit and say,

00:42:13.175 --> 00:42:14.675
Martin Luther is
really, really bad,

00:42:14.675 --> 00:42:16.270
and no one should believe him.

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:18.930
But it didn't have
the same kind of power

00:42:18.930 --> 00:42:21.544
to reach large numbers
of people simultaneously.

00:42:21.544 --> 00:42:22.840
It wasn't that quick.

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.880
It wasn't that reliable.

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.710
So it doesn't have
the subsequent power

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:29.817
of a radio in your
room saying, this

00:42:29.817 --> 00:42:32.715
is what you should
believe, whatever.

00:42:32.715 --> 00:42:34.583
So, yeah, you can
sort of liken--

00:42:34.583 --> 00:42:38.524
AUDIENCE: You said "new" media
versus "really old" media,

00:42:38.524 --> 00:42:41.117
the "new" media has more power
than the "really old" media.

00:42:41.117 --> 00:42:41.950
TOM STANDAGE: Right.

00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:42.120
Exactly.

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:43.703
So a more nuanced
version of my thesis

00:42:43.703 --> 00:42:45.339
would be, instead
of being all social,

00:42:45.339 --> 00:42:47.630
all broadcast, or all social--
which isn't true anyway,

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:49.630
because I think we've got
an awesome hybrid now.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:52.570
But essentially you've got a
social trumps broadcast period.

00:42:52.570 --> 00:42:54.775
Then you've got a broadcast
trumps social period.

00:42:54.775 --> 00:42:57.754
And then you got a
social fights back

00:42:57.754 --> 00:42:59.530
period, which we're in now.

00:42:59.530 --> 00:43:02.436
And so, yes, it's not
completely black and white.

00:43:02.436 --> 00:43:06.010
The first order of approximation
is the black-and-white version.

00:43:06.010 --> 00:43:07.350
AUDIENCE: When do we flip back?

00:43:07.350 --> 00:43:09.830
What forces us back?

00:43:09.830 --> 00:43:14.145
What forces broadcast kind
of back onto our society?

00:43:14.145 --> 00:43:16.017
And how long do we have?

00:43:16.017 --> 00:43:18.100
TOM STANDAGE: Well, I
think, actually, some people

00:43:18.100 --> 00:43:20.433
say that there are aspects
of social that are broadcast.

00:43:20.433 --> 00:43:22.900
So the way Lady Gaga uses
Twitter is actually broadcast,

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:23.880
not social.

00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:26.195
So again, I think what
we've we're really

00:43:26.195 --> 00:43:27.934
talking about now is a hybrid.

00:43:27.934 --> 00:43:31.940
And the challenge
for us as a society

00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:34.460
and for us as companies and
individuals and consumers

00:43:34.460 --> 00:43:37.070
is to sort of get the best
of both of those aspects.

00:43:37.070 --> 00:43:40.565
We want the video frames
of the football game

00:43:40.565 --> 00:43:43.280
to arrive in a timely
and in-order fashion.

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:47.244
And distributed systems
are not necessarily

00:43:47.244 --> 00:43:48.542
as good at doing that.

00:43:48.542 --> 00:43:50.000
If you look at
Usenet, for example,

00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:54.600
which was a distributed,
open-standards-based

00:43:54.600 --> 00:43:56.832
social media system, you
could check in twice a day,

00:43:56.832 --> 00:43:59.040
but you really couldn't hold
a real-time conversation

00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.510
like you can on Twitter.

00:44:00.510 --> 00:44:02.200
I would be very
interested to see

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.626
whether we see the rise of
open-standards-based social

00:44:05.626 --> 00:44:08.096
media and social
networking platforms.

00:44:08.096 --> 00:44:10.660
Because, to be
honest, the dominance

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:12.513
of Facebook and Twitter
in that field does

00:44:12.513 --> 00:44:13.415
look like an anomaly.

00:44:13.415 --> 00:44:16.540
It looks like CompuServe and
AOL before the web showed up.

00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:19.180
But it may be that there is
such enormous technologies

00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:23.980
to centralizing it that they
would be hard to overthrow.

00:44:23.980 --> 00:44:25.605
But that was why I
thought [INAUDIBLE].

00:44:29.385 --> 00:44:32.355
AUDIENCE: So you've mentioned
Twitter, Tumblr, Pinterest,

00:44:32.355 --> 00:44:33.345
Blogger a lot.

00:44:33.345 --> 00:44:35.325
You haven't really talked
much about Facebook.

00:44:35.325 --> 00:44:38.955
So I'm curious, what is it
about Facebook that makes it

00:44:38.955 --> 00:44:40.705
less like some of these
historical things?

00:44:40.705 --> 00:44:41.996
And why is it less interesting?

00:44:41.996 --> 00:44:43.260
TOM STANDAGE: No, that's true.

00:44:43.260 --> 00:44:43.610
A couple of reasons.

00:44:43.610 --> 00:44:44.965
I mean, Facebook does appear.

00:44:44.965 --> 00:44:47.940
And there are some things
that are Facebook-ish.

00:44:47.940 --> 00:44:51.720
But I think it's chiefly that
Facebook, although they keep

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:54.705
taking down any
constraints, any privacy,

00:44:54.705 --> 00:44:58.518
any sort of limiting
this to certain people,

00:44:58.518 --> 00:45:01.265
essentially the default is
still not that everything on it

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:02.820
is public.

00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.540
So the closest
analogy to Facebook

00:45:04.540 --> 00:45:07.820
are actually where you
have social media exchanges

00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:09.596
between closed groups of people.

00:45:09.596 --> 00:45:11.512
And the one example in
the book is the members

00:45:11.512 --> 00:45:13.130
of the court around Anne Boleyn.

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:15.914
And they had this book called
"The Devonshire Manuscript."

00:45:15.914 --> 00:45:17.414
And it was a shared
commonplace book

00:45:17.414 --> 00:45:18.850
where they all wrote poems in.

00:45:18.850 --> 00:45:20.430
And they would
rewrite them, too.

00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:21.740
They might take a poem
someone else had written

00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:23.599
and rewrite it to reflect
their own circumstance.

00:45:23.599 --> 00:45:24.505
And they were flirting
with each other,

00:45:24.505 --> 00:45:26.770
and dropping hints
about what was going on,

00:45:26.770 --> 00:45:29.139
and writing comments
in the columns.

00:45:29.139 --> 00:45:30.888
And it's all quite
hard to figure out now,

00:45:30.888 --> 00:45:35.855
like my daughter's Tumblr
would be to a future historian.

00:45:35.855 --> 00:45:37.980
So that's one example
because it's a closed system.

00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:40.470
And there's another
one in the Roman world

00:45:40.470 --> 00:45:43.352
where members of
a shared apartment

00:45:43.352 --> 00:45:45.518
block, they have this
literally writing on the wall.

00:45:45.518 --> 00:45:47.430
They're writing poetry
and witty remarks

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:49.340
on the wall of an
apartment block

00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:50.652
that has some shared space.

00:45:50.652 --> 00:45:52.596
And they tried to
outdo each other.

00:45:52.596 --> 00:45:56.570
And it reads very much like
a Facebook comment thread.

00:45:56.570 --> 00:45:58.560
I'm personally most
drawn to Twitter

00:45:58.560 --> 00:45:59.550
because it mostly spoke
to me as a journalist.

00:45:59.550 --> 00:46:01.020
But also I just
like the simplicity

00:46:01.020 --> 00:46:03.123
of the basically
everything is public model,

00:46:03.123 --> 00:46:04.373
and there's no mucking around.

00:46:04.373 --> 00:46:07.640
And I can't be bothered
with the Facebook.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.030
This is going to go to
friends and networks,

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:12.294
because even if you
figure out how to use it,

00:46:12.294 --> 00:46:13.460
they'll change it next week.

00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:16.109
And with Google+, I just
make everything public

00:46:16.109 --> 00:46:18.650
because, again, I can't really
be bothered to play that game.

00:46:22.614 --> 00:46:25.030
There are fewer examples of
those sort of selective closed

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:27.958
group things in
the internet world.

00:46:27.958 --> 00:46:32.826
So that makes Facebook
less exciting to me.

00:46:32.826 --> 00:46:33.326
All right.

00:46:33.326 --> 00:46:34.302
I think I have one more here.

00:46:34.302 --> 00:46:35.927
And then it's going
to be time to stop.

00:46:35.927 --> 00:46:40.252
AUDIENCE: You hinted towards
the tension in the sense

00:46:40.252 --> 00:46:44.340
that centralization was
the key broadcast feature.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:48.435
But it hasn't yet gone away
from any of the dominant--

00:46:48.435 --> 00:46:50.384
so, I mean, Facebook
does get to the--

00:46:50.384 --> 00:46:51.300
TOM STANDAGE: It does.

00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:51.925
It really does.

00:46:51.925 --> 00:46:54.294
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:46:54.294 --> 00:47:00.282
AUDIENCE: And I guess
just an invitation

00:47:00.282 --> 00:47:03.775
to reflect a little bit
more on that in terms of

00:47:03.775 --> 00:47:08.380
are there historical--
there wasn't a single place

00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.129
where you could flip the switch
and turn off all the printing

00:47:11.129 --> 00:47:11.628
presses.

00:47:11.628 --> 00:47:12.560
TOM STANDAGE: No, there weren't.

00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:15.350
So I think printing presses
are a lot more like setting up

00:47:15.350 --> 00:47:16.800
your own web server.

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:19.320
If you don't want to use
WordPress or someone else's

00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:21.770
Blogger or whatever, you
can set up your own server

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:23.175
and plug it into the
internet and it'll work.

00:47:23.175 --> 00:47:24.383
And it's the same with email.

00:47:24.383 --> 00:47:26.404
If you don't want to
use Gmail or whoever,

00:47:26.404 --> 00:47:27.750
then you can set up your own
mail server and plug it in

00:47:27.750 --> 00:47:28.730
and it'll work.

00:47:28.730 --> 00:47:29.976
And I think it is an anomaly.

00:47:29.976 --> 00:47:31.517
This is where the
book actually ends.

00:47:31.517 --> 00:47:33.477
I say, it looks
pretty weird that we

00:47:33.477 --> 00:47:35.310
treat Facebook and
Twitter as though they're

00:47:35.310 --> 00:47:37.390
public spaces and
public spheres.

00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:38.201
And they're not.

00:47:38.201 --> 00:47:38.692
They're privately owned.

00:47:38.692 --> 00:47:40.656
They're much more like
malls than marketplaces.

00:47:40.656 --> 00:47:42.460
If they don't like you,
they can shut you out.

00:47:42.460 --> 00:47:42.960
And they do.

00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:45.600
And they seem to do this in
sometimes a rather capricious

00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.810
way.

00:47:46.810 --> 00:47:50.550
So I think the historical
analogy on a much shorter scale

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:53.718
is the AOL/CompuServe one,
where it looked impregnable

00:47:53.718 --> 00:47:56.630
in whatever it was-- 1993-- and
the internet was everywhere,

00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:59.582
and they were who you
went to get to it.

00:47:59.582 --> 00:48:02.440
And the open web back
then was really crap.

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.020
You couldn't do web-based chat.

00:48:05.020 --> 00:48:07.874
There's a whole bunch of
stuff it just couldn't do.

00:48:07.874 --> 00:48:10.600
And some people said, oh, in
the long run, it'll get better.

00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.730
Of course, it did.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:13.229
But it really did
take quite a while

00:48:13.229 --> 00:48:15.717
before things that were quite
easy to do in CompuServe

00:48:15.717 --> 00:48:17.008
now became possible on the web.

00:48:17.008 --> 00:48:18.216
It took about 10 years.

00:48:18.216 --> 00:48:20.340
So one of the things I'm
particularly interested in

00:48:20.340 --> 00:48:23.018
is these various
efforts-- tent.io

00:48:23.018 --> 00:48:24.517
is the most recent
one I thought was

00:48:24.517 --> 00:48:25.994
quite interesting--
but basically,

00:48:25.994 --> 00:48:28.574
these various efforts
to do open standards

00:48:28.574 --> 00:48:31.834
based social networking
and social media exchange.

00:48:31.834 --> 00:48:34.042
And I think the most likely
nucleation point for this

00:48:34.042 --> 00:48:36.130
is actually someone
like Dropbox.

00:48:36.130 --> 00:48:38.590
So what would happen if-- or
you could do it with iCloud

00:48:38.590 --> 00:48:41.492
or you could do it
with Google Drive.

00:48:41.492 --> 00:48:43.700
But essentially you would
have a repository of stuff.

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:46.267
And you would specify--
and initially would just

00:48:46.267 --> 00:48:47.350
work a bit like HootSuite.

00:48:47.350 --> 00:48:48.140
So you've got cool stuff in it.

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:49.883
And you'd say, and send this to
Facebook, send this to Twitter,

00:48:49.883 --> 00:48:51.008
and send this to Instagram.

00:48:51.008 --> 00:48:53.811
And it would just
do it all for you.

00:48:53.811 --> 00:48:56.056
So it would just talk
to those open APIs.

00:48:56.056 --> 00:48:57.680
But of course, once
you got that going,

00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:59.902
you then have
something big enough

00:48:59.902 --> 00:49:01.530
that the individual
repositories could

00:49:01.530 --> 00:49:03.280
talk to each other
using an open standard.

00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:05.363
So if you were a big company
like Google or Apple,

00:49:05.363 --> 00:49:07.828
you could say, OK, we're going
to allow these repositories

00:49:07.828 --> 00:49:10.446
to talk openly to each other but
in an open-standards-based way.

00:49:10.446 --> 00:49:11.860
And then, when I get really
annoyed with Facebook

00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:13.523
and say, OK, I've
had it with Facebook,

00:49:13.523 --> 00:49:15.259
I'm shutting down
my Facebook account,

00:49:15.259 --> 00:49:17.550
so I break the link between
my repository and Facebook.

00:49:17.550 --> 00:49:19.140
And I delete all of my
stuff from Facebook.

00:49:19.140 --> 00:49:20.209
But I still got it all.

00:49:20.209 --> 00:49:21.542
It's all still in my repository.

00:49:21.542 --> 00:49:26.585
And then you've got the basis of
a thing that doesn't require--

00:49:26.585 --> 00:49:28.960
then you bootstrap it
using these other networks.

00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:31.024
You'd probably hate
it and block it.

00:49:31.024 --> 00:49:32.840
But that would be how you do it.

00:49:32.840 --> 00:49:34.570
It's kind of hard to see how
you get this going, though.

00:49:34.570 --> 00:49:36.230
On the one hand, the
existing social networks

00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:37.271
make it easier to switch.

00:49:37.271 --> 00:49:39.800
So if you look at what happened
with Friendster and MySpace,

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:42.059
in both cases, the
existence of those networks

00:49:42.059 --> 00:49:43.600
allowed the people
who were defecting

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.410
to tell their friends that
they were defecting far more

00:49:46.410 --> 00:49:46.910
efficiently.

00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:49.446
So you just post a
message on MySpace saying,

00:49:49.446 --> 00:49:50.670
I've had it with MySpace.

00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.840
I'm out of here.

00:49:50.840 --> 00:49:51.673
Meet me on Facebook.

00:49:51.673 --> 00:49:53.650
And then everyone
will look at Facebook.

00:49:53.650 --> 00:49:56.856
So on the one hand, you can
say it's very, very brittle.

00:49:56.856 --> 00:49:58.480
And if something like
this comes along,

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:00.104
I can just go onto
Twitter and Facebook

00:50:00.104 --> 00:50:02.160
and go, bye, find me over here.

00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:05.900
On the other hand, the reason
that Facebook and Twitter

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:10.266
are useful is that I already
have established networks

00:50:10.266 --> 00:50:11.222
on them.

00:50:11.222 --> 00:50:13.620
And if I can't transfer
those over, [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:16.940
So I can't decide which of
those forces is stronger.

00:50:16.940 --> 00:50:18.595
But I think the
most likely scenario

00:50:18.595 --> 00:50:23.690
is that we see an emerging
open standard like this

00:50:23.690 --> 00:50:24.650
that pops up.

00:50:24.650 --> 00:50:25.950
Some start-up does it.

00:50:25.950 --> 00:50:27.339
It becomes cool to use that.

00:50:27.339 --> 00:50:30.117
app.net isn't really very
cool, but never mind.

00:50:30.117 --> 00:50:31.510
So like app.net, only cool.

00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:33.280
And then that starts
to get some traction.

00:50:33.280 --> 00:50:36.000
And then if that is coupled with
a catastrophic privacy breach--

00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:38.550
let's say, Facebook--
then you might get people

00:50:38.550 --> 00:50:41.490
like my mum saying,
what do I do?

00:50:41.490 --> 00:50:44.210
Actually, saying my mum, my
mum's a pretty high bar there,

00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:47.150
but you might start to get
sort of a larger migration.

00:50:47.150 --> 00:50:49.570
So that's the kind
of thing I'm looking

00:50:49.570 --> 00:50:52.474
for in the next 10 to 15 years,
and I'm following very closely.

00:50:52.474 --> 00:50:55.550
And I think it's also something
I need to write a piece on.

00:50:55.550 --> 00:50:58.210
I think it's a genuinely
interesting computer science

00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:02.410
problem of how you do just
something like Twitter,

00:51:02.410 --> 00:51:06.950
where you do in order timely
status updates in an open way.

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:09.260
Is that actually possible?

00:51:09.260 --> 00:51:11.374
Where are the bottlenecks?

00:51:11.374 --> 00:51:13.870
How would you scale that?

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:15.875
There are lots of people
thinking about this.

00:51:15.875 --> 00:51:19.090
And I think that's a
genuinely big problem.

00:51:19.090 --> 00:51:20.290
And it looks insoluble.

00:51:20.290 --> 00:51:22.795
But then self-driving cars
looked insoluble 10 years ago.

00:51:22.795 --> 00:51:25.545
And then the next
year they were sold.

00:51:25.545 --> 00:51:28.825
So who knows?

00:51:28.825 --> 00:51:29.325
Great.

00:51:29.325 --> 00:51:29.780
PRESENTER: Thank you.

00:51:29.780 --> 00:51:31.613
TOM STANDAGE: Well,
thank you all very much.

00:51:31.613 --> 00:51:36.171
