this works is this funnel shape over

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650
this works is this funnel shape over
 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.440
this works is this funnel shape over
here is called an accelerator funnel and

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450
here is called an accelerator funnel and
 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.240
here is called an accelerator funnel and
what it does is it passes a large

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250
what it does is it passes a large
 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.710
what it does is it passes a large
quantity of water through a small area

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720
quantity of water through a small area
 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.910
quantity of water through a small area
and that causes the water to be moving

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920
and that causes the water to be moving
 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.230
and that causes the water to be moving
really fast it starts a current through

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240
really fast it starts a current through
 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.609
really fast it starts a current through
here so everything is being pushed

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619
here so everything is being pushed
 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.530
here so everything is being pushed
through this area up against these bars

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
through this area up against these bars
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.660

these bars like shrimp and small fish go

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710
these bars like shrimp and small fish go
 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.050
these bars like shrimp and small fish go
through the bars and on towards the back

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060
through the bars and on towards the back
 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.310
through the bars and on towards the back
of the net where they're caught in the

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
of the net where they're caught in the
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.289
of the net where they're caught in the
back anything larger than the spaces

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299
back anything larger than the spaces
 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.240

between these bars it was designed for

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
between these bars it was designed for
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.190
between these bars it was designed for
turtles but it also works for sharks and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200
turtles but it also works for sharks and
 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.749
turtles but it also works for sharks and
large fish because the current is

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
large fish because the current is
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.160
large fish because the current is
pushing on them and the bars are kind of

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170
pushing on them and the bars are kind of
 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.660
pushing on them and the bars are kind of
slanted it pushes them down towards this

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670
slanted it pushes them down towards this
 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.330
slanted it pushes them down towards this
opening here in the bottom this flap

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340
opening here in the bottom this flap
 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.340
opening here in the bottom this flap
right here will be held shut by the

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350
right here will be held shut by the
 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.630
right here will be held shut by the
water pressure but as soon as anything

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640
water pressure but as soon as anything
 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.550
water pressure but as soon as anything
gets down inside there it opens it up in

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560
gets down inside there it opens it up in
 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.050
gets down inside there it opens it up in
the turtle can escape and go up to the

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060
the turtle can escape and go up to the
 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.060
the turtle can escape and go up to the
top to breathe and then the flap will

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070
top to breathe and then the flap will
 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.859
top to breathe and then the flap will
close behind them in the past

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
close behind them in the past
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.899
close behind them in the past
turtles were often caught in a variety

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909
turtles were often caught in a variety
 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.480
turtles were often caught in a variety
of fishing nets and while the problem

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
of fishing nets and while the problem
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.810
of fishing nets and while the problem
still exists today u.s. shrimp fishermen

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
still exists today u.s. shrimp fishermen

are now required by law to use the new

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369
are now required by law to use the new
 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.999
are now required by law to use the new
device some fishermen who used the

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009
device some fishermen who used the
 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.249
device some fishermen who used the
device complain that having holes in

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259
device complain that having holes in
 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.230
device complain that having holes in
their nets can cause them to lose a

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240
their nets can cause them to lose a
 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.499
their nets can cause them to lose a
significant percentage of their catch

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509
significant percentage of their catch
 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:11.450
significant percentage of their catch
but biologists say the new nets

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460
but biologists say the new nets
 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.670
but biologists say the new nets
can also work in the fisherman's phaser

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680
can also work in the fisherman's phaser
 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.980
can also work in the fisherman's phaser
they generally would catch more shrimp

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990
they generally would catch more shrimp
 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.150
they generally would catch more shrimp
throughout the season because this

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160
throughout the season because this
 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.620
throughout the season because this
doesn't just exclude the occasional

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630
doesn't just exclude the occasional
 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.420
doesn't just exclude the occasional
turtle it excludes anything large in the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430
turtle it excludes anything large in the
 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.070
turtle it excludes anything large in the
back of their necks so they can pull

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080
back of their necks so they can pull
 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.330
back of their necks so they can pull
their nets for a lot longer before they

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340
their nets for a lot longer before they
 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.800
their nets for a lot longer before they
fill up and they get a higher percentage

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810
fill up and they get a higher percentage
 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.360
fill up and they get a higher percentage
of actual shrimp that they can keep each

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370
of actual shrimp that they can keep each
 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.060

also developed other research efforts

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970
also developed other research efforts
 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.390
also developed other research efforts
that have boosted the ridley population

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400
that have boosted the ridley population
