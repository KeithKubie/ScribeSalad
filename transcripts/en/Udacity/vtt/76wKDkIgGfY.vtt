Welcome back.

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:04.370
In lesson one,
we made single screen apps, but

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.040
most apps have more than
one screen of information.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.850
In this lesson, we're going to focus
on view presentation and segways.

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.560
What are our options in iOS for

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.420
presenting a UI with
multiple pages of content?

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.580
How do new pages of content
make their way onto the screen?

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.790
We're going to talk about two
stock ways that Apple provides.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:24.460
The first is through implementing
a navigation structure

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.420
as exemplified here in the messages app.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.660
Notice that when I click on
a specific message stream,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.510
the message details slides
in from right to left.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.840
If I want to return to the previous
view, the main messages table in this

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.160
case, I can use the Back
button in the top left corner.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.500
That Back button is always
there in iOS navigation.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.090
A second way to bring a view onto
the screen is modal presentation,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.530
like you see here when I press
the Compose button in Messages.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.020
Modally presented views slide up
from the bottom of the screen.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.330
Modal presentation is often used for
Alert views.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.580
If I click on the camera for
a photo attachment,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.650
an alert modal slides onto the screen,
giving me photo attachment options.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.060
You can see that this alert view
also slides up from the bottom.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.210
You'll be using a modally presented
image picker like this one

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.509
when you build MiMi
