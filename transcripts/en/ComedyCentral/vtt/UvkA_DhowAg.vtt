00:00:01.735 --> 00:00:05.873
MMM!
THAT'S GOT A GOOD TASTE.

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:08.842
THAT'S--THAT'S A LOT
TO DO A SHOT.

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:12.012
- YOU'RE INSANE!
WHOO!

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.413
- YEAH, WE SHOULD'VE
JUST SIPPED THAT.

00:00:13.447 --> 00:00:15.382
- WHOO!

00:00:15.415 --> 00:00:18.385
- READY?
- OKAY, BUDDY.

00:00:18.418 --> 00:00:21.288
ELVIS WRITES A LETTER TO NIXON
WHILE ON THE PLANE.

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:24.191
THEY LAND, AND HE DROPS IT OFF
AT THE FRONT OF THE WHITE HOUSE.

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:25.726
IT WAS SHOCKING.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.595
NO CELEBRITIES WANT
TO HANG OUT WITH NIXON.

00:00:28.629 --> 00:00:30.297
SO WHEN HE REACHED OUT,
THEY'RE LIKE,

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.598
ELVIS WANTS TO MEET WITH YOU.

00:00:31.632 --> 00:00:33.200
THIS CAN'T HURT MATTERS.

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.235
DON'T YOU WANNA SEE
WHAT ELVIS HAS TO SAY?

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:36.937
WHY NOT?

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.139
HE'S LIKE, YEAH, ARRANGE IT.
YEAH, I WANNA MEET HIM.

00:00:39.173 --> 00:00:40.741
LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.043
AND ELVIS COMES IN.

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:45.445
AND NIXON LOOKS AT HIM
LIKE, UH,

00:00:45.479 --> 00:00:48.815
THIS IS CRAZY, MAN.
YOU DRESS REALLY CRAZY, MAN.

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:50.150
HE'S LIKE, HEY,
YOU HAVE YOUR GET-UP,

00:00:50.184 --> 00:00:51.818
I HAVE MINE, OKAY?

00:00:51.852 --> 00:00:54.221
NIXON'S LIKE,
YEAH, I'M GLAD YOU CAME BY.

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.757
I WANTED TO MEET YOU,
AND GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.325
AND ELVIS DOES
THE HARD SELL THING.

00:00:58.358 --> 00:00:59.893
HE NEEDS THE BADGE.

00:00:59.927 --> 00:01:01.495
WELL, I CARE, MAN.

00:01:01.528 --> 00:01:02.896
I CARE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THESE PEOPLE.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.565
AND I CARE ABOUT THE HIPPIES,

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:06.800
AND EVERYTHING THAT'S
BEING SAID RIGHT NOW, MAN.

00:01:06.834 --> 00:01:08.135
IT'S TERRIFYING.

00:01:08.168 --> 00:01:10.137
PEOPLE THAT ARE SAYING
THINGS ABOUT YOU

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.140
AND, UH, THE PEOPLE
THAT ARE SAYING THINGS ABOUT ME.

00:01:13.173 --> 00:01:15.976
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HAPPY
TO BE HERE...MAN.

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:18.512
BUT I NEED THIS BADGE.
THIS IS SO BIG FOR ME.

00:01:18.545 --> 00:01:20.147
I NEED IT.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.849
AND NIXON REALLY TAKES IT IN,
KINDA ASKS HIS AIDE.

00:01:21.882 --> 00:01:23.684
HE'S LIKE, CAN WE DO THIS?

00:01:23.717 --> 00:01:25.419
AND THE AIDE COMES BACK, SAYS,
I'M SORRY, IT'S DONE.

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.788
WE CANNOT GIVE THIS BADGE.
SORRY, MR. PRESLEY, WE CANNOT--

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:31.959
YOU HAVE NO QUALIFICATIONS
IN OUR MIND TO HAVE THIS BADGE.

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:33.293
[burps]

00:01:33.327 --> 00:01:35.162
MM.
SORRY, BROTHER.

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:36.930
I'M LOVIN' IT.

00:01:36.964 --> 00:01:39.132
AND NIXON DECIDES
TO GIVE HIM THIS BADGE.

00:01:39.166 --> 00:01:41.134
SO ELVIS GOES BACK
TO GET PHOTOS TAKEN,

00:01:41.168 --> 00:01:43.437
BUT THEN ELVIS IS

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.707
A LICENSED AND REGISTERED
FEDERAL NARCOTICS AGENT.
