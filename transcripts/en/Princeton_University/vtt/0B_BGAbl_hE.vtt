00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:19.520
BRIYANA DAVIS: We have lots
of sheets of paper.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.290
We told them to think about
stuff that they're thinking

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:23.590
about, stuff they want
to know more about.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.370
And so they all wrote it down
on pieces of paper and put

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:26.720
them up all around the room.


00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.830
And then everyone got
super fun stickers.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.340 position:58%
And we'd like...anything that
you had a story related to, you would

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.320
put sticker on that sign.


00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.930
NAIMAH HAKIM: This course is about
bringing together two

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.970
teams, the university team and
the youth ensemble, which is a

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.170
conglomeration of students from
various middle schools

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.690
and high schools.


00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.500
TADESH INAGAKI: We're meeting up,
once a week, with a group of

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.380
awesome kids, from the Princeton
area, and working

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.760
with them to create a devised
theater piece.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.330 position:61%
SARAH PATON: The class has been amazing
we have a group of young people,

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.800
ages, like middle school age.


00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.940
And they get to come
here every Friday.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.080
And we are devising
a piece with them.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.740
ERICA NAGEL: I'm Erica Nagel.


00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.820
And I'm the Artistic Engagement
Manager at McCarter

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.760
Theatre Center.


00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.530
And I also teach for the Lewis
Center at Princeton.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.650
When we started the project, we
didn't know what the play

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.610
was going to be about.


00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.020
We just knew we had a bunch
of enthusiastic people.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.390
And together we came to
the topic of dreams.

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.540
ALLISA WAGNER: It seemed like a
perfect blend of theater and a

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.510
service initiative.


00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.390
ERICA NAGEL: So our partner for
this course is Community

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.380
House, which is an on-campus
organization that runs after

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.750
school programs.


00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.790
And a lot of Princeton students
tutor for them.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.070
And we are their Fun Friday
activity for this semester.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.750
So we have some kids from
Community House.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.620
We also have some kids
just from the

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.610
broader Princeton community.


00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:54.710
MAEVE BRADY: I think one of the
most exciting thing is while

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.150
they can be shy and a little
tentative in this new

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.880
environment, once they're really
comfortable, is how

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.960
uninhibited they can be and how
much fun they can have.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.100 position:56%
MIRIAM HOLMES: I hope that the youth
ensemble members feel

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.520
proud when they see their work
on stage but also feel proud

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.490
that they worked together to
make that happen and not just

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.960
by themselves.


00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.290
MAYA: I'm having fun.


00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.110
It's a great way to interact
with people at different ages.

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.920
And we're doing all these
different things,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.770
improvisation, tableaux.


00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.020
It's really fun.


00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:38.820 position:97%
 


00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.330
NAIMAH HAKIM: I think one of the
best things about this course

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:48.640
is it's shown me how you don't
need some kind of Einstein,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.660
aha moment to be able
to create a play.

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.830
It can just be a series of
little moments, working with

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.870
people that you know, working
with teachers.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.750
And building upon those
moments can

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.000
create something awesome.
