00:00:05.999 --> 00:00:08.416
(soft music)

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:12.670
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.003
Bipedal, naked, large brain,

00:00:16.857 --> 00:00:20.607
long the master of fire,
tools, and language,

00:00:21.992 --> 00:00:26.133
but still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.716
Aware that death is inevitable,

00:00:29.554 --> 00:00:31.637
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:35.196
We grow up slowly.

00:00:35.196 --> 00:00:37.516
We hand down knowledge.

00:00:37.516 --> 00:00:39.599
We empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.288 --> 00:00:42.739
We shape the future from our shared

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:44.906
understanding of the past.

00:00:46.663 --> 00:00:50.005
Carta brings together experts
from diverse disciplines

00:00:50.005 --> 00:00:53.091
to exchange insights on who we are

00:00:53.091 --> 00:00:54.758
and how we got here.

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:58.965
An exploration made
possible by the generosity

00:00:58.965 --> 00:01:00.548
of humans like you.

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:25.082
(soft jingle)

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.487
(soft music)

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:43.783
- Okay, well it's a
great honor to be here,

00:01:43.783 --> 00:01:45.397
and I thank the organizers, Nick and Ajit,

00:01:45.397 --> 00:01:49.963
for inviting me and also
all of you for coming.

00:01:49.963 --> 00:01:52.176
So, I would like to start
by showing you a video clip

00:01:52.176 --> 00:01:54.805
of something that we filmed last summer

00:01:54.805 --> 00:01:58.343
in Gorongosa National Park in Mozambique.

00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:01.465
So, Gorongosa is an amazing
bi-diversity hotspot,

00:02:01.465 --> 00:02:03.616
and we have here what looks like a fairly

00:02:03.616 --> 00:02:05.630
kind of peaceful scene.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.957
So we have a troop of
baboons resting and feeding.

00:02:07.957 --> 00:02:10.296
We've got some warthogs walking around.

00:02:10.296 --> 00:02:12.910
We've got some waterbuck
grazing and so on.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.274
So it's all quite idyllic.

00:02:14.274 --> 00:02:17.548
But of course, nature's rarely idyllic.

00:02:17.548 --> 00:02:19.496
And if you look more
closely, you can see that

00:02:19.496 --> 00:02:21.401
this guy here in the middle is quite

00:02:21.401 --> 00:02:23.151
busy doing something.

00:02:24.408 --> 00:02:28.425
And then if we zoom in,
which we will in a second,

00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:30.592
we'll see that he has hunted and is now

00:02:30.592 --> 00:02:34.388
eating a young antelope, a reedbuck.

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:36.517
But unlike a lion with a killer bite,

00:02:36.517 --> 00:02:39.658
this baboon is eating the
antelope while it's still alive,

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:42.307
which you could argue is
not particularly sensible,

00:02:42.307 --> 00:02:43.883
given that it means that the antelope

00:02:43.883 --> 00:02:46.642
still has a chance to
escape, which as you'll see

00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:48.226
in a second, it's still very much

00:02:48.226 --> 00:02:50.476
trying to do at this point.

00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:56.752
So for us, I think this really is quite a,

00:02:56.752 --> 00:02:59.370
sort of gruesome scene,
but at the same time,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.488
it does raise some very
interesting questions

00:03:01.488 --> 00:03:03.074
that we can ask about
what might be going on

00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:04.955
in that baboon's head.

00:03:04.955 --> 00:03:06.293
And some of those
questions actually go back

00:03:06.293 --> 00:03:08.631
to what Nick was talking
about in his introduction.

00:03:08.631 --> 00:03:10.143
So for example, does this baboon know

00:03:10.143 --> 00:03:12.670
that the antelope is still alive?

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:14.262
Does the baboon know
that the fact that the

00:03:14.262 --> 00:03:17.392
antelope is moving is a
sign that it's still alive?

00:03:17.392 --> 00:03:20.056
Does the baboon know that
it can kill the antelope,

00:03:20.056 --> 00:03:22.767
and does it know what it needs
to do to kill the antelope

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:25.276
and that, once it has
killed it, the antelope

00:03:25.276 --> 00:03:27.300
will remain dead?

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.281
Does the baboon know that
it itself will die one day,

00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:32.487
and so will all other
baboons and all other

00:03:32.487 --> 00:03:34.396
antelopes and so on?

00:03:34.396 --> 00:03:37.328
And then finally, you might
have noticed in that video,

00:03:37.328 --> 00:03:40.355
the antelope's mother
standing to one side.

00:03:40.355 --> 00:03:42.905
So another question could be, I think,

00:03:42.905 --> 00:03:46.414
will the antelope's mother
grieve for her calf?

00:03:46.414 --> 00:03:48.133
So, I can't promise to be able to answer

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:50.320
most or even any of these questions,

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.752
but what I will try to do in this talk

00:03:53.752 --> 00:03:56.210
is to first survey what kinds of responses

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.521
have been recorded among non-human animals

00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:01.170
to dead individuals,
and what these responses

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.489
might tell us about the kind of underlying

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.399
death-related concepts in these animals.

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.431
And then at the end, I
will also briefly consider

00:04:10.431 --> 00:04:13.212
grief specifically, as
well as what implications

00:04:13.212 --> 00:04:15.063
a better understanding of these phenomena

00:04:15.063 --> 00:04:17.501
might have for animal welfare.

00:04:17.501 --> 00:04:19.907
So, on this graphical
summary, what I tried to do

00:04:19.907 --> 00:04:21.407
was to put together,

00:04:21.407 --> 00:04:25.348
to give you an idea, basically,
of the orders of mammals.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.337
So, the taxonomic orders of mammals,

00:04:27.337 --> 00:04:29.495
from which we have
published scientific reports

00:04:29.495 --> 00:04:31.328
on responses to death.

00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:34.107
And I think one of the
things that quickly pops out

00:04:34.107 --> 00:04:35.977
is that these reports cover quite a broad

00:04:35.977 --> 00:04:39.670
taxonomic spread, although
some of the orders

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:42.512
are represented by just
one or a few species.

00:04:42.512 --> 00:04:45.003
And that, of course, doesn't mean that

00:04:45.003 --> 00:04:48.167
mammals and other orders
don't respond to the dead.

00:04:48.167 --> 00:04:50.604
It's just that we don't
have, yet have good,

00:04:50.604 --> 00:04:53.606
kind of published reports on them.

00:04:53.606 --> 00:04:54.993
So, for example, we don't really know

00:04:54.993 --> 00:04:57.185
a great deal about how bats or aardvarks

00:04:57.185 --> 00:04:59.567
or kangaroos respond to the dead.

00:04:59.567 --> 00:05:01.150
Although, for at least
some of these kind of

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:03.975
missing pieces, we do have
some anecdotal evidence

00:05:03.975 --> 00:05:08.766
that that exists, just not
scientifically published yet.

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:10.319
So we'll come back to this figure later

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:12.021
when we look at what
specific ways there are

00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:15.095
of animal's responses
or animal's treatment

00:05:15.095 --> 00:05:16.773
of the dead.

00:05:16.773 --> 00:05:18.849
But first, what I want
to do now is to quickly

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:22.503
tell you about three
chimpanzee case reports

00:05:22.503 --> 00:05:25.178
that we observed at our
field research site,

00:05:25.178 --> 00:05:27.286
which was coordinated by Kyoto University,

00:05:27.286 --> 00:05:31.637
and which is located in
Bossou in Guinea, West Africa.

00:05:31.637 --> 00:05:33.496
And they're each kind of incredibly

00:05:33.496 --> 00:05:35.400
striking cases, I think.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.422
Things you see, you
know, once you see them,

00:05:37.422 --> 00:05:38.898
you don't easily forget them.

00:05:38.898 --> 00:05:41.317
All three cases involved
young individuals,

00:05:41.317 --> 00:05:44.622
young infants, so Jokro, Jimato, and Veve,

00:05:44.622 --> 00:05:47.595
each of whom died of a
suspected respiratory illness

00:05:47.595 --> 00:05:50.887
before they turned three years old.

00:05:50.887 --> 00:05:52.742
And these dead infants,
they weren't abandoned

00:05:52.742 --> 00:05:55.180
by their mothers, but they
continued to be carried

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.143
and to be looked after, to
be groomed and protected,

00:05:58.143 --> 00:06:01.391
much like live animals
of this age would be

00:06:01.391 --> 00:06:02.711
by their mothers.

00:06:02.711 --> 00:06:05.556
And over the course of the
carrying, all three infants

00:06:05.556 --> 00:06:09.731
mummified, and the length of the carrying

00:06:09.731 --> 00:06:11.456
was really extraordinary.

00:06:11.456 --> 00:06:13.645
So in the first case, carrying continued

00:06:13.645 --> 00:06:15.705
for more than 27 days.

00:06:15.705 --> 00:06:17.979
In the second case, for 68 days,

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.112
and then in the third case, for 19 days.

00:06:21.112 --> 00:06:23.779
And it's extraordinary for many reasons,

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:26.415
but one of the reasons is
that this length of carrying,

00:06:26.415 --> 00:06:29.498
really amazing because the, you know,

00:06:30.527 --> 00:06:33.727
the infants have to be
carried in ways that

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:37.878
no live infant ever is,
because they, you know,

00:06:37.878 --> 00:06:39.772
they could no longer hold onto the mother

00:06:39.772 --> 00:06:41.744
and they could no longer
cling, so they really

00:06:41.744 --> 00:06:42.869
encumbered the mothers.

00:06:42.869 --> 00:06:46.496
They had to be carried in unusual ways.

00:06:46.496 --> 00:06:49.086
So for example, between,
sorry, by grasping

00:06:49.086 --> 00:06:50.971
a limb between the neck and the shoulder,

00:06:50.971 --> 00:06:52.798
which is what you see
in these images here,

00:06:52.798 --> 00:06:55.002
when the mothers were
walking, or by climbing

00:06:55.002 --> 00:06:58.086
and then, sorry, when
climbing, holding the body

00:06:58.086 --> 00:07:00.075
between the thigh and
the belly, the so-called

00:07:00.075 --> 00:07:02.283
thigh pocket in the chimpanzee,

00:07:02.283 --> 00:07:03.531
that's what you see in this image.

00:07:03.531 --> 00:07:05.903
Or even by dangling, just by the foot when

00:07:05.903 --> 00:07:08.061
resting in the trees.

00:07:08.061 --> 00:07:11.107
And the mothers also
continued to groom the bodies

00:07:11.107 --> 00:07:12.615
and they swatted flies from them.

00:07:12.615 --> 00:07:16.084
You're seeing that in that video.

00:07:16.084 --> 00:07:19.347
And the grooming in
particular, I think you can

00:07:19.347 --> 00:07:21.388
interpret in different ways, I guess.

00:07:21.388 --> 00:07:23.356
So you could, for example,
argue that the mothers,

00:07:23.356 --> 00:07:26.039
these mothers don't know
that their infants are dead,

00:07:26.039 --> 00:07:28.458
and they continue to treat them as alive,

00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:31.862
or that they do know that
the infants are not alive,

00:07:31.862 --> 00:07:35.362
but they choose to keep them clean anyway.

00:07:37.109 --> 00:07:39.002
And then group-mates other than the mother

00:07:39.002 --> 00:07:41.219
also showed a lot of interest in the body.

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:42.592
So, we saw a number of different responses

00:07:42.592 --> 00:07:44.234
from these individuals.

00:07:44.234 --> 00:07:46.147
They ranged from investigatory behaviors,

00:07:46.147 --> 00:07:48.246
like smelling and touching and inspecting,

00:07:48.246 --> 00:07:50.360
or lifting limbs and dropping them,

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:54.669
to dragging and pulling and
playing with the corpses.

00:07:54.669 --> 00:07:57.756
But also, to care-taking and attendance.

00:07:57.756 --> 00:08:00.381
So this, for example,
here is the, is this,

00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:02.951
that infant's grandmother,
who sat by the corpse

00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:05.306
while the mother was off feeding,

00:08:05.306 --> 00:08:08.526
and she groomed it and
she swatted flies from it.

00:08:08.526 --> 00:08:11.037
And the mothers were
generally quite tolerant

00:08:11.037 --> 00:08:12.313
to these behaviors, even if it meant

00:08:12.313 --> 00:08:14.749
relinquishing possession
of the corpses temporarily.

00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:16.600
So you see this one
particular mother here,

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.403
and there's the corpse left behind.

00:08:18.403 --> 00:08:20.771
And this is a juvenile that
comes in quite cautiously,

00:08:20.771 --> 00:08:23.643
picks up the corpse, and carries it off.

00:08:23.643 --> 00:08:25.368
And you see the mother
initially, she turns around,

00:08:25.368 --> 00:08:26.958
she sort of gets up as
if she was making to go

00:08:26.958 --> 00:08:30.225
to get the corpse back, but eventually,

00:08:30.225 --> 00:08:35.126
she just sort of lets the
juvenile run off with it and play.

00:08:35.126 --> 00:08:38.856
And again, this is not too dissimilar to

00:08:38.856 --> 00:08:41.622
what a live infant of this
age would be allowed to do.

00:08:41.622 --> 00:08:43.363
Two year old's do still
travel with the mother

00:08:43.363 --> 00:08:46.091
at all times, but when
the group is stationary,

00:08:46.091 --> 00:08:49.466
the mothers do allow these
infants to wander off

00:08:49.466 --> 00:08:52.299
and play with others in the group.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.582
And then interestingly,
or maybe importantly,

00:08:55.582 --> 00:08:57.271
we never saw any aggression being directed

00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:59.211
towards the corpses, although in one case,

00:08:59.211 --> 00:09:01.087
this is the one case
when an adult male used

00:09:01.087 --> 00:09:04.575
one of these bodies in a
display during a fight.

00:09:04.575 --> 00:09:06.326
So this was at the point when the body had

00:09:06.326 --> 00:09:07.900
already completely mummified.

00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:10.902
But even here, I think this seemed like

00:09:10.902 --> 00:09:13.533
rather kind of gentle
handling of the corpse.

00:09:13.533 --> 00:09:14.854
He's not tearing it to pieces.

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:16.744
He's not sort of flinging it around.

00:09:16.744 --> 00:09:18.657
But actually, sort of quite softly,

00:09:18.657 --> 00:09:20.714
just pulls it along the ground and then

00:09:20.714 --> 00:09:22.766
gently switches hands when,

00:09:22.766 --> 00:09:24.545
when he turns around.

00:09:24.545 --> 00:09:26.576
And just lastly, I want to show a clip

00:09:26.576 --> 00:09:28.211
that illustrates a kind of combination

00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:29.547
of different responses.

00:09:29.547 --> 00:09:31.727
So, here first of all, we've got an infant

00:09:31.727 --> 00:09:33.775
playing with a corpse.

00:09:33.775 --> 00:09:35.069
And I think he's sort of veering between

00:09:35.069 --> 00:09:38.112
fear and curiosity, really.

00:09:38.112 --> 00:09:41.283
Until it seems like curiosity
gets the better of him.

00:09:41.283 --> 00:09:43.630
And so, this is the dead infant's mother,

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:46.594
and this is the live,
so this infant's mother.

00:09:46.594 --> 00:09:48.155
And if you watch
carefully, you'll see that

00:09:48.155 --> 00:09:51.092
that live infant's mother is also peering

00:09:51.092 --> 00:09:54.177
at the body with curiosity, but then she,

00:09:54.177 --> 00:09:58.077
in a moment, she'll
show what might be seen

00:09:58.077 --> 00:09:59.677
as a sort of aversion to the corpse.

00:09:59.677 --> 00:10:00.791
So, watch this.

00:10:00.791 --> 00:10:02.883
So, she doesn't really,
you know, she's happy

00:10:02.883 --> 00:10:05.732
for her infant to play with the corpse,

00:10:05.732 --> 00:10:09.026
but she really doesn't
want to be touched by it.

00:10:09.026 --> 00:10:12.199
So, you know, having said
that, this was really

00:10:12.199 --> 00:10:13.563
the only time when we saw any individual

00:10:13.563 --> 00:10:16.025
respond in this way.

00:10:16.025 --> 00:10:18.903
So, so far I've talked
about dead infant care

00:10:18.903 --> 00:10:20.579
in chimpanzees, but this is something that

00:10:20.579 --> 00:10:22.947
is seen very broadly among primates.

00:10:22.947 --> 00:10:25.468
We have examples, for
example, from geladas,

00:10:25.468 --> 00:10:28.339
mountain gorillas, orangutans, lemurs,

00:10:28.339 --> 00:10:30.791
and some of it on a really huge scale.

00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:32.530
Sugiyama and his colleagues, for example,

00:10:32.530 --> 00:10:36.427
documented over 150 cases
of dead infant carrying

00:10:36.427 --> 00:10:40.663
over 24 years of observation
on Japanese macaques.

00:10:40.663 --> 00:10:43.350
And in each case, really,
the theme is the same.

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:46.258
The mothers continue to
show maternal behavior

00:10:46.258 --> 00:10:49.135
toward their dead infants.

00:10:49.135 --> 00:10:51.738
And furthermore, the behavior
isn't restricted to primates.

00:10:51.738 --> 00:10:54.030
So, other mammals have
been seen to care for

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:56.050
and to transport dead infants.

00:10:56.050 --> 00:10:59.072
So, dolphins and whales, for
example, carry dead calves.

00:10:59.072 --> 00:11:02.062
Dingos and elephants stay
with their deceased young.

00:11:02.062 --> 00:11:06.284
Or this giraffe here from
Fred Bercovitch's observations

00:11:06.284 --> 00:11:09.145
remains with and is sort of nudging her

00:11:09.145 --> 00:11:10.922
dead calf in this picture.

00:11:10.922 --> 00:11:14.514
So, and behavior itself
is generally explained

00:11:14.514 --> 00:11:16.461
in terms of their persistence of this

00:11:16.461 --> 00:11:21.089
extremely strong mother
infant bond in these species.

00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:22.959
It's particularly strong in mammals,

00:11:22.959 --> 00:11:25.930
where the mother really
invests a huge amount

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:28.047
into each of her off-spring.

00:11:28.047 --> 00:11:30.963
And then if we also add
in non-infant deaths,

00:11:30.963 --> 00:11:32.547
so other individuals, there too, we have

00:11:32.547 --> 00:11:34.998
some of the same responses
that we saw for infants,

00:11:34.998 --> 00:11:37.891
of care-taking, like
grooming, the inspection

00:11:37.891 --> 00:11:39.895
and attendance by the body, but also,

00:11:39.895 --> 00:11:41.373
things that indicate maybe more negative

00:11:41.373 --> 00:11:44.319
or sort of conflicted
psychological states,

00:11:44.319 --> 00:11:46.803
such as alarm calling or aggression

00:11:46.803 --> 00:11:50.122
and even cannibalism and
sexual behavior, in some cases.

00:11:50.122 --> 00:11:52.942
And I think there are
also more, kind of nuanced

00:11:52.942 --> 00:11:55.262
response classes as well, but the majority

00:11:55.262 --> 00:11:57.766
really do, the majority which are reported

00:11:57.766 --> 00:11:59.961
in this large collection of papers,

00:11:59.961 --> 00:12:01.358
which I'm going to make use of next,

00:12:01.358 --> 00:12:05.158
can be classed into one or other of these

00:12:05.158 --> 00:12:07.378
kind of broad categories.

00:12:07.378 --> 00:12:09.132
So then on the next
slide, I'm going to try to

00:12:09.132 --> 00:12:11.040
show you graphically how
these different responses

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.912
are distributed among the
main orders in species

00:12:13.912 --> 00:12:15.977
that we saw at the beginning.

00:12:15.977 --> 00:12:18.340
So for example, in
chimpanzees, other authors

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.290
have reported aggression towards corpses,

00:12:21.290 --> 00:12:24.586
including those of infants,
and even cannibalism.

00:12:24.586 --> 00:12:26.379
And then in other species as well,

00:12:26.379 --> 00:12:29.485
we see quite a, sort of broad spectrum of

00:12:29.485 --> 00:12:33.886
responses from care-taking
to sexual behavior.

00:12:33.886 --> 00:12:37.222
But I should say that, so
some of these descriptions,

00:12:37.222 --> 00:12:39.419
I think, are more complete than others.

00:12:39.419 --> 00:12:42.138
And obviously for some
orders, we have information

00:12:42.138 --> 00:12:44.989
on the treatment only of dead infants,

00:12:44.989 --> 00:12:47.360
but not of dead adults, or vice versa.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:49.691
So I think this is maybe
best seen as really

00:12:49.691 --> 00:12:52.625
just a snapshot of our current knowledge.

00:12:52.625 --> 00:12:54.959
Very much just an emerging picture.

00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:57.629
But it does mean that,
I think, we can say that

00:12:57.629 --> 00:13:00.101
at least these responses are present

00:13:00.101 --> 00:13:03.039
in these different orders and species.

00:13:03.039 --> 00:13:05.088
So then the important
question of what drives

00:13:05.088 --> 00:13:06.860
these different responses?

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.283
What might determine when
individuals respond with

00:13:09.283 --> 00:13:12.382
care-taking and when
with aggression or alarm?

00:13:12.382 --> 00:13:14.941
And several people here have

00:13:14.941 --> 00:13:18.735
discussed interesting potential ideas.

00:13:18.735 --> 00:13:21.410
So for example, a death
where the cause is clear,

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:26.384
so let's say, a predator
attack, may lead to less, say,

00:13:26.384 --> 00:13:30.551
alarm calling than a case
where the cause is unclear,

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:33.765
so like, an opaque illness, for example.

00:13:33.765 --> 00:13:35.958
Then, state of decomposition.

00:13:35.958 --> 00:13:39.142
So how much like a live
animal the corpse looks.

00:13:39.142 --> 00:13:41.568
It may be that less
decomposed corpses elicit

00:13:41.568 --> 00:13:44.274
more, kind of, normal
or stronger reactions.

00:13:44.274 --> 00:13:48.645
Then the diseased social,
the diseased social status,

00:13:48.645 --> 00:13:52.332
so an alpha male, a dead
alpha male would generate

00:13:52.332 --> 00:13:55.360
more interest than a
more peripheral male or

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.874
an infant that's not yet socially,

00:13:57.874 --> 00:13:59.593
fully socially integrated.

00:13:59.593 --> 00:14:03.111
Also, the diseased social
relationship to the,

00:14:03.111 --> 00:14:05.249
to the individual.

00:14:05.249 --> 00:14:06.753
So a mother will respond,
probably will respond

00:14:06.753 --> 00:14:09.279
differently to her own
dead off-spring than to

00:14:09.279 --> 00:14:11.096
an unrelated group-mate.

00:14:11.096 --> 00:14:14.306
Also, Christophe Boesch
interestingly suggested,

00:14:14.306 --> 00:14:17.052
groups that live in
high prediction habitats

00:14:17.052 --> 00:14:19.661
have more frequent encounters with,

00:14:19.661 --> 00:14:21.150
and therefore, a more
kind of sophisticated

00:14:21.150 --> 00:14:25.376
knowledge of death, while
a sort of similar vein,

00:14:25.376 --> 00:14:27.339
Katie Cronin's team
suggested a chimpanzee mother

00:14:27.339 --> 00:14:29.467
with a dead infant is actively seeking

00:14:29.467 --> 00:14:33.534
sensory information on the
corpse, which may inform

00:14:33.534 --> 00:14:35.630
her future behavior, should another one of

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:37.582
her infants die.

00:14:37.582 --> 00:14:39.636
So, we might be seeing
not only these kinds of

00:14:39.636 --> 00:14:43.204
proximate body cue and
relationship quality effect,

00:14:43.204 --> 00:14:46.344
but also, learning about
death in determining

00:14:46.344 --> 00:14:48.979
what responses we see.

00:14:48.979 --> 00:14:50.692
But perhaps there's also
a slightly different way

00:14:50.692 --> 00:14:53.090
of looking at this, if we
wanted to split things up

00:14:53.090 --> 00:14:56.483
by sort of underlying
psychological states.

00:14:56.483 --> 00:14:59.637
So there are some reactions
that might fall under

00:14:59.637 --> 00:15:03.928
sort of normal interactions,
and those might suggest

00:15:03.928 --> 00:15:06.198
that there's a lack of understanding that

00:15:06.198 --> 00:15:08.955
the state of that individual has changed.

00:15:08.955 --> 00:15:11.494
Although, I think even
that's not entirely clear

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:15.709
in all cases, but at some
point, we begin to see

00:15:15.709 --> 00:15:18.136
behaviors that suggest
that such recognition

00:15:18.136 --> 00:15:20.066
has indeed taken place.

00:15:20.066 --> 00:15:21.996
And I think stemming
from this recognition,

00:15:21.996 --> 00:15:25.436
we may find things like curiosity,

00:15:25.436 --> 00:15:28.305
curious exploration of the
body, and we may find fear,

00:15:28.305 --> 00:15:31.592
so fearful responses like alarm calling.

00:15:31.592 --> 00:15:34.671
But essentially, I think that

00:15:34.671 --> 00:15:37.593
what we might be seeing is
that at the intersection

00:15:37.593 --> 00:15:41.292
of these things, is a
recognition by the individual

00:15:41.292 --> 00:15:42.883
that something's not right.

00:15:42.883 --> 00:15:46.994
So, even though this
corpse may look normal,

00:15:46.994 --> 00:15:49.196
it doesn't act normal when
I try to play with it.

00:15:49.196 --> 00:15:51.470
It doesn't join in when I hit it.

00:15:51.470 --> 00:15:52.680
It doesn't respond.

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:56.506
So in a way, the corpse
violates expectations,

00:15:56.506 --> 00:15:58.848
as Andre Consales calls
it, to which you might

00:15:58.848 --> 00:16:02.390
respond with curiosity or
fear, or some combination

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:03.473
of these two.

00:16:04.443 --> 00:16:08.515
But if that is the case,
then this can in turn

00:16:08.515 --> 00:16:10.768
tell us about what those expectations are

00:16:10.768 --> 00:16:12.679
that non-human animals have.

00:16:12.679 --> 00:16:14.077
And that comes back to those questions

00:16:14.077 --> 00:16:17.412
that I raised at the very
beginning for the baboon.

00:16:17.412 --> 00:16:19.315
Do they know the
difference between animate

00:16:19.315 --> 00:16:20.706
and inanimate things?

00:16:20.706 --> 00:16:22.419
What cues do they use
to tell the difference

00:16:22.419 --> 00:16:25.449
between things that are alive
and things that aren't alive?

00:16:25.449 --> 00:16:26.282
And so on.

00:16:27.392 --> 00:16:28.437
And of course, these are some of the

00:16:28.437 --> 00:16:31.138
exact same questions that
developmental psychologists

00:16:31.138 --> 00:16:33.719
are asking in studying
children's understanding

00:16:33.719 --> 00:16:36.943
of animacy and death,
and it also links to the

00:16:36.943 --> 00:16:40.443
motivation behind comparative thanatology,

00:16:42.517 --> 00:16:44.554
this recently emerged field, that seeks

00:16:44.554 --> 00:16:47.456
evolutionary roots to death-related

00:16:47.456 --> 00:16:50.099
behavioral and psychological phenomena.

00:16:50.099 --> 00:16:51.996
So the idea is that by using information

00:16:51.996 --> 00:16:54.844
from species that are
both closely and distantly

00:16:54.844 --> 00:16:57.243
related to humans, we can gain insight

00:16:57.243 --> 00:17:00.300
into the evolutionary
origins of our own responses

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:01.300
to the dead.

00:17:02.727 --> 00:17:04.618
So and then, returning to grief, although,

00:17:04.618 --> 00:17:09.407
I think the adaptive value
of grief is unclear to us.

00:17:09.407 --> 00:17:11.872
In other words, it's not entirely clear

00:17:11.872 --> 00:17:13.806
what the function of grief is.

00:17:13.806 --> 00:17:18.210
It could be a signal to
attract support from others,

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:21.771
or simply, it could be
just a byproduct of,

00:17:21.771 --> 00:17:23.500
of the processes that
maintain those strong

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:26.615
social bonds in the first place.

00:17:26.615 --> 00:17:28.395
And they linger even once that individual

00:17:28.395 --> 00:17:31.117
has passed away, one of the
individuals has passed away.

00:17:31.117 --> 00:17:35.481
But having said that, there
are, among non-humans,

00:17:35.481 --> 00:17:39.611
excuse me, quantifiable,
behavioral and hormonal responses

00:17:39.611 --> 00:17:42.056
that accompany the loss of an individual

00:17:42.056 --> 00:17:44.979
with a close social bond,
so we see loss of appetite,

00:17:44.979 --> 00:17:47.382
loss of sleep, withdrawal
from the social group,

00:17:47.382 --> 00:17:51.772
things like lethargy, and
even elevated stress hormones.

00:17:51.772 --> 00:17:54.419
And so, given all of
this, I think I agree with

00:17:54.419 --> 00:17:57.848
Barbara King's perspective
here that it's possible

00:17:57.848 --> 00:18:02.336
to decouple grief from
the awareness of death.

00:18:02.336 --> 00:18:04.374
So, you don't have to know what death is

00:18:04.374 --> 00:18:06.874
in order to be able to grieve.

00:18:08.378 --> 00:18:11.614
And then finally, that brings us to this

00:18:11.614 --> 00:18:14.312
last point, which is that managing grief

00:18:14.312 --> 00:18:16.728
is something that we perhaps
ought to bear in mind

00:18:16.728 --> 00:18:18.807
explicitly when devising management plans

00:18:18.807 --> 00:18:22.259
for dying zoo individuals or even pets.

00:18:22.259 --> 00:18:24.458
So in zoos, dying animals
are often separated

00:18:24.458 --> 00:18:28.434
from their normal social
groups, and pets that are

00:18:28.434 --> 00:18:30.419
about to be euthanized,
they're also separated

00:18:30.419 --> 00:18:32.713
from their companions.

00:18:32.713 --> 00:18:35.217
But this can lead to extended periods of

00:18:35.217 --> 00:18:37.180
searching and distress in those companions

00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:39.943
that get left behind, so
alternative to these practices

00:18:39.943 --> 00:18:42.949
might be seen as more humane.

00:18:42.949 --> 00:18:45.300
So this here is the chimpanzee, Pansy,

00:18:45.300 --> 00:18:48.095
who was allowed to die in the company

00:18:48.095 --> 00:18:51.287
of her social group at a Scottish zoo.

00:18:51.287 --> 00:18:53.594
Jim Anderson and
colleagues who have studied

00:18:53.594 --> 00:18:56.311
that particular case argue
that, that this allowed

00:18:56.311 --> 00:18:58.605
those others in the group

00:18:58.605 --> 00:19:01.801
that remain behind to
get a sense of the fact

00:19:01.801 --> 00:19:04.304
that Pansy wasn't coming back.

00:19:04.304 --> 00:19:06.473
So, if we consider the
welfare of the animals

00:19:06.473 --> 00:19:08.625
that stay behind, then
I think it may be better

00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:12.368
to allow death not to happen
kind of removed in space

00:19:12.368 --> 00:19:15.227
and out of sight, but
actually in the presence

00:19:15.227 --> 00:19:18.522
of the others with whom that individual

00:19:18.522 --> 00:19:20.772
shares a close social bond.

00:19:22.452 --> 00:19:24.736
And that might prevent extended distress

00:19:24.736 --> 00:19:27.574
in these close affiliates
and also, allow animals

00:19:27.574 --> 00:19:30.465
to learn about the dying process and about

00:19:30.465 --> 00:19:31.890
the finality of death.

00:19:31.890 --> 00:19:34.091
Thank you very much.

00:19:34.091 --> 00:19:36.341
(clapping)

00:19:40.449 --> 00:19:42.949
(soft music)
