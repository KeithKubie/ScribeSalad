00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.690
Can you make water explode? Well, maybe not
water per-se, but with a simple technique,

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.860
we can turn one of the most abundant materials
on earth, into a highly explosive gas. In

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:24.640
this project we're building a generator that
uses electricity to convert this, into this.

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:45.629
For this project we're going to need some
stainless steel. I'm at a local fabrication

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.159
company, and not only do they have plenty
of scrap metal to choose from, they're even

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.339
willing to help me cut it to custom sizes.
A job that would have taken me hours with

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:58.110
a pair of tin snips and a hack saw, only takes
a matter of minutes with their equipment.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.110
This is 20 gauge stainless steel, and this
hydraulic punch is being used to cut precise

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.580
holes in the tops and bottoms of the plates.
When finished, I have 12 plates measuring

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.780
3" x 6", 4 plates at 1 1/2" x 6", and three
1" connector bands that are 6", 4 1/2", and

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.460
3 1/4". A belt sander is perfect for smoothing
down the jagged edges around the hole, and

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.230
now it's time to head home and get to work.
We'll need these 4" ABS cleanout fittings,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.500
3/8" poly tubing, as well as some scrap 4"
and 2" acrylic tubing I found at a plastics

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.580
company. When I peel the protective layer
from the plates, it reveals a beautiful and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.110
attractive surface. But that's not what we
want for this project. Instead, we'll need

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.020
to hunt down some sandpaper. This is 100 grit,
and I'll place 2 plates in a diamond shape,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:49.420
and sand from top to bottom, then rotate 90
degrees, and repeat. These scuff marks will

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.190
increase the surface area on the plates and
increase the efficiency of the generator.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.380
Ok, I've finished off both sides of the plates
and you can see the criss-cross pattern etched

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.740
into the metal. The 1 1/2" plates are sanded
as well, but the 3 connector bands are not.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.680
Alright, it's time to cut this acrylic tubing
to size, so I'm using a chop saw to trim this

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:12.280
edge smooth, then I'll measure 7", and cut
nice and slowly so that I don't chip the plastic.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.790
As the blade cuts, the friction also helps
heat the plastic, leaving a fairly clear edge.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.260
After I've cut 5" of the 2" tubing, it's time
to make some connections. With some gentle

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.549
persuasion, I've managed to fit the large
acrylic tube into the clean out adaptor, but

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:30.200
before we push them together, let's add a
liberal amount of clear silicone caulking

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.499
all around the outer base. This will also
go on the inside being very careful not to get

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:38.629
any silicone on the threads. Now we can use
a rubber hammer to tap the tubing all the

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:43.889
way into place, and clean up the excess silicone.
Paper towel works well, and in a few minutes,

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:48.900
it's all cleaned up. We can flip this over,
and repeat the process of attaching, caulking

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:53.939
this part, and this part, tapping into place,
and cleaning up the excess. While I'm in the

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.779
mood for cleaning, I'll use my adhesive remover
to assist in clearing off the UPC stickers,

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:03.739
then give everything one final wipe down.
I'm going to seal the bottom with a 4" ABS

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:08.129
clean-out plug and some ABS cement. The gooey
black cement is applied to the threads of

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.659
both parts, and then I'll use this piece of
scrap wood from my "Solar Scorcher Frame"

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:16.889
project to help screw it in tight. The excess
is removed, and we can let it sit here to

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:21.819
cure. While that's drying, let's get to work
on making the bubbler. I want to attach this

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.499
1/4" 90 degree elbow to the cap, so when the
stickers are removed, I'll grab my 1/2 drill

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:31.559
bit, and a tap. The hole is drilled in the
center, then tapped at 18 thread, just before

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:35.959
adding pipe tape to the elbow adaptor, and
screwing into place. When that's tight, and

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:39.980
I've repeated the exact same process with
the other cap, I'm happy to see they fit snug

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.260
onto my acrylic tubing. It looks unfinished
though, so I'm going to use these top pieces

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.199
from 2 trap adaptors to slide onto the tubing
first, and now when I add the cap, they screw

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:53.900
together giving this piece a clean professional
look. Ok now it's time to work on the generator

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.209
plates. Similar to the bubbler caps, I'm drilling
a 1/2" hole into the top of the 4" clean-out

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:04.589
plug. When that's tapped to 18 thread, we
can add pipe tape to a 3/8" swivel elbow and

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:11.370
screw that into place. You can see this swivels
360 degrees, and that's mostly for convenience.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.249
Using a 5/16" drill bit, I'll make holes on
either side of the cap, and these will be

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:19.859
for attaching the generator plates. I cut
this hole a little close to the edge, but

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.500
no problem. My belt sander easily rounded
the edges, and now it's a perfect fit. Next,

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.639
I'll mark the two smaller bands at about 2
3/4", and use my bench vise and a rubber hammer

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:36.580
to bend them to 90 angles. The 6" piece is
marked at 1 3/4" and 4 1/4", then bent into

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:43.159
a "U" shape. A 5/16" course thread nylon bolt
is cut into two pieces 4" long. I'll get some

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:47.650
nylon washers ready, and add two stainless
steel jam nuts, to the end of each bolt. The

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:51.580
bolts are fitted with two of the connector
straps, and one of the smaller plates, then

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.960
a plastic washer is added on each bolt. These
washers are 3/4" diameter, and about 0.06"

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.020
thick. Another 1 1/2" plate is added, and
secured with a nut on each bolt, and now the

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.389
big plates can go on. I'm stacking these in
the order of plate, washers, plate, nuts,

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.530
and repeating until I've got a total of 8
plates in place. This is the center of the

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.530
generator, and the other connector strap is
added at the top and secured with another

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:21.620
nut. I'll add one more nut to the bottom to
compensate for the gap, and then get back

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:28.360
to my routine of adding plate, washers, plate,
nuts, until I run out of big plates. The two

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.930
smaller plates are added last, and now all
we need to do is trim down the bolt ends to

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:37.639
about 1/2" so we can snap the bottom connector
into place, add a nut, and tighten. The other

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.330
bolt also gets a finishing nut, and then is
trimmed down, and now we just need to turn

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:45.689
the generator around and move these screws
so that we can tighten the inner ones. The

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:50.259
generator plates are done, and looking very
nice, so let's connect them up to the 4" plug.

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:56.000
To do that, I'll add a nut to a 5/16" x 2"
stainless steel bolt and push them through

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.819
the hole in the right connector strap. This
1/4" washer is stainless steel on one side,

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:05.150
and rubber on the other, and I'll push that
down the bolt with the rubber side up. That's

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:09.900
all repeated on the left side, and now the
cap is placed over the bolts. Two more washers

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:14.639
are added, this time with rubber side down,
and secured with another nut. Using an allen

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:18.199
wrench, the nut is tightened securely, and
then a few more nuts and metal washers are

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:23.599
added to the posts for convenience. This piece
is finished. I'm really happy with it, and

00:06:23.599 --> 00:06:28.439
when I dry-fit it into the casing and screw
it into position, I'm starting to get excited.

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:31.969
We're going to need a way to secure the bubbler
to the side, so using some leftovers from

00:06:31.969 --> 00:06:38.110
the 2" pipe, I'll very carefully cut two 3/4"
thick circles, then use a wood 2x4 to hold

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:42.539
the piece flat while I trim off the top. What
I've done is created a clip for our bubbler

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:47.590
and you can see it clips easily onto the tube
and holds firmly in place. The other circle

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.229
is cut, and a belt sander used to match the
pieces as closely as possible. I've got some

00:06:52.229 --> 00:06:57.860
left over acrylic rod from my "Fire Piston"
project, and I'll cut off 2 pieces about 1

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:02.139
1/2" long. I'll use some acrylic glue to secure
the clips to the connector rods, and after

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:06.560
2 minutes they're firm, but will still take
over 2 days to fully cure. While those are

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:12.050
setting, I'll use scissors to cut my poly
tube at 20", and another piece at 2". The

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:16.979
2" piece connects to a one-way check valve,
and gets inserted into the swivel elbow. This

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:21.460
will prevent anything from flowing back into
the generator. The 20" tube goes on the other

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.240
end of the valve, and then connects to one
of the bubbler elbows. It looks like we're

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:29.509
ready to attach the clips to the body, so
let's use the bubbler body as a form for spacing

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:34.210
the clips, and with the generator on it's
side, find where it balances. That looks good

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:38.469
there, so acrylic glue is added to the clips
and replaced on the body. When it sets, I'll

00:07:38.469 --> 00:07:43.180
use a little more glue in the gaps, and remove
the bubbler to let it cure. In the mean time,

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:48.479
we can ready 6 cups of distilled water, and
some flakes of potassium hydroxide. 4 Teaspoons

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:52.499
of flakes will act as a catalyst to help the
electricity flow, so when they're stirred

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:56.949
in, we can open the generator body, and attach
a coffee filter to filter the fluid into the

00:07:56.949 --> 00:08:01.629
super cleaned casing. The filter is removed
and thread tape is added to the cap, then

00:08:01.629 --> 00:08:05.580
the generator plates are slowly inserted into
the solution, and screwed in water tight.

00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:10.169
To finish up, we can remove the top cap from
the bubbler, add some water, and screw it

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:14.590
back together. The remainder of the poly tube
is attached to the bubbler elbow, and there

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:20.599
it is! A sexy looking hydroxy generator! This
system produces an extremely powerful OxyHydrogen

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:25.499
gas. Running on 2 car batteries, it will make
about 5 liters per minute, and when the gas

00:08:25.499 --> 00:08:30.029
is used, it simply turns back into water.
The amount of water already in this system

00:08:30.029 --> 00:08:34.810
is enough to produce thousands and thousands
of liters of fuel. Some people say this is

00:08:34.810 --> 00:08:41.620
the fuel of the future. Whether or not that's
true, the amount of power in the gas, is humbling.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:45.910
Well there's how to build a simple water/fuel
converter. If you liked this project, perhaps
