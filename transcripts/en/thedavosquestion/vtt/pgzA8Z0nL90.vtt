Haakon: Hello YouTube.
We have been focusing on dignity.

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.930
Global dignity is something [inaudible] of
Finland and general Bryant of the US and myself

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.900
have started.
What we're doing is we're focusing on dignity

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.339
as a core value.
That we to be, we want it to be a base so

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:25.449
that we can actually go out and make the right
decisions.

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.699
So that dignity in leadership, dignity in
decision making.

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:36.650
And the idea is that it's possible to actually
increase other people's dignity.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.390
A type of dignity capital.
So that if you actually lift people up, you

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.340
can increase other people dignity.
The beauty of that is of course that then

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.070
also your own dignity is increased.
So we've taken this idea and we've gone into

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.400
schools all around the world.
And talking to kids about what dignity means

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.280
to them.
We ask them to define dignity in their own

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.540
words and also ask them to tell stories of
dignity from their own lives.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:12.270
And come up with suggestions for what they
would like to do the next year to increase

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:19.810
other people dignity.
So I was in Jordan awhile ago, and in my class,

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.829
the class I was assigned to, there was a girl.
And she told a story about her teacher who

00:01:25.829 --> 00:01:32.310
was visually impaired.
This was in her elementary school, and she

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.340
was a very ambitious student, so she was a
bit annoyed because this teacher, she wasn't

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.329
able to use the blackboard, she wasn't able
to catch students if they were sending notes

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:43.140
and so forth.
And she thought she would be better off with

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.829
a better teacher.
[pause]

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.100
So she was a bit annoyed.
She moved on to junior high-school, and she

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:56.450
read in the paper that this teacher was actually
the first visually impaired person in Jordan

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.170
to gain a PH.D, and her whole perspective
changed.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.579
She now became proud that this had been her
teacher.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.590
Her teacher's success became her success.
And I thought that that was just a beautiful

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.650
story how first of all there's more than meets
the eye to every single one of us.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:25.799
Every person has dignity.
and secondly, that there's so much more you

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:31.470
learn in the educational system then just
math and the curriculum.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.700
There's something else thatâ€™s about values,
about who we are as human beings, that is

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.560
really core and essential in creating the
world we want for the future.
