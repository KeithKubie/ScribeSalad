00:00:00.197 --> 00:00:02.947
(soothing music)

00:00:12.284 --> 00:00:13.884
- [Julia] Whether your Cesarean Section

00:00:13.884 --> 00:00:15.792
was scheduled or unexpected,

00:00:15.792 --> 00:00:18.892
it's helpful to know about
the process ahead of time.

00:00:18.892 --> 00:00:21.115
In this video, we'll discuss:

00:00:21.115 --> 00:00:23.585
Why a Cesarean Section might be needed,

00:00:23.585 --> 00:00:26.192
what to expect during
your Cesarean Section,

00:00:26.192 --> 00:00:29.851
and what it means to have
a gentle Cesarean Section.

00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:31.490
There are many reasons why a patient

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.421
may need a Cesarean Section.

00:00:33.421 --> 00:00:35.065
There may be factors identified

00:00:35.065 --> 00:00:37.916
during your prenatal care
that prompt your provider

00:00:37.916 --> 00:00:39.806
to recommend a Cesarean Section.

00:00:39.806 --> 00:00:41.761
Such as a placental abnormality,

00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:45.136
or if the baby is not
positioned head down.

00:00:45.136 --> 00:00:47.393
Alternatively, it may become indicated

00:00:47.393 --> 00:00:49.666
during labor if there
is a concerning pattern

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.530
on the fetal heart rate tracing,

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.726
which is a monitor used

00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:55.900
to access the babies
well being during labor.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.456
Another indication is if there is

00:00:57.456 --> 00:00:59.746
not sufficient dilation of the cervix,

00:00:59.746 --> 00:01:01.414
or if the baby does not seem to be

00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:04.827
descending normally through the pelvis.

00:01:04.827 --> 00:01:07.633
Your provider will fully
inform you of the risks,

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:10.740
benefits, and reason for
your Cesarean Section.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.340
You will meet anesthesiologist

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.826
who will be caring for
you during your procedure.

00:01:14.826 --> 00:01:16.967
Most Cesarean Sections will be performed

00:01:16.967 --> 00:01:18.387
with regional anesthesia.

00:01:18.387 --> 00:01:20.179
Meaning that you will be awake,

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:21.782
but be given an injection in to your back,

00:01:21.782 --> 00:01:23.894
also called a block, that prevents you

00:01:23.894 --> 00:01:26.671
from feeling pain during the surgery.

00:01:26.671 --> 00:01:28.683
You'll be brought back
to the operating room

00:01:28.683 --> 00:01:30.806
where you will be prepared for surgery.

00:01:30.806 --> 00:01:32.375
After your block is placed,

00:01:32.375 --> 00:01:34.064
your team will place a urinary catheter

00:01:34.064 --> 00:01:35.429
to drain your bladder,

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.476
as well as prepare the
sterile field and drapes.

00:01:38.476 --> 00:01:40.239
Everything in your surgery will be done

00:01:40.239 --> 00:01:42.407
using careful, sterile protocol

00:01:42.407 --> 00:01:44.974
to ensure that your risk
of infection is minimized.

00:01:44.974 --> 00:01:47.754
And you will be given breast
feeding safe antibiotics

00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:50.793
to further reduce your risk of infection.

00:01:50.793 --> 00:01:53.161
When everything is ready,
your chosen support person

00:01:53.161 --> 00:01:54.706
will be escorted in to the room

00:01:54.706 --> 00:01:57.574
to be with you at the head of the bed.

00:01:57.574 --> 00:01:59.416
You may feel pressure, pulling,

00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:02.269
or a stretching sensation
during the operation,

00:02:02.269 --> 00:02:04.666
but you will not feel anything sharp.

00:02:04.666 --> 00:02:06.246
Upon delivery of your baby,

00:02:06.246 --> 00:02:08.556
there will be a window in
the curtain that is opened.

00:02:08.556 --> 00:02:10.406
Or the drape will be
lowered so that you can see

00:02:10.406 --> 00:02:13.576
your baby in the first
moments after birth.

00:02:13.576 --> 00:02:15.706
The pediatrics team will
then assess your baby,

00:02:15.706 --> 00:02:16.986
and if there are no complications,

00:02:16.986 --> 00:02:18.366
or additional care needed,

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:21.486
will bring him or her over to you.

00:02:21.486 --> 00:02:24.936
Many hospitals now practice
gentle Cesarean Section.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.568
Where the focus is on reuniting

00:02:26.568 --> 00:02:29.241
the mom and baby as soon as possible.

00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:30.661
Here at UC San Diego Health

00:02:30.661 --> 00:02:32.541
we routinely bring baby back to mom

00:02:32.541 --> 00:02:34.661
on the operating room table right away.

00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:35.891
And if she feels well enough,

00:02:35.891 --> 00:02:39.605
help her put baby skin to
skin, or hold her baby.

00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:41.241
Some patients even start nursing

00:02:41.241 --> 00:02:44.331
while the Cesarean Section
is being completed.

00:02:44.331 --> 00:02:46.711
Other components of a
gentle Cesarean Section

00:02:46.711 --> 00:02:49.763
may include classical
music and dimmed lights.

00:02:49.763 --> 00:02:53.058
Aside from the operating
lights, of course.

00:02:53.058 --> 00:02:54.837
Recovery for a Cesarean Section

00:02:54.837 --> 00:02:57.332
does take longer than
for a vaginal delivery.

00:02:57.332 --> 00:02:59.634
Immediately after your Cesarean Section,

00:02:59.634 --> 00:03:02.536
you will be in a special
post-operative recovery room

00:03:02.536 --> 00:03:04.852
for a few hours before
moving to your private

00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:07.233
postpartum room with your baby.

00:03:07.233 --> 00:03:09.486
Most women will spend three
nights in the hospital

00:03:09.486 --> 00:03:12.029
after a Cesarean Section,
and will require pain

00:03:12.029 --> 00:03:15.789
medications containing a
small amount of opioids.

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:17.809
It will still be safe to breast feed.

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:19.972
Sometimes it takes slightly
longer for your milk

00:03:19.972 --> 00:03:22.389
to come in after a Cesarean Section.

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.557
Your lactation team will help support you

00:03:24.557 --> 00:03:26.504
and your baby to meet
your breast feeding goals

00:03:26.504 --> 00:03:28.636
during this transition.

00:03:28.636 --> 00:03:30.810
Once you are home, recovery will continue

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.276
for four to six weeks.

00:03:32.276 --> 00:03:35.075
Avoiding lifting anything
heavier than 15 pounds

00:03:35.075 --> 00:03:39.360
during this time is important
to help your body to heal.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.986
It's important to ask questions

00:03:40.986 --> 00:03:43.256
or voice any concerns or
requests that you have

00:03:43.256 --> 00:03:46.478
before, during, or after
your Cesarean Section.

00:03:46.478 --> 00:03:48.194
Your treatment team cares

00:03:48.194 --> 00:03:50.617
that your experience is
as smooth as possible

00:03:50.617 --> 00:03:52.609
with the ultimate goal of healthy mom

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.108
and healthy baby.
