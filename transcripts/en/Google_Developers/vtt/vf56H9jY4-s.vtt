ADAM CARPENTER: Hi, everybody.

00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.740
Welcome back from break.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.350
My name is Adam Carpenter, and
I lead Google Play's Developer

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:07.790
Business Growth Initiative.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.600
MOONLIT BESHIMOV:
And I'm Moonlit.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.090
I'm a Business Development
Manager at Google Play Games.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.760
ADAM CARPENTER:
Over the next hour,

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:13.343
you're going to hear
a number of talks

00:00:13.343 --> 00:00:16.880
about how to optimize your
game's post-launch performance.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.380
In this session,
we're going to talk

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.644
about identifying opportunities
in your game's data.

00:00:21.644 --> 00:00:23.060
First, we're going
to show you how

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.400
to structure a nimble
product team that's empowered

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.274
to make data-driven decisions.

00:00:27.274 --> 00:00:29.190
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: Second,
from our experiences

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:31.350
of working with, and
for each of us, part

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.980
of Google top game
developers, what

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.100
are the top five analytics
questions to gauge your game's

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.839
performance.

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:40.130
ADAM CARPENTER: And last,
why a culture of transparency

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.207
will be critical to your
game's success and growth.

00:00:43.207 --> 00:00:44.540
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: Let's dive in.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.850
In my years working
the gaming industry,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.580
it's clear that to improve
a game's performance,

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.210
we must first understand your
players' behavior through data.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.540
But the question is, what's
the right data to track?

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:59.480
Adam, in your experience,
what's that one piece of advice

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.340
you give to a new developer?

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.200
ADAM CARPENTER:
Record everything.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.690
And I know this gets said a
lot, but it's very, very true.

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.110
Your players' kind of
engagement, participation data,

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.710
it's absolutely priceless, and
it's impossible to recreate.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.330
If you're not recording it
when the actions are happening,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.100
there's no way to get it back.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.830
So even if you're
a tiny developer,

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.140
and you're unable to leverage
many of the third party

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.180
analytics solutions
that are out there,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.400
at least try to record your
data into a flat file format.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.220
If you have it
saved off somewhere,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.800
you can always eventually suck
it up into a data warehouse,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.290
begin to slice and
dice it, and understand

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.170
where your players find
value, and what opportunities

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.229
exist to grow your business.

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.520
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: Assuming
you are recording everything

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:43.895
and making it accessible,
but the data cannot interpret

00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:45.430
itself.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.140
To draw the right insights
and create right action plans

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.000
based on these
insights, you need

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.090
to have the right people
in the right structure.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.000
So the next step is to
build the right team.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.160
In my experience,
many developers

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.140
set up their product
management and analysts teams

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.620
in what I call a classic model.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.100
In this team structure, you
have the PMs sit in one group,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.530
and analysts sit in a
completely separate group.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.250
ADAM CARPENTER:
Maybe it's a case

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.250
of the analysts being
part of a central services

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.240
team, while the PMs,
they're embedded

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.520
within the game team itself.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.640
In some other scenarios, both
the analysts and the PMs,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.860
they're integrated
within to the game team.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.050
But unfortunately,
they might have

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.110
different leaders who have
completely different agendas.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.515
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: Does this
sound familiar to anyone?

00:02:29.515 --> 00:02:30.890
ADAM CARPENTER:
In this setup, it

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.320
might feel like there's
this huge, monolithic wall

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.980
in between the two groups.

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.540
PMs, they're not able or
willing to play with the data,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.940
and the analysts, while
they have access to data,

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.282
they're not empowered
to drive any change.

00:02:43.282 --> 00:02:44.990
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: In
this team structure,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.170
it often feels like PMs will
throw a question over the wall,

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.450
letting analysts work
on it for some time,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.660
and just wait for
the final answer.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.250
Then, depending on how
well-formed the question is,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.890
or what the request is,
the analysts' answer

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.600
can vary a lot.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.490
ADAM CARPENTER: Sometimes
it's meaningful,

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:03.620
other times it's
just a data dump.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.680
And then in some cases, it
takes so long for the analysts

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.350
to generate an answer, that
the PMs have completely

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.055
moved on by the time
they get their response.

00:03:12.055 --> 00:03:13.430
MOONLIT BESHIMOV:
Setup like this

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.560
can create a whole
lot of problems

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.300
that are counterproductive
to having

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.750
an agile, collaborative,
and responsive team.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.120
Too often than we'd
like, both parties

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.232
might think that thinking the
worst about their counterparts.

00:03:26.232 --> 00:03:27.190
ADAM CARPENTER: Mm-hmm.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.202
PMs will often wonder
why it takes so long,

00:03:29.202 --> 00:03:31.160
and when they do get an
answer, it isn't really

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.480
what they're looking for.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.021
And then analysts,
on the other hand,

00:03:34.021 --> 00:03:36.980
they're often really frustrated
by the poorly-formed questions

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.050
they get from PMs,
and they're often

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.990
left wondering if the PMs
are just asking questions

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.491
to waste their time.

00:03:43.491 --> 00:03:44.990
MOONLIT BESHIMOV:
On both sides, you

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.230
have people thinking those
on the other side of the wall

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.380
just don't get the business.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.520
Adam, do you have
any suggestions?

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:55.280
ADAM CARPENTER: So if you want
a small and nimble team, one

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.590
that's really empowered to
drive meaningful change--

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.220
business performance --break
away from the standard model.

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:04.250
Get rid of that wall between
your PMs and your analysts.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.170
And in fact, I'll
go one step further.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.350
Get rid of the concept
that PMs and analysts

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.190
need to be separate people.

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.110
For most of us game
devs, we're not

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.000
trying to make tiny
poor performance

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.530
improvements to our titles--

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.450
changes which require
a tease test just

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.579
to know if the results
are significant.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.769
To use a baseball
analogy, we're at bat,

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:23.460
and we're swinging
for singles, doubles,

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.550
and the occasional home run.

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.490
Results, which when viewed in
the context of an A/B test,

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:30.684
are immediate and obvious.

00:04:30.684 --> 00:04:32.600
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: What
we're referring to here

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.960
is a hybrid model where
your PM and analyst

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.970
the very same person.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.610
This role structure can
unleash their potential

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.584
by giving them autonomy,
domain expertise, and purpose.

00:04:44.584 --> 00:04:46.500
ADAM CARPENTER: Set your
PM/analyst hybrids up

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.520
so they own a critical
vertical in the game,

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.400
and then empower them.

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.580
Look to your PMs
to write queries,

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.700
retrieve the data,
slice and dice

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.060
it to form a complete and full
understanding of the problem,

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.850
as well as a hypothesis
about what the solution is.

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.900
Then have them partner
with your engineers,

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.900
your creative
designers, your artists

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.400
to come up with a solution.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.260
And once the solution
has been implemented--

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.300
the new feature --own it.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.290
Monitor the results post-launch.

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.170
Make sure you're
iterating, and optimizing,

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:17.240
and constantly trying
to improve and identify

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.312
vectors for change.

00:05:19.312 --> 00:05:21.770
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: In summary,
to empower your team members,

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:24.920
give them real ownership
over the product roadmap,

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.550
and the ability to conduct
hypothesis-driven testing.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:31.280
Give them the freedom to
choose the resources to let

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.880
them work on improving
your game's performance.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.670
Now suppose you have
the right team in place.

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:39.740
To unleash their
potential, leverage

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.614
the power of innate curiosity.

00:05:42.614 --> 00:05:44.030
ADAM CARPENTER:
Empower your team,

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.405
and encourage them to ask
critical questions about what's

00:05:46.405 --> 00:05:48.470
actually happening in your game.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.553
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: One of
the most frequently asked

00:05:50.553 --> 00:05:52.100
questions I get
from my developers

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.860
is that we track and
see a lot of data.

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:58.010
But what questions do we ask
to understand if our game is

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:59.950
actually performing well?

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.970
Here's some to get you started.

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:05.390
But most importantly, take
these as the inspiration

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.610
for the type of data
you ask your team,

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.111
and for your team
to ask themselves.

00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:11.026
ADAM CARPENTER: Consider
how your new installs

00:06:11.026 --> 00:06:11.700
are performing.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.030
Are they returning the day
after their first session?

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.430
And if they are, how much time
are they actually spending

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:17.750
playing the game?

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.960
Likewise, think about how we can
better quantify and understand

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.900
what brings players back to
the game each and every day,

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:27.350
and when they do return, where
are they perceiving value?

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.930
Additionally, think about
drilling deeper and deeper

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:32.960
into the metrics, and moving
away from lagging indicators

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.580
like revenue and DAU.

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.180
Instead try to focus on finding
meaningful participation

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:41.510
metrics which can serve
as leading indicators.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.630
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: Let's take a
look at our top five in detail.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.270
For those of you who
attended our Playtime event

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:49.520
or read our Medium
article, you may

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:52.610
be familiar with the concept
that your players' first 10

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:55.460
minutes in your game
is an early indicator

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.530
of the next-day retention.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:59.750
We recommend that you
plot the following graph.

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.130
On the x-axis, you
have the average number

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.550
of minutes your players
spend in your game

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.440
on their very
first day, against,

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.930
on the y-axis, the
percentage of players

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:10.795
who come back on day two.

00:07:10.795 --> 00:07:12.920
ADAM CARPENTER: Usually
what we would expect to see

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.930
is that with each
successive minute played,

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:18.050
a greater percentage of
users are likely to return.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.210
However using
Google Play's data,

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:24.620
we've been able to identify two
negative patterns in the game,

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.427
that when you look at
your own game data,

00:07:26.427 --> 00:07:28.760
you can identify opportunities
for growing and improving

00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:30.110
your retention.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.390
The first pattern,
which we call the flats,

00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.042
retention is largely flat for
the first 5 to 10 minutes.

00:07:35.042 --> 00:07:36.500
And the second
pattern, which we've

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:38.180
dubbed the gorge,
which you can actually

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:41.840
see your retention dropping over
the first three to five minutes

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.790
before it begins to rise.

00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.490
If you see either of these
two patterns in your own data,

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:48.740
it suggests that there are
significant opportunities

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.475
to improve your early retention.

00:07:50.475 --> 00:07:51.850
MOONLIT BESHIMOV:
To all the PMs,

00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.340
analysts, and business owners in
the audience, plot this graph.

00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.530
And if your see either of
these improvement signals,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.820
be very curious what's
actually causing it.

00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:04.230
Is it a very large
secondary download?

00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:05.900
Is it your tutorial?

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.680
Is it the very confusing lobby?

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.780
Or maybe you are overly
aggressive in terms

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:13.190
monetization in the first
five minutes of game play.

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:15.680
All of these can heavily
impact your first-time user

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:19.148
experience, and thus
lower your retention.

00:08:20.867 --> 00:08:22.950
ADAM CARPENTER: After
you've gotten your new users

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:24.709
to come back over
the first few days,

00:08:24.709 --> 00:08:27.000
think about what's keeping
them there in the long term,

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.610
and whether they're spending
more or less time in your game.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:31.485
To see that, you can
take a look at the graph

00:08:31.485 --> 00:08:32.549
on the right-hand side.

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.289
What it shows is
the average amount

00:08:34.289 --> 00:08:36.630
of time per user in
the install cohort

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:38.700
who returned on a given day.

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:41.700
The x-axis is the number of days
since the user's first session,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:43.770
and the y-axis is, again,
that average amount

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:45.570
of time per active user.

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:47.180
It's an important
to view, as it's

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.470
going to help you understand
the extent to which

00:08:49.470 --> 00:08:51.900
your new installs are spending
greater or lesser amounts

00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:53.540
of time in your game.

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.220
In almost all the games that
we've looked at, what you see

00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.950
is this very sharp rise from
the day one minute to the day

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.150
two minutes.

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:02.500
This is driven largely by
the low-quality installs

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.490
that you get in that
first day churning out,

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:06.281
and the users who come
back on the next day

00:09:06.281 --> 00:09:08.154
being exceptionally engaged.

00:09:08.154 --> 00:09:09.570
MOONLIT BESHIMOV:
Past day 10, you

00:09:09.570 --> 00:09:11.940
may see one of the
following three patterns:

00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.120
growing, stable, or declining.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.280
There's no one right
answer to this.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.940
Most importantly, take
this as a starting point

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:23.035
to investigate what's
driving user behavior.

00:09:23.035 --> 00:09:24.660
Think about what the
in-game experience

00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:27.150
is like from their perspective.

00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:29.840
For example, if the
minutes per active install

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:32.160
grows significantly
over time, is it

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.380
because of overall
low retention,

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:38.130
where only your most loyal
players remain, or is it

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:41.020
because players think they
have to spend a lot of time

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:43.380
in your game in
order to succeed?

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.840
On the other hand, you might
have a very amazing feature

00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.790
that's only available
after level 20, 30, or 40.

00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:54.150
ADAM CARPENTER: If average
play time is shrinking,

00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:56.040
think about what
might be causing that.

00:09:56.040 --> 00:09:57.312
Is it as case of content?

00:09:57.312 --> 00:09:58.770
Your game just
doesn't have enough,

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.436
and despite the fact
that players really

00:10:00.436 --> 00:10:03.840
want to engage in play, there
isn't enough for them to do.

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:06.630
Also, think about how your
game economy is structured.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:07.470
Is it too tight?

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:09.050
Are you squeezing your players?

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.324
And are you forcing them
to pay too early such

00:10:11.324 --> 00:10:13.240
that they can't spend
enough time in the game,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.330
and they're more
likely to churn out.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.790
We'd strongly encourage you
to go back to your development

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:20.100
teams, generate plots
like this, and then be

00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:23.100
curious about what's actually
happening in your game, what

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:24.420
patterns you're seeing.

00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.150
Because being curious about how
your new players are engaging

00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.700
in the game will set you up
for success by helping you

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:32.580
understand what gameplay aspects
might be helping or hindering

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.560
your game's performance.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.780
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: For your
broad DAU base, have you

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:40.090
thought about what brings
them back each and every day?

00:10:40.090 --> 00:10:43.260
A view we particularly
like, segment your DAU

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:46.920
based on when your players
were last active in your game.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:50.310
For example, take all of
today's DAU, and group them

00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:53.280
based on what percentage
is from new installs.

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:55.980
What percentage was
active yesterday,

00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:58.920
what percentage was active
two to four days ago,

00:10:58.920 --> 00:11:00.022
so on and so forth.

00:11:00.022 --> 00:11:01.980
ADAM CARPENTER: When
viewing a graph like this,

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.740
what you're trying to do is
maximize the percent of DAU

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.050
who was last active yesterday,
because this would mean

00:11:07.050 --> 00:11:08.924
that a majority of your
users are coming back

00:11:08.924 --> 00:11:11.020
to the game each and every day.

00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.590
Now it's unlikely you
will ever get to 100%

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:15.630
last active yesterday,
but that should

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.790
be all of our stretch goals.

00:11:17.790 --> 00:11:20.430
And for each segment
besides those who are active

00:11:20.430 --> 00:11:22.920
the day before, think
about what their needs are,

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.420
where their interests lie.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:27.030
Think about how you can provide
better experiences, better

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:30.690
incentives to get your players
to return each and every day.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:32.664
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: It's
especially important

00:11:32.664 --> 00:11:34.080
to focus on the
group of users who

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:37.010
are less active two
to four days ago,

00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:40.260
as these are the easiest to
convert to daily players.

00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.940
Think about what
incentives can you

00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:45.520
offer to have them come
back each and every day.

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.790
Can you strengthen
your return mechanics?

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.320
Can you personalize
a push notification?

00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.770
Or can you leverage
your social system

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:56.490
to create extremely compelling
experiences to bring them back

00:11:56.490 --> 00:11:59.430
day after day after day?

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:02.190
ADAM CARPENTER: In addition
to segmenting your users

00:12:02.190 --> 00:12:05.100
by their daily last
active play, you

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:07.410
can also do the equivalent
thing for your revenue

00:12:07.410 --> 00:12:08.774
and your buyers.

00:12:08.774 --> 00:12:10.940
The charts we're looking
at here show the percentage

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.900
of revenue in the
percent of buyers

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.840
based on when those users
last paid in the game.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.090
And the way to calculate
this, for example,

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.050
let's say it's today.

00:12:19.050 --> 00:12:21.000
Take all the revenue
you earned from today,

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.850
and then segment it,
create sections and slices

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:26.750
based on when those users
previously paid in the game.

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.070
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: Views
like this are very valuable

00:12:29.070 --> 00:12:32.370
to understand when, where,
and how your players perceive

00:12:32.370 --> 00:12:34.170
value in your game.

00:12:34.170 --> 00:12:38.190
For example, look at this
graph, and ask what percentage

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.180
is your first-time buyers.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:41.880
If you are relatively
new game, and you

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:44.180
see a high percentage
of first-time buyers,

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:45.910
that's to be expected.

00:12:45.910 --> 00:12:48.580
But this number should be
trending down over time

00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:52.480
as you convert your first-time
buyers into repeated buyers.

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.480
So if you're
relatively mature game

00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.810
and you still see a very high
first-time buyer percentage,

00:12:57.810 --> 00:12:59.640
ask yourself what's
incentivizing

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.539
a user to purchase
once, but not again?

00:13:02.539 --> 00:13:04.080
ADAM CARPENTER:
Likewise, take a look

00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.310
at the percent of your
daily buyers and revenue

00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:07.976
which is coming from
users who purchased

00:13:07.976 --> 00:13:10.879
in the last week, the last
month, or the last quarter,

00:13:10.879 --> 00:13:13.170
and then think about what's
driving a specific purchase

00:13:13.170 --> 00:13:16.780
frequency, and how players are
perceiving value in your game.

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:19.410
Think about what causes them to
open up their wallets and pay,

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.705
and when they do, are they
having a good experience?

00:13:22.705 --> 00:13:24.080
Then, see if you
have the ability

00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:26.780
to shift monthly buyers to
weekly, or quarterly buyers

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.110
to monthly.

00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:30.860
If you're able to do this, it'll
help stabilize your revenue

00:13:30.860 --> 00:13:32.960
and make it much
more predictable.

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.460
MOONLIT BESHIMOV:
Finally, we'd like

00:13:34.460 --> 00:13:37.230
to encourage you to move
away from vanity metrics,

00:13:37.230 --> 00:13:39.072
like DAU and revenue.

00:13:39.072 --> 00:13:41.030
While these are important
business metrics that

00:13:41.030 --> 00:13:43.010
measure the health
of your game, they

00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:47.570
are just the end results,
not the leading indicators.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:50.774
ADAM CARPENTER: Instead try to
identify a metric or metrics

00:13:50.774 --> 00:13:52.940
which can serve as the most
meaningful and effective

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:55.700
representation of
engagement in your game.

00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:57.610
Finding the right
participation metric

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:59.540
will let you identify
issues in the game

00:13:59.540 --> 00:14:02.960
before they begin to
impact revenue and DAU.

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:05.030
As a broad concept,
participation

00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:06.980
measures the percent
of your DAU who

00:14:06.980 --> 00:14:10.102
are engaging in a critical
action on a given day.

00:14:10.102 --> 00:14:11.810
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: To
give you an example,

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.110
here are the ideas from
three popular genres.

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:18.260
Much like game developers
use level completion

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:20.890
as our participation
metric, players

00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:22.730
who have been in
the level or those

00:14:22.730 --> 00:14:24.440
who exit the game
before finishing

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:26.450
the level don't count.

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:28.640
Instead, they measure
the number of players

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.400
who played the level all the
way to the end whether they

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.560
pass or fail.

00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.930
They use this as a
participation metric,

00:14:35.930 --> 00:14:38.240
because it measures
a player's intent

00:14:38.240 --> 00:14:41.230
to finish the level and
progress in the game.

00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.270
It also has the added bonus
of surfacing monetization

00:14:44.270 --> 00:14:46.220
opportunities when
players are out

00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.590
of moves and need power-ups.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.540
ADAM CARPENTER: In games
like slots or bingo--

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:52.400
social Casino genre,
et cetera, you

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.850
have some very interesting
dynamics in the game economy.

00:14:55.850 --> 00:14:57.350
The way the game
economy works is,

00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:59.558
whether its credits or its
coins, generally speaking,

00:14:59.558 --> 00:15:02.580
players can accumulate a near
unlimited amount of resources.

00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:05.270
So what you actually have is
a relatively large percent

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:08.280
of the DAU come back everyday
to collect their assets,

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.880
but they never actually consume
or spend any in the game.

00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:12.740
This has led many
slots developers

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:14.990
to use the notion
that a user who

00:15:14.990 --> 00:15:17.750
sinks coins playing a
slot machine for part

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.160
of their participation metric.

00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.590
Or some of the even more
advanced slots developers,

00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:23.210
their participation
metric is actually

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.700
the percent of their DAU
you who goes out of coins

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.047
playing on a given day.

00:15:27.047 --> 00:15:28.880
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: In
mythical strategy games

00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:31.370
like War Dragons,
player interactions

00:15:31.370 --> 00:15:33.040
are very important.

00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.750
Paul [? Gayjan, ?]
the game developer,

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:36.800
tracked the number
of daily attacks

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:39.470
and participation
in weekly events.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:44.480
When during attack, players are
actively engaged in gameplay.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.940
Attacks also generate
two actions--

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.440
retaliation, and
base repairment.

00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:52.400
Both increase a player's
investment in game and resource

00:15:52.400 --> 00:15:53.630
consumption.

00:15:53.630 --> 00:15:55.400
The same is true
for weekly events.

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.191
ADAM CARPENTER: In all
cases, participation

00:15:57.191 --> 00:15:59.960
is critical, as it measures
the player's intent--

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.790
their desire to play.

00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:04.280
We'd strongly encourage you
to explore your own data,

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.340
and figure out what your
key participation metric is,

00:16:07.340 --> 00:16:10.370
as finding it will help you
better understand your players

00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:12.302
and the overall
health of your game.

00:16:12.302 --> 00:16:14.510
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: Now suppose
you have the right team

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:17.900
structure, and by leveraging
their innate curiosity,

00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:20.480
you're asking it all
the right questions.

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:23.210
But how do you find
the right answers?

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:26.240
The best answers cannot
be discovered in silo,

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:29.330
and the best solutions
often cover very different

00:16:29.330 --> 00:16:30.680
perspectives.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.790
To have that
diverse perspective,

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.750
it's important to have
the right team culture.

00:16:35.750 --> 00:16:38.780
So ask this: what is
your team culture?

00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:41.270
Is it open or is it closed?

00:16:41.270 --> 00:16:45.529
Do you hold information tightly,
or do you share it widely?

00:16:45.529 --> 00:16:47.320
ADAM CARPENTER: Sharing
thoughts, findings,

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.540
and insights--

00:16:48.540 --> 00:16:51.260
they're absolutely critical
to your game's success.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:55.070
And likewise, how you share
information is important.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:57.360
Sharing data alone
is meaningless.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:00.080
What you actually need to
do is share information,

00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:01.880
which is data in context.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:04.400
For while data by itself
can be interesting,

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:07.357
information is meaningful
and actionable.

00:17:07.357 --> 00:17:09.440
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: So open
up your weekly analytics

00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.710
meetings to all of the key
stakeholders of your business.

00:17:12.710 --> 00:17:15.890
Use these meetings as a
platform to not only discuss

00:17:15.890 --> 00:17:19.250
past updates, events,
and sales, but also

00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:23.255
ask probing questions to each
other, and brainstorm together.

00:17:23.255 --> 00:17:25.130
ADAM CARPENTER: Likewise,
encourage your team

00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:28.040
to make sharing a regular
part of their daily work.

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:29.480
If they are
investigating an issue

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.580
or trying improve a
feature, encourage

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.920
them to call a peer over,
talk through the trends

00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.260
and patterns, understand
what's going on,

00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.120
and ultimately
work to understand

00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.150
and come up with
effective solutions.

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:42.860
MOONLIT BESHIMOV:
Now let's summarize.

00:17:42.860 --> 00:17:45.590
What does it take to
identify opportunities

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:47.294
through games data?

00:17:47.294 --> 00:17:48.710
ADAM CARPENTER:
First, if you want

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.854
to be able to identify
opportunities, the most

00:17:50.854 --> 00:17:52.520
important thing is
to ensure that you're

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:55.464
recording absolutely everything
that's happening in your game.

00:17:55.464 --> 00:17:57.380
MOONLIT BESHIMOV: Second,
make sure you set up

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.590
an agile team
whose well-equipped

00:17:59.590 --> 00:18:03.050
to not only interpret the
data, but to also take actions

00:18:03.050 --> 00:18:04.580
based on these insights.

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:06.413
ADAM CARPENTER: And
then encourage your team

00:18:06.413 --> 00:18:08.390
to be curious about
anything and everything.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:12.440
Dig through the data, ask
questions, generate insights.

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.670
Always be curious about
what your users are valuing

00:18:14.670 --> 00:18:17.990
in your game, and how you can
use your understanding of that

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.970
to improve your business
and drive long-term growth.

00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:22.490
MOONLIT BESHIMOV:
Finally, encourage

00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:26.250
that culture of sharing at
all levels of your company--

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.469
101, intra-team, as
well as company-wide.

00:18:29.469 --> 00:18:31.760
ADAM CARPENTER: Thank you
guys very much for your time.

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.632
Hope it was interesting.

00:18:33.632 --> 00:18:36.999
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:39.529 --> 00:18:41.570
Now we're going to turn
it over to Belinda, who's

00:18:41.570 --> 00:18:43.787
going to share some
updates about monetizing

00:18:43.787 --> 00:18:44.870
with Google's ad platform.

00:18:58.961 --> 00:19:00.710
BELINDA LANGNER: Good
afternoon, everyone.

00:19:00.710 --> 00:19:03.560
How's everyone doing today?

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.964
Great.

00:19:04.964 --> 00:19:07.130
It's really great to be
here at GDC with all of you.

00:19:07.130 --> 00:19:09.588
I'm really excited to be able
to talk to you all about some

00:19:09.588 --> 00:19:12.290
of the cool things that
our teams are working on.

00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.100
So I'm Belinda Langner,
and I'm a Product Manager

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:17.980
working on Google's
mobile app ads business.

00:19:17.980 --> 00:19:20.440
My job is to build
products for app developers

00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:23.170
like yourselves to build
really great businesses,

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:26.980
and successful businesses,
by acquiring high-value users

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:28.660
through advertising.

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:33.430
And then Vishal is going
to come up and tell you

00:19:33.430 --> 00:19:36.214
a little bit more about how you
can earn more for your players.

00:19:36.214 --> 00:19:37.630
So let's go ahead
and get started,

00:19:37.630 --> 00:19:38.890
and I'll tell you
a little bit more

00:19:38.890 --> 00:19:41.056
about how Google can really
help grow your fan base.

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.060
So as we've heard from a
number of presenters today,

00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.070
we know that there's a
tremendous opportunity

00:19:50.070 --> 00:19:52.470
out their for game
developers today.

00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:56.490
Mobile has really democratized
the entire gaming industry,

00:19:56.490 --> 00:20:00.570
and made it more accessible to
more people than ever before.

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:07.440
In fact, today there are over
$2.6 billion gamers in 2017,

00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:12.180
and that's compared to
100 million in 1995.

00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:14.622
That's a huge growth curve
when you think about it,

00:20:14.622 --> 00:20:16.330
and it makes product
managers like myself

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:18.180
and Vishal very
excited, obviously,

00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:21.000
and it should make you
all very excited, too.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:28.780
So 80% of mobile game players
today play at least once a day,

00:20:28.780 --> 00:20:30.120
and that includes me.

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.620
I think, actually,
if you look back,

00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.927
I never would have
called myself a gamer.

00:20:33.927 --> 00:20:35.760
I've always really liked
playing board games

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:38.402
with my brother growing
up, and things like that.

00:20:38.402 --> 00:20:40.110
But, like, when I used
to think of gamer,

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.930
I used to think of a very
different sort of profile.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:45.450
But in fact, I spent a lot
of hours playing things

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:46.230
like Alphabears.

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.540
In fact, I played that over
on the BART ride in today

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.070
to the city.

00:20:50.070 --> 00:20:52.350
And I just really enjoy
playing these games.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.710
And I actually spend quite a bit
of time on my commute playing,

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.530
I spend quite a bit of time
when I wake up just kind of,

00:20:58.530 --> 00:21:01.500
you know, playing to
kind put my mind off

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:04.740
of things a little bit, or you
know, at night, right before I

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:08.820
go to bed, just to kind
of relax a little bit

00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:10.990
before I go to bed.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:13.320
And so as more people
play, and as more people

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:16.080
like myself get
interested in games

00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:18.150
with cute adorable
animals, there

00:21:18.150 --> 00:21:21.090
are even more ways than ever
to build a profitable business

00:21:21.090 --> 00:21:23.132
around games.

00:21:23.132 --> 00:21:24.590
And we're here
today to talk to you

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:27.420
about the business of gaming,
and how Google ads can really

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.590
help you be successful.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.965
So let's go ahead and
dive in a little bit more.

00:21:32.965 --> 00:21:35.340
Starting with growth, I'm
going to talk a little bit more

00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:37.020
about the tools
that can really help

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:41.160
grow a fan base for your games.

00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.330
So I don't need to be the
one to tell you this, because

00:21:44.330 --> 00:21:46.220
most likely you all know this.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.250
Acquiring players for games
is highly competitive,

00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:50.750
and the profile
of players playing

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:54.620
hard games versus hardcore
strategy games, versus games

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:58.280
that have cute, adorable animals
in it, is very quite different.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:00.860
And it's even harder
to tell who's actually

00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:03.470
going to be staying
engaged for longer,

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:06.480
and whether or not they're
going to spend within the app.

00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:08.930
In addition, as the
gaming industry grows,

00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:10.890
the profiles of these
people start to change.

00:22:10.890 --> 00:22:13.100
And so what you think
of a traditional gamer,

00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.380
and how you categorize
these, may not actually

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.480
tell the full story of
people who are actually

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:20.120
engaging with your game.

00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.520
And that is where we can help.

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:27.110
In 2015, we launched Universal
App Campaigns, or UAC,

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:31.160
as a great way for developers to
automatically find and acquire

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:35.540
the right users across all
of our largest properties.

00:22:35.540 --> 00:22:40.250
UAC has made marketing
better, easier, and simpler

00:22:40.250 --> 00:22:44.060
for developers such as
yourselves to build and grow

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.650
your businesses.

00:22:45.650 --> 00:22:47.750
And rather than
having to figure out

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.730
how each of the
nuances of our networks

00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:52.220
work by adding
thousands of keywords

00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.130
or individual testing--

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:58.400
a ton of headlines to see which
ones work best --developers now

00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.130
are able to take advantage
of Google's machine learning

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:04.700
platform to do it all for them.

00:23:04.700 --> 00:23:06.440
And performance
results for developers

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:08.300
have been great,
no matter if you're

00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:10.910
a small developer or
a large developer,

00:23:10.910 --> 00:23:14.630
no matter where you are
in your game life cycle.

00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:18.350
And so let's go ahead and go
through a couple of examples.

00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:22.380
Has anyone heard of the game
Power Pop Bubble Shooter Mania?

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:23.650
No?

00:23:23.650 --> 00:23:24.980
Oh, a couple of people.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:26.490
There we go.

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:29.420
So Ilyon Dynamics is the maker
of the hit game Power Pop

00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.690
Bubble Shooter Mania,
and Ilyon wanted

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:33.952
to acquire new
players for Power Pop,

00:23:33.952 --> 00:23:35.660
and to really increase
the revenue coming

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:40.436
from their in-app purchases
for new players acquired.

00:23:40.436 --> 00:23:42.810
And so when they were looking
to grow their app installs,

00:23:42.810 --> 00:23:46.010
and really increase out their
user base of paying users,

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:50.690
they looked at Google, and
used Universal App Campaigns,

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:54.620
and they found that UAC
delivered higher KPIs almost

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:56.480
across the board.

00:23:56.480 --> 00:24:00.620
In fact, they saw that
the 90-day lifetime

00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:05.270
value of these users was
actually 7.3 times higher,

00:24:05.270 --> 00:24:07.970
and they actually saw
an average revenue

00:24:07.970 --> 00:24:12.800
per user increase of five times
compared to their baseline.

00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.560
In addition, the
day one retention

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.080
from these players that
they acquired through UAC

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.790
was actually 15% higher
than their organic users.

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:26.000
And the beauty of UAC is that
it's completely adaptable

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:29.600
to any game, to your
game, to your players,

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:32.140
and to your business.

00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.360
And so let's just go
through another example.

00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:39.630
Has anyone heard of Marvel's
Contest of Champions here?

00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:40.130
OK.

00:24:40.130 --> 00:24:40.629
Yeah.

00:24:40.629 --> 00:24:42.850
So you can see, this
is a more popular game,

00:24:42.850 --> 00:24:45.380
but we can really help you no
matter how small your game is,

00:24:45.380 --> 00:24:47.070
or how big your game is.

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:48.650
And so Kabam is
an industry leader

00:24:48.650 --> 00:24:51.910
here in massive mobile
multi-player games.

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:54.290
Kabam has accumulated
millions of downloads,

00:24:54.290 --> 00:24:55.260
and you can tell--

00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:57.637
obviously some of you guys
are in this room today

00:24:57.637 --> 00:24:59.720
--and have received awards
such as Apple's Editors

00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:05.070
Choice, and Google Play's
Best Game of the Year.

00:25:05.070 --> 00:25:07.580
And so Kabam came to
us looking to increase

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:10.970
their daily active users for
the role-playing game Marvel's

00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:13.580
Contest of Champions,
and they also

00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:15.100
wanted to extend
their global reach.

00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.850
They didn't want to
just reach one market,

00:25:16.850 --> 00:25:18.830
but they really wanted
to kind of expand

00:25:18.830 --> 00:25:21.680
beyond just their main market.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.130
So they partnered with Google
and UAC to find new players,

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:27.500
and they included video
in their campaigns

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:29.300
to really let the strong
gameplay that they

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:31.910
have speak for itself.

00:25:31.910 --> 00:25:36.110
And by doing so, they grew
their installs six times,

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.680
quarter over quarter,
reaching hundreds of thousands

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.930
of new users.

00:25:41.930 --> 00:25:44.870
And in addition, their
conversion rate actually

00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:48.740
increased 50% year
over year, and UAC

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:53.560
helped drive a 70% improvement
on their target return on ad

00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:54.060
spend.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.840
So how is USC
exactly doing this?

00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.470
How are we helping developers
such as yourselves,

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:05.500
developers such as Kabam,
and developers such as Ilyon?

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:07.060
Well, we're using
machine learning

00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.330
to make the smartest
decision for every single ad

00:26:10.330 --> 00:26:13.960
that we serve,
analyzing hundreds

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:18.370
of millions of potential
combinations in real time,

00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:21.760
finding out where people are
engaging with your ads, which

00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.430
creatives work the best,
which queries are working

00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:28.480
the best, which your users
are actually ultimately doing

00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:31.310
the action that you care
about within your game,

00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:34.930
whether it's purchases, whether
it's reaching a certain level,

00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.840
whether it's just simply
engaging with your game,

00:26:37.840 --> 00:26:41.260
learning about these converting
players to find more of them

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:43.890
over time.

00:26:43.890 --> 00:26:47.850
And I'm really proud to say that
our investments are working.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:51.180
We've recently passed a
really exciting milestone.

00:26:51.180 --> 00:26:57.180
We've now driven over 10 billion
installs to date from our ads.

00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.850
In addition, UAC
is actually helping

00:26:59.850 --> 00:27:04.620
drive over 7 billion
in-app events per quarter,

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.060
like users reaching level 10, or
help making a certain purchase

00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:10.800
within your game.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:14.220
And so we're continuing
to double down on UAC now

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.640
with a lot of new inventions
being built into UAC,

00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:22.110
and to make app promotion
even more effective.

00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:24.660
So I'm going to go ahead and
dive in some of the cool things

00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:27.540
that we're going to
actually be bringing to UAC.

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:30.150
And video is a really
key format by which

00:27:30.150 --> 00:27:32.490
you're able to pique the
interests of your users.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.410
Because after all,
you kind of want

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:37.200
to understand how the game
works before you download it.

00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.850
There are so many
choices out there.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:42.300
How do you know that you're
going to like the game?

00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:45.540
And that's why video ads has
been so successful in driving

00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:48.240
app installs.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:51.510
In addition, we're trying to
unlock even more opportunities

00:27:51.510 --> 00:27:56.490
for us where we can really
show how to find users,

00:27:56.490 --> 00:27:59.550
and show users how
great your game is.

00:27:59.550 --> 00:28:02.430
And one of those great
areas is Google Play.

00:28:02.430 --> 00:28:04.680
More than one
billion people visit

00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:11.020
Google Play each month from over
190 countries around the world.

00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:12.810
It's the place where
users come to develop

00:28:12.810 --> 00:28:16.590
apps and games like the
ones that you all develop.

00:28:16.590 --> 00:28:19.710
And beyond just searching
for new apps to try,

00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:23.250
we're seeing that more and more
users are browsing the Play

00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:25.710
Store, and trying to find
the recommendations that

00:28:25.710 --> 00:28:28.050
come from the Play
Store about which games

00:28:28.050 --> 00:28:31.600
or which apps they should
download and give a shot.

00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:35.970
And so to help users
discover more of your apps,

00:28:35.970 --> 00:28:38.850
and really amplify
your video ads,

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:42.570
we're rolling out a new
beta for our video ads.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.390
And so now we're offering
a new way for you

00:28:45.390 --> 00:28:48.750
to reach your users with your
video ads in Google Play.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.060
And these new placements
will be available

00:28:51.060 --> 00:28:55.620
exclusively through UAC
to help you reach users

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.140
with high-impact
video ads as they

00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:01.410
type, they swipe, and
scroll through all

00:29:01.410 --> 00:29:04.470
the different results in search
of their next new favorite

00:29:04.470 --> 00:29:06.350
game, which hopefully
is yours, right?

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:12.000
And with a world of games
available on mobile,

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.570
it can be hard to know who might
fall in love with your game.

00:29:15.570 --> 00:29:17.430
And it's not just video
ads that will really

00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:19.590
help encourage and
find the right users,

00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:23.730
but we also know that you want
to find users who actually will

00:29:23.730 --> 00:29:26.790
really start to engage, and
do the actions that you care

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:29.880
the most about, like the
ones who are likely to beat

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.910
that first level, get
through a tutorial,

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:35.100
or make an in-app purchase.

00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:39.780
And so we're introducing
Similar Audiences for UAC

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:42.990
to help you find people
who share similar interests

00:29:42.990 --> 00:29:45.630
with the best customers
that you already have,

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.480
and that you already
know about, right when

00:29:48.480 --> 00:29:52.370
they're interested in games
and with apps like yours.

00:29:52.370 --> 00:29:56.490
So imagine that you have
a popular mobile game,

00:29:56.490 --> 00:29:59.340
and you're working on your
next new launch release.

00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:03.030
You actually have a whole
list of users from your games

00:30:03.030 --> 00:30:05.200
that work really well.

00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:07.740
And so you can get
that list to Google,

00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:10.800
and we'll actually be able to
find more players like those

00:30:10.800 --> 00:30:14.290
playing your current game.

00:30:14.290 --> 00:30:17.440
By connecting the
information that you give us

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:20.290
with more qualified
customers, Similar Audiences

00:30:20.290 --> 00:30:23.260
can really help unlock
more of the information

00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:25.690
that you know already
works well for you,

00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:30.490
and really help you grow your
business even more and faster.

00:30:30.490 --> 00:30:33.820
And this will be available to
select advertisers starting

00:30:33.820 --> 00:30:37.535
later this year, in a
couple of months, in May,

00:30:37.535 --> 00:30:41.900
and we're really excited to
see what you all do with this.

00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:43.940
And so now I'm going
to pass it over

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:46.127
to Vishal to tell
you a little bit more

00:30:46.127 --> 00:30:47.960
about how you can earn
more from the players

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.551
that hopefully you
just acquired from UAC.

00:30:50.551 --> 00:30:53.006
[APPLAUSE]

00:31:02.826 --> 00:31:04.720
VISHAL KUMAR: Hi, everyone.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:06.570
My name is Vishal
Kumar, and I am

00:31:06.570 --> 00:31:09.720
a Product Manager at Google on
the Mobile Apps Modernization

00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:10.740
Team.

00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:13.110
My team's goal is
to help developers

00:31:13.110 --> 00:31:15.690
like yourself maximize the
amount of money they make

00:31:15.690 --> 00:31:19.080
from their apps, and to do
this in the most easiest way

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.230
possible.

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:23.040
Today I am here to share some
of the latest and greatest ideas

00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:26.410
and innovations that
our team is working on.

00:31:26.410 --> 00:31:28.270
So let's go ahead and
jump right into it.

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:30.360
I think everybody in
this room has a passion

00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:32.190
for building legendary games.

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:33.720
But to build those
games, you need

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.670
the cash flow to sustain it.

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:39.330
The hard truth is that
not all your players

00:31:39.330 --> 00:31:42.980
are able or willing to
pay for those games.

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.780
And then even those
non-spenders actually

00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.720
need compelling
gaming experiences.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.080
In the last year, we
have seen the explosion

00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:54.840
in the growth of hybrid
models where publishers

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.630
are using ads and
in-app purchases

00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.850
to maximize the
monetization of their games.

00:32:00.850 --> 00:32:04.320
In fact, in the last year
alone mobile gaming apps

00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:08.130
using hybrid models
have seen 50% growth

00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:09.250
on the Google Play Store.

00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:18.850
We believe that by supplementing
your IP-focused games with ads,

00:32:18.850 --> 00:32:21.040
you can actually
engage more players

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:23.540
and reach out to a
larger audience, in fact

00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.210
almost anyone with
a mobile phone.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:29.740
However, one concern that
we hear from publishers

00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:34.510
is that they believe ads might
cannibalize IP purchases.

00:32:34.510 --> 00:32:36.100
We get that.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.460
That's actually why we
released the Prediction Tool

00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:42.970
in our app development
platform, Firebase.

00:32:42.970 --> 00:32:45.970
So what the
predictions that you do

00:32:45.970 --> 00:32:49.250
is segment of players based
on predicted behaviors

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:53.200
into likely spenders
and likely non-spenders.

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.880
That means that you can
show ads to a huge majority

00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:59.710
of your players that are
most likely not going

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:01.840
to spend inside the game.

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.050
This is a huge revenue
opportunity for publishers

00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:06.310
today.

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:08.930
One of our partners,
[? Rockboy ?] Games,

00:33:08.930 --> 00:33:11.860
used the prediction tools to
actually segment their user

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:14.680
base into spenders
and non-spenders,

00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.480
and then they used
this data to create

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:19.330
Play-customized digital
store experiences

00:33:19.330 --> 00:33:21.190
based on the prediction.

00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:24.430
They drove a 25%
increase in revenue

00:33:24.430 --> 00:33:27.265
using the tool and the
different sharing experience.

00:33:30.730 --> 00:33:33.280
So we believe that
ads are a great way

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.230
to monetize your apps.

00:33:35.230 --> 00:33:40.060
However, these ads need to
be of really high quality.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.810
We believe that the best
ad experiences actually

00:33:43.810 --> 00:33:47.650
provide value to users,
value to advertisers

00:33:47.650 --> 00:33:51.370
by delivering engaged users, and
much more revenue for the app

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:52.780
publisher.

00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.380
For the non-spending audience,
it's also really critical

00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.480
to make sure that
we do not sacrifice

00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:00.580
the gameplay experience.

00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:02.500
Because even if they're
not willing to pay

00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.149
with their money,
they are likely

00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:05.440
willing to pay with their time.

00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:14.980
Rewarded ads offer a
non-intrusive opt-in way

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.889
to allow these
large non-spenders

00:34:17.889 --> 00:34:23.739
to engage with an ad and get
something of value in return.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:26.469
Our data shows that
when used correctly,

00:34:26.469 --> 00:34:29.350
these ads can actually
increase playtime

00:34:29.350 --> 00:34:32.830
while ensuring that
publishers get paid.

00:34:32.830 --> 00:34:34.810
As you can see,
some of these users

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:37.565
actually talk about these
ads in the App Store reviews,

00:34:37.565 --> 00:34:38.940
and actually we've
even seen them

00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.310
complain when we pull these
ads from some of the games.

00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:50.020
Of the top 1,000 ad publishers
by revenue, over 40% of them

00:34:50.020 --> 00:34:52.239
are now using rewarded
ads in their games.

00:34:55.929 --> 00:34:59.100
Another benefit we
see is that developers

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.400
who actually start using
rewarded ads in their games

00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.550
actually end up seeing
more engaged users,

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:08.370
because the users actually
appreciate the value

00:35:08.370 --> 00:35:11.190
exchange, which makes
the gameplay more

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:13.350
engaging and rewarding.

00:35:13.350 --> 00:35:17.310
Avidly, one of our publishers
who publishes Bingo Party,

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:20.640
actually saw a 40%
growth in total revenue

00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.310
once they introduced rewarded
ads into their games,

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:28.290
and 20% longer session lengths
due to the increased engagement

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:31.570
from rewarded ads.

00:35:31.570 --> 00:35:33.220
Today I also wanted
to talk to you

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:35.320
about some of the
new experiences

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:38.560
that our team is
releasing in rewarded ads.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:40.390
So on the left-hand
side, we have

00:35:40.390 --> 00:35:42.880
something that we call
the rewarded playable.

00:35:42.880 --> 00:35:46.270
This is kind of like a
try-before-you-buy sort of ad

00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:47.140
format.

00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:49.930
And the other interesting thing
is it actually keeps the player

00:35:49.930 --> 00:35:52.750
inside the gaming
experience so you

00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:56.890
get the maximum
monetization and engagement.

00:35:56.890 --> 00:35:59.110
On the right side we
have something that we

00:35:59.110 --> 00:36:01.570
call multiple rewarded ads.

00:36:01.570 --> 00:36:03.790
In this particular
example, not only

00:36:03.790 --> 00:36:07.090
are you offering the user
the choice to see an ad,

00:36:07.090 --> 00:36:10.390
you're actually offering them
a choice of which ad to see.

00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:12.790
And our data shows
that when you actually

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:15.580
design the format in
this way, users actually

00:36:15.580 --> 00:36:19.460
end up picking an ad that
they have some investment in,

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.490
they end up being more
engaged in the ad,

00:36:21.490 --> 00:36:24.340
and that results in
more conversions.

00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:26.410
These formats have been
designed specifically

00:36:26.410 --> 00:36:28.060
to make sure that
when you do try

00:36:28.060 --> 00:36:31.810
to monetize your non-spenders,
you do not end up sacrificing

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:33.315
the in-game experience.

00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:39.640
Another important
piece of monetization

00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.330
is making sure that you're
optimizing every opportunity

00:36:43.330 --> 00:36:45.010
to own revenue.

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:48.370
And normally this is met
using mediation and working

00:36:48.370 --> 00:36:51.550
with many different
network partners.

00:36:51.550 --> 00:36:54.760
Mediation is a crucial
strategy for our publishers

00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.280
to help them find
niche markets of demand

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:59.470
across geo and format.

00:36:59.470 --> 00:37:02.560
In theory, mediation ensures
that you're getting the highest

00:37:02.560 --> 00:37:05.410
CPM for every impression
by making sure

00:37:05.410 --> 00:37:07.900
that the networks that have
historically offered the best

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:10.810
performance get called
first, and then you

00:37:10.810 --> 00:37:12.820
proceed down a daisy chain.

00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:15.400
But what happens when a
lower-priority network

00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:20.340
is actually willing to pay more
for a particular impression?

00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.730
That's actually where we
believe we can come in and help.

00:37:23.730 --> 00:37:26.550
With the new product
that we just announced,

00:37:26.550 --> 00:37:29.040
which is called
Open Bidding, we now

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.430
take the promise of
monetization to the next level.

00:37:32.430 --> 00:37:34.710
First, we make it
easier than ever

00:37:34.710 --> 00:37:37.170
for you to manage all
your different networks.

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:40.950
Secondly, we help you get
the most value for your ads,

00:37:40.950 --> 00:37:43.980
because with Open Bidding,
all your different partners

00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:47.640
are going to compete for
the inventory simultaneously

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.600
and in real time.

00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.780
Again, our data shows
that when this happens,

00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.930
it drives the performance for
the publisher much higher,

00:37:54.930 --> 00:37:57.750
resulting in much
higher monetization.

00:37:57.750 --> 00:38:00.270
Open Bidding also has
some other benefits

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:02.370
beyond just increased revenue.

00:38:02.370 --> 00:38:07.840
Simplified reporting, and
also potentially reduced

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:11.728
SDKs should help you reduce
your operational expenditure.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.120
Our team is super
excited about continuing

00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.630
to build the tools that
help you grow your business,

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:23.420
grow your revenue, and
grow your audience.

00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:26.210
Since 2012, the AdMob
team has paid out

00:38:26.210 --> 00:38:30.560
over $3.5 billion dollars to
all the different app developers

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:33.590
to help them stay focused
on their mission of creating

00:38:33.590 --> 00:38:36.080
legendary games.

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.080
Now-- so here are some of the
other sessions that we have,

00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:40.400
if you're interested in
anything that you've heard,

00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.608
and you'd like to learn
more, please come talk to me,

00:38:42.608 --> 00:38:44.440
or attend one of our
sessions this week.

00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:46.760
I'm now going to hand it
off to Dave Geffon, who's

00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:49.040
going to talk to you about
building communities,

00:38:49.040 --> 00:38:52.672
and expanding your
reach through YouTube.

00:38:52.672 --> 00:38:54.624
[APPLAUSE]

00:39:04.407 --> 00:39:05.490
DAVE GEFFON: Hi, everyone.

00:39:05.490 --> 00:39:06.940
My name is Dave Geffon.

00:39:06.940 --> 00:39:09.430
I'm the head of the Gaming
Content &amp; Partnerships

00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:11.530
team at YouTube.

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:16.270
And my team's responsible for
the growth of gaming content

00:39:16.270 --> 00:39:18.130
in the Americas for YouTube.

00:39:18.130 --> 00:39:21.070
And what we do is work
with game developers,

00:39:21.070 --> 00:39:26.440
publishers, and creators to help
them succeed on the platform.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:28.420
One of the most common
questions we get

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.610
is just about how to
get started on YouTube.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.290
It's a huge platform.

00:39:32.290 --> 00:39:34.450
I think everyone knows
it's worthy of investment.

00:39:34.450 --> 00:39:37.842
They just don't quite
know where to start.

00:39:37.842 --> 00:39:40.300
So today we're going to talk
about some immediate steps you

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:43.690
can take to succeed
on the platform

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:46.420
that anyone, regardless
of resources and time,

00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:48.830
should be able to do.

00:39:48.830 --> 00:39:51.486
So let's just talk about YouTube
by the numbers for a second.

00:39:51.486 --> 00:39:53.360
We don't need to spend
a ton of time on this.

00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:56.470
I think everyone can universally
recognize that YouTube is

00:39:56.470 --> 00:39:59.530
an absolutely massive platform.

00:39:59.530 --> 00:40:01.180
But you know, just
calling out a couple

00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:02.460
of things that jump out to me.

00:40:02.460 --> 00:40:05.320
So Tubular Labs did
a study recently

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:11.080
where they quantified that more
than 325 billion views in 2017

00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:13.030
coming from YouTube
were marked as gaming--

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:15.980
really huge and really
impressive numbers.

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.360
In a similar study, Newsoo
had over two billion people

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:20.770
playing games globally.

00:40:20.770 --> 00:40:24.160
So a massive total
addressable market.

00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:27.380
So the audience is there,
the demand is there,

00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:29.920
and there's clearly people
engaging with and watching

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:33.920
video content like never before.

00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.820
So what are these things that
you can do to get started?

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:40.330
Really these are tips that
we would give to developers

00:40:40.330 --> 00:40:43.330
or publishers of any size.

00:40:43.330 --> 00:40:48.190
Behind closed doors,
in a session like this,

00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:49.660
there's some really
baseline things

00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:51.040
that you can do to succeed.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.440
The first is to educate
yourself on the platform.

00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.830
You can't succeed unless you
really know what's happening

00:40:56.830 --> 00:40:58.090
and why.

00:40:58.090 --> 00:40:59.500
Create your own content.

00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.330
Establish the tone and
voice for your game

00:41:01.330 --> 00:41:06.070
in your IP on YouTube, and
let your fans follow suit.

00:41:06.070 --> 00:41:08.500
Leverage the tools and tech
that YouTube invests in.

00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.710
We're really invested
in helping people

00:41:11.710 --> 00:41:14.980
create great content on YouTube,
and have a lot of unique tools

00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:16.760
to help that happen.

00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.060
And finally, work with
your biggest fans.

00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:19.850
Collaborate.

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:22.720
Know who your biggest supporters
are, and support them.

00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:28.610
So it goes without saying that
it's really important to have

00:41:28.610 --> 00:41:31.100
a baseline level of
proficiency and knowledge

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:32.970
when it comes to YouTube.

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.070
YouTube has been
around for 13 years.

00:41:35.070 --> 00:41:38.120
The YouTube Creator Academy and
the YouTube Certified programs

00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.600
are amazing educational
resources developed

00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.270
by the YouTube
team to help anyone

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:47.660
from the most basic user to
the most advanced succeed

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.130
on the platform.

00:41:49.130 --> 00:41:52.970
These educational modules cover
things from metadata how-tos,

00:41:52.970 --> 00:41:56.960
like how to use thumbnails
to optimize clicks,

00:41:56.960 --> 00:42:00.620
all the way up to content
rights, copyright claiming,

00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:02.340
and so forth.

00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.490
You don't need to become
an expert overnight,

00:42:04.490 --> 00:42:06.924
but as you're getting started,
if you have a question

00:42:06.924 --> 00:42:08.340
and you are looking
for an answer,

00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:09.830
this is a really
good place to be.

00:42:12.695 --> 00:42:15.070
And I think one thing that's
really important to mention,

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:17.710
and one thing that we don't
see a lot of at times,

00:42:17.710 --> 00:42:19.630
is the follow-through
and commitment

00:42:19.630 --> 00:42:22.300
to refreshing your knowledge
and understanding how

00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:24.160
the platform changes.

00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:26.860
One really easy and quick
tip that we offer people

00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.320
is to follow the Creator
Academy on YouTube.

00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:32.080
They often will publish
videos and how-tos

00:42:32.080 --> 00:42:35.040
on some of the biggest
issues changing on YouTube,

00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:37.270
and it's a really great
way to casually keep

00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:40.550
track of what's happening, and
decide what matters to you.

00:42:40.550 --> 00:42:44.590
Again, the platform is changing,
and what you knew 12 months ago

00:42:44.590 --> 00:42:45.920
may not be relevant today.

00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:48.100
So stay up to date in your
understanding of what's

00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.190
going on the platform.

00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:54.090
The most obvious
and the biggest one

00:42:54.090 --> 00:42:59.610
is to create what you view
as exemplar content of videos

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.590
around your game.

00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:03.360
It gives you the
opportunity to set

00:43:03.360 --> 00:43:07.200
the tone, the voice, the
style, and how you want your IP

00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.550
to be perceived.

00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:09.450
Is it irreverent?

00:43:09.450 --> 00:43:10.770
Is it comedic?

00:43:10.770 --> 00:43:12.450
Is it more serious?

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:14.860
That's only for you to decide.

00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:17.310
And if you look at partners
like Seriously, who've

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:19.490
been so committed to
doing this with their Best

00:43:19.490 --> 00:43:21.990
Fiends franchise,
there's no question

00:43:21.990 --> 00:43:24.510
as to what they
want their IP to be.

00:43:24.510 --> 00:43:27.270
And you see on every
piece of content

00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:29.085
that they create
on the platform.

00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:35.650
And that's really borne out
of this idea of consistency.

00:43:35.650 --> 00:43:37.840
There's no shortcuts
to success on YouTube.

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:39.110
There's no silver bullet.

00:43:39.110 --> 00:43:41.120
It's about hard work
and consistency,

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:45.490
and doing that's going to give
you the best chance to succeed.

00:43:45.490 --> 00:43:49.570
Miniclip is a great example that
we point to that consistency

00:43:49.570 --> 00:43:51.040
just pays off.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:56.200
They created their own
great content around Agario,

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:59.440
they collaborated with fans,
they featured different pieces

00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.100
of content that created
variety on their channel,

00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:04.240
and their fans responded.

00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:07.180
They actually achieved more
than one million subscribers

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:10.671
in less than a year, which is
a phenomenal and tremendous

00:44:10.671 --> 00:44:11.170
effort.

00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.310
And how they did that,
they leveraged tools.

00:44:16.310 --> 00:44:17.810
And this is something
that everybody

00:44:17.810 --> 00:44:20.190
should be doing on YouTube.

00:44:20.190 --> 00:44:24.320
Google is primarily known as
a engineering-first culture,

00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.820
and we build great tools.

00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.540
We build great tech
to help you succeed.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:32.600
One example, especially for game
developers and publishers just

00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:36.090
getting started on the platform,
is using the new Community tab.

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:38.240
And what the Community
tab allows you to do

00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:40.940
is bring content that
is non-video gaming

00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:44.292
content into your subscriber
feed for your channel

00:44:44.292 --> 00:44:46.250
to engage with your
audience while you're still

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:49.560
developing video content
for the first time.

00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:53.180
So imagine yourself engaging
with your audience with a poll.

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:55.570
What new video content
would you like to see?

00:44:55.570 --> 00:44:58.370
Or a static image releasing
a new champion or hero

00:44:58.370 --> 00:44:59.540
into your game.

00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.490
It takes some of the
pressure off of you

00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:03.461
when you're just
getting started,

00:45:03.461 --> 00:45:05.210
and it's something
that we are seeing fans

00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:08.750
engaging with all the time.

00:45:08.750 --> 00:45:11.420
Two other big
products that we think

00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:15.350
are super-relevant for mobile
developers are cards and end

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:16.280
cards.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.106
So cards are
something that you can

00:45:18.106 --> 00:45:19.730
include into the
middle of a video that

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:22.070
lets you track an action.

00:45:22.070 --> 00:45:25.400
In this case, you know, Rovio
is doing a great job using cards

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:29.810
to redirect interested users
from their Angry Birds 2

00:45:29.810 --> 00:45:32.300
trailer to the Google
Play Store to measure

00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.970
the effectiveness
of their videos

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:36.950
and understand how
this is performing

00:45:36.950 --> 00:45:38.750
as an install channel.

00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:41.810
They can follow that up with
things like end cards, that

00:45:41.810 --> 00:45:45.680
allows you to cross-promote and
continue getting users engaged

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:48.680
with content on your channel
that's relevant to them.

00:45:48.680 --> 00:45:50.240
The tools, the tech is there.

00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:54.610
Just understanding how to
use them is really key.

00:45:54.610 --> 00:45:56.550
Finally, collaborate
with your fans.

00:45:56.550 --> 00:45:58.470
Know who your biggest
supporters are,

00:45:58.470 --> 00:46:01.410
recognize them, and
support their content.

00:46:01.410 --> 00:46:03.690
Supercell is a
developer who we've

00:46:03.690 --> 00:46:06.480
seen do an amazing job working
with their biggest supporters

00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.510
and creators to help
supplement their content,

00:46:09.510 --> 00:46:11.820
be part of the narrative
and part of the process

00:46:11.820 --> 00:46:14.210
of their biggest
moments for their games,

00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:17.190
whether it's Clash of
Clans and a new Town Hall

00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:21.090
update, or Clash
Royale, and a new card.

00:46:21.090 --> 00:46:23.610
Having your fans
involved is a great way

00:46:23.610 --> 00:46:26.760
to ensure authenticity,
but a unique tone and voice

00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:31.170
that only that they can
bring to your games.

00:46:31.170 --> 00:46:33.050
And one really
obvious one is just

00:46:33.050 --> 00:46:35.850
support and recognize the
fans in your community.

00:46:35.850 --> 00:46:38.340
It goes a long way.

00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.340
The people who are creating
content around games

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:42.860
are doing so because
they love these games,

00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.360
first and foremost.

00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:45.890
And recognizing
their contribution

00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:47.750
to the community,
and what they've

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:51.110
done to help your games,
can go a long, long way.

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:55.490
So pulling it all together.

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:59.450
Think about education as
the baseline and foundation

00:46:59.450 --> 00:47:01.220
for your YouTube experience.

00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:04.457
The more familiar you are with
the inner workings of YouTube,

00:47:04.457 --> 00:47:05.915
the more likely
you are to succeed.

00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:13.910
Second, create your own content.

00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:18.440
Take the time to establish what
your games and what your IP

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.210
should be on YouTube.

00:47:20.210 --> 00:47:22.460
Show your community,
show your fans

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.580
that this is what excellence
with your games looks like

00:47:25.580 --> 00:47:28.630
and represents.

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:29.960
Collaborate with fans.

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:34.210
Just work with them to bring
their passion to the forefront,

00:47:34.210 --> 00:47:37.150
and recognize it
on your channel.

00:47:37.150 --> 00:47:40.780
And finally, leverage the tech
and tools that we make that

00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:43.480
will help you reach
more fans, succeed,

00:47:43.480 --> 00:47:48.230
and share a greater level
of success on the platform.

00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:50.750
Thank you very
much, and I would--

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:51.250
sorry.

00:47:51.250 --> 00:47:52.103
Go ahead.

00:47:52.103 --> 00:47:57.706
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:57.706 --> 00:47:59.080
Now that that's
out of the way, I

00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:02.535
want to welcome up Toshi
from Bandai Namco, who's

00:48:02.535 --> 00:48:04.660
been doing some really
interesting work with Google

00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:06.668
Cloud, and he'd love
to share it with you.

00:48:06.668 --> 00:48:07.624
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:09.679 --> 00:48:10.970
TOSHITAKA TACHIBANA: Thank you.

00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:16.672
All right.

00:48:16.672 --> 00:48:17.380
Hello, everybody.

00:48:17.380 --> 00:48:18.540
Good evening, or afternoon--

00:48:18.540 --> 00:48:19.720
I can't tell what
time it is right now.

00:48:19.720 --> 00:48:20.220
I'm sorry.

00:48:24.225 --> 00:48:25.350
KEIGO IKEDA: Hi, I'm Keigo.

00:48:25.350 --> 00:48:27.411
[NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]

00:48:27.411 --> 00:48:29.160
TOSHITAKA TACHIBANA:
And my name is Toshi.

00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:31.500
I'm also part of the Dragon
Ball app Produce Team,

00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.510
and I'll be doing
most of the talking,

00:48:33.510 --> 00:48:36.510
as, fortunately for my
job, Keigo can't exactly

00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:38.430
talk in English.

00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:39.660
So-- I'm sorry.

00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.400
He understands it, though.

00:48:41.400 --> 00:48:43.230
So, Moving on.

00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:45.780
Just before starting on into
the presentation itself,

00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.890
I want to talk a little
bit about our company.

00:48:47.890 --> 00:48:49.620
We-- Bandai Namco
Entertainment--

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:54.660
create video games, ranging from
console, to PC, to mobile apps,

00:48:54.660 --> 00:48:56.560
as you can see on
the screen right now.

00:48:56.560 --> 00:49:00.420
And most of our games actually
are based on Japanese IPs.

00:49:00.420 --> 00:49:04.680
So examples would be Dragon
Ball, One Piece, Idol Master,

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:06.150
Sword Art Online, Naruto--

00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:08.370
I can just keep going
on and on and on.

00:49:08.370 --> 00:49:11.190
But maybe some of you have seen
it, some of you have played it.

00:49:11.190 --> 00:49:14.130
But today that's not what we're
really here to talk about.

00:49:14.130 --> 00:49:16.680
Today we're actually here
to talk about something

00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:18.590
new, something I'm
really-- both of us,

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:20.740
Keigo and I --are really
excited to talk about.

00:49:20.740 --> 00:49:23.700
It's a new PVP game,
and actually we've

00:49:23.700 --> 00:49:26.760
never released any
new information

00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.840
regarding this until now.

00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.840
So you guys are the first to
see anything about this game.

00:49:30.840 --> 00:49:36.270
So without further ado, I
give you Dragon Ball Legends.

00:49:36.270 --> 00:49:40.020
It's an all-new
title of mobile app

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:41.850
that will be released in 2018.

00:49:41.850 --> 00:49:43.580
And as you can
see on the screen,

00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:47.340
the game play will be in
3D, heavily action-oriented,

00:49:47.340 --> 00:49:50.280
and also we're pretty excited
to talk about it today.

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:53.940
We made sure that the details
and everything are all fine

00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:57.450
tuned so that it's exactly
what the Dragon Ball

00:49:57.450 --> 00:50:00.266
fans wanted on a mobile app.

00:50:00.266 --> 00:50:02.640
So one of the biggest features
that we have for this game

00:50:02.640 --> 00:50:05.760
actually is the global real
time player-versus-player

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:07.470
on cloud network.

00:50:07.470 --> 00:50:09.040
So let me say that
one more time.

00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.940
It's global, it's real
time, and it is actually

00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:13.060
player-versus-player.

00:50:13.060 --> 00:50:16.530
It's-- we're not going to
muck around with by providing

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:19.230
pseudo-experiences of
player-versus-player where

00:50:19.230 --> 00:50:21.030
players fight other player data.

00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:22.350
It's not going to be like that.

00:50:22.350 --> 00:50:24.330
We'll actually have
the players be fighting

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:27.480
one-on-one, anywhere, anytime.

00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:31.009
So you know what, to give you
a really good idea as to what

00:50:31.009 --> 00:50:32.550
it will be like,
we're actually going

00:50:32.550 --> 00:50:36.180
to have a live demonstration
between two points.

00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.970
And point A being here,
Moscone Center, where Keigo

00:50:38.970 --> 00:50:41.940
will be playing against another
team member of ours that

00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.400
is currently in Japan--

00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:45.600
our Tokyo
headquarters, actually.

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.220
So I just copy and pasted
the Google map, actually,

00:50:49.220 --> 00:50:53.210
but you as you can see,
there's 5,100 miles apart.

00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:55.780
Yeah, that's [? Ayaka, ?]
one of our team members.

00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:58.440
And so she's currently
in Tokyo right now.

00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:01.990
The right screen is
her mobile app screen.

00:51:01.990 --> 00:51:03.330
Left screen is Keigo's.

00:51:03.330 --> 00:51:05.010
And I would appreciate
it if the audio

00:51:05.010 --> 00:51:07.710
was played in the background
a little bit louder.

00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:08.730
Yes, thank you.

00:51:08.730 --> 00:51:12.160
OK, so the game
itself is one-on-one,

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:15.810
but each player can bring up
to three playable characters.

00:51:15.810 --> 00:51:18.960
The objective of the game is
to defeat the opponent's three

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:22.310
characters before the opponent.

00:51:22.310 --> 00:51:24.210
All right, and
they're both ready.

00:51:24.210 --> 00:51:27.660
So thanks to Google's
Cloud Networking,

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:30.960
we managed to create a
really stable playing field

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.930
where users don't really need to
worry about internet connection

00:51:33.930 --> 00:51:35.130
latency and whatnot.

00:51:35.130 --> 00:51:37.020
All they need to worry
about is the opponent

00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:40.200
that's going to be in front
of them on the screen.

00:51:40.200 --> 00:51:40.770
All right.

00:51:40.770 --> 00:51:43.360
It seems like the
game connected.

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.394
And it's still black.

00:51:44.394 --> 00:51:45.060
Oh, there we go.

00:51:45.060 --> 00:51:45.742
Thank God.

00:51:45.742 --> 00:51:46.506
[AUDIO PLAYBACK]

00:51:46.506 --> 00:51:47.339
- You can't beat me.

00:51:48.042 --> 00:51:50.250
TOSHITAKA TACHIBANA: So the
game's started right now.

00:51:50.250 --> 00:51:51.900
Left screen is Keigo.

00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:56.130
He will probably show off
some of the cool cut scenes

00:51:56.130 --> 00:51:59.530
that each character has, but
it's heavily action-oriented.

00:51:59.530 --> 00:52:02.100
But in actuality, the
controls are quite simple.

00:52:02.100 --> 00:52:03.510
He made sure that
it's intuitive,

00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:05.760
and we made sure
that everybody who

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:08.070
wants an action
game on Dragon Ball

00:52:08.070 --> 00:52:11.010
can play other players without
having to worry about getting

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:13.210
their butt handed to them.

00:52:13.210 --> 00:52:16.010
So as you can see,
[? Ayaka ?] just

00:52:16.010 --> 00:52:17.610
activated her special skill.

00:52:17.610 --> 00:52:20.070
The four cards that can
be seen on the bottom

00:52:20.070 --> 00:52:23.160
of the screen, those
are universal cards

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.750
that each player has.

00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:26.520
And whenever you tap
them, the character

00:52:26.520 --> 00:52:30.810
will automatically do an action
oriented to that specific card.

00:52:30.810 --> 00:52:33.060
And each character will
have something different.

00:52:33.060 --> 00:52:34.860
For example, you
tap the red card,

00:52:34.860 --> 00:52:36.570
you can do a melee attack.

00:52:36.570 --> 00:52:38.970
You tap the yellow card,
you can do a long ranged,

00:52:38.970 --> 00:52:41.280
and the blue one is
a special attack.

00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.840
And also by tapping
them consecutively,

00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:46.920
the character will
automatically create combos.

00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:49.260
So just like right
now, actually.

00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:51.010
It's a special cut
scene right now.

00:52:51.010 --> 00:52:56.130
And it looks really complex
when you first see it, honestly.

00:52:56.130 --> 00:52:58.575
But-- oh my God.

00:52:58.575 --> 00:53:00.000
[APPLAUSE]

00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:00.950
[LAUGHS]

00:53:03.770 --> 00:53:04.270
Yeah, see.

00:53:04.270 --> 00:53:05.110
She had no choice.

00:53:05.110 --> 00:53:06.483
He's her boss.

00:53:06.483 --> 00:53:08.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:08.850 --> 00:53:09.580
All right.

00:53:09.580 --> 00:53:11.361
Back to the
presentation, please.

00:53:11.361 --> 00:53:11.860
All right.

00:53:11.860 --> 00:53:12.110
Thank you.

00:53:12.110 --> 00:53:12.880
[END PLAYBACK]

00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:19.070
So as you can see,
the game itself

00:53:19.070 --> 00:53:22.430
runs actually fairly smoothly,
even though the connection

00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:25.310
was done over the ocean.

00:53:25.310 --> 00:53:28.280
Players who are outside the
country that you're living in

00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:30.770
can obviously definitely
fight against you

00:53:30.770 --> 00:53:34.850
with no worries about latency--
any problems in network lag

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:37.580
or whatsoever, thanks to
the Google Cloud platform.

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:41.150
Honestly, we could not have
realized this entire project

00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:42.475
without this service.

00:53:42.475 --> 00:53:43.850
And also, as for
the second point

00:53:43.850 --> 00:53:46.520
as to why we used GCP,
this entire title,

00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:49.400
this is going to be a flagship
title of sorts for us.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:54.020
It's going to be on a whole new
level of just entire bigness.

00:53:54.020 --> 00:53:57.380
So we know that there's going to
be an immense amount of traffic

00:53:57.380 --> 00:53:58.166
coming in.

00:53:58.166 --> 00:53:59.540
And the bigger
the traffic is, we

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:02.150
need to make sure that the
infrastructure can handle it--

00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:04.640
more database, more
sharding, and whatnot.

00:54:04.640 --> 00:54:07.490
And the bigger the system
gets, the more complex it gets.

00:54:07.490 --> 00:54:09.950
And inevitably
leading to higher--

00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:13.580
just human error, and
higher chance of human error

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:16.550
happening, and higher cost
for taking care of it.

00:54:16.550 --> 00:54:18.782
And when we have
a title like this

00:54:18.782 --> 00:54:20.240
where we have
hundreds of thousands

00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:22.620
of users constantly
playing against each other,

00:54:22.620 --> 00:54:24.200
we want to make sure
that they always

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:27.840
have the right experience,
and that we prepared for them.

00:54:27.840 --> 00:54:31.400
So in order to do that, we
utilized the Cloud Spanner

00:54:31.400 --> 00:54:33.770
to create a more
simpler architecture,

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.480
so that we don't
really need to worry

00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:38.930
too much about human error
happening, or other costs that

00:54:38.930 --> 00:54:40.400
might happen.

00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:43.340
So another thing that
we use that GCP for

00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:45.702
is Stackdriver
logging and BigQuery.

00:54:45.702 --> 00:54:47.660
Like you might have heard
a couple minutes ago,

00:54:47.660 --> 00:54:49.850
we want to record
literally everything.

00:54:49.850 --> 00:54:53.360
We want to make sure that we can
see what the users are doing,

00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:55.910
and the key performance
indicators are used properly,

00:54:55.910 --> 00:55:00.020
so that we can create a constant
content update where users have

00:55:00.020 --> 00:55:01.850
something new to do,
users have something

00:55:01.850 --> 00:55:05.720
to come back to, maybe every
other day, hopefully every day.

00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:11.580
But we want to create a content
that's constantly evolving.

00:55:11.580 --> 00:55:13.120
So this is an
architecture diagram

00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:17.210
of that we're going to be
using for this project.

00:55:17.210 --> 00:55:19.370
Who here can read this?

00:55:19.370 --> 00:55:20.810
Hands up.

00:55:20.810 --> 00:55:22.160
Yeah, I can't.

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:25.020
But I know what Keigo
told me to talk about.

00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:28.540
So this is basically just
an idea of the architecture

00:55:28.540 --> 00:55:29.860
diagram where--

00:55:29.860 --> 00:55:32.040
how the user connects
to the administrator.

00:55:32.040 --> 00:55:35.480
But in the end, we are
going to be providing

00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:38.580
this service as one big server.

00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:41.360
We're not going to be
separating by regions or areas

00:55:41.360 --> 00:55:44.990
like you might see in
certain large ARP MMORPGs,

00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:46.490
because that would
then kind of lose

00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:49.879
the point of having a global
PVP system to begin with.

00:55:49.879 --> 00:55:51.920
We want to make sure that
every fighter can fight

00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:54.086
on the fighter that's on
the other side of the world

00:55:54.086 --> 00:55:56.960
anytime they want, so that they
can just gloat and literally

00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:00.640
say that they are the best.

00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:05.530
So to reiterate, the GCP was
essential in this project.

00:56:05.530 --> 00:56:10.300
We could not have done this
player-versus-player connection

00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:13.570
where you don't really need to
worry about the game play being

00:56:13.570 --> 00:56:16.060
affected by network
lags and such,

00:56:16.060 --> 00:56:18.940
even if you're connecting
to a character player that's

00:56:18.940 --> 00:56:20.440
on the other side of the world.

00:56:20.440 --> 00:56:23.560
And also, we wanted to
make sure that we create

00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:27.820
a constant contact update
with actual quality,

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:30.040
and provide something
the users wanted--

00:56:30.040 --> 00:56:31.690
or maybe didn't even
know they wanted

00:56:31.690 --> 00:56:33.400
--but were satisfied with.

00:56:33.400 --> 00:56:36.370
So we need to make sure that we
record everything, and provide

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:39.400
for a proper
large-scale service.

00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:41.770
And of course, we
just want to make sure

00:56:41.770 --> 00:56:44.980
that every fighter just
deserves a solid connection.

00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:47.230
They only need to focus on
the enemy in front of them.

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:51.430
They don't need to worry about
the extra connection issues

00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:52.570
or technical difficulties.

00:56:52.570 --> 00:56:54.790
They just need to
figure out how hard they

00:56:54.790 --> 00:56:57.420
need to punch the other person.

00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:00.950
So before we end
this presentation,

00:57:00.950 --> 00:57:03.470
I actually have a bit
of a shameless promotion

00:57:03.470 --> 00:57:05.630
that I want to talk
to you guys about.

00:57:05.630 --> 00:57:11.240
Tomorrow, 10:30 AM,
we'll be holding

00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.880
a livestream where
we'll be announcing

00:57:13.880 --> 00:57:16.070
a lot more details
regarding this game title,

00:57:16.070 --> 00:57:17.870
such as other playable
characters-- you

00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:21.470
might have seen Goku, or
Piccolo, Frieza, and Napa.

00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:24.200
We have loads more that we
want to definitely talk about.

00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:26.060
Unfortunately, I barely
have any time left.

00:57:26.060 --> 00:57:30.380
So you guys hopefully access
this livestream tomorrow.

00:57:30.380 --> 00:57:32.300
We'll I also have
Miles Ward joining us

00:57:32.300 --> 00:57:35.429
as a special guest from
Google Cloud Solutions,

00:57:35.429 --> 00:57:37.970
and he'll be talking a bit more
about the technology that was

00:57:37.970 --> 00:57:42.650
used to make this product work.

00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:44.810
So, thank you for listening.

00:57:44.810 --> 00:57:48.530
Keigo will be saying goodbyes.

00:57:48.530 --> 00:57:50.090
KEIGO IKEDA: Thank
you for listening.

00:57:50.090 --> 00:57:53.750
We hope that we can be a
new benchmark in global PVP.

00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:54.630
Thank you.

00:57:54.630 --> 00:57:57.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:04.400
TOSHITAKA TACHIBANA: So
next up, we have Nico to--

00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:04.919
I'm sorry.

00:58:04.919 --> 00:58:05.960
That's not the right one.

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:09.080
King-- the next
presentation is from King.

00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:30.810
STEFAN FREYR: Hello.

00:58:30.810 --> 00:58:32.340
My name is Stefan Freyr.

00:58:32.340 --> 00:58:36.720
I'm the Research Lead at King.

00:58:36.720 --> 00:58:38.970
And I'm going to
tell you about how

00:58:38.970 --> 00:58:42.510
we were able to increase
the speed of play testing

00:58:42.510 --> 00:58:46.230
with deep learning
from about seven days

00:58:46.230 --> 00:58:49.100
to seven minutes using
Google Cloud Platform.

00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:02.630
First of all, so this
is where we operate.

00:59:02.630 --> 00:59:06.500
We're a mobile game,
and King is most famous

00:59:06.500 --> 00:59:08.720
for Candy Crush, of course.

00:59:08.720 --> 00:59:14.040
And Candy Crush has been able to
stay on top for five years now,

00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:19.456
which is pretty
unusual in this market.

00:59:19.456 --> 00:59:21.080
There are many reasons
for this, but we

00:59:21.080 --> 00:59:23.840
think one of the main
reasons is that we have been

00:59:23.840 --> 00:59:28.590
very data-driven from day one.

00:59:28.590 --> 00:59:33.170
Today, we run hundreds of A/B
tests in our games per year,

00:59:33.170 --> 00:59:35.720
and we do that in an
automated framework.

00:59:35.720 --> 00:59:38.030
And we realize how
important it is

00:59:38.030 --> 00:59:40.310
to have this kind of
automated framework

00:59:40.310 --> 00:59:43.196
where we can have a very fast
iteration loop of what we do,

00:59:43.196 --> 00:59:44.570
and I'll come back
to that later.

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:50.030
The agenda for the
talk is simple.

00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:54.170
I'll just explain our
problem with play testing,

00:59:54.170 --> 00:59:56.720
and present our
solution, and how that

00:59:56.720 --> 01:00:01.310
connects with Google
Cloud Platform.

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:06.110
Here are a few examples of what
we do within our team, AI R&amp;D

01:00:06.110 --> 01:00:07.670
team King.

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:11.570
And the problem I'm
presenting is the top one,

01:00:11.570 --> 01:00:14.300
creating convolutional
neural network bots

01:00:14.300 --> 01:00:17.810
for automatic play testing.

01:00:17.810 --> 01:00:19.250
First of all, what
is Candy Crush?

01:00:19.250 --> 01:00:22.160
I'm assuming that most
of you have played it

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.600
or understand the gameplay.

01:00:23.600 --> 01:00:25.744
If you haven't,
just download it.

01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:33.150
So game specifics-- the
game is not deterministic.

01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:36.750
There are random
elements in the game.

01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:38.180
It has a lot of
[INAUDIBLE] space,

01:00:38.180 --> 01:00:41.480
and today we have more
than 3,000 unique levels

01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:43.850
in the game.

01:00:43.850 --> 01:00:48.860
Every week, we send out 15
new levels to our players.

01:00:48.860 --> 01:00:51.950
That means that
our level designers

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:54.380
have to be very fast and
very creative to come up

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.390
with new levels every week.

01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:59.090
What they have to think
about is- for example,

01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:01.560
this --they have to think
about the looks of the level.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.400
It has to look good--

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:06.910
symmetry, things like that.

01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:09.752
There is a strategic element
in most of the levels.

01:01:09.752 --> 01:01:11.210
Here is an example
of a level where

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:14.870
you have a lot of blockers in
the lower part of the board,

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:18.320
where it is almost impossible to
make any movements or actions,

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:19.820
and the strategy
for this level is

01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:21.920
to try to break down
to the lower levels

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.140
as fast as possible.

01:01:24.140 --> 01:01:26.480
But one of the
most important part

01:01:26.480 --> 01:01:28.430
that level designers
have to think about

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:30.297
is the balancing of the level.

01:01:30.297 --> 01:01:31.130
What does that mean?

01:01:35.470 --> 01:01:40.820
It means that the level cannot
be too easy, too trivial,

01:01:40.820 --> 01:01:42.114
and it is no--

01:01:42.114 --> 01:01:44.280
there's no challenge, no
stimulation for the player,

01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.190
and it cannot be too hard,
because then there is no

01:01:47.190 --> 01:01:49.870
feeling of reward
you feel every time.

01:01:49.870 --> 01:01:52.950
So it's extremely important
to get the right balance

01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:56.640
of difficulty of finding
the just-right difficulty

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:58.950
for a level.

01:01:58.950 --> 01:02:01.270
So how do we do that?

01:02:01.270 --> 01:02:04.020
This is what we used to do.

01:02:04.020 --> 01:02:08.490
We have level designers think
about the level of creation.

01:02:08.490 --> 01:02:11.130
That takes time-- all
these three elements

01:02:11.130 --> 01:02:13.140
that I mentioned
before --and then

01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:16.560
you send it out for
human play testing.

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.660
And that took seven days.

01:02:21.360 --> 01:02:26.140
So seven days later, we get a
feedback from the play testers,

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:30.220
and they tell us for
the new 15 levels,

01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:32.590
for example, Level 3
and 4, they're too easy;

01:02:32.590 --> 01:02:37.000
level 15 is too difficult. And
the only thing we can do that

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:40.480
is tweak these three
levels, and ship the episode

01:02:40.480 --> 01:02:42.830
with 15 levels.

01:02:42.830 --> 01:02:46.930
So we have no guarantee for the
sort of just-right measurement.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:50.110
We only know that we were
able to improve, hopefully,

01:02:50.110 --> 01:02:52.840
Levels 3, 4, and 15.

01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:56.240
We would like to improve this.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.940
And that's our problem.

01:02:57.940 --> 01:03:00.022
And you can see that
at least seven days--

01:03:00.022 --> 01:03:01.480
probably a little
bit more --taking

01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.418
the time of the level designers,
is taken in just balancing.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.440
So how can we
improve play testing?

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:15.170
How can we improve the speed
of play testing, accuracy,

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:17.020
everything?

01:03:17.020 --> 01:03:20.880
With the recent breakthrough
in AI and games,

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.150
we thought, OK,
maybe we can build

01:03:23.150 --> 01:03:28.310
a bot that can play like a
human-- imitate human play.

01:03:28.310 --> 01:03:30.320
So this is an
interesting AI problem,

01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:33.950
because everything
we've heard so far

01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:37.430
would suggest that we should
build Alpha Candy Zero,

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:39.320
the best Candy player ever.

01:03:39.320 --> 01:03:40.470
But that's not the problem.

01:03:40.470 --> 01:03:44.360
We want to find an AI bot that
can play the game in the most

01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:47.210
human-like way.

01:03:47.210 --> 01:03:48.620
So what did we do?

01:03:51.330 --> 01:03:52.580
We started gathering data.

01:03:52.580 --> 01:03:55.040
That's always the first step.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.690
We tracked data from players.

01:03:56.690 --> 01:03:58.760
We tracked the
state action pair.

01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.010
For every action
they could take,

01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:02.860
we recorded everything
in the level,

01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:06.710
the home state, and
the action taken.

01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:09.180
This we can fit--

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:11.700
we tracked a bunch of this
data from all of our players

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:13.600
over some time period.

01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:17.400
And then we can fit that into
a convolutional neural network,

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:22.840
which is the usual approach
for image recognition.

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:25.950
And we can train a
supervised policy network

01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:28.080
based on this, a
network that can

01:04:28.080 --> 01:04:31.170
learn from the input,
the state, and predict

01:04:31.170 --> 01:04:37.710
the most common human
move in that position.

01:04:37.710 --> 01:04:39.990
And what we do
when we have this,

01:04:39.990 --> 01:04:42.090
then we can use
this policy network

01:04:42.090 --> 01:04:44.760
that plays like a human.

01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:48.070
We can upload that
to some cloud,

01:04:48.070 --> 01:04:49.920
and let it play the game--

01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.490
the new content of the game
--the new levels several times

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:55.873
to give us estimate of the
difficulty of new levels.

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:03.710
So can we have a video here?

01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:09.380
So on the right, we see the
bot playing the same level

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:12.170
I showed you before.

01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:15.680
On top left, we see
the communication.

01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:21.110
So the agent playing the
level sends the state

01:05:21.110 --> 01:05:23.930
to a policy network that
gives back, OK, I think

01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:25.070
you should play this move.

01:05:25.070 --> 01:05:27.830
It's the most human
move in the position.

01:05:27.830 --> 01:05:31.090
And the bottom left, we show
the tracking-- actually now,

01:05:31.090 --> 01:05:35.010
we're tracking the bot instead
of the humans as we did.

01:05:35.010 --> 01:05:39.950
And you see that the bot
is playing quite well

01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:41.470
in this level.

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:45.070
And we tried these levels
ourselves a few times.

01:05:45.070 --> 01:05:50.640
And the bot was actually better
than some of us in the team.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.340
This was very
interesting, but normal

01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:59.099
if we believe that it is
learning the actual play.

01:05:59.099 --> 01:06:00.890
And it was able to
solve the level in this.

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:02.788
If you go back to the slides.

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:19.450
And so this is the framework we
had in Google Cloud Platform.

01:06:19.450 --> 01:06:23.260
And I said I wanted to come back
to the setup we had for our A/B

01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:27.010
test framework, where
we learned that it

01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:30.340
was so important to
have a framework that

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:34.860
can work fast and reliably,
and give fast iteration loops.

01:06:34.860 --> 01:06:38.590
That is exactly the problem
we had with our play testing

01:06:38.590 --> 01:06:40.210
solution.

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:42.850
In this era of AI
and machine learning,

01:06:42.850 --> 01:06:46.540
it's rather easy to come
up with interesting ideas

01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.730
to improve your business--

01:06:48.730 --> 01:06:50.957
improve your processes
--but then you're

01:06:50.957 --> 01:06:51.790
left with something.

01:06:51.790 --> 01:06:53.510
You have a proof of concept.

01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:56.020
You have a test environment.

01:06:56.020 --> 01:06:58.930
But it's not creating real
value for the business

01:06:58.930 --> 01:07:03.640
until it's a production,
a product which

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.540
is scalable, and stable, and
all these things that you need.

01:07:10.790 --> 01:07:14.690
And we realized that we
were a rather small team.

01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:17.020
We had this test
environment where everybody

01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.630
was fighting for resources--

01:07:19.630 --> 01:07:21.280
different games
than Candy Crush.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.260
We wanted to test out more.

01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:24.430
So we had to move it.

01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:26.260
We moved it to Google
Cloud Platform,

01:07:26.260 --> 01:07:32.510
and it was surprisingly
easy and surprisingly fast.

01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:34.776
So this is the setup we have.

01:07:34.776 --> 01:07:37.360
I don't have a pointer on this.

01:07:37.360 --> 01:07:40.450
You can see on the
top right that's

01:07:40.450 --> 01:07:43.520
the UI for the level designers.

01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:48.160
Then we have an API service
that talks to the Google Cloud

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:51.070
Platform, where we
have cloud Pub/Sub,

01:07:51.070 --> 01:07:57.490
and cloud data flow to sort of
plan and distribute the work.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:05.380
The game engine agent
lives in Kubernetes,

01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:08.230
where we can have
hundreds of agents playing

01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:12.070
the game, basically working
as hundreds of play testers,

01:08:12.070 --> 01:08:18.550
and they communicate with the
model serving with the policy

01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:20.819
network that feeds
back the suggested

01:08:20.819 --> 01:08:23.300
human moves in each position.

01:08:23.300 --> 01:08:25.699
So that's how we
can sort of evaluate

01:08:25.699 --> 01:08:27.990
the difficulty of newer levels
with this kind of setup.

01:08:31.450 --> 01:08:32.020
OK.

01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:34.180
So what does it mean
for our business?

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:40.300
Before, we had this,
and now we have

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:42.760
something like this,
where the level

01:08:42.760 --> 01:08:45.970
designers are able to have
very fast iteration loops.

01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:50.819
And as I said before, that is
the key to value for business.

01:08:50.819 --> 01:08:52.420
The value for
business is not being

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:54.620
able to prove that
there is a solution.

01:08:54.620 --> 01:08:57.960
It's being able to create
the solution very fast.

01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:01.660
So level designers are now
able to iterate on their level

01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:04.180
design.

01:09:04.180 --> 01:09:07.830
And what used to take up to
seven days of play testing

01:09:07.830 --> 01:09:10.899
takes now about seven minutes.

01:09:10.899 --> 01:09:15.010
And this allows level
designers to focus

01:09:15.010 --> 01:09:18.399
more on innovation and creation,
and being creative instead

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:20.920
of focusing on the balance.

01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:23.520
They can just test
that very quickly.

01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:28.600
And we're hoping that this will
help Candy Crush and our games

01:09:28.600 --> 01:09:31.969
to stay on top for at
least another five years.

01:09:31.969 --> 01:09:33.929
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:35.890 --> 01:09:37.042
Why do you laugh?

01:09:37.042 --> 01:09:39.407
[LAUGHTER]

01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:42.620
OK.

01:09:45.300 --> 01:09:47.410
End my talk, and
I'll hand it over

01:09:47.410 --> 01:09:51.590
to Kacey, who will
wrap up the day.

01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:52.220
Thank you.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.645
[APPLAUSE]

01:09:58.395 --> 01:09:59.540
KACEY FAHEY: Hi, everyone.

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:02.260
I'm Kacey Fahey, and I focus
on Games Developer Marketing

01:10:02.260 --> 01:10:03.141
at Google Play.

01:10:03.141 --> 01:10:05.390
I want to say a quick thank
you so much for coming out

01:10:05.390 --> 01:10:07.634
to the Developer
Day today, and we

01:10:07.634 --> 01:10:09.050
hope you walk away
with excitement

01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:10.841
about some of the
announcements we've made,

01:10:10.841 --> 01:10:13.220
and lots of tips and actionable
takeaways that you can go

01:10:13.220 --> 01:10:16.110
continue to build amazing
games that you guys do.

01:10:16.110 --> 01:10:18.110
Seriously, they keep us
so busy, and it's so fun

01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:20.560
that this is our job
to play your games.

01:10:20.560 --> 01:10:23.430
Two quick pieces of information
up on the screen here.

01:10:23.430 --> 01:10:25.940
If you don't mind, we've built
a mobile-friendly, very short

01:10:25.940 --> 01:10:29.450
survey that should take no more
than two minutes of your time.

01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:31.672
And we literally go through
every piece of feedback.

01:10:31.672 --> 01:10:34.130
So this is what helps us build
the better content each year

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:35.370
after year.

01:10:35.370 --> 01:10:38.150
So either hop on your
phones, or jot it down,

01:10:38.150 --> 01:10:42.710
but goo.fl/gdc2018.

01:10:42.710 --> 01:10:45.640
And secondly, later in the
week, Wednesday through Friday,

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:49.390
stopped by Moscone South
at the Google booth,

01:10:49.390 --> 01:10:52.310
where you can hear more Google
Talks, see product demos,

01:10:52.310 --> 01:10:54.410
and any questions you may
have come up with today,

01:10:54.410 --> 01:10:56.630
there's an Ask the Experts desk.

01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:59.480
So that's it for today,
and have a great GDC.

01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:00.680
Thank you.

01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:04.030
