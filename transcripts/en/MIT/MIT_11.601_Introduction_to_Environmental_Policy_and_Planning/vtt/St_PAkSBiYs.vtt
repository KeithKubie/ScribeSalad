00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.990
GUEST SPEAKER: I
convened this meeting

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.823
because I believe that
the review is limited

00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:14.104
as it stands now.

00:00:14.104 --> 00:00:16.270
And in order for the
Environmental Impact Assessment

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.920
to be effective, it
needs to consider

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.530
a number of other
alternatives in order

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.110
to provide a larger scope
for the project impacts,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.160
both positive and negative.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.450
The draft Environmental Impact
Assessment, as it stands now,

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.480
considers the
number of turbines,

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.700
the location of the
turbines, and a very limited

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.530
no-build option.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.040
This alternatives
analysis fails to create

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.050
a clear vision of the
situational context

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.530
of the project.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.584
In this presentation,
I will be discussing

00:00:44.584 --> 00:00:46.750
ways in which we can revise
the Environmental Impact

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.239
Assessment so that it better
evaluates all alternatives

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.780
and I will provide arguments
for why it is necessary to spend

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.270
the time and money to do so.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.350
First, we need to define
the goal of the project

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.790
if we are to
effectively evaluate

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.420
alternative approaches.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.130
Alternatives
analysis should paint

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.400
a picture of the
multitude of options

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.202
available to reach this goal.

00:01:08.202 --> 00:01:09.910
So I believe that the
goal of the project

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.130
is to provide energy for
the growing electricity

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.670
demand in the region.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.900
And studies have shown that
new energy facilities will

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.360
need to be built within
the next 15 years

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.080
to meet this growing demand.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.090
So we should use this goal to
frame to project evaluation.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.250
And sending a clear
goal at the beginning

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.690
helps to consider
better alternatives.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.060
And it's necessary
to take a step back

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.810
and to see the project and its
impacts in the larger context.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.770
So if we all agree to this, that
the goal is to meet the growing

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.350
electricity demand, we must
determine that this product

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:45.180
is the best option.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.870
And the Environmental
Impact Assessment

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.400
is the way that we'll do that.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.820
So to do this, we need to
make three major revisions

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.550
to the Environmental
Impact Assessment.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.100
One, we need to consider
alternative forms

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.240
of energy production
and their environmental,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.030
economic, and social impacts if
this plant is not to be build.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:06.340
So if we do not
build offshore wind,

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.240
we would build
wind farms on land.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.400
And what will the land
use impacts of that be?

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.490
Will we need to build a natural
gas plant to meet demand,

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.240
or is solar an option?

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.460
So we need to really consider
the greater alternatives.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.020
It will be difficult to do
a full Environmental Impact

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.720
Assessment of all of these
theoretical alternatives.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.660
We can pick a few items to
focus on, for instance, carbon

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.530
emissions or land use.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.040
Second, we need to consider
the impacts of wildlife

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.540
and coastal communities
based on cumulative impacts,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.930
if this project isn't built and
other clean energy products are

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.200
not built and we're not meeting
our greenhouse gas emission

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.290
targets.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.630
Third, if this
project is perhaps

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.300
the best way to meet
our energy needs,

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.290
then we need to consider
alternative ways

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.620
to mitigate the impacts from
this project on wildlife

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:01.315
and navigation.

00:03:01.315 --> 00:03:04.630
Some mitigation
efforts could include

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.980
moving the wind farm further
offshore or presenting--

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.110
providing better
long term monitoring.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.747
So including all of
these alternatives

00:03:13.747 --> 00:03:15.330
in the more comprehensive
alternatives

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.030
analysis will lead to
two major benefits.

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.050
One, it will increase the
opportunity for public buy-in

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.925
by making a more
transparent process.

00:03:24.925 --> 00:03:26.800
This is really important
for complex problems

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.170
like energy development.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.200
And by including a more
comprehensive analysis,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.570
or alternatives
analysis, the project

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.420
will be less likely
to be fought later on.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.550
Because the public will
be better able to use

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:43.600
this document to see the
decision-making process.

00:03:47.081 --> 00:03:49.580
The public will see that the
Environmental Impact Assessment

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.190
did not just consider the
impacts of the proposed

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.330
pre-design project that
was already going to happen

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:57.490
but will see it in
a greater context

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.590
of the different
alternatives that

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.320
were considered along the way.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.410
This will, while spending
this money upfront,

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:08.500
it will be expensive to do
all of these extra studies,

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.110
it will be important in
saving money down the pipeline

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.971
in delays and litigation.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.720
And second, because there
is not much precedent

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.944
for Environmental Impact
Assessments of offshore wind

00:04:21.944 --> 00:04:24.890
in the United States,
we have the opportunity

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.520
to set the standards
for evaluation.

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.860
This project will
set best practices,

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.620
so let's make them
best practices

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.990
and establish mitigation and
monitoring practices as well as

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.770
the robust alternatives
analysis that I proposed.

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.080
Again, we should, we
should be sure to engage

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.560
the public around
this alternatives

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.700
analysis during the review
of this draft, the comments

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.160
on this draft Environmental
Impact Assessment,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.930
so that there's public buy-in
and support of the project

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.880
and that the public understands
what alternative options would

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.530
look like.

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:04.770
So finally, we need to recognize
that, internally as the EPA,

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.115
that Environmental Impact
Assessments are not

00:05:07.115 --> 00:05:11.030
unbiased and purely scientific,
but that they operate

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:12.900
within a political framework.

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.610
So because of this and
because of our recent decision

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.670
to limit greenhouse gas
emissions in power plants,

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.320
we need to create
a better framework

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.620
for analyzing alternative
energy projects

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.620
and present a better
framework for analyzing

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.430
all of those impacts and risks.

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.730
We cannot encourage clean energy
development at a great cost

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.171
to local ecosystems.

00:05:36.171 --> 00:05:37.670
But we must create
a system in which

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:43.370
a sound case for wind generation
can be made, including--

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.340
So this, by doing this,
we need to examine,

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.710
have an assessment that
examines all other options,

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.180
including meeting energy
needs from less clean sources.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.130
So for these
reasons, I recommend

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.770
revising the draft
Environment Impact Assessment

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.050
to include these comments.

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:00.900
Thank you.
