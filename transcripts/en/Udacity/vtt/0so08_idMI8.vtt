00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
This next assignment deals with primitive roots.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Your task will be to implement a function, primitive&lt;u&gt;roots,&lt;/u&gt;

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
that takes in a small prime number and outputs a list of all the primitive roots of that number.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
In the ide, in addition to primitive roots, we have provided a modular exponentiation function

00:00:18.000 --> 99:59:59.000
similar to what was used in lecture and two simple test cases to use.
