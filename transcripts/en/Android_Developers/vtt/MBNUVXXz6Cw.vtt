RICHARD: Hi.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.860
Good afternoon, and welcome to
our interview with the GPDC

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.970
team, also known as the
Google Play Developer

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.760
Console Preview team.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.540
Today we're joined in our lovely
Hangout little room

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.102
here with Ricardo and
Max and Ellie and--

00:00:24.102 --> 00:00:24.506
PIERRE: Pierre.

00:00:24.506 --> 00:00:26.146
RICHARD: Pierre.

00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:29.930
Slightly awkward moment as I
don't know Pierre's name.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.409
And of course we're here to
discuss the brand new Google

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:34.560
Play Developer Console Preview,
which hopefully

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.400
you've had a good chance to try
out, see the new features

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.720
through the awesome new UI.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.965
I'll leave you in the capable
hands of Max, I think, to

00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:43.340
start with.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.662
He's going to run through
some demos for us

00:00:46.662 --> 00:00:47.530
of all the new features.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.710
ELLIE: So really quickly before
we jump into demos, I

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.370
guess wanted to just make sure
you all know why we built a

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.660
new developer console.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.320
Big reasons we've gotten from it
was, you guys are using the

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.530
developer console more and
more to update your

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.370
applications.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.300
You're really growing
your businesses.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.500
And we had a bunch of features
we want to be able to add in

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.440
the future.

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.070
And we wanted to give you
a great user experience.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.400
So that was the motivation
for doing it.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.910
And so this year at Google I/O
we announced and demoed the

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.380
new developer console.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:15.860
And then last week, you all got

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.390
access, as Richard mentioned.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.370
So we wanted to say that what
we have here is a preview.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.730
It's not totally done yet.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.330
I'm sure many of you have found
things that you'd like

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.120
to see improved before
we consider it done.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.140
And there are a couple
of features we

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.360
haven't released yet.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.000
But we also hope that you'll
see this as kind of a

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.410
foundation and a platform
for more things to come.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.590
So we really welcome all of your
feedback about how we can

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.090
continue to improve it.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.626
So Max is going to walk us
through what we have in the

00:01:40.626 --> 00:01:41.240
preview today.

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.120
MAX: Cool.

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:47.400
Richard, can we make my screen
visible for everyone?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.232
RICHARD: Of course we can.

00:01:49.232 --> 00:01:50.730
MAX: Perfect.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.780
Here we go.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.900
You may remember the demo at
the Google I/O. So you may

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.050
remember this app.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.880
So basically that's the
Start page if you

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.190
arrive on the new page.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.780
And you see the handy Developer
Guide, which got

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.370
published during the
demo at Google I/O.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.090
So you start with the store
listing with the most

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.870
important information
about your app.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.830
What's interesting is with the
new page, we now support up to

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:26.740
49 localized information.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:34.748
So for instance, let's try to
add some German to that app.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.970
We still call it the handy
Developer Guide.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:03:02.860
And you can add description
and so on and so forth.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.980
We can save and publish
Drive guests.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.270
We should get an
error for that.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.010
You see, we also tried to give
you way better information.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.790
If you do something wrong, what
you did wrong, what you

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.820
should do to fix that.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:22.310
But let's see.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.560
Let's fix it.

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.815
ELLIE: It's not a very
interesting app, is it?

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.450
So one of the other things that
you'll notice, like Max

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.350
mentioned, is you have up to 49
languages, which is a lot

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.530
more than we had before.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.620
We have some languages like UK
English and Turkish that we

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.000
didn't have before.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.440
And another thing that you'll
also notice, it's kind of an

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.690
invisible feature.

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.560
For listings where you don't
provide a manual translation

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.210
or a human translation, we'll
create an automated

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:00.990
translation using Google
Translate behind the scenes.

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.470
And then users who are
encountering your store

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.990
listing, if it's not in their
native language, once you've

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.020
saved it to the new developer
console, they'll actually see

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:11.270
a button allowing them to view
an automated translation.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.080
So just to be clear, the
automated translations are

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:15.590
generated by Google Translate.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:17.335
And so they're obviously not
going to be as good as having

00:04:17.335 --> 00:04:19.620
a native speaker of German,
like Max, creating the

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.959
translation.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.790
But until such time as you're
able to get the servicers of a

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.160
professional translator, they
certainly will go a long way.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.140
And you don't have to do
anything to make the automated

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.370
translations happen.

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:33.290
Once you've saved your app to
the new developer console,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.980
they'll happen behind
the scenes.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:37.250
And you can go ahead and update
the default language as

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:40.820
often as you want, and the
automated translations will

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.160
update automatically.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.320
This is a change from the old
developer console, wherein you

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.990
used to have to select an
automated translation for each

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:50.630
language where you wanted one.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:52.740
And then they didn't
update properly.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:55.990
So here it all happens behind
the scenes as soon as you've

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:58.282
saved your app in
the new console.

00:04:58.282 --> 00:05:00.790
MAX: We've seen, usually,
German is too long.

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:06.200
So we leave it here in
the original title.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.660
OK.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.140
We've saved these changes.

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.120
Let's have a look
into the other--

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.950
I have to click that
obviously.

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.415
RICHARD: And you get the
little running Android.

00:05:15.415 --> 00:05:17.770
MAX: Yeah, the running Android
is one of the best parts of

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.620
the new app.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.320
ELLIE: I think that was the most
popular feature with our

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.006
Developer Relations team.

00:05:22.006 --> 00:05:22.980
They really liked the
running Android.

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:24.420
MAX: We love it.

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.020
Some kind of progress is
always nice, right?

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:27.600
ELLIE: Yeah, exactly.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.760
And it's just cute.

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.810
I think it's cute.

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:35.900
MAX: So yeah, the list of
countries where you can

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.665
publish your app.

00:05:36.665 --> 00:05:39.090
Obviously if you have a paid
app, you see and can set the

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:41.520
prices here.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.670
This app has no inner
products.

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.310
Let's look into the
APK screen.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.640
Again, we tried to give you as
much information as we can

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.030
give you on that page.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.220
And see like the supported
devices, I think this is a

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:01.630
great way to go through Earth
through the devices to see

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.290
where your app is working
or where not.

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:06.340
Or even If you even want to
exclude devices because

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.040
there's certain handsets where
you have problems.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:13.420
You can add that here as well.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:18.650
And obviously if you have
an update, you can

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.740
upload new APK here.

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.470
And you see the changes.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:28.400
So for instance, we have now
localized information for

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.800
German in the app.

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.480
I think it's pretty good here
because you may unfortunately

00:06:37.480 --> 00:06:40.720
use the wrong APK to upload
or something like that.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.210
And you get immediately the
information of what changed.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.310
So we want to just give you as
much information as we can

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:52.340
give you to prevent any mistakes
from your side.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.046
Let's have a look
into statistics.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.560
Same statistics.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.330
We will see some more on
a different tab soon.

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:06.520
We have all of these different
dimensions.

00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.370
If you're ever in doubt what it
exactly means, there's the

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.870
handy tool to give you details
about the differences between

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.250
active and total devices
and users.

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:19.550
I think once you get used to
it, you know what it means.

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:21.890
And it's just, again, great.

00:07:21.890 --> 00:07:24.320
We want to give you, just
repeat myself, as much

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:24.840
information.

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:29.200
And we will let the decision for
you to what you actually

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.990
want and how you
want to use it.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.300
The new crashes overview
is also pretty cool.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.120
So we have a bunch of filters.

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.920
And you can go through
the stack traces.

00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:54.550
And you also might have that
visible on the last report

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:58.420
here on that part, if you can
see the mouse pointer.

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:03.080
We also jump through the
details of everything.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:05.460
ELLIE: Yes, this is when I
forgot that grid layout didn't

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:06.790
exist in older versions.

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:08.510
That was a good lesson for me.

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:11.010
MAX: Happens.

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:12.260
And as well, the
user messages.

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.995
Hopefully they will give useful
information, like how

00:08:19.995 --> 00:08:22.900
it exactly happened.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.860
Let's jump into one of Rich's
apps, where we have pretty

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:30.250
cool ratings.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.490
Because it's an awesome
app, obviously.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.344
RICHARD: Ultimate Stopwatch.

00:08:36.344 --> 00:08:39.650
MAX: It's a new dimension
just recently added.

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:42.730
Ricardo, maybe you can say
a bit more about that.

00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:45.150
RICARDO: Yeah, we use it to
display basically how your

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:46.680
ratings have evolved
over time.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:49.330
Because often that's an
interesting method to keep

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.450
track of, to measure
user satisfaction.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:55.920
And we offer you basically
two new metrics.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.080
One is the cumulative
average rating.

00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:01.740
And it tells you basically the
average of all the ratings

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:04.060
that your application has
gathered over time.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:09.010
And this is exactly what you see
also in the storefront on

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:12.390
play.google.com of the actual
rating that the

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:14.280
user has given you.

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.430
And so basically, the last point
in the chart that says

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:22.150
that we have a rating of 4.35
should match what you see on

00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:24.060
the storefront above the
rating that your

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:25.515
app currently has.

00:09:25.515 --> 00:09:28.055
The extra information that you
get here, in addition to the

00:09:28.055 --> 00:09:31.040
history over the time of this
rating, is the breakdown by

00:09:31.040 --> 00:09:33.510
all the usual dimensions that
you're already used to from

00:09:33.510 --> 00:09:35.190
the other metrics
that we offer.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.530
So for example, you could see
by, I don't know, how the

00:09:38.530 --> 00:09:40.540
rating is divided by device.

00:09:40.540 --> 00:09:44.440
And you can see maybe that some
users from given devices

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:46.770
give you a lower rating
than other users.

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.135
And maybe this is indicative
that you have not optimized

00:09:49.135 --> 00:09:51.210
your application for
a given device.

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:53.800
Maybe it uses a different screen
size, and you have not

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:54.790
really optimized for that.

00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:59.260
So the user experience
is less optimal.

00:09:59.260 --> 00:10:02.570
By language as well, maybe you
have not optimized your

00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:04.110
application for a
given language.

00:10:04.110 --> 00:10:05.090
You have not localized.

00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:06.840
So your user rated poorly.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:09.310
And another interesting one
is by application version.

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:14.400
Because you can see by rolling
out new version whether people

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:15.710
like it more or not.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:18.680
And maybe your new version is
not as good as you thought,

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:21.650
and you want to do some fixes
and change it again.

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:26.090
If the cumulative average rating
over time provides a

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:28.570
too broad metric, because it
accumulates all the rating

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:33.600
even from last versions, even
from previous, if you have

00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:35.620
been out for a long time,
previous months, previous

00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:38.790
years, then you can switch to
the daily average rating,

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:41.850
which is exactly the same metric
but aggregated over a

00:10:41.850 --> 00:10:43.220
daily basis.

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.455
And this gives you a much more
granular information about how

00:10:46.455 --> 00:10:51.310
on each day uses are rating
your application.

00:10:51.310 --> 00:10:57.120
And again, depending on how many
users you have, you may

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:00.130
have various [? interactive ?]
information that shows you on

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:03.810
a particular day what is the
average rating that your

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:04.700
application got.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:07.150
And this gives you much more
detailed information.

00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:09.790
For example, when you want to
closely track how a new launch

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.280
is happening, how a new
launch is going.

00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:16.630
And as usual, you can always
export this metric, just like

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:17.240
all the others.

00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:21.440
So if you want to do your own
custom aggregations on your

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.200
site by merging together other
data sources, you can get a

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.410
full breakdown in CSP
format as well.

00:11:28.410 --> 00:11:30.673
So you can proceed from there.

00:11:30.673 --> 00:11:31.820
RICHARD: That's absolutely
excellent.

00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.450
I didn't know the
ratings trending

00:11:34.450 --> 00:11:36.163
existed inside the reporting.

00:11:36.163 --> 00:11:38.460
Has that been in the stats since
the new stats were in?

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:41.745
ELLIE: No, this is actually a
launch last Monday with the

00:11:41.745 --> 00:11:44.520
new developer console preview.

00:11:44.520 --> 00:11:46.240
RICHARD: Well, I'm sure
to make use of that.

00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:48.440
I'm working on an update to the
Ultimate Stopwatch anyway.

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.840
It's likely we'll be able to
see the trending app as--

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.960
ELLIE: I was noticing on your
stats, actually, that for your

00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:56.300
latest version, that had an
actually better user rating

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:57.080
than the other versions.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.670
I'm not sure if you knew
that, but your update

00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:59.607
really was an update.

00:11:59.607 --> 00:12:00.381
It was a good update.

00:12:00.381 --> 00:12:02.110
MAX: And I know you're working
on tablet support.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.960
So you can see which devices are
rating it higher, if the

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.570
tablets are now liking
it more.

00:12:06.570 --> 00:12:09.480
ELLIE: That's true, you can see
if the Nexus 7 users are

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:09.950
enjoying that one.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:11.520
MAX: That's brilliant.

00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:13.490
RICARDO: And on this case,
you maybe should work on

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:15.640
localization for Portuguese.

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:17.265
ELLIE: You're not very happy.

00:12:17.265 --> 00:12:18.130
RICHARD: Can you just
do that for me now?

00:12:18.130 --> 00:12:18.510
Just press the--

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:19.590
MAX: I don't know.

00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:20.600
I can help you with German.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:22.635
RICHARD: No, the automatic
translation--

00:12:22.635 --> 00:12:23.340
MAX: Oh, yeah, that's right.

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:24.920
ELLIE: The automatic
translations are just for the

00:12:24.920 --> 00:12:25.780
store listing.

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.030
That's not actually for
the applications.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.300
Or maybe Portuguese users are
just more unhappy than the

00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.920
Dutch users, I'm not sure.

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.430
MAX: Talking writing in reviews,
actually, forgot to

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.570
show that page as well,
to give you an

00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:46.020
overview about the ratings.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:49.300
But as we just encountered, the
greater overview and the

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.610
details are on the
statistics page.

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.220
And our products are also part
of the developer console.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.930
Some of you had early access,
but that's now as well live.

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:04.070
So if you want to add
a new product--

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:12.320
there's a typo.

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.750
Want to fix that, because you
can't do it otherwise

00:13:14.750 --> 00:13:16.000
afterwards.

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:22.160
Manage product.

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.750
And again, it looks pretty
similar to the store listing

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:29.590
page for your main app.

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.700
We didn't want to confuse you
with too many different

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:33.960
widgets and so on.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.890
You can add all of your
information here, as you're

00:13:42.890 --> 00:13:46.100
used to from your store listing,
obviously just what

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:51.330
is required for inner
products.

00:13:51.330 --> 00:13:54.640
And easy, just do the
auto convert.

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:57.750
You may want to check the
detailed prices, because

00:13:57.750 --> 00:14:01.100
guessing euro maybe 2.49
sounds a bit better.

00:14:01.100 --> 00:14:04.840
But again, want to give you
the tools so you can do

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:08.020
everything easily.

00:14:08.020 --> 00:14:09.340
It's sometimes a
bit difficult.

00:14:09.340 --> 00:14:10.400
But we always try.

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:15.570
We know some of you developers
have full time jobs.

00:14:15.570 --> 00:14:17.245
And you love to develop
for Android and

00:14:17.245 --> 00:14:17.820
do that on the side.

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.270
And we try to support you in the
same way as we do it for

00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:22.520
big developers.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:27.560
But as we said, we are happy
to get some feedback today

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:30.110
from all backgrounds
of developers.

00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:32.420
So let us know if you have
any wishes or ideas.

00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.820
And we're more than happy to
discuss that, and maybe even

00:14:35.820 --> 00:14:37.086
do it in the end.

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:44.360
We have also the service in
APIs here, if you, for

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.690
instance, use Google Talk
messaging, you can

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:49.400
configure that here.

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:52.630
And I think that's
basically format.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:54.612
I'm not sure Ricardo
has anything else?

00:14:54.612 --> 00:14:56.220
RICARDO: That's pretty
much it.

00:14:56.220 --> 00:14:56.510
ELLIE: Yeah.

00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:58.070
We hope you all give it a try.

00:14:58.070 --> 00:15:00.420
And one other thing to point out
if you haven't noticed it

00:15:00.420 --> 00:15:04.240
is the gigantic orange link that
say, give us feedback, in

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:06.210
the upper right hand corner.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:08.000
We read all that feedback
personally.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.860
And although we're not able to
respond to every message that

00:15:10.860 --> 00:15:12.910
we get, we do keep it all in
mind when we're planning

00:15:12.910 --> 00:15:13.670
future updates.

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:16.733
So please click on it, let us
know what you think, and tell

00:15:16.733 --> 00:15:18.155
your friends.

00:15:18.155 --> 00:15:19.640
RICHARD: Thank you very much.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.270
Excellent.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:22.560
Some good stats.

00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:24.310
And the fact that I've learned
something is also kind of

00:15:24.310 --> 00:15:24.930
handy, too.

00:15:24.930 --> 00:15:28.640
Is the trending ratings the
only new statistic?

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.150
Is there anything else
I would've missed?

00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:33.300
ELLIE: No, those are the new
ones that we launched with the

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:33.810
open preview.

00:15:33.810 --> 00:15:36.070
So we definitely see that as
a great way to identify

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.410
opportunities to improve your
app, and to also see, every

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.530
time you release a new version,
did it actually

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:42.510
improve what your users
think about you.

00:15:42.510 --> 00:15:44.860
RICHARD: Hopefully it does.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:48.100
ELLIE: That's always the goal.

00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.995
MAX: Leave it on, maybe we want
to switch back, but I

00:15:50.995 --> 00:15:52.666
think we can.

00:15:52.666 --> 00:15:53.470
RICHARD: OK.

00:15:53.470 --> 00:15:54.980
Hello, everybody.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.670
So we have some questions
in the moderator.

00:15:56.670 --> 00:15:58.930
But if you're thinking of
joining the Hangout and asking

00:15:58.930 --> 00:16:04.650
the GPDC team something live,
now's a good time to jump in.

00:16:04.650 --> 00:16:07.880
And we'll get you lined up
to ask the questions.

00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.180
Also, you can comment on
the G+ post for this.

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:13.760
And we'll be reading
those as well.

00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.330
So do you have something
from the moderator?

00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.326
NICK: Yeah, I can dive in to
the moderator questions.

00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.480
Before we go into the questions,
I think it's best

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.340
to reiterate, as we always say
on our developer Hangouts,

00:16:29.340 --> 00:16:31.720
that we're not going to
be making any product

00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:32.460
announcements here.

00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:34.195
We're going to be discussing
your comments and feedback.

00:16:34.195 --> 00:16:38.310
But any questions of, when will
X launch, when will I get

00:16:38.310 --> 00:16:40.560
feature Y, that we're not
going to be able to talk

00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:41.420
about, I'm afraid.

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.125
So I think the best way to
direct the conversation is to

00:16:44.125 --> 00:16:46.090
give us constructive feedback of
what you like, and what you

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:47.320
would like to see more
of from the team.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:51.030
But asking for launch
dates, not so much.

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:54.020
So with that in mind, when
will it be possible to

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:56.200
moderate comments on
applications, is I guess one

00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.752
of these forward-looking
statements we're not going to

00:16:58.752 --> 00:17:00.790
really get into, like we said.

00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.480
ELLIE: Well, I guess what we
can say so far is that we

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.339
realize that this was a really
important feature for

00:17:05.339 --> 00:17:05.734
developers.

00:17:05.734 --> 00:17:09.099
So we wanted to get it out there
as soon as possible.

00:17:09.099 --> 00:17:11.470
We've definitely heard very
strong feedback from a lot of

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.510
developers who don't have access
yet that they do want

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:14.300
to have access.

00:17:14.300 --> 00:17:16.550
So we hear that you want
to have the access.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.500
But we're still trying to make
sure that the feature's

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:21.460
working exactly as it should
for developers and users.

00:17:21.460 --> 00:17:23.369
And hopefully, we'll
be able to roll it

00:17:23.369 --> 00:17:24.280
out more in the future.

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:26.290
But as Nick mentioned, we
can't really make any

00:17:26.290 --> 00:17:28.440
announcements in this meeting.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.830
NICK: So the next question
is again asking

00:17:30.830 --> 00:17:32.540
for when will X happen.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:35.310
But I'm going to rephrase
it into feedback.

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:40.300
Cicero in France asks, he says
that his screen shots and

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.645
feature promo graphics at the
moment come out slightly

00:17:42.645 --> 00:17:44.240
blurry due to compression.

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:46.560
And so I'm going to rephrase
that to, are we aware of this?

00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:49.182
And are we looking into this?

00:17:49.182 --> 00:17:51.050
RICARDO: Yes, we are.

00:17:51.050 --> 00:17:53.525
So we're aware that in the
process in some cases, the

00:17:53.525 --> 00:17:56.440
screen shot maybe got resized
in a way that--

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.260
NICK: So we compress it on
our end to save space.

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:58.460
RICARDO: Yeah.

00:17:58.460 --> 00:18:01.360
We do some optimizations
for serving as well.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:04.181
And so yes, we're
aware of that.

00:18:04.181 --> 00:18:04.670
NICK: OK.

00:18:04.670 --> 00:18:07.322
So watch your space,
essentially.

00:18:07.322 --> 00:18:08.690
RICHARD: OK.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:10.982
We've got someone joining
us in the Hangout.

00:18:10.982 --> 00:18:12.960
MALE SPEAKER: Yes,
one small thing.

00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:17.960
You said that you posted on the
YouTube channel to go to

00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:19.920
the link in the description.

00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.170
There is no link in
the description.

00:18:23.660 --> 00:18:26.450
I was trying to put something in
the moderator, but I don't

00:18:26.450 --> 00:18:27.580
have a link in the
description.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:29.640
NICK: Apparently if you
try hitting refresh?

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.430
MALE SPEAKER: I have.

00:18:30.430 --> 00:18:33.100
And I've closed the page
and reloaded it.

00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:34.486
Still nothing.

00:18:34.486 --> 00:18:35.410
RICHARD: All right.

00:18:35.410 --> 00:18:35.872
Let me take a look.

00:18:35.872 --> 00:18:36.800
I'll try to fix that for you.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:39.360
We've got a [INAUDIBLE]

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:41.750
engineer extraordinaire from the
mountain view office has

00:18:41.750 --> 00:18:45.250
kindly dialed in live.

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:48.060
You might've seen his face
appear in the bottom corner.

00:18:48.060 --> 00:18:49.481
So hopefully we can get
that sorted out

00:18:49.481 --> 00:18:51.934
for you pretty instantly.

00:18:51.934 --> 00:18:55.405
NICK: Next question from the
moderator, Oren in Israel

00:18:55.405 --> 00:18:59.772
asks, how can I delete or
hide an unpublished app?

00:18:59.772 --> 00:19:02.590
ELLIE: Well, that is something
that has gotten nearly as many

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:05.130
requests as being able
to reply to reviews.

00:19:05.130 --> 00:19:08.160
I think it's something that
we're looking into.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.330
Nothing to announce
at this point.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:10.910
But thanks for that feedback.

00:19:10.910 --> 00:19:12.760
We've definitely heard from
developers that they want a

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:14.630
way to kind of de-clutter
their interface.

00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:16.685
Some people only have one or two
apps and they don't have

00:19:16.685 --> 00:19:17.050
this problem.

00:19:17.050 --> 00:19:19.720
But some people have
all sorts of apps.

00:19:19.720 --> 00:19:21.510
And at some point they decide
that they don't want to

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:23.250
maintain that app anymore.

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:25.040
Or they've created it by
accident, and they'd

00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:26.090
like to remove it.

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:28.030
So yeah, thanks for
that feedback.

00:19:28.030 --> 00:19:29.884
RICHARD: Am I right in thinking
you can delete an app

00:19:29.884 --> 00:19:31.762
if it's never been published?

00:19:31.762 --> 00:19:34.270
ELLIE: Not in the new site.

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.090
It hasn't been implemented
yet.

00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:36.980
Like I said, totally
not finished yet.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.870
This is one of the things we
haven't implemented yet.

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.160
RICHARD: So the thing to do
would be to create a second

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.540
Android in front of a console
account, and then use the app

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:44.890
transfer to transfer
all your apps.

00:19:44.890 --> 00:19:45.710
ELLIE: No!

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:46.530
Just ignore it!

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.000
Just ignore it for now.

00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:51.160
Sorry it's a bit cluttered.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.000
RICHARD: Yeah.

00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.092
It'll sort itself out.

00:19:54.092 --> 00:19:55.342
[INAUDIBLE].

00:19:57.112 --> 00:20:02.560
NICK: Next question, so Nikolai
in Tokyo, he's asking,

00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:06.030
are there any plans to publish
an API for app statistics?

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:09.460
So I guess we're not going
to comment on future

00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:10.450
plans and so on.

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.360
But I guess we could fit that
into feedback, that he would

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:14.490
love to see some
statistics API.

00:20:14.490 --> 00:20:16.970
So I guess that would be nice
for automating your own

00:20:16.970 --> 00:20:18.400
reporting mechanisms.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.200
ELLIE: Yeah, definitely.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:21.430
In the meantime, you can
use the CSV export.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:22.850
But thanks for that feedback.

00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:24.990
RICHARD: So we have heard that
feedback I think more than

00:20:24.990 --> 00:20:25.535
once already.

00:20:25.535 --> 00:20:26.960
ELLIE: Many times, yeah.

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.700
RICARDO: CSV is obviously not
as powerful as an API.

00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:34.796
But it is the easiest form to
get access to those data.

00:20:34.796 --> 00:20:38.860
And it's a bit hard to discover,
but CSV also include

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:42.650
more complete breakdown than
the other metrics.

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:44.660
On this interface, you
see only the top 10.

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:46.770
But if you get the CSV, for
example, you get the full list

00:20:46.770 --> 00:20:49.590
of devices, if you are looking
at device dimension.

00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:50.900
And so you can do more complete

00:20:50.900 --> 00:20:51.810
analysis by using that.

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:54.440
NICK: So definitely worth going
into that CSV if you

00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:55.880
haven't tried it yet.

00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:57.520
And just rely on the
top 10 graphs.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.920
RICARDO: We have heard
the requests about

00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:00.140
more complete APIs.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:01.850
NICK: Cool, awesome.

00:21:01.850 --> 00:21:05.300
Next request is obviously, user
X is loving the new dev

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:08.530
console so much he wants the
choice to be sticky rather

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:11.830
than having to opt
in every time.

00:21:11.830 --> 00:21:13.935
When he switched to try the new
dev console, he says he

00:21:13.935 --> 00:21:15.780
has to check it every time.

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:17.002
RICARDO: Yes, that is correct.

00:21:17.002 --> 00:21:18.350
It's not a stick yet.

00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:21.200
MAX: Just put in a bookmark
to the new one.

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.590
The thing is--

00:21:22.590 --> 00:21:23.840
RICHARD: It's a V2.

00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.290
MAX: It's a different
URL, so--

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:27.140
ELLIE: Bookmark it for now.

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:28.440
RICHARD: Change your bookmarks,
there we go.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:32.836
Also, Oren, about deleting apps
from your account, I just

00:21:32.836 --> 00:21:34.540
had an idea that you could just
rename the apps that you

00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:35.650
don't like to zed zed zed.

00:21:35.650 --> 00:21:37.240
And they would just go down
to the bottom of the list.

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.450
I've just been into my accounts
and renamed the apps

00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:40.410
that I didn't want
to see there.

00:21:40.410 --> 00:21:42.080
And they've all gone straight
to the bottom of the list.

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.180
NICK: Or put a tilde or
something next to it.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:45.470
RICHARD: So at least you don't
have to look at them anymore,

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.700
even if they're just at the
bottom of the page.

00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:48.675
ELLIE: That's a good idea.

00:21:48.675 --> 00:21:51.950
RICHARD: Does the new console
have a limit to the number of

00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:54.440
apps that appear on
the front page?

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:59.870
RICARDO: It's 50 per page.

00:21:59.870 --> 00:22:02.200
We did a few estimations of
the average number of

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:02.530
applications.

00:22:02.530 --> 00:22:05.290
That seems to be a good
compromise between the

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:10.032
different usages.

00:22:10.032 --> 00:22:11.830
And also trying to get
everything in one page.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:13.786
Before it was eight applications
per page, and it

00:22:13.786 --> 00:22:15.036
was just not.

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:19.520
RICHARD: Someone else has joined
us in the Hangout.

00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:23.110
It is [? Sonel. ?]

00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:25.170
[? Sonel, ?] do you have any
questions for the developer

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:26.596
console team?

00:22:26.596 --> 00:22:28.200
MALE SPEAKER: Hello?

00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.100
NICK: Hello.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.255
You're very quiet.

00:22:31.255 --> 00:22:33.190
MALE SPEAKER: Hello?

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:34.470
ELLIE: Hello.

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:37.700
MALE SPEAKER: I have
a question.

00:22:37.700 --> 00:22:40.050
RICHARD: Yeah, please,
go ahead.

00:22:40.050 --> 00:22:43.690
MALE SPEAKER: I have a question
regarding Android.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:44.315
Hello?

00:22:44.315 --> 00:22:45.150
RICHARD: Hi.

00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:48.130
Please go ahead and
ask the question.

00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:51.730
MALE SPEAKER: I want to know,
how [INAUDIBLE] secure using

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:55.005
Android apps?

00:22:55.005 --> 00:22:57.680
NICK: How secure is it
to use Android apps?

00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.120
OK, so I don't think that's
really a question for the

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.430
Android publisher site.

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:06.340
Can you perhaps come back into
our office hours we have on

00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.380
Wednesdays at 2:00 PM GMT and
ask the question there?

00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.160
We're going to focus
on the developer

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.420
console for this session.

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:16.680
OK?

00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:17.380
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:17.743
NICK: Sorry.

00:23:17.743 --> 00:23:20.320
RICHARD: Thanks for joining
us though, cheers.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.200
NICK: OK.

00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:23.970
Back into the moderator.

00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:27.560
So there's a feature request
here that Ashley in London

00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:28.770
would like to see us order--

00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:33.490
comments on devices by those
comments left by people in the

00:23:33.490 --> 00:23:35.102
same device.

00:23:35.102 --> 00:23:39.990
So feedback, I guess, for the
Google Play client team.

00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:41.260
ELLIE: Sorry, what was it?

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.295
Was it being able to--

00:23:43.295 --> 00:23:45.120
NICK: They'd like to see
comments, when they're looking

00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:47.460
at an application on device in
the Google Play store, to see

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:51.190
comments rated or ranked by
users of the same device.

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.964
ELLIE: Yeah.

00:23:51.964 --> 00:23:52.930
That's an interesting
feedback.

00:23:52.930 --> 00:23:56.890
RICARDO: Isn't that labeled
already in the Google client?

00:23:56.890 --> 00:23:57.285
You can see--

00:23:57.285 --> 00:23:59.160
NICK: You can see what
device it came from.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:01.172
RICARDO: From my device?

00:24:01.172 --> 00:24:02.380
RICHARD: There is a filter
in there, isn't there?

00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:06.290
ELLIE: It's hard to find, but
I think it does exist.

00:24:06.290 --> 00:24:07.300
RICHARD: Maybe it
already exists.

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.165
NICK: In the web version,
you're saying, or?

00:24:09.165 --> 00:24:10.415
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:16.180
RICARDO: Reviews from my
device, or something.

00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:17.430
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:22.010
ELLIE: You have to click
on Reviews first.

00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:23.400
RICHARD: See All Reviews.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:27.710
Most helpful first, highest
rating, newest, options, for

00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:29.560
my device model only.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.430
So whoever asked
that question--

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:32.800
NICK: Ashley in London.

00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:36.850
RICHARD: Ashley in London,
there's an option-- not that

00:24:36.850 --> 00:24:39.220
you're going to be able to see
this-- it's on the right hand

00:24:39.220 --> 00:24:39.830
side of the ratings.

00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:41.050
And you can press it
and choose for my

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:42.940
device model only.

00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:44.190
Excellent.

00:24:45.950 --> 00:24:50.820
NICK: Next question, Andy in
Brooklyn in USA asks, are you

00:24:50.820 --> 00:24:53.810
planning an API to facilitate
automated or at least more

00:24:53.810 --> 00:24:55.330
streamlined published
and updating?

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.392
So I guess you can't say are
we going to do it or are we

00:24:58.392 --> 00:25:00.400
going to launch it or whatever,
but is it feedback

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:00.540
that you've heard?

00:25:00.540 --> 00:25:01.960
ELLIE: We've definitely
heard it before.

00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:05.750
And I think for developers who
have larger numbers of

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:08.920
applications, some of them have

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:09.830
definitely requested this.

00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:12.040
NICK: My problem with such
things is that I could see

00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:14.290
people using it to publish to
multiple places at once, in

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.520
which case you get to the lowest
common denominator

00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.210
approach, where they're not
taking advantage of things

00:25:18.210 --> 00:25:20.592
like the stream translation,
and so on and so forth that

00:25:20.592 --> 00:25:22.240
other storefronts
might not offer.

00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:24.790
RICARDO: May be helpful,
depending if you have

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:28.310
customized build tools and
workflows, at which point

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:30.080
publishing is just at the
end of your train.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:33.460
But there is the moderation.

00:25:33.460 --> 00:25:35.490
RICHARD: Quite interesting
comment from Daniel Baines on

00:25:35.490 --> 00:25:39.062
the G+ post, one that I hadn't
thought about before but may

00:25:39.062 --> 00:25:40.130
not be too tricky.

00:25:40.130 --> 00:25:42.630
It's about promoting
your applications.

00:25:42.630 --> 00:25:44.850
At the moment, we give people
access to the Google Play

00:25:44.850 --> 00:25:46.937
branding, in that little button
so they can put it in

00:25:46.937 --> 00:25:47.540
their website.

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:50.420
He's asking for an embeddable
widget that he can put in his

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.430
website where it will list his
applications on the Play store

00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:54.320
in a nice format with the
ratings that they have.

00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:55.820
And just let people
click straight

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.823
through, and can buy them.

00:25:58.823 --> 00:26:00.230
ELLIE: Ooh, thanks
for that idea.

00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:02.090
RICHARD: Thank you, Daniel.

00:26:02.090 --> 00:26:04.154
NICK: That is cool.

00:26:04.154 --> 00:26:06.610
RICHARD: Well, anything
to help promote.

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.285
NICK: We could talk about the
badge, because we don't really

00:26:08.285 --> 00:26:11.440
have the badge generators for
individual apps at the

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:12.280
moment, don't we?

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:14.720
We don't have one for the
publisher page, as well.

00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.970
RICHARD: For all your apps.

00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:25.900
NICK: Cicero, again, in France
asks, there's currently no way

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.830
to prepare a full release.

00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:28.930
You can upload an APK.

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:30.680
But all of the extra
information-- descriptions,

00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:33.140
screen shot, et cetera-- are
not part of a release.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:35.380
As a result, APK and information
are currently made

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:36.630
available independently.

00:26:38.780 --> 00:26:40.735
That makes sense?

00:26:40.735 --> 00:26:43.010
RICARDO: Yeah, that is true.

00:26:43.010 --> 00:26:47.340
So at the moment, after you have
published, then you add

00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:49.970
it physically each part of the
application independently.

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:53.015
But until the moment you
publish, you're free to modify

00:26:53.015 --> 00:26:55.290
and add information as soon
as you gather them.

00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.040
So you can start by saying,
I'm putting in the store

00:26:58.040 --> 00:27:00.680
listing or a screen shot,
because that's what my

00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:01.920
designer gave me first.

00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.995
And one day if APK's
ready, you can add

00:27:04.995 --> 00:27:05.800
that in a second moment.

00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.950
Until the moment of your first
publishing time, you're free

00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:12.330
to assemble your application
in bits and pieces.

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:15.680
NICK: So I guess he's asking
for a way to tie that

00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:17.990
description and everything to
a particular release rather

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:20.240
than having a--

00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.450
ELLIE: We've definitely had some
developers ask for that.

00:27:22.450 --> 00:27:23.940
Because they want to be able
to do exactly what he's

00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.650
talking about, prepare
everything and then at one

00:27:26.650 --> 00:27:28.380
moment, release it as a unit.

00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:29.920
So we've definitely
heard that.

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:32.660
MAX: So basically it would be
up and ready for new apps.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:35.540
But ones that are published,
then they're unfortunately

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:38.900
losing that possibility of
editing on the fly without

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:39.860
publishing.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:41.300
But yeah.

00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:43.080
RICHARD: I know when you upload
a new application it

00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:46.240
can take you a couple of
hours to get through to

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:48.340
people to see it.

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.640
If you make content description
changes at the

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.130
same time as uploading, do the
description changes go live in

00:27:53.130 --> 00:27:54.880
a different time to the APK?

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.474
Or does it all happen
at the same time?

00:27:56.474 --> 00:28:00.200
ELLIE: It's a good question.

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:03.200
RICARDO: There's a bit of
caching and optimizations

00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:06.170
involved in the pipeline through
which from the moment

00:28:06.170 --> 00:28:08.700
you submit something to the
moment it gets live.

00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:12.740
And that's also something to--

00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:14.650
I'm not sure [INAUDIBLE].

00:28:14.650 --> 00:28:16.800
But there are different groups,
there are different

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:19.090
bits of information they take
before they go live.

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:20.340
RICHARD: Interesting.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.640
NICK: There's another request
here on the moderator, so

00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:26.710
Lukas, is that Lukas Ruecker?

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:27.780
RICHARD: Ah, Lukas has joined
us here as well.

00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:29.430
NICK: Ah, do you want to
ask your question live?

00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:31.622
RICHARD: Hi Lukas, thanks
for joining us.

00:28:31.622 --> 00:28:32.960
LUKAS: I added a question.

00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:35.015
But I thought it would be
nicer to ask personally.

00:28:37.560 --> 00:28:41.370
So I know there's something in
Google Play for tracking

00:28:41.370 --> 00:28:42.430
campaigns and all.

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:47.170
So you can know where your new
installs are coming from.

00:28:47.170 --> 00:28:51.500
But that involves changes
in the app and all.

00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:55.000
And for indy developers that
don't have a lot of

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:59.330
infrastructure, you need to send
this with some server.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:02.610
So it's more work when you
don't have time or

00:29:02.610 --> 00:29:03.860
resources to do it.

00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:07.820
So It would be really nice if
there was some sort of super

00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:12.140
simple mechanism to
track where new

00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.040
installs are coming from.

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:20.040
It could be things, for a start,
like tracking what

00:29:20.040 --> 00:29:25.260
search keywords trigger new
installs inside the client.

00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:31.610
So either web or on desktop
or the mobile app

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:34.120
on the Android device.

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.370
That's one.

00:29:37.900 --> 00:29:42.190
Let's see, maybe which page
opened Google Play to install

00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:43.130
the new app?

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:46.420
So that's nice for if you have a
landing page, then if you're

00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:50.260
triggering the installs from
there, you have some sort of

00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:51.370
way to gauge that.

00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:53.740
So that's another one.

00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:55.290
Anyway, just a few ideas.

00:29:55.290 --> 00:29:59.800
But having a simpler version
of tracking referrers on

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.390
Google Play would be useful,
especially for people who

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:03.810
don't have a lot of
infrastructure.

00:30:03.810 --> 00:30:06.050
ELLIE: And so this would be like
something even simpler

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:07.225
than integrating Google
Analytics?

00:30:07.225 --> 00:30:08.680
Is that kind of what
you're looking for?

00:30:11.436 --> 00:30:13.050
LUKAS: Yes-ish?

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:17.590
The thing is, so just my
personal take on that, I

00:30:17.590 --> 00:30:21.750
usually try to avoid adding
Google Analytics if I don't

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:25.330
have a very strong reason
for doing that.

00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:28.480
If I can have just a simple way
to track where people are

00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.100
finding the app and installing
it, that's fine.

00:30:31.100 --> 00:30:37.300
Because Google Analytics takes
bandwidth and a lot of data

00:30:37.300 --> 00:30:40.020
connection costs involved
for users.

00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:44.360
So if I can avoid that, I
prefer to not add that.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:45.730
ELLIE: OK.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:49.020
LUKAS: So it's just maybe a
simple mechanism to track

00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.240
where the install came from.

00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:54.980
And if you want to go further
in adding your own

00:30:54.980 --> 00:30:57.500
infrastructure for service
side, or even Google

00:30:57.500 --> 00:31:00.180
Analytics, that's
another step.

00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:00.890
NICK: Yeah.

00:31:00.890 --> 00:31:02.320
It's a good idea.

00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.090
For those of you who don't know
what Lukas is referring

00:31:04.090 --> 00:31:06.510
to, there is a method at the
moment if you're tracking

00:31:06.510 --> 00:31:07.330
install referrers.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.260
If you Google for Android and
referrer, you'll find a way

00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.020
you can pass particular
kind of campaign

00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.620
IDs all the way through.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:14.770
So you can track the
effectiveness.

00:31:14.770 --> 00:31:16.410
But I agree.

00:31:16.410 --> 00:31:17.745
There's some work to
be done there.

00:31:17.745 --> 00:31:20.890
And maybe there's a better
way to automatically

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:21.981
service this stuff.

00:31:21.981 --> 00:31:23.454
So thanks for the feedback.

00:31:28.370 --> 00:31:30.410
So next question is
Daniel in London.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:32.370
Is that you, Daniel?

00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:34.630
Will it be possible in the
future for a developer page to

00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:36.220
show developer details?

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:39.610
And perhaps even integrate with
their Google+ account?

00:31:39.610 --> 00:31:41.550
So that's a good idea.

00:31:41.550 --> 00:31:43.250
Thank you for the feature
suggestion.

00:31:43.250 --> 00:31:44.650
And that'll be quick cool.

00:31:44.650 --> 00:31:46.290
Because at the moment, if you go
to a developer's page, you

00:31:46.290 --> 00:31:47.830
just see the list of
their applications.

00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:51.670
So it might be nice to have
some blow up there.

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:51.925
Cool.

00:31:51.925 --> 00:31:53.070
Thanks for the request.

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:54.540
RICHARD: We've got another
one in the G+

00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:56.140
stream from Philip Madison.

00:31:56.140 --> 00:32:00.370
He says he would like to be able
to click on the headers

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.190
of the all application section
to reorder the listings.

00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:05.756
To go to the app with the most
downloads, with the most

00:32:05.756 --> 00:32:08.340
money, pretty much
all those things.

00:32:08.340 --> 00:32:08.700
ELLIE: OK.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:09.427
Thanks for that.

00:32:09.427 --> 00:32:10.828
RICHARD: Thanks, Philip.

00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:15.446
Any more moderators?

00:32:15.446 --> 00:32:19.505
NICK: Yeah, there's a last one
is saying, any plans for

00:32:19.505 --> 00:32:20.810
better support for ProGuard?

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:24.510
And to easier read your stack
traces when they'll be

00:32:24.510 --> 00:32:25.220
ProGuarded?

00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.690
ELLIE: Oh, for native crashes?

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:28.740
NICK: Yeah. well no, just
ProGuarded normal files.

00:32:28.740 --> 00:32:32.540
If you upload your mapping file
for the APK, so you can

00:32:32.540 --> 00:32:33.800
decode the stack traces.

00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:40.510
Yeah, native is another
kettle of fish.

00:32:40.510 --> 00:32:41.660
But yeah, thanks for
the feedback.

00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:43.560
Like we said, we're not going
to comment on whether it's

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:44.100
coming or not.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:47.318
But thank you for the request.

00:32:47.318 --> 00:32:50.790
I think we exhausted
the moderator.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.220
RICHARD: Running low
on questions now.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:54.080
So we'll wrap it up.

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:56.260
But if [? Adira, ?] who's just
joined us again, has another

00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:57.880
question for us, please.

00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.610
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I wrote
it on the moderator.

00:32:59.610 --> 00:33:02.370
But you said that one
was the last one.

00:33:02.370 --> 00:33:07.780
So I don't know, maybe it
doesn't record mine.

00:33:07.780 --> 00:33:12.900
I wanted to ask if there will
be a way to reply for users,

00:33:12.900 --> 00:33:17.760
not developers, to reply like
the developers can reply.

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:22.640
I mean when in an app, there are
many apps in Google Play

00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:26.800
that the developer has
sort of abandoned.

00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.970
And many people with
questions there.

00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:30.210
You understand what
I'm saying?

00:33:30.210 --> 00:33:32.270
So they ask question
and there's no

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:34.765
way to reply to them.

00:33:34.765 --> 00:33:36.550
NICK: So you want to,
as a user, reply to

00:33:36.550 --> 00:33:38.215
another user's comment?

00:33:38.215 --> 00:33:39.360
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:45.500
Because you can see, for
example, ADW Launcher, it

00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.730
seems like the developer
completely neglects it.

00:33:47.730 --> 00:33:50.700
And there are a ton of people
with questions there.

00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:53.156
And no one can answer them.

00:33:53.156 --> 00:33:57.410
RICARDO: Sort of self-support
forum for users of an app.

00:33:57.410 --> 00:33:57.816
ELLIE: Yeah.

00:33:57.816 --> 00:33:59.560
Huh, haven't heard that
request before.

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.430
It's interesting.

00:34:00.430 --> 00:34:02.530
RICHARD: Almost turns into a
comments thread instead of a--

00:34:02.530 --> 00:34:03.850
ELLIE: Yeah, more of a forum.

00:34:03.850 --> 00:34:04.630
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, just like
YouTube, for example.

00:34:04.630 --> 00:34:07.512
You have replies, comments.

00:34:07.512 --> 00:34:11.420
NICK: Not sure that's an example
you want to emulate.

00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:12.540
Thank you for the feedback.

00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:15.219
RICHARD: Are you checking the
YouTube comments, Daniel?

00:34:15.219 --> 00:34:16.120
Any good questions
coming through?

00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:18.600
DANIEL: There are
many questions.

00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.064
But none of them are related.

00:34:23.722 --> 00:34:25.710
RICHARD: And if any of you are
wondering throughout this

00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:27.949
Hangout why mine and Nick's
heads are so much bigger than

00:34:27.949 --> 00:34:30.090
everyone else's, it's because
they're actually beamed in

00:34:30.090 --> 00:34:30.894
from another studio.

00:34:30.894 --> 00:34:32.966
And there's a green screen
here and we're just

00:34:32.966 --> 00:34:33.659
superimposing.

00:34:33.659 --> 00:34:35.969
So it's just been faked
interactions.

00:34:35.969 --> 00:34:37.814
Or we've just got big heads.

00:34:43.949 --> 00:34:45.570
MALE SPEAKER: I have a question
that's not exactly

00:34:45.570 --> 00:34:46.880
related if you don't mind.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:54.040
It's about the market, the Play,
but not the developers.

00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:59.106
In the market, there was a way
to download more than one app.

00:34:59.106 --> 00:35:03.090
Since you updated to Play, it
downloads one at a time.

00:35:03.090 --> 00:35:04.780
So if you're downloading
like a one

00:35:04.780 --> 00:35:08.020
gigabyte, it takes forever.

00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:10.090
And the other one don't
download until

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:12.042
the first ones finish.

00:35:12.042 --> 00:35:12.940
RICHARD: It's interesting.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:14.160
Hadn't noticed that
it switched over.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.275
You mean before-- do you know
how many would downloaded at

00:35:16.275 --> 00:35:16.830
the time before?

00:35:16.830 --> 00:35:18.500
Was it just two at a time?

00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:20.120
MALE SPEAKER: No,
indefinitely.

00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:23.760
You have, like, 50 updates, I
do update all, and they all

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:24.642
download at once.

00:35:24.642 --> 00:35:26.280
RICHARD: And now it's
done serially

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.853
instead of in parallel.

00:35:33.490 --> 00:35:36.690
MALE SPEAKER: They were doing
it together, simultaneously,

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:38.990
but slower speed.

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:42.670
But in general, overall
it was faster than

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:43.670
just one at a time.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:46.100
RICHARD: I guess the problem
with that is you end up--

00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:47.745
I don't know what the actual
problem was-- but you could

00:35:47.745 --> 00:35:49.450
end up with five apps finishing
at the same time,

00:35:49.450 --> 00:35:50.070
and then trying to install.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:51.740
So the installer still
has to stack them

00:35:51.740 --> 00:35:52.625
one after the other.

00:35:52.625 --> 00:35:55.200
Because you can only be
installing one app at a time.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:57.660
But I didn't know that
had happened.

00:35:57.660 --> 00:36:01.135
MALE SPEAKER: It used to be one
of the up points against

00:36:01.135 --> 00:36:03.160
iOS that I used to
use for people.

00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:04.825
But now iOS--

00:36:04.825 --> 00:36:06.010
NICK: Update all all the time.

00:36:06.010 --> 00:36:08.870
RICHARD: And just for it.

00:36:08.870 --> 00:36:10.965
MALE SPEAKER: Because now iOS
does have this ability.

00:36:10.965 --> 00:36:12.240
And Android does not.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:14.370
So it's kind of annoying.

00:36:14.370 --> 00:36:15.930
ELLIE: Well, you're going to
be limited by your download

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:17.440
bandwidth probably
anyway, right?

00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.600
MALE SPEAKER: It doesn't
really matter.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.280
For example, me, I have 100
megabits per second.

00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:25.880
So nothing's going
to slow it down.

00:36:29.770 --> 00:36:32.916
You guys are going to give us
one gigabit sometime soon.

00:36:32.916 --> 00:36:34.390
RICHARD: If you're in Kansas.

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:36.490
ELLIE: Only in Kansas.

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:37.615
RICHARD: Three clicks.

00:36:37.615 --> 00:36:39.720
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, eventually
we'll reach worldwide, I hope.

00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:43.960
RICHARD: All right.

00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:46.920
Well, I'd like to thank the
GPDC, Google Play Developer

00:36:46.920 --> 00:36:49.530
Console Preview team
for joining us from

00:36:49.530 --> 00:36:50.010
wherever they are at.

00:36:50.010 --> 00:36:53.340
I don't know where that is, in
a magic office somewhere.

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:55.790
And thank you for
your questions.

00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:59.340
We'll see you Wednesday, 2:00
PM UK time, 3:00 PM CET for

00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.320
our office hours.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:04.080
NICK: Join me and Roman
Nurik tomorrow for

00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:04.740
Android Design in Action.

00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:07.020
We'll be talking about what
your Android design needs.

00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:08.040
RICHARD: Please do.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.500
Android design is very important
to all of us.

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.160
Thank you very much.

00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.410
NICK: Thanks and bye.
