00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.790
As much as we hate the alarm that drags us
from sleep to face the day, it is hard to

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.110
imagine how people organized themselves and
their collective activities before the invention

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.330
and widespread use of mechanical or digital
clocks.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.800
Clever and adaptable, we humans actually seem
to have managed rather easily by relying on

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.080
simple methods, some of which we still see
in our timekeeping today.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.390
Universally, human timekeeping has always
been related to the Sun and its movement across

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.390
the sky.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.830
Ancient cultures, like the Babylonians, Chinese,
Egyptians and Hindus, even from the earliest

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:03.100
days of civilization were dividing the Sun’s
cycle into periods.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.640
Of course, one of the drawbacks to this early
way of keeping time was that, depending on

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.600
the season, the length of each period could
vary quite a bit.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.700
Another drawback was that at night the Sun
was most unhelpfully missing from the sky,

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.869
but Egyptians, like us, still needed to measure
time.

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.800
After all, how else would they know when the
bars closed?

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:27.200
To get around this problem, their astronomers
observed a set of 36 stars, 18 of which they

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.100
used to mark the passage of time after the
Sun was down.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.770
Six of them would be used to mark the 3 hours
of twilight on either side of the night and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.290
twelve then would be used to divide up the
darkness into 12 equal parts.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.350
Later on, somewhere between 1550 and 1070
BC, this system was simplified to just use

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.440
a set of 24 stars, of which 12 were used to
mark the passage of time.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:48.440
The Babylonians used a similar system, and
also had seasonally-adjusted hours, so that

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.440
the Babylonian hour comprised 60 minutes only
on the spring and fall equinoxes.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.850
Sixty was important to the Babylonians, who
inherited a base 60 calculation system from

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.250
the Sumerians; ingenuous, 60 is a convenient
number for doing math without a calculator

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.340
since it is evenly divisible by each of the
numbers 1 through 6, among others, and, most

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.970
relevant to timekeeping, 12.

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.789
Rather than using variable length hours, Greek
astronomers in the 2nd century BC began using

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.940
equal length hours in order to simplify the
calculations when devising their theories

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.180
and in experiments, although the practice
did not become widespread until after the

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.409
introduction of mechanical clocks; as such,
regular folks continued to rely on seasonally-adjusted

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:27.670
hours well until the middle ages.

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.450
The impetus to develop mechanical clocks in
Europe first arose among monks who needed

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.070
accurate timekeeping in order to properly
observe daily prayer, as well as maintain

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.520
their rigid work schedules.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:42.819
The first recorded mechanical clock in medieval
Europe was constructed in 996 in Magdeburg,

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:43.819
Germany.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.459
By the 14th century, large mechanical clocks
were being installed in churches across Europe,

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.860
and the oldest surviving example, at Salisbury
cathedral, dates to 1386.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:57.800
Innovation led to smaller clock parts, and
the 15th century saw the appearance of domestic

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.090
clocks, while personal timepieces were seen
by the 16th.

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.069
Note that, even well into the Renaissance,
clocks did not display minutes, and the idea

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.280
that an hour was divided into 60 of them was
not well known until nearly the 17th century.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.260
So how did people keep appointments?

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.030
One early method, practiced especially around
the Equator, was to point at the place in

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.910
the sky where the sun would be when you wanted
to meet.

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.260
A more common practice, particularly in the
middle latitudes, was to rely on a sundial;

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.480
all types proliferated and included everything
from a simple stick shoved into the ground

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.370
to the shadows that fell from landmarks (such
as Egypt’s obelisks) to formally crafted

00:03:34.370 --> 00:04:09.349
devices.

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:55.089
And, of course, advanced civilizations had
a variety of other timekeepers as well, including

00:04:55.089 --> 00:05:02.199
water clocks and hourglasses, going all the
way back to at least 1400-1500 BC.

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:06.809
Of course, these methods were far less efficacious
in extreme northern (or southern) latitudes.

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:13.080
To accommodate their mercurial Sun, the Scandinavians
invented daymarks – a system of dividing

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.039
the horizon into eight sections, one each
for north (midnight), south (midday), east

00:05:18.039 --> 00:05:23.469
(rise-measure), west (mid-evening), northeast
(ótta), southeast (day-measure), southwest

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:26.430
(undorn) and northwest (night-measure).

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.710
The time of day was known by noting over which
of these daymarks the Sun stood at that moment.

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:35.770
Regardless of the method of knowing the hour,
our ancestors also had to come up with ways

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:37.099
to get up on time.

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:41.680
One simple technique relied on a full bladder
and was accomplished by the simple expedient

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.740
of drinking a lot of liquid at bedtime.

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:48.180
Yet another time-tested simple method, at
least in rural settings, was keeping a rooster

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:49.180
close at hand (see: Why Do Roosters Crow?)

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.319
On the other hand, some approaches were dependent
on the kindness of others.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:56.729
In communities served by a sizable religious
institution, residents could often rely on

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.469
the ringing of church bells or the call to
prayer.

00:05:59.469 --> 00:06:03.069
Likewise, when factories were first introduced
in the 18th century, workers could depend

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:06.810
on the factory whistle to get them where they
needed to be on time.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:13.030
Later, as people moved further away from their
employers, some paid Knockers-Up, early-risers

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.639
who carried long sticks, to tap on their doors
and windows at the appointed time.

00:06:17.639 --> 00:06:21.279
Have you ever wondered what a.m. and p.m.
stand for?

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:25.340
Well, wonder no more: a.m. stands for “ante
meridiem,” which is Latin for “before

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:47.749
midday”; p.m. stands for “post meridiem,”
which is Latin for “after midday.”
