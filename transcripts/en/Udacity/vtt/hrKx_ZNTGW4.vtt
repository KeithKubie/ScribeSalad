00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.260
Bit Torrent has several steps for publishing. First,

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.560
a peer creates what's called a torrent which contains

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.950
metadata about tracker and all of the pieces of

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.520
the file in question as well as a checksum

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.700
for each piece of the file at the time

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.100
the torrent was created. Now some peers in the

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.210
network need to maintain a complete initial copy of

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.400
the file. Those peers are called seeders. Now to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.020
download a file, a client first contacts

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.250
the tracker which provides this metadata about

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:37.520
the file, including a list of seeders that contain an initial copy of the file.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.900
Next, the client starts to download parts of the file from the seeder. Once

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.200
the client starts to accumulate some initial

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.470
chunks, hopefully those chunks were different than those

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.060
that other clients in the network that are also trading the file have. At this

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:59.120
point clients can begin to swap chuncks.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.150
As clients begin swapping distinct chunks with one

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.819
another, the idea is that eventually after

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.760
enough swapping everyone gets a copy of the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.020
complete file. Clients that contain incomplete copies of

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.800
the file are called leechers. The tracker allows

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.220
peers to find each other and it also returns a random list of peers that any

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.310
particular leecher can use to swap chunks of

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.580
the file. Previous, peer to peer file-sharing systems used

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.460
similar swapping techniques, but a problem that many

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.310
of them faced, and which Bit Torrent solved, is

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.560
called free-loading, whereby a client might leave the

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.940
network as soon as it finished. downloading a copy

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:46.120
of the file, not providing any benefit to other clients who also want the file.
