00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Leeches.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.230
For most people, they're the
stuff of nightmares.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.840
But there's a lot more to them
than just slimy bloodsuckers.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.880
Now, the leeches in this tank
are medicinal leeches, and

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.590
they've got this name for
a really good reason.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.330
So for about 2,000 years, up
until quite recently, it was

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.260
thought that the body's health
was kept in balance by

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.010
substances called humours which
flowed through the body.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.230
Now blood was one of those
humours, and if you had bad

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.620
blood or too much blood, then
it needed to be drained.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.793
And that is where these
guys came in.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.830
Draining the blood from
the body was known as

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:04.989
bloodletting.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.770
And using leeches to do this was
the height of fashion in

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.900
Victorian times.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.260
In fact, millions were used
every year across Europe.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.590
Leeches are actually worms
related to the ones you find

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.480
in your back garden.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.210
But these are parasites
that suck the

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.190
blood of other animals.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.660
And they find a host by
detecting shadows and movement

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:29.840
in the water.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.020
So if I dip my fingers in the
tank and wiggle them around,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.850
the leeches should come to me.

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.430
And there we are.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.680
This is Larry the leech--

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.410
or it could be Lucia.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.840
Leeches are hermaphrodites.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.100
They've got both male and
female body parts.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.000
Now this one is hungry.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.280
You can see it's desperately
trying to find

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.790
somewhere to attach.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.775
So I'm going to let
it feed on my arm.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.520
When leeches are feeding, they
inject anti-inflammatories and

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.230
an anticoagulant called hirudin
that stops the blood

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.880
from clotting.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:29.610
And it's because of these
that they're still

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.500
used in medicine today.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.610
They drain blood clots
and promote blood

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.030
flowing skin grafts.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.170
People say that leeches inject
a kind of anaesthetic so the

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.780
host can't feel it feeding.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.370
Now, there's actually no good
evidence to support this.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:44.940
And I can actually feel this.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.920
It feels a bit like a
mild nettle sting.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.990
And what it's actually doing is
using three rows of teeth

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.590
in a kind of Y shape.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.900
There's about 100 teeth in each
row, and it's using these

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.026
to slice through the skin
to suck the blood.

00:03:03.026 --> 00:03:05.720
It could take up to a couple
of hours until it's fully

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.710
engorged, so all we can
do is sit and wait.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.310
The leech has been feeding
for about two hours.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.080
And as you can see it's
absolutely massive, but it's

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.150
showing no sign of
stopping yet.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.980
Now, I don't want to try to pull
it off, because if the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.500
leech feels threatened it might
regurgitate is stomach

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.450
contents back into the wound.

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.900
So after nearly three
hours the leech has

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.830
finally dropped off.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.950
And the wound is going to
continue to bleed for at least

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.485
two hours afterwards.

00:03:44.485 --> 00:03:47.270
Now the leech can last
on this single

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.160
meal for over 12 months.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.030
So I'll see you the same
time next year.

00:04:21.856 --> 00:04:23.910
The human volcano--

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.230
fire breathing.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:27.690
It's the most dangerous stunt
in the fire eater's

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:28.940
repertoire.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.270
But how does it work?

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.470
Well, it all hinges on the
oxygen in the air.
