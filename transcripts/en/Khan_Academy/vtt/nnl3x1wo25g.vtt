00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:02.980
Let's say you think very
highly of Company ABCD,

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.420
and you're convinced that
the stock price will go up

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.615
from its current trading
price of $50 per share.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.140
You could do two things.

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.440
You could either just
buy the stock for $50,

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.060
and hope that the price goes up.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.270
Or-- and I made this price
up-- you could go to an options

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.040
exchange and for
the price of $5,

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.040
you could buy the option to buy
this stock over the next month.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.422
It expires in one month.

00:00:32.422 --> 00:00:33.880
Usually it will be
a specific date,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.880
but I'm just saying
one month from the date

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.200
that you buy the option.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.670
And it gives you the option to
buy the stock for $60 a share.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.950
The type of option that
I've just described

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.350
is called an American option.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.020
And it can be compared
to a European option.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.770
An American option allows
you to exercise the option--

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.280
to actually buy the
stock-- any time

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.520
from the time you have the
option until the expiration.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:01.600
On a European option, you
only have the option--

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.780
you could only exercise
it-- on the expiration.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:07.417
But we'll just focus
on the American.

00:01:07.417 --> 00:01:09.250
Now let's think about
the different outcomes

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:11.180
depending on what
the stock does.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.970
So let's say the stock actually
does do what you think it does.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.620
Let's say it goes up,
and then it goes down.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.890
Let's say that you're really
good at calling stock price

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.390
tops.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.800
And then right over here--
let's take the two scenarios.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.530
Let's take the scenario
where you bought the stock,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.880
and then you sell the stock.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.060
So you bought at $50
and then over here right

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.650
at the top-- you're just a
perfect market caller-- you

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:35.510
were able to sell
the stock at $80.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.860
So let's just think about the
different profit scenarios.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.450
So here we have an end
price of $80 per share.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.410
If you had bought the stock for
$50, and now sold it at $80,

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.660
you will have a profit of $30.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.990
Now let's think about if
instead of buying the stock,

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.940
you bought the option today.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.877
So if you bought the
option, same thing.

00:01:58.877 --> 00:02:00.460
When the stock goes
up to here, you'll

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.730
say, oh, I think that's
the top for the stock.

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:05.267
Let me exercise my option.

00:02:05.267 --> 00:02:07.350
So I'm going to exercise
my option, which gives me

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.380
the right to buy the
stock at $60 a share.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.650
So you're going to buy it at
$60 a share, right over here.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.590
And then you can immediately
sell it for $80 a share.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.910
So you can make $20
on that transaction.

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.000
But of course, you paid
$5 for the option itself.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.840
So you make $20 on the
difference between 80 and 60,

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:27.970
but you had to pay 5.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.050
So you have a $15 profit.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:33.930
So there it says, hey, look.

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.740
Maybe I was better
off buying the stock.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.930
And even there I would say,
look, to buy the stock,

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.520
you had to put $50
of capital at risk.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.630
To buy the option, you only had
to put $5 of capital at risk.

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.150
And to see that, imagine
the negative scenario,

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.520
where instead of the stock doing
that, let's say the stock just

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.620
completely plummets
after you buy it.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.929
And it goes all the
way down to $20.

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:57.470
Now in the situation
with the stock--

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.790
let's say right over
there you just had enough.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.750
You just say, I want
to sell the stock.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.290
So this is an end price of $20.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.400
In that situation, you
bought for $50, sell for $20.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.050
You will lose $30.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.210
But in the option
scenario, this entire time

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.090
that it was
plummeting, you'll say,

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.020
I just won't
exercise the option.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:18.820
The option is out of the money.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.140
It makes no sense for
me to exercise it.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.350
So you just won't
exercise the option.

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.480
So you'll only lose the price
that you paid for the option.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.540
You'll only lose your $5.
