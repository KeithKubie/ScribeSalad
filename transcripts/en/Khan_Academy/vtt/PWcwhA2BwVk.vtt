00:00:00.387 --> 00:00:02.219
- [Voiceover] So we
have f of x being equal

00:00:02.219 --> 00:00:04.984
to the absolute value of x plus two.

00:00:04.984 --> 00:00:07.345
And we wanna evaluate
the definite integral

00:00:07.345 --> 00:00:09.903
from negative four to zero of f of x, dx.

00:00:09.903 --> 00:00:11.651
And like always, pause this video

00:00:11.651 --> 00:00:13.364
and see if you can work through this.

00:00:13.364 --> 00:00:14.867
Now when you first do this you might

00:00:14.867 --> 00:00:16.133
stumble around a little bit, because

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:17.677
how do you take the anti-derivative

00:00:17.677 --> 00:00:19.550
of an absolute value function?

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.949
And the key here is to,
one way to approach it

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.244
is to rewrite f of x
without the absolute value

00:00:25.244 --> 00:00:26.705
and we can do that by rewriting it

00:00:26.705 --> 00:00:28.705
as a piecewise function.

00:00:29.718 --> 00:00:31.908
And the way I'm gonna
do it, I'm gonna think

00:00:31.908 --> 00:00:35.833
about intervals where whatever we take

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:37.989
inside the absolute value's
going to be positive

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.743
and other intervals where everything

00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:41.205
that we take inside the absolute value

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:43.077
is going to be negative.

00:00:43.077 --> 00:00:45.723
And the point at which we change

00:00:45.723 --> 00:00:48.978
is where x plus two is equal to zero

00:00:48.978 --> 00:00:51.212
or x is equal to negative two.

00:00:51.212 --> 00:00:52.592
So let's just think about the intervals

00:00:52.592 --> 00:00:56.620
x is less than negative
two and x is greater than

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.181
or equal to negative two.

00:00:59.181 --> 00:01:00.403
And this could have been less than

00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:02.189
or equal, in which case this
would have been greater than,

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:03.976
either way it would
have been equal to this

00:01:03.976 --> 00:01:06.863
absolute vale, this is a
continuous function here.

00:01:06.863 --> 00:01:09.427
And so when, let's do the easier case.

00:01:09.427 --> 00:01:11.944
When x is greater than
or equal to negative two

00:01:11.944 --> 00:01:15.240
then x plus two is going to be positive,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.863
or it's going to be greater than

00:01:16.863 --> 00:01:19.666
or equal to zero, and so
the absolute value of it

00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.781
is just going to be x plus two.

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.569
So it's going to be x plus two

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.011
when x is greater than
or equal to negative two.

00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:28.859
And what about when x is
less than negative two?

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.340
Well when x is less than negative two,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.672
x plus two is going to be negative,

00:01:34.672 --> 00:01:36.257
and then if you take the absolute value

00:01:36.257 --> 00:01:38.044
of a negative number you're gonna take

00:01:38.044 --> 00:01:39.423
the opposite of it.

00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:43.330
So this is going to be
negative x plus two.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.173
And to really help grok
this, 'cause frankly

00:01:46.173 --> 00:01:48.247
this is the hardest part
of what we're doing,

00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:50.077
and really this is more
algebra than calculus.

00:01:50.077 --> 00:01:52.510
Let me draw the absolute value function

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.179
to make this clear.

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:57.429
So that is my x-axis, that is my y-axis

00:02:00.326 --> 00:02:03.826
and let's say we're here at negative two.

00:02:03.826 --> 00:02:07.781
And so when we are less
than the negative two,

00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:10.790
when x is less than negative two my graph

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.376
is going to look like this.

00:02:12.376 --> 00:02:14.876
It is going to look something,

00:02:18.784 --> 00:02:20.951
it's gonna look like that.

00:02:21.952 --> 00:02:25.169
And when we are greater than negative two,

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:27.569
do that in a different
color, when we are greater

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.486
than negative two it's
going to look like this.

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:34.442
It's going to look like that.

00:02:34.442 --> 00:02:37.497
And so notice this is in blue we have,

00:02:37.497 --> 00:02:39.775
this is the graph x plus two, we can say

00:02:39.775 --> 00:02:41.850
this is a graph of y equals x plus two.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.127
And what we have in
magenta right over here,

00:02:44.127 --> 00:02:47.504
this is the graph of negative x minus two.

00:02:47.504 --> 00:02:49.538
It has a negative slope and we intercept

00:02:49.538 --> 00:02:51.788
the y-axis at negative two.

00:02:52.662 --> 00:02:53.598
So it makes sense.

00:02:53.598 --> 00:02:55.881
There's multiple ways that
you could reason through this.

00:02:55.881 --> 00:02:57.426
Now once we break it up then we can

00:02:57.426 --> 00:02:58.852
break up the integral.

00:02:58.852 --> 00:03:00.355
We could say that what we wrote here,

00:03:00.355 --> 00:03:02.060
this is equal to the integral

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.160
from negative four to
two, sorry negative four

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.160
to negative two of f of
x, which is in that case

00:03:11.324 --> 00:03:14.577
it's going to be negative x minus two,

00:03:14.577 --> 00:03:17.592
I just distributed the
negative sign there.

00:03:17.592 --> 00:03:20.842
Dx, and then plus the definite integral

00:03:24.143 --> 00:03:27.357
going from negative two to zero

00:03:27.357 --> 00:03:29.107
of x plus two, dx.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.335
And just to make sure we know

00:03:33.335 --> 00:03:36.184
what we're doin' here,
if this is negative four

00:03:36.184 --> 00:03:39.441
right over here, this is
zero, that first integral

00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:43.024
is gonna give us this
area right over here.

00:03:44.518 --> 00:03:48.016
What's the area under the
curve negative x minus two,

00:03:48.016 --> 00:03:52.199
under that curve or under that
line and above the x-axis.

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:55.372
And the second integral
is gonna give us this area

00:03:55.372 --> 00:03:57.489
right over here between x plus two

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.406
and the x-axis going from
negative two to zero.

00:04:03.384 --> 00:04:05.661
And so let's evaluate each of these

00:04:05.661 --> 00:04:07.249
and you might even be able
to just evaluate these

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:09.158
with a little bit of triangle areas,

00:04:09.158 --> 00:04:12.124
but let's just do this
analytically or algebraically.

00:04:12.124 --> 00:04:14.442
And so what's the
anti-derivative of negative x?

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:17.696
Well that's negative x-squared over two,

00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:19.612
and then we have the negative two,

00:04:19.612 --> 00:04:21.444
so this is gonna be the anti-derivative

00:04:21.444 --> 00:04:23.274
is negative two x, we're
gonna evaluate that

00:04:23.274 --> 00:04:26.107
at negative two and negative four.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.188
And so that part is going to be what?

00:04:33.188 --> 00:04:36.158
Negative two squared, so it's the negative

00:04:36.158 --> 00:04:37.337
of negative two squared.

00:04:37.337 --> 00:04:41.279
So it's negative four over two
minus two times negative two.

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:42.362
So plus four.

00:04:43.271 --> 00:04:46.315
So that's it evaluated at negative two.

00:04:46.315 --> 00:04:50.482
And then minus, if we
evaluate it at negative four.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.816
So we're gonna have minus
negative four squared

00:04:54.816 --> 00:04:59.039
is 16 over two, minus
two times negative four.

00:04:59.039 --> 00:05:00.872
So that is plus eight.

00:05:02.698 --> 00:05:05.793
So what is that going to give us?

00:05:05.793 --> 00:05:09.543
So this is negative two,
this right over here

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:15.406
is negative eight, so the
second term right over here

00:05:17.903 --> 00:05:20.178
is just going to be equal to zero.

00:05:20.178 --> 00:05:21.115
Did I do that right?

00:05:21.115 --> 00:05:23.926
Yeah, the 16 over two, it's
negative and this is positive.

00:05:23.926 --> 00:05:26.075
Okay, so this is just going to be zero.

00:05:26.075 --> 00:05:28.965
And this is negative two plus four

00:05:28.965 --> 00:05:31.238
which is going to be equal to two.

00:05:31.238 --> 00:05:34.854
So what we have here in
magenta is equal to two.

00:05:34.854 --> 00:05:36.927
And what we have here in the blue,

00:05:36.927 --> 00:05:39.206
well let's see, this
is the anti-derivative

00:05:39.206 --> 00:05:42.039
of x-squared over two, plus two x,

00:05:44.697 --> 00:05:47.543
gonna evaluate it at
zero and negative two.

00:05:47.543 --> 00:05:48.928
You evaluate this thing at zero,

00:05:48.928 --> 00:05:50.674
it's just gonna be zero and from that

00:05:50.674 --> 00:05:54.416
you're going to subtract
negative two squared over two.

00:05:54.416 --> 00:05:57.545
That is positive four over two

00:05:57.545 --> 00:05:58.847
which is positive two.

00:05:58.847 --> 00:06:01.122
And then plus two times negative two.

00:06:01.122 --> 00:06:02.289
So minus four.

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:09.659
And so this is going to be the negative

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:12.409
of negative two, or positive two.

00:06:13.318 --> 00:06:14.539
So it's two plus two.

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:16.088
And that makes sense that what we have

00:06:16.088 --> 00:06:19.135
in magenta here is two
and what we have over here

00:06:19.135 --> 00:06:21.968
is two, there's the symmetry here.

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:25.273
There is a symmetry here.

00:06:25.273 --> 00:06:27.101
And so you add 'em all together

00:06:27.101 --> 00:06:31.700
and you get our integral is
going to be equal to four.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.147
And once again, just as a reality check

00:06:34.147 --> 00:06:35.936
you could say, look,
the height here is two,

00:06:35.936 --> 00:06:38.988
the width, the base here is two.

00:06:38.988 --> 00:06:42.160
Two times two times one-half
is indeed equal to two.

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.706
Same thing over here.

00:06:43.706 --> 00:06:45.376
So that's the more geometric argument

00:06:45.376 --> 00:06:47.858
for why that area's two, that area is two,

00:06:47.858 --> 00:06:51.108
add 'em together you get positive four.
