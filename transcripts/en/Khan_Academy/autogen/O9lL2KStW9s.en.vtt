00:00:00.284 --> 00:00:02.687
 Here I have painted four different 

00:00:02.687 --> 00:00:05.125
 molecules of triglycerides. 

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:06.064
 You can say, 

00:00:06.064 --> 00:00:09.013
 "Wait, I thought triglycerides" 

00:00:09.013 --> 00:00:11.952
 "have many carbon, hydrogen and oxygen atoms." 

00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:14.158
 "And here I see only oxygen," 

00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:16.654
 "where are all carbon and hydrogen atoms?" 

00:00:16.654 --> 00:00:18.593
 My answer is that they are implied by the structural fool. 

00:00:18.593 --> 00:00:20.857
 This is a short way to display 

00:00:20.857 --> 00:00:22.053
 of these large molecules. 

00:00:22.053 --> 00:00:23.388
 You will see these folks very often 

00:00:23.388 --> 00:00:26.128
 in Chemistry, Biology, and Organic Chemistry. 

00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:27.289
 Every one 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.516
 of these tapered parts along the chain, 

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:33.024
 all of these points mean carbon atoms. 

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:34.791
 There is one carbon atom here, one here. 

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:35.753
 One - here 

00:00:35.753 --> 00:00:36.588
 Also, 

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:39.386
 if there is no letter at the end of the chain, 

00:00:39.386 --> 00:00:41.790
 has a carbon atom here. 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.345
 It is understood that there is a carbon atom here, 

00:00:43.345 --> 00:00:45.656
 there is a carbon atom here and there. 

00:00:45.656 --> 00:00:46.724
 You may be wondering about 

00:00:46.724 --> 00:00:47.827
 hydrogen atoms? 

00:00:47.827 --> 00:00:52.726
 We assume that each carbon atom has four covalent bonds. 

00:00:52.726 --> 00:00:55.222
 If any of these carbon atoms are present 

00:00:55.222 --> 00:00:56.221
 additional covalent links, 

00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:59.089
 we assume that these covalent bonds are hydrogen. 

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:01.445
 For example, this carbon atom 

00:01:01.445 --> 00:01:03.408
 there are two covalent bonds. 

00:01:03.408 --> 00:01:06.252
 So the other two covalent bonds, 

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:07.819
 will have hydrogen atoms. 

00:01:07.819 --> 00:01:10.188
 The same is the situation with this carbon atom. 

00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:11.987
 It is linked to two hydrogen atoms. 

00:01:11.987 --> 00:01:13.508
 At this carbon atom, 

00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:15.761
 we see only one covalent bond. 

00:01:15.761 --> 00:01:18.222
 So there must be three more covalent bonds. 

00:01:18.222 --> 00:01:21.124
 These three covalent bonds are hydrogen. 

00:01:21.124 --> 00:01:22.881
 All carbon and hydrogen atoms are here. 

00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:25.025
 They are implied by the structural formula. 

00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:26.953
 Now you can see if you are not, 

00:01:26.953 --> 00:01:28.195
 you can pause the video 

00:01:28.195 --> 00:01:29.518
 and think about the difference 

00:01:29.518 --> 00:01:31.318
 between this triglyceride, this triglyceride, 

00:01:31.318 --> 00:01:33.350
 this and that. 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.067
 Maybe you will think fast. 

00:01:36.067 --> 00:01:38.609
 We see this triglyceride 

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:40.258
 there are no double bonds. 

00:01:40.258 --> 00:01:42.289
 This triglyceride has one double bond. 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.960
 This one has several double bonds. 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.583
 And this one has several double bonds. 

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:48.884
 But the two are different, 

00:01:48.884 --> 00:01:50.590
 and we will think about how they differ. 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.983
 You can immediately see that one 

00:01:52.983 --> 00:01:54.654
 turns and bends, 

00:01:54.654 --> 00:01:56.755
 while this remains fairly straightforward. 

00:01:56.755 --> 00:01:58.183
 This is the main difference. 

00:01:58.183 --> 00:01:59.542
 We will talk about this in a second, 

00:01:59.542 --> 00:02:01.446
 why it's happening. 

00:02:01.446 --> 00:02:02.793
 But let's first look at this triglyceride. 

00:02:02.793 --> 00:02:05.242
 When we have all these single links, 

00:02:05.242 --> 00:02:06.217
 we can imagine, 

00:02:06.217 --> 00:02:08.550
 that we have put as many hydrogen atoms as possible 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.651
 of the carbon chain. 

00:02:10.651 --> 00:02:11.953
 In other words, 

00:02:11.953 --> 00:02:15.889
 we have saturated that hydrogen-containing fat. 

00:02:15.889 --> 00:02:18.870
 That's why this triglyceride is saturated fat. 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.286
 Saturated, it's saturated fat. 

00:02:22.286 --> 00:02:23.958
 You may have heard of saturated fat, 

00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:26.651
 when talking about things like oil. 

00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:28.718
 They have many different fats that 

00:02:28.718 --> 00:02:31.492
 we associate with a solid aggregate at room temperature. 

00:02:31.492 --> 00:02:33.489
 And the reason to be solid at room temperature is, 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.193
 that all these hydrogen atoms are connected. 

00:02:37.193 --> 00:02:39.724
 There are no folds to form double bonds. 

00:02:39.724 --> 00:02:42.150
 Their molecules may be relatively compressed, 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.787
 which makes them solid 

00:02:43.787 --> 00:02:47.189
 at room temperature. 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:48.559
 Saturated fats are sometimes linked - 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.393
 I do not want to go into controversy 

00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:52.750
 for and against saturated fats, 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.178
 but saturated fat sometimes 

00:02:54.178 --> 00:02:56.384
 are called bad fats. 

00:02:56.384 --> 00:02:57.952
 As we shall see, however, they are not the worse fat. 

00:02:57.952 --> 00:03:00.517
 The worse fat is actually here. 

00:03:00.517 --> 00:03:02.619
 We'll talk about this in a second. 

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:04.627
 It is saturated fat, 

00:03:04.627 --> 00:03:07.727
 because it is saturated with as many hydrogen atoms as possible. 

00:03:07.727 --> 00:03:09.620
 This triglyceride on the right, 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.595
 I do not know anything about him, 

00:03:10.595 --> 00:03:11.686
 there are all these single links. 

00:03:11.686 --> 00:03:14.925
 Or all these single bonds between carbon atoms. 

00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:17.421
 Here we see a double link. 

00:03:17.421 --> 00:03:20.661
 We see a double bond between this and this carbon atom. 

00:03:20.661 --> 00:03:21.717
 Therefore 

00:03:21.717 --> 00:03:25.223
 this carbon atom already has three covalent bonds, 

00:03:25.223 --> 00:03:27.325
 therefore it will be connected to only one hydrogen atom. 

00:03:27.325 --> 00:03:28.881
 He already has three covalent bonds, 

00:03:28.881 --> 00:03:31.121
 so it will only be connected to one hydrogen atom, 

00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:34.326
 unlike these two carbon atoms here. 

00:03:34.326 --> 00:03:35.452
 Therefore, we do not 

00:03:35.452 --> 00:03:37.391
 maximum number of hydrogen atoms in the chain. 

00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:40.596
 That is why we call this triglyceride unsaturated fat. 

00:03:41.336 --> 00:03:46.888
 Unsaturated fat. 

00:03:46.898 --> 00:03:49.651
 We do not have the greatest possible number of hydrogen atoms that can be chained into the chain. 

00:03:49.651 --> 00:03:51.323
 Because of this fat is unsaturated. 

00:03:51.323 --> 00:03:53.424
 In particular, polyunsaturated fats 

00:03:53.424 --> 00:03:55.827
 double bonds tend to form 

00:03:55.827 --> 00:03:58.056
 folds in the structure, 

00:03:58.056 --> 00:04:00.483
 which prevent molecules from being very compressed in space, 

00:04:00.483 --> 00:04:03.989
 therefore unsaturated fats are most often liquid 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.754
 at room temperature. 

00:04:05.754 --> 00:04:07.553
 It's an unsaturated fat. 

00:04:07.553 --> 00:04:09.295
 There's a lot here 

00:04:09.295 --> 00:04:13.591
 double bonds. 

00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:16.382
 It's called polyunsaturated fat. 

00:04:16.923 --> 00:04:22.002
 Polyunsaturated fat. 

00:04:22.112 --> 00:04:23.170
 And since - 

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.800
 both are unsaturated fat. 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.160
 It's polyunsaturated fat. 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.520
 Because this one has only one double bond 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.353
 we can call it monounsaturated fat. 

00:04:33.353 --> 00:04:34.651
 These are two unsaturated fats. 

00:04:34.651 --> 00:04:36.660
 There are many double bonds, so - skirts. 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.108
 There is only one double bond here, so it's called monounsaturated fat. 

00:04:40.108 --> 00:04:41.513
 One question you can ask is, 

00:04:41.513 --> 00:04:44.849
 "Why are there folds in" 

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.656
 "this molecule and this molecule," 

00:04:46.656 --> 00:04:48.827
 "not in this molecule," 

00:04:48.827 --> 00:04:51.242
 "although it also has double bonds?". 

00:04:51.242 --> 00:04:52.890
 The reason is our good friends 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.119
 cis and trance. 

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:56.420
 Maybe you remember, 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.520
 that if we have a double bond between carbon atoms - 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.482
 Let's say we have, 

00:05:01.482 --> 00:05:06.358
 one configuration. 

00:05:07.398 --> 00:05:08.250
 I will draw it like that. 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.620
 Let's say we have a configuration where 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.093
 this is related to a carbon chain, 

00:05:12.093 --> 00:05:14.495
 and let's say it's a hydrogen atom. 

00:05:15.019 --> 00:05:17.120
 And on the other side is the rest of the carbon chain, 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:19.326
 it may be in one of two configurations. 

00:05:19.326 --> 00:05:20.789
 The rest 

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.983
 of the carbon chain can 

00:05:22.983 --> 00:05:25.793
 to be on the same side as the carbon chain on the left. 

00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:28.443
 I'll write R here. 

00:05:28.507 --> 00:05:31.067
 I will paint it in the same color. 

00:05:31.067 --> 00:05:33.904
 We have hydrogen. 

00:05:33.904 --> 00:05:35.594
 This is one configuration. 

00:05:35.594 --> 00:05:38.000
 The other configuration would be 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.189
 double bond between two carbon atoms. 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:42.093
 We have a hydrogen atom, but now the hydrogen atoms 

00:05:42.093 --> 00:05:43.951
 are from opposite sides. 

00:05:43.951 --> 00:05:48.780
 Also the chains - 

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.360
 the rest of the carbon chains 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.460
 are from opposite sides. 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.260
 As we have said before, 

00:05:54.261 --> 00:05:55.793
 this is because the double bonds are immobile. 

00:05:55.793 --> 00:05:56.885
 There can be no rotation around them. 

00:05:56.885 --> 00:05:58.452
 Therefore, these molecules are actually different 

00:05:58.452 --> 00:06:00.960
 isomers. 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.422
 It matters whether this circuit is 

00:06:02.422 --> 00:06:03.850
 from the same side with this chain. 

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:05.395
 Whether they are from the same country. 

00:06:05.395 --> 00:06:06.486
 When they are from the same country, 

00:06:06.486 --> 00:06:08.785
 we call this cis configuration, 

00:06:10.395 --> 00:06:13.858
 and this is a trance, trans configuration. 

00:06:13.858 --> 00:06:15.681
 It turns out that most of the natural, 

00:06:15.681 --> 00:06:19.582
 produced unsaturated fats are in cis configuration. 

00:06:19.582 --> 00:06:21.428
 Because they are in cis configuration 

00:06:21.428 --> 00:06:23.053
 whenever we have double links, 

00:06:23.053 --> 00:06:25.759
 they bend the chain. 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.361
 And if we have many double bonds, 

00:06:27.361 --> 00:06:28.789
 they bend the chain a lot. 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:30.751
 Therefore, polyunsaturated fats very often 

00:06:30.751 --> 00:06:34.060
 are liquid. It is very difficult for their molecules to stand close together, to be compressed. 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:35.557
 What is going on in here? 

00:06:35.557 --> 00:06:37.786
 These molecules are in the configuration, 

00:06:37.786 --> 00:06:39.981
 in which 

00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:41.525
 the rest of the carbon chains 

00:06:41.525 --> 00:06:43.789
 are on the opposite sides of the double bond. 

00:06:43.789 --> 00:06:45.287
 Note this carbon chain 

00:06:46.517 --> 00:06:48.061
 is above the double bond. 

00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:50.685
 Forms a covalent link up. 

00:06:50.685 --> 00:06:54.551
 While this carbon chain here, 

00:06:54.551 --> 00:06:57.558
 is under the double bond. 

00:06:57.558 --> 00:06:59.288
 Because of this no bump is formed, 

00:06:59.288 --> 00:07:01.355
 this is the trans configuration. 

00:07:01.355 --> 00:07:02.585
 This here 

00:07:02.585 --> 00:07:04.919
 is called trans fat. 

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:08.571
 This is called trans fat. 

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:10.745
 They usually do not meet 

00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:12.512
 in nature. 

00:07:12.512 --> 00:07:14.843
 Interesting about trans fats is that 

00:07:14.843 --> 00:07:16.355
 many people say, "Okay," 

00:07:16.355 --> 00:07:18.410
 "maybe saturated fats are bad for us," 

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:20.418
 "maybe we should not eat so much butter." 

00:07:20.418 --> 00:07:23.518
 This is still a matter of many debates. 

00:07:23.518 --> 00:07:27.361
 Some people say, "Well, if we start with unsaturated fat?". 

00:07:27.361 --> 00:07:29.927
 They are often considered healthier, 

00:07:29.927 --> 00:07:32.249
 like our polyunsaturated fat here. 

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:34.350
 Add some hydrogen atoms, 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:37.949
 not to saturate it fully, 

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:39.656
 but enough to disappear 

00:07:39.656 --> 00:07:41.084
 some double bonds. 

00:07:41.084 --> 00:07:42.860
 This will make it harder at room temperature, 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.622
 which will make it a good substitute for cooking oil. 

00:07:46.622 --> 00:07:49.455
 Many of the margarines you may have seen 

00:07:49.455 --> 00:07:52.138
 10-15 years ago, as well as today, 

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.482
 are trans fats. 

00:07:54.482 --> 00:07:56.583
 So here 

00:07:56.583 --> 00:07:58.395
 we can replace many of these double bonds, 

00:07:58.395 --> 00:08:00.821
 we can fill them with more hydrogen atoms. 

00:08:00.821 --> 00:08:05.828
 But in this process, 

00:08:05.828 --> 00:08:07.528
 some of the cis double bonds 

00:08:07.528 --> 00:08:09.517
 are transformed into trans double bonds. 

00:08:09.517 --> 00:08:10.924
 And first people said, "Oh, that's harmless," 

00:08:10.924 --> 00:08:14.428
 "maybe even good for health, fat is still unsaturated." 

00:08:14.428 --> 00:08:17.690
 But it has some of the properties of saturated fat. 

00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:20.291
 Margarine is solid and has an oily taste. 

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.183
 And it may be cheaper to manufacture. 

00:08:22.183 --> 00:08:23.855
 You can do it from other oils. 

00:08:23.855 --> 00:08:26.293
 But it turns out to be very unhealthy. 

00:08:26.293 --> 00:08:27.884
 There are many controversial questions about nutrition, 

00:08:27.884 --> 00:08:30.287
 but margarine is really unhealthy. 

00:08:30.287 --> 00:08:31.460
 It does not exist in nature 

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:33.120
 and has a variety of negative effects on the body. 

00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.488
 That is why in many states and even countries 

00:08:35.488 --> 00:08:38.390
 have forbidden trans fats. 

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:40.783
 I've even heard people 

00:08:40.783 --> 00:08:43.116
 to call them "poisonous to the body" 

00:08:43.116 --> 00:08:44.684
 in certain ways. 

00:08:44.684 --> 00:08:48.190
 They have a strong negative effect. 

00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:50.152
 This may sound very loud, 

00:08:50.152 --> 00:08:52.061
 I guess I'm trying to scare you a little. 

00:08:52.061 --> 00:08:53.334
 But do not eat trans fats. 

00:08:53.334 --> 00:08:55.372
 Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the video.
