&gt;&gt; Alan Eustace: So hello, everybody. And
welcome. I have the amazingly great pleasure

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:13.090
of introducing Al Worden here. Here's his
book Falling To Earth. Which you should all

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.900
run out and buy then you should tell all your
friends to buy. How's that.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.769
&gt;&gt;Al Worden: Good morning Alan. Thank you.
[laughter]

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:24.779
&gt;&gt; Eustace: [laughter] In a matter of fact
I'll sell mine for 55 dollars right now and

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.699
it will be worth every penny.[laughter] No,
no. As I was telling him, I sent a note around.

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:39.690
I grew up with the space program. My dad and
I moved and my mom from Baltimore, Maryland

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.610
down to Orlando, Florida so he could work
at Martin Marietta as a mechanical engineer

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.960
in an aerospace company. And we went to essentially
every launch. So we would all pile into the

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.580
car and drive over to the coast, which was
maybe 50 miles away, something like that.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.600
Back in the day you could watch launches from
really, really close. And you know I still

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.869
get goose pimples when I think about those
launches and think about the period of time

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.600
when I think there was a revolution in technology
and science and exploration and things like

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.049
that. And I'm just so happy to have you here
as a participant-

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.210
&gt;&gt; Worden: Thank you Alan.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.270
&gt;&gt; Eustace: In that program. So you guys are
going to ask most of the questions. I just

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.490
want you to know that. So if any of you just
sitting there waiting for everyone around

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.249
to ask all the question or even worse waiting
for me to ask all the questions. You guys

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:38.049
are going to have to start thinking right
away. But I do have a few here just to get

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:45.149
us started. I'll start actually with one of
the ones here which I know is near and dear

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.009
to your heart, which is navigation. So we,
you know, having, you know getting to the

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:58.740
Moon and getting back, you know, was, well,
why don't you actually start with the computers,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.280
how much support you had in that process.
And then talk about navigation in general.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.201
&gt;&gt; Worden: Okay, obviously to go to the Moon,
you got to know where you are. You got to

00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:16.129
know where the Moon is. [laughter] Which is
kind of an interesting problem. We knew where

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.959
we were launching from. We knew where we were
going, and we kind of had to keep track of

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.730
where we were on the way. We had a computer
on board that we used to help us make all

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:37.299
those calculations and in fact we could do
our own navigation on board. Let me say this,

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.370
there's a difference between the way the American
space program is operated and the way the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.070
Russians are operated. The Russians basically
do everything from the ground. Everything

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:55.340
is remotely controlled. We have a lot of unmanned
aerial vehicles these days that are run from

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.950
a console somewhere outside of Las Vegas,
I guess. It's kind of same thing. The Russians

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:07.659
fly their spacecraft from their mission control.
And those on board I guess would, could take

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.180
over in emergency of some kind, but basically
they're not trained to do that. As a matter

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.150
of fact, the first Cosmonauts flown in space
some of them weren't even pilots. If you're

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:23.430
familiar at all with the Russian space program
there was a gal who flew early in the program.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:30.269
Her name was Valentina Tereshkova and her
qualification for making that space flight

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.599
is that she was the best parachutist in her
club.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.659
[groans from audience]
Because back in those days, they had to bail

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:41.409
out at 10,000 feet down on their way down
otherwise they're going to crash into the

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:47.540
Earth in that little spacecraft they had.
Anyway, we fly everything on board in this

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:54.519
country. Anything we do in space is actually
flown by hand on board or flown by an on board

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:59.249
computer in some way with a guy backing that
up. So we had a computer on board to help

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:10.280
us do those things. And that computer was,
it was designed back in the 1950s. It was

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:16.920
a small, hand-wired computer that fit into
the instrument panel and had a little disk

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.160
key with buttons on it that we could interface
with the computer. And for all the activity,

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:30.160
for all the stuff we asked that computer to
do, it had a programmable memory of 75K.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.560
&gt;&gt;Eustace: So you should also tell them what
program was left out of the hard code.

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.560
&gt;&gt;Worden: Well-

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:37.560
&gt;&gt;Eustace: That you had to-

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:38.560
&gt;&gt;Worden: Right-

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:39.669
&gt;&gt;Eustace: Load later just in case you might
need it.

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:45.000
&gt;&gt; Worden: Yeah, they didn't have enough computer
capacity to put all the programs in that we

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.400
needed to go to the Moon and come back. So
they left one out and it was the called the

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:56.139
return to Earth program. [laughter] Which
might have been a little problem if we lost

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:01.000
our communications. That's where we would
have a problem. But we were very success-oriented

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:09.949
so it didn't slow us down any. But what the
computer did for us is it calculated angles

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:19.370
and location for us. Now, if you, you want
me to go into navigation? We used three reference

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.630
systems to make the flight. The first one
is of course an Earth-centered system so when

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:30.060
we're in Earth orbit, the center of the Earth
is the center of the system. It's an orthogonal

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:36.270
system, XYZ coordinates, standard old orthogonal
coordinate system. When we started on our

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:42.630
way to the Moon we switched to a sun-centered
system. Same thing XYZ coordinates, but it

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:47.270
was a sun-centered system because the Earth
and the Moon and us, we're all in that solar

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:53.319
system. And then as we got closer to the Moon,
we switched over to a lunar-centered system.

00:05:53.319 --> 00:06:01.169
So we basically used three different reference
frames to get from the Earth to the Moon.

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:06.460
Now, we were in the sun-centered system most
of the time and that's where we did most of

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:13.580
the navigation. The navigation was fairly
straightforward. There were two ways of doing

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:18.110
it. One was mission control could tell us.
They had what they called state vector. And

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:28.979
that's as you know, that's position, velocity,
and time, okay? So you got three axis, three

00:06:28.979 --> 00:06:33.449
coordinates of position, three of velocity
and one of time.

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.720
We could do essentially the same thing in
space, but we did it in entirely different

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:50.620
way. When mission control, as they were watching
us, they did all of their calculations based

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:59.139
on ground measurements. There were 3 large
space telescopes around the world at 120 degrees

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:06.300
so that one of them was always locked on to
the spacecraft all the time. There were a

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:10.919
couple of things that they look for. One was
they look for range and range rate and the

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:16.240
other is they look for direction. Kind of
interesting as I'm telling that one. As I'm

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:20.570
writing the book I'm trying to sort all this
out and I'm talking to all the people that

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:24.620
worked in mission control back in the days
when we make our flight and I come to find

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:31.920
out that they didn't understand this ground
system. Mission control they spent 90% of

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:37.569
their time talking about range and range rate,
which gave them our position plus our velocity

00:07:37.569 --> 00:07:43.470
and they were very accurate. It was a pseudo-random
range signal that they sent up and it got

00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:49.150
turned around in a certain way and when they
read that return they could calculate where

00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:56.440
we were and how fast we were moving. The other
component of course is direction and that's

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:03.539
the one mission control completely missed
20 years later. They forgot all about direction.

00:08:03.539 --> 00:08:07.430
They kept thinking it was just range and range
rate but it was direction. I finally tracked

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:13.169
down a guy who was manager of one of the space
station, one of the large space stations in

00:08:13.169 --> 00:08:18.460
Australia and he said of course we sent the
trinion angles to Goddard spacecraft center

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:25.449
in Maryland they then translated them into
the other three large space telescopes so

00:08:25.449 --> 00:08:31.680
they had the trinion angles to point to when
the Earth's rotated and the spacecraft came

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:35.719
into view they had the trinion angles to go
to.

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:45.260
In flight, we did it a little differently.
We relied solely on the solar system and the

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:54.260
stars. We had 37 stars in the sky that were
the brightest; the 37 brightest stars and

00:08:54.260 --> 00:09:00.589
they were our navigation stars. What I would
do in flight, I was kind of the navigator.

00:09:00.589 --> 00:09:06.529
What I would do in flight is I would find
one of the stars in the telescope and then

00:09:06.529 --> 00:09:13.240
find the second star and we had a sexton on
board. I could lock on to those two stars,

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:19.060
superimpose one on the other. The computer
would then calculate the angle. Now what that

00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:25.060
gave us if we do that orthogonally, actually
I did it in every direction I could find.

00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:30.930
You always want to do one more. [laughter]
You're never satisfied with the last result

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:39.089
you got. But what that did is that gave us
an attitude within the solar system, just

00:09:39.089 --> 00:09:45.959
attitude. That's all. Make sure we're pointed
in the right direction. Now, to get location

00:09:45.959 --> 00:09:52.089
in the Earth-Moon system, you have to do something
slightly different. Now, we take a star and

00:09:52.089 --> 00:09:58.120
we calculate the angle between the star and
the near or far horizon of the Earth or the

00:09:58.120 --> 00:10:04.510
Moon. And that then triangulates or gives
us a location within the Earth-Moon system.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:11.350
That's not as simple as it might sound. The
Earth is about 8,000 miles across. The Earth's

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:18.570
atmosphere is 50 miles thick. When you compare
50 miles to 8,000 miles, it's not very big.

00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:23.870
But that 50 miles difference is enough to
kill you on the way back, okay? You cannot

00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:29.790
afford to have that kind of slack in your
calculations. So, what we did is, we picked

00:10:29.790 --> 00:10:39.230
a color band in the Earth's horizon to do
this sighting on. I found that the color band

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:44.620
blue, there's a light blue band of color around
the Earth, and I found that I could find that

00:10:44.620 --> 00:10:50.420
repeatedly and I could use that as one anchor
and then pick the star with the other side

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:56.190
and bring those together and it would calculate
locations. So that's the nav system on board

00:10:56.190 --> 00:11:02.339
which is very different from the ground which
only uses radio telescope data to tell where

00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:06.400
you are. In other words direction and range
and range rate and it can tell very accurate.

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:13.769
In fact, the ground had us within probably
I think 4 meters, well, more than that. Let's

00:11:13.769 --> 00:11:18.850
see, ten meters in about four meters per second.
That's what they had us all the time. And

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:24.540
it's a darn good thing they did that as we're
getting close to the Moon we never saw it.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:31.130
We were going in backwards. So we never saw
it. [laughter] So it was nice we had confidence

00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.649
they had this thing calculated well. Yeah.

00:11:33.649 --> 00:11:38.230
&gt;&gt; Eustace: Well that's great. One of the
things I thought was unusual about your book

00:11:38.230 --> 00:11:45.720
is you told it from the perspective of the
command module pilot. And I think that's one

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:50.990
of the least understood roles in all the Apollo
launches. So why don't you talk about the

00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:52.490
different roles of the different people.

00:11:52.490 --> 00:12:00.310
&gt;&gt; Worden: You know there are two different
ways of looking at the things that the various

00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:08.220
guys did on flights: there's the way from
the Houston approach, the mission approach,

00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:13.860
the astronaut approach, and then there's the
media approach. And the media has a very different

00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:21.090
take on what people do and how they do it
on a flight then what really happened. The

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:28.910
truth is that well, the ground rule was that
you always had to have two people on board.

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:32.790
One doing the flying the other looking over
his shoulder to make everything is okay when

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:38.791
you're doing a dynamic maneuver like flying
the Lunar module down to the surface. That's

00:12:38.791 --> 00:12:45.560
a dynamic maneuver and it required two people
on board. I stayed in orbit and that was okay

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:51.300
because I didn't really do a lot of maneuvering.
That's why we had three people on a flight,

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:56.500
okay? The commander on a flight like Dave
Scott was on our flight is the guy who flies

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:03.670
the lunar module down to the surface successfully
and then they get out and they walk around

00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:07.769
for two, three days then they get back in
it and they come back in a hurry. He's responsible

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:12.250
for flying the lunar module down. They fly
it like a helicopter. Jim Irwin was the Lunar

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:18.410
module pilot. He was a systems engineer. He
didn't get a chance to fly anything. Command

00:13:18.410 --> 00:13:24.899
module pilots guy gets to fly everything.
That's what I liked. I flew everybody out.

00:13:24.899 --> 00:13:30.529
Dave Scott actually was in command during
the first 12 minutes of the flight. That's

00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:33.779
till we got into orbit. Then it's my job.

00:13:33.779 --> 00:13:36.320
&gt;&gt;Eustace: Tell 'em what Dave Scott's role
was in all-

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.940
&gt;&gt;Worden: Dave Scott's role on launch was
basically to put his hand on the abort handle

00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:44.580
and be ready to twist it. And my job on the
launch was to hold his hand [laughter] and

00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:50.519
make sure he didn't. [laughter] It didn't
really make a whole heck of a lot of difference

00:13:50.519 --> 00:13:56.889
whether he was in the left seat or not. It
would have been his decision. If something

00:13:56.889 --> 00:14:03.300
had gone wrong on the launch, it would have
been his decision to abort. And Jim and I

00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:09.430
both agreed we weren't going to let him do
that. But anyway, his job was to fly the Lunar

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:13.351
module down to the surface and back again.
My job was to fly them all out there, stay

00:14:13.351 --> 00:14:17.421
in orbit by myself while they were down on
the surface. Then when they come back into

00:14:17.421 --> 00:14:25.699
Lunar orbit while they rendezvoused, I docked.
Then I got to fly them all the way back home.

00:14:25.699 --> 00:14:31.220
Like I say, I got most of what they call stick
time. [chuckle] Now, there's a difference

00:14:31.220 --> 00:14:37.529
in the perception of what each crew member
does as far as what the public sees. I mean,

00:14:37.529 --> 00:14:41.970
we talk about Moon walkers a lot. There are
12 Moon walkers. The guy I flew with tried

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:49.520
to make a big deal about there being 12 Moon
walkers. That's a rather significant number.

00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:55.630
He founded a Christian fellowship organization
kind of based on 12 Moon walkers. Jim you're

00:14:55.630 --> 00:15:05.040
crazy. But that's another story. But the lunar
module pilot really was kind of along for

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:14.220
the ride. Basically there was never a design
in a program for a lunar module pilot to ever

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:18.690
be the commander. He had to become a command
module pilot first because you got to learn

00:15:18.690 --> 00:15:23.820
one of the systems. You got to learn it and
fly it. You got to live with it. You got to

00:15:23.820 --> 00:15:28.940
make it work for you. Command module pilot
does that with the command service module

00:15:28.940 --> 00:15:33.850
and then what he's got to do if me becomes
a commander he's got to learn to fly the Lunar

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:38.222
module. So he's only got one more thing to
learn. Lunar module pilot never has a chance

00:15:38.222 --> 00:15:42.519
to fly anything, so he's got to learn both
of them. That's too much, that's too big a

00:15:42.519 --> 00:15:50.160
job. So there was never a program for Lunar
module pilot to fly as a commander. And command

00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.550
module pilot was shortcut to become command
pilot. That could have happened except they

00:15:55.550 --> 00:16:00.350
canceled the program out on us so we never
got the chance.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:08.300
&gt;&gt; Eustace: So good. So one of the things
that, you know, comes up a lot is what's it

00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.769
like in space? What was your life like?

00:16:11.769 --> 00:16:21.399
&gt;&gt; Worden: We were, we were in a vehicle that
was about the size of a Volkswagen beetle.

00:16:21.399 --> 00:16:31.690
We had 220 cubic feet to play with. I'll give
you some comparisons. Mercury spacecraft,

00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:41.730
the very first one for one guy had 40 cubic
feet of space for that one guy. Anybody here

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:50.920
know what volume is in a casket? [laughter]
Well, it happens to be about 40 cubic feet.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:57.500
Gemini Program came along that's a 2 man program.
And I'll talk about that for a minute in a

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:03.449
little bit. But the Gemini Program came along
and that was I believe 75 cubic feet for 2

00:17:03.449 --> 00:17:09.550
of them. So that's like 37½ cubic feet for
each of them. Then the Apollo program came

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:14.150
and that was man it was a Cadillac of the
spacecraft. [laughter] It had 220 cubic feet

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:21.190
for three of us. So we had as much space as
one person would have had in a Gemini capsule

00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:31.030
all by himself. 220 cubic feet of space, that's
about what you find in a Volkswagen beetle.

00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:37.030
And it's kind of interesting. You think about
what it would be like, we train for three

00:17:37.030 --> 00:17:44.300
years for this flight. We train in simulators.
And we trained together. We did all of that.

00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:48.650
And you think to yourself what it would be
like to be in that thing for two weeks with

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:56.460
these guys. And you really can't quite come
to any sensible understanding. But you find

00:17:56.460 --> 00:18:01.250
out when you get there. [laughter] You know,
it's the difference of getting in a simulator

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:06.920
for eight hours and then going home as opposed
to being in this thing 24/7 with no way out.

00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:14.880
So, you learn to do things. I learn to ignore
the other two guys. [laughter] Basically that

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:17.950
was my survival mode. It was just kind of
ignore them.

00:18:17.950 --> 00:18:22.980
&gt;&gt;Eustace: Well in your book you said when
they left for the Moon, you just kind of relaxed.

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:25.730
It's like finally some time alone.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:30.870
&gt;&gt;Worden: Well, well, that's kind of in response
to questions I get from people. You know a

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:34.640
lot of people say, "command module pilot,
you were in lunar orbit by yourself for three

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:41.150
days. You got to be the loneliest guy in the
world. It's got to be tough." And I'm very

00:18:41.150 --> 00:18:46.190
quick to point out that's the best time of
the flight. [laughter] I got rid of those

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:52.671
two guys for three days. And when I was behind
the Moon, I didn't even have to talk to mission

00:18:52.671 --> 00:18:57.300
control.
[audience laughter]

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:09.131
So I was very happy by myself. [laughter]
Living in space is, this may turn out to be

00:19:09.131 --> 00:19:15.420
the biggest problem that we've got to face
if we really do long-term flights. I think

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:24.410
the technology will come along. I think we'll
be able to handle that. But I think the psychological

00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:31.650
and the physiological side of long-term space
flight is going to be the thing that we're

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:36.910
going to have to really face up to. In two
weeks not enough happens to you. It's not

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:43.010
really a problem. But if we go for three years,
like going to Mars, that's going to be a problem.

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:50.620
Now, the things that we had to kind of figure
out on our flight, in the first place, you

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:57.710
all know the term zero G. You've heard it.
Zero gravity. And you also all understand

00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:03.760
I'm sure that there's no such thing. There's
no zero gravity anywhere. I don't care where

00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:09.270
you are. There's no zero gravity. You can
get that out of your mind right now. What

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:17.230
we were in our entire flight was free fall.
Exactly the same condition as if we were to

00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:23.450
put ourselves inside a barrel and go over
Niagara Falls. You're in free fall going down.

00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:30.400
Now, the reason they kind of call it zero
G is that the relationship between you and

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:36.600
the can you're in, you're both going the same
direction same time same speed, right? So

00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:43.440
you respect to the can are floating around
and it's like zero gravity, okay? That's how

00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:48.650
that term got started. But in reality, there's
no such thing. You're in free fall, but so

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:54.610
is the can you're in. So you're floating inside
and you got to learn all these different things

00:20:54.610 --> 00:21:01.170
you really never thought about before. Going
to sleep the first night, it was kind of an

00:21:01.170 --> 00:21:09.190
interesting experience. We had sleeping bags.
They were made out of fishnet type material.

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:15.050
The whole sleeping bag probably didn't weigh
more than four ounces, very, very flimsy but

00:21:15.050 --> 00:21:21.950
in this free fall condition, you don't need
much. It had strings at each end. They were

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.870
like shoelaces. And you are to tie the shoelaces
to something in the spacecraft to stretch

00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:33.360
this thing out and I decided I'd do something
different. So I got a paperclip and I tied

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:39.010
the string to a paperclip on each end. And
I just hooked the paper clip over a bolt head

00:21:39.010 --> 00:21:46.520
on either end. That would stretch out the
sleeping bag and I'd slide in it. The sleeping

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:54.550
bags were made only to come up to your neck.
So I slid into the sleeping bag the first

00:21:54.550 --> 00:22:02.380
night with my head outside and tried to go
to sleep. Well, that's a little bit of a problem.

00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:11.560
We are used to certain thing here on Earth.
And gravity is one of them. [laughter] Right?

00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:17.080
And it's hard to imagine what it's like if
that gravity is not working on you, but we

00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:23.070
go to bed at night here on Earth. We get into
bed. We put our head on a pillow. Son of a

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:29.400
gun, it stays there. Why? Because gravity
is holding it down, right? When you get into

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:33.980
space and you're kind of in this free fall
environment, there's nothing to hold your

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:37.880
head down. So if the sleeping bag comes up
to your neck, you lay there and you try to

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:42.150
go to sleep, all of a sudden you find your
head is starting to wander again. And you

00:22:42.150 --> 00:22:46.980
realize that your head's got a mind of its
own. It's just kind of doing certain things.

00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:51.930
So the first night out I had to unzip the
sleeping bag put my head where my shoulder

00:22:51.930 --> 00:23:00.930
would be which is a little shorter than I
am and zip it back up and I slept easily.

00:23:00.930 --> 00:23:06.370
How many of you ever just as you were falling
asleep had the feeling of falling off a cliff?

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:12.430
Anybody ever done that? I think we all have,
we just don't want to admit it. This is exactly

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:17.950
what we're doing is falling off that cliff
in free fall. That's exactly what we're doing.

00:23:17.950 --> 00:23:24.410
Second night not so bad. Third night didn't
even need the sleeping bag. Humans are very

00:23:24.410 --> 00:23:33.050
adaptable and we get into this space thing
physically very easily. As a matter of fact,

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:38.540
it was such -after a couple of days of adjustment,
it was so much like home that I had a kind

00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:44.610
of thing in the back of my head gosh I've
been here kind of thing it's like déjà vu

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:53.120
and it makes you wonder if there's not a little
genetic thing in our brains that says, "Hey,

00:23:53.120 --> 00:24:00.790
you know, we've been here before." Anyway,
that's for another time. [chuckles] But anyway,

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:06.600
that's, by the third night I could just curl
up in a ball go to sleep anywhere, very easy.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:11.920
The next thing was food. And I'm going to
take you through the whole God dang bloody

00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:16.670
mess here so just bear with me. [laughter]
The next thing is food. We had freeze-dried

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:22.530
food mostly. We had some that was radiated
like roast beef, and hot dogs hamburgers.

00:24:22.530 --> 00:24:28.120
But most of the food was freeze-dried. It
was made by a company up in Michigan called

00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:33.360
Whirlpool Corporation. And they made some
300 different varieties of freeze-dried food.

00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:39.790
We had to test all this food before the flight
to see if there was anything we were not compatible

00:24:39.790 --> 00:24:47.220
with obviously. Something that wasn't good
for us. So I tasted all 300 different kinds

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:55.190
of freeze-dried food. And I filled out a question
sheet. And our dietitian down in Houston,

00:24:55.190 --> 00:25:02.000
Rita, wanted to know how we were doing. So
I gave her back the list. And she says, you

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.980
know, we're going to make menus for you. I
mean, looking at me. Well, that's great. So

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:13.470
two weeks before the flight, I get my menu.
Jim Erwin is my roommate. He's the guy who

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:20.740
flew with me. We compared menus just for the
fun of it and they were the same. [laughter]

00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:28.140
So we went to Dave Scott, looked to his menu,
compared them and they were the same. [laughter]

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:35.370
I think Rita has handed us a bunch of you
know what. Let's go check the menu for the

00:25:35.370 --> 00:25:42.580
Apollo 14 crew. And guess what? They're all
the same. It's government food. The issue

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:46.610
was that, if you absolutely couldn't stand
something, they'd take it off from everybody.

00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:53.210
But the menus were all constant. They were
all the same menu, consistent. Anyway, food

00:25:53.210 --> 00:25:58.130
is kind of an interesting thing. Oh, incidentally.
Drink. We had always this freeze-dried food,

00:25:58.130 --> 00:26:06.480
but we also had drinks on board. Anybody know
what kind of drinks we had? Tang, yeah. Let

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:17.580
me just mention tang. [laughter] The last
time I had a swallow of Tang was over 40 years

00:26:17.580 --> 00:26:23.460
ago [laughter] on my way back home from the
Moon and that was only because it's the only

00:26:23.460 --> 00:26:31.820
thing I had. I decided after that that I had
never, never ever have that stuff again. It

00:26:31.820 --> 00:26:36.960
was terrible. I like coffee. So I had freeze-dried
coffee made up. And I had freeze-dried coffee

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:41.270
black, with cream, and then with cream and
sugar. Depending on my mood then I'd get out

00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:47.741
the kind. After dinner I like milk shake and
so I'd get out the cream and sugar. I'd talk

00:26:47.741 --> 00:26:51.560
with Dave Scott and Jim Irwin; the guys that
I flew with and asked what are you going to

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.700
drink on the flight? I'm takin' coffee. I
have to have my coffee. I wake up every morning.

00:26:55.700 --> 00:26:59.790
The only way I get my heart started in the
morning is to have a cup of coffee. "Oh, we're

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:05.340
going to drink hot chocolate." "Oh my God,
why?" "Well, we don't want to have caffeine."

00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:11.490
We're not going to touch that caffeine in
coffee. We don't want that. Boy I tell you

00:27:11.490 --> 00:27:17.280
what you're going to drink hot chocolate three
times a day for two weeks? I really wonder

00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:22.490
if you can do that. "Oh yeah, we're going
to drink it all the time." Off we go. I got

00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:26.790
my coffee. They got their hot chocolate. Three
days into the flight I'm checking my coffee

00:27:26.790 --> 00:27:36.770
supply. It's way low. [laughter] So we had
a little confrontation about that. I had to

00:27:36.770 --> 00:27:40.850
kind of hide it after that because they were
drinking my coffee. But this is the kind of

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:48.870
thing you run into in flight. Now the food,
the freeze-dried food, that's kind of fun.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:56.050
For a meal we'd have maybe five bags of food
each, okay? There'd be like a soup and a salad

00:27:56.050 --> 00:28:02.180
and an entree and then a desert, whatever,
five bags. You got to reconstitute the stuff.

00:28:02.180 --> 00:28:06.980
I mean, it's hard as a brick when you get
it, right? It's if a plastic bag. It's got

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:13.830
a little nozzle or a little opening like an
inflation valve on a bicycle. And you got

00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:20.570
to stick the water gun. We did have hot and
cold running water on board. We generated

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:26.790
our own water as we went. I'm sure you're
familiar with all. Not the kind you're thinking.

00:28:26.790 --> 00:28:33.900
No, we got our energy from fuel cells. And
the fuel cells used hydrogen and oxygen and

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:41.470
the by-product is water. We got electricity
and water. So we had our fuel tank. And then,

00:28:41.470 --> 00:28:48.050
we had probably the first instant hot water.
If you squeeze the trigger on the little switch

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:54.120
on the, it was like a pistol. So you go to
hot. Squeeze the trigger, you get one ounce

00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.520
of hot water. Squeeze it again, you get the
next. So, if the package says four ounces

00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:04.250
of hot water, you go squeeze, squeeze, squeeze,
squeeze and that's the way you got it. So

00:29:04.250 --> 00:29:08.040
you reconstitute all five bags. Now there's
three of us on board so that's 15 bags of

00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.860
food and it takes a while for this stuff to
reconstitute. So we're waiting for 20 minutes

00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:18.960
probably. What do you do with 15 bags of food
in space while you're waiting for it to reconstitute?

00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:27.350
Well, we tried every scheme we could think
of. We went to Velcro and that got to be complicated.

00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:32.230
Actually we went to a clothesline and clothes
pins for one try. And he didn't like that.

00:29:32.230 --> 00:29:38.650
Finally we decided the best thing was to just
let them go. Let them float. We didn't realize

00:29:38.650 --> 00:29:43.860
this on the ground, but when we got into space,
we figured out that the air conditioning system

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:48.510
inside a command module blew the air around
in a circular fashion inside if spacecraft.

00:29:48.510 --> 00:29:55.200
[laughter] And so we just put the food in
that and it would just go bum-bum-bum [laughter]

00:29:55.200 --> 00:30:01.550
like a big lazy Susan. All you had to do was
wait for your color code. Our food was all

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:09.170
color coded red, white, and blue. Each of
us had a color. Dave was blue Jim was red

00:30:09.170 --> 00:30:18.420
and I'm white. Obviously, I'm the good guy.
So anyway you wait till a bag comes by. It's

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:23.350
got a little white tab on it. You pull it
out of the stream. Cut the tab. Eat the food.

00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:28.650
Now, here's another thing about the gravity.
There's a difference in this business when

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:39.690
you get into space. Why is a spoon designed
the way it is? [laughter] We don't often think

00:30:39.690 --> 00:30:45.370
of these things, right? But there's the truth.
Here's the truth about this. Spoons have been

00:30:45.370 --> 00:30:51.420
around as long as people, I think. But a spoon
is designed to take advantage of gravity,

00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:59.300
right? You with me? [laughter] What do you
think happens in space? Well, there are couple

00:30:59.300 --> 00:31:07.590
of other phenomena that work with this. A
spoon, you take say soup and you get a spoonful

00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:12.930
of soup and you can hold it. The soup's pretty
level and you can hold it and it stays there,

00:31:12.930 --> 00:31:16.800
right? Gravity keeps it in. When you go in
space, there are two other things working

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:22.720
for you. One is the adhesion of the liquid
to the bowl of spoon. We actually carried

00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:31.330
regular soup spoons with us on flight. Adhesion
keeps it in, you know, sticks to the spoon.

00:31:31.330 --> 00:31:36.820
Surface tension then holds the top of it.
But you don't get a level spoonful. You get

00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:44.370
a big ball of soup on your spoon, okay? And
that ball of soup that's on your spoon is

00:31:44.370 --> 00:31:49.900
a function of what surface tension is that
holds it there, okay? So you get your, you

00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:54.400
dip it into the bag. You get your spoonful
of soup and you got this ball of soup. And

00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:01.270
if it's too hot, you just let go of it for
a while. We wouldn't think of doing that down

00:32:01.270 --> 00:32:05.080
here. But up there, you just let go of it
and it kind of floats around. As long as it

00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.050
doesn't bang into something, it comes back
to ya and it's a little cooler and you can

00:32:09.050 --> 00:32:19.090
eat it. [laughter] Well, we did have a problem
one day. We had tomato soup one day. And the

00:32:19.090 --> 00:32:26.690
bag got popped open a little too fast and
it broke the surface tension of the soup inside

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:31.390
the bag. And the whole portion of soup came
out of the bag and it was a bag about this

00:32:31.390 --> 00:32:36.320
big around. And you know it's really kind
of interesting to watch these things happen

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:45.240
in space because that ball is a perfect sphere.
And it kind of just start floating around.

00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:51.100
Probably the most serious thing that happened
to us on the flight was that ball of soup.

00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:57.050
That was almost panicsville, because if that
ball of soup gets behind an instrument panel

00:32:57.050 --> 00:33:02.740
and breaks the surface tension. Now you got
a thousand little balls floating around shorting

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:08.260
out electric components. That's not a good
thing. Now, I maintain this is why we send

00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:15.060
people into space is to solve these kinds
of problems. [laughter] We are never going

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:21.930
to have -- the one thing I found out about
making a space flight is that the problem

00:33:21.930 --> 00:33:28.840
you're going to have in flight is something
you never thought about before flight; always

00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:34.540
going to be something different than you had
figured out. Well, that ball of soup floating

00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:38.620
around was one of them. You know you can't
touch it with a spoon because the minute you

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.970
touch it, you break surface tension. Now you've
got 1,000. Can't go after it with a straw.

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:44.080
What do you suppose we did?

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.930
&gt;&gt;Eustace: I know, I read the book. [laughter]

00:33:46.930 --> 00:33:54.450
&gt;&gt;Worden: Agh! Very simple solution, got a
towel wrapped it around it and absorbed it.

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:59.800
Simple solution but you tell me a robot that
can figure that out. I don't think it would

00:33:59.800 --> 00:34:05.770
do it because it's always going to be the
very unusual kinds of problems that crop up

00:34:05.770 --> 00:34:12.300
on a flight. And that was one of them. Okay.
So we've got all this food. We've been eating

00:34:12.300 --> 00:34:24.290
three squares a day. One of the problems initially
in space is not being hungry. And again, that's

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:29.420
function of gravity. When you eat a meal,
that meal sets on the bottom of your stomach

00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:33.590
and the sensors on the bottom of your stomach
in our one gravity environment tell you you're

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:39.741
full. When the food's all gone, those sensors
say, "Gee, I'm hungry. I need something in

00:34:39.741 --> 00:34:44.970
there to fill it up," right? When you're in
space, those sensors don't work because there's

00:34:44.970 --> 00:34:52.800
no gravity acting on it. So the first few
days you have to force yourself to eat and

00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:57.060
drink. I think that if anything happened on
the Apollo flights to the Moon, the one thing

00:34:57.060 --> 00:35:02.230
that was constant to all of them was everybody
lost weight. Nobody gained weight on those

00:35:02.230 --> 00:35:07.370
flights. And it's usually a question of dehydration
and not eating the food they're supposed to

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:12.310
eat. We forced fed ourselves the first couple
of days until our systems got used to that

00:35:12.310 --> 00:35:18.170
no gravity kind of indication telling us we're
hungry. And once you get over that, then it's

00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:31.440
not too bad. Okay. Now we come to the end
of the story. What happens after you've eaten

00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:38.920
enough and you've drank enough. Sooner or
later, you have to do something else, right?

00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:45.151
[laughter] That is, we decided before our
flight we were going to be explorers. We were

00:35:45.151 --> 00:35:51.360
not going to be shy about anything, right?
Well, find out that taking a lot of willpower

00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:59.850
when you get into flight. But let me tell
you how we disposed of the waste, right? The

00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:05.290
urine was easy. We just had relief tubes just
like in an airplane. And that relief tube

00:36:05.290 --> 00:36:13.020
dumped into a plastic bag, a reservoir if
you will. And you just keep adding to that

00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:17.490
over a couple of days and then at some point
in the flight, you open a valve to the outside

00:36:17.490 --> 00:36:24.460
and the vacuum sucks that all out, okay? So
then you cycle over and you start all over

00:36:24.460 --> 00:36:28.500
again. The interesting thing when all that
stuff gets sucked out, the interesting thing

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:39.090
is it's kind of a surprise. Because what you
see outside the window is a cloud of snow.

00:36:39.090 --> 00:36:46.090
It's a white cloud of snow. It's not yellow.
It's white. And that cloud of snow is unfortunately

00:36:46.090 --> 00:36:54.060
going the same direction, the same time the
same speed you are. [laughter] So unless we

00:36:54.060 --> 00:36:58.290
made a little mid-course maneuver somewhere
along the line, we got that cloud of snow

00:36:58.290 --> 00:37:07.140
to keep track of. One of the reasons that's
why in our flight plan, we put in mid-course

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:12.890
corrections to coincide with urine dumps afterwards
so that we'd get away from it. Now, we've

00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:19.660
taken care of the liquid. How about the solid
stuff in well, that's a little different.

00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:25.200
We had plastic bags. Now, I'm telling you
this now. This is the way it is, right? If

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:29.650
you don't want to know the way it is, then
please leave. But we had plastic.

00:37:29.650 --> 00:37:32.420
&gt;&gt; Eustace: This is where technology comes
in handy.

00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:39.410
&gt;&gt; Worden: We didn't have that. Anyway. Plastic
bags. In these plastic bags were about this

00:37:39.410 --> 00:37:45.690
long, about that big around. And on the open
end, they had an inch and a half flange that

00:37:45.690 --> 00:37:48.920
was adhesive.

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:55.520
&gt;&gt; Eustace: Is this a demonstration?

00:37:55.520 --> 00:38:05.270
&gt;&gt; Worden: Need I explain that anymore? I
tell you what. It was, it's kind of interesting

00:38:05.270 --> 00:38:12.980
sitting in my seat and watching Dave float
by with that bag. I mean, you got [laughter]

00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:19.329
I don't want to draw a picture. I want you
to draw your own picture of this. [laughter]

00:38:19.329 --> 00:38:27.340
But I'll tell you. That up close and personal
stuff is really pretty bad. Anyway, okay.

00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:32.760
But here's the deal. When you're done, you've
made your dump, okay. Now, when you're done,

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:37.610
you clean yourself up. You put that all back
in that in this plastic bag. You seal the

00:38:37.610 --> 00:38:43.560
adhesive part. Then you got to take out a
pen and write your name on the bag and the

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:49.750
time of flight because the doctors back in
Houston, they're determined they're going

00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:56.720
to analyze all that crap after the flight.
So we got to save it. Well I'm going to tell

00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:04.380
you what happened to ours, because it never
got back to Earth. So anyway, that's kind

00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:11.720
of like what it's like to live in space. And
you get used to it. Our diurnal cycle stayed

00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:15.600
the same as Houston. We stayed on the same
time as Houston so when they went to sleep

00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:20.120
at night we went to sleep. How you decide
that its night in space is you put the shutters

00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:25.120
up in the windows, that's it because the sun
is always up there. We had a problem with

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.560
thermal heating on the way out and on the
way back from the Moon. If you stay in one

00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:34.950
attitude and let the sun shine on just one
side of the spacecraft, you got a problem

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:39.500
because the temperature on that surface is
going to go to 350 and the temperature on

00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:45.050
the shadowed side, the other side is going
to drop to about minus 250. So you got a 600

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:49.520
degree temperature differential across that
spacecraft and I don't think anybody trusted

00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:55.550
it that much. So what we did is on the way
out we had the lunar module stuck on our nose

00:39:55.550 --> 00:40:01.100
and we turned perpendicular to the plane of
the ecliptic. And we just slowly rotated about

00:40:01.100 --> 00:40:05.310
once every two minutes just to keep that heating
rate constant around the outside of the spacecraft.

00:40:05.310 --> 00:40:10.890
And of course, the terminology was that was
the barbecue maneuver [laughter] which is

00:40:10.890 --> 00:40:15.390
kind of true. But that's how we took care
of the thermal issue on the way out to the

00:40:15.390 --> 00:40:22.000
Moon. Once we got out in lunar orbit it's
not so bad because we're only seeing the sun

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.660
for half a route. And here's another thing.

00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:30.950
&gt;&gt;Eustace: Oh go ahead. And you guys should
come up to the microphones. So if you have

00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:32.230
a question, please.

00:40:32.230 --> 00:40:39.640
&gt;&gt;Worden: Okay. Let me explain something.
You Google people particularly know the difference

00:40:39.640 --> 00:40:47.580
between the backside and the dark side. [laughter]
You would not believe how many people do not

00:40:47.580 --> 00:40:53.620
understand that the backside and the dark
side. Now I'm going to tell you about the

00:40:53.620 --> 00:40:59.910
backside. It's not like the front side at
all. And I don't know how much you all look

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:05.011
at the Moon or try and analyze it or whatever
it is. But when you look at the Moon, your

00:41:05.011 --> 00:41:09.160
Google Moon shows it. You see all those dark
circles on the front side of the Moon. Those

00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:16.390
are all meteor impact spaces every single
one of them. But they were huge collisions

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:23.980
probably three, four billion years ago. Huge.
Those things are 500 miles across. Dave and

00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:29.400
Jim had to fly over a 15,000 foot mountain
to get to our landing site at Hadley Rille.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:36.310
That 15,000 foot mountain is the outer wave
of that meteor impact basin on Mare Imbrium

00:41:36.310 --> 00:41:43.500
250 miles away from the center of impact.
That's how dramatic and how huge these things

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:50.190
were. Well, what happened is, meteor storm
came through, plastered one side of the Moon,

00:41:50.190 --> 00:41:53.590
offset the center of gravity of the Moon.
And that's why we got one face of the Moon

00:41:53.590 --> 00:42:00.760
looking at us all the time. That's the backside.
Of course, the dark side is just the side

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:07.740
away from the sun. That's what gives us the
faces. Do you have a question? Might as well.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:08.740
Yeah.

00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:12.880
&gt;&gt;Male #1: So first of all, thank you for
coming. In the popular media whenever you

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:19.890
have on return there's always the drama of
reentry where two, three, four minute blackout

00:42:19.890 --> 00:42:26.230
period. They're wondering are the parachutes
going to come out? [grrll-grrll-grrll] What

00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:30.190
do you guys talk about during that time? You've
got a few minutes. You're just kind of.

00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:32.580
&gt;&gt; Eustace: And also you did have a parachute
problem.

00:42:32.580 --> 00:42:38.100
&gt;&gt;Worden: Yeah, we were oohing and aahing
about what we were looking at on the ground

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:45.311
because I could see all of the North American
continent: Alaska, Siberia, Japan all the

00:42:45.311 --> 00:42:51.840
way down to the Philippines all at the same
time. We didn't say anything because we were

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:57.640
looking out the window. You wait for the parachutes
to come out. There's a drag chute that comes

00:42:57.640 --> 00:43:05.270
out at about 25,000 feet that really corrects
our descent to come down vertically and slows

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:12.440
us down a little bit. The main shoots come
down a 10,000 and then about 6,000 feet we

00:43:12.440 --> 00:43:19.820
had an oh shit moment because one of the chutes
collapsed. Actually it burned up. We had a

00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:24.940
chute that burned and as we were touching
down a second chute was burning. And that

00:43:24.940 --> 00:43:36.810
was because we had what we called hyperbolic
fuel that we used in the RCS quads and that

00:43:36.810 --> 00:43:41.460
fuel of course you got two different kinds
of fuel and when they touch, they burn. Well,

00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:47.470
they're very toxic and very dangerous materials.
So we purged all the fuel lines before we

00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:51.600
touched down to make sure we hit something
in the ocean we wouldn't burst a line and

00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:59.451
have a problem. When we purged the fuel lines
they went up that one riser because we didn't

00:43:59.451 --> 00:44:05.400
have any surface winds that day. Normally
the thing would be going horizontal and that

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:11.120
fuel would be going this way, but on our day
we were stationary, coming straight down and

00:44:11.120 --> 00:44:18.210
the fuel went straight up and it burned big
holes in one of the parachutes and it collapsed.

00:44:18.210 --> 00:44:21.991
And just as we were touching down in the water,
the second one was starting to burn. So we

00:44:21.991 --> 00:44:27.730
were pretty lucky we got down when we did.
That was an oh gosh moment coming down. Yeah.

00:44:27.730 --> 00:44:29.990
&gt;&gt; Male #1: Thank you.

00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:31.690
&gt;&gt; Worden: Yes, sir.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:37.550
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Hi. You were talking about repeatedly
talking about flying the lunar module or the

00:44:37.550 --> 00:44:43.000
command module. It was occurring to me that
maneuvering a spacecraft has got to be very

00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.500
different than atmospheric flight. You've
got an atmosphere to maneuver against to slow

00:44:46.500 --> 00:44:51.750
you down. I'm wondering if the reactions that
you learned as an atmospheric pilot today

00:44:51.750 --> 00:44:57.950
are they applicable to space flight today?
Are they a possibly even a hindrance.

00:44:57.950 --> 00:45:01.850
&gt;&gt; Worden: Interesting question. The difference
between flying an airplane and flying a spacecraft

00:45:01.850 --> 00:45:10.640
is when you're flying an airplane you're always
going forward, hopefully. And when you fly

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:14.990
a spacecraft, you're going in any direction,
doesn't make any difference. We actually flew

00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:23.990
towards the Moon backwards, which didn't affect
our location. But we went in backwards because

00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:27.860
we had to do a retrograde maneuver behind
the Moon to slow down to stay in lunar orbit.

00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:33.200
So we never saw the Moon until we were at
60 miles. That was a point in the flight when

00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:41.010
we really put our faith in mission control
to make sure. But when you're in space, there's

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:46.240
no restriction on attitude or anything. You
can point in any direction. That spacecraft

00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:50.880
is going to go that way no matter what you
do unless you actually fire an engine to change

00:45:50.880 --> 00:45:54.880
your velocity vector. But if you don't change
your velocity vector, you're going in that

00:45:54.880 --> 00:46:00.380
direction and there's nothing you can do about
it. And you can roll you can do anything you

00:46:00.380 --> 00:46:05.470
want. It's kind of fun. There's some things
in space that are kind of fun that we can't

00:46:05.470 --> 00:46:12.480
do down here. Along that line, we took out
the center couch one day. Well, we had it

00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.490
out a lot of time because it gave us more
room to move around. We got Jim Erwin to roll

00:46:17.490 --> 00:46:22.550
up in a ball and Dave and I stood on either
side of him started spinning. We thought that

00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:27.000
would be kind of an neat experiment to run
up there and he's spinning. He's all curled

00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:33.800
up in a ball. Okay Jim stick your arm out.
Slowed right down. Pull his arm in. Speed

00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:39.470
right up. So that was kind of fun. We didn't
let that go on too long because we were afraid

00:46:39.470 --> 00:46:47.890
Jim would get sick. [laughter] But space is
an entire, there's another dimension that

00:46:47.890 --> 00:46:55.080
we're going to have to get used to if we really,
not getting used to. We got used to it pretty

00:46:55.080 --> 00:47:01.030
quickly on our flight. But learning how to
deal with it in a flight kind of way to go

00:47:01.030 --> 00:47:09.370
somewhere, we're going to have, there are
going to be a lot of studies, a lot of research,

00:47:09.370 --> 00:47:11.290
a lot of development on it.

00:47:11.290 --> 00:47:13.079
&gt;&gt; Male #2: Thank you.

00:47:13.079 --> 00:47:17.690
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Hi. I admire you for challenging
the impossible and doing amazing things.

00:47:17.690 --> 00:47:22.810
&gt;&gt; Worden: Didn't know it was impossible.
I probably wouldn't have tried it if I thought

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:24.390
it was impossible. [laughter]
[laughter]

00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:28.990
&gt;&gt;Male #3: It's been 40 years since the heyday
of the Apollo program. And today we've given

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:33.970
up our manned flight capability. What do you
think it will take to get America back into

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:34.970
space?

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:42.500
&gt;&gt; Worden: New president. I think that's the
big key to it. He doesn't like space. And

00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:50.460
I'm not being, I'm being quite serious about
that. But maybe not in the way you might think.

00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:58.020
Space flight to me, it's nice. We're going
to go somewhere eventually so we got a place

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:01.510
to go when the Earth's when we can't live
here anymore. That might be a billion years

00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:05.530
from now. So there's no big rush. But it's
going to happen. There's a genetic drive in

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:09.540
us that says, "We're going to go into space
regardless." And we may go through cycles

00:48:09.540 --> 00:48:13.320
and it may be 100 years between cycles and
it may be 50 years or whatever. Right now

00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:17.250
we're in the bottom of a cycle and I do believe
that it's going to come back because we're

00:48:17.250 --> 00:48:22.791
going to keep pressing on. The big problem
is propulsion. So we're going to take some

00:48:22.791 --> 00:48:29.730
time to resolve or to solve the propulsion
problem. But I believe that we have that genetic

00:48:29.730 --> 00:48:35.100
drive that's going to push us out there to
the point where we're going to find another

00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:42.360
planet where we can live on it someday. Like
I say may be a billion years from now. So

00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:48.140
right now we're in kind of the doldrums. But
the problem I have with us shutting down programs

00:48:48.140 --> 00:48:56.360
is two things. One is that the program is
responsible one way or another for an awful

00:48:56.360 --> 00:49:00.860
lot of technology development in the last
50 years. I believe that we wouldn't have

00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:09.900
silicon chips today if the government and
the military and NASA hadn't supported the

00:49:09.900 --> 00:49:14.530
development of silicon chips. Now, we're way
beyond that today. We're into mems. We're

00:49:14.530 --> 00:49:20.980
into Nano technology that's way beyond the
original silicon chip. But I guarantee you

00:49:20.980 --> 00:49:25.550
that the success this country has had in the
last 40 years basically is based on the silicon

00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:34.510
chip. Everything we've got has a silicon chip
in it, my watch, everything. That watch incidentally

00:49:34.510 --> 00:49:41.430
has got more memory capacity than my computer
on board. [laughter] But I do believe that

00:49:41.430 --> 00:49:47.520
when we decide that we're going to back off
from a technology development program such

00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:54.830
as the space program, then we got problems.
That's leading into keeping businesses very,

00:49:54.830 --> 00:49:59.030
very productive in this country. The other
thing that we're going to lose which I think

00:49:59.030 --> 00:50:04.281
is really dreadful is the motivation for young
people to go to school. I think in the last

00:50:04.281 --> 00:50:09.290
40 years the greatest motivator that young
people have had not only to go to school but

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:13.640
get good grades and follow it through is the
possibility they might work in a space program

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:19.990
someday. And I have to tell young people today
hey we're in the doldrums, now we got this

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:27.550
guy who doesn't like space so we're really
not doing much right now. I'm well I'm not

00:50:27.550 --> 00:50:33.100
happy with the attitude. And it's not just
Obama. It's the whole Washington scene that

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:40.180
I'm not happy with today. They really lost
track of what this country is all about. But

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:50.960
I really think that young people today without
us having an active manned space program.

00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:54.410
That's kind of taking it on faith it's going
to come back and that's a tough sell.

00:50:54.410 --> 00:50:57.860
&gt;&gt; Male #3: Great answer. Thank you.

00:50:57.860 --> 00:51:06.080
&gt;&gt; Male #4: You started off talking about
the role of astronauts as pilots and contrasting

00:51:06.080 --> 00:51:11.290
it with the Soviet Union's approach where
the Cosmonauts were really more like passengers

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:17.540
in many ways. In his book The Right Stuff,
Tom Wolfe makes a big deal about according

00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:24.950
to him the American engineers originally wanted
to treat the astronauts as they like to say

00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:29.600
in the book 'spam in a can or monkey in a
bucket' and that the astronauts had to kick

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:35.410
up a huge fuss in order to retain their role
as pilots. Is that really a realistic account

00:51:35.410 --> 00:51:39.890
of how that worked and that happened in your
experience or is this just Tom Wolf ripping

00:51:39.890 --> 00:51:40.890
a good yarn?

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:47.270
&gt;&gt; Worden: Well, I think Tom got it mostly
right. He's a great writer. And I spent a

00:51:47.270 --> 00:51:58.910
lot of time with him when he wrote that book.
There's always a problem, a difference of

00:51:58.910 --> 00:52:03.619
opinion about how you do things. How much
automation do put into something? How much

00:52:03.619 --> 00:52:08.020
manual control do you put into something?
How do the two integrate together? How do

00:52:08.020 --> 00:52:17.790
you manage all of that? Yes, some of the original
seven guys were pretty strong about flying

00:52:17.790 --> 00:52:24.470
that thing. And the Mercury was pretty much,
as you probably are aware and many of you

00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:29.690
studied all this stuff was that Scott Carpenter
had a lot of problems on his flight because

00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:34.830
he couldn't manually get it to where it's
supposed to be for reentry and that got him

00:52:34.830 --> 00:52:41.810
into a lot of trouble 200 miles down range.
As far as I know I haven't heard an argument

00:52:41.810 --> 00:52:47.360
that says we needed to do it more manually
than we were doing it. We were pretty set

00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:56.140
on doing all the flying ourselves. Now, we
had a computer that helped us a lot. We never

00:52:56.140 --> 00:53:02.110
developed a system that would allow the ground
to automatically dock one of our spacecraft

00:53:02.110 --> 00:53:06.060
to the International Space Station. We don't
have that program. They got to do it manually.

00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:12.200
And I don't recall there ever being discussion
to make it any more automated than that.

00:53:12.200 --> 00:53:14.080
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Thank you.

00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:15.080
&gt;&gt;Worden: Mm-hmm.

00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:20.650
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Two questions if I may. First
one is vis-à-vis your comment about the doldrums

00:53:20.650 --> 00:53:25.450
we're in today with respect to space exploration.
What's your perspective about the role of

00:53:25.450 --> 00:53:26.970
private industry?

00:53:26.970 --> 00:53:29.410
&gt;&gt; Worden: Private industry in space.

00:53:29.410 --> 00:53:31.810
&gt;&gt; Male #5: Sure.

00:53:31.810 --> 00:53:36.030
&gt;&gt; Worden: Gee. My attitude about that is
pretty well-known I think.

00:53:36.030 --> 00:53:46.099
&gt;&gt; Eustace: We just talked about that at lunch,
you know. It's controversial. It's great.

00:53:46.099 --> 00:53:52.850
&gt;&gt; Worden: Well, yeah. Private industry will
probably have a role in space at some point.

00:53:52.850 --> 00:53:58.619
They might be the taxi cab to get to the International
Space Station. Private industry will not take

00:53:58.619 --> 00:54:05.900
us beyond that. They can't. They won't. Why?
What's the goal of private industry? Make

00:54:05.900 --> 00:54:12.270
a profit. If they can't see a profit in a
program, then they're probably not going to

00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:18.220
do it. They can see a profit in taking guys
up to the space station because they're customer,

00:54:18.220 --> 00:54:22.860
the U.S. government, is going to pay them.
My attitude about that is if we're going to

00:54:22.860 --> 00:54:27.960
pay somebody to take us to the International
Space Station and we're going to provide them

00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:32.810
with a profit to do that, we might as well
take that money do it ourselves. I don't believe

00:54:32.810 --> 00:54:39.920
in a third man, I think the flip side of that
is the government tends not to be very efficient

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:43.930
about things that they do so it costs a lot
more money and private industry's going to

00:54:43.930 --> 00:54:48.600
get right to the heart of it. But I'm also
concerned private industry is going to get

00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:53.190
the bare bone stuff to get a guy up there
and back. There may be some corners that get

00:54:53.190 --> 00:55:00.380
cut short. There may be some things that are
left out that shouldn't be. I don't know that

00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:07.980
for a fact. But I know that when I got a,
when I've got a project and it's got a cost

00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:12.750
limit to it and I got to do certain things
with that then I'm going to jam that program

00:55:12.750 --> 00:55:17.600
into there to make sure I do it for the money.
The government doesn't have that restriction.

00:55:17.600 --> 00:55:24.180
If it runs into a problem, it's going to fix
the problem. The government's interest in

00:55:24.180 --> 00:55:29.430
all of this is safety for the crew. Private
industry's interest in all of this is a profit.

00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:34.850
I see that as a big change. At the same time,
I don't see private industry ever going beyond

00:55:34.850 --> 00:55:44.430
the Earth orbit. Because what private company
is going to send a crew to Mars let's say

00:55:44.430 --> 00:55:49.901
on the off chance that there might be something
there that might be profitable? I don't see

00:55:49.901 --> 00:55:54.310
that happening. So the government's role in
all this is going the long range stuff and

00:55:54.310 --> 00:56:02.230
private industry is going to do just the Earth
orbital stuff. And so far there are some companies

00:56:02.230 --> 00:56:09.020
that are working on it. We'll see how they
do. I'm probably not as optimistic about it

00:56:09.020 --> 00:56:10.160
as I should be.

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:14.261
&gt;&gt; Male #5: And the second question very quickly.
It struck me earlier you mentioned when you

00:56:14.261 --> 00:56:19.040
were training and guiding the spaceship that
you guided this blue sort of ridge or blue

00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:24.330
line in the atmosphere. How do you train for
that on Earth? I can't imagine you saw the

00:56:24.330 --> 00:56:29.840
same thing down here as you saw up there.

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:37.620
&gt;&gt; Worden: It's projected on a screen. But
it was all connected to a very sophisticated

00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:45.560
computer program that measured all those things.
It was done at MIT at the Stark Draper labs

00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:54.450
and they designed the whole lab system that
we used. And I don't think we could have done

00:56:54.450 --> 00:57:01.130
it without them. You know, Draper labs started
doing inertial navigation for submarines years

00:57:01.130 --> 00:57:08.040
and years and years ago and they designed
ours too. Let me tell you a good example.

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:15.310
We're gone two weeks. We had one attitude,
we had one inertial reference if you will.

00:57:15.310 --> 00:57:25.130
It's a three-axis frame with a gyro on each
axis and we had to adjust that inertial reference

00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:29.750
frame as we went because it would drift. There's
no way you could prevent it from drifting

00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:36.160
a little bit. But what those guys at MIT did
for us is they worked out a program that kept

00:57:36.160 --> 00:57:43.260
track of the drift rates and after we had
a realigned the platform after a couple of

00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:49.430
days the computer then took over and pulsed
each of the three x's on the inertial reference

00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:53.940
platform just enough to take out the drift
that was in there. We never touched that thing

00:57:53.940 --> 00:57:59.120
again the whole flight. Now we had one gyro
onboard to go all the way to the Moon and

00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:04.390
back. The shuttle has three, okay, just to
go to the Earth's orbit. We had one computer.

00:58:04.390 --> 00:58:13.100
The shuttle had 4. Guess which has the greatest
probability of success? Ours. Of course the

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:19.280
problem is is we're either 100% or 0. You
take the shuttle you take the probability

00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:28.050
of success of the computer system in the shuttle
each of them are like 0.95%. Well, you got

00:58:28.050 --> 00:58:33.300
to multiply all four of them out and you got
a fairly low reliability number when you end

00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:37.590
up. And that's kind of the situation we found
out too. The philosophy back in the Apollo

00:58:37.590 --> 00:58:44.760
program was build one, test the heck out of
it, make sure it's right, and use it on the

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:50.920
flight. Now our gyro was probably ten years
old when we flew. It was an air bearing gyro,

00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:58.080
but it was only one. Guess what we had if
we lost the gyro, okay? Let's say we lost

00:58:58.080 --> 00:59:09.880
the gyro or we lost our computer in flight.
We lost something that where we lost any information

00:59:09.880 --> 00:59:14.990
we needed on where we were and where our attitude
was and all that. In other words we had no

00:59:14.990 --> 00:59:20.670
attitude no location. What did we do? Well,
we had a backup for that. Our back up was

00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:32.580
a telescope. Kind of. Actually, it was a World
War II; it was a World War II fighter optical

00:59:32.580 --> 00:59:41.780
gun site. And we had the crosshairs on a gun
site and we'd mount that in the window and

00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:45.470
you could line up the two cross hairs and
the ground would tell us which star to line

00:59:45.470 --> 00:59:49.340
up on. That would give us our attitude. It
doesn't make any difference what your role

00:59:49.340 --> 00:59:54.550
is as long as your central axis is pointing
to that star. And it would tell us how much

00:59:54.550 --> 00:59:58.820
to fire the engines, two feet per second,
or five feet per second on a certain direction

00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:04.730
that would get us back home. So we had a very
good way of getting back home even if we lost

01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:11.230
everything except the radio. But the attitude
was we're going to take something that's very,

01:00:11.230 --> 01:00:16.120
very reliable, we're going to test it to the
point where we are absolutely convinced it's

01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:20.790
going to work. We never had a problem in the
Apollo program going that way so it was kind

01:00:20.790 --> 01:00:22.600
of a neat thing.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:28.150
&gt;&gt;Male #6 Can you tell us a little bit about
your duties when you're alone in orbit and

01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:31.520
why the Apollo capsule required a babysitter?

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:35.029
&gt;&gt; Worden: Well, I'm sorry, I didn't get the.

01:00:35.029 --> 01:00:41.180
&gt;&gt; Male #6: Why did the Apollo capsule require
a babysitter? Why couldn't it be left unmanned?

01:00:41.180 --> 01:00:42.960
&gt;&gt;Worden: Left unmanned? You got to be kidding.
[laughter]

01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:45.130
&gt;&gt;Male #6: It was during Skylab.

01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:49.500
&gt;&gt; Worden: I don't agree. Constellation is
thinking about doing that and I do not agree

01:00:49.500 --> 01:00:57.760
with that. Like I said before, my example
of soup floating around inside, if something

01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:03.681
like that happens and that thing is unmanned,
you got a problem, a big problem. Something

01:01:03.681 --> 01:01:10.460
as simple as a little water leak in that that
command module could destroy it. The original

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:16.190
idea for Constellation was to go to the Moon,
send the whole crew to the surface, leave

01:01:16.190 --> 01:01:22.040
the command module in orbit, station keeping
by itself without somebody on board. I totally

01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:28.430
disagree with that because in six months you
better believe that something's going to go

01:01:28.430 --> 01:01:33.070
wrong. So I don't believe, I think that's
a very, very dangerous philosophy.

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:35.890
&gt;&gt; Eustace: You kept pretty busy up there
too.

01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:37.540
&gt;&gt;Worden: Well, I had-

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:40.420
&gt;&gt;Eustace: Your schedule in that command module
is grueling.

01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:46.940
&gt;&gt; Worden: We did. Basically I worked 20 hours
a day. I had a lot of things, some really

01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:53.490
exciting things too. But the basic stuff I
did was I photographed with the high resolution

01:01:53.490 --> 01:02:01.940
camera. Like on your Google Moon, I think
some of that's mine. And with the mapping

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:07.940
camera that had a laser altimeter that took
the altitude in the middle of the picture.

01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:14.310
Carried a whole bunch of remote sensing devices
that were on extendible poles, like I had

01:02:14.310 --> 01:02:22.780
an x-ray spectrometer, gamma ray spectrometer
had a mass spectrometer. I forget the other

01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:28.040
ones but we had five of them that I used to
scan the surface of the Moon. And the idea

01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:33.721
was these were the remote sensing devices
that were complimentary to the chemistry of

01:02:33.721 --> 01:02:40.010
the rocks we thought we'd see on the surface.
So when Dave and Jim brought rocks back they

01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:44.470
did a chemical composition analysis and then
they compared that with what we got from remote

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:49.270
sensing and now we can go to the Moon without
landing and find out what the chemical composition

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:53.970
of the surface is anywhere we want to look
just doing it remotely. So that was one of

01:02:53.970 --> 01:02:59.460
the things. So I'm, those poles are coming
in and out and all that. Tell you another

01:02:59.460 --> 01:03:07.099
little story. We had a mass spectrometer.
It was on a 30-foot pole that went out of

01:03:07.099 --> 01:03:11.790
the, you know to get it outside any influence
that the spacecraft might have. That was to

01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:22.490
check if there were any particles in lunar
orbit. So we're up there going round and round.

01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:27.230
Ground calls to me. I'm by myself up there.
Ground calls and they says, "We're picking

01:03:27.230 --> 01:03:30.859
up something on the mass spectrometer." "Oh,
that's interesting." "Something is until the

01:03:30.859 --> 01:03:36.560
atmosphere, we'll let you know." So they called
me back a few hours later and said we figured

01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:43.610
out what it is." I said, "Oh, okay what is
it?""Chemical composition it's urine." [laughter]

01:03:43.610 --> 01:03:50.320
And I said, "Gee, that's interesting since
we had just done a urine dump about four revolutions

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:56.130
before. So we're picking up ourselves in lunar
orbit as were goin' around. So I was very

01:03:56.130 --> 01:04:03.300
busy and I did a lot of visual observations.
We had really trained hard on the features

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:07.570
of the Moon because there was still a lot
of discussion about whether the features were

01:04:07.570 --> 01:04:14.160
formed by meteor impacts or by volcanism,
volcanoes. So we had a lot of that, as a matter

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:21.920
of fact, I found a field of cinder cones which
many of you know is kind of a last eruption.

01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:27.380
And in fact, when we got back that was verified
and they changed the landing site for Apollo

01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:34.480
17 to go to that area. That was kind of a
neat thing. I also took a lot of, I did some

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:41.040
really interesting photography I thought.
I did what we call low-light level photography.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:47.050
I don't know. You're all too young. You didn't
even know anything about film. But back in

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:54.150
those days, we carried film. And I had a,
I managed to carry on the flight a camera

01:04:54.150 --> 01:05:05.390
that was made by Nikon. It had a lens that
was a 1.01 lens which was like 99.99% clear.

01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:11.920
And I carried a film that was ASA of 5,000.
Film, normal film back in those days -- was

01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:17.230
like ASA 400, 300, 200 something like that.
I carried a film that was 5,000. It was a

01:05:17.230 --> 01:05:24.831
special film for very low-light phenomena.
And I guarantee you I could go outside of

01:05:24.831 --> 01:05:28.930
crew quarters down at the Cape and take a
picture of the parking lot where it's totally

01:05:28.930 --> 01:05:35.840
black. All there was was sky glow and it would
look like daylight. This film was that good.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:42.060
So I took pictures of very low-light phenomenon.
And I'll tell you what they are. One of them

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:47.020
are your LaGrange points and if you know your
LaGrange points there are five of them. Three

01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:53.760
of them in a row on a line through the center
of the Earth and the center of the Moon. There

01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:59.130
are 2 offset the two offset are stable equilibrium
points. There's a thing in this country called

01:05:59.130 --> 01:06:06.740
the L 5 society which is focused on Le grange
point No. 5 as being the perfect place for

01:06:06.740 --> 01:06:16.850
a space station which is correct by the way.
Because it's stable, it's stable equilibrium.

01:06:16.850 --> 01:06:21.710
It's a stable equilibrium point. If you put
something there, it's going to stay there.

01:06:21.710 --> 01:06:28.680
If you perturb something at that point, push
it out, then all the dynamics of that point

01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:35.960
pull it back in. That's true there should
be a dust cloud at L 5, right? There should

01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:40.450
be something there if you could get a picture
of it. Nobody ever got a picture of this.

01:06:40.450 --> 01:06:48.010
So I got out with my low-light camera and
I did ten second exposures with ASA 5,000

01:06:48.010 --> 01:06:52.720
film. That's unbelievable. You cannot stop
the smear. You can't keep the spacecraft that

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:59.390
steady for five or ten seconds. But even with
the smear, yes there is a cloud of dust there.

01:06:59.390 --> 01:07:06.020
So we know. The other thing I took these low-light
double pictures of is a thing called the Gegenschein.

01:07:06.020 --> 01:07:15.020
The Gegenschein is outside the last planet.
It's a ring of loose unconsolidated rock.

01:07:15.020 --> 01:07:19.420
When the solar system was formed it's rock
that never formed a planet and it's outside.

01:07:19.420 --> 01:07:24.130
And all it is is this rink of rock and if
you go to the highest mountain in the Himalayas

01:07:24.130 --> 01:07:31.580
or in the Andes or somewhere like that, you
get out of most of the atmosphere you can

01:07:31.580 --> 01:07:37.841
sometimes see it because what you see is reflection
of sunlight off all though particles. Got

01:07:37.841 --> 01:07:42.990
pictures of that too. So there's a lot of
really, really interesting stuff we did in

01:07:42.990 --> 01:07:48.720
addition to focusing on the Moon itself. I'll
tell you something that blew my mind. There

01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:53.560
was a portion of my orbit where I was on the
backside and on the dark side at the same

01:07:53.560 --> 01:08:01.020
time. It was just like a pie-shaped wedge
around the side of the Moon. And from that

01:08:01.020 --> 01:08:07.480
vantage point the thing that really captured
my imagination was the rest of the universe

01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:11.730
out there. All of a sudden we had 37 stars
that were the brightest stars in the sky that

01:08:11.730 --> 01:08:17.000
I used as navigation stars. When I got to
that sector of the orbit around the Moon I

01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:22.000
couldn't find them because there were so many
stars. I could not pick out an individual

01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:28.540
star anywhere because there was just a wash
of light. You see every star and you can't

01:08:28.540 --> 01:08:33.620
pick out an individual star. It's absolutely
amazing. You never believe what the faint

01:08:33.620 --> 01:08:40.790
stars get cut off by the scene or the absorption
through the atmosphere. So what we really

01:08:40.790 --> 01:08:45.790
look at through the atmosphere here is the
brightest stars. You get outside the atmosphere,

01:08:45.790 --> 01:08:51.360
they're all coming at you. And I could absolutely
define the horizon of the Moon by the light

01:08:51.360 --> 01:08:56.880
that was cut off, not by the light shining
on it. So that made me do a little research

01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:03.609
and I'm sure there are people here that know
this a lot better than I know it. What it

01:09:03.609 --> 01:09:07.790
made me think about is, "What's the rest of
the universe like?" It's one thing to look

01:09:07.790 --> 01:09:13.171
back at the Earth, we come from it, we know.
It's the most colorful thing in the Solar

01:09:13.171 --> 01:09:19.230
System. When you look at the rest of the universe,
you got to put on a different hat. Realize

01:09:19.230 --> 01:09:24.700
we're a part of the Milky Way galaxy. We look
at through it sideways. We don't look from

01:09:24.700 --> 01:09:29.319
it on top. We go through it sideways. And
the estimate of the number anybody know how

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:32.330
many stars are in the Milky Way galaxy? Anybody
got an idea?

01:09:32.330 --> 01:09:34.660
&gt;&gt;Audience: 200 billion.

01:09:34.660 --> 01:09:43.230
&gt;&gt;Worden: Exactly. 200 billion, 200 billion
with a B and I've seen estimates as high as

01:09:43.230 --> 01:09:50.020
400 billion. But I think 200 billion is a
reasonable number. 200 billion stars in our

01:09:50.020 --> 01:09:54.970
own little galaxy? C'mon. Now how many galaxies
are out there?

01:09:54.970 --> 01:09:57.100
&gt;&gt;Audience: 100 billion.

01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:04.390
&gt;&gt;Worden: There you go. And that's only because
that's as far as we can see. So you got 100

01:10:04.390 --> 01:10:09.050
billion times 200 billion. There are a few
stars out there. [laughter]

01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:10.670
&gt;&gt;Eustace: You, you-

01:10:10.670 --> 01:10:18.520
&gt;&gt;Worden: The whole point is, we as people
as a thinking species, we don't have a clue.

01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:24.230
We don't have a clue. Anybody wants to talk
about search for extraterrestrial intelligence?

01:10:24.230 --> 01:10:30.630
Right on man. It's out there. Now, people
ask me about UFOs, I say, "bring me a piece

01:10:30.630 --> 01:10:36.239
of one. That's the only way you're going to
convince me." But is there life out there?

01:10:36.239 --> 01:10:39.900
Absolutely. No question about it. Probably
a lot smarter than we are. That's why they

01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:40.900
don't come.

01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:41.900
[laughter]

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:44.190
&gt;&gt; Eustace: Okay. With that I'd like to thank.

01:10:44.190 --> 01:10:44.580
[Applause]
