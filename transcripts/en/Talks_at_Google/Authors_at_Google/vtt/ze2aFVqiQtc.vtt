MALE SPEAKER: OK,
so welcome everybody

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.010
here in Mountain View.

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.715
And to our Googlers tuning
in around the world, good day

00:00:07.715 --> 00:00:09.530
to you as well.

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.520
I have the privilege today of
introducing Anil Ananthaswamy.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.660
He's a consultant for "New
Scientist Magazine," where

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.790
he has also worked as a staff
writer and deputy news editor.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.990
His writing has also appeared
in "National Geographic News,"

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.390
"Discover Magazine,"
"The Independent,"

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.140
and the "Times
Online" in the UK.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.580
Anil was a guest
columnist for PBS's "Nova"

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.950
on their "The Nature
of Reality" blog.

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.450
He has a master of science from
the University of Washington

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.920
at Seattle, a bachelor's
from the Indian Institute

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.090
of Technology in Madras.

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.340
And he worked as a software
engineer in Silicon Valley

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.500
before training as a
journalist at UC Santa Cruz.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.496
He's in good company today.

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:52.580
Anil win the UK
Institute of Physics,

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.200
Physics Journalism Award,
and the British Association

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:58.980
of Science Writers Award for
Best Investigative Journalism.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.640
His first book titled,
"The Edge of Physics:

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.410
A Journey to Earth's
Extremes to Unlock

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.160
the Secrets of
the Universe," was

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.730
voted Book of the Year in
2010 by "Physics World."

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.330
And he also delivered a
popular TED talk in 2010

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.430
titled "What it Takes to
do Extreme Astrophysics."

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.390
Today, he's here to talk about
his latest book, "The Man Who

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.980
Wasn't There: Investigations
Into the Strange New Science

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.450
of the Self."

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.861
Please join me in welcoming
Anil to the podium.

00:01:26.861 --> 00:01:29.687
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.710
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: Sajit,
and thank you, everyone.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.750
This is indeed a great
pleasure to be here.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.370
As Sajit said, I used to
be a software engineer.

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:46.220
So it's particularly nice
to come and speak at Google.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.100
I initially was wondering
whether I should give

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.250
a presentation or do a reading.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.990
And then after
talking with Sajit,

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.940
we figured that
what I'll do is just

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.560
talk about the book in
conceptual terms for about

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.380
25 minutes.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.480
And then we can discuss.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.980
Sajit has some
back up questions.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:06.300
But if you have
questions, then we

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.300
can dive into the
various issues.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.990
And I'm sure the topic is such
that each one of us, because

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.370
for each one of us is a
self, we will have questions

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.390
about what that means.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.780
So the book is called
"The Man Who Wasn't There:

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.670
Investigations Into the Strange
New science of the Self."

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.950
And basically, what I'm trying
to do in this book is really

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.865
take a look at
what neuroscience,

00:02:31.865 --> 00:02:35.410
neuropsychology, psychiatry--
all these disciplines

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.260
are telling us about
the nature of the self.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.540
So if you have read books
on the self-- the philosophy

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.380
of the self over the
last few decades--

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.160
you would most likely have
come across this quote

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:52.290
by David Hume.

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:56.060
He was an 18th century
Scottish philosopher.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.770
And he was writing about
his notion of the self.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.610
And he writes, "When I enter
most intimately into what

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:07.280
I call myself, I always stumble
on some particular perception

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.510
or other of heat, or cold,
light, or shade, love

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.490
or hatred, pain or pleasure.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.870
I never can catch myself at
any time without a perception

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.300
and never can observe
anything but the perception."

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.680
And Hume traditionally
falls into what philosophers

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.420
would call the no-self camp.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.190
He's basically saying that if
I try to examine within myself,

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.000
the thing that is doing
the perceiving-- the thing

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.520
that is experiencing
the perceptions-- he

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.140
says he's unable to find
anything but the perceptions.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.350
So he in some sense he is saying
that the sense we all have off

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.550
being an eye that is
experiencing-- the eye that

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:51.400
is the subject of
experiences for him

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.260
is something that comes out of
just the bundle of perceptions

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:55.900
that we are.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.930
So he falls into--
for most philosophers

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.690
today when they look
at what he said,

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.190
they would categorize
him as someone

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.030
who says there is no self.

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.630
This whole search for
the nature of the self

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.380
goes back a long way.

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:11.470
It's not just a
modern obsession.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.210
It's been something
that people have been

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.550
wondering about for millennia.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:16.089
And this is another example.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:20.130
This comes from the
philosophical traditions

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:23.670
of India, which as a
country has been maybe

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.560
sometimes unreasonably obsessed
with the nature of the self.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.140
But it has been.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:33.470
And there is from-- this is
a poem from eighth century.

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:35.910
It's a poem of six stanzas.

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.060
And it's called the
song of liberation.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.420
And, basically, the approach
that this particular tradition

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.820
within India takes to
try to answer who am I

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.860
is by looking at
things that you're not.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:51.140
So it's basically
saying, I'm not this.

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.880
I'm not this.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:52.570
I'm not this.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:55.110
So maybe what's left
over will be what I am.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:58.010
So in the way each stanza
progresses, it basically

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.280
identifies the things
that one is not.

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:04.510
So the poem is saying I'm not
the mind, nor the intellect,

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:09.010
nor any entity that identifies
self with ears, tongue, nose,

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:13.370
or the eyes-- not even proceeded
by space, light, or the wind--

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:14.200
I am.

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.650
So in this particular poem,
the last line of each stanza

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:21.500
is an answer to what I am.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.970
But it is an answer
particular to that tradition

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.460
within Indian philosophy.

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.234
And even within
India, for instance,

00:05:27.234 --> 00:05:28.650
there are numerous
traditions that

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.854
have examined this question.

00:05:29.854 --> 00:05:31.270
And each one has
their own answer.

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:34.174
So the point is not
to focus on the answer

00:05:34.174 --> 00:05:35.590
given by this
particular tradition

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.215
because they have
their own take on it.

00:05:37.215 --> 00:05:39.920
And it's an article of
faith after a point.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.580
But I'm just pointing
out that this

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.340
is a question that has
obsessed all of humanity

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.940
for millennia, literally.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:52.450
And in some sense,
it is the question

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.160
that I'm asking in
the book-- who am I?

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.670
And looking specifically
at what neuroscience

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.080
is telling us about.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.560
But before we get into
talking about some

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.180
of the neuropsychological,
psychiatric conditions

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.100
that help us
understand a little bit

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.630
about the nature
of the self, what

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:15.320
is it that we're talking about
when we talk of the self.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.880
And here's something
that philosophers

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.070
like to talk about.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.590
So I'll set that
up a little bit.

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:22.500
And then we'll come
to what lay people

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.730
like us might appreciate more.

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.940
So for philosophers,
there's something

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.250
called synchronic unity.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.820
So if you think of
what we are right

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.070
now-- you are seeing something.

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.130
You're hearing something.

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:36.570
You're probably feeling
the touch of your clothes

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:37.910
on your skin.

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.920
So they are tactile sensations.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:43.730
And what's not trivial
and quite amazing

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.190
is the fact that the
person seeing something

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:49.480
is the same as a person
hearing something.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:51.809
And it's the same
person feeling the touch

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:53.350
on the skin-- feeling
the temperature

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.050
of the air on your skin.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.660
So there is a certain
unity to your experiences.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.610
It's not like someone is hearing
and you don't have a sensation

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.550
that, oh, someone else
is hearing the sounds

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:07.230
and someone else is feeling
some other sensation.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.130
All the sensations that
your body is receiving

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.120
is being experienced
by the same entity.

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.190
This might seem
very trivial to us

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.150
because that's how
we experience life.

00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:18.200
But, actually, from a
philosophical perspective,

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:19.610
it's quite a big, big deal.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:22.120
There is a certain unity
to that experience.

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.920
From a neurobiological
perspective,

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.900
it's also a big deal
to try and explain

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.950
how come all of these sensations
feel like they're being

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:30.880
experienced by the same entity.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:32.850
I'm not saying
person-- same entity.

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:34.350
What is that thing?

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:36.580
So philosophers
call it synchronic

00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.730
unity-- this unity at
this present moment.

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:41.550
All your experiences
have that unity.

00:07:41.550 --> 00:07:43.550
There's also another
kind of unity.

00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:47.980
And, again, if you think about
who you are in your head,

00:07:47.980 --> 00:07:51.800
if you think back to you when
you were four years old or 10

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.830
years old and also
think into the future

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:59.160
and imagine your future
self, those rememberings

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:01.940
and imaginings are going to
bring up emotions-- bring up

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:03.650
perceptions in your mind.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.050
And, again, if you
really ponder upon that,

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:09.730
all those perceptions--
whatever arises in your mind,

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.540
again, feel like they're
happening to the same entity.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.190
You don't feel like
your 10-year-old self

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.020
is something or
someone different

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:18.200
than your present self.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:21.690
And the imagined future
itself doesn't feel like it

00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.630
someone different.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.470
It is still being experienced
as things that are happening

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.824
or happened to the same entity.

00:08:28.824 --> 00:08:30.240
So this is another
kind of unity--

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.919
a unity that spans time and
it's called synchronic unity.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.299
And, again, philosophers
wonder and worry about this.

00:08:38.299 --> 00:08:39.354
How come?

00:08:39.354 --> 00:08:40.179
Sorry?

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:43.334
AUDIENCE: You said
the first thing was--

00:08:43.334 --> 00:08:45.750
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: Oh, sorry,
diacrhonic-- the second one.

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.810
Thank you.

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:50.330
The second one is
diachronic unity.

00:08:50.330 --> 00:08:52.400
And, again, it's
not a trivial thing

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:54.524
to try and explain
neurobiologically how

00:08:54.524 --> 00:08:55.690
does the brain achieve this?

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.650
Or if indeed it's
the brain doing it.

00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.534
How does it happen?

00:08:59.534 --> 00:09:00.950
So these are the
kind of questions

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:03.076
that when you talk of the
self from a philosophical

00:09:03.076 --> 00:09:05.325
perspective, these are the
two big things that they're

00:09:05.325 --> 00:09:06.340
trying to explain.

00:09:06.340 --> 00:09:08.680
Is what is it behind this unity?

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:12.397
Why does it feel like that there
is same entity experiencing

00:09:12.397 --> 00:09:13.980
all the things that
we're experiencing

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:18.730
right now and over time.

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:22.990
For the rest of us, if you
leave philosophers aside,

00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:26.050
if you look at how William
James-- William James

00:09:26.050 --> 00:09:28.900
was a great American
psychologist and physician

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.700
who wrote a lot about the self.

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.630
He kind of talked about
facets of the self.

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:37.590
So self-- each
one of us is never

00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:39.390
the same thing all the time.

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.530
We have different
aspects-- different facets

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:43.760
that show up in
different situations.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.410
So one of the
things James did was

00:09:46.410 --> 00:09:48.180
to divide the self
into something

00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.560
called the material me, which is
everything that is me or mine.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.970
So anything your mind that has
a sense of mindness whether it's

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:58.640
your body whether it's your
relationships whether it's

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:00.980
things you possess-- all
of those things for him

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.040
were the material me.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:05.630
He then talked of
the social self.

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.330
Every time you have a social
interaction with someone,

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.490
there is a sense you
have of what you are.

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:13.337
That is specific to
that interaction.

00:10:13.337 --> 00:10:14.670
You may be talking to your boss.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.470
He'll have a certain kind of
feeling about what you are.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.800
You will be talking to
someone who works for you.

00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:21.170
You'll have a different
sense for what you are.

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:24.930
So social self is a
very integral part

00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:26.590
of our larger sense of self.

00:10:26.590 --> 00:10:29.350
He then talked of something
called the spiritual self--

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.436
the sort of internal psychic
faculties we all have.

00:10:33.436 --> 00:10:35.310
So that's one way of
thinking about yourself.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:38.850
You can slice and dice
how we think of ourselves

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:42.390
into different facets.

00:10:42.390 --> 00:10:44.930
The division, or the
kind of categorization

00:10:44.930 --> 00:10:47.960
that I really like in terms
of trying to understand what

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.240
we are is this second one,
which is dividing the self

00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:53.350
into something called
the narrative self

00:10:53.350 --> 00:10:54.856
and the bodily self.

00:10:54.856 --> 00:10:56.230
The narrative self
is the easiest

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:58.450
to understand in some
sense because if I

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.830
were to ask you who are you?

00:11:01.830 --> 00:11:05.010
Some of you will say,
oh, I work at Google.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:06.070
I was at Yahoo.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:09.630
I'm planning to go to Bing--
whatever your ideas might

00:11:09.630 --> 00:11:10.850
be about yourself.

00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:14.080
But I don't even know
whether Bing exists.

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:21.610
So the point is that you
have a story in your heads

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.040
about who you are.

00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.800
And it's a story
not only that you

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.140
tell others about who you are.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.800
But it's a story that
you tell yourself.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:31.910
It's not even a cognitive
telling of the story.

00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:33.870
It's how you feel
about yourself.

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:35.960
There is a narrative
in your head.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.860
And it's a cognitive narrative.

00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:41.990
And it's also embodied-- there
are aspects of one's narrative

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.210
self that is in the body.

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:47.700
For instance, if you learned
how to ride a bicycle.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.140
Now, you can tell someone-- oh,
I know how to ride a bicycle.

00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.760
That's a cognitive
retelling of your story

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.320
because that is
part of who you are.

00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:58.660
But the ability to ride a
bicycle is actually embodied.

00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:01.121
It's not something that
you consciously recall.

00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:02.120
It's there in your body.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:03.453
And it's part of your narrative.

00:12:03.453 --> 00:12:06.040
So there are many, many
aspects of who we are,

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:10.639
which is really deeply
embedded in the body.

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:12.180
And you can think
of all these things

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:13.410
as forming your narrative.

00:12:13.410 --> 00:12:15.860
But there is another
aspect of yourself.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.860
If your narrative were
to completely shut down--

00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:20.270
if you forget the
fact that we have here

00:12:20.270 --> 00:12:23.960
sitting at Google
completely let go

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.510
of all the thoughts about
the story that you are,

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:28.950
you still are a
body experiencing

00:12:28.950 --> 00:12:30.620
being here and now.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:35.020
There is a sense I have of being
in this volume of space which

00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:36.780
is occupied by my body.

00:12:36.780 --> 00:12:38.080
I have a sense of ownership.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.800
I look at my body, and
it feels like mine.

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:44.240
And I have a perspective that
I'm looking out at the world

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.170
from within my head
from behind my eyes.

00:12:47.170 --> 00:12:50.300
And I also have the sense
that what I'm perceiving

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:54.080
is private to me-- that
I have a first-person

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.190
perspective on the world.

00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:57.694
And each one of you
looking this way,

00:12:57.694 --> 00:12:59.860
you're all kind of aware
that even though you're all

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.818
looking at the same thing,
you all have a sense

00:13:01.818 --> 00:13:05.620
that your sense of what you're
seeing is private to you.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:10.040
And that's part of
what the bodily self is

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.410
that there is something--

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.506
AUDIENCE: What
your saying is it's

00:13:14.506 --> 00:13:15.964
like what you would
perceive if you

00:13:15.964 --> 00:13:18.044
had memories about your
past or who you were?

00:13:18.044 --> 00:13:20.210
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: Yeah,
assume that for some reason

00:13:20.210 --> 00:13:24.294
your narrative shut down,
and this is a good example

00:13:24.294 --> 00:13:24.960
that I gave you.

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.990
You had amnesia and you
completely forgot everything

00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.410
about who you were in terms
of the story that you are.

00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:33.680
Your memories are gone.

00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:36.024
But you would still
be a bodily self.

00:13:36.024 --> 00:13:37.440
So this is another
way of thinking

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:39.520
about what the self might be.

00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:41.290
How does the brain
and the body together,

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.890
how do they combine to create
these aspects of the self?

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:50.520
So basically now given
these kinds of definitions,

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:53.180
if you were to read about
the self and philosophies

00:13:53.180 --> 00:13:55.060
of the self and
neuroscientists, there

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:57.520
are still arguments going on
about whether there is a self

00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.730
or whether there is no self.

00:13:58.730 --> 00:14:00.300
Is the self an illusion?

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.590
And if so, who's illusion is it?

00:14:02.590 --> 00:14:04.370
So these are--
these are arguments

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:06.930
that continue to go on.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:10.470
And one of the things
that even if you go back

00:14:10.470 --> 00:14:14.210
maybe 30, 40 years
within neuroscience,

00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:17.690
there was this idea that
the self is something

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:19.550
separate from the
brain and body.

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:23.170
So one of the questions
about whether there is a self

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:27.560
or whether there is no self
was about this question of

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:29.740
is the self a
fundamental constituent

00:14:29.740 --> 00:14:33.110
of nature just as electrons
and quarks and gluons

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:36.760
are fundamental aspects
of the material world.

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:38.650
So if the body and
brain went away,

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.300
would the self still exist?

00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:45.160
Does the self persist beyond
the depth of the brain and body?

00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:48.020
These were questions
that we're being asked

00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:53.900
and in some sense, what
philosophers call ontology,

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:57.220
the self-- what they were
asking is does the self

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:59.630
have its own unique
ontological status?

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:04.230
Can it be part of as a
fundamental aspect of nature?

00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:07.130
And that argument
now-- pretty much

00:15:07.130 --> 00:15:10.170
most neuroscientists and
philosophers would say no.

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:11.840
That's not true.

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:14.900
The self is really
something that

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.840
arises from the brain and body.

00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:21.510
And it doesn't persist
after you're dead.

00:15:21.510 --> 00:15:23.580
So there is no
ontological status

00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:27.860
that it has that is separate
from the fundamental aspects

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:32.760
of the material world.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:34.470
But that doesn't
mean that the debate

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:36.230
about whether there
is a self are no self

00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:38.460
has gone away completely.

00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:41.290
And in some sense, what I
tried to do in this book

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.110
is to take the leaders
along the journey

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:47.190
by looking at various
neuropsychological conditions

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:50.680
to appreciate what is the
heart of the argument.

00:15:50.680 --> 00:15:52.010
There is still an argument.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.950
But it's not clear
from the outset

00:15:53.950 --> 00:15:57.986
if you just read stuff in
newspapers about the self

00:15:57.986 --> 00:16:00.360
being an illusion, what is it
that they're arguing about?

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:02.980
So the whole book is an
effort to bring the reader

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:04.860
to the point where
you can say, ah,

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:07.070
that's what we're arguing about.

00:16:07.070 --> 00:16:08.290
The argument still persists.

00:16:08.290 --> 00:16:11.970
It's not resolved because we
don't have empirical evidence.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:15.580
But it's a very, very
subtle and fine point

00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:17.720
that they are fighting
over, the philosophers,

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.670
which is what they do.

00:16:21.230 --> 00:16:23.740
So disturbances of the
self-- in the book I

00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:28.020
look at these eight
different conditions.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:28.937
I'll talk about a few.

00:16:28.937 --> 00:16:31.270
I don't think we'll have time
to go through all of them.

00:16:31.270 --> 00:16:32.700
But I'll just mention a few.

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.420
But these other ones--
Cotard's syndrome

00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.240
in which people believe
and are convinced

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:39.710
that they don't exist.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:42.290
Alzheimer's is a disease,
which unfortunately a lot of us

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:44.485
would be familiar
because we know someone

00:16:44.485 --> 00:16:46.070
who is suffering from it.

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:49.300
Alzheimer's, as a disease,
destroys the narrative self.

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:52.170
Body integrity
identity disorder has

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:54.570
to do with notions of
ownership of body parts

00:16:54.570 --> 00:16:57.780
and tells us something
about the bodily self.

00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:01.120
Schizophrenia tells us
something about what's

00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:02.270
called the sense of agency.

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:04.190
I'll come to this in a minute.

00:17:04.190 --> 00:17:06.369
Depersonalization disorder
tells about the role

00:17:06.369 --> 00:17:08.349
of emotions and the self.

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:12.220
Autism tells us something
about self awareness

00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.950
in terms of being able
to read someone's mind

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:19.440
to have a sense of
oneself and also something

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.280
about the bodily self.

00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:24.250
Autoscopic phenomena are things
like out-of-body experiences,

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.050
which we have all heard about.

00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:28.050
And out-of-body
experiences tell us

00:17:28.050 --> 00:17:32.500
a lot about how the
brain actually constructs

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:33.910
the in-body experience.

00:17:33.910 --> 00:17:36.740
In order for us to have
an out-of-body experience,

00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:39.010
we should first be in-body,
which we are right now,

00:17:39.010 --> 00:17:41.740
hopefully, all of us
are in-body right now.

00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:46.180
And by looking at
how the brain manages

00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:47.610
to create out-of-body
experiences,

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:49.440
we actually learn
a lot about how

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.170
we end up being in this body.

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:54.700
And then there's a very
paradoxical condition

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:58.780
called ecstatic epilepsy
where people feel ecstatic,

00:17:58.780 --> 00:18:02.270
joyful, blissful.

00:18:02.270 --> 00:18:06.320
And they feel their body state
and environment very intensely.

00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:07.810
But, paradoxically,
they also feel

00:18:07.810 --> 00:18:09.440
like some boundary
between themselves

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:11.070
and the outer world
has disappeared.

00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:16.120
And they feel one with the
larger Universe-- the other.

00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:16.700
Yeah?

00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.990
AUDIENCE: What
triggers [INAUDIBLE]?

00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.210
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY:
Meditation can induce

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:23.310
autoscopic phenomena, yes.

00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:26.510
You can have out-of-body
experiences while meditating.

00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:29.430
But this is purely
a neurological or

00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:32.760
neuropsychological condition
that I'm talking about.

00:18:32.760 --> 00:18:36.800
So let's look at a few of these.

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.680
This is one of the
most intriguing ones.

00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.240
I don't know how many
of you've heard of this.

00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.150
Cotard syndrome is
a condition that

00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:46.810
was identified by a
French doctor called

00:18:46.810 --> 00:18:48.580
Jules Cotard in the late 1800s.

00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:50.932
And it's a constellation
of symptoms

00:18:50.932 --> 00:18:52.640
that have to come
together for the person

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:54.980
to be diagnosed
as having Cotards.

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:59.100
But the most intriguing
symptom in that syndrome

00:18:59.100 --> 00:19:02.500
is this feeling, or
conviction, that the person

00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.680
has that they are dead--
that they don't exist.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.330
And I'm seeing a few
puzzled faces already.

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.890
And that's exactly how it should
be because what does that mean?

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:17.840
So in some sense, all of us
here are probably, hopefully,

00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:20.390
really convinced
we exist, right?

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.380
It should not be
a matter of doubt.

00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:23.380
We do.

00:19:23.380 --> 00:19:26.784
I mean, it is our-- it's not
even something you'll question.

00:19:26.784 --> 00:19:28.200
Now, imagine someone
sitting right

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:30.158
next to you who was
equally convinced that they

00:19:30.158 --> 00:19:31.430
don't exist.

00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:33.790
And it happens.

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:36.404
So, fortunately, it's an
extremely rare condition.

00:19:36.404 --> 00:19:37.820
Only a few hundred
cases have been

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.370
recorded in medical literature.

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.130
And it's also a state
in which the person

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:44.560
experiencing Cotard's
is extremely depressed.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.540
And it's a depression
that the psychiatrist

00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:54.330
that I've talked to say that
it is far worse than even

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.650
the depression that
we are traditionally

00:19:56.650 --> 00:19:59.322
aware of that people who
are clinically depressed

00:19:59.322 --> 00:20:00.030
would experience.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:03.690
This is something that goes
well beyond that sometimes.

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:06.130
But there is some
alteration in the way

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:07.950
they perceive their
own body states

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:11.120
and their own
emotions and feelings.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.130
It's kind of a
complete dampening

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:15.560
down off the vividness
off our experience

00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:20.090
of being a body that is
causing this perception

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.740
to arise in their brain
that they don't exist.

00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:28.130
In addition to that, they
seem to have some things that

00:20:28.130 --> 00:20:29.630
have gone wrong
in the brain where

00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:31.270
some rational
aspects of the brain

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:35.050
are also not functioning
well, which then prevents them

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.220
from rationally shooting
down this perception that

00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:38.912
has arisen within them.

00:20:38.912 --> 00:20:40.370
So it's kind of a
two-factor theory

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:43.040
to explain you know why
that might be happening.

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:45.820
From a perspective of
the self and philosophy,

00:20:45.820 --> 00:20:48.110
it's a very
intriguing phenomenon

00:20:48.110 --> 00:20:51.870
because you can still
ask, OK, so who or what is

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.970
the I that says I don't exist?

00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:55.080
Right?

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:58.900
So just like all of
us will say, I exist.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:00.360
They can say, I don't exist.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.760
There is still an I that
experiences either existence

00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:05.390
or nonexistence.

00:21:05.390 --> 00:21:12.770
So in terms of understanding how
neurobiologically the brain is

00:21:12.770 --> 00:21:16.090
bringing about this the sense
of being an I-- the I is still

00:21:16.090 --> 00:21:18.550
there, even in Cotard's, even
the person who is saying I

00:21:18.550 --> 00:21:21.540
don't exist, the I still exists.

00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:22.291
So what is that I?

00:21:22.291 --> 00:21:23.123
That's the question.

00:21:23.123 --> 00:21:24.680
In some sense, that
is the question

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:26.790
that this pursued
throughout this book

00:21:26.790 --> 00:21:28.630
by looking at the
various conditions

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:34.180
and trying to understand
what aspects of ourselves

00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:37.250
are integral to the I
and what aspects are not.

00:21:37.250 --> 00:21:39.140
So remember the
earlier discussion.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:40.890
You can start by
saying I'm not this.

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:41.610
I'm not this.

00:21:41.610 --> 00:21:42.700
I'm not this.

00:21:42.700 --> 00:21:43.860
So you can keep doing that.

00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:47.200
And you can-- and these
neuropsychological conditions

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.730
allow us to kind of look
at ourselves in that way

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:53.720
by saying, OK, I'm not the sense
of existence or nonexistence

00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.170
because that seems to
be a property that I'm

00:21:56.170 --> 00:21:59.490
aware of that is still an I that
can experience that existence

00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:00.260
or nonexistence.

00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:02.620
So the question
remains what is the I?

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.710
So am I a narrative in the
sense that am I my story?

00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:12.030
We were just talking about
sort of the larger story

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:13.690
in our heads about who we are.

00:22:13.690 --> 00:22:17.040
It turns out if you--
Alzhiemer's disease,

00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.940
one of the things
it does, it stops--

00:22:21.940 --> 00:22:24.340
it basically prevents
short-term memory

00:22:24.340 --> 00:22:26.430
from becoming long-term memory.

00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:30.510
It's essentially you're
unable to form new memories.

00:22:30.510 --> 00:22:33.660
Now, when you think about
your narrative self,

00:22:33.660 --> 00:22:35.800
a key component of
that is the ability

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:38.140
to remember what
has happened to you.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.440
You have to be able
to string together

00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:46.320
episodes in your life to kind of
give it-- form that narrative.

00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.320
Now, if a disease like
Alzheimer's comes along

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:51.640
and basically puts a halt to
the formation of new memories,

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:53.950
in some sense it has
stopped the narrative self

00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:55.500
from growing any further.

00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:58.840
So at the disease onset, it's
almost like the narrative self

00:22:58.840 --> 00:22:59.830
stops forming.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:02.710
But unfortunately, Alzehimer's
doesn't stop at that point.

00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:06.410
The ravages of the disease are
such that it actually starts

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.070
eating away existing memories.

00:23:08.070 --> 00:23:10.870
So in a sense, it starts
scrambling the narrative

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:14.150
that you already had and
eventually pretty much

00:23:14.150 --> 00:23:16.520
completely destroying that.

00:23:16.520 --> 00:23:19.630
So now if you talk to
caregivers and people who

00:23:19.630 --> 00:23:23.090
take care of patients and
people with Alzheimer's, they're

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:25.140
going to say things
like, especially

00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:27.780
when the person is in the
late stages of the condition,

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.890
they'll say things like,
oh, there's no one in there.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:32.160
You will hear these phrases.

00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:34.910
The self, the person
that I knew is gone.

00:23:34.910 --> 00:23:38.140
So they have-- at
least from the outside,

00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:40.810
we have this impression that
whoever was the person that you

00:23:40.810 --> 00:23:44.760
knew is no more because there
is almost no interaction with

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:47.980
the person, you can't-- you
can't infer anything about what

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.110
might be happening within
the person suffering from

00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:51.420
Alzheimer's.

00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:53.920
It's very clear that the
narrative self is gone.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.990
Now, philosophers,
there are philosophers

00:23:55.990 --> 00:23:58.324
who argue that all that
we are is a narrative.

00:23:58.324 --> 00:23:59.490
You take away the narrative.

00:23:59.490 --> 00:24:02.630
And there is no I. The I comes
about because of the narrative,

00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:05.070
whether it's
cognitive or embodied.

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:07.870
And Alzheimer's is forcing
us to ask that question

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:11.370
very seriously because
once the narrative is gone,

00:24:11.370 --> 00:24:13.810
once the person is
unable to have a story

00:24:13.810 --> 00:24:16.670
to relate to oneself
or to others,

00:24:16.670 --> 00:24:19.110
does it mean that there
is no one in there?

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.640
Really?

00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:22.640
I mean, in the sense is there
no one there feeling pain

00:24:22.640 --> 00:24:23.770
as their own?

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:26.410
Is there no one in there
feeling hunger as their own.

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:28.620
Can they not feel their
own body as their own,

00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:30.224
even though the story is gone?

00:24:30.224 --> 00:24:31.890
That is an unanswered
question right now

00:24:31.890 --> 00:24:34.250
because we can't
communicate with people

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:37.320
with end stage Alzheimer's and
ask these questions of them.

00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.790
And it's a very
debilitating condition.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:44.079
But it does throw up
a really important

00:24:44.079 --> 00:24:45.870
philosophical and
neuro-scientific question

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:51.150
about what remains after
the narrative is gone.

00:24:51.150 --> 00:24:54.212
And for that, you can
start kind of looking at

00:24:54.212 --> 00:24:56.420
in order to understand what
might be happening there.

00:24:56.420 --> 00:24:58.795
There are other conditions
that tell us a little bit more

00:24:58.795 --> 00:25:02.320
about how the self
might be put together.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:05.730
So body integrity
identity disorder,

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:09.760
this is also probably a
condition that some of you

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.440
may have heard about
it, but not others.

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:15.410
So I'll just read out
this quote from a book

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:20.465
by Oliver Sacks He had an
accident after which he

00:25:20.465 --> 00:25:21.090
felt like this.

00:25:21.090 --> 00:25:22.836
And he wrote about it.

00:25:22.836 --> 00:25:24.710
"The leg suddenly assumed
an eerie character,

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.680
or more precisely,
if less evocatively,

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.040
lost all its character and
became a foreign, inconceivable

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:32.330
thing, which I
looked at and touched

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:34.930
without any sense whatever
of recognition or relation.

00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:39.330
I gazed at it and felt, I don't
know, you're not part of me.

00:25:39.330 --> 00:25:41.320
So he's basically saying
that his leg did not

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:42.850
feel like his own.

00:25:42.850 --> 00:25:44.910
Now this was a transient
condition for him.

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:47.090
And it improved.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.060
And he was OK.

00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:53.180
But it's a condition that
actually can haunt some people

00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:54.500
throughout their life.

00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:57.210
And it's actually
quite debilitating

00:25:57.210 --> 00:26:02.270
and can lead them to take some
pretty desperate measures.

00:26:02.270 --> 00:26:05.990
So one way to understand
what body integrity identity

00:26:05.990 --> 00:26:09.126
disorder might be is to
think about phantom limbs.

00:26:09.126 --> 00:26:11.500
And this is something I'm sure
most of you have heard of.

00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:13.600
If someone has had
an amputation because

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:17.250
of an accident or an
infection, and they

00:26:17.250 --> 00:26:21.050
will-- some people who've
had this amputation will say,

00:26:21.050 --> 00:26:22.790
oh, I continue to feel my limb.

00:26:22.790 --> 00:26:24.690
So now it's very clear
that the limb is gone

00:26:24.690 --> 00:26:26.360
because it has been amputated.

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.530
But they continue to feel
the presence of that limb.

00:26:29.530 --> 00:26:33.090
Some will even feel pain in
the limb, in that phantom limb.

00:26:33.090 --> 00:26:35.060
And that's called phantom pain.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.700
Now, what that is
telling you very clearly

00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:41.760
is that what has happened
is that the limb is gone

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.340
but a representation of the limb
in the brain still persists.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:47.530
Somehow the brain's
representation of the limb

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:48.460
hasn't reorganized.

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:50.640
At least that's one
theory for what's

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:53.540
happening when you have
to explain the perception

00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:56.930
of a phantom limb.

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:58.560
So it's basically
telling us that when

00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:01.760
you perceive your body,
what you're perceiving

00:27:01.760 --> 00:27:03.890
is a representation
or information

00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:10.020
about the body in the brain,
not the actual physical limb.

00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:12.240
And if everything
is working well,

00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:15.140
the brain's representation
of your body and your body

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.490
should be the same.

00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:18.210
And so everything works well.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:21.860
But there are situations like in
phantom limbs where the limb is

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:23.630
gone because of the amputation.

00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:25.420
But the representation
hasn't changed yet

00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:26.630
for whatever reason.

00:27:26.630 --> 00:27:28.090
And you continue
to feel that limb.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:30.548
So what you're feeling, what
you're perceiving to be a body

00:27:30.548 --> 00:27:32.390
is actually information
in the brain.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:34.560
Now, you can imagine the
opposite scenario, which

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.700
is BIID, where the limb is
there-- functional, healthy,

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:41.770
everything is fine except that
the representation in the brain

00:27:41.770 --> 00:27:46.050
is somehow not quite caught up
with the actual physical body.

00:27:46.050 --> 00:27:48.700
But because your
reality is determined

00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:51.040
by what is in the brain in
terms of the representation,

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:55.290
the information content
that the brain has,

00:27:55.290 --> 00:27:57.800
or the model that the
brain has of the body,

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:02.040
your reality will be
dictated by those models.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.130
And if the model for
some reason does not

00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:08.570
include part of your limb
or has some mismatch,

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.480
that mismatch can be
quite debilitating.

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.160
And in this particular
case, people

00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:15.890
will actually go to great
lengths to amputate that limb.

00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.720
So this will be a
voluntary amputation.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:21.780
They will actually go and
get a part of their leg

00:28:21.780 --> 00:28:23.660
or a part of their
arm amputated.

00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:27.630
And then, paradoxically, they
will say I feel complete now.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:31.550
So until then, they felt--
they felt miserable.

00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:35.160
And, actually, taking that limb
off, that part of the body--

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:37.080
it could be any part
of the body but,

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:40.740
usually, it seems to be
the extremities of limbs--

00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:43.140
it's the amputation
that leads to relief

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:48.380
at least at this point of our
understanding of the disorder.

00:28:48.380 --> 00:28:51.660
But what is that telling
us about the body itself?

00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:54.160
It's very, very clear
at some very basic level

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.900
if the understanding-- the
neuroscientific understanding

00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.960
of this is correct--
then what it's telling us

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.850
is that our bodily self,
the body that we perceive,

00:29:02.850 --> 00:29:05.990
is really a model in the brain.

00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:07.652
And that model needs
to be congruent

00:29:07.652 --> 00:29:08.610
with the physical body.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:12.870
And if everything is working
well, it will be congruent.

00:29:12.870 --> 00:29:16.490
And so reality will match
the information content.

00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:18.310
But sometimes
there's a mismatch.

00:29:18.310 --> 00:29:20.980
And, unfortunately for
us, it's the information

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.570
that is sacrosanct,
not the physical body.

00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:26.820
And so when the brain constructs
our sense of bodily self,

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:28.800
it's relying on those
maps in the brain.

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:32.570
And those maps seem to be truth.

00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:34.470
And you can't shake
that perception.

00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:38.890
So let me just quickly touch
on schizophrenia and then

00:29:38.890 --> 00:29:42.950
we'll go to a Q&amp;A. Now
schizophrenia again

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:46.980
is fairly common, 1%
to 2% of the population

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:48.740
worldwide suffer from this.

00:29:48.740 --> 00:29:52.650
And one of the things that
happens in schizophrenia

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.660
is people hear
voices in their heads

00:29:54.660 --> 00:29:57.520
that don't feel like theirs.

00:29:57.520 --> 00:30:00.440
And they have thoughts
in their heads

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:02.530
that don't feel like theirs.

00:30:02.530 --> 00:30:05.250
And all of this leads to an
altered sense of reality.

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:07.440
This is what it's
called psychosis.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.240
And it seems like one of
the basic neurobiological

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:11.860
mechanisms that's
leading to all this

00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.220
is something called
loss of sense of agency.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:19.010
Now, if for instance, if I had
a bottle of water somewhere,

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:19.510
I don't.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.676
But if-- yeah, there you go.

00:30:20.676 --> 00:30:22.200
That's just an example.

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.930
So if I pick up this
bottle of water,

00:30:23.930 --> 00:30:28.230
I have a very distinct
feeling that I'm doing this.

00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:29.600
It's not a doubt in my mind.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:32.360
All of us, no matter what
we do, hopefully, you

00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:34.130
will feel that you are doing it.

00:30:34.130 --> 00:30:38.000
It's a very implicit sense
you have of your actions.

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:41.090
And philosophers have long
argued that the sense of I,

00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:44.380
the I that we are, comes from
being agents of our actions,

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:45.730
comes from the sense of agency.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:48.120
So because we do
actions and because we

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:52.170
feel like we're the agents
of the actions that we do,

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:54.620
the sense of an I
somehow is constructed

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:56.770
from the sense of agency.

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:58.790
What happens in
schizophrenia, unfortunately,

00:30:58.790 --> 00:31:00.550
is that they might
do the same thing.

00:31:00.550 --> 00:31:03.420
They might pick up
the bottle of water.

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.540
And it will not feel
like they did it.

00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:08.800
So it will actually feel
like, oh, I'm picking it up.

00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:10.400
But I didn't will this action.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:12.600
This is not me doing it.

00:31:12.600 --> 00:31:17.300
And some neurobiologists
have looked at schizophrenia

00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:21.590
at least in some
particular scenarios.

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:23.520
What they have
found is that there

00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:26.970
is a mechanism in our
brain that kind of tags

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:31.090
this action as mine and
refers that action back

00:31:31.090 --> 00:31:33.670
to the I, whatever that I is.

00:31:33.670 --> 00:31:36.700
And in schizophrenia, it
seems like that mechanism

00:31:36.700 --> 00:31:39.860
of tagging in action
as mine has gone wrong.

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.710
And what it's telling you is
that actually sense of agency

00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:47.840
is not constituting
the I because here

00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:50.470
I am lifting my bottle of water.

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.124
And I feel like I did it.

00:31:52.124 --> 00:31:53.790
If you are suffering
from schizophrenia,

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:54.914
you would lift that bottle.

00:31:54.914 --> 00:31:57.460
And you may feel, oh,
this is not me doing it.

00:31:57.460 --> 00:31:59.360
This is not I. I'm
not doing this.

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:03.370
But, again, you can have the
sense of I owning that action.

00:32:03.370 --> 00:32:05.620
Or you can have the sense
of I not owning that action.

00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:06.780
The I still persists.

00:32:06.780 --> 00:32:09.370
So the question-- it still
comes back to the same question.

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:12.250
What or who is that I
that either perceives

00:32:12.250 --> 00:32:16.240
the sense of agency or doesn't
perceive a sense of agency?

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:20.340
So schizophrenia just tells
you that at least your I is not

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:21.820
coming from your
sense of agency,

00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.920
that there is
something still basic

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:28.080
that needs to be explained in
order to understand the self.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.210
And this is sort of
how the book proceeds.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:33.710
I basically go through
depersonalization disorder,

00:32:33.710 --> 00:32:37.860
autism, autoscopic phenomena,
which includes things

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.150
like autoscopic hallucinations
where you perceive

00:32:41.150 --> 00:32:43.410
a body next to you or
doppleganger effect

00:32:43.410 --> 00:32:45.580
where you perceive a double.

00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:47.630
Your own body in front of you.

00:32:47.630 --> 00:32:49.640
And you can have an
interaction with that

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:52.550
double where you are either
located in your physical body

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:55.990
or you're located in the
illusory body in front of you.

00:32:55.990 --> 00:32:57.580
You can have
out-of-body experiences.

00:32:57.580 --> 00:32:59.830
These are classical
out-of -body experiences

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:02.890
where people report just
leaving their body altogether

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:05.882
and observing the physical
body from, say, the ceiling.

00:33:05.882 --> 00:33:07.340
All of these things
are telling you

00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:09.920
something about how
the brain constructs

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:13.950
the bodily self, how it actually
creates an in-body experience.

00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:17.092
Then ecstatic epilepsy,
I mentioned this earlier.

00:33:17.092 --> 00:33:18.550
So all of these
things, if you just

00:33:18.550 --> 00:33:23.340
look at them from the
perspective of people

00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:26.040
who are actually suffering
from these conditions

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:32.210
and understand what it is
like to be experiencing

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:34.100
these various conditions,
then it actually

00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:37.230
tells a lot about how the
brain might be putting together

00:33:37.230 --> 00:33:38.420
the self in the first place.

00:33:38.420 --> 00:33:42.180
And that's sort of what
the arc of the book is.

00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:47.930
And in the end in the epilogue,
I come to essentially taking

00:33:47.930 --> 00:33:50.970
all this information that
neuropsychology and psychiatry

00:33:50.970 --> 00:33:54.654
is telling us then to ask
questions about, well,

00:33:54.654 --> 00:33:55.320
is there a self?

00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.910
Or is there no self?

00:33:56.910 --> 00:34:02.250
And I will not answer that here
right now because it's actually

00:34:02.250 --> 00:34:04.530
a very, very subtle point.

00:34:04.530 --> 00:34:08.600
But it comes down
somewhere to understanding

00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:10.880
the nature of consciousness.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:14.600
There are still
people who persist

00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:18.120
in-- I shouldn't say pursue--
there are still people who

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.460
insist that there is a self.

00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:22.929
But it's a particular
neural process

00:34:22.929 --> 00:34:27.610
in the brain that needs
to hold a few moments

00:34:27.610 --> 00:34:30.281
of our experience.

00:34:30.281 --> 00:34:32.239
We are Google and we're
all software engineers.

00:34:32.239 --> 00:34:34.159
So we can understand
the notion of a buffer.

00:34:34.159 --> 00:34:38.500
So you can imagine a buffer off
a few moments of experiences.

00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.940
And you can have a
moment of experience

00:34:41.940 --> 00:34:43.752
that is somehow
creating this unity

00:34:43.752 --> 00:34:44.960
that we talked about earlier.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.440
And you can have a few
moments of experience

00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:50.989
prior to that and a few
moments of experience that

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:53.120
are predicted by the
brain to come after that.

00:34:53.120 --> 00:34:56.760
And somehow the
brain manages to keep

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.187
a buffer of such experiences
to create a very minimal self.

00:35:00.187 --> 00:35:02.645
And then from there, it starts
constructing the larger self

00:35:02.645 --> 00:35:05.430
that we are, which is either the
narrative or the social in all

00:35:05.430 --> 00:35:07.320
of those things.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.012
The bundle theorists like
David Hume-- and there

00:35:10.012 --> 00:35:11.620
are a lot of modern
philosophers who

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.800
will fall into that category
who basically say, look,

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.330
the sense of I that
you are is just

00:35:16.330 --> 00:35:18.870
something that appears because
of the interaction of all

00:35:18.870 --> 00:35:21.960
the perceptions and various
aspects of herself that

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:25.070
there, is if you go looking
for it, there is nothing there.

00:35:25.070 --> 00:35:26.540
And then there
are people who say

00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.220
that actually the
self fundamentally

00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:31.140
is a property of
consciousness itself.

00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:34.520
And there we hit a wall because
consciousness is such a problem

00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:37.160
for neuroscience right now.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.820
And that would be a
huge talk in itself.

00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:45.110
But once you come down to that
level of debate about the self,

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:47.820
you can't escape talking
about consciousness.

00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:50.840
And it's very integral to this
whole question of is there

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.530
a self or is there no self.

00:35:52.530 --> 00:35:54.370
So I will stop here.

00:35:54.370 --> 00:35:57.120
And then we can have questions.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:59.350
AUDIENCE: OK, so I
guess this relates

00:35:59.350 --> 00:36:05.880
to the schizophrenia framework
and the agents of action.

00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.660
I used to think of
when I did things

00:36:09.660 --> 00:36:12.490
as-- every time I do something,
I'm making a conscious decision

00:36:12.490 --> 00:36:13.400
to do that.

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:16.010
But at some point,
I realized that it

00:36:16.010 --> 00:36:20.259
seems that often you set part of
your body off on a subroutine.

00:36:20.259 --> 00:36:21.050
You're out walking.

00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:23.580
And you tell your
legs, OK, walk.

00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.380
I'm going to go to
wherever I'm going.

00:36:25.380 --> 00:36:26.660
And then while you're
walking, you're

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:27.820
not thinking about walking.

00:36:27.820 --> 00:36:29.870
You're thinking about doing
whatever else you're doing.

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:31.730
Or, similarly, you're
carrying something,

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:33.750
even though your
arm is getting tired

00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:38.040
and it wants to quit
lifting it-- lift carrying

00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:41.110
the heavy object that you have--
it still does it until you tell

00:36:41.110 --> 00:36:42.250
it that it's done.

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:45.880
So how does that relate
to this-- so yes,

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:51.850
how does that relate to
the agenthood of action

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:55.380
if you're setting your body
on subroutines like that?

00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:59.180
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: Well,
the implicit assumption

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:03.590
in your question is that there
is a split between the mind

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:08.060
and body-- that
there is something

00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:10.500
that is outside the
body, in some sense,

00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.080
you telling the body
to do something.

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:15.700
And what neuroscience is
showing us is actually

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:19.280
that split is definitely not
as stark as it intuitively

00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:20.500
feels to us.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.970
We kind of feel that
there is that split,

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:26.310
and hence, centuries
of philosophy

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:28.830
that comes from Descartes--
I think, therefore

00:37:28.830 --> 00:37:32.780
I am-- and all of that
fallout from that.

00:37:32.780 --> 00:37:36.210
The whole mind-body
split was such a big deal

00:37:36.210 --> 00:37:37.270
for such a long time.

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:39.519
But over the last few decades
I thik even neuroscience

00:37:39.519 --> 00:37:41.930
has moved away from that.

00:37:41.930 --> 00:37:46.887
So it's not quite as simple
as saying, I told my I guess,

00:37:46.887 --> 00:37:48.470
we're in a software
company because we

00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:50.270
were talking about subroutines.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:53.530
But, basically, it probably
is not as simple as that.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:55.490
The body has its
own intelligence.

00:37:55.490 --> 00:37:59.160
And the brain and body are
very, very tightly coupled.

00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:03.100
So what might seem like giving
instructions is probably not

00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.150
as simple as that.

00:38:04.150 --> 00:38:08.110
So the body is probably
giving ample feedback.

00:38:08.110 --> 00:38:12.940
And you're unconsciously
probably responding

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.460
to a lot of those things.

00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:15.910
And by the time
something filters

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:17.900
into conscious awareness,
a lot of processing

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.960
has happened that
we're not aware of.

00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:25.330
So your body and brain are
already adjusting and doing

00:38:25.330 --> 00:38:29.510
a lot of things for you before
it enters conscious awareness.

00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:31.510
AUDIENCE: Hello, I have
a question quite related

00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:32.718
to what you were just saying.

00:38:32.718 --> 00:38:35.347
So if you have a very
materialistic view

00:38:35.347 --> 00:38:35.930
of the world--

00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:37.150
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY:
Sorry, say that again.

00:38:37.150 --> 00:38:39.108
AUDIENCE: If you have a
very materialistic view

00:38:39.108 --> 00:38:41.240
of the world, You can
come to the conclusion

00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:44.170
that willpower is
actually an illusion.

00:38:44.170 --> 00:38:46.820
I feel like I'm choosing
to raise my hand.

00:38:46.820 --> 00:38:48.980
But actually the world
is one big algorithm.

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:54.220
And out of that,
my hand just moves.

00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:56.620
And I think I chose to do that.

00:38:56.620 --> 00:39:02.370
My question is that even when
no matter how hard I believe

00:39:02.370 --> 00:39:07.820
in materialism, why is
it that I still feel like

00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.250
I have willpower?

00:39:09.250 --> 00:39:12.360
No matter how hard
I tried not to,

00:39:12.360 --> 00:39:17.840
there is no way not to feel the
idea that we have willpower.

00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.390
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: Yeah, I don't
get into the whole question

00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:25.940
of whether there's a will
or not because that's

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:28.250
another big, big
question in itself.

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:30.920
But the sense of agency
that I was talking about--

00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.830
actually, the neurobiological
mechanism at some level

00:39:35.830 --> 00:39:37.790
has a very simple
model, which is

00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:42.720
that say you decide
to move your arm,

00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:44.980
your brain is going to send
motor commands to your arm

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:45.890
to move the arm.

00:39:45.890 --> 00:39:47.970
So say I'm going to
move my arm to pick up

00:39:47.970 --> 00:39:49.480
this bottle of water.

00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.700
Then my brain is going to send
commands to the arm to do that.

00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.650
At the same time, the brain
sends a copy of those commands

00:39:55.650 --> 00:39:59.290
to other parts of the brain that
are going to predict the sensor

00:39:59.290 --> 00:40:03.740
consequences of lifting that.

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.330
So now you have two
things happening.

00:40:05.330 --> 00:40:07.080
One is a prediction
in the brain that, oh,

00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:08.670
my arm is going to
move and is going

00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:12.260
to feel the cold
temperature and also

00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:14.110
a certain amount of weight.

00:40:14.110 --> 00:40:16.810
It's expecting some sensory
consequence to that action.

00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:19.000
And then the actual sensory
consequences happen.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:20.920
And they are fed
back into the brain.

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.560
And the brain compares the two.

00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:24.340
So there is a prediction
that is compared

00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:25.960
against what actually happened.

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.535
And if the competitor
comes up again,

00:40:27.535 --> 00:40:29.160
it's lovely being in
a software company

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.800
because all these
things make sense.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:35.240
So the comparator then
basically says, ah,

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:37.270
my prediction
matches the outcome.

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:38.870
So it must be I.

00:40:38.870 --> 00:40:41.200
If for some reason,
the competitor's output

00:40:41.200 --> 00:40:45.990
was such that it showed a
mismatch, that implicitly gets

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:48.780
tagged as a non-self
or that's why

00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:52.810
you don't have a sense of
agency if you lift it up

00:40:52.810 --> 00:40:54.760
and for some reason,
that whole pathway that

00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:58.460
has to compare prediction with
the actual sensory outcome.

00:40:58.460 --> 00:41:00.640
There's a problem in
that pathway somewhere.

00:41:00.640 --> 00:41:02.098
And you can end up
with a sensation

00:41:02.098 --> 00:41:05.880
of not doing something
yourself, even though you

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.970
were the one we initiated.

00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:12.030
And your brains send the
motor commands to the arm.

00:41:12.030 --> 00:41:14.990
So it was in that context that
I mentioned sense of agency.

00:41:14.990 --> 00:41:18.000
So it was not so
much about willpower.

00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:20.200
There is some
argument to be made

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:22.160
that even the sense
of having a will

00:41:22.160 --> 00:41:26.370
is a consequence of this
sense of agency coming about.

00:41:26.370 --> 00:41:28.040
If the sense of
agency is disrupted,

00:41:28.040 --> 00:41:31.740
then you-- you will
doubt your own will

00:41:31.740 --> 00:41:34.794
because you will feel
like, oh, I didn't do that.

00:41:34.794 --> 00:41:36.210
MALE SPEAKER: We've
got a question

00:41:36.210 --> 00:41:38.980
from somebody watching on live
stream-- one of our Googlers.

00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:43.140
And he's asking, "What does deep
sleep tell us about the self?

00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:46.810
What happens to the
self during deep sleep?"

00:41:46.810 --> 00:41:53.030
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: Oh, so--
in terms of if you're dreaming

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:56.940
and if you're aware
of your dreams,

00:41:56.940 --> 00:41:59.430
there is a self in
that dream-- that self.

00:41:59.430 --> 00:42:01.630
And it's, again, the
same self in some sense.

00:42:01.630 --> 00:42:06.980
But in your dreams, you can
do all sorts of weird things

00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.340
that you can't do with
your bodies in waking life.

00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:11.560
So, obviously, again
that kind of tells you

00:42:11.560 --> 00:42:16.270
that it's information
processing at the heart of it.

00:42:16.270 --> 00:42:19.310
In deep sleep, it disappears.

00:42:19.310 --> 00:42:24.315
And it's almost like that part
of the brain is shut down.

00:42:24.315 --> 00:42:25.220
And we don't know.

00:42:25.220 --> 00:42:26.845
We can't query the
brain at that point.

00:42:26.845 --> 00:42:29.197
No one can come out
of that-- and we just

00:42:29.197 --> 00:42:30.280
don't have access to that.

00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.450
So it's very unclear
in terms of the self

00:42:33.450 --> 00:42:36.230
as to what happens
at that point.

00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:40.890
The traditional explanation
for that in the way

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:43.450
one would understand
modern neuroscience

00:42:43.450 --> 00:42:47.170
would be that whatever
brain processes work

00:42:47.170 --> 00:42:50.740
to create our sense of self,
those processes shut down.

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:54.170
And you-- and it's part of
also losing consciousness

00:42:54.170 --> 00:42:55.950
because when you're
in deep sleep,

00:42:55.950 --> 00:42:57.260
you're not conscious either.

00:42:57.260 --> 00:43:00.290
So they must all be
related on some level.

00:43:00.290 --> 00:43:02.410
AUDIENCE: I listened to
your Terry Gross interview

00:43:02.410 --> 00:43:03.030
last week.

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:05.190
And so when I found out
you were coming today,

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:07.460
I was over the moon.

00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:11.310
I have a question about
the Cotard's syndrome.

00:43:11.310 --> 00:43:15.960
You mentioned that there's
only a few hundred cases known.

00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:17.960
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: A few
hundred cases recorded.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.160
AUDIENCE: Oh, recorded.

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.020
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY:
There probably

00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.640
are lots of people
experiencing it.

00:43:20.640 --> 00:43:23.482
But in terms of medical
literature, yeah.

00:43:23.482 --> 00:43:25.440
AUDIENCE: OK, that was
going to be my question.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:30.040
Are there any living people
that you perhaps met with

00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.060
or psychiatrists--

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:32.476
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY:
Cotard syndrome

00:43:32.476 --> 00:43:35.050
was the only syndrome in
the book where I actually

00:43:35.050 --> 00:43:39.170
couldn't meet a person
who was suffering from it.

00:43:39.170 --> 00:43:42.130
It's a transient
condition, thankfully.

00:43:42.130 --> 00:43:43.650
And it's very, very severe.

00:43:43.650 --> 00:43:47.520
So when it's happening
it's really hard to-- you

00:43:47.520 --> 00:43:51.170
have to be in touch
with the psychiatrists

00:43:51.170 --> 00:43:53.680
or neuropsychologists who are
treating them at that point.

00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.540
So in this one condition,
I couldn't actually

00:43:56.540 --> 00:43:57.620
meet someone in person.

00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:00.440
So I had to understand
what was happening

00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:04.330
by talking to their doctors and
having them tell me what they

00:44:04.330 --> 00:44:07.140
understood of the condition.

00:44:07.140 --> 00:44:10.025
For all the other
conditions, I did meet people

00:44:10.025 --> 00:44:11.770
who could narrate
and who could tell me

00:44:11.770 --> 00:44:15.290
what it was like to be
suffering from schizophrenia

00:44:15.290 --> 00:44:18.860
or suffering from autism.

00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:23.110
This was the only
one where I couldn't.

00:44:23.110 --> 00:44:26.900
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
know where does ego stand

00:44:26.900 --> 00:44:29.050
in all of this self theory?

00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:30.630
Is it just the
materialistic self?

00:44:33.896 --> 00:44:35.520
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY:
I of the ego as more

00:44:35.520 --> 00:44:39.930
of the narrative component of
ourselves-- the story that we

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:40.770
are.

00:44:40.770 --> 00:44:44.730
Now, if you think about it,
the story has no boundaries.

00:44:44.730 --> 00:44:47.720
You can make up any story
you want in your head.

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:50.650
It may not have a
basis in reality.

00:44:50.650 --> 00:44:53.710
So there is a conceptual
aspect to ourselves.

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:57.250
We can conceive of ourselves
in many different ways.

00:44:57.250 --> 00:45:01.600
And in some sense to me,
the ego would be that.

00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:05.560
So the bodily self is
something very basic.

00:45:05.560 --> 00:45:08.140
It's something
potentially animals have.

00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.620
It's one of the more primitive
aspects of what we are.

00:45:11.620 --> 00:45:13.720
And on top of that, you
have this entire cognitive

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.920
construct, which
is the narrative.

00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:17.560
So that to me would be the ego.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:23.510
And that's the thing that
could lead us into trouble

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:26.220
more often than not
because you can--

00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:28.160
you can imagine conceiving
of yourself in very

00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.010
grandiose terms-- like just
narcissism, for instance,

00:45:32.010 --> 00:45:36.447
is just a narrative gone wild.

00:45:36.447 --> 00:45:37.530
And that's a problem also.

00:45:37.530 --> 00:45:40.740
So I think keeping our
narratives in check

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:43.110
is probably a very good thing.

00:45:43.110 --> 00:45:46.860
AUDIENCE: Continuing that
question about deep sleep,

00:45:46.860 --> 00:45:50.230
I was wondering about
deep sleep versus a coma.

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:52.870
Is there any
interesting difference

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.210
in terms of the
study of the self?

00:45:55.210 --> 00:45:57.637
Is it totally out of scope?

00:45:57.637 --> 00:46:00.220
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: I could tell
you a little bit about a coma.

00:46:00.220 --> 00:46:04.670
There is a neurologist
at the University Liege

00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:07.550
in Belgium, Dr. Steven Laureys.

00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:11.880
He studies a lot of patients who
are suffering from coma or are

00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.226
what's called unresponsive
wakefulness, something that

00:46:14.226 --> 00:46:15.850
used to be called
the vegetative state,

00:46:15.850 --> 00:46:17.850
but more appropriately
now is being

00:46:17.850 --> 00:46:21.020
called unresponsive wakefulness
or locked-in syndrome.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.810
So these are all various
stages of being conscious.

00:46:24.810 --> 00:46:28.110
And what he's
found is that there

00:46:28.110 --> 00:46:31.140
are two networks
in the brain that

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:34.480
are correlated with
either external awareness,

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:38.230
awareness of sensations that
are coming from outside the body

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:41.370
into us or an internal
awareness network that

00:46:41.370 --> 00:46:44.120
is responsible for our
awareness of our own body

00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:47.950
and its internal states
and thoughts about oneself,

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:50.437
so self-referential thinking.

00:46:50.437 --> 00:46:51.770
So there are these two networks.

00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:55.490
And they seem to
be anti-correlated.

00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:58.350
So if you are really
paying attention

00:46:58.350 --> 00:47:01.380
to something outside of
you, then the network--

00:47:01.380 --> 00:47:03.584
the external awareness
network is highly active.

00:47:03.584 --> 00:47:05.000
And the internal
awareness network

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.370
is damned down and vice versa.

00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:09.720
And it turns out that
in coma patients,

00:47:09.720 --> 00:47:12.880
the metabolic activity in those
networks is way, way down.

00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:15.390
So something goes wrong
where you are aware.

00:47:15.390 --> 00:47:17.150
And there must be some
other reasons also.

00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:19.680
There are other parts
of the brain that

00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:21.865
are responsible for
arousal, just sort

00:47:21.865 --> 00:47:25.010
of becoming-- as soon as
you come out from sleep,

00:47:25.010 --> 00:47:26.490
something has to switch on.

00:47:26.490 --> 00:47:28.980
And then all the other
activity has to kick in.

00:47:28.980 --> 00:47:34.430
So in coma, those things
are somehow affected badly.

00:47:34.430 --> 00:47:38.950
But then if you go to
the other conditions

00:47:38.950 --> 00:47:41.240
like unresponsive wakefulness,
locked-in syndrome,

00:47:41.240 --> 00:47:42.977
you'll see differing
levels of activity

00:47:42.977 --> 00:47:44.560
in these networks
suggesting that it's

00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.820
a gradation of consciousness.

00:47:46.820 --> 00:47:48.820
MALE SPEAKER: We have
another one from a Googler

00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:51.120
tuning in from live stream.

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.890
"What do intentionally-altered
states of conscious

00:47:53.890 --> 00:47:56.200
tell us about our sense of self?

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:58.890
I.E. everything from positive
methods such as a runner's

00:47:58.890 --> 00:48:02.177
high to the negatives
such as substance abuse,

00:48:02.177 --> 00:48:04.510
particularly in light of new
ways to measure the effects

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:08.170
scientifically?"

00:48:08.170 --> 00:48:11.005
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY:
I think any time

00:48:11.005 --> 00:48:15.660
you alter your state
of consciousness,

00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:17.750
it's a way of
examining-- essentially

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:20.720
what you're altering is the
contents of your consciousness.

00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:24.580
So you are always--
hopefully always conscious.

00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:27.720
But what's changing is the
content of that consciousness

00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:29.260
in some sense.

00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:33.100
And that is giving
you an idea of how

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:34.650
the self feels at that point.

00:48:34.650 --> 00:48:37.270
So if, for instance, you've
taken some psychedelic which

00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:41.350
disrupts some part of
your brain that now

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:42.960
can't keep a coherent narrative.

00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:46.020
Somehow the narrative
part of you has shut down

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:47.329
or has fragmented.

00:48:47.329 --> 00:48:49.620
So it's basically telling
you that these are all things

00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:54.870
that the brain has to work
really hard moment by moment

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:56.370
to keep it coherent.

00:48:56.370 --> 00:48:59.640
And you can do
things to disrupt it.

00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.960
So in some sense,
they're giving you

00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.340
clues about brain
mechanisms that are actually

00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:08.050
working normally and
creating the sense of self

00:49:08.050 --> 00:49:11.430
because it-- just
being in body right now

00:49:11.430 --> 00:49:13.672
means that the brain
has to integrate

00:49:13.672 --> 00:49:16.130
all the information that is
coming in from outside the body

00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:17.530
and from within the body.

00:49:17.530 --> 00:49:23.095
And it is, in some sense,
sampling information

00:49:23.095 --> 00:49:24.720
and integrating all
of the information,

00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:27.880
and creating a perception
of your body at this moment.

00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:30.670
And it's doing so
moment by moment.

00:49:30.670 --> 00:49:33.000
And you're perceiving
a continuous whole

00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:35.080
because of this integration.

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.580
And you can disrupt
that integration

00:49:36.580 --> 00:49:40.090
whether you do it because
of a runner's high.

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:41.719
I would imagine a
runner's high is gong

00:49:41.719 --> 00:49:43.010
to disrupt your narrative self.

00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:46.050
You're not thinking about
stories in your head anymore.

00:49:46.050 --> 00:49:50.450
You become acutely aware of your
own body and your environment.

00:49:50.450 --> 00:49:54.080
So quite similar to
probably ecstatic epilepsy.

00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:56.010
And psychedelics
can do the same.

00:49:56.010 --> 00:49:58.510
So they do give us clues about
how the self is constructed.

00:49:58.510 --> 00:49:59.510
MALE SPEAKER: Very cool.

00:49:59.510 --> 00:50:00.510
Thank you.

00:50:00.510 --> 00:50:01.900
AUDIENCE: A couple
of quick ones.

00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:03.550
At first, it looked
like at the end,

00:50:03.550 --> 00:50:07.080
you were trying to use
or say consciousness

00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.130
might be the glue
that ties it together

00:50:09.130 --> 00:50:10.300
and identify with self.

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.300
And yet, then I thought
a little more in saying,

00:50:12.300 --> 00:50:15.660
no, you have the conscious
person saying that wasn't me.

00:50:15.660 --> 00:50:19.340
So there's some tension
there I want to hear about.

00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:22.740
And then a side question--
I've heard of these experiments

00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:25.770
where there's timing going on
for when a decision happens.

00:50:25.770 --> 00:50:28.030
And one of the
striking findings is

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:31.130
the person will say this is--
this is when I've decided it.

00:50:31.130 --> 00:50:33.460
And yet the report
comes up that something

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:35.750
was happening in the
brain, I don't know, 100,

00:50:35.750 --> 00:50:38.010
150 milliseconds earlier.

00:50:38.010 --> 00:50:41.520
And does that speak
to any of the notion

00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:44.232
of where the self really is.

00:50:44.232 --> 00:50:46.690
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: So let's
take the second question first.

00:50:46.690 --> 00:50:48.231
And then we'll come
to consciousness.

00:50:48.231 --> 00:50:50.110
So there was a very
classy experiment

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:53.820
that was done at UC Berkeley
by Benjamin Libet-- I think

00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:57.630
it was in the '80s where it
was an experiment that showed

00:50:57.630 --> 00:51:04.930
that a person's sense of when
he or she did something was

00:51:04.930 --> 00:51:09.150
actually came after some signal
in the brain that had actually

00:51:09.150 --> 00:51:10.180
initiated that action.

00:51:10.180 --> 00:51:12.560
So it was almost as
if your sense of will

00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:16.540
was being constructed
after the fact.

00:51:16.540 --> 00:51:19.280
That experiment-- people
have tried to repeat it.

00:51:19.280 --> 00:51:22.060
And it turns out that
maybe we didn't quite

00:51:22.060 --> 00:51:24.700
understand exactly what
that brain signal was

00:51:24.700 --> 00:51:26.850
that he was looking at.

00:51:26.850 --> 00:51:30.710
So there are-- there have
been various studies that

00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:33.349
have followed on.

00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:34.390
It's still being debated.

00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:36.270
It's not entirely clear.

00:51:36.270 --> 00:51:40.730
It's possible that the
sense of having a will

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:44.440
is also a construction
in a sense.

00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.420
But it's up for debate.

00:51:46.420 --> 00:51:48.540
I don't think that
question has been resolved.

00:51:51.310 --> 00:51:54.040
In terms of
consciousness, there are

00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.750
philosophers and
neuroscientists who

00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:59.860
will argue that
all the self is is

00:51:59.860 --> 00:52:02.670
just moments of consciousness.

00:52:02.670 --> 00:52:06.450
So consciousness-- you
can talk of consciousness

00:52:06.450 --> 00:52:09.040
as having a property
called reflexivity

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:12.680
where a moment of
consciousness, regardless

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:17.010
of whether there's a
person-- something that

00:52:17.010 --> 00:52:18.920
is capable of consciousness.

00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:20.740
And if there is a
moment of consciousness,

00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.870
then that moment might have
the property of reflexivity

00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:26.860
where it's aware
of being conscious.

00:52:26.860 --> 00:52:29.800
It doesn't mean there is a
subject or a person behind it.

00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.710
It's just the nature of--
or the intrinsic property

00:52:33.710 --> 00:52:35.530
of conscious experience.

00:52:35.530 --> 00:52:39.370
Now, you can imagine
all that we are

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:43.140
is a string of conscious
experiences, each one of which

00:52:43.140 --> 00:52:44.750
is self-aware without
there actually

00:52:44.750 --> 00:52:47.280
being a person behind it.

00:52:47.280 --> 00:52:50.020
So if that-- if each such
experience is a pearl,

00:52:50.020 --> 00:52:52.710
then we are like a string
of pearls strung together.

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:54.120
Somehow the brain
manages to take

00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:57.450
all these individual
experiences, each one of which

00:52:57.450 --> 00:53:00.480
has a sense of
self-referentiality

00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.844
and somehow
constructs this larger

00:53:02.844 --> 00:53:05.510
sense of being a person to which
all these things are happening.

00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:08.790
And there might be no person.

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:11.850
And that's where the
whole self, no self debate

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:15.510
hits-- that's where the
rubber meets the road.

00:53:15.510 --> 00:53:18.270
It really is-- it ties
in with the hard problem

00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:21.560
of consciousness trying to
explain how does consciousness

00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:25.020
arise in a brain that
is material and physical

00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:28.540
and yet seems to give rise to
something that is not seemingly

00:53:28.540 --> 00:53:30.040
material.

00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:32.480
And right now neuroscience
really doesn't have an answer.

00:53:32.480 --> 00:53:35.560
Philosophers disagree on whether
science will ever answer it

00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:37.530
or whether the problem
will just go away

00:53:37.530 --> 00:53:40.780
the more we understand
the brain-- we don't know.

00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:43.620
AUDIENCE: So I have a
meta-question ready.

00:53:43.620 --> 00:53:46.832
So I think this is particularly
true of modern physics

00:53:46.832 --> 00:53:48.540
and neurobiology that
there's the science

00:53:48.540 --> 00:53:50.510
and there's the
interpretation of science.

00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:53.137
And the interpretations
tend to vary widely

00:53:53.137 --> 00:53:54.220
based on the same science.

00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:57.490
So what do you think
is your narrative bias?

00:53:57.490 --> 00:54:00.450
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: My narrative
bias-- my cognitive bias--

00:54:00.450 --> 00:54:05.416
probably tending more towards
evidence-based science.

00:54:05.416 --> 00:54:06.540
Is that what you're asking?

00:54:10.510 --> 00:54:13.450
AUDIENCE: Again, more
from what I know, again,

00:54:13.450 --> 00:54:17.872
a layman in both these fields,
but more true of physics.

00:54:17.872 --> 00:54:19.830
Based on the same evidence,
the interpretations

00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:23.800
can still vary because
a lot of, again, I'm

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:24.980
going back to physics.

00:54:24.980 --> 00:54:27.570
A lot of the research
is essentially math.

00:54:27.570 --> 00:54:29.630
And a lot of the
interpretation is

00:54:29.630 --> 00:54:33.530
trying to make sense of
it that somehow matches up

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:37.114
with our common sense in
the everyday experiences.

00:54:37.114 --> 00:54:39.030
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: I'm
not sure that physicist

00:54:39.030 --> 00:54:40.160
will agree with that.

00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:43.430
I think physics is really
trying to explain the material

00:54:43.430 --> 00:54:45.150
world in some sense.

00:54:45.150 --> 00:54:48.980
Yes, there are
mathematical frameworks,

00:54:48.980 --> 00:54:52.580
like string theory
for instance, which

00:54:52.580 --> 00:54:56.720
are well-motivated, but haven't
yet intersected experiment.

00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:58.890
So I don't think
physicists would

00:54:58.890 --> 00:55:02.430
say that their math or
the science that they do

00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:03.800
is open to interpretation.

00:55:03.800 --> 00:55:05.430
In some sense,
they are basically

00:55:05.430 --> 00:55:08.330
explaining the physical world.

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:09.700
And there are-- you're right.

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:11.240
There are mathematical
frameworks

00:55:11.240 --> 00:55:13.570
that haven't yet
intersected experiment

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:15.620
and hence is open
to interpretation.

00:55:15.620 --> 00:55:17.900
But that is slightly
different from saying here's

00:55:17.900 --> 00:55:20.910
a body of physics and math
that actually has been tested.

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:22.490
And that is open
to interpretation.

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:24.350
That is not open
to interpretation.

00:55:24.350 --> 00:55:28.010
It's those frameworks
that haven't yet

00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:30.460
intersected with experiment
where the interpretation comes

00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:31.180
in.

00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:37.030
Or quantum mechanics where--
that's a really, really

00:55:37.030 --> 00:55:38.810
weird part of physics.

00:55:38.810 --> 00:55:41.510
And so there are
interpretations about what

00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:44.500
is happening when you observe
things at the quantum level.

00:55:44.500 --> 00:55:45.730
Yes, I agree.

00:55:45.730 --> 00:55:50.230
But things like the
many worlds hypothesis

00:55:50.230 --> 00:55:53.282
or the Copenhagen
interpretation.

00:55:53.282 --> 00:55:54.990
And I think that's
because at this point,

00:55:54.990 --> 00:55:59.180
we just don't have enough
experimental means to delve

00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:03.610
into reality in ways that
can answer or resolve those.

00:56:03.610 --> 00:56:06.324
They're all open to
interpretation at this point.

00:56:06.324 --> 00:56:07.990
AUDIENCE: So you think
that neurobiology

00:56:07.990 --> 00:56:12.310
is at a point where we
are more realistic in what

00:56:12.310 --> 00:56:14.994
we can say [INAUDIBLE]
man based on the science?

00:56:14.994 --> 00:56:16.660
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY:
Is it more realistic?

00:56:16.660 --> 00:56:20.120
No, I think there is a lot of
hype about neurobiology also.

00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.670
I think we have to be careful.

00:56:22.670 --> 00:56:25.470
In my book, I talk a
lot about brain scans

00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:29.270
and looking at the differences
in brains of people,

00:56:29.270 --> 00:56:30.900
say, suffering
from once condition

00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:33.440
versus healthy controls
and things like that.

00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:37.400
But we have to be really
cautious that when

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.190
you are talking
about differences

00:56:39.190 --> 00:56:40.550
in the brains of people.

00:56:40.550 --> 00:56:42.630
We're basically
seeing correlations.

00:56:42.630 --> 00:56:44.910
And it has to be very
strongly emphasized

00:56:44.910 --> 00:56:49.490
that what's being seen is a
correlation between a snapshot

00:56:49.490 --> 00:56:52.290
of someone's brain at a
given point in their lives

00:56:52.290 --> 00:56:55.390
with what they are subjectively
experiencing within.

00:56:55.390 --> 00:56:57.310
It doesn't establish causation.

00:56:57.310 --> 00:57:03.370
And we do get carried
away by thinking

00:57:03.370 --> 00:57:07.120
that these things are
actually explaining

00:57:07.120 --> 00:57:08.130
the cause of something.

00:57:08.130 --> 00:57:09.290
They're not at this point.

00:57:09.290 --> 00:57:13.280
To study causation would require
longitudinal studies and a very

00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:15.715
different kind of study.

00:57:15.715 --> 00:57:18.090
MALE SPEAKER: So we'll have
time for a few more questions

00:57:18.090 --> 00:57:19.090
during the book signing.

00:57:19.090 --> 00:57:20.837
But I want to close
with two for now.

00:57:20.837 --> 00:57:22.170
The first one's a little tricky.

00:57:22.170 --> 00:57:23.795
I'll admit it's kind
of hard to phrase.

00:57:23.795 --> 00:57:25.250
We were talking
about it earlier.

00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:28.850
So what I loved most
about the book is

00:57:28.850 --> 00:57:30.600
there are so many
little anecdotes.

00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:32.710
You share a story.

00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:34.007
It kind of captivates you.

00:57:34.007 --> 00:57:35.590
There's a confusing
thing that's going

00:57:35.590 --> 00:57:37.862
on-- a confusing phenomenon.

00:57:37.862 --> 00:57:39.445
Doctors will kind
of give they're take

00:57:39.445 --> 00:57:42.186
and sometimes will give
us a bit of a resolution.

00:57:42.186 --> 00:57:44.060
And early in the book,
one of the resolutions

00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:49.820
is the self is linked to one's
body, one's story, and one's

00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:52.520
social and cultural milieu.

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:55.670
Brain, body, mind,
self, and society

00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:57.760
are inextricably linked.

00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.890
What I liked about
this-- what provoked

00:57:59.890 --> 00:58:02.770
some thought in me
is I think we take

00:58:02.770 --> 00:58:05.280
a lot of these aspects
of our self for granted.

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:06.580
We know we have a body.

00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:07.250
We have a mind.

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:10.390
We have feelings--
a sense of self.

00:58:10.390 --> 00:58:13.150
But this idea of bringing
society into the equation

00:58:13.150 --> 00:58:16.430
is interesting because
I find we blame society

00:58:16.430 --> 00:58:18.800
a lot for a lot for things
that we don't like instead

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:20.680
of thinking it may
be, or even realizing

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:21.850
that it's part of ourselves.

00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:24.070
So at Google, we take on
a lot of social issues.

00:58:24.070 --> 00:58:25.370
We think about them.

00:58:25.370 --> 00:58:27.724
We say at Google
society has standards

00:58:27.724 --> 00:58:29.890
that women shouldn't be
engineers or women shouldn't

00:58:29.890 --> 00:58:32.490
be CEOs or directors or VPs.

00:58:32.490 --> 00:58:35.160
And we combat
society in that way.

00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:37.220
What I wonder-- my very
long-winded question

00:58:37.220 --> 00:58:40.540
is-- if we can acknowledge
that the society--

00:58:40.540 --> 00:58:43.460
culture is at some point,
just a part of ourselves.

00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:46.340
Does it not liberate
us to then maybe think

00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:48.030
about how much we
want to give a voice

00:58:48.030 --> 00:58:49.113
to that part of ourselves?

00:58:50.810 --> 00:58:53.060
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: Yeah, I
think it's really important

00:58:53.060 --> 00:58:55.160
to acknowledge the role
of culture and society

00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:55.830
in who we are.

00:58:55.830 --> 00:59:00.170
We were talking about this
before the talk began.

00:59:00.170 --> 00:59:05.925
And I was telling Sajit
that he's off Indian origin?

00:59:05.925 --> 00:59:07.627
MALE SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:59:07.627 --> 00:59:09.460
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: But
he grew up in the US.

00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:12.810
I can imagine the same
body growing up in India.

00:59:12.810 --> 00:59:14.730
And it will be a
different Sajit.

00:59:14.730 --> 00:59:16.740
That culture would have
a very different impact

00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:18.335
on him and the
person that he would

00:59:18.335 --> 00:59:21.140
be, would be very different
even though biologically,

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:24.480
neurobiologically even, it
would be the same material body.

00:59:24.480 --> 00:59:28.750
So the culture--
society is really

00:59:28.750 --> 00:59:32.790
a very, very strong
aspect of who we are.

00:59:32.790 --> 00:59:37.890
But then who we are then
influences the culture.

00:59:37.890 --> 00:59:39.160
So it's a two-way street.

00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:44.690
And in some sense it is
both liberating and binding.

00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:46.750
You can't escape society.

00:59:46.750 --> 00:59:47.850
You can't escape culture.

00:59:47.850 --> 00:59:49.990
It's a large part
of what we are.

00:59:49.990 --> 00:59:51.610
But we can influence it too.

00:59:51.610 --> 00:59:55.530
And so if you see it that
way, then I would say,

00:59:55.530 --> 00:59:56.500
yeah, it's liberating.

00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.000
MALE SPEAKER: Very
cool-- very cool.

00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:58.601
Thank you.

00:59:58.601 --> 01:00:00.850
A question a lot of Googlers
have been pinging me with

01:00:00.850 --> 01:00:05.450
is how does a Bay Area
SUI software engineer end

01:00:05.450 --> 01:00:07.580
up going to UC Santa
Cruz to study journalism

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:09.251
and becoming a journalist?

01:00:09.251 --> 01:00:11.750
ANIL ANANTHASWAMY: It was just
a 90-mile trip down the road.

01:00:14.410 --> 01:00:17.920
No, seriously, it
was around, I think,

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:21.310
I was in Berkeley building
network management systems.

01:00:21.310 --> 01:00:23.220
In fact, I have a
colleague from that company

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:24.446
who was here at Google.

01:00:24.446 --> 01:00:25.320
I don't see him here.

01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:32.130
I think four or five
years into my software job

01:00:32.130 --> 01:00:36.070
in Berkeley I really began
to feel the desire to write.

01:00:36.070 --> 01:00:37.800
And I thought I would
be writing fiction.

01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:39.716
And so I would take a
few months off each year

01:00:39.716 --> 01:00:42.455
and try my hand at fiction.

01:00:42.455 --> 01:00:43.830
And then somebody
told me what do

01:00:43.830 --> 01:00:47.240
you UC Santa Cruz program,
which is science communication

01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:49.000
program-- science
writing program.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:54.780
And that was a really key moment
because I really love science.

01:00:54.780 --> 01:00:56.000
And I love reading about it.

01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:59.130
And it never occurred to me that
it is something I could write.

01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:01.590
So when I found out
about the program,

01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:02.950
I said, OK, it's just one year.

01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:05.030
How long can I go?

01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:07.790
So I went and did the program.

01:01:07.790 --> 01:01:10.670
The program led to an internship
with "New Scientist" in London.

01:01:10.670 --> 01:01:13.690
So I went to London
for six months.

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:15.180
And I was still
wondering whether I

01:01:15.180 --> 01:01:18.230
could earn a living doing
writing So I came back.

01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:21.880
And for the first year,
maybe about 10 months,

01:01:21.880 --> 01:01:24.880
I did double duty about
three and a half days

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:28.300
of writing more code and
then three and a half days

01:01:28.300 --> 01:01:32.250
of writing not code,
but journalism.

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:34.540
And then 10 months
into it, I realized

01:01:34.540 --> 01:01:36.144
I could pay my
bills with writing.

01:01:36.144 --> 01:01:36.810
And that was it.

01:01:36.810 --> 01:01:39.206
After that, I haven't
been writing code.

01:01:39.206 --> 01:01:40.330
Though I like writing code.

01:01:40.330 --> 01:01:41.900
And don't mistake me.

01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:47.000
But I think I like
writing stories much more.

01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.290
So it wasn't a difficult
transition in that sense.

01:01:50.290 --> 01:01:52.360
It's really something
I wanted to do.
