00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.380
I think what is probably the
most misunderstood concept in

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:07.930
all of science, and as we all
know is now turning into one

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.160
of the most contentious
concepts, maybe not in

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.980
science, but in our popular
culture, and that's the idea

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.230
of evolution.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.400
Whenever we hear this word, I
mean, even if we don't hear it

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.910
in the biological context, we
imagine that something is

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.850
changing, it is evolving.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.880
And so when people use the word
evolution in our everyday

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.190
context, they think of this
notion of change, that-- this

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.410
is going to test my drawing
ability-- but you

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.000
see an ape bent over.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.590
We've all seen this picture at
the natural museum, and he's

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.230
walking hunchback like that, and
his head's bent down and--

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.490
oh, I'm doing my best.
That's the ape.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:53.750
Maybe he's also wearing a hat.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.280
And then they show this picture
where he slowly,

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.760
slowly becomes more and more
upright, and eventually, he

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.000
turns into some dude, who's
just walking on his way to

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.330
work, also just as happy,
and now he's

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.940
walking completely upright.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:11.170
And it's some kind of
implication that walking

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.810
upright is better than
not walking upright,

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:14.710
et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:16.570
Oh, he doesn't have
a tail anymore.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:19.170
Let me eliminate that.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.640
This guy does have a tail.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.980
Let me do it in an appropriate
width.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.920
This guy has a tail, so you're
going to have to excuse my

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.670
drawings skills, but we've
all seen this.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.370
If you've ever gone to a natural
history museum, and

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.770
they'll just make more and
more upright apes, and

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.750
eventually you get to a human
being, and it's this idea that

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.550
the apes somehow changed
into a human being.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.850
And I've seen this in multiple
contexts, even inside of

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.060
biology classes and even the
scientific community.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.630
They'll say, oh, the ape evolved
into the human or the

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.270
ape evolved into the pre-human,
the guy that almost

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.020
stood upright, the guy that was
a little bit hunchback, so

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.760
he looked a little bit like an
ape and a little bit like a

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.970
human and so on and so forth.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.650
And I want to be very
clear here.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:08.800
Even though this process did
happen, that you did have

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.640
creatures that over time
accumulated changes that maybe

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.760
their ancestors might have
looked more like this, and

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.070
eventually they looked more like
this, there was no active

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.500
process going on called
evolution.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.960
It's not like the ape said, gee,
I would like my kids to

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:32.050
look more like this dude, so
somehow, I'm going to get my

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.740
DNA to get enough changes
to look more like this.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.250
And it's not like
the DNA knew.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.730
The DNA didn't say, hey, it is
better to be walking than to

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.540
be kind of hunchbacked
like an ape.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.740
And so therefore, I'm going to
try to somehow spontaneously

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.440
change into this dude.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.890
That's not what evolution is.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.810
It's not like-- you know, some
people imagine that maybe

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.400
there was a tree.

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.420
There's a tree, and on that
tree, there's a bunch of good

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:02.670
fruit at the top of the tree.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.500
Maybe they're apples.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.410
And then maybe you have some
type of cow-like creature, or

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:16.140
maybe it's some type of
horse-like creature that says,

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.250
gee, I would like to get to
those apples, and that just

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.740
because they want to get
there, maybe the next

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:25.360
generation-- they keep trying to
raise their neck, and then

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.890
after generation after
generation, their necks get

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.870
longer and longer,
and eventually

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.280
they turn into giraffes.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.680
That is not what evolution
is and that's not what it

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.950
implies, although sometimes
the everyday notion of the

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.960
word seems to make us
think that way.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:42.290
What evolution is-- and
actually, this is the word

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.200
that I prefer to use-- it's
natural selection.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.540
Let me write that word down.

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.240
Natural selection.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.670
And literally, what it means is
that in any population of

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.560
living organisms, you're going
to have some variation, and

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.310
this is an important
keyword here.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.850
Variation just means, look,
there's just some change.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.380
If you look at the kids in your

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:13.480
school, you'll see variation.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.410
Some people are tall, some
people are short, some people

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.550
have blond hair, some people
have black hair,

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:18.720
so on and so forth.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.829
There's always variation.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.700
And what natural selection is is
this process that sometimes

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:29.750
environmental factors will
select for certain variation.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.830
Some variations might not
matter at all, but some

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.290
variations matter a lot.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.150
One example that's given in
every biology book, but it

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.500
really is interesting is-- I
believe they're called the

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.310
peppered moth.

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.480
And this was in pre-Industrial
Revolution England that these

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.590
moths-- some of the moths were--
let me see if I can

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.400
draw a moth.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.200
I think you get the idea.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.160
Let me draw a couple of them.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.770
Let me draw a few
peppered moths.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:02.550
A couple of peppered
moths there.

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.040
Let me draw one more.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.700
So most peppered moths, there
was just this variation.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.820
Some of them were-- I guess we
could call them more peppered

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.430
than others.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:14.120
So some of them might
look like this.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.310
You know, they had-- let
me do other colors.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:19.300
Let me do a white.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:21.770
So it had spots like that.

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:25.852
Some of them might have
looked more like that.

00:05:25.852 --> 00:05:29.730
And, of course, they had some
black spots on them.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.680
And then some of them might
have been-- just

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:33.790
barely have any spots.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:35.330
You just have this natural
variation.

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.190
Like you'd see in any population
of animals, you'll

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.920
see some variation in colors.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.450
Now, they were all happy,
probably for thousands of

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.150
years, just this natural
variation.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:48.190
It was a non-important trait
for these peppered moths.

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.000
But then, all of a sudden, the
Industrial Revolution happens

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.270
in England, and all this soot
gets released from all of

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.080
these factories that are running
these steam engines

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.370
powered by coal.

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.260
And so, all of a sudden, a lot
of the things that once were

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.680
grey or white, for example,
maybe some tree trunks.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.670
Let me draw some tree trunks.

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:10.370
Maybe there were some tree
trunks that used

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.440
to look like this.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.940
You know, maybe it looked like
a-- maybe it kept a-- maybe

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.190
some tree trunks used to look
something like this, and a

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.400
peppered moth would
be pretty OK.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.230
Maybe there are some tree trunks
that were pretty dark.

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.610
But all of a sudden, the
Industrial Revolution happens.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.010
Everything gets covered with
soot from the coal being

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:30.870
burned, and then all of
a sudden, all the

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:31.900
trees look like this.

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.320
They're just completely pitch
black or they're a lot darker

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.980
than they were before.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:40.100
Now, all of a sudden, you've
had a major change to these

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.810
moths' environment, and you have
to think what is going to

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:44.910
select for these moths?

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.730
Well, one thing that might get
these moths are birds and the

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:51.380
ability of the birds
to see the moths.

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.300
So all of a sudden, if the
environment became a lot

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:57.310
blacker than it was before,
you can guess

00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:58.550
what's going to happen.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:03.280
The birds are going to see this
dude a lot easier than

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:04.990
they're going to see this dude,
because this dude on a

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.980
black background, he's going
to be a lot harder to see.

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.150
And it's not like the birds
won't catch this guy.

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:11.670
They'll catch all of them, but
they're going to catch this

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:14.080
guy a lot more frequently.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.340
So you can imagine
what happens.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.020
If the birds start catching
these guys before they can

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:21.300
reproduce, or maybe while
they're reproducing, what's

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:22.590
going to happen?

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.820
This guy, the darker dudes, are
going to reproduce a lot

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.430
more often, and all of a sudden,
you're going to have a

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:32.100
lot more moths that
look like this.

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:36.560
You're going to have a lot
more of these dudes.

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.430
So what happened here?

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:42.540
Was there any design or was
there any active change by any

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:43.250
of the moths?

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:46.230
Did any of the moths-- I mean,
it looks like a really smart

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:47.840
thing to do to become
black, right?

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:50.320
Your surroundings became black,
and you wait a couple

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.120
of generations of these moths,
and now all of a sudden, the

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.860
moths are black.

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.200
And you might say, wow, those
moths are geniuses.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.820
They all somehow decided to
evolve into black moths in

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.100
order to hide from the
birds more easily.

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.890
But that's not what happened.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:08.260
You had a lot of variation in
your peppered moth population.

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:10.850
And what happened was that when
everything turned darker

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:15.160
and darker, these dudes right
here-- and dudettes-- had a

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:18.450
lot less success
in reproducing.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:21.160
These guys just reproduced more
and more and more, and

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.170
these guys got eaten up before
they were able to reproduce or

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:25.940
maybe while they were
reproducing so that they

00:08:25.940 --> 00:08:29.470
couldn't produce as many
offspring, and then this trait

00:08:29.470 --> 00:08:30.750
just became dominant.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:32.990
And then the peppered moth just
became-- you can kind of

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:35.059
view it as a black moth.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.110
Now, you might say, OK, Sal.

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:37.730
That's one example.

00:08:37.730 --> 00:08:38.500
I need more.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.340
This is natural selection.

00:08:40.340 --> 00:08:42.510
It's purported to apply
to everything.

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:51.520
It purports to explain why we
evolved from basic bacteria or

00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:54.370
maybe even self-replicating RNA,
which I will talk about

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.660
more in the future.

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:56.930
I need more evidence of this.

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.670
I need to see it in real time.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.990
And the best example of this
is really the flu.

00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:08.140
And I'll do other videos in the
future on what viruses are

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:09.170
and how they replicate.

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:10.900
Viruses are actually
fascinating, because it's not

00:09:10.900 --> 00:09:12.510
even clear that they're alive.

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:17.530
They're literally just little
buckets of DNA and sometimes

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.950
RNA, which we'll learn is
genetic information, and

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:24.200
they're just contained in
these little protein

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.990
containers that are these neat
geometrical shapes, and that's

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.020
all they are.

00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:36.000
They're not like regular living
organisms that actively

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.090
move and that actively have
metabolisms and all that.

00:09:39.090 --> 00:09:41.295
What they do is they take that
little DNA, and they inject it

00:09:41.295 --> 00:09:43.980
into other things that can
process it, and then they use

00:09:43.980 --> 00:09:46.050
that DNA to produce
more viruses.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:49.880
But anyway, we can do a whole
series of videos on viruses,

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.960
but the flu is a virus.

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:55.910
And what happens every year is
you have a certain type a

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:01.580
virus, and they have
some variation.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:07.680
I'll just make the variation
by how many dots they have.

00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:09.530
And they infect-- let's
say it's a human flu.

00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:13.400
They infect humans, and slowly
our immune systems, which we

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:16.730
can make a whole set of videos
on as well, start to recognize

00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:20.050
the virus and are able to attack
them before they can do

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:21.110
a lot of damage.

00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:23.160
So now you can imagine what
happens if, let's say, that

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.650
this is the current flu.

00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:25.390
Let me do all of them.

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:28.080
They all have these little two
dots and that's how-- and

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.720
we'll talk in the future what
these dots are and how they

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.460
can be recognized.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.940
But let's say that's how our
immune system recognizes them.

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:35.960
They start realizing, oh, any
time I get this little green

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:39.230
dude with two dots on it's,
that's not a good thing to

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:41.190
have around so I'm going to
attack it in some way and

00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:46.120
destroy it before he infects my
DNA and all the rest. And

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:50.210
so you have a very strong
natural selection once immune

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:53.690
systems learn what this virus
is-- and we'll talk more about

00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:56.770
what learning means for an
immune system-- that they'll

00:10:56.770 --> 00:11:00.670
start attacking these
guys, right?

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.060
But flu, you can kind of think
of them as being tricky, but

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:05.010
they're not really tricky.

00:11:05.010 --> 00:11:07.980
They're not sentient objects,
but what they do do is they

00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:09.440
constantly change.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:12.630
So what you have is, in any flu
population, you're always

00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:14.040
having a little bit of change.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.870
So maybe the great majority of
them have those two dots, but

00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:19.470
maybe every now and then, one
of them has one dot, one of

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.780
them has three dots, and maybe
that's just a random mutation.

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.400
This just randomly happened.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:29.880
Maybe this is one in every--
I'll make up a number: One in

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:34.020
every million of these viruses
have this only one dot instead

00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.000
of two dots.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.220
But what's going to happen as
soon as the human immune

00:11:38.220 --> 00:11:40.910
system gets used to attacking
the virus

00:11:40.910 --> 00:11:42.790
with the two red dots?

00:11:42.790 --> 00:11:46.080
Well, then this guy isn't going
to have to compete with

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.580
the other virus capsules
for infecting people.

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.510
He's going to have people's
DNA all to himself.

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:54.360
And so he or she, or whatever
you want to call this virus,

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.770
is then going to be
more successful.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.970
So by next year's flu season
when people start sneezing and

00:11:59.970 --> 00:12:02.250
are able to spread it on
doorknobs and whatever else

00:12:02.250 --> 00:12:06.150
again, this guy's going to
be the new flu virus.

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:09.520
So when you see this process
of every year there's a new

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:13.000
flu virus, that is evolution
and natural

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.260
selection in real time.

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:15.040
It is happening.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.980
It isn't this thing that only
happens over eons and eons of

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:22.420
time, although most of the kind
of the substantial things

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:25.410
that we see in our lives or even
ourselves are based on

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.640
these things that happened over
eons and eons of time,

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.550
but it happens on
a yearly basis.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:32.040
Another example is if
you think about

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.510
antibiotics and bacteria.

00:12:33.510 --> 00:12:36.040
Bacteria are these little cells
that move around, and

00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:37.490
we'll talk more about them.

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:40.390
They actually are definitely
living.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:44.910
They have metabolisms
and whatever else.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:46.200
And this is just a nice note.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:49.840
When people talk about
infections, it could either be

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:52.430
a viral infection, which are
these things that go and

00:12:52.430 --> 00:12:55.210
infect your DNA and then use
your cell mechanisms to

00:12:55.210 --> 00:12:57.870
reproduce, or it could be a
bacterial infection, which are

00:12:57.870 --> 00:13:00.850
literally little cells that move
around and they release

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:03.290
toxins that make you sick
and whatever else.

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:06.000
So bacteria, these are what
antibiotics kill.

00:13:10.730 --> 00:13:11.980
Actually, I don't think
there's a hyphen.

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:18.050
They attack bacteria.

00:13:18.050 --> 00:13:19.380
They kill them.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.750
If you know a couple of doctors
or whatever and you

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:22.590
say, hey, I'm sick.

00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:24.330
I think I have a bacterial
infection.

00:13:24.330 --> 00:13:26.090
Give me some antibiotics.

00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:29.840
A responsible doctor says no,
I won't give you antibiotics

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.310
just willy-nilly, because what
happens is, the more

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:36.070
antibiotics you use, you're
more likely to create

00:13:36.070 --> 00:13:39.190
versions-- and I want to be very
careful about the word

00:13:39.190 --> 00:13:41.370
create, because you're not
actively creating them.

00:13:41.370 --> 00:13:44.080
But let's say-- and let
me finish my sentence.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:49.880
You're very likely to
help select for

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.290
antibiotic-resistant
bacterias.

00:13:52.290 --> 00:13:53.540
Now, how does that work?

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.110
Let's say that these are all
bacteria and you have

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.360
gazillions of them, right?

00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:01.900
Every now and then,
you get one that's

00:14:01.900 --> 00:14:05.510
slightly different, right?

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:11.290
Now in a population of bacteria,
these all will make

00:14:11.290 --> 00:14:14.820
you equally sick, and this is
just some random difference in

00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:15.440
the bacteria.

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:18.510
Maybe on its DNA some slight
different changes happened,

00:14:18.510 --> 00:14:20.870
but whatever happened, these
all are a kind of bacteria.

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:22.700
You don't want to get a lot
of them in your system.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.720
Your immune system can attack
them and fight them off, but

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.590
if you get a lot of them, then
they might kill you or make

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.140
you sick or whatever else.

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:31.780
Now, if everyone just starts
using antibiotics when they're

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:35.460
not sick or when they don't
really need to in a

00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:38.070
life-or-death situation, you
might have an antibiotic that

00:14:38.070 --> 00:14:40.260
is really good at killing
the green bacteria.

00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:43.390
But what happens if you
all of a sudden kill a

00:14:43.390 --> 00:14:45.110
lot the green bacteria?

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:50.240
Well, now the blue bacteria have
the whole ecosystem that

00:14:50.240 --> 00:14:54.850
before it was competing with all
these green dudes to get

00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.880
at all the good stuff inside of
your body, but now he's all

00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:01.830
alone, and now he can replicate
willy-nilly.

00:15:01.830 --> 00:15:06.790
So now he's going to replicate
willy-nilly, and obviously--

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:10.300
once again, it wasn't like there
was any design, there

00:15:10.300 --> 00:15:13.400
was any intelligent process
here that said look, this

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:17.435
bacteria should-- some bacteria
said, oh, I'm going

00:15:17.435 --> 00:15:22.040
to be little bit smarter and
design myself to resist this

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.140
antibiotic threat.

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:23.790
No!

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:26.160
There's just these random
changes that happen, and

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:30.410
mutations and viruses and
bacteria happen frequently and

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:32.360
these random changes that
happen, and this might be a

00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.300
one in one billion
change, right?

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:38.810
But all of a sudden, if you
start killing off all of the

00:15:38.810 --> 00:15:41.570
people it's competing with, this
guy can start replicating

00:15:41.570 --> 00:15:44.800
really fast and then become
the dominant bacteria.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:49.280
And then all of a sudden, that
antibiotic that you had

00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:52.470
developed very carefully to
destroy the green dudes is

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:55.070
useless, and you have
this superbug.

00:15:55.070 --> 00:15:56.860
You might have heard
the word superbug.

00:15:56.860 --> 00:15:58.380
That's what a superbug is.

00:15:58.380 --> 00:16:00.350
It's not like it designed
itself somehow.

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:02.140
It's just that we got very
good at killing its

00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:05.340
competition, and so we allowed
it to take over, and we can't

00:16:05.340 --> 00:16:07.920
kill it, because all of the
drugs were just good at

00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:09.050
killing its competition.

00:16:09.050 --> 00:16:12.150
These bacteria just keep
mutating and keep mutating,

00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:14.720
and if we use these antibiotics
a little bit too

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.150
heavily, we'll always be
selecting for the things that

00:16:18.150 --> 00:16:20.130
won't be affected by
the antibiotics.

00:16:20.130 --> 00:16:22.330
Well, anyway, I think I've
spoken long enough, but this

00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:23.890
is a fascinating, fascinating
topic.

00:16:23.890 --> 00:16:30.190
And I really wanted to make this
my very first video or

00:16:30.190 --> 00:16:33.820
lecture if you will, on biology,
because if you really

00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:36.410
went to-- you know, biology is
the study of life, and we can

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:37.970
talk about what life
is, whether

00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:40.490
viruses are living, whatnot.

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:42.850
But if you really want to study
living systems, you

00:16:42.850 --> 00:16:44.880
really can't make any
assumptions other

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:45.970
than natural selection.

00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:49.310
We could go to another planet
where the creatures don't have

00:16:49.310 --> 00:16:53.040
DNA, or maybe they have some
other type of hereditary

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.700
information stored in their
cells, or they replicate some

00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.480
other way, or they're not
even carbon based.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.960
Maybe they're silicon based.

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.450
And if we went to that type of
a planet in order study the

00:17:02.450 --> 00:17:06.210
biology on that planet,
everything else we know about

00:17:06.210 --> 00:17:09.970
biology, about viruses and
DNA, would be useless.

00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:13.410
But if we do understand this one
concept, this one concept

00:17:13.410 --> 00:17:17.940
of natural selection, that your
environment will select,

00:17:17.940 --> 00:17:19.089
and it's not-- you
know, there's no

00:17:19.089 --> 00:17:20.260
active process here.

00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.670
It's just random stuff happened
and they randomly

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:23.920
select for random changes.

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.410
And over large swaths of time,
and these are unimaginably

00:17:27.410 --> 00:17:31.570
large swaths of time, those
changes essentially

00:17:31.570 --> 00:17:33.820
accumulate, and they might
accumulate into fairly, fairly

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:34.660
significant things.

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:36.520
We'll talk more about this
in another video.

00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:38.190
See you soon.
