just can't get someone to like care
 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.509
just can't get someone to like care
about them yeah yeah we'd say it's more

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519
about them yeah yeah we'd say it's more
 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:42.770
about them yeah yeah we'd say it's more
chaotic now than it has been in recent

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780
chaotic now than it has been in recent
 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.020
chaotic now than it has been in recent
memory I don't think I don't think

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030
memory I don't think I don't think
 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.759
memory I don't think I don't think
that's it that's not a big statement is

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769
that's it that's not a big statement is
 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:48.619
that's it that's not a big statement is
that what happens is it was just an ebb

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629
that what happens is it was just an ebb
 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.449
that what happens is it was just an ebb
and flow when it comes to these sort of

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459
and flow when it comes to these sort of
 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.659
and flow when it comes to these sort of
situations when when it comes to like

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:53.669
situations when when it comes to like
 

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:54.800
situations when when it comes to like
what's going on the world power

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810
what's going on the world power
 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.509
what's going on the world power
struggles then the power struggles that

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519
struggles then the power struggles that
 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.640
struggles then the power struggles that
resolve and then new resistance builds

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650
resolve and then new resistance builds
 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.159
resolve and then new resistance builds
up I mean is that in your experience how

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:01.169
up I mean is that in your experience how
 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:03.860
up I mean is that in your experience how
things go well I think you you minimize

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870
things go well I think you you minimize
 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.089
things go well I think you you minimize
the chaos by being consistent and what

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099
the chaos by being consistent and what
 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.800
the chaos by being consistent and what
do I mean by that is is it you know in

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810
do I mean by that is is it you know in
 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.479
do I mean by that is is it you know in
as foreign policy as an example if your

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489
as foreign policy as an example if your
 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.759
as foreign policy as an example if your
foreign policy message is consistent and

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769
foreign policy message is consistent and
 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.509
foreign policy message is consistent and
and strong and clear and there's no

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:16.519
and strong and clear and there's no
 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.229
and strong and clear and there's no
misunderstanding by either your allies

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239
misunderstanding by either your allies
 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.339
misunderstanding by either your allies
or the people that that are against us

or the people that that are against us
 

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:24.800
or the people that that are against us
then you can minimize the chaos that

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810
then you can minimize the chaos that
 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.200
then you can minimize the chaos that
exists if it's not consistent and

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210
exists if it's not consistent and
 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.470
exists if it's not consistent and
there's

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480
there's
 

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.960
there's
confusion over where we stand and I'm

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:29.970
confusion over where we stand and I'm
 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.610
confusion over where we stand and I'm
saying we because you know okay fine

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:31.620
saying we because you know okay fine
 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.440

whether people are comfortable with that
or not I don't know but so if we're not

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:38.400
or not I don't know but so if we're not
 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.210
or not I don't know but so if we're not
consistent in that message then there's

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220
consistent in that message then there's
 

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.620
consistent in that message then there's
confusion and that's where you start to

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630
confusion and that's where you start to
 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:43.700
confusion and that's where you start to
get problems because you start to get

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710
