&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Hello,
everyone, it's 4 o'clock

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:08.300
and I come from radio, so
we start right on time.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.410
I actually don't come from
radio, but I like to say that.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.710
You guys look great.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.970
Is this a poetry crowd or
is this a biography crowd?

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.760
Thank you for being here.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.990
My name is Terence Samuel.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.520
I am the deputy managing
editor at NPR

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.320
and I am doing this moderating
this panel because I stole it

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.070
from other more qualified
people.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.670
People who knew more about
moderating panels and know more

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.990
about poetry, but I wanted to
do it because this is the kind

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.180
of panel I would have gone to.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.570
And, so, I am with you and
we'll see how these guys

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.760
perform today.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.120
So, you are at a panel
on literary lives

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.970
and before we go any
further we were supposed

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.470
to be one moderator
and three authors.

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.610
Fiona Sampson is not with
us, because she is in London

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.690
at the bedside of her husband

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.130
who has been hospitalized
in London.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:32.740
So, we send her our thoughts and
prayers and we'll try to honor

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.820
that by having a
great discussion.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.030
I promise you that this
is going to be fantastic,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.280
because how could it not be?

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.190
Let me do some quick
introductions.

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:58.890
On my right, Mark Eisner, author
of "Neruda, a Poet's Coin."

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.860
I'm looking at the board.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.940
And what I think has
developed is that we get

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:13.470
to have a great discussion about
poetry and why poet's important

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.660
and biographies are important.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.770
And on my life, Kay
Redfield Jamison, who is --

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.700
how can I say it, legend?

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.000
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON: No.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.300
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: She says no.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.600
Everybody says yes.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.900
You guys win.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:38.040
Again. And let's
just jump right in.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:45.860
Because we are talking about
two kind of amazing poets.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.790
And the thing that
struck me going in is,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:56.350
poetry is like this hugely
precise measured thing

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.090
where you pay incredibly
important attention

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.910
to the language and structure
and I think what we get

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:10.840
from both of these books
is the question of how

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.560
on one hand a sense
of revolution

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.940
and on the other a sense
of kind of instability,

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.160
both mentally can
create this amazing art

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.080
and this beautiful thing.

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:32.140
So, I'm going to begin by asking
the question I have, which is,

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:39.670
when you read poetry and
particularly these two poets,

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.850
Robert Lowell and Neruda, you
spend a lot of time reading

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.220
and rereading just to get
some sense of what it means.

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.740
And here comes these two
books which basically insist

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:57.890
that what you have to
do is ask the question,

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:03.000
what is it about what's not in
the poem that matters as much

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.390
as what is in the poem?

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.710
So, I'm going to put that
question out and ask either --

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.160
Mark, you can go first.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.950
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: Thank you,
both of you, first of all

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.370
and everybody out here.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.820
I think in terms of my book
and what I wanted to do,

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:21.750
besides the whole -- there's
three different things

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.340
about my book that I wanted to
address in terms of the life

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.000
of Neruda and there's also
very interesting parallels

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.290
between the forces of
whether the revolution

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.560
and also the mental
illness with Robert Lowell,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.050
but to look at both
his life, his poetry

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.310
and then his political
activism, revolution, both on

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.370
and off the page and if
anything I think would help

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.360
in what people have responded
to somewhat with my book,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.000
is that the poetry itself
by looking at the life

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.810
and for Neruda the political
activities that he did

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:03.010
that affected the poetry,
you get the context.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.350
You understand what he was doing
while he was writing that poem,

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:09.560
that when we just opened up a
book without a big introduction,

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:12.470
we're not sure about
exactly whether it's event

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:14.280
"Twenty Love Poems"
or the "Canto General"

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.470
or all different
types of his thing.

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.360
So if anything, I think
putting that context

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.270
as you were convoluting to,
to be abler to understand

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.560
that poem on a brighter sense.

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:26.160
Where -- also when you
read it sometimes it's nice

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.930
to not know the context as well,
just like a song or something.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.820
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Okay.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.260
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON:
Yes, I think in the case

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:38.370
of Robert Lowell, as you say,
is it very difficult poet

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.550
to read -- or I would
say a lot of his poetry,

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.140
quite a bit of his poetry
is not that difficult,

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:45.200
but much to read
was very difficult.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.520
So you have to spend
a lot of time

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:49.980
and there's never been a
time when I didn't feel

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.740
like it was worth the while
having spent that time.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:01.030
Writing a book about him
for me was a labor of love.

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:05.370
He and I had not much in common,
except having the same illness.

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.470
And when I was 17 I had my
first bipolar breakdown,

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.830
my English teacher in
high school gave me a copy

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.200
of Robert Lowell and said, "I
think you might like his work."

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.620
And I have lived with it sense

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:23.150
and had the opportunity
finally to write about him.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:25.300
And what you find
in his work is --

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:28.820
I mean, his mental illness does
not define him, but what he did

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.960
with his mental illness
does define him.

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.640
He had enormous personal
courage, enormous discipline.

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.050
A great art and he
brought all that to bear

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:44.220
and I think a remarkable
life's work.

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:53.330
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: so, here's
my one question about poetry

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:58.040
in particular and
these two poets.

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:04.370
When you read these books you
get a sense of complete kind

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.990
of chaotic tumultuous upheaval.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.230
I mean, maybe that's the word,
upheaval in both these lives

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:19.410
and then you read the poetry and
it is so incredibly structured

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:25.180
and beautiful and how do you get
-- what is the bridge from this

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.870
and in your case,
you make the case

00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:31.860
that this may actually
be related

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:34.310
and the one may actually
cause the other.

00:07:34.310 --> 00:07:40.300
How do you get from this
tumults to this beautiful thing?

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:42.290
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON:
I think first and foremost

00:07:42.290 --> 00:07:46.150
by the art itself, but
also huge discipline.

00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:47.680
Again, I think there
are a lot of people

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.680
who have perhaps great
talent and great upheaval,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:57.150
but aren't' able to bring it to
bear and make it into great art

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.850
and I think what defined Lowell
was he worked really hard.

00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:02.300
He woke up in the
morning working,

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.400
he went to bed at night working.

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.300
He said he created
when he was manic

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.550
and that is certainly
true up to a point.

00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:12.730
He created a lot of
chaos and lot of words

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.130
that didn't make much sense.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:17.400
Took a few of them
and when he was normal

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:21.490
and depressed he worked and
worked and worked some more.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.520
So, I think there's no way

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:30.310
to overstate how much raw
discipline the man had,

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:33.220
both in that and in his
life and his relationship.

00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:35.380
It was chaos, his
life was chaos.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:37.500
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: But
you also made the case

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:43.700
that there is some causation
relationship between creativity

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.370
and the kind of mental illness

00:08:47.370 --> 00:08:51.570
that Lowell suffered is
beyond this particular poet.

00:08:51.570 --> 00:08:52.870
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON:
Yes, in some people,

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.180
there's certainly
an accumulating,

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:58.570
very large literature, including
recent studies of hundreds

00:08:58.570 --> 00:09:01.300
of thousands of people
looking at that relationship,

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.610
that suggests a very much
increased rate of bipolar

00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:08.460
for example in people
who are highly creative,

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.700
not just in the arts, but in the
sciences and business as well.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:14.520
Clearly you don't' have to have
a mental illness to create.

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:19.170
I mean, it's rather that some
people what they do with it

00:09:19.170 --> 00:09:22.110
and what they generate is
beholden to their illness.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:26.370
But, as I say, if he had only a
bad mental illness and genius,

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:30.140
he would not have been
able to do what he did.

00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.770
It was the work and
concern and love of art.

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:36.780
I mean, he loved his
art, he loved poetry.

00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:38.080
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Mark,

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.690
in the case of Neruda you
have a slightly different kind

00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:47.960
of dynamic where here you
have a revolutionary poet,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:50.960
I mean, Lowell was

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.300
intentionally not political.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.640
Walked away from it.

00:09:56.640 --> 00:10:00.350
Refused to go to the White House
when he was invited in 1964,

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.460
I think, by President Johnson.

00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.610
Here you have like an
intentionally political poet

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:12.940
who actually when did write
about politics and revolution,

00:10:12.940 --> 00:10:16.850
in some ways in the English
speaking world is known mostly

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:21.340
for his poems about
love and sensuality

00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:27.280
and explain that to us.

00:10:28.590 --> 00:10:29.890
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: It's a
very interesting question

00:10:29.890 --> 00:10:33.960
about what comes to an audience,
especially the love poems

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.850
that are the most famous
were published in 1924,

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:40.420
so we're talking about
almost a 100 years later.

00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:44.000
And it's what speaks to us.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.760
I think there's something
about love poems

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.710
that speak to us universally.

00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:51.370
Everybody has those feelings
at one point or another

00:10:51.370 --> 00:10:55.240
or at all times that
they can relate to.

00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.630
There's also on the political
side, right now I think a lot

00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.950
of people are responding to
some of his political poetry

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:07.280
that he wrote in resistance to,
for instance, Franco in Spain,

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.580
when it was the first time

00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:11.110
that he really became
a political poet,

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:12.820
that has more resonance now,

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:15.990
than it might have
had 20 years ago.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:19.190
In a way there is a
universality of Neruda's poetry

00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:23.110
and that's why people
read a lot of him.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.380
But I think there's something
about the distillation

00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.930
of the human emotion, kind
of went back to that question

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.270
that you asked, why the poetry.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:33.360
Is that it distills the
emotions and there's kind

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:36.850
of nothing a little more
powerful than for a whole,

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:39.720
as you were saying, kind
of the whole popular thing.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.910
Whether it's Taylor Swift
saying -- dedicating an album.

00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:48.840
I know you're a Swifty, so
you got that smile there.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.410
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL:
He can admit it.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:54.490
I admit to nothing.

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.480
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: But, you
know, Taylor Swift admits --

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.860
not admits, she states
on her couple

00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:06.190
of albums ago album Red was
inspired by Pablo Neruda.

00:12:06.190 --> 00:12:09.520
But then you also have, you
know, he was Stalin and Marxist

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.120
and all this other stuff
and a million other things.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:15.690
But it's that -- I think there's
something about the love poetry,

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:20.900
just maybe like music, it's the
love songs that get us the most.

00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.200
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: So,
the assessment of both

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:25.360
of these poets is that they're
going to be read forever.

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:28.810
You know, somebody said
about Lowell, "You know,

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:33.150
as long as the English language
exists, he will be read,"

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:35.450
and clearly Taylor
Swift is reading it.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:38.080
Which brings me to
my question --

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:42.280
which brings me to my
question about today.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:48.880
I mean, this crowd to me is like
studding, because they're here

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.840
to hear us talk about poetry.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:59.850
Which in my mind is this really
precise kind of like super kind

00:12:59.850 --> 00:13:03.160
of overthinking of the
way we use language.

00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:10.900
And today we spend our
time thinking about Tweets.

00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:15.940
And I mean that in just
the way I just said it.

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:17.640
We're thinking about Tweets.

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:22.370
It is not a reference
to anything else.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:24.970
So, my question is,

00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:37.550
If you transported these
two poets to the modern,

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:44.070
how would they kind of
function in this current time,

00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:48.590
because I think in terms
of ideas and expression,

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:54.450
clearly they're timeless, but
in terms of how we use language

00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:57.170
and how we relate to
language and what we kind

00:13:57.170 --> 00:14:00.710
of like yearn for,
do you have any sense

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:06.270
of how these two
guys would function.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:10.560
And after this we can talk
a little about reading.

00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:12.410
You can go first.

00:14:12.410 --> 00:14:15.200
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: Well,
I think Neruda in terms

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:20.340
of our current political
climate right now in the 19 --

00:14:20.340 --> 00:14:22.160
in the 19 -- right
before he died,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.630
in the couple years before he
died, where it wasn't just a lot

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:26.930
of people around the world,

00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:29.000
during the United States had
some problems with Nixon,

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.190
but there was definitely more
acute problem or difficulty

00:14:36.190 --> 00:14:38.630
because Nixon was
involved with what set

00:14:38.630 --> 00:14:42.450
up to be the '73 Pinochet coup.

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.020
And he wrote a book
about Nixon [inaudible]

00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:47.440
and whether he would say
that about Trump or not,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.610
but I think he would
be writing about that.

00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:51.030
I don't think he
would be writing

00:14:51.030 --> 00:14:52.580
about love poems right now.

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:54.580
He would be writing
about on the forefronts.

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:58.110
He also did a lot of
stuff off of the page

00:14:58.110 --> 00:15:01.040
and to maybe extend
this a little,

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:03.650
he after the Spanish
Civil War he took some --

00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:05.990
what people call a
heroic act and was able

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:09.250
to bring Hispanic
refugees back to Chile

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:11.370
where only Mexico
and Chile were taken.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.860
And Ariel Dorfman in a recent
hot bed for the New York Times

00:15:15.860 --> 00:15:17.220
where they just had a --

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.630
and Chile had an election
where it based the campaign

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:24.070
on the right was based on
xenophobia and anti-immigration.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:29.080
And he said, one of the big
things of the piece was,

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:31.410
"Where are the Nerudas
of today?"

00:15:31.410 --> 00:15:33.370
But that speaks to the poetry

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:36.600
that he would be reacting now
I think, just as he reacted

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.790
to Nixon and how he stood up to
other people throughout his life

00:15:40.790 --> 00:15:44.140
and once he had his political
awakening after Spain.

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.740
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON:
I think one

00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.040
of the most interesting
things about Lowell and one

00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:51.650
of the things that
was most consistent

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:54.900
in interviewing his
friends and family,

00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:59.880
was that Lowell existed
throughout history perhaps

00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:03.470
from the same Twittering,
Tweeting aspects

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:09.270
of the current administration,
is an Historic sense.

00:16:09.270 --> 00:16:11.030
Lowell lived in history.

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:14.040
He would talk about Rome
as if he were a Roman.

00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:18.070
He would talk about
France and medieval France

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:19.390
as if he were living there.

00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:25.430
So, his imaginative capacity
should live in another era

00:16:25.430 --> 00:16:27.680
and with another people
and with another philosophy

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:28.980
was staggering.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:31.380
Everyone who knew him, I
mean, that was just an aspect

00:16:31.380 --> 00:16:34.150
of his imagination that
people commented upon.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:35.720
So, I think the odds
of his sitting

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:40.060
down Twitter now
things, would be minimal.

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:43.380
But I also think
that he would be --

00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.340
he sat in jail during a
certain part of World War II

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:51.140
out of political -- out of
being a conscientious objector.

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:54.940
But he also was probably -- or
was part of the leading edge

00:16:54.940 --> 00:16:57.590
of the artists against
the Vietnam War.

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:59.980
So he had a very strong sense

00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:04.720
of being an American whose
going way back before the

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.800
revolutionary war of
fighting the wars of America

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:12.620
and objections to those
he thought here unjust

00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:14.520
to people he thought
were unjust.

00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:18.120
So I would say he would
be politically ready,

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.080
he wrote a fair amount
of political material,

00:17:21.080 --> 00:17:24.640
but I think he also had this
just great grasp and love

00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:26.850
of history and a feeling
of part of history.

00:17:26.850 --> 00:17:28.420
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: I'm going
to ask you to read something

00:17:28.420 --> 00:17:36.350
in a second right after
I ask you to -- who --

00:17:36.350 --> 00:17:39.210
you asked the question,
who are the Nerudas today

00:17:39.210 --> 00:17:41.590
and do we need them to be poets

00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:45.110
or can they exist
somewhere else?

00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:46.570
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: I've
actually been --

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:50.930
yeah, I think the Nerudas
of today there's --

00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:54.860
there's everybody, all
the teenagers in Florida,

00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.280
I'm forgetting the name
of the high school.

00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.580
&gt;&gt; Parkland.

00:17:57.580 --> 00:17:58.880
&gt;&gt; Right, Parkland, the people

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.890
who left the shoes
on the Capital here.

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.630
It's all the poets
that are writing,

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.380
it's the people who
are coming here.

00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:08.490
We don't need one Neruda,
we need everybody or lots

00:18:08.490 --> 00:18:10.940
of people, poets,
artists, activists,

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:12.600
people who are going
to show up to vote.

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:14.970
It doesn't have to be a Neruda.

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.780
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Kay you
were talking about Americans

00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:21.890
and their sense of
history, I think you want

00:18:21.890 --> 00:18:23.190
to read something that --

00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:24.490
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON: Yeah.

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:26.350
If I -- from here or this way?

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:27.650
Woops.

00:18:27.650 --> 00:18:29.550
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Is
that going to work?

00:18:29.550 --> 00:18:32.250
Oh, actually, you
know, good from here.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.550
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON:
Probably not.

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:35.850
Okay. Sorry.

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.930
Story of my life
being [inaudible].

00:18:39.930 --> 00:18:41.680
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: It's
poetry, we have structure.

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:44.400
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON:
I just wanted to --

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:50.440
my husband and I were very
moved by watching the service

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:53.720
for Senator McCain this morning.

00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:56.820
The tradition, the
American tradition I think

00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:00.350
of protesting courage, and I
just wanted to read a little bit

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:04.810
about Robert Lowell, who was
first and foremost considered

00:19:04.810 --> 00:19:07.740
by himself and others
an American poet,

00:19:07.740 --> 00:19:09.920
but he was also a man of
great personal courage.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.150
And he had one of the worst
forms of bipolar illness

00:19:14.150 --> 00:19:16.830
that I've seen in somebody --

00:19:16.830 --> 00:19:20.140
a clinician and somebody who
studies this particular illness.

00:19:20.140 --> 00:19:21.440
He had a devastating form,

00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:24.880
he was in the hospital
20 times with mania.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.540
Very very bad form the illness.

00:19:27.540 --> 00:19:29.870
And each time came back.

00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:33.210
And he felt that way about
himself and he felt that way

00:19:33.210 --> 00:19:38.150
about his country, so I
just want to say - his wife,

00:19:38.150 --> 00:19:42.200
the great writer, Elizabeth
Hardwick, had said to him,

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:44.680
"You are a great
American writer.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.730
You have told us who
we are, like Melville,

00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:49.240
you have brought all the
cultured England and,

00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:52.110
of course even American, other
countries have something,

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:56.960
to bear on us, our land, on your
past, your people, your family.

00:19:56.960 --> 00:20:00.710
You are not an English writer,
but the most American of souls.

00:20:00.710 --> 00:20:03.120
The most gifted in finding
the symbolic meaning

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:05.370
of this strange place."

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:08.700
"You drank America," wrote
Seamus Heaney in his elegy

00:20:08.700 --> 00:20:12.410
for Lowell, "Like the
heart's iron vodka."

00:20:12.410 --> 00:20:16.120
For the union dead,
book about --

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:20.250
his poem about Massachusetts
regiment, black regiment

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:21.550
that fought in the Civil War.

00:20:21.550 --> 00:20:24.020
For the union dead is
the tribute of Lowell

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:28.470
to his country, like himself, a
place of mind and hard to know.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:31.400
"I love my country because
it's mine and all I know,"

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.490
Lowell wrote when
he was 30 years old,

00:20:33.490 --> 00:20:34.790
of George [inaudible].

00:20:34.790 --> 00:20:37.620
I think our culture can
stand comparison with others

00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:40.080
of the last 150 years.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.170
It's better than most probably.

00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:44.510
And, of course, we have
Roman virtues, energy,

00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:46.650
and even clarity of a kind.

00:20:46.650 --> 00:20:49.180
But there are times, oh,
yes, there are times,

00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:51.330
when one trembles and wonders

00:20:51.330 --> 00:20:55.090
if a people have ever
been so dehumanized.

00:20:55.090 --> 00:20:57.990
America could be a violent
godless place, but it was wild

00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:59.930
and beautiful in
their rebellion.

00:20:59.930 --> 00:21:03.210
It was a country that
believed in something better.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:07.850
It was ambitious, vast,
restless and it was his.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:11.640
"Where's America, he
asked, I've had it about me

00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.440
for 50 remembered years.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.540
It streams through my eyes."

00:21:15.540 --> 00:21:18.640
" The color of his blood
was American," he said.

00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:21.510
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Wow.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:29.280
[ Applause ]

00:21:29.280 --> 00:21:35.010
And that's just about the part.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:37.800
Before you -- you know,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:43.630
Lowell was very American,
very personal.

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:49.450
In some ways not just
American, but very New England.

00:21:49.450 --> 00:21:54.150
He was -- he was original
poet who kind of blossomed

00:21:54.150 --> 00:21:56.750
into this amazing thing.

00:21:56.750 --> 00:22:01.720
And Neruda was different and
the same in that, you know,

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:07.010
we don't know about southern
Chilean the same way, but,

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:12.110
you know, he kind
of looked at the --

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:16.500
the way that Lowell was kind
of internal and inward looking

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:21.080
in some ways, Neruda was
constantly kind of looking

00:22:21.080 --> 00:22:25.040
at the world and the physical
world in a very sensuous way

00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:32.290
and it's interesting to me that
in almost the same way kind

00:22:32.290 --> 00:22:34.770
of blossomed into this
kind of global reputation.

00:22:34.770 --> 00:22:37.860
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: Yeah,
I mean, definitely.

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:41.190
It just almost -- in somewhat of
a reverse, but very similar way

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:44.030
of Lowell in New
England and America,

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:51.040
Neruda was so identified,
but was also so much --

00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:52.990
Chile was so much a part of him,

00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:55.020
but at the same time
Latin America,

00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:01.870
kind of the greater exterior
region of his country, he --

00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:04.730
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: and at
times very anti-American.

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:09.200
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: In Latin
America, I mean, he wrote a book

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:13.420
that basically laid out -- I
mean, I was talking last night

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.020
to a Chilean friend and --

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:18.910
two Chilean friends and
they're basically like,

00:23:18.910 --> 00:23:22.100
"We see America still through
this book, "Canto General,"

00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.660
which he wrote in 1950,
where he laid out --

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:27.850
it's kind of his own
interpretation of the history

00:23:27.850 --> 00:23:30.270
of the Americas, but
there's still this identity

00:23:30.270 --> 00:23:33.820
through his poetry, you know,
at least these are somewhat,

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:36.580
you know, intellectual --

00:23:36.580 --> 00:23:38.780
if you want to use
that word, type people.

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:42.200
But there's this idea that
he created through his words,

00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:46.490
that people reflected and that
even in interviewing people

00:23:46.490 --> 00:23:49.840
in Chile and other places,
that they say they connected,

00:23:49.840 --> 00:23:51.140
for instance, through

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:55.020
"Canto General" one basically
a constructor worker said,

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:58.280
"This is how I was able to see,
this is the history not told

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.980
by the conquisitors, but by the
people that were Conquisted."

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.050
Sorry, the Spanish gets
a little bit stuck.

00:24:06.050 --> 00:24:08.130
But you got that hopefully.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.430
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Conquered.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:10.730
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: Conquered.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:12.860
Thank you.

00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:15.320
but, yeah, and then, you know,

00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:18.290
his global vision actually
started really when he went

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.830
to Spain and had the Spanish
Civil War and that opened

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:25.640
up the whole global anti-fascism
things and then there was

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.470
that -- him with Latin
America, but also like you said,

00:24:28.470 --> 00:24:33.880
there was the United States
of America and his working

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.720
against the policies that
so effected Latin America

00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:39.570
and Chile, especially
in the end.

00:24:39.570 --> 00:24:41.290
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: is there
something you'd like to read?

00:24:41.290 --> 00:24:43.900
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: I think with
that on that theme that --

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.710
we'll keep it with at, but yeah.

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:47.010
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Okay.

00:24:47.010 --> 00:24:49.440
We'll keep it moving.

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:53.910
So, let's go to this question.

00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:02.960
Why, at this point,
is poetry important?

00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:13.160
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON:
I think that poetry is --

00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.470
at this point, at one
reason I would say,

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:17.480
in addition to the usual
reasons for poetry,

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.380
is because it is difficult.

00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:24.990
Is there's something to be
said for having to work hard

00:25:24.990 --> 00:25:28.790
at something in order
to be rewarded

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:30.450
with the wisdom and beauty.

00:25:30.450 --> 00:25:35.860
And just the act of having to
struggle to understand lines

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.770
or rhythms or a particular
pattern,

00:25:38.770 --> 00:25:41.120
is not such a bad sort of thing.

00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.120
In this day and age or
probably any day and age,

00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.610
but particularly in
this day and age.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:48.940
I spent a lot of time on
college campuses and a lot

00:25:48.940 --> 00:25:53.290
of material is a little
predigested in a way,

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:56.320
and I think it's good
to really be able

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:58.210
to get in and understand it.

00:25:58.210 --> 00:26:01.570
But it's beautiful and it's
extraordinary and people

00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:04.390
who are great poets see the
world and I think human nature

00:26:04.390 --> 00:26:09.600
and psychology and love
and struggle and suffering

00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:13.860
and all the things that
are meaningful in life,

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:19.870
see them in a way that brings us
pass you to understanding things

00:26:19.870 --> 00:26:21.170
in a different sort of way.

00:26:21.170 --> 00:26:22.560
I think it's a great blessing.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:25.250
I think it can be hard, I
mean, obviously, I mean,

00:26:25.250 --> 00:26:28.090
when I said I was going to
do a book on Robert Lowell,

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.950
there was this kind of
look like, what on earth.

00:26:31.950 --> 00:26:35.320
But, you know, and then
it was ungluing to me.

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.550
My husband's a cardiologist
and Johns Hopkins

00:26:37.550 --> 00:26:39.890
and he would read
something and understand it

00:26:39.890 --> 00:26:41.550
about half the time that I did

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:43.430
and I thought, what
am I doing this.

00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:47.050
But, you know, it
was a wonderful thing

00:26:47.050 --> 00:26:48.350
to have to struggle.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:51.570
Even with poems I thought
I knew pretty well.

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:53.970
It was so worth it.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.180
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: I think
that all forms of art

00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:02.200
and creative expression
are always needed

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.800
and will always be needed.

00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:06.740
I think maybe right now in terms
of if we're looking at the terms

00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:10.050
of the questions why right now,

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:14.460
I think in these turbulent
times, not just politically,

00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:18.000
not just here and what's
happening in this city

00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:22.560
or elsewhere, but all over the
world, and with also Twitter

00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.280
and everything else, there's
something about the power

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.690
of poetry and the
distillation, how it's able

00:27:27.690 --> 00:27:32.870
to distill emotions and
thought in a way and convey it

00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:37.930
to the reader in a way that's
got this ability to kind

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:43.340
of shoot this potent arrow of
emotion or thought in a way

00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.670
that a twitter can't,

00:27:45.670 --> 00:27:49.950
other forms of art might
not, an article might not.

00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:54.140
and that's why I think even just
reading the poetry, just as much

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:57.160
as reading or experiencing
other art forms in ways

00:27:57.160 --> 00:27:59.900
in creative outputs, but
there's something that I think

00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.260
about that distillation
of the emotion

00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.620
or the political message,
which are one and the same,

00:28:06.620 --> 00:28:09.670
is so important and
that poetry is a way

00:28:09.670 --> 00:28:12.250
that that can be
transferred to the reader

00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:14.760
in a very impactful way.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:18.660
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Kay,
you have written about --

00:28:18.660 --> 00:28:21.520
I mean, in this book
in particular,

00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:27.410
about kind of the relationship
between illness and creativity.

00:28:27.410 --> 00:28:30.640
But it's also a book about
kind of heritage and --

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:34.390
I mean, the book
begins not with Lowell,

00:28:34.390 --> 00:28:40.190
but with his great
grandmother, right, I think.

00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:43.320
And, so, often we think
of these biographies,

00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:48.000
the thing that they illuminate
is, yes, the life of the person

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.410
and how they get from
person to artist, but --

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:58.080
and the time, your book
give us this kind of sweep

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:03.810
that says it's not just
Lowell, it's not just, you know,

00:29:03.810 --> 00:29:09.460
post war poetry, but
it's this kind of family

00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:15.800
that goes back to, you know,
Plymouth Rock and brings us

00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:22.740
up to essentially the Civil
Rights Movement and Watergate.

00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:31.500
And my question is, what did you
come away thinking about kind

00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:38.020
of the man and their
purpose of the work?

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:39.780
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON: Well,
first I think he was someone

00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:43.530
who was -- it wasn't just
the history of the world

00:29:43.530 --> 00:29:45.870
that he went in and out of,

00:29:45.870 --> 00:29:47.840
it was the history
of his own family.

00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:52.010
And I deliberately started my
book with his great grandmother

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:56.610
in Cambridge, Massachusetts
as she was about to --

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:59.310
from this great old house
that's now the president's house

00:29:59.310 --> 00:30:03.660
at Harvard, as she was being
taken to the insane asylum.

00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:06.790
And I did that partly because
you can say an illness is

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:08.710
genetic, which means it's --

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:11.320
it doesn't mean that
much to people.

00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:15.420
but if you see how this
illness relentlessly goes

00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.060
on in this pedigree,
this family jut --

00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:21.990
generation after
generation after generation

00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:25.530
and that this woman who was
living this wonderful life

00:30:25.530 --> 00:30:32.910
and seemingly so, abject misery,
that this kind of psychosis

00:30:32.910 --> 00:30:36.910
and mental illness respects
no social class, no anything.

00:30:36.910 --> 00:30:40.830
And Lowell was fascinated
by that and drawn to it

00:30:40.830 --> 00:30:44.910
of how did people
survive suffering?

00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:49.570
How did -- what role did
love play in all of that.

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:52.340
And I think that he was
very much a New Englander

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:56.980
and he respected and draw from
the New England writers in a way

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.210
in which I don't know any
other writer to make it

00:31:00.210 --> 00:31:03.760
so obviously clear that
his intellectual heritage

00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:07.520
and his heritage of
character was New England.

00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:09.360
But I was interesting
in writing a book,

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.870
not just about his
illness and his art,

00:31:11.870 --> 00:31:13.270
but also about his character.

00:31:13.270 --> 00:31:17.780
Because one of the things that
you see time and again in life,

00:31:17.780 --> 00:31:21.100
of course, is somebody
can be dealt a bad hand

00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.930
or a bad illness.

00:31:22.930 --> 00:31:28.100
And have very different reaction
as to how to play those cards.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:34.370
And Lowell played an incredibly
interesting hand of great genius

00:31:34.370 --> 00:31:39.210
of privilege and devastating
disease of enormous suffering

00:31:39.210 --> 00:31:43.600
that he had himself and
he caused to others.

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:45.850
And he did the best
that he could with it

00:31:45.850 --> 00:31:48.570
and that's what I was
most interested in.

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:50.480
I went in admiring Lowell,

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.740
I came out really
really admiring him.

00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.880
Because I guess I
had no real sense --

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:57.400
his daughter was kind
enough to give me access

00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.840
to his psychiatric
records to track them down,

00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.710
and his medical records,

00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:06.560
and I had no idea how bad his
illness was or how long he spent

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.430
in mental hospitals, how
long he spent in depression

00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:11.690
when he came out after his maze.

00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:14.870
And somehow he had to get back
and teach, he had to get back

00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:17.000
and write, he had to get
back into his relationships,

00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:19.500
he had to make all of the
apologies that one has

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.180
to after one's been manic.

00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:26.000
He did all those things as
best he could and I admired him

00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:29.260
for that ad above all
he kept to his art.

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:32.350
And that was important
to him above all else.

00:32:32.350 --> 00:32:34.920
He had a true north
start that he followed.

00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:42.550
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL:
Neruda was kind

00:32:42.550 --> 00:32:48.820
of driven in a different way.

00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:53.720
He was political and
revolutionary and kind

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:56.960
of created a language for
people to talk about revolution

00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:59.480
in Latin America in some ways.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:05.930
At the same time, he
went back and forth

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:09.040
about whether he was right
about what he believed.

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:12.970
And kind of questioned that,

00:33:12.970 --> 00:33:19.840
while constantly kind
of doing the work.

00:33:23.250 --> 00:33:24.550
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: Yeah.

00:33:24.550 --> 00:33:26.580
If I could just go back a
little bit to follow onto that

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.200
and then maybe go that,
onto your question.

00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:30.500
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Absolutely.

00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:33.500
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: It struck me
what a lot of people don't know

00:33:33.500 --> 00:33:37.820
about Neruda is that as a
child all the way until he got

00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:41.310
to Spain and the Spanish Civil
War and got into that world

00:33:41.310 --> 00:33:44.470
which -- where he really
became alive for the first time

00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:50.900
when he was about 26 or 30, he
was at times very depressed,

00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:53.920
almost manic, some of the
letters that Lowell wrote

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.900
to [inaudible], it was like
Neruda writing to this one --

00:33:56.900 --> 00:33:58.800
I mean, it was almost
like, you know,

00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:02.040
when he was like 12 years -- or
16 years old, these outrageous,

00:34:02.040 --> 00:34:03.880
almost manic letters like.

00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:06.120
And there's so many
similarities for that thing.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:09.540
And then at age 30
I even asked --

00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:11.830
tried to ask Neruda's
psychiatrist,

00:34:11.830 --> 00:34:13.610
how could he just --
because he wasn't --

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:14.950
it didn't seem like
he was bipolar,

00:34:14.950 --> 00:34:18.190
then all of a sudden he
switched and was, you know,

00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:20.260
just had bad moods,
like we all had.

00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:24.620
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: To the
sense that books saved him.

00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.850
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: That books
saved him, that words saved him,

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:30.330
that experience saved him,
how the chemical stuff changed

00:34:30.330 --> 00:34:32.590
in his mind, but something did.

00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:35.230
But going back to the
writing he always kept --

00:34:35.230 --> 00:34:36.800
there was the writing,
the language,

00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:40.510
even before the political
language, but this hermeticism

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:43.460
that now, like, "Residence on
Earth," which is considered one

00:34:43.460 --> 00:34:46.360
of the greatest books of
Spanish or any, you know poetry

00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:50.150
of the early past century,
it was through him trying

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:52.930
to express a lot of what
was going on in his mind

00:34:52.930 --> 00:34:54.680
that he was -- that
was during when he was

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:57.110
in the far east mainly,
and just totally emerged

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:59.890
in this deep depression
and also using some opium

00:34:59.890 --> 00:35:02.120
and other things that
he was trying to escape.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:03.760
But he kept going
because of the art,

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.220
because he needed
to publish his book.

00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:09.570
Partly on the ego, party of
his drive, and partly one

00:35:09.570 --> 00:35:12.790
of the reasons I call my book,
"The Poet's Calling," it's just

00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:14.900
like that, that was
his north star.

00:35:14.900 --> 00:35:16.740
I've got to write for myself,

00:35:16.740 --> 00:35:19.360
but also because
this is what I do.

00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:21.780
so, and the political -- yeah,

00:35:21.780 --> 00:35:24.400
I think we all question our
politics and whether we're right

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:30.190
or wrong and he also assumed
a role almost as a spokesman,

00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:32.970
he even in the Heights of
Machu Picchu talks about --

00:35:32.970 --> 00:35:36.980
assumes himself, says, "speak
my voice, speak your blood

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:39.470
through my voice," as
if he's a spokesman

00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:41.120
for these Incan slaves.

00:35:41.120 --> 00:35:42.690
So, he has this role
and that's even

00:35:42.690 --> 00:35:46.340
where the Stalinism comes in,
so to question that is kind

00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:49.070
of questioning everything
he believed in.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:51.590
You can't do it privately,
kind of in his head,

00:35:51.590 --> 00:35:53.480
because then he's
throwing everything out

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:55.810
and all his comrades
out with him

00:35:55.810 --> 00:36:00.430
by questioning that publicly.

00:36:00.430 --> 00:36:04.360
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: We are 15
minutes away from the end.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:08.560
And, so, we're going to
take some questions shortly.

00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:15.770
But let me ask one more and
it is a Neruda question.

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:22.910
Is there any way we have
a poet Neruda without kind

00:36:22.910 --> 00:36:27.110
of the Spanish Civil War and
the Chilean coup and resolution.

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:30.640
Is he a poet without
the revolution?

00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.630
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: Back to one
of your first questions, so,

00:36:33.630 --> 00:36:36.490
it's the "Twenty Poems of
Love," which he wrote --

00:36:36.490 --> 00:36:40.140
published when he
was 19, in 1924.

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:42.210
And that's, you know,
20 years, 30 years,

00:36:42.210 --> 00:36:44.070
40 years before all of that.

00:36:44.070 --> 00:36:46.420
Problem with Neruda though
is we know it, obviously,

00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:50.100
that half of it, the political
part, would not be part of that,

00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.240
but there's still so much
more to him and that,

00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:54.020
as we were talking before,

00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:56.340
that's what's almost
resonating more.

00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:59.690
Pablo Neruda the figure,
Pablo Neruda the icon, no.

00:36:59.690 --> 00:37:01.830
But would his poetry --

00:37:01.830 --> 00:37:05.170
that which has become one of
the bestselling books of poetry

00:37:05.170 --> 00:37:08.410
in the past century, "Twenty
Love Poems," would that live

00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:11.100
on without everything
else he did?

00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:12.730
I can't say.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:15.010
But it's the thing
that's living on the most,

00:37:15.010 --> 00:37:17.060
going back to the
original question.

00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:21.060
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: and here's
my little political question.

00:37:21.060 --> 00:37:28.160
He is very personal,
speaks in a way, I mean,

00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:31.780
he's be great on Twitter now.

00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:33.920
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON:
That's a wonderful idea.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:39.070
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: and he
chafes against all of this kind

00:37:39.070 --> 00:37:41.970
of tradition that --
this family he grew up in

00:37:41.970 --> 00:37:45.420
and he's rebelling and, you
know, he becomes Catholic

00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:50.930
and he goes back and -- but
he never actually engages,

00:37:50.930 --> 00:37:52.230
from what I can tell, in kind

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:55.470
of like the politics
of the day, you know.

00:37:55.470 --> 00:37:57.830
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON: Well,
he had that more, very much so.

00:37:57.830 --> 00:37:59.230
Yeah.

00:37:59.230 --> 00:38:03.610
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL:
Vietnam, he -- right.

00:38:03.610 --> 00:38:06.200
How did he manage
to like escape,

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:11.820
kind of like the bigger
political questions?

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:13.120
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON:
I'm not sure he did.

00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.350
I think that he would say that
there was a part of his writing

00:38:18.350 --> 00:38:22.520
that was always very political,
so that he was very caught

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.290
up in the Civil Rights Movement,

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:28.240
as well as in the
anti-Vietnam Movement.

00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:34.170
And he would say his best poem
was actually a poem that was

00:38:34.170 --> 00:38:36.400
from his abolitionist,
he had a long line

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:40.320
of abolitionist relation
and that was a poem

00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:42.180
that was deeply rooted

00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:47.490
in the views toward the Civil
Rights Movement of the 60s,

00:38:47.490 --> 00:38:49.950
as well as the Civil War
of the United States.

00:38:49.950 --> 00:38:52.240
So, I would think he did --

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:55.150
he was not perhaps
as overtly political,

00:38:55.150 --> 00:38:58.660
but he was pretty political
in a lot of his views.

00:38:58.660 --> 00:38:59.960
He was personal.

00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:04.100
He's remarkable as
personal as you might think.

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:07.380
I mean, from my point of
view, if you read him --

00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:09.930
to read him about his
illness he certainly writes

00:39:09.930 --> 00:39:12.680
about his illness and he
writes beautifully about --

00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:14.900
he writes a lot of things
very very personally.

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.170
But he writes quite
impersonally at times as well.

00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:21.580
Quite dissectively
about society.

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:23.960
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Questions.

00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:26.840
There are mics.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:33.450
&gt;&gt; My -- sorry.

00:39:33.450 --> 00:39:34.750
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL:
Over here first.

00:39:34.750 --> 00:39:36.320
&gt;&gt; Let the lady take it first.

00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:39.800
&gt;&gt; Hi, I have two
questions actually, please.

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.050
My first is for Mr.
Eisner, if you're familiar

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:43.540
with the book called,

00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:47.220
"The Neruda Case,"
by Roberto Ampuero.

00:39:47.220 --> 00:39:48.520
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: Yes, actually.

00:39:48.520 --> 00:39:51.110
&gt;&gt; Which is a fictionalized
version --

00:39:51.110 --> 00:39:55.280
or fictionalized story that
involves Neruda's life,

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:00.590
I was wondering how accurately
you thought Neruda was portrayed

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:03.380
in that fictionalized work?

00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:07.110
And my second question
is for both of you,

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:13.790
when we have fictionalized
versions of well-known writers,

00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:16.470
do you think that
that's a good thing

00:40:16.470 --> 00:40:20.000
to help just get
their stories out

00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:25.600
or do you think there are
inherent dangers in doing that?

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.030
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: In terms of,
"The Neruda Case," I'll have

00:40:27.030 --> 00:40:29.020
to confess it's been so
long since I've read it.

00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:32.680
Actually I kind of -- a
friend of mine translated it,

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.860
Carolina De Robertis,
who's a great writer,

00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:37.350
if any of you are
looking for a book.

00:40:37.350 --> 00:40:39.560
So, I can't really
speak to the accuracy

00:40:39.560 --> 00:40:42.020
of that or how it ties in.

00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:47.330
His case with Cuba was
very complicated, so,

00:40:47.330 --> 00:40:49.890
some of those complexities
do come up.

00:40:49.890 --> 00:40:52.840
But it was such an
extremely and fascinating,

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:58.140
because of the whole communist
Cuba and him throwing --

00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:03.060
you know, and the way he
voted or fought for --

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:08.800
Neruda fought for
revolution through democracy,

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.660
which is what happened
with [inaudible]

00:41:10.660 --> 00:41:13.570
where Cuba was obviously
was a different situation.

00:41:13.570 --> 00:41:16.770
In terms of the general
question, you know,

00:41:16.770 --> 00:41:21.010
it keeps coming up, because
there's a movie now about 2

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:24.160
or 3 years ago called, "Neruda,"
by the Larrain brothers,

00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:26.430
with Gael Garcia Bernal,
I actually was able

00:41:26.430 --> 00:41:27.910
to see a rough cut of that kind

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.900
of in the making while they were
here filming the Jackie movie,

00:41:30.900 --> 00:41:34.220
while I was writing
this biography.

00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:36.700
So, here's -- in that
movie, as they call it,

00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.340
almost market it
as an anti-biopic.

00:41:39.340 --> 00:41:42.330
So, I mean, not just
fiction, but, like, you know.

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:46.380
And it was very difficult
to read that or to watch

00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:49.380
that while I was trying to
be so accurate and truthful.

00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.260
And whether it's a service
or disservice, I can't say.

00:41:52.260 --> 00:41:53.560
I do believe, personally,

00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:54.950
as much as I respect
the film makers,

00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:58.880
that some of their
portrayals were not accurate

00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:03.300
and give the public a portrayal
that I don't feel is right

00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.600
and kind of -- especially
about some of the characters.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:09.830
So, I don't know if
you have some more.

00:42:09.830 --> 00:42:11.770
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON: I
think it's just going to happen.

00:42:11.770 --> 00:42:17.130
I mean, and you know, depends on
how well it's done and I think

00:42:17.130 --> 00:42:18.920
in the case of Lowell,
Lowell seems

00:42:18.920 --> 00:42:22.690
to have pulled very
strong positive feelings

00:42:22.690 --> 00:42:25.770
and very strong negative
feelings from people.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:28.010
Mostly very positive,
certainly from the people

00:42:28.010 --> 00:42:31.050
who knew him well, who
loved him a great deal.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:34.300
There was a play a
few years ago about --

00:42:34.300 --> 00:42:36.440
based on the letters
of Robert Lowell

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:40.850
and Elizabeth Bishop
called, "Written in Air."

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:42.150
Written in Air?

00:42:42.150 --> 00:42:45.480
No. Yeah. Anyway,
that was quite good.

00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.810
I mean, but even there
you can say, "Okay, well,

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:50.170
maybe one wouldn't
emphasize this or that,

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:52.180
but to me it was just wonderful

00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:54.980
that Sarah Ruhl took
two great writers

00:42:54.980 --> 00:42:56.850
and brought them to life.

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:59.420
You know, you don't have to
agree with the portrayals.

00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.240
I mean, I think like
you, I think it's painful

00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.740
if you spend a lot of time
with somebody in libraries

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:08.220
and talking to people who
knew the person and so forth,

00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.800
it's a little difficult
to see them yanked

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.810
through the fictional
mode, but that's, you know,

00:43:12.810 --> 00:43:17.230
I think it's a different way
of writing and understanding.

00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:19.780
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Over here.

00:43:19.780 --> 00:43:22.300
&gt;&gt; Mark, I am an
Indian poet diplomat

00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:27.670
and a great admirer of Neruda.

00:43:27.670 --> 00:43:33.340
I want to mention this passage
from his autobiographer,

00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:37.920
which I'm sure as
a writer of a book

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.470
on Neruda you would
have paid attention to.

00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:43.480
It's a very small passage.

00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:47.780
"One morning I decided to go
for all and grabbed by her

00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:50.840
by the wrist and
looked her in the face.

00:43:50.840 --> 00:43:53.530
There was no language
I could speak to her.

00:43:53.530 --> 00:43:58.070
She allowed herself to
be led by me smilelessly

00:43:58.070 --> 00:44:00.850
and soon was naked upon my bed.

00:44:00.850 --> 00:44:05.440
Had extremely slender waist,
full hips, the overflowing cups

00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:07.760
of her breasts, made her exactly

00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:10.590
like the thousand
year old sculptures

00:44:10.590 --> 00:44:12.710
in the south of India.

00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:18.690
The encounter was like
that of a man and a statue.

00:44:18.690 --> 00:44:22.350
She kept her eyes opened
throughout and moved.

00:44:22.350 --> 00:44:25.640
She was right to
regard me with contempt.

00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:28.960
The experience was
not repeated."

00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:34.680
Was Neruda a rapist?

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.980
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: In
that situation

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:38.460
in my book I call it a rape.

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:45.360
There was just a paper that came
out, I'm not trying to whatever,

00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.350
but it said that I was the
first one in all the biographies

00:44:48.350 --> 00:44:51.530
to call it for what it was,
which was a rape or a violation,

00:44:51.530 --> 00:44:52.830
however you want to define it.

00:44:52.830 --> 00:44:55.110
It's a little tricky,
I'm not going --

00:44:55.110 --> 00:44:57.840
well, I was just about
to say, "I'm not going

00:44:57.840 --> 00:44:59.270
to define what a rape is

00:44:59.270 --> 00:45:00.690
and what it isn't,"
but I call it a rape.

00:45:00.690 --> 00:45:01.990
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: You did.

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:03.290
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: Exactly, I did.

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:05.650
So, it's actually gotten in
terms of the review and kind

00:45:05.650 --> 00:45:08.630
of the discourse in the
narration of what's come

00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:13.360
out of this book, or after the
publication a lot of people say,

00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.850
"I can't read Neruda because
he's a rapist anymore.

00:45:15.850 --> 00:45:18.570
Or I can't read him anymore
because he's a rapist."

00:45:18.570 --> 00:45:20.370
And I think if you see --

00:45:20.370 --> 00:45:23.120
I was actually just trying in
that time to find the passage

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:26.490
where I talk about after
the rape and how he sees her

00:45:26.490 --> 00:45:31.160
as stone as he talks about,
as, you know, a statue.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.250
And that was this difficult
time when he was in the Far East

00:45:34.250 --> 00:45:36.490
and depressed and he
took that attitude.

00:45:36.490 --> 00:45:39.690
But it's also very complex
in terms of the, you know,

00:45:39.690 --> 00:45:42.620
why we writing the poetry is
there is a lot of context.

00:45:42.620 --> 00:45:48.410
Not to invalidate how bad that
was and how awful an experience

00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:51.180
and how, you know, shameful and
that's why I wrote about it.

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.480
I could have skipped that.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:56.410
That passage was from his
memoirs, which came out in 1972.

00:45:56.410 --> 00:45:57.970
And now they're saying
I'm the first person

00:45:57.970 --> 00:46:01.160
to call it what it
is, it was a rape.

00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:03.100
But there is a lot
that goes on to it.

00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.910
Why he wrote it, he was the
only one who wrote about it,

00:46:05.910 --> 00:46:08.540
there was no witnesses, he
didn't have to write about it,

00:46:08.540 --> 00:46:09.840
his wife kept it in there.

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.170
But it's very complex.

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:12.750
But, yes, he raped that woman.

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:15.990
He described -- at least he
describes that he wrote it,

00:46:15.990 --> 00:46:18.940
whether or not that
was even true.

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:20.790
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: You...

00:46:20.790 --> 00:46:22.310
He wrote it, you wrote it,

00:46:22.310 --> 00:46:24.640
so I guess answers the
question -- answered.

00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:26.940
Over here.

00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.780
&gt;&gt; Over here.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:34.080
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: I think
we're going back --

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.380
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Somebody.

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:36.680
Go ahead.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:37.980
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let me ask about a
different aspect of Neruda.

00:46:37.980 --> 00:46:41.480
You know, Neruda --
Alastair Reid used to say --

00:46:41.480 --> 00:46:44.300
talk about, "The Great
Tablecloth, and the poem,

00:46:44.300 --> 00:46:46.430
"The Citizen," in the
book, "Estravagario."

00:46:46.430 --> 00:46:51.110
As examples of his magnificent
political poems, poetry,

00:46:51.110 --> 00:46:52.590
and the reason I mention that is

00:46:52.590 --> 00:46:55.750
because of the language
of those poems.

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:59.770
And sort of the prejudices
one has in one's mind

00:46:59.770 --> 00:47:02.600
when one hears the
term, political poetry.

00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:05.780
And when thinks of
jargon and so on.

00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:09.830
So, I'm wondering if you could
reflect on the contribution

00:47:09.830 --> 00:47:15.060
of Neruda, the language in which
he writes his political poems.

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:17.550
Now, I agree, of
course, he wrote a lot

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:19.950
and there are weaker
poems, stronger poems,

00:47:19.950 --> 00:47:22.590
but could you talk about how --

00:47:22.590 --> 00:47:25.490
well, if you could
make the argument

00:47:25.490 --> 00:47:31.960
that Neruda very proudly
makes political language

00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:35.950
in poetry sing and move and
stir people to the direction.

00:47:35.950 --> 00:47:37.250
&gt;&gt; MARK EISNER: Okay.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:38.550
Yeah, no, I think
exactly, I mean,

00:47:38.550 --> 00:47:40.710
that's one of the great
things about Neruda

00:47:40.710 --> 00:47:45.700
and his political poetry was
how he was able to express only

00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.870
in its very simple way, like the
poem, "The Great Tablecloth,"

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:51.880
which is basically let
us spread this tablecloth

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:53.180
so everybody can eat.

00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.860
It's almost like a slogan,
but it becomes poetry.

00:47:55.860 --> 00:47:58.320
And nobody should be, you
know, nobody should eat alone,

00:47:58.320 --> 00:47:59.620
nobody should be hungry,

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.040
that they all come
to this tablecloth.

00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.020
Or even his ode, which followed
that, which are "The Ode

00:48:04.020 --> 00:48:06.390
to the Onion," "The
Ode to the Artichoke,"

00:48:06.390 --> 00:48:08.310
but they all have these
political messages,

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:09.610
but are so simple.

00:48:09.610 --> 00:48:11.890
And even one of his
first poems from Spain,

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:14.820
"I Explained Some Things,"
he's just explaining things,

00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:16.170
but he does this in a little --

00:48:16.170 --> 00:48:18.340
he ads the poetry
that gets to you.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:22.120
In the short time we have right
now that's basically, you know,

00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:24.350
I could talk a lot
more about that.

00:48:24.350 --> 00:48:28.060
But it's simple, but with
that little twist of poetry

00:48:28.060 --> 00:48:29.360
that really get to you.

00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.660
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL:
It's the power.

00:48:30.660 --> 00:48:31.960
We'll take one more.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.680
&gt;&gt; In relation to the
topic of mental illness

00:48:34.680 --> 00:48:38.070
and the connection
between it and creativity

00:48:38.070 --> 00:48:42.530
and with Lowell specifically,
you mentioned how he had to work

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:45.580
so hard for him to overcome
his hospitalizations

00:48:45.580 --> 00:48:48.900
and his episodes of mania and
everything, so I was wondering

00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:54.170
if you believed that that hard
work and effort that he had

00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:58.070
to take to overcompensate
for the disabilities

00:48:58.070 --> 00:49:02.200
that his illness caused him was
what really enabled his creative

00:49:02.200 --> 00:49:03.930
genius and his success?

00:49:03.930 --> 00:49:08.150
Or is it something about
the mental illness itself

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:12.490
that was able to, like,
steer him that way?

00:49:12.490 --> 00:49:14.540
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON:
Again, it's really complicated.

00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:20.040
I think one of the things that's
been really extensively studied

00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:24.970
is the relationship
of mania to changes

00:49:24.970 --> 00:49:30.640
in the way people respond and
use words and the repetity

00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:32.550
and the originality of
the words that they used.

00:49:32.550 --> 00:49:37.060
So, if I give you the word onion
and ask you to come up with

00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:40.190
as many associations to
that word onion in a period

00:49:40.190 --> 00:49:44.830
of a minute, there are national
norms that could say, okay,

00:49:44.830 --> 00:49:46.850
how many did you come up with

00:49:46.850 --> 00:49:49.380
and how original
were your responses?

00:49:49.380 --> 00:49:51.540
And mania, people when --

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:54.860
sorry, there's just this
blinding light here --

00:49:54.860 --> 00:49:56.160
in mania --

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:57.460
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL:
Don't look over there.

00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:58.760
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON: --

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:00.140
tend to come up with
many more responses

00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:01.650
and many more original
responses.

00:50:01.650 --> 00:50:06.730
Now, in the case of Lowell that
kind of boldness, originality,

00:50:06.730 --> 00:50:13.720
speed of thinking, eruptive
temperament, boldness

00:50:13.720 --> 00:50:18.990
and real recklessness, along
with this incredible genius

00:50:18.990 --> 00:50:21.120
to begin with and along

00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:26.550
with this incredible
intellectual history

00:50:26.550 --> 00:50:30.800
and learning and literature
and history and biography

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:33.870
and all the things that he
loved and studied so well,

00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:39.750
that when those combined they
made a uniquely original mind

00:50:39.750 --> 00:50:41.050
and poet.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.960
So, what Lowell described
and what his doctors

00:50:43.960 --> 00:50:45.370
in the hospital described

00:50:45.370 --> 00:50:49.090
or what his colleagues described
is this pattern of coming

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:52.450
up with -- generating all sorts
of thoughts and ideas and images

00:50:52.450 --> 00:50:54.890
when he was manic
in the hospital.

00:50:54.890 --> 00:51:00.700
And then when he got well, as he
got well, putting them together,

00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:04.270
getting rid of the ones that
were useless and just gibberish

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:07.530
and cultivating and
developing the ones

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:08.830
that were helpful to him.

00:51:08.830 --> 00:51:10.850
And, of course, he wrote
a lot when he was well.

00:51:10.850 --> 00:51:13.190
I mean, it wasn't just
that he was creating things

00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:14.490
when he was manic.

00:51:14.490 --> 00:51:18.480
But he felt very strongly
that the mania was generative

00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:21.480
in the way he wrote
and the way he thought.

00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:24.160
And the people who knew
him best felt that way.

00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.880
And his doctors actually wrote
quite a bit about it in tract

00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:29.340
of his history and his
history of writing and so forth

00:51:29.340 --> 00:51:32.220
and you could certainly see
it in his writing pattern.

00:51:32.220 --> 00:51:33.520
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL:
We're going to take one,

00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:34.820
because we have one minute left.

00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:36.620
&gt;&gt; Okay, thank you.

00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:41.830
Dr. Jamison, this is a
question out of my ignorance

00:51:41.830 --> 00:51:46.760
in art and creativity.

00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:50.640
The thing is, when you look
at Van Gogh's paintings,

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:54.540
like the Starry Night,
is that art

00:51:54.540 --> 00:52:00.750
because of his mental illness
and what does it say about me

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:05.750
if I see the same
thing he sees and likes

00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:08.890
that painting more
than the others?

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:10.240
&gt;&gt; KAY REDFIELD JAMISON:
Right, right.

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:14.510
I think it's very hard to make
a direct correlation one to one

00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:18.080
between -- I mean, for example,
the case of a Lowell poem,

00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:21.760
it was almost -- if you took
the drafts of his poems,

00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:24.690
the original ones and then
you saw the published poem,

00:52:24.690 --> 00:52:27.480
there's sometimes there
would be just one line

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.500
that would be shared in common.

00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:34.480
So, in poetry Lowell was a
famous reviser, he revised

00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.130
and he revised and he revised,
more than almost anybody.

00:52:37.130 --> 00:52:40.470
In the case of Van Gogh
it's probably more direct

00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:44.850
and more immediate and I think
people do respond to something

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:49.750
that fundamentally, again,
bold, original, powerful,

00:52:49.750 --> 00:52:54.160
straight from the heart, but
also great genius and somebody

00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:58.040
who just pursued his art
absolutely single mindedly.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.340
&gt;&gt; TERENCE SAMUEL: Thank you.

00:52:59.340 --> 00:53:01.110
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
