students some of the questions are

00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:54.390
students some of the questions are
 

00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:55.639
students some of the questions are
ridiculous and some of the things that

00:13:55.639 --> 00:13:55.649
ridiculous and some of the things that
 

00:13:55.649 --> 00:13:59.509
ridiculous and some of the things that
don't make sense but in terms of what's

00:13:59.509 --> 00:13:59.519
don't make sense but in terms of what's
 

00:13:59.519 --> 00:14:01.550
don't make sense but in terms of what's
called practical anthropology the

00:14:01.550 --> 00:14:01.560
called practical anthropology the
 

00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:03.319

students are asking questions and they

00:14:03.319 --> 00:14:03.329
students are asking questions and they
 

00:14:03.329 --> 00:14:05.750
students are asking questions and they
begin to talk and argue and debate the

00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760
begin to talk and argue and debate the
 

00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.759

a half an hour into the classroom we've

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480
a half an hour into the classroom we've
 

00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.970
a half an hour into the classroom we've
gone through maybe six or eight posters

00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980
gone through maybe six or eight posters
 

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.889
gone through maybe six or eight posters
and generally I learned something in the

00:14:12.889 --> 00:14:12.899
and generally I learned something in the
 

00:14:12.899 --> 00:14:15.170
and generally I learned something in the
process and that changes the dynamic

00:14:15.170 --> 00:14:15.180
process and that changes the dynamic
 

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.600
process and that changes the dynamic
because that's actually perfect we

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:17.610
because that's actually perfect we
 

00:14:17.610 --> 00:14:19.160
because that's actually perfect we
actually then take the classroom of

00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:19.170
actually then take the classroom of
 

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:20.360
actually then take the classroom of
American high school students and

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:20.370
American high school students and
 

00:14:20.370 --> 00:14:21.829
American high school students and
probably for the first time in their

herzl so it changes the dynamic

00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:33.100
herzl so it changes the dynamic
 

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:35.670
herzl so it changes the dynamic
because people are actually practicing

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680
because people are actually practicing

lecturing actually teachers then become

00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:58.570
lecturing actually teachers then become
