MARTIN OMANDER: Hi.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.650
Welcome back to Root
Access, the show

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.060
on Google Developers Live
where we talk about startups.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.310
My name is Martin Omander.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.430
I work in developer
relations, and I'm joined here

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.790
by my co-worker, Don Dodge,
longtime investor and startup

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:20.450
advocate.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:21.930
DON DODGE: Thanks for having me.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.388
MARTIN OMANDER:
Don, we've had lots

00:00:23.388 --> 00:00:28.770
of good viewer questions
come in as YouTube comments.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.140
One was from [INAUDIBLE],
and he or she

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.960
asks, "How big does your
idea have to be for it

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.300
to be successful?"

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.860
Pretty deep question.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.850
DON DODGE: It is.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.140
Multiple layers to that answer.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.590
So how big does the
idea have to be?

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.910
Not that big.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.490
Here are some examples.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.280
Carbonite is a company that
basically backs up your laptop.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.880
And the first time I saw that
idea, I thought, that's silly.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.690
You can do that
many different ways.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.950
But it turns out
it wasn't silly.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.660
It was a problem that
a lot of people had,

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.690
and they're now
a public company.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.970
Dropbox is another example.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.510
Dropbox is a very simple idea.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.740
It's transfer big files
over the internet.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.099
So it's not a complicated idea.

00:01:20.099 --> 00:01:20.890
It's a simple idea.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.380
But they are probably worth
several billion dollars now.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.340
Twitter.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:29.300
Twitter is going to
go public this week.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.580
But Twitter is a
very simple idea.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.000
It's basically instant
messaging broadcast

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.460
to whoever wants to subscribe.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.780
So are those big ideas?

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.230
No, not really.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.280
But they were
amazingly successful.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.430
So I think the bigger
question is, is it

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.730
an idea that's scalable?

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.030
Can it scale to millions
and millions of users?

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.350
Or is it in a market where you
can generate tens of millions

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.600
of dollars of revenue?

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.710
So that's really the way
to look at that question.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.509
Not is the idea big enough,
it's is it scalable enough?

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.800
I think a few weeks ago, we
talked about the difference

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.690
between lifestyle businesses
and venture-backed businesses.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.660
And lifestyle businesses
can be very lucrative

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.820
and make you very wealthy, but
they aren't venture capital

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.060
kinds of high growth
exit kinds of businesses.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.570
When venture capitalists invest,
they're looking for an exit

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.130
to get their money back.

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.860
Lifestyle businesses are more
cash flow profitable businesses

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.490
that may never sell.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.100
So those aren't
the kinds of things

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.410
that venture capital investors
want to get involved in.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.650
That's more like banks or
loans or that sort of thing.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.430
Still very lucrative and can
make you very wealthy, but not

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.180
something that a VC
investor looks at.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.230
MARTIN OMANDER: So these
lifestyle businesses

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.550
we're talking about.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:04.800
What kind of-- like
retail, services?

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.660
DON DODGE: Right traditional.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.740
Retail can be a very,
very lucrative business.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.470
You can have one store and
generate $10 million in revenue

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.290
and be very, very profitable.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.820
Or replicate that and
do four or five stores

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.890
and do $20, $30, $50 million in
revenue and be very profitable.

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:29.030
But those don't tend
to get acquired or exit

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.000
for 10s of millions of dollars.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.890
So when you're thinking about
starting those businesses,

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.494
you look at different
sources of financing.

00:03:36.494 --> 00:03:37.410
MARTIN OMANDER: Right.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.460
Got it.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.960
Great.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.130
Thank you.

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.060
We have another question
from [INAUDIBLE]

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:45.070
who said, "Very useful.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:45.890
Thank you."

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.280
Thank you, [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.830
Just one question,
"What if a startup

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.090
takes place in a
third world country?

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.680
I'm going through this and
find it very difficult.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.820
Any advice?"

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:57.600
DON DODGE: Yes.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.500
There are several
examples of companies

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.920
that have started in third
world countries that simply took

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.890
ideas that have worked or
been successful in the US

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.490
and customized them a bit
for their local market.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.019
So those aren't
that complicated.

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:21.160
It's just look at
something that has worked

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.300
in the US or another
market, and customize it

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.500
for your local market
and make it work.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:30.320
And you can be
amazingly successful.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.460
Don't be too proud to be
a copycat because there

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:38.010
are lots of opportunities there
where the bigger companies just

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.170
aren't watching.

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.990
Another approach
is solve problems

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.200
that are unique to your
market that may not

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.220
be problems in the US market.

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:54.340
So like SMS messaging
or money transfers

00:04:54.340 --> 00:05:00.530
or like WhatsApp is just an
instant messaging system that

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:02.640
works across
international boundaries.

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.860
And so those are problems
that we don't have in the US,

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.550
but are very viable
businesses outside.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.740
So either copy something
that works in the US

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:15.260
and make it work for
your local market,

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.850
or focus on a problem that
is unique to your market

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:23.027
and make that work.

00:05:23.027 --> 00:05:24.860
MARTIN OMANDER: I assume
[INAUDIBLE] is also

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:26.360
in a less-developed
market having

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.130
problems with raising capital.

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.460
What are your thoughts
on that when there's less

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:33.904
developed venture
capital market?

00:05:33.904 --> 00:05:34.570
DON DODGE: Yeah.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.910
There's always a
way to raise money,

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.080
it's just the investor
expectations are different.

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.010
So in those countries,
they very well

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:48.370
may be investors who want to
invest in cash flow businesses

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:49.950
and lifestyle businesses.

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:55.660
So they might invest $100,000
or a million dollars and say pay

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:01.360
me back $0.10 on the dollar
of your revenue until

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.270
my investment is paid back,
and then I'll just have a small

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:07.590
percentage after that.

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:10.360
So there are different
ways to structure it,

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.820
but there's always a
way to raise money.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:15.190
It's just a different
set of investors

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.472
and different expectations.

00:06:17.472 --> 00:06:19.180
MARTIN OMANDER: And
I guess it could even

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.160
be an advantage to being
a third world country.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.140
Your costs might be lower.

00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:25.867
DON DODGE: Significantly lower.

00:06:25.867 --> 00:06:26.950
MARTIN OMANDER: All right.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:27.700
Great.

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:28.650
Thank you, Don.

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:31.140
And remember, next
time blue shirts, OK?

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.015
DON DODGE: All right.

00:06:32.015 --> 00:06:32.832
Very good.

00:06:32.832 --> 00:06:34.540
MARTIN OMANDER:
[INAUDIBLE], [INAUDIBLE],

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.230
I hope those answers helped you.

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.990
Everybody else, please keep
the questions coming in,

00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:44.020
in the YouTube comments.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:46.500
So if you're a cloud
developer and you

00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.960
want to run on Google's
infrastructure,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.070
then you can get a credit
and you can get started.

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:55.320
The details are on the screen.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:59.110
It's a $2000 credit
to get you started.

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.020
Go ahead and sign up.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.010
I use the Google Cloud
platform all the time

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.020
for writing my Google
internal app for my team.

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.810
That's it.

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.940
See you next time.
