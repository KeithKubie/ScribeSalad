00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.500
Is there free energy hiding in your spare
change? In this video you'll learn how to

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:18.080
turn a handful of pennies into batteries that
can power some of your small electronic devices.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.350
For this project, I'll need pennies. My neighbor
Trevor gave me these and I'll begin sorting

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.720
them by date. I want pennies newer than 1982
because they're nearly 98% Zinc. Ok I've picked

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.720
out 10 pennies that I think will work, so
I'll use this 100 grit sandpaper and start

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.220
sanding one side of the penny. Actually, this
may be too much work, so I'll try some double

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.049
sided sticky tape and an orbital sander. This
is working much better to expose the zinc,

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:02.390
but the adhesive has melted from the friction,
and left these pennies in a sticky mess. No

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:06.180
problem, I'll just use some adhesive remover
to clean them up, and now they're looking

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.619
great! It's time to build a battery. I'll
cut some thin cardboard into pieces just bigger

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.860
than the penny, and throw them in some vinegar.
While those are soaking, I'll start my battery

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.680
cell by placing one of the pennies with the
copper side down on a piece of aluminum foil.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.840
As you can see, nothing is happening yet,
so I'll blot dry one of my cardboard pieces,

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.880
and place it on top. This time when I measure
the voltage, I'm excited to see over half

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.450
a volt from this one cell! I'll add another
penny and cardboard, and repeat the process

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.540
until I've stacked up all my pennies. Now
the cells are connected in series, and the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.200
electric potential has jumped to nearly 6
volts! Wow. This should be more than enough

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.460
voltage to drive an LED, so I'll test it out
with this one. It works perfectly, and I can't

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.630
believe how brilliantly this lights up. Just
for fun I'm testing the currant draw and it's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.500
pulling about 170 microamps. I can even light
up two at once. Ok, so it works, and it's

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.520
actually really impressive that I'm getting
electricity from pennies, but now I'm curious

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.430
to know how long this can last? I'll use some
electrical tape to hold everything in place,

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.390
and try to fix these cardboard edges because
they shouldn't be touching. I'll do my best

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.549
to make it air tight to prevent the wet cardboard
from drying out too quickly, and then carry

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.760
it with me for the next couple of hours to
watch when for it dies out. Ok so now it's

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.810
more than 2 days later and I really can't
believe what I'm seeing. The green light is

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.720
still on, which means these little pennies
are still pumping out juice! This is awesome,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.730
so I wanna try another idea. I've picked up
a calculator from the dollar store and I'll

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.810
remove the screws on the back so I can get
to the battery. Once that's removed I'll pull

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.370
the negative and positive leads out of the
casing. And now I'll need to make another

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.920
penny battery. This time I don't feel like
sanding the pennies, so I'm adding these zinc

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.500
washers I got from the hardware store for
about 3 cents each. I need around 1.5 volts,

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.709
so I'll use 3 pennies, 3 washers, and 3 pieces
of cardboard soaked in vinegar. This time

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.209
I've rounded the cardboard edges so they won't
be a problem. And I'll stack them with the

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:01.180
washer on the bottom, the cardboard in the
middle, and the penny on top. This is one

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.480
cell, and I need 3 so I'll stack up 2 more.
The penny on top is the positive side and

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.150
the zinc washer on bottom is the negative.
I'm getting just over 2 volts and 700 microamps,

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.500
so I'll add wires to the terminals and use
some more electrical tape to hold it together.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.819
Time to test it on the calculator. I'll press
the "on" button, and it's incredible, the

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.160
calculator fires right up! I'm testing out
a few functions and everything calculates

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.790
correctly, so now I just need to clean these
wires up a bit. I'll chip holes in the casing,

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.730
and hardwire my pennies into the battery leads,
then tape the penny stack to the back. A penny

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:39.170
powered calculator?! I really am impressed
at how well this worked out… …and still

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.030
patiently waiting for this little green light
to die out. Well there's an idea that's worth

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.270
a few cents. If you like this project perhaps
you'll like some of my others. Check them
