&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:23.940
&gt;&gt; Mark Winek: Welcome
to the annual meeting

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.540
of the Potomac Technical
Processing Librarians.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.970
My name is Mark Winek.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.970
And I've had the pleasure of
serving as the PTPL Chair for 2015.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:38.800
And, today marks our 91st
meeting as a group devoted

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.150
to the technical side of
supporting the informational needs

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.360
of school children, university
students, the legal profession,

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.430 position:56%
religious communities, the military,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.200
the marginalized, and
everyone in between.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.510
And, before we get the
days proceedings underway,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.960
I'll also get the thanks
out of the way.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.250
And, I would like to express
my deepest debt of gratitude

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.300
to the 2015 PTPL Advisory Board.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.400
If you're on the board, could
you please stand up just

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.890
so people can recognize you.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.070
Thank you.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.520
Not only have they made
each meeting a pleasure,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.250
they've each provided
their unique talents

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.170 position:56%
to make PTPL a stronger organization
in this year and for the future.

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.540
And, I'd especially like to
thank the Executive Committee,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.960
Vice Chair Tiffany Wilson,
Past Chair Linda Geisler,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.040
Secretary Sue Neilson,
and Treasurer Linda Wirth.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.680
We've especially to
thanks Linda Geisler.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.830
Linda returned to the PTPL
Advisor Board when we were in need

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.240
of an executive two years ago.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.740
Not only has she provided
her services faithfully,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.400
she used her good offices to insure

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.610
that we had a monthly meeting
place here in the Madison building

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:56.290
and took the lead on
coordinating the space

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.150
and catering required
for today's meeting.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.540
And, I also want to
thank Bobby Reeves,

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:04.300
our webmaster who keeps the website

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.350
and the conference
registration running year

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.040
after year without any complaint.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.340
And, Keri I hope that's reflected
on his annual review every year.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.310 position:56%
So, for your convenience, Wi-Fi is
provided by the Library of Congress.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.430
The network name is locguest while
and you won't need a user name

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.300 position:56%
and password but you will have to
consent to the terms and conditions.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.580
Restrooms are located out the main
entrance of the Montpelier room

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.970
across from the elevators
down the hall on the right.

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.250
There's a scheduled 15 minute
break in the proceedings at 11am

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.930
and lunch will be served from
12:15 to 1:15 in this room

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.110
with vegetarian options available.

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:50.330
And, if you don't keep
to a vegetarian diet,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.790
we ask that you insure
that there are plenty

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.900
of such options available
for those who do.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.490
And finally, just for
the next few minutes,

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.160
there are signup sheets available
at the registration table,

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.590
the optional Library of Congress
tour immediately after the meeting.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.700 position:56%
And so, the tour is complementary
but the space is limited and we have

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.830
to provide the numbers to the
doses early so please make sure

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.830
and preregister if you
are interested in that.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:23.410
So, without further
ado, it's my pleasure

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.780
to welcome our keynote
speaker Dorothea Salo.

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.710
Dorothea is a Faculty Associate
in the School of Library

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.010
and Information Studies at the
University of Wisconsin Madison.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.860 position:56%
At Madison, she teaches organization
of information, database design,

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.190
and surprising, and
surprisingly XML and linked data.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:45.070
She has presented internationally
on linked data

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.150
and data curation,
among other topics.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.080
Prior to her move to
Wisconsin, she spent two years

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.000
as a digital repository
services librarian

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.990
at George Mason University
in Fairfax.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.970
And, please join me in
welcoming Dorothea Salo.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.610
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Turn
this this way.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.730
We're doing the usual switching
laptops today while we're.

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.990
While we're waiting, I,
actually, personally would

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.110
like to thank Linda, thank
Linda for hosting me.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:38.560
It was very, very gracious
and I so appreciate it.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.610
and, thank you, all of you,

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.790
for the wonderful welcome
I've had here today.

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:44.130
So, I am Dorothea Solo.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.260
And, I am not nor have
I ever been a cataloger.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.860
Though, I may be, I'm not sure, I
may be one of the last generation

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:56.920
of library school students
who's actually required

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.600
to take a cataloging course.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:00.900
I don't know.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:03.890
I just know we, at the iSchool,
AW Madison are doing one

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:06.510
of our periodic major
curricular revisions.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.940
And, current odds are that we're
keeping the core organization

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:16.000
information course
because that's core.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.940
We're just changing it to
deemphasize MARC cataloging a bit

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.100
in order to include more
material that's relevant

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.500
to non-MARC environment because
that's where an increasing number

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:32.800
of our students are going.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.100
So, interesting times,
not that they're ever not.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:35.400
So, curriculum revisions,
they are never fun.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.310
They eat everybody's
time for months on end.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.630
They always cause bureaucratic
hassles out the wazzoo.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.930
For a while, you have to deal

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:42.230
with two different
incompatible curricula.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:43.530 position:56%
And remember, which are, which rules
apply to which student you're trying

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.830
to advise, next week's advising
week, so it's on my mind.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.130
And, it's, it's a mess.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:47.430
So, why do we do this to ourselves?

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:48.730
Right? Why do we bother if
it's such an awful hassle?

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.030
And, this is my answer.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:51.890
[ Speaking foreign language ]

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.780
Because it must be done.

00:05:55.780 --> 00:06:00.400
Just, in Latin it kind
of sounds cooler.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.890
We at the iSchool cannot
just sit back

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:06.100
and do what we've always done just

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:07.920
because we've always
done it that way.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.640
Not when the world that our
graduates are needing to fit

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.690
into is way different
from what it was

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:15.690
when we built the old curriculum.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.790
And, it doesn't mean we did a
bad job on the old curriculum.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:20.460
I don't think we did.

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.190
It's just that the world has
changed out from under it.

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:26.310
So, we have to change
the curriculum.

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.050
We don't have to enjoy it.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:34.640
We just have to do it
because it must be done.

00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:38.370
Not entirely coincidentally,
that's kind of how I feel

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.750
about the move away from MARC.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.530
It feels, to me, like a lot of
library professionals spend,

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.170
at least, half a decade
on the question.

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.320
[ Speaking in foreign language ]

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.940
Or, why must it be done.

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:54.110
If you know this question
sounds really cool in Latin,

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.860
I have completely lost
patience with it.

00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.880
Don't even tell me
nobody's asking this still,

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.720
I straight up heard it just
last May at the conference.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.310
Totally still out there
floating in the water.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.890
And, if you like water, here's
some nice water, nice harbor,

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:10.430
really pretty, love
the little lighthouse.

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:13.080
But, the thing that isn't
in this pretty picture

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.880
of a pretty harbor is a ship

00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:20.150
because the why can't we
use MARC ship has sailed.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.450
It has sailed.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.350
Not even having the why do we
have to change discussion today.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.650
I don't see the point.

00:07:25.650 --> 00:07:26.950
That ship has sailed.

for the IT division of the
Special Libraries Association.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:37.170
And, I was talking to SLA's
technical services planner,

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.990
Betty Landesman, maybe
some of you know her.

00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:40.290
She's local to this area.

00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:42.160
Was talking to her about
a linked data session.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.950
She rolled her eyes at me and she
said can we please not, right,

00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:50.540
do yet another intro to linked
data and why it's better than MARC?

00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:52.190
Can we not?

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:57.720
I've seen a ton of hose
and they don't help.

00:07:57.720 --> 00:07:59.020
Okay then.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.610
If I've got catalogers
yelling at me not to do this,

00:08:00.610 --> 00:08:04.370
I'm going to try not to do it.

00:08:04.370 --> 00:08:07.080
Because, really, the answer
is exactly the same as it is

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.010
for our curriculum
revisions at the iSchool.

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:10.310
[ Foreign language spoken ]

00:08:10.310 --> 00:08:14.670
Because it must be done.

00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:19.080 position:56%
I do want to mention, though,
because I come at technical services

00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:22.830
from an XML and metadata background
rather than a MARC background.

00:08:22.830 --> 00:08:26.870
But, it isn't just MARC cataloging
that the bell is tolling for here.

00:08:26.870 --> 00:08:30.900
There's zero chance that XML
based metadata practice is going

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.520
to stay the way it is
today, not going to happen.

00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.310
I already see it changing.

00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:40.220
Not even sure XML is going to stay
alive as a pure metadata format

00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:44.740
as opposed to uses like TEI for the
visual humanities, EAD for archives

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:47.740
where you're dealing with narrative
type documents that are intended

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.180
for mostly for human beings,
that's where XML really shines.

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:52.790
I think those will survive.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:55.610
But, XML for metadata, not sure.

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:58.530
And, you know, I'm
actually okay with that.

00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:03.030
I'm okay with XML's decline
as a metadata serialization,

00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:08.270
I never liked my nice clean elegant
document standard getting worked

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.910
over by the data engineers anyway.

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.510
Don't even talk to me
about an XML schema.

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:17.360
Maybe now I can have
XML back for documents,

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:18.660
the way it's supposed to be.

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:23.510

interested in this question.

that must be done?

What do we have to do to our

about how people find information?

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:46.010
I like this question
because it's pragmatic.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.240
I like this question because
it's intriguingly complicated.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:51.980
I like it because it's
nervy in all the best ways.

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:55.610
I like it because I'm an
inveterate fiddler with things,

huge masses of MARC

questions that we got to work

enough to just say well what we have

to do is we have to migrate our
data from MARC and mods and mets

We have to migrate all that
to link data then we're done.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:29.120
That's skipping all the steps.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:33.000
Right? that's an underpants
gnomes approach, you know,

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.980
migrate all the things to link
data, step two question mark,

00:10:35.980 --> 00:10:39.000
question mark, question
mark, step three profit not.

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:42.070
That's not enough.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:43.950
That's like saying we
have to pick up some rocks

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:46.950
and then we'll turn them
into a giant mosaic.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:50.380
Not enough information there.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:52.500
What's the mosaic design
going to be?

00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.000
Where's the mosaic
going to be built?

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.920
Where do we find the right colored
rocks and how do we cut them

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:01.270
up if they're too big or
they're not the right shape?

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.350
How do we glue all the rocks down?

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.890
What happens if somebody glues
down a rock in the wrong place?

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:08.300
What if there's an earthquake?

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:14.920
So yeah, we've got to work on some
process here, I think, for mosaics

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:18.930
and certainly for our
data and metadata as well.

00:11:18.930 --> 00:11:23.580
And the other reason I don't
think it's quite enough

00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:27.060
to say what we have to do is
migrate everything to link data is

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.560
that it assumes without proof

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:34.620
that link data is the ultimate
destination for all of our stuff.

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.530
Which yeah, now it's
the horse to bet on,

00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:38.180
I'm certainly not denying that.

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:43.880
But, I think link data gets
used as a stocking horse,

00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:47.000
sometimes a little
bit of a scapegoat.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.530
It's link data's fault we
have to change away from MARC.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:54.600 position:56%
It's link data's fault all of these
changes are happening to begin with.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.520
If it weren't for link data
supposedly being the new hotness,

00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:02.020
we could just stay the way we
are and everything would be fine.

00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:05.050
And, I don't actually
think that's true.

00:12:05.050 --> 00:12:09.130
If link data didn't
exist, and believe you me,

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:13.820
there are times I would love to
wipe RDF off the face of the earth,

00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.980
if there were not link data,
we'd still have to make changes

00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:24.580
in how we collect and organize
our catalog data and our metadata.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.110
And, we have to make those
changes for the same reason

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.330
that we're changing our
curriculum at the iSchool.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:33.950
The world is just plain changed
out from under the old ways.

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:37.760
And, that didn't happen
when the Library of Congress

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.290
or the British Library or
the National Library of Spain

00:12:41.290 --> 00:12:45.650
or the wonderful folks at
Oslo, that didn't happen

00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:47.920
when they announced
their link data plans.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.760
The changes happened a
lot earlier than that.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:13:00.270
They happened, these changes, when
paper cards gave way to the web

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:05.170
as the main way the patrons
interact with library catalogs

00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.770
and with digital collections.

00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.330
And, yeah, yeah, if you're,
I know there are people

00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.630
who are medievalists in here.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:14.620 position:56%
So, I cheated, the left hand
picture there is not actually paper,

00:13:14.620 --> 00:13:16.300
it's papyrus.

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:19.130
But no, that's when it happened.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:21.170
And, I mean, it's not
that we didn't notice.

00:13:21.170 --> 00:13:22.470
Of course we noticed.

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:23.770
How could you not?

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.190
It's just taken a while
for us to figure

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:30.290
out what we need to do about it.

00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:34.330
Oops, which I don't know how to
say that in Latin, but, oops.

00:13:34.330 --> 00:13:38.140
I think we maybe waited
longer than we should have.

00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.600
But that's, you know, that's
water under the bridge now.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.030
Leads me right back here.

00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:46.050
[ Foreign language spoken ]

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:51.580
What do we have to do now
that the work that we do has

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:54.280
to play nicely with computers?

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.580
And, not just computers.

00:13:55.580 --> 00:13:59.220
I mean, MARC was designed through
computers, but networked computers,

00:13:59.220 --> 00:14:00.960
computers that can
talk to one another

00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.130
because the network really
does kind of change the game.

00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:08.760
We're going to start
with my students,

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:14.510
when I teach our core organization
information course, I start here.

00:14:14.510 --> 00:14:18.140
[ Foreign language spoken ]

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:20.470
Which basically means
computers aren't real bright.

00:14:20.470 --> 00:14:23.110
I mean that.

00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:26.130
Computers are not all that
bright, I tell my students.

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:30.060 position:56%
You are way smarter than a computer.

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.200
And, I say this for
a lot of reasons.

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.020
One reason is knocking
computers off pedestals,

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.930
not actually literally knocking
computers off pedestals, though,

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:41.810
hey that would be kind of cool.

00:14:41.810 --> 00:14:43.170
But, you know, what I mean.

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:48.170
Right? A lot of my students
come into the iSchool thinking

00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:51.240
that computers are small gods.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.890 position:56%
They're magical, they're capricious,
they're inscrutable, they're liable

00:14:55.890 --> 00:15:00.830
to mess you up like Diana's about
to mess up that antelope there.

00:15:00.830 --> 00:15:03.960
And, I'm saying, I have
to get them to not think

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.080
that because the more
they understand

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.220
about how computers do work,
the better off they are

00:15:10.220 --> 00:15:12.560
and the better off we all are.

00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:15.980
But, actually, the main reason

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:19.660
that the notion the computers
aren't real bright is relevant

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:22.930
to this talk today is that,
from our point of view

00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:26.180
as literate human beings,
computers are not too bright

00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:31.470
in some very specific and
fairly easy to understand ways.

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:33.930
And, those ways tell us, actually,

00:15:33.930 --> 00:15:38.710 position:56%
pretty clearly what our catalog
metadata and other data have to look

00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:44.490
like if we want computers
to work effectively with it.

00:15:44.490 --> 00:15:49.590
And, really, this is no different
from how the shape and size

00:15:49.590 --> 00:15:51.920
of catalog cards and
the standard size

00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:57.100
of type written lettering shaped
how the MARC record had to look.

00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.350
The technology that you have
available in the card catalog,

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:04.100
totally technology, don't let
anybody tell you it isn't,

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.740
the technologies available to you
shaped how it makes the most sense

00:16:08.740 --> 00:16:12.400
to do things because different
technologies are good and bad

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:15.620
at different things and need
different things to function best.

00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:17.430
That's basic design theory.

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:21.530
If you haven't read Donald
Norman's Design of Everyday Things

00:16:21.530 --> 00:16:24.850
and a couple of its sequels
already, please read them.

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.150
Brilliant stuff that will,

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:29.500
it will explode your brain
in all the best ways.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:35.150
So, the first thing to remember
about computers and I hear,

00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:38.280 position:56%
I see some people already smiling,
they know where I'm going with this.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:42.190
The first things to remember about
computers is the text, right,

00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:46.940
the ordinary stuff that we write
every day for other people to read,

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:51.570
the text that we literate human
beings read and comprehend so fast

00:16:51.570 --> 00:16:56.660
so easily so accurately that we
hardly have to think about it.

00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:59.480
It is all Greek to a computer.

00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:02.910
Right. You knew that cliche
was showing up at some point.

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:04.690
How could I not?

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.840
Computers can't read.

00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:09.220
They are functionally illiterate.

00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.610
If anybody in this room has a
kindergarten age child at home,

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:14.860
your kindergartener reads

00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:19.460
and comprehends text immensely
better than a computer can.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:26.650
So, my head, one step toward
coping with illiterate computers,

00:17:26.650 --> 00:17:30.460
is dealing with our
addiction to textual notes.

00:17:30.460 --> 00:17:34.320
By way of example, I took these
MARC 504s straight from the Library

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:35.900
of Congress' MARC documentation.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:38.040
And, thanks for that, by the way.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:41.000
If anybody here's is in
anyway responsible for it,

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.550 position:56%
it is super helpful in my classroom.

00:17:43.550 --> 00:17:48.970
But, for example, if a
patron question that we would

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:54.140 position:56%
like our catalogs to be able to
answer is hey I'm new to this topic,

00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:58.190
can I get a recent book with
a good bibliography please.

00:17:58.190 --> 00:18:01.100
Right. Perfectly reasonable
question.

00:18:01.100 --> 00:18:03.520
These notes, being free text means

00:18:03.520 --> 00:18:07.300
that our catalogs can't
actually come up with an answer.

00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:12.920
Because, to get to an answer
means filtering a list of books

00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:15.850
by whether they have
a bibliography or not.

00:18:15.850 --> 00:18:19.710
And, to do that with MARC notes,
the computer has to read the text.

00:18:19.710 --> 00:18:22.980
And, it's got to understand that
bibliography and bibliographies

00:18:22.980 --> 00:18:27.390 position:56%
and bibliographical and literature
cited and sources and maybe whatever

00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:28.920
that Romanized Russian is.

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.970
I'm not even sure I
didn't look it up.

00:18:30.970 --> 00:18:36.790
It's got to figure out that this
all means yes there is some kind

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:38.440
of bibliography in this book.

00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:42.990
And no, a computer can't just
look for the existence of a 504.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.680 position:56%
That's not enough because 540s
don't just note down bibliographies,

00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.520
they also note down indexes and
maybe some other information.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:56.220 position:56%
So, straight up, the computer is not
bright enough to figure this out.

00:18:56.220 --> 00:19:00.770
It can't read, much less read
all the languages that we end

00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:03.500
up transcribing stuff in especially
here at the Library of Congress.

00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:06.880
Right? Much less, comprehend
what it's reading.

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:09.800
And, that makes a lot of the stuff

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:17.320
in our mark records a lot less
useful to patrons than it could be.

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:19.850
Computers get yes or no.

00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:22.870 position:56%
Yes or no, on or off, this they get.

00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:24.720
They're real good at that.

00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:27.680
Checkboxes are candy to computers.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.980
Computers love checkboxes.

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:33.680
So, for any conceivable criterion
that we want our patrons to be able

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:37.860
to search on or filter their
results on, we pretty much got

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:41.750
to quit recording it in text and
make it a checkbox or, you know,

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:45.610
radio buttons, if there's more
than two options that also works.

00:19:45.610 --> 00:19:47.320
If you get the sense
from this that I really

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:51.400
like MARC fixed fields,
you're totally right.

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.390 position:56%
Though, honestly, that's your thing.

00:19:53.390 --> 00:19:56.150
That's a little weird.

00:19:56.150 --> 00:20:00.750
If a lot more of MARC had been
expressed in fixed fields instead

00:20:00.750 --> 00:20:05.800
of free text, we'd be in a much,
much better situation right now.

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:14.240
Now, let's say for a moment, let's
pretend that the titanic arguments

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.350
that we in the profession
are going to have to have

00:20:16.350 --> 00:20:19.520
about when a book is said
to have a bibliography

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:24.250
and what actually counts as an
index, let's say we've done that

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.940
and we've drawn the
best line we know how.

00:20:27.940 --> 00:20:30.500
We're still going to have to deal
with this giant horrible mass

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:36.310
of free text that's hanging out in
our 504s in our catalogs right now

00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:40.010
because computers aren't
bright enough to understand it.

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.710
[ Foreign language spoken ]

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.010
It's got to be done.

00:20:43.010 --> 00:20:46.050
And, I don't want to get
down to the weeds on this.

00:20:46.050 --> 00:20:47.880
Actually I'd love to
if we had the time

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:51.030
because this is exactly the
kind of problem I salivate over.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:53.070
I'm a giant nerd though
and not everybody is.

00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:58.190
So, I just want to say this
class of problem can be solved

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:02.660
for the great mass of our
records without hand editing.

00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:04.510
And, of course, it's got to be

00:21:04.510 --> 00:21:07.460
because there ain't enough
staff time in the universe

00:21:07.460 --> 00:21:09.290
to check all those checkboxes.

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:13.580
And, it's a thing that's got to
be done for every characteristic

00:21:13.580 --> 00:21:16.840
in our free text notes
that we want users,

00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:21.770
patrons to be able to
filter or search on.

00:21:21.770 --> 00:21:25.450
Another serious and ugly free text
problem we have in our records has

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:28.090
to do with places where our
content standards don't force us

00:21:28.090 --> 00:21:31.870 position:56%
to be consistent about how we record
information, you know, what as,

00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:33.770
we're cool, just type something.

00:21:33.770 --> 00:21:35.070
It's fine.

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:38.350
And, on catalog cards, this
inconsistency didn't matter.

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.760
Right. Because, the information
was only ever going to be looked

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:46.030
at by a human being who doesn't
need the consistency to figure

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:48.350
out what's going on,
on the individual card.

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:50.170
We're literate humans.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:51.470
We're smart.

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:52.900
We can figure this stuff out.

00:21:52.900 --> 00:21:57.450
Computers are astoundingly
literal minded, right.

00:21:57.450 --> 00:22:00.990
You can take some text, add a
space to it, and all the sudden,

00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:02.740
to the computer, it's
a different thing.

00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:04.900
Just a space, right?

00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.390
A human being wouldn't
even be able to see it.

00:22:07.390 --> 00:22:12.100
But, to the computer, new thing.

00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:15.500
Once again, not just a
MARC thing, consistency

00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:19.190
and Dublin core metadata,
don't make me laugh.

00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:20.940
I actually am more likely to cry.

00:22:20.940 --> 00:22:23.470
It's really that how dare.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.880
And, I once got an
entire published article,

00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.610
cataloging classification
quarterly, you can look it up.

00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:30.930
Out of one poor soul in the
Institutional Repository

00:22:30.930 --> 00:22:33.980
that was running at the
time, the poor guy had stuff

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:39.380
under eight slightly different
spellings of his name, eight.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:40.870
Just terrible.

00:22:40.870 --> 00:22:43.100
And yeah, I fixed it as soon
as I had the screenshot I made

00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.840
through the article, I wasn't
just going to leave it like that.

00:22:45.840 --> 00:22:48.270
But, it goes to show, doesn't it?

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:53.560
And I want to call out two Dublin
core things specifically noting

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:55.590
that you're going to find these
problems a lot more places

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:57.110
than Dublin core.

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:58.990
Dates, oh my gosh.

00:22:58.990 --> 00:23:00.400
Oh my gosh dates.

00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:04.160
Dates are really important
to information seekers.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:10.290
So, it's really important that
we record them consistently

00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:15.830
such that a computer can reasonably
intelligently filter based on them.

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:17.850
And, oh boy, we're not there yet.

00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:19.580
We're not even close to there.

00:23:19.580 --> 00:23:22.920
Dublin core, MARC,
totally doesn't matter.

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:30.010
The people who try to make not too
bright computers work are tearing

00:23:30.010 --> 00:23:32.890
out their hair about
the way we do dates.

00:23:32.890 --> 00:23:34.380
And, we've got to fix this.

00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.570
[ Foreign Language spoken ]

00:23:36.570 --> 00:23:39.820
It's got to be done.

00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:42.980
As for write statements, this
is another one that comes

00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:46.380
from the digital collection
side more than the catalog side.

00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:49.740
It's important because
the people who come

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:53.380
to our digital collections often
want to use them in particular ways

00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:55.180
and they want to know
if they're allowed to.

00:23:55.180 --> 00:24:00.540
We have to be clear about what
our patrons are allowed to do.

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:03.060
And, to do that, our search
engines have to be able to tell

00:24:03.060 --> 00:24:05.520
which users can do
what with which items.

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:10.550
And, that's all free text now
and it's a complete disaster.

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:14.690 position:56%
Europeana and Digital Public Library
of America are working on this,

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:18.040
thankfully, bringing a little bit
of reason, I hope, to this chaos.

00:24:18.040 --> 00:24:21.200
I don't not envy them
that job one big.

00:24:21.200 --> 00:24:27.150
Copyright's bad enough, free
text only makes it worse.

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:33.510
So, an example of the difficulties
with free text that I use

00:24:33.510 --> 00:24:37.750
in class a lot is from Library
software developer Bill Dueber

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:43.210
who took a close look at what was
after the ISBN in the 020 field

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:45.420
in the catalog that
he was working with.

00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:46.800
And wow, it's horrific.

00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:51.050
Just the top 20 responses
over there on the left,

00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.780
you can completely
see the inconsistency.

00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.050
And the more you drill down on the
right he took a look at anything

00:24:57.050 --> 00:24:59.930
that was kind of sort of
hardback and he got all those.

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:03.820
Yeah. The more you drill
down, the worse it gets.

00:25:03.820 --> 00:25:08.220
So yeah. Our catalogs can't answer
the very simple question yo this

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:09.890
book print or electronic or both?

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.600
At least not based on the 020.

00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:15.110
And yeah, I know RDA fixes this

00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:17.970
and yay that's a good
thing to have fixed.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.340
Bottom line though, a lot

00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:24.290
of our catalog data is just
hopelessly internally inconsistent.

00:25:24.290 --> 00:25:29.430
And, sometimes that's material for
patrons and sometimes it isn't.

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.100
I'm not saying that
this is the top thing

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.920
that we've got to fix
in our catalogs.

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.070
I don't actually know what that is.

00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:39.240
That, that knowledge, that
expertise is with you.

00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:44.140
But, when it is material,
right, this is my call

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:50.810
to control all the things, all
of them, anything that's useful,

00:25:50.810 --> 00:25:52.700
material to patrons, in a record

00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.090
that is not actually
transcribed off the item,

vocabulary, or, you know,

00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:01.840
other appropriate standardized
expression.

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.050
You can't do a controlled
vocabulary for date,

00:26:04.050 --> 00:26:05.350
you just have to be really clear

00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:11.220
about how they're written
down, I can't with this.

00:26:11.220 --> 00:26:13.040
what? What even is this?

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.100
And computers is even worse.

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:19.770
What is just type something
is not okay in 2015.

00:26:19.770 --> 00:26:21.210
Transcribe it or control it.

00:26:21.210 --> 00:26:23.070
There is no third option.

[ Foreign language spoken ]

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.760
And, since I've used
to the word transcribe,

00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:33.040
let me just say this thing where
we intentionally transcribe typos,

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:37.310
and other errors in records
and information that's material

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:41.160
to a patron searching a browsing,
can we, can we not please?

00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:46.600
Can we not do that because
computers won't know.

00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.410
Computers will happily operate

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:51.050
on the wrong information
not knowing that it's wrong.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:53.000

propagating mistakes.

Poor guys, as well as our poor
patrons that done the 020 field

for another reason that
has nothing really to do

00:27:07.210 --> 00:27:12.210
with cataloging practices
and more to do with ISBN's.

00:27:12.210 --> 00:27:15.170
Now, I can see my org of
info students with this.

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.470
I can't fool you.

00:27:16.470 --> 00:27:17.860
I want you to know I know this.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:23.760
I can't fool you with this question
is the ISBN a good book identifier?

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.210
And, we all know it's not.

00:27:26.210 --> 00:27:29.110
We know that tons of
books don't have ISBN's.

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:34.310
We know that ISBN's accidentally
and intentionally get reused.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:39.220
We know that it's not totally clear
what a book even is in ISBN land.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:41.830
It's kind of an addition
but not really.

00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:44.550
It's kind of a format
question but not really.

00:27:44.550 --> 00:27:47.630
It's all very, very confusing.

00:27:47.630 --> 00:27:51.230
Perhaps, predictably, it
confuses computers too.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:55.510
Because, computers
are so little minded,

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:59.490
they need to be really super
unambiguous when talking

00:27:59.490 --> 00:28:02.940
about what kind of
thing something is.

00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:05.320
They have to have a really
super clear definition.

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:07.010
This is a book.

00:28:07.010 --> 00:28:08.310
This is a print book.

00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:10.360
This is an eBook, you
know, whatever.

00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:13.650 position:56%
If you and the computer have a
different definition, different idea

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:17.400
in your head about what a book
is, well the computer is going

00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.830
to do wild random unexpected

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:23.080
and unpredictable things
from your point of view.

00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:25.320 position:56%
And, you know, the computer is happy

00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.290
to use whatever definition
we come up with.

00:28:27.290 --> 00:28:29.590
It doesn't care.

00:28:29.590 --> 00:28:32.650
But, in spite of Ferber and
sometimes it must be said

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:37.440
because of it, we don't really
have clear definitions here

00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:41.640
that we can operationalize in
our systems that don't lead us

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:45.440
into logical contradictions
or really bad edge cases.

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:48.870
And, we kind of need that.

00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:50.740
So, that's one thing.

00:28:50.740 --> 00:28:53.350
We got to figure out what
exactly we're talking

00:28:53.350 --> 00:28:56.780
about when we say things like book
and eBook and hardback and so on.

00:28:56.780 --> 00:28:59.680
So, we can explain the distinctions
clearly to the computer.

00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.630
And, if this reminds you of
Susan Briet trying to explain

00:29:03.630 --> 00:29:07.630
when an antelope is a
document, and when it isn't.

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:09.240
I'm right there with you.

00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:12.710
It's totally going to be weird and
sometimes theoretically like that.

00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:17.310 position:56%
And I have to say, this mosaic is
kind of like my personal head cannon

00:29:17.310 --> 00:29:22.700 position:56%
for this is how Susan Briet looks
to me now, you know, whatever works.

00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:30.120 position:56%
And then, once we've figured out the
kinds of things that we're talking

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:34.560
about in our, in our universe,
we have to be able to point.

00:29:34.560 --> 00:29:38.670
And, excuse me for being rude,
but, be able to point clearly

00:29:38.670 --> 00:29:43.270
and unambiguously at every single
example of those things that we,

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.320
collectively, as a
society, I will say,

00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:51.680
that we have because that makes
it easier to pull the information

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:56.160
about these things that
we, collectively, have.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:00.390
The network can work
for us if we let it.

00:30:00.390 --> 00:30:06.190
But, to let the network work, the
network needs a common way to point

00:30:06.190 --> 00:30:09.390
at things and understand
what's being pointed to.

00:30:09.390 --> 00:30:12.440
And, for a computer, that
means an identifier that,

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:16.710
unlike an authority string,
can never ever change.

00:30:16.710 --> 00:30:18.940
Computers get very
confused by change,

00:30:18.940 --> 00:30:21.800
even more confused
than the rest of us.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:24.060
And, for a network computer,

00:30:24.060 --> 00:30:26.410
that means an identifier
that's unique not just

00:30:26.410 --> 00:30:29.010
in your organization, your library.

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:32.500
So, your call number, bar code
number, that's not going to work.

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:34.270
It's got to be unique worldwide.

00:30:34.270 --> 00:30:36.270
So, that means another thing.

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:38.410
It can't be language dependent.

00:30:38.410 --> 00:30:44.230
Because, you know, we've tried
already collating our records

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:47.900
by fuzzy matching and
trying to deduplicate,

00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.270
that's how Metasearch worked.

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:51.570
But, we pretty much, all know

00:30:51.570 --> 00:30:54.410
that Metasearch never
worked all that well.

00:30:54.410 --> 00:31:00.160
Computers are not bright enough
to fuzzy match well all the time.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:05.460
And, catalog data and typical
metadata, they're sparse enough

00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:07.970
that they're not good candidates,
there's not enough there

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:11.040
for a computer to fuzzy
match anyway.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:14.270
We're still going to have to
use this just to get started

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:16.600
because it's what we've got.

00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:17.900
We don't have anything better.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:19.650
But, for some stuff,
for some catalogs,

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:23.330
the identifier thing is
going to be a long haul.

00:31:23.330 --> 00:31:26.740
So, that means we've got to have
unique identifiers for our stuff

00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:29.220
that are way more reliable
than ISBN's.

00:31:29.220 --> 00:31:33.590
And, if you know the link data
world at all, you already know

00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:37.560 position:56%
that the scheme that's been settled
on for these is URI's which 99 times

00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.460
out of 100 look like URL's.

00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:42.540
And, the reasoning there
is we already know how

00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:46.570
to make URL's global unique
because we already do that

00:31:46.570 --> 00:31:48.820
or the web wouldn't work.

00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.990
That's all it is.

00:31:50.990 --> 00:31:54.750
It's just keeping the
computers from getting confused.

00:31:57.370 --> 00:31:59.930
And so, another problem we
have to solve, if we're going

00:31:59.930 --> 00:32:02.830
to take advantage of the
network, is taking identifiers

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:06.480
and quasi identifiers that we've
been using for things like ISBN's

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.840
like authority strings
and matching them

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.940
up with URI's URL's that's been
established for those things,

00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:16.850 position:56%
not going down in the weeds here not
even the seaweeds with the dolphins.

00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:19.310
But, I do want you to
know, if you don't already,

00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:22.770
the nerd word for this
process is reconciliation.

00:32:22.770 --> 00:32:24.070
Nice word.

00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:28.450
And, it can be partially automated
if you know your source data well

00:32:28.450 --> 00:32:32.030
as catalogers tend to do.

00:32:32.030 --> 00:32:34.530
And, the win here is that once
you have a URI for something,

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:36.970
you can go out in the
network and ask a whole bunch

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:38.570
of trustworthy sources,
hey, what do you know

00:32:38.570 --> 00:32:41.950
about this thing and
get back answers.

00:32:41.950 --> 00:32:46.660 position:56%
To me, that's what we now think of
as copy cataloging is going to work.

00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.540
You ask tiny little questions
of very reliable sources,

00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.800
get tiny little answers
back, and you build them

00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.520 position:56%
up into your search engines and
your facets and your browsing tools,

00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:57.660
and all the other user
interface chrome

00:32:57.660 --> 00:32:58.960
that we're already familiar with.

00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:01.770
And, it won't have
to be done by hand.

00:33:01.770 --> 00:33:04.240
If you tell a computer
every time a feed you a URI

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:09.900
for a book we just bought, ask this
question of that source in this way

00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.200
and store the answer there.

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:16.960
And, it will do that reliably and
consistently every single time.

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.890 position:56%
And, I certainly believe this will
be a better solution to what I think

00:33:21.890 --> 00:33:27.620
of capitalized as the
problem of vendor records.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.140
You're familiar with this problem.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:32.010
I don't have to elaborate.

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:35.120
What I'm saying is the problem
of vendor records is nine times

00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:39.110
out of ten a problem of vendors
struggling not only with ACR2

00:33:39.110 --> 00:33:42.480
and MARC which are hard
enough, but with MARC practices

00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.650
that are inconsistent across
libraries to begin with.

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:49.100
It'll be a lot easier for us
and for vendors if, instead,

00:33:49.100 --> 00:33:52.600
our computers are asking
their computers a lot

00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.610
of little tiny questions
with little tiny answers.

00:33:55.610 --> 00:34:00.720
I'll at least say one last
thing about the 020 okay.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.330
ISBN's not unique.

00:34:02.330 --> 00:34:05.320
The field includes
inconsistent format information,

00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.380
yeah, yeah, we got that.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.680
Here's my question.

00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:10.780
What the ever living heck
is format information doing

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:14.380
in an ISBN field to begin with?

00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:17.470
But, much less information about
volumes of much less information

00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:21.000
about volumes and multivolume
series.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:23.230
And, if it does have to
be there, and, I know,

00:34:23.230 --> 00:34:24.950
I actually do know why it's there,

00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:32.720
can't it at least be
in a separate subfield?

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:34.480
What is this business
with the parentheses?

00:34:34.480 --> 00:34:36.690
I'm showing a mosaic
detail here for a reason.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:44.860
You can see all the little
tiny individual rock bits

00:34:44.860 --> 00:34:50.820
and you can see how very carefully
they're placed and that none

00:34:50.820 --> 00:34:52.120
of them overlap anywhere.

00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:56.790
But that's what our catalog data
and metadata need to look like,

00:34:56.790 --> 00:34:59.100
no overlaps, nothing just
jammed together willy-nilly,

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:03.780
everything in little tiny
bits and each tiny bit

00:35:03.780 --> 00:35:08.930
in its own singular place
very carefully set apart

00:35:08.930 --> 00:35:10.230
from the other tiny bits.

00:35:10.230 --> 00:35:13.000
It's called granularity,
sometimes atomicity,

00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:21.710
if you're a relational database
nerd and computers love it.

00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:25.770
See, this is the thing
about computers.

00:35:25.770 --> 00:35:32.040
Computers are really,
really good at building

00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:35.370
up whole mosaics from
little tiny pieces.

00:35:35.370 --> 00:35:36.670
They're good at that.

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:40.270
What they're critically
bad at is taking a whole

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:42.570
and breaking it down into parts.

00:35:42.570 --> 00:35:45.140
We have to do that for them.

00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:48.590
And, as we saw with the
020 field, we often don't.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:50.840
Or, if we do, we do it in ways

00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:55.750
that the computer finds
confusing or inconsistent.

00:35:55.750 --> 00:36:01.190
So, I grabbed a couple of examples
from IFLA's ISBD supplement.

00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:04.450
And, again, if anybody
here from IFLA,

00:36:04.450 --> 00:36:08.250
thank you for this,
classroom lifesaver.

00:36:08.250 --> 00:36:16.270
Just to show the difficulties,
think like a computer for a second.

00:36:16.270 --> 00:36:18.640
There's a whole lot of
punctuation all up in here.

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:23.520
And, it's not at all obvious,
even to me, and I'm a human being,

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:32.080
what all of it means, what's
being set off by it or even

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:33.620
if it means anything at all.

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:37.760
I mean, just the physical
description, the globe there,

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:42.240
tell me what a period
or a dot means there.

00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:46.060
What is space globe space colon
space call dot coma space plastic

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:51.000
space semicolon space 30 cm space
parentheses IM dot parentheses.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:53.970 position:56%
Okay. As a human being, I can figure

00:36:53.970 --> 00:36:59.450
out that the dots there are
calling out abbreviations.

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:01.810
Right because I'm a human
being I'm smart that way.

00:37:01.810 --> 00:37:03.590
Can I just tell the
computer now to assume

00:37:03.590 --> 00:37:07.620
that a dot always mean
an abbreviation?

00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:10.020
Of course I can't.

00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:16.030
Because that's not what it
means in the other fields.

00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:20.500
And, can anybody tell
me why, in the last area

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:24.540
of the globe description everything
except the final sentence has a dot

00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.840
at the end?

00:37:25.840 --> 00:37:29.760
It's enough to make a
programmer cry into her beer.

00:37:29.760 --> 00:37:31.700
Wisconsin, beer's a thing.

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:37.560
I love the area labels
off here for legibility.

00:37:37.560 --> 00:37:44.010
But, I just want to point out, we
actually have two competing sets

00:37:44.010 --> 00:37:46.770
of delimiters happening here.

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:50.900
The areas which are set off
delimited by white space and what's

00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:53.530
in each individual area, which
is funky punctuation city, and,

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:55.220
when you add that to MARC, we get
a whole other set of delimiters

00:37:55.220 --> 00:37:56.520
in the form fields,
subfields, indicators.

00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:57.820
I respect my colleagues
who teach cataloging.

00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.120
Well, I could never do it.

00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.420
I cut my teeth on XML where
delimiters are totally cut and dry.

00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:01.720
The validator will tell
you if you screw them up.

00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:03.020
This mismatch completely
bewildering to me.

00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.320
Bottom example there,
anybody see an error?

00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:05.620
I mean, I think there's an error.

00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:06.920
It's kind of hard to tell.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:08.220
But, that very bottom
line, if that's supposed

00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.520
to be an m dash before the
word canyon, it actually isn't.

00:38:09.520 --> 00:38:10.820
Human being, no big deal, to
a computer, very big deal.

00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.120
Just goes to show we can't even
be sure documentation is right.

00:38:12.120 --> 00:38:13.420
So, anybody who works with XML
now is twitching [inaudible].

00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:14.720
Sorry about that.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:16.020
But, it illustrates an
important point about delimiters.

00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.320
A lot of my students find learning
markup HTML XML really frustrating

00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:18.620 position:56%
because they've never had to be 100%
consistent about delimiters before.

00:38:18.620 --> 00:38:19.920
So, they make tiny little mistakes
like leaving off an angle bracket,

00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:21.220
and they haven't learned to
look for those mistakes yet.

00:38:21.220 --> 00:38:22.520
They don't understand
what the validator,

00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:23.820
which notices the mistakes,
is trying to tell them.

00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.120
It's really frustrating for them.

00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.420
So, what I tell them
is suck it up and deal.

00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:27.720
Okay, no, I'm not actually
that evil about it.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.020
I'm pretty careful to point
out the kinds of errors

00:38:29.020 --> 00:38:30.320
that beginners usually
make and I tell them

00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:31.620
that everyone makes those
errors even really skilled

00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:32.920
and experienced people.

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.220
And, it's okay, the whole point

00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:35.520
of validator is to
help us get it right.

00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:36.820
Well, fundamentally, yeah,
they got to learn to deal.

00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:38.120
And, they don't like
that but too bad.

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:39.420
[ Foreign language spoken ]

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.720
It must be done.

00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:42.020
Don't confuse the computer.

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:45.530
Reliable and consistent delimiter
use is how we avoid confusing

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:46.940
the computer.

00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:52.090
Delimit in just one way, delimit
clearly, delimit unambiguously.

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:53.390
And, you know, I have
to show this thing

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:55.050
that absolutely broke my heart.

00:38:55.050 --> 00:39:00.180
I was digging in the history
of MARC ISBD internationally,

00:39:00.180 --> 00:39:03.300
it was just a rabbit
hole I fell down.

00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:06.410
And, it turns out, a while back,
the Germans were totally bent

00:39:06.410 --> 00:39:08.160
on killing ISBD punctuation

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:12.660
out of the MARC record relying
on MARC delimiters only.

00:39:12.660 --> 00:39:14.900
Which, from the point of view
2015 totally would've been the

00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:16.200
right decision.

00:39:16.200 --> 00:39:19.140
But, how could they know English
speaking MARC went the ISBD

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.440
direction instead.

00:39:20.440 --> 00:39:25.000
And, 20/20 hindsight,
what can you do?

00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.510
So, what is it that
we got to do now?

00:39:28.510 --> 00:39:33.190
[ Foreign language spoken ]

00:39:33.190 --> 00:39:36.350
We got to get a handle
on our free text issues.

00:39:36.350 --> 00:39:40.230
When we're saying the
same thing more than once,

00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:43.010
we need to say it the
same way every time.

00:39:43.010 --> 00:39:52.170 position:56%
We need to atomize our data, make it
as granular as it can possibly be.

00:39:52.170 --> 00:39:54.890
The delimiter thing,
sometimes we have too many

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:57.100
and sometimes we don't have enough.

00:39:57.100 --> 00:40:00.310
And, it would be nice to
find a happy medium there.

00:40:00.310 --> 00:40:05.780
And, when we can identify
something as well as labeling it

00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.310
for our patrons, we should

00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:11.130
because identifiers are
labels for computers.

00:40:11.130 --> 00:40:17.090
Identifiers make network
computers happy and useful.

00:40:17.090 --> 00:40:21.460
And, just to reiterate,
we don't have

00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:24.850
to do these things
because link data.

00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:29.300

No secret.

Cards on the table here.

00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:50.060
If we do do these things, we'll be
a whole lot closer to link data.

00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:51.910 position:56%
So, it's not like I'm ignoring that.

00:40:51.910 --> 00:40:53.210
Not at all.

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:56.480
I'm just saying link data is
not all that this is about.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:00.130
So, that's great.

00:41:00.130 --> 00:41:02.910
Those who are in this room
that are a bit younger,

00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:04.810
you've got jobs for life here.

00:41:04.810 --> 00:41:09.500
I tell my students, this is
your career, this migration,

00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:14.660
this transition is what you'll
be spending your career on.

00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.480
Plenty of work.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:23.610
So, how do we actually
do it exactly?

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:27.160
Good question to have an answer to.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:31.680
By hand, one record at
a time, not the answer.

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:32.980
It can't be.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.520
We've got too many records.

00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:36.510
I mean, yeah, there's still
going to be weird outliers

00:41:36.510 --> 00:41:38.370
that we end up fixing by hand.

00:41:38.370 --> 00:41:40.210
There always are.

00:41:40.210 --> 00:41:41.690
Oh boy I could tell you stories.

00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:43.980
I'm sure you could
tell me stories too.

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:47.550
But, we need to throw computers
at fixing the easier problems

00:41:47.550 --> 00:41:50.740
and limit the hand work
to those weird outliers.

00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:56.480
We've just go too much data
to do it any other way.

00:41:56.480 --> 00:42:00.840
And, because we live with networked
computers, I'm not totally sure

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:02.710
that doing it one organization

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:06.640
at a time is quite the way
either because, in my head,

00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:10.390
and I lived this with institutional
repositories, it kind of means

00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:15.830
that we're all solving the same
problems redundantly in parallel

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:18.400
and we don't need to
do that, necessarily.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.550
It costs too much and it's
going to take too long.

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:31.100
But, the truth is, we collectively
don't yet have the knowhow

00:42:31.100 --> 00:42:35.080 position:56%
that we need to collaborate on this.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:39.200
Most computer programmers
don't have the depth of MARC

00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:44.000
and the ACR2 knowledge that
they need to fix these problems.

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.220
And, most catalogers, I won't say
most, but, many catalogers don't

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.910
yet know how to work with a
great mass of records as opposed

00:42:52.910 --> 00:42:54.970
to editing one record at a time.

00:42:54.970 --> 00:42:58.040
So, this particular problem,
this collaboration problem.

00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.060
[ Foreign language spoken ]

00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:04.240
It is solved by learning.

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.000
Catalogers, developers, we've
all got some learning to do.

00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.680
And I mean, I would say that.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:11.260
Right? I'm a teacher.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:16.480
But, I am a teacher
because I believe this.

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.510
It is solved by learning.

00:43:18.510 --> 00:43:22.950
Managers in the room,
supervisors, please,

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:25.770
give your people time
and space to learn.

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:29.580
Do not make me yell at you
about this because I will.

00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:34.940
Straight up, your cataloging
backlog or that new tech thing

00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:39.160
that your developers are currently
working on is far less important

00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:42.410
than this strategic
preparation for what's coming

00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:44.990
down the pipeline at you.

00:43:44.990 --> 00:43:49.350
By all means, hold your people
accountable for actually learning.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:51.040
I'm in favor of that.

00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:56.580
Some people will say they want to
learn and then complain endlessly

00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.250
about it, I can tell you stories

00:43:58.250 --> 00:44:00.870
and you can probably
tell me stories too.

00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:05.240
Hold them accountable
but let them learn.

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.540
Help them learn.

00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.190
Learn yourself.

00:44:08.190 --> 00:44:09.810
It won't kill you.

00:44:09.810 --> 00:44:12.510
It might make you stronger.

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:19.160
Here's some tools that I think are
well worth adding to your tool kit,

00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:23.570 position:56%
if they're not there already because
they're designed to fix stuff

00:44:23.570 --> 00:44:28.450
in lots of records at once
rather than or possibly

00:44:28.450 --> 00:44:31.720 position:56%
in addition to one record at a time.

00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.680
I've ordered them by the order
in which I would recommend

00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:37.160
that a cataloger learn them.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.210
And, the last half,
you may not even need.

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:42.460
I mentioned these because
there's situation

00:44:42.460 --> 00:44:44.450
where they're genuinely
going to be useful.

00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:46.340
Start with MARC edit,
it's the workhorse.

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:51.470
It's got an increasing number

00:44:51.470 --> 00:44:56.540
of really good batch
record editing tools.

00:44:56.540 --> 00:44:59.730
I don't know that I need
to say anything about that.

00:44:59.730 --> 00:45:01.700
Most of you in this
room probably already,

00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:03.000
at least, have heard of this tool.

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:08.450
Next, who I recommend
is open refine.

00:45:08.450 --> 00:45:13.390
You may see it called
Google Refine as well.

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:18.000
There's a variant on open refine
that's specifically designed

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:20.720
for getting to and from link data.

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:24.240
It's called log refine for
linked open data refine.

00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:25.960
And, you have to install
it anyway, so,

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:31.370 position:56%
you might as well install the one
that's ready for linked data anyway.

00:45:31.370 --> 00:45:35.040
Regular expressions are kind of the
first nerdy thing I ever learned.

00:45:35.040 --> 00:45:38.800
So, I'm kind of over fond of them.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:42.200
Regular expressions are
search and replace tools

00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:48.080
that do pattern matching in very,
very nifty and sophisticated ways.

00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.180
So, if you're interesting in
learning regular expressions,

00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:52.560
I found this wonderful site

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.190
and I actually have my
students using it now.

00:45:54.190 --> 00:45:55.490
It makes me very happy.

00:45:55.490 --> 00:45:59.020
regex1.com series, a very,

00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:03.910
very nicely presented
tutorials getting you used

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:07.490
to regular expressions,
strongly, strongly recommend it.

00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:08.790
So, last three.

00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:12.180 position:56%
If you have to extract data from
relational database or put data back

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:14.070
into a relational data base.

00:46:14.070 --> 00:46:17.440
Structured Query Language,
SQL, is the language

00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:20.530
that you learn to do that with.

00:46:20.530 --> 00:46:22.840
We teach a lot of it
in this semester.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:28.240
It's not, you know, if you
can handle MARC and ACR2,

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:31.000
you can totally handle SQL.

00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:35.780
If you have a lot of XML around,
there is a little language,

00:46:35.780 --> 00:46:41.010 position:56%
if you will, that's designed to take
XML and turn it into other stuff,

00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:42.790
including linked data,
if that's your thing.

00:46:42.790 --> 00:46:44.580
It's called XSLT.

00:46:44.580 --> 00:46:46.970
The learning curve there is steep.

00:46:46.970 --> 00:46:51.590
I recommend looking at other
people's code to get started.

00:46:51.590 --> 00:46:54.590
But, I actually love
XSLT, I'm weird that way.

00:46:54.590 --> 00:46:58.900
Last thing, this is
relatively new and changing

00:46:58.900 --> 00:47:01.460
and I really don't
recommend starting here

00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.640
because here there'll be yaks.

00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:08.390
And, if you've heard the phrase
yak shaving from your developers,

00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:12.260
yak shaving is all the
really annoying work you have

00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:15.960
to do before you can actually do
the work that solves your problem.

00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:19.850
Right? So, installing
Katmandu in fixed,

00:47:19.850 --> 00:47:22.540
there's a lot of yak shaving
there, I will warn you.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:26.780
But, Katmandu in fixed
come out of France.

00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:30.620
Fix is a little language aimed at
batch editing metadata, really,

00:47:30.620 --> 00:47:32.200
really interesting little project.

00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.400
I think it will get easier to use.

00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:39.080
And, therefore, I think it's
worth keeping an eye on even

00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:41.500
if you don't dive into
it right this second.

00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:47.500
So, how should you learn and what
should you do with what you learn?

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:51.420
In my head, those questions
are intimately entwined.

00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:54.480
In some circles, I'm known
for the phrase beating things

00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:57.400
with rocks until they work.

00:47:57.400 --> 00:47:59.690
And, if you use rocks for mosaics,

00:47:59.690 --> 00:48:02.220
this probably won't
work, they're too small.

00:48:02.220 --> 00:48:03.520
But, you get the idea.

00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:07.340
I think plain or mucking
around and breaking things

00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:11.410
and fixing them once you break them
is the best way to learn new tools.

00:48:11.410 --> 00:48:12.710
It's certainly how I do it.

00:48:12.710 --> 00:48:15.550
And, it's certainly how I
kind of dump my students

00:48:15.550 --> 00:48:17.610 position:56%
in the deep end and have them do it.

00:48:17.610 --> 00:48:19.670
Pick something to so with
the tool, then do it.

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:25.710
And, if a few rocks get beaten
on along the way, it's all good.

00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:28.410
What should you pick to
do with the tools exactly?

00:48:28.410 --> 00:48:30.800
Well, try cleaning
up your catalog data.

00:48:30.800 --> 00:48:35.690
Right? Fix your 020's
with MARC edit.

00:48:35.690 --> 00:48:38.020
See if you can at least make
those format notes a little

00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:39.320
more consistent.

00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.720
Export your data to something
open refine can read, it's doable.

00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.720
I know catalogers who have done it.

00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:50.430
See if you can cluster your 504s
such that you can start to try

00:48:50.430 --> 00:48:52.940
and answer the question which
books have bibliographies

00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.470
which books have indexes.

00:48:55.470 --> 00:48:59.540
Try fixing your dates,
have fun with that.

00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:03.170
All kinds of fun and interesting
problems you'll run into with dates

00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:05.160
and have to come up
with a way to solve.

00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.650
But, boy will you learn
the tool that way.

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:12.590
You know your catalogs
a lot better than I do.

00:49:12.590 --> 00:49:14.830
Right? You know where
the worst problems are.

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:17.360
You know the bits of data you had

00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:19.660
that you wish the computers
understood

00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:23.080
so that they could answer
patron questions better.

00:49:23.080 --> 00:49:26.070
so, you know where the most
important problems to fix are.

00:49:26.070 --> 00:49:29.040
And, that's crucial knowledge.

00:49:29.040 --> 00:49:31.890
So, learn the tools
by fixing the problems

00:49:31.890 --> 00:49:35.080
that you already know are there.

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:39.010

you dive into that right away.

&gt;&gt; Frank Newton: I'm Frank Newton.

00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:28.720
I am.

00:51:28.720 --> 00:51:30.180
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Hi Frank.

00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.730
&gt;&gt; Frank Newton: I am, I wanted

00:51:31.730 --> 00:51:35.750
to ask you whether
computers contain hypotheses?

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:39.360
And, the reason I'm asking
is because it seems to me

00:51:39.360 --> 00:51:43.030
that that's what human
beings do with punctuation.

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:44.330
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Yes.

00:51:44.330 --> 00:51:45.630
&gt;&gt; Frank Newton: I'm a
huge fan of punctuation.

00:51:45.630 --> 00:51:51.860
And, I think the reason that MARC
records have a lot of punctuation

00:51:51.860 --> 00:51:58.120
in them is because
citation standards like MLA

00:51:58.120 --> 00:52:01.390
and APA have a lot of
punctuation in them.

00:52:01.390 --> 00:52:06.370
And, I think that catalog
cards began

00:52:06.370 --> 00:52:10.150
as an elaboration of
a citation format.

00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:11.450
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: I agree.

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:16.120
&gt;&gt; Frank Newton: And, I don't
mean to say that people,

00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:19.620
while people were developing card
catalogs and what information

00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:20.920
and how they would format it

00:52:20.920 --> 00:52:24.040
on card catalogs they were
constantly saying we want

00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:26.380
to make this like citation format.

00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.570
I just think that that
was constantly in the back

00:52:28.570 --> 00:52:34.850
of their minds and not necessarily,
not necessarily articulated a lot.

00:52:34.850 --> 00:52:43.600
So, lots of punctuation, but, by
and large, mostly, it seems to me,

00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:46.460
periods do not have an
infinite number of meanings.

00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:52.130
They have certain meanings
that have high probabilities.

00:52:52.130 --> 00:52:54.920
And, one of them is the one you
mentioned about abbreviations.

00:52:54.920 --> 00:52:59.630
So, suppose you have a globe and
you have metadata for a globe

00:52:59.630 --> 00:53:03.930
and in parentheses
you have DIAM., then,

00:53:03.930 --> 00:53:08.170 position:56%
what I would like to the computer
to do is to entertain the hypothesis

00:53:08.170 --> 00:53:12.790
that that period is there because
there's a longer word that begins

00:53:12.790 --> 00:53:16.160
with DIAM that has
to do with globes.

00:53:16.160 --> 00:53:20.160
And, that's the way I believe
a human being would operate.

00:53:20.160 --> 00:53:21.460
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Yep.

00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:25.190
&gt;&gt; Frank Newton: And, and we
go to our mental dictionaries

00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:27.040
and we find the word diameter.

00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:29.560
And, I don't know how
exactly we do that.

00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:34.580
But, I don't completely feel
that that's beyond the realm

00:53:34.580 --> 00:53:41.910 position:56%
of programing to figure out how we
connect DIAM with the word diameter.

00:53:41.910 --> 00:53:46.800 position:56%
So, and, that's another, in addition
to saying that I like punctuation,

00:53:46.800 --> 00:53:50.600
I also wanted to say that
I think sometimes we assume

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.580
that things are un-programmable
when, in fact, they're perfectly,

00:53:54.580 --> 00:54:00.700
they're really not
that hard to program.

00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:04.630
And, I would, I wish, I'm
not a programmer at all.

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:07.950
But, I wish that somebody
would program computers

00:54:07.950 --> 00:54:12.370
to use the singular and plural
form of nouns accurately.

00:54:12.370 --> 00:54:18.300 position:56%
So, I don't it when a computer says
to me one books because I know that,

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:20.620
after one, there's, you're supposed

00:54:20.620 --> 00:54:23.730
to leave off the S
at the end of books.

00:54:23.730 --> 00:54:28.100
And, I don't see why computers
couldn't be programmed

00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:30.690
to understand that too.

00:54:30.690 --> 00:54:31.990
And.

00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:34.080
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: The
question is, how much money

00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:38.440
and programmer time are you going
to spend asking a computer to act

00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:43.580
like a human being when
computers can't really do that?

00:54:43.580 --> 00:54:49.100
And, we have thrown an awful lot
of money, an awful lot of time

00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:53.350
and a lot of vendors and a
lot of developers asking them

00:54:53.350 --> 00:54:57.890 position:56%
to do this impossible thing because,
no, computers don't get hypotheses.

00:54:57.890 --> 00:54:59.610
It's yes or no.

00:54:59.610 --> 00:55:01.480
Right. That's what they get.

00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:03.120
And so, what you end up doing,

00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:06.440
and the singular plural problem
is relatively easy to solve.

00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:07.740
That's an easy one.

00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:09.320
Anybody know about Inera?

00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.950
I can't remember where
they're based now.

00:55:11.950 --> 00:55:18.520
They're a service software
company for publishers.

00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:24.020
And, the reason they exist and
the reason they make their money,

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:26.960
and they're a very
profitable corporation,

00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:31.970
is that they have written
immense amounts

00:55:31.970 --> 00:55:36.460
of computer code just
to parse citations.

00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:42.570
Right? That's a multimillion
dollar industry

00:55:42.570 --> 00:55:47.060
because computers are so bad at it.

00:55:47.060 --> 00:55:49.700
Right. So yeah, we can
solve these problems.

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.060
Don't we have better
problems to solve?

00:55:52.060 --> 00:55:55.980
I guess is where I'm at on that.

00:55:56.990 --> 00:55:58.290
More questions?

00:55:58.290 --> 00:56:03.470
&gt;&gt; Christine Delany: My
name is Christine Delany

00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:05.480
from American University Library.

00:56:05.480 --> 00:56:06.780
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Hi Christine.

00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.080
&gt;&gt; Christine Delany: Hi.

00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.380
And, my question has to
do with authority work.

00:56:09.380 --> 00:56:10.680
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Yeah.

00:56:10.680 --> 00:56:13.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Christine Delany: I've heard
some received some mixed information

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:16.510
about whether or not, in
the linked data world,

00:56:16.510 --> 00:56:20.500
authority work will be
necessary to perform.

00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.790
We won't need authority
records etcetera.

00:56:22.790 --> 00:56:26.980
Can you say a few words about
your thoughts about authority,

00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:30.000
authority work and authority
records in a linked data world?

00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.260 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: I think there's
going to be gigantically more of it.

00:56:33.260 --> 00:56:35.310
When I say control all the things,

00:56:35.310 --> 00:56:38.520
that to me means we have
authorities and more of them.

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:42.520
We have more controlled
vocabularies.

00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:46.030
So, authority worked in the
linked data world is going

00:56:46.030 --> 00:56:51.700 position:56%
to be focused a little less on
figuring out the labels and more on,

00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:56.070 position:56%
okay, we've slapped an identifier
on this person who just wrote a book

00:56:56.070 --> 00:57:00.050
for the first time or on this
place that just became a place.

00:57:00.050 --> 00:57:05.580
And the authority, the authority
work becomes what else do we know

00:57:05.580 --> 00:57:09.480
that we can attach
to this identifier?

00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:11.160
We know the name for the place.

00:57:11.160 --> 00:57:13.030 position:56%
We know the time it was established.

00:57:13.030 --> 00:57:17.110
We know where else it is in
the universe, things like that.

00:57:17.110 --> 00:57:19.740
So, authority work will
change a little bit,

00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:21.510
the emphasis is going to change.

00:57:21.510 --> 00:57:25.320
But, yeah, we still got to do it.

00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:30.170
The fun thing is, though, that we
don't have to do it individually

00:57:30.170 --> 00:57:33.970
and in parallel because that's
what the network buys us.

00:57:33.970 --> 00:57:37.340
As soon as one person
knows something interesting

00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:41.440
about a person represented by
a URL, they tell the world.

00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:44.790
And now, nobody else has to
gather that piece of information

00:57:44.790 --> 00:57:48.320
because it's out there
and we can ask for it.

00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:49.910
So yes, definitely
still authority work

00:57:49.910 --> 00:57:54.070
but it will be networked
authority work.

00:57:54.070 --> 00:58:00.190
&gt;&gt; So, I had a question about
back editing subject headings.

00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:01.490
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Yeah.

00:58:01.490 --> 00:58:02.790
&gt;&gt; Because.

00:58:02.790 --> 00:58:04.090
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Scary
stuff sometimes.

00:58:04.090 --> 00:58:05.900
&gt;&gt; Because a lot, I
mean, you were talking

00:58:05.900 --> 00:58:08.760 position:56%
about how other data's inconsistent.

00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.380
But, as a cataloger,
I've actually found

00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:17.190
that subject headings are the
most inconsistent because there's

00:58:17.190 --> 00:58:24.490
so many terms that can be used
for like one piece of information.

00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:27.870
And, there's only so many
that can be put in a record

00:58:27.870 --> 00:58:30.290
without overwhelming a record.

00:58:30.290 --> 00:58:31.590
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Right.

00:58:31.590 --> 00:58:37.660
&gt;&gt; So, I was wondering if, if
there's a bunch of similar records,

00:58:37.660 --> 00:58:41.480
if an institution can sort
of like batch edit those?

00:58:41.480 --> 00:58:44.090
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: I hope so
because we're going to have to do

00:58:44.090 --> 00:58:46.790
that a lot, well, not a lot.

00:58:46.790 --> 00:58:48.410
I don't actually know how much.

00:58:48.410 --> 00:58:50.000
Let me be clear about this.

00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.710
A lot of this problem arises

00:58:51.710 --> 00:58:55.080
because subject terminology
does change over time.

00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:58.010
And, sometimes we have time
to fix it in our records

00:58:58.010 --> 00:59:00.700
and sometimes we kind of don't.

00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:04.510
So, that's just, you know,
acute time poverty is one reason

00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:07.390
that subject headings
get into such a state.

00:59:07.390 --> 00:59:12.410
So, there's some interesting
things that can happen

00:59:12.410 --> 00:59:16.290
with subject headings
in a linked data world.

00:59:16.290 --> 00:59:19.270
And, let me see how
I want to frame this.

00:59:19.270 --> 00:59:27.000
One of them is that, I think,
we, I think there are better ways

00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.880
to handle pre-coordination and
presenting pre-coordination

00:59:30.880 --> 00:59:33.920
to patrons than we currently have.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:38.660
So, I think that, actually, once we
do the work, will be a big benefit.

00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:46.270
Some of it is actually using a
subject heading to follow our nose

00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:49.390
and not just through
library collections

00:59:49.390 --> 00:59:54.660
but through digital catalog, or
digital collection through archives

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:57.010
that don't even necessarily need

00:59:57.010 --> 00:59:59.370
to be using the same
subject vocabularies

00:59:59.370 --> 01:00:00.750
that we use in libraries.

01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:06.380
That's okay because
vocabulary developers, right,

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:12.470
controllers if you will, are
working very hard behind the scenes

01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:16.760
to draw equivalences
across vocabularies.

01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:21.060
And, in the linked data world, that
can actually become very seamless.

01:00:21.060 --> 01:00:26.730 position:56%
So, the most interesting linked data
projects to me and the ones that I

01:00:26.730 --> 01:00:32.880
like to show to our students are
the ones that do the best work,

01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:37.340
not just updating subject headings
not just making them internally

01:00:37.340 --> 01:00:43.030
consistent, that's going to
be a Sisyphean effort, but,

01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:48.710
leading people to the richness
of all of the stuff that we have,

01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:56.320
collectively, as a society, all the
information that we have on topics

01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.270
of interest, people of
interest, things like that.

01:01:00.270 --> 01:01:02.240
That's a very rambling answer.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.840
And, I don't know if I
answered the question.

01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.310
But I try.

01:01:06.310 --> 01:01:07.720
&gt;&gt; Mark Winek: Two more over here.

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.120
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Okay.

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:12.780
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] currently
at George Mason University.

01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:14.080
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Hi.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.380
&gt;&gt; Cataloging librarian.

01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:20.630
I think that administrators need to
hear what you said today much more

01:01:20.630 --> 01:01:24.210
than we do because they're the ones
who basically tell us what to do.

01:01:24.210 --> 01:01:25.870
And, when they're counting
how much work we do,

01:01:25.870 --> 01:01:28.480
they don't say how many
errors did you fix today,

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:31.660
they want to know how many missed
errors have been processed.

01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:32.960
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Hear, hear.

01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.950
&gt;&gt; And, in some cases, I've read

01:01:34.950 --> 01:01:38.840
that people have been specifically
forbidden to make correction

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:41.010
that they see needed work and.

01:01:41.010 --> 01:01:42.310
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: I
have heard this too.

01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:46.720
It makes me so sad and so angry
because it's just making the work

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:49.380
down the line even
worse even harder.

01:01:49.380 --> 01:01:52.670
&gt;&gt; Yes. Even in the members
of the OCLC Cooperative

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:57.060
where the demographic records are
not your records but our records.

01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.960
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Oh
don't get me started.

01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.090
I actually called out OCLC
on that one in person once.

01:02:03.090 --> 01:02:04.390
&gt;&gt; Thank you for doing that.

01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:05.840
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: It was an
interesting conversation.

01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:08.620
&gt;&gt; And, you may be familiar with
the type of the day project.

01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:09.920
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Yeah.

01:02:09.920 --> 01:02:13.640
&gt;&gt; Which began ten years ago based
on [inaudible] database of records.

01:02:13.640 --> 01:02:19.680
That project is sort of [inaudible]
to a stop but needs to be revised,

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:23.570
perhaps not fixing individual
words but fixing entire strings.

01:02:23.570 --> 01:02:25.580
That could be done
mechanically it's real dangerous.

01:02:25.580 --> 01:02:26.880
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Some of it yeah.

01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:30.190
&gt;&gt; To go in and try and fix
mechanically individual mistakes.

01:02:30.190 --> 01:02:32.310
But, if you have a.

01:02:32.310 --> 01:02:33.980
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: If you
have a good testing tool,

01:02:33.980 --> 01:02:35.280
if you can see what's going

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.810
to happen before it happens,
that's a great thing.

01:02:37.810 --> 01:02:39.550
&gt;&gt; And having fixed numerous cases

01:02:39.550 --> 01:02:43.170
of misspelled university
then gone back years later.

01:02:43.170 --> 01:02:44.470
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Yep.

01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:45.770
&gt;&gt; And found that 30
of them have crept

01:02:45.770 --> 01:02:48.120
in because vendor records
contain them.

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:50.940
Vendors are the ones who
need to be tending to this.

01:02:50.940 --> 01:02:52.240
They're.

01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.540
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Hear, hear.

01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:54.840
&gt;&gt; On a cache basis.

01:02:54.840 --> 01:02:56.140
They have no motivation
to do anything other

01:02:56.140 --> 01:02:57.480
than promulgate their wares.

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.880
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: The
least possible yeah.

01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:03.380
&gt;&gt; So, these are comments
that I have made.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:05.930
And, I think a lot of
people who were involved

01:03:05.930 --> 01:03:08.220
in various project have retired.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:11.220
New people coming in need
to be trained in the fact

01:03:11.220 --> 01:03:14.950 position:56%
that these are the kind of
activities we need to be engaged in.

01:03:14.950 --> 01:03:16.250
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Hear, hear.

01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:21.120
And, I'm doing my best at the
library school where I'm yes.

01:03:22.550 --> 01:03:24.900
But yes, 100% behind you.

01:03:24.900 --> 01:03:26.410
&gt;&gt; Virginia Wayen: Hi.

01:03:26.410 --> 01:03:27.710
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Hi.

01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:29.430
&gt;&gt; Virginia Wayen:
I'm Virginia Wayen

01:03:29.430 --> 01:03:30.970
from Frostburg State University.

01:03:30.970 --> 01:03:32.270
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Hi Virginia.

01:03:32.270 --> 01:03:33.570
&gt;&gt; Virginia Wayen: Hi.

01:03:33.570 --> 01:03:36.850
I like to think that when we're
making [inaudible] like this,

01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:40.250
that we think, for example,
not going where Google is

01:03:40.250 --> 01:03:41.670
but where Google's going.

01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:46.190
Are you aware of any of the things
that are just on the horizon now

01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:50.170
that we need to be aware of
when we do these changes?

01:03:50.170 --> 01:03:51.470
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Yeah.

01:03:51.470 --> 01:03:56.550
One, that's a great question by the
way and thank you for asking it.

01:03:56.550 --> 01:04:01.260
The next time you redesign
your website, right,

01:04:01.260 --> 01:04:03.580
when you're redoing
all of your templates,

01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:06.920
the next time you redesign
your digital collection

01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:11.730
or even the next time
you scheme your catalogs,

01:04:11.730 --> 01:04:15.750
look at something called
schema.org microdata.

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:21.590
And, you can learn about this at
schema.org, perhaps unsurprisingly.

01:04:21.590 --> 01:04:24.920
So, the bit of history that
I didn't get into here is

01:04:24.920 --> 01:04:29.040
that the webs first fling
with what is now linked data,

01:04:29.040 --> 01:04:31.990
the semantic web, was
a complete flop.

01:04:31.990 --> 01:04:33.940
Right. It didn't happen.

01:04:33.940 --> 01:04:37.800
And, it didn't happen
because RDF is a beast.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:42.460
Right. It's really hard to
learn past a certain relatively

01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:43.760
simple point.

01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:45.670
It's hard to implement.

01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:48.510
And, web developers took
one look and ran screaming

01:04:48.510 --> 01:04:51.490
in the opposite direction.

01:04:51.490 --> 01:04:54.030
I can't blame them.

01:04:54.030 --> 01:04:55.330
I don't like RDF either.

01:04:55.330 --> 01:05:00.470 position:56%
So, this time around the major
search engines, Google, Bing, Yahoo,

01:05:00.470 --> 01:05:04.580
a couple others, I don't think
DuckDuckGo is involved though,

01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:05.880
I think they should be.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:10.850
If anybody here is in this room,
DuckDuckGo, please do that.

01:05:10.850 --> 01:05:13.580
So, they got together and said
okay we need to break this

01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:15.770
down and make it simpler.

01:05:15.770 --> 01:05:18.460
And so, they came up with
a thing called microdata

01:05:18.460 --> 01:05:21.410
that you can implement
directly in HTML

01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:25.590
and it's got some very specific
vocabularies that you can use

01:05:25.590 --> 01:05:28.820
to describe things like libraries.

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:34.780
The holy trinity of library
information, right, address, hours,

01:05:34.780 --> 01:05:38.070
events, you can put
that in microdata

01:05:38.070 --> 01:05:39.720
and then the search
engine can pick it up

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:42.720
and show it directly
in the search result.

01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:45.940
If you do a Google search
on almost any current movie,

01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:50.360 position:56%
you will see much richer information
that you used to because IMDB,

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:54.170
the Internet Movie Data Base
has implemented microdata very

01:05:54.170 --> 01:05:56.880
effectively and Google
picks up on that.

01:05:56.880 --> 01:05:59.860
In the Code4Lib Journal, a couple
of other places there are examples

01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.770
of libraries improving
their search results

01:06:02.770 --> 01:06:04.700
and actually moving
their search results

01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:08.770
up on search results pages
because of microdata.

01:06:08.770 --> 01:06:12.550
So, the one thing, if you had to
pin me down to one thing that's

01:06:12.550 --> 01:06:14.680
on the horizon that I
think is worth looking at,

01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:17.610
I would say microdata check it out.

01:06:17.610 --> 01:06:20.230
Next time you're doing a redesign,
see what you can implement.

01:06:20.230 --> 01:06:24.210
&gt;&gt; Mark Winek: I think we have time

01:06:24.210 --> 01:06:29.200
for just one more quick
question right here.

01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:30.500
&gt;&gt; Kari Brady: Hi.

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.800
I'm Kari Brady.

01:06:31.800 --> 01:06:33.650
I'm from Maryland's Department
of Legislative Services.

01:06:33.650 --> 01:06:34.950
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Hi Kari.

01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:37.980
&gt;&gt; Kari Brady: And,
I have a question

01:06:37.980 --> 01:06:41.850 position:56%
about making more consistent records

01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:48.850
that describe items
that are inconsistent.

01:06:48.850 --> 01:06:51.950
We, most of our cataloging.

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:53.250
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Wonderful
[inaudible].

01:06:53.250 --> 01:06:54.550
&gt;&gt; Kari Brady: Yeah.

01:06:54.550 --> 01:06:55.850
Most of our cataloging is
government agency reports

01:06:55.850 --> 01:06:57.590 position:56%
and task force reports and all that.

01:06:57.590 --> 01:06:58.890
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Yeah.

01:06:58.890 --> 01:07:00.190
&gt;&gt; Kari Brady: Fun stuff.

01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:02.290
And, many of them are
annual or, you know,

01:07:02.290 --> 01:07:04.720
at least serialized in some way.

01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:07.330
And unfortunate.

01:07:07.330 --> 01:07:08.860
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Are you serious?

01:07:08.860 --> 01:07:10.160
&gt;&gt; Kari Brady: Yeah.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:13.610
Unfortunately, because they're not,
you know, published by a publisher

01:07:13.610 --> 01:07:16.810
who wants to be, you know,
wants to be found again,

01:07:16.810 --> 01:07:22.390
so has some steak in
being consistent.

01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:23.690
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Yeah.

01:07:23.690 --> 01:07:26.570
&gt;&gt; Kari Brady: They are quite often
they change titles very frequently,

01:07:26.570 --> 01:07:30.550
which isn't as big a deal because
you've got all those 246's.

01:07:30.550 --> 01:07:31.850
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Right.

01:07:31.850 --> 01:07:36.460
&gt;&gt; Kari Brady: But, they
change formats frequently.

01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:39.210
They change even the laws

01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:42.750
that require the reports
change frequently.

01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:45.850
And, sometimes, those get
to be a real mess as far

01:07:45.850 --> 01:07:48.050
as tracking those in the record.

01:07:48.050 --> 01:07:49.650
But then, the biggest problem comes

01:07:49.650 --> 01:07:54.750
in when they've done
something strange about, well,

01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:58.740
they skipped a year here but they
made it up in this other one.

01:07:58.740 --> 01:08:01.400 position:56%
And so, the dates are all messed up.

01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:04.260 position:56%
And the patrons are going to be
looking for them but they don't know

01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:09.520
that they actually split this
report up into this report

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.030
and also this other report
that's shelved over here.

01:08:12.030 --> 01:08:13.980
And so, with some of these records,

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:17.860
we end up with a zillion
five hundred notes.

01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:19.260
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Right.

01:08:19.260 --> 01:08:20.560
Because.

01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.860
&gt;&gt; Kari Brady: And of
course they're free text.

01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.170
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Those marks
doesn't give you any other way

01:08:23.170 --> 01:08:24.470
to represent that.

01:08:24.470 --> 01:08:25.770
&gt;&gt; Kari Brady: Exactly.

01:08:25.770 --> 01:08:27.070
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Right?

01:08:27.070 --> 01:08:28.370
&gt;&gt; Kari Brady: And sometimes
it's so complicated that it has

01:08:28.370 --> 01:08:29.670
to be free text because
there's really no.

01:08:29.670 --> 01:08:30.970
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: How
in the world else.

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:32.270
&gt;&gt; Kari Brady: Standardized.

01:08:32.270 --> 01:08:33.570
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Would you
tell even a human being what

01:08:33.570 --> 01:08:34.870
in the world is going on here?

01:08:34.870 --> 01:08:36.170
Yeah.

01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:37.470
&gt;&gt; Keri Brady: Yeah.

01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:38.770
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: So,
explaining things

01:08:38.770 --> 01:08:40.070
to human beings we shall
always have with us.

01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:41.370
Here's what I'll say about that.

01:08:41.370 --> 01:08:44.930
Linked data, because it is
intrinsically granular, right,

01:08:44.930 --> 01:08:47.860
you've probably all heard the idea
that we're exploding the record

01:08:47.860 --> 01:08:49.910
and we're making statements.

01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:54.200
Part of the reason we're doing that
is that the record is kind of a,

01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:58.600
since I'm on my Greek Latin
kick today, procrustean bed.

01:08:58.600 --> 01:09:01.950
We lop off anything
that we have to lop off

01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:04.540
to make whatever we're
describing fit the record.

01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:09.110
I think linked data will
let us stop doing that.

01:09:09.110 --> 01:09:13.480 position:56%
And, I think, particularly, for when
you have these strange edge cases

01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:17.110
and for formats that MARC has
never dealt real well with,

01:09:17.110 --> 01:09:19.490
there's a great Code4Lib
Journal article

01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:22.080
from a computer programmer
trying to get to grips

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:25.150
with how MARC handles music scores.

01:09:25.150 --> 01:09:29.190
Right? Exactly.

01:09:29.190 --> 01:09:34.600
I think we will expand into a
world that's much kinder to things

01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:38.780
that don't quite fit
the catalog card model

01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:41.150
that was designed for books.

01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:44.130
That's my hope anyway,
that's my hope.

01:09:44.130 --> 01:09:45.430
&gt;&gt; Kari Brady: Thanks.

01:09:45.430 --> 01:09:46.730
&gt;&gt; Dorothea Salo: Sure.

01:09:46.730 --> 01:09:48.030
Well thank you all.

01:09:48.030 --> 01:09:49.330
This has been a lot of fun.

01:09:49.330 --> 01:09:51.630
&gt;&gt; Mark Wiken: Thank you.

01:09:52.810 --> 01:09:55.280
&gt;&gt; So we're, I think our
presentation today is going

01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.230
to compliment Dorothea's
actually nicely.

01:09:58.230 --> 01:10:07.630
We are going to try to help
you prepare to be linked.

01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:12.050
I'm going to give kind
of a high level talk

01:10:12.050 --> 01:10:15.950
and then Jackie will get more down
in the dirt and give the real meat

01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:18.250
of some things you can do.

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:24.140
&gt;&gt; Nancy Fallgren: Okay.

01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:26.780
So, how many of you have been
to linked data talks before?

01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:28.680
How familiar is this slide?

01:10:28.680 --> 01:10:31.130
I hate Legos.

01:10:31.130 --> 01:10:32.910 position:56%
I'm getting this out of the way now.

01:10:32.910 --> 01:10:34.800
This is the obligatory Legos side.

01:10:34.800 --> 01:10:37.740
We're done, it's over.

01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:39.360
No more. Okay?

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:44.840
I was just talking to
someone about stepping on them

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:47.020
and how painful that can be.

01:10:47.020 --> 01:10:50.560
There are many reasons
not to like Legos.

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:53.900
So, back when I was a library
school student, at the University

01:10:53.900 --> 01:10:59.440
of Maryland, Dale Flecker from
Harvard came to speak to us

01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:03.530
about the future of
libraries and technology.

01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:07.600
And, the presentation that he gave
was full of such doom and gloom

01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:12.270 position:56%
that I walked away thinking why am
I even bothering to get this degree.

01:11:12.270 --> 01:11:16.500
And, basically what he, he
painted this really dire picture

01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:20.900
of the inabilities, the inability
of libraries to ever catch

01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:23.580
up with technology
because we are so bogged

01:11:23.580 --> 01:11:28.880
down by our processes we're not
agile enough to make any progress.

01:11:30.020 --> 01:11:33.470
So, what I'd like to
say to you is, yes,

01:11:33.470 --> 01:11:38.070
I'm on the linked data bandwagon
because linked data gives me hope.

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:42.770
It gives me hope that
we can significantly

01:11:42.770 --> 01:11:49.250
or at least a lot decrease
that technology gap.

01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:52.010
I think we're at a crossroads.

01:11:52.010 --> 01:11:56.730
I think behind us is the
comfort of what we know,

01:11:56.730 --> 01:12:00.510
a technology that we've
been using for 65 years

01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:03.390
that we feel warm and fuzzy about.

01:12:03.390 --> 01:12:07.710
And, on the other side, is
an opportunity to progress

01:12:07.710 --> 01:12:13.590
to a more kind technology, along
with all the anxiety and discomfort

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:16.850
that comes with change
and unfamiliar territory.

01:12:16.850 --> 01:12:24.450 position:56%
But, if we can embrace this change
now and adopt agile practices, then,

01:12:24.450 --> 01:12:27.920
perhaps, we can actually
gain ground on technology.

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:33.410
And maybe, moving forward, we can
catch up and maybe even keep up.

01:12:33.410 --> 01:12:36.760
So, MARC is behind me at
the crossroad or behind us

01:12:36.760 --> 01:12:41.900
at the crossroad at our backs and
linked data is in front of us.

01:12:41.900 --> 01:12:46.150
At a high level, a change to linked
data is a change from operating

01:12:46.150 --> 01:12:49.020
in silo databases to working

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:52.090
with technology that's
aligned with the semantic web.

01:12:52.090 --> 01:12:56.110
It'll force us to be more aware
of how the resources we're working

01:12:56.110 --> 01:12:59.960
with are related and how
our data works on the web.

01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:06.640
All right.

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:07.940
So, I mention semantic web.

01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:11.490
I really hope, my,
one of my dreams is

01:13:11.490 --> 01:13:14.670
that I will never have
to explain this again.

01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:21.140 position:56%
I really hope that this slide can
be thrown away within the next year.

01:13:21.140 --> 01:13:23.340
So, what is the semantic web?

01:13:23.340 --> 01:13:26.530
The semantic web is
simply a web of data.

01:13:26.530 --> 01:13:28.960
It's a more granular web
than the one we're used to.

01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.270
The web we're used to links
documents to documents.

01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:33.230 position:56%
The semantic web links data to data.

01:13:33.230 --> 01:13:37.310
the language of the semantic web
is resource description framework

01:13:37.310 --> 01:13:38.610
or RDF.

01:13:38.610 --> 01:13:40.280
And, RDF is expressed in triples.

01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:45.290
Triples look like simple sentence,
subject, predicate, object.

01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:48.590
The idea behind triples is
that they should be expressed,

01:13:48.590 --> 01:13:52.650 position:56%
or that the data, the pieces of the
triples, the subject, the predicate,

01:13:52.650 --> 01:13:55.540
and the object are
preferably expressed as IRI's.

01:13:55.540 --> 01:13:59.010
And this is a different acronym
than the one that Dorothea used.

01:13:59.010 --> 01:14:00.880
She talked about URI's.

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:06.570
Jackie and I are going
to say IRI instead.

01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:08.580
So, what is an IRI?

01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:12.170
An IRI is an internationalized
resource identifier.

01:14:12.170 --> 01:14:15.690
It's URI that's basically
internationalized.

01:14:15.690 --> 01:14:18.100
So, what does that mean?

01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:22.080
URI uses a limited character set.

01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:25.010
IRI uses a universal character set

01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:29.470
to allow expression
in non-Latin scripts.

01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:34.830
So, the idea is that IRI's can
then be round tripped back to URI's

01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:37.870
and then to other languages.

01:14:37.870 --> 01:14:39.930
So, it's an internationalization
of URI.

01:14:39.930 --> 01:14:45.330
So, if I am Chinese, I
can see URI in Chinese

01:14:45.330 --> 01:14:51.650
and understand what it's saying,
you can see it in my own language.

01:14:51.650 --> 01:14:54.050
We may go back and forth a little
bit, Jackie and I, between IRI

01:14:54.050 --> 01:14:57.300 position:56%
and URI, but I think, mostly,
mostly you'll be hearing us say IRI.

01:14:57.300 --> 01:14:59.080
So, we just wanted to
make that explanation.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.750
And, Jackie will be going into this
in detail when she talks to it.

01:15:03.750 --> 01:15:08.950 position:56%
One of the really important things
to keep in mind, when you're talking

01:15:08.950 --> 01:15:13.740
about linked data and the semantic
web and you're talking about RDF,

01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:16.220
and this is the concept
that I think, sometimes,

01:15:16.220 --> 01:15:19.600
people or catalogers may
have difficulty grasping

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:22.550
because we think in
terms of records.

01:15:22.550 --> 01:15:24.890
No more records.

01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:29.260
We're talking, in RDF,
about pieces of data.

01:15:29.260 --> 01:15:34.630
So, you don't have a record to
give each piece of data context.

01:15:34.630 --> 01:15:39.440 position:56%
Each triple has to be understandable
on its own out in the world.

01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:44.360
It has to be able to sit out
in the world and make sense.

01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:45.880
No record to give it context.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:50.690
The context of the object of
the triple is its subject.

01:15:50.690 --> 01:15:53.800
Okay? Important concept,
really important concept

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:55.240
to digest and understand.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:16:03.120 position:56%
So, first let's start by, we'll talk

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:09.750
about how we can prepare
ourselves for linked data.

01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:12.560
And, I am right up there
with Dorothea learn,

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:14.640
learn, learn, learn, learn.

01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:16.880
So, one of the things
that we can do in advance

01:16:16.880 --> 01:16:19.360
of this becoming a
standard for us to use,

01:16:19.360 --> 01:16:20.660
because, it's not a standard.

01:16:20.660 --> 01:16:23.060
It's not an adopted standard
for us to be using right now.

01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:25.150
Right? We're preparing.

01:16:25.150 --> 01:16:29.420
We're preparing so that, when
we cross that road, it's not,

01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:34.860
it's not so anxiety filled, we
can mitigate some of the anxiety

01:16:34.860 --> 01:16:37.650
that comes with change
with learning.

01:16:37.650 --> 01:16:41.870
And, when I'm talking about
learning, I'm saying explore,

01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:45.980
buy a book, do it on your own.

01:16:45.980 --> 01:16:48.400
Look through the web,
there are places at W3C

01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.260
where you can learn
about linked data.

01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:53.970 position:56%
There are, there's information about
linked data all over the place.

01:16:53.970 --> 01:16:57.780
You can take formal
linked data training.

01:16:57.780 --> 01:16:59.180
There is that available.

01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:06.690
If you're an administrator, I would
say to you have discussion groups.

01:17:06.690 --> 01:17:13.370 position:56%
Invite your staff to sit down and
maybe have a regular brown bag lunch

01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:17.440
where they can talk about their
thoughts their concerns and learn

01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:20.550
from each other, from
each other's learning.

01:17:20.550 --> 01:17:24.380
Make it an open discussion.

01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:28.390
And then, if your staff or
you, your library can do it,

01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:30.520
get involved in experimentation
of some kind.

01:17:30.520 --> 01:17:33.810
It doesn't hurt to be playing with
things, you can't break anything

01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:36.550
because none of it
is real right now.

01:17:36.550 --> 01:17:37.850
It's just play.

01:17:37.850 --> 01:17:40.090
It's all just play right now.

01:17:40.090 --> 01:17:46.890
One of the things that we need
to do is adjust the way we think.

01:17:46.890 --> 01:17:49.910
Right? So, as I said, we
need to think in terms

01:17:49.910 --> 01:17:52.310
of data rather than records.

01:17:52.310 --> 01:17:59.330
So, for example, MARC allows us to
say that a bib record was created

01:17:59.330 --> 01:18:03.410
by one entity and then edited
or modified by other entities.

01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:07.230
I hate the 041.

01:18:07.230 --> 01:18:10.590
But, at a data level,
we can't identify.

01:18:10.590 --> 01:18:15.340
When you look at a MARC record, you
have absolutely no idea what piece

01:18:15.340 --> 01:18:19.100
of data OC created, NOM modified,

01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:22.430
and George Washington
University completely replaced.

01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:23.730
You don't know.

01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:25.650
All you know is that those
institutions touched that record

01:18:25.650 --> 01:18:27.820
and that you think those
institutions do good

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:29.380
cataloging work.

01:18:29.380 --> 01:18:33.910
So, do we really need to know?

01:18:33.910 --> 01:18:38.160
Do we really need to
know exactly what piece

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:43.600
of data any particular institution
contributes to MARC record.

01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:45.350
We don't know it now.

01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:52.280
Why would we insist on knowing
that in a linked data environment?

01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:58.200
Every time we use a triple,
every time we go out on the web

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:01.940
and pull something in, and
Dorothea's illustration

01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:04.730
of copy cataloging, going out
and pulling in different pieces,

01:19:04.730 --> 01:19:08.890 position:56%
every time we pull a piece of data
in, we are asserting that that piece

01:19:08.890 --> 01:19:13.010 position:56%
of data is an authoritative piece of
data that we believe that that piece

01:19:13.010 --> 01:19:15.690
of data is true and accurate.

01:19:15.690 --> 01:19:18.050
So, does it matter
where it comes from?

01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:22.280
Does it matter who originally
created it if it is true

01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.340
and accurate because that's
really what we're shooting

01:19:24.340 --> 01:19:29.840
for in the end is accuracy?

01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:33.810
So, there's conversion
programs out there right now,

01:19:33.810 --> 01:19:38.000
a couple conversion, a
legacy MARC to link data.

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.060
That conversion will be Lossy.

01:19:40.060 --> 01:19:41.360
Get used to it.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:42.660
Go with it.

01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:47.050
Move on. We are not
having MARC in RDF.

01:19:47.050 --> 01:19:51.200
There's MARC data that just
doesn't necessarily make sense.

01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:54.940
What we need to do, when we're
looking at this conversion

01:19:54.940 --> 01:20:00.170
of legacy MARC is to think
about what do we need?

01:20:00.170 --> 01:20:03.060
What can we afford to lose?

01:20:03.060 --> 01:20:05.100
There's a lot of redundant
data in MARC.

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:09.060
Right? what can we afford to lose
and what do we really need to keep

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.110
and who are we keeping it for?

01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:14.550
If we've been recording some
piece of data for 65 years

01:20:14.550 --> 01:20:18.250
because some day somebody may
want to use it, and no one has

01:20:18.250 --> 01:20:21.810
or it's been used twice,
I say throw it away.

01:20:21.810 --> 01:20:25.730
I clean out my closet at
the end of every season.

01:20:25.730 --> 01:20:30.560
If I have not worn something
that season, it goes to Goodwill.

01:20:30.560 --> 01:20:33.020
We need to start thinking
in those terms.

01:20:33.020 --> 01:20:35.580
I know it's a little harsh.

01:20:35.580 --> 01:20:38.930
But, it keeps my closet reasonable.

01:20:38.930 --> 01:20:44.750
So, some of the best training,

01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:51.350
most that I've ever had was
agile development training.

01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:56.180
The idea is that you
assess requirements,

01:20:56.180 --> 01:21:00.340
you develop a solution,
and then you reassess,

01:21:00.340 --> 01:21:02.470
you decide if the solution
still works,

01:21:02.470 --> 01:21:04.280
and you may revise the solution.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:09.860
And then, you go back and you
reassess, revise the solution.

01:21:09.860 --> 01:21:11.740
It's an iterative process.

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:14.140
And, one of the things that we
need to think about, if we're going

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:16.710
to keep up with technology and
we're going to keep moving along,

01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:19.590 position:56%
if we take this linked data path and
we're going to keep moving forward

01:21:19.590 --> 01:21:21.540
and we're not going to be left
behind the way we've been left

01:21:21.540 --> 01:21:25.160 position:56%
behind with MARC, we are never done.

01:21:25.160 --> 01:21:29.380
The process is never, there
is no such thing as finished.

01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:31.400
It is, you're always iterating.

01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:32.910
You have to get used to that.

01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:38.650
You have to start thinking that
the data may still all be there,

01:21:38.650 --> 01:21:41.640
might be called something, might
be tagged a little differently,

01:21:41.640 --> 01:21:43.690
it might show up a
little differently,

01:21:43.690 --> 01:21:46.780
dates may be formatted differently,
because five years from now we find

01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:48.320
out there's a better
way to format dates

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.220
than anybody's been doing before.

01:21:51.220 --> 01:21:52.620
It's okay.

01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:53.920
Change is good.

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:57.090
Change is okay as long as
we keep moving forward.

01:21:57.090 --> 01:22:04.950
So, I want to talk a little
bit about preparing data.

01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:06.330
And, I think I can cut some of this

01:22:06.330 --> 01:22:09.160
out because I think Dorothea
covered this really well.

01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:13.240
So, what can we do?

01:22:13.240 --> 01:22:18.990
What can we do to prepare
for linked data?

01:22:18.990 --> 01:22:23.050
We have data model
development going on.

01:22:23.050 --> 01:22:24.350
So, what does that mean?

01:22:24.350 --> 01:22:27.130
We had a question, I'm sorry
I didn't, I couldn't see

01:22:27.130 --> 01:22:30.010
who asked the question
about serials.

01:22:30.010 --> 01:22:34.470
So, okay, so in an environment
where you're looking at every piece

01:22:34.470 --> 01:22:38.020
of data and how ever piece of data
relates to another piece of data,

01:22:38.020 --> 01:22:42.490 position:56%
you have to think about how do we
model that data so that it describes

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:45.680
when you group it, or when you
pull pieces of it together,

01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:49.200
it describes what you need
it to describe in a good way,

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.870
in the way that you want it done?

01:22:50.870 --> 01:22:52.890
Right? So, you have the title.

01:22:52.890 --> 01:22:54.900
Serial has title.

01:22:54.900 --> 01:22:56.390
Serial has title, title.

01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:58.770
You have serial has
publisher, publisher.

01:22:58.770 --> 01:23:00.870
You have serial changed frequency.

01:23:00.870 --> 01:23:03.260
Ah oh, what do we do now?

01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:07.610
Right? Maybe what we do
is we model a data event

01:23:07.610 --> 01:23:10.870
and we say serial had event.

01:23:10.870 --> 01:23:12.230
Change frequency.

01:23:12.230 --> 01:23:15.060
And then, we move from there.

01:23:15.060 --> 01:23:19.060
We have to think about how we can
say these things in linked data,

01:23:19.060 --> 01:23:23.660
the things that we need to say,
need to say, how do we say them

01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:26.230
so that they make sense and
that the stupid computers

01:23:26.230 --> 01:23:29.140
and the stupid programs that
we use can put it all together

01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:33.230
and have it make sense to
someone else looking at it?

01:23:33.230 --> 01:23:37.050
And, work like this is going on.

01:23:37.050 --> 01:23:39.930
NLM has been working with
George Washington University,

01:23:39.930 --> 01:23:48.130
University California Davis, and
Sephora to model a big frame on,

01:23:48.130 --> 01:23:52.330
a big frame of linked
data model for motographs.

01:23:52.330 --> 01:23:53.980
We started with low hanging fruit

01:23:53.980 --> 01:23:56.300
and we actually published
that back in December.

01:23:56.300 --> 01:24:02.960
Sephora, if you are an
alumni of Sephora, training,

01:24:02.960 --> 01:24:06.330 position:56%
they have alumni cast groups that
they're putting together now to work

01:24:06.330 --> 01:24:09.970
on data modeling for
specific types of resources.

01:24:09.970 --> 01:24:11.400
And, anyone can join those.

01:24:11.400 --> 01:24:13.640
If you have to have gone through
training but you can join those

01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:15.090
and you also can follow them.

01:24:15.090 --> 01:24:17.400
If you, even if you can't
join, you can follow.

01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:21.110
There's a concert group that's been
put together also that's been put

01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:24.980
together to talk about
modeling for serials.

01:24:24.980 --> 01:24:28.280
So, there are things out there.

01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:32.230
And then, of course there
are the LD4 projects,

01:24:32.230 --> 01:24:35.090
LD4 and LD4P where they're
also looking at, part of those,

01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:36.490
part of those projects is looking

01:24:36.490 --> 01:24:39.160
at how they model data
for certain resources.

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:42.920
So, if you can't do
these things, you,

01:24:42.920 --> 01:24:44.780
or be part of these
particular things,

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:46.330
you can at least follow them.

01:24:46.330 --> 01:24:49.740
And, you can locally
warn institutions.

01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:52.890
Start to think about, start to
think about how would I model,

01:24:52.890 --> 01:24:55.620
serials are a great one,
how would I model a serial?

01:24:55.620 --> 01:24:58.270
How would I, how would
I make this look?

01:24:58.270 --> 01:25:01.640
And then, you can contribute
what you know to lists,

01:25:01.640 --> 01:25:04.910
you can contribute it to groups,
contribute it however you can.

01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:13.400
We already have a bunch of
RDF ontologies or schema.

01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:18.150
There are a lot out there.

01:25:18.150 --> 01:25:23.650
And, we need to start thinking
about which ones do we want to use

01:25:23.650 --> 01:25:25.930
or which pieces of
ones do we want to use.

01:25:25.930 --> 01:25:30.700
For example, there's one called
ProGo that has really nice modeling

01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:33.370
for providence information.

01:25:33.370 --> 01:25:40.160
Maybe we want to use big frame and
then also use some ProGo predicates

01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:42.220
when we're describing something.

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:46.670
So, we need to start thinking
about that as internally.

01:25:46.670 --> 01:25:48.230
What are we doing within
our library?

01:25:48.230 --> 01:25:50.620
But then, we also need to think
about what are we going to,

01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:53.110
are we going to have preferred
ontologies or preferred schema

01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:55.860
for certain kinds of
information certain kinds of data

01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:58.670
across libraries so
that we can make sure

01:25:58.670 --> 01:26:01.230
that we're all talking
the same language

01:26:01.230 --> 01:26:06.970
or speaking the same language
that we can all link together.

01:26:06.970 --> 01:26:09.450
Whose data do you want to use?

01:26:09.450 --> 01:26:12.470
Whose authoritative
data do you want to use?

01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:21.560
I have a colleague at UC Davis
who, her dream is to have an ISSN,

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:26.490
plug it into a form, have that form
send it out to the ISBN portal,

01:26:26.490 --> 01:26:30.150
pick up linked data from the ISB
portal and populate her form.

01:26:30.150 --> 01:26:32.860
It's a great dream.

01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:35.640 position:56%
But, she needs to talk to the people
at the ISS or the ISSN portal,

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:37.830
so she needs to talk to people
at the ISSN portal if she wants

01:26:37.830 --> 01:26:41.370
to make it happen because they
have to know that she's interested.

01:26:41.370 --> 01:26:45.100
So, at NLM we just finished
or we haven't finished,

01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:52.650
but we are closing a data project
where we publish MESH in RDF.

01:26:52.650 --> 01:26:57.260 position:56%
The way that came about was, as part
of the frame, early experimenters,

01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:01.140
Eric Miller of Sephora, the
first time I met him, sat me down

01:27:01.140 --> 01:27:03.580
and said I need to talk to you.

01:27:03.580 --> 01:27:07.210
And we sat over dinner and all he
kept telling me were used cases

01:27:07.210 --> 01:27:12.250
that he knew of that where
people wanted to use MESH in RDF.

01:27:12.250 --> 01:27:16.580
And that was the impetus, that
was what got that project started.

01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:19.460
So, you have to tell people
that you want to use your data.

01:27:19.460 --> 01:27:22.310
They have to know that there's
a need for their data in RDF

01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:25.290
to give them the impetus to change
it over so that you can use it.

01:27:25.290 --> 01:27:31.440
And we need to, we need
to expose our authorities.

01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.850
And, I think, Dorothea
covered this really well.

01:27:33.850 --> 01:27:36.650
If you've got a name authority
or if you've got something,

01:27:36.650 --> 01:27:40.790
a local name authority, your
professors, your faculty,

01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:46.820
get those names into, you know,
the shared authority files.

01:27:46.820 --> 01:27:48.950 position:56%
Get those names into VIAP or
Orchid, or Iznio [assumed spellings]

01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:52.340
or whatever, so that your
faculty can get out there,

01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:53.760
so that people can
find your faculty,

01:27:53.760 --> 01:27:57.310
you can link to your faculty,
people can link to your faculty.

01:27:57.310 --> 01:28:00.590
Share that stuff so that
those names are out there

01:28:00.590 --> 01:28:02.970
and they can be used by others.

01:28:16.000 --> 01:28:20.860
So, when we're recording data,
and again, Dorothea hit on this,

01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:22.430
we need to think about
best practices.

01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:27.180
Here's a PCC, and Jackie's going
to talk a little bit about this

01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:31.470
because she leads the group, but
there's a PCC task group on URI's

01:28:31.470 --> 01:28:35.550
that started, all really kind of
got started when Steve Fulsome

01:28:35.550 --> 01:28:38.370
from Cornell University
shared a paper,

01:28:38.370 --> 01:28:43.480 position:56%
white paper that he had written with
some friends about the many ways

01:28:43.480 --> 01:28:48.510
that identifiers are
recorded in MARC and the need

01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:50.940
for a consistent way to
record identifiers in MARC

01:28:50.940 --> 01:28:53.930
so that we could convert them

01:28:53.930 --> 01:29:00.530
into actionable IRI's,
actionable HTTP IRI's.

01:29:00.530 --> 01:29:01.880
You could do that.

01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:04.370
If you see a need, what he
did was, he wrote that paper,

01:29:04.370 --> 01:29:07.560 position:56%
somebody said to him you know what,
you should bring that to MAC at ALA.

01:29:07.560 --> 01:29:10.030
And, he brought it to MAC and
the folks at MAC said, you know,

01:29:10.030 --> 01:29:11.330
you really need to
bring that to the PCC.

01:29:11.330 --> 01:29:12.750
So, he brought it to the PCC.

01:29:12.750 --> 01:29:16.030
And now there's a PCC task group
looking into best practices

01:29:16.030 --> 01:29:19.920
for the creation of IRI's or URI's.

01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:24.170
If you see a need, get
the ball rolling, say it,

01:29:24.170 --> 01:29:26.080
collaborate, let people speak.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.180
Speak. Tell people.

01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:31.480
I think if we do this, or this
doesn't look to me like it's going

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:35.010
to work because it's a
string not an identifier

01:29:35.010 --> 01:29:37.970
or there are some different
ways to format this identifier.

01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:40.000
How can we make this better?

01:29:40.000 --> 01:29:42.650
If you see that need, participate.

01:29:42.650 --> 01:29:49.680
And, I am so in agreement we need
to deemphasize transcription.

01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.360 position:56%
I mean, some things, you can't
help, you got to transcribe a title,

01:29:52.360 --> 01:29:54.760
you got to transcribe
right, it's a title.

01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:59.990
But, but, roman numerals, really?

01:29:59.990 --> 01:30:03.520
Really? It drives me
absolutely insane.

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:06.880
I don't think people even know
what they mean half the time,

01:30:06.880 --> 01:30:08.180
forget computers.

01:30:08.180 --> 01:30:12.180
Right? It's just, really
lets drop the roman numerals.

01:30:12.180 --> 01:30:14.250
And then, there are
other things like that.

01:30:14.250 --> 01:30:15.620
Right? There are other
things like that.

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:18.940
If you really look at the MARC
data, really take a look and see,

01:30:18.940 --> 01:30:24.530
do I need to transcribe this or
can I do this a different way?

01:30:24.530 --> 01:30:29.350 position:56%
Another thing that we can look at
now that we can, we can start seeing

01:30:29.350 --> 01:30:33.300
as looking at the linked data
pilots and some of the tools.

01:30:33.300 --> 01:30:36.360
So, Library of Congress has got
a whole bunch of tools, right,

01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.910
that they're putting out and making
available for you to use and play

01:30:38.910 --> 01:30:40.210
with and experiment with.

01:30:40.210 --> 01:30:43.540
Sephora has some tools.

01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:49.800
UC Davis is working on making
available a cataloging module

01:30:49.800 --> 01:30:53.460
that will have the data
entry user interface

01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:57.850
and you can then see what your
data looks like as linked data.

01:30:57.850 --> 01:31:01.370
There's also RIMMF, that
Deborah Fritz has put out.

01:31:01.370 --> 01:31:06.540
So, there are things out
there that you can play with.

01:31:06.540 --> 01:31:09.030
Play with these things, take a
look, see what it looks like.

01:31:09.030 --> 01:31:11.610
And then, you can actually
you can make suggestions.

01:31:11.610 --> 01:31:14.880
You can say you know I would really
like this better if it did this

01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:17.330
or this would work better
for me if it did that.

01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:20.870
Right. So, Sephora's one of the
things, the Sephora's tool is

01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:25.140
that they you can actually
go out and, if you're looking

01:31:25.140 --> 01:31:29.310 position:56%
for an authority or name authority,
you can say I want to see the LCNAF,

01:31:29.310 --> 01:31:32.610
the LC name authority and
it'll give you a little box

01:31:32.610 --> 01:31:34.120 position:56%
and it'll show you what the data is.

01:31:34.120 --> 01:31:36.210
right n ow, it's only
machine readable.

01:31:36.210 --> 01:31:39.670
So, one of the things you can
tell Sephora is hey you know what,

01:31:39.670 --> 01:31:41.020
I need this to be human readable

01:31:41.020 --> 01:31:43.020
because this makes no
sense to me right now.

01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:45.990
This doesn't help me to
distinguish it from anything else.

01:31:45.990 --> 01:31:48.340
You can play with these
things, you can make comment,

01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:51.230
you can help effect
how they are developed.

01:31:52.930 --> 01:31:58.180
So, we can also prepare
for discovery.

01:31:59.260 --> 01:32:02.620
You'll like this one Dorothea.

01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:05.530
We, this is from the Treasurer

01:32:05.530 --> 01:32:10.690
of the Tres Riches Heures du Duc de
Berry 15th Century Book of Hours.

01:32:10.690 --> 01:32:14.670
We need to, we need to
seed the semantic web.

01:32:14.670 --> 01:32:19.070
We need to seed it with
authoritative data.

01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:27.000
Our standard vocabularies,
subjects, subjects MESH LC, LCSH.

01:32:27.000 --> 01:32:29.470
Some of this work is
already being done.

01:32:29.470 --> 01:32:32.030
Right. National Agricultural
Library has done this with,

01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:35.870
and if there's anyone here
forgive me is it [inaudible]?

01:32:35.870 --> 01:32:40.490
And, you know, name authorities.

01:32:40.490 --> 01:32:42.670
All of these things,
these are all seeds,

01:32:42.670 --> 01:32:46.410
these are all that we get
these standard vocabularies

01:32:46.410 --> 01:32:53.700
out there identified in a standard
way and then we can link to them.

01:32:53.700 --> 01:32:57.650
But, if we have nothing to link to,
if I want to, if I'm, if I'm an NRM

01:32:57.650 --> 01:33:01.410
and I'm cataloging, I'm trying
to catalog with some a book

01:33:01.410 --> 01:33:04.270
in linked data and we only
use MESH subject headings,

01:33:04.270 --> 01:33:08.660
and MESH is not available
on RDF, I'm stuck.

01:33:08.660 --> 01:33:11.610 position:56%
Right? How's anybody on the web
going to find those subject headings

01:33:11.610 --> 01:33:13.970
if given a linked data environment?

01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:22.760
And, we think, we need to take,
this is, I lie awake at night

01:33:22.760 --> 01:33:24.060
and think about these things.

01:33:24.060 --> 01:33:28.400
But, with the prospect of, I
don't know, hundreds of thousands

01:33:28.400 --> 01:33:30.330
of libraries, I don't even know
how many libraries there are

01:33:30.330 --> 01:33:31.630
across the world.

01:33:31.630 --> 01:33:35.690
Right. Exposing their collections
as linked data on the web, I think,

01:33:35.690 --> 01:33:38.760
there's going to be an
information explosion.

01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.140
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe
there's some way

01:33:40.140 --> 01:33:43.080
to manage this that
I don't understand.

01:33:43.080 --> 01:33:45.400 position:56%
But, how will libraries manage that?

01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:48.260
Right? So, we want our local
constituents to be able

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:50.260
to find our resources easily.

01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:53.010
But, not all our users are local.

01:33:53.010 --> 01:33:57.910
And, we want our collections to
be discovered across the world.

01:33:57.910 --> 01:34:00.840
So, everybody has a
copy, not everybody, but,

01:34:00.840 --> 01:34:04.250
most people probably have a
copy of Grey's Anatomy, right.

01:34:04.250 --> 01:34:08.210
That's not one of those things
that is unique to any one library.

01:34:08.210 --> 01:34:12.700
But, Marshall Nirenberg's Nobel
Prize is unique to the NLM.

01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:15.140
We want people to know that
that's there to be able to find it

01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:19.950 position:56%
and maybe be able to see it if we've
got a photo of it or his collections

01:34:19.950 --> 01:34:21.540
to be able to find those.

01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:23.650
Those are the things we
really want to stress.

01:34:23.650 --> 01:34:24.950
Right. So those are the things

01:34:24.950 --> 01:34:27.140
that I think we need
to think about first.

01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:29.700
Sure, it's easy to model
books as Low Hanging Fruit.

01:34:29.700 --> 01:34:31.310
Serials need to be done too.

01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:32.670
But, you know what,

01:34:32.670 --> 01:34:34.750
nearly everybody's got a
copy of Jama somewhere.

01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:38.760
Right? Everybody's got a
copy of Nature somewhere.

01:34:38.760 --> 01:34:42.360
Not everybody has a copy of
Marshall Nirenberg's papers.

01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:47.950
When Diana, so one of the things
that I think we need to think

01:34:47.950 --> 01:34:51.220
about is can we work with
the search engine providers?

01:34:51.220 --> 01:34:56.800
Can we work with them to help
get our expose our library data

01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:03.930
in a way that's manageable that
doesn't explode people's brains?

01:35:03.930 --> 01:35:08.090
When I worked, I was a consultant
to the working group on the future

01:35:08.090 --> 01:35:11.880
of bibliographic control which
Deanna Marcum put together.

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:14.700
And one of the things she
did was to invite Google

01:35:14.700 --> 01:35:16.240
and Microsoft to the table.

01:35:16.240 --> 01:35:18.420
And, they agreed to join.

01:35:18.420 --> 01:35:19.890
They were at every meeting.

01:35:19.890 --> 01:35:24.180
They were at every, every public
presentation that went on.

01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:27.720
And, behind the scenes
they worked with us.

01:35:27.720 --> 01:35:32.160
Maybe it's time for us
to reopen that door.

01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:35.790
Maybe we need to talk to them
and say these are our concerns.

01:35:35.790 --> 01:35:38.170 position:56%
Maybe you have a way to manage this.

01:35:38.170 --> 01:35:40.690
Maybe we can figure out
together a way to manage this.

01:35:40.690 --> 01:35:44.970
Maybe you don't care.

01:35:44.970 --> 01:35:48.490
Maybe, we can work with them.

01:35:48.490 --> 01:35:50.800
So, this is, this is
a knowledge graph.

01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:52.300
So, Dorothea talked before

01:35:52.300 --> 01:35:56.730
about using schema
markup, microdata markup.

01:35:56.730 --> 01:35:59.170
This is a knowledge
graph from Google, which,

01:35:59.170 --> 01:36:01.460
if you look up Marie Curie,
this is that thing that shows

01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:04.490
up on the right side of the screen
and gives you some information.

01:36:04.490 --> 01:36:07.090
And, this is all linked data.

01:36:07.090 --> 01:36:10.680
This is all coming from Schema.

01:36:10.680 --> 01:36:12.160
Libraries aren't here anywhere.

01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:13.630
You've got quotes.

01:36:13.630 --> 01:36:16.570
Right. You've got a little bit of
biographical information quotes

01:36:16.570 --> 01:36:19.330
and then you've got
people also search for.

01:36:19.330 --> 01:36:25.890
What if, what if it also included
resources in libraries and museums?

01:36:25.890 --> 01:36:30.280 position:56%
What if there was a way to say, hum,
you know there's so many millions

01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:35.020
of pieces of data coming in from
libraries, what if we group it?

01:36:35.020 --> 01:36:39.310
Oops. And, even better, what if
we can group it, because we have

01:36:39.310 --> 01:36:42.580
such great data, and
say I want literature,

01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:44.940
I can show you literature
by Marie Curie,

01:36:44.940 --> 01:36:46.650
we can show you literature
about her.

01:36:46.650 --> 01:36:49.160
We can show you her letters.

01:36:49.160 --> 01:36:52.450
We can show you her
manuscript archive collections.

01:36:52.450 --> 01:36:54.290
We can show you images
and we can show you film.

01:36:54.290 --> 01:36:55.590
What if we give them?

01:36:55.590 --> 01:36:59.370
We can even give them some facets
because we do have such great data.

01:36:59.370 --> 01:37:01.340
Something to think about.

01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:07.230
So, at the heart of all the
stuff that I've been talking

01:37:07.230 --> 01:37:09.630
about is the ability
to link our data.

01:37:09.630 --> 01:37:13.760
And, ultimately, that can't happen
if we don't use IRI's instead

01:37:13.760 --> 01:37:15.470
of strings wherever we can.

01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:19.850
So, I'm going to turn this over
to Jackie now who is the IRI guru.

01:37:19.850 --> 01:37:23.470
And, she will talk to you about
her experiences with IRI's.

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:45.310
&gt;&gt; Jackie Shieh: So, the
secret is the identifier.

01:37:45.310 --> 01:37:52.470
And so, with this,
the secret is out.

01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:58.570
So, my portion, hopefully
will not disappoint you is

01:37:58.570 --> 01:38:04.410
that how TW intended
to bring that down

01:38:04.410 --> 01:38:10.340
to our routine daily
operation level.

01:38:10.340 --> 01:38:18.010
And, as you know, my long
journey with electronic resources.

01:38:18.010 --> 01:38:24.450
I was at UVA playing with TI
Header and I was at University

01:38:24.450 --> 01:38:28.300
of Michigan I was working
with Google Books,

01:38:28.300 --> 01:38:33.830
working with finding things out
in copyright and now our print.

01:38:33.830 --> 01:38:39.780
And now, I'm in GW working
with a group of staff to figure

01:38:39.780 --> 01:38:43.020
out how we could expose our data.

01:38:43.020 --> 01:38:51.990
So, Nancy eluded to earlier the IRI
and this is what my focus is going

01:38:51.990 --> 01:39:02.240
to be is making sure that we are
looking at a script that is usable

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:10.080
across different domain and
it is accessible globally.

01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:18.750 position:56%
With that in mind, I think, everyone
by now has an idea the triples.

01:39:18.750 --> 01:39:23.890
And, the second I that
Nancy eluded to eluded

01:39:23.890 --> 01:39:28.910
to [inaudible] is the focus
of what and RDF statement is,

01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:32.120
is this identifier that is unique.

01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:37.270
And, it is universal.

01:39:37.270 --> 01:39:44.740
Now, the thing is, with this IRI,

01:39:44.740 --> 01:39:50.590
it has to be that it can
provide linking asset

01:39:50.590 --> 01:39:54.700
through a variety of
networks globally.

01:39:57.930 --> 01:40:05.820
So, this is essentially is, if you
were to work with an RDF statement,

01:40:05.820 --> 01:40:11.300
you can see that an
identifier is an typical element

01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:14.310
of this identification process.

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:22.030
So, why do we put so much emphasis
on understanding an identifier?

01:40:22.030 --> 01:40:27.720
And, from this point forward, I'm
going to just use the word IRI.

01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:33.000
It facilitate the exposure,
inhale, transmit,

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:38.010
and exchange all data
by the networks.

01:40:38.010 --> 01:40:44.150
Now, when it is persistent,
unambiguous, and uniform syntax,

01:40:44.150 --> 01:40:50.110
and it is consistent over
time, it is of high value

01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:58.500
because you were allowed computer
to not only understand the content

01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:04.800
but also derive knew knowledge
about reasoning about that content.

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:07.010
And, that is the key.

01:41:07.010 --> 01:41:10.900
In an IDF environment
where the process

01:41:10.900 --> 01:41:16.760
of URI is shows how
this allows the machine

01:41:16.760 --> 01:41:22.610 position:56%
to not only understand what is being
connected but also have the ability

01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:26.580
to reason and derive
new knowledge from it.

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:31.840
And then, that is how the
web of data gets created

01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:36.500
and the URI is undeniable
the hallmark

01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:42.150 position:56%
of whole process the link open data.

01:41:42.150 --> 01:41:49.060
TW has been fortunate to have been
able to participate in the process

01:41:49.060 --> 01:41:56.140 position:56%
of different initiatives as an early
experimenter and a test implementer

01:41:56.140 --> 01:42:01.900
and experience with National
Library of Medicine, they say begin

01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:05.970
to contemplate the approach,
the modular approach.

01:42:05.970 --> 01:42:09.670
We were fortunate enough to
be at the table and observe

01:42:09.670 --> 01:42:16.900
and participate so, how do we get
to where we are right now is simply

01:42:16.900 --> 01:42:22.560 position:56%
because through the grueling process
of two years that we participated

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:27.470
in those different initiatives,
we went through numerous webinar,

01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:37.790 position:56%
study halls, exercises, pair studies
that made us realize that we need

01:42:37.790 --> 01:42:41.420
to begin to have a
vision within this.

01:42:41.420 --> 01:42:47.300
What do I want to do with my
profession, to move forward

01:42:47.300 --> 01:42:53.000
to be counted in this
web aligned servers?

01:42:54.310 --> 01:43:01.170
How are we going to learn to be
able to make use of the skills,

01:43:01.170 --> 01:43:06.900
the knowledge that we could
already have and contribute

01:43:06.900 --> 01:43:13.070
to the wider world of the
knowledge of information sphere?

01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:15.880
So, throughout this process,

01:43:15.880 --> 01:43:22.790
we begin to have our a vision how
we can move together as a team.

01:43:22.790 --> 01:43:29.150
We learn how to facilitate that
[inaudible] through the process

01:43:29.150 --> 01:43:32.820
that open source software
make available to us.

01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:41.290
And my hearing from Dorothea
sharing the skillset, I must say,

01:43:41.290 --> 01:43:44.520
I was really comforted
to know, two years ago,

01:43:44.520 --> 01:43:48.710
I couldn't have said this,
in front of all of you.

01:43:48.710 --> 01:43:55.250
But, now, my team, the only
skills that we are in lack of,

01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:56.580
in need of, is [inaudible].

01:43:56.580 --> 01:44:04.120
We have every single one that
Dorothea mentioned on her slide.

01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:05.690
And, it took three years.

01:44:05.690 --> 01:44:11.220 position:56%
It took three years constantly
learning and throughout the process.

01:44:11.220 --> 01:44:18.720 position:56%
So, you know, it is not difficult
for all of us here to sit aside time

01:44:18.720 --> 01:44:22.710
and communicate to your
manager, your supervisor

01:44:22.710 --> 01:44:24.640
and say this is, I have a vision.

01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:25.980
I'd like to do this.

01:44:25.980 --> 01:44:27.280
Do I have the time?

01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:28.580
You give me the time.

01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:32.670
How I can adjust my workload
in order to accomplish that?

01:44:32.670 --> 01:44:36.080
Because, this is event,
you know, ultimately,

01:44:36.080 --> 01:44:40.900
it's a great contribution
to the profession.

01:44:40.900 --> 01:44:47.160
So, in that, we began to consider
how then we could continue

01:44:47.160 --> 01:44:49.380
our experimentation.

01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:54.550
How can we use this in
the MARC environment?

01:44:54.550 --> 01:44:59.970
How is it that the RDF
linking concept can be expanded

01:44:59.970 --> 01:45:02.920
in our current IOS system?

01:45:04.270 --> 01:45:11.160
So, here's some of the questions
that, before we started, we had to,

01:45:11.160 --> 01:45:14.290
there's a way to attempt to answer.

01:45:14.290 --> 01:45:20.420
IRI in MARC, with MARC
we encode data in MARC.

01:45:20.420 --> 01:45:24.550
You would have to decide
the field where it goes.

01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:31.690
And then, you have to know
is there a set field for it?

01:45:31.690 --> 01:45:38.160
And so, how did this relate to
the process that we already learn

01:45:38.160 --> 01:45:42.140
when we were experimenting
different?

01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:47.000
In order to accomplish
that, what type of workflow

01:45:47.000 --> 01:45:49.210
and changes must take place

01:45:49.210 --> 01:45:55.050
so that we could accomplish this
little tiny bit of the process?

01:45:55.050 --> 01:45:59.800
And so, we began investigating
and doing research.

01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:01.600
So, the first thing we found

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:06.940
on the MARC standard side
were this is instruction.

01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:13.520
It is, there is ability for us
to play with the data and for,

01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:18.410
in our case, we didn't really quite
understand, when we first began

01:46:18.410 --> 01:46:26.480
in 2013, September, we didn't quite
understand how we can construct

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:32.090
those using the form that
we're most interested in.

01:46:32.090 --> 01:46:37.250
And, we did not know
what kind of impact

01:46:37.250 --> 01:46:43.370
that the data would do
to avoid your system.

01:46:43.370 --> 01:46:48.810
So, our focus is on
nonliteral surrogate value

01:46:48.810 --> 01:46:53.750
which is the HTTP URI
not the text read

01:46:53.750 --> 01:46:56.610
because over the years we've
been playing with data.

01:46:56.610 --> 01:47:01.090
We've been shifting our
mindset from putting in stream,

01:47:01.090 --> 01:47:04.780
thinking the stream in
terms of stream is data.

01:47:04.780 --> 01:47:08.260
So then, what else?

01:47:08.260 --> 01:47:13.290
Because we are also an OCLC library
in addition, we need to know what

01:47:13.290 --> 01:47:16.830
that means in an OCLC environment.

01:47:16.830 --> 01:47:20.840
And, unfortunately, we
can't do anything in OCLC.

01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:26.040
This is the guideline
basically said nothing can,

01:47:26.040 --> 01:47:29.230
we could not do anything
with Sephora 0.

01:47:29.230 --> 01:47:37.600
So, that essentially opened up the
door for us to experiment locally

01:47:37.600 --> 01:47:40.930
in a local voyager system.

01:47:40.930 --> 01:47:47.610
So, before that, we also
began to find to see

01:47:47.610 --> 01:47:52.110
if we could locate other
type of usage in Sephora 0

01:47:52.110 --> 01:47:55.480
that already in connection.

01:47:55.480 --> 01:48:02.630 position:56%
And, most of them we found this
format that's very much like the 035

01:48:02.630 --> 01:48:04.640
that everyone was aware of.

01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:09.060
So, will put an organization
code within purines followed

01:48:09.060 --> 01:48:12.190
by another numeric identifier.

01:48:12.190 --> 01:48:18.080 position:56%
You could also use the international
standard code that is provided.

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:21.250
And, you can find that at
the Library of Congress site

01:48:21.250 --> 01:48:26.740
with the identifier associated
with that particular service.

01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:32.260 position:56%
So, along with all of this
research that we have gained so far,

01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:35.240
we began to test our data.

01:48:35.240 --> 01:48:39.870
And, our favorite example
was Miss Jen Olson's work.

01:48:39.870 --> 01:48:49.140
So, in 2013, we extracted about
less than 100 Jen Olson's work

01:48:49.140 --> 01:48:54.850
to see how well we can do.

01:48:54.850 --> 01:48:57.980
We [inaudible] IRI
in the [inaudible]

01:48:57.980 --> 01:49:07.790
at the same time we have the
stream base IRI, stream base IRI

01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:15.330
in the system, we populated in
the name heading, set the heading

01:49:15.330 --> 01:49:21.920
and the tracing which
is now the 700s area.

01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:29.830
We loaded about 500 Sephora 0
[inaudible] Voyager back in 2013.

01:49:29.830 --> 01:49:36.330
And to our surprise and
perhaps a sigh of relief,

01:49:36.330 --> 01:49:38.850
we didn't break the system.

01:49:38.850 --> 01:49:41.030
It just simply be there.

01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:43.780
It just simply there.

01:49:43.780 --> 01:49:48.590
Our web services did
not even notice.

01:49:48.590 --> 01:49:54.380
And so they, nobody shout out
and said what are you doing.

01:49:54.380 --> 01:50:02.010
So, so we, we, so, let it sit for
a little bit before we move forward

01:50:02.010 --> 01:50:06.080
with it because we didn't
quite understand the impact

01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:13.920
of an identifier in an
IRI HTTP environment.

01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:18.260
And, the reason we finally
settle that if we were

01:50:18.260 --> 01:50:24.500
to move forward putting
identifier in IRI Voyager,

01:50:24.500 --> 01:50:29.740
we were up to do a HTTP IRI.

01:50:29.740 --> 01:50:32.570
And, these are some of the reasons

01:50:32.570 --> 01:50:40.100
that convince us that
is the route to go.

01:50:40.100 --> 01:50:43.760
And one opportunity came, and I
think all of you probably have

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:45.790
that in your environment.

01:50:45.790 --> 01:50:51.980
In 2014, August, our
Student Committee,

01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:55.970
TW is part of the Washington
Research Library Association.

01:50:55.970 --> 01:50:59.370
One of the initiatives that was
set out by the Student Committee

01:50:59.370 --> 01:51:07.060
as a 2015 initiative was to
develop and implement a plan

01:51:07.060 --> 01:51:12.290
that would successfully transition
library's demographic records

01:51:12.290 --> 01:51:16.970
to the new library system
platform including consolidating

01:51:16.970 --> 01:51:21.490
to a single record
addressing authority control

01:51:21.490 --> 01:51:25.010
and tine implementation of RDA.

01:51:25.010 --> 01:51:30.830 position:56%
Now, one of the very first thing was
identify by the Metadata Committee,

01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:35.110
was perhaps, most of
you are not unfamiliar

01:51:35.110 --> 01:51:38.910
with is the reclamation
process with OCLC.

01:51:38.910 --> 01:51:45.370
So, I don't think I need to go into
detail what reclamation does or is.

01:51:45.370 --> 01:51:50.590
So, we began our reclamation
project in October of 2014

01:51:50.590 --> 01:51:52.310
which initiated a process.

01:51:52.310 --> 01:51:58.420
But, the whole project didn't
actually start until January

01:51:58.420 --> 01:52:01.190
because we used that
about three months process

01:52:01.190 --> 01:52:10.730
to identify strategies, develop a
plan, and how it would be workable

01:52:10.730 --> 01:52:14.230
with limited staff that we have.

01:52:14.230 --> 01:52:20.260
And also, through all this process,
I'd been talking too Terry Reese

01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:26.890
because back in August of 2014,

01:52:26.890 --> 01:52:34.490
he had mind to begin populating
his [inaudible] additional tools

01:52:34.490 --> 01:52:37.830
to prepare libraries
for linked data.

01:52:37.830 --> 01:52:39.130
And the first thing he put

01:52:39.130 --> 01:52:45.060
in that tool was different
transformation tool.

01:52:45.060 --> 01:52:51.700
So had it not for [inaudible] we
had to go through grueling process

01:52:51.700 --> 01:52:57.060
of writing code in Perl,
which that I'm familiar with,

01:52:57.060 --> 01:53:02.750
utilizing a series of
Perl modules like LIBCURL,

01:53:02.750 --> 01:53:07.860
Library Client URL Protocol, LWP,

01:53:07.860 --> 01:53:15.570
LW in Perl to query data
against RDF services.

01:53:15.570 --> 01:53:23.470
So, from March to May, as soon as
we get a report back from OCLC.

01:53:23.470 --> 01:53:26.840
You know that our data
has part OCLC.

01:53:26.840 --> 01:53:34.510
Our next step is we need to put
our data back into our system.

01:53:34.510 --> 01:53:38.880
So, at that time, we were
thinking, if we were to do that,

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:43.900
we can now take this
opportunity to enhance our data.

01:53:43.900 --> 01:53:49.710
We, the commission project,
essentially, we were thinking

01:53:49.710 --> 01:53:54.220
of doing close to two
million TW records.

01:53:54.220 --> 01:53:57.710
But, we have passed
it out in phases.

01:53:57.710 --> 01:54:02.570
And that the phase one was the
almost a million [inaudible]

01:54:02.570 --> 01:54:11.360
and it was 999,785 type records.

01:54:11.360 --> 01:54:17.630 position:56%
So, it's a little bit shy of a one
million records per physical pieces.

01:54:17.630 --> 01:54:25.990
So that's means book, serial, DVD,
CD, CD rom and all of the above.

01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:29.290
We didn't, we left out
electronic resources

01:54:29.290 --> 01:54:32.560
because we were advised
to do it differently.

01:54:32.560 --> 01:54:35.770
So, that's where we are by now.

01:54:35.770 --> 01:54:43.990
So, with that process, we ran, we
talked to Terry Reese and worked

01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:45.940
with him with troubleshooting.

01:54:45.940 --> 01:54:53.680
And he put, made available these
tools which is fabulous, fabulous.

01:54:53.680 --> 01:55:04.100
We ran our records, we select the
Sephora 0 that we wanted to input.

01:55:04.100 --> 01:55:09.820
The service that he made available
through his link data lookup,

01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:14.890
the triple source that are
available is humongous.

01:55:14.890 --> 01:55:17.870
But, we just wanted to test to see

01:55:17.870 --> 01:55:21.770
if we just had one
and what it would do.

01:55:21.770 --> 01:55:27.930
And, I must tell you, with five
dedicated machines, three very,

01:55:27.930 --> 01:55:33.260
three plus a troubleshooter,
so now fourth staff member,

01:55:33.260 --> 01:55:40.130
dedicated staff member
that months of July

01:55:40.130 --> 01:55:47.240
and August was sleepless night for
many of us, for many of us there.

01:55:47.240 --> 01:55:55.420
Now, Terry Reese recently also
added comment line process.

01:55:55.420 --> 01:56:00.910
And, that is tremendously helpful
because I am a comment line person.

01:56:00.910 --> 01:56:04.470
So, I can stack the
command and prompt feeding

01:56:04.470 --> 01:56:09.560 position:56%
in my 390 files at a different time.

01:56:09.560 --> 01:56:16.420
and so, from the last week of
June to the last week of August,

01:56:16.420 --> 01:56:19.500
there's a reason why we
had to get it done was

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:23.430
because of school starting
the first week of September.

01:56:23.430 --> 01:56:27.060
And, we had to make sure all
our records are accessible

01:56:27.060 --> 01:56:30.320
and ready for our students.

01:56:30.320 --> 01:56:37.920
And, this is what he will
see before July 26, I think,

01:56:37.920 --> 01:56:42.750
this is what before we are, the
actual replacement took place.

01:56:42.750 --> 01:56:44.670
And, we couldn't have done this

01:56:44.670 --> 01:56:52.920 position:56%
without our WRLC colleagues standing
alongside and being with us.

01:56:52.920 --> 01:57:00.890
I think the latest they worked was
like 10pm and, I work early hours.

01:57:00.890 --> 01:57:05.000
So, when I get up at
five I saw my files.

01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:08.470
So, that really worked
out very well.

01:57:08.470 --> 01:57:12.540
We, our record right now
had gone through RDA,

01:57:12.540 --> 01:57:21.050
so our records are RDA compliant
with Sephora 0 GDP IRI available.

01:57:21.050 --> 01:57:27.140
And, as of September
1st, this is our stats.

01:57:27.140 --> 01:57:33.670
Close to four million
Sephora 0 in our Voyager data.

01:57:33.670 --> 01:57:40.980
99.35% of them resulted from
our reclamation project.

01:57:40.980 --> 01:57:47.550
I think this is really doable.

01:57:47.550 --> 01:57:52.940
And, you know, need a little
bit of organizational, you know,

01:57:52.940 --> 01:57:56.430
talking through with
your administrator,

01:57:56.430 --> 01:58:00.150
talking through with your team.

01:58:00.150 --> 01:58:06.300
If you really are fretting this
programing side of the activities,

01:58:06.300 --> 01:58:09.020
talk to your programing IT folks.

01:58:09.020 --> 01:58:12.690
It doesn't take them that long
to come up with a solution.

01:58:12.690 --> 01:58:17.990
So, for now, this point forward
for us, we now, we could worry less

01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:21.480
about a lot of the process
that are traditional,

01:58:21.480 --> 01:58:26.860 position:56%
cataloging data management processes
that we could begin to focus

01:58:26.860 --> 01:58:32.290 position:56%
on the following, understanding what
type of ontologies IP services are

01:58:32.290 --> 01:58:36.310
out there, the vocabulary
allow us to do a different type

01:58:36.310 --> 01:58:39.930
of data modeling so that we
can serve our communities,

01:58:39.930 --> 01:58:43.040
broaden their horizon.

01:58:43.040 --> 01:58:48.980
We came to understand that linked
data ecosystems will enable our

01:58:48.980 --> 01:58:53.080
researchers to have
their research exposed

01:58:53.080 --> 01:59:03.060
to have their research
be elevated to the level

01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:05.630
that they are easily found.

01:59:05.630 --> 01:59:10.850
And, the metadata that we are
created, we are creating right now,

01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:16.780
reach beyond our library walls and
the technology that is associated

01:59:16.780 --> 01:59:20.560
with this will work
efficiently with the data.

01:59:20.560 --> 01:59:26.590
And this is not just library data,
this is data across the globe.

01:59:26.590 --> 01:59:29.580
And, this activity,
like Nancy eluded

01:59:29.580 --> 01:59:32.560
to earlier, have been noted by PCC.

01:59:32.560 --> 01:59:40.350
PCC called a task group together
with a fine group of members

01:59:40.350 --> 01:59:45.140
and it's, and an extremely,
extremely stellar group

01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:49.550
of professionals serving
as consultants.

01:59:49.550 --> 01:59:53.570
This team's going to take us some
time, it's going to take some time

01:59:53.570 --> 01:59:56.380
for this team to come together
making recommendations.

01:59:56.380 --> 02:00:02.200
But we are making good progress
in terms of looking through what's

02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:05.800
out there, what's being done,
and what is the feasible.

02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:10.910
And one thing that it's
reading in our mind is

02:00:10.910 --> 02:00:13.150
when we make a recommendation,

02:00:13.150 --> 02:00:17.570
it will be an incremental
recommendation for change.

02:00:17.570 --> 02:00:21.970
It will not be something so
drastic that the rug will be pulled

02:00:21.970 --> 02:00:26.110
under your feet and you
have nothing to hold on to.

02:00:26.110 --> 02:00:30.380
Now how many of you
are Ex Libris customers

02:00:30.380 --> 02:00:34.280 position:56%
that are using either Primo or Alma?

02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:37.640
Oh, not many.

02:00:37.640 --> 02:00:41.300
Okay. How many of you
are Sirsi customers?

02:00:41.300 --> 02:00:47.360
Okay, now then this just came out.

02:00:48.810 --> 02:00:55.550
If you are a user, customers of
Ex Libris that are using Alma

02:00:55.550 --> 02:01:01.230
and Primo, a call has gone
out this Monday, okay?

02:01:01.230 --> 02:01:08.420
Sirsi Dynex has provided a widget
in their BLUEcloud for libraries

02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:12.740
to generate identifiers associated

02:01:12.740 --> 02:01:16.420
with that entity that
they are creating.

02:01:16.420 --> 02:01:20.290
Mind you, this is for discovery.

02:01:20.290 --> 02:01:24.830
What I shared earlier
is the raw data

02:01:24.830 --> 02:01:30.620
that we are providing our
users and our IT folks.

02:01:30.620 --> 02:01:36.470
This, it's great for Sirsi and
Ex libris, but they don't come

02:01:36.470 --> 02:01:39.900
down to our local system.

02:01:39.900 --> 02:01:43.550
They stay with the discovery layer.

02:01:43.550 --> 02:01:49.080
What I am promoting is for all of
us, if you can find a way to get it

02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:53.040 position:56%
in your system, whichever it may be,

02:01:53.040 --> 02:01:59.560
it could be [inaudible],
follow the standard.

02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:05.810
Your library discovery
team would love this.

02:02:05.810 --> 02:02:11.270 position:56%
Because when I, when we made an
announcement internally, by the way,

02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:14.080
this is the first public
forum I'm sharing this,

02:02:14.080 --> 02:02:16.230
so you are the first to know.

02:02:16.230 --> 02:02:22.830 position:56%
This is not widely known that GW
had almost four meetings [inaudible]

02:02:22.830 --> 02:02:27.320
in HTTP actionable
IRI in the system.

02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:32.640
In fact, when we started, we
shared with Library of Congress,

02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:37.230
Library of Congress has less
than 200 [inaudible] embedded

02:02:37.230 --> 02:02:43.010
and they are not HTTP IRI.

02:02:43.010 --> 02:02:48.940
So this is really phenomenal
for our discovery team.

02:02:48.940 --> 02:02:52.030
They are writing programs
because they,

02:02:52.030 --> 02:02:55.240
this has just happened
like last month.

02:02:55.240 --> 02:03:00.190
So we are waiting to see how
this will impact our service.

02:03:00.190 --> 02:03:07.660 position:56%
But as I'm sharing earlier, when we
tested it in 2013, nothing happened.

02:03:07.660 --> 02:03:13.680
Okay? So you will not break
your system, I don't think.

02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:16.450
So, you know, test it.

02:03:16.450 --> 02:03:21.650
And then let it be known that there
is this subset, there's this pilot,

02:03:21.650 --> 02:03:25.060
and see what your discovery
team can do with it.

02:03:25.060 --> 02:03:31.270
And I must say that GW
wasn't the single institution

02:03:31.270 --> 02:03:33.110
in this country testing it.

02:03:33.110 --> 02:03:34.800
They have many people testing it.

02:03:34.800 --> 02:03:39.970
They are just probably the first
one to put it in production.

02:03:39.970 --> 02:03:43.250
And this is our retrospective
process for reclamation,

02:03:43.250 --> 02:03:48.650
but for the ongoing, incoming
title, we have, we are running

02:03:48.650 --> 02:03:52.030
through marc edit, [inaudible].

02:03:52.030 --> 02:03:57.780
Now I know for sure, European
libraries are doing this locally.

02:03:57.780 --> 02:04:02.320
It's just right now, simply because
[inaudible] zero, the URI, the IRI,

02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:08.250
the format you use in marc
environment hasn't been settled,

02:04:08.250 --> 02:04:10.850
so a lot of people are asked
and they're not sure how

02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:15.240
to contribute this data back
into a utility such as OCLC

02:04:15.240 --> 02:04:20.950
and like I shared earlier, you see
OCLC said no to [inaudible] zero.

02:04:20.950 --> 02:04:26.090
So a lot of these things are all
happening locally, Swedish Library,

02:04:26.090 --> 02:04:30.130
the National Library of Spain,
German National Library,

02:04:30.130 --> 02:04:32.330
British Library, these
are the libraries

02:04:32.330 --> 02:04:37.170
that we should be keeping tabs
on what they are doing locally.

02:04:37.170 --> 02:04:40.900
And soon enough, hopefully
all of this data

02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:45.980
in individual systems will
benefit all of us at large.

02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:52.120
So I'm going to leave you this,
that I love, there is a tide

02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:58.050
in the affairs of men, which taken
at the flood, leads on to fortune.

02:04:58.050 --> 02:05:02.450
Omitted all the voyage
of their life is bound

02:05:02.450 --> 02:05:05.630
in shallows and in miseries.

02:05:05.630 --> 02:05:14.470 position:56%
On such a full sea are we now
afloat, and we must take the current

02:05:14.470 --> 02:05:24.490
where it serves or lose our
fortune, ventures, sorry.

02:05:24.490 --> 02:05:30.350
This is from Shakespeare,
The Tragedy of Julius Caesar.

02:05:30.350 --> 02:05:32.650
Thank you.

02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:41.720
&gt;&gt; Mark Winek: Thank you to both,
thank you to both Nancy and Jackie.

02:05:41.720 --> 02:05:43.860
And I'd invite both
of them to come up.

02:05:43.860 --> 02:05:46.750
I think we have time
for about two questions.

02:05:46.750 --> 02:05:48.080
I don't want to.

02:05:48.080 --> 02:05:49.380
&gt;&gt; Jackie Shieh: Sorry.

02:05:49.380 --> 02:05:50.680
&gt;&gt; Mark Winek: That's okay.

02:05:50.680 --> 02:05:51.980
&gt;&gt; Jackie Shieh: Sorry.

02:05:51.980 --> 02:05:53.280
&gt;&gt; Mark Winek: Two
or three questions

02:05:53.280 --> 02:05:54.580
and then we can run into lunch.

02:05:54.580 --> 02:05:56.360 position:56%
So I'll start over there with Chris.

02:05:56.360 --> 02:05:57.660
&gt;&gt; Carla: Hey, Jackie.

02:05:57.660 --> 02:05:59.060
&gt;&gt; Jackie Shieh: Hi, Carla.

02:05:59.060 --> 02:06:03.360
&gt;&gt; Carla: I remember one year ago,
we both talked to a global scholar,

02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:06.110
Dr. Acharya, who is the
founder of the Google Scholar.

02:06:06.110 --> 02:06:07.410 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Jackie Shieh: The Google Scholar.

02:06:07.410 --> 02:06:10.190
&gt;&gt; Carla: Jackie, yeah, we lobby
him to help library to come

02:06:10.190 --> 02:06:15.440
up with more meaningful and
indexing way in the Google Scholar

02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:19.160
so that make library
resource available

02:06:19.160 --> 02:06:21.060
in that [inaudible] platform.

02:06:21.060 --> 02:06:26.370
One thing I remember he mentioned
about is the question of a URI?

02:06:26.370 --> 02:06:27.670
&gt;&gt; Jackie Shieh: Yeah.

02:06:27.670 --> 02:06:28.970
&gt;&gt; Carla: Yeah.

02:06:28.970 --> 02:06:30.780
You mentioned about IRI,

02:06:30.780 --> 02:06:33.380
do you think that did
not answer his question,

02:06:33.380 --> 02:06:40.230
that one day everything would just
go to one unique identifier so that

02:06:40.230 --> 02:06:48.490
like it will not be mixed with,
if our library say subject heading

02:06:48.490 --> 02:06:52.230
on name had a [inaudible]
linked to Wikipedia,

02:06:52.230 --> 02:06:56.290 position:56%
one day they can really talk to each
other with a unique [inaudible].

02:06:56.290 --> 02:06:57.590
Is that possible?

02:06:57.590 --> 02:06:59.610
&gt;&gt; Jackie Shieh: I think right
now you can see that example

02:06:59.610 --> 02:07:06.930
in [inaudible] that is in abrogated
services collecting all the

02:07:06.930 --> 02:07:11.710
identifiers established by
multiple national library services

02:07:11.710 --> 02:07:14.660
for one single entity in one place.

02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:17.830
So how it will essentially
play out is where,

02:07:17.830 --> 02:07:21.450
I think Dorothea mentioned,
you know, we need to figure

02:07:21.450 --> 02:07:25.690
out what would be the
authoritative service

02:07:25.690 --> 02:07:28.870
that we will promote and use.

02:07:28.870 --> 02:07:33.140
Now when I say the world IRI,
I mean that you use a script,

02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:35.300
you notice that the
script was different

02:07:35.300 --> 02:07:40.540
when you were using a
unicode versus non unicode.

02:07:40.540 --> 02:07:43.450
So that's for machine to translate.

02:07:43.450 --> 02:07:46.450
If you were to use IRI
with the same value,

02:07:46.450 --> 02:07:51.510
and the newer system cannot read
IRI, it will translate your,

02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:55.900
the thing within this
environment, the machine,

02:07:55.900 --> 02:07:58.420
we were expecting machine
to work smarter.

02:07:58.420 --> 02:08:00.870
I'm sorry Dorothea.

02:08:00.870 --> 02:08:05.060
We have expectations that a
machine should be usually smarter,

02:08:05.060 --> 02:08:09.990 position:56%
so that it would take our IRI, if
your local system cannot ingest IRI,

02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:11.760
to get it back into the URI

02:08:11.760 --> 02:08:16.170
so you can still get to
where you need to go.

02:08:16.170 --> 02:08:17.470
&gt;&gt; Carla: Okay.

02:08:17.470 --> 02:08:18.920
I just noticed in your record

02:08:18.920 --> 02:08:21.640
in [inaudible] there are
two [inaudible] zero.

02:08:21.640 --> 02:08:27.290
&gt;&gt; Jackie Shieh: In 2013,
we have actually 3, or 4,

02:08:27.290 --> 02:08:30.000
or 5, because we are testing.

02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:31.300
&gt;&gt; Carla: Okay.

02:08:31.300 --> 02:08:32.600
So each of them.

02:08:32.600 --> 02:08:33.900
&gt;&gt; Jackie Shieh: They all the same,

02:08:33.900 --> 02:08:37.350
they all lead to the
same authority data,

02:08:37.350 --> 02:08:39.410
it's just they're formed
differently,

02:08:39.410 --> 02:08:45.490
they are HTTP versus stream,
that using [inaudible]

02:08:45.490 --> 02:08:48.500
and then the alphanumeric
identifier value.

02:08:48.500 --> 02:08:49.800
&gt;&gt; Carla: Okay, get it.

02:08:49.800 --> 02:08:52.130
Last question.

02:08:52.130 --> 02:08:54.380
Okay. I'm sorry.

02:08:54.380 --> 02:08:57.470
Maybe I'll ask you later.

02:08:57.470 --> 02:09:01.290
&gt;&gt; Mark Winek: We have
a question over here.

02:09:04.050 --> 02:09:06.110
&gt;&gt; Hi, Jackie.

02:09:06.110 --> 02:09:07.410
&gt;&gt; Hi.

02:09:07.410 --> 02:09:13.940
&gt;&gt; Hi. Earlier you mentioned that
you had chosen not to add IRI's,

02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:16.900
or at least not through marc
edit, for your e-resources

02:09:16.900 --> 02:09:18.940
because something else
was recommended.

02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:23.890
Could you describe that?

02:09:23.890 --> 02:09:25.190
&gt;&gt; Jackie Shieh: Yes.

02:09:25.190 --> 02:09:29.330
I think because we have such a
composite practices over the years

02:09:29.330 --> 02:09:34.290
for electronic resources and it's
rather difficult, maybe it's easy

02:09:34.290 --> 02:09:38.320
for you, but it was quite difficult
for my team to really figure

02:09:38.320 --> 02:09:45.660
out the, because, okay, back to
the sense are we talking about ICN,

02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:53.050 position:56%
we use ICN, when we are searching
for one ISBN and then we realize oh,

02:09:53.050 --> 02:09:56.240
this is actually the
print ISBN, but we brought

02:09:56.240 --> 02:10:00.330
up the electronic resource
ISB record.

02:10:00.330 --> 02:10:04.180
So then we actually have
multiple records and then we have

02:10:04.180 --> 02:10:07.360
to go deeper to figure it out.

02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:14.700
Is this the right ISBN for
this right e-resources?

02:10:14.700 --> 02:10:18.510 position:56%
So that's why we decided to hold off

02:10:18.510 --> 02:10:23.060
on the electronic resources
through this process.

02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:30.110
However, we were recommended
to use collation manager in WMS

02:10:30.110 --> 02:10:34.960
to set our hold that
our ER team uses

02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:40.070
to set GW's electronic
resources subscriptions.

02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:46.020
But our recent discovery,
and I can share with you

02:10:46.020 --> 02:10:52.120
that our master matcher, Sherry
Chang, is in the audience,

02:10:52.120 --> 02:10:59.720
she uses SQL to query all this
data and let us, you know,

02:10:59.720 --> 02:11:02.790
lead us through this process.

02:11:02.790 --> 02:11:06.920
We usually spend a
month or two looking

02:11:06.920 --> 02:11:09.830
at that data before
we decide what to do.

02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:15.670
So right now we are still
in an investigation process.

02:11:15.670 --> 02:11:18.510
And so what we are doing is

02:11:18.510 --> 02:11:25.290
that we've discovered collation
manager says we have this many

02:11:25.290 --> 02:11:29.820
titles selected of
this many in this set.

02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:35.120
Then we check with [inaudible]
solutions, which we have more,

02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:40.310
then when we request the
marc records to examine

02:11:40.310 --> 02:11:45.970
from OCLC's collation
managers, we actually got less.

02:11:45.970 --> 02:11:52.450 position:56%
So OCLC said we had 311, we
actually get only marc records, 289.

02:11:52.450 --> 02:11:56.260
But in our local system
we already had 396.

02:11:56.260 --> 02:12:00.240
And [inaudible] solutions
say we have 615.

02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:03.360
So they say what do
we actually have?

02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:08.090
So I went to the vendor,
vendor says no, you have 622.

02:12:08.090 --> 02:12:12.600
So I, right now, we are just
pulling our hair trying to deal

02:12:12.600 --> 02:12:14.660
with this electronic resources.

02:12:14.660 --> 02:12:18.760
So I'm so glad that we
forgo electronic resources.

02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:20.930
And when we first did
our recommendation,

02:12:20.930 --> 02:12:23.470
otherwise we wouldn't be
where we are right now,

02:12:23.470 --> 02:12:26.410
and I wouldn't be sharing
with you, so.

02:12:26.410 --> 02:12:30.220
&gt;&gt; Mark Winek: I think we have
time for one more question.

02:12:30.220 --> 02:12:32.970
Is there anyone else?

02:12:40.090 --> 02:12:42.530
&gt;&gt; I wondered if you talked to
any authority vendors, Jackie,

02:12:42.530 --> 02:12:45.110
so that we all don't have
to reinvent the wheel

02:12:45.110 --> 02:12:47.860
and do what you're doing.

02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:49.160
&gt;&gt; Jackie Shieh: You
know, interesting thing,

02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:50.480
I think that they will
be our business.

02:12:50.480 --> 02:12:52.780
I'm sorry.

02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:59.680
No, one of the things that we, a
serendipitous discovery for us,

02:12:59.680 --> 02:13:02.290
Sherry Chang found that and
I didn't even realize it.

02:13:02.290 --> 02:13:08.550
You know when we, GW's
activities all tied in,

02:13:08.550 --> 02:13:11.620
all of our services tied
in with our voyager.

02:13:11.620 --> 02:13:17.890 position:56%
But we are so lean, we, our records,
a lot of our records weren't touched

02:13:17.890 --> 02:13:20.950
for the last 20 years, okay?

02:13:20.950 --> 02:13:26.290
So a lot of our headings are so out
of date, we didn't know what to do

02:13:26.290 --> 02:13:30.060
because we simply don't have
the manpower or we don't have

02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:36.380
that attention span, so to speak,
to tackle this huge problem.

02:13:36.380 --> 02:13:40.450
So I was talking to Terry Reese,
and you know, [inaudible],

02:13:40.450 --> 02:13:43.090
which it's really interesting
I remember

02:13:43.090 --> 02:13:49.680
when I was querying using LWP,
querying Amazon.com servers

02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:54.580 position:56%
for in copyright out of print title.

02:13:54.580 --> 02:14:02.510
So when you query data in SQL, you
can get back not just your 100,

02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:07.560
your authorized heading, you
could get back all the references.

02:14:07.560 --> 02:14:11.630
So what happened is our
heading was old, so when we send

02:14:11.630 --> 02:14:16.490
in for query it actually found in
the not the authorized heading,

02:14:16.490 --> 02:14:21.520
but it got back the authorized
heading to our system.

02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:29.470
So what was brought to my attention
was because we rely on a lot

02:14:29.470 --> 02:14:32.570
of gifts, we have donor
informations,

02:14:32.570 --> 02:14:37.200
and we have to identify
donors, main entry as donor,

02:14:37.200 --> 02:14:41.650
and so when we're doing this second
phase of our reclamation project,

02:14:41.650 --> 02:14:48.160
it was too hard to insert back the
field saying so and so is a donor.

02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:51.690
Okay? So we recognize
this particular donor

02:14:51.690 --> 02:14:53.970
and his name was different.

02:14:53.970 --> 02:14:57.310
So how, we said to ourselves how
in the world did this happen?

02:14:57.310 --> 02:15:00.070
We didn't make any
changes on his heading.

02:15:00.070 --> 02:15:04.670
His name came out with a JR,
the other one was just his name

02:15:04.670 --> 02:15:10.010
and his year, but now he's JR,
yes indeed, inserted in between.

02:15:10.010 --> 02:15:14.280
And so we was like, let's
see what else happened here.

02:15:14.280 --> 02:15:16.280
So that was our experience.

02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:20.850
Now we never talked to authority
vendors because we are not

02:15:20.850 --> 02:15:25.250
in a position to talk to, you know,
authority vendors for our process.

02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:30.170
So a lot of this process is, you
know, we're still in testing mode.

02:15:30.170 --> 02:15:32.940
We do not know what
the future holds.

02:15:32.940 --> 02:15:36.400
We just know that let's give
it a go and see where we are.

02:15:36.400 --> 02:15:38.980
And if this is total disastrous,

02:15:38.980 --> 02:15:41.660
fortunately it was
okay with our AUL.

02:15:41.660 --> 02:15:44.630
That was the thing.

02:15:44.630 --> 02:15:53.920
Our AUL okay it and we, before
we actually started on July 26,

02:15:53.920 --> 02:15:57.980
we actually froze our,
we have a snapshot

02:15:57.980 --> 02:16:03.650
of our voyager data
cut off at July 25.

02:16:03.650 --> 02:16:09.890
So if we broke the
system, we can rebuild it.

02:16:09.890 --> 02:16:11.970
We have a safety net.

02:16:11.970 --> 02:16:17.270
So fortunately, we
didn't need to do that.

02:16:17.270 --> 02:16:21.060
&gt;&gt; Mark Winek: And so our final
speaker for today is Linda Wen,

02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:23.680
who joins us from the
Washington College of Law

02:16:23.680 --> 02:16:26.910
at American University where
she is the head of collections

02:16:26.910 --> 02:16:29.630
and bibliographic services.

02:16:29.630 --> 02:16:33.490
Her previous professional
experiences includes a term

02:16:33.490 --> 02:16:37.430 position:56%
as the head of IT at the
University of Arkansas, Little Rock,

02:16:37.430 --> 02:16:40.890 position:56%
she has significant research
experience in e-resources meta data,

02:16:40.890 --> 02:16:45.370
technical services work flows
and integrated library systems.

02:16:45.370 --> 02:16:47.670
And welcome, Linda.

02:17:44.820 --> 02:17:48.170 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Linda Wen: Okay, can you hear me?

02:17:48.170 --> 02:17:49.470
Good. Okay.

02:17:49.470 --> 02:17:51.150
Let's get started and
get it over with.

02:17:51.150 --> 02:17:57.520
I have been quite nervous
all this morning.

02:17:57.520 --> 02:18:05.010 position:56%
And the beauty about the last
speaker is I don't have much to add.

02:18:05.010 --> 02:18:11.180
A lot of this has already been
covered already this morning,

02:18:11.180 --> 02:18:14.940
so I'll be fast.

02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:18.290
Again, my name is Linda
Wen, I'm sorry about my,

02:18:18.290 --> 02:18:23.860
on the speaker description,
I did not mention that I'm

02:18:23.860 --> 02:18:28.410
from Washington College of
Law, American University.

02:18:31.070 --> 02:18:34.910
Okay, we will talked
about linked data today.

02:18:40.510 --> 02:18:43.890
Linked data is net worth

02:18:43.890 --> 02:18:52.060
of RDF statement expressed using
published end of vocabulary,

02:18:52.060 --> 02:18:57.380
which is usually referred
to as triple,

02:18:57.380 --> 02:19:02.360
consists of a subject,
predicate and object.

02:19:02.360 --> 02:19:07.020
Or, in other words,
entity, the property

02:19:07.020 --> 02:19:11.670
and the relationship
and the property value.

02:19:11.670 --> 02:19:25.030
And so, we have a triple statement
like a person is the author

02:19:25.030 --> 02:19:31.880
of the work, or the work is
a genre of science fiction,

02:19:32.900 --> 02:19:41.410
and when we talked about linked
data, we talked about the URI's

02:19:42.510 --> 02:19:49.650
and the subject, predicate and
the object usually are resolved,

02:19:49.650 --> 02:20:00.060 position:56%
are identified by a URI and resolved
to authoritative vocabulary.

02:20:01.900 --> 02:20:08.650
And all these entities and
triples can be interconnected

02:20:08.650 --> 02:20:10.240
with each other.

02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:18.350 position:56%
And so every entity will have for, a
bunch of properties circled around,

02:20:18.350 --> 02:20:22.880
and then we will have
an entity graph.

02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:26.100
So it looks like this.

02:20:26.100 --> 02:20:36.900
So for a computer, it doesn't know
what a Mona Lisa is, just a stream.

02:20:36.900 --> 02:20:44.630
But with all the ID's around
property relationships around it,

02:20:44.630 --> 02:20:52.350
this name got a, becomes a thing,
a life, so the computer's got

02:20:52.350 --> 02:20:54.900
to know what it is about.

02:21:03.330 --> 02:21:12.030
So the stream becomes a thing,
for the com, for the computers,

02:21:12.030 --> 02:21:16.240
the things will have
a URI which point

02:21:16.240 --> 02:21:20.830
to an authoritative vocabulary.

02:21:20.830 --> 02:21:27.330
So this kind of resembles what we
librarians do as authority control,

02:21:27.330 --> 02:21:37.640 position:56%
except that the authority vocabulary
is all of, identified by URI's.

02:21:37.640 --> 02:21:43.580
So the libraries have
been doing, been busy,

02:21:43.580 --> 02:21:51.310
doing identifying its entities
with all the properties around

02:21:51.310 --> 02:21:55.730
and they interlinked to each other.

02:21:55.730 --> 02:22:01.970
So we will have for this graphs,
connected with each other.

02:22:05.280 --> 02:22:11.600
And we will have this
ideally, all this world,

02:22:11.600 --> 02:22:17.120
when the authoritative vocabulary
hubs connected to each other,

02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:21.610
we will have this famous
linked data cloud.

02:22:21.610 --> 02:22:25.940
And we can take a look.

02:22:54.310 --> 02:23:03.320
So this is the site of this open
linked cloud, and if I click

02:23:04.770 --> 02:23:08.970
on it, I can see the details.

02:23:14.040 --> 02:23:21.500
And I want to take a look at the,
what the library's been doing.

02:23:26.630 --> 02:23:30.960
We'll see the center of
the cloud is DBPedia.

02:23:30.960 --> 02:23:40.990
And we will see some very
famous names among the library

02:23:40.990 --> 02:23:44.980
and the publisher community.

02:23:44.980 --> 02:23:47.220
Let's see.

02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:50.930
I think it's better this way.

02:23:50.930 --> 02:23:59.810
Okay, the green part,
the green section is of,

02:23:59.810 --> 02:24:07.470
the green section consists of the
hubs contributed by the library

02:24:07.470 --> 02:24:09.960
and publisher communities.

02:24:09.960 --> 02:24:14.580
That takes about, let's
see, 20% of the cloud.

02:24:14.580 --> 02:24:17.880
So that's where we are now.

02:24:38.140 --> 02:24:45.520 position:56%
And outside the library community
there are some example famous linked

02:24:45.520 --> 02:24:54.840
data players, and, well,
Google Knowledge Card.

02:24:54.840 --> 02:25:01.440
I do a search, To Kill a
Mockingbird, and we will see a list

02:25:01.440 --> 02:25:05.790
on the left of the
links to the documents.

02:25:05.790 --> 02:25:11.600
And the right hand side
is more of a graph,

02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:19.150
or more of an entity relationship.

02:25:19.150 --> 02:25:27.970
And the Google already answered
some of the user's questions.

02:25:27.970 --> 02:25:37.950
And that's also tells us
about, that even Google is goes

02:25:37.950 --> 02:25:42.560
through these coexist path.

02:25:42.560 --> 02:25:47.620
On one side is the traditional
and on the other side is trying

02:25:47.620 --> 02:25:50.550
to do the linked data model.

02:25:50.550 --> 02:25:59.890
And a big player of this Google
Knowledge Graph is Wikipedia.

02:26:08.070 --> 02:26:10.970
Okay. We will see that later.

02:26:17.630 --> 02:26:28.750 position:56%
And if I do our Wikipedia search,
we, one thing I want to point out is

02:26:28.750 --> 02:26:32.960
that we have this link to OCLC.

02:26:42.120 --> 02:26:46.460
I mean, link to the
OCLC record, right here.

02:26:50.120 --> 02:26:56.010
And towards the end of
the linked data listed

02:26:56.010 --> 02:27:01.870
that OCLC already published it.

02:27:01.870 --> 02:27:08.460
So every OCLC record, whatever
search you do, you will,

02:27:08.460 --> 02:27:16.480
towards the end, the linked
data and we will, at this page,

02:27:16.480 --> 02:27:24.760
we'll see that we have this
predicate and objects listed

02:27:24.760 --> 02:27:30.090
and some of the authoritative
hub names listed.

02:27:30.090 --> 02:27:32.970
For example, schema.

02:27:41.600 --> 02:27:47.870
Okay, and another example I
want to talk about is BBC.

02:28:02.040 --> 02:28:07.690
BBC has already publishing
it's vocabulary on ontology

02:28:07.690 --> 02:28:12.560
and also populated
all their websites.

02:28:12.560 --> 02:28:17.530
And this played a big role
during the Olympic Games.

02:28:17.530 --> 02:28:26.560
And so every athlete, every team,
has its own website generated

02:28:26.560 --> 02:28:33.340
with all the dynamic games
and statistics listed.

02:28:33.340 --> 02:28:47.780
And we can take a look at the
mapping of the ontology of the BBC.

02:28:47.780 --> 02:28:53.300
And on the top in the prefix,
we see some of the big names

02:28:53.300 --> 02:28:56.560
of the authoritative ontology.

02:29:08.270 --> 02:29:17.440
And towards, in the middle, I
want to show everybody is the,

02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:22.160
take a look at the
core concept ontology.

02:29:22.160 --> 02:29:34.770
And there is a graph of how
the structure of the BBC site.

02:29:34.770 --> 02:29:39.150
And on the right you see the
entities, person, place, events,

02:29:39.150 --> 02:29:42.050
organizations and things.

02:29:42.050 --> 02:29:47.540
Some of these overlap with what
we're talking about in the library.

02:29:53.470 --> 02:29:56.090
So, okay, and we, this morning,

02:29:56.090 --> 02:30:03.170
talking about that linked data
graphs, and the change the data

02:30:03.170 --> 02:30:10.440
from like, for example,
the graph on the left is

02:30:10.440 --> 02:30:17.770
like resemble what we have as a
record, and on the right hand,

02:30:17.770 --> 02:30:23.680
with all the URI's, so the
record as become puzzle pieces.

02:30:23.680 --> 02:30:29.450
The puzzle pieces can then
reconnect with other puzzle pieces

02:30:29.450 --> 02:30:40.570 position:56%
and become other websites or another
group of knowledge communities.

02:30:40.570 --> 02:30:50.140
So that gives us a bunch
of benefits of linked data.

02:30:50.140 --> 02:30:55.340
It's easier to get updated.

02:30:55.340 --> 02:31:02.230
And less human errors
in dynamic updating.

02:31:02.230 --> 02:31:09.890
And also less maybe
application cost.

02:31:20.160 --> 02:31:22.760
I listed here some
of the early players

02:31:22.760 --> 02:31:26.970
of the linked data vocabulary.

02:31:26.970 --> 02:31:34.320 position:56%
And if you take a look at any of the
linked data example, record example,

02:31:34.320 --> 02:31:40.120
you'll see these links,
you'll see these names.

02:31:40.120 --> 02:31:47.250
And this BibFrame vocabulary
is all what we know,

02:31:47.250 --> 02:31:49.610
what are we most familiar with.

02:31:49.610 --> 02:31:53.730
And let's take a look
at that category view,

02:31:53.730 --> 02:31:56.860
which is more for the catalogers.

02:31:56.860 --> 02:32:07.060
And probably you will find like
a journal title being absorbed

02:32:07.060 --> 02:32:13.010
by another journal title, such
kind of properties in Library

02:32:13.010 --> 02:32:17.250
of Congress BibFrame
initiative, right?

02:32:17.250 --> 02:32:21.970
Welcome cataloger librarians
feedback.

02:32:37.140 --> 02:32:41.710
I think, by now, probably,
everybody has seen this image.

02:32:41.710 --> 02:32:45.810
It's talking about the,
how to prepare the data.

02:32:45.810 --> 02:32:49.410
And is your data 5 star?

02:32:49.410 --> 02:32:54.490
Which means is your
data out in the web?

02:32:54.490 --> 02:32:59.450
And is your data machine
process-able?

02:32:59.450 --> 02:33:08.670 position:56%
For example, if it's an image of PDF
file, it's not machine process-able,

02:33:08.670 --> 02:33:13.520
it's better in the CSV file.

02:33:13.520 --> 02:33:21.690
And your data, is it
confined in your IOS rather

02:33:21.690 --> 02:33:25.250
than with all the links
which can be queried,

02:33:25.250 --> 02:33:29.400
but outside of the
library community?

02:33:32.750 --> 02:33:39.740
So library and data entities,
this image is from OCLC,

02:33:39.740 --> 02:33:44.550
so OCLC's job is focus
on the key entities

02:33:44.550 --> 02:33:49.930
for some place organization
concept work and events.

02:33:54.150 --> 02:34:02.450
And take a look at the data,
what we have in the library,

02:34:02.450 --> 02:34:11.610
I think we can categorize
them into these four groups

02:34:11.610 --> 02:34:16.670
in library authority
files, labeled names

02:34:16.670 --> 02:34:22.490
and half structured
and unstructured text.

02:34:22.490 --> 02:34:29.310
As I mentioned before
that with URI's,

02:34:29.310 --> 02:34:34.870
data with URI's resulted
to vocabulary.

02:34:34.870 --> 02:34:37.570
The process, or the concept,

02:34:37.570 --> 02:34:44.640
resemble what we have been
doing, so authority control.

02:34:51.430 --> 02:34:56.470
So the focus, or the center
of the easy part is the,

02:34:56.470 --> 02:35:00.180
of all those four categories,

02:35:00.180 --> 02:35:10.680
the authority file probably is
the concentration of our work,

02:35:10.680 --> 02:35:17.610
because it already have these
links to authority control records.

02:35:17.610 --> 02:35:24.590
So I would like to talk
about several examples.

02:35:24.590 --> 02:35:35.380
So on the top inside one authority
record we are familiar with,

02:35:35.380 --> 02:35:39.460
was the one 010 field.

02:35:39.460 --> 02:35:48.710
This is both Library of Congress
and OCLC, being using this set

02:35:48.710 --> 02:35:52.580
like ISBN numbers, LCCN numbers,

02:35:52.580 --> 02:35:58.500
this already been transferred
to be URI's.

02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:03.240
And what about the rest of this?

02:36:03.240 --> 02:36:14.710
For example, 150 is put in the 650
Bib Record and so it has a link.

02:36:14.710 --> 02:36:24.220
If we can, if we can apply
and identify to the 150,

02:36:24.220 --> 02:36:35.710
then the 450's unauthorized
terms, and 550's is easier

02:36:35.710 --> 02:36:41.830
because with the subfield of
WG, we can use the [inaudible]

02:36:41.830 --> 02:36:50.860
or S K O S broader
property to identify those.

02:36:50.860 --> 02:36:58.730
So this is, for the concept or
subject headings, this resembles,

02:36:58.730 --> 02:37:09.620
we can deal with those authority
records and make them URI's.

02:37:09.620 --> 02:37:20.560
But what about the names,
person, authority records?

02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:25.740
I have one example
for Stephen King here.

02:37:25.740 --> 02:37:38.710
Take a look at the bottom
in SKOS, S K O S URI.

02:37:38.710 --> 02:37:48.460
And the first, it identifies
as a person name as concept.

02:37:48.460 --> 02:38:01.220 position:56%
And for other languages, translation
of the name, it gives a old label,

02:38:01.220 --> 02:38:06.540
an [inaudible] also for pen names.

02:38:06.540 --> 02:38:16.480
So in authority record,
where it says the URI,

02:38:16.480 --> 02:38:25.490
the URI doesn't tell the
main label that the rest

02:38:25.490 --> 02:38:32.290
of them are actually
property of the person.

02:38:32.290 --> 02:38:37.710
So it's different from
the subject headings.

02:38:37.710 --> 02:38:46.710
And I think OCLC has been
thinking about this, so it's trying

02:38:46.710 --> 02:38:57.180 position:56%
to use a friend of a friend standard
to deal with this kind of problems.

02:38:57.180 --> 02:39:06.260
So at the, still at the bottom, you
see in friend of a friend standard,

02:39:06.260 --> 02:39:16.820
a person's name is in the person
label, and then the rest of them,

02:39:16.820 --> 02:39:23.090
including the pen name, other
version, or other language

02:39:23.090 --> 02:39:25.970
of the name, as the properties.

02:39:31.350 --> 02:39:37.150
Other libraries, their big
library communities have been busy

02:39:37.150 --> 02:39:41.870
converting the library
data to linked data.

02:39:41.870 --> 02:39:48.970
And we, let's take a look
at the British National.

02:40:05.250 --> 02:40:12.260
Okay, so here, we list the
some examples what you can do

02:40:12.260 --> 02:40:13.940
with the linked data.

02:40:13.940 --> 02:40:19.810
Take a look at the sample
queries so the population

02:40:19.810 --> 02:40:23.160
of possibilities is endless.

02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:36.610
So if I'm interested in
the 50 other born in 1945,

02:40:37.630 --> 02:40:44.290
or I can put my own
labels, own query codes

02:40:44.290 --> 02:40:48.810
down here, and I will have

02:40:53.040 --> 02:41:01.380
the result here, a list of
all others born in that year.

02:41:01.380 --> 02:41:04.450
And because the born year
and the author's name

02:41:04.450 --> 02:41:10.220
and all the author's
works, they all different,

02:41:10.220 --> 02:41:13.740
they become different
identities, puzzle pieces.

02:41:13.740 --> 02:41:20.800
So I can sample them and
package them as different result.

02:41:29.580 --> 02:41:36.330
And one thing I want to mention
about Oslo Public Library is

02:41:36.330 --> 02:41:42.440
that library's already dropped
marc, so if you're interested,

02:41:42.440 --> 02:41:47.560
take a look at their catalog
and see how they're doing.

02:41:47.560 --> 02:41:50.750
And also, you can query their data.

02:41:56.040 --> 02:42:00.850
Whoa, we are having this com
meeting in the Library of Congress,

02:42:00.850 --> 02:42:04.970
so we are all very
familiar with this BibFrame.

02:42:09.230 --> 02:42:19.390
BibFrame, I've been
thinking about this BibFrame,

02:42:19.390 --> 02:42:29.650 position:56%
the BibFrame divide the records up
and so they like, so the BibFrame is

02:42:29.650 --> 02:42:37.100
like giving you all this bucket
for the different fields.

02:42:37.100 --> 02:42:41.450
So for the work entity,

02:42:41.450 --> 02:42:51.670
I am thinking that these records
can belong to that bucket.

02:42:51.670 --> 02:42:55.970
And for instances

02:43:03.870 --> 02:43:12.910
and library holdings, last
slide, the annotations.

02:43:12.910 --> 02:43:21.500 position:56%
And all these, when these are become
divided and put in those buckets,

02:43:21.500 --> 02:43:28.030
and all these can then also be
resigned, be assigned [inaudible]

02:43:28.030 --> 02:43:33.970
and then linked to other entities.

02:43:59.490 --> 02:44:04.700
I think that's the record that we
was just talking, we just talked.

02:44:04.700 --> 02:44:12.670
And here's a little tool, that
if you want to get your feet wet,

02:44:12.670 --> 02:44:23.040 position:56%
you can compare a marc record into
the total expression of linked data.

02:44:23.040 --> 02:44:26.890
So for,

02:44:30.670 --> 02:44:36.960
it's quite easy to use, so just
use, need to use the Library

02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:40.970
of Congress record number.

02:44:44.380 --> 02:44:50.840
It's not the regular
001 record number.

02:44:57.890 --> 02:45:05.950
So we talk about this, the tool
to compare, and also you can,

02:45:05.950 --> 02:45:10.590
you have marc two in the
BibFrame transformation service,

02:45:10.590 --> 02:45:16.480
marc frame editor, maybe let's
take a brief look at the editor.

02:45:16.480 --> 02:45:21.340
Here's a demonstration site.

02:45:21.340 --> 02:45:28.790
So you don't even have to register
and you can just play with it.

02:45:28.790 --> 02:45:39.390
Okay, so, so say I have a copy of
some work or a copy of an instance

02:45:39.390 --> 02:45:45.400
of a work and I can just,
this is like copy cataloging,

02:45:45.400 --> 02:45:51.610
and if I'm looking for,
say c level rising,

02:45:57.080 --> 02:46:04.120
it will give you a list of all
the records which already have

02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:07.080
at the Library of Congress.

02:46:07.080 --> 02:46:12.870
It's just not working today.

02:46:12.870 --> 02:46:17.180
And I'm experiencing it and I would

02:46:17.180 --> 02:46:23.970
like this left encode instead
of this keyword search.

02:46:30.410 --> 02:46:33.890
So, let's see.

02:46:40.290 --> 02:46:44.970
It's not working.

02:46:44.970 --> 02:46:48.790
So when you're done you
can download the record,

02:46:48.790 --> 02:46:53.650
take a look, so let's see.

02:46:59.540 --> 02:47:06.850
And at the bottom of that list
is marc next, which is the,

02:47:06.850 --> 02:47:08.750
Jackie talked about this morning.

02:47:08.750 --> 02:47:11.890
It's the new function in marc edit.

02:47:15.440 --> 02:47:21.620
And this look quite familiar, and I
can demonstrate it on my computer,

02:47:21.620 --> 02:47:24.850
or I have several slides.

02:47:24.850 --> 02:47:33.750
So if I click on that marc next,
I have this list of tools there.

02:47:37.590 --> 02:47:48.680
I'll first talk about the testbed,
and it, I used it to test it out.

02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:55.210
And for example, I, oops,
I was interested in how

02:47:55.210 --> 02:48:06.330
that c level rising book, it looks
like as a, in BibFrame format,

02:48:06.330 --> 02:48:11.360
so I download that record
and I click on this testbed,

02:48:11.360 --> 02:48:19.050
and I can specify the
base URL as either local

02:48:19.050 --> 02:48:25.810
or as other authoritative
ontology URL there.

02:48:25.810 --> 02:48:33.620
And then if I press it, it
says file has been processed.

02:48:33.620 --> 02:48:35.610
It's quite straightforward.

02:48:35.610 --> 02:48:42.060
When I open it up I have
this marc record confirmed,

02:48:42.060 --> 02:48:46.610
transformed to this new format.

02:48:51.090 --> 02:49:00.790
Okay. So link identifier,
this is a very handy tool

02:49:00.790 --> 02:49:04.530
that you can already be doing.

02:49:04.530 --> 02:49:10.850
You can insert embed this
in the regular work flow

02:49:10.850 --> 02:49:15.180
like Jackie talked
about this morning.

02:49:15.180 --> 02:49:26.510
Say, also you have a
marc record and you want

02:49:26.510 --> 02:49:33.270
to insert all the sub field zeroes
from different sources, they,

02:49:33.270 --> 02:49:40.550
right now they have this
Library of Congress [inaudible],

02:49:40.550 --> 02:49:46.620
and the pull down list is very
long, and I don't think every one

02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:53.700
of them are working now, but these
four listed here are working.

02:49:53.700 --> 02:49:58.240
So depending which one you trust.

02:50:00.410 --> 02:50:06.740
So after I process it, the
sub field zeros inserted.

02:50:06.740 --> 02:50:14.070
So if you also want to do
Jackie's project in your library,

02:50:14.070 --> 02:50:18.280
you can try using the marc next,

02:50:18.280 --> 02:50:22.370
it's quite straightforward,
just 1, 2, 3 steps.

02:50:22.370 --> 02:50:28.060
And this is the original
field, so for the marc record,

02:50:28.060 --> 02:50:35.950 position:56%
so by comparison you see the sub
field zeroes inserted automatically.

02:50:35.950 --> 02:50:44.620
Okay. As I said [inaudible]
I'm a learning cataloger,

02:50:44.620 --> 02:50:49.830
so I want to get my feet
wet, half wet maybe,

02:50:49.830 --> 02:50:58.330
so I would like to recommend one
tour, it's a very important tour.

02:50:58.330 --> 02:51:07.050
Sebago [assumed spelling], it's
like SQL to regular database.

02:51:07.050 --> 02:51:09.860
Sebago is to link the data.

02:51:14.150 --> 02:51:21.420
So Sebago carries across
databases and pulls structured

02:51:21.420 --> 02:51:28.640
or semi structured data
and has even explored data

02:51:28.640 --> 02:51:35.410
by carrying unknown relationships
and transformed RDF data

02:51:35.410 --> 02:51:38.100
from one vocabulary to another.

02:51:38.100 --> 02:51:42.350
So ti has all the good
functions that,

02:51:42.350 --> 02:51:45.590
it's like it's designed
for link data.

02:51:52.230 --> 02:51:57.400
So this is a DBP data site.

02:51:57.400 --> 02:52:05.540
And everybody can go
there and carry DBP data,

02:52:05.540 --> 02:52:10.620
which is the structured
data version of Wikipedia.

02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:17.330
You can carry whatever
triples they have there.

02:52:17.330 --> 02:52:19.120
Maybe let's try one.

02:52:19.120 --> 02:52:23.720
Let's see.

02:52:23.720 --> 02:52:32.510
So I'm trying to, let's see, I
want to know Library of Congress,

02:52:32.510 --> 02:52:36.900
all the predicates and the objects.

02:52:36.900 --> 02:52:43.500
Of course, I'll limit to say
100, otherwise it's endless.

02:52:43.500 --> 02:52:46.970
So let's take a look.

02:52:51.600 --> 02:52:53.900
Oh, right here.

02:53:56.220 --> 02:54:01.030
Okay. So when I, because Library
of Congress is in Wikipedia,

02:54:01.030 --> 02:54:04.690
so I can carry what's
all about Library

02:54:04.690 --> 02:54:07.520
of Congress behind the scene.

02:54:07.520 --> 02:54:09.200
So I come here to the DBPedia
site and I put the writing a line

02:54:09.200 --> 02:54:11.300
of code, of very simple code, and I
got 100 pieces of statement there.

02:54:11.300 --> 02:54:12.600
And as we mentioned before,

02:54:12.600 --> 02:54:13.900
like because all the linked data
can be recombined and packaged.

02:54:13.900 --> 02:54:15.200
So the possibility's endless,
so you can query whatever.

02:54:15.200 --> 02:54:16.500
And let's see.

02:54:16.500 --> 02:54:18.800
Say, say I'm on Wikipedia and
maybe I'm interested in that.

02:54:24.070 --> 02:54:26.970
Let's see, I can.

02:54:40.140 --> 02:54:43.210
Copy this.

02:54:43.210 --> 02:54:48.530
They have been using this in the
URL, that piece of information,

02:54:48.530 --> 02:54:52.620
they have been using
that as a URI actually.

02:54:52.620 --> 02:55:06.450
So, let me try to replace
Library of Congress and try that.

02:55:07.550 --> 02:55:10.970
Oops. See what I get.

02:55:27.430 --> 02:55:31.330
[Inaudible] got the
information of this,

02:55:31.330 --> 02:55:35.420
and so for use, just to come out.

02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:54.560
Okay, so probably instead
of you asking me questions,

02:55:54.560 --> 02:55:56.860
I would like to ask you questions.

02:55:56.860 --> 02:55:59.470
That's easier.

02:55:59.470 --> 02:56:06.530
So I'll be talking, thinking about
the future descriptive practice,

02:56:06.530 --> 02:56:11.630
or future cataloging work flow.

02:56:11.630 --> 02:56:18.660
So it will very much different.

02:56:18.660 --> 02:56:27.400
For example, the crowd
sourcing, because a lot we have

02:56:27.400 --> 02:56:32.950
for these library experience
like working in the library,

02:56:32.950 --> 02:56:41.230
we have all this expertise, and
compared to the level of cataloging

02:56:41.230 --> 02:56:49.700
with marc, we would think how
detailed the link data will be.

02:56:49.700 --> 02:56:56.670
So maybe take the coexisting
dual path,

02:56:56.670 --> 02:57:03.520
maybe using the follow what
the big names or COC Library

02:57:03.520 --> 02:57:11.990
of Congress have been doing, and
also we, as individual librarians,

02:57:11.990 --> 02:57:21.210
we contribute to proud sourcing the
description of the most prominent,

02:57:21.210 --> 02:57:25.580
actually, the library
resources consist

02:57:25.580 --> 02:57:29.830
of the most prominent
creative work in the world.

02:57:29.830 --> 02:57:38.480
See, an example is we have
New York Public Libraries.

02:57:38.480 --> 02:57:43.050
They have this jazz,
link to jazz project,

02:57:43.050 --> 02:57:51.200
so and crowd sourcing using
all regular people and users

02:57:51.200 --> 02:57:58.600
and the librarians labeling
all the pieces, jazz pieces,

02:57:58.600 --> 02:58:03.250
so that the system or
the computer can query

02:58:03.250 --> 02:58:09.970
and it can assign URI's
to those information.

02:58:18.200 --> 02:58:26.560
Thinking of the next day, or
future, there are more questions,

02:58:26.560 --> 02:58:30.780
like digital or published
information,

02:58:30.780 --> 02:58:35.500
what do we do with that?

02:58:35.500 --> 02:58:43.190
And it's like, it's things, for
example, OCLC, we take a look

02:58:43.190 --> 02:58:49.320
at the end of every record, there
is a category as linked data,

02:58:49.320 --> 02:58:53.280
and you will see schema.org.

02:58:53.280 --> 02:59:02.360
So we kind of depending
on other authoritative hub

02:59:02.360 --> 02:59:07.960
from other communities who
is like a social contract

02:59:07.960 --> 02:59:15.700
that how much we can trust them.

02:59:15.700 --> 02:59:19.600
So that's about what I have to say.

02:59:19.600 --> 02:59:21.900
Thank you.

02:59:28.170 --> 02:59:30.210
&gt;&gt; Mark Winek: Thank
you, very much, Linda.

02:59:30.210 --> 02:59:34.210
Before we start our question and
answer period, we just wanted

02:59:34.210 --> 02:59:36.850
to note that you still have
an opportunity to vote.

02:59:36.850 --> 02:59:40.400 position:56%
We noticed that there was a
discrepancy in the number of ballots

02:59:40.400 --> 02:59:44.010
versus the number of registrants.

02:59:44.010 --> 02:59:49.050
So you still have an opportunity to
vote until we announce the results,

02:59:49.050 --> 02:59:54.580
so if you need a ballot or if you
have not submitted your ballot,

02:59:54.580 --> 02:59:56.660
please raise your hand
and someone will come

02:59:56.660 --> 02:59:59.740
around to you and pick that up.

03:00:05.040 --> 03:00:10.890
This isn't Chicago, so no voting
early and often, just early.

03:00:14.490 --> 03:00:17.300
So, I'd like to open the floor

03:00:17.300 --> 03:00:21.650
if Linda will accept
questions from the audience.

03:00:21.650 --> 03:00:23.950
Please just raise your hand.

03:00:36.890 --> 03:00:38.190
&gt;&gt; Kim Kiley: Hello, Linda.

03:00:38.190 --> 03:00:39.490
&gt;&gt; Linda Wen: Hi.

03:00:39.490 --> 03:00:40.790
&gt;&gt; Kim Kiley: Kim Kiley.

03:00:40.790 --> 03:00:42.450
I'm from the Library of the
United States Supreme Court.

03:00:42.450 --> 03:00:47.280 position:56%
And I was just wondering if you
think that there are any particular,

03:00:47.280 --> 03:00:50.970
or special challenges,
in law librarianship

03:00:50.970 --> 03:00:54.240
when we think about linked data?

03:00:54.240 --> 03:00:56.260
&gt;&gt; Linda Wen: About
law librarianship.

03:00:56.260 --> 03:00:58.910
Very good question.

03:00:58.910 --> 03:01:02.180
As I said, I'm a learning
cataloger and I am kind

03:01:02.180 --> 03:01:04.300
of new in the law library.

03:01:04.300 --> 03:01:13.790
So for the law libraries,
law libraries is a very heavy

03:01:13.790 --> 03:01:20.010
with periodicals, with
all the, like embargo,

03:01:20.010 --> 03:01:23.710
embargo period, and name changes.

03:01:23.710 --> 03:01:27.790
I think that it will
be very challenging.

03:01:27.790 --> 03:01:34.380
And also, the periodicals goes to
electronic formats more and more.

03:01:34.380 --> 03:01:37.700
And moreso, we talking
about the ISBN,

03:01:37.700 --> 03:01:43.550
EISBN numbers and all
the challenges.

03:01:45.000 --> 03:01:51.770
From subject heading point of
view, I don't have much to say,

03:01:51.770 --> 03:01:59.910
but from the, maybe from the
system or technology point of view,

03:01:59.910 --> 03:02:05.810
I would like to say I trust
the ability of the technology.

03:02:05.810 --> 03:02:15.430
For example, the BibFrame and
other old and ontology categories

03:02:15.430 --> 03:02:21.720 position:56%
out of there, they property or their
relationship like is author of,

03:02:21.720 --> 03:02:27.690
resolve by, all the properties are
expanding, dramatically expanding,

03:02:27.690 --> 03:02:32.900
and we, us librarians can
contribute our point of view

03:02:32.900 --> 03:02:36.740
to take care of those details.

03:02:36.740 --> 03:02:41.750
So I would like to say
I trust the technology.

03:02:41.750 --> 03:02:44.050
&gt;&gt; Kim Kiley: Thank you.

03:02:50.040 --> 03:02:53.470
&gt;&gt; Mark Winek: Does anyone
have any other questions?

03:02:56.620 --> 03:03:02.990
&gt;&gt; Yes. You said something about
what new skills catalogers need

03:03:02.990 --> 03:03:06.430
in the new environment, but
you only touched on Sparkles.

03:03:06.430 --> 03:03:09.810
So can you elaborate
on the other skills?

03:03:09.810 --> 03:03:15.150
&gt;&gt; Linda Wen: The reason
I listed just the one is

03:03:15.150 --> 03:03:18.250
so that we are not all overwhelmed.

03:03:18.250 --> 03:03:21.770
I just feel, I highly
recommend the Sparkle

03:03:21.770 --> 03:03:26.720
because of all the
functions that Sparkle offers.

03:03:26.720 --> 03:03:33.230
It can query the, in
triples, and across the,

03:03:33.230 --> 03:03:35.990
across different modules.

03:03:35.990 --> 03:03:45.960
So for other skills, I think XML,

03:03:51.860 --> 03:03:57.030
yeah, I think that's about,
from my point of view.

03:03:57.030 --> 03:03:58.930
Scripting language.

03:03:58.930 --> 03:04:08.490
And at the conferences I heard
people who create applications

03:04:08.490 --> 03:04:12.040
or tools, they all
mentioned that they want

03:04:12.040 --> 03:04:19.770
to attract more people
creating tools.

03:04:19.770 --> 03:04:27.170 position:56%
So we are, in the library
community, we are lack of for tools,

03:04:27.170 --> 03:04:30.020
a lack of people who
are creating tools.

03:04:30.020 --> 03:04:39.080
For example, for example if I
go to BibFrame testbed editor,

03:04:39.080 --> 03:04:46.680
and I want to look for the subject
headings, and I have this list

03:04:46.680 --> 03:04:51.620
of headers, what if I want
other authoritative hubs,

03:04:51.620 --> 03:04:58.880 position:56%
I want to query the other
authoritative sources, what do I do?

03:04:58.880 --> 03:05:06.620
Does that, that can be a project
or can be, people can create tools

03:05:06.620 --> 03:05:14.170
and embed there so it will connect
to other communities or other group

03:05:14.170 --> 03:05:20.930
or hubs for authoritative
vocabulary.

03:05:28.430 --> 03:05:31.610
&gt;&gt; Mark Winek: Any other questions?

03:05:31.610 --> 03:05:33.950
Thank you all, and thank
you so very much, Linda.

03:05:33.950 --> 03:05:36.250
&gt;&gt; Linda Wen: Thank you.

03:05:59.630 --> 03:06:01.050
&gt;&gt; Mark Winek: So thank
you very much.

03:06:01.050 --> 03:06:04.330
And thanks to all of
our speakers today.

03:06:04.330 --> 03:06:08.180
And now a tradition, at
the PTPL Annual Meeting,

03:06:08.180 --> 03:06:12.020
and for her last duty on
the PTPL advisory board,

03:06:12.020 --> 03:06:14.850
I would like to present
you with Linda Geisler,

03:06:14.850 --> 03:06:18.820
who will present the
Historical Moment.

03:06:22.120 --> 03:06:23.420
&gt;&gt; Linda Geisler: Hi.

03:06:23.420 --> 03:06:25.230
As Mark announced, this
will be my last duty,

03:06:25.230 --> 03:06:27.370
I guess, I perform, for a PTPL.

03:06:27.370 --> 03:06:30.800
So we're coming to the
end of the 91st meeting

03:06:30.800 --> 03:06:33.630
of the Potomac Technical
Processing Librarians.

03:06:33.630 --> 03:06:37.860
I'm happy to provide just
a brief historical moment.

03:06:37.860 --> 03:06:41.680
While I was thinking about what
to select, I did some searching

03:06:41.680 --> 03:06:46.750
on the PTL website and I actually
found a list of all the members

03:06:46.750 --> 03:06:50.860
that had served as a chair of PTPL,
and since we're here at the Library

03:06:50.860 --> 03:06:53.170
of Congress today, I was
wondering well, how often

03:06:53.170 --> 03:06:55.230
or how active have Library

03:06:55.230 --> 03:06:57.320
of Congress staff been
in this organization.

03:06:57.320 --> 03:07:00.600
And I was kind of pleasantly
surprised to find

03:07:00.600 --> 03:07:03.200
that there's actually been 9 chairs

03:07:03.200 --> 03:07:06.270
from the Library of
Congress in PTPL.

03:07:06.270 --> 03:07:13.530
Actually, the very second chair of
PTPL was Charles Martel, which was,

03:07:13.530 --> 03:07:18.800
I believe that was in 1924.

03:07:18.800 --> 03:07:22.200
And many of you may know him.

03:07:22.200 --> 03:07:26.490
He's quite well known because
he was a chief classifier.

03:07:26.490 --> 03:07:29.850
And when the decision was
made to develop a Library

03:07:29.850 --> 03:07:33.670
of Congress classification,
he oversaw the development

03:07:33.670 --> 03:07:37.780
of the new system base don't he
existing million volume collection

03:07:37.780 --> 03:07:41.310
that the Library of
Congress in 1897.

03:07:41.310 --> 03:07:44.210
Over the years, they've
had other chairs.

03:07:44.210 --> 03:07:47.940
1935 to 36 was Theodore Mueller.

03:07:47.940 --> 03:07:52.470
1948 to 49 was Werner Ellinger.

03:07:52.470 --> 03:07:58.040
Other chairs include Robert
R. Holmes, 1963 to 64.

03:07:58.040 --> 03:08:01.170
Alice F. Toomey from 1969 to 70.

03:08:01.170 --> 03:08:05.080
She was actually a well known
reference librarian that worked

03:08:05.080 --> 03:08:10.550
on a World Bibliography of
Bibliographies between 1964

03:08:10.550 --> 03:08:16.320
and 1974, I mean 1964
through 74, right?

03:08:16.320 --> 03:08:22.510
Another Member was Arthur Lieb,
who was very active in our prints

03:08:22.510 --> 03:08:24.780
and photograph collection.

03:08:24.780 --> 03:08:27.920
We actually have three
that were chair,

03:08:27.920 --> 03:08:31.400
I guess during what I would call
like our recent 30 year period.

03:08:31.400 --> 03:08:35.300
Some of them actually still work
here at Library of Congress.

03:08:35.300 --> 03:08:40.590
One of them is Andrew Lisowski,
who was the chair from 1985 to 86,

03:08:40.590 --> 03:08:44.960
and he works in automation with
our [inaudible] program office.

03:08:44.960 --> 03:08:49.820
I saw that Vera Clyburn was here
today, who was our chair in 2011,

03:08:49.820 --> 03:08:52.420
and she's the current
chief of our U.S. Art,

03:08:52.420 --> 03:08:54.910
Sciences and Humanities division.

03:08:54.910 --> 03:08:58.340
And, of course, I'm the
last one for right now.

03:08:58.340 --> 03:09:03.750 position:56%
But I'm sure by showing this history
that we will probably continue

03:09:03.750 --> 03:09:08.940
to have may of Library of
Congress's staff involved in PTPL.

03:09:08.940 --> 03:09:12.460
As was a recurring theme
at the meeting today,

03:09:12.460 --> 03:09:15.580
education professional
development training,

03:09:15.580 --> 03:09:18.380
it's a very important
part for our profession.

03:09:18.380 --> 03:09:22.110
And I just think PTPL
does a really great job

03:09:22.110 --> 03:09:25.300
in providing an opportunity
fro all of us.

03:09:25.300 --> 03:09:29.840
It also enables us to be involved
locally with other colleagues all

03:09:29.840 --> 03:09:34.840
over the metropolitan area,
Maryland, D.C., and to network

03:09:34.840 --> 03:09:36.900
with all different
types of libraries.

03:09:36.900 --> 03:09:40.430
I mean, we have academic,
federal, state, private, public.

03:09:40.430 --> 03:09:45.860
And I just found that it's a very
convenient way to maintain currency

03:09:45.860 --> 03:09:48.820
and learn the changes in the field

03:09:48.820 --> 03:09:52.030
as it relates to technical
processing.

03:09:52.030 --> 03:09:56.440
Anyway, with that very positive
thought, I'm certainly hopeful

03:09:56.440 --> 03:10:01.930 position:56%
that Library of Congress will
continue its relationship with PTPL.

03:10:01.930 --> 03:10:04.230
Thank you.

03:10:06.480 --> 03:10:10.170
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
