00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.850
The following table
of values represents

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.510
points x comma y on the
graph of a linear function.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.770
Determine the y-intercept
of this graph.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:13.420
So just as a reminder of
what the y-intercept even is,

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.185
if you imagine a linear function
or a line if we're graphing it,

00:00:17.185 --> 00:00:18.840
if we imagine a
line, so let's say

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.950
that is our line
right over there.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.190
This is our y-axis.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.760
This is our x-axis.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.020
The y-intercept is where
we intersect the y-axis.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.890
Now, what do we know
about the y-intercept?

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.930
Well, at the y-intercept x
is going to be equal to 0.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.690
So this is the point
0 comma something.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.290
And so when people
are talking about,

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.520
what is your y-intercept?

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.360
They're usually
saying, well, what

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.409
is the y-coordinate
when x equals 0.

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:47.950
So we're really
trying to figure out,

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.060
what is the y-coordinate
when x equals 0?

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:54.830
So we know the x-coordinate
when y is equal to 0.

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:56.560
So this is actually
the x-intercept.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:00.460
So this point right over
here is the point 2 comma 0.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.830
So when people say
x-intercept, that's

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.750
the x-coordinate
when y equals 0.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.970
Well, they gave us
the x-intercept.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.910
So that right over there
is the x-intercept.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.150
But what's the y-intercept?

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.135
What is the y-value
when x equals 0?

00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:15.820
Well, let's see.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.620
They give us what happens to
y when x is negative 2, when

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.270
it's 1, when it's
2, when it's 4.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.390
So maybe we can backtrack
from one of these

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.870
to get back to what happens
when x is equal to 0.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.430
So let me rewrite this table
so I can give ourselves

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.350
a little bit more
breathing room.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.695
So let's say we have
x and we have y.

00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:38.520
x and y.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.226
And they already tell us that
when x is negative 2, y is 8.

00:01:44.226 --> 00:01:45.850
And I actually want
to think about what

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.550
happens when x is
negative 1, when x is 0.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.130
Then they tell us
when x is 1, y is 2.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.720
When x is 2, y is 0.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.950
This right over here
is the x-intercept.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.220
When x is 4, y is negative 4.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.410
So they skip 2 right over
here. y is negative 4.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:07.430
So let's just see how y changes
with respect to changes in x.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:17.067
So when we go here, when x
changes by 1, y goes down by 2.

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:18.650
And it's a line, so
it's going to have

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.080
a constant rate of change
of y with respect to x.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.830
So similarly, when
x increases by 1,

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.650
y is going to decrease by 2.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.500
So y is going to be 6 here.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.945
When x increases by 1 again,
y is going to decrease by 2.

00:02:35.945 --> 00:02:37.070
So we're going to get to 4.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:38.510
And we see it works.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.790
Because if we
increase by 1 again,

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.930
then it is indeed the case
that y decreased by 2.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.640
And you see here when
we increase x by 2,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.250
then y decreases
at twice the rate.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.995
Because now we didn't
just increase by 1,

00:02:52.995 --> 00:02:54.030
we increased by 2.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.160
So now y is going
to decrease by 4.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.410
And what's constant
here is your change

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.320
in y over your change in x.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.590
When x increases by
1, y decreases by 2.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.840
When x increases by
2, y decreases by 4.

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.130
Either way you think
about it, your change

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.060
in y for a unit
change in x is going

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.230
to be equal to negative 2.

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.660
But anyway, we actually
answered the question

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:24.520
before without even
realizing it when

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.160
we filled in all
of these values.

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.490
What is the y-value
when x equals 0?

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.650
Well, the y-value is 4.

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.330
So the y-intercept here is 4.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:37.300
We didn't really
graph this to scale.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.760
It would actually look a
little bit more like this

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.970
if we were to try to
graph it properly.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.790
So this right over here is 4.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:47.942
This right over here is 2.

00:03:47.942 --> 00:03:51.470
And our line looks
something like this.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.943
Our line will look
something like that.
