Let me show you what happens when we run that. So I wrote to the file

00:00:04.302 --> 00:00:08.042
corpus.pkl. If we did a really long crawl, we'd want to make sure that file's

00:00:08.042 --> 00:00:11.800
protected, so we don't write it over again. And then if we ran the crawler the

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.930
second time, now we get an error, permission is denied and we catch that

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.792
exception and see the message. Let's take a little peek at what's actually in

00:00:20.792 --> 00:00:25.783
that file, and you can see that it's not impossible to make sense of. We don't

00:00:25.783 --> 00:00:30.760
really care what's in it as long as pickle load and does what pickle dub does,

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.974
what's in there could be anything, but we can see that it's stored the webcorpus

00:00:35.974 --> 00:00:41.030
object, and we can see some of the contents we expect in there and lots of other

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.584
stuff.
