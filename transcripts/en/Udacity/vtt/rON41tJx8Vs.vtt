00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.300
So why should you use IndexedDB over Web SQL? Well,

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.990
the good side is that IndexedDB is supported in Chrome, including

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:12.100
Chrome for Android, as well as Firefox, IE, and Opera. The

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.990
downside is that, it's not supported in the old Android browser

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.570
or in Safari. So, there are going to be a bunch

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.270
of mobile users out there that don't have IDB support for

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.860
a while. Of course, there are a bunch of mobile users

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.360
out there that aren't going to have Web SQL support either.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.520
So what's a web developer to do? Well in general,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.080
I like to recommend trying to do the right thing, but

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.730
pragmatically making it work in tough situations. The answer here

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.020
is write to IndexedDB, but use a polyfill so it will

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.130
work on Web SQL browsers. A good polyfill to use

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.010
is the IndexedDB shim. There's a link down in the instructor

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.605
notes. Writing your code this way, you can write good

00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:52.450
IndexedDB code, but it'll still work on Safari, or other browsers

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.112
that don't yet support IndexedDB.
