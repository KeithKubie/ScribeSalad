[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.460
GERARD FERNANDEZ: I've been
playing games all my life.

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.630
It's my passion.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.850
I also learned how
to program computers.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.830
And then in 2001, we start
the first video games

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.850
company for mobile
phones [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.210
called talks Microjocs.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.920
In 2015 my studio was
acquired by a big company.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.880
Some of the guys and
myself, we decided

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.500
that we should do
something fresh,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.390
something new, and we
found it Omnidrone.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.080
"Titan Brawl" is a
real-time strategy game.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.610
It's considered as a mobile.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.800
Mobile is a massive
online battle arena,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.240
but especially designed
for mobile devices.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.160
The game is today
as it is, thanks

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.600
to the Early Access program.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.110
We changed many things from the
learnings from the community.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.160
Since we launched the
game on Early Access,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:58.635
we got more than 2 million
installs on Android devices.

00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:01.010
GONZALO FASANELLA: We started
in the Early Access program

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.960
back at the very
beginning of it.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.269
The difference between
the Early Access program

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.250
and a traditional soft launch
is that users are actively

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.530
giving the team feedback.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.230
So you don't only check
the metrics you have,

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.850
but they also provide
possible solutions.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.020
So you end up by doing the
game players want to play.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.490
The thing about
having the ratings

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.264
but do having the constructive
feedback was very good.

00:01:22.264 --> 00:01:23.930
The Early Access was
a great opportunity

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.724
for an indie developer, someone
starting and [INAUDIBLE].

00:01:29.724 --> 00:01:31.640
When we started with the
Early Access program,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.690
we approached it in
different stages.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.450
So the idea was,
at the beginning,

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.530
to focus on engagement
with the games.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.230
Once we sorted that
out, we focused

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.100
on the retention of the game.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.460
And finally, we focused
on monetization,

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.340
to do a valued product
for the market.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.940
We managed with the
Early Access to improve

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.720
our retention in 41%,
the engagement by 50%,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.270
and the monetization by
20% from the very beginning

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.876
of the program, till where
we launched the game.

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:00.740
GERARD FERNANDEZ: I
feel very happy working

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.350
on the video games industry,
because it has been

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.175
my passion since I was a child.

00:02:05.175 --> 00:02:08.449
And it's really inspiring
that through Omnidrone we

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:12.830
have a real chance to shape
the new era of the video games.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.870
ADAM GUTTERMAN:
Absolutely amazing--

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.156
hi, my name is Adam
Gutterman, and I'm

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:18.530
going to be leading
a panel today

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.430
about launching
successfully on Google Play.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.900
That story about Omnidrone
just kind of confirms for me

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.790
that all developers
are dreamers.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:31.850
They're trying to build an
experience, a world that they

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.844
envision here, up here in
their heads and their dreams.

00:02:34.844 --> 00:02:36.260
And they're trying
to actualize it

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.230
through software and through
a mobile or whatever kind

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.370
of development environment.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.860
And that's the challenge
of game development.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.050
And it's not always
the easiest thing

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.180
to do to kind of
actualize those ideas,

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.994
and get them into
software, and get them

00:02:48.994 --> 00:02:50.910
in front of users in a
way where you're really

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.020
communicating that artistic
idea that you want to put forth.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.690
And that's why we
built Early Access.

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:59.890
It's one of the pillars
of launching on Play.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.380
It's this safe sandbox
development environment where,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.030
as you saw from the
guys at Omnidrone

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.106
when they were
developing "Titan Brawl,"

00:03:07.106 --> 00:03:08.480
they were getting
great feedback.

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.146
They were able to
increase their metrics

00:03:10.146 --> 00:03:13.100
and really communicate their
idea in a really beautiful way,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.660
by the time they
launched on Play.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.510
And they had a beautiful
game and a 4.7 rating

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.600
by the time the game came
out, all through Early Access.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.760
We've actually got
150 games already

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.590
through the gate
of Early Access,

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.064
and we're continuing
to expand that program.

00:03:27.064 --> 00:03:29.480
And the other program that
we're going to talk about today

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:34.580
is pre-registration Who here
was here for the keynote?

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.630
Yeah, a lot of you--

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:38.000
so you saw we've got some
beautiful games that we just

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.730
announced this morning, coming
through the pre-registration

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.280
program.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.570
So please go to Play and
pre-register for those.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.370
We've actually put
over 100 other games

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.126
already through the program,
and that's expanding.

00:03:49.126 --> 00:03:50.750
Between those two
programs alone, we've

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.510
had over 60 million
players come through.

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:55.670
And it's been absolutely
phenomenal to see

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.330
the reaction of players playing
these games in Early Access

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.200
and giving feedback
to our developers,

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:02.840
players signing up to
be notified on day one,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.000
on launch day, for when
their favorite games are

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.200
going to be coming out.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.536
And these programs
continue to grow.

00:04:08.536 --> 00:04:10.160
And if you're a
developer and you think

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.137
you've got a game that is
going to be ideal for one

00:04:13.137 --> 00:04:15.720
of these programs, please reach
out to us here at Google Play,

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.981
and we can have that
conversation as well.

00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:19.730
In the meanwhile, we're
going to bring out

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.124
some great people,
some people that I've

00:04:22.124 --> 00:04:24.290
been working with for a
very, very long time in game

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.506
development, some people that
can talk about early access

00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:29.380
and pre-registration a
lot better than I can,

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.088
because they actually
use these programs.

00:04:31.088 --> 00:04:33.548
So welcome our panelists
out to the stage.

00:04:33.548 --> 00:04:36.964
[APPLAUSE]

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.430
All right, so first things
first-- can you guys please

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.825
introduce yourselves?

00:04:44.825 --> 00:04:47.600
AUTUMN BROWN: Sure-- hi,
everyone, I'm Autumn Brown.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.950
I work at EA, and I run
our publishing team.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.230
So I get to work with
all of our studios

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:59.090
and make sure they use awesome
tools like pre-registration.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.860
SARAH MILLER: Hey,
I'm Sarah Miller.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.460
I work at Nix Hydra Games,
which is a small indie-ish game

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:08.390
company.

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:11.870
We focus on building games
for young women, which

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.850
we view as a pretty
under-served audience

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.436
in the mobile
industry, currently.

00:05:16.436 --> 00:05:17.810
JOE RAEBURN: Hi,
I'm Joe Raeburn.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.820
I was a founding product
guy at Space Ape games.

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.110
It was a 15-person studio.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.690
We launched "Samurai Siege"
and grew up to 100 people.

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:25.740
Right now I'm the product
owner on a new game.

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.390
It's a cart-racing game
that's in Early Access.

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:32.570
SHAUN RUTLAND: Hi, I'm Shaun
Rutland, the CEO of Hutch.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.850
We are based in London
and Brighton in the UK.

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:37.260
We've got 50 staff.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.740
We're super focused and
passionate about racing games

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:42.352
and re-imagining racing
games for mobile.

00:05:42.352 --> 00:05:44.060
ADAM GUTTERMAN: All
right, since you both

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:45.800
mentioned racing
games, and you're

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.660
both kind of developing
in the same space,

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.118
and I think you
guys have both used

00:05:49.118 --> 00:05:51.311
early access-- is that right?

00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:52.060
Let's start there.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.086
I think that's a
great place to start.

00:05:54.086 --> 00:05:55.460
SHAUN RUTLAND:
Yeah, so last year

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.760
we had a great experience
using Early Access.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.130
We've got a very
different take on racing.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.810
Everyone thinks of racing as
a typical skill-based racing

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:06.410
game.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.460
We've got two games
coming out this year.

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.870
One's a collectible car
trading racing game.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.970
So we had no idea if this game
was going to work, resonate

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.130
with consumers.

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.140
And we used Early
Access to validate that.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:23.570
And so the first
initial months, we

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:26.570
were getting some pretty
fascinating feedback

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.090
from players, a lot
around art style.

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:31.220
So I actually treat
Early Access a bit

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.440
different than soft launch,
which soft launch for us

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.110
is more about
optimization and making

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.450
sure that we can
optimize economies,

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.060
as well as device optimizations.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:44.390
But what was really exciting
was the qualitative feedback

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.660
that was coming through
Early Access, which

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:50.740
led us to understand that
the way we were representing

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:52.370
our game needed to change.

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:55.400
And we changed it, and
day-one retention, I think,

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.420
went up, like, 15% because
we got 30% more people

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:02.510
through the tutorial, and
then day seven increased.

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:06.650
So to have a program that
you can use that can actually

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.520
really influence the very early
stages of your development--

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.697
I think that's really
powerful for developers.

00:07:12.697 --> 00:07:14.780
ADAM GUTTERMAN: And you
mentioned you got feedback

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.410
on the art style.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.670
That was something
you guys were testing.

00:07:16.670 --> 00:07:19.253
SHAUN RUTLAND: Yeah, so because
it's a collectible car trading

00:07:19.253 --> 00:07:22.090
game, it's going to get the
Guinness Book of Records

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.320
for having the most
licensed cars in a game.

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.860
So it's got about 2
and 1/2 thousand cars.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:30.740
We're using photos for the cars,
but we represented those cars

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:32.887
as dots in a racetrack.

00:07:32.887 --> 00:07:34.220
We thought that was pretty cool.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.636
We thought that's a good idea,
because production-wise, we

00:07:36.636 --> 00:07:40.510
don't want to model 2
and 1/2 thousand cars.

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:42.320
Players told us they
want to see cars.

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.950
So there's an
emotional disconnect.

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.760
And what we did was we
found a different way

00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:53.270
to represent each car
in the game through 3D.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:55.946
And we've never in the history--

00:07:55.946 --> 00:07:57.320
in the last five
years that we've

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:58.903
been building these
games, we've never

00:07:58.903 --> 00:08:02.840
seen an art style or
an art change that's

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.280
made an impact on retention.

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:06.750
But this made a huge impact.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.890
So it was a really
big learning for us,

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:13.880
and it kind of changed
the culture in terms of,

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.460
you can never soft
launch earlier

00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:18.560
or get the game out earlier.

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:20.892
You always want to do
things to the game.

00:08:20.892 --> 00:08:22.850
But actually, you just
need to get the game out

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.460
there and start seeing if the
core principles of your game

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.510
are working.

00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:28.920
ADAM GUTTERMAN: Great stuff.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:30.545
JOE RAEBURN: Yeah,
it's similar for us.

00:08:30.545 --> 00:08:33.490
Early Access means we can go out
to real players just earlier.

00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:35.490
And when you've got a
game that's really risky--

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:37.860
like we want to make the
defining cart-racing game

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:38.360
on mobile--

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.943
lots of people have
tried, and there's

00:08:39.943 --> 00:08:41.500
been some success previously.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.930
But there's never been that
game that's defined the genre

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.550
and captured the attention
of millions of people.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.070
And we thought
controls is an issue.

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:52.830
So we wanted to try something
totally different on controls.

00:08:52.830 --> 00:08:55.190
We want to see how people
respond to the controls.

00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:56.160
We put it out there,
and we thought, oh,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:57.550
these controls that we've
got-- which is portrait,

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:59.850
and it's got an arrow, and
you kind of drag the back

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:02.400
of the car, a bit like a game
that you made previously--

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:05.044
SHAUN RUTLAND: Yeah,
I could feel it.

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:07.210
JOE RAEBURN: We thought,
these controls are awesome.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:08.460
They work really, really well.

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.040
Put it out to players,
and turns out they

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.202
didn't work as well as
we hoped that they would.

00:09:13.202 --> 00:09:14.910
And so we're like,
OK, we've got a couple

00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.700
of other control methods.

00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:18.520
Let's test them.

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:19.680
So we're completely
changing the way

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.270
that players interact
with the game.

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:22.380
And there's a
paradigm when you come

00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:23.515
in-- is this an arena game?

00:09:23.515 --> 00:09:25.890
Is this a game that you're
battling against other players

00:09:25.890 --> 00:09:28.014
from day one, or is
there a gentle, more

00:09:28.014 --> 00:09:29.430
linear introduction
into the game?

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:30.630
Is there going to be a map?

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.885
So we tested three
different control methods

00:09:33.885 --> 00:09:35.760
and two different ways
of on-boarding players

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.790
into the game that could end
up being more chalk and cheese.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:41.190
And we found that one
of those combinations

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.330
that we were testing--

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:46.440
one of those combinations meant
that we're getting an extra,

00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:49.780
I don't know, 12%
day-one retention,

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:50.940
which is pretty nice.

00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:52.620
And over Early
Access, in total, we

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.620
were able to move our
retention up significantly--

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.280
I think 60% higher
than where we started.

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.340
So Early Access is cool because
you can ask the big questions

00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:04.035
and get real answers
from real players.

00:10:08.442 --> 00:10:10.400
SHAUN RUTLAND: And it's
not just New Zealanders

00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.020
that use Early Access as well.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.610
JOE RAEBURN: Not just New
Zealanders living in London,

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.350
but it helps.

00:10:14.350 --> 00:10:15.470
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:20.720
ADAM GUTTERMAN: New Zealanders
making racing games, fantastic.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:25.100
Cool, well, thanks for that
insight about Early Access.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:28.010
Let's move on to
pre-registration.

00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:31.010
Sarah, you guys had a
really, really successful

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.920
pre-registration campaign, one
that kind of surprised everyone

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.720
here and maybe even
surprised you guys.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.430
I don't know.

00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:37.310
You want to tell us about it?

00:10:37.310 --> 00:10:39.310
SARAH MILLER: Yeah, that's
really great to hear,

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:40.687
that it surprised everyone.

00:10:40.687 --> 00:10:41.270
We were lucky.

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:45.470
We had a game that had gotten
really successful beforehand,

00:10:45.470 --> 00:10:46.790
just sort of organically.

00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:50.480
It's called "Egg Baby," and it
was just really, really popular

00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:52.160
with young girls.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.560
So we wanted to make a
better version of that,

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.170
because we felt like
they deserved it.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.570
So while we were
in pre-registration

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:03.950
with the new game, "Egg," we
had about 300,000 to 400,000

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:06.350
monthly active
users in "Egg Baby."

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:10.940
So we were able to cross-promote
to the pre-registration page.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.750
We ended up with 250,000
pre-registrations, which was

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:17.270
so helpful for us on day one.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.550
I think that turned into
something like 40,000

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:22.040
day-one downloads, and that
was before we had started

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:26.150
any of our other marketing,
which was amazing for us

00:11:26.150 --> 00:11:29.026
because when we
started our marketing,

00:11:29.026 --> 00:11:30.650
it made it easier
for people to search,

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.500
people to see it in
the charts already.

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.702
So yeah, it definitely
really helped our launch.

00:11:36.702 --> 00:11:38.660
ADAM GUTTERMAN: So you
just did straightforward

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.520
cross-promotion.

00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:42.680
Did you use any other social
channels or CRM channels?

00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:48.200
SARAH MILLER: Yeah, we had about
175 likes on Facebook, so--

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:50.210
175,000 likes on Facebook.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.350
So we promoted it there as
well, linking to the Google Play

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:56.000
Store.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.760
And yeah, it definitely helped.

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.490
ADAM GUTTERMAN:
Fantastic, that's awesome.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.350
I know, Autumn, you guys have
been whales on the program.

00:12:04.350 --> 00:12:08.870
You guys have done several very
successful, very large present

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:10.890
pre-registration
campaigns with us.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:12.140
Can you share your experience?

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:13.760
AUTUMN BROWN: Sure,
anytime Google

00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:16.010
is willing to feature
you, we will jump at that.

00:12:16.010 --> 00:12:18.120
So we were very happy to hear.

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.710
The first time we used it--
we've run seven programs.

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:24.187
Our first one was "Need
for Speed, No Limits."

00:12:24.187 --> 00:12:28.630
And we weren't quite sure how
to use it, but Google was great.

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:30.380
They walked us through it.

00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:33.980
That one, we ran two weeks prior
to launch, and we were happy.

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:36.050
We didn't really have a
benchmark at that time

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:38.240
to see what success looked like.

00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:39.980
But similar to what
Sarah mentioned,

00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:43.280
we noticed that our week-one
installs were slightly higher

00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:45.956
than we expected them to be.

00:12:45.956 --> 00:12:48.080
And then we also noticed
that our top chart ranking

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.204
moved a little bit quicker.

00:12:49.204 --> 00:12:51.560
And then also, keyword
search was something

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.450
that we would keep
an eye on at launch,

00:12:53.450 --> 00:12:56.120
and it would take us a few
weeks to earn the cloud,

00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.490
from the store, to show
up in certain keywords.

00:12:58.490 --> 00:13:01.160
So having that
pre-registration, that wave

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.950
of people come in on
day one or day two,

00:13:03.950 --> 00:13:05.862
seemed to really help that.

00:13:05.862 --> 00:13:07.070
And then we've been using it.

00:13:07.070 --> 00:13:09.230
Like I said, we've
run seven campaigns.

00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:13.700
Our last one was "FIFA Mobile,"
which we launched this fall.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:16.160
And that one, we did
a little different.

00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:18.380
That one, we launched
several weeks

00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:20.750
in advance of our
worldwide launch date,

00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:24.020
and I think we were all really
happy with the results of that.

00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:28.070
So we had more lead time with
that to talk about the launch

00:13:28.070 --> 00:13:29.310
and what we were doing.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.670
We also worked really
closely with the Play team

00:13:31.670 --> 00:13:33.740
to provide regionalized assets.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:37.880
So we made sure that the content
was relevant to that country.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:40.040
And Google was great about
helping us get exposure

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.264
in each of those countries, over
the weeks leading up to launch.

00:13:43.264 --> 00:13:45.680
And that was, by far, our most
successful pre-registration

00:13:45.680 --> 00:13:46.520
campaign.

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:47.811
ADAM GUTTERMAN: That's awesome.

00:13:47.811 --> 00:13:50.420
And you guys did kind of a
traditional reveal of "FIFA

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.790
Mobile," like at Gamescom?

00:13:52.790 --> 00:13:57.375
AUTUMN BROWN: Yeah, exactly,
so we have a lot of history

00:13:57.375 --> 00:13:58.250
with launching games.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:00.080
So we have a bit of a playbook.

00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:02.510
And it was nice to be able
to tap into that with this,

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:05.150
and it gave us an
action for players.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:08.570
So a lot of us are making
free games these days,

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.940
and it's an impulse for
people to go and install.

00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:13.106
When you tell them it's
coming a few weeks from now,

00:14:13.106 --> 00:14:16.334
it's probably pretty easy
for them to forget it.

00:14:16.334 --> 00:14:17.750
But it was nice
to be able to say,

00:14:17.750 --> 00:14:18.970
you can actually take an action.

00:14:18.970 --> 00:14:20.690
Go and pre-reg on
Google Play, and you'll

00:14:20.690 --> 00:14:22.440
be notified when it launches.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:22.940
So we did.

00:14:22.940 --> 00:14:25.850
We folded that into
our Gamescom program,

00:14:25.850 --> 00:14:27.830
and then throughout
the weeks leading up

00:14:27.830 --> 00:14:30.410
to it, alongside the
Google Play support,

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:32.249
we did a lot of
social media support

00:14:32.249 --> 00:14:34.040
to make sure that it
was a constant message

00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.060
to our players.

00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.512
ADAM GUTTERMAN: And it was
a pretty similar situation

00:14:37.512 --> 00:14:38.970
that you saw with
"Need for Speed."

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:41.094
It was just like an
accelerated kind of experience.

00:14:41.094 --> 00:14:43.070
AUTUMN BROWN: Very much
accelerated, yeah--

00:14:43.070 --> 00:14:46.040
I think we've learned a
lot, each pre-reg we do.

00:14:46.040 --> 00:14:49.580
Another big, key part
of the preregistration

00:14:49.580 --> 00:14:52.010
is, of course, the offer
that you're promoting.

00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.430
It's nice to be the first to
know when the game launches,

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:56.450
so that might be enough.

00:14:56.450 --> 00:14:58.220
But we always also--
and I think it's

00:14:58.220 --> 00:14:59.900
a Google Play best
practice to include

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.170
some sort of a
pre-registration offer,

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.335
so really making sure
that offer makes sense,

00:15:05.335 --> 00:15:07.710
especially if somebody has
never played your game before.

00:15:07.710 --> 00:15:11.040
So if it's a racing game, a car
is really easy to understand,

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:12.507
versus maybe a coin value.

00:15:12.507 --> 00:15:15.090
So we spent a lot of time trying
to figure out what could make

00:15:15.090 --> 00:15:16.440
sense to go along with that.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.270
Sign up to be the first
to know, and you'll

00:15:18.270 --> 00:15:21.345
get X, Y, Z on those
first couple days.

00:15:21.345 --> 00:15:23.970
ADAM GUTTERMAN: It's interesting
you mention the "FIFA" launch.

00:15:23.970 --> 00:15:26.190
That actually changed our
minds about the program

00:15:26.190 --> 00:15:29.760
as well, because up until then,
we'd had anywhere from two

00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:31.320
to four weeks of a lead time.

00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:34.211
You guys had this proposal,
going live at Gamescom

00:15:34.211 --> 00:15:35.710
and then launching
two months later.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:40.890
And we saw that if you have
a very traditional marketing

00:15:40.890 --> 00:15:43.437
lead up with solid beats
all the way through,

00:15:43.437 --> 00:15:45.270
all the way through
launch, you could really

00:15:45.270 --> 00:15:47.220
drive a consistent growth.

00:15:47.220 --> 00:15:51.160
And even somewhat similarly,
but a little bit different,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.700
we saw something similar
with "PvZ, Heroes,"

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:55.890
where you had a very long
pre-registration program.

00:15:55.890 --> 00:15:57.931
But the velocity didn't
seem to slow down.

00:15:57.931 --> 00:15:59.430
It seemed to continue
to go forward,

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.555
all the way through launch.

00:16:00.555 --> 00:16:02.430
Can you tell us a little
bit more about that?

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:04.560
AUTUMN BROWN: Yeah, so
"Plants vs. Zombies, Heroes"

00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:08.370
was another game that we did a
pre-registration campaign for.

00:16:08.370 --> 00:16:11.251
That one was, I think,
almost close to two months.

00:16:11.251 --> 00:16:12.750
And again, I think
a really key part

00:16:12.750 --> 00:16:14.250
of that was Google
helping us keep

00:16:14.250 --> 00:16:16.740
that message relevant and
front-and-center to players.

00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:19.380
So I think around
that time, too,

00:16:19.380 --> 00:16:22.650
Google had launched the
consistent merchandising

00:16:22.650 --> 00:16:25.272
area in the store, which helps
players get used to finding

00:16:25.272 --> 00:16:26.730
these pre-registered
games that are

00:16:26.730 --> 00:16:30.342
available for pre-registration
or Early Access.

00:16:30.342 --> 00:16:32.550
So I think it just helps
that visibility in the store

00:16:32.550 --> 00:16:35.250
and keeping the game top of
mind, as we continue to fine

00:16:35.250 --> 00:16:37.560
tune leading up to
world-wide launch.

00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:39.570
ADAM GUTTERMAN:
Awesome, good to hear--

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:41.880
we've got a little
bit more time left.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:43.020
We'll take some questions.

00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.490
But real quick, I
just wanted to--

00:16:44.490 --> 00:16:46.364
do you guys have
any random thoughts

00:16:46.364 --> 00:16:48.030
that you wanted to
share about launching

00:16:48.030 --> 00:16:50.550
on Play, just thoughts,
memories, best

00:16:50.550 --> 00:16:52.733
practices, recommendations?

00:16:55.094 --> 00:16:56.510
I think we can
take questions now.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:16:58.735
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:59.625 --> 00:17:00.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.270
ADAM GUTTERMAN: Yeah, so
there's a couple of mics

00:17:02.270 --> 00:17:03.561
just right there in the aisles.

00:17:03.561 --> 00:17:06.869
Just line up, and we'll
take them one at a time--

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:08.000
you over there?

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:11.150
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] thanks
for having [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:13.040
ADAM GUTTERMAN:
I can't hear you.

00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.695
Shout really loud
if it's not on.

00:17:14.695 --> 00:17:15.200
AUDIENCE: All right, no worries.

00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:15.850
Is

00:17:15.850 --> 00:17:17.016
ADAM GUTTERMAN: There we go.

00:17:17.016 --> 00:17:19.474
AUDIENCE: Oh, I guess I was
just too close, not a big deal.

00:17:19.474 --> 00:17:22.280
Anyway, thanks for letting me
be up here and pick your brain.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.190
I have a bit of a
food-for-thought question.

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:29.060
What are your thoughts, each
one of you, on challenges

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.000
you've faced on a
storefront like Google Play,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.430
specifically on visibility?

00:17:34.430 --> 00:17:37.250
And what do you think
community solutions

00:17:37.250 --> 00:17:40.280
slash industry
solutions for visibility

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:43.290
on proprietary
storefronts would be like?

00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.911
Sorry if it's a bit
of a loaded question.

00:17:50.911 --> 00:17:51.910
JOE RAEBURN: You can go.

00:17:51.910 --> 00:17:54.370
SARAH MILLER: All
right, so I think for us

00:17:54.370 --> 00:17:57.670
because we're small, we did
a really clear accounting,

00:17:57.670 --> 00:18:00.580
before we launched, of
what our assets were,

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:03.820
and what our strengths were,
and what we just couldn't do.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:05.500
So we looked at
our previous games,

00:18:05.500 --> 00:18:08.534
and we looked at our
social media following.

00:18:08.534 --> 00:18:11.200
And we thought really hard about
how to reach those people first

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:12.400
and foremost.

00:18:12.400 --> 00:18:14.890
And then outside of
that, we didn't have

00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:16.360
a huge budget for acquisition.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:21.400
So we were really careful about
picking the right keywords,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.880
making a description,
testing out our icon

00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:29.680
beforehand, and making sure
that at every step of the way,

00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:32.140
users who would want
to find our game

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:33.730
would be able to
find our game, and it

00:18:33.730 --> 00:18:37.430
would appeal to them at
every point in that process--

00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.530
so just a really
careful accounting

00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:43.681
of what your strengths and
your assets are beforehand,

00:18:43.681 --> 00:18:44.180
for sure.

00:18:46.764 --> 00:18:48.680
JOE RAEBURN: Yeah, the
other way you can do it

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.920
is see if your game appeals
to any form of non-game group.

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.260
I think there's a great
talk coming up later at GDC

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:58.100
around launching a game based
on the TV series "Vikings."

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:00.620
So "Vikings" obviously
has a rabid fan base

00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:02.000
of people who like "Vikings."

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.700
Same with "The
Walking Dead" games--

00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.567
you're able to tap into a
community that loves something.

00:19:06.567 --> 00:19:08.900
And it might not be that you
have a big brand associated

00:19:08.900 --> 00:19:12.980
with it, but say
there's a YouTuber

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:15.890
that you know that
really, really loves

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.572
talking about driving carts.

00:19:18.572 --> 00:19:20.030
And you happen to
meet those people

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:21.110
and go like, we've
got this game.

00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:22.220
What do you think of it?

00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.020
Maybe they'll be
interested in chatting

00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:25.250
with you about the game.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.010
And a lot of the big-name
YouTubers at the moment

00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.110
are being contacted by
everyone, so you can't just

00:19:30.110 --> 00:19:34.520
rock up to a really
influential influencer who's

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:35.760
in the gaming scene.

00:19:35.760 --> 00:19:37.730
But you might be able to say--

00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:38.480
I've got a friend.

00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:39.970
He's launching a Ready Computer.

00:19:39.970 --> 00:19:42.470
He happens to know who one of
the most famous Ready drivers'

00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:44.210
co-driver is, and
he's getting him

00:19:44.210 --> 00:19:46.280
involved in the
development of his product.

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:48.410
And I think that
story holds true.

00:19:48.410 --> 00:19:50.630
If there's a non-game
interest to it,

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.054
and you can get that person
involved and maybe even get

00:19:53.054 --> 00:19:55.220
them into the game and make
them feel some ownership

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.940
of the game, then you can use
their natural marketing reach--

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:01.070
someone that other games
companies aren't touching,

00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:02.778
because all of the
obvious ones are going

00:20:02.778 --> 00:20:04.160
to be pretty well locked up.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.830
And maybe their community that's
something slightly different--

00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:08.750
your game has an appeal to them.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:11.435
And you can genuinely give
that person some value,

00:20:11.435 --> 00:20:13.310
because who doesn't want
to appear in a game?

00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:14.810
It's like the
21st-century version

00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:16.130
of appearing in a movie.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.447
So you might be able to
do something like that,

00:20:19.447 --> 00:20:21.530
or you might just be able
to have a really, really

00:20:21.530 --> 00:20:23.066
cool icon.

00:20:23.066 --> 00:20:24.301
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:24.301 --> 00:20:26.300
SHAUN RUTLAND: Sorry if
this comes across wrong,

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:30.950
but maybe building a game that
doesn't rely on the store,

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:34.040
so a business that has a good
LTV, cost per acquisition

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.320
model, blah, blah, blah--

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:38.470
that's how we see it.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:41.870
Store positioning is great.

00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:44.250
We're very grateful
for Google's support,

00:20:44.250 --> 00:20:46.010
but we're actually
building games that can

00:20:46.010 --> 00:20:48.635
be commercially successful, so.

00:20:48.635 --> 00:20:50.510
AUTUMN BROWN: Yeah, and
I guess just to echo,

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:51.880
leverage all the tools.

00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:53.630
I think Google Play
does a really good job

00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:56.730
of allowing us direct access to
the players in a lot of ways.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:59.600
So icon testing was
mentioned up here.

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.010
That's huge.

00:21:01.010 --> 00:21:03.584
For "Need for Speed, No Limits,"
we recently just did one.

00:21:03.584 --> 00:21:05.375
I know we're not talking
about A/B testing,

00:21:05.375 --> 00:21:07.070
but we did a hot-pink logo.

00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:09.320
And everybody in the studio
was like, what is that?

00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.736
Why are we putting
that out there?

00:21:10.736 --> 00:21:13.564
That was so off brand, and it
was by far the best performer.

00:21:13.564 --> 00:21:15.230
So it'll surprise you
what you find out.

00:21:15.230 --> 00:21:18.144
Just leverage the tools, and
then speak to your players.

00:21:18.144 --> 00:21:19.560
You have the ability
in the review

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.409
section of the store as well.

00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:22.950
And having that
two-way conversation,

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:25.158
I think, really-- it just
helps bring a lot of things

00:21:25.158 --> 00:21:27.187
to light that maybe
we don't consider.

00:21:27.187 --> 00:21:28.020
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.320
The second part of that
question was, how are you guys

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:35.610
individually valuing and
testing your penetration indexes

00:21:35.610 --> 00:21:40.420
for being able to communicate
and appeal directly

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.250
to your core
demographic audience

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:46.342
that you've identified
in your research?

00:21:46.342 --> 00:21:48.069
AUTUMN BROWN: Testing.

00:21:48.069 --> 00:21:50.360
SARAH MILLER: Did you say
testing it specifically, or--

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:52.040
AUDIENCE: Yeah, like how
do you validate that?

00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:53.830
How have you guys
validated that in the past?

00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:55.550
SHAUN RUTLAND: So Early Access
is really good for that.

00:21:55.550 --> 00:21:58.049
So when we were building this
collectible car trading racing

00:21:58.049 --> 00:21:58.690
game--

00:21:58.690 --> 00:22:02.910
which is coming out
in July, by the way--

00:22:02.910 --> 00:22:05.540
we had a business hunch
and a gut instinct

00:22:05.540 --> 00:22:08.030
that these players, that the
super-fans of these players

00:22:08.030 --> 00:22:11.730
would come from a very
specific community.

00:22:11.730 --> 00:22:15.134
So in Early Access, we started
testing user acquisition

00:22:15.134 --> 00:22:16.800
to that community,
and it was validated.

00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:21.310
So that's how we
typically use a space

00:22:21.310 --> 00:22:22.856
or a service like Early Access.

00:22:22.856 --> 00:22:25.355
JOE RAEBURN: Yeah, one of the
cool things about Early Access

00:22:25.355 --> 00:22:29.362
is, if you're a player that
goes into the Early Access

00:22:29.362 --> 00:22:30.820
and has a look at
featuring, you're

00:22:30.820 --> 00:22:32.580
a particular type
of player, right?

00:22:32.580 --> 00:22:34.760
You're looking
for something new.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.386
And the language
around it when you're

00:22:36.386 --> 00:22:37.760
downloading the
game-- it's like,

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:39.810
thanks for trying our
in-development game.

00:22:39.810 --> 00:22:42.130
It is in Early Access,
and it could be unstable.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:43.630
That means you can
put it out early.

00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:45.770
It's really, really
nice badging.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:49.400
But it's just the right
level of obtrusiveness

00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:51.709
that we can still do user
acquisition through channels

00:22:51.709 --> 00:22:52.250
that we know.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:55.770
So we can go like, I want to
target these guys on AdWords.

00:22:55.770 --> 00:22:57.620
I want to target these
guys on Facebook.

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:00.590
I want to target
these guys on YouTube.

00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:03.050
You can just choose
what channel you want

00:23:03.050 --> 00:23:04.850
and see how effective it is.

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.980
And bring those people
in, and then you

00:23:06.980 --> 00:23:08.870
have information
around the demographics

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:09.900
of those guys as well.

00:23:09.900 --> 00:23:12.680
And you see what channel
your game is resonating with.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.069
What's your D1 on this
group versus that group?

00:23:15.069 --> 00:23:17.360
So even though the group of
people who use Early Access

00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:19.550
and seek out Early
Access might be

00:23:19.550 --> 00:23:22.730
different from your
regular players,

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.770
the messaging is just
at the right point

00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:27.590
that means you can still acquire
through traditional channels

00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:28.970
and not really
see much of a hit,

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.970
versus acquiring on a
non-Early Access game.

00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:36.890
AUDIENCE: OK, last
part, and I'm gone--

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:38.889
biggest challenge
with that, biggest

00:23:38.889 --> 00:23:40.430
challenge with the
Google Play Store?

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:42.700
Go.

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:46.010
SARAH MILLER: Well, for us
we're using a lot of these tools

00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.940
really early on.

00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:52.340
So we just have to communicate a
lot with our contacts directly,

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.100
because some of the
stuff hasn't made its way

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.427
to be exposed to the
developer in the console yet.

00:23:58.427 --> 00:23:59.510
So that's really exciting.

00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:01.430
It's really great to
be able to use that.

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:03.890
But we do have to stay
in touch very regularly.

00:24:03.890 --> 00:24:05.450
We had to email
our contact to make

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:08.790
sure we knew how many
pre-registrations we had,

00:24:08.790 --> 00:24:09.420
which was fine.

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:14.660
That's not a huge deal, but
it was a small challenge.

00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:18.820
AUTUMN BROWN: I'll probably get
in trouble, but China, I think,

00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:19.910
would be one of our--

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:21.326
we have a lot of
players, and we'd

00:24:21.326 --> 00:24:23.991
love to work with
Google to be there, so.

00:24:23.991 --> 00:24:25.574
SHAUN RUTLAND: I'll
take that one too.

00:24:25.574 --> 00:24:26.462
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:26.462 --> 00:24:27.350
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.475
ADAM GUTTERMAN: Duly noted.

00:24:33.104 --> 00:24:35.270
AUDIENCE: I've got a question
on Early Access, which

00:24:35.270 --> 00:24:38.210
I've done kind of like a manual
Early Access in the past.

00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:41.840
And I've got feedback, some
good feedback, some not so good.

00:24:41.840 --> 00:24:44.940
I'm wondering if you had
any tips or best practices

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.100
for getting effective
feedback in Early Access.

00:24:53.020 --> 00:24:57.320
JOE RAEBURN: So I guess you
get two channels, one of which

00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.810
is the reviews that
you get from players.

00:24:59.810 --> 00:25:04.340
And I find those really,
really useful in that it

00:25:04.340 --> 00:25:06.916
helps make sense of
your analytics, which

00:25:06.916 --> 00:25:07.790
is the other channel.

00:25:07.790 --> 00:25:10.430
So I think your game
should be well instrumented

00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:11.420
when it goes in.

00:25:11.420 --> 00:25:15.050
So being a product
guy, I kind of

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:17.960
think doing an A/B test of
things that are really, really

00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:21.470
radically different,
like should the game

00:25:21.470 --> 00:25:24.860
be an arena-based game,
or should the game

00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:26.580
be a map-based
game when you first

00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:28.520
start playing it--
they're two completely

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:30.380
different pieces of content.

00:25:30.380 --> 00:25:33.230
I think if you're relatively
early on in game development,

00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:35.900
you should take the effort to
make both and see how it works,

00:25:35.900 --> 00:25:38.020
if you have a feeling that
either of them should work.

00:25:38.020 --> 00:25:39.800
I'm not saying you should
always hedge your bets.

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.258
But right at the
start, I think you

00:25:41.258 --> 00:25:43.430
take advantage of this
early group and the fact

00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:45.620
that they are early,
and they can radically

00:25:45.620 --> 00:25:47.270
inform where your game goes--

00:25:47.270 --> 00:25:49.820
not just, should the
font be Helvetica,

00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.900
or should the font be
Comic Sans, but how should

00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:55.820
you fundamentally
interact with this game?

00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:58.340
I think you take the opportunity
to ask those questions

00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.537
through A/B tests.

00:25:59.537 --> 00:26:02.120
The other thing that you can do,
which is really, really nice,

00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.757
is just have a button in your
game that's, Take a Survey.

00:26:05.757 --> 00:26:07.340
One thing we wanted
to do, and I think

00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:08.990
we will do for our
Early Access games

00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:11.448
going forward, because I think
we're going to use it again,

00:26:11.448 --> 00:26:13.910
is take a leaf out of Ubisoft's
book, where it's just like,

00:26:13.910 --> 00:26:15.380
hey, rate this mission.

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:16.837
Rate-- what are you enjoying?

00:26:16.837 --> 00:26:19.420
And have a little system to ask
just one or two questions that

00:26:19.420 --> 00:26:21.930
might be top of our
mind, but within the app.

00:26:21.930 --> 00:26:24.297
So you can get all the
unstructured feedback,

00:26:24.297 --> 00:26:25.880
and that gives color
to you analytics.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.320
You can run A/B
tests, and you can

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.410
see if you should take
the game in one direction

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:32.540
or not, or that
it doesn't matter

00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.840
and that you just go with
your design instincts.

00:26:35.840 --> 00:26:39.470
And you can directly ask
players in-game what they think,

00:26:39.470 --> 00:26:42.140
and maybe that would
be a cool product

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:44.630
thing that Google could offer.

00:26:44.630 --> 00:26:46.817
ADAM GUTTERMAN: Duly noted.

00:26:46.817 --> 00:26:48.275
AUTUMN BROWN: Put
that on the list.

00:26:48.275 --> 00:26:49.440
JOE RAEBURN: But don't
do that, because it'll

00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:51.190
give us an edge when
we design and have it

00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:54.400
in all of our games.

00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:56.179
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:26:56.179 --> 00:26:57.470
AUDIENCE: So I have a question.

00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:01.520
I imagine a lot of
people in this audience

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:04.130
don't necessarily either have
a major studio behind them

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:06.650
or a previously successful
product with six figures

00:27:06.650 --> 00:27:08.930
plus of installs.

00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:12.870
How much data-- user
acquisitions is very expensive.

00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:15.830
We did it with "NASCAR
Slots," and it was amazing

00:27:15.830 --> 00:27:17.010
the costs it gets into.

00:27:17.010 --> 00:27:18.800
So if you're small
and, obviously,

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:20.720
you're not going to
try and buy 100,000

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:25.029
installs with a reasonable
budget, how many installs

00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:26.570
would you say is
enough to be viable?

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:30.830
Is 100 players playing your
game enough to work with, 1,000?

00:27:30.830 --> 00:27:34.070
If you had a brand
new product, how much

00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:35.900
would you expect
in, maybe, a budget?

00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.600
Is $10,000 a joke?

00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.711
Is that way more than
you need to spend?

00:27:40.711 --> 00:27:42.710
Give us an idea of how
you would do it if you're

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:45.420
starting from no installs.

00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.910
SHAUN RUTLAND: So
without our game,

00:27:46.910 --> 00:27:52.160
I think we had 3,000 to 5,000
players for a couple of months.

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.191
And to answer the question
that was asked before,

00:27:55.191 --> 00:27:56.690
we had some really
good social tools

00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.870
that we could communicate
with these guys.

00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.190
So you can actually
gain a lot of insight

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:05.796
that's qualitative and--

00:28:05.796 --> 00:28:07.420
but yeah, I don't
think you need to get

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:10.370
100,000 players to start
getting decent data about what's

00:28:10.370 --> 00:28:11.120
going on.

00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.650
You won't learn
about monetization,

00:28:12.650 --> 00:28:15.057
but you'll certainly
learn about retention.

00:28:15.057 --> 00:28:16.640
JOE RAEBURN: Yeah,
it's to do with how

00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:17.870
big your uptake group is.

00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:20.150
One of the reasons you won't
learn about monetization

00:28:20.150 --> 00:28:24.200
is if, say, 5% of your
players convert, and then--

00:28:24.200 --> 00:28:26.750
what you really want to do
when comparing two groups

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.270
is get a population
size of about 200.

00:28:29.270 --> 00:28:30.754
I know there's
precise statistics,

00:28:30.754 --> 00:28:32.420
and you can do
statistical significance.

00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:34.840
But you want to get an
uptake group of about 200.

00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:36.870
And if only 5% of
people are converting,

00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:38.775
that means that you
need 10,000 players.

00:28:38.775 --> 00:28:40.400
However, if you're
looking at something

00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.650
that's a little bit
different, and you

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:45.050
want to run a single
A/B test, normally

00:28:45.050 --> 00:28:48.920
getting about 400 players
to have 200 in each group--

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.756
if those things are
significantly different,

00:28:51.756 --> 00:28:53.630
and I said you shouldn't
be running A/B tests

00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:57.110
against font type, running A/B
tests around really, really

00:28:57.110 --> 00:28:58.192
big things.

00:28:58.192 --> 00:28:59.900
There's an argument
that's been put forth

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:04.149
that says any A/B test that
you need 10,000 players to run

00:29:04.149 --> 00:29:05.690
means you're not
testing bold enough,

00:29:05.690 --> 00:29:08.189
and you're being pretty wussy
when it comes to the decisions

00:29:08.189 --> 00:29:09.060
that you're making.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.470
So if you can't find the answer
with 500 players for a single

00:29:12.470 --> 00:29:14.950
test where there's just
two variations-- in fact,

00:29:14.950 --> 00:29:15.650
we use a--

00:29:15.650 --> 00:29:18.650
you probably need 600, because
you want 200 in each group.

00:29:18.650 --> 00:29:20.720
I always do a null
control group to make sure

00:29:20.720 --> 00:29:23.386
that there's nothing going wrong
with the A/B test distribution.

00:29:23.386 --> 00:29:25.970
But yeah, about 600
players for a single test--

00:29:25.970 --> 00:29:28.320
so if you want to run four
tests, you need about 2

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:30.237
and 1/2 thousand players
in order to run that.

00:29:30.237 --> 00:29:32.070
So that's one way that
you could look at it.

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:34.630
But it's a pretty over-the-top
[INAUDIBLE] way to look at it.

00:29:34.630 --> 00:29:35.750
AUDIENCE: Cool, thanks.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:37.041
SARAH MILLER: Yeah, I'll echo--

00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:39.350
600 is where my
benchmark is for when

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:42.740
I'm trying to decide whether
or not to move forward

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:44.699
with a feature, so same.

00:29:44.699 --> 00:29:45.365
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:29:45.365 --> 00:29:46.700
JOE RAEBURN: Nice.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.217
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:29:48.217 --> 00:29:50.050
AUDIENCE: This question
is for Sarah Miller.

00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:51.590
I actually had a question.

00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:55.330
Since you said that you release
games with the target audience

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:58.930
being young girls, did you
have any audio techniques

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:02.370
that helped give you
advantages towards your game

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.620
in the marketing, towards
your marketing strategy?

00:30:05.620 --> 00:30:07.120
Were there any audio
techniques that

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:10.630
gave you an upper hand
against any other people

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:12.395
out there in the industry?

00:30:12.395 --> 00:30:15.020
SARAH MILLER: I wasn't directly
involved with the audio at all.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.760
I believe that we ended
up outsourcing it.

00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:21.730
Having great audio is good.

00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:24.040
I do find that a
lot of players tend

00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:27.130
to turn off their
audio on mobile,

00:30:27.130 --> 00:30:29.140
so for the people
who turn it on,

00:30:29.140 --> 00:30:30.850
it probably means a
lot to them, right?

00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:32.620
But for the people
who have it off,

00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.911
they're never going to hear it.

00:30:33.911 --> 00:30:36.550
But yeah, I don't have any
specifics for you, sorry.

00:30:36.550 --> 00:30:39.559
AUDIENCE: All right, thank you.

00:30:39.559 --> 00:30:41.100
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:41.100 --> 00:30:44.100
So I guess my question is,
with Google Early Access,

00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.870
when you're such a
small studio, people

00:30:45.870 --> 00:30:47.120
don't really know who you are.

00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:49.140
You don't have a
budget for advertising.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:51.600
Is that something that
is still a viable option

00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:53.557
for smaller studios like mine?

00:30:53.557 --> 00:30:56.140
ADAM GUTTERMAN: Yeah, well, we
actually have a permanent place

00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:57.925
on Play for Early Access.

00:30:57.925 --> 00:30:59.550
So if you're accepted
into the program,

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:00.883
there is a permanent collection.

00:31:00.883 --> 00:31:03.590
It's a little pill right
below the highlights

00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:05.370
or right below
the banners, where

00:31:05.370 --> 00:31:07.980
anybody who's interested
in joining the Early Access

00:31:07.980 --> 00:31:09.600
community from a
consumer side can

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:13.780
come in and see what's
available and then check it out.

00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:16.050
And we actually-- the
program is designed

00:31:16.050 --> 00:31:17.910
for developers of all sizes.

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:19.710
Developers of your
size, for sure,

00:31:19.710 --> 00:31:22.620
have been taking advantage of
the program very, very well,

00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.990
because, again, you kind
of have that problem

00:31:25.990 --> 00:31:29.510
acquiring enough users to
be able to test your ideas.

00:31:29.510 --> 00:31:31.650
This kind of permanent
place on the store

00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:34.892
allows you to do that
acquisition naturally.

00:31:34.892 --> 00:31:36.600
And we have that kind
of community that's

00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:38.770
built in to get that for you.

00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:40.770
And these guys have been
very helpful in saying,

00:31:40.770 --> 00:31:42.228
you don't need a
massive community.

00:31:42.228 --> 00:31:45.120
You don't need 25,000
users to test your ideas.

00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:47.180
A few hundred will
actually do it for you.

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:48.930
AUDIENCE: OK, and
then I guess just

00:31:48.930 --> 00:31:52.110
to follow up with that train of
thought-- so my game is around,

00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.760
I want to say, between
90% to 95% done.

00:31:54.760 --> 00:31:56.812
And would you say that
that's too late to start

00:31:56.812 --> 00:31:58.020
the Early Access [INAUDIBLE]?

00:31:58.020 --> 00:31:59.520
ADAM GUTTERMAN: I
don't think it's--

00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:01.746
I think that you may not
necessarily be quite as done

00:32:01.746 --> 00:32:02.620
as you think you are.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:04.399
AUDIENCE: Yeah, that
kind of happens, so.

00:32:04.399 --> 00:32:06.690
ADAM GUTTERMAN: Yeah, I don't
think it's ever too late.

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:07.500
AUDIENCE: All right, awesome.

00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:08.910
Thank you so much
guys, appreciate it.

00:32:08.910 --> 00:32:09.540
ADAM GUTTERMAN: Great,
so we actually have

00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:10.690
time for one more question.

00:32:10.690 --> 00:32:12.990
So that's going to be you,
and then we'll close up.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:14.156
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:32:14.156 --> 00:32:16.890
So you said a couple of
words about the Early Access

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:18.120
on mobile.

00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.460
I wonder if there
are any drawbacks

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.130
that you can say
about considering

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:27.107
using the Early Access instead
of just releasing the game.

00:32:27.107 --> 00:32:28.690
JOE RAEBURN: So this
isn't a drawback,

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:30.840
but this is something
to be careful of.

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:34.700
If you have a game that
is going to have a--

00:32:34.700 --> 00:32:37.350
that you know you have a
bunch of really rabid fans

00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:40.500
about-- so we made three "Build
and Battle" games in a row

00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:41.370
for our first ones.

00:32:41.370 --> 00:32:44.100
And so we've got a
bunch of super users.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:46.470
And when these guys
come into a game,

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:49.650
they just really go all out.

00:32:49.650 --> 00:32:52.020
And we know-- we're
very, very careful

00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:54.899
with this one specific group
of users, because when they get

00:32:54.899 --> 00:32:56.190
in, the game needs to be right.

00:32:56.190 --> 00:32:57.231
And they'll play it hard.

00:32:57.231 --> 00:32:59.100
And if it isn't right,
they'll bounce out.

00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:02.820
And so although these guys are
the ones who really, really

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:05.940
want to get access
to your game, we

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.370
don't want them to
have access until we've

00:33:08.370 --> 00:33:11.330
had enough time to tweak it
and make it perfect for them.

00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:13.020
But actually, Early
Access helps here,

00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:15.186
because we've been able to
have a conversation where

00:33:15.186 --> 00:33:17.640
we're like, guys, the
game's not in beta.

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:20.952
It's not that thing where
it's out in Australia or out

00:33:20.952 --> 00:33:22.410
in the Netherlands,
where we always

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:26.430
provide you access because
you need to have early access.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:28.780
We're testing it out
with this new program.

00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:29.382
It's not beta.

00:33:29.382 --> 00:33:30.840
We're going to give
you access when

00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:32.590
it gets to beta, which
is the time that we

00:33:32.590 --> 00:33:34.110
want these people to come in.

00:33:34.110 --> 00:33:37.102
So it's actually allowed
our messaging to be better,

00:33:37.102 --> 00:33:38.310
the whole Early Access thing.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:41.970
It's a pre-beta phase that's
got a really nice name,

00:33:41.970 --> 00:33:43.830
so you don't want to
play the game now.

00:33:43.830 --> 00:33:46.020
It's going to be a
little bit crappy.

00:33:46.020 --> 00:33:48.030
But that's the one thing
that I'd watch out for.

00:33:48.030 --> 00:33:50.160
You don't want to take these
guys who are absolutely

00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.326
going to love your game,
but they'll burn out on it.

00:33:52.326 --> 00:33:55.570
And they'll turn out on
it if it's not perfect,

00:33:55.570 --> 00:33:58.320
and deploy that missile
before you're ready.

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.980
AUDIENCE: OK, sure, so you say
just that if it's not really

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:05.010
an experimental game
play, just better

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.429
to go full release instead
of Early Access, right?

00:34:08.429 --> 00:34:11.130
JOE RAEBURN: No, I mean for a
particular segment of users--

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:14.006
the ones that you
know will love--

00:34:14.006 --> 00:34:16.380
when the game is complete,
you know that they'll love it.

00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.046
And you know that
they'll stick with it,

00:34:18.046 --> 00:34:20.010
like the users that
you can cross-promote,

00:34:20.010 --> 00:34:22.586
the ones that are
within your network.

00:34:22.586 --> 00:34:24.210
I don't think you
want to cross-promote

00:34:24.210 --> 00:34:25.560
those guys in Early Access.

00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.710
You want to bring in
people who can tell you

00:34:28.710 --> 00:34:31.350
what's wrong about your game.

00:34:31.350 --> 00:34:33.120
And if you happen to--

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:38.127
the uses that come in, because
you're being very experimental,

00:34:38.127 --> 00:34:39.210
you might burn those guys.

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:42.020
You might change some
things that they don't like,

00:34:42.020 --> 00:34:44.500
whereas with this group
of cross-promoted users,

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.770
I think just hold on
with your cross-promotion

00:34:46.770 --> 00:34:48.949
until a little bit later.

00:34:48.949 --> 00:34:52.320
AUDIENCE: OK, thank you so much.

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:54.360
ADAM GUTTERMAN: That
about wraps up our panel

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.860
on launching successfully
on Google Play.

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:58.710
In just a couple
of moments, we're

00:34:58.710 --> 00:35:01.200
going to bring my colleague
David Geffon up on stage

00:35:01.200 --> 00:35:03.570
to talk about building
community and what

00:35:03.570 --> 00:35:05.990
you can do with that on Play,
as well, and his panelists.

00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:08.850
But thank you all for
coming to attend this panel.

00:35:08.850 --> 00:35:11.183
And just, can we give our
panelists a round of applause?

00:35:11.183 --> 00:35:12.540
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:16.190
