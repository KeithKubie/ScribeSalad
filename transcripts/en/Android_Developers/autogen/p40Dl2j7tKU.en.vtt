we<00:19:07.710><c> are</c><00:19:07.950><c> we</c><00:19:08.040><c> getting</c><00:19:08.340><c> people</c><00:19:08.669><c> through</c><00:19:09.000><c> the</c>

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
we are we getting people through the
 

00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:12.590 align:start position:0%
we are we getting people through the
through<00:19:09.540><c> the</c><00:19:09.570><c> funnel</c><00:19:10.580><c> and</c><00:19:11.580><c> so</c><00:19:12.000><c> the</c><00:19:12.120><c> thing</c><00:19:12.390><c> that</c>

00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
through the funnel and so the thing that
 

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.930 align:start position:0%
through the funnel and so the thing that
I<00:19:12.630><c> think</c><00:19:12.840><c> is</c><00:19:13.470><c> like</c><00:19:13.710><c> the</c><00:19:13.950><c> number</c><00:19:14.370><c> one</c><00:19:14.640><c> thing</c><00:19:14.910><c> to</c>

00:19:14.930 --> 00:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
I think is like the number one thing to
 

00:19:14.940 --> 00:19:17.510 align:start position:0%
I think is like the number one thing to
measure<00:19:15.270><c> and</c><00:19:15.690><c> like</c><00:19:15.960><c> everything</c><00:19:16.530><c> else</c><00:19:16.679><c> in</c><00:19:17.040><c> my</c>

00:19:17.510 --> 00:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
measure and like everything else in my
 

00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:19.610 align:start position:0%
measure and like everything else in my
view<00:19:17.790><c> is</c><00:19:17.910><c> a</c><00:19:17.940><c> waste</c><00:19:18.210><c> of</c><00:19:18.390><c> time</c><00:19:18.660><c> is</c><00:19:18.960><c> looking</c><00:19:19.500><c> at</c>

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
view is a waste of time is looking at
 

00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:21.830 align:start position:0%
view is a waste of time is looking at
cohorts<00:19:20.100><c> and</c><00:19:20.460><c> so</c><00:19:20.760><c> you</c><00:19:20.820><c> look</c><00:19:21.030><c> at</c><00:19:21.210><c> cohorts</c><00:19:21.690><c> like</c>

00:19:21.830 --> 00:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
cohorts and so you look at cohorts like
 

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
cohorts and so you look at cohorts like
at<00:19:21.960><c> does</c><00:19:22.140><c> everybody</c><00:19:22.530><c> know</c><00:19:22.620><c> what</c><00:19:22.710><c> a</c><00:19:22.770><c> cohort</c><00:19:23.070><c> is</c>

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:23.450 align:start position:0%
at does everybody know what a cohort is
 

00:19:23.450 --> 00:19:26.750 align:start position:0%
