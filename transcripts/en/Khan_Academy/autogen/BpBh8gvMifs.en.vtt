00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
 I have here many root phrases, or 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:05.110
 Square root expressions 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.600
 What I will do is to review them all 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:08.500
 I simplify it 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.240
 We will discuss whether these numbers are relative 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.390
 Or non-relative 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.710
 Let's start with A 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:20.440
 A = square root of 25 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.560
 Well, these same as the square root of 5 × 5 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.000
 The output is clearly 5 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.440
 We have focused on the positive square root here 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.060
 Let us now solve B 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.920
 I will solve B with a different color, and I mean the root 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.250
 When I say positive square root 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.200
 B, we have a square root of 24 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.960
 If what we have to do here, is that we want to get 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.530
 The fundamentals of this number 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.560
 If 24, let's extract its factors 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:56.250
 It's about 2 x 12 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.720
 And 12 = 2 x 6 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.430
 And 6 are 2 x 3 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.220
 If the square root of 24 is 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:15.320
 Square root of 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.080
 That's what the 24-year-old equals 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.530
 Well, as you see here, we have one full box 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.870
 So we can rewrite it 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.330
 This is equivalent to the square root of 2 × 2 × 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.030
 Square root of 2 x 3 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.890
 This is obviously 2 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:37.010
 This is the square root of 4 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:38.920
 And the square root of 4 = 2 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.710
 It can not be simplified anymore 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.520
 We do not see that we have two numbers that can be beaten here by themselves 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.940
 This will be multiplied by the square root of 6 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.110
 Or we can write it in the square root of 2 × 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.540
 Square root of 3 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.210
 As I said I now want to determine if the numbers are 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:54.550
 Relative or not 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.460
 This is relative 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.630
 Part A can be represented as a percentage of two integers 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.920
 5/1 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.340
 If this is relative 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.590
 This is not relative 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.840
 Non relative 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.060
 I will not prove this now 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.770
 But anything is produced from non-relative numbers 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:24.920
 A box of any basic number is non-relative 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:25.790
 I will not prove this now 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.060
 This square root for 2 × square root of 3 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.365
 This is the fact that the square root of 6 

00:02:30.365 --> 00:02:32.280
 This makes it disproportionate 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.910
 It can not be broken 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.830
 It can not be expressed as an integer 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.280
 Another integer as I did there 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.250
 I will not prove this either 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.910
 But I do gain some practice 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.010
 A quick way to do this 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.300
 You can say that the 4 can be divided into this 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.770
 4 square full 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.830
 Let me get the 4 out 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:52.120
 I have 4 × 6 

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.770
 The square root of 4 is 2, and we leave the 6 within the root, we get the 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:56.160
 Two square roots of 6 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.990
 That's what you'll see, but I want to 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.590
 I do it methodically first 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.820
 Let's move on to section C 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.610
 Square root of 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.350
 Again, 20 words are 2 x 10, and 10 are 2 x 5 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.050
 If this equals the square root of 2 x 2 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.740
 × 5, is not it? 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.690
 Now, the square root for 2 × 2, it is clearly 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.120
 Equals 2 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.530
 A squared square root of this 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:27.380
 Square root for this 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.400
 2 x square root for 5 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.090
 Again, you can do this mentally 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.910
 With little practice 

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.920
 The square root of 20 is 4 × 5 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.550
 The square root of 4 is 2 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.080
 We leave the 5 inside the root 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.200
 Let's now solve section D 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.380
 We need to find a square root of 200 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.350
 We follow the same method 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:50.390
 Let's take the fundamentals of numbers 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.310
 It is equal to 2 x 100, and 100 is 2 × 50, which is in turn 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.030
 2 x 25, and 25 is equal to 5 x 5 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.640
 If these are the factors, we can write them down 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:05.800
 Let me turn right a little 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:15.030
 This equals the square root of 2 × 2 × 2 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.390
 × 5 × 5 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.730
 Well, we have a full box, and we have 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.350
 The whole box is here too 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.290
 If we want to write all the steps, that will be 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:31.170
 Square root of 2 × 2 × square root of 2 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.120
 × Square root of 5 × 5 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.345
 Square root of 2 × 2 = 2 

00:04:37.345 --> 00:04:40.245
 The square root of 2 is the square root of 2 

00:04:40.245 --> 00:04:43.680
 The square root of 5 × 5, equals the square root of 25 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.430
 It will be 5 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:46.880
 So we can rearrange them 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.830
 2 x 5 = 10 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.730
 10 square roots for 2 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:53.150
 Again, the number is relative 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:58.800
 We can not express it in a fraction that contains correct numbers 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.850
 Stretch and place 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:04.270
 If you want to try to express this number 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:08.610
 It will last forever, but it will not be repeated 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.790
 Well, let's now solve part E 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.720
 Square root for 2000 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.660
 I will do it here at the bottom 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:20.620
 Part E, square root for 2000 

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:23.950
 We follow the same way we did recently 

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.820
 We will analyze the number to its initial factors 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:35.680
 It is 2 × 1000, and 1000 = 2 × 500, 500 = 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:45.930
 2 x 250, 250 = 2 x 125, 125 = 5 x 25 

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.580
 And 25 = 5 × 5 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.600
 So we finished 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:56.180
 If this equals the square root of 2 × 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:59.630
 2 - I will put it between brackets - (2 × 2) 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:06.350
 (2 × 2) (2 × 2) (5 × 5) 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.840
 (5 × 5), right? 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.390
 We have 1, 2, 3, 4 arcs of number 2 × 2, and three of the number 5 × 5 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:18.000
 Now how much is this? 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.520
 Well, one thing you'll notice is, he can write the output 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.140
 As follows, this is 4 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:27.510
 If we have 4 duplicate 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.600
 This is equal to the square root of 4 × 4 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:37.330
 × Square root of 5 × 5 × 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.480
 Square root of 5 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.310
 As is clear these 4 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.570
 These are 5 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.070
 And then x square root of 5 

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.070
 If 4 × 5 = 20 square root of 5 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.290
 This is not relative again 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:58.290
 Non relative 

00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:00.990
 Well, to solve the F 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:16.850
 Square root of 1/4, where we can consider it the same 

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:21.250
 Square root of 1 / square root of 4 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.180
 And equal to 1/2 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:25.170
 As is clear, it is a relative number 

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:27.400
 Where it can be written as a break 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:33.050
 If it is relative 

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:39.380
 Part G is the square root of 9/4 

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.800
 Square root for 9/4 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:44.600
 Same logic 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:48.160
 This is equal to the square root of 9 / square root 

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:52.910
 For 4, equal to 3/2 

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:56.960
 To solve the part H 

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:02.720
 Square root of 0.16 

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.250
 You can do this mentally if you have 

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:07.670
 I absorbed the idea, if I hit 0.4 × 

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:10.170
 0.4, I will get this 

00:08:10.170 --> 00:08:14.190
 But I'll show you a more organized way to do this, then 

00:08:14.190 --> 00:08:16.040
 These were not obvious to you 

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.330
 If this equals 

00:08:18.330 --> 00:08:22.730
 Square root of 16/100, right? 

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.840
 This is 0.16 

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:28.740
 This equals the square root of 16 / 

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:37.010
 The square root is 100, equal to 4/10, and is equal to 0.4 

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.260
 Let us solve more of these examples 

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:39.429
 Okay 

00:08:39.429 --> 00:08:46.180
 Part I, a square root of 0.1, equals 

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:50.840
 The square root of 1/10, is equal 

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.980
 1 / square root of 10, ie 1 / - 

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:59.890
 Now, the square root of 10 - the 10 is 2 × 5 

00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:01.380
 If that did not help us a lot 

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:04.920
 The square root of 10 remains as it is 

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:08.130
 Some math teachers do not want to leave a radical term 

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:08.870
 In the place 

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.330
 But I can tell you that this is not relative 

00:09:10.330 --> 00:09:13.940
 Non relative 

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:15.650
 You'll still get setup 

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:16.850
 You can try this using the calculator, and 

00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:17.530
 Will not be repeated 

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:19.430
 The calculator will give you a approximation 

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.100
 In order to give you the exact value, it must be 

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:23.560
 You have an infinite number 

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.770
 But if you want to make it relatively 

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:26.820
 I will show you 

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.620
 If you want to get rid of root in the 

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.090
 You can hit the square root of 10 / 

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:33.520
 Square root for 10, is not it? 

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:34.910
 This is about 1 

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.130
 So you get a square root of 10/10 

00:09:38.130 --> 00:09:40.630
 These two terms are equal, both 

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:41.540
 Non relative 

00:09:41.540 --> 00:09:43.870
 We take the non-proportional number, divide it by 10, and we will get 

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:45.660
 On a non-relative number as well 

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:46.930
 Let's solve J 

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:49.520
 J 

00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:53.820
 We have a square root of 0.01 

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:57.570
 This is equal to the square root of 1/100 

00:09:57.570 --> 00:10:00.680
 It is also equal to the square root of 1 / square root 

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:07.050
 For 100, equal to 1/10, or 0.1 

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.030
 Again it is a relative number 

00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:12.880
 It can be written as a fraction 

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:14.185
 This number is relatively high 

00:10:14.185 --> 00:10:16.030
 Because it can be written as broken
