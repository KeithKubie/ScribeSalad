00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here what I think the best answer is.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The best possibility is that we do have a mathematical proof

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
that follows standard rules of deduction that shows that the cipher is secure.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
There are very few ciphers that we can actually get that for.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
One actually is the one-time pad.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
We'll see later this unit how to prove in a mathematical sense

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
that it has a very strong security property.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The next best one is the last one,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which is to show in a formal way

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
why this cipher is at least as hard as some other problem.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We'll talk about reduction proofs more later in this course.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The basic premise here is that there is some other problem that we have good reasons

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to believe is always already hard.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Then we're going to show that if we could break the cipher,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
we could solve that other problem that we already have good reasons to believe is hard.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
The next best is this one--

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
that many smart highly-motivated people tried to break but couldn't.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is often the best we can do.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
For the best symmetric ciphers that are in use today

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
this is really the reason that they're argued secure.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
There may be formal arguments that show why they resist particular attacks,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
and that's part of smart people trying to break ciphers,

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
knowing all the known best-case attacks and trying them against the cipher

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and seeing that the cipher resists them.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
But ultimately the best we can do is show that

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
we think it's secure because it has these properties,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and lots of smart people weren't able to break it.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But that's not a very satisfying way to know it's secure.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
We're certainly much rather have the strong mathematical proof.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The worst possible argument here is the key-space argument.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
This one is often made incorrectly.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
The number of keys gives you an upper bound on the difficulty to break the cipher,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
because at worst the attacker could try all the keys.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
That's not true for the one-time pad, as we saw.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Trying keys gives you perfectly sensible messages.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
You'll eventually see all possible messages.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You can't know which key is correct.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
For ciphers where the key space is smaller than the message space,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
you could try keys and have a good likelihood

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
if the key leads to a sensible message, that that's the right message.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
This gives you an upper bound on how hard it is to break a cipher.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It doesn't give you a lower bound.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The fact that you have a large number of possible keys doesn't mean the cipher is secure.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
We can always add to the key space without increasing the difficulty in breaking a cipher.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We'll see many ciphers with very large key spaces

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
that are completely insecure.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Our best possible argument is to have a mathematical proof.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
That's what Claude Shannon was able to do for the one-time pad.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
It's really a fairly unusual case where we can get

00:02:30.000 --> 99:59:59.000
a mathematical proof that's that strong.
