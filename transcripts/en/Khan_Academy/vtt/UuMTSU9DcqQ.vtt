SALMAN KHAN: Hi, my
name is Sal Khan.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.020
I'm the founder and faculty
of the Khan Academy,

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:16.010
and we're trying to
educate the world.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.850
Welcome to the presentation
on basic addition.

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.470
In August of 1789,
they've already

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.530
done their version of the
Declaration of Independence.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.237
The process is called
photosynthesis.

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:39.350
I was tutoring my
cousins, literally,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.500
and I had to figure out
a way to scale myself up.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.360
So I started recording
YouTube videos,

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.905
and I started making little
software modules for them.

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:49.819
But I made it so
anyone could use them

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:51.402
and started getting
a lot of traction.

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:54.390
BILL GATES: What Sal
Khan has done is amazing.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.200
He's taken all this material,
and broken them down

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.010
into little 12-minute lectures.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.530
I use it myself to
remind myself of things.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.750
I have children who like it.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.970
So I was super happy
he came up, and we

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.430
got to talk about
where does he go now?

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.030
How can my foundation
help him pursue this dream

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.320
and connect it up with the
other great things going on

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.986
in the internet?

00:01:18.678 --> 00:01:21.890
SALMAN KHAN: I want it to be a
standalone virtual school where

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.210
anyone in the world who
wants to learn anything

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.872
can go there, start
from the basics,

00:01:26.872 --> 00:01:28.330
progress as far as
they need to go,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.515
get feedback, get
assessment, get practice.

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:33.890
And eventually I want it to
actually become the operating

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.927
system for what goes on
in the classroom, where

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:38.010
every student's allowed
to work at their own pace,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:43.490
and the teacher actually becomes
more of a mentor or a coach.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.320
BILL GATES: So I see
Sal Khan as a pioneer

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.450
in an overall movement
to use technology

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.000
to let more and more
people learn things, know

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.464
where they stand.

00:01:54.464 --> 00:01:55.755
It's the start of a revolution.

00:01:55.755 --> 00:02:01.340
SALMAN KHAN: All of the
videos, they're all free.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.740
Openly accessible.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.030
www.khanacademy.org

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.580
BILL GATES: I think it's
a huge contribution.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.620
Everybody should check it out.
