00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.240
Right now, at this very moment you have a
virus controlling your brain.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.860
No just kidding, well sort of.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.410
Hello again, Julia here for Dnews.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.060
Fun fact: Our DNA contains a lot of virus
DNA.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.449
Over one hundred thousand pieces of it!

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:24.249
Over 8% of our DNA is made up of so-called
En-dodge-e-nus retroviruses.

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:29.150
And a recent study by Lund University in Sweden
indicates that just such a virus might be

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.149
responsible for our super powered homosapien
brains.

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.930
This study found that when these virus DNA
bits are activated, they also activate nearby

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:38.930
genes.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.109
Meaning, old viruses control our brains, well,
that there are some old viruses in our DNA

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.940
that control when certain genes get switched
on and off.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.379
The researchers say this suggests that retroviruses
have played an important role in the development

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:51.789
of a complex brain.

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:55.730
Perhaps they are one of the reasons brain
cells are so complicated and versatile, giving

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.579
humans the evolutionary advantage of intelligence.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.050
So how did viruses get in our DNA?

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.409
Well, you can think of them like fossils.

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.500
Once upon a time, millions of years ago, one
of our ancestors got a virus.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.580
Maybe a cold, maybe something else.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.549
Back then, the virus was just a normal retrovirus,
hanging out in a host cell.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:16.940
What makes retroviruses unique, is how they
reproduce.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.230
Retrovirus carry their genetic material in
RNA.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:24.420
To make more copies of itself, it makes a
DNA copy of its genes and inserts it into

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.630
a host’s DNA.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.799
The host cell then reads the DNA with the
viral insert and is tricked into making more

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.049
copies of the virus.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.899
But by a stroke of luck, this particular virus
happened to infect a sperm or egg cell, then

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:40.240
when the baby developed from that cell, it
carried that virus DNA in every cell in its

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:45.090
body, and when it in turn reproduced, passed
that bit of DNA on to its baby. and so and

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.150
so forth for millions of years.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.479
These bits of viral DNA become so well integrated
into the host’s DNA, they become almost

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.479
harmless.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.690
The viruses mutate to the point they can’t
function.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.291
They lose their ability to break out of a
cell and infect a new one, eventually, they

00:01:59.291 --> 00:02:03.119
can only make copies of themselves which get
inserted back into the host cell.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.090
Multiple copies of the virus gene can wind
up strewn throughout our genome.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:12.400
Since this has been going on for quite a while,
humans and other mammals have defenses against

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.040
these DNA intruders, proteins that keep the
virus from replicating.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.470
It’s thought that most of the time this
bit of virus DNA in our genome doesn’t do

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.470
anything.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.230
So they become what scientists consider “junk
DNA”

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.580
While most of these viral fossils are just
DNA duds, sometimes they are harmful.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.670
They’ve been linked to some brain disorders,
like schizophrenia and even might cause certain

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.670
cancers.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.940
Sometimes, they are kind of good.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.300
Some domesticated viral DNA functions like
a gene regulator, they can tell which genes

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.140
to turn on and off.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.450
On occasion the virus DNA is hijacked and
put to good use.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.350
We owe a lot of our success to virus DNA - and
when I saw “our” I mean mammals.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.370
On at least 6 different occasions, virus DNA
led to the development of placenta in various

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.870
mammalian species, a huge evolutionary step.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.180
This viral protein, called syncytin, used
to help host cells bind together so a virus

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.450
could spread more easily.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.230
Now this protein is responsible for the lining
in the placenta that helps aid nutrient exchange

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.740
between the mother and developing fetus and
protects the fetus from the mom’s immune

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.740
system.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.130
Studies show that when these viral genes matter
a whole lot, when they are turned off in mice,

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.240
embryos don’t survive.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.890
So we’re a little bit viral..

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.110
That’s kind of cool, and researchers think
this latest study could lead to more research

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.360
on genetic links in certain diseases of the
brain.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.860
Most of the research on genetic factors for
diseases focus on just two percent of the

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:32.980
human genome.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.750
Adding the possibility of a viral related
genetic link opens a whole new range of possibilities

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:38.900
for scientists.

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.880
so what do you think of our viral inheritance?

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.880
Cool?

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.880
Weird?

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.880
Both?

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:44.880
