00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.620
Let's see...

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.040
my son bought this toy from the pound
shop a few days ago,

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.900
and he's had some fun throwing it around.
The thing is, it's quite simple toy and it's

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.510
one you can make yourself at home.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.320
You can make it using things you
probably have anyway like yoghurt pots,

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.650
plastic bags, wool or string. 
The great thing about making your own

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.250
is that you can experiment with the
design to see what makes the best kind

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.590
of parachute.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.240
What does the parachute do? 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.030
When it opens up

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:26.000
it makes a sort of ginormous circle.

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.460
It goes 'swoop swoop swoop'

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.500
and flop!

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.100
So what do you think would make this

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.120
a better parachute than it is? 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.380
Some time of thick - but not too thick - cloth,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.060
so the wind gets caught in it but it
still falls down.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:48.260
So you want it to be kind of light, but kind of thick at the same time?

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.920
Do you want to try and make a thick parachute?

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:52.510
Yes!

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.690
What we're going to do, so we can see which one is better, is make

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:02.110
two the same size. You're going to make this one,

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.990
I'm going to make this one, and we'll be sure it's not just the size that makes the difference.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.140
Shall we see if these are the same?

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.680
Let's put one on top of the other.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:26.680
You can look at the size, the material you're using, the length of the strings...

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.200
You can change the passenger! If you want make it a bit more interesting and

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.320
add some danger

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.750
you can always make the passenger an uncooked egg

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:42.620
and see if your design is good enough to
get the egg safely to the ground. 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.320
You can choose the design, but I'm going to show you a really simple one.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.069
because I want it to be round, I'm going to cut the seam off 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.319
the bottom of this bag. I don't want it to be too big this time,

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.069
so I'm just going to cut a square.

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.980
I quite like the idea of it being round

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.799
so I'm going to fold it in half.

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.400
It's really hard to cut a circle freehand, so round off the edges

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.520
You can see it's kind of circular. Now I'm going to cut the strings.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.800
I find the easiest way to make sure they're all the same length is to 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.020
keep matching them to each other, like this.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.860
I'm using four because it's quick,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:43.930
you can use more if you think that would work better.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.170
So now I've got my strings, I'm going to attach them to the basket, in this case

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:51.840
a yoghurt pot but basically any small container.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.940
Sellotape them to the corners.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.730
Once you've done that, the easiest way to
center it

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.700
so your strings are evenly spread,

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.680
is to put the pot upside down in the centre,

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.720
and then attach the strings

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.180
evenly around the parachute.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.260
And that's your basic parachute!

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.020
Let's go test these! Right then!

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.840
If we're going to test which one is better,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.320
we need to drop them from the same height at the same time.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.870
Okay.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:50.100
The job of a parachute

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.530
is to make things move more slowly through the air.

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:56.610
We don't normally notice the effect of the air when we're just walking around,

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.440
but on a windy day, or if you stick your
hand out of a car window,

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.110
you can feel the air pushing against you
in the opposite direction.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.510
This is called air resistance.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.020
Three, two one!

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:14.280
And yours has splattered!

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:18.660
If I drop this scrumpled ball of paper, it falls quite quickly,

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.130
but if I drop a flat sheet,

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.210
it drops quite slowly.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.150
That's because it's got a larger surface
area and it has to push more air out of the way.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:35.380
Parachutes make use of this effect and generally the larger the surface area

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:41.020
the slower it will fall.

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.640
I'm not sure how precise our experiment was earlier, 

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.380
but it certainly entertained the neighbors.

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:50.740
It was a really good way of getting Alex thinking scientifically,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.030
especially about things like fair
testing. And it was really enjoyable way of

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.870
spending time with him in the summer holidays.
