00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:54.249
it's it's very difficult to be
 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:56.229
it's it's very difficult to be
physically present with all those people

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239
physically present with all those people
 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.059
physically present with all those people
because it's too much coming at you but

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:58.069
because it's too much coming at you but
 

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:02.200
because it's too much coming at you but
when I'm in the zone and I'm excited and

when I'm in the zone and I'm excited and
 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.759
when I'm in the zone and I'm excited and
I'm tuned in to this performance I'm

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:03.769
I'm tuned in to this performance I'm
 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:05.740
I'm tuned in to this performance I'm
able to be very much aware of who's here

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750
able to be very much aware of who's here
 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:07.690
able to be very much aware of who's here
which I think is helpful because it

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700
which I think is helpful because it
 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.760
which I think is helpful because it
allows me to be performing specifically

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770
allows me to be performing specifically
 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.100

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.920
for this room the way that I perform for
a classroom of fifth graders is very

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930
a classroom of fifth graders is very
 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.450
a classroom of fifth graders is very
different from the way that I perform at

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460
different from the way that I perform at
 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.220
different from the way that I perform at
a dive bar or the way that I perform for

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230
a dive bar or the way that I perform for
 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.850

performance if you're in the audience
 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.970
performance if you're in the audience
for one of those shows so I think when

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:27.980
for one of those shows so I think when
 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.460
for one of those shows so I think when
I'm onstage if I'm having a great show

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470
I'm onstage if I'm having a great show
 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.800
I'm onstage if I'm having a great show
and I'm really tuned in you can tell

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810
and I'm really tuned in you can tell
 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.530
and I'm really tuned in you can tell
because I'm able to be very much aware

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540

and create a show that is meant for them
I try to look for opportunities to

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060
I try to look for opportunities to
 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.960
I try to look for opportunities to
communicate that I am in the same room

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970
communicate that I am in the same room
 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.870
communicate that I am in the same room
that they're in so if I can make a joke

a big part of what I want to do when I'm
 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.370
a big part of what I want to do when I'm
on stage is find a way to acknowledge

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380

that acknowledges that and also rewards
 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.729
that acknowledges that and also rewards
them for that how can we attune

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739
them for that how can we attune
 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:00.190
