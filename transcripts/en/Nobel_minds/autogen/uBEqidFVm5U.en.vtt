you do um i think is kind of two aspects
 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.039
you do um i think is kind of two aspects
to it one is I've done work on what

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049
to it one is I've done work on what
 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.560
to it one is I've done work on what
knows what's called at econometrics

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
knows what's called at econometrics
 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.510
knows what's called at econometrics
order which is a statistic some

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520
order which is a statistic some
 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.289
order which is a statistic some
economics and and and I'd in I did work

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299
economics and and and I'd in I did work
 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.880
economics and and and I'd in I did work
that I think of in a very simple way is

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890
that I think of in a very simple way is
 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.099
that I think of in a very simple way is
trying to show you how you can do it

00:02:04.099 --> 00:02:04.109
trying to show you how you can do it
 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.169
trying to show you how you can do it
without having to do everything it's

00:02:06.169 --> 00:02:06.179
without having to do everything it's
 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.749
without having to do everything it's
kind of a funny way to put it but um if

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759
kind of a funny way to put it but um if
 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.880
kind of a funny way to put it but um if
you want to study and I namak economic

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890
you want to study and I namak economic
 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.070
you want to study and I namak economic
system what you'd like to do is focus on

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080
system what you'd like to do is focus on
 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.440
system what you'd like to do is focus on
the linkages say between asset markets

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450
the linkages say between asset markets
 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.880
the linkages say between asset markets
of the macro economy without having to

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890
of the macro economy without having to
 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.110
of the macro economy without having to
model everything at the same time

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120
model everything at the same time
 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.850
model everything at the same time
so that so my kind of metric worklist

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860
so that so my kind of metric worklist
 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.320
so that so my kind of metric worklist
kind of devoted towards that and that

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330
kind of devoted towards that and that
 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.020
kind of devoted towards that and that
opened the way to think about studying

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030
opened the way to think about studying
 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.640
opened the way to think about studying
and testing a variety of different asset

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650
and testing a variety of different asset
 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.619
and testing a variety of different asset
pricing models and models that link the

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629
pricing models and models that link the
 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:34.140
pricing models and models that link the
macro economy and security market so for

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150
macro economy and security market so for
 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.780
macro economy and security market so for
me it's in and then when certainly comes

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790
me it's in and then when certainly comes
 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.729
me it's in and then when certainly comes
into play as you need to have ways to

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739
into play as you need to have ways to
 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:43.199
into play as you need to have ways to
address the fact that investors say they

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209
address the fact that investors say they
 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.470
address the fact that investors say they
they respond to information and they

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480
they respond to information and they
 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.899
they respond to information and they
struggle with kind of you know what the

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909
struggle with kind of you know what the
 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.339
struggle with kind of you know what the
right mark you know what the right view

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349
right mark you know what the right view
 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.500
right mark you know what the right view
of the world is and you need to have

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510
of the world is and you need to have
 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.900
of the world is and you need to have
ways to kind of capture that you know

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910
ways to kind of capture that you know
 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.369
ways to kind of capture that you know
those struggles and how they reflect an

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379
those struggles and how they reflect an
 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.289
those struggles and how they reflect an
asset market hmm and how well do you

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:58.299
asset market hmm and how well do you
 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.930
asset market hmm and how well do you
think we can do that now we're making a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940
think we can do that now we're making a
 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:02.670
think we can do that now we're making a
little progress I think it's I think

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680
little progress I think it's I think
 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.830
little progress I think it's I think
there's a lot more to be done but I I

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840
there's a lot more to be done but I I

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700
think that you're the challenges have
 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.599
think that you're the challenges have
been remitted the modeling challenges

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:09.609
been remitted the modeling challenges
 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:10.860
been remitted the modeling challenges
have been made clear and I think this

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870
have been made clear and I think this
 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.229
have been made clear and I think this
bent I think that opens the door for a

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239
bent I think that opens the door for a
 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.809
