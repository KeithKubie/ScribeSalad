00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:05.020
Thinking about ourselves – our feelings,
our past, our desires and our hopes – is

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:11.860
a hugely tricky task that most of spend a
good deal of effort trying very hard to avoid.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.430
We keep away from ourselves because so much
of what we could discover threatens to be

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.760
painful. We might find that we were, in the
background, deeply furious with, and resentful

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.780
about, certain people we were only meant to
love. We might discover how much ground there

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:32.230
was to feel inadequate and guilty on account
of the many errors and misjudgements we have

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.010
made. We might find that though we wanted
to be decent, law-abiding people, we harboured

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:43.039
fantasies that went in appallingly deviant
and aberrant directions. We might recognise

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:48.340
how much was nauseatingly compromised and
needed to be changed about our relationships

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.999
and careers. We don’t only have a lot to
hide, we are liers of genius. It is part of

00:00:54.999 --> 00:01:00.600
the human tragedy that we are such natural
self-deceivers. Our techniques are multiple

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.710
and close to invisible. Two are worth focusing
on in particular: our habit of thinking too

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.260
much. And our proclivity for thinking too
little. When we think too much, in essence,

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.230
we are filling our minds with impressive ideas,
which blatantly announce our intelligence

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.650
to the world but subtly ensure we won’t
have much room left to rediscover long-distant

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.460
feelings of ignorance or confusion – upon
which the development of our personalities

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.850
nevertheless rests. We write dense books on
the role of government bonds in the Napoleonic

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.630
wars or publish extensively on Chaucer’s
influence on the mid-19th century Japanese

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.370
novel. We secure degrees from Institutes of
Advanced Study or positions on editorial boards

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:51.050
of scientific journals. Our minds are crammed
with arcane data. We can wittily inform a

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.420
dining table of guests who wrote the Enchiridion
(Epictetus) or the life and times of Dōgen

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.880
(the founder of Zen Buddhism). But we don’t
remember very much at all about how life was

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.760
long ago, back in the old house, when father
left, mother stopped smiling and our trust

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.340
broke in pieces. We deploy knowledge and ideas
that carry indubitable prestige to stand guard

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.200
against the emergence of more humble, but
essential knowledge from our emotional past.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.209
We bury our personal stories beneath an avalanche
of expertise. The possibility of a deeply

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.069
consequential intimate enquiry is deliberately
left to seem feeble and superfluous next to

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.709
the supposedly grander task of addressing
a conference on the political strategies of

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.609
Dona Maria the First or the life-cycle of
the Indonesian octopus. We lean on the glamour

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:48.300
of being learned to make sure we won’t need
to learn too much that hurts. Then there is

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.749
our habit of thinking too little. Here we
pretend that we are simpler than we really

00:02:54.749 --> 00:03:00.180
are and that too much psychology might be
nonsense and fuss about nothing. We lean on

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.590
a version of robust common-sense to ward off
intimations of our own awkward complexity.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:13.540
We imply that not thinking very much is, at
base, evidence of a superior kind of intelligence.

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.450
In company, we deploy bluff strategies of
ridicule against more complex accounts of

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:25.730
human nature. We sideline avenues of personal
investigation as unduly fancy or weird, implying

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.879
that to lift the lid on inner life could never
be fruitful or entirely respectable. We use

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:37.709
the practical mood of Monday morning 9 a.m.
to ward off the complex insights of 3.a.m.

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.689
the previous night, when the entire fabric
of our existence came into question against

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:48.569
the backdrop of a million stars, spread like
diamonds on a mantle of black velvet. Deploying

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.359
an attitude of vigorous common sense, we strive
to make our moments of radical disquiet seem

00:03:54.359 --> 00:04:01.230
like aberrations – rather than the central
occasions of insight they might actually be.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.419
We appeal to the understandable longing that
our personalities be non-tragic, simple and

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:12.730
easily comprehended – so as to reject the
stranger, but more useful facts of our real,

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:19.289
intricate selves. A defence of emotional honesty
has nothing to do with high minded morality.

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:24.470
It is ultimately cautionary and egoistic.
We need to tell ourselves a little more of

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:30.770
the truth because we pay too high a price
for our lies. Through our deceptions, we cut

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.400
ourselves off from possibilities of growth.
We shut off large portions of our minds and

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.860
end up uncreative, tetchy and defensive, while
others around us have to suffer our irritability,

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.129
gloom, manufactured cheerfulness or defensive
rationalisations. Our neglect of the awkward

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:54.250
sides of ourselves buckles our very being,
emerging as insomnia or impotence, stuttering

00:04:54.250 --> 00:05:01.570
or depression; revenge for all the thoughts
we have been so careful not to have. Self-knowledge

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:06.420
isn’t a luxury so much as a precondition
for a measure of sanity

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:07.860
and inner comfort. .
