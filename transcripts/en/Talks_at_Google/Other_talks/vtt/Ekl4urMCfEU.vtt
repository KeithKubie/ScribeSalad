00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:09.321
Thank you very much. I'm very honored to be here thanks to Yasu-san.

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:16.996
As he kindly introduced, I am a shinto priest at Meiji Jingu.

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:22.251
Although I'm just wearing a suit and tie like a business man.

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:25.713
And not cool with it at my office.

00:00:26.714 --> 00:00:33.054
I'm standing at the far end of IT technology in this room, definitely.

00:00:33.471 --> 00:00:41.687
But one thing I can say is, I've been using Gmail for many years.

00:00:42.396 --> 00:00:47.193
I'm very nervous today since I have to make a presentation in English.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.114
Especially I'm going to talk about Japanese culture and religions.

00:00:52.364 --> 00:00:56.202
Both fields have a lot of difficult terms to translate

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.663
and my English is not good enough to deal with it.

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:03.709
Yasu-san, you're responsible for helping me, OK?

00:01:04.168 --> 00:01:09.965
So before starting my presentation, do you know something about shinto?

00:01:13.677 --> 00:01:15.346
Don't be shy.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:16.555
Yes, please.

00:01:17.515 --> 00:01:25.147
I'm Japanese, so I know more than 80% of Japanese people practice shintoism, some form or another.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:35.991
It is to celebrate the royal family, and Ise Jingu is the main shrine.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.828
Thank you very much.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.881
Right. ?? still common I suppose.

00:01:50.881 --> 00:01:54.093
OK, have you ever been to Meiji Jingu before?

00:01:55.177 --> 00:01:57.221
Wow, thank you very much for coming!

00:01:57.805 --> 00:02:02.518
So this is a picture of Meiji Jingu.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:08.899
So you can see Tokyo Metropolitan buildings right behind Meiji Jingu.

00:02:10.317 --> 00:02:14.780
So this area is called "nai-en" in Japanese.

00:02:15.322 --> 00:02:17.283
And "in the precinct" in English.

00:02:17.616 --> 00:02:21.954
Where is the outer precinct then, do you know?

00:02:24.165 --> 00:02:29.086
The outer precinct in Japanese is "gai-en".

00:02:29.253 --> 00:02:33.048
So you should know Aoyama Gaien.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.552
Ah, yes! Gaien!

00:02:36.635 --> 00:02:39.054
So this is inner precinct, the shrine precinct.

00:02:39.054 --> 00:02:44.018
And this area is called "gai-en", outer precinct.

00:02:44.268 --> 00:02:47.271
And there is a Meiji Memorial Picture Gallery.

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:51.317
And you can see the baseball stadium over there.

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:54.403
And the national stadium, or rugby stadium.

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:58.115
The national stadium, rugby stadium are not our property

00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:03.996
But the inner and outer precincts are the property of Meiji Jingu.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.627
And the Memorial Picture Gallery is famous for ginko trees in autumn.

00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:13.464
So...

00:03:13.464 --> 00:03:19.929
Please look at this picture. You can see the green belt here.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.805
Do you know what this is?

00:03:23.265 --> 00:03:24.892
This green belt.

00:03:26.435 --> 00:03:29.104
Yes! Omotesando.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.070
"Omote" means "main", and "sando" means "approach to the shrine".

00:03:36.153 --> 00:03:40.199
So this street also has an important history

00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:48.666
because this street was created at the same time as Meiji Jingu in 1920.

00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:51.001
So a historical meaning

00:03:51.043 --> 00:03:57.174
but as you know, there are a lot of brand shops.

00:03:57.508 --> 00:04:04.348
Of course they are all welcome, but it's just distant from my life.

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:09.436
So you can see the green at the shrine precinct.

00:04:12.481 --> 00:04:19.321
So this is a picture of new year's day at Meiji Jingu. A lot of people visit.

00:04:19.446 --> 00:04:26.745
A few million people visit this shrine in a few days or a week from new year's day.

00:04:28.622 --> 00:04:37.506
This shrine was founded in order to dedicate to the spirits of emperor Meiji and Shoken.

00:04:46.682 --> 00:04:46.724
However, there are no relic, dead bodies or statues

00:04:46.724 --> 00:04:52.771
of the emperors are would be expected at the shrine.

00:04:54.106 --> 00:05:01.864
And do they come to Meiji Jingu to revere the spirits of emperor Meiji and Shoken?

00:05:02.698 --> 00:05:05.409
Probably not, because...

00:05:05.993 --> 00:05:11.415
they do not know what is enshrined at Meiji Jingu.

00:05:11.498 --> 00:05:13.542
Here are some statistics.

00:05:13.667 --> 00:05:18.047
The population of Japan is 125 million.

00:05:18.047 --> 00:05:24.803
Among them, as she said, about 91 million are are shinto followers.

00:05:25.012 --> 00:05:27.848
And almost the same as buddhists.

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.268
And for example the christians are 3 million.

00:05:31.435 --> 00:05:34.063
You laughed because you added the two numbers, right?

00:05:34.646 --> 00:05:37.983
It exceeds the population of Japan.

00:05:38.942 --> 00:05:43.655
But if you ask any Japanese what is their religion

00:05:44.114 --> 00:05:48.744
The answer is most probably, "I have no religion".

00:05:49.995 --> 00:05:52.414
Many Japanese are nodding.

00:05:52.748 --> 00:05:59.004
Then why do people visit shinto shrines in the cold weather of new year's day?

00:06:00.589 --> 00:06:02.132
That's crazy, isn't it?

00:06:02.424 --> 00:06:08.305
I'd better talk a little bit about the environment of Japan first.

00:06:08.972 --> 00:06:13.560
The land of Japan is surrounded by the sea

00:06:13.602 --> 00:06:17.272
and 70% of the land is mountainous.

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:21.110
And a lot of rivers, lakes and small islands.

00:06:21.402 --> 00:06:23.821
Thanks to the four seasons,

00:06:23.862 --> 00:06:27.908
from spring, summer, autumn to winter,

00:06:27.908 --> 00:06:32.746
we receive a lot of blessings such as fish from the sea,

00:06:33.747 --> 00:06:37.584
or vegetables from the mountains, fields and so forth.

00:06:38.419 --> 00:06:42.172
That is why we show our gratitude to nature.

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:48.011
On the other hand, Japan is also famous for natural disasters

00:06:48.053 --> 00:06:52.057
like typhoons, tsunami or earthquakes.

00:06:57.438 --> 00:07:07.281
We pray not to have these severe natural phenomena while showing gratitude to nature.

00:07:07.656 --> 00:07:18.625
Our ancestors may have thought natural disasters were raised because they disturbed the harmony of nature by their living ways.

00:07:18.876 --> 00:07:26.258
Therefore, they tried to keep the harmony of nature by finding themselves as a part of nature.

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:34.433
Shinto has been formed based on these two minds: grateful and awesome feeling towards nature.

00:07:35.309 --> 00:07:40.689
We join our hands like this to the sun or to the sea, or to the rivers.

00:07:41.023 --> 00:07:45.277
Those objects are called "kami" in shinto.

00:07:45.277 --> 00:07:49.281
Kami of the sun, kami of the sea, or kami of the mountains.

00:07:49.698 --> 00:07:59.124
Monotheistic religions have only one omnipotent God, but shinto has thousands of God, or "kami".

00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:08.342
So there are one or several enshrined kami at each shrine, but none of them seem to be idolized.

00:08:09.176 --> 00:08:16.183
Instead people are greeting various kami, or kami in general, when they visit the shinto shrine.

00:08:16.183 --> 00:08:26.276
So in this sense, it's not that strange even though the visitors do not know what is enshrined at Meiji Jingu.

00:08:27.277 --> 00:08:34.993
So if you think of religion as a means by which we can find salvation through following God's commandments,

00:08:34.993 --> 00:08:39.164
living righteously and repenting,

00:08:39.331 --> 00:08:44.711
it will be difficult to understand the nature of the shinto faith.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.883
Shinto has no founder.

00:08:52.177 --> 00:08:57.474
Shinto has no founder, holy scriptures or concept of conversion.

00:08:57.474 --> 00:09:03.897
So there is no single accepted definition of shinto.

00:09:05.023 --> 00:09:09.903
But let me try to explain my view of shinto from two aspects.

00:09:10.737 --> 00:09:15.784
That is connections with God and connections with societies.

00:09:18.453 --> 00:09:27.254
As far as I understand, Monotheistic religions attaches importance to connections with God.

00:09:27.629 --> 00:09:32.301
Because an omnipotent God created this world and mankind

00:09:32.467 --> 00:09:40.601
and mankind can live under God's protection and can attain peace after death.

00:09:41.602 --> 00:09:46.398
To stay connected with God, we need to follow God's will strictly.

00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.401
Because of this strictness

00:09:49.776 --> 00:09:52.613
deep faith in God is developed,

00:09:52.988 --> 00:09:56.700
human ethics or religious body are upheld,

00:09:57.034 --> 00:10:00.329
and happiness and peace are maintained, I think.

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:07.294
So there is another aspect of religion that is connections with societies.

00:10:08.211 --> 00:10:10.964
When we see someone facing difficulties

00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:18.847
we try to help them to overcome their hardships through a variety of methods and actions.

00:10:19.973 --> 00:10:28.106
I am grateful for the help from the world when the big earthquake and tsunami happened 5 years ago.

00:10:29.024 --> 00:10:32.402
Whether it is love, charity or mercy,

00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:42.621
religious values provide people with a clear path towards sharing happiness with each other in the context of social relationships.

00:10:43.705 --> 00:10:51.505
If connections with God place more emphasis on individual pursuit of peace after death,

00:10:51.838 --> 00:11:02.265
then connections with societies orient people towards achieving happiness not only for themselves but also for the many people in this life.

00:11:05.811 --> 00:11:13.110
As I mentioned before, our ancestors thought that we are surrounded by many kami,

00:11:14.486 --> 00:11:16.947
even kami of our ancestors.

00:11:17.364 --> 00:11:20.409
This world is filled with kami.

00:11:20.784 --> 00:11:28.083
You might notice that the concept of kami is quite different from the concept of God.

00:11:30.335 --> 00:11:37.259
In shinto, connection with kami and connections with society are integrated.

00:11:38.427 --> 00:11:45.350
Shinto believes that people receive blessings from countless kami surrounding them.

00:11:45.642 --> 00:11:54.526
And in the course of their lives, they receive energy for their own development or societal growth.

00:11:57.362 --> 00:12:04.035
In Japanese there is an expression, "Ikasarete-iru". Do you understand the meaning of this?

00:12:04.244 --> 00:12:06.079
Ikasarete-iru.

00:12:06.204 --> 00:12:15.130
It's quite hard to translate into English, so I'm not sure if I can explain this accurately.

00:12:15.422 --> 00:12:18.633
But let's take an example:

00:12:19.009 --> 00:12:24.639
Instead of saying, "I live by eating rice",

00:12:25.265 --> 00:12:30.645
we would say, "I'm allowed to live by the rice,"

00:12:30.937 --> 00:12:38.236
which assumes the idea that rice is a blessing that we must be thankful for

00:12:38.403 --> 00:12:42.991
as the efforts of many people went into its cultivation.

00:12:43.074 --> 00:12:49.748
Based on the magnificient working of the sun, rain, soil and microorganisms,

00:12:49.873 --> 00:12:57.506
and furthermore, it was harvested and transported, and placed on store shelves.

00:12:58.965 --> 00:13:04.763
"Itadakimasu", the phrase before eating with joining our hands together,

00:13:04.888 --> 00:13:10.393
has all meanings of our thankfulness.

00:13:12.187 --> 00:13:19.152
So individuals are "ikasarete-iru" through various interactions in society.

00:13:19.903 --> 00:13:27.786
It means that individuals also have an effect on these interactions.

00:13:27.911 --> 00:13:32.707
In my opinion, the reason that Japanese people cherish harmony

00:13:32.749 --> 00:13:41.174
is because they recognize this interconnectedness, consciously or unconsciously.

00:13:41.299 --> 00:13:46.972
In principal, an individual's happiness equals peoples' happiness.

00:13:47.597 --> 00:13:57.315
Many people are mindful to behave in a way that maintains progress of harmony in the context of this interconnectedness.

00:13:57.691 --> 00:14:02.279
I perceive this as shinto's sense of religious value.

00:14:03.154 --> 00:14:11.413
I found an interesting expression in the book "Angels and Demons" by Dan Brown. Have you read this book before?

00:14:11.997 --> 00:14:17.002
No? But you've watched the film of "Angels and Demons"?

00:14:17.377 --> 00:14:21.006
Is that this old?

00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:22.924
No?

00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.635
No? Everybody?

00:14:25.844 --> 00:14:27.053
Nobody?

00:14:27.220 --> 00:14:30.348
Yeah, "Angels and Demons".

00:14:32.976 --> 00:14:37.772
OK, anyway, in that book there is an interesting phrase:

00:14:37.772 --> 00:14:43.778
"The planet is an organism. All of us are cells with different purposes."

00:14:43.987 --> 00:14:49.868
"And yet we are intertwined. Serving each other. Serving the whole."

00:14:50.118 --> 00:14:53.079
Don you think this is an interesting expression?

00:14:54.873 --> 00:15:01.546
So in addition, there is a concept called "Jo-Mei-Sei-Choku"

00:15:01.963 --> 00:15:06.301
Meaning "pure, bright, honest and sincere."

00:15:06.426 --> 00:15:09.429
Which is also an important value in shinto.

00:15:10.096 --> 00:15:13.683
So by maintaining purity and sincere heart

00:15:13.683 --> 00:15:19.064
a peaceful and happy social environment will be achieved.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:26.947
Purity means dislike of "kegare", or "uncleanliness."

00:15:27.906 --> 00:15:34.329
Kegare links to the term meaning the dying up of one's life force.

00:15:36.039 --> 00:15:41.044
In this state, we cannot unleash our potential energy.

00:15:42.921 --> 00:15:49.719
So please look at this as the potential energy that a new born baby has like the sun.

00:15:50.303 --> 00:15:55.767
However day by day, impurities approach it,

00:15:56.059 --> 00:16:00.563
resulting in weakening its original vitality.

00:16:01.523 --> 00:16:08.071
So in order to get rid of these impurities, shinto has purification in many ways.

00:16:09.322 --> 00:16:13.034
For example in bathing water like this.

00:16:13.868 --> 00:16:15.412
Or like this.

00:16:15.537 --> 00:16:18.039
This is a picture of Meiji Jingu.

00:16:18.206 --> 00:16:24.004
We have this "misogi" or "bathing water" in the cold days of January.

00:16:25.005 --> 00:16:30.677
And you wash your hands and rise your mouth before entering the shrine.

00:16:32.053 --> 00:16:39.227
And at the end of June and December we have big purification ceremonies like this.

00:16:39.602 --> 00:16:45.692
The shinto priest using a wand to cast away the impurities or uncleanliness.

00:16:47.152 --> 00:16:49.029
So by doing so

00:16:50.947 --> 00:16:57.162
we regain the original energy and vitality to live.

00:16:57.871 --> 00:17:04.044
The Japanese peoples' love of bathing is also one example I think.

00:17:05.336 --> 00:17:10.884
Here again I quote a phrase from "Angels and Demons" by Dan Brown:

00:17:11.259 --> 00:17:18.141
"God, Buddha, The Force, Yahweh, the singularity, the unicity point"

00:17:18.308 --> 00:17:22.562
"Call it whatever you like, the result is the same."

00:17:23.271 --> 00:17:31.196
"Science and religion support the same truth - pure energy is the father or creation."

00:17:31.613 --> 00:17:34.199
I think this is also interesting.

00:17:36.493 --> 00:17:39.537
So restore an individual's vivid state

00:17:39.829 --> 00:17:46.586
the support from society, as well as the efforts of the individuals become important.

00:17:48.588 --> 00:17:54.761
The shinto rituals, or "matsuri", may play roles to enforce this vitality.

00:17:56.262 --> 00:17:59.140
Have you joined any matsuri before?

00:18:00.141 --> 00:18:06.272
Some of them, right? People are very crazy for joining matsuri like this.

00:18:06.648 --> 00:18:09.067
Or this one too.

00:18:10.193 --> 00:18:13.071
A lot of people are watching too.

00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:21.162
And these ladies. This is Awa Odori at Shikoku islands in Tokushima prefecture.

00:18:21.579 --> 00:18:27.544
And even the children are involved in these matsuri.

00:18:28.419 --> 00:18:31.506
They look very vivid I think.

00:18:32.882 --> 00:18:35.927
So beside these big ritual ceremonies

00:18:36.177 --> 00:18:42.392
small rituals or customs can be seen in our life cycle events.

00:18:42.684 --> 00:18:47.856
Like bringing a new born baby to a shinto shrine.

00:18:48.314 --> 00:18:53.444
Or seven, five, three year old children like this.

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.115
And coming of age day.

00:18:57.699 --> 00:19:05.623
So these are important opportunities for us to clean up ourselves, or to show our gratitude for the growth,

00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:11.004
and to feel we are living in the community of this world.

00:19:12.422 --> 00:19:21.890
Personal happiness, society's happiness, is to evolve the existing harmony into a more progressive harmony.

00:19:22.682 --> 00:19:33.902
If I can say, our mission in this life will leave behind a even more harmonious world for future generations,

00:19:35.445 --> 00:19:40.992
while inheriting the harmonious world our ancestors have created.

00:19:42.076 --> 00:19:49.250
Many Japanese people live by sensing the horizontal connections with societies

00:19:49.667 --> 00:19:58.009
coupled with vertical connections with life, connections with past and future.

00:19:59.093 --> 00:20:06.059
Here is a question however: Is this only limited to shinto or Japanese?

00:20:06.976 --> 00:20:12.857
What I have mentioned is just the idea of consideration for other people.

00:20:13.524 --> 00:20:20.323
I believe this is a universal value that cuts across all religions, or all over the world.

00:20:21.783 --> 00:20:25.703
Nowadays, a lot of foreigners visit Meiji Jingu

00:20:26.037 --> 00:20:30.875
on weekdays almost all foreigners I can see.

00:20:32.961 --> 00:20:43.096
So they come to Meiji Jingu where there is nothing such as buddhist statues or sacred relics or national treasures to see.

00:20:43.346 --> 00:20:51.396
But the visitors seem to feel refreshed and regain their energy for their growth.

00:20:52.647 --> 00:21:04.033
And I am always moved when I see tablets hung around the trees here in front of the main shrine building.

00:21:06.327 --> 00:21:07.996
So look at this:

00:21:08.204 --> 00:21:11.332
You cannot figure out which languages are written, but...

00:21:11.666 --> 00:21:16.296
you can see Thai, English, French, Chinese, or German...

00:21:17.046 --> 00:21:22.093
There are many languages written. And look at this:

00:21:22.802 --> 00:21:30.143
"I am grateful for all the love and gifts with which I have been blessed since my life began."

00:21:30.643 --> 00:21:36.816
"I now ask for strength and support to overcome the health challenges before me,"

00:21:37.066 --> 00:21:44.991
"for a full and complete recovery and for health and happiness for myself, and the family who I love."

00:21:45.241 --> 00:21:48.286
It's a beautiful prayer.

00:21:48.286 --> 00:21:49.787
One more thing:

00:21:50.580 --> 00:21:55.251
"With appreciation and gratitude for all of my many blessings:"

00:21:55.501 --> 00:21:58.796
"family and health and business success"

00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:02.300
"and the many wonderful people in my life."

00:22:02.342 --> 00:22:05.636
"Please guide me to continue to appreciate these gifts"

00:22:05.678 --> 00:22:10.558
"and share my good fortune and plenty with others in this world."

00:22:10.808 --> 00:22:14.687
"The world is full of infinite possibilities!"

00:22:16.773 --> 00:22:21.736
Nice words and they very naturally express their gratitude to many things,

00:22:22.111 --> 00:22:25.281
and extend their warm hearts to others.

00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:30.703
So thank you very much for your attention, this is my short presentation.
