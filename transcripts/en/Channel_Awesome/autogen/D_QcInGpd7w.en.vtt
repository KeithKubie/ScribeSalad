the cities there go oh and you
immediately see the problem I thought

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110
immediately see the problem I thought
 

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.080
immediately see the problem I thought
that was very quick and very clever to

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090
that was very quick and very clever to
 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.660
that was very quick and very clever to
establish uh you know that just this

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670
establish uh you know that just this
 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.250
establish uh you know that just this
major problem up the two words colliding

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260
major problem up the two words colliding
 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.110
major problem up the two words colliding
and we said you know this is I'm sure

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120
and we said you know this is I'm sure
 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.580
and we said you know this is I'm sure
this is going to be a thing the two

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590
this is going to be a thing the two
 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.900
this is going to be a thing the two
worlds colliding it's going to be tough

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910
worlds colliding it's going to be tough
 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.090
worlds colliding it's going to be tough
and that's gonna be the focus of the

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:39.100
and that's gonna be the focus of the
 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:40.650
and that's gonna be the focus of the
next season you know and I was looking

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660
next season you know and I was looking
 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.650
next season you know and I was looking
forward to that um and then it kind of

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660
forward to that um and then it kind of
 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.289
forward to that um and then it kind of
takes a different turn in a sense it's

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299
takes a different turn in a sense it's
 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.500
takes a different turn in a sense it's
and I'm very mixed about it it's like

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510
and I'm very mixed about it it's like
 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.050
and I'm very mixed about it it's like
because they're getting out of the city

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060
because they're getting out of the city
 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.210
because they're getting out of the city
which is like great because we spent two

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220
which is like great because we spent two
 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.830
which is like great because we spent two
seasons in that city has a beautiful

seasons in that city has a beautiful
 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.660
seasons in that city has a beautiful
city but I'm I'm kind of done with it

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.320
and it was also funny is when they're
travelling trying to convince people to

00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:38.330
travelling trying to convince people to
 

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:41.290

00:16:44.350 --> 00:16:44.360
skateboard Feynman by the end of their
 

00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.590
skateboard Feynman by the end of their
eyes and it gets more and more sad by

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600
eyes and it gets more and more sad by
 

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:50.080
eyes and it gets more and more sad by
the end and I was realizing that is I

00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:50.090
the end and I was realizing that is I
 

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:52.090
the end and I was realizing that is I
think a big part what I was missing in -

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:52.100
think a big part what I was missing in -
 

00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:55.330
think a big part what I was missing in -
in season 2 that was in season 1 but

00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:55.340
in season 2 that was in season 1 but
 

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:59.710
in season 2 that was in season 1 but
night not as much even here uh which is

00:16:59.710 --> 00:16:59.720
night not as much even here uh which is
 

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.080
night not as much even here uh which is
the group in all these characters to get

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:02.090
the group in all these characters to get
 

00:17:02.090 --> 00:17:03.520
the group in all these characters to get
these characters you really like are

00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:03.530
these characters you really like are
 

00:17:03.530 --> 00:17:05.410
these characters you really like are
together and they're working off each

00:17:05.410 --> 00:17:05.420
together and they're working off each
 

00:17:05.420 --> 00:17:06.730
together and they're working off each
other and they're interacting I'm sorry

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:06.740
other and they're interacting I'm sorry
 

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:08.350
other and they're interacting I'm sorry

00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360
thinking about like how often did you
 

00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.689
thinking about like how often did you
see just all of them go on an adventure

00:17:10.689 --> 00:17:10.699
see just all of them go on an adventure
 

00:17:10.699 --> 00:17:13.120
see just all of them go on an adventure
all of them go somewhere you really did

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:13.130
all of them go somewhere you really did
 

00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:16.090
all of them go somewhere you really did
part of it too is how much time was

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:16.100
part of it too is how much time was
 

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.640
part of it too is how much time was
wasted rehashing the same stuff in

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:18.650
wasted rehashing the same stuff in
 

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.939
wasted rehashing the same stuff in
season 2 yeah I mean I get what happened

00:17:21.939 --> 00:17:21.949
season 2 yeah I mean I get what happened

00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:23.900
I think they got under the wire they
 

00:17:23.900 --> 00:17:25.569
I think they got under the wire they
they had planned for one season almost

00:17:25.569 --> 00:17:25.579
they had planned for one season almost
 

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:26.890
they had planned for one season almost
and they're like crap and you have to

00:17:26.890 --> 00:17:26.900
and they're like crap and you have to
 

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.120
and they're like crap and you have to
basically almost just come up with

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:28.130
basically almost just come up with
 

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.470
basically almost just come up with
filler because you're just like I don't

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480
filler because you're just like I don't
 

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.450
filler because you're just like I don't

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:32.750
they've worked out and I'm hoping
 

00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:34.360
they've worked out and I'm hoping
this'll last because it seems to me at

00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:34.370
this'll last because it seems to me at
 

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:35.650
this'll last because it seems to me at
least by these first three episodes

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:35.660
least by these first three episodes
 

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.510
least by these first three episodes
they've worked out the kinks like okay

00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520

we've got the groove we've got whatever
 

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:43.360
we've got the groove we've got whatever
but the writing in these three episodes

00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:43.370
but the writing in these three episodes
 

00:17:43.370 --> 00:17:46.780
but the writing in these three episodes
compared to season two is really tight

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:46.790
compared to season two is really tight
 

00:17:46.790 --> 00:17:50.140
compared to season two is really tight

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.110
ton but the way they intercut that with
 

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:58.330
ton but the way they intercut that with
breaking the other villains loose with

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:58.340
breaking the other villains loose with
 

00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:00.310

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:06.680
really happening and paste it in such a
 

00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.560
really happening and paste it in such a
way that it's still really interesting

00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:08.570
way that it's still really interesting
 

00:18:08.570 --> 00:18:09.730
