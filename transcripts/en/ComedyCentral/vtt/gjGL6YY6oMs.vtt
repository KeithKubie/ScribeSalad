(electronic skittering)

00:00:04.637 --> 00:00:05.905 align:start size:84% position:16%
(audience cheering)
- Welcome back.

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:07.607
My guest tonight,
she's an advocate

00:00:07.607 --> 00:00:09.642
for girls' access to
education worldwide,

00:00:09.642 --> 00:00:11.978
is the youngest person
ever to be nominated

00:00:11.978 --> 00:00:13.179
for a Nobel Peace Prize.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.115 align:start size:84% position:16%
Her new book is
called I Am Malala:

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.549
The Girl Who Stood
Up For Education

00:00:16.549 --> 00:00:18.184
And Was Shot By The Taliban.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:19.285
Please welcome to the program

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:20.920
Malala Yousafzai.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:21.855
(rousing orchestral music)

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:25.859
(audience applause and cheering)

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:34.934
- Nice to see you.

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:35.935
- Thank you.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:40.607
- Thank you for being here.

00:00:40.607 --> 00:00:41.441
- Thank you so much.

00:00:41.441 --> 00:00:43.176
It's an honor for me.

00:00:43.176 --> 00:00:44.811
- It is an honor for us.

00:00:44.811 --> 00:00:47.914
I know me. (laughter)

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.416
This is--

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:53.219 align:start size:97% position:3%
By the way, we talked a
little bit before the show.

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.322
Nothing feels better
than making you laugh.

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:57.824
I will say that.

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.359 align:start size:94% position:6%
I enjoyed that very much.
- (laughs) Thank you.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.493
- I Am Malala.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:06.699 align:start size:84% position:16%
It's honestly
humbling to meet you.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:07.534
You're 16.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.739
Where did your love for
education come from?

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:18.011 line:0%
- We are human beings,
and this is the part

00:01:18.011 --> 00:01:20.480 line:0%
of our human nature,
that we don't learn

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.215 line:0%
the importance of anything

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:24.484 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
until it's snatched
from our hands.

00:01:24.484 --> 00:01:26.586 align:start size:84% position:16%
And when, in
Pakistan, when we were

00:01:26.586 --> 00:01:29.289
stopped from going to
school, at that time,

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.659 align:start size:88% position:13%
I realize that education
is very important,

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.161 align:start size:84% position:16%
and education is
the power for women;

00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:38.064 align:start size:97% position:3%
and that's why the terrorists
are afraid of education.

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:40.400 align:start size:84% position:16%
They do not want
women to get education

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.070 align:start size:88% position:13%
because then women would
become more powerful.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.906 align:start size:84% position:16%
(audience applause)
- Exactly.

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.074
Exactly right.

00:01:52.512 --> 00:01:55.815
When did the Taliban
come to Swat Valley?

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:58.451 align:start size:84% position:16%
Because before then,
you describe it

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.420
as a paradise, of sorts.

00:02:01.588 --> 00:02:04.157 line:0%
- The Taliban came in
2004, but at that time,

00:02:04.157 --> 00:02:05.058 line:0%
they were quite good.

00:02:05.058 --> 00:02:06.593 line:0%
They did not show their,

00:02:06.593 --> 00:02:08.862 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
the terrorism and
they did not blast any

00:02:08.862 --> 00:02:10.396 line:0%
school at that time.

00:02:10.396 --> 00:02:13.466 line:0%
But they started the
real terrorism in 2007.

00:02:13.466 --> 00:02:16.302
They have blasted more
than 400 schools in Swat.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:17.437
They have slaughtered people,

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:20.273
and in the month
of January 2009,

00:02:20.273 --> 00:02:22.408
they used to slaughter
even two, three people

00:02:22.408 --> 00:02:24.878
every night, and they
have flogged women.

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:26.613
We have seen the
barbaric situation

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:29.949
of the 21st century,
and we have seen...

00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:34.554 align:start size:97% position:3%
the cruelty, and we have
seen harsh days in our life;

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:37.690 align:start size:97% position:3%
and those we regarded as the
darkest days of our life.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.094
So it was really hard
for us at that time.

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:44.197
- You describe, in the book,

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:46.032
still, no matter what,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.503 align:start size:84% position:16%
they took the signs
off of schools.

00:02:50.503 --> 00:02:53.039
They went underground.

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:56.209
But they continued
in the face of--

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.146
You spoke out publicly
against the Taliban.

00:03:00.146 --> 00:03:03.650 align:start size:94% position:6%
What gave you the
courage to continue this?

00:03:04.918 --> 00:03:08.087 line:0%
- You know, my father was great

00:03:08.087 --> 00:03:11.191 line:0%
encouragement for me,
because he spoke of,

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.692 line:0%
he spoke out for women's rights.

00:03:12.692 --> 00:03:14.861 line:0%
He spoke out for
girls' education.

00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:17.430
At that time, I said
that, "Why shall I wait

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.898
"for someone else?

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:20.934 align:start size:88% position:13%
"Why shall I be looking
to the government,

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:22.902
"to the army, that
they would help us?

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.737
"Why don't I raise my voice?

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:27.040
"Why don't we speak
up for our rights?"

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.642 align:start size:94% position:6%
The girls of Swat, they
spoke up for their rights.

00:03:29.642 --> 00:03:32.378 align:start size:88% position:13%
I started writing
diary, I spoke on every

00:03:32.378 --> 00:03:35.048 align:start size:97% position:3%
media channel that I could,
and I raised my voice

00:03:35.048 --> 00:03:37.183
on every platform that I could.

00:03:37.183 --> 00:03:39.185
And I said, "I need
to tell the world

00:03:39.185 --> 00:03:40.753
"what is happening in Swat;

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:42.188 align:start size:84% position:16%
"and I need to
tell the world that

00:03:42.188 --> 00:03:44.023 align:start size:81% position:19%
"Swat is suffering
from terrorism,

00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:46.659
"and we need to fight
against terrorism."

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:48.761
- When did you realize...

00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:52.999 align:start size:81% position:19%
the Taliban had
made you a target?

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:58.037
- When, in 2012, we were--

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:00.807 align:start size:84% position:16%
I was with my father,
and someone came,

00:04:00.807 --> 00:04:04.110 align:start size:88% position:13%
and she told us that,
"Have you seen on Google

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.179
"that if you search your name,

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:07.947
"the Taliban have
threatened you?"

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:09.682
And I just could not believe it.

00:04:09.682 --> 00:04:11.651
I said, "No, it's not true."

00:04:11.651 --> 00:04:14.020 align:start size:88% position:13%
And even after that
threat, when we saw it,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.155 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was not worried
about myself that much.

00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:17.857
I was worried about my father,

00:04:17.857 --> 00:04:20.126 align:start size:88% position:13%
because we thought that
the Taliban are not

00:04:20.126 --> 00:04:22.829 align:start size:88% position:13%
that much cruel, that
they would kill a child,

00:04:22.829 --> 00:04:25.031
because I was 14 at that time.

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:27.867
But then later on,
I used to start--

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:29.702
I started thinking about that,

00:04:29.702 --> 00:04:31.471 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I used to think
that the Talib

00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:34.574
would come, and he
would just kill me.

00:04:34.574 --> 00:04:36.009
But then I said, "If he comes,

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.611
"what would you do, Malala?"

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:40.446
Then I would reply myself that,

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:42.348
"Malala, just take
a shoe and hit him;"

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:45.685
but then I said... (laughter)

00:04:45.685 --> 00:04:47.420
But then I said,
"If you hit a Talib

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.855
"with your shoe,
then there would be

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:51.591 align:start size:84% position:16%
"no difference between
you and the Talib.

00:04:51.591 --> 00:04:53.926
"You must not treat
others that much

00:04:53.926 --> 00:04:56.162
"with cruelty, and
that much harshly.

00:04:56.162 --> 00:04:58.665 align:start size:88% position:13%
"You must fight others,
but through peace

00:04:58.665 --> 00:05:00.533
"and through dialogue,
and through education."

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:02.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
Then I said, "I'll
tell him how important

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:04.904
"education is, and
that I even want

00:05:04.904 --> 00:05:07.507
"education for your
children as well;"

00:05:07.507 --> 00:05:10.076 align:start size:97% position:3%
and I would tell him, "that's
what I want to tell you.

00:05:10.076 --> 00:05:11.811
"Now do what you want."

00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:15.915
(audience applause and cheering)

00:05:21.287 --> 00:05:22.121
- Um.

00:05:24.257 --> 00:05:25.591
I wanna ask you.

00:05:28.695 --> 00:05:31.497
I know your father is backstage,

00:05:31.497 --> 00:05:33.333
and he's very proud of you.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.168
But would he be mad...

00:05:36.035 --> 00:05:37.603
If I adopted you?

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:39.839
(laughter)

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:44.043
Because you sure are swell.

00:05:45.211 --> 00:05:46.346 line:0%
Could you stick around?

00:05:46.346 --> 00:05:48.448 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
I wanna talk a
little bit more about

00:05:48.448 --> 00:05:52.752 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
Swat Valley and what it
was like growing up there,

00:05:52.752 --> 00:05:57.256 align:start position:0% line:0%
and how people can get involved
through the Malala Fund,

00:05:57.256 --> 00:05:58.491 line:0%
and those types of things.

00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.693 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
Do you have a
little bit of time?

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:01.627
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:02.495
- That would be wonderful.

00:06:02.495 --> 00:06:03.730
Thank you so much.

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.531 align:start size:84% position:16%

(rousing orchestral music)

00:06:21.814 --> 00:06:22.982
(audience applause)

00:06:22.982 --> 00:06:24.484 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Wonderful to
listen to you talk.

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:26.386
We're back: we're
talking to Malala.

00:06:26.386 --> 00:06:29.655
The book I Am Malala is
on shelves right now.

00:06:29.655 --> 00:06:33.826
Your love of school reminds
me so much of my children.

00:06:35.862 --> 00:06:38.131
(laughter)

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:43.936
Okay, maybe not.

00:06:46.706 --> 00:06:48.908
The people of Swat Valley.

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:51.077
When the Talib first came,

00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:55.047 align:start size:84% position:16%
they thought they're
bringing order.

00:06:56.115 --> 00:06:58.551
They're bringing services.

00:06:58.551 --> 00:07:01.821
They established a
court that was faster

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:05.958 align:start size:84% position:16%
than Pakistani courts.
- Yeah.

00:07:05.958 --> 00:07:08.227
- And the people responded.

00:07:10.329 --> 00:07:12.665
When did that begin to turn?

00:07:14.066 --> 00:07:16.369 align:start size:97% position:3%
- When the Taliban came,
they were trying to convince

00:07:16.369 --> 00:07:19.138
people, and they were just
misusing the name of Islam,

00:07:19.138 --> 00:07:21.674 align:start size:97% position:3%
and they were telling
people, "We will just set up

00:07:21.674 --> 00:07:23.976
"another court for you,
and we will provide you

00:07:23.976 --> 00:07:26.646 align:start size:94% position:6%
"justice on time;"
because usually, in courts

00:07:26.646 --> 00:07:30.783 align:start size:84% position:16%
in Pakistan, people
dies and their case is

00:07:30.783 --> 00:07:34.220
not yet resolving in the courts.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.956
So that's what is happening
in the courts of Pakistan.

00:07:36.956 --> 00:07:40.259 align:start size:97% position:3%
So people just said like,
"If the Taliban are doing it,

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:41.994
"why don't we support them?"

00:07:41.994 --> 00:07:45.198
But then they were
that much crueler.

00:07:45.198 --> 00:07:47.300 align:start size:84% position:16%
They started
slaughtering people,

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.804
and they even blasted a
generator of electricity

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:54.507 align:start position:0%
and it was the month of
Ramadan, in which we keep fast,

00:07:54.507 --> 00:07:55.975
in which we don't
eat on the day,

00:07:55.975 --> 00:07:59.011 align:start size:88% position:13%
in which we don't drink
for the whole day.

00:07:59.011 --> 00:08:01.380 align:start size:88% position:13%
They blasted the
electricity generators,

00:08:01.380 --> 00:08:02.782
which was providing electricity

00:08:02.782 --> 00:08:05.384
to the whole city of Mingora;

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:07.854
and we could not have
water because it is,

00:08:07.854 --> 00:08:10.890 align:start size:88% position:13%
electricity's related
to water supply as well.

00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.826 align:start size:84% position:16%
And people were
sitting in the dark,

00:08:13.826 --> 00:08:16.362
people could not buy
electricity generators,

00:08:16.362 --> 00:08:19.398
people were just sitting
in the light of candles,

00:08:19.398 --> 00:08:22.568 align:start size:94% position:6%
and people were just dying
of thirst at that time.

00:08:22.568 --> 00:08:24.170
But my father is a great father,

00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:27.006 align:start size:88% position:13%
because he bought
generator for the school

00:08:27.006 --> 00:08:29.642
to create electricity and

00:08:29.642 --> 00:08:32.345
to provide water to the street

00:08:32.345 --> 00:08:35.014
and to that community, but still

00:08:35.014 --> 00:08:37.416
many people were suffering from

00:08:37.416 --> 00:08:40.520
that hard situation;
and other than that,

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.855 align:start size:97% position:3%
our freedom was taken from us.
- [Jon] Yes.

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:44.323
- The women's freedom.

00:08:44.323 --> 00:08:46.058
We could not go to market,

00:08:46.058 --> 00:08:48.694
we were not allowed
to go to school,

00:08:48.694 --> 00:08:50.997
we were just kept imprisoned.

00:08:50.997 --> 00:08:54.634
We were just limited to the
four walls of our house.

00:08:54.634 --> 00:08:56.769
Women's rights were
denied at that time,

00:08:56.769 --> 00:08:58.304
and that's why I spoke.

00:08:58.304 --> 00:08:59.772
Because I believe in equality,

00:08:59.772 --> 00:09:01.641 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I believe that
there is no difference

00:09:01.641 --> 00:09:03.576
between a man and a woman.

00:09:03.576 --> 00:09:06.712
I even believe that a woman
is more powerful than men.

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:07.980
- What, wait! Whoa!
(women cheering)

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.815
Wait, what? What?
(Malala laughing)

00:09:09.815 --> 00:09:10.650
I-- wait!

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:18.457 align:start size:84% position:16%
(whistling)
You know, Malala...

00:09:19.792 --> 00:09:23.896 align:start size:88% position:13%
This was going so well.
(laughter)

00:09:23.896 --> 00:09:26.399
You were doing so beautifully,

00:09:27.833 --> 00:09:29.769
and then suddenly, bam!

00:09:32.004 --> 00:09:34.840
This is the part that they,

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.944
they began to say,
"You cannot dance.

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:42.081 align:start size:72% position:28%
- Yeah.
- "You cannot,

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.317
"the women cannot
do these things."

00:09:44.317 --> 00:09:48.054 align:start size:88% position:13%
You say that many people
believe this is a...

00:09:49.555 --> 00:09:53.225
wrong interpretation
of Islam, of the Koran.

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:58.898
Why have the Taliban,

00:09:58.898 --> 00:10:00.733
and these more extreme groups,

00:10:00.733 --> 00:10:03.336
been able to be successful?

00:10:03.336 --> 00:10:07.173 align:start size:88% position:13%
Is it the fear that they
bring to these towns?

00:10:08.874 --> 00:10:13.045
Is that why the people have had
a hard time throwing it off?

00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:16.716 align:start size:94% position:6%
- The first thing is that,
they were really cruel.

00:10:16.716 --> 00:10:19.619 align:start size:97% position:3%
They had Kalashnikovs, they
had guns in their hand.

00:10:19.619 --> 00:10:20.886
And if I have a gun in my hand,

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:22.688 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I tell you
something, 'do this,'

00:10:22.688 --> 00:10:26.325 align:start size:97% position:3%
you have to do that,
because it's for your life.

00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:28.027
So there was fear all around.

00:10:28.027 --> 00:10:30.529 align:start size:88% position:13%
That's why people
could not say anything.

00:10:30.529 --> 00:10:32.331
Then the second thing
was that they were

00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:34.033
misusing the name of Islam.

00:10:34.033 --> 00:10:35.001
They were telling people that

00:10:35.001 --> 00:10:36.268
"We are doing this for Islam,

00:10:36.268 --> 00:10:37.737
"we are doing this for Allah,

00:10:37.737 --> 00:10:40.006 align:start size:97% position:3%
"we are doing this for
Prophet, peace be upon him."

00:10:40.006 --> 00:10:41.774
So essentially, they
were using religion

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:43.743
for their own personal benefit.

00:10:43.743 --> 00:10:45.711
That's also the reason.

00:10:45.711 --> 00:10:49.715
But then later on, people
tried to realize this,

00:10:49.715 --> 00:10:51.951
and the girls are very brave.

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:53.719 align:start size:84% position:16%
And girls in our
school, like we were

00:10:53.719 --> 00:10:56.022 align:start size:88% position:13%
at that time, we were
just 11 or 12 years old.

00:10:56.022 --> 00:10:58.658 align:start size:97% position:3%
But we spoke up for our
rights to every media channel,

00:10:58.658 --> 00:11:00.893 align:start size:81% position:19%
to every newspaper
that we could.

00:11:00.893 --> 00:11:03.596
And we did not know at that
time that our small interview

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:06.065
would have an impact
or not, but it had.

00:11:06.065 --> 00:11:08.467 align:start size:84% position:16%
Because we were
raising up our voice

00:11:08.467 --> 00:11:10.302
and we were speaking
up for our rights.

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:12.038
And we were speaking
for peace in Swat.

00:11:12.038 --> 00:11:13.773
We wanted to live a normal life,

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:16.409
because Swat is like
a paradise on Earth.

00:11:16.409 --> 00:11:19.311
I believe in two paradises:

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:21.047
one I'll get after death,

00:11:21.047 --> 00:11:23.115
but the other one
that is on Earth,

00:11:23.115 --> 00:11:24.350
for me, that is Swat,

00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:26.318
because Swat is
really beautiful,

00:11:26.318 --> 00:11:28.788 align:start size:88% position:13%
and you would be
astonished when you see

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.356 align:start size:84% position:16%
the lush green hills,
and when you see

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:33.492
the tall mountains, and
the rivers that we have,

00:11:33.492 --> 00:11:36.796
the crystal-clear water,
and you can find trout,

00:11:36.796 --> 00:11:39.465 align:start size:94% position:6%
so it's really beautiful:
you'll love Swat.

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:41.600
- Malala, I'm from New Jersey.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:45.471 align:start size:88% position:13%
(laughter and cheering)
So...

00:11:45.471 --> 00:11:47.540 align:start size:94% position:6%
I know a little
something about paradise.

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.576
(laughter)
The beaches--

00:11:50.576 --> 00:11:53.245 align:start size:84% position:16%
It does, it sounds
magnificent, and it's,

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:57.383
it is heartbreaking,
because you see what

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.919
these children want, and
what these people want,

00:11:59.919 --> 00:12:01.854
is to just live in peace

00:12:03.389 --> 00:12:06.358
without having this
imposed on them.

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:08.294 align:start size:75% position:25%
- Yeah.
- And I think--

00:12:09.662 --> 00:12:12.732 align:start size:81% position:19%
We don't know what
to do to help.

00:12:12.732 --> 00:12:15.367
You know, there are
passages in the book

00:12:15.367 --> 00:12:18.137
about the United States.

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:22.508 align:start size:84% position:16%
And we come out great.
(laughter)

00:12:22.508 --> 00:12:25.111
But there is, there are attacks

00:12:26.278 --> 00:12:29.682
in Swat and in those
areas with drones,

00:12:29.682 --> 00:12:32.952
and they talk about
a man, a CIA agent,

00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:37.189
who shot two men in Lahore.

00:12:37.189 --> 00:12:38.624
Raymond--
- Davis.

00:12:41.327 --> 00:12:42.495
- And this is,

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:46.799
I think we have a common want

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:48.734
and desire, but perhaps

00:12:49.802 --> 00:12:51.904
are not accomplishing it

00:12:51.904 --> 00:12:55.074
in the manner that
shows the people...

00:12:56.642 --> 00:12:59.011
how we feel; but in some ways,

00:12:59.011 --> 00:13:01.447
we don't know what else to do.

00:13:02.848 --> 00:13:06.051
What is your thought on that?

00:13:06.051 --> 00:13:10.623
- I think that the people of
America, the United States,

00:13:10.623 --> 00:13:14.326 align:start size:88% position:13%
they truly support
peace, and they say that

00:13:14.326 --> 00:13:17.096 align:start size:94% position:6%
"We must not fight
against war through war."

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:19.498 align:start size:94% position:6%
They believe that
dialogue is the best way.

00:13:19.498 --> 00:13:21.901 align:start size:88% position:13%
And we must try to
find a solution for it.

00:13:21.901 --> 00:13:25.571
And in my opinion, the
solution that would work

00:13:25.571 --> 00:13:27.740
to fight all these wars
and all these problems

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:30.943 align:start size:88% position:13%
that people are facing,
is only education.

00:13:30.943 --> 00:13:33.145
Because you can--

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.647
you can stop war for a second,

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.550 align:start size:94% position:6%
but you don't know it
would start again or not.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:38.684
We have seen First World War,

00:13:38.684 --> 00:13:40.019
we have seen Second World War,

00:13:40.019 --> 00:13:41.987 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I think Third
World War is coming;

00:13:41.987 --> 00:13:45.524
but I believe that
we must stop it now.

00:13:45.524 --> 00:13:49.895 align:start size:97% position:3%
I don't want to see a Third
World War in this world again.

00:13:49.895 --> 00:13:52.164 align:start size:97% position:3%
And the best way to fight
against this war is education

00:13:52.164 --> 00:13:55.868 align:start size:94% position:6%
because, as we can see,
the children are suffering

00:13:55.868 --> 00:13:58.370
from terrorism, they are
suffering from child labor

00:13:58.370 --> 00:13:59.605
and child trafficking.

00:13:59.605 --> 00:14:01.273
They are also suffering from

00:14:01.273 --> 00:14:02.842 align:start size:81% position:19%
the cultural norms
and tradition.

00:14:02.842 --> 00:14:04.510
These are, there is
not only one issue

00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.945
that we are facing through.

00:14:05.945 --> 00:14:07.980
There are many others as well.

00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.716 align:start size:84% position:16%
So I think education
is the best way.

00:14:10.716 --> 00:14:12.651 align:start size:88% position:13%
People will be thinking,
just going to school,

00:14:12.651 --> 00:14:14.620
learning about chemistry,
and physics, and maths,

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.455
and that's it.

00:14:16.455 --> 00:14:18.490 align:start size:84% position:16%
Going to school is not
only learning about

00:14:18.490 --> 00:14:21.227 align:start size:94% position:6%
different subjects: it
teaches you communication,

00:14:21.227 --> 00:14:23.796 align:start size:94% position:6%
it teaches you how to live
a life, it teaches you

00:14:23.796 --> 00:14:26.999
about history, it teaches you
about how science is working.

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:29.869 align:start size:88% position:13%
And other than that, you
learn about equality;

00:14:29.869 --> 00:14:32.571 align:start size:94% position:6%
because students are
provided the same benches,

00:14:32.571 --> 00:14:35.274
they sit equally, it
shows us equality,

00:14:35.274 --> 00:14:39.011
it teaches students how to
live with others together,

00:14:39.011 --> 00:14:40.746
how to accept each
other's language,

00:14:40.746 --> 00:14:42.448
how to accept each
other's traditions

00:14:42.448 --> 00:14:44.250
and each other's religion.

00:14:44.250 --> 00:14:46.118
It also teaches us justice.

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:48.888
It also teaches us respect.

00:14:48.888 --> 00:14:50.789
It teaches us how
to live together.

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:52.958
So that's why I support the,

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:56.095 align:start size:97% position:3%
I support the idea of
sending children to school,

00:14:56.095 --> 00:14:58.664
because it is the best
way to fight terrorism.

00:14:58.664 --> 00:15:01.734 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I want people to
support us in this cause,

00:15:01.734 --> 00:15:03.502 align:start size:97% position:3%
and through Malala
Foundation, we want to work

00:15:03.502 --> 00:15:07.106
for education of girls in
the developing countries,

00:15:07.106 --> 00:15:08.540
especially in Syria now.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:10.442 align:start size:84% position:16%
They are suffering,
they are homeless now.

00:15:10.442 --> 00:15:12.211 align:start size:88% position:13%
We want to help
children in Afghanistan,

00:15:12.211 --> 00:15:15.915 align:start position:0%
because they have been suffering
from terrorism for decades.

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:17.850 align:start size:94% position:6%
We want to help the
children of India as well,

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:20.052 align:start size:88% position:13%
because they are
victims of child labor.

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:22.321
So I think issues and
problems are enormous;

00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:24.757
but solution is one,
and that is simple.

00:15:24.757 --> 00:15:26.926
That is education.

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:27.860
(Jon stammering)

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.195
(audience applause and cheering)

00:15:30.195 --> 00:15:31.630
- I am humbled.

00:15:31.630 --> 00:15:34.533
Humbled, to speak with you.

00:15:34.533 --> 00:15:37.202 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Thank you.
- I will say this.

00:15:37.202 --> 00:15:39.972
I don't know where you
come from, (laughter)

00:15:39.972 --> 00:15:42.308
but I am very glad you're here.

00:15:42.308 --> 00:15:43.642
Thank you for being here today.

00:15:43.642 --> 00:15:44.476
(audience applause and cheering)

00:15:44.476 --> 00:15:45.311
You're wonderful.

00:15:45.311 --> 00:15:47.112
Please, get the book,

00:15:47.112 --> 00:15:48.414
