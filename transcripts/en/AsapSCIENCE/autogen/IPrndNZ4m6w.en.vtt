00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.180
 We all love spice in our meals 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.700
 But do you know that 129 teaspoons of hot pepper may kill you 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.740
 The concern is that even a teaspoon of nutmeg .. 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.120
 It can cause convulsions, palpitations or nausea or death! 

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.480
 Sugar, of course, is linked to many diseases. 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.840
 For a person weighing 68.18 kilo .. 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.420
 10 cups and a half of sugar at the same time deadly. 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:27.100
 These huge amounts of sugar will trap you with dangerous tooth decay. 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.600
 But do not eat toothpaste. 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.380
 Fluoride is very safe in small quantities and helps fight decay 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.100
 But the consumption of about 24 tubes contains 170 mm 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.515
 Or 0.17 liters of fluoride will be fatal. 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.620
 If you are trying to avoid wrinkles, 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.040
 You should know that 68 ng of Botox is deadly. 

00:00:44.045 --> 00:00:47.355
 Botox is an abbreviation for toxic potassium. 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.340
 Of course, injections use tiny proportions of that amount, 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.380
 Which prevent the burning of nerves and necessary for muscle paralysis. 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.100
 And always advise you to eat fruits and vegetables, 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.200
 However, excessive intake of orange presents you with an overdose of vitamin C. 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.360
 But access to overdose 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.280
 Requires 11 thousand orange. 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.040
 In contrast, 809 of dietary supplements give the same result. 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.120
 If the healthy food will make you alienate him and away do not multiply it. 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.060
 Although our bodies are treated with amazing speed, 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.160
 But it is the opposite with the acceleration completely. 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.115
 Earth revolves around the sun at 1600 kilometers per hour. 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.680
 It does not affect you. 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.400
 But if the earth begins to accelerate at high speed we will feel a tremor. 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.180
 At 14 g of lateral acceleration. 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.760
 Your body members will begin to fade one by one. 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.360
 Quick running activates you. 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.420
 But if the internal temperature reaches 40 degrees Celsius 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.520
 Will be hit by a sunburst leading to death. 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.240
 The sweating keeps the body temperature. 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.000
 But the heat is extreme 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.620
 Causes dry kidneys and brain. 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:46.460
 As a result, 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.260
 They will release harmful bacteria into the bloodstream. 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.080
 And of course if your body's internal temperature drops to more than 21 degrees Celsius 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.140
 Your body will enter a deadly phase due to low temperature 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.180
 Causing veins tightness and low blood flow. 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.540
 All you have to do is focus on heating your internal organs until you return to normal. 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.800
 If you try to see these internal organs, 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.080
 Avoid exposure to 7143 internal x-rays. 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.060
 It is enough cumulative amount of radiation to kill you. 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.680
 This ionizing radiation has enough energy 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.180
 To remove the electrons from the atom. 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.860
 5 impurities of radiation sufficient to kill 50% of the population 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.180
 Such as the nuclear explosion! 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.295
 If you are hiding from a nuclear explosion, 

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:28.015
 Be careful not to eat too many green potatoes in your graves. 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.200
 The green on the crust is actually chlorophyll 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.300
 It is non-toxic 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.960
 But indicates the existence of the poison of Sulanin, 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.940
 It is a defensive way to get rid of pests. 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.120
 You may get sick because of green potatoes, 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.160
 But eating 25 medium-sized tablets, 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.680
 Your life will be at stake! 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.040
 It is necessary for our survival to survive in small doses, 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.100
 It may be fatal at times. Like potassium! 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.800
 Potassium ions are essential for nervous pulse and muscle contractions, 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.840
 In contrast, potassium chloride is used in lethal injection. 

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.080
 You need to eat 480 bananas to reach this lethal amount, 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.440
 But your stomach will explode before you reach this amount! 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.700
 Remember: The dose is poison! 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.500
 If you want more examples of exotic things that can kill you, 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.040

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.660
