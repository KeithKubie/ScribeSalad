00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.929
&gt;&gt; So, I just wanted to thank everyone for
coming.

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:06.879
And also, I'd like to welcome Kate Roberts
to Google.

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:12.450
Kate is the Founder and Director of YouthAIDS
and Five &amp; Alive, two marketing programs implemented

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.460
by the Population Services International (PSI),
where she is a Vice President of Corporate

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.890
Marketing and Communications.
Founded in 2001, YouthAIDS is a global education

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.870
and prevention initiative that uses media,
pop culture, music, theatre and sport to stop

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:34.559
the spread of HIV/AIDS and reach 600 million
young people in more than 60 countries with

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.109
life-saving messages, products, services and
care.

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:45.589
In 2002 YouthAIDS partnered with MTV to produce
the "Staying Alive" concert, a $3 million

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:52.680
production broadcast worldwide and featured
on all major news channels, including CNN.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.449
Other noted productions include an innovative,
celebrity-driven, cause-related marketing

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.249
campaign -- Hear No Evil, See No Evil, Speak
No Evil -- through a partnership with ALDO

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:09.230
Shoes and four award-winning documentaries
aired on VH1, The Discovery Channel and National

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:15.970
Geographic aimed at raising awareness about
the global HIV/AIDS crisis as they follow

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.280
YouthAIDS Global Ambassador Ashley Judd through
the most affected areas of Africa, Central

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.290
America and India.
Roberts has been featured in the Washington

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.390
Post, named “Power Player of the Week”
by Fox News, and celebrated on “CNN Heroes.”

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.130
Kate has also been given the honor of speaking
at the Aspen Ideas Festival and has recently

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:42.410
been awarded “Young Global Leader of the
World 2007” by The World Economic Forum.

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.040
Most recently, Roberts has launched Five &amp; Alive,
an exciting new marketing initiative aimed

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.690
at raising funds and awareness for PSI’s
child survival programs, and has co-founded

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.250
the Global India Fund.
Originally from England, Kate holds a degree

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.450
in Hotel and Catering Management from Southport
University of Art and Technology.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.510
And lastly, we'll be filming this for YouTube.
So during the Q and A, please make sure to

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:11.819
use one of the microphones.
Thanks so much, Kate, for coming.

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.180
Kate Roberts: Thank you.
I realize I'm competing with Octoberfest,

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.689
so I really appreciate you guys being here.
So yeah. I'm Kate Roberts, and I founded YouthAIDS

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:29.120
about ten years ago.
And what I've decided to do today is try to

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.170
tell you the story of building this brand.
I don't know if you are marketeers and that's

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:43.459
what you want to hear, but I figured by telling
my story, it might really highlight in a different

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:51.230
way how we actually do development differently.
In fact, I was telling Laura over lunch that

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:59.060
I'm reading a book right now called "Fred.”
And it's all about a guy who's a postman.

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:05.489
And it's all about his passion that he's turned
his life around even though he's a postman.

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:12.079
But he found a passion in his life that made
an ordinary life very, very exciting.

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:16.950
And I think that I can say that about myself.
I have a very, very ordinary life -- or at

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.909
least had a very ordinary life -- and now
my life is very, very interesting and exciting.

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:28.739
So I'm here to tell that story.
I am technically challenged, so I really apologize

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:37.659
for anything that goes wrong with this presentation.
Well, first of all, my journey to do this

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:44.219
work started with a bet.
And I'm going to get into why that was, but

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:48.719
first of all to give you a little bit of background
on what I used to do.

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:55.529
I was in advertising for many, many years
working for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, an advertising

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:59.740
agency in Eastern Europe.
I lived pretty much all over the world.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:03.230
I grew up on a ship.
My father's a sea captain.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:08.180
So I spent my early years traveling around
the world exploring different cultures and

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:15.980
religions and seeing a lot of poverty along
the way, but decided to go into for-profit

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.060
work working in advertising, which took me
to Eastern Europe.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.560
I went to live in Russia.
I headed up the Eastern European operations,

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:37.090
and had a number of big adventures.
Had a run-in with the Russian Mafia, and both

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:46.949
being kidnapped several times and having adventures
in Russia led me to have to escape the country.

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:59.150
So I fled from Russia about 13 years ago,
and found my way to Romania to again work

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:06.050
for Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.
And my focus was cigarettes and alcohol and

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:10.430
bubble gum, and all things that kids really
liked.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:15.259
And it was my job to come up with strategies
of how to get them to smoke more cigarettes

00:05:15.259 --> 00:05:20.930
and eat more bubble gum and drink more soda
pop and whiskey and all the things that were

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.620
destroying their health.
And I have to tell you that I didn't really

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.159
have a problem with that.
And I was kind of good at it.

00:05:29.159 --> 00:05:35.509
And I had the first-class-ticket lifestyle
where I was able to travel all over the world

00:05:35.509 --> 00:05:41.789
and buy nice clothes and buy nice shoes.
And I had a shoe passion -- very expensive

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:47.199
one.
And I was going along my merry way in Romania.

00:05:47.199 --> 00:05:52.440
Actually, I don't know whether you know much
about Romania, but it's a very small country,

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:59.300
used to be Communist, and what struck me about
the country was, it was a very passionate

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.720
country, but there was very little resources
for youth.

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:11.800
There was no real parties or action or color
or fashion.

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:20.220
And what I decided to do in Romania was to
tap into my world of pop culture and bring

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:28.350
that to my for-profit clients who were paying
me a lot of money to do their marketing.

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:39.330
So, along my way of doing these outrageous
promotions, I was approached by a very innovative

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:47.379
and impressive man, Michael Holscher, who
was representing an organization called PSI,

00:06:47.379 --> 00:06:53.419
Population Services International, for Romania.
And he'd read about me in the media of doing

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:59.680
these rave parties and cigarette campaigns
and working for Coca-Cola and various different

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.310
brands.
And he simply asked me if I would lend my

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:12.310
time to helping him develop the first AIDS
campaign in Romania.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:18.330
And immediately, I thought to myself, "Hmm.
Well, this might be interesting.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.190
Maybe this will lead to some award of some
sort.”

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:28.290
And certainly didn't think at the time how
this could serve the population of Romania

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:34.419
well.
And we went on -- I agreed -- and the issue

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:39.990
was that PSI Romania didn't have a lot of
funds to develop the campaign.

00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:47.639
So I looked into what I was doing with my
for-profit clients, and thought, "I could

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:55.030
go to those different companies to get the
resources necessary to launch this campaign.”

00:07:55.030 --> 00:08:01.759
So we came across an idea called, "In Bed
with You.”

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:09.530
And we had this big, red, shiny bed that would
travel around to different places to really

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:15.289
get the issue of HIV out there.
And we would invite various rock stars and

00:08:15.289 --> 00:08:22.090
musicians and actors and actresses to get
into bed with young people to talk about their

00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:28.849
first sexual experience and all the issues
that face young people around reproductive

00:08:28.849 --> 00:08:32.390
health and their first sexual encounters and
safe sex.

00:08:32.390 --> 00:08:38.950
So we developed this campaign, "In Bed with
You," and we were really able to harness the

00:08:38.950 --> 00:08:42.490
resources that were in Romania -- we actually
had the launch party in a brothel.

00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:50.720
And which, of course, was very risky in those
times, but we were able to bring in all the

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:59.260
big TV stations, all the different media outlets.
And we launched one of the first condoms in

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:04.959
Romania.
And, within a year, we had managed to increase

00:09:04.959 --> 00:09:10.850
condom use by a hundred percent.
So I got the bug.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:16.570
And we were really looking at different innovative
ways of delivering this message and getting

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.870
these condoms into the hands of people who
needed them the most.

00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:25.380
And, of course, it was exhausting.
I became quite obsessed with the campaign

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:30.240
and decided that I needed to really think
about my direction of what I was doing with

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:35.339
my life.
So I went off to Africa, and really just to

00:09:35.339 --> 00:09:39.829
rest.
Immediately on landing in South Africa, I

00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:48.370
went to a township to -- really, I was interested
in the country, in the culture, and I noticed

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:52.950
that on really every corner, there was a funeral
or a graveyard.

00:09:52.950 --> 00:09:59.810
And I just felt something was amiss.
And on asking the local people, they told

00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:04.670
me it was AIDS.
It was HIV, and the stigma that surrounded

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:09.860
it was so powerful that people weren't even
admitting that their family members had died

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.970
of AIDS.
And at that moment, it struck me, "Well, why

00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:19.220
can't we do here in Africa what we are doing
in Romania?

00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:26.490
In such an innovative way of tapping into
the private sector and using the built-in

00:10:26.490 --> 00:10:32.170
resources and infrastructure in that country
to deliver these much-needed messages about

00:10:32.170 --> 00:10:38.930
stigma and discrimination and condom use in
a much more effective way.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:44.449
And not only do that, but to bring these extra
resources to the issue.

00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:49.250
To bring Hollywood, to bring corporations,
to get corporate money, and to really expand

00:10:49.250 --> 00:10:58.910
on what is already happening in that country.”
So back in Romania, I returned very quickly,

00:10:58.910 --> 00:11:06.180
very excited, very, very excited that I had
sort of got this vision of what I wanted to

00:11:06.180 --> 00:11:09.560
do.
And I was actually very excited with the thought

00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:15.339
that I might be able to leave the private
sector and do something worthwhile with my

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:20.149
life.
So, on arriving back to Romania, we -- a couple

00:11:20.149 --> 00:11:23.260
of things that we did were -- and these are
the "Love Police.”

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:30.029
The Love Police go down to the Black Sea Coast,
and arrest people on the beach who are not

00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:33.970
carrying condoms.
And with their ticket, they get a condom.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:40.220
So we have these Love Police all over Romania,
arresting people.

00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:48.860
Again, a different innovative way of delivering
this message. So, PSI.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:55.220
So obviously, I found out then from my friend
and mentor, Michael Holscher, that PSI was

00:11:55.220 --> 00:12:00.949
not just in Romania -- that PSI was all over
the world -- actually in 40 countries.

00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:07.990
And he told me that PSI was a very successful,
global health organization that predominantly

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:17.120
focused on getting government funding.
And perhaps PSI would be open to hearing about

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:22.209
this idea of bringing extra resources.
Now PSI all started with this.

00:12:22.209 --> 00:12:26.699
This one condom.
And a couple of trucks.

00:12:26.699 --> 00:12:30.680
And the trucks that you see here were actually
in Bangladesh.

00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:36.949
40 years ago when PSI started, this is how
these condoms were distributed.

00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:40.920
If you think about it, 40 years ago, even
to us, condoms were scarce.

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.639
It was a taboo subject.
So take a country like Bangladesh, where the

00:12:45.639 --> 00:12:50.760
stigma and the cultural situation in the country
was even worse.

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:56.330
One of our founders felt that this is what
needed to happen, that we needed to bring

00:12:56.330 --> 00:13:02.800
vital health care, health services, health
products to people who really need them the

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.269
most.
So this was all started in Bangladesh from

00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:12.740
the back of a truck.
So PSI's mission, as I said, is really to

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:17.290
save lives.
I like to joke that "PSI is one of the most

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:22.850
effective and largest health organizations
in the world that nobody has ever heard of.”

00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:24.519
You hear about CARE.
You hear about Save the Children.

00:13:24.519 --> 00:13:29.589
You hear about UNICEF.
Size relation, we're actually very similar.

00:13:29.589 --> 00:13:36.490
And our focus -- and the focus there in Romania
13 years ago, or 12 years ago, when I was

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:43.850
there -- was to improve the life, people's
lives and health, all over the world, and

00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:49.220
really to have grassroots, measurable results
in all of the countries.

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:54.829
So when I joined PSI ten years ago to start
YouthAIDS, we had 40 country programs.

00:13:54.829 --> 00:14:00.839
And now, we're in 65 countries around the
world, reaching almost a billion people with

00:14:00.839 --> 00:14:07.850
these life-saving health products and services.
I would like to say that I can take credit

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:11.949
for that, but I really can't.
It's a group of extraordinary people, about

00:14:11.949 --> 00:14:20.199
8,000 people worldwide who every day make
it their mission to develop these winning,

00:14:20.199 --> 00:14:27.759
creative solutions to deliver this much-needed
health care services and products to these

00:14:27.759 --> 00:14:30.930
people.
And some of these people you can see here

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:35.420
in these images.
We go into deepest, darkest Africa, to Asia,

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:38.470
to all these different places in the world
that are very hard to reach.

00:14:38.470 --> 00:14:45.199
And you must imagine, for instance, that a
sixth of the world does not have access to

00:14:45.199 --> 00:14:48.790
drinking water.
Now, I was privy to the most amazing lunch

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:54.800
ever today in Google -- which I can not believe
you get every day and every night.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.570
All those free drinks and free food.
But this is a very different situation around

00:15:00.570 --> 00:15:04.269
the world, obviously.
And we need to find ways to reach people in

00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:14.470
very rural and urban areas with these life-saving
messages and behavior change techniques to

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:21.110
have them realize why themselves and their
families are getting sick from purely preventible

00:15:21.110 --> 00:15:27.980
diseases.
And some of these diseases are malaria, HIV,

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:37.269
tuberculosis, pneumonia, reproductive health,
women giving birth to children under trees,

00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:45.310
or having unsafe abortions -- really do account
for hundreds of millions of lives every year.

00:15:45.310 --> 00:15:49.640
So these are some of the countries that we're
in.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:55.279
We really do span across the whole world.
We're in 65 countries across five continents.

00:15:55.279 --> 00:16:01.890
Most of these countries I've actually been
to now -- which was actually one of my real

00:16:01.890 --> 00:16:09.670
objectives is to go and learn about the situation
all over the world, about how people are living

00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:16.260
and how they are finding access to this health
care.

00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:23.029
Now, just to explain my internal challenge
a little bit, because when I came to PSI with

00:16:23.029 --> 00:16:31.000
this very fancy idea of reaching out to Hollywood
and the corporate world, PSI was -- and still

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.639
is -- a decentralized organization.
So you have to imagine that there's many companies

00:16:35.639 --> 00:16:41.389
all over the world with CEOs heading up those
local programs.

00:16:41.389 --> 00:16:47.120
And they really need a local identity, because
they work locally with the government.

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:51.649
They have local resources.
They fill a very critical gap between what

00:16:51.649 --> 00:16:55.930
the government is doing and what the private
sector is doing.

00:16:55.930 --> 00:17:03.199
So a highly effective organization already,
but had never told the story of themselves.

00:17:03.199 --> 00:17:08.589
Again, one of the most highly successful health
organizations in the world, but nobody knows.

00:17:08.589 --> 00:17:15.539
So my job was to come in and, first of all,
convince PSI that this is something that I

00:17:15.539 --> 00:17:24.030
should be doing.
And again, PSI had very -- oops, PSI had very

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:28.339
little brand identity and no equity in the
PSI brand.

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:33.000
And, quite frankly, the programs themselves
weren't really interested in this YouthAIDS

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.169
idea.
So it was very much a case of having to prove

00:17:37.169 --> 00:17:44.780
myself and having to prove this idea of YouthAIDS.
So my mission was to take this idea that I

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:51.780
had drummed up in the slums of South Africa,
and try to build it into a global brand.

00:17:51.780 --> 00:17:59.320
And I found myself in an office in Washington
really not knowing anybody or really having

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:03.840
any connections.
So my first job was to reach out to some of

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:09.160
the champions that I have known over my career
to try to make this work.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:15.919
And my first call was to MTV, who I had worked
with in Eastern Europe.

00:18:15.919 --> 00:18:20.450
So I say that, "I am on a mission to find
champions.”

00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:28.210
And my mission was to find these champions,
to gain corporate support, to build vital

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:35.730
partnerships, to bring the media to put a
public face to what PSI is doing, and to recruit

00:18:35.730 --> 00:18:41.290
celebrity ambassadors, which was a whole journey
all on its own.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:46.250
So what I want to do now is -- rather than
me talk -- I always feel that it's much better

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:47.250
to show videos.

00:18:47.250 --> 00:18:52.150

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:59.630

favorite celebrities, YouthAIDS is spreading
the word.

YouthAIDS partnered with Sanrio and Macy Gray

Macy Gray: Hey, this is Macy Gray, and I am
angry because AIDS takes the life of one child

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:19.890

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:24.470

YouthAIDS programs.

which sold thousands of T-shirts for YouthAIDS.

00:23:35.540 --> 00:23:41.730
&gt;&gt; Missy Elliot partnered with Levi's and
YouthAIDS to create a one-of-a-kind jean jacket

00:23:41.730 --> 00:23:46.190

&gt;&gt; I take risks every day, but this is one
risk I won't take.

00:24:00.610 --> 00:24:05.900
&gt;&gt; It has proven that messages delivered by
leading artists resonate effectively with

00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:07.970

&gt;&gt; Timberland.
I'm going to do the same thing that Quincy

00:24:50.909 --> 00:24:52.570
did back 20 years ago, two decades ago.

Nothing quite as good as an orgasm.

00:24:56.090 --> 00:24:59.190
That's for sure. That's for sure.
But, you know, nothing quite as bad as dying

00:24:59.190 --> 00:25:00.220
prematurely either.
So protect yourself.

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.289
&gt;&gt; And Michelle Branch have endorsed YouthAIDS
and their corporate sponsors.

00:25:02.289 --> 00:25:04.140

clear message that is making an impact around
the world.

Kate Roberts: Okay. So sorry I'm going to
have to flip back to the presentation here.

00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:11.140
So what you see there is after a couple of
years.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.140
I have to say -- San Francisco means something
for me, because I remember the very early

00:25:12.140 --> 00:25:13.140
years of not having a lot of resources to
do this.

00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:14.140
I actually took a Greyhound Bus from San Francisco
to LA, because we just literally did not have

00:25:14.140 --> 00:25:15.140
any money to get me -- to fly me around chasing
these partnerships.

00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:16.140
Sorry. So that was where we were in the beginning.
And the -- Oh, okay.

00:25:16.140 --> 00:25:17.140
Does anybody know how to get this back? I'm
so sorry.

00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:18.140
[long pause]

00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:19.140
Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Sorry.
One thing I have never learned is how to do

00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:20.140
these things properly.
So again, to get back to where we were.

00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:21.140
The first real project that launched us into
orbit with our brand was this unprecedented

00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.140
partnership between MTV Networks International,
the Gates Foundation, Paul Allen, and Levi's.

00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:23.140
And what it was, was a global partnership
and concert series that was made into a 90-minute

00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.140
documentary and aired in 170 countries around
the world.

00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.140
And YouthAIDS and PSI were the driving force
behind the messaging.

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:26.140
We engaged the talent behind it, we worked
with the talent to develop various PSA's,

00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:27.140
and we aired it in all the countries that
MTV were not in.

00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:28.140
And I would say that this was the platform
really that helped us to launch YouthAIDS

00:25:28.140 --> 00:25:29.140
and to get others involved.
You know, one of the challenges I think of

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:30.140
the developing world is, there are so many
worthy causes.

00:25:30.140 --> 00:25:31.140
And you really have to find a way to get your
cause out there and cut through the clutter

00:25:31.140 --> 00:25:32.140
of everything that's going on.
Back then, ten years ago, was a very different

00:25:32.140 --> 00:25:33.140
landscape than what it is right now with everything
that we have going on online.

00:25:33.140 --> 00:25:34.140
And the power then was really through multimedia,
television, radio, and on the ground.

00:25:34.140 --> 00:25:35.140
And this was the most remarkable experience
of shipping Pea Diddy and Alicia Keys and

00:25:35.140 --> 00:25:36.140
Usher and various stars to South Africa where
I had originally had the idea of YouthAIDS.

00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.140
So one very touching moment was taking Alicia
to a clinic where all the women in the clinic

00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:38.140
were just about to give birth, and they were
all HIV positive.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:39.140
There was 25 beautiful African ladies, and
they had heard that Alicia was coming to speak

00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:40.140
to them about this issue.
And they had heard about two weeks before.

00:25:40.140 --> 00:25:41.140
And when we walked in, they were lined up
 -- the most beautiful women -- and they burst

00:25:41.140 --> 00:25:42.140
into her song, "Fallin'.”
It was when she had just -- she was just becoming

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.140
famous for that song, and they had been rehearsing
it over the two weeks so that they could give

00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.140
her a welcome.
But for me, that was a very touching moment,

00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:45.140
because it is in the townships of South Africa
was where it had all started.

00:25:45.140 --> 00:25:48.059
So cause-marketing, back then, was relatively
new.

00:25:48.059 --> 00:25:55.480
And I think the power of the MTV "Staying
Alive" project really helped us to bring in

00:25:55.480 --> 00:26:00.830
these various companies.
To give you an example of one of them, Kiehl's,

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:03.669
which is a brand which I'm sure we all use
and know.

00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:11.140
Kiehl's had never spent a dollar on doing
any form of advertising, and they had a product

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:17.540
that was on their shelves that was not selling.
And we approached them to do a product for

00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:22.159
YouthAIDS.
And they decided to use this product that

00:26:22.159 --> 00:26:25.149
wasn't doing well.
And they re-branded it, put the YouthAIDS

00:26:25.149 --> 00:26:29.210
logo on it.
And it literally flew off the shelves, and

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:33.210
in two weeks, they had cleared their entire
stock.

00:26:33.210 --> 00:26:39.590
So, on forming these partnerships, it's about
finding win-win solutions, and finding win-win

00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:44.000
strategies that are really going to help to
sustain these programs.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:50.049
And I was on a personal journey of finding
a company -- one company -- that would really

00:26:50.049 --> 00:26:55.399
embrace this issue, and put all their resources
behind it and make it part of their brand,

00:26:55.399 --> 00:27:01.030
make it part of their network.
So whereas these projects had been great learning

00:27:01.030 --> 00:27:06.679
experience, you know, they'd raised a couple
million dollars, I really wanted to find one

00:27:06.679 --> 00:27:12.960
brand that could do that.
And this was the company.

00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:20.260
The background behind ALDO Shoes is that,
they had been giving silently to AIDS causes

00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:25.399
since the beginning of the pandemic.
And the general manager was sitting on a plane

00:27:25.399 --> 00:27:29.710
one day, and he opened US Weekly, one of the
tabloids.

00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:35.080
And in the tabloid, he found a picture of
Kristin Davis from Sex and the City wearing

00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:41.240
the Hello Kitty YouthAIDS T-shirt.
And he thought to himself, "Maybe it's time

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:46.740
for us to be more visible with the work that
we're doing around HIV.”

00:27:46.740 --> 00:27:54.720
So he decided to put a call into us when he
arrived back in Canada, and asked me to come

00:27:54.720 --> 00:28:02.960
and meet him and their founder, Mr. Aldo Bensadoun.
And we really just talked about their objectives

00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:07.929
of what they wanted to do.
And ultimately, as in any for-profit company,

00:28:07.929 --> 00:28:13.059
they wanted to sell more shoes.
And they were very forthright about that,

00:28:13.059 --> 00:28:20.559
but they also wanted to show their customers
how much they care about them and about the

00:28:20.559 --> 00:28:24.981
potential risks of HIV.
So this was the program that was borne out

00:28:24.981 --> 00:28:28.100
of that conversation.
And then, about a year later, we went live

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:35.559
with "See No Evil, Hear No Evil, Speak No
Evil," which literally you could see on billboards,

00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:43.230
on buses, in advertisements, in magazines.
And what we did with them is, we leveraged

00:28:43.230 --> 00:28:47.880
their marketing spend.
They obviously had marketing power with the

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.640
dollars that they would buy pages in magazines
or billboards.

00:28:51.640 --> 00:29:01.760
And we managed together to double that marketing
space that they were buying to support this

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:07.260
campaign.
This campaign ran in about 25 countries -- to

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:18.120
be honest it's still running in 25 countries.
And it created about 1.5 billion media editorial

00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:22.289
impressions.
And that was outside of their advertising.

00:29:22.289 --> 00:29:26.220
That was the number of people who wrote about
it or if it was online.

00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:31.899
And it's raised about $4 million now that
goes towards our programs.

00:29:31.899 --> 00:29:36.419
So for me, this was the turning point of the
YouthAIDS brand, of really finding this corporate

00:29:36.419 --> 00:29:41.159
partner to do this.
And there are many stories surrounding how

00:29:41.159 --> 00:29:44.851
we got about 40 A-list celebrities to be part
of this campaign.

00:29:44.851 --> 00:29:59.220
&gt;&gt; Thousand people dying every day.

&gt;&gt; The disease is so real. It's so ________

00:30:30.419 --> 00:31:50.740
&gt;&gt; 40 million people have already died of
HIV-AIDS-related causes, an estimated almost

00:31:50.740 --> 00:32:20.009
40 million are currently living with HIV.

00:32:20.009 --> 00:32:47.820
&gt;&gt; Millions of young people who aren't educated.

00:32:47.820 --> 00:33:30.540
&gt;&gt; Obviously it's not a black issue or a gay
issue.

00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:32.309
It's a world issue.

00:33:32.309 --> 00:33:37.020
&gt;&gt; Young people are a very important part
of ______

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:42.860
&gt;&gt; They make up a large percentage of employees
at the organization.

00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:53.799
They're a large percentage of our customers.
We felt a moral obligation to speak out to

00:33:53.799 --> 00:34:03.529
them.
We decided to get together with YouthAIDS

00:34:03.529 --> 00:34:27.110
and ________ a very compelling message "Hear
No Evil, Speak No Evil, See No Evil."

00:34:27.110 --> 00:35:03.510
&gt;&gt; It's about changing the course of history.
It's about changing the world.

00:35:03.510 --> 00:35:14.010
It's about social justice.
It's about empowering people to reproductive

00:35:14.010 --> 00:35:18.030
health in saving their lives.

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:33.110
&gt;&gt; When we first decided this was going to
be a celebrity-driven campaign -- it was very

00:35:33.110 --> 00:35:54.010
recently -- and I really didn't think that
we were going to be able to pull it off -- but

00:35:54.010 --> 00:36:05.710
everybody we asked jumped on board, and it's
just been absolutely amazing.

00:36:05.710 --> 00:36:24.290
&gt;&gt; I like this campaign for so many reasons.
I mean, first of all, Peter was shooting.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:36.310
He's someone I've known for years, and he's
a great photographer.

00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:50.040
&gt;&gt; To have celebrities there, I thought was
great, because to have people who are known,

00:36:50.040 --> 00:37:17.360
agree to put a tape on their eyes.
I mean, that is an amazing thing.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.560
To be covered with a tape

00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:20.270
&gt;&gt; You pay the price, you know, like five
dollars to buy two of them.

00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:21.270
Actually save a life.

00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:22.870
&gt;&gt; These empowerment tags are really cool,
you see?

00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:26.730
It's also a reminder that nobody should take
this for granted.

00:37:26.730 --> 00:37:33.350
&gt;&gt; So when you buy your empowerment tag, not
only do you contribute five dollars towards

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:38.670
educating and protecting a young person for
a entire year, you make a commitment about

00:37:38.670 --> 00:37:42.960
your own participation in the process of awareness
and prevention.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.530
&gt;&gt; I spent ten dollars on two pairs of dog
tags.

00:37:46.530 --> 00:37:50.550
How could you go wrong with that?
I mean, God can only bless you.

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:53.070
&gt;&gt; There's no vaccine in sight.
There's no cure in sight.

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.500
So really, all we have is prevention.

00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.380
&gt;&gt; If I could give advice to a young person,
I would say, "Get Tested."

00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:02.110
&gt;&gt; And take charge of your life and make smart
decisions with your life.

00:38:02.110 --> 00:38:05.480
&gt;&gt; Abstain, use a condom.
It's pretty simple.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.240
&gt;&gt; Prevention is power.
That is our power.

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.640
It's so simple when you have the facts.

00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:13.350
&gt;&gt; Yo! If you want to learn more information,

00:38:13.350 --> 00:38:14.370
&gt;&gt; Go to www.YouthAIDS

&gt;&gt; YouthAIDS

&gt;&gt; YouthAIDS

&gt;&gt; YouthAIDS/ALDO

00:38:18.370 --> 00:38:19.370
&gt;&gt; YouthAIDS/ALDO

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:20.370
&gt;&gt; www.YouthAIDS/ALDO.org

00:38:20.370 --> 00:38:21.370
&gt;&gt; Check it out.

00:38:21.370 --> 00:38:24.050
Kate Roberts: Okay, now I actually have a
lot more presentation to do, but I am very

00:38:24.050 --> 00:38:30.730
conscious of the time.
And I do like some form of interaction, and

00:38:30.730 --> 00:38:34.920
would love any questions that you might have
up until this point.

00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:35.920
[pause] Yes.

00:38:35.920 --> 00:38:41.490
&gt;&gt; Seems like there's tension between the
company wanting to make money and you wanting

00:38:41.490 --> 00:38:49.220
to make money for the cause?
How do you negotiate to figure out what percentage

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:58.740
they're going to get or, you know, what's
fair, and how public do you make that known?

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:05.940
Kate Roberts: Again, I think it's about a
win-win strategy and because we're being protective

00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:14.100
over our brand.
You know, we have a brand too, just as ALDO

00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:21.300
Shoes does.
And so, it's almost like a licensing deal.

00:39:21.300 --> 00:39:29.070
You have to negotiate up front what your boundaries
are and how much you want to raise.

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:36.830
And so, again, you have to have a win-win.
Is that me that's making that noise?

00:39:36.830 --> 00:39:43.600
You have to have a win-win.
So you go in and you have to have an honest,

00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.360
trusting relationship from the beginning that
you're not going to get exploited.

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.040
And I think that the public has become more
savvy now, and they can see through campaigns.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.040
So it has to be credible, and it has to be
 -- I'm backing away from the microphone.

00:39:51.040 --> 00:39:52.040
It has to be credible, and it has to be a
meaty campaign for the consumers to even want

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.040
to buy into it now.
That's a really great question, though.

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:54.040
That's a really great question.
Any other questions up until now? Yes.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:55.040
&gt;&gt; Where's the best practices that you apply
to for-profit and nonprofit worlds?

00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:56.040
And then what are the sort of nuances that
you saw like.

00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.040
Kate Roberts: Mm-hmm. That's a really great
question.

00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:58.040
I have to tell you that I don't do anything
differently now than I used to do in the for-profit

00:39:58.040 --> 00:39:59.040
world.
And everything I learned doing marketing for

00:39:59.040 --> 00:40:00.040
Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, I apply to this.
I think that my experience building brands

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.040
before has helped me to build this brand.
And I think the thing that's helped me the

00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.040
most to build this brand is two things.
One, having a very credible and successful

00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.040
health organization behind the brand of PSI.
I don't think this would have been possible

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:04.040
without having that organization behind the
brand, because all the money that's raised

00:40:04.040 --> 00:40:05.040
goes to PSI's programs to help them with sustainability
and to build more resources.

00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.040
And secondly, it's passion.
It's just pure passion.

00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.040
I really, really believe in the organization
and what we're doing.

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.040
And I -- you know, when you travel to the
countries and you see for yourself what's

00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:09.040
going on, you can't help but have that passion
for what you're doing.

00:40:09.040 --> 00:40:10.040
And so, I think that's universal.
You really need to find the passion in your

00:40:10.040 --> 00:40:11.040
life and apply it to what you're doing.
We were just talking over lunch about people

00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.040
who go into work and just do a job to earn
money.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:13.040
I can't possibly imagine being that person
or not having something greater than myself

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.040
to work towards.
But for-profit techniques work for nonprofits.

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:15.040
And I actually think that there are not enough
for-profit people in the nonprofit world -- think

00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:16.040
I just lost the presentation -- in the nonprofit
world doing the work that needs to be done

00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.040
and finding these innovative ways to, again,
cut through the clutter and present your brand

00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.040
 -- to form these partnerships.
Any other questions before we go back? Oh.

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.040
Okay.
All right, to quickly go through again.

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:20.040
So another question might be, Well, how do
you sustain, How do you sustain these programs,

00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.040
you know?
How do you become the core of a company's

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:22.040
brand, and How do you keep these going? How
do you keep it interesting, and also, How

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:23.040
do you bring different corporations into the
mix?

00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:24.040
And this is just another example of an organization,
H&amp;M, we all know it.

00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.040
They've got 1300 stores worldwide.
They believed in the cause themselves, and

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.040
this is actually recently run where they just
use their platform internally to develop a

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:27.040
varied range of clothing that we managed to
get Rihanna to be the face of.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:28.040
And it raised millions of dollars.
And we're just about to launch a health center

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.040
in Haiti and Russia with the proceeds.
Again, I referred before about, it's about

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.040
finding champions.
There's a number of champions sitting here

00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.040
with me today.
But these are some of the champions that I've

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.040
seen around the world who have really helped
to save lives.

00:40:32.040 --> 00:40:33.040
Archbishop Desmond Tutu was the first man
of the church to come forward and talk about

00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.040
the importance of correct and consistent condom
use.

00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:35.040
A big risk.
The church is a powerful medium, and he was

00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.040
the champion.
A lady here in the slums of India in the purple

00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.040
sari was given a death sentence by her doctor
when she found out that she was HIV positive.

00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:38.040
Her doctor literally told her that she would
die very soon.

00:40:38.040 --> 00:40:39.040
And she decided to become a peer educator.
I think we've lost sound.

00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:40.040
She decided to become a peer educator.
And before she died, she actually saved hundreds

00:40:40.040 --> 00:40:41.040
of thousands of lives by speaking out in a
difficult community with so much prejudice

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:42.040
against people living with HIV.
And she was able to use her power.

00:40:42.040 --> 00:40:43.040
So she's a champion.
The Global Fund, the Gates organization, the

00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:44.040
government -- they're all champions.
And this is a picture of Michael Holscher,

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:45.040
who originally approached me to do this.
And so, for me, he's a champion.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.040
And I think that, that's really my point -- that
everybody has it in them, and everybody can

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:47.040
be a champion.
These are some of our Celebrity Ambassadors.

00:40:47.040 --> 00:40:48.040
We try to find culturally relevant ways to
work with different people from different

00:40:48.040 --> 00:40:49.040
backgrounds to get different messages out.
And these are just some of the people.

00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.040
Miss Universe, Bono, Ashley Judd, Juanas,
and this gentleman who is our ambassador.

00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:51.040
His name is Akshay Kumar in India, because
people are going to relate to people in their

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.040
own countries.
We also in India worked with Shahrukh Khan,

00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:53.040
Shamit Hassan, and that's really what we do
all over the world by social mobilization

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.040
and tapping into the cultures.
We've made a number of films.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:55.040
We've made five documentaries now that have
aired all over the world.

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.040
I would encourage you to look and watch these
films.

00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.040
The National Geographic one was following
Ashley and various Bollywood stars around

00:40:57.040 --> 00:40:58.340
India.
I'm not going to do the video thing again.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:01.780
I can't stand it.
So you might ask yourself how effective YouthAIDS

00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:05.620
is.
Well, we've raised almost $20 million in cash.

00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:09.910
And probably hundreds of millions of dollars
worth of resources.

00:41:09.910 --> 00:41:14.240
The MTV project alone was $90 million worth
of media.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:20.680
And for me, it's all about partnership.
Because we don't want to reinvent the wheel.

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:25.120
We want to tap into the built-in infrastructure
that exists in the world.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:31.100
And we're really looking to form those effective
partnerships. Okay.

00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:35.510
So, in ending, I'm going to show you one last
video.

00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:39.940
Ashley Judd: Good morning.
I am Ashley Judd, and I am the Global Ambassador

00:41:39.940 --> 00:41:41.920
for YouthAIDS.
My first trip as YouthAIDS Global Ambassador

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.920
was designed around the International AIDS
Conference, which at that time was being held

00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:43.920
in Bangkok, Thailand.
Here we are.

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:56.930
I don't know that much about Cambodia.
I left My Lonely Planet to work at home.

00:41:56.930 --> 00:42:02.660
But in a way I'm glad, because I think it's
really interesting to come to a place like

00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:06.280
this eyes wide open just ready to learn.
I will let them show me what they are about,

00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.290
rather than come in with any preconceived
notions whatsoever.

00:42:08.290 --> 00:42:09.410
And so, the journey begins.

00:42:09.410 --> 00:42:12.280
Ashley Judd: We started by visiting a wonderful,
wonderful hospital/hospice, that provides

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:18.730
end-of-life care for the people who've really
been ravished by opportunistic infections

00:42:18.730 --> 00:42:44.790
and that are really I think very end of their,
you know, losing battles with HIV/AIDS.

00:42:44.790 --> 00:43:09.490
We arrived at a pagoda, which is what they
call their temples, and went inside.

00:43:09.490 --> 00:43:10.490
Then the monks entered.

00:43:10.490 --> 00:43:11.490
[chanting]

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:33.530
Ashley Judd: It is an enormous pleasure to
sit and have people pray for you.

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:42.730
It's so totally rocked.
So that was all done and we adjourned outside.

00:43:42.730 --> 00:43:54.920
I met the Watt grannies.
A Watt granny is a Buddhist woman who takes

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.750
on the assignment of caring for at-risk and
vulnerable children.

00:43:57.750 --> 00:44:00.312
It was about the most beautiful collection
of women I've ever seen in my life.

00:44:00.312 --> 00:44:01.312
They were awesome.

00:44:01.312 --> 00:44:02.312
&gt;&gt; Tell them I'll come back and bring my handsome
husband.

00:44:02.312 --> 00:44:03.312
&gt;&gt; [speaking in a foreign language]

00:44:03.312 --> 00:44:04.312
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:44:04.312 --> 00:44:05.312
Ashley Judd: I held some beautiful babies.
Oh man, beautiful babies.

00:44:05.312 --> 00:44:06.312
The hardest things were at night in my hotel
room by myself thinking about the people I

00:44:06.312 --> 00:44:07.312
met and thinking about this beautiful child
named Osweileia, and just knowing that they

00:44:07.312 --> 00:44:08.312
are still in their circumstances.
You know, vulnerable and at-risk is very difficult.

00:44:08.312 --> 00:44:11.660
And I was a part of this afternoon was peer
education.

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:27.240
So a sex worker who is dynamic and has an
outgoing personality will be asked to help

00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:28.240
educate her peers about HIV, how the virus
is transmitted, and about condoms -- both

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:44.470
male condoms and female condoms -- and how
to insist that your clients use a condom,

00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:51.780
and how to safely get out of the situation
if the client refuses.

00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:54.590
&gt;&gt; [speaking in a foreign language]

00:44:54.590 --> 00:44:55.590
&gt;&gt; [Clapping]

00:44:55.590 --> 00:45:00.210
Ashley Judd: Thailand was perfect, because
it's the exact opposite.

00:45:00.210 --> 00:45:05.320
We were new in Thailand.
We were just getting started.

00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:19.050
And one of the interesting things that we
were able to do was be involved with the government

00:45:19.050 --> 00:45:20.230
at the very highest level right away.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:22.830
Ashley Judd: And the prime minister was gracious
enough during his very busy schedule to give

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:24.450
us not only an audience but a very ample one.

00:45:24.450 --> 00:45:25.754
Ashley Judd: We went to an orphanage, and
it's very hard core.

00:45:25.754 --> 00:45:26.754
I mean, I've cried more than once over being
in that place.

00:45:26.754 --> 00:45:42.180
It's just not right.
It is not right to have to talk to children

00:45:42.180 --> 00:45:43.400
so young about such adult issues.
But I can't help the fact that they're there.

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.640
And there are a lot of programs and a lot
of government activities directed at preventing

00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:47.080
those children from being on the street in
the first place.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:49.180
However, some are already there.
So we have to reach out to the ones who are

00:45:49.180 --> 00:45:53.680
there, identify them, and help them on a consistent
and sustained basis so that they do not become

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:58.400
HIV positive.
That's what this is about.

00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:07.950
And seeing store front after store front after
store front after store front of these bars

00:46:07.950 --> 00:46:09.840
and karaoke establishments.
I mean, how can I describe what it's like

00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:10.840
to go to a brothel?
Nothing prepares you.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:12.380
Absolutely nothing prepares you.
The women in the brothels and the bars and

00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:13.380
the karaoke establishments knew a lot about
HIV/AIDS.

00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:26.690
And I would say that a lot of that was a credit
to PSI YouthAIDS programs.

00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:28.860
The first group of sex workers with whom I
visited were all HIV positive, and they were

00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:32.840
still working in commercial sex.
It's been the journey of a lifetime and a

00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:38.060
trip I've been waiting my entire life to take.

00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:43.080
Ashley Judd: There's absolutely hope, because
PSI YouthAIDS programs work.

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:49.830
They absolutely 100 percent work.
Being associated with HIV/AIDS associates

00:46:49.830 --> 00:46:53.860
you with compassion, with hope.
And what company doesn't want to be associated

00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:59.030
with that?
And the more creative people are, the more

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:19.840
broad a population, the messages can reach.

00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:23.800
Kate Roberts: So that really shows the work
that we do on the ground.

00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:27.760
And we've taken our champions and ambassadors
many different times to see these programs

00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:30.030
now.
And it doesn't matter personally how many

00:47:30.030 --> 00:47:33.990
times I go to the field and I see the work
that we're doing.

00:47:33.990 --> 00:47:37.670
I remain so passionate about what we do and
how we do it.

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:41.910
And the commercial approach that we take.
And you know, I'm on the brand-building side

00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:46.440
of it, but doing journeys like this really
helps me to stay motivated and current and

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:50.970
creative, which I think is the most important
thing in doing the work that I do.

00:47:50.970 --> 00:47:53.790
So I don't know whether you've got any more
questions?

00:47:53.790 --> 00:47:54.790
[pause]

00:47:54.790 --> 00:47:56.910
Well, thank you very much.
Thank you. Really appreciate it.

00:47:56.910 --> 00:47:57.190
