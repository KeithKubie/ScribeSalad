00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:05.960
The Joe Rogan experience in the problems that men have are different than the

2
00:00:06.241 --> 00:00:10.740
problems those guys think men have.
Right.
Um,
so for instance,

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.300
we did a segment on a stereotype.
We had an episode on stereotypes,
um,

4
00:00:15.301 --> 00:00:18.860
called Adam ruins a sitcom where,
uh,
we talked about different,
you know,
we,

5
00:00:18.861 --> 00:00:22.310
we talked about stereotypes via,
you know,
sort of,
uh,
uh,
cheesy 80 sitcom.

6
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.390
I had lost stereotypes in it.
So you've got the stereotypical black kid,

7
00:00:24.391 --> 00:00:28.590
you got stairs,
you can be an Asian kid.
What does name,
no,
we didn't do that.
Well,

8
00:00:28.591 --> 00:00:30.210
there's only three acts on the show,
you know what I mean?

9
00:00:30.211 --> 00:00:33.390
I wish we could on that and women and,
and all sorts of things.
But we,

10
00:00:33.391 --> 00:00:36.270
and we had a stereotypical dad,
you know,
like a home improvement type dad,

11
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.260
you know,
and,
uh,
what we talked about is like those,
uh,

12
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.290
there are ways that men are being harmed by the sort of narrow idea of what a

13
00:00:46.801 --> 00:00:50.250
man is.
You know,
um,
for instance,
uh,

14
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:54.900
men have a very high suicide rate,
right?
Um,
and,
uh,

15
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.490
specifically,
uh,
loneliness is a health problem for men,

16
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:03.360
for like older men.
Like take my dad,
right?
My Dad's a about 65.

17
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.740
He doesn't have a friend,
you know,
I hope he doesn't hear this,
but,
um,
you know,

18
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.930
yeah.
Like he,
he has like work colleagues.
He's got my mom,
you know,
he's got me,

19
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.210
he's got,
I'm sure he's got people he's friendly with,
you know what I mean,

20
00:01:15.211 --> 00:01:18.000
but doesn't have a best friend,
you know,
who does it,
who comes over to watch,

21
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.870
you know,
the red sox with them.
That's terrifying to me.
Yeah.
And the thing is,

22
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.570
loneliness is associated with early death,
you know,
and with disease,
right.

23
00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.900
And like,
when you look at the way that we bring up men,

24
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.440
men are socialized to not have close relationships with each other.
You know,

25
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.090
really.
Yeah.
I mean like,
well,
like,
uh,
we talk about,
uh,

26
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.730
from an early age,
we talked about this briefly on the show,

27
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:46.110
but we could have gone into a whole episode on it from an early age.
Uh,

28
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.840
researchers have found this,
that,
uh,
little boys,
when they're very young,
uh,

29
00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.230
are very close with foreign,

30
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:54.630
very close friendships that are physical friends with they hug,
you know,

31
00:01:54.631 --> 00:01:56.790
they'll kiss,
they'll,
you know,
have kids on the street,
you know what I mean?

32
00:01:56.791 --> 00:01:58.560
They'll have physical,
close friendships like that.

33
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.580
And then they reach an age where that starts to become not okay,
right.
Um,

34
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:04.710
where it becomes,
oh,
that's not how boys act.
Right.

35
00:02:04.711 --> 00:02:06.390
And girls are still doing that with their friends.

36
00:02:06.391 --> 00:02:09.720
They're still holding hands with their friends.
You know,
there's still,
uh,

37
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:09.961
you know,

38
00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:13.320
having close relationships like that and boys started to start to build a little

39
00:02:13.321 --> 00:02:17.190
bit of diff distance,
you know,
and you know,
it's easy to say,
well,

40
00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:20.010
when you're a teenager,
that's because there's a stigma against being gay.

41
00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.740
And like,
we don't want to appear gay,
but it happens even younger than like,

42
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.420
kids would even have a notion of that,
you know?

43
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.020
So it really seems to be a deep down way that we bring up boys of like,
Hey,

44
00:02:28.021 --> 00:02:30.690
don't get too close to each other.
You know what I mean?
That's a little weird.

45
00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.840
It's just a little weird for boys to do that,
you know,
and we do that.

46
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.250
We do it from a young age is very subtle,
um,
and very subtle,

47
00:02:38.251 --> 00:02:42.840
but it's universal.
I mean,
in America it seems to be,
um,
and uh,

48
00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:46.680
you know,
I,
uh,
yeah,
I've even felt that myself.

49
00:02:46.681 --> 00:02:51.130
Like I've often had an easier time having close,
close relationships with,
uh,

50
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.260
women rather than men.
You as friendships.
Yeah.
As friendships.
Yeah.
Man,

51
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.070
I don't,
just in terms of who I talked with about my relationships and stuff.

52
00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.550
Yeah.

53
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.100
<v 1>Good friendships with women mostly that are comics,
but,
um,</v>

54
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.550
almost all my good friends.
Yeah,

55
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.700
<v 0>guys,
I have a lot of good friends.
I mean,
you're lucky if that's the case.</v>

56
00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:09.103
I certainly am.

57
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.640
But there's that thing of having a little bit of distance from your male
friends,

58
00:03:13.641 --> 00:03:17.960
you know,
of like not being,
of not getting really into it emotionally,
you know,

59
00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.770
look,
if you don't feel that way,
that's fine.
I felt that myself,

60
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.980
and I'm sure results in some people held on boats.

61
00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:29.930
<v 1>You felt that some people feel it.
I'm sure I don't experience that.
You know,</v>

62
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.400
most of my friends that I know have good male friends and they were pretty tight

63
00:03:34.401 --> 00:03:35.234
with people.

64
00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.990
<v 0>Well,
when,
uh,
the,
the point is that like there is a trend,</v>

65
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.980
especially in older age,
right?
Yeah.
And my dad's name

66
00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.160
<v 1>buddy,
whether it's a male or a female,</v>

67
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:47.710
when you get older and you don't have any friends,
that's a bad thing.

68
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.620
<v 0>Well,
so demo demographically we know that that happens to men more than women,</v>

69
00:03:51.621 --> 00:03:51.780
right?

70
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.240
That the man my dad's age is more likely to have less friends than a woman my

71
00:03:56.241 --> 00:03:58.520
mom's age.
Um,

72
00:03:58.521 --> 00:04:01.850
I mean I think that's one of those things where I would hesitate to make a big

73
00:04:01.851 --> 00:04:02.810
conclusion.
But I mean,

74
00:04:02.811 --> 00:04:05.510
I would say I think we can draw a link between that and you know,

75
00:04:05.511 --> 00:04:08.120
that man are sort of like socialized to not have these close friendships,

76
00:04:08.121 --> 00:04:12.590
but so that is a serious problem that men have that men face.
Right.

77
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.770
Um,
another one we talk about is stuff like,
you know,

78
00:04:15.771 --> 00:04:17.150
drinking and smoking for instance.

79
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.960
Those are behaviors that are much more pushed on that.
And you know,

80
00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.690
those are much more advertised towards men,
right?
And those are dangerous,
right?

81
00:04:23.691 --> 00:04:26.570
Those are like hurt you physically and can lead to an early death,
right?

82
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:28.220
Those are,
those can lead to bad health outcomes.

83
00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.510
And so those are things that men face that are different than the challenges

84
00:04:32.511 --> 00:04:35.300
that women face and can result in bad health outcomes for us.
You know,

85
00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.310
and it's so funny how this sort of like men's rights people,
you know,
they're,

86
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.710
they don't talk about that stuff quite as much.
They talk about,
you know,

87
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.610
violence and,
and,
um,
you know,
uh,
people being hurt at work and stuff like that.

88
00:04:46.611 --> 00:04:48.310
Like man having dangerous occupations.
And that's,

89
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.940
and that stuff true is true as well.

90
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.540
But like these are the more subtle ways that,
you know,
men are,
uh,

91
00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:58.570
are hurt by this sort of narrow expectations of what a man is that we put on

92
00:04:59.961 --> 00:05:02.270
men.
Hey,
men are like this.
You should be like this,
you know?

93
00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:03.440
And some of those things hurt men.

94
00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:06.030
<v 1>Do you think we still do that though?
Yeah.</v>

95
00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.330
We'll still put in narrow expectations of what man,

96
00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.820
<v 0>I totally,
I totally agree.
They do.
I think we might be lucky here in la,
you know,</v>

97
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:15.670
because we can sort of like live any way that we choose.
I mean,

98
00:05:15.671 --> 00:05:20.380
you clearly live exactly how you want to live,
which is great.
Uh,
you know,
uh,
and,

99
00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.090
and I,
I get to as well.
Uh,
but I think that,
uh,
you know,
we're,

100
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.480
we're lucky in that we're so self actualized,
you know what I mean?
That,

101
00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:31.150
that maybe we face a little bit less pressure than,
than you know,

102
00:05:31.151 --> 00:05:32.560
your average Joe across the country.

103
00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:33.663
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

104
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.860
But I don't know of anyone who's putting pressure on men to not be friendly with

105
00:05:39.071 --> 00:05:39.904
other men.

106
00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.920
That seems so ridiculous to me to deny camaraderie.

107
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:49.930
Obviously in the military it's a huge aspect of military service as the

108
00:05:49.931 --> 00:05:54.730
Brotherhood,
but these guys form with each other.
And that's about,
uh,
you know,

109
00:05:54.731 --> 00:05:56.650
if you want to talk about traditional male values,

110
00:05:56.651 --> 00:06:00.380
that's about manly a things a person can do,
right.
Serve their country

111
00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:04.370
<v 0>very much.
So.
Um,
but are like men for instance,</v>

112
00:06:04.371 --> 00:06:09.200
encouraged to be emotionally vulnerable with,
uh,
with their friends for instance.

113
00:06:09.201 --> 00:06:11.240
Like I think that's something that's like dumb

114
00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.170
<v 1>do it.
They're going to bring it up when you argue.</v>

115
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.470
<v 0>Yeah.
And so that's,
so that's the thing.
There's that,</v>

116
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.250
there's a level of intimacy that were,
that were like,

117
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.180
and that's sort of intimacy is what leads to long friendships,
you know,

118
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.320
that really,
really last,
right?

119
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.680
<v 1>It's a balancing act,
that thing because I think there's,</v>

120
00:06:27.681 --> 00:06:31.220
there is intimacy and then there's also guys who were just being a bitch and

121
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:36.200
they need to learn how to man up.
Like school things are real things or real,

122
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:40.220
it is real to be intimate and to be vulnerable and to explain how you feel.

123
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.280
But then sometimes you shouldn't be just fucking complaining about things.

124
00:06:43.281 --> 00:06:46.640
You should figure your life out and man the fuck up and go do something.

125
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:50.690
And it's not necessarily you being emotionally vulnerable as you like to say it

126
00:06:50.691 --> 00:06:54.290
in such a,
uh,
a normalizing way.
It might,
it might just be being a bitch.

127
00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:56.200
It's Paul too in this battle.

128
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.320
When you say that you put a little pressure on on man at all to yes,

129
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:01.500
I put pressure on men.
You are,

130
00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:04.580
maybe you're the one putting a little pressure on us.
They need some pressure.

131
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.670
I think most men need just a little bit of a motivational shove in the general

132
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:12.110
direction of success and happiness.

133
00:07:12.111 --> 00:07:16.880
And a lot of that is overcoming laziness and him implying or,

134
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:19.580
uh,
applying some discipline to your life.

135
00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:23.630
I think those things are very manually attributes that turn out to actually be

136
00:07:23.631 --> 00:07:24.420
good for you.

137
00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:28.700
<v 0>Uh,
you know,
I think there's a lot of,
I don't disagree with you about,</v>

138
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.830
about some of those aspects being good for you.
Um,
let,

139
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:32.500
let me just give one other example.
Um,

140
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.420
and I'm blanking on the name of this podcast.
Um,
I can,

141
00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:39.140
I can look it up if you want,
but,
um,
a very wonderful podcasts about philosophy.

142
00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.920
Um,
the last five as this,
uh,
no,
I love philosophize.
This,

143
00:07:42.921 --> 00:07:44.980
it's a different one here.
I'll look up what it was,
um,

144
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.370
as I'm talking to you about it,
but I'm really wonderful podcast.
Uh,
where,
uh,

145
00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:54.380
they were talking to this guy who was in the military,
um,
and,
uh,

146
00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.900
his PTSD,
right?
And he was talking about how the idea of,

147
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:03.020
of be a man,
right.
Was just a phrase that he would hear a lot in the military,

148
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.010
right?
Um,
and,
oh,
it's called high nation is the name of the podcast.

149
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:10.160
And there's an episode called Bmn hyphenation really wonderful podcast about

150
00:08:10.161 --> 00:08:13.430
philosophy.
Um,
and,
uh,

151
00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:16.250
it was talking about that idea of be a man,
right?
What does that mean in,

152
00:08:16.251 --> 00:08:18.770
in the military?
And,
and look,
I'm just repeating what was in the podcast.

153
00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.340
I have no military experience myself.
I don't want to claim too,
but,
um,
uh,

154
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:26.420
and you know,
that means sort of like overcome adversity,
right?

155
00:08:26.421 --> 00:08:28.160
Don't complain too much,
right?
If you have a problem,

156
00:08:28.161 --> 00:08:31.340
solve it yourself kind of thing.
Right?
And he talked about,

157
00:08:31.341 --> 00:08:33.680
and they also talked with the medical professionals who said the same thing,

158
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:36.260
that that idea,
um,
can,

159
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:39.290
doesn't give me the tools they need to deal with PTSD.
Right.

160
00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:42.650
And can actually exacerbate PTSD because it means that they're not trained how

161
00:08:42.651 --> 00:08:47.650
to reach out for help for those problems.
And so on situation,
I think,
oh yeah.

162
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:49.490
Oh yeah.
It's a different example of,
of,

163
00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:53.000
of just a way that that sort of narrow idea BIA man being a man means this.

164
00:08:53.060 --> 00:08:55.950
A real man would do this,
right?
That does,

165
00:08:55.951 --> 00:08:58.800
that works in some situations maybe that works when you're,
you know,

166
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:02.730
in a Foxhole,
right.
Um,
it doesn't work so well when you're out of it.
Right.

167
00:09:02.731 --> 00:09:04.930
And so that's a narrow idea that can lead to a bad apple,

168
00:09:05.070 --> 00:09:08.180
<v 1>I'm sure.
But that's basically what we were just saying,
that you know,</v>

169
00:09:08.181 --> 00:09:12.500
you should be emotionally vulnerable and know how to express yourself with your

170
00:09:12.501 --> 00:09:14.900
friends and be honest and true about how you feel about things.

171
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:19.270
But you all should know when you're being a bitch.
Both of those things are real.

172
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.480
Fair enough.
Fair enough.

173
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:24.440
If you're on a hike with a friend and he has to stop every five minutes because

174
00:09:24.441 --> 00:09:28.640
his foot hurts,
like,
come on man,
my foot hurts to just fucking walk.

175
00:09:28.641 --> 00:09:32.720
You're walking fine.
I completely agree with you.
I don't think this is worth it.

176
00:09:32.890 --> 00:09:35.420
I mean,
it just is not what I had in mind when we started hiking.

177
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.990
That guys beat a bitch,
right?
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
He needs to man the fuck up.
Right.

178
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:42.080
But let me,
but I know you're hesitant to say,
man,

179
00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:45.290
the fuck up because it was a woman.
What would you say you'd say toughen up,

180
00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.930
just soldier on.
What would you say?
Well,

181
00:09:47.931 --> 00:09:50.510
I don't think that the reason I'm hesitant to use that word is I don't think

182
00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:55.100
that being tough is exclusively a male.
That's why if you're a woman,

183
00:09:55.101 --> 00:09:56.860
what would you say?
We,
you say tough enough.
Yeah.

184
00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:59.310
Guess I went in the same situation.
You gotta toughen up.

185
00:09:59.311 --> 00:10:03.300
You have to deal with it.
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah.
Press on.
Yeah.
But men like to,

186
00:10:03.890 --> 00:10:08.890
we like to equate that to one of our best attributes being a fucking man.

187
00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:12.310
Cause I'm a fuck with the is we'll say,

188
00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:16.090
<v 0>what if you're,
what if you're uh,
uh,
on that walk with,</v>

189
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:21.230
on that hike with a friend and your friend is legit afraid of hikes I've been on

190
00:10:21.241 --> 00:10:25.190
in France on hikes.
We've,
I'm sorry,
I didn't said hikes heights.
Right.
I'm sorry.

191
00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.410
You can't be hiking with that dude.
And I went on a hike.

192
00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.760
I went on a hike with a friend.
My friend had it.
We were in Zion National Park,

193
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:38.070
which has a very narrow Utah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
My friend had had a panic attack.
Right.

194
00:10:38.071 --> 00:10:41.730
Because,
because of the hike and it was,
and it was,
you know,
um,
and that's legit.

195
00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:45.450
Right.
And thank God he was able,
he felt able to share it with me.
Right.

196
00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:47.100
But if we,
you know,
so that's,

197
00:10:47.101 --> 00:10:51.240
so that's the balancing act of creating an environment where you're not,
hey,

198
00:10:51.241 --> 00:10:54.480
yeah,
don't complain about your foot,
but hey,
if you're really in distress,

199
00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:58.140
like you can share that with me.
And some men feel that they can't do that.

200
00:10:58.141 --> 00:11:01.360
And I remember when I was younger,
you know,
feeling well,
I want to,

201
00:11:01.410 --> 00:11:02.370
I really have this problem,

202
00:11:02.371 --> 00:11:04.740
but I can't express that to my friends because they're going to make fun of me.

203
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:09.630
Right.
Um,
and that sucks.
And so my goal is to,

204
00:11:09.631 --> 00:11:13.800
and what that segment that we did about manliness was about,
um,
was saying,
hey,

205
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:17.910
if you,
uh,
if you're a man and being a man to you,
it means,
you know,

206
00:11:17.911 --> 00:11:21.450
being confident,
being assertive and stuff like that.
Great qualities,

207
00:11:21.510 --> 00:11:25.710
not that qualities of,
all right,
but we want to expand the notion of manliness.

208
00:11:25.711 --> 00:11:29.970
So it includes all the different ways that one can be a man,
right?
Um,
uh,

209
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:32.460
that that is,
it's as wide as possible.
Right?

210
00:11:32.461 --> 00:11:34.080
So because of the problem was going to shut it down,

211
00:11:34.180 --> 00:11:36.580
<v 1>the expression manliness,
right.
That's the problem.</v>

212
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:41.230
Cause manliness like instantly becomes handsome,

213
00:11:41.231 --> 00:11:45.730
aggressive,
you know,
muscular,
all cultural idea of a man.

214
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:50.690
And womanliness is more like soft and kind.
Ooh.
You know,

215
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:52.600
you don't think of it sexually,
right?

216
00:11:52.900 --> 00:11:56.770
When see or you think of womanliness isn't really a word that's used,

217
00:11:56.771 --> 00:11:57.604
but if it was,

218
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.430
<v 0>yeah.
Womanly that,</v>

219
00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:02.290
that those are their cultural ideas that we associate with those things.
Right.

220
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:06.280
But I,
so,
so let me just give you my example.
I,
uh,

221
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:11.170
personally I love taking care of other people,
right.
With me and my,

222
00:12:11.230 --> 00:12:13.450
me and my girlfriend been together 10 years.
Um,

223
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:17.890
one of the main things I love to do in our relationship is I really like cooking

224
00:12:17.891 --> 00:12:20.050
for her.
You know what I mean?
I like taking care of her.

225
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.160
That's like something that I enjoy.
Right.
Um,
uh,

226
00:12:24.161 --> 00:12:28.570
that's the part of my manliness.
That's like how I am a man.

227
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.890
You look what I'm invited to,

228
00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.020
<v 1>good.</v>

229
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:36.020
Well Food and you can sit down and do something for and cook for.

230
00:12:36.250 --> 00:12:39.880
<v 0>You can associate it with,
yeah.
Pr Providing,
providing goes back to that,</v>

231
00:12:39.940 --> 00:12:43.210
you know,
classic sort of,
uh,
Ma,
you know,
manly value.

232
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.200
You can go in there with that.

233
00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:47.360
<v 1>I'm not even saying in that sense.
Yeah.
There's nothing wrong with that word,</v>

234
00:12:47.361 --> 00:12:49.510
but in that sense you wanted

235
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:50.990
<v 0>give,
yeah,
exactly.</v>

236
00:12:51.390 --> 00:12:55.860
And that's not a value that I was brought up with of like that's a manly thing

237
00:12:55.861 --> 00:13:00.510
to do,
right.
Is to like,
be kind and be nurturing,
you know what I mean?
Um,

238
00:13:00.570 --> 00:13:03.820
but,
uh,
it's not that I really,
that that really means a lot to me.
Yeah.

239
00:13:03.821 --> 00:13:07.740
W it wasn't what I was brought up with.
Um,
and,
uh,
uh,

240
00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:11.130
so to me it's important to like expand,
you know,

241
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.580
my notion of what it was really a big deal for me to like realize that that was

242
00:13:14.581 --> 00:13:18.690
part of what being a man was to me.
Um,
and I noticed that like,

243
00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:23.010
you know,
uh,
for instance,
um,
like,

244
00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:26.130
let's just take the example of like,
you know,
kids entertainment,
like growing up,

245
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:27.780
you know,
like kids cartoons and stuff like that.

246
00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:30.990
Like the female characters are the ones who are taking care of other people and

247
00:13:30.991 --> 00:13:33.000
the male characters are the ones who are kicking ass.
Right.

248
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:37.530
And I like kicking ass sometimes too,
but I realized at one point I was like,
oh,

249
00:13:37.531 --> 00:13:40.080
I didn't have like models of that as a kid of like,

250
00:13:40.081 --> 00:13:45.030
here's a man who takes care of other people emotionally or you know,

251
00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.750
uh,
or in a caring way,
you know,
but to fill,
uh,

252
00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:54.370
Dr Phil is,
he does it a little bit.
Does it,

253
00:13:54.390 --> 00:13:56.010
does I see what you're saying?
Yeah.

254
00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:00.440
<v 1>Yeah.
I mean,
whenever you have a label,
especially a narrow label,
yeah,</v>

255
00:14:00.540 --> 00:14:03.540
it's a problem.
You know,
and I think,
uh,
the,
the,

256
00:14:03.541 --> 00:14:08.541
the idea of manliness or like what it entails and the problems that people would

257
00:14:10.681 --> 00:14:12.510
have about that on the outside,

258
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.230
it's almost always problems that are being imposed on them,
like,

259
00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:19.050
or the ideas that are being imposed on them where people who don't like the way

260
00:14:19.051 --> 00:14:23.790
they live or don't like who they are or want to mock who they are,
how they live.

261
00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:28.140
So if someone's too emotional,
if someone's too introverted,

262
00:14:28.141 --> 00:14:32.040
instead of celebrating that and all that guy's different.
Cool.
Instead of that,

263
00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:35.910
it's the bully a mocking and shitting on them.

264
00:14:35.911 --> 00:14:37.690
The jock type behavior.
Yeah.

265
00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:41.580
We associated with being the negative aspect of masculinity,

266
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:45.250
total toxic masculinity is,
which is the phrase that gets tossed around.

267
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.670
But I think this is,
um,
you know,
this is a shitty humans.
I agree.
You know,

268
00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:52.250
I mean really where the

269
00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:55.930
<v 0>problem is not specific to,
it's not specific to men,
right?
It's,</v>

270
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:57.343
it's everybody.

271
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.760
But let me give you one more example just to get back to what you're talking

272
00:14:59.761 --> 00:15:04.130
about,
about body type and what people are attracted to.
I read this wonderful,
uh,

273
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.560
advice column.
Um,
uh,
it's this guy who is,
this guy doesn't device.

274
00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:11.210
It's got a kind of silly names,
Dr Nerd love.
Um,

275
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.080
but he's done a really good advice column and this dude wrote in and said,
Hey,

276
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:19.160
I'm with a woman.
She's,
um,
you know,
a little bit bigger of a Gal,
you know,

277
00:15:19.161 --> 00:15:22.460
then I've dated in the past.
I really am into her.
She's so cool,

278
00:15:22.461 --> 00:15:25.850
but she's not my type.
I'm not normally into women like this.

279
00:15:25.851 --> 00:15:27.860
And that bothers me that she's not my type.
Right.

280
00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:30.890
Even though I'm into her so much,
she's not my type.
What do I do about that?

281
00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:35.120
She's not my type.
And I loved this guy's answer.
He wrote back and he said,
dude,

282
00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.290
she's your fucking type.
You like her,
right?
You're into her.

283
00:15:39.291 --> 00:15:41.180
You think she's a sexy woman,
right?

284
00:15:41.330 --> 00:15:45.740
The problem is you are brought up in a world where it's not okay for men to like

285
00:15:45.741 --> 00:15:49.760
women like that.
It's not okay to like women who are her size and you've,

286
00:15:49.790 --> 00:15:53.650
you've ingested at your whole life and now you're hating yourself because you

287
00:15:53.651 --> 00:15:55.840
are told something that about what's okay to,

288
00:15:55.841 --> 00:15:57.560
for you to like and what's not okay for you to like.

289
00:15:58.010 --> 00:15:59.900
And I really related to that,
you know,

290
00:15:59.901 --> 00:16:03.380
because I remember feeling that way about girls.
I dated like,
hold on a sec.
Oh,

291
00:16:03.381 --> 00:16:06.230
I'm into her so much,
but oh wait,
is she not?

292
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:08.930
Is she not like attractive?
Right?

293
00:16:08.931 --> 00:16:12.530
Am I wrong to be dating her because she doesn't fit what I,
you know,

294
00:16:12.531 --> 00:16:16.430
the sort of like set of PR parameters for what an attractive woman is.
Right?

295
00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:19.480
And so when you talk about what people say,
what people say,
they're attractive.

296
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:21.740
If you ask any woman,
wouldn't she say she's attracted to this kind of man?

297
00:16:21.741 --> 00:16:24.980
If he asked any man wouldn't say she's attracted to that kind of woman.
Yeah,

298
00:16:24.981 --> 00:16:26.210
they might say that.
Right.

299
00:16:26.211 --> 00:16:30.980
But deep down do they maybe have a desire that is not being,
you know,
that they,

300
00:16:30.981 --> 00:16:34.850
that they've been told is wrong their whole lives.
Right.
Um,

301
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.150
I really related to that,
I was like,
man,
that is really a good point.

302
00:16:38.151 --> 00:16:40.460
I have been told that my whole life and it has,

303
00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:45.500
I've allowed it to control who I'm attracted to to a certain extent,
you know?

304
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:49.430
And that's a mental prison that I want to get out of,
you know,

305
00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:53.180
and you know,
now I have the benefit.
I'm a little bit older,
you know,

306
00:16:53.181 --> 00:16:55.280
and I feel like I'm in less mental prisons that I used to be.

307
00:16:55.281 --> 00:16:57.770
I feel like you're a known mental prisons at all at all.

308
00:16:57.771 --> 00:17:01.040
I feel like a lot of your listeners,
you know,
I've have broken out of them,

309
00:17:01.041 --> 00:17:01.730
you know,

310
00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:05.350
but especially I think back about like when I was 16 years old and yeah,
I,

311
00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:05.691
you know,

312
00:17:05.691 --> 00:17:08.780
you're swimming in that shit and you don't know to question at yet a lot of the

313
00:17:08.781 --> 00:17:09.950
time.
And that's what our show is about,

314
00:17:09.951 --> 00:17:13.850
is getting people to question those assumptions and those things that you're

315
00:17:13.851 --> 00:17:16.580
being told without even realizing you're being told them.
