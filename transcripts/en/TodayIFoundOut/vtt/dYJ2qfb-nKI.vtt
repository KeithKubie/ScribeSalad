00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.430
The all-powerful pharaohs of ancient Egypt
were frequently buried alongside a literal

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.010
wealth of fabulous treasure- treasure that,
as you can probably imagine, the pharaohs

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.199
were very keen to protect.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:30.680
So did they actually have significant preventative
measures in place to stop anyone from stealing

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.020
their stuff after they’d gone a little moldy?

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.250
Well, yes and no, but when it comes to the
idea of elaborate booby traps or puzzles as

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:44.100
depicted by Hollywood and in games, definitively
no.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.000
To begin with, it’s important to understand
that generally the pharaoh’s own subjects

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.250
and in some cases, their direct successors,
were the ones stealing their afterlife retirement

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.250
plan.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.580
You see, a pharaoh’s power was more or less
absolute and they could do pretty much anything

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:59.710
they pleased.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.250
As a result, many pharaohs would have the
tombs of their ancestors looted, in some cases

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.500
even reusing the items for their own burial.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.140
There are even stories of pharaohs unceremoniously
having the mummy of their predecessor dumped

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.950
out of their sarcophagus so that even that
container could be reused.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.630
This all was particularly the case in times
of hardship when Egyptian nobility would think

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.110
nothing of ransacking the final resting place
of a beloved family member or ancestor because,

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.630
well, technically, in their view it was their
stuff sitting there.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.350
A perk of being the ones who set the rules,
this tomb raiding practise by nobility was

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.359
tolerated in the ancient Egyptian world.

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.219
However, tomb raiding from individuals not
directly related to the deceased wasn’t

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:46.229
as much and it carried some rather harsh penalties.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.170
Punishments for raiding a tomb ranged from
brutal death to public flogging, depending

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.810
on how important the crypt that was desecrated
was and the value of the items stolen.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.090
In regards to the kind of death penalty meted
out to thieves, it was common practise to

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.689
burn them alive.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:03.850
Why?

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.090
Well in addition to being a rather unpleasant
way to die, this would condemn the thief to

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.080
an eternity of nothingness due to the belief
in ancient times that if you died without

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.520
a body, you couldn’t enter the afterlife.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.890
Other forms of execution included decapitation,
which would similarly mean the thief couldn’t

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:23.470
enter the afterlife, or impalement, which
the ancient Egyptians believed would result

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.930
in the spirit of the deceased being tied to
that singular location, forever…

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.840
Obviously, this was seen as a bad thing and
the hope of pharaohs was that such harsh punishments

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.520
would deter thieves.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.170
The problem with all these punishments is
that it would seem it was rather easy to get

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.280
out of getting into any trouble at all.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.850
For example, consider this account by one
11th century BCE tomb raider, Amenpanufer,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.820
on both his method of tomb raiding and how
he got out of trouble, even when caught:

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:57.380
We went to rob the tombs as is our usual habit
and we found the pyramid tomb of King Sobekemsaf,

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.500
this tomb being unlike the pyramids and tombs
of the nobles which we usually rob.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.090
We took our copper tools and forced a way
into the pyramid of this king through its

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.270
innermost part.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.660
We located the underground chambers and, taking
lighted candles in our hands, went down.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.460
We found the god lying at the back of his
burial place.

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.350
And we found the burial place of Queen Nubkhaas,
his consort, beside him, it being protected

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.110
and guarded by plaster and covered with rubble.

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.420
We opened their sarcophagi and their coffins,
and found the noble mummy of the king equipped

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:28.420
with a sword.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:32.680
There were a large number of amulets and jewels
of gold on his neck and he wore a headpiece

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.680
of gold.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.810
The noble mummy of the king was completely
covered in gold and his coffins were decorated

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.050
with gold and with silver inside and out and
inlaid with precious stones.

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.860
We collected the gold that we found on the
mummy of the god including the amulets and

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.460
jewels which were on his neck.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.600
We set fire to their coffins.

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.040
After some days, the district officers of
Thebes heard that we had been robbing in the

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.010
west and they arrested me and imprisoned me
in the office of the mayor of Thebes.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.890
I took the twenty deben of gold that represented
my share and I gave them to Khaemope, the

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:05.110
district scribe of the landing quay of Thebes.

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.260
He released me and I rejoined my colleagues
and they compensated me with a share again.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.840
And so I got into the habit of robbing the
tombs.

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.180
Tomb raiding was so commonplace in ancient
times that near enough every level of society

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.750
took part in it, including somewhat hilariously,
the very people charged with constructing

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.910
the tombs, as well as those in charge of burying
the dead.

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:29.060
Sadly, while Hollywood would have you believe
that the tombs of ancient pharaohs were teeming

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.040
with a manner of deadly booby-traps, the truth
is much more vanilla.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.710
For starters, the idea of elaborate booby-traps
in ancient tombs is considered to be nothing

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:38.830
more than a myth.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.419
To quote one Emily Teeter, an expert on Egyptian
and Nubian antiquities working at the University

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:44.419
of Chicago –

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:49.240
I am really sorry to report that if curses
are out, then there is really nothing devious.

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:53.930
Hollywood has turned standard architectural
features like sliding portcullis blocks, shafts,

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:57.169
and sand filled chambers into objects of horror.

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.930
This isn’t to say you won’t find many
reports of booby-traps from otherwise seemingly

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.340
reputable sources, stating things like that
Egyptian tombs were filled with everything

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:10.169
from razor sharp wires located at exactly
head height to deadly snakes- all of which

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.449
have been written off by actual experts as
fanciful claims that have no basis in reality.

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.669
Instead, the countermeasures in place to deter
thieves tended to just be obstacles put in

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.529
the path to the goods, such as huge slabs
of granite or random debris and the like blocking

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:27.529
the way.

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:31.199
They also sometimes employed empty chambers
with the real chamber containing the various

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.600
goods walled up somewhere else in the structure,
etc.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.689
Other than these sorts of rather quaint security
measures, other deterrents tended to just

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:42.059
be more metaphysical in nature- mostly limited
to curses that would condemn a thieves’

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:45.779
soul to a eternity of perpetual agony or the
like.

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.849
For example, consider the following curse
placed over the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.089
by one of his high priests which threatened,
amongst other things, that any thief would

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:55.089
–

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:59.370
lose their earthly positions and honors, be
incinerated in a furnace in execration rites,

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.590
capsize and drown at sea, have no successors,
receive no tomb or funerary offerings of their

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:09.419
own, and their bodies would decay because
they will starve without sustenance and their

00:06:09.419 --> 00:06:10.779
bones will perish…

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:14.719
Given the widespread pilfering of tombs that
went on back then and the fact that the person

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:19.199
placing the curse would sometimes take part
in said pilfering, it’s safe to say these

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:23.659
sorts of curses weren’t something a lot
of people took seriously.

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:28.139
Pharaoh Amenhotep got so annoyed with how
often the tombs of his ancestors were raided

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.969
that he ordered the construction of a place
known as Set-Ma’at – quite literally “Place

00:06:32.969 --> 00:06:37.490
of Truth” – a village of conscripts charged
with both building and protecting the tombs

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.650
of nobility.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.150
The idea of Set-Ma’at, sometimes also known
as Deir el-Medina was simple –

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.900
The workers of the village would create the
tombs and protect their creation and, since

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.039
they relied on the sta

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.039
te for their wages and homes, they would be
loyal and discreet regarding the location

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:52.189
of the tombs and the amount of treasure to
be found within.

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:55.689
However, frequent delays in the delivery of
supplies to the villagers, including things

00:06:55.689 --> 00:07:00.669
like food and water, and the basic nature
of said payment, did little to foster trust

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:04.680
and loyalty amongst the townsfolk, which,
coupled with their intricate knowledge of

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:08.930
the tombs themselves and exactly what treasure
was stored within them and where, naturally

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.240
led to widespread theft.

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:15.330
Despite the isolated nature of the village,
workers could still fence stolen goods by

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:19.900
simply walking to a nearby city and trading
the goods, often to those who would then do

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.569
things like melt down any gold or the like
and create new objects that couldn’t be

00:07:23.569 --> 00:07:25.449
traced back to a tomb.

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:29.439
Now all this said, it has been speculated
that hematite powder, which when inhaled in

00:07:29.439 --> 00:07:34.099
sufficient quantities could potentially cause
death, was used as something of a booby trap,

00:07:34.099 --> 00:07:35.689
if not terribly effective.

00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:39.039
For example, in one tomb discovered in 2001
at the Bahariya Oasis, there was several inches

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:40.470
of this powder on the floor.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:44.860
It’s also sometimes said that mercury was
used as an intentional deterrent in many ancient

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:49.029
tombs that have been discovered in China,
like the burial site of Emperor Qin Shi Huang.

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:53.710
However, this notion is universally dismissed
by experts, though the sheer amount of mercury

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:56.839
sometimes used was such that it could still
be a potential health hazard, if also likely

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:57.839
not terribly effective at accidentally preventing
tomb raiding.

00:07:57.839 --> 00:08:01.249
For the most part though, the tombs of the
ancient emperors, kings and pharaohs were

00:08:01.249 --> 00:08:06.949
protected, if at all, merely by simple physical
barriers, abstract threats such as curses,

00:08:06.949 --> 00:08:11.270
and the ever present risk of being horribly
mutilated and killed should the perpetrator

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:15.889
ever be caught, assuming they didn’t simply
just bribe their way out of the situation.

00:08:15.889 --> 00:08:19.999
Unsurprisingly from this, the plundering of
tombs was widespread and almost comically

00:08:19.999 --> 00:10:14.970
easy for certain subsets of the population
who had access to the tombs

00:10:14.970 --> 00:11:18.860
or the right tools.
