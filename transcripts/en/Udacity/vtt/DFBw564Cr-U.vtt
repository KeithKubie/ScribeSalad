00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.890
This lesson and the following ones are designed to

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:05.500
give you the tools that build designs that scale across

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.280
multiple devices. And one of the first challenges with developing

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.580
for the mobile web, is the display screen. The typically

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.690
small display screen compared to your desktop or laptop

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.835
device really forces you to focus on what's critical for

00:00:18.835 --> 00:00:21.330
your users, in fact this is what's led to the

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.070
recent adoption of the mantra mobile first. Now, mobile first

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.110
isn't about designing for the mobile web

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.080
before you even think about the desktop experience.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.480
It's really a design philosophy of stripping down

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.130
to your core user experience and then layering

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:37.820
additional gravy on top if you have

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.910
the appropriate space. For example you might put

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.420
your company info links inside a menu rather

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.020
then cluttering up your home screen with them.
