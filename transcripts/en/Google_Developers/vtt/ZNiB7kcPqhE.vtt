00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.330
&gt;&gt; SALMI: My name is Deborah Salmi and I work
in marketing for Web of Trust. Web of Trust

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:18.360
or WOT for short was founded in 2006 by two
university post-graduate students from Finland.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:24.240
Both worked as researchers in the field of
computer security and data mining. During

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.080
their research, they came up with the idea
of creating a reputation system for the web.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.660
The goal was to make the internet a safer
place for everyone, make it more democratic

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.110
and to give everyone a chance to contribute
to this objective.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:44.290
&gt;&gt; What is your extension about?
&gt;&gt; SALMI: The average web user wants to know

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:51.059
which websites they can trust. The WOT add-on
is a safe surfing tool for your browser. It

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.129
shows you traffic-light-style rating symbols
that tell you which websites you can trust

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.930
for safe surfing, shopping, and searching
on the web. Many experienced users--they want

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:09.120
to contribute to web safety. WOT rating is
powered by a global community of millions

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.469
of trustworthy users who've rated millions
of websites based on their experiences.

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:17.689
&gt;&gt; How did your vision evolve as you were
working on your extension?

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:24.140
&gt;&gt; SALMI: We had a clear vision of our extension
from the beginning. This was our third browser

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.210
platform. The first version of our extension
used a toolstrip and a mole for its user interface.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.920
But we've had a UI similar to Chrome's browser
actions for years now on other browser platforms.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.570
And we're very happy to see the Chrome team
ultimately decided to go with browser actions

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.289
instead.
&gt;&gt; How difficult was it to integrate with

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.450
your existing service?
&gt;&gt; SALMI: Well, integration with our existing

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.799
service, it was easy. We have a web service
API, and we use HTML HTTP request to access

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.700
it from all our other extensions too.
&gt;&gt; What did you enjoy most about writing your

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.840
extension?
&gt;&gt; SALMI: We like the fact that it's easy

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:10.080
to reload and test extensions without restarting
the browser. Chrome's developer tools were

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.750
a great help in debugging the extension as
well.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.550
&gt;&gt; What were some challenges you faced when
writing your extension?

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:24.019
&gt;&gt; SALMI: We would have liked to see some
additional APIs for cryptographic primitives,

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:32.780
hash functions especially, URL parsing, IDN
conversions for example. So we ended up implementing

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.870
these in Java Script instead.
&gt;&gt; Was there a particular technical challenge

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.469
you faced in which you gave an innovative
solution?

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:47.549
&gt;&gt; SALMI: Chrome was initially lacking a full
internationalization framework, so we decided

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.280
to implement our own because we wanted to
support multiple languages right from the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.900
beginning. So later, the internationalization
framework Chrome team implemented, it was

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.079
almost identical to ours. Supporting the extension
to use it was trivial.

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.629
&gt;&gt; What do you think about Google Chrome's
decision to use CSS, HTML and JavaScript as

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:11.349
the basis of its extension framework?
&gt;&gt; SALMI: It was brilliant--brilliant decision.

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:18.640
Chrome's move to use HTML, JavaScript and
CSS to create extensions was a brilliant decision,

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:24.319
and it makes developing extensions possible
for anyone with web development experience.

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:30.629
It's a lot easier to develop extensions for
Chrome than for other platforms. Also the

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:36.349
fact that extensions are just web pages, it
gives Chrome a natural way to sandbox them

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.499
from each other and from the privileged browser
process.

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:47.280
&gt;&gt; How many times have you updated your extension?
&gt;&gt; SALMI: We've had 12 updates since the initial

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.469
release. And updating the extension through
the website, it's really quick and it's convenient.

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.879
And we especially like the fact that there's
no need to wait for a human review before

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:03.480
the extension is published to users. So combined
with Chrome's automatic extension updates,

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.390
this makes distributing bug fixes and new
features to our users very convenient. And

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:13.810
you know, we've noticed that Chrome users
are far more likely to use the latest version

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.509
of our extension than users who have other
browsers.

00:04:16.509 --> 00:04:23.250
&gt;&gt; How did you promote your extension?
&gt;&gt; SALMI: Our user community was all a buzz

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:28.630
about Chrome, so when the dev channel and
then later the beta channel was released,

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.130
we blogged, we tweeted about it, and many
WOT fans tried it out. And because we made

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:41.260
sure we were one of the first extensions to
be completed for Chrome, many of the respected

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.510
tech sites included WOT in the "must-have"
list for Chrome. So now, we are working on

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:56.060
updating our website and featuring WOT for
Chrome more prominently. Part of that is educating

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.270
users that they have a choice when it comes
to browsers. But whichever browser they choose,

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.510
we want WOT to be part of their safe-surfing
experience.

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.889
&gt;&gt; What advice can you give someone before
starting to work on a Google Chrome extension?

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.360
&gt;&gt; SALMI: Developers who are starting work
on a Chrome extension, they should carefully

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.582
think about the architecture of their extension
and decide early on what they want in the

00:05:22.582 --> 00:05:27.350
background page and what should be done in
content scripts. If they plan to localize

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.000
the extension, it's a good thing to prepare
for that from the very beginning.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.070

Google IO conference.
