taught that once we start something we
 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.140
taught that once we start something we
have to finish it and I think that so

a book that I want to read in its
 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.680
a book that I want to read in its
entirety in most of the time the answer

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:25.690
entirety in most of the time the answer
 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:27.540
entirety in most of the time the answer
is going to be no a lot of the books

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550

extract the general principles from the
 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.120
extract the general principles from the
book or it's sort of like argumentation

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130

category whereas it's usually much more
 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.300
category whereas it's usually much more
beneficial from a learning perspective

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310

those particular categories pick up a
 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.150
those particular categories pick up a
whole bunch of leadership books but then

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160
whole bunch of leadership books but then
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.130

much better outcome than sort of picking
 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.610
much better outcome than sort of picking
up one of these books and reading it

cover-to-cover
 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:48.950
cover-to-cover
because it's going to be hard to put it

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960
because it's going to be hard to put it
 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.510
because it's going to be hard to put it
into practice it's going to be hard to

want to figure out what works for you

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880
want to figure out what works for you
 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.090
want to figure out what works for you
and that's not always what somebody else

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100
and that's not always what somebody else
 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.150
