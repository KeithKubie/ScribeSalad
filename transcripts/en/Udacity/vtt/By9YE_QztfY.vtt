00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.969
Next we're going to prove that
the transformation just described

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.080
does in fact reduce 3-CNF
satisfiability to independent set.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.900
We start by arguing that
if f is satisfiable

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.680
then the output graph G has
an independent set of size m.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.620
We'll let t be a satisfying
assignment for f.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:22.240
In our example, let's take the one
that makes a true, b false, c false,

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.390
and d false, and
we'll set the complements accordingly.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.730
Then, we choose one literal from
each clause in our original formula

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.390
that is true under the truth assignment,
and this will form our set S.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.250
So in our example, I might choose this
a, this b bar and this b bar here.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.910
Clearly the size of this set is m,
the number of clauses.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.380
Because the vertices come
from distinct clauses,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.670
there can't be any within clause edges
and because the truth assignment t

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.360
doesn't contradict itself,
there can't be any contradiction or

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.280
between clause edges either,
therefore S must be an independent set.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.060
And indeed it is in this example.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.180
Let's prove the other direction next.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.720
If G has an independent set of size m,
then the formula f, is satisfiable.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.060
We start with an independent
set of size m in the graph.

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.120
Here I've marked an independent
set in our example graph.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.760
The fact that there can be
no between-clause edges in S

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.330
implies that the literals in
S come from distinct clauses.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:27.870
And the fact that there
are no between-clause edges

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.940
implies that the literals
in S are non-contradictory.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.880
Therefore any assignment
consistent with the literals of S

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.138
will satisfy the original formula f.

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:42.770
Here the choice of literals a, b and
c implies that a, b and c all be true.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.870
We can set d however we like,
true or false, and

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.930
we still have a satisfying assignment.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.940
So that completes the proof that
independent set is as hard as 3-CNF.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.330
And that completes this chain here,
showing that both independent set and

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.680
Vertex Cover are NP-Complete.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.320
Now we're going to branch out,
both in the tree here and

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.780
in the type of arguments we'll make,
by considering the Subset Sum problem.
