00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.410
Welcome back.

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.960
We're now going to start section
eight in test four.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.210
Let's start with problem
number one.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:13.530
Problem number one-- if 3 times
n minus 4 is equal to

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.230
18, what is n?

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.820
n is equal to what?

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.590
Let's divide both sides by 3.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.940
You get n minus 4
is equal to 6.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.210
Add 4 to both sides and
you get n equals 10.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.300
And that is choice D.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.545
Problem number two.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:31.850
Right?

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.000
It was divided by-- well
you know what I did.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.550
Hopefully you know what I did.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.470
Two, for a class ring, each
senior can choose from 4 types

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.500
of stones and 3 types
of metal.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.230
How many combinations of a stone
and metal are there?

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.100
Well, for each stone
they can pick 3

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.810
different metals, right?

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.200
So there's 4-- because there's
4 different types of stones--

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.305
and each of them can have
3 different metals.

00:00:59.305 --> 00:01:06.870
So it's 4 times 3 combinations
which is choice D.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.370
Next problem.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.910
Problem three.

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.490
If you ever doubt yourself on
the first one or two problems

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.020
because it seems too easy, you
probably shouldn't doubt

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.860
yourself, because the first
couple of problems tend to be

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.520
reasonably straightforward.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.430
I was just doubting myself
because I was like, was I

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.630
missing something?

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:26.100
All right.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.140
Problem number three.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:40.310
The sum of 3a and the square
root of b is equal to the

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.270
square of the sum of a and b.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.700
Which of the following
is an expression for

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.950
the statement above?

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.870
Well, I just wrote it out.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:55.470
It's choice B.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.510
But hopefully, as I talked it
out, you saw what I was doing.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:05.830
I said the sum of 3a and the
square root of b-- this is the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.090
sum of 3a and the square root of
b-- is equal to the sum of

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.380
a plus b squared.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.490
Or they said, equal to the
square of the sum of a plus b.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.550
Next problem.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.690
Problem four.

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.620
Carrie has a cordless telephone
receiver that can

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.710
operate within a range
of 1,000 feet.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:30.470
1,000 foot range from the
telephone's base.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.330
Carrie takes the receiver
from the base and walks

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.760
800 feet due north.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.390
So this is the base and-- I
don't know if Carrie is a boy

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:43.490
or girl's name-- but Carrie
walked 800 feet due north.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.510
From that point she walks due
east and stops at the maximum

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:48.760
range of the receiver.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.380
In which of the following
directions can Carrie walk and

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.490
still be within range
of the receiver?

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:03.660
So the range is essentially
that you can go 1,000 feet

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.950
from this point b.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.470
Right?

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.190
And actually, let me draw
it as a circle.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:16.080
So I can go, at most-- so let
me draw the circle here-- so

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:22.610
let's say that this is the
point b, that's the base.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.230
Let's say Carrie's a guy.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.810
Carrie can get at most 1,000
feet away from the receiver.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.390
So the furthest distance that
Carrie can get from the

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.460
receiver is 1,000 feet.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:36.350
So this radius right
here is 1,000 feet.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.510
And in the problem, Carrie
walks 800 feet due north.

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:42.760
So maybe right there.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.160
That's 800.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.290
And then he walks due east to
the range of the receiver.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.190
So then walks east, which is
this direction, to the range

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.580
of the receiver, which
is right there.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.780
And what they want to know is,
in which of the following

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.470
directions can Carrie
walk and still be in

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:00.930
range of the receiver?

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.900
Well, we know Carrie can't walk
north because then he or

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.120
she will be out of range
of the receiver.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.260
Can't walk east. It would
be out of the

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.920
range of the receiver.

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.720
But he or she can walk south or
can walk back west, right?

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.209
So they can walk south or west.
And those are choices 2

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.079
and 3, which is choice E.

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.890
Choice E is 2 and 3, which is
due south or due west. They

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.730
can walk this way, south,
or west, that way.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:29.980
Next problem.

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:33.920
Whoops.

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:37.930
Problem five.

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:49.640
If x over 4 is equal to 2x over
a, and x does not equal

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.900
0, what is the value of a?

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.910
Well, we can divide both sides
by x because we know x doesn't

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.610
equal 0, because you
can't divide by 0.

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.980
So this and this would
cancel out, right?

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:02.240
We're dividing both
sides by x.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.050
So you get 1/4 is equal
to 2 over a.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.150
And you could eyeball this,
but if you want to do it

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.750
mathematically, you could say 1
times a is equal to 4 times

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.970
2, which is 8.

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:19.100
And you could have said, well
2 is 1/4 of what number?

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:20.040
Well it's 8.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.590
So a is equal to 8.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.520
Choice A.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.340
Problem number six.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.086
And we have a little
drawing here to do.

00:05:29.086 --> 00:05:30.750
Let's see, problem number six.

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:34.037
So we have a parallel line like
that, actually I don't

00:05:34.037 --> 00:05:35.810
know if they're parallel yet,
because they haven't told me.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.300
But it kind of looks like that,

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.710
although I shouldn't assume.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.560
We have a transversal, if
those are parallel.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.590
Let me switch colors.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:44.100
OK.

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.010
So they're saying that this
angle right here is r.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:53.340
This is u, s, t.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:54.640
And this is line l.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.150
This is line m.

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.360
In the figure above,
l is parallel to m.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.640
So l and m are parallel.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:01.710
I was right.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.075
And r is 50 degrees.

00:06:03.075 --> 00:06:06.030
So r is equal to 50 degrees.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:09.890
What is the value of
s plus t plus u?

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.260
Well, what are the angles that
are corresponding to r?

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.170
If r is 50, the corresponding
angle here is, so this is kind

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.140
of the same-- if you don't
remember this, you might want

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.800
to review the geometry module
where I do this-- the

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.150
corresponding angle here is u.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:22.540
And so this angle
is also going to

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:24.800
be equal to 50 degrees.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.330
Let me do a different color.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.120
So that equals 50, and that's
because they kind of take the

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.220
same role where the transversal
intersects the

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.240
parallel lines.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.510
And if this is 50, this is the
opposite angle, right?

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:39.910
So that angle is also
going to be 50.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:43.760
And t and u are supplementary,
right?

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.040
So t plus u is going
to be 180.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.850
Or you could say that
this is 130, right?

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:53.320
So what's 50 plus 50 plus 130?

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:54.540
It's 100 plus 130.

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:59.210
It's 230 degrees, which
is choice A.

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:00.460
Next problem.

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.690
Invert colors.

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.960
Problem number seven.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.830
In the x-y coordinate plane,
line l is perpendicular to the

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:16.770
y-axis and passes through
the point 5, negative 3.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.690
So let me-- those are my axes.

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:29.140
y. x.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:32.910
And this line-- I'll draw it in
green-- it passes through

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.320
the point 5, negative 3.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:36.710
So that's like here someplace.

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:38.975
And it's perpendicular
to the y-axis.

00:07:38.975 --> 00:07:41.000
This is the y-axis, so
perpendicular to it.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.540
So it forms a 90 degree angle.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:47.775
And we know this is
a 90 degree angle.

00:07:47.775 --> 00:07:56.050
And it passes through the point
5, and then minus 3.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:57.240
So this is the point
right here.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.040
This is 5 comma minus 3.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.500
Which of the following is an
equation of the line l?

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.540
OK, well what is the
slope of this?

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:11.570
It's a flat line.

00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:14.170
As much as you run-- as much
as you have a change in x--

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.850
there's no change in y, right?

00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:18.420
So the slope is 0.

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.910
And what's the y-intercept?

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.900
The y-intercept is where you
intersect the y-axis.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:24.700
Well, you're going to intersect
it at y equals

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.380
negative 3.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:27.580
So b is minus 3.

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:30.630
And if you don't-- I'm saying
this from the form-- y equals

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:32.730
mx plus b is the slope
of a line.

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:37.640
m is 0, b is 3, so we know the
slope is y equals negative 3.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:39.190
That's the equation.

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:42.110
y equals negative 3,
that's choice C.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.420
And in general, if you just drew
this line, you're like,

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.900
well, no matter what x is,
y is equal to negative 3.

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.200
And you could say, well
that's the equation.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:52.130
y is equal to negative 3.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.610
I have a minute left.

00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.110
I don't think that's enough
time to do a problem.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:56.880
It might be, but I don't
want to rush things.

00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:58.660
So I'll do the next problem
in the next video.

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:00.140
I'll see you soon.
