00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.590
- Hello, and welcome to Fall
in Love with Jordan Mendoza

00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:04.120
with Hannah Hart.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:06.470
We're gonna answer the 36
Questions to Fall in Love

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.930
from the New York Times.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.410
These are questions that studies say,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.470
creates a sense of intimacy between people

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.570
and even makes them fall in love.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.530
And we don't have that much time

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.110
so only you're gonna answer questions

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:19.360
and we're not gonna answer all of them.

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.600
- You're not answering the questions?

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.433
- No.

00:00:21.433 --> 00:00:22.266
- So it's just, okay,

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.150
so I'm just gonna put myself out there.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.040
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.873
- That's cool.

00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:29.110
- So first question,
given the choice of anyone

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:32.850
in the world, with whom would
you want as a dinner guest?

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.770
- Honestly, I would say
probably Patrick Stewart.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.070
I don't know, sometimes I just think that

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.340
Patrick Stewart might be my real dad.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.290
So, that's why I'd like him to come.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.250
- I just want to say, to check in,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.380
I liked you when we were
just talking before this,

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.060
but I kind of like-like you now.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.893
- Really?

00:00:48.893 --> 00:00:51.500
- Yeah, is that weird to say?

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.450
- No, I mean, yeah man, that's great.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.370
No, it's funny though,
because it's, you know.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.800
- Next question, before
making a telephone call,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.600
do you ever rehearse
what you're gonna say?

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.620
- Not really.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.389
- Oh, I have like a big
crush on you. (laughs)

00:01:06.389 --> 00:01:07.847
(Hannah snickers)

00:01:07.847 --> 00:01:09.660
How do you feel about me at this point?

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.740
- My feelings remain
the same, oddly enough.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.225
- Well, let's do the next
one and see where it goes.

00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:17.920
- (laughs) Oh, I think I
know where it's gonna go.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.753
It's gonna stay right here.

00:01:18.753 --> 00:01:20.640
- Maybe in a relationship.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.520
- I think we're gonna, (clicks tongue)

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:23.970
- If you could wake up tomorrow

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.680
having gained one ability or
quality, what would it be?

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.960
- I have such a fear of
the ocean, and so for me,

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.510
I feel like it would probably
be to breathe under water.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.750
I think that's a really
realistic, good application.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.590
- I just don't wanna label
things at this point.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.360
But we're like, we're
definitely dating, right?

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.960
- Right now?

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.063
No, have you done this segment before?

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.228
- This is the first time,
but I think it's going

00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:51.350
just so well and I am really excited about

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.670
where this is gonna go.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.100
Take four minutes to tell
your partner your life story

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.640
in as much detail as possible.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.760
We don't really have that much time,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.170
so can you do it in 40 seconds?

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.320
- This is VidCon's ninth year.

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.020
I've been here seven,
no, eight out of nine.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.853
- [Jordan] Oh, wow!

00:02:04.853 --> 00:02:07.183
- Yeah, and that's pretty
much my life these days.

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.830
Everything else you can read in my memoir,

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.600
Buffering, Unshared Tales
of a Life Fully Loaded.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:12.530
- I'd love to read it.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.363
- Oh, yeah!

00:02:13.363 --> 00:02:15.409
- And, I love you.

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:16.610
(Hannah gasps)

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.460
- Oh man, that's so fun.

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.330
I think you're great.

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.163
- Say it back?

00:02:22.163 --> 00:02:23.670
- Say it back.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:24.928
- Just...

00:02:24.928 --> 00:02:26.040
- You know, I am gay.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.530
I'm a lesbian.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.820
- Love transcends all,
so I believe in love.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.090
- Me too, but I'm also in a relationship

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.180
to be honest.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.480
- I also am too.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.210
And I bet she's open to anything.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:42.577
And at this point, I'm
willing to say, "I'm all in."

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.110
And if you also want to be all in,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.290
I think that's cool as hell.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.750
And just say I love you to me.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.690
(Hannah sighs heavily)

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.530
Do you have a secret hunch
about how you'll die?

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.833
- Hopefully not today.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.793
- No.

00:03:00.793 --> 00:03:01.709
- Okay.

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:03.730
- I would never hurt you, I
would hurt someone who hurt you.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.193
If anyone's hurt you
before, I'll murder them.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.443
And I'll make it hurt.

00:03:09.443 --> 00:03:10.276
- (gasps) Oh!

00:03:10.276 --> 00:03:11.526
- I'll make them feel it.

00:03:12.874 --> 00:03:14.650
I'll press my thumbs into their eyes.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.560
- I think that we've learned
a lot about you as well today.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.393
Nobody else is alarmed.

00:03:20.393 --> 00:03:21.226
- Share with your partner,

00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:22.645
an embarrassing moment in your life.

00:03:22.645 --> 00:03:24.120
- (clears throat) You
know, it's interesting

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.440
because I don't necessarily want to

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.650
become more vulnerable in this situation.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.150
- Uh-huh, I feel like
you're pulling away from me.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.670
Hannah.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:34.503
- Oh, Jesus.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.227
- Will you marry me?

00:03:39.562 --> 00:03:40.562
- (sighs) Oh my god.

00:03:43.493 --> 00:03:44.493
That's a no.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.850
- Okay, so I guess we
end it with eye contact

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:51.223
for two to four minutes.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.709
So let's just do that.

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.093
- (groans) Oh, man.

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:59.690
(clears throat) Ah, wow.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.240
- This is about two to
four minutes, I bet.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.073
Let's just do that.

00:04:03.073 --> 00:04:03.906
- Okay.

00:04:03.906 --> 00:04:05.530
- And we have a timer? Cool.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:06.540
- Isn't that what this is?

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.032
- Alright, let's go.

00:04:08.032 --> 00:04:09.651
- Okay.

00:04:09.651 --> 00:04:12.568
(soft piano music)

00:04:38.697 --> 00:04:40.210
- I can see you broke eye contact.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:41.325
- You know--

00:04:41.325 --> 00:04:42.819
- I'm not gonna read into that.

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.020
- Okay.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.830
- But I think that's probably
about how much time we have.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.030
- Yeah.

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.730
- Together, today.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.180
- Yeah.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.010
- But, I feel like we're gonna be together

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.803
in kind of a forever
kind of way, personally.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.270
So there you have it
guys, the New York Times'

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.750
36 Questions to Fall in Love.

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.213
I'm surprised it works.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.810
I didn't believe in love before
this but (laughs) here I am.

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.083
Hannah has taken my heart, wow.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.130
- You know, I have a self-help podcast.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:18.963
- Oh, really?

00:05:18.963 --> 00:05:19.970
- Yeah, maybe you should check it out.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.243
- I'd love to be on it, as a guest.
