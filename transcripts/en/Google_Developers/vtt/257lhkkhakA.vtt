TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:03.960
I'm Timothy Jordan for
"The Developer Show."

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.001
This is your update on
the coolest developer news

00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:08.230
from Google in the last week.

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.620
There's a new Kotlin boot
camp course on Udacity.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.450
It's free, self-paced,
and teaches

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.270
you everything you need to
know to program in Kotlin.

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.070
A link to the course
is on the post,

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.690
which is linked in
the description below.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.430
The Firebase Cloud
Messaging v1 REST API

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.670
has integrated fully with
the Web Notifications API.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.320
So you can now set
icons, images, actions,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.240
and more for your web
notifications from your server.

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.810
Sample code and links to
screenshots are on the post.

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.990
We've developed a set of
five deep dive courses

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.430
to help you build
production-ready

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.420
machine-learning
models that scale.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.720
They're based on the same
content that has trained

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.400
thousands of Google engineers.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.010
And they're available as a
machine-learning specialization

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.240
on Coursera.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.750
Course highlights and a link
to get started are on the post.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.210
Cloud ML Engine enables
you to train and deploy

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.420
machine-learning models on data
sets of many types and sizes

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.040
using the flexibility
and production

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.870
readiness of TensorFlow.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.270
And now Cloud ML Engine
offers the option

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.720
to accelerate training with
Cloud TPUs as a beta feature.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.540
Getting started is easy,
since Cloud TPU quota is now

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.790
available to all GCP customers.

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.070
The guide to get started
is linked from the post.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.900
Google Kubernetes Engine 1.10
is now generally available.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.420
Along with this, we are
introducing new features

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.850
to support enterprise use
cases, including shared

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.280
virtual private cloud for
better control of your network

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.210
resources, regional persistent
disks and regional clusters

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.300
for higher availability
and stronger SLAs,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.780
and node auto-repair GA
and custom horizontal pod

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.350
autoscaler for
greater automation.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.500
Chrome 64 Beta has a
stronger pop-up blocker,

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.950
supports resize observer to give
web applications finer control

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.250
to observe changes to sizes
of elements on a page,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.860
supports imports.meta
to make it easier

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.280
to access host-specific metadata
about the current module,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.240
and more.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.510
All the details are on the
post linked in the description

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.384

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:08.759
Thanks for watching.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:09.925
And we'll see you next week.

00:02:09.925 --> 00:02:11.175
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:11.175 --> 00:02:13.650
SPEAKER: Uh, [INAUDIBLE], yeah.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.214
How'd that taste?

00:02:16.214 --> 00:02:17.630
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I
did not lick it.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.159
SPEAKER: Many people
have touched that.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:20.950
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Mm.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:21.600
Good.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.320
Germs.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.560
Germs are important.
