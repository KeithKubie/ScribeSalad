00:00:00.447 --> 00:00:01.886
- [Voiceover] We're told the graph of y

00:00:01.886 --> 00:00:03.650
equals two to the x is shown below,

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.766
so that's the graph.

00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.205
It's an exponential function.

00:00:06.205 --> 00:00:07.748
Which of the following is a graph of y

00:00:07.748 --> 00:00:09.874
is equal to negative one times two

00:00:09.874 --> 00:00:13.170
to the x plus three plus four?

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.223
They give us four choices down here.

00:00:16.223 --> 00:00:19.184
Before we even look
closely at those choices,

00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:22.817
let's just think about what this

00:00:22.817 --> 00:00:25.187
would look like if it was
transformed into that.

00:00:25.187 --> 00:00:27.264
You might notice that what we have here,

00:00:27.264 --> 00:00:29.179
this y that we wanna find the graph of,

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.408
is a transformation of this original one.

00:00:31.408 --> 00:00:33.000
How do we transform it?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.345
We've replaced x with x plus three.

00:00:35.345 --> 00:00:37.760
Then we multiplied that by negative one,

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.222
and then we add four.

00:00:39.222 --> 00:00:40.860
Let's take it step by step.

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.682
This is y equals two to the x.

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:45.202
What I wanna do next is let's graph y

00:00:45.202 --> 00:00:47.522
is equal to two to the x

00:00:47.522 --> 00:00:49.739
plus three power.

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.281
If you replace x with x plus three,

00:00:52.281 --> 00:00:54.127
you're going to shift the graph

00:00:56.111 --> 00:00:58.352
to the left by three.

00:00:58.352 --> 00:01:00.594
That might be a little
bit counterintuitive,

00:01:00.594 --> 00:01:02.229
but when we actually
think about some points,

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.087
it'll hopefully make some sense here.

00:01:04.087 --> 00:01:06.409
For example, over in our original graph,

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:08.475
when x is equal to zero,

00:01:08.475 --> 00:01:10.750
y is equal to one.

00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:15.780
How do we get y equal
one for our new graph,

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.441
for this thing right over here?

00:01:17.441 --> 00:01:20.076
To get y equals one
here, the exponent here

00:01:20.076 --> 00:01:22.119
still has to be zero, so
that's going to happen

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.232
at x equals negative three.

00:01:24.232 --> 00:01:26.717
That's going to happen at
x equals negative three.

00:01:26.717 --> 00:01:28.620
Y is equal to one.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.873
Notice, we shifted to the left

00:01:31.873 --> 00:01:33.476
by three.

00:01:33.476 --> 00:01:35.115
Likewise, in our original graph,

00:01:35.115 --> 00:01:38.493
when x is two, y is four.

00:01:38.493 --> 00:01:41.511
How do we get y equals four in this thing

00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:43.009
right over here?

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.664
For y to be equal to
four, this exponent here

00:01:46.664 --> 00:01:49.950
needs to be equal to two,
and so for this exponent

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.338
to be equal to two, 'cause
two squared is four,

00:01:53.338 --> 00:01:54.895
for this exponent to be equal to two,

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:57.100
x is going to be equal to negative one.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.712
When x is equal to negative one,

00:01:59.712 --> 00:02:01.523
y is equal to four.

00:02:01.523 --> 00:02:03.218
When x is equal to negative one,

00:02:03.218 --> 00:02:04.542
y is equal to four.

00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:07.023
Notice we shifted to the left

00:02:08.678 --> 00:02:10.140
by three.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.358
So this thing, which isn't our final graph

00:02:12.358 --> 00:02:14.308
that we're looking for, is gonna look

00:02:18.824 --> 00:02:20.745
something like,

00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:24.704
like that, which shifted,
it's y equals two to the x,

00:02:24.704 --> 00:02:27.065
shifted to the left by three.

00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:29.456
Now let's figure out what the graph of,

00:02:29.456 --> 00:02:31.766
now let's multiply this
expression times negative one.

00:02:31.766 --> 00:02:33.647
Notice we're slowly building up

00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:35.017
to our goal.

00:02:35.017 --> 00:02:36.642
Now let's figure out the graph of y

00:02:36.642 --> 00:02:39.056
is equal to negative one times two

00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:42.098
to the x plus three.

00:02:42.098 --> 00:02:44.745
Here, when y equals two
to the x plus three,

00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:46.417
if we multiply that times negative one,

00:02:46.417 --> 00:02:47.894
whatever y we had, we're gonna have

00:02:47.894 --> 00:02:49.298
the negative of that.

00:02:49.298 --> 00:02:50.726
Instead of when x is
equal to negative three

00:02:50.726 --> 00:02:52.537
having positive one, when
x equals negative three,

00:02:52.537 --> 00:02:53.733
you're gonna have negative one.

00:02:53.733 --> 00:02:55.474
We multiplied by negative one.

00:02:55.474 --> 00:02:57.576
When x is equal to negative
one, instead of having four,

00:02:57.576 --> 00:03:00.525
you're going to have negative four.

00:03:00.525 --> 00:03:03.241
Our graph is gonna be flipped over,

00:03:03.241 --> 00:03:06.318
it's flipped over the x axis.

00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:08.494
It's going to look something

00:03:10.984 --> 00:03:12.157
like this.

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:14.130
This is not a perfect
drawing, but it'll give us

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.605
a sense of things, and we can look

00:03:15.605 --> 00:03:18.182
at which of these graphs match up to that.

00:03:18.182 --> 00:03:22.048
Then finally, we wanna
add that four there.

00:03:22.048 --> 00:03:23.835
We wanna figure out the graph of y

00:03:23.835 --> 00:03:26.761
equals negative one times two to the x

00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:29.699
plus three plus four.

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:31.358
We wanna take what we just had

00:03:31.358 --> 00:03:33.401
and shift it up by four.

00:03:33.401 --> 00:03:36.895
Instead of this being a
negative one right over here,

00:03:36.895 --> 00:03:40.413
this is going to be a negative one

00:03:40.413 --> 00:03:43.444
plus four is three.

00:03:43.444 --> 00:03:44.964
Instead of this being a negative four,

00:03:44.964 --> 00:03:48.644
negative four plus four is zero.

00:03:48.644 --> 00:03:50.687
Instead of our horizontal asymptote

00:03:50.687 --> 00:03:53.357
being at y equals zero,
our horizontal asymptote

00:03:53.357 --> 00:03:55.698
is going be at y equals four.

00:03:55.698 --> 00:03:58.322
It's gonna look like, let me draw,

00:03:58.322 --> 00:03:59.981
I can do a better job than that.

00:03:59.981 --> 00:04:01.456
Our horizontal asymptote is gonna

00:04:01.456 --> 00:04:03.522
be right over there, so our graph is going

00:04:03.522 --> 00:04:05.031
to look something like

00:04:08.565 --> 00:04:09.587
this.

00:04:09.587 --> 00:04:12.524
We just shifted that red graph up by four.

00:04:15.181 --> 00:04:16.563
Shifted it up by four.

00:04:16.563 --> 00:04:19.025
We have a horizontal
asymptote at y equals four.

00:04:19.025 --> 00:04:22.507
Let's look at which of
these choices match that.

00:04:22.507 --> 00:04:25.037
Choice A right over here
has a horizontal asymptote

00:04:25.037 --> 00:04:28.590
at y equals four, but it is shifted

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.434
on the horizontal
direction inappropriately.

00:04:31.434 --> 00:04:32.990
In fact, it looks like it might have not

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.033
been shifted to the left.

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:36.972
We can rule this one out.

00:04:36.972 --> 00:04:38.969
Let's rule that one out.

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:40.958
This one over here,

00:04:43.355 --> 00:04:46.792
this one approaches our
asymptote as x increases,

00:04:46.792 --> 00:04:48.812
so that's not right.

00:04:48.812 --> 00:04:50.287
It should approach our asymptote

00:04:50.287 --> 00:04:53.177
as x decreases, so we ruled that one out.

00:04:53.177 --> 00:04:57.100
Choice C looks like what we just graphed.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.270
Horizontal asymptote at x equals four.

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:04.287
When x equals negative
three, y is equal to three.

00:05:04.287 --> 00:05:05.772
That's what we got.

00:05:05.772 --> 00:05:07.490
When x is equal to negative one,

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.394
y is equal to zero.

00:05:09.394 --> 00:05:10.811
This looks right.

00:05:10.811 --> 00:05:13.435
You could even try those points out.

00:05:13.435 --> 00:05:15.582
We like choice C.

00:05:15.582 --> 00:05:17.741
D is clearly off.

00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:20.032
There's another way that
you could have tackled this.

00:05:20.032 --> 00:05:22.029
I like tackling it with
a transformation way

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:23.432
'cause you could see how you got from two

00:05:23.432 --> 00:05:25.880
to the x to this right over here.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:28.701
But you could have just
thought it through and ya said,

00:05:28.701 --> 00:05:30.364
when x becomes really, really, really,

00:05:30.364 --> 00:05:32.361
really negative, this
term is going to become

00:05:32.361 --> 00:05:34.684
really, really, really small, and if this

00:05:34.684 --> 00:05:36.530
is approaching zero, then
even if you multiply it

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.875
by negative one, it's going
to be a negative number

00:05:38.875 --> 00:05:42.634
approaching zero, but we're
going to approach four,

00:05:42.634 --> 00:05:44.631
this whole expression is
going to approach four

00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:45.731
from below.

00:05:45.731 --> 00:05:47.564
You're going to have
that horizontal asymptote

00:05:47.564 --> 00:05:48.889
at y equals four.

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:50.665
Then you could try out two values.

00:05:50.665 --> 00:05:52.986
You could just say,

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:55.226
you could just do something like this,

00:05:55.226 --> 00:05:57.571
x and y.

00:05:57.571 --> 00:06:00.462
You could say when x is,

00:06:00.462 --> 00:06:03.062
as x approaches negative infinity,

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:05.791
y is going to approach positive four.

00:06:05.791 --> 00:06:08.948
When x is going to be

00:06:08.948 --> 00:06:11.862
negative three, when x is negative three,

00:06:11.862 --> 00:06:14.451
y is going to be positive three.

00:06:14.451 --> 00:06:15.902
You can calculate that.

00:06:15.902 --> 00:06:18.203
Two to the negative three plus three.

00:06:18.203 --> 00:06:20.511
That's two to the zero, which
is one times negative one,

00:06:20.511 --> 00:06:23.077
which is negative one plus four is three.

00:06:23.077 --> 00:06:24.551
Then you could say when x is equal

00:06:24.551 --> 00:06:28.731
to negative one, negative
one plus three is two.

00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:30.403
Two squared is four.

00:06:30.403 --> 00:06:32.260
Four times negative one is negative four

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.873
plus four is zero.

00:06:33.873 --> 00:06:35.150
Another way you could have done it

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.974
is if you'd thought about
the horizontal asymptote

00:06:36.974 --> 00:06:39.063
and you found two interesting points,

00:06:39.063 --> 00:06:41.454
you could have said, "Which
of these matches that?"

00:06:41.454 --> 00:06:43.613
The only one that does is
this one right over here,

00:06:43.613 --> 00:06:45.053
negative three, comma, three.

00:06:45.053 --> 00:06:46.515
Negative one, comma, zero.

00:06:46.515 --> 00:06:49.395
Horizontal asymptote at y equals four.

00:06:49.395 --> 00:06:50.893
You'd be all done.

00:06:50.893 --> 00:06:53.406
Either way, hopefully, you enjoyed that.
