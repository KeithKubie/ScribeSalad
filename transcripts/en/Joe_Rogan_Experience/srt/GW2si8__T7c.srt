1
00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:05,250
Oh yeah, that's all he is. And
we're live. That's it. Hi. Hello?

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:08,950
Richie. Yeah, this stuff. Purple
Venom. That's what he calls it.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,940
That's what his friend calls it. And
uh, yeah, it's friends like, you know,

4
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:14,580
I'm pretty skeptical, skeptical
about other people's stuff.

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,970
But then you try to hope. Now
was that a coke nail? No Fun. No.

6
00:00:17,971 --> 00:00:22,050
I know people think long and people
think that their coke nails do not know

7
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:25,500
they're real. You. You don't
do coke. I don't do coke ever.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,140
Have you ever done me? I do. Coke
zero. I have done, I, I have done a,

9
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,280
it's like coke light. It's like, it
looks like coke. You can snort it.

10
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:36,390
It feels like coke weed doesn't give
you high. Um, no. Uh, I, I have,

11
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:40,740
I've tried it. I would say honestly
maybe four times and I've never,

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,970
it's always just felt like I just took
three shots of espresso and I'm not,

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,630
it's not really, it doesn't do
anything for me. Then I'm like,

14
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,550
I better get him a better invest in that.

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:54,720
I need to try it one day because it
just, I need to know what's going on.

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,520
I'm 51 years old. How do I know
no what coke is? I, you know,

17
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,710
I think it's worth, I mean, if
you don't, if you, you know,

18
00:01:01,711 --> 00:01:04,680
if you don't have a predisposition for
being a hyper addictive personality,

19
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:06,000
I definitely do. But Oh gosh,

20
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,030
I'm also wise enough to know and I can
quit things and you've got experience.

21
00:01:11,161 --> 00:01:15,870
You can control yourself. But like
I, I, I was never, I was never like,

22
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,810
I guess I've just never been
someone who's like, Oh shit.

23
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:21,390
Gotta have that forever. Like
I've never been that way.

24
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:25,050
The only thing that I'm reduced to now
is just weed. That's it. Well, me too.

25
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:28,410
But I also think that it's one of those
things if your, if your life is healthy,

26
00:01:28,411 --> 00:01:30,960
if you have a good balance and you're
enjoying your time and you're being

27
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:32,880
creative and you have good
friends and you have fun,

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,010
you're not looking for
something to fuck your life up.

29
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,970
I think many of the times when you
dealing with people that have like severe,

30
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:41,670
debilitating addictions that are
really just taking over their life,

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:45,900
there's something else going on. Almost
always just like problems, you know,

32
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:49,570
relationship problems, work
problems, life problems. Yeah.

33
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:52,290
They're not happy yet.
There's an emptiness.

34
00:01:52,291 --> 00:01:57,210
There's an emptiness that wants to be fed
or maybe you have a lot of success and

35
00:01:57,211 --> 00:01:58,560
you're freaking out about the success.

36
00:01:58,561 --> 00:02:02,370
I think that happens with some
celebrities. Yes, I think so. Yeah.

37
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:04,890
Overstimulation and you don't know how
to handle, let's do this show. Yeah,

38
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,090
let's do it. Yeah. Here it is.

39
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:09,960
So you can have the first I used to
an automated machine or the auto.

40
00:02:09,961 --> 00:02:11,580
Have you heard of it? No. So cool.

41
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:14,130
It's like this like little reminder
and it's like grinder and it,

42
00:02:14,131 --> 00:02:17,870
and it fits on a tube that you put an
empty rolling thing in there and say like

43
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:21,450
you put that in there or you got
it. Um, and then it's like a, yeah,

44
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:25,140
it's like a clear tube. You put it
in the pre-rolled, you know, empty,

45
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:27,450
whatever joint thing. And then a,

46
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:30,360
and then you put this machine that
just goes over, attaches magnetically,

47
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,150
and then you put it in your weed and
you just press a button and it's like

48
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:33,984
coffee makers

49
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:38,970
and it fills it up perfectly.

50
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:41,550
And then you just pack it by shaking
it and twisting it and you're done.

51
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:46,050
These goddamn stoners today,
they're getting too crazy.
I don't, I rarely spoke.

52
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,610
I always make exceptions for stuff
like this. You look at it? Yeah. Wow.

53
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:54,010
That's actually a pretty
sleek looking. Yeah,

54
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:57,360
that's by banana brothers
I think. You know, I,

55
00:02:57,960 --> 00:03:01,690
I smoked pretty regularly but
um, I got high with be real.

56
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:05,170
I did a this smoke box
show and I'm like, okay,

57
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:06,790
I'm going to be real a rat Cypress Hill.

58
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,240
I was separate and it would catch
him how dialogize I bought it.

59
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,770
I just see now I know nothing
about hip hop. See that damn ready?

60
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,940
I not know anything about Cypress Hill.
I know, I know. People are always like,

61
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:19,480
you gotta know about hip hop. I'm
like, I know shit. I know. Run DMC,

62
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,880
you really don't know any hip hop.

63
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,510
Now I kind of stopped after
the Bohemian phase, you know,

64
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:28,310
like after a tribe called
quest and de la soul.

65
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:31,780
Like it just kind of lost me because it
then it turned into I liked gangster in

66
00:03:31,781 --> 00:03:34,030
the beginning, you know, cause it
was something new and you're like,

67
00:03:34,031 --> 00:03:37,030
what the fuck is this? Oh that's
so cool. You know? But uh,

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,930
then it kind of morphed into club hop
where it just was all about bitches and

69
00:03:40,931 --> 00:03:43,810
cars and all that shit. And it was
really the lyrics, the beats I loved.

70
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,770
I thought it was cool, but
I just like, no, I mean I,

71
00:03:47,771 --> 00:03:52,060
because I left in 95, I left pop in 95,

72
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:55,510
96 and then I know there's plenty
of hip hop heads. I'd be like, dude,

73
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:57,130
you gotta check out so you
gotta check out. You get your,

74
00:03:57,131 --> 00:04:00,400
I know there's shit loads of shit and
I'm, maybe I'll go back into that phase.

75
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:03,700
But mostly I just liked the beats
and the production and the lyrics.

76
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:06,250
I'm not really, I'm not, I'm
not a lyrics guy anyways.

77
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:11,200
I am a lyrics guy and Nas is definitely
my favorite lyricist because his stuff

78
00:04:11,201 --> 00:04:12,730
is so creative. Like what it was that one,

79
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:15,220
we did everything backwards
to the whole song backwards.

80
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,150
Like he started at the end then
what the fuck was that called?

81
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,590
James can rewind. Yeah. I mean
I mean made you look creative.

82
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:26,410
Yeah. It made you look like
I saw that and I was like,

83
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,090
that was actually a
moment where I was like,

84
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,490
Oh am I gonna am I going to start
getting back into this shit?

85
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:33,940
Cause cause it was intelligent.
Um, you know what I mean?

86
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,340
Like my thing is like if you're going
to be boastful and all this shit,

87
00:04:36,341 --> 00:04:39,200
it should be like Muhammad Ali. Right,
right, right. You should have clever,

88
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,610
clever flare, but also you can
just be right in someone's face.

89
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:43,960
But I liked that.

90
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:46,840
But then when people are like kind of
going off about how much money they have

91
00:04:46,841 --> 00:04:50,450
and all that shit, I'm like, I don't
really care about that. Well I,

92
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,490
I've analyzed this many times while
under the influence, the culture,

93
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:56,620
it comes from not having something.

94
00:04:56,621 --> 00:04:58,840
And then once you have something
bragged about it, right,

95
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:02,530
like that's like Jay z,
like that's a 99 problems.

96
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:06,490
He talks about that 99 problems.
Yeah, I mean I get it, I get it.

97
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,090
But like at the same time if the,

98
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,010
if it just sounds like basically the
three things that everyone talks about,

99
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:17,011
which is like women cars of some sort
and money or the things that you can buy

100
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:20,510
with money after awhile it just
all bleeds together. It's all this,

101
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,010
it's the same song and I mean it's so
dope that you can come from nothing and

102
00:05:24,011 --> 00:05:27,130
you can work your way up and you can
hustle and you can get stuff going in.

103
00:05:27,131 --> 00:05:30,130
But like once you get to that place,
like why not take advantage of that?

104
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,810
Plus what about run the jewels? I've
heard good things about chance the rapper.

105
00:05:34,811 --> 00:05:37,870
I've heard good things about it. God
Dang. I know. I don't know shit man.

106
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,100
I'm more of like a the jewels. So
cream and electronic guy. I like music.

107
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,380
Let me, let me turn you
on to some run the jewels.

108
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,560
I wish we could play it on the podcast,
but then we can't do that anymore.

109
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,730
Back in your day, yeah, they would
run your Julius and out of town,

110
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,810
but back in the day when you
had a, like the Internet was,

111
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,340
no one knew what a podcast was.
You could do all kinds of shit.

112
00:05:58,341 --> 00:06:01,490
You could just play things.
I mean you still can,

113
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,530
I mean the best live stream you could
take him down and get d monetized.

114
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,090
You get a strike against your
channel. If you get three strikes,

115
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:12,440
they take your channel down
permanently. [inaudible] Youtube. Yes.

116
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,350
That's the real problem. I'd
choose the real problem. I'm a,

117
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,170
I'm bypassing all that very
soon. What are you doing?

118
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,440
I'm just doing my own live
streaming. That's all right.

119
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,830
Yeah cause that way I just don't have
to worry about all that bullshit. Yeah,

120
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:28,190
I mean that lead, that's where it's
probably going to have to go. Yes.

121
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:32,970
But at the same time everybody's
at Youtube. Yeah. So, so the,

122
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:37,430
the secret is, or the question is like
how can you, it could be both. Yeah,

123
00:06:37,431 --> 00:06:42,140
exactly. That. That was the way to
zero. Zero Alcohol High Mountain.

124
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,330
Are you serious? Yeah,
I'll try to zero. Yeah.

125
00:06:44,331 --> 00:06:47,640
Cause my problem with
alcohol is alcohol. So yeah.

126
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,640
Actually they taste like
a regular Hanukkah trick.

127
00:06:52,641 --> 00:06:57,290
What I found out, if you see
these, what does that, it's a

128
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,780
microtech uh, California
legal switchblade. What? Yeah.

129
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,020
What are you stabbing people at a tiny
knife. What are you doing right now?

130
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:09,600
I've been going on since I saw you. I
like it. Well, I like having done that.

131
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:12,070
I'm from Montana. You always have
a knife. You just always have it.

132
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,250
It's like the greatest tool,
but uh, it makes sense.

133
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,540
How's the button go? Okay. So hold
it the opposite way. Turn it around.

134
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,180
Flip it around. Yep. And then
the button on the top side.

135
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,190
See there's like a lever. No thing here.

136
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:30,020
So this is on the back of
the glass breaker. Okay. Oh,

137
00:07:30,021 --> 00:07:33,080
glass breaker for like if you're
in your car, you know, or whatever.

138
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,520
I needed to break the window. Jesus.
Um, but uh, here's the switch.

139
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:40,760
Does that really what that's for?
Yes. Let me say that mean. Crazy.

140
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,540
So this would break
your window? Yeah. Hmm.

141
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:48,500
But how many people do you think
could break a window with this?

142
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,620
I bet if you've got a lot of people
and some old car windows and like,

143
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,420
like line them up and just fucking,
yeah because it seems like that's like,

144
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,320
that's like kind of weird.

145
00:07:57,350 --> 00:08:01,070
A weird like standardized tip for
glass breakers really. That crazy.

146
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,090
So would you see, but it seems like
it's slime in your hand. It doesn't,

147
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,650
it's too small. I think if
you, you know, if you wedge it,

148
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,190
if you held it tight and your fist,
you know with your thumb over.

149
00:08:10,191 --> 00:08:14,420
I think if you hit at it's more about
velocity I think rather than strength

150
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,950
black it. Yeah.

151
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:20,530
Because the way it's designed is to just
be like super like precise strike wants

152
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:23,930
carrying a glass breaker with them,
man. Yeah we're playing the games.

153
00:08:23,931 --> 00:08:26,990
You Ready? Do you have water? You have
like bottled water in your comment cards?

154
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,470
I have bottled water, I
have a jumper, jumper self.

155
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,030
You know you can jump yourself if you
have bottled water in your car in La

156
00:08:35,031 --> 00:08:36,230
you're basically drinking.

157
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:40,730
What is that shit that comes the leaks
into your from your plastic PC. BPS.

158
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,780
I'm not using, I have glass. It's all
glass. You have glass. How dare now.

159
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:47,930
Fuck that. I don't, I'm not, I mean like
people are going to be like bitch him.

160
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,960
Cause I talk about plastic
bottles all the time, but oh,

161
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:54,850
because we have one here. Yeah, it's
you, it's a better solution for that. B,

162
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,870
get glass and get a water
judge. Hey, just you just get a,

163
00:08:58,050 --> 00:09:00,750
you just get a municipal
filter and that's it.

164
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,990
And you get alkalized water
room temperature, whatever.

165
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:07,530
And you can just have clean water and
you just have tons and tons of vessels.

166
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,290
I'm sure. What someone would BKR would
sponsor you or something like that.

167
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:14,190
That'd be kr. They're
uh, they're uh, like uh,

168
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:18,270
I guess you'd a canteen company or
water carrying like Judd Company.

169
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:21,190
It's having people drink out of
mason jars. That would be terrible.

170
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:25,560
Like old folks. Yeah. Hell yeah. Are
you kidding? Yeah. It'd be like a,

171
00:09:25,561 --> 00:09:27,410
you know, like grandma's
kitchen cupboard. Yeah.

172
00:09:27,411 --> 00:09:29,130
Why do people like
drinking out of Mason Jars?

173
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:32,820
I think it started with
grandma's. What was that band?

174
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:37,710
What was that one brand?
No, it was that one. Um,

175
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:43,100
sort of a bluesy rocky
band that pretty recently.

176
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:48,900
Bam. Goddamn whizzer. Jamie's
damn wizard. How he do it?

177
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:52,650
He's how he do it. He knows what I'm
going to ask before I, he googles it.

178
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:57,150
He's a wizard. He got something. He's got
something, some special talent, but a,

179
00:09:57,151 --> 00:10:00,690
yeah, those guys, they dressed like
they were from another era. Right.

180
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:04,040
They wore like weird clothes
from like the pioneer days.

181
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,740
They look like time travelers, like
from a steam conqueror. I mean kind of.

182
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,290
I mean, I know what you're saying.
Like in the beginning, you know,

183
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:14,510
Fortune Fester, the, Oh yeah, yeah,
yeah. It's really funny. She's funny.

184
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,710
She had her, she's, I
wish I remember her joke,

185
00:10:16,711 --> 00:10:20,340
but she had a funny joke about
Mumford and sons and mason jars.

186
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:24,270
W really sweet. Yeah. Oh, that's good.

187
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:29,150
I think it was like something
to the tune of, you know, shoes,

188
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:32,400
Mason jars for real, not like,
not like this bullshit. Oh yeah.

189
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:35,580
So I actually grew up poor. I think
that was it. I apologize from wrong.

190
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,360
That wasn't, I mean, that's very
funny. I mean, she is. She's so rad.

191
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:43,020
I saw her in a, an Oh
and Australia. Sydney.

192
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:48,030
She's doing a podcast with Tom Papa.
Oh yeah. Who's Tom Papa? Sorry,

193
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,070
dare you again. Sorry guys. Tom Papa
is a brilliant standup comedian.

194
00:10:53,190 --> 00:10:55,710
Really, really funny guy.
Super, Super Nice guy too.

195
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:59,790
And he's the master of bread.
He read bread. Oh Shit.

196
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:05,010
He makes his own sourdough bread and it
is sensational out that, that, that's,

197
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,780
that's, that's too much. Versus
to be able to take over here.

198
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,740
He brings a loaf of bread and
grass fed butter. Oh no, Bro.

199
00:11:13,741 --> 00:11:17,430
You cannot resist us. This
bread, it's bread is so good.

200
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:22,050
Fuck your Kito Diet. If it
does include Tom Papa's bread.

201
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,590
Fuck your Quito Diet. Does he
sell it at a bake? No, no, no, no.

202
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:28,110
Just makes himself, there
he is. And he has a,

203
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:31,800
here's a television show he's doing on a
food network where he's visiting bakers

204
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,290
. He's a brilliant guy and super nice guy.

205
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:38,250
Like couldn't be a nicer guy and just
loves making bags. He's so silly.

206
00:11:38,251 --> 00:11:42,630
That's meat and his bread.
It's so good. And it's like,

207
00:11:42,631 --> 00:11:47,430
I really believe this, that if you get
the food from someone who's really cool,

208
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,450
like it feels different. It
tastes different. And Tom's just,

209
00:11:51,451 --> 00:11:54,460
Tom is just such a nice guy and
he's so funny and he's so smart.

210
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:56,140
Like when you're eating his bread,

211
00:11:56,170 --> 00:12:00,340
like you feel like I'm eating a
cool guy's bread. Yeah. You know,

212
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,590
it's like someone who you love cooks.

213
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:04,870
You sound like if your mom cooks
you something, it's like wow.

214
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,840
So it's not just good. It's good. And
it comes from love. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

215
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:12,670
yeah. Cause yeah, the person who made
it to standing right there. Right.

216
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,690
You're having it. Yeah. It's pretty
unique experience. Especially with bread.

217
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:20,950
Yeah. I think that's the big thing with
food too, with, with cooking. You know,

218
00:12:20,951 --> 00:12:25,240
I, I never really thought of food as
an art form until I started watching no

219
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:26,110
reservations,

220
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:30,250
which was a Anthony Bourdain's original
show backwards on the travel channel.

221
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,140
Okay. And then I was like,
oh Duh. Like I in my head,

222
00:12:35,141 --> 00:12:37,960
like they were just cooks. I'll
go. They just cook and food.

223
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,380
Cause I cooked food before I used to
work at Newport creamery. I made burgers.

224
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,980
Yeah. Make grilled cheese. Sure.
Yeah. Yeah. That's cool. Good.

225
00:12:44,981 --> 00:12:47,950
So it's like I knew how to put
the fucking fries in. Yeah.

226
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:52,540
But watching these chefs create these
like really elaborate creative dishes,

227
00:12:52,541 --> 00:12:56,110
you start going, oh,
oh this is an art form.

228
00:12:56,111 --> 00:13:00,300
It's just a like a weird one.
Like it's temporary. It doesn't,

229
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,440
don't only exist for a
short window in time,

230
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,310
but now that we have film of it and
now that we have photographs of it,

231
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,700
like things in Instagram, now
you start to appreciate that. Oh,

232
00:13:09,701 --> 00:13:12,730
it looks amazing too. I
guess part of the thing,

233
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,880
it's like if you could have
like the most incredible steak,

234
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:19,360
but it came to you and it looked like
the shittiest looking lentil soup,

235
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:22,980
like split pea soup. It's like
a split. Just put just a Gr,

236
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:25,330
just the peas though.
Just a bowl of green.

237
00:13:25,750 --> 00:13:28,930
But it was the most incredible taste,
like, yeah. But it looks weird. Yes.

238
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:31,780
Right, right, right. But yeah, but
they're like, they're making things like,

239
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:34,680
yeah, they're addressing it as
many senses as possible now.

240
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:38,440
Like everything red looks
good. Yeah. Looks like seven.

241
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:41,890
You want to hit cross in the outside of
those little slices on the top of the

242
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:45,610
circle the bread. Like look at that.
See how it gets. Yeah, I know. Yeah.

243
00:13:45,670 --> 00:13:48,720
And you're like, oh, this has to,
we have to take care of this. Yes.

244
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:53,290
It's our message. It's art too. It's
like, it's a temporary art form.

245
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,060
We just think of art as
something like, you know,

246
00:13:55,061 --> 00:13:57,880
that Buddhist statue or something
that just lasts forever. Yeah.

247
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,080
But there's some art, like a sandcastle
temporary. Well, you know, in a,

248
00:14:02,081 --> 00:14:05,980
in a weird way. Um, or in, in a weird way,

249
00:14:05,981 --> 00:14:09,700
music is kind of like that if it's
not recorded, right? Yeah. Well, no,

250
00:14:09,701 --> 00:14:13,870
I mean if it is recorded because
you only experienced it temporarily,

251
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:18,010
but it is this as an idea in
your head, you know, that like a,

252
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,130
like a ghost image of it. But then
when you listened, listened to it,

253
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:24,130
when you press play and you listen
to it, it's happening in real time.

254
00:14:24,131 --> 00:14:27,250
As soon as you stop it, it's
no longer, no longer exists.

255
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,840
So you're still just like in the
kind of shadow memory of it. Right.

256
00:14:31,841 --> 00:14:36,190
If you're not interacting with
it, it doesn't exist. Yeah. Wow.

257
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,410
Yeah. Imagine there was something
like that you could do with smells,

258
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:46,120
right. Oh, smells one sense. That
doesn't get any love like your eyes,

259
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:49,630
people who make all these
beautiful things. Right. Your ears.

260
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,980
People make beautiful
music. Yeah. You got like

261
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,590
perfume, Cologne and some fucking flowers.

262
00:14:54,591 --> 00:14:58,280
It's all you got [inaudible] and weird
shit like Pachulia where like settle

263
00:14:58,281 --> 00:15:01,690
down, settle down. So that way
you wouldn't set it down. What?

264
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,870
You wouldn't have beads settle down.
Settle Down with your instinct.

265
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:11,780
Incense sticks, amber,
amber sticks, amber smells.

266
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,040
By the way, Ms Pat, after she
was on, she sent me incentive.

267
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,640
Did you send it to you
to Black Pussy incense?

268
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,090
Does she make one? No, she was
just talking about crazy incense.

269
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,370
A flavor that she, she,
she's aware of. Oh,

270
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,330
she's saying she uses them or people use,

271
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:34,730
I mean the thing is you know that
there's a niche market where people were

272
00:15:34,731 --> 00:15:38,490
making custom incense with names like
that. Right? Like they legitimately are.

273
00:15:38,690 --> 00:15:41,930
I'm naming them that way
because it's a hip thing. Yeah.

274
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:45,710
That's a very specific kind of person.
Right? If you're in an intense person,

275
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:49,670
you have some kind of rug on the floor,
like some kind of Persian type rug.

276
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:53,720
Is Ms Pat that she said?
Yeah. So what is it?

277
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,860
Hey Joe Rogan could have said
you. These one says button naked.

278
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,570
What is the other ones? How many lack of
love. There you go. Black butter. Yeah,

279
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:07,280
pussy to. Do you know Ms Pat? No. Oh my
God, you got to meet her. She's a funny,

280
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:10,370
she's one of the funniest human
beings on earth for sure. Damn.

281
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,730
One of the funniest people I've ever
met, like right up there with Joey Diaz.

282
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:16,640
Shit. She's so funny. She's ridiculous.

283
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,400
Like you leave a podcast with
her and your fucking face hurts.

284
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:22,130
Someone said that if you get
John Witherspoon, Joey Diaz,

285
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:23,720
and miss pat on a podcast together,

286
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:27,890
we would like break the space time
continuum. Are you going to do it?

287
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:31,470
Fuck yeah, I would love to do
this, but I would just, I would,

288
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:34,360
I would shut my mouth. I
wouldn't say a word. I'm like,

289
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,370
I just want them to have fun.
Do you know John Witherspoon?

290
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,830
I don't know dude. He came on with his
son. His son. JD is a comic as well.

291
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,740
Yeah, I met JD at the comedy store and
we're talking about his dad. I'm like,

292
00:16:45,741 --> 00:16:50,180
your dad is, he's like epic human
being like, he's so fucking funny.

293
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:52,700
And he's like, let me, let me get my dad
to come into the podcast. We're like,

294
00:16:52,701 --> 00:16:56,240
yeah, let's do it. I would love to have
you guys on, let's see. Come on. So, uh,

295
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:59,420
it might acts with my idea. I don't
remember how it came out. But anyway,

296
00:16:59,421 --> 00:17:03,680
he comes in here and it's like,
the sun is like completely normal.

297
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:08,620
Jay d intelligent. He's funny.
He's like very, very like you've,

298
00:17:08,621 --> 00:17:13,400
you've, you know, you're not shocked
by him. He's a funny, Smart Guy,

299
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,470
but his dad is from another planet.

300
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:19,040
Everything he says is funny
the way he says it. It's funny,

301
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:22,690
he does not give a fuck. Oh,
I know that cat dude. Yeah,

302
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,470
he's on like his own
groove. He's on this a,

303
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:29,480
I don't give a fuck times a million groove

304
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,640
and it's been doing it a long time. Even
as it sounds like laughing like wow.

305
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:37,550
He's like, see this is what I grew
up with. I'm like, that is crazy.

306
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:41,710
He's so funny. Like that guy. You can
make him funny in a movie. You know,

307
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:44,210
you give him a good movie part,
he'll deal, do great in it.

308
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:47,690
But he will never be able to compare it
to him. Just being him in the moment.

309
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,160
Cause you lose that in
the moment. Well you know,

310
00:17:50,161 --> 00:17:53,310
he doesn't have anything planned out.
He's not reading a fucking script.

311
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:58,110
The guy just for three hours is just
hilarious about anything about shoes.

312
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:01,200
He's hilarious about money.
He's hilarious about his drink.

313
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:06,180
He gets to put his money in his
pocket and rub it like he's, yeah,

314
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:09,590
he like can hit any, any angle,
anything is fair game. It's,

315
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:12,660
he's doing a kind of art.
The Art of being him,

316
00:18:12,661 --> 00:18:16,620
this is what me and his son were talking
about and this is why it relates he's

317
00:18:16,621 --> 00:18:20,460
doing an art form, but it seems like
he's just being himself and he is,

318
00:18:20,730 --> 00:18:22,620
but he's figured out how to beat himself.

319
00:18:22,621 --> 00:18:26,910
That is the most hilarious to the most
people and it's a matter of whether or

320
00:18:26,911 --> 00:18:30,820
not you can plug that into a
movie successfully. Schmidt,

321
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,630
maybe the best thing about
him, just let them talk.

322
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:37,200
Just let them talk like
fuck your fuck your scripts.

323
00:18:37,470 --> 00:18:41,790
Like this guy's got a thing. You
know he's got a thing. Yes. That is,

324
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:45,090
it's an art about art. It's
like, it's just like cooking.

325
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,980
It's just like any like just like music.
There's an art to being a person even.

326
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:54,540
Yeah, for sure. Yeah. Right.
Like why are some girls sexier?

327
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:59,250
Is it just biology or is there an art
to the way they communicate with you?

328
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,570
Like when people are being flirtatious
and and talking to each other.

329
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,010
There's an art to that. Just like a
little bit of a dance going on there. Yes,

330
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:12,570
absolutely. Some people are
better at it. Yeah, I mean, yeah.

331
00:19:12,571 --> 00:19:14,850
I mean it's a, you know,
what gets your attention?

332
00:19:14,851 --> 00:19:18,540
I mean there's so many factors and it's
like what it's like also like what you

333
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:22,800
tend to view, what's the first cue
that generally will set you off,

334
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:26,160
whatever that is experienced as you
were a kid or you know, someone,

335
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:29,970
your aunt or whatever it was was really
cool and your cousin was a really sexy,

336
00:19:29,971 --> 00:19:30,990
and those two,

337
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,050
a combination of those two elements
are like something that you hit.

338
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:37,080
But I will say like, yeah, I
think it's just someone who's,

339
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:39,750
who's come when they're comfortable
with themselves. They just have,

340
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,550
it also depends on what
you're looking for too,

341
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,330
but because there's a co-residents,
there has to be just like art,

342
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:49,470
just like music. We're talking about
like, do you like it or not music to you,

343
00:19:49,471 --> 00:19:52,030
it might be the greatest song of
all time to Jamie. He's like, yeah,

344
00:19:52,110 --> 00:19:54,300
I can take it or leave it. Yeah.
Yeah. And then we can have a con,

345
00:19:54,330 --> 00:19:57,180
you can have an argument about it, which
is really sweet. No one's ever right.

346
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:00,450
The bottom out. Yeah. It's all
subjective. Love Motley crew.

347
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:02,730
You love Molly crew. It's not, it's not,

348
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:05,310
this isn't anything wrong with
bloody crude example, but if you,

349
00:20:05,311 --> 00:20:07,350
if you're fucking at
home by yourself going

350
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:13,050
[inaudible] you're loving
it. That, that's art.

351
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,350
Like why was that judge, I do that with
Whitesnake all the fucking debts up.

352
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:23,700
Told the story before. But a dude sent
me in a Whitesnake is set and a, I,

353
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,610
I used to, it's in the office because, uh,

354
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,550
I had a girlfriend that made me throw
it away after I got in a car accident.

355
00:20:29,551 --> 00:20:32,700
I had a Whitesnake is set in my
call. Why? Why don't you make it?

356
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,580
Because she thought it was bad Juju.
She's really into telling me what to do.

357
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,630
She was older than me.
Okay. And, um, she, uh,

358
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,990
she's packing up all my stuff cause
I, my car was broken, you know, got,

359
00:20:43,230 --> 00:20:48,160
I got t boned and uh, as I'm grabbing
all my stuff, um, she's like, leave that.

360
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:50,700
I go leave what? She's
like, leave the white snake,

361
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:55,570
see like you gotta get over that music.
And I was like, really? She's like,

362
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:57,940
yeah, it's terrible music.
She was in like the pixies,

363
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,910
that kind of Shit I don't even know
existed back then. I loved that.

364
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:03,100
I loved them too. But I
also loved Whitesnake.

365
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:08,130
There's a thing that people do though
where they only like things that make them

366
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:12,970
appear smart or interesting and
there's like, it's like a hustle.

367
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:16,550
Like you, you tell people you're
really an Indian food and you really,

368
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:20,330
you might really be, but there's also
a thing you're doing. Like you're,

369
00:21:20,590 --> 00:21:23,080
you're that person that's
only into the cool stuff,

370
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,880
but like that fucking
Whitesnake song is bad ass.

371
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,120
[inaudible] yeah, that's, it's awesome.

372
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:34,180
They only had a few that
were like really good.

373
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:38,320
They had that song is fucking
bang and to this day is this love.

374
00:21:38,350 --> 00:21:42,730
That's a sexy video. That was good videos.
It's like one of my favorite videos.

375
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:44,110
It's like the coolest,

376
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,640
even though it was eighties and it was
like hyper eighties it's one of the few

377
00:21:48,641 --> 00:21:53,020
videos to me in my mind
that is, that had a style,

378
00:21:53,021 --> 00:21:56,590
that was that kind of approach
is timeless. Really? Yeah.

379
00:21:56,591 --> 00:22:00,160
In a way it's good this week,
this sincere, the sincerity of it.

380
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,490
I mean that video is sexy with tawny
contain and and and like her moving like

381
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:09,660
around the bed or whatever. It was
classy. It was, it was like sexiest,

382
00:22:09,670 --> 00:22:13,260
very adult kind of like
watch it shit I have,

383
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:18,490
but she looks amazing and, and I love
him just leaning on the wall like that.

384
00:22:18,491 --> 00:22:23,020
I mean it's like come on, just
take brick wall and he's like,

385
00:22:23,021 --> 00:22:25,810
Mr Cool Guy. Certainly it's,

386
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:28,210
it's done in such a sincere way,

387
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:33,480
but it's just on the right side of me
still thinking that it's fucking great.

388
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,300
It's great art direction. It's
promoting ridiculous interactions.

389
00:22:37,610 --> 00:22:41,740
It promote him up promoting a ridiculous,
a relationship. Just fucking talk.

390
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,580
What is all this trauma? I mean
that shit like those shots come on.

391
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:50,080
His hair is one man. He's very
serious about what he's singing.

392
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:52,450
He's like a better look and
Luke from general hospital.

393
00:22:53,710 --> 00:22:58,090
I remember Luke and Laura. That's what
that guy is like a better look in Luke.

394
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:00,760
That's so hilarious. His
hair is preposterous.

395
00:23:00,790 --> 00:23:03,730
I know everybody's hair is
just like off the chart.

396
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:07,210
Imagine if you had a friend that
just had hair like that. Like, Hey,

397
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:11,320
let's go down, let's go hit the gym.
He's like, hey man, you want to go go.

398
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:11,921
And he's Kinda like,

399
00:23:11,921 --> 00:23:16,090
look at some a gallon of hairspray and
that shit I primped out. That's just,

400
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:20,680
I mean, back then, that's just
crazy to me. That's white hair, bro.

401
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,480
Yeah. You have the solution to that.
Yeah. Yeah. Your hair, you just,

402
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:29,650
it's fantastic. You don't have to do
anything. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

403
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:34,030
It's a totally lazy, it's lazy. Yeah.
It's chaos. But at the same time like,

404
00:23:34,340 --> 00:23:38,320
ah know, but there's no work involved
in that. No. It's a beautiful chaos. Oh,

405
00:23:38,321 --> 00:23:40,450
I see what you're saying.
As opposed to like,

406
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:44,170
you know you got one of them pics and
you're spraying pics and spray. Oh yeah,

407
00:23:44,171 --> 00:23:47,210
his hair that, oh I know there's
a lot of work involved there.

408
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,740
That's a shit ton of hairsprays the
lady offset. It's just to keep pumping.

409
00:23:50,741 --> 00:23:53,190
Yeah, kind of constantly
checking, symmetry,

410
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:58,970
duty cheering and Jan,
I mean the, the guitar,

411
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:03,680
the band that like Whitesnake
the band once it was like,

412
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:07,250
it was the Super Group of hard rock like,

413
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:10,700
like it or metal. I guess you can
kind of, it kind of bleeds into that.

414
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,610
Like classic metal.

415
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:14,240
This has been a few of those supergroups
I just went freaked me out man.

416
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:18,880
I'm like, yeah, off the car. 20th doing
the Car Lady. It's like she doesn't,

417
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:20,720
she just doesn't care. She's rude.

418
00:24:20,721 --> 00:24:24,500
She's doing cartwheels and wild look up
since serious. That's what I mean man.

419
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:28,250
He's really serious about what he's
singing about and he's got three synth

420
00:24:28,251 --> 00:24:32,780
players in a row, but in the way.
Yeah, look at that. Yeah. How,

421
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,970
what does that mean?
That's kind of hardcore.

422
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:39,110
I wish we could play this cause it's
so wonderful. I do love the idea.

423
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:43,160
I mean let the hair color combination
in the car. I mean, you know what,

424
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:46,970
this is good. This is what happened when
the war on drugs had a brief victory.

425
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:50,660
Oh, what happened that you were talking
about the band for a second. I'm like,

426
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:55,470
ma'am, you are talking about
tense release times care here.

427
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,750
You're talking about the
time Jimi Hendrix in this.

428
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:05,200
Is that the absence of drugs like
Oh this music created all this coke,

429
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:10,700
this coke music. This is definitely,
maybe it's every now and then,

430
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:14,570
but it's not created by coke. Yeah,
but it's like high end party. You know,

431
00:25:14,571 --> 00:25:19,250
like these guys are living like the high
end party shit. Sure. I guess that's,

432
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:22,520
I guess that's where they're coming from.
But I mean to me that's what I like.

433
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:26,360
You know, someone described
the Ns ten's the uh, the uh,

434
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:29,480
classic stage monitors or
sorry, studio monitors.

435
00:25:29,481 --> 00:25:32,060
Like when you're switching between
different types of speakers,

436
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,600
show me what that looks like. Um,

437
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:38,060
right now you and Jamie were on the same
frequency. He's the audio guy. Oh yeah,

438
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:41,480
yeah. Well they're like a, they were
like this classic mixing and like that,

439
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:45,140
like our atone and like they're just
like speaker systems that have kind of

440
00:25:45,141 --> 00:25:48,230
become standards to a
certain degree. And so,

441
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,730
and the weird thing about Inez tens,

442
00:25:49,731 --> 00:25:52,010
it's like in the 80s when
they were using them,

443
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:54,710
I believe that's the
right name for it, but uh,

444
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,800
went in the 80s when they were
using them, it was really,

445
00:25:57,801 --> 00:25:59,630
it had so much harsh high end.

446
00:25:59,631 --> 00:26:04,190
It was so crispy sounding and they
said it was because of uh, yeah. Um,

447
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:09,220
it's because of a coke usage
and coke usage like creates a,

448
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,790
basically brains tend to favor different
sound frequencies under the influence

449
00:26:13,791 --> 00:26:18,170
of different drugs. And with coke
they like the high end crispy sizzle.

450
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,570
That was like hitting all the
time and that was all amplified.

451
00:26:20,571 --> 00:26:24,740
So then when you hear eighties
music, it tends to be, it's mixed,

452
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:25,971
not all of it,

453
00:26:25,971 --> 00:26:30,971
but a great deal of it is mixed with a
lot of like upper mid trouble minus crisp

454
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:36,290
enos. That's kind of a, that totally
makes sense. That's what, you know,

455
00:26:36,350 --> 00:26:39,910
sometimes albums need to be
remastered because of that. Wow. But,

456
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:43,920
but that speaker is responsible.
That's I, this is what I heard.

457
00:26:43,921 --> 00:26:47,760
So this is second hand information, but
position that makes sense to you. Right.

458
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,710
It does totally make sense to me. I mean,

459
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:52,740
it's one of those subtleties that you
may never think about, but then when you,

460
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:54,480
you hear about it and you learn about it,

461
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:59,110
it blows open a whole new way
of thinking about things. Well,

462
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:02,180
I don't know this, but that's what
everybody has always said about the, the,

463
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:05,570
the dead and LSD. Exactly. Yeah.

464
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:09,420
That if you like the people that don't
get the dead [inaudible] and I'm guilty

465
00:27:09,421 --> 00:27:12,600
of being one of those people. Yeah.
I'm not a huge fan, but I respect them.

466
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:16,260
It's because you haven't
listened on LSD, a parent, Lee,

467
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:20,040
according to people that
I say, you listened to the
dead on LSD and you're like,

468
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:24,390
oh my God, I get it. Oh, I
see. I see. Interesting. It's,

469
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:27,750
it's LSD music. Yeah. Yeah, totally.

470
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,580
My cousin used to follow them around.
Really? She followed it down for cod,

471
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:36,300
I want to say a couple of years where
she was on Twitter with selling bacon and

472
00:27:36,301 --> 00:27:38,700
eggs out of the car. She was total hippie.

473
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,290
That's like a real super legit hippie
that's kind of sick. That's rare.

474
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,370
So I gotta talk to her about like the
culture. It's like everyone's on acid.

475
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:51,120
They're all doing. So many
of them were doing ass trams.

476
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:55,020
I would say every one of them,
but it's like it's probably half,

477
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,060
which is crazy for a concert.

478
00:27:57,210 --> 00:28:01,340
Imagine going to a concert and half the
people were doing mushrooms like percent

479
00:28:01,470 --> 00:28:03,960
a hundred percent of the time, half
the fee. I don't know if I'm that,

480
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,420
if you're some pros we can
all say that right now.

481
00:28:06,421 --> 00:28:11,280
Going to just don't have number. I'm
sorry. I'm just guessing. I think it's a,

482
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,410
it's, it's a psychedelic inspired music
that once you're under that psychedelic,

483
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:19,440
apparently it makes sense. And this is
not me talking from personal experience.

484
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:22,590
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, it could be
one of those things where, you know,

485
00:28:22,591 --> 00:28:26,700
there's like a photo that's slightly out
of focus and then if you like bring in

486
00:28:26,701 --> 00:28:29,700
another, uh, or now
better yet, like a code.

487
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:32,160
It's like you get a picture of something
and you're like, I don't can't,

488
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:33,510
I can't tell him what it is. Abstract.

489
00:28:33,511 --> 00:28:36,900
And then you put this other layer on it
and it completes it and you're like, oh,

490
00:28:36,901 --> 00:28:41,460
that's what it is. In a way. Like
I can imagine that being true,

491
00:28:41,461 --> 00:28:46,461
but I can also say once you've
experienced music that really ignites your

492
00:28:47,191 --> 00:28:51,750
imagination. If you hear music
that sounds amazing on LSD,

493
00:28:51,930 --> 00:28:55,890
it should also sound
amazing to you personally.

494
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:57,203
Not on it.

495
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,010
How you can tell that it would be
even more amazing if you were on LSD,

496
00:29:02,070 --> 00:29:06,000
but it already sounds
great. It's like, to me,

497
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:11,300
qualities like it exists in all
states. So like it's just, uh, yeah.

498
00:29:11,430 --> 00:29:14,850
Anyways, that's kind of how I look at
it. It's an interesting perspective.

499
00:29:14,970 --> 00:29:19,740
But you would think definitely the people
see things differently when they're

500
00:29:19,741 --> 00:29:22,900
under, when they're under the influence
of shootings. Absolutely. You,

501
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,120
you don't think there can
be like a tipping point? Oh,
I think you're right. No,

502
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:30,270
I, and to to your point, yes. I do think
that there is music where you're like,

503
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,230
I don't know man.

504
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:35,010
And then you listen to it on mushrooms
or whatever and you're like, oh fuck,

505
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:35,730
this is dope.

506
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:38,490
I remember the first day it does into
to whole lot of love when I was high.

507
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,160
Yeah. And you know that period
there's a, in the middle of the song

508
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:45,760
where it's all just
thimbles and fuck music,

509
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:50,640
it's like Ah, ah, ah, oh yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,

510
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,830
yeah, yes. God, Tim, I love that song.

511
00:29:57,190 --> 00:29:59,080
But when you listen that song high,

512
00:29:59,350 --> 00:30:03,100
you like these guys were wild. Oh yeah.

513
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,140
I mean this is the 1970s right?

514
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:10,120
And these guys made a song
where it started off great.

515
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:15,330
And then for a minute and a half it was
just bones and fuck sounds shake from

516
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:22,510
baby. I want to be your
backdoor man. Hey. Oh,

517
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:26,320
what? I was looking up to
this LSD grateful dead thing.

518
00:30:26,321 --> 00:30:29,530
So their sound engineer who
went under the name bear,

519
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:32,350
which if you know anything about the
grateful dead, they used the bears.

520
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:37,630
He was one of the only scientists when
LSD was out lost. I could still make it.

521
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:42,550
Wow. That was the sound
guy. Oh Jesus Christ.

522
00:30:42,630 --> 00:30:44,500
He made over 5 million doses,

523
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:49,501
but in between 65 and 67 it says they
had their own personal guy and he was the

524
00:30:50,711 --> 00:30:53,260
one that making the sound.
So if that guy still alive,

525
00:30:53,290 --> 00:30:55,250
man put him in jail for the rest of the,

526
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,750
so they were strictly
formatted for listening right
here. Says he died in a car.

527
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,400
Oh Australia.

528
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:02,650
That's probably on the wrong side
of the road because he was on acid.

529
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:07,630
Let's just pause. Don't
get mad. Oh, he's my hero.

530
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:12,100
I just cry in jail. But that's amazing.
So they have their own built in chemist.

531
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:15,160
God, that must've been good
to them. That's so cool.

532
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,950
I love that because that's responsible.

533
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:21,600
I think that that's the responsible
thing to do your own chemist.

534
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:23,710
That way you're not buying any nonsense.

535
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,250
You're getting it from a
guy who's a chemist. Yeah.

536
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,770
This is your person that personally
makes this stuff for you.

537
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:32,110
You know where it comes from? Just Matt.

538
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,900
How many people got
busted at those concerts?

539
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:39,370
The feds or the DEA ever crackdown?
Those concerts when I worked, I uh,

540
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:42,430
you worked, you said you worked
security at like a [inaudible]. Yeah,

541
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:46,090
I did two for a summer and one of the
concerts we did was for Phil as she's the

542
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:47,680
Bass player of the grateful dead.

543
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:51,520
And my job for that day was to walk
around the parking lot and they would just

544
00:31:51,521 --> 00:31:53,560
yell at me and my buddy,
we were 19 years old,

545
00:31:53,590 --> 00:31:57,340
six up six up that thought we were going
to arrest everyone and they would try

546
00:31:57,341 --> 00:32:00,400
to give us the goofballs which have a
bunch of drugs and I'm already to sort of

547
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,890
dose this so that we'd leave
everybody alone. What's a goofball?

548
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:06,250
It's like a popcorn ball.
But from what I was told,

549
00:32:06,251 --> 00:32:11,050
I've never had one bunch of psychedelics
and all sorts of shit in it. Yeah,

550
00:32:11,051 --> 00:32:14,280
just like a thing you would eat.
Oh my Jesus. Never heard of that.

551
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:17,410
That's not what you were eating.
Yeah. You just took a chance,

552
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:22,150
just get too high. The first guy,

553
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,220
the first guy who stumbled on
mushrooms, I was like, what the fuck?

554
00:32:27,221 --> 00:32:30,860
Like mushrooms had to have been like
relearned at some point in time they were

555
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,460
like had to be some people that lived
in an environment where there was no

556
00:32:33,461 --> 00:32:34,240
mushrooms,

557
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,270
where people didn't get them and then
someone found them somewhere but they

558
00:32:37,271 --> 00:32:39,740
didn't have any personal knowledge of
what it was and tried it and ate it and

559
00:32:39,741 --> 00:32:40,460
tripped.

560
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:44,390
That had to have happened. Yeah, I
mean I think, you know, it could,

561
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:47,670
it could also be like, Hey, I'm
foraging for Blah Blah Blah.

562
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,970
And because arguably they would say
mushrooms are around like way, way, way.

563
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,400
Some people, you know, not so
scientific perhaps, I don't know,

564
00:32:55,401 --> 00:32:59,390
or maybe scientific have surmised that
may be consciousness or self awareness

565
00:32:59,391 --> 00:33:04,391
came from thes r species running into
some kind of a psychedelic event which

566
00:33:05,211 --> 00:33:10,211
caused like this hyper self awareness
loop or whatever and then deserves a lot

567
00:33:10,341 --> 00:33:14,000
of attention because people are so
resistant to it. Like really rational,

568
00:33:14,001 --> 00:33:17,240
intelligent people are so
resistant to it. And a,

569
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:21,080
it's almost resistant to that
concept of, well, yes, maybe, uh,

570
00:33:21,081 --> 00:33:25,940
our consciousness was somehow
influenced by psychedelic, but to a man,

571
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:29,420
almost to a man, all the, wow.
I shouldn't say that even.

572
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,220
I'm overstate over generalizing,

573
00:33:31,221 --> 00:33:35,300
but many of those people have not had
psychedelic experiences that dismiss them

574
00:33:35,301 --> 00:33:36,440
so readily. That's true.

575
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:39,920
The people that have had psychedelic
experiences that tend to be skeptical or

576
00:33:39,921 --> 00:33:41,390
more rational, they wouldn't,

577
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:44,090
they're not going to have a definitive
position on it. They're going to go,

578
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:47,760
well, yeah. Right. Something to
consider. It's more measured. Yeah.

579
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,870
The hard liners, you know, there's
a hardliners on both sides.

580
00:33:50,871 --> 00:33:53,750
The hardliners definitely believe that
happened in the hardliners who believed

581
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:57,890
that they don't have any positive
effects whatsoever. Yeah, yeah, totally.

582
00:33:57,891 --> 00:34:01,700
I both almost equally foolish.
Exactly. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, that's a,

583
00:34:01,701 --> 00:34:03,200
that's what we're experiencing right now,

584
00:34:03,230 --> 00:34:04,880
but at least the people
that have experienced it,

585
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:05,840
they know what they're talking about.

586
00:34:05,841 --> 00:34:08,590
The people that haven't experienced it
and don't think it's worth trying. Like,

587
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:11,450
all right. Right. Like
how do you know? Yeah,

588
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,940
I know all these people are
saying that it's amazing.

589
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,610
And then it might be this literally
the source of religion itself.

590
00:34:16,710 --> 00:34:18,530
Some people when they've had it,

591
00:34:18,531 --> 00:34:22,190
they have these complete life changes
where they just rethink things and want to

592
00:34:22,191 --> 00:34:23,460
be kinder to people in Nigeria.

593
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,590
People want to just have more
of a sense of community. Yeah.

594
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:28,190
And then you're just, people dismiss that,

595
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:32,270
but yet they'll take yoga
seriously and meditation seriously,

596
00:34:32,271 --> 00:34:35,240
and they'll go to a therapist all the
time and maybe they'll leave and get on

597
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:37,480
antidepressants, maybe get
on a little bit of Xanax.

598
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,380
I'm having a little anxiety
issues. Reggie Watts,

599
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:44,750
and then they're scared of mushrooms.
It's weird and interesting. Yeah,

600
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:50,000
I mean I get, I get it and I, I dunno.
Oh, I get it. But it's a flaw. Yeah,

601
00:34:50,001 --> 00:34:51,470
it is a fly. I mean it just,

602
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:56,500
I guess if your job is to take in as
many angles as possible to a problem or a

603
00:34:57,171 --> 00:35:02,171
situation or a concern or whatever
way all of the things about all of it,

604
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:06,140
and then come up with a
solution based off of that. But,

605
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,240
and this isn't even
encouraging anyone to do it,

606
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:11,630
but this is just saying to dismiss it
as being not important when you've never

607
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:14,900
done it. It's nonsense. Yeah. That's
all I'm saying. That's what I'm saying.

608
00:35:14,901 --> 00:35:16,670
It's like I'm not saying you
should do it. I don't think.

609
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:20,150
I know a lot of people that birth to grave
have done no psychedelics and they're

610
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:23,900
great and they're wonderful people now
life and they had a wonderful experience.

611
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:28,580
It's not an prerequisite. It's not
a necessary thing. No, I agree with,

612
00:35:28,590 --> 00:35:31,690
I haven't had it. You might
want to shut the fuck up. Yeah.

613
00:35:31,850 --> 00:35:36,530
If you're speaking on the
issue. Yeah. Shut the fuck up.

614
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,370
I was like, well the
research shows like, oh,

615
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:41,190
you're going to let the research
show you what the experience,

616
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:42,330
let me tell you about the research.

617
00:35:42,390 --> 00:35:47,280
Five dried grams in silent darkness as
turns mechanic would describe Oh and

618
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:52,150
prescribed. Yeah. Do that. Oh my gosh.
Do that. And then we'll talk. Yeah.

619
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:55,640
You know, just have one quick
DMT trip and then we'll talk,

620
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,780
cause there's no way that, I
think it would be difficult.

621
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:01,500
I'm sure there's someone who has done
psychedelics and has and still says no.

622
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:02,490
Sure. Yeah. Yeah.

623
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,520
But I would say that most people they
would understand it at least maybe they

624
00:36:08,281 --> 00:36:09,540
didn't have a great time,

625
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:14,720
but they would at least understand
the power of that experience.

626
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:19,770
I think some people have
the burden of intelligence.

627
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,400
And what I mean by that is that they're
really smart and they see a lot of

628
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:27,600
people around them that are silly and
they experienced that so often that they

629
00:36:27,601 --> 00:36:30,240
get weary and they get,
they get, you know,

630
00:36:30,241 --> 00:36:35,220
they sort of get rigid in their belief
that their opinions are correct because

631
00:36:35,221 --> 00:36:37,080
they dismiss most of the
people that are around them.

632
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:41,040
Cause you're on a bunch of dummies if
you're really smart guy or smart girl,

633
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:41,880
it's hard.

634
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:46,880
It's hard to maintain a good perception
of what things are and what things

635
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:48,720
aren't. When you're the
smartest person in the room,

636
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:53,280
you kinda never want to be the smartest
person in the room. Yeah. And also, yes.

637
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:58,340
And also believing that you are in a
way excludes you from including other

638
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:03,670
people who are also smarter than everybody
in the room. Well, it's only men,

639
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,440
maybe not even smarter, which, but I
know you're saying it by an ideology,

640
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,060
their perspective isn't dimmed, right?
Yeah. Yes. They see things clearly,

641
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:14,910
which is I think one of the most
underrated forms of intelligence.

642
00:37:14,911 --> 00:37:18,200
Like there's all this intelligence in
solving mathematical problems and yeah,

643
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:20,780
right. Social Intelligence.
But there's, there's,

644
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:23,280
there's a bunch of different
kinds of intelligence. Absolutely.

645
00:37:23,281 --> 00:37:26,490
Able to see through the bullshit is an
intelligence and some people just don't

646
00:37:26,491 --> 00:37:30,060
have it yet. No, absolutely.
And I think that, you know,

647
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:35,120
at the same time wanting to help someone
see that angle is also an important

648
00:37:35,371 --> 00:37:38,070
thing. So if you're like a, if
you're someone who's like, Oh shit,

649
00:37:38,071 --> 00:37:39,450
like let's say it's this, maybe you're,

650
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:44,200
maybe you're trained in
tactical awareness and you, uh,

651
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:48,440
I just have a different way of
being in a room where you sit. Sure.

652
00:37:48,590 --> 00:37:53,220
Think about all that stuff and the
situation arises where like potentially

653
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:55,930
something dangerous could
happen or whatever. Uh,

654
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:00,420
then being able to explain that idea and
that type of awareness so that someone

655
00:38:00,421 --> 00:38:03,570
can see that is also
possible. Like sharing it.

656
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,030
They may not get it to the
extent that you do, but they,

657
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:10,650
at least you've included it in
their viewpoint. Yeah. Maybe, well,

658
00:38:10,651 --> 00:38:13,500
people that are soldiers, they do have
a weird women. Men are in the room.

659
00:38:13,570 --> 00:38:18,060
It's insane. My friend Andy Stump, he's,
uh, always sneaking up on me. He says,

660
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:21,540
you got no situational awareness.
Yeah, yeah. When a crowd like,

661
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:25,320
what am I supposed to do? Just constantly
on three 60 looking for danger.

662
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:32,160
I mean, yeah, that's what
he's saying, what he's saying.

663
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,830
So, but that's because
he was a seal. You know

664
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,970
how they look at, they look at
things a whole lot different.

665
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,680
So how you stay alive.
Yeah, exactly. Yeah.

666
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,590
I think one of the things that's super
important for people to recognize and it

667
00:38:44,591 --> 00:38:47,920
helps them open their mind up to other
opinions is that even if they failed

668
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:50,350
themselves very highly, um, the,

669
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:54,130
that competitive thing of comparing
your intellect and your reason to other

670
00:38:54,131 --> 00:38:58,210
people, it's a very limiting step.
Instead of worrying about yourself.

671
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:02,950
If you're smart, just be smart. Appreciate
other intelligences. If it just,

672
00:39:02,951 --> 00:39:06,460
just get into talking to them.
This is, that's my thoughts on it.

673
00:39:06,461 --> 00:39:08,200
Instead of being competitive with them,

674
00:39:08,620 --> 00:39:11,890
get in to trying to find out how they
they work cause there's a lot of different

675
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:16,360
humans on this planet and we have this
egocentric position almost everybody does

676
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:16,860
that.

677
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,930
They're at least better at one thing
than other people are or they know some

678
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:22,750
more about one thing that other people
do and it's a weird competitive thing

679
00:39:22,751 --> 00:39:24,240
that people get involved with. It's,

680
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:29,330
it's stupid like you should recognize
that it's awesome to have cool people

681
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,820
around you that are like really smart
and interested in weird shit and

682
00:39:34,030 --> 00:39:38,800
intelligent and inspiring. You
almost envy their, their creativity.

683
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:42,190
Those are massively important
people to have in your life.

684
00:39:42,191 --> 00:39:43,990
But when people get,

685
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:47,920
they feel weird about comparing themselves
to the other person because they come

686
00:39:47,921 --> 00:39:50,530
up [inaudible] insecurity. Exactly.

687
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:54,670
That's where like you see that with a
lot of guys guys puff up chest and start

688
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:58,120
comparing like how much their
houses cost. Like so like,

689
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,480
like literally doing stuff that you're
like, oh we're still doing this.

690
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:06,550
Like to my mind I'm like, Oh
shit, you guys aren't aware of it.

691
00:40:06,850 --> 00:40:09,400
Like a way that I bet anyways.
Yeah. That kind of thing.

692
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:12,550
You guys are doing some 1990
shit here. Yeah. Cause it's like,

693
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,510
I know cause like either
they're like doing an act,

694
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:21,610
which I'm always hoping and I'm always
hoping that that's why there's disbelief

695
00:40:21,611 --> 00:40:25,210
when it really is what it is. And I'm
like, Oh shit. Oh that's best for real.

696
00:40:25,211 --> 00:40:28,210
That's actually the thing. It's
weird, right? Yeah, it is a little,

697
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:29,110
it's a little weird.

698
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:32,200
I mean some people have a lack
of cool people around them too.

699
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:34,510
That's a real problem.
Yes. Stuck in a shoe.

700
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:39,540
It's like a good tomato plant is not going
to grow in the fucking Sonora desert.

701
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:45,010
All right. There's no nutrients there.
It's too bright. It's the sun's too hot.

702
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,210
It's not the right climate. Right? Yes.

703
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:52,650
If you're stuck in some fucking shit
hole city and it's just your whole

704
00:40:54,371 --> 00:40:59,290
neighborhoods fill with dummies
and there's no prospects
and his fucking lead in

705
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,600
the water yet Flint, Michigan water,

706
00:41:01,601 --> 00:41:04,150
you're drinking there still
haven't fixed that. No.

707
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:08,230
People drink bottled water in
Flint, Michigan in 2019. Yep.

708
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,230
Like how, how would do they not have,

709
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,770
how did they let that ever get to that
point? Like at all the things you need.

710
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:18,400
Well, what do we need to stay alive?
Number one water. Okay, let's ignore that.

711
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:21,370
Let's ignore that and work
on the cracks in the streets.

712
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,970
Let's ignore that and have new
uh, traffic lights that, uh,

713
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:27,640
have cameras on them to bust
you so we can get more revenue.

714
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:31,240
Let's make sure we hire Parkington. What
about the water? We can get to that.

715
00:41:31,450 --> 00:41:34,010
We'll get to that low water.
Well, it's, it's my new

716
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:36,200
phrase for, uh, you know,

717
00:41:36,201 --> 00:41:41,201
our situation cause capitalism cause
the current version of capitalism.

718
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,650
I said capitalism,

719
00:41:42,651 --> 00:41:47,380
I don't even know enough
about economics. I mean, I,

720
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,030
it's not really, it's more
just like a philosophical,

721
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:54,410
but you have capitalism with regulation
so that you make sure that there's no

722
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:56,210
pollution. You make sure that you yes,

723
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:00,650
don't correlate with
environmental disasters course
and aren't we also going on

724
00:42:00,651 --> 00:42:04,190
the fucking momentum of decisions
that were made a long time ago.

725
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:05,120
Like a lot of this stuff,

726
00:42:05,121 --> 00:42:10,121
like a lot of these mines that pollute
everywhere up pollute environments

727
00:42:11,061 --> 00:42:11,894
wherever they are.

728
00:42:11,990 --> 00:42:16,010
They kind of made those when environment
where my environmental laws were

729
00:42:16,011 --> 00:42:16,844
different. Right?

730
00:42:17,350 --> 00:42:20,470
Yeah, for sure. I mean
environmentalism was,

731
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:25,550
it wasn't really a thing until
like the mid 19 hundreds I guess.

732
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,271
So like,

733
00:42:26,271 --> 00:42:31,180
like Roosevelt like was like a huge
like environmental groovy dude.

734
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,253
But uh,

735
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:36,520
the idea of preserving swaths of land
and like considering the environment when

736
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:40,810
growing an economy simultaneously
like that just a, that just stopped.

737
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:45,910
Like there's like some national parks
stuff and maybe some things pass with like

738
00:42:46,690 --> 00:42:51,280
ozone, some led stuff, some mercury
stuff, you know, kind of common sense,

739
00:42:51,281 --> 00:42:54,340
really hardcore shit that should
definitely like no brainers.

740
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:58,900
Those have been done. But anything else,
making sure that that balance is there.

741
00:42:58,901 --> 00:43:01,570
As the economy grows,
it just doesn't exist.

742
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,350
It's just the way capitalism is
right now. It's like, it doesn't,

743
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:09,880
that's not considered a value.
There's the more, in fact,

744
00:43:09,881 --> 00:43:13,000
the more scarce it becomes, the
higher end value it is. So it's so,

745
00:43:13,001 --> 00:43:17,200
it's in it's own best interest to continue
to grow and grow and grow until it

746
00:43:17,201 --> 00:43:21,000
can't grow anymore. Jeez man. So,

747
00:43:21,470 --> 00:43:24,910
so that's why decisions like
that are made in my, in my mind,

748
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:29,830
well, decisions that impact the
wilderness and impact in the environment.

749
00:43:29,831 --> 00:43:34,510
Like did you ever see that movie gas
land? No. Great document around fracking.

750
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:39,220
Oh Wow. Really crazy. Um,
what does the director Sam,

751
00:43:39,221 --> 00:43:42,610
Josh Fox Rolan no,

752
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,720
he shares a different guy bro. No, there's
no way. No, it's a different guy. No,

753
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,900
no way. But it's an amazing documentary.
And Josh Fox. I did, I got it.

754
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,340
Josh Fox. Um, it's really good. Really,

755
00:43:54,341 --> 00:43:58,000
really good documentary into is Josh
Fox. He's a guy who made the film.

756
00:43:59,200 --> 00:44:04,200
He and he was inspired by a
personal experience with a,

757
00:44:04,420 --> 00:44:07,180
wasn't it? Do you remember
the actual story, Jamie?

758
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:10,630
It's like personal experience with some
pollutants or something like that in the

759
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:13,060
river, but got anyway, anyway,

760
00:44:13,061 --> 00:44:16,270
made this amazing documentary and watching
people dismiss some of this stuff.

761
00:44:16,420 --> 00:44:19,570
That documentary was
so, so surreal. Oh yeah.

762
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:23,980
They were lighting their tap water on
fire and I don't know if you saw that.

763
00:44:24,190 --> 00:44:26,290
I did see that. Yeah, and that's crazy.

764
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:30,280
People literally were saying you could
do that before the fracking. That's not,

765
00:44:30,281 --> 00:44:34,050
it's not because of the, wow.
People were saying that like, okay,

766
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:35,520
let's assume that's true.

767
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:39,810
Let's just get crazy in as soon
as true fucking water is on fire.

768
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:43,140
That's the last shit that should be on
fire is the shit they used to put out

769
00:44:43,141 --> 00:44:45,960
fire. If your God water's on fire. Yeah.

770
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:49,530
Do you know how much shit has to be in
your water for it to be on fire? Okay,

771
00:44:49,531 --> 00:44:53,580
what's going on here and why are you so
sure that this didn't come from fracking

772
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,390
and that you could always let your water
on fire and now you're telling us you

773
00:44:57,391 --> 00:45:00,600
use it and make videos about this.
Before, before there was a fracking thing.

774
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:03,600
Yes. Showing me a video that
has that. See, are you sure?

775
00:45:04,260 --> 00:45:06,600
Are you really sure that there's,
have you tested the water?

776
00:45:06,601 --> 00:45:07,680
You a fucking scientist,

777
00:45:07,770 --> 00:45:10,560
you sitting over there with a lab coat
and a fucking check sheet making sure

778
00:45:10,561 --> 00:45:13,890
that the toxin levels are exactly the
same before and after fracking. No,

779
00:45:13,891 --> 00:45:17,310
you're not, but why are you so interested?
There's a thing that people do with,

780
00:45:17,430 --> 00:45:21,390
they're like really interested in the
interest of big business and they want to

781
00:45:21,391 --> 00:45:26,391
like they guess and regular people who
don't even have a financial stake in that

782
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:29,910
business will make up excuses for the
business. I know. It's crazy. Yeah.

783
00:45:30,030 --> 00:45:34,230
What is that? It's fear. It's
just fear of losing jobs.

784
00:45:34,410 --> 00:45:37,890
Like people like losing jobs or
losing the thing that keeps their,

785
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:42,780
their bills paid. It's also like
that no nonsense, right wing mindset.

786
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:46,230
There's like a no nonsense right-wing
mindset. All these fucking tree huggers,

787
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:49,560
Goddamn tree huggers. Oh yeah.
Stop us from making a good living.

788
00:45:49,561 --> 00:45:51,510
You want those people to be
poor. You want those people to,

789
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:55,050
you ever see the look on a poor coal
Meyer's face? Yeah. You know what I mean?

790
00:45:55,051 --> 00:45:57,660
There's that thing that
they do no nonsense.

791
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,920
So they want to go with anything that's
like good for the economy but bad for

792
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:05,010
the environment, which is crazy.
It's because you never find it.

793
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,730
You have to factor in the
other the additional costs
and how much can it cost to

794
00:46:08,731 --> 00:46:12,750
fix what you did and if you ever can fix
what you did and if you can't fix what

795
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:16,550
you did to the environment, how much
should that cost? Cause if you can,

796
00:46:16,770 --> 00:46:18,660
if you decide like, Hey,

797
00:46:18,661 --> 00:46:21,510
I'm gonna pull copper out of
this fucking hole in the ground,

798
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,430
but it might kill a million salmon.

799
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:26,790
Like you imagine how much a
million salmon would be worth.

800
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,850
You're going to kill a whole population
of Salmon. How much is that worth?

801
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:33,210
Like give you ruined fishing for all the
people that want to come to this one.

802
00:46:33,211 --> 00:46:36,540
Salmon River. Yeah. You kill a million
fish. Like how much is that worth?

803
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:39,330
That's, that should be
worth $1 billion. Yeah,

804
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:43,200
you should get fined $1 billion if not
more. Yeah. You can't even fix that.

805
00:46:43,201 --> 00:46:45,680
That's what I, that's what I'm
saying. That's, that's what that,

806
00:46:45,681 --> 00:46:48,140
that value that it has no value. These,

807
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:52,830
it's also what's ours like poisoning is
our stuff. I know. That's what I mean.

808
00:46:52,831 --> 00:46:56,610
It's like the earth. This is the
worst because it's like it does not,

809
00:46:56,670 --> 00:47:00,090
it's just a nut. It's not a part of
the equation for growing the economy.

810
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,640
That's like, and I know there's going
to be people listening that are like,

811
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:04,590
just know about this shit hardcore.

812
00:47:04,591 --> 00:47:07,560
I'm just approaching it from like
an over kind of philosophical,

813
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,650
energetic viewpoint. Right, right,
right. We're being hippies. Yeah.

814
00:47:10,651 --> 00:47:12,390
We're being like kind
of, I don't know, Weirdo.

815
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:16,440
Don't even know what the fuck
we're saying. We're stone Zers. So,

816
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:19,350
have you ever seen some of the
image of the mining that they do,

817
00:47:19,351 --> 00:47:24,000
the images of the mining that they do in
northern Canada? Like Northern Alberta?

818
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:28,890
No dude, it's like some hellscape shit.

819
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:33,850
It's crazy cause it like there's a giant
industry of oil mining up there and all

820
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:36,010
kinds of mining in northern Canada.

821
00:47:36,011 --> 00:47:38,680
A lot of folks that go up there and
they do shifts but I mean you're talking

822
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:42,280
unbelievably, brutally, ruthlessly cold.

823
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:47,230
Occasionally people get
jacked by bears. Like really?

824
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:48,723
They live in,

825
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,360
they're living with monsters just outside
the gates and some fucking night's

826
00:47:52,361 --> 00:47:54,880
watch type deal where they're trying
to suck oil out of the ground.

827
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,570
And I mean there's so much of it up
there and it's such a big part of the

828
00:47:58,571 --> 00:48:02,830
economy that you have these giant
like aerial views of these, this,

829
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:07,660
these places that are just
fucks Ville. Uh Wow man.

830
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:08,441
There's one of them.

831
00:48:08,441 --> 00:48:11,230
The one that I saw was much more
horrific cause it involves a lake.

832
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:13,930
So what does it say? Photos,
fame photographer, Alex Mclean's,

833
00:48:13,931 --> 00:48:17,380
new photo of Canada's oil
sands are shocking. Yeah.

834
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:21,130
I mean it's creepy. It's, I mean,
but there was nothing there anyway.

835
00:48:21,131 --> 00:48:22,060
The idea is like, hey,

836
00:48:22,061 --> 00:48:25,630
if it's just flat like that or it's
ugly because we have holes in it,

837
00:48:25,720 --> 00:48:29,080
an oil coming out of the whole who
gives a shit? No one's up here. Right.

838
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:33,250
I get it. I get that mindset. We've got
jobs. Everyone has jobs and it's true.

839
00:48:33,790 --> 00:48:36,130
It's a great job to have.
They make a lot of money.

840
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,250
You meet those dudes that come to a
lot of shows when you do in Canada,

841
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:44,290
they have a name for them. Like look,
real rich oil worker. Yeah. It's royal.

842
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:46,750
It's real, real rich oil worker fellows.

843
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,680
That's the nickname drilling these giants.

844
00:48:50,681 --> 00:48:53,140
That's one that I saw when
see the water all fucked up.

845
00:48:53,170 --> 00:48:57,640
It's all filled with oil and
shit. Oh my lords. Yeah. That's a,

846
00:48:57,641 --> 00:49:02,390
that's a water man. The waters. Fuck. Wow.

847
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:07,660
Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's, it's funny.
All of the, all of the issues that,

848
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:10,660
all of the imbalances are
completely solvable. There's like,

849
00:49:10,690 --> 00:49:13,940
there is no deficits. We
don't have a deficit, um,

850
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:19,440
in what it would take to just make good
decisions that make life really nice for

851
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,370
most people on the planet.

852
00:49:22,330 --> 00:49:26,050
I think a lot of managing has to be done
because there's a lot of stuff that has

853
00:49:26,051 --> 00:49:29,170
unintended consequences
and moving pieces. In fact,

854
00:49:29,171 --> 00:49:31,510
all the moving pieces
around them. Of course.

855
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:34,240
I think that's one of the things that
people are really bad at predicting.

856
00:49:34,480 --> 00:49:37,390
This is why I was saying
like, yeah, you know,

857
00:49:37,900 --> 00:49:40,860
how much is it worth to be able to get
copper out of a hole in the ground?

858
00:49:40,870 --> 00:49:43,810
It's going to poison a river and kill a
bunch of fish. How much is that worth?

859
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,753
Yeah. Yeah.

860
00:49:44,770 --> 00:49:49,770
It's like these people have this sense
that like you make one decision and it

861
00:49:51,701 --> 00:49:53,050
only affects that thing,

862
00:49:53,110 --> 00:49:56,590
but it doesn't affects a lot of
things or connected to that thing.

863
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:59,950
It also affects the way people
feel. If you do something Shitty,

864
00:49:59,951 --> 00:50:03,190
like kill a million fish, people
get bummed out. Like that's real.

865
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:05,770
It affects the way they interact
with other people. Yeah. You know,

866
00:50:05,771 --> 00:50:08,570
when you read something really fucked up
on the news, you're like, God damn it.

867
00:50:09,970 --> 00:50:11,230
Until you leave your house like that,

868
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:14,650
you leave your house like God damn it
to people that have that God damn it.

869
00:50:14,710 --> 00:50:18,250
And then they, they get upset at each
other for something that wouldn't before.

870
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:19,000
Yeah.

871
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:20,860
Cause they're just thinking there's a
bunch of pedophiles out there and a bunch

872
00:50:20,861 --> 00:50:24,520
of monsters and a bunch of murderers and
a bunch of people pouring oil into the

873
00:50:24,521 --> 00:50:27,740
ocean. Yeah. No, it's a bummer. Changes

874
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,570
when people do fucked up things. It
changes how we feel about people. 100%.

875
00:50:32,810 --> 00:50:37,610
And I dunno, I get, uh, I dunno, it's,

876
00:50:37,611 --> 00:50:39,860
I try to get that to get overwhelmed
by those things. But, you know,

877
00:50:39,861 --> 00:50:41,690
it's like really the best thing,

878
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:46,340
at least in my life that I try to do is
make friends with as many technologists

879
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:49,710
and designers and people of that ilk, um,

880
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,420
to be able to at least be a part of
the conversation. Cause they're at the,

881
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:55,490
they're like that the head
of the wave, like there's,

882
00:50:55,491 --> 00:50:58,340
there's nothing really in front of them.
They're just on that, like, you know,

883
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:59,870
whatever, bleeding edge or whatever.

884
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:04,040
But it's just like that the place where
chaos is being ordered and like the

885
00:51:04,041 --> 00:51:06,950
decisions are being made, which
waves are, we're going to do that.

886
00:51:06,980 --> 00:51:10,550
And if you can have good conversations
with people like that, you can kind of,

887
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:15,910
I believe you can kind of help steer
things at least technologically to uh,

888
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,910
allocate funds to different
portions of technology that are,

889
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:23,420
it should be more prioritized
than that than they are. Like,

890
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:28,880
like just a figuring out things
like accumulating water, um, out of,

891
00:51:28,940 --> 00:51:33,350
out of the air, like more of that should
be used or reducing carbon emissions.

892
00:51:33,351 --> 00:51:36,750
All the various things you can
do for that. Um, you know, uh,

893
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:41,660
try to close that gap between the ultra
ultra, ultra, ultra rich and the poor.

894
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,090
It's like everyone can still
be super happy if everyone,

895
00:51:44,350 --> 00:51:49,040
if everyone had access to be able to
level up to a point that's ridiculous.

896
00:51:49,041 --> 00:51:52,180
That can still happen, but not at the
levels that they are, but he's not in.

897
00:51:52,181 --> 00:51:55,790
Interesting that that instinct that
people have to resist that idea that poor

898
00:51:55,791 --> 00:51:57,650
people shouldn't be somehow or another,

899
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,460
we should engineer a way to have less
poor people that we should consider it as

900
00:52:01,461 --> 00:52:05,030
a problem, but people get really resistant
to that. Right? You start thinking,

901
00:52:05,031 --> 00:52:06,620
oh no, no. What do you want to do?

902
00:52:06,620 --> 00:52:09,830
You want to take my fucking money and
give it to jumble? I know I was. No,

903
00:52:10,530 --> 00:52:14,960
I dragged my money buckets. Socialist
Jug in my mind. Yeah. It's like, well,

904
00:52:14,961 --> 00:52:15,830
he didn't work for it,

905
00:52:15,831 --> 00:52:18,290
so he didn't find the right way
to work inside of the system,

906
00:52:18,291 --> 00:52:21,380
so there's a failure. I'm sorry,
I don't think they're right.

907
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:26,120
I don't think they're wrong about the
whole concept of not giving people money

908
00:52:26,121 --> 00:52:28,700
doesn't solve a problem. No,
he doesn't solve a problem.

909
00:52:28,701 --> 00:52:33,430
But recognizing that it's a problem
and engineering it so that we have a a

910
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:38,150
better society where more people are
doing good. That's great for everybody.

911
00:52:38,151 --> 00:52:39,560
Totally. It's great for the economy.

912
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:42,590
It's a weird caste system thing
where people who are really poor,

913
00:52:42,591 --> 00:52:45,380
you almost want them to stay really
poor. Yeah. You don't want to,

914
00:52:45,550 --> 00:52:47,900
I don't get it. It's a weird
devil get it. I'm like,

915
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:52,400
cause I feel uncomfortable if I'm in a
room of people and I feel like someone's

916
00:52:52,401 --> 00:52:56,180
being kind of just
looked over consistently.

917
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:59,600
That's the person I'm going to engage
with the most. You're a great guy.

918
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:01,850
That's awesome. But it's the, you are the,

919
00:53:01,970 --> 00:53:03,200
I mean that's a good way of looking at it.

920
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,420
I mean cause it's it and then also
it's just like, well thanks. But it's,

921
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:09,170
but it's also just a practical
thing, right? I mean, I mean,

922
00:53:09,171 --> 00:53:10,340
if you're sensitive to that as that,

923
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:13,940
if that's part of your value
system is to feel like, you know,

924
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:16,490
not everybody should be doing
this or this or that or that,

925
00:53:16,491 --> 00:53:19,400
but everybody is entitled to be
recognized and respected for that.

926
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:22,850
And so that's kind of a
cool place to operate from.

927
00:53:22,851 --> 00:53:26,070
But I guess what I'm relating
to economically, yeah.

928
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,600
If more people are doing well, then you,

929
00:53:27,630 --> 00:53:31,560
then you have a very productive society.
Right? So there are no drags on it.

930
00:53:31,561 --> 00:53:34,770
Like there's a lot dragging
this, this economy. Sure.

931
00:53:35,010 --> 00:53:39,520
It's just like crime and poverty
is getting gum drug addicts. Yeah.

932
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,610
And a lot of drug addicts
come from abuse. Yeah.

933
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:44,920
A lot of abuse comes from
poverty. There's a lot,

934
00:53:44,921 --> 00:53:48,070
a lot of those factors that play in
there that make us a weaker country.

935
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:50,230
That's how I just you like
if you really patriotic,

936
00:53:50,530 --> 00:53:53,830
he'd want to fix all of the
impoverished neighborhoods. But yes,

937
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:57,730
if we're a team, the team is stronger
when there's less losers, right.

938
00:53:57,731 --> 00:53:59,680
When people are not losing in life. Well,

939
00:53:59,681 --> 00:54:02,620
people are losing because they're stuck
in a spot where they can almost never

940
00:54:02,621 --> 00:54:03,041
get out.

941
00:54:03,041 --> 00:54:06,400
And by the time they're 18 they've already
been in jail twice and they're kind

942
00:54:06,401 --> 00:54:09,970
of programmed by their environment to be
hostile because the world around you is

943
00:54:09,971 --> 00:54:12,970
harsh and nasty and doesn't
give a fuck about you,

944
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:15,250
but you have to adapt to survive. I mean,

945
00:54:15,251 --> 00:54:17,110
that's how people are able
to kill people in war.

946
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,570
People have a remarkable ability to adapt,

947
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:23,050
but the idea that they should be able
to figure that out when you didn't have,

948
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:28,000
that's crazy. It's crazy.
It's such a bad hand.

949
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:32,350
You have the worst hand of cards
ever. Yeah, and they're us.

950
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:35,670
We're all on a team. Like if you really
say you're American, I'm American man.

951
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:40,150
I'll fucking support this country. This
country is everybody, man. Everybody,

952
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:43,900
everybody. I forget it. Let's leave.
Let's see. Just for convenience sake,

953
00:54:43,901 --> 00:54:47,890
let's leave out illegals and only say
the poor people that were born here that

954
00:54:47,891 --> 00:54:51,250
are registered United States
citizens. We got work to do. Oh yeah,

955
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:52,570
we got work to do.

956
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:57,670
It's, it's, it's just insane to me. I
mean, I see it and I'm like, ah fuck man,

957
00:54:57,671 --> 00:55:01,660
that shouldn't be a thing.
But, but I see why, you know,

958
00:55:01,661 --> 00:55:04,960
it's like you're talking about there's
this weird biological human instinct to

959
00:55:04,990 --> 00:55:09,600
create a tiered system of society because
that's the way you control society.

960
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:13,030
It's like creating a transmission.
Looks like a social transmission.

961
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,560
And like that is, we were sitting,
we were looking on it. Yeah.

962
00:55:17,561 --> 00:55:19,210
Cause it's like that
way you can manipulate,

963
00:55:19,510 --> 00:55:21,280
you can like switch
gears and you can play,

964
00:55:21,460 --> 00:55:25,270
you can play them off of one
another. And, and you know,

965
00:55:25,271 --> 00:55:29,350
and I think like some conspiracy
thinking shit just went deep.

966
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:34,360
I'm like, what is he writing
this writer? Is it convenient?

967
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:37,840
Is it just convenient that people
want to keep it's crabs in a bucket?

968
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,580
You know that expression. Yeah.

969
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,710
Crabs never get out of the bucket
because the other crabs grab them,

970
00:55:41,711 --> 00:55:44,770
drag them down. Yeah. It's
true. It's, I mean it's, yeah,

971
00:55:44,771 --> 00:55:47,290
it's predicting human behavior,
you know, to a certain extent.

972
00:55:47,291 --> 00:55:51,580
And a lot of the leftover monkey
stuff. Yeah. Man. It's the,

973
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:55,780
it's not, it's just, it's still here.
It's still here and it's fucking shit up.

974
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:59,520
That's what we also needed it just
a hundred years ago. Totally. Yeah.

975
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:01,390
People were doing duals when they were,

976
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:04,660
the president was doing duels just
a couple hundred years ago. Yeah,

977
00:56:04,661 --> 00:56:09,070
you're right. This is so recent.
Yeah. I mean Barrick shit man.

978
00:56:09,100 --> 00:56:12,400
Shooting each other with little
mini muskets in the fucking street,

979
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:15,820
the front of everybody. And you
were the president. Is that true?

980
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:18,070
Was there a president that had
gotten a duel? That is true. Right?

981
00:56:18,130 --> 00:56:19,070
I think you're right.

982
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,340
That up as Andrew Jackson got
in like over a hundred goals.

983
00:56:21,341 --> 00:56:24,100
I think that like what
duals, where it like that

984
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:24,741
dual type to,

985
00:56:24,741 --> 00:56:27,190
it was really just like a challenge to
see you if you would show up really.

986
00:56:27,191 --> 00:56:30,630
And then like, oh, it was like
just a, it wasn't really a goal.

987
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,710
It's like someone died at
every shoot. Anybody he did.

988
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:34,990
But I think like one person. Oh Oh.

989
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,990
Cause usually they have a crazy story
about it. They don't aim at each other.

990
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:41,800
That's why. That's why I
heard that there's like you
kind of like aim near them.

991
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,660
Something like that. Yeah.

992
00:56:43,661 --> 00:56:47,860
And that was a way to concede in one
day he got shot I think in the chest,

993
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:50,260
but he was such a bad ass. He, he stayed,

994
00:56:50,261 --> 00:56:54,640
he like put his hand over it and held
it and s and s cause his gun jammed when

995
00:56:54,641 --> 00:56:55,421
he was supposed to fire.

996
00:56:55,421 --> 00:56:58,510
So the other guy got him and then he
fixed his gun and shot the guy in the head

997
00:56:58,511 --> 00:57:00,890
and that guy ended up, I'm pretty
sure that's how that stuff too,

998
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:03,400
the way I went about like the
one guy who killed town, she,

999
00:57:04,290 --> 00:57:08,200
you have a real motivation to kill a
guy when shoots in the chest that should

1000
00:57:08,740 --> 00:57:09,490
eliminate threat.

1001
00:57:09,490 --> 00:57:12,900
Now this becomes real and the guy just
has to stand there and can't even run

1002
00:57:12,901 --> 00:57:16,420
away. So goofy is that you have to
stand there and let a dude shoot you.

1003
00:57:16,480 --> 00:57:20,590
That's part of the deal, right?
I don't turn around and go,

1004
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:25,780
you can't be like, I went, bitch, I'm
out of here. You have to kind of stand.

1005
00:57:25,781 --> 00:57:29,230
There is a guy named Charles
Dickinson, not the writer, but a horse,

1006
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:31,420
a rival horse breeder,

1007
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:34,540
and here's the account of their drop.

1008
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:36,830
That was on May 30th,

1009
00:57:36,830 --> 00:57:40,880
1806 Jackson and Dickinson
met at Harrison's mills
on the Red River in Logan,

1010
00:57:40,881 --> 00:57:44,880
Kentucky at the first signal. From
there seconds, Dickinson fired.

1011
00:57:44,881 --> 00:57:48,800
Jackson received Dickinson's first
bullet in the chest next to his heart.

1012
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,430
Jackson put his hand over the wound to
staunch the flow of blood and stayed

1013
00:57:52,431 --> 00:57:54,350
standing long enough to fire his gun.

1014
00:57:54,590 --> 00:57:58,820
Dickinson seconds claimed that Jackson's
first shot misfired which would have

1015
00:57:58,821 --> 00:58:02,330
meant that the wool was over,
but in a breach of etiquette,

1016
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:07,310
Jackson re cocked the gun and shot
again this time killing his opponent.

1017
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:08,960
Although Jackson recovered,

1018
00:58:09,110 --> 00:58:13,520
he suffered chronic pain from the wound
for the remainder of his life. Ah, Dang.

1019
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:18,990
Jackson was not prosecuted for murder
and that dual had very little effect on a

1020
00:58:18,991 --> 00:58:23,991
successful campaign for the presidency
in 1829 many American men in the early 18

1021
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:27,650
hundreds particularly in the south, viewed
dueling as a time honored tradition.

1022
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:32,610
Wow. That was just a couple of years
ago. We were barbarians and like, well,

1023
00:58:32,611 --> 00:58:35,610
sometimes you just got to do it.
That is a time honored tradition.

1024
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:36,600
200 years ago,

1025
00:58:36,601 --> 00:58:40,380
people were so goddamn crazy that you
could shoot someone in the fucking face in

1026
00:58:40,381 --> 00:58:44,190
a dual a street fight and then run for
president and win. Yeah. That's consent.

1027
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:48,000
Consensual. I mean, there are versions
of that now. That's amazing. But yeah,

1028
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:52,200
his divorce rate raise more of a
scandal than him killing that guy.

1029
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:59,160
Wow. How is that possible? Wow. I mean
again, priorities, different societies.

1030
00:58:59,310 --> 00:59:00,870
Yeah. What was gossip like back then?

1031
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:05,040
Like gossip magazines and have like a
like hand printed newspaper with gossip at

1032
00:59:05,041 --> 00:59:07,820
that they would hand
out. Yeah. What would it,

1033
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:11,910
why would his divorce become a big deal
out there? The printing press back then,

1034
00:59:11,911 --> 00:59:15,660
right? Oh yeah, for sure. Yeah.
The United States. Got It.

1035
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:19,950
There's an 1856 now. Um, like
everyone had to buy into it.

1036
00:59:19,980 --> 00:59:23,240
People are so that just a
couple hundred years ago

1037
00:59:23,360 --> 00:59:24,620
there were so goofy. I mean,

1038
00:59:24,710 --> 00:59:29,120
that's one of the best examples of like
a difference in a shift in culture.

1039
00:59:29,380 --> 00:59:30,710
I imagine hearing that today.

1040
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:35,090
Imagine hearing that we had slid so far
down that Trump and Putin were engaging

1041
00:59:35,091 --> 00:59:39,070
in a duel and they were going to go
back to back and trauma cheated and shot

1042
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:43,150
them. And we were, yeah, I wonder who
would cheat who? Well, if that happened,

1043
00:59:43,151 --> 00:59:44,510
if Trump Trump took a bullet,

1044
00:59:44,690 --> 00:59:47,330
but his gun misfired and then he
re cocked it and fire again. Oh,

1045
00:59:47,331 --> 00:59:49,700
that would be a Trump thing. That's
what, but that's what he did.

1046
00:59:49,970 --> 00:59:54,680
That's what Jackson did. Oh my goodness.
Jackson. Yeah. Yeah, though. Okay.

1047
00:59:54,681 --> 00:59:57,260
So he married Rachel Jackson, who,

1048
00:59:57,440 --> 01:00:00,140
this is part of the dual because a,

1049
01:00:00,170 --> 01:00:04,790
the guy who killed Dickinson had publicly
called her a big amiss because she

1050
01:00:04,791 --> 01:00:07,220
married Jackson, not knowing
her first husband had fought,

1051
01:00:07,221 --> 01:00:09,020
not finalized the divorce
or something like that.

1052
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,130
So that was a bigger scandal that he was
married to some already married woman.

1053
01:00:13,370 --> 01:00:16,160
Oh. Like that got outed. So he's
like, fuck you, I'm gonna kill you.

1054
01:00:16,460 --> 01:00:18,830
Oh my goodness. Wow.

1055
01:00:18,860 --> 01:00:23,860
So he challenged to him to a duel because
Jackson challenged him to do that.

1056
01:00:24,921 --> 01:00:28,670
And I'll read N***a horse,
Betty said, oh my God. Oh,

1057
01:00:28,980 --> 01:00:32,390
you can cheat on horse bedding.
That's, those are two big things, man.

1058
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:34,940
Don't say I'm a man's wife, is a big mist.

1059
01:00:35,990 --> 01:00:39,710
Then you don't say that's what they're
shooting people over fucking horse bets

1060
01:00:39,711 --> 01:00:41,090
and Shit. Yeah.

1061
01:00:41,091 --> 01:00:45,560
Those were barbarian people and this
our ancestors just 200 years ago.

1062
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,870
This is like very civil, civil, barbarian,

1063
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:52,110
civil Barbera whereby
bearings with their rules.

1064
01:00:52,470 --> 01:00:55,800
Well that's one of the more hilarious
stories of the Revolutionary War, right?

1065
01:00:56,040 --> 01:00:58,950
The way the British soldiers
dressed was so silly.

1066
01:00:59,190 --> 01:01:02,430
They literally put a target
on their fucking chest.

1067
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:07,290
They made their vitals lighter. It
made like if you, you shoot guns,

1068
01:01:07,291 --> 01:01:10,590
you know what it's like. You can
see if you could see things clearly,

1069
01:01:10,591 --> 01:01:13,650
it makes a much more viable
target. Yes. Period. Yeah.

1070
01:01:13,710 --> 01:01:16,920
And you're talking about
people that didn't have any
sights on their guns aren't

1071
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:19,260
right. In terms of optics,

1072
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:23,220
obviously they had like little
machine sites, little metal sites,

1073
01:01:23,520 --> 01:01:25,500
but the way these guys walk towards them,

1074
01:01:25,501 --> 01:01:29,220
especially the ones with the xs on
the chest, that shit is so ridiculous.

1075
01:01:29,221 --> 01:01:32,400
They're walking bulls. Odds
is the dumbest thing. Wow.

1076
01:01:32,550 --> 01:01:36,570
And the only thing that makes sense to
me is that they had just had it easy for

1077
01:01:36,571 --> 01:01:40,890
too long. Not, not even easy, but they
were in control for too long. They got,

1078
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:41,760
they got a little silly.

1079
01:01:42,410 --> 01:01:45,360
You forgot how barbaric people can
be really thinking about fashion.

1080
01:01:46,530 --> 01:01:48,090
Well that's the weirdest fashion, right?

1081
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:51,090
Like that was what they used for wartime.

1082
01:01:51,690 --> 01:01:55,320
Like this is really what the
professionals, you know what I mean?

1083
01:01:55,321 --> 01:01:57,990
Like soldiers looked a little
bit more like, hey guys,

1084
01:01:57,991 --> 01:01:59,750
we're a professional soldiers and we're,

1085
01:02:00,150 --> 01:02:03,990
it doesn't look like good clothes for
fucking people up in. No, it looks cool.

1086
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:09,370
Yeah. But what a weird outfit.
Right? That militarily weird.

1087
01:02:09,410 --> 01:02:11,610
How much hand to hand combat were
they doing? Cause they didn't,

1088
01:02:11,611 --> 01:02:14,090
there wasn't a lot of swords. It's
was just jerking each other off.

1089
01:02:14,150 --> 01:02:14,983
That's all they did.

1090
01:02:16,490 --> 01:02:20,300
They just got in the woods and if they
knew any Jujitsu, they call it, be great.

1091
01:02:20,580 --> 01:02:23,990
Someone could choke everyone out
with that, with those outfits. Yeah.

1092
01:02:24,350 --> 01:02:29,130
All that clothing doesn't move good
too. I mean, I'm just guessing,

1093
01:02:29,131 --> 01:02:32,970
but I think they're fucking cloth. It
was probably dog shit back then. Yeah,

1094
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:36,060
probably real stiff, hard to move
around and it's just a weird outfit.

1095
01:02:36,060 --> 01:02:38,000
It's not like something that you would,

1096
01:02:38,010 --> 01:02:40,350
if you had to run through
the woods and fire a gun,

1097
01:02:40,410 --> 01:02:43,320
you want to wear it with like soldiers
wear today and you want to be able to

1098
01:02:43,321 --> 01:02:46,830
blend in, but it's just so strange that
that wasn't even a concern back then.

1099
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,850
They had knee high
leggings or weird shoes.

1100
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,800
Wars were more like chess, like every,

1101
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:55,650
like the soldiers and all
the different rank and file.

1102
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:59,940
They're all like pieces on a chess board,
so it's all about strategy, you know?

1103
01:02:59,941 --> 01:03:02,950
It's like, we'll line our men up this
way and we'll do this and blah, blah,

1104
01:03:02,951 --> 01:03:06,090
blah, blah. That's it. It's more like
that's how battles are being organized.

1105
01:03:06,091 --> 01:03:10,050
It's like chess games. You want to know
how God before he got gorilla, right,

1106
01:03:10,051 --> 01:03:13,380
right, right. Well, it was gorilla
at first and then it became true.

1107
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:17,870
Mongolia, daisy, we're lighting
people on fire and ms catapults. Yeah,

1108
01:03:17,950 --> 01:03:21,960
by any means necessary war.
Those shoes did not have tread.

1109
01:03:21,990 --> 01:03:25,590
They'd had invented tread on shoes
yet. That's why a few people are, yes.

1110
01:03:25,830 --> 01:03:30,060
They had leather shoes.
So the soles were leather.

1111
01:03:30,150 --> 01:03:32,970
So they were scuffed up,
but there was no tread.

1112
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:36,210
I bet you some soldiers like figured
out how they wrapped, you know,

1113
01:03:36,211 --> 01:03:39,320
like sunken leather and wrapped
layers. You know, I'm around the foot.

1114
01:03:39,410 --> 01:03:40,990
So to create traction. Yeah.

1115
01:03:42,030 --> 01:03:45,720
Cause if you think like you take
like a trail running shoe and a,

1116
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:50,040
if you ever wear like a, like a Solomon
speed cross trailing, she loves us.

1117
01:03:50,070 --> 01:03:52,170
Yeah. They're great. They have
these big divots in the bottom.

1118
01:03:52,171 --> 01:03:54,390
You can really dig into the
dirt with those things. Yeah.

1119
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:59,430
If you had to compare yourself running
up a hill in cowboy boots that have that

1120
01:03:59,431 --> 01:04:01,530
flat leather smooth,

1121
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:05,640
slippery surface versus you would
fall on your fucking face. Yeah.

1122
01:04:05,670 --> 01:04:07,960
There's no way you'd have any
confidence. Yeah, I have that.

1123
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:10,800
Nothing but those Solomons
you just dig in and go,

1124
01:04:10,801 --> 01:04:13,710
it gives you a totally false
perception of re like I have, um,

1125
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:18,100
those Vibram five finger running
shoes. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. And uh,

1126
01:04:18,101 --> 01:04:21,150
I run in the trail ones, which have
like a good amount of treading it.

1127
01:04:21,330 --> 01:04:25,620
But one day I tried to run in the
ones that aren't trail ones, they're,

1128
01:04:25,830 --> 01:04:27,840
they're basically just for
the gym and it's super thin.

1129
01:04:28,110 --> 01:04:31,260
There was no tread at all. I
was falling on my fucking face.

1130
01:04:31,261 --> 01:04:35,280
My legs would just go, whoops, just kick
out going up hills. Your legs just go.

1131
01:04:35,290 --> 01:04:39,090
Woopsies no tread at
all. It's just slippery.

1132
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:42,360
I can imagine that you need, like
if you're running up a stiff hill,

1133
01:04:42,361 --> 01:04:44,230
you need defense. You know you
need something that's going to

1134
01:04:46,170 --> 01:04:49,500
even have that bad gun. They
just had leather defined tread.

1135
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:54,240
I sort of found a shoe, I think it
says it was from the revolutionary war,

1136
01:04:54,241 --> 01:04:57,430
but it doesn't show the trend. It's
just a fucking old piece of leather.

1137
01:04:57,590 --> 01:05:01,860
Something don't tread on me there.
That was their shoes back then.

1138
01:05:01,890 --> 01:05:06,180
Bullshit ass shoes. But the bottom was
just fucking leather. I mean when did,

1139
01:05:06,181 --> 01:05:08,700
when they figured out like
Vibram leather soles, you know,

1140
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:13,730
I mean rubber soles with figured out
how to get those like fic d Troggs slave

1141
01:05:14,470 --> 01:05:18,690
shoes some of our time. So yeah,
those are, those are clogs. Wow.

1142
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,090
Basically they just borrowed
that touch technology. Yeah.

1143
01:05:22,510 --> 01:05:27,220
Wouldn't choose fuck that. Look
at those things. Wow. Dude,

1144
01:05:27,221 --> 01:05:28,360
this is a couple of hundred years ago.

1145
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:33,540
People would just take animal skin off
and chop it up and put it on their body.

1146
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:37,510
I love it. That's how people stayed alive,

1147
01:05:37,970 --> 01:05:40,810
like how they figured
out wood and leather.

1148
01:05:41,020 --> 01:05:44,800
I wonder who the first fucking monkey
was to figure out how to skin an animal

1149
01:05:44,890 --> 01:05:47,230
and where it's skin. You know?

1150
01:05:47,231 --> 01:05:52,231
It has to be like in the monkey days
right now it feels like it'd be a couple

1151
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:57,440
generations away from the monkey. Maybe
it's don't you think maybe it was one,

1152
01:05:57,790 --> 01:06:01,540
I just can't imagine a monkey doing one
mean motherfucking chimp and they were

1153
01:06:01,660 --> 01:06:03,970
going north and there's one
dude who always annoyed him,

1154
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:07,900
so he kills him with a rock and then uses
the rock to take his fucking skin off

1155
01:06:07,901 --> 01:06:09,580
and wears it to freak everybody else out.

1156
01:06:09,970 --> 01:06:13,480
But then he realizes it makes him warm.
You didn't go a little further north,

1157
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:18,370
Huh? It's like a movie. Okay. I like
it. A movie. Can you see that scene?

1158
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:21,490
I can see that, that, that, that's like,

1159
01:06:21,491 --> 01:06:23,440
that's what the entire movie leads up to.

1160
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:28,180
And the first monkey figured out he
could kill an animal with like a tool,

1161
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:32,050
like the, for like Australia pithy
kiss or one of those, Oh yeah.

1162
01:06:32,110 --> 01:06:33,100
Primitive humans.

1163
01:06:33,250 --> 01:06:38,250
When the first one was that
stabbed something like a
stab at or rat or a rabbit

1164
01:06:38,351 --> 01:06:43,120
with a stick and went, Holy Shit.
Right. I can just use this tool.

1165
01:06:43,480 --> 01:06:45,910
What other tools? How are you
going to start eating? Yeah,

1166
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:48,550
I'm going to eat good. Cause
if you didn't have a weapon,

1167
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:52,540
how hard is it for our person to
kill something with your hands?

1168
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:56,290
What are you even gonna get?
What are you going to catch?

1169
01:06:56,980 --> 01:07:00,910
What the fuck can you catch with your
hands? Well, you can't catch a squirrel.

1170
01:07:00,940 --> 01:07:04,210
You'd be just your hands. No tools.
You'd be hunting and gathering. Mostly.

1171
01:07:04,630 --> 01:07:06,400
I mean, I mean gathering,
I would say, yeah,

1172
01:07:06,401 --> 01:07:08,620
you beat and Shit that you
found on the ground. Yeah.

1173
01:07:08,890 --> 01:07:10,600
That's primarily what you would eat.

1174
01:07:10,601 --> 01:07:13,840
And then once in a while you'd get
something, an animal, but, but yeah,

1175
01:07:13,841 --> 01:07:15,490
but then, yeah, you're right. Uh,

1176
01:07:15,610 --> 01:07:19,690
they obviously had to figure out
different ways of getting animals. Well,

1177
01:07:19,691 --> 01:07:24,370
it's one of the shifts that they think
took place to allow the human brain size

1178
01:07:24,371 --> 01:07:26,560
to double over a period
of 2 million years.

1179
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:30,040
Don't really human brain
size apparently. Um,

1180
01:07:30,041 --> 01:07:33,310
I was listening to a Terence Mckenna
lecture on this once and he was talking

1181
01:07:33,311 --> 01:07:37,240
about all the human brain size doubled
over the period of 2 million years is one

1182
01:07:37,241 --> 01:07:39,670
of the biggest mysteries
in the fossil record.

1183
01:07:39,940 --> 01:07:44,050
And his idea was that they discovered
mushrooms and that the chimps over this

1184
01:07:44,051 --> 01:07:46,090
period of time where the monkey people,

1185
01:07:46,091 --> 01:07:50,410
whatever the fuck they
were ancient hominids had
discovered mushrooms after the

1186
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:53,880
climate had shifted and he
backs it up. He did back it up,

1187
01:07:54,080 --> 01:07:56,500
believes he's dead now.
He backed it up with, um,

1188
01:07:56,710 --> 01:08:00,640
some climate data that
we know from, you know,

1189
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:02,290
core samples and stuff like that.

1190
01:08:02,770 --> 01:08:07,590
He thinks that they experienced climate
change where the rain forest had receded

1191
01:08:07,600 --> 01:08:12,600
in the grasslands and that this gave
birth to the rise of undulates like cows

1192
01:08:13,211 --> 01:08:15,500
and you know, deer and
things like that. Yeah.

1193
01:08:15,530 --> 01:08:19,190
And they would shit these
mushrooms grow on their a shit.

1194
01:08:19,640 --> 01:08:24,260
And then they've observed a lot of
these monkeys in the wild picking up cow

1195
01:08:24,261 --> 01:08:27,950
patties and looking for grubs and
beetles underneath it. Oh, I see.

1196
01:08:27,951 --> 01:08:30,740
I think they might've experimented
with the mushrooms and that if they

1197
01:08:30,741 --> 01:08:32,540
experimented with siliciden mushrooms,

1198
01:08:33,020 --> 01:08:35,900
a lot of things could take place once
they realized that it was not just a

1199
01:08:35,901 --> 01:08:39,770
viable food source, but also provided
them with a bunch of different benefits.

1200
01:08:39,771 --> 01:08:43,580
One being their vision and
increased visual acuity note,

1201
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:45,700
especially in low doses. Yeah.

1202
01:08:46,340 --> 01:08:49,940
So I'm going to make them see things
better to make some hornier make some more

1203
01:08:49,941 --> 01:08:54,310
communal and it makes them more creative
and all those things possibly could

1204
01:08:54,311 --> 01:08:57,980
have given birth to the, to, to
language and to a lot of other things.

1205
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:02,120
They also think it's possible that that
creativity could have enabled them to

1206
01:09:02,121 --> 01:09:02,954
start hunting,

1207
01:09:03,330 --> 01:09:08,090
that they started using tools and you and
thinking and trying to figure out ways

1208
01:09:08,091 --> 01:09:11,780
around stuff and trying to, you know,
try to figure out how to make a,

1209
01:09:11,781 --> 01:09:13,940
an effective weapon to kill
something in the distance.

1210
01:09:13,941 --> 01:09:16,040
Like the more they're thinking
and becoming creative,

1211
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,900
the more that that stuff's
enhancing them. And this,

1212
01:09:18,920 --> 01:09:23,180
this period of 2 million years is like
a pretty profound jump for the human

1213
01:09:23,181 --> 01:09:23,810
brain size.

1214
01:09:23,810 --> 01:09:27,330
They think some of that also came to
do with our desire to kill things with,

1215
01:09:27,390 --> 01:09:30,920
with weapons, but once we
started hunting and eating meat,

1216
01:09:30,950 --> 01:09:33,920
we got way more protein,
more bioavailable protein,

1217
01:09:33,921 --> 01:09:37,070
or it was healthier for the
animal, for the human animal.

1218
01:09:37,190 --> 01:09:41,180
And then we also started to try to figure
out other better ways to kill these

1219
01:09:41,181 --> 01:09:44,720
animals, which made us even more
creative and competitive. Yeah. Yeah.

1220
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:48,470
They think that all these, these, all
these factors might've taken place.

1221
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:50,210
That turned us into a person

1222
01:09:51,100 --> 01:09:54,100
that's pretty amazing. 2 million years.
Yeah. It's just like a deviation. Well,

1223
01:09:54,101 --> 01:09:58,270
you know, it's even crazier. 65
million years ago. We were like a mole.

1224
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:03,730
Oh yeah. People were like a little
shrew or ancest. That's right.

1225
01:10:03,731 --> 01:10:06,170
I remember that. What's the
name of that thing? Oh no man.

1226
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:08,920
I think it's North
Korea. Fifth [inaudible]

1227
01:10:10,830 --> 01:10:15,510
North Gustav versus, I think you're
right. A Pisco for Christmas district.

1228
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:21,880
It was like a weird little mole screw
specific with this. That's what it is.

1229
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:25,420
Yeah. It's the little tiny rodent. Yeah.

1230
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:29,950
Cause I did a podcast or now I
toured with, um, what is it Jamie?

1231
01:10:30,940 --> 01:10:32,780
Oh, there it is. I don't know

1232
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:36,240
the earliest of, what does
that word you thery in you?

1233
01:10:36,900 --> 01:10:40,530
Therian mammals was a small
rat like creature depicted
in this illustration that

1234
01:10:40,531 --> 01:10:44,970
lived 145 million years ago. Wow.
In the shadow of the dinosaurs.

1235
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:49,020
So that rat like creature apparently
survived the earthquake or the asteroid

1236
01:10:49,021 --> 01:10:51,210
impact. I don't think
that's the thing though.

1237
01:10:53,010 --> 01:10:55,700
And it's, there's another,
there's a formal name for it. I,

1238
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:59,840
I know because I was on a podcast and
they were the one of the segments of it.

1239
01:10:59,841 --> 01:11:01,250
They talked about this thing.

1240
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:03,370
This is, but they don't, the only way,

1241
01:11:03,430 --> 01:11:06,510
reason why I'm skeptical is because
it says 145 million years ago,

1242
01:11:06,511 --> 01:11:08,480
but I guess maybe they
survived the impact screw.

1243
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:12,030
Scroll back up to the top of the title
says these rodent like creatures are the

1244
01:11:12,031 --> 01:11:14,250
earliest known of humans, whales

1245
01:11:14,250 --> 01:11:18,300
and truce. Oh, okay. That's what's even
more crazy. Like we used to be a whale.

1246
01:11:18,870 --> 01:11:22,710
It's like, or our ancestor, we shared
a common ancestor, I should say. Yeah,

1247
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:25,950
we like went into the sea and
then, yeah, on land. That thing,

1248
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:30,580
that fucking rat became a whale.
What? Maybe that's it with area there.

1249
01:11:30,581 --> 01:11:35,040
There it is. Okay. [inaudible]
that turned into a person. Folks,

1250
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:35,791
think about that.

1251
01:11:35,791 --> 01:11:39,180
When you sat in your rat traps and
a hundred million years from now,

1252
01:11:39,181 --> 01:11:44,010
rats might be some super superior human
form. I think that's very possible.

1253
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,650
But I mean that, I get why Christians
are skeptical now. I'm like, what?

1254
01:11:47,820 --> 01:11:51,920
What do you show me your work?
God May this, God didn't,

1255
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:56,670
I was not a rat. I was not a rat, sir.
Yeah, I just appeared. But in essence,

1256
01:11:56,700 --> 01:12:00,120
here's the, here's a way to it to
kind of maybe justify that argument.

1257
01:12:00,570 --> 01:12:04,380
It's like, let's say the mushroom
thing is true, right? So in essence,

1258
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:09,960
humans became humans with
the, uh, intervention,

1259
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:13,560
if you will, of a natural
psychedelic substance,

1260
01:12:13,561 --> 01:12:18,210
which then expanded the mind and
enabled the growth of that. My,

1261
01:12:18,211 --> 01:12:21,780
the acceleration of intelligence,
self-awareness, like,

1262
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:26,840
like lightspeed and so in essence like
God created man or whatever you like that

1263
01:12:27,571 --> 01:12:30,320
idea. It's like, well in
essence it is the unit.

1264
01:12:30,360 --> 01:12:32,580
If you can think of God is
the universe or whatever.

1265
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,780
That's one way thinking of it,
God, collective consciousness,

1266
01:12:36,781 --> 01:12:40,680
whatever you want to call it. Like
that, that intervention or the,

1267
01:12:40,681 --> 01:12:45,570
the ability to see or sense
that expansiveness of that
collective intelligence

1268
01:12:46,770 --> 01:12:50,190
could be attributed to God. So
therefore you could say, well,

1269
01:12:50,191 --> 01:12:52,890
I was never a blow. It's like,
well yeah, you are from that.

1270
01:12:52,891 --> 01:12:56,780
But what created you was
something more cosmic. So,

1271
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:59,790
and if, if that's even true. Well,

1272
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:03,450
I was reading a quote today from
someone was mocking from Piers Morgan.

1273
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:05,630
We was talking about the unit,

1274
01:13:05,640 --> 01:13:10,640
like atheists and not knowing
what happened before the Big Bang,

1275
01:13:10,680 --> 01:13:15,680
not knowing how no one has any answer
for what happened before the Big Bang and

1276
01:13:16,021 --> 01:13:20,400
about how this made sense
to him. That um, this is,

1277
01:13:21,090 --> 01:13:22,530
I think the way he was saying it was, uh,

1278
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:25,710
somehow or another it was
evidence or at least in his eyes,

1279
01:13:25,890 --> 01:13:27,450
something more superior. Oh, here it is.

1280
01:13:28,120 --> 01:13:32,820
No atheist can never say what
was there before. The Big Bang.

1281
01:13:32,821 --> 01:13:36,090
They just say nothing and they can't
explain what nothing actually is.

1282
01:13:36,091 --> 01:13:37,290
No human brain can.

1283
01:13:37,291 --> 01:13:40,800
Which is why I believe in something that
has superior powers to the human brain.

1284
01:13:41,430 --> 01:13:45,510
Well that makes sense that
there's definitely, oh,
Brian Cox went after his ass.

1285
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:50,670
What? Brian Cox, if you
mean the hot big bang,

1286
01:13:50,671 --> 01:13:55,020
than there may be a period of
rapid expansion known as inflation.

1287
01:13:55,410 --> 01:13:58,260
This theory is able to account for
the observe features of the universe,

1288
01:13:58,770 --> 01:14:03,770
including cutting the CMB power spectrum
and the flatness and horizon problems.

1289
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:09,800
I love it. Cox just came at him with the
science. I love it. I always to do it.

1290
01:14:09,990 --> 01:14:12,040
I know what he's trying to say.
What Morgan is trying to say

1291
01:14:12,270 --> 01:14:12,960
and the EAS.

1292
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:16,960
He's right that no one has an answer
as to like why this thing became,

1293
01:14:16,961 --> 01:14:18,220
why the big bang happened.

1294
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:22,650
It's a w this is an interesting quote
by this guy we were talking about,

1295
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:24,990
forget who it was. I
wish I could remember,

1296
01:14:25,010 --> 01:14:27,310
but he was talking about how people have,

1297
01:14:27,360 --> 01:14:32,360
it might've been mckenna have so much
faith in science and so little faith in

1298
01:14:32,531 --> 01:14:33,550
mystical things,

1299
01:14:33,551 --> 01:14:38,551
but yet science revolves on one
initial theory where magic took place,

1300
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:42,190
where everything came out of nothing,

1301
01:14:42,730 --> 01:14:44,530
that it was smaller than
the head of a pencil.

1302
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:48,130
Everything you see in the observable
universe, including planes,

1303
01:14:48,131 --> 01:14:49,210
trains and automobiles,

1304
01:14:49,450 --> 01:14:54,450
all of it had to have had an origin in
the most spectacular sorcery the world

1305
01:14:55,780 --> 01:14:59,680
has ever known. Like it is all
dependent upon magic. So he wasn't,

1306
01:15:00,010 --> 01:15:01,900
he wasn't saying that, you know,

1307
01:15:02,530 --> 01:15:07,530
ridiculous ideological ideas of the
start and birth and death of the universe

1308
01:15:08,410 --> 01:15:10,660
are fact. But he was
saying that, look, look,

1309
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:15,930
the fact according to scientists is that
all evidence points to this whole thing

1310
01:15:16,631 --> 01:15:18,760
coming out of nothing. This whole thing,

1311
01:15:18,970 --> 01:15:20,290
this whole thing existing out of nowhere.

1312
01:15:20,470 --> 01:15:24,220
And with Piers Morgan is I think is
saying is that that gives birth, that,

1313
01:15:24,230 --> 01:15:27,670
that that gives proof to something
superior to the human brain,

1314
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:32,560
which for sure it does. Well, yes,
he, we are at this, this is Terrence.

1315
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:32,920
We kind of,

1316
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:35,290
we were asked by science to believe
that the entire universe sprang from

1317
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:39,700
nothingness and at a single point,
and for no discernible reason.

1318
01:15:39,850 --> 01:15:44,470
This notion is the limit case
for credulity. In other words,

1319
01:15:44,620 --> 01:15:48,210
if you can believe this, you can believe
anything. Well, I think I said it,

1320
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:52,240
I said it in a paraphrase like away.
That's basically the same thing. He's,

1321
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:55,870
I'm just saying it's all nuts, man.

1322
01:15:56,050 --> 01:15:59,530
Yeah, I mean it, my, my thing is like,

1323
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:04,440
I think I like to think of it
as in simulation terms, in, in,

1324
01:16:04,441 --> 01:16:07,810
in the sense that if thinking of like
reality and the way it's perceived and the

1325
01:16:07,811 --> 01:16:11,770
way that we weave through it as kind
of a designed game of, of sorts.

1326
01:16:12,490 --> 01:16:17,230
And so if I think of it in that
way, like nothing and something,

1327
01:16:17,260 --> 01:16:21,250
nothing in something that's just kind of,
that's the core of our reality, right?

1328
01:16:21,251 --> 01:16:22,660
We live in a binary reality.

1329
01:16:22,690 --> 01:16:27,690
Everything is a complex assortment of
binaries that add up into a really complex

1330
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:31,480
system in a way. So what do you
think it's moving towards? Well,

1331
01:16:31,481 --> 01:16:33,280
think about that. Well
that's, that's the thing.

1332
01:16:33,281 --> 01:16:38,281
I think that part of the rules or
what makes it hard to rationalize like

1333
01:16:39,700 --> 01:16:43,420
nothingness or, uh, or something very,

1334
01:16:43,421 --> 01:16:48,280
very fantastic is just because
it, because it's binary.

1335
01:16:48,281 --> 01:16:50,050
We are binary in our thought process.

1336
01:16:50,051 --> 01:16:53,140
So it's hard for us to not
think of things in a binary way.

1337
01:16:53,260 --> 01:16:55,960
So we think other was the
beginning. No, there was an ending.

1338
01:16:55,990 --> 01:16:59,260
There was a beginning. There's an
ending. But really it's infinite.

1339
01:16:59,261 --> 01:17:04,030
It's like it's paradox, right? It's
everything and nothing simultaneously and,

1340
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:05,920
and the absence of which, but,

1341
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:10,280
but I guess what I'm saying is that
the idea that things are infinite,

1342
01:17:10,550 --> 01:17:14,990
that reality is infinite is kind of
a good way, but kind of can be scary,

1343
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:20,410
but a good way to think of it because it
doesn't make any sense why it wouldn't

1344
01:17:20,751 --> 01:17:20,901
be,

1345
01:17:20,901 --> 01:17:25,250
it seems like we have a limited way of
viewing what reality is and I think we're

1346
01:17:25,251 --> 01:17:28,730
limited by our binary thought
processes, I guess. Well,

1347
01:17:28,731 --> 01:17:31,910
it's also interesting that we want
to put any sort of limitations on the

1348
01:17:31,911 --> 01:17:35,960
universe in that. Yeah. It's immense
size isn't crazy enough for us.

1349
01:17:36,070 --> 01:17:38,480
Yeah. You know what I mean?

1350
01:17:38,720 --> 01:17:42,260
I know we can look at what we know,

1351
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:46,700
if we know that the universe has
hundreds of billions of galaxies,

1352
01:17:46,850 --> 01:17:50,760
like just there's a bunch of competing
theories as to what happens, you know,

1353
01:17:50,810 --> 01:17:53,180
with black holes and whether
or not there's multi verses.

1354
01:17:53,181 --> 01:17:55,070
There's a bunch of yes, right?

1355
01:17:55,190 --> 01:17:58,400
But the one of the most profound ones
that it was ever explained to me is that

1356
01:17:58,720 --> 01:18:02,180
there's a supermassive black hole
in the center of every galaxy,

1357
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:06,440
and it's exactly that. I think one half
of 1% of the mass, the entire galaxy.

1358
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:07,190
Oh really?

1359
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:11,600
It works out that the bigger galaxies
have bigger supermassive black holes.

1360
01:18:12,200 --> 01:18:15,320
And the concept is that it's,

1361
01:18:16,790 --> 01:18:20,750
there is a real possibility that
going through that black hole,

1362
01:18:20,810 --> 01:18:25,220
you would encounter an entirely different
universe with hundreds of billions of

1363
01:18:25,221 --> 01:18:29,090
galaxies. Each galaxy have a
black hole in the center of it.

1364
01:18:29,210 --> 01:18:33,740
Go through that black hole, an entirely
different universe. So each one,

1365
01:18:34,800 --> 01:18:37,580
yes, universe, when you have
hundreds of billions of galaxies,

1366
01:18:37,610 --> 01:18:41,660
there is hundreds of billions of
universes through those black holes.

1367
01:18:41,810 --> 01:18:46,810
And each one of those galaxies or each
one of those universes has also hundreds

1368
01:18:47,930 --> 01:18:50,600
of billions of galaxies and each
one of those has a black hole.

1369
01:18:50,601 --> 01:18:53,840
You go through that hundreds
of billions of galaxies that,

1370
01:18:53,990 --> 01:18:58,130
the whole thing fractal. Exactly.
Just like just keeps happening.

1371
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,790
There's a resistance. Nah, come on. Yeah.

1372
01:19:00,830 --> 01:19:04,640
There's a thing that can instant
reaction to resist that notion as if the

1373
01:19:04,641 --> 01:19:09,620
universe itself isn't already the most
incredible thing of magic. Right? I know.

1374
01:19:09,650 --> 01:19:12,350
What do you care if it's infinite? Why
is that? Why would you even resist that?

1375
01:19:12,740 --> 01:19:14,570
Because that's the part
of the binary thinking.

1376
01:19:14,571 --> 01:19:17,780
It's like you want something to
have an end. It's like it's, it's a,

1377
01:19:17,781 --> 01:19:20,300
it's a way for us to survive. But
like, you know, it's like, oh,

1378
01:19:20,301 --> 01:19:24,830
there's an end to that that
creates a, uh, a need to survive.

1379
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:27,290
But when you think of things in
an abstract like, like, well,

1380
01:19:27,291 --> 01:19:29,670
if something is just
infinite, infinite, infinite,

1381
01:19:29,750 --> 01:19:32,420
and what does that mean about us?
It's like, that's the question.

1382
01:19:32,750 --> 01:19:37,160
That's the thing to explore because then
you have to re negotiate your, your,

1383
01:19:37,190 --> 01:19:40,100
your relationship to reality,
which is pretty sick.

1384
01:19:40,130 --> 01:19:44,420
We have at least we'd like to take comfort
in the idea that the universe has at

1385
01:19:44,421 --> 01:19:46,850
least there's a certain parameter to it.

1386
01:19:47,020 --> 01:19:51,810
I know now it's 14 billion light years
and that's it. No more, no more. Okay.

1387
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:55,270
If you can even understand
what 14 billion light is,

1388
01:19:55,480 --> 01:19:56,930
there's no way it could be that number.

1389
01:19:57,570 --> 01:20:01,290
It seems more like 19 whatever that
number is. They know what I'm saying.

1390
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:04,160
The Way Cox explained it to me, that you,

1391
01:20:04,430 --> 01:20:07,860
and I believe Sean Carroll explain
it this way as well. There's a real

1392
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:12,960
does real lack of understanding about
what goes beyond that because it takes a

1393
01:20:12,961 --> 01:20:17,310
certain amount of time for light to
even get to us in that time that,

1394
01:20:18,180 --> 01:20:23,180
that the light doesn't move fast
enough to reach us from further events.

1395
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:23,790
Yeah.

1396
01:20:23,790 --> 01:20:28,790
So like if you had something from like
200 billion light years ago when maybe

1397
01:20:29,101 --> 01:20:32,490
the light wouldn't even get to us
yet. Yeah. There's things that, yeah,

1398
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:36,450
I mean we're living in a time
pain. Yeah. I mean that's when you,

1399
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:37,980
that's the other mind fuck.

1400
01:20:38,190 --> 01:20:43,190
When you're looking in the sky and you're
seeing a galaxy or a any sort of star

1401
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:46,670
like in the deep, deep, deep
distance of space. Yeah.

1402
01:20:47,340 --> 01:20:51,600
The fucking light coming from that
thing left a million years ago. Yeah,

1403
01:20:51,750 --> 01:20:56,070
I know way more. You're literally
just looking at the past. What is,

1404
01:20:56,190 --> 01:21:01,190
if you got to imagine what is the
closest star to our star in the the f the

1405
01:21:03,120 --> 01:21:05,940
seeable universe. When you look
up into the, to the night sky,

1406
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:09,420
what are the things? Was the dog
star? I know our way. Is that a star?

1407
01:21:09,570 --> 01:21:10,830
Sometimes things are called stars,

1408
01:21:10,980 --> 01:21:15,540
but their planets from old school times
and I could be wrong if you had to guess

1409
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:19,920
was the closest. How many like
office in right? I don't know.

1410
01:21:19,980 --> 01:21:23,370
That's how it's great. I have this
entire, is it? How much is it?

1411
01:21:23,371 --> 01:21:27,930
How far was that? Four.
4.3 light years from Earth.

1412
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:31,380
Wow. That's bad. That's a hop. Skip
and that jump kills. Here you go.

1413
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:32,990
The speed of light take you four years.

1414
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,140
Like the Hawaii of outer space that like
they go there and they was a pit stop

1415
01:21:37,141 --> 01:21:39,840
there before they come to earth and
the aliens come. They want to chill.

1416
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:42,600
I hope so.

1417
01:21:43,480 --> 01:21:48,380
All right. So hold on. There's a this is
it. Oh Shit. Breaking. No, not really.

1418
01:21:48,381 --> 01:21:51,800
No. So it's a binary pair.

1419
01:21:52,040 --> 01:21:55,220
So I imagine that means that they move
around each other a little bit orbit

1420
01:21:55,221 --> 01:21:58,400
around each other. There's technically
a third star Proxima Centauri,

1421
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:01,430
which is because it says
those are an average of 4.3.

1422
01:22:01,431 --> 01:22:06,320
This one's 4.22 so it's nearly
closer. Nice. It's that average.

1423
01:22:06,321 --> 01:22:09,190
So two are closer than
the one on one day? No.

1424
01:22:09,230 --> 01:22:13,250
Do they know if there's planets
around those stars? So the um,

1425
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:17,570
they didn't even know there were other
planets for sure. Other than, I know,

1426
01:22:17,660 --> 01:22:20,990
isn't that crazy? Until just a couple
of decades ago. It's so amazing to me.

1427
01:22:20,991 --> 01:22:24,140
It's like shining a flashlight
in the ocean. Yeah. You know,

1428
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:27,590
like that's what spaces,
like you're removing a beam,

1429
01:22:27,591 --> 01:22:31,910
but like things are constantly changing
at different distances and you can see

1430
01:22:31,911 --> 01:22:34,760
better under certain circumstances
and you can see at different times.

1431
01:22:34,970 --> 01:22:38,450
So like it's kind of like a big
existential party. You're like,

1432
01:22:38,630 --> 01:22:40,850
I think I'm making sense of this.

1433
01:22:40,940 --> 01:22:43,730
And then there's all these theories
and then someone catches another angle.

1434
01:22:43,731 --> 01:22:45,620
They're like, no, no, no. I mean, yes,

1435
01:22:45,621 --> 01:22:47,540
a little bit of what you guys
were thinking but also this.

1436
01:22:47,541 --> 01:22:49,910
And they're like fuck. And
they just keep adding to it.

1437
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:53,570
But I don't know if we're going
to find necessarily anything. Um,

1438
01:22:53,630 --> 01:22:57,260
well when you talk to physicists about
the subject and they try to explain to

1439
01:22:57,261 --> 01:23:01,520
you how they even reached
these conclusions and how
they know that there's black

1440
01:23:01,521 --> 01:23:06,521
holes out there in the first place
and the theories fucking like these,

1441
01:23:06,911 --> 01:23:11,590
these, these theories of multi verses
and yeah, that's my favorite. And brains.

1442
01:23:11,610 --> 01:23:16,240
The membranes that there's like, yeah,
in theory, like lines of Universes,

1443
01:23:16,360 --> 01:23:19,370
then we collide with each other
occasionally. Yeah. What the fuck?

1444
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:23,800
That's what I think ghosts are by the
way. Which was like in the interest in,

1445
01:23:23,860 --> 01:23:27,720
it was an interstellar one with, yeah,
with Matthew Modine. Is that the star

1446
01:23:31,170 --> 01:23:35,260
[inaudible] [inaudible] list
guys, vision quest. Different era

1447
01:23:36,810 --> 01:23:40,600
or the Russian training with the
log. Yeah. The stairs. Yes. No,

1448
01:23:40,601 --> 01:23:44,290
he wasn't rushing. He was a no, no, no,
no. Here's the shoot. Oh yeah, he was,

1449
01:23:44,350 --> 01:23:47,290
he was like the cold trick,
right boy. Yeah. Some,

1450
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:50,420
but there was like a guy training
that was gable brick and mortar was,

1451
01:23:50,870 --> 01:23:54,430
was the opponent training. Well,
Matthew Modine was trading crazy,

1452
01:23:54,431 --> 01:23:57,640
but he was trying to drop weight to
go down to fight this, the Russell,

1453
01:23:57,641 --> 01:24:00,280
this guy that everybody was terrified
of. Yeah, that's right. What it was,

1454
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:02,440
but was shoot the one that
was walking with a log. Yeah.

1455
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:06,650
He was carrying a log up us up stadium
stairs. Right. That was so sad.

1456
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:08,320
And he was like super hardcore. He's like,

1457
01:24:08,321 --> 01:24:11,440
you think you're going to make the
weight? He goes, I hope so. He goes,

1458
01:24:11,441 --> 01:24:14,750
I hope so too. And just kept
walking with a long boom. Good.

1459
01:24:14,980 --> 01:24:19,690
See if you can find that scene. That's
so good. I mean, it's a great movie,

1460
01:24:19,691 --> 01:24:23,170
man. It's a great thing. Cause
like that interaction right there,

1461
01:24:23,250 --> 01:24:26,560
it's so genius because it's like tells
you everything you need to know about

1462
01:24:26,561 --> 01:24:31,460
both of those characters. Yeah,
exactly. So they go there. Here he is.

1463
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:34,570
There's a dude as bad as a
beast wrestler. Of course.

1464
01:24:34,571 --> 01:24:38,230
He's by himself as his friends.
Got a fucking cool headband. Well,

1465
01:24:38,231 --> 01:24:39,760
his friend was a fake Indian.

1466
01:24:39,940 --> 01:24:44,770
Oh friend lied about being a native
American so he could get into college.

1467
01:24:44,860 --> 01:24:49,300
No cheaper started made him look cool.
Like, Oh, here we go. Do I know what you

1468
01:24:51,250 --> 01:24:55,000
thought on Sweet Thompson hug? Can you
play this over the air? No, no, don't.

1469
01:24:55,001 --> 01:24:58,920
We'll get, we'll get pulled.
Yeah. Taken. Make. Wait.

1470
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:02,980
I hope so. I was like, oh, hope so too.

1471
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:10,750
Just walking around with his
log. Boom. Everyone's scared.

1472
01:25:10,751 --> 01:25:14,150
Fuck that dude. It's pretty big. Yeah,

1473
01:25:14,360 --> 01:25:18,150
dude for 80s yeah. Good. Well
he looked like a wrestler. Yeah.

1474
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:21,130
He looked real like guys like Mark Schultz
when he's competing in the Olympics.

1475
01:25:21,131 --> 01:25:24,670
He was fucking jacked man. Yeah. There
was some Jack wrestlers back then.

1476
01:25:25,430 --> 01:25:27,070
Still this obviously. Yeah.

1477
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:31,780
It's one of the more physically intensive
things you can do at that protection.

1478
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:35,860
That muscle protects you. It's also,
I mean just wrestling all the time.

1479
01:25:35,940 --> 01:25:38,830
You're gonna get strong. Oh
yeah, that true. That too.

1480
01:25:38,831 --> 01:25:42,520
You get a certain kind of strength to
that weird grip strength Yo man and

1481
01:25:42,690 --> 01:25:45,520
telling you that shit. It was
like, it's like immediate,

1482
01:25:45,760 --> 01:25:50,130
like violent amounts of strength
like for grips and stuff like that.

1483
01:25:50,290 --> 01:25:52,720
Cause I just remember my friend who
was a wrestler and I was like, yeah,

1484
01:25:52,721 --> 01:25:55,120
I don't know wrestling. It seems
pretty hard or whatever. See here,

1485
01:25:55,121 --> 01:25:57,250
let me show you a move.
And I was standing,

1486
01:25:57,251 --> 01:26:01,810
I was looking at him and I just blinked
and I was just out of breath on the

1487
01:26:01,811 --> 01:26:02,920
ground, on my back. Just like

1488
01:26:05,020 --> 01:26:07,820
the experts at throwing bodies
around. Just like, ugh. Okay.

1489
01:26:07,870 --> 01:26:12,350
I mean it's like strength grip and being
able to torque shit and shit happened.

1490
01:26:12,351 --> 01:26:15,980
I mean it's insane to think about
things you do to get fit right.

1491
01:26:15,981 --> 01:26:19,640
Like with sandbags and stuff. People
do lie like extreme things, right?

1492
01:26:20,060 --> 01:26:23,570
They flip tires, throw sand bangers. Yup.

1493
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,750
They take a heavy bags too. They throw
them over their shoulder. Oh yeah.

1494
01:26:27,050 --> 01:26:27,681
When you're wrestling,

1495
01:26:27,681 --> 01:26:31,610
you doing all that plus and plus it's
resisting plus another things trying to

1496
01:26:31,611 --> 01:26:36,110
get you right. Yeah. It's super active.
It's like it's like active strength.

1497
01:26:36,230 --> 01:26:40,970
That's going to be a deeper form of
strength. Range of motion. Strength. Yeah.

1498
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:44,990
That's why the worst kind of strength
is like Nautilus machine strength. Yeah.

1499
01:26:44,991 --> 01:26:47,040
Yeah. Weight assisted mission.
Not the worst kind of strange,

1500
01:26:47,041 --> 01:26:49,460
I shouldn't say that. Those
things all have their purpose.

1501
01:26:49,461 --> 01:26:54,140
They're really good for like specific
types of works at workouts and specific

1502
01:26:54,141 --> 01:26:57,440
types of exercises where you're just
trying to fatigue the muscles like a lot,

1503
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:01,400
a lot of strength and
conditioning athletes like to
use those to bang out reps

1504
01:27:01,401 --> 01:27:06,050
because it's, they feel like there's
less factors going on in terms of, um,

1505
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:07,870
whether or not you could
drop the weight when the,

1506
01:27:07,910 --> 01:27:11,810
when you're losing your coordination.
Safe lost. It's safer, but it's,

1507
01:27:11,900 --> 01:27:16,900
most people don't think it's ideal for
just for sports specific maybe for,

1508
01:27:17,570 --> 01:27:20,910
um, um, just overall
strength because you're,

1509
01:27:20,930 --> 01:27:25,020
you're not getting balanced with it.
Like if you, if you go to heavy weights,

1510
01:27:25,400 --> 01:27:26,960
like free weights,

1511
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:31,000
most people think that free weights are
superior to a machine because you got to

1512
01:27:31,001 --> 01:27:34,250
balance that thing, push it up. Then
you develop, you develop stability,

1513
01:27:34,310 --> 01:27:38,240
you're actually holding the weight
instead of just pushing against a for like

1514
01:27:38,241 --> 01:27:42,110
using your force against something
that's lined up on tracks. Yeah,

1515
01:27:42,111 --> 01:27:45,320
you're controlling it. You have
to control it the whole way. Yeah.

1516
01:27:45,321 --> 01:27:47,210
So that's what wrestling
is, but it's fighting back.

1517
01:27:47,240 --> 01:27:50,870
It's even harder to get a hundred on
top of that 80 pound dude who's also

1518
01:27:50,871 --> 01:27:53,120
fighting back and fuck.

1519
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:55,730
Like he was trying to pick them up and
move them around and he was also trying

1520
01:27:55,731 --> 01:27:59,220
to get you at the same time. And
it's true and it's all strategic.

1521
01:27:59,550 --> 01:28:03,230
So you're like honest,
strategic, instinctual level.
Then your hope for your,

1522
01:28:03,370 --> 01:28:05,720
your training and your
reflexes and your intuition.

1523
01:28:05,750 --> 01:28:09,740
It's really interesting to watch like
really skillful technical wrestlers cause

1524
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:13,310
they'd go from one technique to another
and they just chain wrestle like

1525
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:18,250
watching. Like a lot of
those, particularly Russians,
there's a lot of Russian,

1526
01:28:18,270 --> 01:28:22,730
a lot of Soviet block athletes from, you
know, years back even were like really,

1527
01:28:22,731 --> 01:28:23,660
really technical.

1528
01:28:23,810 --> 01:28:27,050
What they're wrestling really beautiful
to watch them chain these techniques

1529
01:28:27,051 --> 01:28:31,160
together and do these different
moves to try to achieve dominance.

1530
01:28:32,190 --> 01:28:34,390
Still crazy sport. Yeah. I,

1531
01:28:35,660 --> 01:28:37,490
whenever I watched it
it's like you feel like,

1532
01:28:37,610 --> 01:28:40,740
it's like when I watch dance I'm like
I'm kind of moving with it, you know?

1533
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:44,920
I mean that happens with all sports I
suppose. But wrestling, it's just like,

1534
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:49,130
like, like the energy when I'm
watching it, which has been very rare,

1535
01:28:49,131 --> 01:28:51,340
but in high school used
to see wrestling matches.

1536
01:28:51,370 --> 01:28:54,890
My friend was a wrestler and
just be like, oh whoa. Oh Man.

1537
01:28:55,220 --> 01:28:59,690
Oh fucking exciting. Yeah, it's
cool cause it's like it slows down,

1538
01:28:59,691 --> 01:29:03,750
it's fast, it's slow, it's fast,
they're exhausted. You can take a break,

1539
01:29:04,590 --> 01:29:07,350
they go in and then, then
like nothing for awhile.

1540
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:12,360
Like really just like slow mayors and
then suddenly someone just does like this

1541
01:29:12,361 --> 01:29:16,650
really weird and it just flips and
it's like, I love that energy man.

1542
01:29:16,651 --> 01:29:18,990
It's a different thing
than any other sport. Yeah.

1543
01:29:18,991 --> 01:29:21,960
It's different than any other
sport that's in the Olympics too.

1544
01:29:22,050 --> 01:29:25,530
Like the Olympics, you have boxing and
wrestling and then you have sports, judo,

1545
01:29:26,120 --> 01:29:28,890
judo, even tuck window. They have
talked when don't even pitch to now.

1546
01:29:29,280 --> 01:29:33,150
But the thing is that those, those are
the, it's a different kind of sport man.

1547
01:29:33,151 --> 01:29:36,770
It's a sport where people get fucked
up. Yeah. Those are different. Yeah.

1548
01:29:37,170 --> 01:29:40,560
They're just different. It's a
different feeling when you watch in it,

1549
01:29:40,561 --> 01:29:45,390
it's a different consequence
when you fail. Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1550
01:29:45,391 --> 01:29:47,580
yeah. Yeah. I mean it's
as close as you can get.

1551
01:29:47,581 --> 01:29:50,610
It's the closest thing
to fighting. Oh yeah. Um,

1552
01:29:50,611 --> 01:29:54,560
I mean cause fighting is mostly
grappling. It's a lot of it. A lot.

1553
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:58,290
It's not everything. Yeah. But like
at least what, two thirds maybe?

1554
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:02,130
Well No. Okay. Real fights.

1555
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:06,330
Really like a street fight or like make
street fights go down pretty quick.

1556
01:30:06,540 --> 01:30:10,200
Right. Sometimes they do, but sometimes
they just get, people get knocked out.

1557
01:30:10,530 --> 01:30:13,410
Sometimes people can just get flat
cause they don't know how to strike and

1558
01:30:13,411 --> 01:30:16,080
someone does and they punch them
in the face. That happens a lot.

1559
01:30:17,100 --> 01:30:20,190
There's a lot of videos. I think
I've seen some of those. Yeah,

1560
01:30:20,191 --> 01:30:23,850
I mean it definitely does happen that
a lot of fights go to the ground and I

1561
01:30:23,851 --> 01:30:25,110
think Jujitsu,

1562
01:30:25,111 --> 01:30:28,230
a great thing to learn and wrestling's
a great thing to learn because of that,

1563
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:31,230
like the ability to manipulate
someone's body is really important,

1564
01:30:31,710 --> 01:30:34,230
but you also should under
understand what someone's doing.

1565
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:35,310
If they're trying to punch you.

1566
01:30:35,550 --> 01:30:39,270
Some people just don't have any idea
what's happening. Then they just get bong,

1567
01:30:39,810 --> 01:30:43,260
their fucking bell crack because they
don't see a guy pulling his hand back.

1568
01:30:43,261 --> 01:30:46,260
They don't see the shift in weight. They
don't see someone about to punch them.

1569
01:30:46,261 --> 01:30:47,910
They don't see where the
punch is going to come from,

1570
01:30:48,120 --> 01:30:50,100
what direction that they have to avoid.

1571
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,740
They don't see those things because
they've never experienced it cause they,

1572
01:30:52,780 --> 01:30:56,550
they don't have a training. They
don't have any training in striking.

1573
01:30:56,880 --> 01:30:58,770
That's justice. That's
fucking dangerous man.

1574
01:30:58,771 --> 01:31:02,280
This was because if you lose to a
wrestler or you lose to a Jujitsu Guy,

1575
01:31:02,550 --> 01:31:05,040
a lot of times you wrestling
my beat you up on the ground.

1576
01:31:05,041 --> 01:31:07,010
You might ground and
pound you, but Jujitsu,

1577
01:31:07,070 --> 01:31:08,190
you guys probably just going to choke you,

1578
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:12,870
but the kickbox is going to slam
his fucking shit in your face.

1579
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:18,390
You do not want them, man. You
do not want that. Holy Shit.

1580
01:31:18,660 --> 01:31:22,200
The worst way to lose, the worst
way to lose is to a striker. Oh,

1581
01:31:23,930 --> 01:31:26,940
past weekend. No, this is a fastest
ever knock out in UFC history.

1582
01:31:26,941 --> 01:31:31,170
This Guy Jorge Mazda doll knocked out
this two time Olympic wrestler, Ben Asker,

1583
01:31:31,310 --> 01:31:34,540
who's a beast of a wrestler and it knocked
him out in five seconds because asked

1584
01:31:34,541 --> 01:31:38,040
her and went to shoot to try to get
ahold of his legs and Matsudo ran at him

1585
01:31:38,041 --> 01:31:41,370
with a flying knee and hit him right in
the face was while he's trying to bend

1586
01:31:41,371 --> 01:31:45,270
forward. That's legal. Yo Up. Fuck yeah,
it's illegal. That's her right there.

1587
01:31:45,360 --> 01:31:49,800
Boom. Oh fuck. It's all over the
Internet. You want to see it? So yeah,

1588
01:31:49,850 --> 01:31:50,730
it takes five seconds.

1589
01:31:50,790 --> 01:31:55,790
It was one of those things where we
watched it and we went whole Lee shit like

1590
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:59,570
as it happened. Okay. Is that
US talking about it? Yeah,

1591
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:02,960
that one down there. But
that one dog. Oh man,

1592
01:32:03,160 --> 01:32:06,180
you just turned away from it wasn't
the one below it. That wasn't it.

1593
01:32:06,350 --> 01:32:07,930
It wasn't it. No, it wasn't it. Oh,

1594
01:32:07,931 --> 01:32:10,780
it's other people talking
about the reaction. I see.

1595
01:32:10,870 --> 01:32:13,840
It's definitely on Instagram,
but apparently it's getting
pulled left and right.

1596
01:32:14,150 --> 01:32:17,260
Of course. Again tried to do that.
She's like, that's for everybody.

1597
01:32:17,320 --> 01:32:20,320
I don't understand why they would let
everybody have that. It's like, no,

1598
01:32:20,321 --> 01:32:22,810
we need that. We need to own
that commodity. But that's, it's,

1599
01:32:22,860 --> 01:32:25,720
it's good for everybody. It's not
how the Internet works either.

1600
01:32:25,721 --> 01:32:29,440
You don't win the fans here. Here we go.
So this is the beginning of the fight.

1601
01:32:29,441 --> 01:32:31,270
Ready? This is route one. Yup.

1602
01:32:34,960 --> 01:32:39,220
Al Cold. Five second call
by the ref though. It wasn't
even really five seconds.

1603
01:32:39,221 --> 01:32:43,150
He was out cold at three seconds.
Someone did a time from here.

1604
01:32:43,600 --> 01:32:47,560
Boom. Out Cold. Three seconds as
a reference. Running over to him.

1605
01:32:48,880 --> 01:32:52,420
Yeah. And why is he yelling at
him who hated each other really?

1606
01:32:52,510 --> 01:32:53,343
Or they hate each other?

1607
01:32:53,900 --> 01:32:57,010
Jorge Mosfet all said that
guy was taunting him for
like 10 years talking shit

1608
01:32:57,011 --> 01:33:01,090
to him. So he couldn't wait to
do that to him. Yeah. Now what?

1609
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:05,260
Well, Ben dust himself off. He took
it like a man. I mean he really did.

1610
01:33:05,261 --> 01:33:10,060
He went on a talk show and talked
about it afterwards. Good. Yeah.

1611
01:33:10,260 --> 01:33:13,510
That's, that's how you fucking do shit.
Yeah. Yeah. He's like, look, it sucks.

1612
01:33:13,570 --> 01:33:16,240
I don't like losing that guy.
He's a Douche. Yeah. Right.

1613
01:33:16,570 --> 01:33:21,130
But they're probably going to end up
being somewhat friend friendly later down

1614
01:33:21,131 --> 01:33:22,690
the line. No, you don't think so? No.

1615
01:33:23,230 --> 01:33:25,360
Mazda Dahl said that if you saw them
at a whole foods, it's not over.

1616
01:33:25,450 --> 01:33:28,870
He's still smacking him in the face.
Even whole foods couldn't hold him.

1617
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:31,390
Bet whole foods can't hold him back.
Right in front of the Kombucha.

1618
01:33:31,930 --> 01:33:36,010
The real gts can Bucci the kind that you
need a credit you going to show your id

1619
01:33:36,011 --> 01:33:36,844
to get.

1620
01:33:39,230 --> 01:33:43,350
It's like no whole foods, man.
That's like, that's like, Hello Gran.

1621
01:33:43,360 --> 01:33:46,120
You can't start a fight there. It's like,
no, he's willing to break the rules.

1622
01:33:46,180 --> 01:33:48,250
I saw a fight at Disneyland
on Instagram the other day.

1623
01:33:49,170 --> 01:33:52,150
Dude are going out on Disneyland.
Someone got punched a chick to

1624
01:33:53,690 --> 01:33:54,820
seek fulfillment to.

1625
01:33:55,210 --> 01:33:57,460
People were filming it and these people
were throwing down in front of their

1626
01:33:57,461 --> 01:34:01,600
kids at Disneyland. Terrible
technique to everybody's terrible.

1627
01:34:03,370 --> 01:34:04,450
Terrible. I love that. The

1628
01:34:06,010 --> 01:34:09,610
equally disappointing aspects
of it. Oh, it's terrible.

1629
01:34:09,970 --> 01:34:11,860
It's the most disappointing.
It's like guys,

1630
01:34:11,861 --> 01:34:16,450
if you're gonna find it's just
learn some technique. Yeah.

1631
01:34:16,451 --> 01:34:19,420
I mean it's like someone's stealing
the stage and playing a bad guitar.

1632
01:34:19,480 --> 01:34:23,080
You'd be angry with, of course. See
what I'm saying? Yeah. I get it. No,

1633
01:34:23,090 --> 01:34:24,550
I'm in complete agreement.

1634
01:34:24,551 --> 01:34:28,120
I think that that is kind of
equally important because, hey man,

1635
01:34:28,121 --> 01:34:31,240
if people are filming, yeah, people
would like a consensual fight.

1636
01:34:31,270 --> 01:34:33,930
You look like you're trying to
pretend you know how to fight. Yeah.

1637
01:34:34,060 --> 01:34:37,000
And the worst is the
pulling off of the shirt.

1638
01:34:37,060 --> 01:34:40,690
I don't even know how that
even becomes like an instinct.

1639
01:34:40,750 --> 01:34:43,210
It's actually a good move. Well,
it's to keep you slippery, right?

1640
01:34:43,211 --> 01:34:44,360
So you can like, well you want, yeah.

1641
01:34:44,370 --> 01:34:47,050
You don't want anybody choking you
to death with your own jacket. Oh,

1642
01:34:47,051 --> 01:34:50,350
that's true. Yeah, that's
true. Well, okay. But I mean,

1643
01:34:50,351 --> 01:34:53,710
I guess in the videos that I've seen,
it's been mostly about like, hey check,

1644
01:34:53,711 --> 01:34:57,590
she's Jack that I am and like,
oh bro. Yeah. At the end here

1645
01:34:58,320 --> 01:34:59,870
I kind of look like this
dude got choked out,

1646
01:34:59,871 --> 01:35:02,510
but I couldn't quite tell what was
going on here because he went down quick

1647
01:35:02,630 --> 01:35:04,700
cause that's security and he
might even been off for a second.

1648
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:08,620
So he's pulling that girl's hair.
See? Oh yeah, he's out cold. Yeah,

1649
01:35:08,740 --> 01:35:11,660
he's out cold. Oh Gee. Dropped him.
His head banged off the ground too.

1650
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:15,560
That ball dude choke the shit out. And
he's like, well I just killed that guy.

1651
01:35:15,650 --> 01:35:18,290
But to get outta here I think.
But yeah, no one will ever choke.

1652
01:35:18,291 --> 01:35:21,650
No charges were pressed because no one
wanted to say what the fight was about.

1653
01:35:22,490 --> 01:35:23,370
Hilarious. Yeah.

1654
01:35:24,760 --> 01:35:28,280
But was that so it was a guy that was
holding a girl's hair at the use get you

1655
01:35:28,281 --> 01:35:31,760
guys said he got spit on and
then he went crazy. Oh Wow. Yeah.

1656
01:35:32,020 --> 01:35:34,430
I don't know if that was their
whole thing. Not Funny. That's all.

1657
01:35:34,431 --> 01:35:38,660
It takes a little bit of water. A
little bit of, yeah. It's funny. Yes.

1658
01:35:38,750 --> 01:35:41,630
I got all the things that make people
go crazy spit in someone's face.

1659
01:35:41,631 --> 01:35:46,250
It's like, wow, we're ready to go
to war here. Yeah. I mean it's,

1660
01:35:46,430 --> 01:35:49,820
it is pretty quick not approved
biological weapon back in the day.

1661
01:35:49,821 --> 01:35:51,880
If you had some like smallpox shit. Yeah.

1662
01:35:51,990 --> 01:35:54,020
Like how dare you potentially infect me.

1663
01:35:54,410 --> 01:35:56,660
Do you ever hear Damon
Wayne's joke about, uh,

1664
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:01,190
when a magic Johnson came back
to the NBA, Magic Johnson,

1665
01:36:01,191 --> 01:36:05,360
after you had HIV and then came back
to the NBA, he said, Damon Wayans,

1666
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:08,420
who's my opinion, one of the most
underrated comedians of all time,

1667
01:36:08,421 --> 01:36:13,280
still one of my fantastic all time
favorites, but in one of his HBO specials,

1668
01:36:13,281 --> 01:36:16,460
he goes, he goes, everybody was avoided.
Magic. Nobody wanted to play defense.

1669
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:19,460
He goes a step. Dennis Rodman, he
goes down as rob was like, listen,

1670
01:36:19,490 --> 01:36:21,350
I spit in your mouth and
accelerate your symptoms.

1671
01:36:27,520 --> 01:36:28,410
I'll spit in your

1672
01:36:28,910 --> 01:36:30,540
mouth and accelerate your sim to this day.

1673
01:36:30,541 --> 01:36:33,690
That's one of my all time favorite
lines. I hear that line on my God. Damn,

1674
01:36:33,691 --> 01:36:38,100
that's a great, that is a crafted,
brilliant thing to think. It's like,

1675
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:41,130
it's like 180 it hurts. That one hurts.

1676
01:36:41,131 --> 01:36:45,270
I'll spit in your mouth and accelerate
your symptoms I made today. No, he says,

1677
01:36:45,271 --> 01:36:47,670
I'm sorry, I fucked Madonna
and that's what he said.

1678
01:36:47,671 --> 01:36:50,050
I'll spit in your mouth and
accelerate. You said, oh, it's even,

1679
01:36:50,051 --> 01:36:51,420
it's even more potent.

1680
01:36:54,250 --> 01:36:54,860
Oh, that's

1681
01:36:54,860 --> 01:36:57,850
like some shit talking. Just like
that's the type of shit that man is,

1682
01:36:57,890 --> 01:37:00,650
that wins the whole thing. Yeah.
You got to walk away. Yeah.

1683
01:37:00,710 --> 01:37:04,670
Keep talking after that. Now that's
it. And I think you lost like, man,

1684
01:37:05,750 --> 01:37:09,740
take it last second man. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1685
01:37:09,741 --> 01:37:12,830
Maybe that's why it's bidding and it's
also, it's gross. It's just gross.

1686
01:37:13,330 --> 01:37:17,090
It's just gross and so rude.
It's so fucking rude. I mean,

1687
01:37:17,091 --> 01:37:19,730
when someone purposefully spits
at you. Yeah. You're like,

1688
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:24,140
I want to destroy you. Okay. I would
kind of understand that reaction.

1689
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:27,650
You said thing people were getting
like licking food at grocery stores.

1690
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:30,470
Like some girls going to get arrested
or she's facing like 20 years or

1691
01:37:30,471 --> 01:37:33,020
something. I don't understand.
I don't want to know why

1692
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:36,870
they thought that it was funny to look
food and then know that people are going

1693
01:37:36,950 --> 01:37:38,030
to buy it. Yeah. Yeah.

1694
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:40,460
Well people think it's funny to
spit in people's food when they're,

1695
01:37:40,730 --> 01:37:44,780
they're serving it to, yeah, it's weird.
People would kind of grow sometimes,

1696
01:37:45,870 --> 01:37:49,580
you know? They'll get it any way
they can, man. Yeah, we'll get back.

1697
01:37:49,820 --> 01:37:53,900
We'll get back at the, where else do
you take this shit position in life?

1698
01:37:54,040 --> 01:37:55,960
It's like, no, I don't,
I don't agree. He's your

1699
01:37:56,360 --> 01:37:57,600
salad. Sorry. Yeah.

1700
01:37:58,420 --> 01:38:02,370
No, I mix it up. Eh? So
you gotta be nice to son.

1701
01:38:02,410 --> 01:38:03,460
You gotta mean that to everybody,

1702
01:38:03,461 --> 01:38:06,400
but we like swapping spit with people
and that weird. That is really weird.

1703
01:38:06,401 --> 01:38:10,300
Well, because that's consensual, right?
Yeah. Well not just, it's consensual.

1704
01:38:10,301 --> 01:38:13,090
It's like it's pleasurable. It's
like even if it's consensual,

1705
01:38:13,091 --> 01:38:15,250
you don't want to be
spitting in your mouth. No,

1706
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:16,900
because that's super fucking gross. Yeah.

1707
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:21,010
Kissing someone's okay amount and they're
like, took like that would be weird.

1708
01:38:21,040 --> 01:38:23,020
Like you just spit in
my food. This is gross.

1709
01:38:23,560 --> 01:38:26,070
But if someone's kissing you and
their tongues in your mouth and you're

1710
01:38:26,071 --> 01:38:31,060
swapping, literally swapping spit,
it's sexy. It's hot. We like it. Yeah.

1711
01:38:31,420 --> 01:38:34,040
Yeah. I'm glad. I'm glad
that I liked that part. Yeah,

1712
01:38:34,300 --> 01:38:37,930
because the other part I'm just like, Yo
Bro, you can't, what's wrong with you?

1713
01:38:37,990 --> 01:38:41,350
Why are you doing? Are you doing
spitting in each other's mouth?

1714
01:38:41,380 --> 01:38:43,570
You don't need to do that.
You can just choose not to.

1715
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:47,620
It's like the delivery methods where we
have a real problem with, yeah, exactly.

1716
01:38:47,621 --> 01:38:50,500
Apart from the program is two
fucking football players do it.

1717
01:38:50,860 --> 01:38:53,650
This specific giant loop that's a moving,

1718
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:58,340
so they really did do it for the
scene. Pretty short. They had to, oh,

1719
01:38:58,341 --> 01:39:01,550
fucking viscous. They spit
at each other's mouths. Why?

1720
01:39:01,551 --> 01:39:03,200
Guess when you're playing football,

1721
01:39:03,201 --> 01:39:06,560
you just want to be as savage as
possible and you don't give a fuck.

1722
01:39:07,010 --> 01:39:08,150
You'll make out with a dude,

1723
01:39:08,151 --> 01:39:10,790
you'll fuck a couple of guys and
then you'll go play football.

1724
01:39:11,420 --> 01:39:16,420
Cause then you feel like you don't care
the entire force of the universe behind

1725
01:39:17,520 --> 01:39:21,230
you out. People do things to let people
know they don't give a fuck. Yeah,

1726
01:39:21,231 --> 01:39:25,250
that's true. That is true. I do things
like that. Like have you seen euphoria

1727
01:39:25,790 --> 01:39:30,230
with HBO show? No. It's
fucking fantastic. Yeah, it's,

1728
01:39:30,231 --> 01:39:31,970
I think it's out now. You
know what it is, Jamie?

1729
01:39:32,030 --> 01:39:34,250
I've heard of it and heard it's
good and have not watched it yet.

1730
01:39:34,280 --> 01:39:37,610
It's ridiculous. It's a basically about a,

1731
01:39:37,611 --> 01:39:41,890
it centers around a drug
addicted, uh, high schooler, uh,

1732
01:39:41,930 --> 01:39:44,330
played by as in [inaudible] and uh,

1733
01:39:44,810 --> 01:39:48,320
it's just about the modern
kind of modern generation,

1734
01:39:48,321 --> 01:39:51,160
high school experience through her, uh,

1735
01:39:51,320 --> 01:39:56,320
drug addiction or trying to overcome drug
addiction or kind of realizing what is

1736
01:39:56,901 --> 01:39:59,240
going on with her at that stage
in her life. And there's just,

1737
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:02,420
it's just the culture of all the
things that kids deal with these days,

1738
01:40:02,421 --> 01:40:07,100
but it's done in a really, really
hyper beautiful stylized way.

1739
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:12,300
It's so crazy intelligent. It's amazing.
It really blew me away. I was not like,

1740
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:15,350
I just went to the opening and
it was like, ah, I don't know.

1741
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:18,230
I don't know what this is. And then, uh,

1742
01:40:18,320 --> 01:40:20,780
the guy got up and talked about
it because the writer, uh,

1743
01:40:20,781 --> 01:40:23,900
experienced addiction has been
clean for 15 years. Something that,

1744
01:40:23,901 --> 01:40:26,660
but that was his life back
then as a, as a teenager.

1745
01:40:26,661 --> 01:40:29,390
And so they had adapted it and it's great.

1746
01:40:29,840 --> 01:40:33,710
But the reason why I bring that up is,
what were we talking about a second ago?

1747
01:40:34,500 --> 01:40:37,550
What are talking about
spitting each other's mouths?

1748
01:40:38,510 --> 01:40:41,750
Yeah. We went from that to people want
to pretend they don't give a fuck.

1749
01:40:41,910 --> 01:40:45,710
I'd want to let you know they don't give
a fuck. Oh yeah, that's exactly right.

1750
01:40:45,711 --> 01:40:47,450
Yeah. So there's like a great scene.

1751
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:50,680
The first in the pilot doesn't
really give away anything,

1752
01:40:50,681 --> 01:40:54,010
but one of the characters,
she's in a kitchen

1753
01:40:54,760 --> 01:40:58,420
and there's like a big bully dude,
popular guy that's like getting,

1754
01:40:58,510 --> 01:41:01,390
getting interface and
being really threatening.

1755
01:41:01,391 --> 01:41:06,391
And then she takes a knife and
she just slices her arm and shit.

1756
01:41:07,290 --> 01:41:08,920
That fixtures, she, she's like,

1757
01:41:08,980 --> 01:41:11,520
stay away from me mother fucker
or something like that. Uh,

1758
01:41:11,620 --> 01:41:16,620
there's something more
eloquent that happens and then
she introduces herself and

1759
01:41:16,991 --> 01:41:20,050
leaves. She goes, oh, by
the way, and she walks out.

1760
01:41:20,051 --> 01:41:21,550
But it's such an intense scene.

1761
01:41:21,760 --> 01:41:26,080
It goes from the darkest of the
darkest to like a practical, this,

1762
01:41:26,081 --> 01:41:30,850
this person is really smart. The girl
who cut her arm is incredibly smart.

1763
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:34,150
That's a crazy thing to do
to someone. Yes. Yourself,

1764
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:37,220
that kind of stuff in front of them.
It just shows you that it's like, I've,

1765
01:41:37,440 --> 01:41:42,250
I don't give a fuck. Like that's
like, yeah, exactly. Yeah.

1766
01:41:42,670 --> 01:41:45,460
And the guy was, everyone was just
frozen. They were like, I don't know what,

1767
01:41:45,760 --> 01:41:49,000
they're just a bunch of high school
kids in the kitchen. Pretty cool.

1768
01:41:49,360 --> 01:41:49,901
Pretty cool.

1769
01:41:49,901 --> 01:41:53,230
Like a character detail that just kinda
like shows you everything about that

1770
01:41:53,231 --> 01:41:57,910
character in a split second.
Yeah. Jesus. I'm amazing.

1771
01:41:57,911 --> 01:42:02,200
I love that shit. That's intense. Yeah.

1772
01:42:02,230 --> 01:42:04,570
I mean I love when you
don't know something's good,

1773
01:42:04,571 --> 01:42:06,740
you don't know anything about it.
And then it turns out to be awesome.

1774
01:42:06,910 --> 01:42:09,640
It's the best feeling Christmas or my,

1775
01:42:09,641 --> 01:42:13,360
one of my favorite parts of going to
the movies I love previous but yet they

1776
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:16,270
ruined moving. Exactly. I know I'm
the same way. I'm the same way.

1777
01:42:16,330 --> 01:42:18,190
It's like peeking into
a Christmas present.

1778
01:42:18,820 --> 01:42:21,390
Like when you're a little kid
like can I just unwrap this pitch?

1779
01:42:21,690 --> 01:42:26,080
He rabbit out to fucking tie fighter.
Oh my God. It's Darth Vader's. Yeah,

1780
01:42:26,081 --> 01:42:31,081
it will little fucking sneak
and then [inaudible] act like,

1781
01:42:31,540 --> 01:42:36,460
oh my God. And your parents like
let me look at that rapping again.

1782
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:37,353
Yeah.

1783
01:42:37,570 --> 01:42:41,710
Fuck I haven't been caught but
that's almost like what previews are.

1784
01:42:42,030 --> 01:42:43,900
You had to see a little bit
about what the movie is about.

1785
01:42:44,950 --> 01:42:48,310
Wouldn't it be better if he had
no fucking idea of you just,

1786
01:42:48,840 --> 01:42:51,220
I don't want to even know a
synopsis. I don't want to,

1787
01:42:51,670 --> 01:42:54,850
I don't know what King Kong is, which
if you didn't know what King Kong was,

1788
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:56,350
I'm like the newer King Kong,

1789
01:42:56,400 --> 01:42:59,290
you thought it was like about
like a king in the land.

1790
01:42:59,400 --> 01:43:01,600
You have no idea and you sit down.

1791
01:43:01,640 --> 01:43:03,360
You have no idea how the
store is going to come.

1792
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:08,110
Come out and the moment you see the
gorilla, you probably like, Holy Shit.

1793
01:43:08,560 --> 01:43:12,880
Yeah. When he's fighting dinosaurs and
stuff, you'd be like, Holy Shit. Yeah.

1794
01:43:13,720 --> 01:43:15,760
It would be so much better than you watch.

1795
01:43:15,761 --> 01:43:19,900
All those previous are just partial
fucks are amazing, you know?

1796
01:43:19,960 --> 01:43:22,240
But you go to see it and it's
like, yeah, I've already seen it.

1797
01:43:22,240 --> 01:43:24,820
I know he's going to breathe fire out
of his mouth. I know what it looks like.

1798
01:43:24,821 --> 01:43:26,910
You've shown me. Yeah, it's I,

1799
01:43:26,920 --> 01:43:31,120
my favorite trailers are the ones that
just kind of give you a feeling of the

1800
01:43:31,121 --> 01:43:35,830
world and that's it. Like the
new joker trailer is sick. Yes.

1801
01:43:35,890 --> 01:43:39,610
It's perfect example. It's great.
It's a piece of art unto itself,

1802
01:43:39,670 --> 01:43:41,530
but it's not giving away a lot. I mean,

1803
01:43:41,531 --> 01:43:45,190
there's a lot of time you see a lot
of shit and you kind of get an idea,

1804
01:43:45,191 --> 01:43:49,390
but not really. It's a, it's
a very artful trailer. Yeah.

1805
01:43:50,080 --> 01:43:52,970
But you gotta have something. Yeah.
As people aren't going to go to you.

1806
01:43:52,971 --> 01:43:56,000
I know that's the problem. But
remember Cloverfield. Yeah.

1807
01:43:56,001 --> 01:43:58,820
When that came out and make that weird
and the ads that they would show would

1808
01:43:58,821 --> 01:44:02,600
just be like, whoa. And that's all you
heard Cloverfield. And you're like,

1809
01:44:02,601 --> 01:44:05,690
what the fuck is this? Those are weird
movies, right? Like those movies,

1810
01:44:05,691 --> 01:44:10,691
like this movie sucks because it was
just filmed by people who were there well

1811
01:44:11,391 --> 01:44:15,050
yet. Right. Quality's terrible. The
camera's going to be shaky. Yeah.

1812
01:44:15,210 --> 01:44:18,080
You're going to scream and drop the
camera. It's going to bounce it.

1813
01:44:18,170 --> 01:44:21,710
You're going to see, like kind of knew
back then. If, I mean Blair, which,

1814
01:44:21,740 --> 01:44:24,140
you know, it was kind of the
starter of that Bro Blair,

1815
01:44:24,141 --> 01:44:25,880
which freaked me out the
first time I went to see it.

1816
01:44:25,970 --> 01:44:30,240
I want to see it with Chris McGuire,
a comedian, Chris McGuire, and um,

1817
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:34,730
a couple folks that worked at the movie
theater across the street and they came

1818
01:44:34,731 --> 01:44:39,260
to see us. We were performing
at the Houston laugh stop. Okay.

1819
01:44:39,350 --> 01:44:42,680
And so they, they, we were talking to
them before the show and they're like,

1820
01:44:42,681 --> 01:44:45,230
hey, we work at the movie
theater. I was like, oh,

1821
01:44:45,231 --> 01:44:47,540
we're going to probably go there this
weekend and see that Blair witch movie.

1822
01:44:47,810 --> 01:44:50,660
And the dude was like, Hey,
I have the keys. If you want,

1823
01:44:50,661 --> 01:44:54,650
we can open it up tonight after the
show. I was like, what? I was like,

1824
01:44:54,651 --> 01:44:58,730
fuck yeah. So it was right across
the street. So me and McGuire,

1825
01:44:58,731 --> 01:45:00,800
and I think there's like three
of them that worked there.

1826
01:45:01,070 --> 01:45:05,030
We all hung out and watched the Blair
witch together in a fucking empty movie

1827
01:45:05,031 --> 01:45:09,680
theater. They made popcorn and everything.
What does dope, the key to the place,

1828
01:45:10,070 --> 01:45:13,280
I mean, if their boss found out
they would be flexible. Yeah.

1829
01:45:13,281 --> 01:45:15,950
So don't share this,
y'all not telling anybody,

1830
01:45:15,951 --> 01:45:20,720
but this is like 1718 years ago at the
very, I mean, when that movie come out,

1831
01:45:21,620 --> 01:45:26,330
as long as I'm movies, a long
ass time ago, 1989 99 so yeah,

1832
01:45:26,420 --> 01:45:30,890
20 fucking years ago and we were at the
Houston laugh stop. That was awesome.

1833
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:35,610
So cool. What a great flow
of an event to go pass gag.

1834
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:38,480
And then you're like, oh fuck,
check this out. Yeah, it was fun.

1835
01:45:38,510 --> 01:45:42,140
But that movie was [inaudible] effect
scare the shit out of you. Yeah.

1836
01:45:42,290 --> 01:45:45,260
It took me a while to get into it cause
I remember dogma. Do you remember that?

1837
01:45:45,261 --> 01:45:49,280
That crew has so that I remember
the celebration that had come out,

1838
01:45:49,281 --> 01:45:52,400
that was the first movie that I saw that
was made all on India because they had

1839
01:45:52,401 --> 01:45:56,400
those rules. Like they, we only use
natural light. We only use DV Cams, blah,

1840
01:45:56,490 --> 01:45:59,150
blah, blah, blah, blah.
Um, and it was great.

1841
01:45:59,151 --> 01:46:01,940
It was interesting and Weird and
Oh my God, that's kind of crazy.

1842
01:46:01,970 --> 01:46:06,970
And then Blair witch came out and had
that kind of vibe but a little bit more

1843
01:46:07,041 --> 01:46:11,360
curated, like a narrative. But I was like,

1844
01:46:11,390 --> 01:46:15,470
I thought it was eerie, but I really
didn't get scared until the very,

1845
01:46:15,471 --> 01:46:20,471
very end when when it's going down
the stairs and then the flashlight is

1846
01:46:20,541 --> 01:46:25,460
searching around and then sees that girl
facing the corner. That fucked me up.

1847
01:46:25,610 --> 01:46:29,390
Yes. That, that, that one moment.
So the whole thing, I was like, oh,

1848
01:46:29,540 --> 01:46:33,710
it's pretty, you know, it's cool.
It's creepy. Okay, well then it just,

1849
01:46:34,610 --> 01:46:39,050
that thing, I was like, fuck
you. It was a strong closer.

1850
01:46:39,170 --> 01:46:42,920
There was this real strong closer. I
mean that's the way you go out. Yeah.

1851
01:46:42,980 --> 01:46:43,940
That's the way you go out.

1852
01:46:43,941 --> 01:46:47,780
But it's an interesting that we
like movies that are on film, right?

1853
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:49,620
We'd like that look. Yeah we do.

1854
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:52,500
We like the things that are
in the forefront and focus,

1855
01:46:52,501 --> 01:46:56,250
but everything in the back is just like,
yeah cause we're in fuzzy. That's true.

1856
01:46:56,310 --> 01:46:58,070
It's got this like quality thing to it.

1857
01:46:58,080 --> 01:47:01,560
Even though now we see videos that are
very literal from phones all the time.

1858
01:47:01,561 --> 01:47:05,880
We see that kind of imagery.
We still don't necessarily see,

1859
01:47:05,881 --> 01:47:09,090
you wouldn't see that in a movie
theater necessarily. You too.

1860
01:47:09,600 --> 01:47:12,420
Too distracted by all the outside images.

1861
01:47:12,450 --> 01:47:14,790
So like if you're talking to
people like you and I are talking,

1862
01:47:14,791 --> 01:47:15,930
I'm focusing on you.

1863
01:47:16,230 --> 01:47:18,900
I know there's some stuff over the
laugh and some stuff over the right,

1864
01:47:18,901 --> 01:47:21,390
but I'm not seeing it the same
way I'm seeing you. Yes. Right.

1865
01:47:21,391 --> 01:47:24,660
That's one of the reasons why
like when you interpret video,

1866
01:47:24,690 --> 01:47:28,380
like you visually interpret video,
it's a very weird distortion.

1867
01:47:28,381 --> 01:47:31,710
Even though it's the most accurate
representation because you can't look at

1868
01:47:31,711 --> 01:47:32,790
everything at the same time.

1869
01:47:32,820 --> 01:47:36,180
So if you look at a photograph and
everything is in focus, what kind of,

1870
01:47:36,240 --> 01:47:38,610
what are you using? What are
you using to see things with?

1871
01:47:38,730 --> 01:47:40,420
Because this is my eyes
don't work like that. Yeah.

1872
01:47:40,530 --> 01:47:43,260
My eyes are looking at you
and everything around you.

1873
01:47:43,261 --> 01:47:45,450
Like I know there's a clock
right here, but I'm, dude,

1874
01:47:45,451 --> 01:47:48,210
I can't even read what time it is.
It's right there. I can't remember it.

1875
01:47:48,510 --> 01:47:50,480
But now I can read it, right? Yes. Okay.

1876
01:47:50,610 --> 01:47:54,240
You know this stuff that's just a few
inches to your left or right and I

1877
01:47:54,330 --> 01:47:56,880
literally can't see
them. Yes. Just a tiny,

1878
01:47:56,881 --> 01:47:58,920
tiny point that you're
actually focusing on. Yeah,

1879
01:47:58,950 --> 01:48:01,650
just focus on right in front of these
things right in front of the face.

1880
01:48:01,651 --> 01:48:04,740
So that's, make that make sense. Like
for focus, it kind of replicates the way,

1881
01:48:04,950 --> 01:48:08,610
and it's also a storytelling mechanism,
right? Focus on this part. Yes,

1882
01:48:08,640 --> 01:48:11,850
it definitely is that. Yeah. But it
also, it's like the, it looks cooler.

1883
01:48:12,090 --> 01:48:16,010
It just looks, yeah, it looks
dope. It looks pro, you know? It's,

1884
01:48:16,380 --> 01:48:19,740
it's High Rez. Yeah.
Many like a video camera,

1885
01:48:19,741 --> 01:48:24,120
like a regular standard consumer grade
video camera almost takes clearer

1886
01:48:24,121 --> 01:48:27,120
pictures. Oh, for sure. Yeah.

1887
01:48:27,121 --> 01:48:30,690
It's like if you ever put your
phone in timelapse mode. Yes.

1888
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:34,410
It looks like the way it tracks
when you're moving it over objects,

1889
01:48:34,440 --> 01:48:37,360
it's got a higher frame rate
or something like that. Um,

1890
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:40,260
but it makes it look like that
pan and scan shit. You know,

1891
01:48:40,261 --> 01:48:44,160
when you're watching sports events
or whatever and it just looks wrong.

1892
01:48:45,030 --> 01:48:46,560
You know what I mean?
Like it's too literal.

1893
01:48:46,561 --> 01:48:51,390
There's something to the way everything
moves just feels slightly off.

1894
01:48:51,690 --> 01:48:56,400
Do you think that we're just accustomed
to the way film looks and then if we

1895
01:48:56,430 --> 01:49:01,430
were accustomed to the way video looks
than film would be look clunky to us.

1896
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:04,980
You have everything started off as
video and then they said, you know what,

1897
01:49:05,190 --> 01:49:07,050
it's not really good to
have everything in focus.

1898
01:49:07,830 --> 01:49:09,600
It's only good to have some
things in focus in the bag away.

1899
01:49:09,690 --> 01:49:12,570
Some things are blurry and then they
come into focus and actually enhances the

1900
01:49:12,571 --> 01:49:14,330
filmmaking. Yes. Right? Yes.

1901
01:49:14,520 --> 01:49:18,270
Like in a horror movie when something's
blurry and then they zoom in on it and

1902
01:49:18,271 --> 01:49:20,610
you see it, it's like a fucking monster
Highlander under the bed. You're like,

1903
01:49:20,611 --> 01:49:24,150
oh no. Like that's not what,
I didn't want that to happen.

1904
01:49:24,151 --> 01:49:27,750
You've now just revealed yeah, exactly
what I didn't want to see. Yeah, yeah.

1905
01:49:27,810 --> 01:49:31,860
No, I agree. Yeah. I don't know. I
mean, I don't know, but I know that,

1906
01:49:31,940 --> 01:49:35,250
you know, people have like film, I think
it just looks, it's the texture of it,

1907
01:49:35,251 --> 01:49:38,940
but now people like DV. Well, it's
like people like vinyl, right?

1908
01:49:39,150 --> 01:49:42,720
There's people that are just die hard
vinyl fans. They like to sound. Yeah,

1909
01:49:43,020 --> 01:49:46,950
I mean, you know, I like, I like, I
like anything, you know, but I like to,

1910
01:49:47,080 --> 01:49:48,040
I'd like to make sure

1911
01:49:48,040 --> 01:49:53,040
that it's the best quality of it or
the most natural use case for it.

1912
01:49:55,880 --> 01:49:57,790
You know? You know, it's
like when people used to mix,

1913
01:49:57,850 --> 01:50:00,670
when people started listening
more to music in their car,

1914
01:50:00,671 --> 01:50:03,880
that they could like put a thing that
they bought in their car with an eight

1915
01:50:04,100 --> 01:50:07,300
track or whatever. Or they used to
have record players for cars too.

1916
01:50:07,301 --> 01:50:12,010
But you know, uh, the way that
music sounded, they were kind of,

1917
01:50:12,070 --> 01:50:15,190
they also had to consider
the mix of car speakers.

1918
01:50:15,220 --> 01:50:16,600
What does it sound like on car speakers?

1919
01:50:16,601 --> 01:50:21,601
So going back to the aura tones and the
ns tens and then the standardized car

1920
01:50:22,181 --> 01:50:26,290
speakers that people test audio in
and it's a different parameter, right?

1921
01:50:26,291 --> 01:50:30,340
Cause you're, you're stuck in this
little contained metal box. Yeah. Yeah.

1922
01:50:30,370 --> 01:50:32,140
So you gotta figure out
how to mix the music,

1923
01:50:32,141 --> 01:50:34,720
but generally it's the sound
system that has to be adjusted.

1924
01:50:35,470 --> 01:50:37,720
The sound systems have to,
but you mix Tuesday, they,

1925
01:50:37,721 --> 01:50:40,360
they kind of meet each other in the
middle, but great, high five systems.

1926
01:50:40,930 --> 01:50:44,170
My actually, it's a
quick anecdote, but uh,

1927
01:50:44,540 --> 01:50:47,740
when I was in Seattle I knew
that I liked high five systems,

1928
01:50:48,700 --> 01:50:52,570
but I didn't know why
they were so expensive.

1929
01:50:52,840 --> 01:50:57,190
And so I went into this place, this guy
named Leland. Oh, who was working there.

1930
01:50:57,191 --> 01:50:59,920
I was kind of friends with them cause I'd
come in and I just scoped gear all the

1931
01:50:59,921 --> 01:51:04,300
time. Just look at like, oh, I love audio
gear. It's just really sweet. And um,

1932
01:51:04,330 --> 01:51:07,360
and then one day it was towards the
end when they were closing and, uh,

1933
01:51:07,450 --> 01:51:10,900
he turns to me and says, hey man,
do you want to get your brain fried?

1934
01:51:10,901 --> 01:51:14,800
And I was like, what do you mean? And
he's like, stick around. I'm like, okay.

1935
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:17,830
And he closed shop. A couple of his
friends came and closed the shop.

1936
01:51:18,250 --> 01:51:22,540
It's like maybe five of us went into
the back room, smoked some marijuana,

1937
01:51:23,080 --> 01:51:24,310
went into the showroom,

1938
01:51:24,311 --> 01:51:27,340
the main room where they have all the
speakers and all the different types of

1939
01:51:27,370 --> 01:51:30,490
units. And he says, then he
just kind of turns to us.

1940
01:51:30,491 --> 01:51:33,550
We all sit down on the couch and he
says, okay, you're going to listen to a,

1941
01:51:33,670 --> 01:51:38,090
this is a system in total it
costs about $150,000. Wow.

1942
01:51:38,380 --> 01:51:39,190
And, uh,

1943
01:51:39,190 --> 01:51:43,600
and then he just goes proceeds and goes
through and explains all of the stages

1944
01:51:43,630 --> 01:51:44,463
that, you know,

1945
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:47,170
that the current is going through
and what the music is going through,

1946
01:51:47,350 --> 01:51:49,840
what's being played on all the cables
that are being used, all this stuff.

1947
01:51:50,620 --> 01:51:54,190
And then I heard all of that
crazy speakers like, okay, cool.

1948
01:51:54,191 --> 01:51:58,240
He lowers the lights and he puts
on a Bill Evans trio record.

1949
01:51:58,240 --> 01:52:00,280
I can't remember which one. Um,

1950
01:52:00,550 --> 01:52:05,550
and he just presses play and we sit down
and like within probably 30 seconds,

1951
01:52:06,970 --> 01:52:11,950
people were crying. Wow. And
cause it felt holographic.

1952
01:52:11,980 --> 01:52:16,980
It felt like you were in the room with
those musicians that were playing right

1953
01:52:17,621 --> 01:52:21,400
there for you. And then I had the
realization, it's not the money,

1954
01:52:21,580 --> 01:52:22,510
it's not about the money,

1955
01:52:22,540 --> 01:52:27,540
it's about what does it take to engineer
a machine that becomes invisible to the

1956
01:52:27,551 --> 01:52:31,120
experience. And that was,
that kind of blew my mind.

1957
01:52:31,121 --> 01:52:33,130
So whenever you're designing anything,

1958
01:52:33,131 --> 01:52:36,330
it's like you're designing the
experience. The engineering should,

1959
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:41,050
should get the fuck out of the way.
What was the medium? Was it vinyl?

1960
01:52:41,900 --> 01:52:45,710
Vinyl? Yeah. Yeah. What you think,

1961
01:52:45,711 --> 01:52:49,580
like in your description,
what is different about vinyl?

1962
01:52:50,810 --> 01:52:51,351
Well, I mean,

1963
01:52:51,351 --> 01:52:56,270
supposedly if you have a really nice
quality piece of violence cut really well,

1964
01:52:57,320 --> 01:52:57,410
um,

1965
01:52:57,410 --> 01:53:02,410
you get as close to the original mastered
recording experience like coming out

1966
01:53:04,461 --> 01:53:07,280
of the studio if you're
talking about older tape.

1967
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:11,300
So whatever that final mix is, when
someone plays it and they're like,

1968
01:53:11,301 --> 01:53:14,840
it's been mastered, here's the Stereo
to track, we're playing stereo to track.

1969
01:53:15,380 --> 01:53:19,250
It's been mastered. Excuse me,
I'm a little wheezy. Um, and uh,

1970
01:53:19,251 --> 01:53:20,720
and that's what you hear.

1971
01:53:20,721 --> 01:53:24,320
You hear it in the best possible context
on the speakers that it was mixed on.

1972
01:53:24,350 --> 01:53:28,750
It's everything's optimal. So
essentially when a record is pressed, um,

1973
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:33,050
if it can mimic that, the
stereo to track the master, uh,

1974
01:53:33,080 --> 01:53:35,390
which it does, uh,

1975
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:39,350
then you have something that for
at least the first, I don't know,

1976
01:53:39,500 --> 01:53:43,550
vinyl people will say how many times,
but a record starts to wear down.

1977
01:53:43,580 --> 01:53:44,780
But if you have a fresh press,

1978
01:53:44,781 --> 01:53:49,040
you can run it a bunch of times before
it starts to degrade. But in that state,

1979
01:53:49,041 --> 01:53:52,400
you're hearing it like analog, super
analog. It's like as analog as you can.

1980
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:55,570
How many times do you think you play it
before it starts to grid? I don't know.

1981
01:53:55,610 --> 01:53:57,800
I guess it depends on the
ears of the audio file,

1982
01:53:57,801 --> 01:54:01,100
but there's probably an average, I don't
know what it would be. Maybe 60, 30,

1983
01:54:01,310 --> 01:54:02,850
40, 50 times.

1984
01:54:02,980 --> 01:54:07,160
Now is there a digital format
that at least comes close?

1985
01:54:07,850 --> 01:54:12,630
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Flack
files. It's a file format. Um,

1986
01:54:12,710 --> 01:54:14,810
black files are good. Um,

1987
01:54:15,470 --> 01:54:20,470
usually 128 96 killer hurts.

1988
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:21,920
Like that's,

1989
01:54:21,920 --> 01:54:26,420
there's like kind of a mastering digital
mastering standard and that standard,

1990
01:54:26,910 --> 01:54:29,840
uh, is is basically what
that is, what a record is.

1991
01:54:29,870 --> 01:54:33,560
So that's why you have like sites
like HD tracks that I really dig.

1992
01:54:34,520 --> 01:54:37,880
You can get all your favorite out. Well
not all, it's not as big of a selection,

1993
01:54:37,881 --> 01:54:42,881
but you can get a full resolution from
like stereo two track master from the

1994
01:54:44,331 --> 01:54:49,331
studio level quality in a digital format
that you can buy and then put into a

1995
01:54:49,461 --> 01:54:52,700
high rez player. So I have a high
Rez player, a high five pro player,

1996
01:54:53,210 --> 01:54:53,940
and it runs the,

1997
01:54:53,940 --> 01:54:57,290
has really nice circuitry and all that
stuff and then use a really great pair of

1998
01:54:57,291 --> 01:55:01,190
headphones. And you've got the closest
thing to a record that's repeatable,

1999
01:55:01,191 --> 01:55:02,024
infinite times.

2000
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:06,320
And is the headphones the way to go or
one of those crazy tower speaker jammies,

2001
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:09,920
the way to go? Oh well it depends
on your, your use case. Like if you,

2002
01:55:09,921 --> 01:55:10,491
if you know,

2003
01:55:10,491 --> 01:55:14,540
if you ear and a house and you want like
a cool living room system or whatever,

2004
01:55:14,541 --> 01:55:17,060
I would always opt for speakers and not,

2005
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:21,290
not Sonos and not that kind
of stuff. People, they dig it.

2006
01:55:21,650 --> 01:55:23,090
But um, true.

2007
01:55:23,180 --> 01:55:26,500
I mean records are meant to be
played off of two speakers with this.

2008
01:55:26,530 --> 01:55:29,500
It's a 2.1 system, unless
it's specifically engineered,

2009
01:55:29,501 --> 01:55:31,700
which is very rare for like
atmos or whatever the fuck.

2010
01:55:32,090 --> 01:55:33,980
But usually it's two
speakers in a subwoofer.

2011
01:55:34,010 --> 01:55:38,120
So why would I not want to hear the music
the way it's supposed to sound? Right.

2012
01:55:38,510 --> 01:55:40,400
However, I understand the
convenience of those speakers,

2013
01:55:40,401 --> 01:55:42,350
so I'm not totally
knocking it. But for me,

2014
01:55:42,351 --> 01:55:43,890
if you're going to get
a for your living room,

2015
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:47,310
if I can get a 2.1 system, yeah,

2016
01:55:47,311 --> 01:55:50,010
you want it played out the way you
want, the sound to come at you,

2017
01:55:50,011 --> 01:55:53,370
the way it was recorded. Otherwise
it changes the experience completely.

2018
01:55:53,700 --> 01:55:56,640
The Sonos and those types of
things, they, they fake stereo.

2019
01:55:57,000 --> 01:56:02,000
Henry Rollins was on the podcast and he
has this most preposterous set up in his

2020
01:56:02,341 --> 01:56:05,520
house. He is a gigantic
audio file. Oh Shit.

2021
01:56:05,550 --> 01:56:07,970
A massive lover of music. Oh my God.

2022
01:56:07,980 --> 01:56:12,680
He collects all these albums and
he even runs a radio show. He does.

2023
01:56:12,700 --> 01:56:15,900
I love his radio show. It's dope.
It's on case here. So these are the,

2024
01:56:16,140 --> 01:56:20,160
like these are the crazy fucking speakers
he has in his house. What the fuck?

2025
01:56:20,161 --> 01:56:24,810
And there's some, what are those
$200,000 is what they are. Oh, I forget.

2026
01:56:24,811 --> 01:56:28,080
I have seen those. I've seen pictures
of that. That's um, who makes this

2027
01:56:29,820 --> 01:56:33,060
Alexandria XLF is what they're called.
Okay. Wilson. Alexandria. Dope.

2028
01:56:33,061 --> 01:56:36,710
They look, I mean, it's disgusting
looking at those things,

2029
01:56:36,780 --> 01:56:39,240
but you have to have their
weapons. You know, like you, you,

2030
01:56:39,250 --> 01:56:42,500
you have to have pull back so
we can see a gas for full size.

2031
01:56:42,520 --> 01:56:46,800
Those things like look at what a weird
looking piece of equipment looks like.

2032
01:56:46,801 --> 01:56:49,950
Future robot. It looks like an
ATM machine, right? Yeah, totally.

2033
01:56:50,160 --> 01:56:52,260
Or like a display screen robot. Yeah.

2034
01:56:52,410 --> 01:56:56,770
Today we have here swipe here for your
thank you for your business. Goodbye.

2035
01:56:57,450 --> 01:57:00,930
So is the one that we're looking at on
the right hand side? Is that the back?

2036
01:57:01,090 --> 01:57:02,070
Yeah. Wow.

2037
01:57:02,071 --> 01:57:05,730
Look at all that shows the inputs to
know what the fuck they have discreet

2038
01:57:05,731 --> 01:57:09,750
inputs for each of the um, the frequency
spectrums, the different speakers.

2039
01:57:09,780 --> 01:57:14,520
Oh Damn. Some people go deep.
It's like everything, right.

2040
01:57:14,670 --> 01:57:16,950
Look at it. That's what it
looks like. That's another one.

2041
01:57:17,310 --> 01:57:21,150
Look at that Guy Razor's thing.
I mean it's, it's beautiful.

2042
01:57:21,151 --> 01:57:25,560
I mean audio is hundred thousand dollars.
Fucking speakers. Look at that guy.

2043
01:57:25,590 --> 01:57:30,390
He's like, I have it off my spirit.

2044
01:57:30,480 --> 01:57:35,430
Look at the fringe on my captains.
I am Heinrich odor wardens.

2045
01:57:35,700 --> 01:57:39,720
That's crazy, man. Yeah. Well there
you go. And around system and the cars.

2046
01:57:39,721 --> 01:57:43,710
Amazing to man because right. You know,
like you get like I'm a mark 11 sin,

2047
01:57:43,711 --> 01:57:46,830
like I've a alone as a
mark Levinson system in it.

2048
01:57:47,390 --> 01:57:50,160
It's just like the whole
thing's engineered for the
shape of the inside of the

2049
01:57:50,161 --> 01:57:53,790
car. Yes. Such as rings out
and all these perfect places.

2050
01:57:54,720 --> 01:57:56,430
It's tight. One of my favorite places,

2051
01:57:56,431 --> 01:58:00,450
listen to music is a car and I was
stoked to get my Audi cause I got the BNO

2052
01:58:00,460 --> 01:58:03,120
system in there and I've
never heard better audio.

2053
01:58:03,150 --> 01:58:05,260
I mean I've heard some
dope ass. I think I have a,

2054
01:58:05,490 --> 01:58:07,440
I think the Tesla uses Levinson stuff.

2055
01:58:07,470 --> 01:58:09,990
I'm not totally sure people
haven't been able to figure it out,

2056
01:58:09,991 --> 01:58:10,980
but they should've by now.

2057
01:58:10,981 --> 01:58:14,550
But I remember like five years ago
trying to figure like what is the premium

2058
01:58:14,580 --> 01:58:17,850
audio system like what is
besides a premium audience.

2059
01:58:18,210 --> 01:58:21,120
And I couldn't get an answer if
someone figured out what the amp was,

2060
01:58:21,121 --> 01:58:23,130
but they couldn't figure out the speakers
or something. That's interesting.

2061
01:58:23,460 --> 01:58:26,850
But um, but the, how eight
man banging all of a sudden,

2062
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:28,380
and I have some eighteens at home.

2063
01:58:28,790 --> 01:58:32,700
There is a 2.1 system and
it just finally started,

2064
01:58:32,730 --> 01:58:35,010
it kicked in and now it sounds amazing.

2065
01:58:35,011 --> 01:58:38,040
I was like really kind of disappointed
for a while. Yeah, it's weird.

2066
01:58:38,041 --> 01:58:42,130
There's almost, yeah, there's like a
burn in what? I think there's a burden.

2067
01:58:42,150 --> 01:58:44,880
I'm not sure. Maybe it's totally,
maybe you got a bad ball.

2068
01:58:45,310 --> 01:58:48,430
Maybe I did get better weight. I mean,
what'd you think of this? We'd buy them.

2069
01:58:48,490 --> 01:58:51,420
Fantastic. It's pretty real groovy.
Really good. Yeah. It's just,

2070
01:58:51,780 --> 01:58:55,390
it's not weighing you down. No, it's
just a nice, friendly like you're,

2071
01:58:55,730 --> 01:58:59,560
you're fucking high. But like I,
yeah, I feel good. It's stuff.

2072
01:58:59,590 --> 01:59:04,090
It's not like they not
freaking out. I like it a lot.

2073
01:59:04,390 --> 01:59:07,300
What's it called again? Purple.
What? A purple tongue? No,

2074
01:59:07,330 --> 01:59:12,160
a purple rain. Thank you. Geez.

2075
01:59:13,080 --> 01:59:16,120
Why does he know James Bond?

2076
01:59:16,810 --> 01:59:20,970
I know the great brain. That's
awesome. Purple Venom. Legit him.

2077
01:59:21,930 --> 01:59:23,740
Wow. All these speakers

2078
01:59:25,580 --> 01:59:27,310
you have the browns. Yeah.

2079
01:59:27,340 --> 01:59:30,760
And then there's like a subwoofer
that looks like an egg. Yeah.

2080
01:59:30,890 --> 01:59:31,990
And they're great cause it's,

2081
01:59:32,050 --> 01:59:37,050
I have my house kind of mid
century mod and mid century modern.

2082
01:59:37,300 --> 01:59:42,250
Oh, that's me. Trends. I think
it's hilarious. The first time.

2083
01:59:42,251 --> 01:59:46,210
I think I've said it out loud.
Yes. Sorry. That's wrong.

2084
01:59:46,360 --> 01:59:49,750
Just like mid century mod. That's
funny. Oh, you're going to love this.

2085
01:59:49,751 --> 01:59:53,010
The curtains are provided for, I'm,
you'll notice that the, the, the,

2086
01:59:53,040 --> 01:59:55,280
the overall layout is mid cinch mod. Um,

2087
01:59:55,300 --> 01:59:57,250
the only people I don't trust is when
I go over their house and they have a

2088
01:59:57,251 --> 01:59:58,240
minimalist set up,

2089
01:59:58,570 --> 02:00:03,070
like where they have like plastic chairs
that don't have any cushion and a flat

2090
02:00:03,071 --> 02:00:06,040
table with nothing on it. And everything's
small and there's nothing there.

2091
02:00:06,041 --> 02:00:10,330
I'm like, what are you doing? Yeah, I
know. You show me your clean brain. Yeah.

2092
02:00:10,331 --> 02:00:12,940
Fucking psychopath tone. What's
happening here? Where's the,

2093
02:00:13,000 --> 02:00:17,180
where's the soft surfaces? Where's
the place to chill? I, you know, I,

2094
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:21,210
I like what I dig is that mid
century modern furniture, you know,

2095
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:25,620
I don't even know what that is. You know,
like I'm a, was it jewel venn jewel?

2096
02:00:26,350 --> 02:00:29,330
Non Jewels? Uh, I forgot what his, it's a,

2097
02:00:29,331 --> 02:00:33,040
I think he's a Swedish or Danish
architect or furniture designer.

2098
02:00:35,110 --> 02:00:38,110
Fin Jewel. That's it. I
think. Um, and he makes these,

2099
02:00:38,111 --> 02:00:41,860
like you've seen these chairs
before, but the originals are just,

2100
02:00:41,861 --> 02:00:45,520
it's such a great work of
art. It's like sturdy, comfy,

2101
02:00:45,940 --> 02:00:49,030
but light enough that there's like a
bar in the back that's just made to grab

2102
02:00:49,031 --> 02:00:51,880
and you can just throw it around.
But when it is set up in a room,

2103
02:00:51,881 --> 02:00:55,670
it looks substantial and it looks
comfortable but super lightweight.

2104
02:00:55,770 --> 02:00:59,950
So their idea was like to be super
modular, really easy to move for company.

2105
02:00:59,951 --> 02:01:04,900
You know, this are right here. Uh,
that's not quite it typed in furniture.

2106
02:01:04,930 --> 02:01:09,070
Oh yeah, yeah. I, I was
his name a Finn Jewel,

2107
02:01:09,580 --> 02:01:12,670
spelled f I and then, yeah, jewel maybe j.

2108
02:01:13,700 --> 02:01:16,750
G. U. H L. Yeah.

2109
02:01:16,780 --> 02:01:21,580
Like that orange one right there.
Yeah. That's like one, one, one design.

2110
02:01:21,880 --> 02:01:25,150
But that one it has that, that extra
thing of, that's not how mine are minor.

2111
02:01:25,151 --> 02:01:29,440
Just like it's just a, a
back and uh, no arms and the,

2112
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:33,730
but the same shape and you sit
in them and they're just great.

2113
02:01:33,790 --> 02:01:36,520
They're like firm but
comfortable. Like you feel active.

2114
02:01:36,521 --> 02:01:40,340
Like you could get out of it if
you needed to. That were there? Uh,

2115
02:01:40,370 --> 02:01:44,450
no. Uh, what does it say at the top?

2116
02:01:46,030 --> 02:01:50,360
That's his shit. Fin Fin try u h l maybe
try classic or something like that.

2117
02:01:50,361 --> 02:01:53,540
But look and stuff though. Yeah.
It's, I wonder if though the clicker,

2118
02:01:53,550 --> 02:01:55,630
the grasshopper chair. Yeah.

2119
02:01:55,710 --> 02:01:58,790
It's so weird when you have a chair
that's that low to the ground that's too

2120
02:01:58,791 --> 02:01:59,230
low.

2121
02:01:59,230 --> 02:02:02,270
Mine are not like that are like thing is
you can keep your feet in front of you.

2122
02:02:02,600 --> 02:02:05,980
Yeah. Like the stretch your legs out
like that one oh nine chair like that,

2123
02:02:06,020 --> 02:02:09,140
that kind of stuff. So it's
like normal chair height,

2124
02:02:09,650 --> 02:02:13,790
but it's beautifully designed, but
it's minimal. And for my living room,

2125
02:02:13,791 --> 02:02:17,270
like I like the idea that I could just
like move my furniture and if people want

2126
02:02:17,271 --> 02:02:20,960
to dance or whatever, we can just do
that. And you don't have to be the fuck,

2127
02:02:20,990 --> 02:02:22,430
you know, I'm gonna need help.

2128
02:02:22,430 --> 02:02:24,780
Like one person could literally
grab both chairs and move. Right.

2129
02:02:25,230 --> 02:02:28,900
And you don't have some bullshit sitting
there that could break. Yeah, yeah,

2130
02:02:28,930 --> 02:02:32,080
yeah, yeah. Totally. Hey guys,
don't come near the end table guys.

2131
02:02:32,090 --> 02:02:35,750
I'm really sorry about that.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2132
02:02:35,820 --> 02:02:39,530
I hate rock and roll music. It's Kinda
everybody crazy and shit. He says, Eric,

2133
02:02:40,430 --> 02:02:44,720
I told you the beat, the chill out
mixes only. Yeah, you need to chill out.

2134
02:02:45,170 --> 02:02:49,930
Mix for late night. We're like really
groovy Joe beam stuff. You know,

2135
02:02:50,120 --> 02:02:53,810
like in Brazilian Boston,
Nova. Do you, what do you,

2136
02:02:53,870 --> 02:02:57,680
what are your thoughts on like
streaming services, like music,

2137
02:02:57,830 --> 02:03:01,750
like title and stuff like that? You
will, things like Spotify and Pandora,

2138
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:05,570
these street apple music, these streaming
services. I think they're convenient,

2139
02:03:05,780 --> 02:03:06,930
but uh,

2140
02:03:07,010 --> 02:03:12,010
I don't quite trust the quality yet
and I have a lot invested in iTunes.

2141
02:03:12,450 --> 02:03:12,620
Um,

2142
02:03:12,620 --> 02:03:17,620
but I started using title
only because it's the less,

2143
02:03:17,840 --> 02:03:21,290
that seems to be the least popular
of all the streaming services,

2144
02:03:21,800 --> 02:03:23,870
but as Jay z's company,

2145
02:03:24,620 --> 02:03:28,640
and not that I'm like a Jay z fan, I
just liked that it's owned by an artist.

2146
02:03:28,830 --> 02:03:30,740
Right. And that, um,

2147
02:03:31,220 --> 02:03:35,030
they focus on super high end
codex for their streaming.

2148
02:03:35,031 --> 02:03:38,960
So it's like the highest quality
possible for streaming since then.

2149
02:03:38,961 --> 02:03:43,370
Spotify claims to have it. I don't think
apple does it yet anyways, but I like,

2150
02:03:43,400 --> 02:03:45,830
I like the title. So I mean,
I guess the idea of being,

2151
02:03:45,831 --> 02:03:48,140
as long as it's fair for the,
the, the artist, you know,

2152
02:03:48,141 --> 02:03:52,280
the deal for streaming and how streaming's
streaming is calculated and how that

2153
02:03:52,400 --> 02:03:55,920
turns into revenue for our, on
the revenue side of things. Uh,

2154
02:03:56,330 --> 02:03:58,800
that's really important. Biggest
concerns, revenue side of things.

2155
02:03:58,910 --> 02:04:01,790
Cause it seems like that's where
this whole thing was like the wild,

2156
02:04:01,791 --> 02:04:06,320
wild west when it got started in the,
the way the parameters were established.

2157
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:07,550
It's not in favor of the artist.

2158
02:04:07,850 --> 02:04:09,830
It's in favor of the people that
run the streaming companies.

2159
02:04:09,831 --> 02:04:14,210
They're the ones who make the substantial
profits. Yes, absolutely. Yeah.

2160
02:04:14,211 --> 02:04:17,960
The companies do because all they
have is the work of artists. I know.

2161
02:04:18,220 --> 02:04:19,100
Just why it's so crazy.

2162
02:04:19,170 --> 02:04:23,210
They make most of the money because they
provided a platform. Yes. They have.

2163
02:04:24,230 --> 02:04:27,230
You don't sell shit without artists.
If every artist is like, Nah,

2164
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:30,080
fuck you and you don't have
anything. Yeah. You have nothing.

2165
02:04:30,081 --> 02:04:31,400
You don't sell anything. Yep.

2166
02:04:31,460 --> 02:04:34,500
Like year to selling tomatoes and
you don't even grow them. Yeah.

2167
02:04:34,540 --> 02:04:38,310
You want most of the money, like if you
were a tomato and you've got your tomato

2168
02:04:38,310 --> 02:04:41,310
from a farmer and the farmer to do all
this fucking work to make the tomatoes

2169
02:04:41,700 --> 02:04:46,050
and they sold them at your store,
but you got almost all the money.

2170
02:04:46,650 --> 02:04:49,680
Yeah. Those are amazing. I know. It's
totally crazy. It doesn't make any sense.

2171
02:04:49,980 --> 02:04:53,160
Well you couldn't grow tomatoes with
any other farmer for the next 10 years

2172
02:04:53,161 --> 02:04:55,420
afterwards cause they tie you up. Yeah.

2173
02:04:55,720 --> 02:04:57,480
And you have to make commercials
about these tomatoes,

2174
02:04:57,481 --> 02:05:00,750
but you have to pay for them now. They
know it all comes out of your profit,

2175
02:05:00,751 --> 02:05:04,080
not ours. Yeah. Fuck that. It's all about,

2176
02:05:04,110 --> 02:05:07,050
it's all about direct economy.
You know what I mean? Like that's,

2177
02:05:07,110 --> 02:05:09,180
that's the way, that's where we
are now, I think. Right? Yeah.

2178
02:05:09,181 --> 02:05:11,100
I think that's where we're,
where we are, where we're headed.

2179
02:05:11,220 --> 02:05:15,960
I think that's definitely, I
don't, you know, I, I can barely,

2180
02:05:15,961 --> 02:05:17,880
that's why I want to kind of do
my own streaming stuff like that.

2181
02:05:17,880 --> 02:05:20,370
I don't want to be in tied up and to uh,

2182
02:05:20,670 --> 02:05:25,670
with another company that utilize his
behavioral statistical data to increase

2183
02:05:25,921 --> 02:05:28,440
their algorithms for targeted advertising.

2184
02:05:29,060 --> 02:05:31,500
Like that's not really
interesting to me. Yeah.

2185
02:05:31,501 --> 02:05:34,860
I think would've gone like youtube, just
build it and they will come, you know,

2186
02:05:34,861 --> 02:05:39,210
and then advertisers who resonate
with your sort of mindset,

2187
02:05:39,310 --> 02:05:40,680
they'll find you. There's so many,

2188
02:05:40,750 --> 02:05:45,750
there's plenty of cool CBD brands and
fill in the blank of cool companies that'd

2189
02:05:45,961 --> 02:05:48,780
be more than happy to advertise
on something that, you know,

2190
02:05:48,930 --> 02:05:52,770
you'd have a guaranteed audience of a
certain kind of people. Yes, totally.

2191
02:05:52,830 --> 02:05:57,420
Totally. I think it's great. And I think
also just having a direct store too,

2192
02:05:57,421 --> 02:05:57,910
I just,

2193
02:05:57,910 --> 02:06:02,280
I love the idea of like whatever I make
that's just sold to the store and like

2194
02:06:02,281 --> 02:06:05,490
you're just paying me and I'm getting it
and you're getting the thing and that's

2195
02:06:05,491 --> 02:06:06,271
it. Yeah.

2196
02:06:06,271 --> 02:06:08,640
I mean you've worked for a bunch of
different companies before [inaudible] had

2197
02:06:08,650 --> 02:06:10,500
done things. It's like it can be great.

2198
02:06:10,530 --> 02:06:14,190
You can work with a bunch of
beautiful people or be a disaster.

2199
02:06:14,810 --> 02:06:17,760
You've got some time suck in the
middle of the fucking mix and they,

2200
02:06:17,761 --> 02:06:20,640
they just demand too much attention.

2201
02:06:20,641 --> 02:06:24,450
There's too much conflict and
nonsense and interpersonal drama.

2202
02:06:24,750 --> 02:06:28,740
And sometimes people
start fucking, oh yeah.

2203
02:06:28,770 --> 02:06:30,300
People that work together
and start fucking,

2204
02:06:30,301 --> 02:06:33,840
and then you have to hear the opinions
of bolted them while you pretend that you

2205
02:06:33,841 --> 02:06:35,250
don't know that they're fucking,

2206
02:06:35,660 --> 02:06:38,640
that this is weighing heavily on the
way they're communicating with everybody

2207
02:06:38,641 --> 02:06:41,010
else. Like, Oh yeah, that's uh,

2208
02:06:41,070 --> 02:06:44,340
supporting each other and you're
supposed to support them to now their

2209
02:06:44,341 --> 02:06:46,950
relationship has become
center stage in your office.

2210
02:06:47,100 --> 02:06:49,770
That's like one of the reasons why
people don't want office romances.

2211
02:06:49,771 --> 02:06:54,150
Not even just because women don't want
to be harassed by men that are trying to

2212
02:06:54,151 --> 02:06:56,460
fuck them all the time. So
would just say no one can do it.

2213
02:06:56,670 --> 02:07:00,840
But also because once it, a relationship
does happen, one of two things.

2214
02:07:01,200 --> 02:07:03,240
Either it'll grow, one's raped, yeah.

2215
02:07:03,270 --> 02:07:05,550
Either it would go great and
everyone's going to be a part of it.

2216
02:07:05,610 --> 02:07:09,840
So your relationship becomes a part of
the whole ecosystem of the office or

2217
02:07:09,900 --> 02:07:14,310
it'll go terrible and people have to
pick sides and or one of you has to leave

2218
02:07:14,800 --> 02:07:17,970
like so or bad Juju. You,

2219
02:07:18,050 --> 02:07:20,760
if you're amongst the
most miraculous people,

2220
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:24,510
you have a amicable split and you
become really good friends afterwards.

2221
02:07:24,511 --> 02:07:28,050
You still work together with no problems.
Even like each other spouses. Yeah.

2222
02:07:28,060 --> 02:07:31,650
Right. It is possible. It is possible.
It's happened. I'm sure it's happened.

2223
02:07:31,680 --> 02:07:36,040
Yes, but much, much more rare. If I was

2224
02:07:36,040 --> 02:07:39,270
running a company, I'd be like, listen,
you guys can't bang each other. Yes,

2225
02:07:39,280 --> 02:07:43,060
I know it sounds gross. I know that
you're here all day, but problem is like,

2226
02:07:43,061 --> 02:07:47,170
what if you met the girl of your dreams
on a job that was your dream job?

2227
02:07:47,690 --> 02:07:50,810
You're like, Shit. What do you
do? You have to make the decision.

2228
02:07:50,920 --> 02:07:55,420
It's like a fucking Jennifer Lopez movie,
right? Yeah, totally. Like, like two.

2229
02:07:55,421 --> 02:07:58,510
It's called two successful. I don't
give a fuck about this job, Jennifer.

2230
02:07:58,600 --> 02:08:02,200
I want to be with you. Dot, dot, dot,
and play the music. It's like, no,

2231
02:08:02,201 --> 02:08:05,740
you don't have to quit. I'll quit.
Fuck this, but I've got to quit. No,

2232
02:08:05,741 --> 02:08:08,050
you can't. And then they decided
to start their own firm. Yeah.

2233
02:08:08,230 --> 02:08:09,880
If it was real chick movie,

2234
02:08:10,090 --> 02:08:14,470
the girl would have like the smaller
paycheck too and the guy would lose the

2235
02:08:14,471 --> 02:08:16,600
bigger paycheck and he
would, he would come,

2236
02:08:16,690 --> 02:08:19,670
she would come home from work and
he would be wearing a fucking like,

2237
02:08:19,780 --> 02:08:23,830
like an apron and he'd be mopping. Yes.

2238
02:08:24,640 --> 02:08:26,470
That'd be great. Well,

2239
02:08:26,471 --> 02:08:30,360
I guess I guess I should get used to
it like that's how it is. My lifestyle.

2240
02:08:32,350 --> 02:08:33,670
Michael Fell in love the perfect job.

2241
02:08:33,700 --> 02:08:38,380
I gave up my perfect job for
the perfect woman. Yeah, yeah.

2242
02:08:38,381 --> 02:08:41,620
That would suck if you had the dream
job, but you met a girl there who,

2243
02:08:41,650 --> 02:08:45,040
she was single and she was in the you
and you both knew each other and you're

2244
02:08:45,041 --> 02:08:47,260
like, God dammit. What do you do?

2245
02:08:47,290 --> 02:08:49,240
You start banging and don't tell
anybody that's what you do. Right.

2246
02:08:49,330 --> 02:08:53,230
Pro Probably. Or if you're like
super pro and super committed,

2247
02:08:53,330 --> 02:08:57,460
you just figured out a way not to and
just kind of maybe come up with an

2248
02:08:57,461 --> 02:09:00,850
agreement or something. I don't
know. Plot your exit. Yes.

2249
02:09:00,851 --> 02:09:01,620
You got to plot your eggs.

2250
02:09:01,620 --> 02:09:05,520
Always know your exits while you're lying
about banging each other. Yes. Yeah.

2251
02:09:05,530 --> 02:09:08,240
You've got a lie. You got to lie
and say, yeah, we're going to,

2252
02:09:08,241 --> 02:09:11,020
I'm going to the movies snipe,
my friend Melissa. Anyway,

2253
02:09:11,021 --> 02:09:14,680
going back to Todd's house
for some Dick, that sucks.

2254
02:09:15,080 --> 02:09:19,510
That's such a terrible way to live, guys.
Don't do it. It's not worth it. Well,

2255
02:09:19,511 --> 02:09:21,100
the most terrible is
probably live in the closet.

2256
02:09:21,530 --> 02:09:23,740
That's probably the most
terrible. That's the most,

2257
02:09:24,130 --> 02:09:28,780
it's a super unnecessary one I think.
Yeah. In some cases. Not at all.

2258
02:09:28,900 --> 02:09:32,080
Yeah. Well it's also like,
it's symbolic of, you know,

2259
02:09:32,081 --> 02:09:34,780
we all have things in like in
a closet. I mean that's like a,

2260
02:09:34,781 --> 02:09:38,920
that's like a pretty big level that's
noticeable by many, many people.

2261
02:09:39,400 --> 02:09:41,350
But in a way it is a metaphor for like,

2262
02:09:41,410 --> 02:09:44,230
there are a lot of things that we don't
allow ourselves to. Sure. You know,

2263
02:09:44,231 --> 02:09:48,850
like let people know about, and
especially in the corporate world, right?

2264
02:09:49,020 --> 02:09:53,530
You're, you're forced to present
a air quotes, professional image,

2265
02:09:53,890 --> 02:09:58,330
and this enhances your ability to earn
living and enhances your ability to be

2266
02:09:58,331 --> 02:10:00,070
successful inside that
corporate structure.

2267
02:10:00,071 --> 02:10:02,650
So you literally have to
play a role all the time,

2268
02:10:03,010 --> 02:10:06,010
which is why have you talked to women
who are dominatrix is one of the things

2269
02:10:06,011 --> 02:10:06,651
that they say is the,

2270
02:10:06,651 --> 02:10:09,580
the guys who really like to get kicked
in the balls and shit on are the guys who

2271
02:10:09,581 --> 02:10:13,950
run businesses, the guys who are like,
yeah, they need to feel it. It's fun.

2272
02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:16,960
It feel alive. They need
a kick in the balls.

2273
02:10:16,961 --> 02:10:20,770
They need someone pissing in their mouth.
They need so they need to get smacked.

2274
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:24,190
They want to get crazy because
they're so buttoned down all day long.

2275
02:10:24,310 --> 02:10:28,420
They can barely take it. God,
they're so lucky. Reggie,

2276
02:10:28,421 --> 02:10:33,070
you're so lucky in the artist. So
lucky son of a bitch. I love it.

2277
02:10:33,140 --> 02:10:37,010
Sounds in a cubicle right
now. Mad at you. No, man,

2278
02:10:37,280 --> 02:10:41,550
you guys can live your dreams. I
mean, I don't know. I mean it's,

2279
02:10:41,780 --> 02:10:46,160
it's and people about credit card
loans. Yeah, I know. Well, you know,

2280
02:10:46,220 --> 02:10:48,710
we could be more of us,
could be more creative,

2281
02:10:48,711 --> 02:10:51,780
but we're not really designing or as
a society to support that. Yeah. We,

2282
02:10:51,790 --> 02:10:54,860
you and I can't fix the
streets fixing the streets,

2283
02:10:55,030 --> 02:10:59,960
but we can inspire people
to fix the streets. Yeah,
of course. I mean, you know,

2284
02:10:59,990 --> 02:11:02,570
sometimes it just takes a little
kick in the, in the yard bowls.

2285
02:11:02,630 --> 02:11:05,240
Like I was having a conversation with
my friend the other day. We were saying,

2286
02:11:05,300 --> 02:11:06,470
he was saying that, you know,

2287
02:11:06,471 --> 02:11:10,580
you kinda really need all kinds of people
cause there's all kinds of jobs that

2288
02:11:10,581 --> 02:11:12,500
you don't want to do.
And I was like, yeah,

2289
02:11:12,730 --> 02:11:16,160
we're having a problem with our
exterminator and I'm going to like,

2290
02:11:16,161 --> 02:11:20,390
but like could you imagine a dude who's
really cool, who's in the killing rats?

2291
02:11:20,450 --> 02:11:22,940
Like that's what he does for a
living. It's just flux rats up.

2292
02:11:23,210 --> 02:11:25,970
That's his whole deal. He
cares. Rats. I know, I know.

2293
02:11:26,030 --> 02:11:29,870
There are people that just sort stern
certain types of screws on an assembly

2294
02:11:29,871 --> 02:11:32,390
line all day long. That's what
they do. Somebody needs to do that,

2295
02:11:32,420 --> 02:11:35,150
otherwise it's not going to get done
right. You know, I mean theoretically,

2296
02:11:35,180 --> 02:11:36,070
you know, robotics stuff,

2297
02:11:36,080 --> 02:11:39,080
when people fear like robotics taking
over jobs and things like things like

2298
02:11:39,081 --> 02:11:39,914
that,

2299
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:43,970
theoretically the positive side of that
is if societies organize themselves in a

2300
02:11:43,971 --> 02:11:47,690
way that ensures that people
remain productive, um,

2301
02:11:47,780 --> 02:11:52,340
aside from these automations because
it's taking away the menial tasks,

2302
02:11:52,600 --> 02:11:53,810
the repetitive tasks,

2303
02:11:54,010 --> 02:11:58,280
and then we were able to allocate more
brainpower to the economy if that's the

2304
02:11:58,281 --> 02:12:03,080
way it's viewed, it's Rad. I think it's
a welcome thing. And I think, um, yeah,

2305
02:12:03,081 --> 02:12:05,240
there's fear, you know, the
unknown and things like that.

2306
02:12:05,240 --> 02:12:07,370
But if the government helps or, you know,

2307
02:12:07,400 --> 02:12:11,420
there's a transition that's at least
considered, uh, it could be really,

2308
02:12:11,421 --> 02:12:12,680
really beneficial. Well,

2309
02:12:12,681 --> 02:12:14,930
how do you feel about things
like universal basic income?

2310
02:12:15,260 --> 02:12:19,460
How do you feel about that?
I mean, that's a cause.

2311
02:12:19,461 --> 02:12:21,230
That's what people are gonna need.

2312
02:12:21,620 --> 02:12:24,800
If we get to a point where millions
of jobs vanish overnight because of

2313
02:12:24,801 --> 02:12:27,280
automation, which could happen.
You're looking at a, uh,

2314
02:12:27,600 --> 02:12:31,280
I mean obviously I don't, I don't know
what I'm talking about, but if I did,

2315
02:12:31,281 --> 02:12:34,400
I would say you'd look at a nationwide
version of what happened in Detroit when

2316
02:12:34,401 --> 02:12:39,380
the auto industry backed out.
Well, yeah, I mean, I don't know.

2317
02:12:39,381 --> 02:12:41,480
I mean, I don't know like the universal,

2318
02:12:43,460 --> 02:12:45,320
I mean it kind of makes sense,

2319
02:12:45,321 --> 02:12:49,700
but I also don't know about the
successful models and the non successful

2320
02:12:50,030 --> 02:12:53,390
implementations because obviously
with societies it becomes a lot more

2321
02:12:53,391 --> 02:12:56,570
complicated because it's people
and people are complicated.

2322
02:12:56,570 --> 02:13:00,110
And so when you say there's
universal income for,

2323
02:13:00,160 --> 02:13:02,000
there's a base amount
that everybody will have.

2324
02:13:02,380 --> 02:13:04,700
You don't have to worry
about certain things. Right.

2325
02:13:05,870 --> 02:13:08,510
Well transitioning out of the current
state, the mind state that we're in,

2326
02:13:08,511 --> 02:13:10,710
some people are just going
to try to blow it, you know,

2327
02:13:11,110 --> 02:13:16,110
all and then they'll go into debt and
then you know maybe or maybe design the

2328
02:13:16,460 --> 02:13:20,690
system to be really foolproof and it's
just commodities based so people can only

2329
02:13:20,691 --> 02:13:24,790
get the value that they're
guaranteed as a, you know,

2330
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:28,120
rent being paid, actual
food, you know, actual thing.

2331
02:13:28,121 --> 02:13:29,510
So they don't have access to the money.

2332
02:13:29,540 --> 02:13:31,800
I don't know that if you don't
give them access to the money,

2333
02:13:31,920 --> 02:13:35,490
then don't give them adequate choices in
terms of where they can get their food.

2334
02:13:36,000 --> 02:13:36,550
Like I'm not,

2335
02:13:36,550 --> 02:13:39,450
not in favor that because if you had
like a government place where they had

2336
02:13:39,451 --> 02:13:41,370
groceries, you can go get
your groceries for free.

2337
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:42,660
That place is going to be disgusting.

2338
02:13:43,080 --> 02:13:45,930
So I'm going well cause
there's no competition. You
know what I'm saying? Yeah.

2339
02:13:46,050 --> 02:13:49,080
Well maybe no incentive for excellence.
Well maybe if it was like a, you know,

2340
02:13:49,081 --> 02:13:52,350
some kind of a card or something
associated like an apple pay type thing.

2341
02:13:52,351 --> 02:13:54,600
So you just, you go to
whatever store you want to.

2342
02:13:54,660 --> 02:13:58,200
Similar to like a welfare card or a food
stand, like food stamps. Yeah, exactly.

2343
02:13:58,201 --> 02:14:00,530
But a little bit more
framed differently. Right.

2344
02:14:00,540 --> 02:14:04,230
Like you'd have an account
with the government where
every month you'd get like

2345
02:14:04,231 --> 02:14:08,530
$1,000 cash and $500 in food. Yeah.
Like maybe something like that. Yeah.

2346
02:14:09,030 --> 02:14:12,510
And then there were rewards for
like, you know, moving out of that,

2347
02:14:12,600 --> 02:14:16,920
like phasing out of that. Right. The
Way Andrew Yang has it structured,

2348
02:14:16,950 --> 02:14:19,320
you would get, everyone would
get it, you could opt out of it,

2349
02:14:19,350 --> 02:14:22,290
like say if you were doing interesting
yourself, like you could opt out of it.

2350
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:23,300
Oh, that's cool. Yeah,

2351
02:14:23,680 --> 02:14:28,290
I do like the everything thing because
as soon as you decide you make something

2352
02:14:28,291 --> 02:14:30,810
specifically for a certain population,

2353
02:14:30,990 --> 02:14:35,820
especially when you're talking about
that type of thing, it's not, it doesn't,

2354
02:14:35,970 --> 02:14:39,660
it doesn't work. I mean conceptually it
just better when everyone knows like,

2355
02:14:39,690 --> 02:14:41,280
oh, you have it. I have it.

2356
02:14:41,370 --> 02:14:44,340
There's something that binds all
of us that we're all in common.

2357
02:14:44,370 --> 02:14:45,960
Obviously this billionaire
doesn't need it,

2358
02:14:46,380 --> 02:14:49,440
but there's just a precedent for people
that make a certain amount of money.

2359
02:14:49,590 --> 02:14:51,060
They're suggested to like, you know,

2360
02:14:51,090 --> 02:14:53,850
offset that like put it back into the
system so that there's more money,

2361
02:14:54,280 --> 02:14:55,320
people that need it, whatever.

2362
02:14:56,400 --> 02:14:59,640
But I think like saying it's for
everybody is kind of a smart thing to do.

2363
02:14:59,940 --> 02:15:04,380
I like that everything everybody is that
you have equity in the corporation that

2364
02:15:04,381 --> 02:15:08,250
is the United States of America. Oh
that's interesting. Yeah, that's weird.

2365
02:15:08,251 --> 02:15:11,900
Particularly if you're thinking
about natural resources like a man,

2366
02:15:12,480 --> 02:15:16,170
when you imagine the enormous profits
that someone gets from natural resources.

2367
02:15:16,460 --> 02:15:20,010
I like the idea that you own
the oil that's under the ground.

2368
02:15:20,460 --> 02:15:25,440
Like is who's decided that like why have
we decided that you can go a mile off

2369
02:15:25,441 --> 02:15:27,960
the ocean, stick a fucking
tube in the ground,

2370
02:15:27,961 --> 02:15:30,000
suck out all the oil and make $1 trillion.

2371
02:15:30,001 --> 02:15:34,920
Like who said who said you could do that?
That's not even your ground. So the,

2372
02:15:34,921 --> 02:15:39,921
the what the government is giving
a license to BP and BP drills,

2373
02:15:39,991 --> 02:15:44,130
holes a mile off shore and then they
suck all the oil out and they make

2374
02:15:44,131 --> 02:15:44,560
billions.

2375
02:15:44,560 --> 02:15:47,550
And who's getting that money and how
much does the government get and how much

2376
02:15:47,660 --> 02:15:52,320
is it BP paying for that contract and
why doesn't that money go to the people

2377
02:15:52,500 --> 02:15:55,740
that live in the country? Because
if the people live in the country,

2378
02:15:55,741 --> 02:15:59,820
the countries, the corporation,
the corporation is the
one that owns this water.

2379
02:16:00,200 --> 02:16:03,420
Yeah, they're the ones us. So
the idea would be that you would,

2380
02:16:04,110 --> 02:16:07,320
we would all profit from it and they
would make substantially less than they

2381
02:16:07,321 --> 02:16:08,154
make now.

2382
02:16:08,400 --> 02:16:11,370
And then instead of these people making
billions and billions of dollars for

2383
02:16:11,371 --> 02:16:12,990
something that's not even theirs. Yeah.

2384
02:16:13,230 --> 02:16:17,610
Like that profit would be split
evenly around the country in terms of

2385
02:16:17,611 --> 02:16:22,611
infrastructure and replenishing
impoverished communities
and community centers

2386
02:16:22,801 --> 02:16:26,220
and trying to figure out a way to engineer
out all the horrific neighborhoods.

2387
02:16:26,500 --> 02:16:30,160
Use the natural resources.
Yes. I mean that would be

2388
02:16:30,220 --> 02:16:33,160
wonderful. They've had to
pay some people for fracking.

2389
02:16:33,490 --> 02:16:36,580
They've had to pay some people off
because they just ruined their, their,

2390
02:16:36,670 --> 02:16:37,503
their neighborhood.

2391
02:16:37,750 --> 02:16:41,230
Like there's people that live in
places like fully toxic now. Yes.

2392
02:16:42,010 --> 02:16:44,200
What do you have, Jamie?
I saw this the other day.

2393
02:16:44,201 --> 02:16:49,201
This is from the original spill and
2004 it's been going on consistently.

2394
02:16:49,510 --> 02:16:50,560
Oh yeah. It's still leaking.

2395
02:16:50,590 --> 02:16:55,570
They said the 14 year old Gulf oil spill
is leaking up to 4,500 gallons a day.

2396
02:16:55,900 --> 02:16:58,890
They found that it was
many, many times more. Um,

2397
02:16:59,140 --> 02:17:02,350
oil was leaking out then when they
thought it was. So that's still,

2398
02:17:02,380 --> 02:17:06,190
that's going into the ocean right
now from that stupid oil pipeline.

2399
02:17:07,420 --> 02:17:11,170
Yeah. The quicker that someone
figures out the alternative energy,

2400
02:17:11,510 --> 02:17:14,020
that's kind of what I'm saying.
It's like the, it needs to happen.

2401
02:17:14,021 --> 02:17:15,760
This is ridiculous. It's just, it's,

2402
02:17:15,761 --> 02:17:19,450
everyone's doing the easy thing right
now and it's just feeding the, again,

2403
02:17:20,400 --> 02:17:25,210
the capitalist mission machine
is just like, no, that's okay.

2404
02:17:25,210 --> 02:17:26,290
That's acceptable. Well,

2405
02:17:26,291 --> 02:17:29,620
you and I have righteous virtue because
we drive electric vehicles occasionally.

2406
02:17:30,830 --> 02:17:32,950
That's true. I do feel
a little bit better.

2407
02:17:33,130 --> 02:17:34,840
I feel better than people
when I drive my Tesla.

2408
02:17:35,260 --> 02:17:38,380
You assholes poisoning
the world, you know?

2409
02:17:38,381 --> 02:17:43,381
I feel I only feel better driving my
Tesla only in that it's just faster.

2410
02:17:45,160 --> 02:17:49,690
It's just faster than almost everything
on the road. It's like time machine.

2411
02:17:49,720 --> 02:17:51,280
That's the at. That's
exactly what I call it.

2412
02:17:51,281 --> 02:17:55,780
I always say like if there's a location
that I want to go to, I appear there.

2413
02:17:56,270 --> 02:18:01,250
I don't go June over there. It's
just like, and you have the 100 d,

2414
02:18:01,270 --> 02:18:04,840
which is the one I have, which
is the two monster one phrase.

2415
02:18:05,420 --> 02:18:08,830
Meanwhile that fucking new thing that
they're coming out with that the roaster.

2416
02:18:08,890 --> 02:18:13,780
I really want to get my second faster.
Zero to 60. Yeah. It's how well one,

2417
02:18:13,810 --> 02:18:17,260
1.9, 1.8 theoretically 1.8 seconds here.

2418
02:18:17,680 --> 02:18:20,440
the 60s changed his uh, his take on that.

2419
02:18:20,470 --> 02:18:23,860
I think he recently said it's
2.1 are you serious? Yes. Okay.

2420
02:18:23,861 --> 02:18:25,600
Who were very disciplined very this way.

2421
02:18:25,750 --> 02:18:29,200
Cause you got to break the two barriers.
What kind of nonsense is this? I know.

2422
02:18:29,290 --> 02:18:32,320
Where's my point? Where's my 10th
of a second? Ain't going to matter.

2423
02:18:32,321 --> 02:18:35,740
Kids fucking thing's ridiculous.
Kidding. It's just a fucking weapon.

2424
02:18:36,650 --> 02:18:40,540
It's insane. But it also has 600
mile range. Yes. That's what I heard.

2425
02:18:40,541 --> 02:18:43,300
Which is just insane to me. I
just love that it's a Tinier car.

2426
02:18:43,720 --> 02:18:45,730
It's like the fastest thing ever.

2427
02:18:46,090 --> 02:18:49,930
There's only going to be maybe three
other road legal cars that you could buy

2428
02:18:49,931 --> 02:18:52,420
that would get to that,
that level one car at night.

2429
02:18:52,490 --> 02:18:55,540
They're going to look obsolete compared
to that though. Oh yeah. I mean, well,

2430
02:18:55,570 --> 02:18:59,090
the thing I'm excited about is
dependent Farina Electric car. Ooh.

2431
02:18:59,920 --> 02:19:03,430
All designed completely in house.
And I don't know when it comes out,

2432
02:19:03,431 --> 02:19:07,390
but I don't know if you find a picture
of it. It is the nastiest piece of tech.

2433
02:19:08,200 --> 02:19:11,800
Don't let the Italians make the engine
though. Trust. Yeah, I don't think so.

2434
02:19:11,801 --> 02:19:16,000
I think they're leveraging like,
ah, let my people design things.

2435
02:19:16,001 --> 02:19:19,390
You let them design the way
it looks, but all the wires,

2436
02:19:19,391 --> 02:19:23,080
they're barely paying attention.
Standard Girls Asses Heaton Spaghetti.

2437
02:19:24,670 --> 02:19:27,980
I guarantee you. That's
so funny. That's so true.

2438
02:19:28,190 --> 02:19:32,510
You like Germans and Japanese
make reliable cars. Yes.

2439
02:19:32,570 --> 02:19:37,100
They make their engineers
out there get that woo. Damn.

2440
02:19:37,520 --> 02:19:41,960
That is a Goddamn Batmobile. Yeah.
She'd be nasty. Wow. That's a real car.

2441
02:19:41,990 --> 02:19:46,490
Oh yeah. When's that coming out? Um, I
think orders are happening. There you go.

2442
02:19:46,550 --> 02:19:50,670
That's like 5 million. Jesus.
That's it, right? Yeah.

2443
02:19:50,880 --> 02:19:53,810
Cause all this money coming active
eyras how many shakes are there?

2444
02:19:53,811 --> 02:19:56,210
I mean come on, look, get that fucking,

2445
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:59,510
and it borrows a little bit of like
Ferrari La Ferrari has little bit of

2446
02:19:59,511 --> 02:20:01,000
Japanese styling. It has a,

2447
02:20:01,370 --> 02:20:06,370
it's the perfect blend of like all the
good things about like tech looking car

2448
02:20:07,690 --> 02:20:11,000
and what it's like. It's
like a Ferrari four 88 yes.

2449
02:20:11,310 --> 02:20:16,310
That but one that fuck
1900 Lexus LFA oh yeah,

2450
02:20:16,770 --> 02:20:20,450
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, yeah, I
got that hundred 1900 how many Newton?

2451
02:20:20,880 --> 02:20:24,110
Uh, pounds of Torque. I don't
know what that is to say.

2452
02:20:24,500 --> 02:20:28,410
Whenever they say that Newton meters,
I don't get it. Those European ones.

2453
02:20:28,480 --> 02:20:30,110
And I'm like, what are you
saying? I don't feel that.

2454
02:20:30,111 --> 02:20:33,380
All I know is what is high.
And then I base it off of that.

2455
02:20:33,560 --> 02:20:37,200
It's funny too that we still use
horses. I know, I'm stupid as that.

2456
02:20:37,640 --> 02:20:40,130
I look at that I've seen is people
power less than two seconds.

2457
02:20:40,131 --> 02:20:43,580
So that's like the, but it's an
electric vehicle and I'm sure I'm,

2458
02:20:44,450 --> 02:20:48,860
Jeez biting has one coming out that looks
really cool. It was 180 miles an hour,

2459
02:20:48,870 --> 02:20:53,250
186 miles an hour and 12
seconds. She says, Chris,

2460
02:20:53,540 --> 02:20:56,690
so 12 seconds later you're
going to 186 miles an hour.

2461
02:20:57,530 --> 02:21:00,860
[inaudible] control cockpit. Uh, that's
what I like about cars like that.

2462
02:21:00,861 --> 02:21:05,220
I liked that look amazing. It's a
fucking house in the hills. They know it.

2463
02:21:05,380 --> 02:21:08,940
The types in the hills. I'd get
it. Wow. If I could, I'd get it.

2464
02:21:08,990 --> 02:21:12,110
What'd you oh yeah, easily. I
definitely want to get the roads.

2465
02:21:12,111 --> 02:21:15,170
I'm thinking about the roadster. I'm
getting that bitch. You got to man.

2466
02:21:15,171 --> 02:21:17,420
Come on. Got To, I mean it's not that.

2467
02:21:17,421 --> 02:21:21,430
I mean for 250 grand you're getting
a car that like, that's, that's a,

2468
02:21:21,470 --> 02:21:23,630
what does that, what was it
again? To keep chilling us. Jamie,

2469
02:21:24,730 --> 02:21:28,940
you're just flipping through clothes
now. Check out Jamie's on a rabbit hole.

2470
02:21:29,110 --> 02:21:31,280
You went down the youtube
rabbit hole. Lotus was doing,

2471
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:36,500
what was the other one was roadster.
Oh yeah, that thinks about us.

2472
02:21:36,620 --> 02:21:40,440
What does the other one Rimac concept
to? Oh, I don't know what that, it's a,

2473
02:21:40,610 --> 02:21:43,600
I think there is downward handle
for the roadster. Oh yeah.

2474
02:21:43,640 --> 02:21:46,720
You slide your finger down.
Yeah. Tops. I mean who knows?

2475
02:21:46,900 --> 02:21:50,030
This is stranded in the pot. It's not,
it's not using that steering wheel.

2476
02:21:50,660 --> 02:21:53,180
I don't know why they do that.
They do that for concept cars.

2477
02:21:53,181 --> 02:21:56,540
That No side view mirrors, which now is
actually becoming legal, which is great.

2478
02:21:56,600 --> 02:22:00,890
Finally, No side view mirrors cause
it looks sexier. It looks more sleek.

2479
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:01,753
Does it really bother you?

2480
02:22:01,820 --> 02:22:05,600
That's like if you get a dude and the
girl is really hot but she has a chip

2481
02:22:05,601 --> 02:22:09,140
tooth. Oh go. No, no, no. That makes,
that makes, that makes it better.

2482
02:22:09,141 --> 02:22:13,370
That's like, that's character man.
That's beautiful. So why do you need a,

2483
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:16,700
why don't you want side mirrors? I want
to see it just creates a cleaner line.

2484
02:22:16,930 --> 02:22:19,820
Fuck a clean line. I want to see
what's going on. What have you die?

2485
02:22:19,850 --> 02:22:21,140
I want to see what's behind me, man. Well,

2486
02:22:21,141 --> 02:22:24,470
the new Honda all electric car
that's basically kind of like a,

2487
02:22:24,530 --> 02:22:29,280
like a kind of an eagle, but it's
a fully new car. It's got, uh,

2488
02:22:29,310 --> 02:22:31,350
it's got the camera system
with the side view mirrors.

2489
02:22:31,470 --> 02:22:33,660
They're just right on
the edge of the Dash,

2490
02:22:33,661 --> 02:22:36,780
right where the mirrors kind
of would be. And the guy,

2491
02:22:37,380 --> 02:22:38,820
the guy who was doing a review of it,

2492
02:22:38,821 --> 02:22:43,080
one of the few guys who's gotten to drive
it said that it just blows you away.

2493
02:22:43,110 --> 02:22:45,300
You're like, why haven't
cars been like this forever?

2494
02:22:45,301 --> 02:22:49,380
Because it gives you an accurate
fulltime view of what's going on.

2495
02:22:49,381 --> 02:22:54,060
And the rear view mirror is
also a screen. No pillars,

2496
02:22:54,120 --> 02:22:58,720
no pillars. What are you laughing? I make
fun of this car. What am I gonna Fuck?

2497
02:22:59,360 --> 02:23:03,930
No, go back to the hassle site. Looking
at us was only some Honda. It's cute.

2498
02:23:04,140 --> 02:23:08,190
E I like it. It's also got the
most ridiculous turning radius.

2499
02:23:08,430 --> 02:23:11,550
It's turns tighter than a
a London cab. Good. Yeah,

2500
02:23:11,740 --> 02:23:13,460
because it's got a stick
in the ground. Yeah.

2501
02:23:13,730 --> 02:23:17,130
Just it just plants the pole in the
ground and then it just rotates. Yeah.

2502
02:23:18,990 --> 02:23:22,950
Yeah. The road stairs is evil. I don't
think it's really gonna come out in 2020.

2503
02:23:22,951 --> 02:23:24,990
I don't think so either. I think
it's going to get pushed back,

2504
02:23:25,380 --> 02:23:29,460
but it's just such a gorgeous, it does
have some active Arrow, I think in the,

2505
02:23:29,550 --> 02:23:31,680
the spoilers active. It's cool looking.

2506
02:23:31,710 --> 02:23:35,910
It looks like what a car supposed
to look like in 2020. Exactly. Yes.

2507
02:23:35,940 --> 02:23:38,100
Reggie Watts. Let's wrap this
back. Way Up. Let's do it.

2508
02:23:38,640 --> 02:23:40,980
People want to follow you on
social media. Is that possible?

2509
02:23:41,610 --> 02:23:44,550
Only if they want to. And it said, um, uh,

2510
02:23:44,551 --> 02:23:47,820
Reggie Watts at Twitter and uh, Instagram.

2511
02:23:47,821 --> 02:23:51,780
It's Reggie watts and
sometimes Reggie watts.com.

2512
02:23:52,380 --> 02:23:55,310
That's about it. We gotta do this more
often for real. Let's do it. Yeah.

2513
02:23:55,320 --> 02:23:58,020
It's so much fun. Such a cool
journey, man. Really Fun. Really Fun.

2514
02:23:58,050 --> 02:24:01,800
Thanks for the awesome weed. Purple
Venom. Of course. Young Jamie.

2515
02:24:01,880 --> 02:24:03,570
I loot goodbye everybody.

2516
02:24:07,510 --> 02:24:09,390
Oh, that was good, man.
