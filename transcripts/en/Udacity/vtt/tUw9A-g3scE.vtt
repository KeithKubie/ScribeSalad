00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:02.320
Okay Michael, so let's see if we can, work

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.920
together to deal with this minor triffle of a problem,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:09.830
that ,ah, you've observed with my cooling algorithm, okay.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:13.640
So, here's some data, it's a graph and you see

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:15.760
here's a y axis and here's an x axis,

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:19.690
and each of these points, represents a house, on this

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.530
map, which I'm, I'm cleverly, using in the background. [CROSSTALK]

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.080
And, you'll notice, that each of the dots is colored.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.730
I'm going to say that red represents, really expensive houses, blue

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.050
represents, moderately expensive houses, and

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.600
green represents, really inexpensive houses. Okay?

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.350
&gt;&gt; Okay, where is this?

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.060
&gt;&gt; Where is this? Oh, this is Georgia Tech,

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.630
as you can tell because, it says Georgia Tech.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.270
&gt;&gt; Oh, I see it now.

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.960
&gt;&gt; Okay. So, here's what I want you to do. using machine learning.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.640
I want you to look at all of this data, and then

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.090
I want you to tell me, for these little black dots, whether they

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.470
are really expensive, moderately expensive or, or inexpensive. But ,I want you

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.040
to do it, using something like the technique that we talked about before.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.170
&gt;&gt; Okay?

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.140
&gt;&gt; So, let's look at this little dot, over here. Which,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.510
by the way, I want to point out. this little black

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.230
dot here by the US Post Office, underneath the rightmost ,e

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:16.500
,over here, is not a point in our data base. But

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.690
I think by staring at this, you might be able to come up

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.030
with a reasonable guess, about whether

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.700
it is moderately expensive, expensive, or inexpensive.

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:27.710
&gt;&gt; Okay, yeah. I think, this is a helpful, example, because, now I see

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.000
that it does kind of make sense, especially, in this context, to think of

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.110
the geometric location, as actually being a

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.230
very useful attribute for deciding how to

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.530
label the new points. So, that black point that you've pointed out, is in the

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.820
part of the neighborhood, that has a green dot

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.950
in it. Like, the nearest dot to it, seems like

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.620
a pretty good guess as to what, what the value

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.740
of that house might be, so I'm going to guess green.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.660
&gt;&gt; Yes, and I think ,you would be right. And I like the word that you

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.080
used there. You talked about, its nearest neighbor,

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.430
so I like that. I'm going to write that down.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.100
Neighbor, okay. So, I'm going to look at my

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.750
nearest neighbor. Well let's see if this works,

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.690
for another point. Let's look at another point,

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.580
that's near an, e, let's see, the first e

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.530
over here. This little black point, over here. What do you think? If I,

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.770
if I looked at my nearest neighbor, what would I, what would I guess?

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.060
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this one seems really clear. It's, it's

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.830
surrounded by red. It's in the red part of town.

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.908
&gt;&gt; So, you're guessing, the output is then, purple? [LAUGH]

00:02:22.908 --> 00:02:23.860
&gt;&gt; No, I'm going with red.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.800
&gt;&gt; Yes, and I think that that makes perfect sense. So, this is pretty

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.890
cool. If I have a point that's not in my database ,but, I still,

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.370
by looking at my nearest neighbour, can, sort of figure out ,ah,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.490
what the actual value should be. So, there we have solved, the problem.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.140
&gt;&gt; Yes, seems like a pretty good role.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.120
&gt;&gt; Yeah, just look at your nearest neighbour and you are

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.280
done. There, so, boom. There is nothing else for you to do.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, except that you didn't do all of the houses yet.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:52.570
&gt;&gt; Okay, well, what did I miss?

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.310
&gt;&gt; The one in the middle and [CROSSTALK]

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.030
I'm wondering, if maybe you did that on purpose,

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.500
because, this one has some issues.

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.310
&gt;&gt; What are its issues? Besides being too, near 10th Street?

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.990
&gt;&gt; well, yeah, apart from that it doesn't

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.240
really have any very close neighbors ,on the,

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.700
on the map. So the closest that you get, is, I don't know, maybe that red one?

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.370
&gt;&gt; Maybe.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.330
&gt;&gt; But I would be really, I'd be very wary

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.240
of just using that as my guess, because, it's also pretty

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.550
darn close to a bluepoint.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:24.160
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.160
&gt;&gt; And also not so, far from the green point.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:31.310
&gt;&gt; That's a good point. So, this whole nearest neighbor thing

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.120
doesn't quite work, in this case when you got a bunch

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.600
of neighbors that are saying different things. And they are kind

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.190
of close to you. So, any clever way we might around this?

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.240
&gt;&gt; I would say, move the black dot, to,

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.570
&gt;&gt; No, no, no, no, we are not allowed that before.

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.410
&gt;&gt; No? Okay, right it

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.920
seems, it seems, like it would be helpful.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.730
&gt;&gt; No, no, they are federal laws ,against interesting.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:55.870
&gt;&gt; I was going to say, yeah, so, alright So, short of

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.270
that, maybe ,we just need to look at a bigger context?

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:02.960
&gt;&gt; Ahh, that makes sense. So, you're saying my little nearest neighbor

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.535
thing, sort of worked ,but the problem was I started out with examples

00:04:06.535 --> 00:04:10.800
,that were, you know, very clearly in a neighborhood, and now I'm

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.440
in a place where I'm not so sure about the neighborhood, so I

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.770
should let I should look at more of my neighbors, than just the closest one.
