00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.120
Dating can be a *delicate* dance

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.620
One wrong move, and your partner can swing away from you

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:47.420
This is why relationships aren't fairytales

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.400
and require a large degree of work to sustain them.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.860
When you're with the right person,

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.000
they're *always* worth it though.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.600
But no matter how much we want to love our partners better

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.240
We may not always understand where to start.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.440
Highly Sensitive People, for instance-

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.100
face many challenges in the realm of dating.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.020
Because their partners don't always know how to approach them

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.840
Whether you've been dating your HSP for a while now,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.060
OR you're just getting started,

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.340
Here are five tip for dating a highly sensitive person.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.120
Number One:

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.040
Don't pressure or make them feel rushed

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.040
HSP prefer to think things through carefully,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.860
before making a decision.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.580
Instead of quickly jumping into a situation,

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.580
they would rather analyze and observe on the sidelines

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.240
before making a commitment.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.020
This is why they don't like to feel pressured or rushed.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.500
They care a lot about how their actions affect others.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.680
Which is what makes them such great and loyal partners

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.840
Once they've chosen to commit to you,

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.500
they take your relationship seriously.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.220
Number Two:

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.080
Respect their need for space &amp; time to be alone

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:02.360
If your partner needs to recharge

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.000
try not to take it personally.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.020
They aren't doing it to ignore you,

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.420
but because it helps them function as a person.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.440
RESPECT your partner's need for space.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.960
In fact, the only way your partner to be at their best

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.940
is when they aren't overwhelmed or over-stimulated.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.840
If you'd like to understand your partner's habits more,

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.020
check out our video, 8 Signs You're a HSP

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.800
Number Three:

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.120
Understand that conflict makes them uncomfortable.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.880
Disagreements are normal in relationships,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.080
Because you and your partner are welcome to have different opinions,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.500
but when your partner is highly sensitive,

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.280
it's important to be mindful of how conflict makes them feel.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.100
HSP *dont* enjoy fighting

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.140
because they find it distressing and overly stimulating.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.580
To reduce conflict, try not to fight

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.340
You don't have to act like robots or

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.400
pretend everything is fine when you experience problems,

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.620
but emotions often distract us from resolving them.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.720
One way to minimize fighting is to

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.420
give each other signals or warnings

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.220
*before* things get out of hand.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.000
Number Four:

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.040
When doing activies together,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.140
choose less stimulating environments.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:15.060
HSP don't like being in loud, overcrowded places.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.160
They may go to parties to catch up with friends,

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.180
or be supportive of weddings and birthdays,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.400
but they prefer to leave early,

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.200
when they start to feel drained.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.960
To reduce your partner's stress,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:27.200
bring them to peaceful environments like-

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.820
the beach when it isn't crowded,

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.080
a hike in the woods,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.760
or a quiet coffee shop.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.520
Number Five:

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.920
Reach out frequently

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.520
and ASK them how they're doing.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.180
According to Elaine Aron,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.300
researcher of highly sensitive people,

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.080
she discovered a trait they all have that she refers to as

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.900
Mate Sensitivity.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:49.280
Mate sensitivity is the ability to understand what pleases your partner.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.220
HSP are *great* at knowing what to say and do

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.480
to make their partner feel loved and appreciated.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.680
But it's important to be receptive

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.560
and return the same gestures of love

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.600
Be considerate,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.840
and make sure your partners needs are being met too.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.740
Are you dating a highly sensitive person?

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:11.740
