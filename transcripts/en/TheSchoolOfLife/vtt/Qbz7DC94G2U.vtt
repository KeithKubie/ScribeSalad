00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:07.490
One of the most obvious but striking things
about a modern education is that you go through

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.250
it only once. You show up every day for a
number of years, get filled up with knowledge

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.180
and then, once you’re twenty-one or so,
you stop – and begin the rest of your life.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.759
Before modern education took off, the mightiest
educational systems in the world were religions.

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:31.160
It was religions that taught us about ethics,
purpose and the meaning of life. And one of

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.149
the interesting aspects of their pedagogy
was that they were obsessed with repetition.

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:43.300
For them, it was absurd to imagine ever learning
anything if you went through it only once.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.000
The whole basis of religious education rested
upon repetition. Five times a day, as a Muslim

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.489
one was to rehearse the central tenets of
Islam; seven times a day as a Christian Benedictine

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:01.790
monk, one was to revisit the lessons of scripture.
As an orthodox Jew, 300 days a year were marked

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:07.770
out for commemoration and ritual repetition
of ideas in the Torah, while as a Zen priest,

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.900
one would be inducted to sit cross-legged
and meditate up to twelve times between daybreak

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.360
and nightfall. Religions had what one might
term a sieve view of the mind: that anything

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.680
one pours in will quickly be lost in our perforated
memories. By contrast, modern education adheres

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.930
to an implicitly bucket-like theory of the
mind: one pours in the contents and, bar accidents,

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.970
they’ll stay there pretty much across a
life-time. That’s why we’ll think nothing

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:45.091
of earnestly declaring a book a favourite
– and deigning to read it only once. Far

00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:51.170
less naively and far more generously, religions
prefer to imagine that anything you tell someone

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.440
in the morning will, by two in the afternoon,
be well on the way to evaporation and will

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.840
be pretty much gone by nightfall. Repetition
is the only way of ensuring that something

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.360
will stick. Once you’ve finished reading
a favourite holy text, the story of Moses

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.040
for example, you head straight back to the
beginning and start again, with the bull rushes

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.459
and the baby infant. We pay a heavy price
for our lack of interest in rehearsing lessons

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:24.090
and ideas. There are all kinds of things we
badly need to keep in our minds: the better

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.790
parts of our nature that speak to us of being
patient, of remaining gentle, of striving

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.239
for forgiveness, of pausing to appreciate,
of straining to understand what at first seems

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:40.940
unbearably foreign… We’ve been taught
these things once, of course. But it was a

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.159
while ago now. Possibly when we were seven.
And so, naturally, they’re not at the front

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.760
of our minds as we career through our lives,
smashing into things and people, raging and

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.099
blaming, slandering and hating. There’s
equal, and possibly far greater wisdom to

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:59.299
be found in the secular as opposed to the
religious sphere, but those who dispense it

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:04.139
are far too hopeful about the functioning
of our minds. They choose to tell us just

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:09.099
once, possibly in quite a low voice, about
all the things that matter; maybe in a beautiful

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:14.650
but very dense poem or in quite a slow moving
novel we once read fitfully over a summer

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:20.390
two decades ago. And then they expect us to
keep it all in mind our whole lives long – and

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.120
we’re surprised that the march of human
craziness goes on unabated. We should not

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:31.500
abandon our most precious insights to the
lax guardians of our memories. We need to

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.840
steal the idea of repetition from religions
– and create our own catechisms, our own

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.530
midnight prayers, our own cycles of rehearsed
knowledge. We need to make the most important

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.930
ideas vivid in our minds on a constant basis.
We should never be done with school. We should

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.790
daily be re-immersed in the great truths:
that we will die, that we must understand

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:59.279
ourselves, that we must love, that others
are sad rather than mean… Many of us are

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:04.640
done with religion; but we shouldn’t be
done with what religions knew so well of our

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.560
minds: that nothing stays active in them,
unless we rehearse and repeat with every new

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:16.320
dawn. We need to keep coming back – Not
least: here.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.440
At The School Of Life we believe in developing emotional intelligence.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.720
To that end we have also created a whole range of products to support that growth.
