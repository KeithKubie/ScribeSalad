00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:01.605
- [Voiceover] So what I
want to do in this video

00:00:01.605 --> 00:00:05.064
is familiarize ourselves with
the second derivative test

00:00:05.064 --> 00:00:07.735
and before I even get into
the nitty-gritty of it,

00:00:07.735 --> 00:00:09.363
I really just want to
get an intuitive feel

00:00:09.363 --> 00:00:11.660
for what the second
derivative test is telling us.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.577
So let me just draw some axes here.

00:00:15.452 --> 00:00:20.258
So let's say that's my y-axis,
let's say this is my x-axis

00:00:20.258 --> 00:00:22.822
and let's say I have a function that has

00:00:22.822 --> 00:00:26.072
a relative maximum value at X equals C.

00:00:27.148 --> 00:00:29.257
So let's say we have a situation

00:00:29.257 --> 00:00:31.206
that looks something like that

00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:33.623
and X equals C is right over,

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.336
so that's the point C, F of C.

00:00:38.336 --> 00:00:42.502
So if I can draw a straighter dotted line.

00:00:42.502 --> 00:00:44.919
So that is X being equal to C

00:00:46.667 --> 00:00:51.073
and we visually see that we
have a local maximum point there

00:00:51.073 --> 00:00:53.156
and we can use our calculus tools

00:00:53.156 --> 00:00:54.945
to think about what's going on there.

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:56.761
Well one thing that we know,

00:00:56.761 --> 00:01:00.179
we know that the slope
of the tangent line,

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:01.942
at least the way I've
drawn it right over here,

00:01:01.942 --> 00:01:03.624
is equal to zero.

00:01:03.624 --> 00:01:07.374
So we could say F prime
of C is equal to zero

00:01:08.884 --> 00:01:10.300
and the other thing we can see

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.222
is that we are concave downward

00:01:12.222 --> 00:01:15.373
in the neighborhood around X equals C.

00:01:15.373 --> 00:01:18.471
So notice our slope is
constantly decreasing

00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:21.542
and since your slope,
notice it's positive,

00:01:21.542 --> 00:01:23.277
it's less positive, even less positive,

00:01:23.277 --> 00:01:25.227
it goes to zero, then it becomes negative,

00:01:25.227 --> 00:01:27.443
more negative and even more negative.

00:01:27.443 --> 00:01:29.943
So we know that F prime prime,

00:01:31.288 --> 00:01:33.871
we know that F prime prime of C

00:01:36.463 --> 00:01:38.551
is less than zero

00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:42.475
and so I haven't done any
deep mathematical proof here,

00:01:42.475 --> 00:01:46.225
but if I have a critical
point at X equals C,

00:01:48.587 --> 00:01:51.618
so F prime of C is equal to zero,

00:01:51.618 --> 00:01:54.288
and we also see that the
second derivative there

00:01:54.288 --> 00:01:55.650
is less than zero.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:56.958
Well intuitively this makes sense

00:01:56.958 --> 00:01:59.094
that we are at a maximum value

00:01:59.094 --> 00:02:00.697
and we could go the other way

00:02:00.697 --> 00:02:04.697
if we are at a local
minimum point at X equals C

00:02:07.212 --> 00:02:09.215
or relative minimum point.

00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:13.382
So our first derivative
should still be equal to zero

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:16.585
'cause our slope of a
tangent line right over there

00:02:16.585 --> 00:02:17.840
is still zero.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.590
So F prime of C is equal to zero.

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:25.290
But in this second situation,
we are concave upwards.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.922
The slope is constantly increasing.

00:02:28.922 --> 00:02:30.631
We have an upward opening bowl

00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:33.764
and so here we have a
relative minimum value

00:02:33.764 --> 00:02:38.344
or we could say our second
derivative is greater than zero.

00:02:38.344 --> 00:02:40.881
Visually we see it's a
relative minimum value

00:02:40.881 --> 00:02:42.616
and we can tell just
looking at our derivatives,

00:02:42.616 --> 00:02:43.734
at least the way I've drawn it,

00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:45.523
first derivative is equal to zero

00:02:45.523 --> 00:02:47.018
and we are concave upwards.

00:02:47.018 --> 00:02:49.048
Second derivative is greater than zero.

00:02:49.048 --> 00:02:51.451
And so this intuition that
we hopefully just built up

00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:54.388
is what the second
derivative test tells us.

00:02:54.388 --> 00:02:57.379
So it says hey look, if we're
dealing with some function F,

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:00.183
let's say it's a twice
differentiable function.

00:03:00.183 --> 00:03:02.186
So that means that over some interval.

00:03:02.186 --> 00:03:04.478
So that means that you
could find its first

00:03:04.478 --> 00:03:06.214
and second derivatives are defined

00:03:06.214 --> 00:03:08.270
and so let's say there's
some point, X equals C,

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.421
where its first derivative
is equal to zero,

00:03:11.421 --> 00:03:14.145
so the slope of the tangent
line is equal to zero,

00:03:14.145 --> 00:03:17.029
and the derivative exists
in a neighborhood around C

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.898
and most of the functions we deal with,

00:03:18.898 --> 00:03:19.939
if it's differentiable at C,

00:03:19.939 --> 00:03:23.117
it tends to be differentiable
in the neighborhood around C

00:03:23.117 --> 00:03:25.173
and then we also assume that
second derivative exists

00:03:25.173 --> 00:03:26.695
is twice differentiable.

00:03:26.695 --> 00:03:30.300
Well then we might be
dealing with a maximum point,

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.036
we might be dealing with a minimum point,

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:34.279
or we might not know
what we're dealing with

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:38.076
and it might be neither a
minimum or a maximum point.

00:03:38.076 --> 00:03:39.772
But using the second derivative test,

00:03:39.772 --> 00:03:42.068
if we take the second
derivative and if we see that

00:03:42.068 --> 00:03:45.807
the second derivative is
indeed less than zero,

00:03:45.807 --> 00:03:48.584
then we have a relative maximum point.

00:03:48.584 --> 00:03:51.251
Then so this is a situation that

00:03:52.598 --> 00:03:54.321
we started with right up there.

00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:57.926
If our second derivative
is greater than zero,

00:03:57.926 --> 00:03:59.768
then we are in this situation right here,

00:03:59.768 --> 00:04:01.290
we're concave upwards.

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.667
Where the slope is zero,
that's the bottom of the bowl.

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:06.097
We have a relative minimum point

00:04:06.097 --> 00:04:09.168
and if our second derivative
is zero, it's inconclusive.

00:04:09.168 --> 00:04:12.319
We don't know what is actually
going on at that point.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.508
We can't make any strong statement.

00:04:14.508 --> 00:04:16.351
So with that out of the way,
let's just do a quick example

00:04:16.351 --> 00:04:18.647
just to see if this has gelled.

00:04:18.647 --> 00:04:22.172
Let's say that I have some
twice differentiable function H

00:04:22.172 --> 00:04:23.481
and let's say that I tell you that

00:04:23.481 --> 00:04:25.814
H of eight is equal to five,

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:31.546
I tell you that H prime
of eight is equal to zero,

00:04:32.586 --> 00:04:34.883
and I tell you that the second derivative

00:04:34.883 --> 00:04:38.888
at X equals eight is
equal to negative four.

00:04:38.888 --> 00:04:42.493
So given this, can you tell me whether

00:04:42.493 --> 00:04:46.660
the point eight comma five,
so the point eight comma five,

00:04:47.593 --> 00:04:49.676
is it a relative minimum,

00:04:52.953 --> 00:04:55.536
relative minimum, maximum point

00:04:57.653 --> 00:04:59.976
or not enough info?

00:04:59.976 --> 00:05:02.643
Not enough info or inconclusive?

00:05:04.996 --> 00:05:06.011
And like always, pause the video

00:05:06.011 --> 00:05:08.040
and see if you can figure it out.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.829
Well we're assuming it's
twice differentiable

00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:11.761
and I think it's safe to assume that

00:05:11.761 --> 00:05:13.297
and for the sake of our problem

00:05:13.297 --> 00:05:15.059
we're gonna assume that
the derivative exists

00:05:15.059 --> 00:05:17.489
in a neighborhood around X equals eight.

00:05:17.489 --> 00:05:19.438
So in this example, C is eight.

00:05:19.438 --> 00:05:23.604
So point eight five is
definitely on the curve.

00:05:23.604 --> 00:05:24.992
The derivative is equal to zero.

00:05:24.992 --> 00:05:27.930
So we're dealing potentially
with one of these scenarios

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.508
and our second derivative
is less than zero.

00:05:31.508 --> 00:05:33.537
Second derivative is less than zero.

00:05:33.537 --> 00:05:35.273
So this threw us.

00:05:35.273 --> 00:05:37.570
So the fact that the second derivative,

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:41.602
so H prime prime of
eight is less than zero,

00:05:41.602 --> 00:05:45.340
tells us that we fall into
this situation right over here.

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.717
So just with the information
they've given us,

00:05:47.717 --> 00:05:50.440
we can say that at the
point eight comma five

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.107
we have a relative maximum value

00:05:54.019 --> 00:05:57.730
or that this is a relative
maximum point for this.

00:05:57.730 --> 00:06:00.774
If somehow they told us the
second derivative was zero,

00:06:00.774 --> 00:06:02.296
then we would say it's inconclusive.

00:06:02.296 --> 00:06:03.819
If they told us and
that's all they told us

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:04.833
and if they told us the second derivative

00:06:04.833 --> 00:06:07.610
is greater than zero,
then we would be dealing

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.610
with a relative minimum
value at X equals eight.
