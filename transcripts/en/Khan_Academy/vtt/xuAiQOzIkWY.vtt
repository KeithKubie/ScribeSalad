00:00:00.184 --> 00:00:01.722
- [Instructor] What we're
going to do in this video

00:00:01.722 --> 00:00:05.889
is explore the notion of
differentiability at a point.

00:00:07.489 --> 00:00:10.491
And that is just a fancy way of saying

00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:14.433
does the function have a
defined derivative at a point?

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:18.292
So let's just remind ourselves
a definition of a derivative.

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:20.405
And there's multiple ways of writing this.

00:00:20.405 --> 00:00:22.548
For the sake of this
video, I'll write it as

00:00:22.548 --> 00:00:25.396
the derivative of our function at point C,

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:27.919
this is Lagrange notation
with this F prime.

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:31.246
The derivative of our function
F at C is going to be equal

00:00:31.246 --> 00:00:33.746
to the limit as X approaches Z

00:00:35.474 --> 00:00:37.474
of F of X, minus F of C,

00:00:40.425 --> 00:00:41.675
over X minus C.

00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:45.459
And at first when you see this formula,

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:47.978
and we've seen it before, it
looks a little bit strange,

00:00:47.978 --> 00:00:51.184
but all it is is it's
calculating the slope,

00:00:51.184 --> 00:00:53.297
this is our change in the
value of our function,

00:00:53.297 --> 00:00:55.086
or you could think of
it as our change in Y,

00:00:55.086 --> 00:00:58.293
if Y is equal to F of X,
and this is our change in X.

00:00:58.293 --> 00:01:00.966
And we're just trying to
see, well, what is that slope

00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:04.536
as X gets closer and closer
to C, as our change in X

00:01:04.536 --> 00:01:06.286
gets closer and closer to zero?

00:01:06.286 --> 00:01:08.734
And we talk about that in other videos.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.013
So I'm now going to make a
few claims in this video,

00:01:11.013 --> 00:01:12.639
and I'm not going to
prove them rigorously.

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:14.953
There's another video that
will go a little bit more

00:01:14.953 --> 00:01:16.492
into the proof direction.

00:01:16.492 --> 00:01:18.645
But this is more to get an intuition.

00:01:18.645 --> 00:01:21.573
And so the first claim
that I'm going to make

00:01:21.573 --> 00:01:23.740
is if F is differentiable,

00:01:27.537 --> 00:01:28.704
at X equals C,

00:01:31.455 --> 00:01:32.622
at X equals C,

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.597
then F is continuous

00:01:39.103 --> 00:01:40.270
at X equals C.

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:44.261
So I'm saying if we know
it's differentiable,

00:01:44.261 --> 00:01:45.845
if we can find this limit,

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:48.808
if we can find this
derivative at X equals C,

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:51.814
then our function is also
continuous at X equals C.

00:01:51.814 --> 00:01:53.726
It doesn't necessarily
mean the other way around,

00:01:53.726 --> 00:01:55.280
and actually we'll look
at a case where it's not

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.873
necessarily the case the
other way around that

00:01:56.873 --> 00:01:59.836
if you're continuous, then
you're definitely differentiable.

00:01:59.836 --> 00:02:03.120
But another way to interpret
what I just wrote down is,

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.312
if you are not continuous,
then you definitely

00:02:05.312 --> 00:02:07.178
will not be differentiable.

00:02:07.178 --> 00:02:08.761
If F not continuous

00:02:12.303 --> 00:02:14.053
at X equals C, then F

00:02:18.126 --> 00:02:19.959
is not differentiable,

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.243
differentiable at X is equal to C.

00:02:28.886 --> 00:02:33.312
So let me give a few examples
of a non-continuous function

00:02:33.312 --> 00:02:37.573
and then think about would we
be able to find this limit.

00:02:37.573 --> 00:02:40.946
So the first is where
you have a discontinuity.

00:02:40.946 --> 00:02:44.080
Our function is defined at
C, it's equal to this value,

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.514
but you can see as X
becomes larger than C,

00:02:46.514 --> 00:02:49.395
it just jumps down and
shifts right over here.

00:02:49.395 --> 00:02:52.604
So what would happen if you
were trying to find this limit?

00:02:52.604 --> 00:02:54.925
Well, remember, all this
is is a slope of a line

00:02:54.925 --> 00:02:57.850
between when X is some arbitrary value,

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.289
let's say it's out here,
so that would be X,

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:03.539
this would be the point X comma F of X,

00:03:04.508 --> 00:03:08.675
and then this is the point C
comma F of C right over here.

00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:12.038
So this is C comma F of C.

00:03:14.542 --> 00:03:18.523
So if you find the left side
of the limit right over here,

00:03:18.523 --> 00:03:21.447
you're essentially saying
okay, let's find this slope.

00:03:21.447 --> 00:03:23.757
And then let me get a little bit closer,

00:03:23.757 --> 00:03:25.703
and let's get X a little bit closer

00:03:25.703 --> 00:03:27.164
and then let's find this slope.

00:03:27.164 --> 00:03:30.127
And then let's get X even closer than that

00:03:30.127 --> 00:03:31.829
and find this slope.

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.422
And in all of those
cases, it would be zero.

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:35.926
The slope is zero.

00:03:35.926 --> 00:03:38.810
So one way to think about it,
the derivative or this limit

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.629
as we approach from the left,
seems to be approaching zero.

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:46.049
But what about if we were
to take Xs to the right?

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:48.211
So instead of our Xs being there,

00:03:48.211 --> 00:03:52.397
what if we were to take
Xs right over here?

00:03:52.397 --> 00:03:55.480
Well, for this point, X comma F of X,

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:01.700
our slope, if we take F of X minus F of C

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.867
over X minus C, that would
be the slope of this line.

00:04:07.782 --> 00:04:10.948
If we get X to be even closer,
let's say right over here,

00:04:10.948 --> 00:04:14.448
then this would be the slope of this line.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.134
If we get even closer,
then this expression

00:04:18.134 --> 00:04:21.017
would be the slope of this line.

00:04:21.017 --> 00:04:25.184
And so as we get closer and
closer to X being equal to C,

00:04:26.213 --> 00:04:28.288
we see that our slope is actually

00:04:28.288 --> 00:04:30.158
approaching negative infinity.

00:04:30.158 --> 00:04:32.064
And most importantly, it's approaching

00:04:32.064 --> 00:04:34.382
a very different value from the right.

00:04:34.382 --> 00:04:36.535
This expression is approaching
a very different value

00:04:36.535 --> 00:04:39.868
from the right as it is from the left.

00:04:39.868 --> 00:04:44.664
And so in this case, this
limit up here won't exist.

00:04:44.664 --> 00:04:48.883
So we can clearly say this
is not differentiable.

00:04:48.883 --> 00:04:51.887
So once again, not a proof here.

00:04:51.887 --> 00:04:53.886
I'm just getting an
intuition for if something

00:04:53.886 --> 00:04:57.625
isn't continuous, it's pretty
clear, at least in this case,

00:04:57.625 --> 00:04:58.926
that it's not going to be differentiable.

00:04:58.926 --> 00:05:00.716
Let's look at another case.

00:05:00.716 --> 00:05:04.734
Let's look at a case where we
have what's sometimes called

00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:08.470
a removable discontinuity
or a point discontinuity.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.683
So once again, let's say we're
approaching from the left.

00:05:11.683 --> 00:05:15.350
This is X, this is the
point X comma F of X.

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.632
Now what's interesting is
where as this expression

00:05:21.632 --> 00:05:25.573
is the slope of the line
connecting X comma F of X

00:05:25.573 --> 00:05:29.392
and C comma F of C, which is
this point, not that point,

00:05:29.392 --> 00:05:30.349
remember we have this removable

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.261
discontinuity right over here,

00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:34.740
and so this would be this
expression is calculating

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.657
the slope of that line.

00:05:38.115 --> 00:05:40.794
And then if X gets even closer
to C, well, then we're gonna

00:05:40.794 --> 00:05:42.507
be calculating the slope of that line.

00:05:42.507 --> 00:05:44.251
If X gets even closer to C,
we're gonna be calculating

00:05:44.251 --> 00:05:45.834
the slope of that line.

00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:49.001
And so as we approach from
the left, as X approaches C

00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:51.314
from the left, we
actually have a situation

00:05:51.314 --> 00:05:53.667
where this expression
right over here is going

00:05:53.667 --> 00:05:55.704
to approach negative infinity.

00:05:55.704 --> 00:05:57.938
And if we approach from
the right, if we approach

00:05:57.938 --> 00:06:02.250
with Xs larger than C, well,
this is our X comma F of X,

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.052
so we have a positive slope
and then as we get closer,

00:06:05.052 --> 00:06:07.077
it gets more positive, more positive

00:06:07.077 --> 00:06:08.866
approaches positive infinity.

00:06:08.866 --> 00:06:11.337
But either way, it's not
approaching a finite value.

00:06:11.337 --> 00:06:13.084
And one side is approaching
positive infinity,

00:06:13.084 --> 00:06:14.864
and the other side is
approaching negative infinity.

00:06:14.864 --> 00:06:19.654
This, the limit of this
expression, is not going to exist.

00:06:19.654 --> 00:06:22.118
So once again, I'm not
doing a rigorous proof here,

00:06:22.118 --> 00:06:24.559
but try to construct a
discontinuous function

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:26.389
where you will be able to find this.

00:06:26.389 --> 00:06:28.095
It is very, very hard.

00:06:28.095 --> 00:06:29.435
And you might say, well,
what about the situations

00:06:29.435 --> 00:06:32.685
where F is not even defined
at C, which for sure

00:06:32.685 --> 00:06:35.568
you're not gonna be continuous
if F is not defined at C.

00:06:35.568 --> 00:06:38.946
Well if F is not defined
at C, then this part

00:06:38.946 --> 00:06:40.527
of the expression
wouldn't even make sense,

00:06:40.527 --> 00:06:43.208
so you definitely wouldn't
be differentiable.

00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:45.000
But now let's ask another thing.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.120
I've just given you good
arguments for when you're

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.654
not continuous, you're not
going to be differentiable,

00:06:50.654 --> 00:06:53.659
but can we make another claim
that if you are continuous,

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:56.536
then you definitely
will be differentiable?

00:06:56.536 --> 00:06:59.420
Well, it turns out that there are for sure

00:06:59.420 --> 00:07:01.896
many functions, an infinite
number of functions,

00:07:01.896 --> 00:07:06.083
that can be continuous at
C, but not differentiable.

00:07:06.083 --> 00:07:09.414
So for example, this could be
an absolute value function.

00:07:09.414 --> 00:07:10.917
It doesn't have to be an
absolute value function,

00:07:10.917 --> 00:07:12.799
but this could be Y is equal to

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:16.243
the absolute value of X minus C.

00:07:16.243 --> 00:07:20.393
And why is this one not
differentiable at C?

00:07:20.393 --> 00:07:21.693
Well, think about what's happening.

00:07:21.693 --> 00:07:22.585
Think about this expression.

00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:25.596
Remember, this expression
all it's doing is calculating

00:07:25.596 --> 00:07:28.482
the slope between the point X comma F of X

00:07:28.482 --> 00:07:30.675
and the point C comma F of C.

00:07:30.675 --> 00:07:34.842
So if X is, say, out here,
this is X comma F of X,

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.974
it's going to be calculated,
so if we take the limit

00:07:38.974 --> 00:07:42.221
as X approaches C from the left,

00:07:42.221 --> 00:07:44.778
we'll be looking at this slope.

00:07:44.778 --> 00:07:46.937
And as we get closer, we'll
be looking at this slope

00:07:46.937 --> 00:07:48.318
which is actually going to be the same.

00:07:48.318 --> 00:07:50.430
In this case it would be a negative one.

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.463
So as X approaches C from the left,

00:07:52.463 --> 00:07:54.898
this expression would be negative one.

00:07:54.898 --> 00:07:58.362
But as X approaches C from the right,

00:07:58.362 --> 00:08:00.798
this expression is going to be one.

00:08:00.798 --> 00:08:03.191
The slope of the line that
connects these points is one.

00:08:03.191 --> 00:08:05.663
The slope of the line that
connects these points is one.

00:08:05.663 --> 00:08:09.071
So the limit of this expression,
or I would say the value

00:08:09.071 --> 00:08:11.869
of this expression, is
approaching two different values

00:08:11.869 --> 00:08:14.348
as X approaches C from
the left or the right.

00:08:14.348 --> 00:08:16.501
From the left, it's
approaching negative one,

00:08:16.501 --> 00:08:19.065
or it's constantly negative
one and so it's approaching

00:08:19.065 --> 00:08:20.527
negative one, you could say.

00:08:20.527 --> 00:08:22.679
And from the right, it's one,

00:08:22.679 --> 00:08:25.273
and it's approaching one the entire time.

00:08:25.273 --> 00:08:27.915
And so we know if you're
approaching two different values

00:08:27.915 --> 00:08:30.963
from on the left side or
the right side of the limit,

00:08:30.963 --> 00:08:32.999
then this limit will not exist.

00:08:32.999 --> 00:08:36.416
So here, this is not, not differentiable.

00:08:37.299 --> 00:08:39.654
And even intuitively, we
think of the derivative

00:08:39.654 --> 00:08:42.331
as the slope of the tangent line.

00:08:42.331 --> 00:08:44.129
And you could actually
draw an infinite number

00:08:44.129 --> 00:08:45.390
of tangent lines here.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:46.835
That's one way to think about it.

00:08:46.835 --> 00:08:49.795
You could say, well, maybe
this is the tangent line

00:08:49.795 --> 00:08:51.908
right over there, but
then why can't I make

00:08:51.908 --> 00:08:55.681
something like this the tangent line?

00:08:55.681 --> 00:09:00.073
That only intersects at
the point C comma zero.

00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:01.819
And then you could keep
doing things like that.

00:09:01.819 --> 00:09:03.643
Why can't that be the tangent line?

00:09:03.643 --> 00:09:05.673
And you could go on and on and on.

00:09:05.673 --> 00:09:08.687
So the big takeaways here,
at least intuitively,

00:09:08.687 --> 00:09:10.962
in a future video I'm
going to prove to you

00:09:10.962 --> 00:09:15.193
that if F is differentiable at
C that it is continuous at C,

00:09:15.193 --> 00:09:16.950
which can also be interpreted
as that if you're not

00:09:16.950 --> 00:09:19.913
continuous at C, then you're
not gonna be differentiable.

00:09:19.913 --> 00:09:21.377
These two examples will hopefully give you

00:09:21.377 --> 00:09:22.923
some intuition for that.

00:09:22.923 --> 00:09:25.519
But it's not the case that
if something is continuous

00:09:25.519 --> 00:09:27.306
that it has to be differentiable.

00:09:27.306 --> 00:09:29.673
It oftentimes will be
differentiable, but it doesn't have

00:09:29.673 --> 00:09:32.066
to be differentiable, and
this absolute value function

00:09:32.066 --> 00:09:34.997
is an example of a
continuous function at C,

00:09:34.997 --> 00:09:37.174
but it is not differentiable at C.
