[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.712 --> 00:00:07.830
JESSE HAINES: Eric
is here today to talk

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.045
about the social side
of physical spaces

00:00:10.045 --> 00:00:12.420
in our communities-- the parks,
the churches, the bowling

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.336
alleys, the coffee shops,
and, of course, near

00:00:14.336 --> 00:00:18.270
and dear to me and the Growth
Google team, the libraries.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.720
But Eric obviously thinks
about all of these spaces.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.380
His book, "Palaces for the
People" provides a really fresh

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.170
take on this sort of notion
of social infrastructure

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.540
and how it represents the
key to safety and prosperity

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.607
in 21st century urban America.

00:00:32.607 --> 00:00:34.440
It's a fascinating read,
and you can pick up

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.010
a copy after the talk
and I hope you do so.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.780
A little bit about
Eric, he's a professor

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.780
of sociology and director of the
Institute for Public Knowledge

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.970
at NYU, and his work
has been published

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.544
in numerous academic
journals as well as him

00:00:47.544 --> 00:00:49.710
being a frequent contributor
to publications ranging

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.880
from "The New Yorker"
and "The Wall Street

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.560
Journal" to "Rolling Stone."

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.010
I will add that Eric
teamed up with Aziz Ansari

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.630
and co-authored a book called
"Modern Romance," where

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.360
the two applied social science
tools to better understand

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.200
dating.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:09.150
So that is totally in
bounds for the Q&amp;A.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.360
So thank you once again
to Allison McDougall Wheel

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.250
from the Roots user
experience team who's

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.270
been instrumental in
making this happen today

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.610
as well as Arini
in the back there

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.240
who was critical to
making all this happen.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.750
And now Eric on behalf of Roots,
Growth Google and the Google

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.585
New York Community, welcome.

00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:33.710
We're so happy you're here.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.626
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:38.084 --> 00:01:40.100
ERIC KLINENBERG: Thank
you for being here.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.808
I know how much you've
got going on here.

00:01:41.808 --> 00:01:45.040
You're building billions of
new square feet of real estate

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.160
where we speak, so you must all
be very busy people in addition

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.186
to your other projects.

00:01:49.186 --> 00:01:50.560
I'm actually a
neighbor of yours.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.100
I live on 15th Street, so
I'm very invested in what

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.050
you guys do here even though--

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:58.152
it's my third time
speaking at Google.

00:01:58.152 --> 00:01:59.610
I like to visit
the building, but I

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.651
have to write a book in
order to get in the door.

00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:03.605
So I'm working very
hard on the next one

00:02:03.605 --> 00:02:05.230
already, but for the
moment, I'm just--

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.188
I'm pleased to be here.

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:10.389
And I had this crazy idea even
though this is a tech place

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.730
and I knew that you would
have these amazing screens

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.880
and all sorts of
technological capacities here,

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.939
well, I want to try this thing
which I've been doing recently,

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.230
and I hope this is OK with you.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.396
It's a little bit weird,
but I'm actually just going

00:02:25.396 --> 00:02:31.450
to talk to you for 40 minutes
or so as if I were a human being

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:36.550
and I had a voice and a body and
you guys have voices and bodies

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.570
and we just could
talk to each other.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.620
And I hope that's not too
weird a thing to do here.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.780
But there's going to be
no PowerPoint slides.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.800
I have-- I made them.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.425
I spent hours and
hours preparing them.

00:02:46.425 --> 00:02:47.620
I'm not going to use them.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.480
And let's just try to
have a conversation

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.645
if that's OK with you.

00:02:50.645 --> 00:02:52.000
All right?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.960
Massive applause.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.380
If you're watching on
YouTube in the future, yeah.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.350
So here's how I want to start.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.920
Have any of you guys been to
the Amazon Four Star Store?

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.470
Do you know what I'm talking
about, the Four Star Store?

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.230
So half of you have been there.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.870
Just so there's this
company called Amazon.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.770
They're moving to New York City.

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:18.110
They've got a really
good deal to come here.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.010
They're going to be
far away in Queens,

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.770
but they're going to be a big
presence in New York City.

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:26.440
But they're already
gaining some land here,

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.940
and they've decided
that in addition

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.490
to having this awesome website
that can get us anything

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:32.290
in a few hours, they
also want to have

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.520
more of a retail presence.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.970
And so you've probably seen that
there's Amazon stores appearing

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.220
in malls and on some blocks.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.150
And just before Christmas in the
run up to the holiday season,

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.660
they open this new thing
called the Four Star Store.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.460
And you're probably
already thinking

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.180
wow that sounds really awesome.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.760
I'd love to go to
a Four Star Store.

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.500
And in case you haven't been
there, don't know the concept,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.760
the idea is that this
is a store in Soho.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.180
It's on Spring Street in a very
cool, busy part of the city,

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.570
and they will only
stock and sell

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.590
things at the Four Star Store
that have gotten four stars

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:09.970
or more from Amazon users.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.647
So you know when
you're going in there

00:04:11.647 --> 00:04:13.480
that you're going to
get a very high quality

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.090
product that people like.

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.228
And there was a big "New
York Times" article about it

00:04:18.228 --> 00:04:20.019
when it came out, and
I thought that sounds

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.089
like a buzzy, neat thing.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:25.570
And in addition to being
a neighbor of yours,

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.770
I'm also a parent who's
raising kids in this area.

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.020
You guys are-- this is Google.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.550
Everybody's young, but does
anybody here have children?

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.510
Anyone?

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:36.624
So for those of you
who have children here,

00:04:36.624 --> 00:04:39.040
there's this thing-- and for
those of you who are thinking

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.010
about having children
sometime in the future--

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:42.760
I want to tell you
there's this thing that

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.390
happens which is on
weekends, the schools

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.770
won't take your kids.

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.590
And so you wake
up in the morning,

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.850
and things happen like--

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:55.050
I have a 10-year-old
and a 12-year-old--

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.430
and I wake up and I'm
married, and it'll

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.930
be 9:00 in the
morning and my wife

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.682
will say things occasionally
like, hey, Eric, such nice day.

00:05:02.682 --> 00:05:04.390
I'm going to run out
and do some errands.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.100
I'll be home around 6:00.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.130
And then you're in this weird
situation because it's 9:00

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.530
in the morning, and you're--
there's screens in the house,

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.800
but you don't want your kids
on screens all the time.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.320
They can only be on the
screens like 20 hours a day.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.800
And so you got to find something
else that the kids can do,

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:23.590
and my 12-year-old
pretty much doesn't

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:26.187
want to be anywhere near me
at this point because he's 12

00:05:26.187 --> 00:05:27.770
and that's what you
do when you're 12.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.145
So now I have like
a 10-year-old,

00:05:29.145 --> 00:05:30.700
and it's 9:00 in the morning.

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:32.890
And it's weekend,
and I think, I've

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:34.210
got to come up with a plan.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.770
And I just read this article,
and I just published this book.

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.140
And just by the way "Palaces
for the People," which

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:45.370
is the title for the book,
comes from Andrew Carnegie.

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.970
And he was like the Bill
Gates of a century ago,

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.830
one of the wealthiest
men in the world,

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:56.290
and he has a mixed record as
an employer and capitalist,

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:58.840
definitely like very
gilded age monopolist, not

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:01.630
great to workers, did some
violent and horrible things,

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.300
also great philanthropist,
who gave away

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.250
the equivalent of
like $250 billion

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.470
in contemporary
dollars, including--

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:15.160
he funded the construction
of about 2,800 libraries

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.750
around the world and about
1,800, 1,700 are in the US.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:22.480
And he called them--

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:24.370
he calls the libraries
palaces for the people

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:28.240
because the idea is that he
was an immigrant to the US,

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.400
and he was here at a time
when a lot of immigrants

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.100
were working in factories and
living in tenement buildings.

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:35.290
And the notion was like you
would come to a library,

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:36.460
and the library
be this thing that

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:38.740
would give you an exalted
experience in the world.

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:38.920
So--

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.253
AUDIENCE: Is he from Pittsburgh?

00:06:40.253 --> 00:06:42.630
ERIC KLINENBERG: He's
from Pittsburgh, yes.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:45.610
So the libraries that are
Carnegie libraries often

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:50.830
have very high ceilings and
big windows and big rooms.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.880
And the notion is
that if you go there,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:56.220
you're supposed to feel like
this sense of opportunity.

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.970
The library was literally
like your palace

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.761
where you could make
something of yourself.

00:06:59.761 --> 00:07:02.054
It was central to his idea
of how you could aspire

00:07:02.054 --> 00:07:03.220
to become something greater.

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.730
It was his philanthropic
contribution to the public.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:13.180
And so I was aware that
increasingly these days,

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:16.660
the palaces that people get
excited about our palaces

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:19.720
like the Amazon Four Star Store.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.110
But also that not too far from
the Amazon Four Star Store,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.330
there's a Carnegie Library.

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.746
There's one in the
Lower East Side

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:29.770
in a neighborhood called Seward
Park, which I like a lot.

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:33.880
So my poor children,
their father

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:37.150
is a sociologist, which means
that when other parents are

00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:39.910
just doing ordinary fun things
like taking them to amusement

00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:41.710
parks and McDonald's,
I'm thinking

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:43.210
of social experiments
that will make

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.660
their lives more interesting.

00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:46.410
And so on this morning,
I decide so my son

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:48.368
doesn't want to be with
me when my wife is out.

00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:49.330
I've got my daughter.

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:50.882
She's 10 and full of energy.

00:07:50.882 --> 00:07:52.090
We're going to do this thing.

00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:56.350
We're going to first go to the
Amazon Four Star Store, which

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:57.950
sounds like this
exciting new place,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:08:01.000
and then we're going
to walk to the library.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:04.420
And we are going to
compare those experiences.

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.280
And so I'm so
excited about this.

00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.320
I get her out the door
because who wouldn't want

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.528
to go to the Four Star Store.

00:08:09.528 --> 00:08:12.820
I'm really emphasizing the Four
Star Store as I talk to her.

00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:14.860
So we get there,
and sure enough, it

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.370
is buzzing with activity.

00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:17.830
There are tons of people around.

00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:20.210
Everybody seems a little
bit curious and happy.

00:08:20.210 --> 00:08:22.780
That's got that-- the energy
of a new store that opens up

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.204
in Soho and lots people around.

00:08:24.204 --> 00:08:26.620
And we walk around, and they
have all these amazing things

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:28.960
like-- because everything
had to have four stars--

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.970
so like the vacuum cleaner
that you don't have to push--

00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:36.659
the what's it
called, Zumba Rumba.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:38.297
Zumba's an exercise class.

00:08:38.297 --> 00:08:39.130
They have the thing.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.380
Anyway, it's traveling
all over the place, yeah.

00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:43.090
And all these good
things going on,

00:08:43.090 --> 00:08:46.630
and they had lots of
games, very few books

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.210
unfortunately for
the book writers.

00:08:49.210 --> 00:08:52.300
But they also had a
talking Chewbacca,

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:53.300
which my daughter loved.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.630
It was an amazing,
amazing Chewbacca.

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:58.060
And what I realized is
that in the 20 minutes

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:00.040
or so that we spent
in this store,

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.920
my daughter, bless her asked
me for about $1,200 in stuff

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:08.750
because there's just so
much great stuff there.

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.060
And that was
actually OK until we

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:14.899
got to the very end
in which she realized

00:09:14.899 --> 00:09:16.690
when I said no you're
not getting anything,

00:09:16.690 --> 00:09:18.010
I really meant it.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.670
And that wasn't just because I'm
a really difficult and ornery

00:09:21.670 --> 00:09:22.490
person.

00:09:22.490 --> 00:09:27.220
It's also that I think there's
this thing about public life

00:09:27.220 --> 00:09:30.030
when it's organized around
very commercial activities

00:09:30.030 --> 00:09:31.505
as so much of our
public life is,

00:09:31.505 --> 00:09:32.880
and that is like
you go shopping,

00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:35.800
you go to the new place, and
it feels really fun at first.

00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.600
And then you realize
that they want

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.490
to take something
from you, and they're

00:09:39.490 --> 00:09:41.170
asking you to spend money.

00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:42.850
And sometimes you
don't have that money.

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.870
Often you don't have that money
or not enough because there

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:46.776
are so many things.

00:09:46.776 --> 00:09:48.400
And so there's always
a strange feeling

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:50.775
of organizing public life
around commercial things, which

00:09:50.775 --> 00:09:52.810
is it's uplifting
and then a little bit

00:09:52.810 --> 00:09:54.997
hollow and frustrating, too.

00:09:54.997 --> 00:09:56.830
And I thought we would
have that experience.

00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.230
I didn't realize what a
profound experience of emptiness

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:00.896
and hollowness we'd
have at the end when

00:10:00.896 --> 00:10:04.480
she realized all she could do
is put the items on the list.

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:05.110
But it was OK.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:08.450
So we were at the Amazon
store and the plan--

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.340
here's the plan.

00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:11.560
We're going to leave there.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.685
She was not going to get
all the things she wanted.

00:10:13.685 --> 00:10:17.020
And then I'm going to walk
her to my favorite library

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.820
in Seward Park, and
she's going to say,

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.654
oh, dad, that's the
best graphic novel here.

00:10:21.654 --> 00:10:22.570
I love graphic novels.

00:10:22.570 --> 00:10:23.380
Can I have this?

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.700
And I was going to say,
of course, you can.

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:27.250
And then she's like, oh, they
have this really cool game.

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:28.166
Can we play this game?

00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:28.720
Yes, we can.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:31.870
Oh, can I have that the video
that we can borrow and bring

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:32.370
back.

00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:35.140
Yeah, you can-- yes to
everything was the plan.

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.110
And so I totally
engineered this experience

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:42.340
where at the end of the day
is we-- dad, I love libraries.

00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.380
And all these big shops, they
just want to take from you.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:47.239
I was so smart about this.

00:10:47.239 --> 00:10:49.780
And we went to Seward Park and
that was like a 20-minute walk

00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.560
there.

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.480
Seward Park's in the
oldest municipal park,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.520
the first municipal park
in the United States

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.720
on the Lower East Side.

00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:58.780
It's a really special place
because the Lower East Side

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:02.140
is a neighborhood like Chelsea
a few decades ago where

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:05.950
we're sitting right
now, historically

00:11:05.950 --> 00:11:08.410
a lot of poor people,
a lot of immigrants.

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.390
It's in the midst of
a transition there.

00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:12.140
There's a lot of
gentrification happening.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:15.640
Have any of you guys been to
Seward Park or Lower East Side?

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:20.440
And so there's still a
lot of very poor people

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:22.750
who use the library
as a great resource,

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:25.360
but there's also
people who will only

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:28.445
get their coffee from coffee
shops that don't accept cash

00:11:28.445 --> 00:11:30.820
because you should only pay
for things with a credit card

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:31.390
these days.

00:11:31.390 --> 00:11:33.610
Or if you are the
kind of person who

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:35.530
likes to wake up in the
morning on a weekend

00:11:35.530 --> 00:11:37.870
and feel like I want to find
a place where I can spend

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.419
$7 on an ice cream
cone, Seward Park

00:11:40.419 --> 00:11:41.710
is an awesome place to do that.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.810
There's so many $7
ice cream cones.

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:45.700
And so you feel the
tension when you

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:48.640
go to the neighborhood of
this transition happening.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.620
And the library is
this nice middle ground

00:11:50.620 --> 00:11:52.630
where people come
together, and I wanted

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:54.890
her to see all that stuff.

00:11:54.890 --> 00:11:56.230
So I'm so pumped.

00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:57.190
We walk from Soho.

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:59.830
We're walking east having
this great conversation.

00:11:59.830 --> 00:12:07.120
We get to Seward Park, walk
to a library, and it's closed.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:07.720
It's closed.

00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.900
Have you seen this talk before?

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:11.820
That's good because
I'm just doing it now,

00:12:11.820 --> 00:12:14.342
so that would be very weird.

00:12:14.342 --> 00:12:15.800
You might have
technology at Google

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.150
where you can fast forward
while someone speaking and see--

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:20.410
I know you're working on that.

00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:25.030
So anyway-- so we get-- it's
not only is the library closed,

00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:28.810
but it's padlocked at the
gate from outside the library,

00:12:28.810 --> 00:12:30.550
so we can't even get
anywhere near it.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:36.280
Now I spent just about every day
for a year in public libraries

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:38.890
doing work on this
book, and I should

00:12:38.890 --> 00:12:41.880
have known that the library
was closed because--

00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:43.005
why was the library closed?

00:12:43.005 --> 00:12:44.145
Do you know why?

00:12:44.145 --> 00:12:46.060
It was Sunday.

00:12:46.060 --> 00:12:49.390
And we say that
is if God decreed

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.460
that on Sunday the
library would be closed.

00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.010
And that was the way that my
daughter looked at things.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:55.718
I asked her why do
you think it's closed.

00:12:55.718 --> 00:12:57.280
And she's like,
it's Sunday, dad.

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.610
It's like everybody knows
that on Sunday we rest,

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.190
and people go to church and
everything-- things that

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.020
are these public city things.

00:13:05.020 --> 00:13:06.725
They just don't
happen on Sunday.

00:13:06.725 --> 00:13:08.350
And I was like, oh,
yeah, that's right.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:09.140
My daughter's so smart.

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:10.056
I'm very proud of her.

00:13:10.056 --> 00:13:11.480
She's only 10, and
she knows that.

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:13.510
And then I realized
that that is true now,

00:13:13.510 --> 00:13:17.560
but it's not that things are
closed on Sunday because God

00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.970
ordained it.

00:13:18.970 --> 00:13:22.550
It's that for the last
many years, libraries

00:13:22.550 --> 00:13:23.950
and other big
public institutions

00:13:23.950 --> 00:13:27.610
that used to draw us together
are closed because we

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:33.310
don't give them enough money in
the public sector to stay open.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.400
And so the default option that
all of us have on the weekend

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:39.490
is that instead of going
to shared places that

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:41.470
are part of the
public realm, we go

00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:43.300
to places that are in
the private sector,

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.330
the commercial enterprises
that ask something from us.

00:13:46.330 --> 00:13:49.120
We pay to be part
of public life.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.760
And I know that because when
I started doing research

00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:54.280
on the history of libraries,
one of the things I discovered

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:59.950
is that libraries actually
used to be busiest on Sundays.

00:13:59.950 --> 00:14:01.990
Sundays were booming
days for libraries.

00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.680
Why is that?

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:05.830
Because on Sundays a lot
of people don't work.

00:14:05.830 --> 00:14:09.280
It's a great day to be with
your family, with your children,

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.150
with your neighbors.

00:14:10.150 --> 00:14:14.320
It's a place-- it's a day to
rest and to read and to come

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:15.280
together.

00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:19.180
And there's nothing we've
ever engineered that does

00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:21.580
that as well as the library.

00:14:21.580 --> 00:14:24.610
And so people used to
roll into libraries.

00:14:24.610 --> 00:14:27.070
They were booming and
not just on Sundays.

00:14:27.070 --> 00:14:29.539
At night-- 7:00, 8:00,
9:00, 10:00 at night,

00:14:29.539 --> 00:14:31.330
there's a late night
culture where families

00:14:31.330 --> 00:14:33.829
would go and be together because
people work during the day,

00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:35.260
and that was the opportunity.

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:39.130
And now we close those things
down as a matter of course,

00:14:39.130 --> 00:14:43.060
not because God ordained it
but because we have for decades

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:47.260
made a decision not to
invest in the things

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:51.220
that I've come to consider in
my work social infrastructure.

00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.800
And libraries are a very
special social infrastructure,

00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:56.140
but they are by no
means the only one.

00:14:56.140 --> 00:14:57.940
What do I mean by
social infrastructure?

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.430
By social infrastructure,
I am referring

00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:05.980
to the physical places that
shape the way we interact.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:09.476
And when we invest in
social infrastructure,

00:15:09.476 --> 00:15:11.350
when we build them up
and we design them well

00:15:11.350 --> 00:15:14.080
and we take care of
them, we are far more

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:17.210
likely to engage other
people around us,

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.500
whether it's friends or family
or neighbors or strangers who

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:22.030
we encounter.

00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:25.720
We're more likely to do
it frequently and pleasant

00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.430
conditions.

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:28.990
At the same time,
if we don't invest

00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:33.400
in social infrastructure, we're
all the more likely to wind up

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.580
hunkering down, staying
home, being alone, getting

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:40.690
our source of social
satisfaction from the machines

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:44.800
that we carry with us in
our pocket everywhere we go.

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.410
And social infrastructure by
the way, it's not a metaphor.

00:15:48.410 --> 00:15:49.520
It's a real thing.

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.390
I've come to believe that the
social infrastructure is just

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:55.660
as real as the infrastructure
for communication

00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.805
or for water or for power.

00:15:57.805 --> 00:16:01.210
It's literally this
material, physical foundation

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:03.400
that shapes our social lives.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.220
And I first got to know what
social infrastructure is

00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:07.960
and came to understand it.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:09.880
Years ago, I was
working on a book

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.380
about a heatwave
in Chicago, which

00:16:11.380 --> 00:16:13.100
is the city that I grew up in.

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.210
And there was this
incredible heatwave

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:17.560
that happened there in 1995.

00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:19.607
Hundreds of people died,
and one of the things

00:16:19.607 --> 00:16:21.190
I wanted to do in
the book was to look

00:16:21.190 --> 00:16:25.000
at why some neighborhoods
seem to break down and have

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.500
catastrophic outcomes and
why others did really well.

00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.330
And the first order
answer to that problem

00:16:31.330 --> 00:16:34.150
is one that will not
interest anybody here.

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:37.150
Obviously, poor
neighborhoods, neighborhood

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:39.970
have a lot of concentrated
disadvantage, old people,

00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:42.250
frail people, sick people,
those neighborhoods

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:45.790
are going to do worse than
affluent neighborhoods where

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.770
people have resources
and are healthy.

00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:49.810
That's-- there's no
Nobel Prize for me,

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:52.390
no magical job offer at
Google at the end of this talk

00:16:52.390 --> 00:16:55.240
because I've blown your minds
with the scientific observation

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:58.660
that vulnerable people
die most in a disaster.

00:16:58.660 --> 00:16:59.950
Anybody want hire me?

00:16:59.950 --> 00:17:02.180
Still no.

00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:03.940
So but what was
really interesting

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:06.069
and scientifically puzzling--

00:17:06.069 --> 00:17:08.800
and this is why I wrote
my first book about this--

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:10.450
is that it turns
out there's a bunch

00:17:10.450 --> 00:17:13.960
of neighborhoods in Chicago
that are similarly poor that

00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.420
have a similar levels
of segregation,

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.060
that demographically are
just about identical.

00:17:19.060 --> 00:17:22.042
And many of them are
separated by one street.

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:23.500
And if you looked
at them on paper,

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:25.401
you wouldn't think
anything other

00:17:25.401 --> 00:17:26.859
than that these
neighborhoods would

00:17:26.859 --> 00:17:28.109
have the same experiences.

00:17:28.109 --> 00:17:29.650
But during the
heatwave, it turns out

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:30.650
there were places like--

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.310
imagine there was a line
that went through this table

00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:35.070
and bisected the room.

00:17:35.070 --> 00:17:37.155
And everybody on this
side of the table

00:17:37.155 --> 00:17:39.280
was like everybody on this
side of the table in all

00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.160
the demographic ways that
we conventionally measure,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.740
but on this side of the table,
nobody died in the heatwave.

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:48.850
In fact, you did better than
the most wealthy neighborhoods

00:17:48.850 --> 00:17:50.120
in all of Chicago.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:56.230
And on this side of the
table, it was a catastrophe.

00:17:56.230 --> 00:17:58.114
Massive numbers of
people died and got sick,

00:17:58.114 --> 00:17:59.530
and there were
deaths of isolation

00:17:59.530 --> 00:18:02.860
because people were literally
baking to death at home

00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:03.930
not going out.

00:18:03.930 --> 00:18:05.609
And so that was
really interesting,

00:18:05.609 --> 00:18:07.150
and that was
scientifically puzzling.

00:18:07.150 --> 00:18:09.700
And I spent a lot of time in
Chicago trying to figure out

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.050
what was going on here.

00:18:11.050 --> 00:18:13.300
And the answer turned out
to be that the neighborhoods

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.600
like this that were
really protected

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:19.240
were places that had this
booming social infrastructure.

00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:22.570
They had robust street life.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:24.620
The sidewalks were
well taken care of.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.570
They had very little
housing lost, very little

00:18:28.570 --> 00:18:30.410
population abandonment.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:33.250
So you had real density.

00:18:33.250 --> 00:18:36.730
There was a dynamic
commercial sector--

00:18:36.730 --> 00:18:41.110
shops, nonprofits, institutions
like libraries that draw people

00:18:41.110 --> 00:18:42.436
out into public life.

00:18:42.436 --> 00:18:44.560
And what that meant for
people in that neighborhood

00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:50.140
is that they're more likely
to go outside, just casually

00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:53.090
to interact with neighbors
on a regular basis.

00:18:53.090 --> 00:18:55.256
And when there was a
crisis, this heatwave,

00:18:55.256 --> 00:18:57.130
it's very easy for them
to do the same thing,

00:18:57.130 --> 00:18:58.600
and that wound up
being very protective.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.400
But on the other side of the
room, you guys over there,

00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:02.733
you picked the wrong side of
the room to sit on, people.

00:19:02.733 --> 00:19:08.210
I'm very sorry for you because
here neighborhoods like this,

00:19:08.210 --> 00:19:13.490
a lot of abandoned houses, a lot
of empty lots that discourage

00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:14.700
people from going outdoors.

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:15.690
It can very dangerous.

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:17.731
We know from a lot of
research that I write about

00:19:17.731 --> 00:19:18.860
in this book.

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:21.800
Fewer nonprofit
organizations, less active

00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:24.620
religious organizations,
public sector institutions

00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.710
like libraries not as present
or well run to the extent

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:30.260
that their parks, they
tended to be more abandoned,

00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:32.040
just separated by a street.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:34.414
These are neighborhoods with
tens of thousands of people,

00:19:34.414 --> 00:19:36.150
but a street bisects them.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:38.100
And here what that
meant is people

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:41.360
are less likely to spend time
in public settings getting

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.100
to know the people
around them, more

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.540
likely to have a small
network, to get isolated,

00:19:46.540 --> 00:19:48.219
to die in the heatwave.

00:19:48.219 --> 00:19:49.760
And I literally
studied neighborhoods

00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:52.310
where the death rate was 10
times higher on this side than

00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:53.062
on this side.

00:19:53.062 --> 00:19:55.020
And there's one pair of
neighborhoods I found--

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:56.770
and actually a couple
of pairs like this--

00:19:56.770 --> 00:20:01.250
where the life expectancy
on this side of the street

00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.320
was five years
longer than the life

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:05.090
expectancy across the street.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:06.980
And that was not about
the characteristics

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:08.900
of the population.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.220
That was about the
social infrastructure.

00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:15.420
So any of you here for Hurricane
Sandy or Superstorm Sandy?

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.670
You guys were around for that?

00:20:16.670 --> 00:20:18.795
So I was here, and I'd been
doing a lot of research

00:20:18.795 --> 00:20:21.410
on this question about how
social infrastructure works

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:22.320
and why it matters.

00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.000
And after Sandy, I realized
that a bunch of similar patterns

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.790
were happening in New
York City, but also

00:20:28.790 --> 00:20:32.600
in New York Sandy occasioned
a real public reckoning

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.530
around what do we do now as
we start to think about how

00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.620
to rebuild our cities,
our communities,

00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:42.650
our regions to face
the kinds of problems

00:20:42.650 --> 00:20:45.650
we face in the 21st century.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:49.370
Things like climate change,
high rising seas, bigger storm

00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:52.397
surge, but other issues as well.

00:20:52.397 --> 00:20:54.980
And I run this thing called the
Institute for Public Knowledge

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.480
at NYU, and we were doing a
lot of programming around Sandy

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.220
and the future of New York City.

00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:03.290
And I'd start
writing some articles

00:21:03.290 --> 00:21:06.380
for magazines about how to
think about this infrastructure

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:08.060
crisis that we were facing here.

00:21:08.060 --> 00:21:10.310
And one day I got this
call out of the blue

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:14.270
from a member of the Obama
administration who said,

00:21:14.270 --> 00:21:20.120
look we have about $50 billion
in federal aid for Sandy that

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:21.560
came from Congress.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:23.690
And we've cordoned
off a few billion

00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:26.240
for a special competition
we called the Rebuild

00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.280
by Design Competition.

00:21:28.280 --> 00:21:30.680
You might not know this,
but ordinarily the way

00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.240
that FEMA operates
is that if you're

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.000
going to get relief for
a disaster from FEMA,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.950
the FEMA regulations
say you can't

00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:39.539
build anything that's better
than what was there before.

00:21:39.539 --> 00:21:42.080
You can only build things up to
the standards that were there

00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:44.480
before because the
federal government is

00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:47.600
suspicious of local governments
trying to take advantage

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.700
of federal largesse.

00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:52.910
And so we say you can't
pretend that something's wrong

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:55.190
and improve but
think about what that

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:59.630
means in the wake of a
hurricane for a region that's

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.690
facing rising seas.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.810
You can build a seawall
but only up to four feet.

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.910
But sea level rise means
it's not going to work.

00:22:07.910 --> 00:22:09.060
Sorry, you can't do that.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:10.160
So the Obama
administration said, look,

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:12.326
we're going to have to do
things really differently.

00:22:12.326 --> 00:22:14.960
And they began this
process by setting aside

00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:16.430
funds for this
design competition

00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:17.926
that they called
Rebuild by Design.

00:22:17.926 --> 00:22:19.550
And the idea is that
they invited teams

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:22.490
from all over the world
to submit applications

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:24.690
to be part of this process.

00:22:24.690 --> 00:22:28.010
And 148 teams applied.

00:22:28.010 --> 00:22:30.230
Some of the world's
biggest engineering firms

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:34.580
and great architects, Rem
Koolhaas' firm and Bjarke

00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:37.550
Ingles' firm and a lot
of starchitect names

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.710
that you would recognize,
I'll put in for this.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:42.410
And they asked me if I'd be
the research director for this.

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.060
And that was a really
cool opportunity

00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.750
because I don't know a
ton about the engineering

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:51.600
of hard infrastructure systems
like seawalls and power grids,

00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:54.020
but what I've come
to really understand

00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:56.420
is the power of
social infrastructure

00:22:56.420 --> 00:22:59.040
and its capacity to
shape our experiences,

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:04.250
whether it's in a neighborhood
or in a workplace where

00:23:04.250 --> 00:23:05.930
how things are
designed and built

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:09.980
and what kinds of gathering
places we have really shape

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:12.380
the quality of our
day and potentially

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.820
the quality of our work as well.

00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:16.220
So I got to work with
these teams, and the idea

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:19.310
that I really impressed
upon the teams, our 10

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:20.782
finalists in the end--

00:23:20.782 --> 00:23:23.240
and they had to go through a
nine-month process before they

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:26.360
could come up with a design
proposal that would potentially

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.580
get funded or not get
funded by the feds--

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.650
the idea I insisted
upon to these teams

00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:36.080
is that they recognize that the
systems that they were building

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:38.930
to deal with these
21st century challenges

00:23:38.930 --> 00:23:41.860
could do multiple things.

00:23:41.860 --> 00:23:45.659
If they were originally
intended to keep the water out,

00:23:45.659 --> 00:23:47.450
they should also think
about how they would

00:23:47.450 --> 00:23:49.520
shape social life around it.

00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.310
And it was important to impress
that point upon them, the idea

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.070
that you're designing social
infrastructure and not

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:57.950
just hard infrastructure because
I don't know how many of you

00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:01.400
remember what the engineers
and the scientists

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:04.010
and the people concerned about
climate change in New York City

00:24:04.010 --> 00:24:07.640
were saying New York City
needed to do after Sandy,

00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:11.690
but the leading proposals for
how to rebuild this region

00:24:11.690 --> 00:24:13.209
were organized
around this phrase.

00:24:13.209 --> 00:24:14.750
Tell me if you
recognize this phrase.

00:24:14.750 --> 00:24:16.340
The phrase that
everybody was saying

00:24:16.340 --> 00:24:24.677
after Sandy what New York City
needed to do was build a wall.

00:24:24.677 --> 00:24:25.760
You recognize that phrase?

00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:27.470
Does that sound familiar?

00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:29.610
Build a wall was a big proposal.

00:24:29.610 --> 00:24:31.820
And I-- if I were using
all the technology,

00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.090
I will show you these design
ideas for like giant seawalls

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:38.510
that would go where the
Verrazzano Bridge is now.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:42.500
Other ideas about building
hard infrastructure

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:46.160
that would keep the water out
and keep New York City safe.

00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.910
But there's lots of
problems with building

00:24:47.910 --> 00:24:50.690
hard infrastructure,
especially things like walls,

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:53.780
which turned out not to work
for water or for people.

00:24:56.684 --> 00:24:58.100
One of the problems
that I learned

00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:00.804
is that if you build a seawall
to try to keep water out

00:25:00.804 --> 00:25:02.720
of a place like New York
City-- and by the way

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.490
we're talking like from
the flood plain here.

00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:05.198
I think we were--

00:25:05.198 --> 00:25:07.280
the Google Complex sits
very close to where

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.250
water could easily come in not
just in New York City but also

00:25:10.250 --> 00:25:11.750
if you're watching
in Mountain View,

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.120
you guys are even more
vulnerable, so hi.

00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:16.010
But these are really
serious issues.

00:25:16.010 --> 00:25:19.179
So if you build a wall, seawalls
are designed to open and close,

00:25:19.179 --> 00:25:20.720
and the idea is you
want to keep them

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:22.527
open as much time as possible.

00:25:22.527 --> 00:25:24.360
You only close them
when you really need it.

00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.726
But if the sea
levels are rising,

00:25:26.726 --> 00:25:28.100
then you potentially
need to keep

00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.884
that wall closed more and--

00:25:30.884 --> 00:25:32.300
probably not
everybody in the room

00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:34.850
is familiar with the fact
that like on the other side

00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:37.220
of the Verrazzano is this
massive ecosystem that

00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.310
turns into the Hudson River
and the Hudson River Valley.

00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:43.640
And if you just build a
wall and shut the water off

00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:46.430
from coming out, that
has massive consequences

00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:50.152
for the ecosystem, so you can't
make these decisions glibly.

00:25:50.152 --> 00:25:51.860
The other thing is--
and this is probably

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.200
going to blow your minds because
I didn't know this is true

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.908
until I started working
on this project--

00:25:55.908 --> 00:25:59.060
but let's say you want to build
a wall to protect Manhattan

00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:01.790
in New York City.

00:26:01.790 --> 00:26:04.100
You might want to make sure
you're solidly sitting down

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:08.960
because it turns out that
right across the river from us

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:11.780
is a whole entire place
called New Jersey.

00:26:11.780 --> 00:26:14.510
And it's a big state.

00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:16.340
There's a lot of
people there, and they

00:26:16.340 --> 00:26:18.740
have their own infrastructure
and their own housing

00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:20.720
and their own sets
of set of issues.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.140
And if you build a wall
to protect New York City,

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:27.260
it's not like the water just
evaporates when it hits it.

00:26:27.260 --> 00:26:30.380
It goes to New Jersey.

00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:32.600
So-- and there's sediment.

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:34.880
And so that creates problems.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:36.902
You can't just ask
for federal money

00:26:36.902 --> 00:26:38.610
to protect New York
City at the expense--

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:43.100
so let's say then we feel for
our neighbors in New Jersey,

00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.120
and they've entered
the age of reason now.

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.240
And they want to
play ball with us.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:48.531
We want to do regional
planning, so we throw New Jersey

00:26:48.531 --> 00:26:50.180
into the plan.

00:26:50.180 --> 00:26:52.281
Have you guys ever
kept going south?

00:26:52.281 --> 00:26:54.292
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:54.292 --> 00:26:56.000
There's all these
things keep popping up.

00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:01.370
There's Delaware, Maryland.

00:27:01.370 --> 00:27:03.650
Anyone here been to Maryland?

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:05.040
Virginia.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:07.060
I'm getting better at
this geography thing.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:11.427
It's like-- North
Carolina, South Carolina.

00:27:11.427 --> 00:27:13.760
Did you guys know that Georgia
actually gets all the way

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:14.630
to the coast over there?

00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:15.320
There's like--

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.160
So you tell me like where do
you want to stop the wall.

00:27:19.160 --> 00:27:21.360
This turns out to be
really a big challenge.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:22.850
And so we can't just--

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.010
I guess what I'm saying
is we face big challenges,

00:27:25.010 --> 00:27:29.720
and putting up walls is
not much of an answer.

00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:33.200
So I told these teams
think about designing

00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.910
systems that are both
hard infrastructure

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:37.036
to do what you want but
also social infrastructure.

00:27:37.036 --> 00:27:38.410
If you're going
to build a levee,

00:27:38.410 --> 00:27:40.430
for instance, think
about the activities that

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:42.500
could happen on top of a levee.

00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.410
So the big plan that emerged
for the Lower East Side, which

00:27:45.410 --> 00:27:48.140
is getting funded with about
a billion and a half dollars

00:27:48.140 --> 00:27:49.850
of public money
right now designed

00:27:49.850 --> 00:27:51.650
by Bjarke Ingles
and his big team

00:27:51.650 --> 00:27:53.900
is instead of a wall
on the Lower East Side,

00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:56.300
it's a kind of a
sloped bridging berm

00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:58.760
that's going to have park
land and bike path and walking

00:27:58.760 --> 00:27:59.090
paths.

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:01.465
It's really going to transform
the feel of the Lower East

00:28:01.465 --> 00:28:02.650
Side.

00:28:02.650 --> 00:28:05.240
And so it's a big
idea to do something

00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:08.370
like that and very different
to build social infrastructure.

00:28:08.370 --> 00:28:11.930
So there's one day when I was
walking around with this design

00:28:11.930 --> 00:28:15.680
team, and they were-- they
had done all this amazing work

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.080
in Louisiana after Katrina.

00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.120
And they're working on
a plan for the region,

00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.680
and they said, Eric, we've
been listening to you talk

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:23.870
about social infrastructure
and how important

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:27.620
it is to design physical places
that can bring people together.

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:30.980
And we have come up with a
whole new prototype for a design

00:28:30.980 --> 00:28:33.235
concept that we're calling
The Resilience Center,

00:28:33.235 --> 00:28:34.610
and we want to
tell you about it.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:35.776
We're so excited about this.

00:28:35.776 --> 00:28:37.380
We think this
Resilience Center, we've

00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.420
got a prototype it in
Bridgeport, Connecticut.

00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:42.462
It's got a lot of
very poor communities.

00:28:42.462 --> 00:28:44.420
And we think we're going
to be able to scale it

00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.150
up and potentially put it in
cities and maybe neighborhoods

00:28:47.150 --> 00:28:48.635
all over the country.

00:28:48.635 --> 00:28:50.510
And I said that sounds
like an amazing thing.

00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:52.820
Who wouldn't want to hear
about The Resilience Center.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:53.520
So tell me about it.

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.269
And they said, OK.

00:28:54.269 --> 00:28:56.270
So here's the idea with
The Resilience Center.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:00.140
We're going to have a building
that's very nicely designed

00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:01.790
for social life.

00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:04.430
It's going to be a
very welcoming place

00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:06.789
with flexible space,
and we're going

00:29:06.789 --> 00:29:08.580
to put in this neighborhood
and potentially

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:09.690
put them everywhere.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:11.850
And the building is
going to be open as much

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.830
as we can possibly
afford to get support

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:17.670
to keep it open hopefully six
days a week, maybe even seven.

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:19.740
And it's going to
be staffed by people

00:29:19.740 --> 00:29:23.300
who are aggressively welcoming.

00:29:23.300 --> 00:29:26.160
Their job is going to be to
make everybody feel at home,

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:29.220
and we can have
little kids come in

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:31.230
because we know from the
things you've told us

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:34.770
about vulnerability that in
neighborhoods the people who

00:29:34.770 --> 00:29:37.050
are really tied to the
place where they live

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:39.492
are very young people
and very old people.

00:29:39.492 --> 00:29:40.950
There's a lot of
middle aged people

00:29:40.950 --> 00:29:43.366
who are bouncing around the
city going all over the place,

00:29:43.366 --> 00:29:45.450
but very young people
and older people,

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:46.837
it really matters
where they live

00:29:46.837 --> 00:29:48.420
and what the facilities
are like, what

00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:49.420
the conditions are like.

00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:50.830
Social infrastructure matters.

00:29:50.830 --> 00:29:52.760
So this resilience
Center, it's going

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:54.750
to have all these
programs that make

00:29:54.750 --> 00:29:56.280
it clear that kids are welcome.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.010
We'll do story times, and
we'll do singing events.

00:29:59.010 --> 00:30:01.622
And we'll have all meet ups
where kids in the neighborhood

00:30:01.622 --> 00:30:03.330
can meet each other,
and we know that you

00:30:03.330 --> 00:30:05.160
can't have things for
kids unless you have

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.539
things for their caretakers.

00:30:06.539 --> 00:30:08.580
So it could be parents,
it could be grandparents,

00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:10.560
it could be baby
sitters, whomever.

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.480
But we want to make
sure that there's things

00:30:12.480 --> 00:30:14.220
that bring families together.

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.310
And I've also written
a lot about the fact

00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.190
that there's more older people
and older people living alone

00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:21.960
in the world today,
and they're really

00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:24.330
at risk of getting isolated
in things like heat waves

00:30:24.330 --> 00:30:26.610
and hurricanes and in
everyday life as well.

00:30:26.610 --> 00:30:28.110
So they said the
resilience center's

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:30.526
going to have lots of special
things for older people that

00:30:30.526 --> 00:30:31.740
make it attractive, too.

00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:34.410
And because resilience is
so much about communication

00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:36.570
and cohesion, we want
to make sure that people

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:38.778
have really good media access
when they come in here,

00:30:38.778 --> 00:30:41.460
so we're going to wire
them up with Wi-Fi access.

00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.040
And we'll have computers,
and we really just see this

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:49.770
as a special idea that
will transform life

00:30:49.770 --> 00:30:51.460
in every neighborhood.

00:30:51.460 --> 00:30:53.080
What do you think?

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:59.400
And I said to them, wow, that
sounds like an awesome idea.

00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:04.790
And then I also said, have
you ever been to a library?

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:08.490
And it was like, whoa, actually
they had just reinvented

00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:09.690
the wheel kind of.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:11.930
And why had they done that?

00:31:11.930 --> 00:31:15.210
I think partly it's because
we do live in this moment

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:20.460
where we tend to think that the
biggest problems that we face

00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:26.910
can be solved with either
technology or the marketplace.

00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:30.120
And not long after
this happened,

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:31.560
there's actually
an economist who

00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:33.930
wrote an article
in "Forbes" saying

00:31:33.930 --> 00:31:37.470
that libraries had
become obsolete

00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:39.870
and they were no longer
worth public investment.

00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:42.480
He said, me the cost
benefit analysis

00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:46.410
that cashes out the value of
the library as a public good.

00:31:46.410 --> 00:31:50.610
He said, instead of libraries,
we should knock them all down,

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:54.424
and we should open
up Amazon stores.

00:31:54.424 --> 00:31:56.340
He didn't even know about
the Four Star Store.

00:31:56.340 --> 00:31:58.450
He just said we should
open up Amazon stores.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:01.664
And it's interesting.

00:32:01.664 --> 00:32:02.580
I guess I understand--

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:03.996
I understood where
that was coming

00:32:03.996 --> 00:32:05.910
from because the
truth is if you go

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:11.340
to the boardrooms of the
biggest companies in the world,

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.070
possibly with the
exception of this fine one,

00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:17.040
if you go to the people who are
running the US government right

00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.160
now, imagine talking to
people in the Cabinet,

00:32:20.160 --> 00:32:22.410
if you go to people who
run big philanthropies

00:32:22.410 --> 00:32:26.160
and you talk about the
places where people gather

00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:29.730
and the essential
institutions that

00:32:29.730 --> 00:32:33.630
bring us together as citizens
and as human beings that allow

00:32:33.630 --> 00:32:36.540
us to bridge divisions,
I think very few people

00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:37.860
think of the library.

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:40.140
I think the truth is
that for many people

00:32:40.140 --> 00:32:42.040
the library is an afterthought.

00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.060
It feels like an
antiquated institution.

00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:47.050
Who would go there?

00:32:47.050 --> 00:32:49.440
But we actually learned
from the response

00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.600
to this "Forbes"
article just how

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.990
out of sync with
American culture

00:32:54.990 --> 00:32:58.620
that perspective is because
so many people actually

00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.840
tweeted a response.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.850
The librarians of the world
united and got on Twitter

00:33:02.850 --> 00:33:05.490
and shouted down
this article so hard

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:08.550
that "Forbes" actually
took it down 24 hours

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:12.290
after it posted it, which
is an amazing thing.

00:33:12.290 --> 00:33:15.150
And what people did is they
didn't just give him the finger

00:33:15.150 --> 00:33:18.900
digitally, which is generally
what happens on Twitter,

00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:21.660
they wrote like very
compelling testimonies

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:25.020
to the things that
happen in libraries.

00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:29.610
And I realized that
there is really a story

00:33:29.610 --> 00:33:32.880
that we need to tell that's
not just about what happens

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.410
in libraries but
also what happens

00:33:34.410 --> 00:33:40.260
in other kinds of shared spaces,
gathering places, that gives us

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:44.010
a chance to move forward
and potentially even

00:33:44.010 --> 00:33:48.060
to make some headway working
through what seems now

00:33:48.060 --> 00:33:51.580
to be a real impasse
in our collective life.

00:33:51.580 --> 00:33:55.360
I don't know you guys feel about
this, but from my perspective,

00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:57.360
it's a scary moment out there.

00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:00.720
It-- I do often have
this feeling like things

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.160
are falling apart.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:06.540
It's very hard to read
contemporary politics

00:34:06.540 --> 00:34:09.330
and read into the
state of civil society

00:34:09.330 --> 00:34:11.920
in places like the
United States today,

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.639
not just the United States,
but many places just

00:34:14.639 --> 00:34:19.320
like the United States and
see a clear path forward

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:24.909
to a better, more robust
civil society and democracy.

00:34:24.909 --> 00:34:30.060
The truth is we're talking
together in early 2019,

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:33.989
and probably no one in this
room feels supremely confident

00:34:33.989 --> 00:34:40.510
that five or 10 or 20 years
from now our democracy,

00:34:40.510 --> 00:34:44.870
our civil society, will look
the way it does right now.

00:34:44.870 --> 00:34:47.610
We're being tested.

00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:52.440
So I don't have the illusion
that building libraries

00:34:52.440 --> 00:34:55.704
all over the country is going
to solve all of our problems.

00:34:55.704 --> 00:34:57.120
I wish I could
come to you and say

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:00.540
I've solved the problem of
democracy and polarization,

00:35:00.540 --> 00:35:01.796
and it's the library.

00:35:01.796 --> 00:35:04.170
I don't feel that way although
I will tell you something.

00:35:04.170 --> 00:35:05.790
I've traveled all
around the world

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:09.151
and spent time in the
big grand libraries

00:35:09.151 --> 00:35:10.650
but also the little
branch libraries

00:35:10.650 --> 00:35:12.000
that you find in neighborhoods.

00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:13.916
And I've certainly
traveled across the country

00:35:13.916 --> 00:35:17.310
and seeing them in rural
areas, in suburban areas,

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:20.227
in suburbs and cities and
red states and blue states,

00:35:20.227 --> 00:35:21.810
and I will tell you
that there are not

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:24.990
a lot of institutions like
them that bring people

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:27.660
from different
backgrounds together

00:35:27.660 --> 00:35:32.940
for shared activities that
are very human and very

00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:37.260
deep and very meaningful
and full of potential.

00:35:37.260 --> 00:35:41.730
And what I do think is that
there are a set of places that

00:35:41.730 --> 00:35:44.430
are vital social infrastructures
that are like libraries, places

00:35:44.430 --> 00:35:49.580
like parks and playgrounds
or athletic fields,

00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.290
our schools that are--
that open their doors

00:35:52.290 --> 00:35:54.640
and create place
for community there.

00:35:54.640 --> 00:35:56.460
Actually workplaces
can be like this, too.

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:02.282
There are places that allow us,
encourage us to come together

00:36:02.282 --> 00:36:04.365
and engage with people
that we might not otherwise

00:36:04.365 --> 00:36:06.420
engage with.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:09.510
And I don't know if you
share this experience,

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:12.630
but I find that when I'm
in a place like a library

00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:18.330
or even an athletic field or
a park and I find someone--

00:36:18.330 --> 00:36:21.060
I find myself talking to someone
or interacting with someone

00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:24.300
who has different
feelings than I do,

00:36:24.300 --> 00:36:26.820
it's a much more
peaceful disagreement

00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:30.840
than it is when I meet
someone that way on Twitter

00:36:30.840 --> 00:36:33.957
where we go from 0 to
60 very, very fast.

00:36:33.957 --> 00:36:35.790
So I've been spending
a lot of time thinking

00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:39.450
about how do we
begin to rebuild.

00:36:39.450 --> 00:36:45.990
How do we not just rebuild
after a storm, a climate event,

00:36:45.990 --> 00:36:48.840
but how do we start to rebuild
after the kinds of storms

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:52.510
that we're experiencing
in our civic life?

00:36:52.510 --> 00:36:54.660
How do we start to put
pieces together again?

00:36:54.660 --> 00:37:00.740
And I don't think that building
a library is the solution,

00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:03.950
but I don't see a
better starting point

00:37:03.950 --> 00:37:07.040
than investing in
places like libraries,

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.925
in shared places that
encourage us to come together

00:37:10.925 --> 00:37:14.980
for more peaceful interactions.

00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:19.610
I don't see any other way
to start to move forward.

00:37:19.610 --> 00:37:21.700
And one of the things
that's very interesting

00:37:21.700 --> 00:37:27.030
is to note that there are
possibilities for developing

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:30.480
social infrastructure at the
public level that involve

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:32.740
collective investment
in these projects,

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.740
and personally I don't
see a way to get out

00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:37.170
of the situation we're
in without those kinds

00:37:37.170 --> 00:37:39.010
of investments.

00:37:39.010 --> 00:37:41.900
But also there's a role
to play for philanthropy

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:43.364
and for the private
sector as well.

00:37:43.364 --> 00:37:45.780
If you think about what's going
to happen in New York City

00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.060
where we're standing over
the next several years,

00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:50.435
for instance, there's going
to be a lot of private sector

00:37:50.435 --> 00:37:54.640
investment in remaking
our neighborhoods

00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:56.490
and remaking the cityscape.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:38:00.030
And the way in which
that investment happens,

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.750
the kinds of shared
spaces that we build

00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:06.090
and whether they're
walls or bridges,

00:38:06.090 --> 00:38:09.390
is going to make a tremendous
difference for those of us

00:38:09.390 --> 00:38:13.470
who live here and want to
raise families here and try

00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:16.945
to make a neighborhood
something that's a community.

00:38:16.945 --> 00:38:18.570
Those decisions are
really significant,

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:21.195
so I'm going to start to wrap up
so we can have a conversation.

00:38:21.195 --> 00:38:25.410
But I want to wrap up
by saying the following.

00:38:25.410 --> 00:38:27.880
We keep hearing about
infrastructure week

00:38:27.880 --> 00:38:29.320
and how that's going to happen.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:31.060
The government is
rather distracted,

00:38:31.060 --> 00:38:34.140
although it's at the
moment completely closed,

00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:36.415
so infrastructure week
has not been happening.

00:38:36.415 --> 00:38:39.040
And it probably will not happen,
and it's probably a good thing

00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:41.600
that it's not going to happen
in the next couple of years.

00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.840
But at some point,
it is inevitable

00:38:43.840 --> 00:38:45.610
that we will have not
just infrastructure

00:38:45.610 --> 00:38:49.840
week but infrastructure era
because the systems that we

00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:52.930
rely on to live
in modern society

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.910
simply don't work anymore.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:56.740
And I'm saying that
to a roomful of people

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:58.810
who probably taking the
subway enough to know

00:38:58.810 --> 00:39:01.030
that that's true.

00:39:01.030 --> 00:39:04.037
But this-- systems where
you pick your system type,

00:39:04.037 --> 00:39:04.870
they're out of date.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:07.660
They were built at another
moment with different

00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:08.890
technology .

00:39:08.890 --> 00:39:10.960
They're worn down, and
they're clearly not up

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:14.290
to the kinds of challenges
we face in the 21st century.

00:39:14.290 --> 00:39:17.740
Currently the biggest
and boldest idea

00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:20.470
for infrastructure that we
have from our government

00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:22.510
is the wall.

00:39:22.510 --> 00:39:25.450
And unfortunately it's also the
most anti-social infrastructure

00:39:25.450 --> 00:39:27.717
that one could possibly imagine.

00:39:27.717 --> 00:39:28.675
It's a losing strategy.

00:39:31.570 --> 00:39:34.770
We also have a vision
for infrastructure

00:39:34.770 --> 00:39:37.010
that comes out of
the tech sector,

00:39:37.010 --> 00:39:39.805
and specifically in this
case, it comes from Facebook.

00:39:39.805 --> 00:39:42.180
I don't know if you guys are
on Mark Zuckerberg's holiday

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:46.470
mailing list like I am, but as
a member of one of his clubs,

00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:49.710
I get letters from him
occasionally after big events.

00:39:49.710 --> 00:39:52.560
And after the
election in 2016, Mark

00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:57.460
sent his 2 billion friends a
letter saying, don't worry,

00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.500
guys.

00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.480
It may be true that
the traditional meeting

00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:04.020
places that people have used
are doing less well than they

00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:10.260
used to, but Facebook is here to
be your social infrastructure.

00:40:10.260 --> 00:40:13.170
And he use that language,
and the argument

00:40:13.170 --> 00:40:18.270
was you can come to Facebook for
meaningful social interactions

00:40:18.270 --> 00:40:20.160
and meaningful community life.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.550
And the suggestion was
you guys have your devices

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:25.300
and we're really going
to help you rebuild

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:26.760
the special communities.

00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.120
I am not against the devices.

00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:32.105
I have one here.

00:40:32.105 --> 00:40:33.480
I don't like to
leave without it.

00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:36.590
It makes me uncomfortable
and nervous.

00:40:36.590 --> 00:40:38.440
I'm on all the
social media things.

00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.405
I'm not a Luddite, but I've also
been to the Facebook campus.

00:40:42.405 --> 00:40:45.030
Have any of you guys been to the
Facebook campus in Menlo Park?

00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:46.410
They probably are never
letting you guys in.

00:40:46.410 --> 00:40:47.870
There's a couple of guys.

00:40:47.870 --> 00:40:48.662
Yeah.

00:40:48.662 --> 00:40:50.620
But the Google Camp is
not that much different.

00:40:50.620 --> 00:40:54.810
Let me tell you that no living
human being has invested

00:40:54.810 --> 00:40:58.770
as much money in physical,
social infrastructure

00:40:58.770 --> 00:41:02.040
as Mark Zuckerberg,
maybe Larry and Sergei.

00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:03.720
Sorry, guys.

00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:06.590
Maybe the people running Apple.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:10.169
But Silicon Valley tech
firms understand the value

00:41:10.169 --> 00:41:11.210
of social infrastructure.

00:41:11.210 --> 00:41:13.710
Have you guys ever been outside
of this room in your office?

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:15.690
It's crazy out there.

00:41:15.690 --> 00:41:18.630
I walked by a spa
just to get here.

00:41:18.630 --> 00:41:19.890
There's free food everywhere.

00:41:19.890 --> 00:41:20.790
I started eating banana.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.664
Someone came in wanting
to massage me to make

00:41:22.664 --> 00:41:24.000
sure I was ready for coding.

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:26.710
You guys work in a
worker's paradise

00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:31.260
that's designed to make
you want to be here.

00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:34.020
It's designed to help you be as
productive as you can possibly

00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:36.030
humanly be.

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:38.580
It's designed to help
you bump into people

00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:41.670
who are brilliant and awesome
in places where you wouldn't

00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:48.950
expect to meet like over the
kale salad bar or the Sambuca

00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:49.830
Club--

00:41:49.830 --> 00:41:51.390
I don't know-- weekly meeting.

00:41:51.390 --> 00:41:53.670
Wherever it is that
you do, it's all

00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:55.260
designed so you
have the experience

00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.430
of being with each other.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.920
And it's a really dynamic
and exciting place.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.590
That's done with a
physical investment

00:42:01.590 --> 00:42:02.760
in social infrastructure.

00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:04.780
You guys can do better.

00:42:04.780 --> 00:42:07.080
And one of the really
big questions for Google

00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.360
in California-- that's
telling me it's time

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:12.210
for Q&amp;A. One of the really
good investments for Google

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:14.670
to be thinking about in
California and in New York

00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:17.310
is how do you build a
social infrastructure that

00:42:17.310 --> 00:42:20.130
works for Googlers
and that also works

00:42:20.130 --> 00:42:23.130
for the region and the
neighborhood, the city,

00:42:23.130 --> 00:42:26.064
that Google's embedded
in because I don't want

00:42:26.064 --> 00:42:27.730
my only experience
to Google being like,

00:42:27.730 --> 00:42:29.170
oh there's this whole building
that they just took over,

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.211
and I'm never going to go
in there again unless I

00:42:31.211 --> 00:42:32.640
write a book.

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.530
And then I get an
hour and a banana.

00:42:34.530 --> 00:42:39.120
So how is Google
going to contribute

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:41.980
to the social
infrastructure of New York?

00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.860
It's not fair to
say it's just going

00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:46.530
to happen with your
machine while we

00:42:46.530 --> 00:42:49.410
build these awesome
places for ourselves.

00:42:49.410 --> 00:42:51.840
And so the vision that
I'm proposing to you

00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:55.740
is a vision that takes
seriously the physical places

00:42:55.740 --> 00:42:58.080
where we live and where
we work and spend time

00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.250
with one another.

00:42:59.250 --> 00:43:02.610
And the question that I
guess I want to ask of you

00:43:02.610 --> 00:43:06.960
is to think seriously about
how Google can contribute

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:12.720
to this neighborhood and the
city or if you're in Menlo Park

00:43:12.720 --> 00:43:16.490
right now or Los
Altos or Sunnyvale

00:43:16.490 --> 00:43:21.690
or San Jose, that city,
those neighborhoods, what's

00:43:21.690 --> 00:43:23.580
Google's contribution
to our collective

00:43:23.580 --> 00:43:26.340
and shared social
infrastructure going to be?

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:30.630
To what extent are the
future social infrastructures

00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:34.320
of our world going to
look like libraries?

00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:36.865
And to what extent are they
going to look like walls?

00:43:36.865 --> 00:43:37.990
So I'm going to stop there.

00:43:37.990 --> 00:43:38.823
Thank you very much.

00:43:38.823 --> 00:43:41.524
[APPLAUSE]

00:43:45.840 --> 00:43:49.350
I think we have
time for questions.

00:43:49.350 --> 00:43:52.459
I have a mic, which I guess
I'm going to hand to you.

00:43:52.459 --> 00:43:54.000
And we-- you can
just pass it around.

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:54.920
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.884
Well, first of all,
thank you very much.

00:43:56.884 --> 00:43:58.550
It's also really great
to just watch you

00:43:58.550 --> 00:44:00.710
and not some slides while
you're giving a talk.

00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:03.080
And I play soccer
at Seward Park,

00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:05.630
and I think the whole place if
you haven't been there feels

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:08.184
a bit like a social experiment.

00:44:08.184 --> 00:44:10.100
I've never been anywhere
else in New York that

00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:13.130
has such high levels of
just social interaction

00:44:13.130 --> 00:44:14.390
and collaborate--

00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:17.180
buzzing with activity.

00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:18.080
But I wanted to ask.

00:44:18.080 --> 00:44:21.020
So I am part of the Growth
Google team as well,

00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:24.440
and we are actually this spring
opening up a physical space

00:44:24.440 --> 00:44:26.300
in our New York
office, a learning

00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:30.020
center for the community, for
partners within our community,

00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:32.360
to bring digital skills
training to the community

00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:34.710
that we're a part of.

00:44:34.710 --> 00:44:37.280
And I guess with
that idea, we're

00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:39.980
trying to open our doors
for social interaction

00:44:39.980 --> 00:44:42.770
and community
building and really

00:44:42.770 --> 00:44:47.660
being a physical
space for everything

00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:49.670
that you're speaking of.

00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:51.440
What you're advice
be to us to make sure

00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:52.954
that we do that successfully?

00:44:52.954 --> 00:44:53.870
ERIC KLINENBERG: Yeah.

00:44:53.870 --> 00:44:55.430
Well, first of all, I'm
so happy that you're

00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:56.450
going to do that
because I've been

00:44:56.450 --> 00:44:58.033
looking for someone
who would teach me

00:44:58.033 --> 00:44:59.170
how to do gifs and Twitter.

00:44:59.170 --> 00:45:00.110
AUDIENCE: We can do that.

00:45:00.110 --> 00:45:00.955
ERIC KLINENBERG: Can I get that?

00:45:00.955 --> 00:45:01.790
Do you cover that?

00:45:01.790 --> 00:45:02.430
AUDIENCE: I think so, yeah.

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:02.590
ERIC KLINENBERG: Awesome.

00:45:02.590 --> 00:45:03.290
AUDIENCE: 101.

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:07.370
ERIC KLINENBERG: So no,
look, the real issue

00:45:07.370 --> 00:45:10.190
is how do you make
sure that people

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:17.000
feel like they're genuinely
invited and wanted and welcome.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:21.200
Because I've seen this
and time after time when

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:28.010
a corporation moves in and
grudgingly puts in public space

00:45:28.010 --> 00:45:31.070
because they have to get the
proper zoning and permitting

00:45:31.070 --> 00:45:32.900
and they promise
the city they'll

00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:36.189
do that for the community but
give everyone reason to believe

00:45:36.189 --> 00:45:38.730
that they're not really wanted
there, it doesn't really work,

00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:39.710
and people read that.

00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:41.480
Or I've seen
cultural institutions

00:45:41.480 --> 00:45:43.820
like new museums and art
galleries come in and say

00:45:43.820 --> 00:45:45.720
we want to be a part
of the neighborhood,

00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:49.770
and so it's going to be free
here on Fridays from 6 to 10

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:50.270
or whatever.

00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:52.400
Every Friday's free or free
for a neighborhood and people

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:52.940
don't come.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:54.130
And then they go why--

00:45:54.130 --> 00:45:56.040
we made it free.

00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.640
Unfortunately,
often the only way

00:45:58.640 --> 00:46:01.040
you get a successful
public space in a place

00:46:01.040 --> 00:46:05.690
that is known to be
private and for insiders

00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:08.780
is if you very aggressively
do outreach and make

00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:13.330
sure that people around you
know that you really mean it,

00:46:13.330 --> 00:46:14.960
that you're really
there for them.

00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:17.001
And that means understanding
in every place where

00:46:17.001 --> 00:46:19.430
you build something like this
what are the big community

00:46:19.430 --> 00:46:20.600
organizations?

00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:23.330
Who are the local leaders?

00:46:23.330 --> 00:46:25.940
Where's their vulnerability?

00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:28.150
How can we address
some of those things?

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:32.510
There's something-- it's
not "Field of Dreams."

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:33.710
You can't just build it.

00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:35.660
You really have to do more.

00:46:35.660 --> 00:46:39.890
And where I can
see the commitment

00:46:39.890 --> 00:46:42.590
of different organizations
to that doing more

00:46:42.590 --> 00:46:45.270
is when I look at how they're
staffing those programs.

00:46:45.270 --> 00:46:46.820
Who are they hiring?

00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:49.250
How much time are they
dedicating to really making

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:50.450
those things work?

00:46:50.450 --> 00:46:53.960
And we live at a
time when I think

00:46:53.960 --> 00:46:56.510
everyone knows that you have
to walk through the motions

00:46:56.510 --> 00:47:01.670
to get some things
publicly approved,

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:04.401
but not everybody knows
that they're really wanted.

00:47:04.401 --> 00:47:05.900
And so if you come
to a neighborhood

00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.660
and you make that
genuine commitment,

00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.100
I think people
will be impressed.

00:47:10.100 --> 00:47:12.058
And I've seen companies
like Google do it well,

00:47:12.058 --> 00:47:14.909
and I've seen companies
like Google swing and miss.

00:47:14.909 --> 00:47:15.950
So I hope you do it well.

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:16.783
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:47:19.422 --> 00:47:20.950
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:23.230
I'd like to follow
up on the fact

00:47:23.230 --> 00:47:26.920
that you described we have those
wonderful workspaces at Google

00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.170
and Facebook and
that contributes

00:47:29.170 --> 00:47:31.600
to that social infrastructure.

00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.970
Those things are not easily
scalable and replicable

00:47:33.970 --> 00:47:36.000
because one, they
cost a lot of money,

00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.330
but also they're not perfect.

00:47:37.330 --> 00:47:40.210
Even in a workplace like
those tech companies,

00:47:40.210 --> 00:47:42.070
yes, we run into each
other as employees,

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:46.890
but there's a gap between us
and the people who maintains

00:47:46.890 --> 00:47:48.430
those spaces and serve us.

00:47:48.430 --> 00:47:51.740
And we don't feel like real
community in that sense.

00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:55.480
So the physical space is
not a miracle on its own.

00:47:55.480 --> 00:47:56.880
It's one ingredient.

00:47:56.880 --> 00:48:02.980
And [INAUDIBLE]---- do you
see that technology can help

00:48:02.980 --> 00:48:05.430
providing a social
infrastructure on it's own

00:48:05.430 --> 00:48:08.270
without having to
rebuild stuff around us?

00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:09.890
And, for example,
I've been living

00:48:09.890 --> 00:48:11.560
in this New York
building for 10 years

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:13.300
and I hardly know my neighbors.

00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.040
We have doors which
are separating us.

00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.990
If we take down those
doors, most likely

00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:18.614
there's going to be
a better community.

00:48:18.614 --> 00:48:22.810
But using technology can do
something to bring us together

00:48:22.810 --> 00:48:23.980
in the physical world.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.450
ERIC KLINENBERG: Very much.

00:48:25.450 --> 00:48:26.980
Absolutely.

00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.504
So I wrote this book with
a comedian about dating,

00:48:30.504 --> 00:48:32.170
and we talked a lot
about online dating.

00:48:32.170 --> 00:48:36.610
And clearly it's much easier
to find dates with Tinder

00:48:36.610 --> 00:48:40.120
than it was before Tinder
existed or OKCupid or Bumble

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.980
or whatever it is
that you're doing now.

00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:46.540
And still like some people
spend too much time online

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.457
and not enough time
dating because it's easier

00:48:48.457 --> 00:48:50.706
just to be in the phone
swiping left and right than it

00:48:50.706 --> 00:48:52.000
is to actually do the date.

00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:53.661
But do I think that
the internet can

00:48:53.661 --> 00:48:54.910
help to bring people together?

00:48:54.910 --> 00:48:55.510
Yes.

00:48:55.510 --> 00:48:57.635
Let me give you two examples
of things that I think

00:48:57.635 --> 00:48:59.550
are really awesome.

00:48:59.550 --> 00:49:01.600
For very local
neighborhood things,

00:49:01.600 --> 00:49:05.924
Next Door is a very smart--

00:49:05.924 --> 00:49:07.840
I don't know-- do I call
it an app or website?

00:49:07.840 --> 00:49:10.220
Well, I'm going
to call it an app.

00:49:10.220 --> 00:49:16.397
It's-- I like the way that it is
oriented towards helping people

00:49:16.397 --> 00:49:18.730
make connections with people
around them to solve common

00:49:18.730 --> 00:49:20.250
problems or to share.

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:24.010
And it seems to me like
it's a very effective tool.

00:49:24.010 --> 00:49:26.590
My family and I moved
to Silicon Valley

00:49:26.590 --> 00:49:29.150
a few years ago for a year.

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:31.720
And it was really striking
how much people relied on

00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:34.450
Next Door there because
the scale of the place

00:49:34.450 --> 00:49:35.620
made it work really well.

00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:40.090
Doesn't work too well on 15th
Street, but it could probably.

00:49:40.090 --> 00:49:42.070
It just be get swamped.

00:49:42.070 --> 00:49:44.560
The other thing is like last
year, very unfortunately,

00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:47.590
I had three very dear
friends get cancer.

00:49:47.590 --> 00:49:49.979
And have any of you used
this website Caring Bridge?

00:49:49.979 --> 00:49:51.520
Do you know what
Caring Bridge, which

00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:55.750
allows you to build a community
around someone's care?

00:49:55.750 --> 00:49:58.780
So someone you know
gets very sick.

00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:01.180
Someone else or
that person starts

00:50:01.180 --> 00:50:03.640
a caring bridge program
where the person can explain

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:06.010
what's going on with them or
their primary caretaker can

00:50:06.010 --> 00:50:09.310
explain or anyone who's
authorized to post can post.

00:50:09.310 --> 00:50:10.980
You can use it to
organize who's going

00:50:10.980 --> 00:50:13.900
to deliver meals, who's
going to visit the hospital,

00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:15.700
how to support one another.

00:50:15.700 --> 00:50:21.040
And I can't tell you how
powerful this website was

00:50:21.040 --> 00:50:24.730
in allowing me to understand
what my friends were going

00:50:24.730 --> 00:50:28.247
through and figure out how to
be a better friend and better

00:50:28.247 --> 00:50:29.830
supporter, not just
to the sick person

00:50:29.830 --> 00:50:33.230
but also to the people who are
on the front lines of care,

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:34.820
which can also be exhausting.

00:50:34.820 --> 00:50:37.597
And I thought that's
a genius technology.

00:50:37.597 --> 00:50:40.180
And I actually don't need to be
face to face with those people

00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:43.240
all the time, but the connection
through stories and sharing

00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:46.630
information in Caring
Bridge worked really well.

00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:48.190
Those for me like
work much better

00:50:48.190 --> 00:50:53.890
than Twitter or Instagram
or Facebook even or Google

00:50:53.890 --> 00:50:54.704
Hangouts.

00:50:54.704 --> 00:50:55.870
Do you guys still have that?

00:50:55.870 --> 00:50:57.160
I don't know.

00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:01.450
It just-- those technologies
don't work as well.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:04.570
So I think there are
cases in which not having

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:07.540
the face-to-face thing
can do a lot of good.

00:51:07.540 --> 00:51:10.630
But for the most part, what
I look for from technology

00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:16.150
is something that's going to
make it easier and more likely

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:18.830
that I will meet up with
someone face to face.

00:51:18.830 --> 00:51:22.540
And I think there's a
real value in recovering

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:26.040
that kind of face-to-face
interpersonal experience.

00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:28.900
It tends to generate a
level of depth and meaning

00:51:28.900 --> 00:51:31.540
and significance that
makes us all feel

00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:33.580
more satisfied and more human.

00:51:33.580 --> 00:51:36.930
And when we spend too much
time with our machines,

00:51:36.930 --> 00:51:39.370
I think we tend to feel
alienated from ourselves.

00:51:39.370 --> 00:51:40.810
At least that's my experience.

00:51:40.810 --> 00:51:43.180
I don't know how you
guys experience it.

00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:46.120
But everybody I know is trying
to solve the problem of how

00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:49.780
to spend less time with
their machines and more time

00:51:49.780 --> 00:51:51.559
with other people.

00:51:51.559 --> 00:51:53.100
Yeah, there's a
question in the back.

00:52:00.570 --> 00:52:02.120
AUDIENCE: Hi, Eric.

00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:04.100
I'm curious to know
what do you think

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:05.885
the role of religious
institutions

00:52:05.885 --> 00:52:09.630
are in the social
infrastructure.

00:52:09.630 --> 00:52:11.060
And then another
question related

00:52:11.060 --> 00:52:13.550
to that is do you think
there is a causal factor that

00:52:13.550 --> 00:52:15.710
is cause for the decline
in both the libraries

00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:18.297
and religious institutions?

00:52:18.297 --> 00:52:19.880
ERIC KLINENBERG: So
I do think there's

00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.410
a role for religious
organizations

00:52:21.410 --> 00:52:23.990
and for other
nonprofit organizations

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:27.230
and for for-profit organizations
and social infrastructure.

00:52:27.230 --> 00:52:29.420
I think we have such
profound deficits

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:34.970
in our social infrastructure,
and given the nature

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:40.070
of inequality, I think our
only real hope for addressing

00:52:40.070 --> 00:52:41.990
the deficiencies in
social infrastructure

00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:44.090
is to do more public investment.

00:52:44.090 --> 00:52:48.440
But that said-- and it's a
realm of democratic politics

00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:52.670
where we have some collective
say as citizens and voters.

00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:56.180
But that said, how
could you go to England

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:58.820
and not recognize
that the pub, which

00:52:58.820 --> 00:53:01.602
is a for-profit institution,
is a central part

00:53:01.602 --> 00:53:02.810
of the social infrastructure?

00:53:02.810 --> 00:53:05.101
Or how could you go to an
African-American neighborhood

00:53:05.101 --> 00:53:06.680
in Chicago where
I grew up and not

00:53:06.680 --> 00:53:11.460
see that the beauty salon or
the barbershop is a key place,

00:53:11.460 --> 00:53:15.880
and those are for-profit
institutions and the diner

00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:16.760
and things like that.

00:53:16.760 --> 00:53:19.390
Religious organizations,
classic social infrastructure.

00:53:19.390 --> 00:53:23.660
In fact the chapter in my book
that's about climate change

00:53:23.660 --> 00:53:27.170
as a problem of building a
collective to manage something

00:53:27.170 --> 00:53:30.920
collaboratively begins with the
story of an evangelical church

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.320
in Houston that made a
principled commitment

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:38.370
to be a multi-ethnic,
multiracial community.

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:43.490
And because of its
strengths and deep ties

00:53:43.490 --> 00:53:46.130
was able to do tremendous work
in the immediate aftermath

00:53:46.130 --> 00:53:49.970
of Hurricane Harvey
1 and 1/2 years ago.

00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:51.710
And so I think
religious organizations

00:53:51.710 --> 00:53:53.690
can play a central role.

00:53:53.690 --> 00:53:56.150
Now the issue with
religious organizations

00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:58.070
and also with
private sector places

00:53:58.070 --> 00:54:01.190
is that they have the
capacity to get exclusive.

00:54:01.190 --> 00:54:04.490
Some cases their exclusive
by definition, and that

00:54:04.490 --> 00:54:06.840
means they might
not serve everyone.

00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:08.756
They might help only
members of a group.

00:54:08.756 --> 00:54:10.880
And in some cases, you
might have a religious group

00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:15.160
that says principally it
will help people in its group

00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:16.610
and exclude others.

00:54:16.610 --> 00:54:18.110
It turns out this
church in Houston

00:54:18.110 --> 00:54:20.497
did the opposite even during
this event, which is great.

00:54:20.497 --> 00:54:22.580
But they're very exclusive
religious organizations

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:26.031
as we know of all varieties.

00:54:26.031 --> 00:54:27.530
And then you guys
all know the story

00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:30.160
of what happened in Starbucks in
Philadelphia this past summer.

00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:31.620
Do you remember that experience?

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:33.830
A lot of people,
it was Starbucks

00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:37.640
is a like a third space.

00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:40.730
It's practically a
public space now.

00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:43.280
Except for that in
Philadelphia this past summer,

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:48.539
these two African-American guys
went to meet a friend and--

00:54:48.539 --> 00:54:49.580
has ever happened to you?

00:54:49.580 --> 00:54:51.310
You go to a place
to meet a friend,

00:54:51.310 --> 00:54:52.310
and your friend is late.

00:54:52.310 --> 00:54:54.620
Has anyone ad that
experience ever?

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:57.470
You're like, no, that's
never happened to me.

00:54:57.470 --> 00:55:00.080
So this-- their friend is
late, and they're waiting--

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:02.520
I was just giving a talk at
a university a few weeks ago,

00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.347
and I asked the students if
they knew about the story--

00:55:05.347 --> 00:55:06.180
about what happened.

00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:08.388
And one student was like,
yeah, I know what happened.

00:55:08.388 --> 00:55:09.700
They kicked him out.

00:55:09.700 --> 00:55:12.241
And I thought to myself it would
have been such a great thing

00:55:12.241 --> 00:55:16.730
if they had just kicked
them out, if they had said,

00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:19.702
please, gentlemen,
we have a rule here

00:55:19.702 --> 00:55:22.160
that you have to order if you're
going to sit in Starbucks.

00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:25.340
So we invite you to come
and buy one of our coffees.

00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:28.600
Or worse would have been to say
I'm sorry you have to leave,

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:30.540
but instead--

00:55:30.540 --> 00:55:32.150
I'm bringing you
with me everywhere

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:35.650
I speak from now on--

00:55:35.650 --> 00:55:38.049
they said-- they
called the police.

00:55:38.049 --> 00:55:39.590
They called the
police on these guys.

00:55:39.590 --> 00:55:43.460
And it-- because it
was captured on video,

00:55:43.460 --> 00:55:46.970
it conveyed this fact that
all of us know and many of us

00:55:46.970 --> 00:55:52.040
experience which is that
private spaces, nonprofit

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:56.240
or for profit, can
be inaccessible.

00:55:56.240 --> 00:56:02.060
And in Seward Park, it's if
you don't have a credit card,

00:56:02.060 --> 00:56:03.840
you can't go to
Grumpy's for coffee.

00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:08.930
But the truth is I could be a
70-year-old Chinese immigrant

00:56:08.930 --> 00:56:12.040
or native-born person who's
lived my life in Seward Park,

00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:15.230
and I know that Mission
Chinese is not for me.

00:56:15.230 --> 00:56:18.380
And then I'm not really
wanted in Mission Chinese.

00:56:18.380 --> 00:56:21.230
The buildings themselves,
the stores, the companies,

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:25.594
they tell you who's welcome
and who's not welcome.

00:56:25.594 --> 00:56:26.510
It's very clear to us.

00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:27.968
We can all read
that kind of thing.

00:56:27.968 --> 00:56:31.490
So the trick for these
places is to make themselves

00:56:31.490 --> 00:56:35.560
as accessible as possible to
signal as much as possible

00:56:35.560 --> 00:56:36.560
that people are welcome.

00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.172
And not every place has
to be a democratic social

00:56:40.172 --> 00:56:41.630
infrastructure,
but if we want them

00:56:41.630 --> 00:56:43.860
to be like social
infrastructures,

00:56:43.860 --> 00:56:44.900
they have to do that.

00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:46.880
Is there like a
single line that's

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.630
causing the decline in
religious membership

00:56:50.630 --> 00:56:52.670
and also the decline
in libraries?

00:56:52.670 --> 00:56:55.200
I think there are
different lines probably.

00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.070
And actually religious
institutions in the US

00:56:58.070 --> 00:56:59.690
are surprisingly robust.

00:56:59.690 --> 00:57:01.820
It's that I think
church participation is

00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:04.459
probably not what it
once was, but there's

00:57:04.459 --> 00:57:06.500
a tremendous number of
people in this country who

00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:08.900
keep on going to church.

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:14.030
Libraries, I want you to know,
are buzzing with activity.

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:16.610
The library usage
rates are soaring.

00:57:16.610 --> 00:57:18.980
And it might be the case
that people don't take out

00:57:18.980 --> 00:57:22.484
books as much, but
who other than you

00:57:22.484 --> 00:57:24.650
guys who are going to be
so involved reading my book

00:57:24.650 --> 00:57:26.233
and for the next two
weeks is actually

00:57:26.233 --> 00:57:27.280
reading a book right now?

00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:29.738
People-- we live in a different
cultural moment, and people

00:57:29.738 --> 00:57:32.330
are consuming information
in different ways.

00:57:32.330 --> 00:57:35.030
But people are using libraries
in all these amazing ways

00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:36.830
that I hadn't expected.

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:40.400
So it remains a place where
early literacy education

00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:41.497
happens.

00:57:41.497 --> 00:57:43.080
And libraries are
teaching more people

00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.454
English as a second
language than

00:57:44.454 --> 00:57:46.390
any other public institution.

00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:48.300
They're doing
citizenship classes.

00:57:48.300 --> 00:57:53.300
They're providing connection and
companionship for older people.

00:57:53.300 --> 00:57:57.260
They're places where people
get free Wi-Fi access.

00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:59.330
And people learn how
to use computers.

00:57:59.330 --> 00:58:02.450
It's actually really interesting
to see how many people don't

00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:04.667
know how to do email
and go to a library

00:58:04.667 --> 00:58:06.500
and have the librarian
help them with email.

00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:08.500
But librarians are solving
all kinds of problems

00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:11.450
and enormous numbers of
people are using them in part

00:58:11.450 --> 00:58:14.660
because we haven't supported
other social infrastructures

00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:16.646
or invested enough in
other protected programs.

00:58:16.646 --> 00:58:18.770
And so if you spend time
in a neighborhood library,

00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:21.710
I think what you'll observe
is that libraries are overrun

00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:22.910
actually.

00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:25.190
And it's one reason
that I have been hoping

00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:29.712
that some great philanthropist
or political leader

00:58:29.712 --> 00:58:31.670
will make the kind of
commitment to the library

00:58:31.670 --> 00:58:34.797
that Carnegie made
100 years ago.

00:58:34.797 --> 00:58:36.380
Because we don't
have that vision yet.

00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:39.650
We have not had a compelling
leader make the case

00:58:39.650 --> 00:58:43.220
that the solution to our
crisis in civil society

00:58:43.220 --> 00:58:47.760
is to make a major
investment in shared spaces.

00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:50.810
And until that
happens, I think we're

00:58:50.810 --> 00:58:54.480
going to stay very much in
the crisis that we have now.

00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.300
Are we going to end
on that sad note?

00:58:56.300 --> 00:58:58.790
I want to end on a happier
note like free ice cream

00:58:58.790 --> 00:59:00.427
across the hall.

00:59:00.427 --> 00:59:01.760
JESSE HAINES: Thank you so much.

00:59:01.760 --> 00:59:02.885
ERIC KLINENBERG: Thank you.

00:59:02.885 --> 00:59:05.350
[APPLAUSE]
