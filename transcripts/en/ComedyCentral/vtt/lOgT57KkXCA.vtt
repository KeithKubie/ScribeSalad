00:00:05.305 --> 00:00:08.708
- We rewrote this episode
four or five times.

00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:10.576
It was really hard to
write about depression

00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:13.212
and make it funny and make it
active.

00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.615
Abbi's mom, who is played by
Peri Gilpin,

00:00:15.648 --> 00:00:18.851
most popularly known from
Fraiser, her storyline

00:00:18.884 --> 00:00:21.654
is depressing too and it
was just hard to make two

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.389
storylines about depression
funny.

00:00:23.422 --> 00:00:27.360
- The light, I mean the sad
lamp and Ilana's heightening

00:00:27.393 --> 00:00:28.928
of the sad lamp.

00:00:28.961 --> 00:00:31.064
- That was one of our
trickier episodes this year

00:00:31.097 --> 00:00:33.032
and I love it.

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:34.200
- I love it.

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:37.970
- But this depression shit,
that's next level bitchy.

00:00:38.003 --> 00:00:41.507
Kinda digging it, my dick
is a little bit hard.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.210
I hope you never get better.

00:00:44.243 --> 00:00:45.078
- Thanks.

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:49.115
Working with RuPaul
Charles was such a dream

00:00:49.148 --> 00:00:51.350
and finding out that he
just like knows the show

00:00:51.383 --> 00:00:52.585
and liked it.

00:00:52.618 --> 00:00:54.854
- He plays Marcelle who is
Alana's new boss at this

00:00:54.887 --> 00:00:56.456
restaurant she's working at.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.358
It is like a different
character for him too

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:00.893
but it also is so him.

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:04.564
I think the character is more
stern that Ru actually is.

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.732
- And also like containing
him into the manager

00:01:06.765 --> 00:01:07.800
of a restaurant.

00:01:07.833 --> 00:01:10.169
- I don't know what kind
of strong island honkies

00:01:10.202 --> 00:01:12.772
you brought up in here up
in Tanya but this is not

00:01:12.805 --> 00:01:15.975
Billy Joel's go to Dave and
Busters, okay?

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:19.712
- It was just such a
crazy like American honor

00:01:19.745 --> 00:01:22.181
to have Ru on our show.

00:01:22.214 --> 00:01:25.818
I've been watching RuPaul
on TV for my entire life

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:28.454
but to put Ru in the Broad City
world,

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:29.889
it felt so right.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.426
It felt like he's been
here the whole time.

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:34.627
- [Director] Action.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:39.098
- Kick fuck me, put your fucking
foot in my goddamn pussy.

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:39.966
You know?

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:42.902
- Let's start again.

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:48.041
(laughs) This is such a dream
come true.
