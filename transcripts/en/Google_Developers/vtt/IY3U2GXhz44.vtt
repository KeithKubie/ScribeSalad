00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.330
&gt;&gt;&gt; Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome vice
president of engineering for Google, Vic Gundotra.

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:16.250
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Well, good morning, everybody.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.700
You made it, even at this early hour.
I hope you enjoyed that party last night.

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.700
How --
[ Applause ]

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.300
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yeah?

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.460
How about that spider?
Was that cool or what?

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.760
After a few drinks, I thought that thing was
going to chase me.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:35.210
A lot of fun.
Let me also welcome the many thousands who

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.820
are watching our live stream on YouTube.
Yesterday, just for your information, we had

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.649
over 24,000 people watching it concurrently
live.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.989
So in addition to the 5,000-plus folks we
had here, we had almost 30,000 watch us yesterday.

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.120
So welcome to everyone watching on YouTube.
[ Applause ]

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:01.280
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: To begin today's keynote,
I'd like to start with a story.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.400
It's a story of my very first day on the job
at Google.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.210
Now, I'm sure you've all been at a new job.
You understand the apprehensiveness you might

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.600
feel with a new office, new people.
It was on that very first day that I met a

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.869
man named Mr. Andy Rubin.
Now, I suspect most of you know who Andy Rubin

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.520
is.
At the time, he was responsible for what was

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.729
then a secret project code-named "Android."
And on that first day, Andy enthusiastically

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:39.869
described to me the team's mission and purpose.
And as he spoke, I'll level with you, I was

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.770
skeptical.
In fact, I interrupted Andy.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.920
And I said, "Andy, I don't get it.
Does the world really need another mobile

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.289
operating system?
Google's about advertising.

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:57.690
Shouldn't we be on every phone?"
To this day, I remember Andy's response.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.939
And he made two points.
The first point Andy made was that it was

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.340
critically important to provide a free mobile
operating system, an open source operating

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.520
system, that would enable innovation at every
level of the stack.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.660
In other words, OEMs should be free to build
all kinds of devices, devices with keyboards,

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.640
without keyboards, with front-facing cameras,
two inches, three inches, four inches, that

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:29.110
operators should be able to compete on the
strength and coverage of their network, 2G,

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.860
3G, 4G, LTP, CDMA.
And that in the end, with innovation coming

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.810
at every layer, it would be the consumer who
would be able to benefit by getting the best

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.840
device and best network for them.
I remember Andy's second point.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:54.360
He argued that if Google did not act, we faced
a Draconian future, a future where one man,

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:00.100
one company, one device, one carrier would
be our only choice.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:07.000
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: That's a future we don't want.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:14.570
So if you believe in openness, if you believe
in choice, if you believe in innovation from

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:22.010
everyone, then welcome to Android.
Now, let's get started.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.640
Let's talk a little bit about the momentum
that we've achieved in 18 months.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.890
It's been a year and a half since we've started
with Android.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.290
How are we doing?
Let's do a little bit of a report card.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.880
First of all, let's demonstrate some momentum.
It's hard to believe that in only 18 months,

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.720
we've achieved over 60 compatible devices,
where your software, where your applications

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.110
can run.
And these devices are not just from, you know,

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.030
people you haven't heard of.
These are from the leading consumer electronic

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:59.600
companies in the world, Sony Ericsson, HTC,
Motorola, and many others, who are producing

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.000
devices that meet the needs of consumers.
We think this is pretty fantastic progress

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.150
in just 18 months.
Of course, it's not just the creation of the

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:13.170
devices.
It's the 21 OEMs in 48 countries and over

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:20.859
59 carriers who have joined the Android revolution.
Of course, producing devices, making them

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:27.100
available across a multitude of countries
and carriers doesn't necessarily mean that

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:32.560
we're going to see adoption.
Have users found Android to be something that

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.419
they desire?
Well, last year, we reported, late last year,

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:46.090
that we had reached a sales run rate, a daily
activation rate, of over 30,000 units a day.

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:52.889
In February, just a few months later, we announced
that our daily run rate had achieved 60,000

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:57.210
units a day.
I'm very proud to announce today that our

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.180
run rate daily activations has now passed
100,000 a day.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:06.870
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Go, Android!

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:15.249
Of course, that momentum has led to some pretty
significant milestones.

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:19.499
One of the ones we are most proud of is that
this quarter, we are now second in the United

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:23.400
States in smartphone sales, second only to
RIM.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.900
And that's pretty amazing progress in 18 months.
We're second in smartphone sales, but according

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.620
to AdMob data, we are now first this quarter
in total Web and app usage.

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.930
That's fantastic.
[ Applause ]

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:46.439
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You know, we set a crazy internal
milestone for ourselves.

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.360
The phones are being used by consumers, but
what are they being used for?

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:56.990
And we set a crazy internal goal when we shipped
turn-by-turn navigation for Android.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.060
We thought it might be possible to have a
half a billion miles navigated in the first

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:05.560
year.
In hardly six months, we've now crossed a

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.260
billion miles navigated with turn-by-turn
navigation on Android.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.280
So users just love that feature.
Thank you.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:20.419
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: There are some who say that

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:25.400
users don't use Google Search on smartphones.
Well, we're a company driven by data, not

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.990
by opinions.
And you know what the data shows?

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.349
The data shows that we've seen a 5X growth
in the past two years.

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:35.849
That's not just on Android, but that's across
all smartphone categories.

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:39.039
People love Google search.
You give them a great browser, and they do

00:06:39.039 --> 00:06:44.020
Google search, tremendous, awesome usage of
the Web on these devices.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.680
Of course, what they love is applications.
And today I'm happy to announce that we've

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.460
crossed 50,000 applications in the Android
Marketplace.

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:57.710
And, really, the credit there goes to you.
Thank you, for the 180,000 developers.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:05.689
Thank you.
The 180,000 developers who have joined the

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:09.370
Android revolution.
Really, it's your hard work that's paired

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:13.919
with the innovation that's coming from OEMs
and carriers that makes the mobile ecosystem

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:16.590
work.
We certainly couldn't have done this without

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:19.620
you.
Thank you, thank you, thank you for supporting

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:21.139
Android.
[ Applause ]

00:07:21.139 --> 00:07:24.460
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Now, let's talk about the
platform.

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.680
We've finished the section on momentum.
Let's talk about what we're doing to make

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:32.090
the Android platform continue to evolve and
get better.

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:35.580
In this section, I have over 20 demos, 22
demos, I believe.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:39.550
In order to help me with that, I'd like to
invite up on stage Matt Waddell, my partner

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:43.180
in crime here.
Many of you may remember Matt from last year.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.050
And we're going to go through a number of
demos that are going to really showcase what

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:50.909
we're doing with Android.
There are five major areas of investments

00:07:50.909 --> 00:07:57.741
that we're making in the platform.
Now, we've been quick to iterate with Android.

00:07:57.741 --> 00:08:00.979
In fact, there's been seven releases in those
18 months.

00:08:00.979 --> 00:08:07.819
And today we're announcing the next release,
Android 2.2 code-named Froyo.

00:08:07.819 --> 00:08:14.599
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: What's in Froyo?

00:08:14.599 --> 00:08:20.270
Let's talk about five pillars.
Number one, let's begin with speed.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:27.639
Now, as you developers know, the Android architecture
is one that's built upon a virtual machine,

00:08:27.639 --> 00:08:30.319
the Dalvik virtual machine.
We think it's important.

00:08:30.319 --> 00:08:36.450
It's a critical design decision that we made
that future-proofs your application.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:41.450
We have big dreams for Android.
And part of those dreams mean that Android

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.810
will go to new places with new chip architectures.
But by having your applications write to the

00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:52.790
virtual machine, we believe we can carry the
entire ecosystem to exciting new areas.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:58.410
Of course, that only works if the virtual
machine is fast and the Dalvik VM has done

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.500
its job being fast, efficient, and automatic
and easy for developers.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.521
But we can do even better.
We're very proud to announce that in Froyo,

00:09:06.521 --> 00:09:12.950
we've added a JIT, a just-in-time compiler,
this gives up to two to five X speedup of

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:17.760
your apps on the exact same hardware.
Now, this is best demonstrated.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.930
And let's do that.
Let's go to our first demo.

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:24.830
We're going to show you a game.
The game has been modified for purposes of

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.790
this demo.
You guys may know Replica Island.

00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:32.180
Here's what we've done to modify the game.
The game now will show the frame rate that

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:37.130
it's rendering in the bottom right-hand corner.
If the frame rate drops beneath 30 frames

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:42.550
a second, the screen will Flash red.
Exact same hardware, exact same game, top

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:46.070
is running Froyo with JIT compilation, the
bottom is running Eclair.

00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:49.550
We're going to introduce a crazy number of
monsters into this game.

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:54.330
You see the monsters keep getting added, increasing
the complexity.

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:58.880
You see the frame rate at the top.
As we add complexity, it starts to slow down.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:02.250
You'll note there at the bottom, there are
times when we're dropping beneath 30 frame

00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.660
a second and it's flashing red.
You'll note at the top, with Froyo, exactly

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:12.300
the same game runs much better, never dropping
beneath 30 frames a second, all because of

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:14.090
the JIT compiler.
All right.

00:10:14.090 --> 00:10:19.340
Let's go back to slides.
[ Applause ]

00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:28.500
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Now, as Android adoption has
skyrocketed, people have been taking these

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:33.100
devices to work.
And we've heard loud and clear from the enterprise

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:39.000
that they need very specific features.
Well, in Froyo, we introduce over 20 new features

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.200
designed to meet the needs of enterprise.
Let me touch on two of them.

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.890
Number one, we become Microsoft exchange friendly.
That means --

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:49.820
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yes, thank you.

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:55.000
That means things like auto-discovery, integration
with the global address book, the security

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.100
policies that are available in Exchange can
be forced upon the device.

00:10:59.100 --> 00:11:02.810
Number two, we've added new APIs for device
management.

00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:08.260
So you can build software that does critically
important things, like remote wipe of the

00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:11.330
device if necessary.
And there's many, many other things that we've

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:18.560
added that you'll see in the documentation.
Let's talk about new services available for

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.930
developers in the SDK.
Now, one of the first services I want to talk

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:30.220
about is the application data backup API.
Now, if you use Android and you've gone to

00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:34.860
another device, you know that Android will
automatically back up your applications.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:38.760
In other words, you get a new device, you
log in, and your applications come along with

00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:42.280
that.
However, what Android has not done is backed

00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:48.990
up the data associated with those applications.
So, for example, I have a particularly favorite

00:11:48.990 --> 00:11:52.350
application that helps me monitor my exercise
and my weight.

00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:57.700
But when I move to a new Android device, the
application moves, but all my personal data

00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.230
and history doesn't.
Starting with Froyo, we'll provide an application

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:06.970
data backup API that ISVs can take advantage
of and move the data along with the application.

00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:14.220
We think that's a great feature.
In addition to that, we have a brand-new API,

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:20.210
a cloud-to-device messaging API.
Let me be clear, this is not a push notification

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:25.390
API designed to compensate for the lack of
basic functionality like multitasking in the

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:27.320
operating system.
[ Laughter ]

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:31.160
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Okay?
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:36.060
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: We've done something very
clever I think you're going to love.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:41.350
As a developer, you can send a message to
our servers which will do very smart things,

00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:46.700
like collapse similar messages, our servers,
which will optimize for the latency of mobile

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:50.460
networks and make sure that that message gets
down to the device.

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:54.180
But that's only the first step.
We've done deep integration with Android such

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:59.860
that when you send a message, that message
can trigger an Android intent.

00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:06.350
Let me show you how powerful this is.
Let's go to a demo.

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:10.880
Now, what Matt has on the screen here on his
laptop is Google Maps.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.860
He's -- in Google Maps -- and he's using the
Chrome browser.

00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:19.470
And he's added a Chrome extension.
The Chrome extension is in the upper right-hand

00:13:19.470 --> 00:13:21.690
corner.
That sends it to his phone.

00:13:21.690 --> 00:13:26.440
In the map, he has directions, he has directions
from the Moscone Center to Google headquarters.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:29.800
And he wants to send that to the phone.
What do you think happens?

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:32.800
Do you think we send a text message that says,
"This is the address"?

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.110
Do you think we send an e-mail?
No.

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:39.020
We send Android intent.
In other words, when he says send to phone,

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:41.810
the message gets sent to our server, gets
pushed down to the device.

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:47.470
The device kicks into navigation mode automatically.
Keep your eye when he clicks on "send to phone,"

00:13:47.470 --> 00:13:53.480
keep your eye on the Android device.
So send it to phone.

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.420
And on the Android device, boom, right into
navigation.

00:13:56.420 --> 00:14:04.340
How hot is that?
[ Applause ]

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:06.750
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: That's how you do a device,
cloud-to-device API.

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:12.440
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Let me show you another example.

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.790
You're reading an article on the desktop.
You think it's awesome, but you're out of

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.930
time and you need to run.
You want to keep reading that on the Android

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:22.910
phone.
Why don't you send that to the device, Matt.

00:14:22.910 --> 00:14:30.530
To the device.
Opens up the browser, takes you right to that

00:14:30.530 --> 00:14:34.190
article, not ever having to press any other
keys.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:36.200
Isn't that great?
[ Applause ]

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:43.600
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: We can't wait to see what
you're going to go do with this API.

00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:50.580
All right.
Let's go back to slides.

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:55.280
You're going to love this.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:04.250
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I mean, come on.
If you're like me, you have a plethora of

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.550
devices you carry around with you.
And that -- all those devices shouldn't mean

00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:12.080
added complexity and yet another bill.
Right?

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:16.250
You should be able to, at the platform level,
enable tethering.

00:15:16.250 --> 00:15:22.110
And so now your Android device can in fact
become a portable hot spot and really serve

00:15:22.110 --> 00:15:24.160
the needs of these other devices that you
might have with you.

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:31.390
In fact, let's show you a demo of this working.
Matt has a Nexus One running Froyo.

00:15:31.390 --> 00:15:34.280
He'll go right into tethering and portable
hot spot.

00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:37.560
He'll enable the hot spot.
He'll give it a name.

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.200
In fact, I think he's already named this as
Android AP.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.520
And that hot spot will turn on.
We'll give it a second there.

00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:47.860
There we go.
Tethering hot spot is now active.

00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.050
Now he'll go to another device that doesn't
have connectivity.

00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:53.790
How about that iPad?
[ Laughter ]

00:15:53.790 --> 00:16:00.490
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: And there you go.

00:16:00.490 --> 00:16:02.570
One bill.
Isn't that beautiful?

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:03.790
All right.
Let's go back to slides.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:18.200
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Now, it turns out, do you

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.570
know what the most popular thing people do
with these smartphones?

00:16:22.570 --> 00:16:25.260
What do you think it is?
It's fairly obvious.

00:16:25.260 --> 00:16:30.230
Is they actually use the phone.
Number two thing they do is, they do text

00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:34.140
messaging.
And the third most-used application is the

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.830
browser.
And so it's critically important for us to

00:16:37.830 --> 00:16:43.510
make the Android browser rock.
And we're going to constantly improve that

00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.810
browser.
And Froyo is a major step in that direction.

00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:50.040
What have we done in Froyo?
Well, I think you're going to love this.

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:53.420
We have a two to three X performance in the
browser?

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:57.030
How?
We took the same JavaScript interpreter that

00:16:57.030 --> 00:17:02.870
we had in Chrome that made Chrome so fast,
V8, and we brought that into Froyo.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:07.970
Now, the best way to show you how much of
an advance we've made is to do a demo.

00:17:07.970 --> 00:17:12.929
So let's go and show you this fantastic performance
boost.

00:17:12.929 --> 00:17:15.189
Now, we're going to do this demo with a number
of devices.

00:17:15.189 --> 00:17:16.579
We're going to do it --
&gt;&gt;&gt; Two devices.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:20.079
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: We're going to do this demo
 -- three devices.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:24.949
We're going to do this demo with Froyo, Eclair,
and an iPad.

00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:30.509
Now, here's the demo we're going to do.
There's an industry-standard test, in fact,

00:17:30.509 --> 00:17:37.830
there's -- it's a suite of 26 tests, the SunSpider
test, that really exercise JavaScript performance

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:41.999
of all kinds.
And when Matt presses "start" across these

00:17:41.999 --> 00:17:46.450
three devices, we're going to exercise each
one of these 26 tests.

00:17:46.450 --> 00:17:52.429
As we complete one test, that little Android
robot will take one breast stroke forward.

00:17:52.429 --> 00:17:57.299
And as all 26 tests are complete, we're going
to complete an entire lap.

00:17:57.299 --> 00:17:59.570
How are we going to go do here?
Let's go ahead and start this test.

00:17:59.570 --> 00:18:02.240
Let's what happens.
Oh, you started the iPad first, trying to

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.980
give it a little bit of a lead here, huh?
[ Laughter ]

00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:07.809
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You can cheer.

00:18:07.809 --> 00:18:17.039
It's great.
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:18:17.039 --> 00:18:25.999
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I really wonder if we'll be
able to get that in the app store.

00:18:25.999 --> 00:18:32.029
It's a Web app, how great is that?
All right.

00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:43.499
Let's go back to slides.
We think with the performance improvements

00:18:43.499 --> 00:18:48.659
that we just showed you that we can claim
that Froyo has the world's fastest mobile

00:18:48.659 --> 00:18:55.950
browser. And that's a pretty great accomplishment,
one we are extremely proud of. We're not done.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:19:01.419
I showed you what's in Froyo, but make no
mistake about our commitment to maintain leadership

00:19:01.419 --> 00:19:06.480
in the browser on Android. And one of the
ways we are doing that is to have standards

00:19:06.480 --> 00:19:13.700
bodies to enable Web developers to get capabilities
that were formerly only limited to the native

00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:18.059
access to the platform.
What kind of capabilities? Think about the

00:19:18.059 --> 00:19:23.850
kinds of things you can access on a device,
things like the magnetometer, the accelerometer.

00:19:23.850 --> 00:19:28.340
Think about things like the camera or being
able to access speech. Wouldn't this be great

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:33.379
if you could access this from the browser.
We are going to show you a sneak peek at something

00:19:33.379 --> 00:19:38.580
beyond Froyo, an early development build that
will give you a flavor of where we're going

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:40.840
next.
Let's go back to demos.

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:45.679
Now, remember, we already got some of this
work under way. Last year we worked with the

00:19:45.679 --> 00:19:49.710
standards committees to introduce geo location
into the browser, and today almost in all

00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:55.360
major modern platforms, you can make an API
call from the browser, get location with the

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:59.600
user's permission, and then do a feature like
My Location right within the browser.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:07.850
But we want to do more. How about the accelerometer.
What about access to tilt in the direction

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:12.570
of the device?
Watch this.

00:20:12.570 --> 00:20:15.070
Isn't that great? Right within the browser.
[ Applause ]

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:21.020
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: All right.
Now, another key feature that we have heard

00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.970
from developers that they want access to in
the browser is the camera.

00:20:24.970 --> 00:20:30.470
Here, for examples the Buzz Web application.
We'd love to not only post a Buzz but we would

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:35.059
love to be able to include a picture. How
do you access the camera from the Web browser?

00:20:35.059 --> 00:20:39.570
In this development build we built those APIs
right into the Web browser such that Matt

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:45.600
can now simply select, if he wants to -- and
it looks like in this case this demo is not

00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:49.499
going to work. We will give it one shot, and
we will move on if it doesn't work -- but

00:20:49.499 --> 00:20:54.200
you can access that camera capability right
from within the browser.

00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.490
And we will show you that in the sandbox later.
It's great.

00:20:56.490 --> 00:21:00.529
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Let's talk about another capability

00:21:00.529 --> 00:21:04.029
that's available.
But before we talk about that capability,

00:21:04.029 --> 00:21:10.520
let me remind you of what's possible in Android.
Google, starting about several years ago,

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:16.899
really made a deep investment in voice recognition.
We recognized that the mobile device, because

00:21:16.899 --> 00:21:22.649
of its limited input capability, would be
the platform in which people used voice input

00:21:22.649 --> 00:21:26.860
more than any other platform.
In fact, we see a stunning number of queries

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:30.889
being done on mobile devices where the input
is a human voice.

00:21:30.889 --> 00:21:36.220
Now, just as a reminder of how fantastic our
capability has become over the past two years,

00:21:36.220 --> 00:21:41.749
let me do a few demos. Or more accurately,
Matt, why don't you highlight a few cases.

00:21:41.749 --> 00:21:52.330
&gt;&gt;Matt: Pictures of Barack Obama with the
French President at the G8 summit.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.549
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: That's a tough one. Boom!
Look at that!

00:21:54.549 --> 00:22:02.169
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Because this is so fun, let's

00:22:02.169 --> 00:22:06.450
do a few more.
&gt;&gt;Matt: Pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge

00:22:06.450 --> 00:22:09.440
at sunset.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: These are queries you are

00:22:09.440 --> 00:22:13.559
likely not to type in let alone get a response
back in a few seconds. Isn't that great?

00:22:13.559 --> 00:22:14.799
And one more.
[ Applause ]

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:23.100
&gt;&gt;Matt: Del Dotto Vineyards, Napa.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: My favorite vineyard in Napa.

00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:27.690
Boom.
What Matt just showed you was phenomenal voice

00:22:27.690 --> 00:22:35.659
recognition that we are now shipping in Japanese,
English, a number of languages, and that's

00:22:35.659 --> 00:22:40.899
constantly increasing, but what is coming
next is the also the ability to understand

00:22:40.899 --> 00:22:45.850
human intentions. We will give you a very
simple sneak peek at the kinds of things we

00:22:45.850 --> 00:22:52.230
are going to enable.
&gt;&gt;Matt: Call fifth floor restaurant.

00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:58.820
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: So in this case, because he
said "call," it got a trigger. And there are

00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:02.580
many, many more intentions we are going to
build in and make it very, very simple for

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:08.389
to you use voice input as a first class way
to interact with your Android device.

00:23:08.389 --> 00:23:12.000
&gt;&gt;Matt: Vic, we have got it.
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Let's go back to the camera

00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:16.769
and see if this thing works. This is a Web
app. It's a Buzz Web app. There is the camera.

00:23:16.769 --> 00:23:21.779
From the browser, boom! Right into the camera.
Isn't that great? And now you can post a picture

00:23:21.779 --> 00:23:26.510
and give Web developers the same type of capabilities
you would expect in a native application.

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:31.690
Glad that worked. No need for you guys to
visit the sandbox.

00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:35.299
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Getting back to the speech

00:23:35.299 --> 00:23:40.809
demonstration, what we showed you was capability
that we make available to developers, but

00:23:40.809 --> 00:23:45.260
what about accessing that capability from
the browser? Here is a Web app.

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:51.529
It is a translate app from Google with one
new feature. You will note the microphone

00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:54.850
right there at the top. Matt, if you could
just point to the microphone. There it is.

00:23:54.850 --> 00:24:09.429
And watch what Matt does.
&gt;&gt;Matt: Can you help me find the nearest hospital?

00:24:09.429 --> 00:24:13.909
&gt;&gt;&gt; (repeating in French).
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Awesome! Awesome!

00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:17.070
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: All right. Let's go back to

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:25.950
slides.
Now, we're not only committed to making sure

00:24:25.950 --> 00:24:29.419
that Android -- You can clap. I will let you
clap.

00:24:29.419 --> 00:24:32.940
[ Applause ]
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:24:32.940 --> 00:24:38.909
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You know, I love it when I
don't even have to speak to a slide and we

00:24:38.909 --> 00:24:40.029
just get applause.
[ Laughter ]

00:24:40.029 --> 00:24:44.279
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I am so tempted to go on.
But let me just make a point here. We are

00:24:44.279 --> 00:24:50.210
not only committed to having the world's fastest
browser. We're committed to having the world's

00:24:50.210 --> 00:24:54.789
most comprehensive browser.
It turns out that on the Internet, people

00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:56.720
use Flash!
[ Laughter ]

00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.830
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: And part of being open means

00:25:01.830 --> 00:25:07.669
you are inclusive, rather than exclusive.
And you are open to innovation.

00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:14.080
You know, this was driven home to me very
powerfully when my daughter picked up my iPad

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:18.659
and went to her favorite Web site, Web site
nickelodeon, and this is what she saw on the

00:25:18.659 --> 00:25:25.529
iPad.
Can we switch to the iPad? A sea of orange!

00:25:25.529 --> 00:25:30.239
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: She said, "Daddy, can I play

00:25:30.239 --> 00:25:34.360
with your Android device?" And this is what
she saw.

00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:39.529
The full nickelodeon site. Isn't that great?
That's what openness means.

00:25:39.529 --> 00:25:44.749
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: And by the way, a special

00:25:44.749 --> 00:25:49.999
thanks to Adobe for their incredible willingness
to work with us, engage with us on Android

00:25:49.999 --> 00:25:54.419
and in chrome and in many other areas. It's
really fun to work with other folks in the

00:25:54.419 --> 00:26:01.450
ecosystem to meet the needs of users.
Much nicer than just saying no.

00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:04.659
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: All right. Let's go back to

00:26:04.659 --> 00:26:13.899
slides.
Now, we have also made significant improvements

00:26:13.899 --> 00:26:19.059
in the Android Marketplace.
We listened carefully to the feedback we have

00:26:19.059 --> 00:26:23.420
gotten from developers and from users, and
I think you are going to like the enhancements.

00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:28.739
Let's talk about what we have done on average,
our data shows that our users are installing

00:26:28.739 --> 00:26:35.169
more than 40 apps on their Android device,
so finding those apps is a challenge. Also

00:26:35.169 --> 00:26:39.400
they want to search within the data of those
apps, they want to move those apps to the

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:46.830
SD card, and they want to update all without
having to update each individual app by themselves.

00:26:46.830 --> 00:26:51.220
Let me show you through a series of demos
what we have done here. Let's go to demos.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:55.440
The first demonstration we are going to show
you is just searching the apps. Now with the

00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:59.059
Quick Search box we make it trivially easy
to scope it to apps. As soon as you start

00:26:59.059 --> 00:27:02.549
typing a letter, the app you are looking for
just comes up.

00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:08.080
It's a simple and easy way to go find apps.
Not only can you find apps, but we have improved

00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:14.249
the Quick Search box so developers can plug
into the search framework. In that case that

00:27:14.249 --> 00:27:20.200
icon is for Mint. Mint is a financial application,
and now you are searching within the data

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.659
of that application bringing up your financial
records.

00:27:23.659 --> 00:27:27.929
We think developers are going to extend this
in all sorts of exciting ways, making not

00:27:27.929 --> 00:27:33.600
only Android more usable, but their own applications
be surface, discoverable, and more fun and

00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.249
engaging for the user.
Another issue we have heard is people want

00:27:38.249 --> 00:27:42.879
to take advantage of the openness of Android,
the ability for you to plug in an SD card

00:27:42.879 --> 00:27:46.509
with arbitrary amounts of memory. And they
want to move apps not just in the internal

00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:52.029
memory but off to the SD card.
Two points. We've enabled that capability

00:27:52.029 --> 00:27:57.639
in a secure way with Froyo, but we have also
made it so the user never has to worry about

00:27:57.639 --> 00:28:02.470
it. When they install an application, we will
intelligently look at the space and if appropriate,

00:28:02.470 --> 00:28:08.869
move it to the SD card. If the user wants
to get involved and manually move things around,

00:28:08.869 --> 00:28:13.169
that's what this demonstration shows. In this
case, Matt is going to take a brand-new game,

00:28:13.169 --> 00:28:18.529
Need for Speed, and he is going to shift that
game from the internal memory onto the SD

00:28:18.529 --> 00:28:23.870
card. There you go. The whole 50 megabytes
is being moved over. Why don't we just start

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:27.359
the game. Why don't you launch that game.
You can see it's on the SD card.

00:28:27.359 --> 00:28:36.220
Why don't you launch that game. Isn't that
awesome? Great new game, Need for Speed, and

00:28:36.220 --> 00:28:39.210
it can live on your SD card.
Okay. Let's move on.

00:28:39.210 --> 00:28:45.169
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Matt, Matt, we have got to

00:28:45.169 --> 00:28:49.419
go. I know the game is fun.
All right. Let's go into the marketplace and

00:28:49.419 --> 00:28:53.350
talk about....
[ Laughter ]

00:28:53.350 --> 00:29:00.179
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: All right. Let's talk about
update all functionality.

00:29:00.179 --> 00:29:01.789
Matt, that's you.
[ Laughter ]

00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:08.499
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: He is easily distracted.
All right. Today, you have to update each

00:29:08.499 --> 00:29:13.960
application individually. In Froyo, we have
made it simple. At the bottom of the Android

00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:16.000
Marketplace you see the update all button.
[ Applause ]

00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:24.799
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: I am kind of embarrassed you
have to clap on that. We're glad it's there.

00:29:24.799 --> 00:29:30.270
We have gone one step further with Froyo.
Why should the user have to take any action?

00:29:30.270 --> 00:29:34.919
Starting with Froyo, with the user's permission
you can allow automatic updating, and all

00:29:34.919 --> 00:29:39.379
your apps are updated all the time. Isn't
that great?

00:29:39.379 --> 00:29:42.679
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: And the user doesn't have

00:29:42.679 --> 00:29:51.090
to worry about this at all.
Let's go back to slides.

00:29:51.090 --> 00:29:56.320
Another key feature we're adding in Froyo
is designed to meet the needs of developers.

00:29:56.320 --> 00:30:01.869
We want the best apps on Android, the highest
quality apps. And that means we need to close

00:30:01.869 --> 00:30:05.789
the loop when there's a problem.
Let's go back to a demonstration here, and

00:30:05.789 --> 00:30:11.309
I am going to show you an app called crashy.
It does exactly that really well. Matt, why

00:30:11.309 --> 00:30:17.919
don't you start the app, and it crashed.
Note there's a button there called Report.

00:30:17.919 --> 00:30:24.669
The user can press Report, can provide a description
of what happened. They can look at all the

00:30:24.669 --> 00:30:29.510
data they are going to send, make sure they
are comfortable with that data and they can

00:30:29.510 --> 00:30:35.179
hit send. And that is sent back to the developer.
Note on this screen the Android Marketplace,

00:30:35.179 --> 00:30:42.020
note a brand-new tab, "Bugs." And when you
click on bugs we will show you those reports

00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:46.639
for your application, and we will show you
the entire stack trace of what happened.

00:30:46.639 --> 00:30:57.960
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: We thought you might like

00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.360
that. And closing the loop, allowing apps
to get better and better.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:12.070
All right. Let's go back to slides.
I want to go a little bit beyond Froyo and

00:31:12.070 --> 00:31:17.340
show you a sneak peek at other exciting things
that we are doing in the Android Marketplace.

00:31:17.340 --> 00:31:21.509
I think you are going to like some of these
things. Let's go back to demo.

00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:27.350
Matt is now showing you the Android Marketplace,
except this is unlike anything you have ever

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:32.460
seen before. It's the Android Marketplace
accessible from a browser on a PC, and that's

00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:39.840
great.
Matt can browse apps, he can look at reviews,

00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:44.220
but you will look up in the upper right-hand
corner, Matt is signed in, and because he

00:31:44.220 --> 00:31:48.049
is signed in, we know every Android device
that he has.

00:31:48.049 --> 00:31:53.950
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yeah, he is a little weird.

00:31:53.950 --> 00:31:58.739
In this case, the device that he has on the
stage, he has selected at nutter butter, nutty

00:31:58.739 --> 00:32:03.820
buddy, something. Like I said, he is weird.
He has got his phone selected, and so now

00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:08.499
he can go browse a particular app. He is going
to find an app he likes like Open Table. Hold

00:32:08.499 --> 00:32:13.919
on, hold on Matt. He is going to hit free
and he is going to go and download the app.

00:32:13.919 --> 00:32:18.879
What do you think happens? Let's see, what
happens today on some other systems. You find

00:32:18.879 --> 00:32:25.070
the app, you download it to your PC or Mac.
You then have to tether your device. Once

00:32:25.070 --> 00:32:30.049
it's on your PC, you have to then convert
it over that tethering to your device and

00:32:30.049 --> 00:32:35.730
then make that sync happen. Well, guess what?
We discovered something really cool. It's

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:38.390
called the Internet.
[ Laughter ]

00:32:38.390 --> 00:32:45.529
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: And when Matt presses download,
keep your eye on the Android device.

00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:57.059
[ Applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Over the air.

00:32:57.059 --> 00:33:02.779
Isn't that totally great? Over the air, installed
on your device.

00:33:02.779 --> 00:33:06.960
Now, it turns out it's called the Android
 -- or the Marketplace because it's more than

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:11.080
apps. In fact, what we are about to show you
is a new category.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:20.549
How about some music?
Matt, why don't you find an album or song

00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:29.019
you like, and why don't you just send it to
the device using the Internet, over the air.

00:33:29.019 --> 00:33:33.840
And boom, keep your eye on the Android device.
There you go. There is the music coming right

00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:40.450
on down.
[ Cheering and Applause ]

00:33:40.450 --> 00:33:48.489
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Now, we're not done yet. Some
of you may be thinking this is really cool,

00:33:48.489 --> 00:33:54.190
this is so hot, but I have my music already
on my device at home, my Windows media or

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:59.669
my iTunes library. I have thousands of songs
there. What do I do with those?

00:33:59.669 --> 00:34:04.769
We recently acquired a company called Simplified
Media and it is our intention to incorporate

00:34:04.769 --> 00:34:09.120
that technology into the marketplace as well
and that allows you at home to run a simple

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:13.669
piece of hardware that makes all your non-DRM
music available to your Android device. Would

00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:17.330
you like to see this? Let's go to your Android
device.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:24.649
Android device has two songs on it. That's
nice, but I want more than two songs. I want

00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:29.109
all my music I have.
So Matt will go down and select -- I guess

00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:32.809
he has to plug in the device so you can hear
it.

00:34:32.809 --> 00:34:39.069
&gt;&gt;&gt; Options, touch nine. Thank you for calling
the fifth floor restaurant.

00:34:39.069 --> 00:34:43.479
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: My God!
[ Applause ]

00:34:43.479 --> 00:34:48.419
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Let me offer a public apology.

00:34:48.419 --> 00:34:49.419
Now.
[ Laughter ]

00:34:49.419 --> 00:34:55.540
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: You know what's really odd?
Is that they didn't pick up all that time.

00:34:55.540 --> 00:34:58.609
[ Laughter ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Wow!

00:34:58.609 --> 00:35:03.160
Getting back to music. Two songs. I want all
my music. He is going to select that button

00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:07.240
that says all, and magically, all the music
is now available.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:13.059
Now, you might be wondering what just happened?
We are making your whole music library available

00:35:13.059 --> 00:35:18.450
to your Android device as a stream. So, for
example, if Matt was to select a particular

00:35:18.450 --> 00:35:26.220
song, I guess Matt's an Earth, Wind and Fire
fan, hit play. Will this work?

00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:29.960
(music playing).
[ Applause ]

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:44.410
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Yeah, we think users are going
to love this feature.

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:58.250
All right. Let's go back to slides.
Let's talk a little bit about advertising.

00:35:58.250 --> 00:36:05.750
It turns out that we know a little bit about
advertising. Today happens or this year happens

00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:11.680
to be Google's tenth anniversary of providing
advertising solutions. And we have learned

00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:16.410
a few things in that decade.
One of the foremost things we have learned

00:36:16.410 --> 00:36:22.780
is if you want to have a healthy ecosystem
of advertising, you need advertisers. And

00:36:22.780 --> 00:36:28.930
we have hundreds of thousands of them.
That means if you have an ad spot, we have

00:36:28.930 --> 00:36:33.230
a relevant ad that can fill it. It's called
inventory.

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:37.660
We're not new at this game. We're not working
with a handful of partners and charging them

00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:40.520
a million dollars each to be a part of our
program.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:46.329
Okay? So we can be your advertising partner.
We have also learned something else in that

00:36:46.329 --> 00:36:52.530
decade. That advertisers and accomplishers
have different kinds of needs.

00:36:52.530 --> 00:36:58.150
There are local advertisers, there's direct
response advertisers, there are brand advertisers.

00:36:58.150 --> 00:37:04.970
And if you want to play, you need formats
that meet the needs of those kinds of advertisers.

00:37:04.970 --> 00:37:09.480
And we have those formats.
A third thing that we have learned, advertising

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:15.230
needs to be measured. And that means it needs
to have great tools.

00:37:15.230 --> 00:37:18.840
Why does it need to be measured? Well, you
need to know if the money you are spending

00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.020
is giving you a return on the investment.
You need to know which campaigns are working

00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:25.700
so you can invest more in them or tweak them
as necessary.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:32.240
And it turns out that we have some tools you
might have heard of called DoubleClick, analytics,

00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:41.660
AdSense, AdWords? The tools the industry knows
and loves are being used seamlessly to work

00:37:41.660 --> 00:37:44.520
in the mobile environment.
And finally, we know it's important to be

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:47.310
open to innovation.
Now, I don't even know what the ponies have

00:37:47.310 --> 00:37:53.369
to do with this slide, but part of being open
is when you get a designer who gives you a

00:37:53.369 --> 00:37:55.049
slide, you go with it.
[ Laughter ]

00:37:55.049 --> 00:38:04.569
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Let's show you each one of
these four points and go to demos.

00:38:04.569 --> 00:38:09.210
Now, these are real advertisers and real applications.
Let me make that point clear. You are looking

00:38:09.210 --> 00:38:14.150
at Backgrounds. One of the most popular applications
available in the Android Marketplace.

00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:19.630
At the top, you are looking at a Google ad.
Our ad program, which has been available only

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:25.380
to a limited number of beta participants,
is called AdSense for Mobile Apps, AFMA, and

00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:29.800
you are looking at one of those AFMA ads.
You are looking at our large inventory of

00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:35.450
text ads being optimized and served on that
device. We are taking advantage of the small

00:38:35.450 --> 00:38:40.010
space we have and you are seeing the nice
rotation. That's just one ad format. What

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:44.559
happens if Matt selects something like beaches?
Then we can serve a contextually relevant

00:38:44.559 --> 00:38:51.950
ad. In this case, Kayak is a popular Web site,
an application for travel. But in this case

00:38:51.950 --> 00:38:57.180
when you click on the ad, we take you to deep
within the Android Marketplace so the user

00:38:57.180 --> 00:39:01.690
can download the app. That's another important
ad format.

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:07.500
Let's show you another format.
This is a third format for brand advertising.

00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:12.670
In other words, a banner ad where an advertiser
has decided to convey their message through

00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:16.809
an image. We support that.
How about another category, and this is something

00:39:16.809 --> 00:39:22.170
that we are announcing available today, and
that's an expandable ad format.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:26.039
One of the things that we have seen through
our research is that users, if at all possible,

00:39:26.039 --> 00:39:29.289
would like to stay within the context of the
application they are using.

00:39:29.289 --> 00:39:35.660
So in this case, when Matt selects that Volkswagen
ad, it expands right out, you can look at

00:39:35.660 --> 00:39:40.180
that ad and when he is done with it he can
simply make it slide right back in.

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.630
We think that's great for advertisers, and
we think that's great for users.

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:47.890
That expandable format is available today.
Let me show you another brand-new one we are

00:39:47.890 --> 00:39:52.430
making available today. This is an expandable
ad format. This is a Flixter application.

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:58.690
Why don't you expand that ad out. In this
case it's not just display; it's rich media.

00:39:58.690 --> 00:40:04.390
He is linking directly to a trailer. He clicked
on it and the trailer will begin and the movie

00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:09.940
will go ahead and start.
Matt, don't watch the movie. Let's come back.

00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:19.210
Let me show you another ad format. This is
also an expandable ad format, but in this

00:40:19.210 --> 00:40:24.250
case, this expandable ad format has -- I'm
sorry, in this case -- I jumped ahead of you.

00:40:24.250 --> 00:40:26.990
Let's go back to the other one.
In this case I am going to show you a very

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:33.210
popular ad format that has been testing incredibly
well. This is a click-to-call ad.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:36.529
In this case we are leveraging the fact that
the user has given us permission to use their

00:40:36.529 --> 00:40:42.280
location. We know that they are in San Francisco,
and DirecTV would like to make a special offer

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.829
to customers in San Francisco and they have
a new click-to-call option. So simply clicking

00:40:46.829 --> 00:40:52.589
on that button on that ad allows the customer
to make that phone call to DirecTV, and that's

00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:55.990
incredibly valuable.
Let me talk about another format. This is

00:40:55.990 --> 00:41:02.970
an expandable format with a clever twist.
Matt, expand that one out. It includes a map

00:41:02.970 --> 00:41:07.849
and directions and click-to-call. Isn't that
great? That's a new format that will become

00:41:07.849 --> 00:41:13.690
shortly available as well.
Okay. Finally, let me show what you I meant

00:41:13.690 --> 00:41:19.160
when I said open to innovation.
This is the weather.com application, and they

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:24.130
are using the industry standard DoubleClick
software to serve this ad from Google.

00:41:24.130 --> 00:41:27.829
The ad is at the bottom.
Now, when Matt clicks on that ad, you get

00:41:27.829 --> 00:41:33.529
a full screen immersive ad, and it's a pretty
amazing ad. It's got trailers and TV spots

00:41:33.529 --> 00:41:37.859
and galleries. Not only does it have a bunch
of media you can interact with, look at the

00:41:37.859 --> 00:41:42.529
bottom there. The bottom has the ability for
you to tap directly into fandango to purchase

00:41:42.529 --> 00:41:45.569
movie tickets.
But do you know what the kicker is of what

00:41:45.569 --> 00:41:52.220
you are seeing? It's not a Google ad. You
are seeing an immersive ad format delivered

00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:59.210
by a great advertising company called MediaLabs.
But because the advertiser -- excuse me the,

00:41:59.210 --> 00:42:04.050
ISB, the developer used DoubleClick to serve
the ads, DoubleClick is open to have any ads

00:42:04.050 --> 00:42:09.490
show up. And that's what it means to be open.
That we serve the most relevant ad to the

00:42:09.490 --> 00:42:16.789
user, sometimes from Google, sometimes not,
but you the developer and the publisher have

00:42:16.789 --> 00:42:22.859
the choice.
If would you like to learn more about our

00:42:22.859 --> 00:42:30.819
advertising solutions, we encourage you to

00:42:30.819 --> 00:42:37.421

Apps, to everybody at the conference, all

00:42:37.421 --> 00:42:44.140
5,000 of you.
And we're going to sweeten the deal a little

00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.470
bit.
If you go sign up, we will give you $100 free

00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:51.990
advertising credit to start learning the system
and advertise your apps in the Android Marketplace.

00:42:51.990 --> 00:42:56.160
So, please, go try that out.
[ Applause ]

00:42:56.160 --> 00:43:03.460
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: One of the most powerful ways
to demonstrate what I talked about at the

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:09.390
beginning, that innovation comes from all
levels of the stack, is to highlight one of

00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:14.420
my favorite devices.
This is the device by HTC.

00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.340
It's the EVO device.
Now, there are several things I love about

00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.910
this device.
One thing I love about the device is, its

00:43:20.910 --> 00:43:26.599
absolutely gorgeous 4.3-inch screen.
I also love how fast it is.

00:43:26.599 --> 00:43:29.890
I love the great work HTC has done to add
value.

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:32.119
I love the Sprint network.
It's a 4G network.

00:43:32.119 --> 00:43:36.349
You know what a 4G network can do?
It can give you a peak of 10 megabits per

00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:38.809
second.
Imagine what you can watch on this device

00:43:38.809 --> 00:43:44.099
at 10 megabits per second.
I love the fact that this device has a great

00:43:44.099 --> 00:43:47.299
little stand.
You can set it on the desk, or if you're on

00:43:47.299 --> 00:43:51.180
an airplane, just set it right there and watch
your content.

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.809
It's got a great battery.
It's got HDMI output.

00:43:53.809 --> 00:44:00.700
It's got a camera that's 8 megapixels and
that will do 720p HD video recording.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:07.260
And you know what I love most about this device?
Is that in partnership with Sprint and HTC,

00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:12.459
Google is going to make this device available
to every one of you today.

00:44:12.459 --> 00:44:33.210
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Now, for those of you who

00:44:33.210 --> 00:44:36.260
are watching on YouTube, I'm sorry.
[ Laughter ]

00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:42.799
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Remember to register next
year, quickly.

00:44:42.799 --> 00:44:45.770
I think you're going to love that device.
We ask you to do two things.

00:44:45.770 --> 00:44:50.589
Number one, don't run out right now.
After the keynotes are over, we're going to

00:44:50.589 --> 00:44:54.410
make it available all day until 6:00 p.m.
So you'll have plenty of time to get this

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:58.740
device and really get to see the latest in
Android innovation.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:04.349
Number two thing we're going to ask.
Thank you for supporting Android.

00:45:04.349 --> 00:45:09.289
Thank you for voting on the side of openness
and choice.

00:45:09.289 --> 00:45:18.440
[ Cheers and applause ]
&gt;&gt;Vic Gundotra: Please keep building those

00:45:18.440 --> 00:45:23.069
great apps.
Now, we're at the halfway point this morning.

00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:28.569
We're not done yet.
If you'd like to see the next step in the

00:45:28.569 --> 00:45:32.730
evolution of Android and where we're about
to go next, hang tight.
