[APPLAUSE]

00:00:03.347 --> 00:00:04.930
PATRICK MCGINNIS:
Thank you very much.

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.430
It's great to be here.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.060
I was just commenting that
I live about three blocks

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:11.122
from Google in New York.

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:13.080
And I have a friend named
Brett Perlmutter, who

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.746
is leading up all
your Cuba initiatives,

00:00:14.746 --> 00:00:16.280
so he invites me to lunch.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.580
And I must say the Mongolian
BBQ at your headquarters

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.610
in New York is pretty amazing.

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.860
So it's good to be here today.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.080
I'm here to talk about my new
book, "The 10% Entrepreneur--

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.950
How to Live Your Startup Dream
Without Quitting Your Day Job,"

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.800
or in the UK, "How to Live Your
Dream Without Quitting Your Day

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.240
Job" And the book came
out in the United States

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.060
a couple weeks ago.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.100
It came out in the UK last week.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.850
And I'm over here doing
a bunch of events,

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.080
and it's just such a pleasure
to be here with you at Google.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.490
What I'm going to talk about
today is 10% entrepreneurship.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.510
I'm going to talk about why I
believe 10% entrepreneurship is

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.430
going to be a fundamental way
that changes the way we work.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.930
Then I'm going to
talk about what it

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.454
means to be a 10% entrepreneur.

00:00:56.454 --> 00:00:57.870
And in the end,
I'm actually going

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.060
to give you some tips to
take with you and tools

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.680
to get you started
on building your 10%.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.250
And a lot of you
here in the room,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.720
given the fact you
work at Google,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.250
already understand this concept.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:09.620
This is part of
the DNA of Google.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.300
Obviously, you have
the 70/20/10 rule

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.810
that you follow that you're
always working on new projects.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.220
And what I'm trying to do
is bring that methodology

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.440
and that mindset to everybody
and also at the same time

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.920
get people, in
places like Google,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.150
to start their own companies.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.890
And so without any further ado,
you've heard my background.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.870
But what people usually
want to talk about

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.390
is the fact that I'm the
guy who invented the term,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.180
fear of missing out, or FOMO.

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:36.190
That's my claim to fame.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:37.200
I never registered it.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.900
I never made a dollar off of it.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.690
But if you really
love the term, just

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.460
think of me when you use it.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.030
So the story was, I was a
student at Harvard Business

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.670
School.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.930
This was pre-history, so
this was before Facebook.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.180
It was before people
really text messaged,

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.730
at least in the United States.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.070
And my classmates and I
had this social network

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.700
called Friendster, which if
anybody has ever remembers

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.700
those days, there was
this Friendster, which was

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.030
the first major social network.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.770
And so we would all post
stuff on Friendster on Monday

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.510
morning, and you'd
wonder what you'd

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.000
missed out on Saturday night.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.940
And we would also try to
attend every event we could.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.537
And so I noticed
this, and my friends

00:02:18.537 --> 00:02:20.870
and I started talking about
this concept we called FOMO,

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.600
or Fear Of Missing Out, and
another concept called FOBO,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.330
or Fear Of a Better Option.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.400
And if you combine the
two, you have FODA, or Fear

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.740
Of Doing Anything.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.110
And so I wrote an article
for the school newspaper

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.290
back in 2004 called
"McGinnis' Two FOs-- Social

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.430
Theory at HBS,"

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.500
And then 10 years
later, I got a call

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.300
from a reporter who was
looking up the history of FOMO

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.820
and he said, I've
traced it back to you.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.600
And lucky that
happened, because that

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.300
got me meeting with my
wonderful publisher, Penguin,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.290
and here we are today.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.430
And now, I want to give
you guys the leading edge.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.690
I'm trying to create a movement
around FOFU, or Fear Of Up.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.490
So think about it.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.020
So what is a 10% entrepreneur?

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.530
A 10% entrepreneur
is somebody who

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.330
spends 10% of their
time, money, energy,

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.180
investing, advising,
getting involved

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.774
in starting new ventures.

00:03:16.774 --> 00:03:18.190
And just from the
start, I'm going

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.560
to hit the elephant in the
room, because the question

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.330
I've gotten from everybody I've
ever talked to about this is,

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.930
I watch "Shark Tank," or
I watch "Dragon's Den,"

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.500
or my friend is a
full-time entrepreneur.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.320
And what I've heard is that
you cannot be an entrepreneur

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.830
unless you're willing to
throw everything into it,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:38.680
jump in full time, be willing
to move to the very far reaches

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.020
of Brooklyn or really
far reaches of London,

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.260
live in a cardboard box
on the side of the road,

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.620
eat out of a trash can, and
basically do this 124 hours

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.890
a day.

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:51.450
And what I stress
in the book is,

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.430
that's certainly one
approach to take.

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.900
However, just because
you're an entrepreneur

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.490
doesn't mean that
you can't find ways

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:59.270
to bring entrepreneurship
in your life

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:01.530
in different ways that might be.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.460
And we'll see today
what those ways are.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:06.290
But you can bring
entrepreneurship, customize it

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.870
to your life, and engage with
it in the way that you want

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.670
and potentially also
create pathways to, yes,

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:13.380
becoming a full-time
entrepreneur.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.330
But it's a way of looking
at entrepreneurship

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.820
in a more flexible way
that really matches

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.660
the flexibility we see in
technology in our society

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:22.610
over the last 10 years.

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.180
So Googlers here
in the room won't

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.930
have to worry about
these kinds of things,

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.600
because I know that this is
an amazing place to work.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.420
But most people really hate
what they do for a living.

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:35.500
And Thoreau, he captured
that a long time ago.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.010
But it's still
very much prevalent

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.060
today in the workplace that,
at least in the United States--

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.100
and although the United States
is a different country, I mean,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.620
we might elect Donald Trump,
for example, we are cousins.

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.690
And so these are similar trends.

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:52.770
One is the fact
that most people are

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.680
disengaged in the workplace.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.625
Another is that
traditional careers that

00:04:56.625 --> 00:04:59.590
are highly prestigious,
like law and medicine,

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.990
are now careers where people
actually basically say,

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.790
don't do what I did.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.540
And then within the millennial
ranks, which many of you

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.980
are part of the
millennial ranks,

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:10.901
there is very little expectation
of loyalty from employers.

00:05:10.901 --> 00:05:13.150
But at the same time, there
is very little expectation

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.140
to give loyalty to employers.

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:16.640
So you have this
phenomenon in which

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.992
you have a lot of movement
within the workforce, people

00:05:19.992 --> 00:05:21.700
leaving their jobs
every couple of years,

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:25.147
and it creates a
lot of instability.

00:05:25.147 --> 00:05:27.480
Meanwhile, in the rest of the
economy, the economy we're

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.170
in today right here,
entrepreneurship,

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.320
we see that there's
two major trends that

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.210
are changing the way that
people build businesses.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.770
The first is the fact that
technology has disrupted

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:40.000
how people build businesses.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.220
And as a result, the price
of building businesses

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.870
has gone way down over
the last 15 years.

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.600
And we have things like
Google to thank for it,

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.400
the storage that
you provide, all

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.280
of the back end tools for
business, all the search tools.

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.150
We have all of the
guys like the Apples

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.520
who have created tools
like the iPhone, which

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.760
is less than 10 years
old, by the way, that

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.310
allow you to capture and
basically carry your office

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:04.540
around in your pocket.

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:06.750
We have the fact that
a gigabyte of storage

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:10.930
has fallen in price from $8,000
15 years ago to basically free

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:11.850
now.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.724
And we have the
fact that you have

00:06:13.724 --> 00:06:15.140
services like Skype
that basically

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.660
make communication free.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.710
And so all of these
things make it so much

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:21.640
easier to start businesses
and to publicize them

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.590
and to get customers
and to get going.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.020
And as a result, there
has been a second sort

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.960
of secular trend,
which is the fact

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.660
that the financing of startups
has become far more democratic.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:33.680
So the cost of
starting a business

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.100
means that it's much
lower than before.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.280
And you can also raise
far less capital.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.140
And the entry point for
people to invest is far lower.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:44.230
So when I started my career
as a venture capitalist,

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.310
I vested in a company
called Mercado Libre, which

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:48.570
is the eBay of Latin America.

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:50.580
It's now a $5 billion company.

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.980
And when we did the series
A, it was a $5 million round,

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.260
and basically that went
to building the website.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.320
Today, you could do that
for less than 200 grand,

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:02.520
with 10 of your friends
putting in 10 apiece.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:05.260
And so there is a boom
in entrepreneurship,

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.350
and you all know that.

00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:08.450
At the same time,
entrepreneurship has been,

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.580
I would say, misrepresented
by the popular press

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:13.640
and by culture as a whole.

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.280
People think of
entrepreneurship as super fun

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.180
and glamorous and
sexy and romantic.

00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:22.060
And as anybody who's ever tried
to build a business knows,

00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:24.000
it's got a lot of
great things about it,

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.430
but it is not
particularly romantic.

00:07:26.430 --> 00:07:28.940
Hard work, lots
of hours, failure,

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:32.030
rejection-- that's just the
way you build a business.

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:34.550
And so I had this kind of
transformative experience

00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:36.510
where I was in
Medellin, Colombia,

00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:39.610
because I'm on the board
of a VC fund there.

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:41.600
And this young man
comes up to me.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.610
He's all charged up.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:44.730
He had just done a
hackathon, so he was probably

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.050
high on caffeine.

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.830
And he said, I have
an amazing idea.

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:50.580
I'm going to quit my job, or
I'm going to quit university.

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.860
I'm going to move to
Medellin from Bogota,

00:07:52.860 --> 00:07:55.140
and I'm going to launch this
crazy, amazing business.

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:56.982
So I said, OK, lay it on me.

00:07:56.982 --> 00:07:57.940
What do you want to do?

00:07:57.940 --> 00:08:04.150
And he said, I want to
start Tinder for dogs.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.230
And my response was sort
of like, the good thing

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.500
is actually dogs don't
need Tinder to mate.

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.500
They have natural
things happening,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:15.306
so probably not your best idea.

00:08:15.306 --> 00:08:16.430
But I talked him out of it.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:17.980
And I just thought
to myself, what's

00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:20.271
going on out there that
there's this popular perception

00:08:20.271 --> 00:08:22.190
about entrepreneurship
that makes it out

00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:26.330
to be a game and sort of fun,
when it's many, many things,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:27.530
but it's not a game.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:29.610
And so I kind of
stepped back and I

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:33.090
said, OK, traditional
careers are difficult.

00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.059
At the same time,
entrepreneurship is amazing

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:36.210
and it's a boom.

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:38.340
But a lot of people
don't realize

00:08:38.340 --> 00:08:41.530
what full-time entrepreneurship
really entails.

00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:43.799
How do we deal with
that phenomenon?

00:08:43.799 --> 00:08:46.640
And so I wanted to give people
a little reality of the fact

00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.460
that 75% of startups
don't necessarily

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.890
meet their expectations.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.170
That's at a study done by
Harvard Business School,

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:56.960
and the fact that 30% to
40% return no capital.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.370
And so failure is part of
the game, but it still sucks.

00:09:00.370 --> 00:09:04.010
And Marc Andreessen will
tell you that himself.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:06.120
And so I wanted to
tell people it's

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:10.290
OK to not be a
full-time entrepreneur.

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:11.680
In fact, there's
five reasons why

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:13.679
you may not want to be a
full-time entrepreneur,

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:14.580
at least right now.

00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:18.010
The first is lifestyle, and I've
covered that in great detail.

00:09:18.010 --> 00:09:21.380
The second is the fact that
it can ruin your finances.

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:25.510
A startup CEO in London or
New York makes about $50,000.

00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:28.740
So if you're used to living in
your cool flat in Shoreditch

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:30.290
and you launch your
startup, you may

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:33.010
have to move-- I don't know,
to Manchester or something,

00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:36.410
very far away to be able
to afford your rent.

00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:38.430
The next is your
[INAUDIBLE] status.

00:09:38.430 --> 00:09:42.510
So you go to a place like
from Goldman Sachs or Google

00:09:42.510 --> 00:09:46.530
or a prestigious law
firm or a big corporation

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:49.550
to a place where you're handing
out a business card that you

00:09:49.550 --> 00:09:53.350
got on Moo.com that's got a logo
that you bought on 99 Design,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:54.420
and I've been there.

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.080
People just look at you like,
who the heck is this person?

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.740
Especially your family--
your parents are like,

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:01.190
I just sent you to college.

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.960
And now you're making,
like, 30,000 pounds

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.285
when you could be
making 15 times that

00:10:06.285 --> 00:10:07.640
at your corporate job.

00:10:07.640 --> 00:10:08.670
So it's hard.

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:10.430
The affirmation thing is hard.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:13.140
The next is, you may not
have the right idea yet.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:15.270
And the reality
is, "Inc. Magazine"

00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:18.200
found that 71% of
successful entrepreneurs

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.520
found their idea
at a previous job.

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:23.340
And so you just may not
have found that idea yet.

00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:26.130
And finally, failure does suck.

00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:29.190
I had a person that I
knew who had come out

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:31.640
of a very good
business school, three

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.330
different failed startups.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:35.170
So he was 35 years
old, and instead

00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:37.920
of sitting on a yacht looking
out over the Mediterranean,

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:42.037
he ate breakfast across from his
mom at the table back in Ohio

00:10:42.037 --> 00:10:42.870
eating his Cheerios.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.940
And it was definitely
not what he expected.

00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:49.190
And so that takes us to the
point the point of the book,

00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.310
which is that entrepreneurship
is not necessarily

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:54.980
an all or nothing proposition.

00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.740
And in fact, engaging with
entrepreneurship on the side

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:01.980
can give you five key benefits.

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.780
And the first one,
which is clear to me,

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:06.550
is that it gives you
downside protection.

00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:08.540
So what I didn't
tell you in my bio

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.730
was that in 2008, I worked
at the private equity

00:11:10.730 --> 00:11:12.680
group of AIG.

00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:14.887
Anybody remember AIG from 2008?

00:11:14.887 --> 00:11:17.470
It was the company that, like,
we would come out of our office

00:11:17.470 --> 00:11:20.770
building and there'd be people
with little boards that said,

00:11:20.770 --> 00:11:23.330
AIG Sucks, Go to Hell,
You're the Devil.

00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.022
And that was my commute
to work every day.

00:11:26.022 --> 00:11:27.730
And I had nothing to
do with any of that.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:30.360
My division was private
equity and venture capital.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.550
We were actually building
businesses in faraway places.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:34.500
But it didn't matter.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.120
When the company went
down, we were all affected.

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.410
My stock that I owned
in the company fell 97%.

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:44.820
My stock, in terms of my
CV, fell equivalently,

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:46.460
probably 98%.

00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.280
And it was a
difficult experience.

00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.940
And that happens
over and over again.

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:51.417
Happened with VW this year.

00:11:51.417 --> 00:11:53.750
You could be working at a
great company that's a leader,

00:11:53.750 --> 00:11:56.650
and you're doing your job just
fine, but something happens.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.170
And if you don't
have a backup plan,

00:11:58.170 --> 00:12:00.430
unfortunately you are exposed.

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:01.244
Second is upside.

00:12:01.244 --> 00:12:02.660
And this is something
that I don't

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:04.646
need to explain to
all of you, but being

00:12:04.646 --> 00:12:06.020
part of something
entrepreneurial

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.440
offers you tremendous upside.

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.182
And in my own
experiences, I've been

00:12:09.182 --> 00:12:11.390
able to-- and I'll tell you
about them later-- really

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:14.289
generate meaningful upside
financially for myself.

00:12:14.289 --> 00:12:16.080
The third is that it's
fun and interesting.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:19.190
Being part of something new and
building something with people

00:12:19.190 --> 00:12:21.590
that you like just
makes life a lot better.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.657
And meet anybody who's
doing something like that,

00:12:23.657 --> 00:12:25.740
they're not going to tell
you about their day job.

00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.240
They're going to tell you about
all the great things they're

00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:29.790
doing on the side.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.249
The next one is
that you learn what

00:12:31.249 --> 00:12:33.373
it means to be an entrepreneur,
so that if you ever

00:12:33.373 --> 00:12:35.260
want to do it full time,
your eyes are open.

00:12:35.260 --> 00:12:36.634
You understand
where you're going

00:12:36.634 --> 00:12:40.180
and you've got a sense of what
it takes to be an entrepreneur.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:42.510
And finally, you
can bring everything

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:44.530
that you learned back
into your day job.

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:47.080
And I read this article
recently about the CEO

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:49.790
of AT&amp;T, the big
American company,

00:12:49.790 --> 00:12:53.260
and he's making the employees
take online courses to learn

00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:55.970
how to think like an
entrepreneur, which is,

00:12:55.970 --> 00:12:57.360
I think, actually quite good.

00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:00.270
But it's very difficult
to learn entrepreneurship

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:01.930
without actually doing it.

00:13:01.930 --> 00:13:04.992
And so you're far better
off spending your time

00:13:04.992 --> 00:13:06.450
with entrepreneurs,
seeing how they

00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.520
build their businesses
than reading about it

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:13.160
or simply doing a course online.

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:15.632
And so as I sat down
to write this book,

00:13:15.632 --> 00:13:17.340
this book comes out
of my own experience.

00:13:17.340 --> 00:13:20.760
But I didn't want it to just
be about me and my friends.

00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:22.830
And so I actually set
out on this journey

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.140
of finding people who were
doing this all over the world.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.200
I interviewed dozens of
people on four continents

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.710
and 10 countries.

00:13:30.710 --> 00:13:32.366
I have Googlers in
the book, actually.

00:13:32.366 --> 00:13:33.740
So I'll tell you
about one later.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:35.560
And then I went off
and I looked at people

00:13:35.560 --> 00:13:37.101
in all kinds of
different industries,

00:13:37.101 --> 00:13:42.460
from tech and finance and
consulting to fashion.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.690
Also, I have a car
dealer actually

00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.382
who started a brewery that's
killing it in New York City.

00:13:47.382 --> 00:13:49.340
And then I looked at
people at different stages

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.150
of life, everybody
from people who

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.310
were in college or
even pre-college

00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:55.420
through to people with
small children or people

00:13:55.420 --> 00:13:56.950
that are later in their careers.

00:13:56.950 --> 00:14:00.670
So the idea was to paint a
picture of all kinds of people

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.070
who are doing this, so
that no matter who you are,

00:14:03.070 --> 00:14:05.210
you can find somebody
who you can relate to

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:06.820
and you can say, OK, I get it.

00:14:06.820 --> 00:14:08.770
I could do this too.

00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:11.630
And then I also found some
great research, for example,

00:14:11.630 --> 00:14:14.480
a study out of the University
of Wisconsin in the States,

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:17.710
that shows that actually doing
entrepreneurship on the side

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:22.610
makes your chances of failing
33% lower than if you just

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:23.780
jump in full time.

00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:26.500
And that actually is just
basic economic theory,

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.830
because if you look
at real option theory,

00:14:28.830 --> 00:14:30.900
real option theory
says you create options

00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:33.500
and then you only actually
strike those options

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:34.860
when they're in the money.

00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.110
So as an entrepreneur, you
can create an opportunity

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.780
and then decide you may want
to go into it full time once

00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:41.820
that opportunity
is actually proven

00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.960
and your business
model is validated

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:45.870
and you can do it
in a profitable way.

00:14:45.870 --> 00:14:48.390
So it actually creates
this downside protection,

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:53.210
as it were, and sets you
up for greater success.

00:14:53.210 --> 00:14:55.780
With all the research and
everything, I then sat back

00:14:55.780 --> 00:14:57.380
and I said, what did I see here?

00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.502
And I came out with five
types of 10% entrepreneurs.

00:15:01.502 --> 00:15:03.460
And a couple of these
you will definitely know,

00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:05.300
and a few may be new to you.

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:06.822
But the first one is the angel.

00:15:06.822 --> 00:15:08.280
And the angel
investor is obviously

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:10.750
somebody who is
using their capital

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.420
to buy a share in an
entrepreneurial venture.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:16.380
And the example I'm
going to give here today

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.080
is one from the Google family.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.450
And as we learned earlier in
the pre-discussion Michelle

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:23.210
Fan, who is the YouTube
celebrity there,

00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.850
has over 6 million
subscribers on YouTube,

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.620
over a billion video views.

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:32.420
And she is a huge star in
the YouTube star universe.

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:34.750
And a friend of mine
actually started a company

00:15:34.750 --> 00:15:37.020
with her about three
years ago called Ipsy.

00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:39.350
What Ipsy does is it
sends a box every month

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:41.030
with some cosmetics.

00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:42.380
And then we use YouTube.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:44.710
We have a whole roster
of YouTube celebrities

00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:47.770
that make videos showing
how to use the makeup

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.360
and really, we use that as a
channel to acquire customers.

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:52.440
It's an awesome business
that we could not

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.710
have done without
the YouTube family.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:57.610
So it's something I
feel very thankful for.

00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.069
And I knew Marcello, the
founder, along with Michelle,

00:16:00.069 --> 00:16:01.860
because we had actually
worked on a company

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:04.190
together in the
YouTube space using

00:16:04.190 --> 00:16:08.260
YouTube celebrities to basically
send traffic to branded videos.

00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:11.500
And this was in 2011, when
things were very early

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.270
in terms of this space.

00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:16.880
And it was my first side project
was to work on this company

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:18.930
that we created
called Real Influence.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.630
And this thing was very,
very stitched together.

00:16:21.630 --> 00:16:24.630
We had two fake employees, one
named Sam and one name Alexia

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:26.370
who had LinkedIn profiles.

00:16:26.370 --> 00:16:27.880
And we had ourselves.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.680
And actually, Alexia
actually got--

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:33.390
she would get, like, notes from
headhunters trying to poach her

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.150
away, which was amazing.

00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:39.372
But three years later-- so
I invested in this business

00:16:39.372 --> 00:16:41.830
when Marcello ended up deciding
to do this business instead

00:16:41.830 --> 00:16:42.700
of the other one.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.825
He said, why don't you
invest in this new business?

00:16:44.825 --> 00:16:46.390
And I did, pre-revenue.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.910
Today, the company's doing
over $150 million in revenue.

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.570
It raised $100 million
and as an investor,

00:16:52.570 --> 00:16:54.460
it's a huge home run for me.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:57.080
But it also taught
me a lot about how

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:58.970
YouTube works, how
the business works,

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:01.950
and also what it takes to scale
a business from zero to where

00:17:01.950 --> 00:17:04.460
it is today, which is
substantially larger.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.510
So that's the Angel.

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.790
Second is the Advisor.

00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:09.579
It's similar to the
Angel, except instead

00:17:09.579 --> 00:17:13.839
of investing money, you're
investing time, your expertise.

00:17:13.839 --> 00:17:17.300
And here, we have a story about
a company called Silvercar.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.329
And Silvercar is an app that's
reinventing the way that cars

00:17:20.329 --> 00:17:22.849
are rented currently in the US.

00:17:22.849 --> 00:17:24.780
Basically, you just get
rid of all the people.

00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.900
And it's all about
getting the cars.

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:28.329
They're all silver Audis.

00:17:28.329 --> 00:17:31.470
Raised $50 million, and
Eduardo Saverin of Facebook

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:32.540
is an investor.

00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.030
And the advisor that I
refer to in this case

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.660
is a guy named Peter Barlow, who
is a lawyer in New York City.

00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.580
And he did law for
transportation-- cars

00:17:42.580 --> 00:17:43.289
and planes.

00:17:43.289 --> 00:17:44.830
And he was sitting
on a plane one day

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:46.520
and he met this
person who was trying

00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:50.060
to start this car rental company
at airports, based in airports.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.450
And he was having a tough
time with the business model

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:54.590
and with fundraising
and with connections.

00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:57.011
And Peter said, I actually
know all about this.

00:17:57.011 --> 00:17:58.260
Why don't I sit down with you?

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:59.030
Let's get together.

00:17:59.030 --> 00:18:00.821
I will work with you
on your business plan,

00:18:00.821 --> 00:18:02.050
and I will help you out.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:03.300
So Peter became a shareholder.

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.680
He was given the
shares by the founder.

00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.880
Actually became a
co-founder at that point.

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:10.240
And the company has then
gone on to raise $50 million,

00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.670
and Peter has never left
his job at his law firm.

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:13.860
He actually really likes it.

00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:16.380
But he's built up this
very valuable stake

00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:19.460
in a company that's
doing quite well.

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.100
The next one is the Founder.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:24.480
And this is our food example,
our first food example.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.630
Luke Holden started a company
called Luke's Lobster, which

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:31.240
is a food chain in the east
coast of the US and Vegas now.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.890
Basically, he was
working in finance.

00:18:32.890 --> 00:18:35.080
He was working 60
to 80 hours a week.

00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:38.690
But he's from Maine, like I
am, and he spent his summers--

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.990
actually, he built a boat
and would fish for lobster

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:42.550
off the coast of
Maine every summer.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:43.820
And when he moved
to New York, he

00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:45.970
missed good lobster rolls,
because we didn't really

00:18:45.970 --> 00:18:46.610
have any.

00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:49.180
And so he started this
company on the side.

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:52.600
He got a partner who he found
on Craigslist, which is probably

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:54.980
the first time anything
not creepy happened

00:18:54.980 --> 00:18:56.670
on Craigslist like that.

00:18:56.670 --> 00:18:57.860
And he invested.

00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.352
He basically got $35,000
he split with his dad.

00:19:01.352 --> 00:19:02.810
And that's all he
could really-- he

00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.190
couldn't afford to quit his job,
because he was basically paying

00:19:05.190 --> 00:19:06.650
off all his credit card debt.

00:19:06.650 --> 00:19:08.110
But they started
the first store.

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:11.230
It paid back the
investment in 17 days.

00:19:11.230 --> 00:19:12.860
And then they opened
a second store.

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:15.530
And then by the end of that
year, he left his finance job,

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.280
and now he runs this
company full time.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.100
He's got 20 shops.

00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:19.940
It's a juggernaut.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.330
So he decided to eventually
transition to full time,

00:19:23.330 --> 00:19:26.330
but he did so once he knew
that the business was really

00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:27.770
performing.

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:29.710
The last two are the Aficionado.

00:19:29.710 --> 00:19:31.560
An Aficionado is somebody
who does something

00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:33.790
they're passionate
about, and they

00:19:33.790 --> 00:19:35.584
want to have the
experience of doing it

00:19:35.584 --> 00:19:37.250
at a professional
level, but they're not

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:39.370
willing to do it as a living.

00:19:39.370 --> 00:19:42.140
So for example, the
story I have here is

00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:43.620
a guy named Dan Gertsacov.

00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:48.760
And Dan was the first Google
employee in Bogota, Colombia.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.510
So he was my classmate in HBS.

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:53.840
And when I was down in
Bogota about a year ago,

00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:56.610
we had dinner at this place
called La Charcuteria, which

00:19:56.610 --> 00:19:58.840
is a restaurant that
he became an advisor

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.420
to and an investor in,
because he loved to cook.

00:20:01.420 --> 00:20:04.260
The guy-- his vacations
would be at cooking schools.

00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:06.690
But he didn't want to be a
chef, because being a chef

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.360
is probably the
hardest job out there.

00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:10.840
And also, he had a very
nice salary at Google,

00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:12.330
so he didn't want
to give that up.

00:20:12.330 --> 00:20:14.020
So instead he did
this on the side.

00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:16.770
He would basically cook--
he'd take a week off and cook

00:20:16.770 --> 00:20:19.390
every night at the restaurant
or cook on a random Saturday

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:21.770
and have that experience
of doing it professionally

00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:25.170
without having to worry about
giving up a lot of things.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:27.700
But he could do so in a way
that was also profitable.

00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:30.660
He actually sold out his
stake and made a nice return.

00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:33.140
And what's cool about Dan
is that he did something

00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.390
that he loved without having to
basically make any sacrifices.

00:20:36.390 --> 00:20:38.580
Now, the irony is
that today, Dan

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.720
is the chief digital officer
of McDonald's Latin America.

00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:49.100
So he's moved into a different
area of the dining space.

00:20:49.100 --> 00:20:52.670
And the final one is
the 110% entrepreneur.

00:20:52.670 --> 00:20:54.985
And the example here is a
guy named Diego Saez Gil,

00:20:54.985 --> 00:20:58.280
who is from Tucuman, Argentina.

00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.900
And he lives in Brooklyn
now, or lived in Brooklyn,

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.080
and started a company that
was an online travel app.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:05.670
And he sold it to
another startup

00:21:05.670 --> 00:21:08.860
and so he was kind of jumping
from one startup to another.

00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:12.150
And he had some exit,
but he wasn't retiring.

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.440
But he had another idea.

00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:16.700
And he had this idea to build
the first intelligent suitcase.

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:19.159
And he met another
entrepreneur who said,

00:21:19.159 --> 00:21:20.200
I really want to do this.

00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:22.325
And so Diego said,
listen, I'm not

00:21:22.325 --> 00:21:24.200
going to jump into
another company right now.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.700
I've still got equity and I'm
an entrepreneur right now.

00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:28.430
And I just I can't do that.

00:21:28.430 --> 00:21:31.010
But let me become an
advisor and an investor

00:21:31.010 --> 00:21:32.390
and let me start with you.

00:21:32.390 --> 00:21:34.910
And so his partner took it
on and ran it full time.

00:21:34.910 --> 00:21:36.960
Diego approached a
couple of people,

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:39.410
myself included, to become
investors and advisors.

00:21:39.410 --> 00:21:41.490
And we put this
thing on Indiegogo,

00:21:41.490 --> 00:21:44.180
which is a Kickstarter
kind of thing in the US.

00:21:44.180 --> 00:21:46.140
And it raised $2 and
1/2 million in presales

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.500
in about a month and a half.

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:49.750
And so with that
information, Diego said,

00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:51.130
maybe I'll do this full time.

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:52.060
And so he left.

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:53.670
They went to Y Combinator.

00:21:53.670 --> 00:21:56.660
And today, you can actually
find, on an exclusive basis,

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:57.960
these over at Selfridges.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.280
So I was there last night.

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:01.330
And you can check
out the Bluesmart.

00:22:01.330 --> 00:22:04.160
But it's a company that has gone
on to raise as much capital.

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:06.640
And the idea of the
110% entrepreneur

00:22:06.640 --> 00:22:10.140
is the fact that when you're an
entrepreneur, you are taking,

00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.110
still, lots of risk.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.830
You are taking a big bet in one
thing, which is your startup.

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:16.300
So why shouldn't you use all
these incredibly relevant

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:19.630
skills on a limited basis to
actually build connectivity

00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:22.220
into other people's companies
so that number one, you build

00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:22.910
upside.

00:22:22.910 --> 00:22:25.120
But also, if something
happens, you've

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.900
got other things that you
can actually consider doing.

00:22:28.900 --> 00:22:30.585
So those are the five types.

00:22:30.585 --> 00:22:32.710
I'd just like to quickly
spend a few minutes on how

00:22:32.710 --> 00:22:34.710
to become a 10% entrepreneur.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.630
And all of you have the book,
which is, thank you very much,

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:38.720
Google.

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.450
I spend a lot of
time in the book.

00:22:40.450 --> 00:22:42.000
I get really granular.

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.941
Because I was never a person who
read business books, actually.

00:22:44.941 --> 00:22:46.690
Not that there's
anything wrong with them.

00:22:46.690 --> 00:22:48.330
I just didn't really read them.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:52.355
And when I did read some,
some of them I found

00:22:52.355 --> 00:22:53.730
were a little bit
too high level.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:55.313
They didn't give you
the nitty gritty.

00:22:55.313 --> 00:22:57.380
And so when I decided
to write this one,

00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:00.720
my goal was to make this a
very user-friendly manual

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.840
that you could use
every chapter to do one

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:05.270
of the steps of building a 10%.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:07.020
And so I tried to
be really granular.

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:10.202
And I probably, to a fault,
get into the details.

00:23:10.202 --> 00:23:12.160
But the idea is that you
should have everything

00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:14.960
you need in this book to
actually get going and build

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.280
your 10%.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:19.270
And so what you need
first is a plan.

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:22.380
And that consists of figuring
out what your resources are,

00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:25.450
then having a very clear
process about deciding

00:23:25.450 --> 00:23:27.802
what you're actually
going to do for your 10%.

00:23:27.802 --> 00:23:29.260
And finally, you
need to figure out

00:23:29.260 --> 00:23:31.426
how you can leverage your
network to make everything

00:23:31.426 --> 00:23:32.780
you're doing work.

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:35.890
And so if you dig into
that, your resources

00:23:35.890 --> 00:23:39.290
are time, financial
capital or money,

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:41.180
and intellectual capital.

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:43.670
And what you need to do
with each of these steps

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:45.760
is really sit down and
look at your resources.

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:48.200
And so in terms
of time, depending

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.610
on what you want to do, you
may need very little time.

00:23:50.610 --> 00:23:52.740
If you want to be
an Angel investor,

00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:55.230
it's not a tremendously
time-intensive thing.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:58.090
A lot of people in the tech
world do it who are very busy.

00:23:58.090 --> 00:24:00.760
If you want to be a Founder,
it may be much more intensive.

00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.870
So you need to think
about how you connect

00:24:02.870 --> 00:24:05.600
your life at this stage
and where your life is

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:07.300
going with the
kinds of things you

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:09.140
might do as an entrepreneur.

00:24:09.140 --> 00:24:10.380
The second is resources.

00:24:10.380 --> 00:24:12.190
And one thing I
want to talk about

00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.860
is, I set aside
10% of my capital.

00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:18.000
And the reason I did that was
that I chose a number that felt

00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.720
substantial yet accessible.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:22.290
It sort of goes back to
the biblical or the Talmud

00:24:22.290 --> 00:24:25.570
or any religious book
talks about a tithe of 10%.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.180
So I felt if that
was good enough

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:30.420
for major works of
religious literature,

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:33.000
it probably was good
enough for my book.

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:35.800
And I also did a little
digging and found

00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:37.560
that the average Angel
investor actually

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:42.540
does invest 10% of their capital
in ventures across the board.

00:24:42.540 --> 00:24:45.110
And the third thing is
intellectual capital.

00:24:45.110 --> 00:24:48.020
And this is the one that brings
it all together with resources,

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.730
because intellectual
capital is what allows

00:24:50.730 --> 00:24:52.440
you to make smart decisions.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:55.190
So I was at a talk
this morning at Viacom,

00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.697
and we were talking about what
you could do for business.

00:24:57.697 --> 00:24:59.780
And somebody said, well,
I'd like to build an app,

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.330
but I don't know how to code.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:02.830
And so my answer
there was, then you

00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.156
shouldn't do that, because
that's really critical.

00:25:05.156 --> 00:25:06.780
That's the DNA of
what you're building.

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:08.980
Either find a partner
or find something else,

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:12.030
because you want to set
yourself up for success.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:14.370
And so you want to play
to your areas of strength.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:16.360
So I never do anything
in life sciences.

00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.850
I don't do anything in energy.

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:19.310
I don't do anything
in health care,

00:25:19.310 --> 00:25:21.550
because I just don't
understand those industries.

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:24.460
But in the industries
where I do have expertise,

00:25:24.460 --> 00:25:27.160
I engage much more
fully and find

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:28.900
other people who
can bring talents

00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:31.700
to the table alongside me.

00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:33.690
Once you've got
that figured out,

00:25:33.690 --> 00:25:35.110
then you go into your process.

00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:37.180
And this is the process
of deciding either you're

00:25:37.180 --> 00:25:38.870
going to start something
or you're going

00:25:38.870 --> 00:25:40.740
to invest or revise something.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.560
How do you decide whether
this is a project that's

00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.840
first of all, a good
project, but second of all,

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.410
does it make sense for you?

00:25:47.410 --> 00:25:49.206
And so there's three
questions I ask.

00:25:49.206 --> 00:25:50.830
The two are pretty
standard for anybody

00:25:50.830 --> 00:25:52.210
who's ever done investing.

00:25:52.210 --> 00:25:54.100
The third is a
little bit, I like

00:25:54.100 --> 00:25:57.430
to think of slightly special
sauce for the 10% entrepreneur.

00:25:57.430 --> 00:25:59.430
The first one is just,
how does this thing work?

00:25:59.430 --> 00:26:00.388
How does it make money?

00:26:00.388 --> 00:26:02.320
Why is it a good business?

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.060
Why is this industry attractive?

00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:06.880
Why do I want to be
involved in this business?

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.540
The second is, who
are these people?

00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:11.840
Are these people that
I share values with?

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.167
Are they competent?

00:26:13.167 --> 00:26:14.500
Do they know what they're doing?

00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.690
Will they bring
out the best in me?

00:26:16.690 --> 00:26:18.760
Are these people that
I want to partner with?

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.940
And the third one is, how can
I actually move the needle?

00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:24.130
How can I add value myself?

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:28.250
Because I'm not interested in
just being an entrepreneur,

00:26:28.250 --> 00:26:30.419
10% entrepreneur, just
to watch things happen.

00:26:30.419 --> 00:26:32.210
If I wanted to do that,
I could buy a stock

00:26:32.210 --> 00:26:34.550
and just watch the
ticker every day.

00:26:34.550 --> 00:26:35.540
I want to be involved.

00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.580
I want to find
clients or investors

00:26:37.580 --> 00:26:39.710
or bring strategic
insights to the table.

00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:42.020
And I know that if
I can't do that,

00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:44.260
I probably don't know
enough about the industry

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.770
or the people to actually be
able to make a difference.

00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:48.410
And therefore,
probably not a good

00:26:48.410 --> 00:26:50.830
place for me to spend my time.

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:52.690
And so once you've
done all of that,

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:54.440
the last bit is the network bit.

00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:57.680
And this is the part
where you're doing 10%,

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.070
so you can't be
everywhere at all times.

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:03.580
And one thing I learned in my
years in the Wall Street world

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.120
is that there's a lot of
reinvention that happens.

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:09.700
And what good people
do in that world is,

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.346
they figure out what they
need to know and then find

00:27:12.346 --> 00:27:14.220
the right person to give
them the information

00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:15.750
to do due diligence.

00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:18.030
And so as a 10%
entrepreneur, you're

00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:21.122
going to spend time building
a team of people around you

00:27:21.122 --> 00:27:23.580
who can help you find great
opportunities, who can help you

00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:25.870
figure out if there
are good companies who

00:27:25.870 --> 00:27:27.000
can help you add value.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.820
So you may be able to add
tremendous value to a company

00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:31.477
by saying, you know what?

00:27:31.477 --> 00:27:34.060
I know a great Android developer
who can come in and make sure

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:37.680
that the code looks good or that
you're doing things that make

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.420
sense or that are efficient.

00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:41.190
And so that is
the network piece,

00:27:41.190 --> 00:27:43.010
and that is the part
that allows you not

00:27:43.010 --> 00:27:45.830
only to leverage the
skills of others,

00:27:45.830 --> 00:27:48.560
but actually to build a
network of like-minded people

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:50.620
who are going to help
you throughout your 10%.

00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:52.120
You're going to
help them and you're

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:57.130
going to basically create this
force that all comes together

00:27:57.130 --> 00:27:58.680
to try to create businesses.

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.620
And with that, I'll leave you
with four principal thoughts.

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.780
The first is that you should
always play to your strengths.

00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.040
So really think about
what you're good at

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.384
and what you enjoy, because
what's terrible is to--

00:28:11.384 --> 00:28:13.300
and I've seen this
happen-- is to do something

00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.500
in your 10% and then realize
you actually really hate it.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:20.210
And so you want to
build a bakery business

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:22.280
and start cooking
Grandma's cookies.

00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:23.710
And then you realize
that you hate

00:28:23.710 --> 00:28:26.227
being in a kitchen all
day, or on the weekend.

00:28:26.227 --> 00:28:27.560
That's not where you want to be.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:29.300
You want to build
things that you enjoy

00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.280
and that don't feel like
work when you're doing them.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:35.260
They should be effortless
for the rest of your life.

00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:38.840
The second is put your day job
first, and act with integrity.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:42.950
And again, Google-- I'm sure
you've seen this area 120

00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:44.550
new initiative that
Google has created

00:28:44.550 --> 00:28:48.550
to actually fund the startups
of people here inside of Google.

00:28:48.550 --> 00:28:51.610
So this is a really easy
place to act with integrity.

00:28:51.610 --> 00:28:54.360
But one thing that was a rule
for me when I wrote the book

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:56.320
was to make sure that
everybody in the book

00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:57.690
put their full name.

00:28:57.690 --> 00:29:01.420
Because I didn't want to
be promoting businesses

00:29:01.420 --> 00:29:02.960
and businesspeople
that were doing

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.290
things that were unethical
or considered unethical

00:29:05.290 --> 00:29:06.216
by their employers.

00:29:06.216 --> 00:29:07.340
It just doesn't make sense.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:08.610
Life is too short.

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:12.180
You don't want to steal
paperclips from the office

00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:13.117
or anything like that.

00:29:13.117 --> 00:29:15.200
You want to do things in
a way that's transparent,

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.340
because your colleagues
and your company

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:23.050
could end up being your best
customer, your investor,

00:29:23.050 --> 00:29:25.420
your source of teammates
and things like that.

00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:30.140
And so it's important to
do things above the board.

00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.040
The third is that this
is a long term strategy.

00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.490
So I'm not a big believer in
get rich quick strategies.

00:29:35.490 --> 00:29:36.400
I just don't.

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:37.594
I tried some of those.

00:29:37.594 --> 00:29:39.010
I've read a couple
of other things

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.500
where like, here,
set up a business

00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:41.690
and you'll never
have to work again

00:29:41.690 --> 00:29:43.250
and you can live in the islands.

00:29:43.250 --> 00:29:45.960
And that's just not-- I
wouldn't be here right

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.380
now if I had figured that out.

00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.990
And so what this is about
is creating something

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:53.370
that you build over time so
that even if you retire someday

00:29:53.370 --> 00:29:55.262
and you're not working
at your day job,

00:29:55.262 --> 00:29:56.970
this goes with you
the rest of your life.

00:29:56.970 --> 00:29:58.428
And there's a guy
in the book who's

00:29:58.428 --> 00:30:02.074
done over 100 ventures who's
in his 60s, who basically never

00:30:02.074 --> 00:30:04.490
has to retire, because he's
done all these things he loves

00:30:04.490 --> 00:30:06.220
on the side.

00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:09.150
And finally, this is
all about mindset.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:12.510
So when I talk to
people about this,

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:15.870
I always hear questions
about, I'm really busy,

00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:19.991
or this isn't the right time for
me, or I'm afraid of failing.

00:30:19.991 --> 00:30:22.240
These are all things that I
felt and I went through it

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:23.700
my first couple
years doing this.

00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:26.200
So hopefully, I've
lived them all for you

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.070
and I can tell you
that it's not worth it.

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.970
The idea here is this
is so incremental

00:30:31.970 --> 00:30:34.730
that you can put the pedal
down at the speed that's

00:30:34.730 --> 00:30:36.800
appropriate to you
and then ramp it up.

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.650
And when I first started--
I'm at 21 ventures now.

00:30:39.650 --> 00:30:42.930
When I first started, the first
thing I did, I invested no cash

00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.130
and I was still totally
afraid of the whole thing.

00:30:45.130 --> 00:30:46.380
I was like, I'm going to fail.

00:30:46.380 --> 00:30:48.100
I'm going to look stupid.

00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:50.860
Then it went just fine, and
then I've done a couple more.

00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.120
Recently, I did my
first Aficionado.

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:56.090
I invested in the stage
adaptation of "The Last King

00:30:56.090 --> 00:30:58.250
of Scotland" here in London.

00:30:58.250 --> 00:31:00.880
So, tickets for
everybody in 2017.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.010
But that should really
have me frightened.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:05.115
But I did my due diligence,
and I feel confident,

00:31:05.115 --> 00:31:07.870
and I did an amount of
capital that felt right to me.

00:31:07.870 --> 00:31:09.600
And I'm having an
awesome time with it.

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.725
And maybe I'll see Keira
Knightley at the premiere.

00:31:11.725 --> 00:31:13.510
So it feels right.

00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.660
But it really is
about building up

00:31:15.660 --> 00:31:18.310
a portfolio over time
that will give you

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:19.700
all the things we talked about.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:23.510
And also you will grow in your
level of experience and comfort

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:27.240
so that you can engage in a
way that makes sense for you.

00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:29.990
And with that, here's
how you can find me.

00:31:29.990 --> 00:31:32.099
So my website's
patrickmcginnis.com.

00:31:32.099 --> 00:31:34.140
And you can get a free--
well, you have the book.

00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:35.848
But you could have
gotten a free chapter.

00:31:35.848 --> 00:31:37.710
There's actually a
quiz you can check out

00:31:37.710 --> 00:31:40.170
to see what kind of
10% entrepreneurship

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:41.486
makes sense for you.

00:31:41.486 --> 00:31:44.035
There's some more
resources and information.

00:31:44.035 --> 00:31:46.130
I'm on Twitter @pjmcginnis.

00:31:46.130 --> 00:31:47.170
I'm on Facebook.

00:31:47.170 --> 00:31:49.970
And you can also reach out
to me at my website there.

00:31:49.970 --> 00:31:52.710
I'm absolutely happy
to engage with you guys

00:31:52.710 --> 00:31:53.850
if you have questions.

00:31:53.850 --> 00:31:55.360
My real commitment
is, I actually

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.318
really believe in this.

00:31:56.318 --> 00:31:58.110
So if you have
questions and you want

00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.120
to find out whether
your thinking is in line

00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.930
or if you have a
doubt, I'm absolutely

00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:05.610
delighted to talk to you
and see if we can help.

00:32:05.610 --> 00:32:08.460
And the book is out,
so if you think of it,

00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:12.790
tell your friends
if you enjoy it

00:32:12.790 --> 00:32:14.290
that they should check it out.

00:32:14.290 --> 00:32:17.790
And with that, I think we're
going to move into a Q&amp;A.

00:32:17.790 --> 00:32:18.980
So thank you very much.

00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:23.210
[APPLAUSE]

00:32:26.895 --> 00:32:28.620
MALE SPEAKER: Thank
you very much.

00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:31.550
Right, we've got 15-20
minutes for Q&amp;A or so.

00:32:31.550 --> 00:32:32.864
Does anyone have-- yes?

00:32:32.864 --> 00:32:34.030
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:35.730
MALE SPEAKER: And if you could
repeat the question back,

00:32:35.730 --> 00:32:36.640
that would be great.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:38.670
AUDIENCE: So it
sounds like you have

00:32:38.670 --> 00:32:43.210
some experience of becoming
a 10% investor in ventures

00:32:43.210 --> 00:32:45.510
that your friends have started.

00:32:45.510 --> 00:32:49.000
But there is a clear distinction
between a kind of mentor

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.060
and an unpaid advisor and then
having an equity stake in it.

00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:56.544
So could you talk a bit
about how you broached that--

00:32:56.544 --> 00:32:58.085
PATRICK MCGINNIS:
Brilliant question.

00:32:58.085 --> 00:33:00.360
AUDIENCE: And kind of
negotiating an equity stake

00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:02.200
in a venture.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.700
PATRICK MCGINNIS:
Yes, so how do you

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:06.540
move from giving people
good advice for free

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:08.540
to actually becoming a
partner in their business

00:33:08.540 --> 00:33:11.590
and being compensated
for equity?

00:33:11.590 --> 00:33:15.060
So I had a real
challenge with that

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.940
switch when I first started
out, I think part of it

00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:20.420
was that I didn't quite
know what I could offer.

00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:23.110
And so I wasn't quite
certain why they

00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:24.460
might want to work with me.

00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:28.520
And then from that point,
even if you define your offer,

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:30.520
you may say, well,
what's appropriate here?

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.810
What is a fair amount of equity
to ask of somebody, or what's

00:33:33.810 --> 00:33:36.620
the fair vesting arrangement
and things like that.

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:39.234
I think-- and I've seen this.

00:33:39.234 --> 00:33:41.400
I was at Wharton Business
School a couple weeks ago,

00:33:41.400 --> 00:33:42.941
and all the students
were complaining

00:33:42.941 --> 00:33:45.660
that they're doing all this
stuff for free anyway now.

00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:48.210
And so for me, it
started out actually

00:33:48.210 --> 00:33:49.750
with doing things for free.

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:51.670
I gave a little bit
to get something.

00:33:51.670 --> 00:33:54.570
Because in the beginning,
you come with your hand out.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.790
Oftentimes people are not
willing to engage with you

00:33:56.790 --> 00:33:59.160
because they're sort
of turned off by it.

00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:01.670
But once you get going
and once you show people

00:34:01.670 --> 00:34:04.020
a little bit of what you
can bring to the table,

00:34:04.020 --> 00:34:05.914
oftentimes they'll
start asking you,

00:34:05.914 --> 00:34:07.080
would you want to work here?

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:09.250
And you can say, well, no, it's
not right for me right now.

00:34:09.250 --> 00:34:12.050
And so what I've tended to do
is show somebody what I can do.

00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:14.449
I'm very clear, and I'll
actually make an introduction

00:34:14.449 --> 00:34:17.790
or help them out with a problem
they're trying to solve.

00:34:17.790 --> 00:34:19.309
But then I'll say,
listen, I have

00:34:19.309 --> 00:34:20.850
a standard way I
work with companies,

00:34:20.850 --> 00:34:22.150
and this is how it works.

00:34:22.150 --> 00:34:26.290
And with the advisory work, I
think the critical thing to do

00:34:26.290 --> 00:34:28.570
is these are not
comfortable conversations.

00:34:28.570 --> 00:34:31.294
It's never fun to talk about
money with anybody or equity.

00:34:31.294 --> 00:34:32.960
But you've got to get
it out of the way,

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.670
because I've seen
examples of people

00:34:34.670 --> 00:34:37.659
who do tremendous amount of
work with nothing written down

00:34:37.659 --> 00:34:38.370
on paper.

00:34:38.370 --> 00:34:41.590
And then the company takes off
and they never, ever see it.

00:34:41.590 --> 00:34:44.179
And so sitting down and
saying, how much time

00:34:44.179 --> 00:34:47.679
am I going to spend, and then
sitting down and then figuring

00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:49.850
out at the other end,
how much equity is fair,

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:51.610
is something you should
do from the get-go

00:34:51.610 --> 00:34:53.520
once you've decided that
you do want to work together

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:55.760
and that you've shown them
a bit of what you can do.

00:34:55.760 --> 00:34:57.860
And for that, there are
pretty standard things.

00:34:57.860 --> 00:34:59.568
If you're just going
to be an advisor who

00:34:59.568 --> 00:35:02.100
is on call for an
hour or two a month,

00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:06.660
it can range, but maybe anywhere
from 25 basis points to 75

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.430
basis points,
depending on the stage

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:10.710
and depending on how
valuable your advice is

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:12.372
or how critical you
are to the story.

00:35:12.372 --> 00:35:13.830
And if you're going
to do something

00:35:13.830 --> 00:35:16.560
specific or project-based, like
I'm going to build you an app,

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.890
or I'm going to come up with
your marketing plan, what

00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:21.150
I like to do is actually
impute a value of that

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:22.530
and then try to
figure out, based

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:24.120
on the value of the
company at the time, what

00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.116
that converts into.

00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:29.950
You're welcome.

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:30.492
Anybody else?

00:35:30.492 --> 00:35:33.033
AUDIENCE: What do you find the
differences are between people

00:35:33.033 --> 00:35:34.280
in the US and the UK?

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:38.060
Because I think Americans are
a lot more entrepreneurship by

00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:39.817
[INAUDIBLE].

00:35:39.817 --> 00:35:42.150
PATRICK MCGINNIS: Well, the
UK is clearly coming around.

00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:44.760
It's amazing how much
is happening here.

00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:49.160
And one of my 10% investments is
a company based here in the UK

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.490
that is a company called
Affinity, which is big data.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:35:53.860
And the reason I
know is because I

00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:55.590
sat on the board of
their parent company.

00:35:55.590 --> 00:35:58.100
So we're doing really
cool things here.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:35:59.490
But you're right, it's new.

00:35:59.490 --> 00:36:01.610
It's behind the US.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.270
But so is New York, actually.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.110
New York vis-a-vis
Silicon Valley

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:06.830
has really come along
thanks to people

00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:08.900
like Google, who have
made an investment.

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:10.950
But we're pretty far behind.

00:36:10.950 --> 00:36:14.580
I think the difference
between the two, I would say,

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:18.230
is I'd say that the ecosystem
here is probably just

00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:20.140
three or four years behind.

00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.290
And what's going
to have to happen

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:27.100
is that people continue
to spend time building all

00:36:27.100 --> 00:36:28.570
the connectivity in the system.

00:36:28.570 --> 00:36:30.920
Because what's been so
powerful in the New York

00:36:30.920 --> 00:36:33.250
ecosystem that's really
amped everything up

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:36.170
has been A, that we've
had super-founders

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:39.124
like a Kevin Ryan, who started
DoubleClick, who then went on

00:36:39.124 --> 00:36:41.040
to create Gilt and a
bunch of other companies,

00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.040
along with other people.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.494
But he's been a
Super Angel that's

00:36:44.494 --> 00:36:45.910
created a bunch
of other companies

00:36:45.910 --> 00:36:47.621
and they're all
connected together.

00:36:47.621 --> 00:36:49.870
And second is, we've been
really good about connecting

00:36:49.870 --> 00:36:50.780
internationally.

00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:53.950
And London is, I would argue,
a more international city

00:36:53.950 --> 00:36:55.250
than New York.

00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:56.230
Don't quote me on that.

00:36:56.230 --> 00:36:58.940
But I don't have a
feel for how connected

00:36:58.940 --> 00:37:03.690
it is in terms of capital
and investment and startups.

00:37:03.690 --> 00:37:06.106
AUDIENCE: What about
idea generation

00:37:06.106 --> 00:37:06.980
specifically as well?

00:37:06.980 --> 00:37:08.640
So people want to
be an entrepreneur,

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.940
but don't know where to start.

00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:12.510
Either they've got too
many ideas or not enough.

00:37:12.510 --> 00:37:14.839
Where would you start with that?

00:37:14.839 --> 00:37:16.380
PATRICK MCGINNIS:
It really goes back

00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:19.190
to if you want to
be an entrepreneur,

00:37:19.190 --> 00:37:22.690
chances are you're going to
find your best ideas in your job

00:37:22.690 --> 00:37:23.270
already.

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:26.430
It may be that you come up
with an idea out of the blue,

00:37:26.430 --> 00:37:28.620
but I've seen so many
entrepreneurs that

00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.260
sit down at a table
with me, because I

00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:31.426
get to see a lot of pitches.

00:37:31.426 --> 00:37:33.920
And people say, I have
this really amazing idea

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.550
to invent the way we take
pictures and reinvent that,

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:37.900
and I've got this camera.

00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:40.320
And I say, well, have you
worked in the camera industry

00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:42.350
or have you worked
with photo optics?

00:37:42.350 --> 00:37:44.860
No, no, no, but I've
got this great idea.

00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:49.210
And so I think what I see the
biggest mistake, in the US

00:37:49.210 --> 00:37:51.470
anyway, and in other
places like Latin America,

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:53.060
and I've spent some
time in Morocco,

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:54.893
is that people come up
with great ideas that

00:37:54.893 --> 00:37:56.200
are not suited to their skills.

00:37:56.200 --> 00:38:00.050
And so if you want
to do something

00:38:00.050 --> 00:38:01.805
that is outside of
your area of expertise,

00:38:01.805 --> 00:38:03.930
either you're going to need
to find a great partner

00:38:03.930 --> 00:38:06.200
and then plug in, in the way
that makes sense for you,

00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.360
or you're going to
need to invest time

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.720
into learning an industry.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:12.720
Like Marcello, who's
the CEO of Ipsy,

00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:15.650
he didn't just come
out of the womb

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:17.080
knowing about online video.

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:18.862
He worked at Funny Or
Die for five years,

00:38:18.862 --> 00:38:20.070
and he learned how it worked.

00:38:20.070 --> 00:38:22.240
And he met Michelle
and all these things.

00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.350
So he spent the time building
the intellectual capital

00:38:25.350 --> 00:38:28.576
he needed to make
that business work.

00:38:28.576 --> 00:38:29.950
MALE SPEAKER: Any
more questions?

00:38:29.950 --> 00:38:31.314
Yes?

00:38:31.314 --> 00:38:32.980
AUDIENCE: How do you
ensure that there

00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:36.620
isn't a conflict of interest
between confidential

00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:39.920
information that you may have
as part of your day job, which

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:41.860
could be beneficial
to a 10% project?

00:38:44.054 --> 00:38:44.970
PATRICK MCGINNIS: Yes.

00:38:44.970 --> 00:38:47.160
How do you make sure
that information

00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.990
you're seeing in
your day job does

00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:52.340
not-- confidential information
doesn't make its way into what

00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:53.930
you're doing in your 10%.

00:38:53.930 --> 00:38:55.700
That's a critical question.

00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:59.140
And I think the best way to do
that is to be straightforward

00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.370
going into it, so that
your employer knows

00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:02.520
what you're up to.

00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:06.220
Because number one, you could
set yourself up for a lawsuit,

00:39:06.220 --> 00:39:08.190
and you don't want to
end up in a situation

00:39:08.190 --> 00:39:11.140
where you're accused of
stealing intellectual property.

00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.300
And so if you're
thinking prophylactically

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:17.200
about that in advance, you
should be in good shape.

00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:19.890
The second thing
is, you should also

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.874
understand what your agreements
are at your employer,

00:39:22.874 --> 00:39:25.040
just to make sure that you
don't trip into anything.

00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.610
Because most people, when
they work at a company,

00:39:27.610 --> 00:39:29.170
sign different
types of agreements.

00:39:29.170 --> 00:39:30.672
And depending on
your jurisdiction,

00:39:30.672 --> 00:39:32.130
they have different
types of terms.

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:33.890
And so you want to
be aware of that,

00:39:33.890 --> 00:39:35.930
because the worst
thing you'd want to do

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:37.680
is do something
where you get accused

00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:39.780
of stealing information
or doing something

00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:44.230
unethical, because
it will haunt you

00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:47.080
to the dying day of your life.

00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:48.224
And I've seen this happen.

00:39:48.224 --> 00:39:49.640
Ethics are something
that you just

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:53.260
can't play fast and loose with.

00:39:53.260 --> 00:39:56.540
AUDIENCE: What if you're not
aware of a friend's project

00:39:56.540 --> 00:40:00.196
and a college project that
you feel passionate about,

00:40:00.196 --> 00:40:02.241
but they're not really
looking for an advisor,

00:40:02.241 --> 00:40:04.683
have a founder or investor?

00:40:04.683 --> 00:40:06.932
How relevant is it to start
a conversation proactively

00:40:06.932 --> 00:40:09.242
and how would you start
that conversation with them?

00:40:09.242 --> 00:40:10.557
Like, hey, I'm willing to help.

00:40:10.557 --> 00:40:11.890
PATRICK MCGINNIS: Good question.

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:14.014
So if you have friends
or you know people

00:40:14.014 --> 00:40:15.930
who are doing something
that you think is cool

00:40:15.930 --> 00:40:18.304
and you want to get involved,
but they're not necessarily

00:40:18.304 --> 00:40:20.100
looking right now.

00:40:20.100 --> 00:40:22.850
So I've had this experience
of my own career,

00:40:22.850 --> 00:40:25.870
in my own 10%, where I
met an entrepreneur who

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:26.810
had a great idea.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:30.150
And I was definitely
ready to get involved.

00:40:30.150 --> 00:40:32.079
And yet, they
weren't at the stage.

00:40:32.079 --> 00:40:33.120
It's kind of like dating.

00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.550
If one person really likes the
other one and the other person

00:40:36.550 --> 00:40:40.570
is kind of, [GROANS] sometimes
you just never get together.

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:43.050
Sometimes you have to
do a little romance

00:40:43.050 --> 00:40:45.420
and bring the flowers
and things like that.

00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:49.680
So what I tend to do is,
I'm very helpful to people.

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:52.784
And I make it clear, listen--
I love what you're doing.

00:40:52.784 --> 00:40:53.950
I think it's really amazing.

00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:55.290
I think I could help you.

00:40:55.290 --> 00:40:56.500
Let me show you.

00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:59.490
Let me help you out, just
to show you what I can do.

00:40:59.490 --> 00:41:01.519
And if you like
it, I'd like to get

00:41:01.519 --> 00:41:02.810
involved in one way or another.

00:41:02.810 --> 00:41:05.268
And it can be at the level that
makes sense for both of us.

00:41:05.268 --> 00:41:07.360
And so let's have
that conversation.

00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.040
Let's be straightforward
about it.

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:12.470
Because you don't want to
be the unrequited love who,

00:41:12.470 --> 00:41:14.590
you're doing all
these things and then

00:41:14.590 --> 00:41:15.890
you're feeling bad about it.

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:17.990
And they may not even
realize that you're not just

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:20.730
doing it just because
you're a nice person.

00:41:20.730 --> 00:41:22.410
So that's a way
that I approach it.

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:24.690
MALE SPEAKER: Sounds
like openness and honesty

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:26.540
is quite good from the start.

00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:28.941
PATRICK MCGINNIS: Absolutely.

00:41:28.941 --> 00:41:32.270
MALE SPEAKER: We'll
take that one there.

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:38.640
AUDIENCE: There's a
fear with a 10% project

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:42.070
because it's only 10% of your
time and money and everything.

00:41:42.070 --> 00:41:44.280
So how do you make
a 10% succeed?

00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:45.816
And it's not a project.

00:41:45.816 --> 00:41:49.057
It's something that's
supposed to run longer term.

00:41:49.057 --> 00:41:51.090
PATRICK MCGINNIS: Great
question, and it's one

00:41:51.090 --> 00:41:52.860
that it's very case-dependent.

00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:56.650
Because I've seen people who've
started a 10% project and then

00:41:56.650 --> 00:41:58.360
put a lot of money
and energy into it.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.260
But it's something that is not
necessarily something they're

00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:01.960
very good at.

00:42:01.960 --> 00:42:03.410
And so it drags along.

00:42:03.410 --> 00:42:05.840
And I had a friend
who spent many tens

00:42:05.840 --> 00:42:09.530
of thousands of dollars
developing an app

00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:11.760
and then ended up, the
app didn't go anywhere.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.370
And so he basically
lost all of his money.

00:42:14.370 --> 00:42:16.130
And I've had other
friends who said, OK, I

00:42:16.130 --> 00:42:17.804
want to start a 10% project.

00:42:17.804 --> 00:42:19.220
And then they start
working on it,

00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:21.510
and it takes off beyond
their wildest expectations.

00:42:21.510 --> 00:42:23.134
And then they have
a different dilemma,

00:42:23.134 --> 00:42:24.500
which is, what should I do?

00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:27.640
Do I quit my day job,
or what do I do now?

00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:32.400
And so I think it goes
back to number one,

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.880
having a really good
understanding of what you think

00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:38.110
it's going to take and then
marshaling the resources

00:42:38.110 --> 00:42:40.850
and then making a commitment,
a time commitment.

00:42:40.850 --> 00:42:45.080
And so if your goal is
to do something that's

00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.770
very, very time
intensive, but you're

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:48.320
not willing to spend
the time on it,

00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:50.320
then you've chosen a
project that doesn't really

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.880
fit into your plan.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:54.550
And so the other thing
that I would say on

00:42:54.550 --> 00:42:57.370
that front is-- and I'm sure
you are all aware of this--

00:42:57.370 --> 00:43:00.280
is that nowadays, you
can have a startup that

00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.460
does absolutely nothing but
still looks like it's alive.

00:43:03.460 --> 00:43:06.410
You've got the web page and
you're paying the $5.95 a month

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:08.170
for Squarespace or whatever.

00:43:08.170 --> 00:43:10.750
And so companies
never die anymore.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:12.800
It's nearly impossible
to kill a company.

00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:16.500
And so it also comes
back to this concept of,

00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:19.190
as a 10% entrepreneur,
you're constantly

00:43:19.190 --> 00:43:22.380
monitoring how things are
going so that you're not just

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.876
doing it because it feels--
to look cool to your friends.

00:43:24.876 --> 00:43:27.250
I mean, I've seen people work
on entrepreneurial ventures

00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:28.990
that have no future,
but they keep

00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:30.990
it going just so they
don't have to admit defeat

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:32.392
to the people around them.

00:43:32.392 --> 00:43:34.225
And that is just not a
place you want to be.

00:43:34.225 --> 00:43:37.720
It's just a waste
of everybody's time.

00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:39.136
MALE SPEAKER: Yes?

00:43:39.136 --> 00:43:41.588
AUDIENCE: Do you have
a rule about, say, you

00:43:41.588 --> 00:43:46.890
do a 10% entrepreneur
project and it does take off.

00:43:46.890 --> 00:43:49.937
Do you have a definite
rule about at what point

00:43:49.937 --> 00:43:50.936
you jack in the day job.

00:43:50.936 --> 00:43:54.240
PATRICK MCGINNIS: Right, so
when do you jump from day job

00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:54.810
to full time?

00:43:54.810 --> 00:43:56.143
MALE SPEAKER: Or decide to quit?

00:43:56.143 --> 00:43:59.796
PATRICK MCGINNIS: Or decide
to quit-- absolutely.

00:43:59.796 --> 00:44:01.670
So I got this question
recently from a person

00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:03.782
I interviewed for
the book who didn't

00:44:03.782 --> 00:44:05.240
want to put their
name in, and so I

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.090
couldn't include this person.

00:44:07.090 --> 00:44:10.064
But they were making--
they had a good job

00:44:10.064 --> 00:44:12.230
and they were making way
more in their 10% than they

00:44:12.230 --> 00:44:13.310
were in their day job.

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:15.950
And they spent their day
running out to their car

00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:18.980
where they had a separate
laptop doing business,

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:20.050
which is mind-blowing.

00:44:20.050 --> 00:44:25.680
And so my advice was, if
you can live to a level

00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.289
that you want to live or you
can see that coming at you

00:44:28.289 --> 00:44:30.580
and you've got the financial
resources to actually make

00:44:30.580 --> 00:44:32.840
that jump, you should do that.

00:44:32.840 --> 00:44:35.190
That being said, if you're
not quite prepared but you

00:44:35.190 --> 00:44:36.720
want to continue
doing it and you're

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.761
at a point where you can't
continue at this scale

00:44:38.761 --> 00:44:40.600
and do both, you need
to look for a partner.

00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:45.350
And that's something that
can be difficult to do

00:44:45.350 --> 00:44:48.085
when you're in that-- that
calculation can be tricky.

00:44:48.085 --> 00:44:49.650
How do I find a partner?

00:44:49.650 --> 00:44:51.850
But you don't want
to end in a situation

00:44:51.850 --> 00:44:55.810
where you are so spread that
both of them are failing.

00:44:55.810 --> 00:44:57.650
Because if you do
poorly at your day job,

00:44:57.650 --> 00:45:02.035
you might not have it
anymore to fall back on.

00:45:02.035 --> 00:45:05.265
AUDIENCE: So, my question
is, what alternative

00:45:05.265 --> 00:45:07.999
do you suggest if the
company blocks you

00:45:07.999 --> 00:45:12.830
contractually or actually
blocks you from [INAUDIBLE]?

00:45:12.830 --> 00:45:13.830
PATRICK MCGINNIS: Right.

00:45:13.830 --> 00:45:16.790
So what would I recommend
for people getting blocked?

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:19.170
Their company says,
you cannot do a 10%.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:20.520
So I have seen this actually.

00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:22.830
And it's far less
common than I would

00:45:22.830 --> 00:45:25.667
have thought in terms of
general-- a lot of times what

00:45:25.667 --> 00:45:28.250
happens at small firms is people
say, oh, my boss doesn't want

00:45:28.250 --> 00:45:28.833
me doing this.

00:45:28.833 --> 00:45:30.940
But then you find out that
their boss is actually

00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:32.400
doing 15 things on the side.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.750
So it's a little bit
hypocritical, to say the least.

00:45:35.750 --> 00:45:39.680
I think if your company does
not permit you to do it,

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:41.100
then you shouldn't do it.

00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.464
That being said, you
could look for other areas

00:45:43.464 --> 00:45:44.130
where you might.

00:45:44.130 --> 00:45:46.190
So for example, if
your company says,

00:45:46.190 --> 00:45:49.280
you cannot do anything
having to do with media,

00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:52.170
then you might find a 10% in
real estate or something else.

00:45:52.170 --> 00:45:53.920
Because there are
many different ways

00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.110
to use your intellectual capital
and build intellectual capital

00:45:57.110 --> 00:46:00.290
in order to build wealth
and to diversify yourself.

00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:03.380
But again, I'm very
loath to recommend

00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:06.510
people do things that violate
the terms of their employer,

00:46:06.510 --> 00:46:10.010
because I've just seen
that end very, very badly.

00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:12.311
And it's unethical.

00:46:12.311 --> 00:46:15.980
MALE SPEAKER: Take one
more question-- yes?

00:46:15.980 --> 00:46:18.290
AUDIENCE: How do you
manage the expectation

00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:20.552
when you are doing
10% [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:20.552 --> 00:46:22.800
and then you have a
full-time co-founder who's

00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:25.970
throwing, like, 80 hours
per week and you say 10%,

00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:27.230
how do define it all?

00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:30.090
And then the risk level because
you have a full-time job,

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:33.911
you have the financial security
and they're like, [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:33.911 --> 00:46:35.486
How do you manage that?

00:46:35.486 --> 00:46:36.860
PATRICK MCGINNIS:
Great question.

00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:38.276
So the question
is, what do you do

00:46:38.276 --> 00:46:41.219
when one person is in a 10%
and one person is full time?

00:46:41.219 --> 00:46:43.010
And you have one person
who's got stability

00:46:43.010 --> 00:46:46.750
and the other person is
putting all the eggs into it.

00:46:46.750 --> 00:46:49.950
So that is a real
challenge, and one

00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:53.310
that I have seen dealt with
in a couple of different ways.

00:46:53.310 --> 00:46:56.620
So does anybody know
the company Zipcar?

00:46:56.620 --> 00:46:59.840
Zipcar-- great
business, went public

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:03.420
at a ridiculous valuation,
and there were two founders.

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:07.899
And what was so crazy is that
they shook hands the first day

00:47:07.899 --> 00:47:08.940
they founded the company.

00:47:08.940 --> 00:47:11.530
And then basically one of them
did everything, and one of them

00:47:11.530 --> 00:47:12.410
did nothing.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.670
But they had split
the equity day one,

00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:17.350
which is shameful, actually.

00:47:17.350 --> 00:47:19.660
You think about
that-- I get upset,

00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:20.910
and I'm not even involved.

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:23.820
And so and so there is
a book that I really

00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:26.240
love that I recommend, and
you can find it on my website

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:29.141
by Noam Wasserman called
"The Founder's Dilemmas."

00:47:29.141 --> 00:47:31.140
And he's a professor at
Harvard Business School,

00:47:31.140 --> 00:47:33.200
and his book is
really brilliant.

00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:35.240
And it deals with
the decisions you

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.040
make at the earliest
stage of a business--

00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:40.220
allocating equity, vesting,
all these sorts of things.

00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:42.122
And so what it comes
back to is, number one,

00:47:42.122 --> 00:47:44.580
is having the hard conversation
like we talked about before

00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.500
and being open.

00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:47.620
But more importantly--
I mean, you can be open

00:47:47.620 --> 00:47:48.830
and you can be Pollyanna.

00:47:48.830 --> 00:47:50.520
But people still
are people and they

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.300
may do lousy things to you.

00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:57.840
So you must put agreements into
place that fairly represent

00:47:57.840 --> 00:48:02.130
the risk reward that each person
is contributing to the project.

00:48:02.130 --> 00:48:05.420
So if you are basically
funding it all

00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:09.564
and your friend is working
full time and doing 10%,

00:48:09.564 --> 00:48:11.730
well, then your equities
probably shouldn't be even.

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:13.521
And if they are, then
you should find a way

00:48:13.521 --> 00:48:16.230
to share living expenses
and things like that.

00:48:16.230 --> 00:48:17.920
And so it really
goes back to being

00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:19.970
smart about that
structure early and having

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:21.350
the tough conversation.

00:48:21.350 --> 00:48:23.840
Because if you can't have
that conversation when there's

00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.520
really nothing to
fight over, think

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:26.936
what will happen
when you actually

00:48:26.936 --> 00:48:29.145
have something of value
there in between [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:29.145 --> 00:48:30.686
MALE SPEAKER: With
that, you're going

00:48:30.686 --> 00:48:32.805
to hang around for a few
minutes to sign books.

00:48:32.805 --> 00:48:34.180
If anyone has any
more questions.

00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:36.180
Otherwise, please join in
a massive round of applause

00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:36.480
thanking Patrick.

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:37.646
PATRICK MCGINNIS: Thank you.

00:48:37.646 --> 00:48:40.730
