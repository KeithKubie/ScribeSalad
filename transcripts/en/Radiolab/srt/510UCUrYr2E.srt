1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:05,490
You are listening to
radiolab radio from W.

2
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:09,840
N y. S. T. E. N. N. P. R.

3
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,790
Okay. From the top. You Ready? Yep.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,250
Hello. How are you doing?

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:20,380
We're going to start things off
today with this lady, Zelda Gamson.

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:23,800
Come to our little spot
to beautiful. Thank you.

7
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:27,910
She's 80 years old and these days
Zelda lives a quiet life by the sea on

8
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:31,600
Martha's vineyard. Did you have some
coffee? She visits with her grandkids,

9
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:32,530
does some gardening.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,820
We have a bird feeder and it
is the bird show of the world,

11
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,830
but life for though wasn't always so calm
back in the 60s when our story begins,

12
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,090
she was a very different kind of lady.
She even went by a different nickname,

13
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,590
just z.

14
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:52,350
Okay. I was a smoker 30 years.

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,560
I started when I went to college in 1954
first it was just a cigarette here or

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,110
there,

17
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:02,810
letting the bad girl out a bit and then
I got hooked really and I couldn't stop.

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:07,590
Went to graduate school, smoked,
got my dissertation, smoked,

19
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:10,950
got my degree, smoked in
somewhere in the fog. She meets.

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,360
Hi My friend Mary. Also
a smoker. Loves Smoking,

21
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,890
made me feel very elegant.
We were very good friends.

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,410
We were part in the year,

23
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,610
early sixties of the Congress
on racial equality together.

24
00:01:25,611 --> 00:01:26,870
They'd organize protests.

25
00:01:26,871 --> 00:01:29,930
We would demonstrate in the two of
them would even go under cover to fight

26
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:34,130
housing discrimination and the
backdrop to all of this social change.

27
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:39,880
Smoke. Yeah. You got it. I mean, our
houses were filled with these ashtray.

28
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,690
How much were you smoking at that
point? Probably smoked a packet of day.

29
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,430
I was aware smoker than Mary and I was
sometimes up to two packs a day. Wow.

30
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:53,020
You know, I had kids, I was pregnant,
um, while you were pregnant.

31
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:58,330
Guy Did. Wow. Yeah. I
feel so guilty about that.

32
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,280
So at a certain point, Zelda and Mary
decide they want to stop. Yeah. No.

33
00:02:03,281 --> 00:02:07,000
Mary who had never been as badly
addicted to Zelda. It wasn't easy.

34
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,150
It was agonizing, but
eventually she's able to do it.

35
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:15,180
Zelda now I thought sometimes that I
could stop and so I would over and over,

36
00:02:15,971 --> 00:02:19,960
she throw out her cigarettes.
Okay. Done. But then,

37
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,500
then I'd be around somebody
with cigarettes. Oh,

38
00:02:23,710 --> 00:02:28,450
F any reason that you'd give
yourself cancer? My kids this smell,

39
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:32,980
the fact that I could die, you'd
always lost out to the urge.

40
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,320
And I'd always start smoking again.

41
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,790
And this is how we'd go resolve failure,

42
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,250
resolve failure. Okay?

43
00:02:47,251 --> 00:02:49,950
So this is not the most
unusual situation in the world.

44
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:53,970
But the question you want to ask right
now is like, how do you get out of this?

45
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:56,440
You know, you want to do
something, they happily,

46
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,320
but then another part of you
says, no, I don't want to do that.

47
00:02:59,321 --> 00:03:00,250
So if you against

48
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,080
you, what do you do?

49
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:07,930
I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm
Robert Krulwich, Radiolab,

50
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:12,550
and today I'm the little deals that you
make when you are stuck with yourself.

51
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:15,700
Okay? So before talking with Zelda,

52
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,060
just so happened that I had
went with Adam Davidson,

53
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,220
one of the planet money guys to visit, uh,

54
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,520
this fellow Nobel prize winning
economist named Thomas Shelling me.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,860
You're the first to know who's written
a whole lot about the seemingly simple

56
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,570
idea of commitment,

57
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,710
arranging it so that you can't
compromise. I'll give you an example.

58
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,730
Here's the one from ancient Greece,
Xenophon, the Greek who, uh,

59
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,610
was being pursued by a
huge army of Persians,

60
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:48,290
had to make a stand on a hillside
and one of his generals said,

61
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,080
I don't think this is a good
location to make our stand.

62
00:03:51,081 --> 00:03:54,860
There's a cliff behind this. There's
no way we can retreat if we need to.

63
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,900
And Xenophon told his general
exactly. Welcome the cliff. In fact,

64
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:01,190
he said, here's what we're gonna do.

65
00:04:01,191 --> 00:04:04,820
We're gonna March our armies so that
their backs are directly to the cliff.

66
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,420
That way the Persians will
know that we can never retreat.

67
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:12,380
We're bound to fight to the death.
You're really binding yourself.

68
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:14,080
You're not binding the other side. Yeah.

69
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,230
It's attempting to influence somebody
else's choice by restricting your own

70
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:19,550
choice. But then we asked him,

71
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:23,120
what if your adversary isn't on
the outside like the Persians,

72
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:28,100
but rather it was you. [inaudible] how
do you do with Xenophon? Did to yourself?

73
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:32,690
Yeah. I, uh, I began smoking
when I was 17 years old. I,

74
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,670
I did quit several times,

75
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:38,510
but I always say

76
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,920
I back. Ooh.

77
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:48,030
But he did tell. He did give us
some suggestions. One in particular,

78
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,070
there was so awesome to
use your favorite words.

79
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,090
So a diabolical yeah,

80
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,140
that we just didn't think
anyone would ever do it. Oh,

81
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,040
that is until we met Zelda. Yeah.

82
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,500
Fast forward a few decades,

83
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:07,040
1984 Marion Zelda now live in
different parts of the country.

84
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,070
I happened to be going to a conference
in Vermont and Mary picked me up at the

85
00:05:12,741 --> 00:05:16,670
airport, right. And I was
smoking when she picked me up,

86
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:20,870
which was curious because
nobody smokes anymore. She said,

87
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:25,370
why Celta are you still
smoking? And Zelda said, yeah,

88
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:30,080
and don't tell me to stop.
I was very belligerent.

89
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,003
Yes.

90
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,410
So I went to the conference and smoked
and where they guilty cigarettes.

91
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,420
No, they were delicious.

92
00:05:39,050 --> 00:05:42,530
But what Mary said was starting
to worm its way into her brain.

93
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,200
Are you still smoking? Still
Smoking, still smoking.

94
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,800
And when she dropped me off at
the airport, I said, okay, Mary,

95
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:55,070
as if she had been putting pressure
on me, which she wasn't at all.

96
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:57,050
If I ever smoke again,

97
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,370
I'm going to get $5,000
to the Ku Klux Klan.

98
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:07,310
What did she say? $5,000 to
the Klu Klux Klan, correct?

99
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,473
[inaudible]

100
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,560
this was shelling suggestion can work,

101
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,420
but he didn't think
anyone would ever do it.

102
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:20,980
$5,000 to the Ku Klux Klan. It
just came out of my math. Huh?

103
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:24,860
You know how horrible they are,
right? Sure. So heinous. But

104
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:29,020
her and Mary made a deal.
A pact. If Zelda smoked,

105
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,200
she'd have to tell Mary
to send the KKK her money,

106
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:36,040
take it out of my savings or
something. And you were really serious.

107
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,570
You were going to do this. Yeah,

108
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:42,610
but I have to say after I made this
pledge to marry under my breath,

109
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:47,500
I said, but I can't be
responsible if she smokes again.

110
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:52,630
What if she smokes again?
If she smokes again?

111
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:57,520
Who's the she in that sentence? Me You.

112
00:06:58,180 --> 00:07:02,470
What does that mean? Well,
that means that a part of me,

113
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,500
the part of me that was smoking and
that might pick up smoking again was an

114
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:12,400
alien part. You're saying you are
two people at that moment? Yeah.

115
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:18,390
And she xe didn't really
want to stop smoking.

116
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,440
She, she, yeah.

117
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,320
After the pact, Zelda says that
often when she would fall asleep,

118
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,970
I would dream of myself smoking and she'd
wake up in a terrible sweat reach for

119
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,420
her cigarettes. But every time
she says this other thought,

120
00:07:32,421 --> 00:07:36,920
we just rush into her mind.
The KKK robes, burning crosses,

121
00:07:36,921 --> 00:07:41,030
lynchings, Gosh, she'd throw
the cigarettes down. I could.

122
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,610
The idea of them having her money,

123
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,670
I can't even imagine. It

124
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,530
sounds like you really backed
yourself up against the cliff.

125
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,503
I did.

126
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,490
Zelda had found a thought
that was hotter than the years

127
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:05,360
and she didn't smoke again.
Never again. Nope. That was it.

128
00:08:05,361 --> 00:08:06,200
Cold Turkey.

129
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:10,093
Mm.

130
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,053
Look at this.

131
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,880
There's a picture of me on a cruise
that bill and I took your sheet. Yes.

132
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:19,890
It's a profile picture of
me. Look at the cigarette.

133
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:24,840
I [inaudible] gorgeous there. See,
that's the best picture ever taken of me.

134
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:29,690
[inaudible]

135
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:31,940
now if we are many people on the inside,

136
00:08:32,630 --> 00:08:34,130
and we've talked about
this on the show before,

137
00:08:34,131 --> 00:08:38,040
how like our brain is literally divided
into these camps that sometimes wrestle,

138
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:39,920
right, fight. Well, the problem,

139
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,840
I think the problem is
according to Thomas shelling,

140
00:08:41,841 --> 00:08:45,500
is that these cells exist simultaneously.

141
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,990
We're never at the table together.

142
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,610
The one who's in charge
never confronts the other.

143
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:56,070
I guess that makes it hard to
compromise, although you know there

144
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,230
is another way to think about the problem.

145
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:03,260
Things that are offered right now have
so much more power than things that are

146
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:05,730
offered in the future. Oh,
this is David Eagleman.

147
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:07,470
He's a neuroscientist
and he says, you know,

148
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:11,400
really you could think about this
whole thing as a battle about time.

149
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:15,840
We'll make all sorts of very poor
economic decisions now versus leader if

150
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:19,590
something is offered right now versus
later. When you look at the neuroimaging,

151
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,590
it becomes clear that there are
different parts of the brain that are,

152
00:09:22,591 --> 00:09:25,830
that are battling this out in the
now parts are waste. Trunker yes.

153
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:29,820
Here's the key. What she's doing in the
case of the cigarettes is she's saying,

154
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,150
I know that I want to
win this longterm battle,

155
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,070
but I'm having a heck of a time doing it.

156
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:40,100
But if I can make the longterm plan tied
into a different immediate feeling of

157
00:09:40,921 --> 00:09:45,600
disgust, then all I have to do is have
the discussed battle, the the desire.

158
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:46,740
I see. So she's,

159
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:50,520
what she's done is she's turned this
battle into a present tense battle on both

160
00:09:50,521 --> 00:09:55,140
sides. I want a cigarette now
versus I hate the KKK now.

161
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,810
Precisely. It's a now versus now thing.

162
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:01,950
And I think that's the only way we ever
win these longterm battles is to give

163
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:06,720
them some sort of emotional salients
some reason why they matter to us right

164
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:10,110
now. Otherwise it'll never work. And there
are any number of ways of doing this.

165
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,200
Here is how Thomas shelling did it,

166
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:18,380
1980 gather my children together and I
said I quit and that they should never

167
00:10:21,151 --> 00:10:23,250
have respect for their father again. If I

168
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,880
returned to smoking any never. He
never did. And that was it for him.

169
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:31,520
[inaudible].

170
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,700
The thing I like about about those two
stories is that like there's the case

171
00:10:34,701 --> 00:10:37,970
where like, okay, say you've got
these sales battling in your head,

172
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:41,450
you've got the now part in the later
part and the later parts week. Yeah.

173
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:45,710
In this case, the later part found
a way to trick the now parts,

174
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:48,020
and this has a name,
this kind of approach.

175
00:10:48,021 --> 00:10:51,680
It's called the Ulysses contract in
the Elliot. Make that the out thing.

176
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,950
There's a moment where you list these in
as men have to sail past the island of

177
00:10:54,951 --> 00:10:59,780
the sirens and you list these nos. If
they hear the siren song, they're dead.

178
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:04,040
Sailors were so attracted
to these melodies that they
would steer towards them

179
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:08,570
and crash their ships into the
rocks and die. So on his way there,

180
00:11:08,571 --> 00:11:11,990
before the music started,
he came up with a plan.

181
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:16,940
He had his men lash him to the mast with
ropes so that he couldn't move and he

182
00:11:16,941 --> 00:11:21,050
had them fill their own ears
with bees wax. And he said,

183
00:11:21,051 --> 00:11:22,520
no matter what I do, no matter how,

184
00:11:22,521 --> 00:11:25,100
I'm just sticky waiting or shouting
or acting like a crazy man,

185
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:29,090
just keep rowing. Just keep going.
And so when they got to the sirens

186
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:33,380
[inaudible]

187
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,190
Ulysses,

188
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:39,190
he goes nuts and he's screaming and
yelling and telling the men go towards the

189
00:11:39,591 --> 00:11:41,300
women. We don't want to pass this up.

190
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,460
And of course the men have
bees wax in their ears.

191
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:47,390
They're not swayed by the siren song
because he had planned for this,

192
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,130
the present tense Ulysses,

193
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:54,010
by using his men and the rope had
literally bound the future to the

194
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:57,040
mast cause he knew that guy would be weak.

195
00:12:02,610 --> 00:12:02,930
[inaudible]

196
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:06,350
we can just move off the ocean for just
a moment. Gun, get out of your ocean

197
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,970
radio. What a weird medium. Anyway,

198
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,920
what is the bargain that you strike isn't
just about something, you know, very,

199
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:19,740
very small. And now
like this puff of smoke,

200
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:23,850
what if it's a deal that you have to do
that will decide what you're going to do

201
00:12:23,851 --> 00:12:27,480
for every day of the next
40 years? Yeah. What then?

202
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:34,640
Well, this brings us to a story from
our producer Pat Walters. Ready? Okay.

203
00:12:34,641 --> 00:12:39,010
Set it up. Okay. Okay. I'm in
Chinatown. About a year ago,

204
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:43,580
a corner of Hell and ah, my friend
Jenny posted something on Twitter.

205
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,110
It said, overheard.

206
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:48,680
I flipped the coin and I lost my life.

207
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:50,430
[inaudible]

208
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:54,960
I flipped a coin and lost my life.
Yes. And what's Twitter? Yeah,

209
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:57,780
I mean she, she actually heard someone
say this? Yeah. She was just like,

210
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,531
she's a reporter.

211
00:12:58,531 --> 00:13:01,530
She was just chatting with the guy and
he s and he said he said that to her.

212
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,580
I flipped the coin and I lost my
life. Wow. What was the context I,

213
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:07,740
while she was getting
a massage in Chinatown.

214
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,640
And how would that phrase come up
in the middle of a massage? I don't,

215
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:16,250
I honestly don't know. But she's a
reporter. Did she, did she ask you to say,

216
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,180
get your hands off me,
man, and tell me the story.

217
00:13:18,210 --> 00:13:22,170
I don't know exactly what went down,
but I asked her what the situation was.

218
00:13:22,171 --> 00:13:24,450
She said that she basically
didn't know anything,

219
00:13:24,451 --> 00:13:29,040
but she just heard that she heard it and
she told me that it was at this place

220
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:34,041
that was like either at one of seven
different addresses that she gave me.

221
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,670
So I just wondered around,

222
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:40,860
do you know if some place around here
called health trail a massage place has no

223
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:41,694
idea. No.

224
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:46,680
Wandered around to several different
addresses and eventually I found this tiny

225
00:13:46,681 --> 00:13:48,530
little storefront. It a little sign on

226
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:53,130
the feet kind of hidden.

227
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:58,770
Oh, you're one those [inaudible]
my son and a found the guy.

228
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,310
What that is. You said the thing,
hi. Hi. How are you? I'm okay.

229
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,840
His name is Dennis Dennis. And
you just asked him how you,

230
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,310
tell me about this coin flip. Can you
tell me, can you, so when did this happen?

231
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,230
How bout about four years ago?

232
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,760
I was 26 and my brother was uh, 21.

233
00:14:15,390 --> 00:14:19,500
Both of them had gone to college, Dennis
for photography, his brother for art,

234
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:23,640
joy. And they come out of school
with these big dreams in new places,

235
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,120
meeting New People, making
a live and making money.

236
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:29,850
But that hadn't really worked
out. Yeah, I know Jeff for me,

237
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:33,210
they're having a hard time finding jobs
and they ended up living at home with

238
00:14:33,211 --> 00:14:34,720
their dad. Yeah, with my dad.

239
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:38,250
So basically I just staying
home to picture and my brother,

240
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:40,420
he's just working at a
restaurant, low life eater.

241
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:43,650
So this is basically post-college
flail. Yeah. Like they're stuck.

242
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,620
Stuck in the middle of the road.
That's what happened to us.

243
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:50,190
And one day their dad comes up
to them and says, look guys,

244
00:14:50,191 --> 00:14:54,000
one of you guys follow
me. I need one of you.

245
00:14:54,090 --> 00:14:57,810
I don't care which one of you, but I
need one of you to take over the family.

246
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:01,540
My phone is getting all
this design I eat above you.

247
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:05,410
Come out or one of your [inaudible].
So one of them now has to carry on his,

248
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:09,050
his thing. Yeah. What is it that I
do here in this massage parlor? Yeah.

249
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:12,850
Since we're not interested. Yeah,
Nita was what really want to do it.

250
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,630
That's kind chi will Dennis's little
brother because touching people food,

251
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,400
it's some kind of disgusting. Right.

252
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,270
And there's always a hairy guy or
like some girls like busted toes.

253
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:26,290
Disgusting and annoying. Facing your
father for 24 hours. Seven days a week.

254
00:15:26,291 --> 00:15:28,660
Yeah, a little more than I
can take. Like I love my dad,

255
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,140
but he just don't want to
follow your dad's footsteps,

256
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,930
but the dad says get over it. It's about
family, keeping the business alive,

257
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:38,920
keeping the technique he has
alive in the whole channel town.

258
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,630
I don't think any massage place or any
therapy place will have my father. To me,

259
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,930
it's a special kind of thing.
Yeah, it's this like deep tissue.

260
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:50,740
Acupressure is painful type massage.
I don't know. Have Jenny told you?

261
00:15:50,741 --> 00:15:53,350
That is really painful. Anyhow,

262
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:57,400
they're sitting at home and this question
is kind of like silently hanging over

263
00:15:57,401 --> 00:16:02,350
them for days and weeks till one day
that a friend's place having some tea,

264
00:16:02,650 --> 00:16:07,000
talking about their dad and Dennis looks
up at his brother and says as make a

265
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:11,290
bet. Let's do the TV thing. The weather.

266
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,210
Let's see what the what the what
the TD say? Well, Dennis says,

267
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:17,160
when you're drinking loose
tea, the Chinese, right,

268
00:16:17,161 --> 00:16:20,760
you put the leaves right in the bottom
of your cup and you pour the water over

269
00:16:20,761 --> 00:16:24,930
them and usually the leaves float up to
the top flat on the surface of the team.

270
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:29,820
But every now and that every tank company
buys the tips is floating and the rest

271
00:16:29,821 --> 00:16:33,280
of the body is inside of water.
So like the stem sort of? Yeah.

272
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,920
And then the leaf is hanging down. Yeah.

273
00:16:35,050 --> 00:16:37,800
You mean like every so often instead of
the whole leaf being on the top of the

274
00:16:37,801 --> 00:16:42,801
water or the leafy part just falls to the
bottom and just the tip of the stem is

275
00:16:44,011 --> 00:16:45,690
touching the surface of the water.

276
00:16:45,691 --> 00:16:49,590
Almost like it's hanging down from the
surface of the water. And this is rare.

277
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:53,910
Yeah. So when you get that estimate is
good luck. It is that like a traditional,

278
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,410
fun old people that was doing it. That's
how we understand it. And we was kid.

279
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,350
So we just decide, okay,
whoever, we get that,

280
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:03,950
whoever gets the most lucky
tea leaves, we didn't.

281
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:10,300
Well, when you're out, you don't
need to. My Dad, whoever lost,

282
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:15,010
follow my father foster, they trusted
their whole future to this. Yeah.

283
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:18,040
It was like the spur of the
moment thing. Why didn't we, yeah,

284
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,830
we didn't really plan anything
from pipe people to flip a coin.

285
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:24,730
Like they can't figure out which way
should they go. So this is flip a coin.

286
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:30,250
When you pull all the hot water in,

287
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:34,870
they will like rolling out loud
like a small tomato. Is it spinning?

288
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,270
And then once it's done,

289
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:44,990
each cup has a layer of tea leaves on
the surface and Dennis notices. So whoa,

290
00:17:44,991 --> 00:17:48,640
look at it that he'd gotten one,
one piece that was like, wow.

291
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,080
As that incredible. Then you
looked over to his brother's cup.

292
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,200
Oh my God.

293
00:17:57,510 --> 00:18:01,500
Way More of these lucky leaves.
It was pretty obvious. Yeah.

294
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:04,360
He lost and it wasn't even close. No.

295
00:18:05,010 --> 00:18:09,390
Do you remember if he was like angry
or looks like he was deep in thought.

296
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,310
I don't think like, damn, this is
like as the worst thing in my life.

297
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:18,690
Uh,

298
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,690
and it basically was because now he was
bound by these tea leaves to go and work

299
00:18:24,451 --> 00:18:25,284
for his dad.

300
00:18:26,660 --> 00:18:29,180
What happened? Did you
first come here to work?

301
00:18:29,181 --> 00:18:33,290
I don't feel like touching anybody
foot, so he forced me to touch the foot.

302
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:37,100
Did he have to like grab your
hand and go? It says sit down,

303
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:40,370
take off his shoes without
washing his feet. Okay.

304
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:44,720
That's kind of discussed to myself. Is
this telling me to try to work on that?

305
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:49,610
His Dad eventually said practice on
your friends. Oh, is that Oh god, no.

306
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:53,630
They still hate me right now for giving
them all the pain. When that was gone,

307
00:18:53,631 --> 00:18:55,610
do you remember like what was going
through your head? Were you like,

308
00:18:55,611 --> 00:19:00,150
what am I doing? Like did you feel
like you're on the wrong track? Well,

309
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:04,880
um, I don't know how to
explain. Here's the funny thing.

310
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:09,800
Dennis says that there came a point
up to a month, look on my a fit.

311
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:14,510
I don't feel disgusting anymore. I'd
feel kind of like it. He likes it.

312
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,880
Yeah. I don't know why. It's
just like making me, ah,

313
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,240
it seemed nice to work on people.
Um, I don't know how to explain.

314
00:19:24,770 --> 00:19:28,700
I just stopped fall in love with
this job. Yeah. I don't know.

315
00:19:28,701 --> 00:19:32,930
How's that happen? I just, I working
here seven days a week, save,

316
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:37,640
become part of my life, wake up
in the morning, come here, work,

317
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,890
go home, sleep, come in with. So
as those become part of my five in,

318
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:44,380
when I've got a day off,
I don't know what to do,

319
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:46,220
where to call and just staying home.

320
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,480
Let me come back over here
and work as what happened.

321
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:53,090
It's just that I think
that's how foreign love is.

322
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,390
You don't know has to happen when
it's happened. It just happened.

323
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,980
It was a good loss. I was
thinking, I left this job.

324
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:11,510
So it sounds like you made this deal
with fate and he just got lucky.

325
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,030
No, no. Kai has a slightly different

326
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:19,860
on the whole thing. Well, so if he had
one, would you have had to do it? No, no,

327
00:20:19,950 --> 00:20:21,690
no, no, no.

328
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:25,020
Kai says the whole Tealeaf deal
was really just about Dennis.

329
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:28,440
I think at that point in the back
of his head, he wants to do it.

330
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:32,430
Just an excuse. I think he was just
looking for a sign. I'd have to ask him,

331
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:35,910
I guess. And when I did ask Dennis, he
didn't really agree with his brother.

332
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:39,230
Well, it's just a, how you say his own,

333
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:44,420
but he didn't entirely discrete either
because I wanted to do it just like this

334
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,010
kind of, I'm using my brother to
push me to work from right there.

335
00:20:49,030 --> 00:20:50,320
That's what, what do you mean by that?

336
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:53,620
I don't think he wanted to make his own
decision. It might be better just for,

337
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:57,850
for my dad, but I don't want to face him.
So if my brother just pushed me, okay.

338
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:00,580
I'll be facing him as that
could be what happened

339
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,593
[inaudible]

340
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,860
so we just needed a push. All right.

341
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,780
Would you be thing to do?

342
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:12,010
No. You know, when you think about it,
why is that wimpy? Well, I mean, he did.

343
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,550
He wanted to be a Missoula, you know,
and he didn't know what he wanted. Yo,

344
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:18,870
he knew and he set up his brother
to make him do it. So it's very, no,

345
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,250
if you call it wimpy and call it Wimpy,

346
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:25,990
I call it a powerfully
wimpy, muscularly wimpy.

347
00:21:25,991 --> 00:21:30,190
Meaning what? What does that mean?
Meaning that, oh, I got one for you.

348
00:21:30,191 --> 00:21:31,420
I'm going to lay this. You ready for this?

349
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,110
Maybe the new strength is
understanding your own wind penis.

350
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:36,970
What do you think about that? Ooh,

351
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:40,480
I just thought I just tied you into a
philosophical, not right there, buddy.

352
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,450
You're going to be thinking about that
one for years. I'm thinking about it.

353
00:21:43,451 --> 00:21:46,570
I'm over thinking about it
in take it in the complexity.

354
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,780
Can I speak now? Yeah. David's going
to say something. This is who we are.

355
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:56,210
I mean that's the reality on
the ground. We're just weak.

356
00:21:56,211 --> 00:21:58,220
We need help and I
actually think this gives,

357
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:02,330
this gives us a new way to think
about and understand virtue.

358
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:07,190
I think it gives us a much
richer view of human nature.

359
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:14,390
Thanks to Pat Walters, our
Chinatown correspondent,

364
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,120
Hey guys, it's David Eagleman radio lab
is funded in part by the Alfred p Sloan

365
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:33,121
Foundation,

366
00:22:33,121 --> 00:22:36,930
enhancing public understanding of science
and technology in the modern world.

367
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:37,321
Hi,

368
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:42,321
this is Yolanda Gamson calling more
information aboutSloan@wwwdotsloan.org

369
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:48,480
Radiolab is produced by w n
y c and distributed by NPR.

370
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:51,900
And this message.

371
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,090
Hey, I'm Jen [inaudible]. I'm
Robert Krulwich. This is radio lab.

372
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:03,800
And today today we are trying to figure
out how to make a deal with yourself

373
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:08,000
when most of you doesn't want to do
what the rest of you wants to do. Right?

374
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,390
And we've talked about these kinds of
deals when it comes to avoiding the

375
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:15,260
sirens, quitting smoking, figuring out
what to do with the balance of your life.

376
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:19,610
Now we're going to change things a bit.
Let's say instead of being an addict,

377
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,730
let's say you're just a writer. Yeah.

378
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:26,660
And you want to be inspired.
You want the words to come.

379
00:23:26,661 --> 00:23:29,300
And this is very typical
situation. They're not coming. No.

380
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:32,450
No words to the question is
in that kind of situation,

381
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:37,040
what kind of deals could you make
with yourself to get the words out?

382
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:41,330
This is, uh, this is fanciful.
My friend Oliver Sacks,

383
00:23:41,331 --> 00:23:44,330
the neurologist and the
writer, um, he made a deal,

384
00:23:44,331 --> 00:23:45,980
which frankly find this kind of

385
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,520
astonishing [inaudible] bargaining
with creativity. I will tell you,

386
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:54,490
although I probably shouldn't, uh,
the first book I wrote, Migraine,

387
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,400
um, was very obstructed.

388
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,900
And then by obstructed he means he
just got stuck. Yes. Day after day, he,

389
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:06,790
she tried to write something down and
it just didn't come and I was getting

390
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:09,100
desperate on the matter.

391
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:14,110
And finally on September
the first of 1968,

392
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,120
I said to myself, you have
10 days to write this book.

393
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,080
If it is not done, then
you commit suicide. Whoa.

394
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:25,710
And under the

395
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,180
imagined threat,

396
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,240
which seem to tell the me
in a way because you're,

397
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:36,780
you're what the other half of you thought
that the first half of you meant it.

398
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:40,560
Yes. Did the first half of
you mean it? I don't know.

399
00:24:43,040 --> 00:24:46,870
Right. But the result of this
was that after months of,

400
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:50,800
of stewing and not doing
anything, I started work.

401
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,670
And what started as a,

402
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:58,350
as a fearful task soon became a
joyful task with this own momentum.

403
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,590
And suddenly he had this feeling
that there was something inside him.

404
00:25:02,591 --> 00:25:07,180
Some engine inside me, a
wonderful associative engine,

405
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,670
which we've sourced together,

406
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,790
brings unexpected things into acquisition.

407
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,890
It had kicked into gear and just kind
of pulling things out of him and putting

408
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,910
them right there onto the page.

409
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:23,790
I felt the book was being
dictated to me healing. Uh, I, I,

410
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:27,880
I was passive. I was the bridge.
I was the transmitter. Um,

411
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,090
and in fact I finished
the book a day early.

412
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,820
That's a strange way to kick yourself
in the pants. I have to say, yeah,

413
00:25:36,821 --> 00:25:37,654
well I'm,

414
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:42,130
for me a deadline sometimes is
felt homeless literally as such.

415
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:46,550
This is not an easy way
to go to work every day.

416
00:25:46,551 --> 00:25:49,070
I wouldn't think
[inaudible] can make bank.

417
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:52,810
And it's like that definitely not too
often. And it will have a cost. Oliver,

418
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:56,420
of course, did that only once, but
the story he told got us thinking,

419
00:25:56,421 --> 00:25:59,810
is there a bargain that you can make
with yourself, your creative self?

420
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:03,290
It's somehow avoids this
terrible cost. Yeah.

421
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:07,840
That as long as this led me
generally in front of you late. Okay.

422
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,260
A woman who just does it differently.

423
00:26:09,590 --> 00:26:14,590
I have this fascination with trying to
figure out how you can live a lifetime of

424
00:26:15,591 --> 00:26:19,940
creativity without cutting your ear
off. You know what I mean? And who is,

425
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:23,920
who is that? Oh, I'm Liz Gilbert and
well just something a little bit now.

426
00:26:24,890 --> 00:26:26,050
Which Liz Gilbert, you,

427
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:30,080
I'm the Liz Gilbert who wrote
the book called the pray love.

428
00:26:30,081 --> 00:26:33,260
I guess that's the way she described
myself cause that's how my obituary will

429
00:26:33,261 --> 00:26:34,410
read, eat, pray,

430
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:37,950
love in case you were born under her rock
or raised by wolves is one of the most

431
00:26:37,951 --> 00:26:40,470
popular books ever,
ever, ever in the world.

432
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:45,360
It became even more popular when the
book became a, and guess who played Liz?

433
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:48,750
Liz Gilbert is remarkable. Julio Roberts,

434
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:52,740
her courage and the way America's
sweetheart and the success was great,

435
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:53,311
but she says, you know,

436
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:57,240
it was also kind of frightening because
there she was back at home under the

437
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:59,490
same old blank page with a new question.

438
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,890
How will you ever outdo
what you did last time?

439
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,770
Suddenly she's back where
Oliver was obstructive.

440
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:07,830
She didn't think that that success
was going to be there the last time.

441
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:12,000
So was the last time of fluke. Do
I even have another big book in me?

442
00:27:12,001 --> 00:27:14,760
Dangerous Recipe for madness madness.

443
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:18,270
But then she thought back to a
conversation that she once had with,

444
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:20,503
nope.

445
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:25,870
Who Tom Waits. Tom Tom,

446
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:28,710
wait, that's sort of [inaudible]

447
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:30,860
where this all began was that I was,

448
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:35,780
I was a journalist for GQ and I did an
interview with him and he spoke about the

449
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:39,790
creative process I think more articulately
than anybody I have ever heard. Um,

450
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:44,860
and he was talking about how every song
has a distinctive identity that it comes

451
00:27:44,901 --> 00:27:49,670
into the world with and it needs to be
taken in different ways. And he said,

452
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:52,640
you know, there are songs that,
that you have to sneak up on,

453
00:27:52,641 --> 00:27:54,860
like you're hunting for a rare bird

454
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:01,960
and there are songs that come fully
intact, like a dream taken through a straw

455
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,823
[inaudible]

456
00:28:04,230 --> 00:28:07,770
and there are songs that you find little
bits of like pieces of gum underneath

457
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:10,530
the desk and you scrape them off and
you put them together and you make

458
00:28:10,531 --> 00:28:14,200
something out of it. And there are
songs he said that need to be bullied,

459
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:15,940
um,

460
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:19,420
where he said he's been in the studio
working on a song and the whole album is

461
00:28:19,421 --> 00:28:22,560
done and this one song won't give
itself over. And he said, you know,

462
00:28:22,930 --> 00:28:25,150
everyone's gotten used to
seeing him do things like this.

463
00:28:25,151 --> 00:28:27,760
He'll march up and down the studio
talking to the songs, saying

464
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:32,000
the rest of their families in the
car, we're not going on vacation.

465
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,810
You coming along or not,
you got 10 minutes or else
you're getting left behind,

466
00:28:35,811 --> 00:28:39,170
you know, and he's like, you gotta
shake it down. Sometimes lists as that.

467
00:28:39,171 --> 00:28:40,710
The interview was maybe the first time she

468
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,940
thought of inspiration as, as, as an it.

469
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:48,190
And I remember feeling my own center
of gravity shift and thinking, wait,

470
00:28:48,191 --> 00:28:53,140
you're allowed to talk to this thing.
That the source of her ideas was outsider.

471
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:56,170
That she could get some distance
from it, maybe negotiate with it,

472
00:28:56,171 --> 00:28:59,740
even fight with it instead of beating
yourself up all the time. Right.

473
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,720
And this story that I loved,

474
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:06,520
that he told me about where his artistic
anxiety ended and his sort of new

475
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:11,521
artistic liberation began as when he's
driving along the freeway in Los Angeles

476
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,840
and like eight lanes of traffic one day.

477
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,840
And this little fragment of a
beautiful song comes into his head

478
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:23,130
[inaudible]

479
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,320
and he has no way to record
it. He's gotten no pencil,

480
00:29:25,321 --> 00:29:27,810
he's got no tape recorder and he's
in eight lanes of stressful trap.

481
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:32,180
So come [inaudible].

482
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:36,060
And he immediately starts to feel all
the old pressure that he's felt his whole

483
00:29:36,061 --> 00:29:39,800
life of, I'm not good enough. You know,
all the artistic struggle, right? I,

484
00:29:39,801 --> 00:29:42,190
I can't do it. I'm not good
enough. I'm lose it. I, it'll haunt

485
00:29:42,190 --> 00:29:44,620
me forever. And then he
just backed off from it.

486
00:29:46,040 --> 00:29:50,540
And instead he established
that negotiating distance
between him and the melody.

487
00:29:50,541 --> 00:29:53,690
And he looked up at the
sky and he said, excuse me,

488
00:29:53,990 --> 00:29:58,990
can you not see that I'm driving if
you're serious about wanting to exist,

489
00:29:59,211 --> 00:30:00,860
I spend eight hours a day in the studio.

490
00:30:00,861 --> 00:30:03,920
You're welcome to come and visit
me while I'm sitting at the piano.

491
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:08,720
Otherwise leave me alone and
go bother Leonard Cohen. Oh,

492
00:30:08,721 --> 00:30:13,160
that's very bold. It is. I
think that's what she wants.

493
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:16,910
She wants you to push back and she
wants you to set some terms and some

494
00:30:16,911 --> 00:30:17,744
boundaries.

495
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,220
She doesn't want you to go to the
Leonard Cohen Concert two years later and

496
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:25,540
very, very kind of you to come to this.

497
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:28,031
Now,

498
00:30:28,031 --> 00:30:33,031
this idea that somehow the creative
act comes from outside you.

499
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:37,660
You get a visit from a somebody,
this isn't the new idea.

500
00:30:37,661 --> 00:30:41,020
This is a very old idea. You know
the Greeks would call it the Muse

501
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:43,220
[inaudible].

502
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,650
The Romans called it
the ingenium the genius,

503
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:50,030
which was an interesting idea because
it's not the way we use genius today.

504
00:30:50,031 --> 00:30:50,271
Right?

505
00:30:50,271 --> 00:30:53,600
Today we say that a person is a genius
and back then they would've said a person

506
00:30:53,601 --> 00:30:56,980
had one. Um, and again it's
the separation so that the,

507
00:30:57,140 --> 00:31:00,650
the creative person has this
externalized collaborator.

508
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,340
So this is a tinker belly kind
of a thing. It sprinkles you.

509
00:31:04,341 --> 00:31:08,810
It has little wings. And I
think it depends. I think
it depends on the process.

510
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:13,811
I mean it's got a lot of names
because it takes a lot of forms,

511
00:31:13,821 --> 00:31:14,640
right? And,

512
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,760
and we're talking about all this as though
these are actually kind of believe it

513
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:21,620
cause I don't think it
would work otherwise.

514
00:31:21,621 --> 00:31:26,360
But I kind of do believe that the world
is being constantly circled as though by

515
00:31:26,361 --> 00:31:31,130
Gulf stream forces ideas and creativity
that want to be made manifest and

516
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:34,700
they're looking for portals
to come through and people,
and if you don't do it,

517
00:31:34,701 --> 00:31:36,610
they'll go find someone
else, you know? And,

518
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:40,520
and so you have to convince it that
you're serious and you have to show it

519
00:31:40,521 --> 00:31:43,550
respect and you have to talk to it
and let it know that you're there.

520
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,740
Like for the last few years,

521
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:50,360
there's been a novel that has been sort
of stirring in me and I haven't had time

522
00:31:50,361 --> 00:31:52,550
to give it the attention
it wants me to give it.

523
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:56,000
But every day I talk to it and I have a
little conversation with it and I say,

524
00:31:56,001 --> 00:32:00,320
listen, I'm in April, I will be
with you. I want you to stay.

525
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:03,710
Don't let me wake up and read in the New
York Times that someone else wrote you.

526
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:08,140
Um, stay here with me. I'm
coming. This feels like this,

527
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:11,420
like a golden retriever or something.
You have to keep petting it. Actually,

528
00:32:11,421 --> 00:32:15,200
that's probably as good a metaphor for
me as any because I would relate to that

529
00:32:15,230 --> 00:32:19,850
being half golden retriever myself
and, and liking dogs. That's great.

530
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:22,370
And when you say you talk to it
and it's golden retriever reform,

531
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:25,820
that's our producer pat Walters. Like,
do you actually talk to it? Yeah,

532
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:29,600
I do. I talk.

533
00:32:29,690 --> 00:32:32,600
That's why I have to work alone in a
quiet room because I talk to it all the

534
00:32:32,601 --> 00:32:36,170
time and I ask you questions. I say,
what do you, what is it that you want me?

535
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,790
What do you want me to be doing here?

536
00:32:37,791 --> 00:32:40,940
Because you seem to be to what I'm
trying to do here. Like show me,

537
00:32:40,941 --> 00:32:44,600
give me a clue. Um, like
I, uh, the title of eat,

538
00:32:44,601 --> 00:32:46,790
Pray Love was the last thing
that came of that book.

539
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:49,220
And the book was about
to be published in it,

540
00:32:49,221 --> 00:32:53,150
had any number of ridiculous stupid
titles that I'm going to tell you cause

541
00:32:53,151 --> 00:32:55,670
they're so embarrassing and they're
so not what that book was meant to be

542
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,210
titled.

543
00:32:56,210 --> 00:33:00,200
And I ended up writing an email to all
my friends and saying the subject heading

544
00:33:00,201 --> 00:33:05,160
was title search. And I said, my book
won't tell me its name and can you,

545
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:08,190
can all of you help me? And a friend
of mine wrote back and said, um,

546
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:11,000
if you're going to talk to it like that,
it's not going to tell you anything.

547
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:16,010
Um, so I really did that night,

548
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:21,060
talked to and sweetheart, listen,
I respect you, I love you.

549
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,720
I honor you. I have defended
you these last few years.

550
00:33:24,721 --> 00:33:25,920
I want to bring you into the world,

551
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:29,970
but you have to tell me
your name and the next day,

552
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:31,943
eat, pray, love.

553
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:35,230
Oh, and you know it because it's,

554
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:39,380
I know the difference between something
I thought of and something that I was

555
00:33:39,381 --> 00:33:41,210
given. I can, I can tell the difference.

556
00:33:41,930 --> 00:33:45,740
She says sometimes it's the whole
scene. Sometimes it's just a word,

557
00:33:45,970 --> 00:33:50,180
maybe a phrase. And then you have
the job to make it into something.

558
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,770
Wait. But if I,

559
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,840
if I say to you, [inaudible]

560
00:33:58,490 --> 00:33:59,380
any yellow water,

561
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,610
so you can write that down. Two
roads diverged in the yellow one,

562
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:05,160
then you're done. Do you know
how that phone got written? No.

563
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:10,540
So he was working for, I may be
exaggerating this cause I tend to,

564
00:34:10,541 --> 00:34:13,310
but I'm going to tell it
my way. How I heard it. Uh,

565
00:34:13,660 --> 00:34:16,980
he was working for months
and months and months on,

566
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:19,720
on what was going to be the
greatest epic poem of his life.

567
00:34:19,721 --> 00:34:21,670
It was the biggest challenge
that he was taking on.

568
00:34:21,790 --> 00:34:23,290
He was going to be up
there with the masters,

569
00:34:23,291 --> 00:34:25,420
with this [inaudible] named the
prison. We talking about. Yes,

570
00:34:25,421 --> 00:34:29,980
this would be Mr. Frost. And, um,
and, and, and he worked on it for, um,

571
00:34:30,220 --> 00:34:33,370
you know, forever and ever. I mean,
perspiration, perspiration, perspiration.

572
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:37,570
Right. And it was 20, 30 pages long and
it was, I don't know what the meter was,

573
00:34:37,571 --> 00:34:39,430
whatever it was. It was the most
ambitious thing he'd ever done.

574
00:34:39,431 --> 00:34:44,380
And it was arduous and it probably had
sweat all over it. Um, put it down,

575
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:49,420
went to sleep, woke up,
sat down and wrote two,

576
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:53,770
two roads and all of a sudden in
one setting, this tiny, perfect,

577
00:34:53,771 --> 00:34:57,100
immaculate thing was created that had
nothing to do with what he had just done.

578
00:34:57,490 --> 00:34:58,330
He earned it.

579
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,300
I think the angels reward people who
are at their desk at six o'clock in the

580
00:35:01,301 --> 00:35:04,660
morning working right. And
he earned it by showing his,

581
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:07,510
his intent to be a great poet.
And they said, okay, cool.

582
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:10,030
You showed your intent, that
thing you just wrote with crap,

583
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,960
I'm going to give you this
one, here's your reward. So

584
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:19,690
except for that, it's a great story.
And I liked the idea and I feel like,

585
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:23,870
I really do feel like when they see
me working, they take pity on me. Um,

586
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:27,130
and they say, you look, you're
showing a real commitment to this.

587
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:30,400
You've been up at five o'clock every
morning for the last year working on this

588
00:35:30,401 --> 00:35:33,910
novel. I'm just going to give you
the ending, you know, um, or I'm,

589
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:37,500
I'm going to spare you from that really
bad idea. You just having, you know,

590
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,920
I always think of it as like Henry Ford's
famous line about how creativity is

591
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:44,160
99% perspiration and 1% inspiration,

592
00:35:44,161 --> 00:35:46,110
which is a very mechanical
way to divide it up.

593
00:35:46,111 --> 00:35:50,490
But it also assumes that those
two things have equal weight,

594
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:55,590
that they're the same quality.
Right. I agree with 99% perspiration,

595
00:35:55,591 --> 00:35:59,250
1% inspiration, but
it's 99% oyster 1% Pearl

596
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:01,800
[inaudible]

597
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:03,430
you can't even compare the,

598
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,740
the matter like it's a
bargain to get 1% inspiration.

599
00:36:08,490 --> 00:36:11,520
You know, it's, it's a miracle.

600
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,290
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

601
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:30,620
I could get with the muses
sort of. What do you mean?

602
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:36,750
Well, I think it's interesting that you
can hear at one point she says that she

603
00:36:36,751 --> 00:36:40,170
believes, I actually kind of
believe in another point she says,

604
00:36:40,290 --> 00:36:42,210
it just makes a good
story. It's a great story.

605
00:36:42,211 --> 00:36:45,480
And I like the idea so you can
hear her negotiating with the idea.

606
00:36:45,590 --> 00:36:49,100
Yeah, of course. She's a little
bit between the two thoughts,

607
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,770
which is interesting. I
mean, you know, you know,

608
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,490
a serious neuroscientists would tell you
that it's all in your unconscious and

609
00:36:56,650 --> 00:37:00,940
it's all, all you all the time. But
another way to think of it is, uh,

610
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:04,310
is to say that you got a gift and,

611
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,070
and therefore it's not all about you.

612
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,160
When it's bad and it's still
about you when it's good,

613
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:14,090
but it's not all about you. It's
just this business of all. Okay.

614
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:18,290
This is a form of well organized
and modesty. It's a nice phrase.

615
00:37:18,291 --> 00:37:21,170
I'm just going to, it's
going to go with that. Yay.

616
00:37:21,770 --> 00:37:23,810
It's time for us in our
ferries to go to break.

617
00:37:28,050 --> 00:37:30,210
This is drew Lewis from Salt Lake City.

618
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:34,410
Radiolab is supported in part by
the Alfred p Sloan Foundation,

619
00:37:34,650 --> 00:37:38,700
enhancing public understanding of science
and technology in the modern world.

620
00:37:38,910 --> 00:37:43,590
More information about
Sloan had www dot Sloan

621
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:45,383
[inaudible].

622
00:37:49,990 --> 00:37:53,410
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab.

623
00:37:53,411 --> 00:37:58,340
Today we are continuing our search
for ways to outside oneself,

624
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:02,500
solve the problems going on
inside oneself. Ooh, nicely done.

625
00:38:02,770 --> 00:38:04,660
Now thinking back to Oliver Sacks,

626
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,580
the story that we heard at
the top of the last segment,

627
00:38:06,790 --> 00:38:11,480
[inaudible] this notion that
you, one might use terror to, uh,

628
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:16,300
to broker a relationship with one's
creative self or one's perhaps addicted

629
00:38:16,301 --> 00:38:19,740
self. Let's take that idea and kick
it up a notch. All right, let's see.

630
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:23,320
Two notches. Oh, I mean for that we
go to the reporter, Gregory Warner,

631
00:38:23,321 --> 00:38:26,980
reporter with marketplace
though marketplace was nice
enough to let us borrow

632
00:38:26,981 --> 00:38:30,280
him for this story. He's
a budget [inaudible] right
now. You understand that?

633
00:38:30,281 --> 00:38:34,180
I have no idea. Gregory. None. Whatever.
What is you're about to tell me? I am.

634
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,950
I have been purposely in the dark.

635
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:39,880
Yes. Unless of course you have
already told me somewhere. No,

636
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:43,360
I'm sure you've forgotten
that. So Greg, just set it up.

637
00:38:43,361 --> 00:38:48,070
How did you find out about this? I heard
about it, um, while washing dishes.

638
00:38:48,071 --> 00:38:48,790
Actually,

639
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:52,660
my wife was telling me about a friend's
ex boyfriend who was an alcoholic

640
00:38:53,050 --> 00:38:56,920
friend's ex boyfriend. Friend's ex
boyfriend is an alcoholic in Russia. He's,

641
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,200
he's, he's Russian. And um,

642
00:38:59,350 --> 00:39:02,350
this man didn't want to drink anymore.

643
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,560
And so the treatment that he got was to
have a capsule surgically inserted under

644
00:39:08,921 --> 00:39:13,660
the skin. Some kind of chemical
compound that if he drank again,

645
00:39:13,930 --> 00:39:18,930
this capsule would explode into
his bloodstream and kill him.

646
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:24,700
What wish he was given the bomb? Yeah,
that would be triggered by his bed.

647
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,920
Behave. Exactly. And that's all
you know. That's all I knew. Well,

648
00:39:26,921 --> 00:39:30,130
but wait a second. Who would, who
would do this? Who, who did he go to?

649
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:34,570
Well that's, that's what I,
fortunately I was on my way to Russia.

650
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,380
And what was the question in your
mind was what's this real check check?

651
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:46,750
So I get to Moscow and I
hired a fixer interpreter.

652
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:50,620
Her name is [inaudible]. It's hard
to tell what street I'm on right now.

653
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:53,830
She had found this clinic
that does this treatment.

654
00:39:55,270 --> 00:40:00,190
We go in through the gate, call this area,
lungs of Moscow, the lungs of Moscow,

655
00:40:00,250 --> 00:40:05,250
because the wind is coming through this
area and we arrive at this sort of large

656
00:40:07,151 --> 00:40:10,000
house, kind of a drab exterior.

657
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:12,190
They usher us immediately
into a waiting room.

658
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:20,550
[inaudible] there's a fish tank.
It's their plants. Pretty Lush.

659
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:24,900
So it wasn't very hospitaly. No, not
very hospitaly very, very comfortable.

660
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:28,770
Guys are really lazy fish.
And then there's your question

661
00:40:30,690 --> 00:40:35,620
where summit, hi, my name is so head
doctor, his name, slow, very slow,

662
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:40,420
yet just slow Davita. He greets us. We
become into his pretty spare office.

663
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:42,630
It's been described vouchers love.

664
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:48,040
He looks actually exactly as you'd
guess a a Russian psychotherapists and

665
00:40:48,041 --> 00:40:51,180
oncologist. But look, I
have no guessing for that.

666
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:57,160
Maybe I take that back. He's got a point
t beard and he's got a bulbous head,

667
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,220
bright, bright green eyes.

668
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,150
And this man is a doctor and
this man is absolutely a doctor,

669
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,720
no of which there are degrees on the wall.

670
00:41:07,721 --> 00:41:09,930
She was a [inaudible].

671
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:14,860
Usually this capsule is inserted
into the buttocks as well.

672
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:19,330
It therapy actually is. That's
why it was cold at torpedo

673
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:25,940
because it is placed in a person's body
and kept the way a torpedo and assemble

674
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:28,960
marine is kept in your
butt or under the skin.

675
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,080
And if the person drinks,

676
00:41:32,081 --> 00:41:35,660
does it make them sick
or does it make them die?

677
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,150
[inaudible] he said, you know, it
doesn't, no [inaudible] kill you.

678
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,890
One can never exclude death,

679
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,820
but of course the doctor is
not going to kill his patient.

680
00:41:52,850 --> 00:41:57,230
Which employee but personal feel.

681
00:41:57,790 --> 00:42:00,380
It's very bad, extremely bad.

682
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:05,740
So still to know you will have
a type pains, almost unbearable.

683
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:08,830
[inaudible] accelerated
heart rate less than an hour.

684
00:42:08,890 --> 00:42:12,720
And the shortness of breath, everything.
Nausea, vomiting, throbbing headache,

685
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,160
visual disturbance,

686
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:18,510
mental confusion come pre
and circulatory collapse.

687
00:42:20,970 --> 00:42:25,650
And these medicines can remain in the
body from a short period of time, two,

688
00:42:26,010 --> 00:42:27,240
three years for instance.

689
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:33,540
But the pill is real well,

690
00:42:33,541 --> 00:42:38,541
so that's exactly what I asked them next
is the capsule in some way a placebo

691
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,350
yet it's not a placebo, placebo,

692
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:49,620
vpg and [inaudible] if he don't believe
I can give you a pill and that will be

693
00:42:49,621 --> 00:42:52,680
like coding for one day. Okay.

694
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:57,870
Wait a new freaking pair. I would, um,

695
00:42:58,290 --> 00:43:02,460
can you give me a pill that
would last um, three years

696
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:10,040
[inaudible] at least with this
[inaudible] if you agree, drag rate,

697
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:10,874
what the phrasing.

698
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:13,910
I'll tell you what I was thinking because
at this point I have it off and I had

699
00:43:13,911 --> 00:43:17,040
been talking for like two hours and
he hadn't let me out of the office.

700
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:18,930
I had asked to see the procedure room.

701
00:43:18,931 --> 00:43:23,040
I had asked to see the torpedo until I
realized the only way to actually see it

702
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:27,730
was to agree to have it done.
[inaudible] a patient. Yeah.

703
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:31,720
You were ready. Yeah. Let's
go. We leave the office,

704
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,810
we go down a hallway and up some stairs.

705
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,960
There's no lush carpet,
no fish tanks, no plants.

706
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:48,840
That someone's screaming. Yeah. Ah,

707
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:54,280
it's a psychiatric clinic. Meanwhile,
my translator is getting worried.

708
00:43:54,281 --> 00:43:57,190
She's like, you know, if
you meet a friend in Russia,

709
00:43:57,191 --> 00:43:59,940
you have to go drinking with
them. I said, I'll die. And

710
00:44:02,530 --> 00:44:04,450
so he leads me into this room.

711
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:09,190
It looks just like an exam
room in a doctor's clinic.

712
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:14,020
There's this sink in the nurse heart
defibrillator machine. You can,

713
00:44:14,021 --> 00:44:17,560
I see the, uh, and he just
immediately ignores me,

714
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:22,090
kinda picks up some instruments,
washes his hands. I see the torpedo.

715
00:44:23,590 --> 00:44:26,140
He then turns and he says,
yes, there is a cart.

716
00:44:26,141 --> 00:44:31,030
He does a stabbing motion with his
foot, his hand. This is how deep it is.

717
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,570
[inaudible] so he's going in? Yes.

718
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:39,630
Just before he's going to
actually cut open my butt.

719
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:44,100
And he does this with everybody. He
gives you a pill, which is the same drug,

720
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,810
but it only lasts for one day.
And then he tests it. He tests it.

721
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:51,130
How does that work? Can you take a
pill and he'll give you a drop of

722
00:44:52,930 --> 00:44:55,740
[inaudible] as he puts
just a drop of vodka.

723
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:00,270
Small job of on your towel drop off.
Once that drop of Baka hits my tongue,

724
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:03,780
I will feel all those
symptoms. You had sinks.

725
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:07,190
You can't pre in January a
personal pills. He's telling you

726
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:13,500
[inaudible] sometimes people are
so scared that urinate right here.

727
00:45:19,350 --> 00:45:21,360
Maybe a, uh, can I take it at home?

728
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:26,130
How much of the [inaudible]
so I, uh, actually no,

729
00:45:26,131 --> 00:45:29,810
I don't want to take care of it.
Chicken dog can't do it. I'm not,

730
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:30,900
I'm not strong enough.

731
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,620
He at that point realized he had
one w and he shows me the pillow.

732
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:39,270
This is what is inserted in
the body. Really. This is it.

733
00:45:40,350 --> 00:45:43,080
It's so little little

734
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:48,870
mm about the size of a,
uh, a tech Tech Tech Tech.

735
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:52,300
Okay. The Ticketek torpedo,
it comes right off the lips.

736
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:56,260
It turns out that inside that
little pill is a very real drug.

737
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,400
It's called [inaudible] and it was, oh,

738
00:45:58,401 --> 00:46:01,330
it was actually a substance that
was used in the rubber industry.

739
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,920
This is Eugene, Eugene Reichel.

740
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:06,040
I'm an assistant professor
at the University of Chicago.

741
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:09,010
He's writing a whole book about
these treatment programs in Russia.

742
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,580
He says this drug was discovered back
in the early 19 hundreds and they found

743
00:46:12,581 --> 00:46:17,320
that the a workers in the rubber industry
were unable to tolerate, um, alcohol.

744
00:46:17,350 --> 00:46:21,250
This is kind of folk knowledge in that
in the industry for awhile it was like,

745
00:46:21,251 --> 00:46:25,550
don't give that guy a beer. He
works in rubber. I know I'm in bay.

746
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:30,570
Basically what they sell fram does is
it creates a kind of toxic byproduct.

747
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:34,930
They still for in blocks a certain enzyme
from being absorbed and it causes all

748
00:46:34,931 --> 00:46:38,020
these very real symptoms. So you'd
get a little bit poison. Yeah.

749
00:46:38,230 --> 00:46:41,980
And is this used outside of these
Russian clinics? It is, but,

750
00:46:41,981 --> 00:46:46,660
but there is a big difference only in in
Russian clinics do they have these long

751
00:46:46,661 --> 00:46:51,220
acting capsules, long acting form
of diesel for Ram, which is not

752
00:46:51,620 --> 00:46:56,600
something that exists. The
subdermal implants basically,

753
00:46:56,680 --> 00:47:01,270
they don't actually release any
dice slow fram after, you know,

754
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:02,870
the first week or something like that.

755
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,380
So, so if I had taken
that drop of alcohol,

756
00:47:05,381 --> 00:47:07,390
then I would have felt all those symptoms,

757
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:10,120
but it doesn't last
for longer than a week.

758
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:15,180
Yeah. So effectively
that's basically a scam.

759
00:47:15,210 --> 00:47:17,070
I believe scam is the
word you're looking for.

760
00:47:19,650 --> 00:47:20,490
Mainstream is this, I mean,

761
00:47:20,491 --> 00:47:24,420
is this the equivalent of like guava
pills or whatever they are where you can

762
00:47:24,421 --> 00:47:27,690
find them in like vitamin shops,
but they're kind of fringy.

763
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,860
That's the thing is that is not

764
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:31,481
fringy at all. You know,

765
00:47:31,481 --> 00:47:36,481
over 60% of the treatment methods offered
by Russian Nikon narcolic six zero 60

766
00:47:38,780 --> 00:47:40,930
like more than half. Yes. Yes.

767
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,690
And Eugene emailed later to say
he was just being conservative.

768
00:47:43,691 --> 00:47:45,640
The real number is closer to 80%

769
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:48,360
mm. Wow. Coded,

770
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:52,860
which happened 15 years before
he died. My own translator,

771
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:56,520
honor her uncle went through this
procedure when he, when he was drunk,

772
00:47:57,450 --> 00:47:59,640
he didn't care before.

773
00:47:59,641 --> 00:48:04,641
I remember my grandmother crying all the
time because you could go fishing and

774
00:48:06,691 --> 00:48:10,770
then disappear for a night. And
this guy, textbook alcoholic,

775
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,990
everybody knew that he was drunk. He
went through this coding procedure.

776
00:48:14,991 --> 00:48:18,120
It's called coding because it wasn't
the drug form that goes in your bud.

777
00:48:18,121 --> 00:48:19,110
It was actually a a,

778
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:22,230
it's a kind of hypnotic suggestion
that goes into your brain. But,

779
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:26,610
but same general procedure
doctrine, the white go,

780
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:30,330
he was doing something
with his hands, some,

781
00:48:30,331 --> 00:48:33,150
some gestures in front
of [inaudible] face.

782
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:38,480
And then he Sergei closed his
eyes and he had a feeling that,

783
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:41,170
uh, some wicked, uh,

784
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,490
force was pulled out of his body.

785
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:49,400
Had this guy finished high school. This
guy was an aeronautical engineer. Oh.

786
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,590
My sense is that,

787
00:48:50,950 --> 00:48:55,950
that there's some people who suspend
their disbelief because at some level they

788
00:48:56,361 --> 00:48:59,150
have the motivation to do that.
But if it only lasts a week,

789
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:03,500
why wouldn't people like after two weeks
or a month or six months, just start,

790
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,630
just take it sip and realize, oh,

791
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:08,540
nothing happened and they just start
drinking again. Cause some people do.

792
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,890
Some people do. First of all,

793
00:49:09,891 --> 00:49:14,891
there are lots of people who do go to 12
step therapy and who Google could do go

794
00:49:15,651 --> 00:49:20,400
60% 60% you said that 80% no,
no, no, no. I know, I know it's,

795
00:49:20,470 --> 00:49:23,330
it is very prevalent and very
popular. So no, there's to this story.

796
00:49:23,331 --> 00:49:25,800
We thought there's something
Russian about this. Yeah,

797
00:49:25,810 --> 00:49:28,880
I know that it's got a sense
of submission and belief,

798
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:33,680
all sort of asserted by a higher authority
with no way to check or to second

799
00:49:33,681 --> 00:49:34,514
guess ev.

800
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:39,440
Even the way in which we're repression
is used instead of acceptance.

801
00:49:39,441 --> 00:49:43,130
It just feels very rushed and
wouldn't work in Manhattan,

802
00:49:43,131 --> 00:49:45,710
wouldn't work in Los Angeles,
wouldn't work in Chicago.

803
00:49:45,870 --> 00:49:48,830
But I think that here's the
distinction in North America,

804
00:49:48,890 --> 00:49:52,280
the prevailing understanding of addiction
is that it's a disease of denial.

805
00:49:52,310 --> 00:49:56,120
It's not about the substance as much as
it is about the fact that you're kind of

806
00:49:56,300 --> 00:50:00,650
out of touch with some kind of truths
about your self in your condition.

807
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:05,360
That's a radically different
understanding of what the problem is. Um,

808
00:50:05,570 --> 00:50:09,350
then the one that underlies the Saturday
interrupt as a skeptical American,

809
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:11,750
I got to say there is
something about this treatment,

810
00:50:11,751 --> 00:50:13,700
this Russian treatment
that makes sense to me.

811
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:15,890
Seems to me when you're in
the grips of an addiction,

812
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:19,250
you've already lost control of a certain
part of yourself or a part of yourself

813
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:21,260
as already in control that shouldn't be.

814
00:50:21,530 --> 00:50:25,820
And you can try and kind of love that
part and make peace with it and hug it and

815
00:50:25,821 --> 00:50:27,560
do the 12 step thing. Or you can

816
00:50:28,310 --> 00:50:29,660
destroy it, you know,

817
00:50:29,661 --> 00:50:32,390
build a wall around it so that
you don't have to deal with it.

818
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:35,660
That's what [inaudible] is so good
at imprisoning that part of you.

819
00:50:36,090 --> 00:50:37,830
[inaudible] religious [inaudible] skeptic.

820
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:41,960
Do you know what a panic
attacks of panic are?

821
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:47,570
[inaudible] struck? Struck is
fear. Fear. There is strong fear.

822
00:50:47,571 --> 00:50:51,020
Do you understand what it
is? Strong, very strong fear.

823
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:52,590
This is when [inaudible].

824
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,440
Dr. David have told me that he had
trained as a psychotherapist during the

825
00:50:57,441 --> 00:51:02,441
Soviet war in Afghanistan in the 80s he
says to me as to where we just imagine a

826
00:51:03,651 --> 00:51:06,500
situation where a soldier
sees his friend on the road.

827
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:12,170
He has mines c tied to his
body. He has no ears, no eyes.

828
00:51:12,171 --> 00:51:15,800
His legs are cut. It will be his
look normal, but he's still alive.

829
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:20,420
According to all rules, this kind of
person should be taken to the hospital,

830
00:51:21,330 --> 00:51:25,220
but after seeing this, every
soldier says to his friend,

831
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:27,470
if you find me in this kind of condition,

832
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,620
tortured by the Mujahideen Godly kill me,

833
00:51:31,700 --> 00:51:34,930
just watching go to these tortures

834
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:40,280
yesterday, we mean you can
drive a person crazy beatitudes.

835
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,430
Is that just something he
was having you imagine?

836
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:47,270
Are you saying that's something
he saw? That's something he saw.

837
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:52,010
Would he learn from the way in which
these mujahideen were fighting?

838
00:51:52,011 --> 00:51:55,070
This war is that you can,

839
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:58,520
you can kill your enemy.
That's one method of warfare.

840
00:51:58,521 --> 00:52:00,260
Or you can strike fear

841
00:52:02,150 --> 00:52:06,080
into the heart of your enemy
and kill not only that soldier,

842
00:52:06,110 --> 00:52:11,110
but terrorize his whole Putin a stolen
[inaudible] and what rules this world's

843
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:13,733
through fear.

844
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:21,780
If he could make you afraid
he could change here,

845
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:27,420
this coding, it completely
changed his life.

846
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:31,320
This is her uncle. Yeah.
He became very, uh,

847
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:36,000
I had a feeling that he sort of
discovered the life for himself.

848
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:39,900
Once again, he started gardening.

849
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,110
He started picking mushrooms.

850
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:46,350
Do you think coding worked?

851
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:51,210
I guess? Yeah. I don't know how it worked,

852
00:52:51,211 --> 00:52:56,211
but it did work for him because he
hadn't drank the rest of his life.

853
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:11,690
[inaudible]

854
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:15,740
thanks Greg. All right, thanks.
Okay, I got to see that.

855
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:20,970
That right there, that's a Ulysses
contract, except for instead of the rope,

856
00:53:21,080 --> 00:53:21,850
he got fear.

857
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:26,190
Right. As opposed to say if a
[inaudible] went through, um,

858
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:29,550
went through, you know,
counseling about the,

859
