00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.930
What do you think killed the dinosaurs?

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:02.930
A comet?

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:03.930
A volcano?

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:10.230
What about Dark matter?

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.929
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:17.640
Over 65.5 million years ago a comet slammed
into earth sending a giant death plume of

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.230
debris into the atmosphere, killing almost
all life on Earth including most of the dinosaurs.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.461
We’ve figured this one out, we’ve got
the evidence.

00:00:25.461 --> 00:00:28.230
A huge crater in the middle of Mexico’s
Yucatán Peninsula.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.789
But what sent that comet hurtling to Earth
in the first place?

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.260
Well some geophysicists like Michael Rampino,
from New York University noticed something

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.860
strange in the fossil record.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.020
They found that every 30 million years or
so, there seemed to be a mass extinction.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.350
Some of these were smaller extinctions, but
most of the big 5 mass extinctions match up

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:48.350
with this timeline.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.290
So what could be working like clockwork to
trigger a great loss of life on this planet?

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.600
Well some scientists like Rampino have an
idea.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.990
They point the finger at dark matter.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.580
Yup that strange mass of something out there
that we can’t see but only detect through

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.710
its gravitational effects on objects around
it.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.050
Some estimates say as much as 85% of all the
stuff out there in the universe, is actually

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.070
dark matter.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.370
Theoretical physicist Lisa Randall suggests
in her new book "Dark Matter and the Dinosaurs:

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:17.580
The Astounding Interconnectedness of the Universe"
that dark matter might be responsible for

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.210
sending comets to Earth.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.380
So there might be dark matter concentrating
near the center of our galaxy, the Milky Way

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.770
and forms a kind of thin cloud.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.000
Randall suggests that maybe it’s more of
a disk made up of particles 100 times larger

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.130
than a photon.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:33.230
The disk might be thin and dense.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:37.370
As our solar systems moves through the disk,
it bobs up and down, like an apple in barrel

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.370
full of water.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.570
And those bobs are pretty regular, about every
30 million years or so.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.980
Because the disk is so dense, the gravitational
tug would affect planetary bodies in our own

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:48.280
solar system.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.440
It could even knock comets loose from their
orbit in the Oort cloud, a cloud of dust and

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.300
comets, sending them towards Earth.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.820
And maybe this was the case for the rouge
body that slammed into Earth 65.5 million

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.840
years ago.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.780
But it’s not just rogue comets this dark
matter cloud could trigger.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.090
It could trigger volcanoes!

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.810
That’s what Rampino suggested in an article
published in the journal Monthly Notices of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.080
the Royal Astronomical Society.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.040
He claims that the dark matter particles gather
in clumps in the disk.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.730
And those clumps get swept up by the Earth
as it passes through the disk.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.670
These particles collect in the center of the
Earth where they reach sufficient densities

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.480
annihilate each other, producing enormous
amounts of heat.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.380
This heats up the Earth’s core by a few
hundred degrees which expands the molten lava

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.099
putting pressure on the crust until it erupts
in huge volcanic eruptions.

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:38.510
Maybe huge enough to wipe out most of life
on the planet.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.700
Though I should caution these ideas are still
speculative at this point.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.260
There’s still not a lot of evidence for
a disc of dark matter in the center of our

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:46.260
galaxy.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.840
There’s some evidence that our nearest neighboring
galaxy Andromeda might have one.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.970
And evidence of our own is yet to come, the
European Space Agency’s Gaia missions could

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.760
reveal more about dark matter.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.470
The mission will track the movement of hundreds
of thousands of stars throughout the Milky

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.660
Way, through which we could learn about the
distribution of dark matter.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.120
Till then, other scientists like Coryn Bailer-Jones,
an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.230
for Astronomy told Scientific American that
they remain skeptical about such a hypothesis.

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.270
Some claim that the evidence is scarce for
a clumpy dark matter disc, and others like

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.989
Bailer-Jones even question the periodic nature
of mass extinctions.

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.739
So while it’s a very cool hypothesis, I
mean who doesn’t love dark matter, dinosaurs

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.470
and volcanoes in ONE HYPOTHESIS?

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.280
I’d say more research is needed.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.100
You know what else is really cool together?

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.379
CLONING AND DINOSAURS!

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:35.550
Recently, we discovered actual fossilized
dinosaur eggs.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:44.300
Does this mean we're closer to cloning a dinosaur
and starting an awesomely terrifying theme

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.300
park?

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.660
