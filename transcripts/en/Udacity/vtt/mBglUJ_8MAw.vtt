00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.210
When we cut the pizza into fourths and

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.235
each of us got 1 piece, we saw
that we each got 1/4 of the pizza.

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:14.395
Now that the pizza is cut into 8
parts and we each get get 2 pieces,

00:00:14.395 --> 00:00:18.885
how can we represent the amount of pizza
that each person gets as a fraction?

00:00:18.885 --> 00:00:20.565
Write your answer here.

00:00:20.565 --> 00:00:24.775
