00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.350
It never fails.

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.460
You’re watching television and someone is
circling the drain, in the toilet that is

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.460
their life.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.440
The noise from the heart monitor affirms they’re
still alive, with its consistent, rhythmic

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.440
beeps.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.049
All of the sudden, alarms start going off.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.380
On the monitor- the dreaded “flat-line”.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.380
Doctors begin rushing in.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.850
One of them always seems to yell, “Hand
me the paddles; we’re losing him!”

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.200
The machine is charged, and miraculously the
heart is shocked back to life, saving the

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.200
day!

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.550
(But only after a suitably dramatic number
of zaps and someone inevitably shouting “LIVE

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.700
DAMN YOU!”)

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.219
The problem is that, in real life, you’ll
be accomplishing nothing by shocking a “flat-line”.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:46.789
Unless you like your meat well done that is.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.239
Medically, a “flat-line” is known as asystole,
meaning no (heart) contraction.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.799
It might seem common sense that if there is
no contraction you might want to contract

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:57.460
it with a shock.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.940
The truth about why this will never “restart”
the heart lies in how the heart creates its

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.589
life giving beat.

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.090
In the end, it all comes down to electrolytes.

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.759
The heart typically receives approximately
60-100 “shocks” per minute, usually from

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:17.010
specialized pacemaker cells in the right upper
portion of the heart, known as the Sinoartrial

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.790
node (SA node).

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.009
These specialized cells will naturally create
an electrical differential between the inside

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.450
of the cell and the outside.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.300
Once that differential is at just the right
amount, it will send a “shock” down, and

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.869
throughout, the heart muscle causing it to
contract.

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.359
Once this electrical signal is produced, it
will generally go completely throughout the

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:38.950
heart through the cardiac conduction system.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.979
You might be thinking right now, if the heart
creates a shock to get a contraction, why

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:46.869
won’t shocking it externally get the job
done?

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.969
Well, the devil is in the details.

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:54.909
The SA node creates an electrical differential
using electrolytes like potassium, sodium

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:55.909
and calcium.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:56.909
I won’t be going into a college level physiology
lecture, as this article would be way too

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:57.909
long and I imagine most of you aren’t interested
in reading such an essay.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:58.909
However, for the purposes of understanding
why shocking asystole doesn’t work, I will

00:01:58.909 --> 00:01:59.909
very briefly summarize what’s going on “under
the hood” here.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.909
These electrolytes all have specific electrical
charges that pass through your cell walls

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:06.960
using channels named after the electrolyte-
sodium channels, calcium channels etc.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.530
Potassium generally lies inside of your cell
before it contracts; sodium and calcium generally

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:13.450
reside outside the cell.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.080
When you have a blood pressure (if you didn’t
you would quickly be dead), sodium is naturally

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.060
forced inside your cell.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.890
This also causes potassium to be forced out
of your cell creating an electrical potential.

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.380
Once that potential gets high enough, it opens
up calcium channels which are voltage regulated.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:34.440
When the calcium channels are opened up, sodium
and calcium rush inside the cell creating

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.110
just the right amount of charge.

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.160
Once that charge is reached, the heart sends
out its shock, known as depolarization.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.620
So where does that impulse go once the SA
node creates it?

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.230
When the SA node sends out its life sustaining
impulse, it immediately shocks the atria.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.220
The pulse then gets “held up” in another
set of cells called the Atrioventricular node,

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.370
or AV node for short.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.040
This allows for the bottom part of the heart
to receive the blood from the top part.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.840
The AV node then transmits the impulse down
to the bundle of His (no, not the bundle of

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.180
hers, sorry ladies) and then to two pathways
called the right and left bundle branches.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.870
It then gets transmitted to the rest of the
Ventricles through what are called Purkinje

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:14.870
fibers.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.350
All together this “shock” causes the atria
to contract, then the ventricles.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.170
The wonder of a pulse!!

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.500
This electrical conduction is what doctors
are looking at when they are staring at the

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.640
heart monitor.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.790
Generally speaking, this impulse creates a
squeeze that actually creates your pulse.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.400
There are times however, that this isn’t
the case.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.750
A person could have a normal looking electrical
conduction on the monitor and still have no

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.750
pulse.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.990
The phenomenon is known as Pulse-less Electrical
Activity (PEA).

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.870
This is one of the reasons why doctors still
need to check pulses, and blood pressures,

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.680
even if the person is hooked up to a heart
monitor.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.230
When someone is in cardiac arrest and has
no pulse, depending on how the electrical

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.700
conduction system is working, they might need
to be shocked.

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.150
There are numerous electrical rhythms that
can present themselves in cardiac arrest.

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.530
I will touch on the most common, and why shocking
works.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.720
The most common heart rhythm just after someone
goes into cardiac arrest is known as Ventricular

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.800
fibrillation.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.350
When the SA node fails to create a beat, countless
other cells within the heart attempt to create

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:14.670
the beat instead.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.400
The result is numerous areas of the heart
that “shock” it all at the same time,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.590
from different directions.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.130
Instead of a steady contracting beat, what
you get is a heart that looks like it’s

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:25.190
having a seizure.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.120
The effect is a heart that doesn’t pump
blood through it.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.470
The only way to get all of these different
areas of the heart (foci) to work in unison

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:36.660
again is to shock it with more electricity
than the cells themselves are creating.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:40.021
When you shock these cells with this large
amount of electricity, it forces all of the

00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:42.630
electrolytes out of the cells at the same
time.

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.290
The hope, and it’s really just a hope, is
that the heart’s normal operation of electrolytes

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.040
passing across the cell membranes in an organized
fashion will take over again.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.880
Here is the devil in the shocking details.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.430
When someone is in asystole (flat-lined),
there is no electrical differential that the

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.510
monitor can pick up.

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.620
Essentially, there are no specific electrolytes
inside the cell, compared to outside the cell,

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:07.200
with different electrical potentials to create
an impulse.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.930
If you attempted to shock this, you wouldn’t
be doing anything.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:13.790
There are no electrolytes to force out of
the cells that are any different than the

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.960
ones that are already outside the cells.

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.240
All you would get is more flat-line.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.190
In fact, after every shock ever given to someone
in cardiac arrest, the rhythm created for

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.310
a few seconds is asystole, with the heart
rhythm temporarily stopped.

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.070
It takes a few seconds for the normal pathways
to get going again.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.840
If you had asystole before you shocked it,
all you would do is burn the heart with the

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.889
heat created from the shock.

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:37.570
As every steak lover knows, don’t burn the
meat!

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:42.180
Medium-well please… unless you’re in Texas,
then from my experience it’s “rare”

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:48.680
only and ordering anything different will
see the chef come out from the kitchen and

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:51.590
slap you in the face.

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:58.070
(Note: The red juice in such rare red meat
is not actually blood)

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:05.180
In the end, it’s a Hollywood myth that you
would treat asystole (flat-line) with a shock.

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.330
You must first have some sort of electrical
impulse to work with.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:09.379
Science 1, Hollywood 0.
