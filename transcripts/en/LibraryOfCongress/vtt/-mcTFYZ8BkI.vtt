&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.190
&gt;&gt; Carlos Olave: Good afternoon.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:26.410
My name is Carlos Olave.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.120
I am the head of the
Hispanic Reading Room.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.840
And I'd like to welcome you
to today's cultural program.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.870
So, [cough] excuse me.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.500
The Hispanic Division
was founded in 1939

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.400
and was the first international
reading room

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.320
in [inaudible] studies established
by the Library of Congress.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.950
In that same year the Hispanic
Reading Room was inaugurated

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.910
to service the library.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.070
Library is growing

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.670 position:56%
The Reading Room is center for the
Hispanic Studies and offers services

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.060
About 250 researchers visit the
Hispanic Reading Room each month

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.700
to research Hispanic
materials of all kinds.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.460
Although its primary emphasis
has always been the acquisition

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.240
of current materials and government
documents, the Hispanic division,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.390
has also acquired a rich
collection of rare items.

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.130
The division has been instrumental
in acquiring significant gifts,

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.990
manuscripts, music [inaudible],
posters, photographs and films.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.280
It has developed special
groups of materials

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.880
such as collecting folk music
from San Antonio, Texas,

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.030
and partnering [phonetic] the
recording of Hispanic writers,

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:40.500
through its archive of
Hispanic literature on tape

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.260
which is currently and
gradually been digitized

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.290
for wider public access.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.370
The Library of Congress houses
13.5 million items relating

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.310
to the Luso-Hispanic world.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.270
Of these 13.5 million items, 3.2
million are books and serials.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.140
The staff of the Hispanic Reading
Room overseas the materials,

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.610
they assist the researchers,
[inaudible] items such as maps,

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.290
recordings, manuscripts,
prints, photographs,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.320
reference books, and artifacts.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.040
The Library of Congress has massed
the world's finest collection

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.240
on the history and culture of Latin
America, Iberia, the Caribbean,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.630
and that of the Hispanic
population in the United States.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.620 position:56%
Many of the rare items were received
as gifts, such as rare books,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.480
donated by Lessing J.
Rosenwald, and manuscripts given

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.600
by Hans Crouse [phonetic].

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.200
[Inaudible] have enabled
the Hispanic division

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.640

in various formats,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.510
in addition to books
and prearticles.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.740
And now, I will introduce to
you Catalina Gómez, my college,

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.570
who will introduce our guest.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.870
Thank you.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.580
&gt;&gt; Catalina Gomez: Thank
you all for being here.

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.360
I'm Catalina Gómez, reference
librarian in the Hispanic division,

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:08.860
and is my great pleasure

"Where the Streets Have No Name",

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.360
and this was a very recent
publication in 2017, this year.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.610
And another book of poems, "La
Oración que Efraín Nos Enseñó"

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.230

of Nicaraguan 20th century poetry

"Ideas estéticas y políticas de
las vanguardias en Nicaragua,

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.890
volumen uno, Salomón de Selva".

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.970
Sharing her BA in international
relations from the Univeristy

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.400

and a PHD in avant-garde literature
from Spain and Latin America,

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.010
from the University
of Salamanca in Spain.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.220
Most of her research has
focus on the political

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.670
and aesthetical avant-garde
ideas of Nicaragua.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.510
Please join me in welcoming María.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:23.470
[ Applause ]

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.830
&gt;&gt; María Augusta Montealegre:
Well, first of all I want

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.880
to thank very much for this
opportunity to read here

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.770
at the Library of Congress,

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.720
especially to the Hispanic
Reading Room.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:47.960
Salomón de la Selva, 1893 -
1959, was a Nicaraguan immigrant

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.900
in the United States of America.

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:59.080 position:56%
If we focus in the term "Latino
writer" as a 20th century phenomenon

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.510
of immigration, de
la Selva is the first

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.740
to write an English
anthology in the USA.

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.670
This positioned him as
the first Latin writer.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:22.990
It is a pleasure for
me, to read his poetry.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.440
Casa Tropical, the translation
is mine, from the book,

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.530
"Tropical Town and Other Poems".

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.960
Cuando llegue el invierno,
te voy a llevar a Nicaragua,

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.480
¡te va a encantar!

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:48.740
Te encantará mi hogar, mi casa en
Nicaragua, tan amplia y majestuosa,

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:54.110
con su aire altivo que parece
decirle a las montañas --

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.540
a las montañas de Nicaragua,

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:02.620
ya pueden rugir y temblar,
que no me importa.

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.210
Mi casa, es sombreada y fresca,
con un jardín en el centro,

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:14.960
donde árboles frutales crecen y
amapolas como un pequeño ejército,

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.770
hilera tras hilera, y arbustos de
jazmín que te recordarán la nieve,

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:24.520
son tan blancos y luminosos,

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:28.740
tan perfectos y frágiles
cuando el viento sopla,

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.270
se agitan, y así vuelan.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.840
La bañera está en el jardín,
como una especie de piscina,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.460
con muros de hiedra y
orquídeas en derredor.

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.050
Siempre el colibrí haciendo
un sonido que invita al sueño,

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:51.010
en las noches aparece
un ruiseñor azteca.

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:55.110
Más cuando sale la
luna, en Nicaragua,

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.400
la luna de Nicaragua y
sus millones de estrellas,

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:02.780
el corazón del hombree
es el que canta,

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:06.070
y canta el corazón de Nicaragua,

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:11.560
a la súplica un desolado
lamento de guitarras.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:20.600
The version of Salomón de la Selva
was in English, "Tropical House".

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:25.850
When the winter comes,
I will take you

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.850
to Nicaragua, you will
love it there.

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.070
You will love my home,
my house in Nicaragua.

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:38.970
So large and queenly
looking with a haughty air,

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:44.240
that seems to tell the mountains
-- the mountains of Nicaragua --

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:49.010
you may roar and you may
tremble, for all I care!

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.430
It is shadowy and cool.

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:58.110
Has a garden in the middle where
fruit-trees grow, and poppies,

00:07:58.110 --> 00:08:01.230
like little army, row on row.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:08.100
And jasmine bushes that
will make you think of snow.

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:13.760
They are so white, and light,
so perfect and so frail,

00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:18.930
and when the wind is blowing,
they fly and flutter so!

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:23.140
The bath is in the garden,
like a sort of pool,

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:28.840
with walls of honeysuckle
and orchids all around.

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:33.400
The hummingbird is always
making a sleeping sound.

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:38.640
In the night there's
the Aztec nightingale.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:44.130
But when the moon is up, in
Nicaragua, the moon of Nicaragua

00:08:44.130 --> 00:08:51.030
and the million stars, it's
the human heart that sings,

00:08:51.030 --> 00:09:01.500 position:56%
and the heart of Nicaragua, to the
pleading plaintive music of guitars.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.000
Despite "Tropical Town and Other
Poems" used to be modernista,

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:16.190
recent studies show that the
aesthetic of the book can be read

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:21.810
as avant-garde because of
the intellectual achievement

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:24.110
of co-experience -

00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:32.830
That focus on the modern phenomenon
of immigration and because

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:39.080
of his protests in an
already a modern world.

00:09:41.910 --> 00:09:46.650
My translation is "Una
canción para Wall Street".

00:09:46.650 --> 00:09:54.760
En Nicaragua, mi Nicaragua, ¿qué
puedes comprar con un penny?

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:58.370
Una canasta llena de albaricoques,

00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:02.440
una jarra de barro
llena con agua fresca,

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:08.010
un rosario con cuentas de coral
y la plegaria de un sacerdote.

00:10:08.010 --> 00:10:09.990
Y por dos pennies --

00:10:09.990 --> 00:10:15.750
por dos pennies, la música
más extraña jamás escuchada,

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:21.150
salida de la garganta de un
pajarillo, un pájaro de barro,

00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:26.670
y para ser generoso, te daremos,
la palabra de un patriota.

00:10:26.670 --> 00:10:31.180
Y por un níquel, un
blanco y brillante níquel,

00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:37.390
su tierra un hombre puede comprar
una mina de oro larga y profunda,

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:42.150
un bosque que creciendo alto,
una pequeña casa con techo rojo,

00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:45.230
y el río que pasa su orilla.

00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:51.950
Más por un dólar -- tu socio
dólar, tu leproso verde,

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:58.290 position:56%
es solo odio lo que puedes conseguir
de todo mi pueblo y de mí, por ello,

00:10:58.290 --> 00:11:02.970
deja tu dólar donde
pertenece y déjanos ser.

00:11:06.070 --> 00:11:10.100
Su version, "A song
for Wall Street".

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:18.440
In Nicaragua, my Nicaragua, what
can you buy for a penny there?

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:24.460
A basket full of apricots,
a water jug of earthenware,

00:11:24.460 --> 00:11:30.080
a rosary of coral beads
and a priest's prayer.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.970
And for two pennies?

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:33.880
For two pennies?

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.310
The strangest music ever heard,

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:42.350
all from the brittle little
throat of a clay bird.

00:11:42.350 --> 00:11:48.840
And, for good measure, we will
give you a patriot's word.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.540
And for a nickel?

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:53.380
A bright nickel?

00:11:53.380 --> 00:12:01.160
It's lots of land a man can buy, a
golden mine that's long and deep,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.630
a forest growing high,
and a little house

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:10.330
with a red roof, and
a river passing by.

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:15.630
But for your dollar, your dirty
dollar -- your greenish, leprosy,

00:12:15.630 --> 00:12:21.430
it's only hatred you shall
get from all my folks and me.

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.360
So, keep your dollar where
it belongs, and let us be!

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:34.790
De La Selva continue the
legacy of Darío and Martín,

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:39.570
joining a movement
called, Pan-Americanism,

00:12:39.570 --> 00:12:44.990
that opposed to the state
politic, proposing exchange

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:51.900
of culture instead of
exchange of goods and labor.

00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.950
"Birds of Clay" is the only case

00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:59.730
where De La Selva translated
himself, also,

00:12:59.730 --> 00:13:03.940
he was a great translator,
from North American poetry

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.150
into Hispanic and vice versa.

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:16.090
Pajaritos de barro, traducción
de Salomón de la Selva.

00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:22.120
Pajaritos de barro, pajaritos
del barro colorado de mi tierra,

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:28.440
que me pusisteis en el alma los
infinitos valores que encierra de

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.530
vuestro olor me acuerdo todavía,

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:37.360
un viejo olor de inmemorables
generaciones cuando mi voluntad

00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.180 position:56%
humedecía vuestros vacíos corazones,

00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.770
con el vibrar fugitivo
de mi aliento,

00:13:45.770 --> 00:13:50.350
¿para dónde volasteis
pajaritos de barro?

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:53.060
¿Con el ímpetu de qué vientos?

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.480
¿Al son de qué cantares?

00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.370
¿Con el horror de qué gritos?

00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:03.980
Cuando me muera quiero que se me
entierre donde arranquen los niños

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:10.540
sollozo y canción, avivando las
músicas esenciales que encierre el

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:13.810
pajarito de barro de mi corazón.

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:19.220
La version original,
"Birds of clay".

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:26.800
Birds of clay I whistle
through, have you flown away?

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:32.060
I remember the smell
of you, birds of clay!

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.400
Old it was!

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:36.410
So old, so old.

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:44.480
Dust of centuries of death,
all my childhood I was told,

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.100
you would fly, and are you fled?

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:54.590
When I am dead I want to lie
where in the centuries to be,

00:14:54.590 --> 00:15:00.970
children shall utter song and cry
through the winged dust of me.

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:12.070
De La Selva was a cultural
translator, what he does is,

00:15:12.070 --> 00:15:16.930
he negotiates from form by context,

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:25.670
he constructs the Nicaragua
imaginary in English aesthetic,

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:29.330
this is call "radical translation".

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:34.830
The best example is his
poem, Tropical Town --

00:15:34.830 --> 00:15:40.850
Tropical Dance, when he uses
the [inaudible] a variation

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:46.970
of a formal English verse,
used from the 16th century.

00:15:56.440 --> 00:16:02.440
My translation, "Canción
Folclórica Centroamericana".

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:07.800
¿Cómo te parieron Pelota?

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:10.090
¡Desnudo me han hecho, Pelota!

00:16:10.090 --> 00:16:12.110
¡Al maíz vistieron, Pelota!

00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:13.960
¡El maíz no es chanco, Pelota!

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.090
¡Ay Dios mío!, no
es chancho como yo.

00:16:17.090 --> 00:16:19.440
¿Hacia dónde viajas, Pelota?

00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:23.880
Muy lejos al sur, Pelota, ¡al
sur ni el sol viaja, Pelota!

00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:25.920
Es que hay un albur, Pelota.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.860
¡Ay Dios mío!, ni el
sol lo sabe, solo yo.

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:34.710
Tropical Dance.

00:16:34.710 --> 00:16:37.540
How were you born, Pelota?

00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:39.960
I was born nude, Pelota.

00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.510
Not so the corn, Pelota.

00:16:42.510 --> 00:16:44.750
The corn is not lewd, Pelota.

00:16:44.750 --> 00:16:47.670
Not lewd as I, my God.

00:16:47.670 --> 00:16:49.630
Where do you run, Pelota?

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.030
Far from the South, Pelota.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:54.340
Not so the sun, Pelota.

00:16:54.340 --> 00:16:56.550
There is a mouth, Pelota.

00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:59.880
No sun knows but I, my God.

00:17:06.790 --> 00:17:10.670
Salomón de la Selva,
was also a world poet.

00:17:11.700 --> 00:17:15.190
He can be compared with
Season [phonetic] or Owen,

00:17:15.190 --> 00:17:23.700 position:56%
because De La Selva is the great
unknown poem of the first World War.

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:33.790
But he still followed Rubén Darío,
he remained faithful to Darío,

00:17:33.790 --> 00:17:36.690
despite avant-garde poetry.

00:17:36.690 --> 00:17:41.750
Darío was a synonym of
peace and happy time,

00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:51.140
so the iconography he uses is
modernista, but the aesthetic

00:17:51.140 --> 00:17:54.690
in which he writes, is avant-garde.

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:00.320
The bullet.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.510
The translation is mine.

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:12.060
The bullet that will wound me,
will be a bullet with a soul.

00:18:12.060 --> 00:18:20.330
The soul of that bullet will be
like a rose, if flowers could sing,

00:18:20.330 --> 00:18:30.480
or like topaz if stone would have a
smell, or like the skin of a melody

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:37.850
if songs could be touched
naked with our hands.

00:18:37.850 --> 00:18:43.480
If I am shot in the brain,
it will say, "I just wanted

00:18:43.480 --> 00:18:46.320
to explore your thoughts".

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.540
And if it [inaudible] my chest,
I will say, "I just wanted

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:54.750
to tell you, I love you".

00:18:54.750 --> 00:19:04.400
La bala. La bala que me
hiera será bala con alma.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:12.370
El alma de esa bala será como
sería la canción de una rosa,

00:19:12.370 --> 00:19:19.990 position:56%
si las flores cantaran, o el olor de
un topacio si las piedras olieran,

00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:27.700
o la piel de una música si nos
fuese posible tocar a las canciones

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.380
desnudas con las manos.

00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:36.430 position:56%
Si me hiere el cerebro, me dirá,
"yo buscaba sondear tu pensamiento",

00:19:36.430 --> 00:19:47.720
y si me hiere el pecho, me dirá
"yo quería decirte que te quiero".

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:53.580
His book, "The Unknown Soldier", is
really a paper monument for those

00:19:53.580 --> 00:19:55.970
who fought in the Great War.

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:05.650 position:56%
But, during those very hard times
for immigrants in the United States.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:13.340 position:56%
This last poem that I'm going to
share with you, called "Testamento".

00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:23.770
I also can read it as my
legacy of a Latin poem.

00:20:23.770 --> 00:20:28.880
Form poet to poet, Testamento.

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:35.390
Testament, my translation.

00:20:35.390 --> 00:20:45.350
To you, to all of you who
pure love gave with clear mind

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:50.500
and with deep emotion
and with great valor,

00:20:50.500 --> 00:20:57.830
captain of my call [phonetic]
save this soul [inaudible] to fate

00:20:57.830 --> 00:21:04.520
and if I privilege, shall return
my life to earth it came from,

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.430
I leave you my dead's glory.

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:15.220
And so, my Lord, advice with
heaven's consent, I want to die,

00:21:15.220 --> 00:21:20.270
that once, my chivalry
[inaudible] tremblors.

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:25.880
My Spanish, my English,
Indian blood now.

00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:32.670
And I have courage of centuries
tremble and of human races,

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:42.120
and of know how to be seen volcano,
rock and wave, and cloud for pride

00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:46.450
and honor, grace and fate.

00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:05.060
Now I'm going to share with
you, a reading of my own poetry,

00:22:08.270 --> 00:22:13.420
from a book called "El País
de las Calles sin Nombre"

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.450
"Where the Streets Have No Name".

00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:24.020
I'm going to do a little bit
of [inaudible] traduction.

00:22:24.020 --> 00:22:33.230
There is a YouTube song title as my
book, but the idea of this working

00:22:33.230 --> 00:22:38.360
to me, when Hillary Clinton
visited my country and declared

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:44.760
that she was amazed by the fact
that our streets have no names.

00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:52.270 position:56%
I remember when I was little, my mom
told me it was not always like that.

00:22:52.270 --> 00:22:54.860
And my [inaudible] town, used

00:22:54.860 --> 00:23:00.560 position:56%
to be an urban city before an
earthquake shuttered my country more

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:03.110
than four decades ago.

00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:09.550
After that, we devised a
new way of locating things.

00:23:09.550 --> 00:23:13.880 position:56%
We started using trees as landmarks.

00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:21.060 position:56%
In addition, we use movable
references and stones to get around.

00:23:21.060 --> 00:23:25.870
Somehow, my children
understood how to use this system

00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:30.890
by giving me directions to their
school in the United States.

00:23:30.890 --> 00:23:35.280
Using landmarks such as
yellow car and a big oak tree.

00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:39.620
I ask them -- how do
I know when to turn

00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:43.020
if one day the yellow
car is no longer there?

00:23:43.020 --> 00:23:46.470
-- They laughed and gave
me a Nicaraguan answer --

00:23:46.470 --> 00:23:51.490
mom, the yellow car
will always be there --

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:56.140
Since I come from a different
culture, here are some hints

00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:59.500
to find your way around my country.

00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:05.070
Even though the metric system is
our primary way of measurement,

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:12.150
we always refer back to an ancient
Spanish measurement called "vara".

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:20.350
We call the west, down, the east,
up, when we say to the lake,

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:24.500
we mean to the north, but
when we say to the south,

00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:28.150
it actually means to the south.

00:24:28.150 --> 00:24:33.150
If the yellow car is no
longer there, than we assume

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:37.030
that everyone will know
that location by memory,

00:24:37.030 --> 00:24:42.590
by referencing the
location retroactively

00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:46.940
as where the yellow car was.

00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:52.780
Of course, as a foreigner,
you will have to ask locals

00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:55.380
where those landmarks are,

00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:59.780
because those landmarks
come from an oral tradition.

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:05.240
If you use this knowledge you
will know your way around.

00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:09.890
To name our street is
too expensive, and yes,

00:25:09.890 --> 00:25:13.000
[inaudible] reach its destination.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:18.350
It is important to say that
with this translation I intend

00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:23.260
to honor those people who cannot
speak English and still write

00:25:23.260 --> 00:25:29.900
about their place of origin without
being read in the United States.

00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:38.260
Welcome to Managua, where 2.5
million people manage to survive,

00:25:38.260 --> 00:25:42.670
work, play, love, laugh
and find their way around,

00:25:42.670 --> 00:25:47.320
in a city where the
streets have no names.

00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.880
At the obelisk, first round about.

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:12.480
This is a poem that is
inspired by, "Birds of Clay",

00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.780
from Salomón de la Selva.

00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:21.540
It's call "The Arch".

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:25.940
A mouth that thrills.

00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:28.800
A mouth that hoods.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.780
A mouth that whistles.

00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:33.080
That [inaudible].

00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:35.490
That pip [phonetic].

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:38.380
That crocs.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.680
That screams.

00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:40.980
That squeezes.

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:42.700
That bleeds.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:44.470
That [inaudible].

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:45.770
That sings.

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:47.190
That hunks.

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:48.490
That shirks [phonetic].

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:49.790
That coughs.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:51.090
That trumpets.

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:52.390
That [inaudible].

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:53.690
That clocks.

00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:54.990
That blossoms.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:56.290
That puffs.

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:57.590
That pillows.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:58.890
That [inaudible].

00:26:58.890 --> 00:27:00.190
That whinnies [phonetic].

00:27:00.190 --> 00:27:02.270
That nights.

00:27:02.270 --> 00:27:03.570
That snores.

00:27:03.570 --> 00:27:04.870
That roars.

00:27:04.870 --> 00:27:06.170
That barks.

00:27:06.170 --> 00:27:07.470
That house.

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:08.770
That wine.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:10.070
That [inaudible].

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.530
That meals.

00:27:11.530 --> 00:27:12.830
That wales [phonetic].

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:18.550 position:56%
That [inaudible] that whispers, that
mutters [phonetic], that purses,

00:27:18.550 --> 00:27:23.790
a mouth that speaks,
a mouth that anchors,

00:27:23.790 --> 00:27:26.550
a mouth that chirps [phonetic].

00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:31.620
If you give me a kiss, I
can stood the whole world

00:27:31.620 --> 00:27:34.970
in the arch of your mouth.

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:42.460
Next poem is a little bit far away

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:47.510
from the Salomonic inspirations,
is more of my own voice.

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.640
Its name is Boa Constrictor.

00:27:53.410 --> 00:28:00.300
I sway from side to
side like a pendulum,

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.230
like the ticking of a clock.

00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:08.950
If you don't suspect
anything, you look at me

00:28:08.950 --> 00:28:13.860
as [inaudible] you sniff
the air like a Bengal tiger,

00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:20.720
preparing to strike, you wait for
me to leave my skin in some corner.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.640
I am your prey.

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:28.820
I use my body as a bait,
sinking my mortal [hiss].

00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.230
I move forward with new skin.

00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:35.160
I flick my playful tongue.

00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:41.310
I hypnotize you with my
eyes to keep you still.

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:44.040
I dart towards you.

00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.110
I call myself around your body.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:53.430
You roar furiously, you resist,
and suffocated by my embrace,

00:28:53.430 --> 00:28:58.770
you listen to the breaking
of all your bonds.

00:28:58.770 --> 00:29:07.860
I bite you injecting desire,
you are deliriously disturbed.

00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:12.340
I swallow your head alive
for you to meet my throat.

00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:18.020
I squeeze you down my neck to
your feet, licking them lazy.

00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.420
You desperate inside me.

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:23.470
Death comes suddenly.

00:29:23.470 --> 00:29:30.340
Those two translations were
made by Stacy Alba Hawkins.

00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:36.970
Now, I'm going to read
the Spanish version.

00:29:41.150 --> 00:29:44.100
Boa Constrictor.

00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:52.970
Me balanceo de lado a
lado como un péndulo,

00:29:52.970 --> 00:29:57.790
como el tic tac de
reloj, no sospechas nada.

00:29:57.790 --> 00:30:04.380
Me miras de reojo, olfateas el aire
como tigre de bengala preparando el

00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:07.270
gran zarpazo.

00:30:07.270 --> 00:30:13.220
Esperas a que deje la piel en
algún rincón, soy tu presa,

00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:19.080
uso mi cuerpo de carnada,
cantando mi siseo mortal.

00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:23.760
Me muevo con piel nueva,
saco mi lengua lúdica,

00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.110
te hipnotizo con mis ojos,

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:30.650
hasta dejarte quieto,
me abalanzo contra ti.

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:33.670
Enrollo tu cuerpo contra
el mío, ruges feroz,

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:37.130
te defiendes y ahogado
por mi abrazo,

00:30:37.130 --> 00:30:43.220
escuchas cómo se rompen
todos tus huesos.

00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:49.630
Te muerdo inoculando deseo de liras
turbado y me trago tu cabeza viva

00:30:49.630 --> 00:30:52.290
para que conozcas mi garganta.

00:30:52.290 --> 00:30:56.920
Te engullo por mi cuello hasta
los pies que relamo con pereza.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.440
Te desesperas dentro de mí.

00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.890
Aparece súbita la muerte.

00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:12.480
Voy a leer la versión
en español del Arca.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:22.330
Una boca que triza, una boca
que ulula, una boca que silva,

00:31:22.330 --> 00:31:28.900
que gorjea, que ajea, que gañe,
que pía, que croa, que estrida,

00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:35.480
que vozna, que bala, que zumba,
que zurea, que canta, que crotora,

00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:42.660
que grazna, que grasita, que
barrita, que cacarea, que cloquea,

00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:48.640
que clorofila, que resopla, que
rebrama, que chía, que relincha,

00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:57.140
que estriba, que bufa, que ruge,
que ladra, que aúlla, que gime,

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:04.420
que impla, que maúlla, que
marramiza, que arrúa, que susurra,

00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.380
que musita, que ronronea.

00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:13.130
Una boca que habla, una boca
que ancla, una boca que grilla.

00:32:13.130 --> 00:32:19.850
Si me das un beso yo puedo estribar
el mundo en el arca de tu boca.

00:32:26.090 --> 00:32:30.530
We are going to the tree
in one towards the lake.

00:32:30.530 --> 00:32:32.830
Second round about.

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:43.920
The translation of
Alba Skar-Hawkins.

00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:48.670
A damn modern dream we were.

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:56.100
We owe the first seed to
captain Martín de Estete

00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.350
and the first exploration
of San Juan

00:32:59.350 --> 00:33:03.870
into the lakes Nicaraguan's
fresh water sea.

00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:09.360
Behold the first war of
encouragements, for the richest

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:16.270
of the Indian and for the King of
Castilla nothing is impossible.

00:33:16.270 --> 00:33:21.520
With this, we began our
discourse on scarcity.

00:33:23.010 --> 00:33:28.660
Thus, arrived Henry Morgan, and
perhaps el Olonés [phonetic].

00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:32.150
The British on the Atlantic Coast,

00:33:32.150 --> 00:33:36.690
old providence indicated,
gracias a Dios.

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:44.030
How many times will the key to the
South Sea fall out of our hands?

00:33:44.030 --> 00:33:52.510
The golden key held by Martin de la
Bastide, by Alexander Von Humboldt

00:33:52.510 --> 00:33:59.910
and by William Walker
and our key to breath.

00:33:59.910 --> 00:34:05.480
We were Napoleon's
canal, Napoleon's channel,

00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:08.440
the new world Constantinople

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.450
with Squire [phonetic] we
were the route to gold.

00:34:12.450 --> 00:34:17.510
We were the key of the Pacific
from the doctrina Monroe.

00:34:17.510 --> 00:34:23.120
We were millions of channels
concession, millions of maps,

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:29.570
millions of routes, now in
the hands of a Chinese man.

00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:34.290
A damn modern dream we were.

00:34:34.290 --> 00:34:36.970
Where is my red flag?

00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.610
Un maldito sueño moderno fuimos.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:51.150
Le debemos la primera semilla
al capitán Martín Estete,

00:34:51.150 --> 00:34:55.200
y la primera exploración al
desaguadero de la mar dulce.

00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.560 position:56%
He aquí la primera frase de aliento,

00:35:00.560 --> 00:35:04.910
para la riqueza de las indias
y para un rey de Castilla,

00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:10.500
poco es lo imposible, con ella
iniciamos nuestro discurso de

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.300
la escasez.

00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:16.680
Así llegaron Henry
Morgan, y quizás el Olonés,

00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.450 position:56%
los británicos a la Costa Atlántica,

00:35:19.450 --> 00:35:23.240
Isla Providencia y al
cabo, gracias a Dios.

00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:29.930
¿Cuántas veces la llave de la mar
del sur se nos caería de las manos?

00:35:29.930 --> 00:35:34.050
Aquella llave dorada de
Martín de la Bastide,

00:35:34.050 --> 00:35:39.820
de Alejandro Humboldt y de William
Walker, y la llave nuestra del pan.

00:35:43.810 --> 00:35:51.200
Fuimos el canal de Napoleón, la
Constantinopla del nuevo mundo,

00:35:51.200 --> 00:35:56.750
fuimos con Squire tránsito
hacia el oro, fuimos the key

00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:59.940
of the Pacific de la
doctrina Monroe.

00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:04.060
Fuimos millones de
concesiones canaleras,

00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:07.750
millones de mapas y
millones de rutas,

00:36:07.750 --> 00:36:10.260
ahora en las manos de un chino.

00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:14.960
Un maldito sueño moderno somos.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:17.970
¿Dónde está mi bandera roja?

00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:26.600
Llegamos a nuestro destino.

00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:32.090
We reach our destination,
is the corner opposite

00:36:32.090 --> 00:36:37.970
to the light house
stone, third round about.

00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:49.970
The translation is from Alba
Skar-Hopkins, Latin Vulgate.

00:36:49.970 --> 00:36:56.460
It is important to know
how to listen to words.

00:36:56.460 --> 00:37:03.360
Those poor saint [phonetic]
that were once "the word".

00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:13.430
Listen when they call me Latina,
when the entire north is Arizona.

00:37:13.430 --> 00:37:22.530 position:56%
Italian towns have not inherited the
name of the Latin King of Virgile.

00:37:22.530 --> 00:37:27.970
"Oh, Latino who has stopped
being a Roman in order

00:37:27.970 --> 00:37:35.610
to rescue the aboriginal"
We have all inherit the name

00:37:35.610 --> 00:37:43.740
because we are the new world,
and at once, the original world.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:50.110
Like a plumb serpent
that bites still.

00:37:50.110 --> 00:37:56.560
But listen carefully when they
call me Latina in Arizona.

00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:01.920
Listen to what is not
an empty sound.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:08.480
Listen to how they call me
stone, how they call me dust.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:14.080
Listen Tamagastad and Cipaltonal.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:18.690
Listen when they call
me Latina in Arizona.

00:38:18.690 --> 00:38:22.010
They just call me Eve.

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:27.550
Eve, the first rebel, from
the Latin, Latin Vulgate,

00:38:27.550 --> 00:38:30.220
that the ship nailed to me.

00:38:30.220 --> 00:38:38.480 position:56%
Eve heroine transgressor, crossing
God's line and crossing man's border

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:43.440 position:56%
to give birth to millions of esters.

00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:49.050
But listen further, when they
call me Latina in Arizona,

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:52.750
how they are calling me agar.

00:38:52.750 --> 00:38:57.950
Because God has no wanted
me to die in the desert,

00:38:57.950 --> 00:39:01.180
and he has shown me a shortcut.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:06.560
God has made a way out of no way.

00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:08.980
Vulgata Latina.

00:39:08.980 --> 00:39:14.820
Hay que saber escuchar
a las palabras,

00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:20.600
esas pobres santas que
un día fueron verbo.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:28.970
Escuchad cuando me llaman latina,
cuando todo el norte es Arizona.

00:39:28.970 --> 00:39:35.340
No son los pueblos italianos los
herederos del nombre del rey latino

00:39:35.340 --> 00:39:38.460
de Virgilio, ¡oh latino!

00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:44.110
Que dejaste de ser romano
para rescatar al aborigen.

00:39:44.110 --> 00:39:50.610 position:56%
Somos los herederos del nombre
porque somos mundo nuevo y a la vez,

00:39:50.610 --> 00:39:58.000
mundo de origen como serpiente
emplumada que se muerde la cola.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:04.620
Más, escuchar con cuidado cuando
me llaman latina en Arizona.

00:40:04.620 --> 00:40:08.250
Escuchad lo que no es sonido hueco.

00:40:08.250 --> 00:40:14.850
Escuchad cómo me llaman
piedra, cómo me llaman polvo.

00:40:14.850 --> 00:40:20.740
Escuchad Tamagastad y Cipaltonal.

00:40:20.740 --> 00:40:28.020 position:56%
Escuchad cuando me llaman latina en
Arizona, como también me llaman Eva.

00:40:28.020 --> 00:40:36.760
Eva, la primera rebelde de la
Vulgata Latina que me clavaron

00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.860
los barcos.

00:40:38.860 --> 00:40:44.490
Eva, heroína transgresora cruzando
el límite de Dios y cruzando la

00:40:44.490 --> 00:40:50.540
frontera del hombre para
procrear millones de seres.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:56.660
Pero escuchad un poco más cuando
me llaman latina en Arizona,

00:40:56.660 --> 00:41:02.640 position:56%
cómo me están llamando agar porque
no ha querido Dios que perezca en el

00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:06.360 position:56%
desierto, y me ha mostrado un atajo.

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.270
God has made a way, out of no way.

00:41:10.270 --> 00:41:12.140
Thank you so much.

00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:13.940
Thank you, Catalina.

00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:17.620
[ Applause ]
