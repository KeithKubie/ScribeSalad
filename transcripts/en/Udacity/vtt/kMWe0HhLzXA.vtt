00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.530
Now for an exercise on basic solutions. Given the

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:08.310
equations below, find the basic solution for x. Remember that

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.130
since there are only two rows in your matrix,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.900
your solution must not have more than two non-zero entries.
