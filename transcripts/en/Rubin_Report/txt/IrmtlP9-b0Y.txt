Speaker 1:          00:00:14       All right people, this is it. I feel like this is a lifetime coming. Uh, we are going to be deleting our patrion page during this live stream. Uh, for those of you that don't know, Patrion, uh, has been the number one source of funding for us since we went independent back in June of 2016. That's when I started my independent production company. Uh, that's when we fully took the reigns of this company in this show. I have no boss. I am my boss. I guess I am the boss around here for better or worse. Uh, we've built a great little production company. We've got full timers, we've got part timers, we pay for everyone's insurance and dental and blah, blah, blah. We treat all of our employees great. I think we've built a really great show here. Uh, I think fan funding was the key to making this thing truly successful.

Speaker 1:          00:01:05       Uh, the fact that I can make whatever decision I think is right for the show and the business, the fact that I've been able to take sort of my, my small government principles and my, my refound let's say belief in, in capitalism and business, uh, and apply it to the things that I'm doing behind the scenes as well as the issues that I'm talking about on air in front of you guys. The last couple years have just been amazing. We've, the show is just absolutely blown up. We're about to cross a million subscribers on youtube despite often people being unsubscribed from the youtube channel. Uh, the audio podcast is basically bigger than the youtube channel at this point. I think the things that we've been talking about over the last couple of years have been incredibly relevant and seemingly every day now become more relevant. Uh, I mean, even the fact that this is all going down on patrion related to freedom of speech, and it was because of them kicking off Carl Benjamin Sargon and for cod who's been in this very studio that we built.

Speaker 1:          00:02:01       And I bought this house because of Patrion or because of in large part because of the donations you guys have been making on Patrion over the last couple of years. Um, it seems so fitting that we're going to finally do this. So I know there's a lot of eyeballs on this and I know there's a lot of eyeballs in the media on this. I know their employees at patrion watching this right now. How are you guys? Uh, I know there's big shots at Google and Facebook watching and the rest of it and I think that, uh, look, Sam Harris left patrion because of this. Uh, Jordan is deleting Jordan Peterson is deleting his patrion account today. He may have done it already. He's in Switzerland right now. We spoke on the phone briefly. We were going to possibly a Skype him in and on this, I don't think it's going to happen cause it's like three in the morning there, but who knows, maybe some surprises will happen over the course of the next two hours.

Speaker 1:          00:02:44       Um, but this seems like just the next obvious step in everything that's been going on here. I just think that at some point us the people have to push back against these tech companies. You can't keep infringing on freedom of expression. Yes, they can do whatever they want as private companies. And there's some issue whether these platforms are now becoming, uh, the, the true public space of the future. And does that have, what's the relationship between, uh, that entity as a platform that we can all communicate on and the government, we can discuss that until the, the nth degree. I am trying to apply the same principles that I apply consistently at everything else here. I didn't ask the government to come in and demand but gone to for cod, stay on Patrion or on Twitter or anywhere else. I didn't ask the government to get involved in and stop this person from getting banned or that person from getting banned.

Speaker 1:          00:03:35       I think these Banning's or a problem, you guys know my policy on gatekeeping. I'd rather much wider gates, generally speaking, as long as people are following the laws of the United States. And we don't have hate speech laws and people are allowed to say mean things and it's scary sometimes, but I would much rather have that than have all sorts of voices who are a little outside of mainstream be shut down. Especially because in these days it's not just the really bad voices that, um, that maybe shouldn't be ignored. Perhaps it's that it's coming for sort of everybody. Um, so I'm going to discuss a whole bunch of things here. Uh, we are going to be deleting the Patrion page live. So Aaron, can you throw into the live shot of the computer that is right here. Uh, right now, despite for the last month mean emailing all my patrons doing live streams, tweeting the hell out of this thing, posting it on Facebook, posting it on Instagram, and God knows what else I've been doing.

Speaker 1:          00:04:31       As you can see right now, right now we've got almost 1800 patrons that still remain in there for about $10,000 a month. Now, I don't think, all right, aren't you? Come back to me for a second. I don't think a normal person running a business would say, oh, can I take what was a, when we started this thing about a month ago when we started announcing we were going to leave, uh, or at least when the, when the Carl Benjamin thing popped, I don't think a normal businessmen is like, oh, can I just get rid of 70% of my company's revenue and we'll see what happens. But I just felt like it was just enough and I had faith that you guys were going to come with me on this adventure. Uh, so I am thrilled to say that we have done really nicely, we haven't made up all the Patriot on money, but we've done really, really nicely@daverubin.com slash donate so we are going to use this live stream for one more round of fundraising to really, uh, just blow that thing up.

Speaker 1:          00:05:22       So it's Dave ruben.com/donate if you donate while I'm live right now for $5 and above, uh, are going to give you a live shout out. And I've got a trusty iPad here and a team of dedicated professionals in the, uh, in the control room over there. If you donate via paypal, via stripe, whatever it is at Dave Rubin dotcoms there's no way I'm going to give you a live shout out. If you donate $25 or more per month, you're gonna get the Rubin report select shirt. Now this is the select shirt that are only our patrons had certain levels were getting. These will never be printed again. We've got a couple boxes on the left because they were printed patrion only obviously we're never going to print them again. So these are the last couple that we've got left. I think we've got about a hundred of them left. Let's see if we can move some of these.

Speaker 1:          00:06:06       You will get one of these. You're going to a, you make the donation, then you send us your size. We've got your email, we'll take good carrier. And if you donate 50 or more monthly, I am going to sign a Ruben report, official Mug that will never be printed again either because it's the select member mug. I'm going to sign that for you right here, live on air and we're going to send it to you and you guys will ensure that the show remains completely independent. And uh, and as I said, I've had a whole bunch of offers from networks, some that I would consider working with. I've had all sorts of offers to do more ads on the show. I've had every which way that you can think of funding something. I've had offers, we've had other people offer us big money. I like doing it this way.

Speaker 1:          00:06:45       I think it's great. I'm psyched. I'm happy. I'm content. I want to keep growing. There's so many good things happening over the course of the next year. Uh, in terms of we're continuing the tour with Jordan Peterson in May and June. We're going to hit all sorts of countries in Europe and do that again in February for a couple of weeks. I'll be in Australia. We're bouncing all over the, all over the country. Uh, in April we're considering I have an offer to do a full month of Reuben reports on the road all over the United States. I have to make sure that I actually can do it because the other thing is that I'm writing a book right now, which I've been writing forever and my due date to have the book done is uh, August 1st. So I got a, I got a lot going on and I'm also supposed to do a show and I've been doing standup again and all that good stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:07:26       Um, so, uh, there's a lot happening here, but I want to keep this momentum going. Also, the key to this whole thing is that Jordan and I also are working on a new platform. So there's a limit to the amount that I can talk about this specifically for legal reasons and, and I can't give away all the secrets and the keys to the kingdom just yet. We're working on another platform. There are huge, huge questions related to how do we want this platform to function and should this be all, you know, should it be monetized through Crypto, should we be doing torrent video streaming and how do we fully protect it so that not so that we can't, we don't have to worry about payment processors, we don't have to worry about a tech companies taking us down and all of those things. As crazy as that is, right?

Speaker 1:          00:08:08       All I'm doing here is exercising free speech. I like interviewing people and now and enjoy having good conversation and all that stuff, but we do have to think about all these things. So Jordan and I are working on that. There is a company formed with, so there's all sorts of legal things that have to be dealt with in the rest of that. We are working on that. This, what I'm doing today is just step one of all of that. So step one for me was let's get off patrion and let's move everybody so that we can fund everybody on our site. Whatever we do after this. By the way, if you're, if you're going to jump over today, ruben.com/donate and you do the monthly credit card thing over there and paypal, we're gonna be able to fold that into the new thing because we don't want people to have to sign up for a zillion things and cancel a zillion things and all that.

Speaker 1:          00:08:48       Because as you can see by the 2000 people that haven't cancelled patrion and yet people forget to do things right. So it's like I could just not delete patrion right now and just keep cashing in on these people, but I'm obviously not gonna do that. Um, so okay, here we go. Oh, by the way. So I'm going to be answering questions so you can answer questions. You can ask questions in super chat. I'm happy to take some questions there. Uh, I'm obviously going to be given some prime real estate right now to people that are the current patrons who are asking questions and I just want to say beyond anything else. And then I'll tell you some other fun stuff. I am beyond, beyond, beyond humbled and honored. And

Speaker 2:          00:09:24       I, uh,

Speaker 1:          00:09:26       I'm a better person because of this whole adventure. It is. I can't describe to you what it is like to have people all over the world just believe in you doing something. And I'm just doing what I think is right. That really is it. I'm some guy doing what I think is right. It's not any more magical than that. And for whatever reason, we live in a weird time, especially in the west, or especially let's say in the United States where we, we are in the freest country, in the history of the world right now. This evil patriarchy that we live in is the freest place ever. And people are afraid to say what they think. They're afraid to stand up and fight for what they believe in and all this stuff. And I just, I don't know what's wrong with me, but I just can't not do it.

Speaker 1:          00:10:05       So, so here I am, I'm just drawn a line in the sand and I'm, I'm doing what I think is right and I'm, and I'm reaping the rewards for it. And I'm incredibly humbled by that. So I thank you guys. Truly. So again, okay, just one more, uh, one more reset on the radio here. Uh, if you, if you donate $5 and above, uh, during this live stream, I'm going to give you a live shout out 25 bucks or above monthly. You're getting the Rubin report shirt that will never be printed again. People, the select members shirt that'll never be printed again. $50 or above. You're going to get the shirt and you're going to get the mug. And I'm going to sign the Mug for you right here. I've got a trustee sharpie. Okay. And now, just to sweeten the deal, I sent out one of the Rubin report team members to pick up an unopened bottle of patroned.

Speaker 1:          00:10:53       Okay. We just pick this thing up. I am opening it for the first time and I don't know exactly what we're going to do with this. When we originally launched on, uh, on Patrion back in 2016, we were trying to figure out fun ways to raise funds. And one of the things I did was I think for every thousand bucks we raised during a live stream, I did a shot. And if I'm not mistaken, within like an hour and a half, I had done like five shots. I was wasted. I think I ended up doing something like seven shots. It was not pretty, it was not good. And I'm older now and I'm wiser and I don't think I can do that level, but I've got an unopened bottle of patrol and as you can see here are and go to the other screen so I can show them this thing is unaltered, untouched, okay.

Speaker 1:          00:11:34       And uh, and I've got a trustee shot glass, this shot glass, by the way, you can't see anything on it right now. Unfortunately. I got this at universal studios. It used to have a decepticon logo on it, which I really loved and I don't know what happened to the decepticon let it go. But I will do a shot in honor of sound waves. So I don't know exactly what I'm going to make the, the, uh, the marks for when going to do shots. But impress me, you know, do throw out something good on just on superchat we are, we're trying to raise some funds here and then we're going to delete this thing at the end. And I hear, I haven't, I'm going to have some chili for dinner, so. Okay. So let me ask some questions or a couple shout outs. Quick to Devin, Andrew, Eric, Jeff and Travis.

Speaker 1:          00:12:10       Thank you guys. Uh, okay. Uh, on superchat go. Reuben, go. I'll do it. All right. Thank you. Good luck Dave and team wishing you the best day of here's to the future. We're here to support you. A CBD American Shaman of San Antonio. I do, you know, every now and again I'll do a little, a little if I got like an ache or something. I think I mentioned this the other day. Take a little CBD cream and a, I do like the CBD. Dave, thanks for all the great videos. I'm a size large. Um, I'll debate tomorrow about the government shut. I'm in a debate tomorrow about the government shutdown. Wish me luck. Good luck to Ya. Um, let's see, uh, for free speech. What is your opinion on the daily wire and do you wish to join? Um, well first off, I think the daily wire is doing great stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:12:53       I obviously have some disagreements with the Conservatives on a couple of different things. Uh, I have some disagreements with band. I've discussed those disagreements right here related to to some gay issues and to abortion and to death penalty and a bunch of other things. But I think Ben is a decent guy and I think despite our differences, we want to live in the same country together. We've had a good time on stage together last month at one of the Jordan Peterson events here in la, I brought Ben out on stage. The crowd went bananas. He brought me, you know, there we have this gay cake debate. So he brought me a little cupcake. Everyone went crazy and it was just wonderful. Thousands of people screaming and it's like, you know, then I look on Twitter and it's like the usual is the tolerant, Progressive Joe. Look at the homophobic gay guy on spirits together.

Speaker 1:          00:13:34       It's like grow up you children. What planets do you want to live on? Um, okay, so, uh, go Reuben, go. We did that one. Uh, hey Dave, I just want to say thank you for standing on principle, no matter the cost. You've inspired my own channel from the start and I'm grateful. That's awesome. I want a zillion people to do this. I don't need to, you know, I'm doing interviews, a lot of people do interviews, but it's like more and more and more. Let's get a little braver here. Let's keep telling people what we think. We got a lot of bad people right now that are willing to shout everybody down and d platform everybody and, and scream, you're racist and you're a bigot and all this other nonsense. They're very brave right now. And I see a lot of good people that are not brave and, and that's part of the problem at the moment.

Speaker 1:          00:14:14       And uh, we were going to fix that. Uh, so reminder, we're just raising some funds right now here. You know what if a, I'll do a shot for eh, at the net when we hit 500 bucks on super chat. I'll do a shot. How about something like that or a, you know, let's get, we really want to get people over to [inaudible] dot com slash donate though because we're trying to, we just want to make sure we have a good monthly budget so we can grow the show. We can continue to do the things that we're doing and all that. So the more of you that jump over there, the better. Um, guys, if we're getting shout outs and mugs, I'm not seeing it on here, so maybe we're not live on here. I'm not sure if anything's not being edited. So let, so let me know about that guys. Um,

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       on Patrion I'm behind free speech end you, Dave and Jordan, thank you for all your hard work on behalf of free people everywhere on my way over to Dave's new site to donate there in place of Patrion much love and success to you both in 2019. Thank you very much. Uh, another one on page on out, on Patrion on as a direct owner. Thanks a lot.

Speaker 1:          00:15:09       You know, the other part of this is, um, you know, nobody from Patriot has reached out to me. Uh, Jack Conti who sat in that chair and said that you wouldn't get kicked off Patrion for speech. You would only get kicked off for manifest the observable behavior, which is a term that I think he made up, which has the acronym mob mob manifest observable behaviors. So only a mob could kick you off cause you can't make shit up. I mean that's completely bananas. Um, I just realized that I just don't trust them. I, and it's like, look, do I trust Google? Do I trust youtube to, do we trust any of these things? Not really. But I think that the experiment of Patrion was sort of small enough that I wanted to make a move on this. And as I've said in some of the other livestreams, look, I have friends and people that I have nothing but total respect for like Bret Weinstein and column Moriarty who are staying on Patrion right now.

Speaker 1:          00:15:57       And maybe they'll be able to fight on the inside and get them to change their terms of service. Even though they didn't even follow their own terms of service because in the Patriot, in terms of service, they said, these are the things you're not allowed to say on our platform. Uh, Carl Benjamin did not say the n word on their platform. He said it, he didn't even say it on his own youtube channel. He said it on someone else's youtube channel 10 months ago. Um, and he didn't even use the n word as a racially pejorative term. He used it because he was using the language, perhaps slightly sloppily of the alt right against them. That's the point. This guy debates all right people, he is not a racist. And I also think it's sort of fitting that, um, that this all sort of boils down to to Carl.

Speaker 1:          00:16:39       Not to make it too much about him, but when I was having my wake up when I was a full on lefty and I was on TYT and I don't know, I guess I had a lobectomy, you're saying, um, when I was part of that thing, when I started waking up to what was going on related to free speech and the authoritarianism that had permeated throughout the left and, and this, this, uh, this really awful social justice monster that I think now everybody obviously sees. And I guess I happened to be one of the first people that were seeing it. When, when I started talking about everybody said, you got to talk to Carl Benjamin, you gotta talk to this Guy Sargon of Akkad. So it seems sort of fitting that the first guy that I talked to online about all this was the one who got booted. That's now causing me to leave this. And we're just taking control of our desks

Speaker 3:          00:17:19       any and all that good stuff. Shout outs to Kyle, to Joshua, to Nolan, to Noah, and to call. And thank you. Uh, one small step for intellectual is one giant leap for the intellectual dark web. Hashtag shots of freedom, uh, watching you at Jordan at the Tabernacle here in Atlanta. You guys were awesome. Keep it up. Love you buddy. That

Speaker 1:          00:17:36       was actually one of my favorite shows, uh, because it was Jordan's birthday and uh, the crowd is just fantastic. People spontaneously sung happy birthday to him. We brought him out, you know, he won't eat cake. Um, so we brought him out

Speaker 4:          00:17:50       a raw steak with the, with the candle in it. It was, it was just a blast though and the crowd was just great and we had to just a great city, a way to stand up for your principles. Thank you. Thanks for standing up for liberty. Dave. Look forward to seeing you and Jordan in New Zealand. Um, I am not going to be in New Zealand. I can't do the New Zealand leg. I'm going to leave Australia a little bit early. I got one week of the year. My family, everybody, folks, brother, sister, nieces, nephews, everybody. We all get together for one week in an undisclosed location. And that's the one week we do it. And, and for all the goodness that's going on and at, for as much as I would love to be in, in New Zealand and eat some of that good New Zealand lamb, uh, I'm not going to be, I'm not going to be there for that.

Speaker 4:          00:18:27       I'm sorry about that. But I, I promise I will get back there at some point. Trust me, it sucks. It's one of the places that I haven't been, that I would love to get to and I will get there at some point. I promise you that. Shout out to Patrick and a reminder guys, you can get shirts 25 bucks monthly. Uh, you're getting a shirt or Ruben report shirt. It is a select member shirt by the way, that we'll never be printed again. 50 bucks. I'm signing mugs. People don't make me leave these mugs in this room. I've got to get rid of, I got to move product. You know what I'm saying? Uh, let's see. Why have you not had Michael mcwhorter mcwhorter or Glenn Lowry on the show? I don't know why it's happening. I think we'd been in touch with Lowery at least.

Speaker 4:          00:19:04       Um, let me, let me look into that. Thanks for standing up for free speech. Good luck Dave. Okay, so here we go. I am going to, uh, first I'm going to open up the patrol. So make me an offer I can't refuse. I mean, that's what I'm saying. People go over to Dave rubin.com/and it make me an offer I can't refuse. I'll do a shot at patroned in honor of leaving Patrion Foria. Uh, by the way, I'm having a crazy day over here, uh, not only just with the energy around this thing. Um, but I, uh, I've shot three shows already today, which were, which were really something. Um, I don't even want to give everything away, so we've got a great show tomorrow that I taped the first thing this morning. Uh, I'll leave it up to, to mystery at the moment, but I'd really take three great shows today.

Speaker 4:          00:19:46       Um, and uh, all right, so I am opening this bad boy. It is now open. There we go. Smells like Tequila. Oh Man, I don't have any, I don't have any lime or salt or anything. We'll figure that out. Uh, hey Dave, this is a very brave move on your part. Kudos. Have you heard about the SJW nonsense? I don't remember. I don't even care about those guys. Does it really just honestly, doesn't matter. Uh, Viva La free speech. Good luck Dave. Fuck you patriot and all right, I'm reading these live, uh, take a shot for me. Keep up the amazing work. Good luck, Dave. Thanks for standing up to free speech. Shout out to Carlos and to John and to Michael. All right. Um, okay. So here's what we're going to do. I will pour a first shot, uh, just to get this thing going here. This is what the Internet is really about people. It's about people getting drunk on Youtube, apparently. I guess that's a big thing, right? Don't people get drunk and cook or their estimates? How can people get drunk and do a little fundraising? Um, okay, let's see.

Speaker 3:          00:20:48       Um,

Speaker 1:          00:20:48       so we're going to do eat patrion I don't know how long we're gonna do this. I think we're gonna probably go till about seven o'clock Pacific, probably about two hours. I'm just shooting the shit with you guys. I'm happy to, to, to answer any questions and just talk whatever.

Speaker 3:          00:21:01       Um, and uh, shout out to Nathan, shout out to Kendra, shout out to Michael. Thank you guys. Um, and yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:21:11       and then after that. So let me just plot out a little bit of sort of the way I see the future. So look, we're, we're going to move everybody to my website were read. My website's actually pretty cool. If you haven't been to Dave ruben.com even if you don't want to donate, I think we've done a nice job over there. Uh, you can see upcoming events that I have and, and you know, the rest of it, um, we are completely redoing my website though, when we're going to make it much more of a destination. So we're going to be hosting our own videos. They're making sure that, uh, that nothing can be taken down. We're, we're looking at all the pressure points online of how you would take something down. How would you demonetize something? How would you stop somebody from posting video? We're taking care of all of those things.

Speaker 1:          00:21:45       These are all also obviously within the discussions that I'm having with Jordan about, uh, the upcoming platform. There's also a series of other things. I don't want to make this seem like this is only Jordan and I are working on this. Many of the players that you know, whose names I need not mention at the moment are working on all sorts of different solutions to this problem and who knows, who knows what will be the right solution to these problems. But I'm also very enthused that I, I've mentioned this before, I'm getting a ton of, um, people from big tech companies, from Google and Facebook and a whole bunch of others that are reaching out to me that are working at these companies that are going on at the same, right? What's going on here and we've got to fight this monster. So I'm, I'm very enthused about that and we'll see if we can

Speaker 3:          00:22:28       grab some of these guys. Um, all right guys. I don't think that the mugs line at the Mug tee shirt line I don't think is loading right now. Shout outs to William and to Jackson. When are you coming to New England,

Speaker 1:          00:22:38       Dave? Um, I don't know that we have any new England plans at the moment. I will be, I have a couple of Cali things coming up, so I'm going to be in San Jose and San Diego and Riverside, California next week with Jordan Peterson. And then uh, I will be, uh, at the Irvine Improv in Orange County on January 30th doing standup. I do about an hour of standup. I bring one of the ITW guys on stage. It's a, it's an absolute blast. I was in Ontario, California, which I didn't realize was the place and we had a lot of people in Ontario, Canada, because both are ca that I think showed up to the Improv over there, but we had just a freaking, I just crushed it for an hour. It's, it's stand up like you've never seen before. I'm barely telling jokes. I go up there. I have a good time. It's politically incorrect. I get everybody involved. We do Q and. A. I mess around with the crowd. It's, it's fun. It's fun. Um, so I hope you guys like

Speaker 3:          00:23:26       come out to that. Um, okay. Um, let's see. Speaking of drinking, will you have Michael Malice on the show again, or when his new book comes out?

Speaker 1:          00:23:35       Is He an alcoholic or something? I don't see the connection to drinking, but I'd love to have Michael Analysis on. Again, Michael is a, is a brilliant guy. He's a really brilliant political thinker. If you haven't seen my interview with you should check it out. I consider him the Willy Wonka of politics. He's kind of Willy Wonka Ish. Watched the interview, you'll see it. It's also how he dresses. Uh, but he's, he's a great political thinker. He's more on sort of the AMCAP side of things. Sort of like an extreme libertarian view of freedom, which I certainly love exploring those ideas. I think he's just got good energy and he's good. Uh, Patrick, I'm signing your mug. I guess the Mug thing just kicked in. All right, Patrick, I'm signing a Mug for Ya. Welcome on board. We've got about 50 mugs left. We're moving mugs people. Patrick, you're getting the first one.

Speaker 1:          00:24:15       There you go, my friend. Thank you very much. Let's see. Uh, thank you, Mr Ruben. I appreciate all your hard work and you've truly opened my eyes to different points and views. Try to get Dr. Peterson to come down to Louisiana. I don't think we did a show in Louisiana. I'm pretty sure that after we do these three in California that that'll be it for this year. Jordan's writing a new book and I'm writing a book. Maybe Jordan will be opening for me on my book tour. We shall see about that. Uh, so there will be more tours obviously in the United States. We're, we're trying to think about some other, uh, touring ideas with some of the ITW crew. As I mentioned, I have this offer on the table for all of April, uh, all over the United States to take the Rubin Report on the road and do pretty big theaters like thousand thousand to like 1500 seats per, uh, per venue.

Speaker 1:          00:24:59       So we're, we're thinking about it. I just got to figure out if I have enough time to write. Um, so we're gonna, we're gonna work on that, uh, shout outs to Torbin and to Mike. Welcome on board guys. Thank you Dave. Please try to get Dan Crenshaw on your show. He would be an interesting guest in a rising star. I completely agree and I'm happy to report because we dropped live news on live streams, uh, that I've been in touch with Dan. Uh, he is the new congressmen down in Texas. Um, he is going to come on the show. He's a fan of the show. He, uh, he's happy to do it. We're just trying to arrange it during a trip that he has to, uh, la. And by the way, since I will have a freshman, like a freshman congressman, like Dan Crunch on the show, I will gladly have Alexandria Cortez or, uh, Omar Ilan or align Omar or whatever her name is or a to lead or any of these people that want to come in.

Speaker 1:          00:25:45       I will gladly talk to any of them. Uh, Dan is, Dan is already a offered to come on, so that'll be great. Uh, how about, uh, Ruben report APP? We're in discussions on many fronts. Uh, I have a proposal sitting in my email from a company that does pretty slick apps and we're trying to, we're basically just trying to streamline all of this. I really think that the Internet is changing right in front of us right now. Like we've had, I think we had like the first 10 years of social media that were sort of the glory years where everybody was meeting everybody and people liked being on Facebook and liked connecting with people on Twitter and you could meet, um, heroes of yours or athletes that you like or authors and people were connecting and it was all great. Then in the last couple years, the Internet started eating itself in a way and the trolls took over and the hate and all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:26:29       Now again, I say this meeting, despite the fact that I would say 90% despite I have an extremely dedicated group of loser trolls that are always following me and I just mute them. Who Cares? Um, but, uh, 90% of what I see is positive. So I think most of it's still positive. But I think the, generally it's just something to do with the human condition. People focus on the negative more, they focus on the positive. So I think people think it's all horrible even though it really isn't that bad. But that's the other reason why being on the tour has been so great because I get to see actual people in real life and they're often quite pleasant, uh, as opposed to how they are online. A shout out to Shamari and two mark. Thank you guys. A super chat. I'm with your brother. All right.

Speaker 1:          00:27:10       Right on. And keep up the great fight for free speech. I have nothing better to do. I mean really I was thinking about it the other day, like it was kind of big thing. Like some of this can be a little a bit annoying. Like I am sort of spread thin in a certain way. Like I'm trying to do my interview show, I'm trying to do stand up, I got a business to run and like I'm on tour a whole bunch of other things and now I'm sort of like half leading a tech company. Uh, you know, my weekends of just kind of disappeared. Um, and, but it's like, I don't know what else do I better do? And it's, and it's more, it's more fun to be spread thin then when you're just like, you have nothing to do. So life's an adventure. I guess you guys are, you guys are seeing my adventure.

Speaker 1:          00:27:50       Um, all right. Here's what we're gonna do. Uh, if we got 100 bucks on a, on super chat, the next hundred bucks on super chat, I will take a, a shot of Petrolia. There's a big shot too. I should not have poured that, that much of it in there. That was, that was a mistake. Um, you're the man. Ruben. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. What the hell are we doing here, people? I am deleting Patrion all alive today. Aaron, let's go to the, uh, the video there. So I'm gonna I just learned that you can refresh your page on the computer there if you press command are, that's very fancy. So I'm refreshing the page. I think I'm refreshing. Did I refresh the page command are maybe all right. I'm going to refresh the old way, the way I know how old school. I'm refreshing the page.

Speaker 1:          00:28:35       How are we doing? Did we drop it all? So we still have 1,777 people donating 9,000, $911. I people please cancel. Stop paying me there. What are you doing? I don't know what else to tell you guys. Please. You've got to stop doing it. You're, you're a, I appreciate the sticktuitiveness and the dedication, but I, you know, join me over at the website, Dave Rubin dotcom slash donate or don't, but let's get you off paid round. Let's save a couple bucks then for yourself. Okay. What else is going on here? Uh, um, okay. This iPad is going a little slow right now. Um, okay. Next hundred bucks on super chat. I'm taking the shot. Um, so what else is happening at the moment? Um, you know what? I'm going to tell you who we, uh, who we interviewed today, uh, because it was real, it was really, really, really interesting day that I think is sort of sums up so much of what's going on here.

Speaker 1:          00:29:28       And I think why you guys, why you guys dig this thing. So we started the day with Dr. Everett Piper, who is the president of Oklahoma Wesleyan University, which is a small college about 1500 students. He is a staunch, staunch defender of intellectual freedom and he's written several books on it and why, why were, were coddling these young people and why it's terrible. Uh, he comes from a, a, it's a Christian university, comes from a Christian perspective. And we talked a lot about ethics and we talked about, uh, living with honor and where to rights come from and a lot of my wheelhouse things. What with a little bit of a religious perspective that we've done a little bit before. W fascinating guy. Like I just, one of the things that I like most is when I get a guest who really you can tell, really knows their ideas in and out, uh, and can tackle them in all sorts of different ways.

Speaker 1:          00:30:14       Uh, I just loved that and he was truly a master of his idea. So we're posting in that one tomorrow. We're doing it in one piece. Uh, then, uh, we took about a half hour break, had lunch, had a salad and a, then I interviewed Heather McDonald from the Manhattan Institute. And I'm sure most of you know Heather McDonald. Uh, she's, she's a really fascinating public figure who's taken some pretty, um, politically incorrect positions on welfare, on black lives matter, on the me too movement. Uh, she writes extensively about sort of third wave feminism and how it's gone haywire and the assault on men, which is obviously becoming more and more relevant to you guys. See this idiotic Gillette Promo that they put up yesterday. Um, it's just embarrassing like this, this need for these companies to embrace social justice, which is such a Brott. It's intellectual rot and these companies just go for it.

Speaker 1:          00:31:05       Hook, line and sinker. Uh, it's just pathetic and awful. Um, let's see. So, uh, so I had Heather on, it was great discussion. Unfortunately had to cut, cut it kind of quick cause she was in a rush. Uh, so we only did about 50 minutes or so. And then my third one was really interesting conversation with the guide by the name of Tall Keenan and he is an American Israeli who's written sort of a book about sort of what he thinks the history of the Jews or the future of the Jews is going to be. Which I thought was sort of interesting because we've done a lot, um, I've done more on, especially on theology and religion related to people when it's come to Christianity who haven't done that much on Judaism, although I've had rabbi Wolpe on a couple of times. Um, so it was really just an really interesting day.

Speaker 1:          00:31:48       And what was particularly interesting about it was, um, that my day started talking to a guy who, who talks about things from a Christian perspective. Um, Heather considers herself a secular conservative, which we talked about because people don't think that that exists. People seem to think that to be a true conservative, you have to be religious. Well, she makes a great point that you do not in fact, and you'll hear more about that in the interview. And then it ended up talking, um, with somebody talking about the future of Judaism. So I thought, wow, this is what I mean. You want to talk about diversity? Uh, now they all happen to be white, although tall was, was more brown I suppose. Um, but uh, this was diversity of thought and that is the diversity of matter that matters. Did you know that Jake John and Joe three is in a row? Thank you guys. Uh, okay. Super Cha. All right, here we go. I'm a man of my word getting too old for this.

Speaker 4:          00:32:40       42 years old to 42 year olds do shot. Is that a thing? Um, well a 42 year olds about, oh, and they brought, I've got an all star team here. Let me, let me put this in front of the computer for a second. I've got a, let's put that in front of the computer. I've got Lyme, I've got salt. Oh God. That's the screenshot right there. Uh, all right, I'm going to do it. All right. Oh, but another one, take the shot. All right, here we go. Uh, it's been a long time coming. So little salt. Here we go. Got Salt, got Tequila. They had a little salt. There's a little tequila.

Speaker 4:          00:33:27       I do like lime. I've always liked lime. I like sprite. You're not supposed to drink it. I don't really drink it that often. A sprite zero every now and again, although that'll kill you too. But I do like, I like lemon lime. I like citrus. All right, there you go. So I hope you're happy person who did that. Thank you very much. Oh man, I really haven't eaten today. I had a salad and I had two glasses, a bone bra. This could be very messy. People. What am I doing? I'm deleting Patrion and taking shots of patron and we're, we're fundraising to keep the show fully independent. Look, I'm not going to, I don't intend on doing fundraisers a lot throughout the year. We, we've done a nice job. We've transitioned a whole good portion of people. The business is going to continue, I promise you that we're trying to just get to the same levels that we were at before.

Speaker 4:          00:34:11       Uh, so, so I don't know. My guys were saying we should be trying to get to a specific number right now or we should try to raise a certain amount over the course of this two hours or something like that. Um, I dunno, we're, we're just kind of playing it by ear and then I will click on patrion and delete it. Let me see. Did anyone drop? Aaron jump back over there. Has anyone dropped? I'm trying to get these people to drop. We'll anyone drop. Did we? Yes. We lost six people. That's what I'm talking about. We lost six people on Patrion and we dropped out of the, I didn't see it, the amount of money on that, but I am thrilled to report people. We are slowly dropping patrons. I can do this. I can do a 24 hour stream and just wait for these because some of these people could be dead for all I know.

Speaker 4:          00:34:52       I don't know what's going on here. All right, let's see. Time to take the shot. Bring out Joe Rogan. This is the second person. Another shot. No, I think what we're going to have to do, it will be insane. If I do this for every hundred dollars, then I do a shout. I will be dead before I'm able to press delete on this thing. So, uh, I don't know. The next shot has to be 500 bucks. That sounds crazy. But like, I don't know. It's the Internet. People do crazy things. Um, but I, I will, I'll do a couple more. We'll figure it out. All right. Good luck brother. Patrion is a joke anyway. Are you going to ever get norm Mcdonald on? Yeah. You know, I met norm at a, at Aura TV when I was over there with Larry King and chatted with him in the green room. He said he'd do it. We haven't just been able to connect, but I would love to have him on. Sometimes people say, I sound like Norm Macdonald. Um, I love norm McDonald from weekend update. That

Speaker 1:          00:35:38       was basically the last time I watched Saturday night live. Does anyone watch that crap anymore? I would love to know that in the comments. Like, does anyone watch television anymore at all? Um, I don't, I watch on Sundays, TV land does like 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM Golden Girls Marathon. And I kind of have that on the background when I'm doing other stuff in the house or just like laying there with my dog or whatever. But I don't, I don't watch any television. I haven't watched, we'll certainly s cable news or CNN or anything like that. And forever. I watch ancient aliens every now and again. And you like the ancient aliens. I like them, you know, ancient alien theorists theorize that canceling Patrion. Uh, and going over to Dave rubin.com/donate is one of the best things that you can do. A, okay, good luck brother Bill. I just did that one.

Speaker 1:          00:36:21       Um, Dave, good luck with all the avenues you're pursuing in 2019. What are your predictions for Democratic candidates in 2020? Will they fracture similar to the Republicans in 2016 or the establishment will be establishment back one candidate? I'm, I'm a little hesitant to say this because a, I'm so frustrated with what's happening on the left and the Democrats and the progressives that I don't want to tip them off to what I think is going to happen. Um, but this is just between me and you. Um, I think it's going to be a freaking bloodbath. Uh, I think that between Elizabeth Warren, let's say Bernie, uh, now they've got Tulsi Gabard. Uh, there'll be a couple others on the progressive side. They'll throw, you know, maybe a Cory booker. They'll throw in someone who's a little more mainstream. I don't know exactly who that is because there aren't really mainstream, there aren't really blue dog, more centrist Democrats anymore.

Speaker 1:          00:37:13       Say a guy like Jim Webb who was in one debate last time and he looked like he was on the wrong stage. Those people don't really exist. So what we're, we're, I think you're going to happen is, uh, if further splintering of the progressive thing and the, the Kamala Harris people let's say, are going to call the Bernie supporters racist because he's white and they're going to call them this because they're this. And you know, and also you're seeing these people try to pretend that they're human. I mean, watching you guys saw that video where Elizabeth Warren drank the beer with her husband and he just happened to be standing there and they try to pretend that they're normal, average people or Kamala Harris did the video with the music that she likes and they're just robots. It's like Trump standing in the White House surrounded by 10,000 burgers is more of a human than what these people are.

Speaker 1:          00:37:57       So in a weird way, as much as I would love, and I want to be clear about this as much as I would love for a decent Democrat to return a good liberal, uh, JFK liberal, a Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Ed Kotch and old school liberal to return from the ashes of this lunacy, it's going to get worse before it gets better. And that that person, I don't know where the hell that that person is. Uh, I, it doesn't seem to me that anyone can tell me who that person is. Um, even though you know that person, who would that be? Maybe that's a Joe Biden of 20 years ago, who was more of a mainstream democrat. But if the future of, of the Democrats is Joe Biden who is what, 70, 74, something like that, then they're in a lot of trouble anyway. And, and I, that is not to say anything about the Republicans. I'm, I'm happy to answer questions about the Republican's. Yep.

Speaker 3:          00:38:42       You got them. Um, but yes, let's see. Okay. Um, let's see, uh, shout outs to Martha and to Nathan. Let's see. A super superchat subbed for $50 on your site 30 minutes ago, long until you sign my mug. Uh, I'm not sure what you're saying exactly there. My guys are telling me the mug thing, but my iPads loading a little slow. So here we're going to do for ya imaginary person, I believe you. So I'm signing a Mug for you. I'm going to put this one aside and let guys, let's track that super chat and figure out what's going on here. Uh, Mahalo Day for all things free speech is lucky to have you as a close friend. Keep up all of the awesome Mahalo, my friend, uh, ch Viva free speech indeed. Um, hey Dave, thanks for all you do. You should have met Fred on to discuss his work on pornography and its effect on culture.

Speaker 1:          00:39:34       You know, a few people have mentioned him before. I actually have his book here. Uh, he talks a lot about people's addiction to pornography and a bunch of other things. I actually think it's a pretty interesting topic. It just hasn't happened yet. Uh, you know, I will do it. We will

Speaker 3:          00:39:46       make it happen. Uh, hang tight. A reminder guys.

Speaker 1:          00:39:50       Uh, I'm at Irvine Improv with an IDW guests on January 30th they sold out. So the, one of the funny things that my stand up shows that we didn't realize is that we do usually about 50 seats out of, usually clubs have about 300 seats are saying we do about 50 seats for a meet and greet and you pay a little bit extra, you get seated in the front. And then I meet people and shake hands and take pictures after and all that. Those are all selling our crazily quickly. So they sold out immediately. I asked the guys today to release 10 more, so I'm not sure if they're still available, but you can check at [inaudible] dot com slash events you can click over there and see if there's any more meet and greets available. Uh, but we'll, we'll make it happen. But you know what, here's what we'll do. Here's what, this is going to complicate things for my guys a little bit, but anyone that donates, if you donate 25 bucks or more a month during this live stream, uh, we'll have your email address and you, we will email you if you want to come to any of those shows and you can't get tickets to the, to the upgrade or you don't even want, you don't even have to upgrade. If you ended up at the Irvine show, we'll gladly upgrade you to the meet and greet.

Speaker 3:          00:40:49       I'll make sure it happens. We will do that. So, okay, let's move on. Uh, thanks for the good fight, Dave. Much respect. I appreciate it. Look at you. Nice

Speaker 1:          00:40:56       people will be in good on super chat every now and again. I glanced, you know, we post the live stream. This tells you a little bit about the ecosystem of Youtube, but we, uh, we post the live stream on youtube and our glance before we get on there about what's going on in the comments section and I don't know what you people are doing, what are you people do? You're all fighting with each other, saying horrible things to each other. Often the ones that amazed me the most though, I really mean this, and I just glanced for literally like literally 30 seconds and it's like there's all these people that seemingly don't like me in this comment section and I don't care if you don't like me. I actually don't. But what I would say to you is what are you doing your life? Get off this channel.

Speaker 1:          00:41:35       What are you doing if you don't like me, go find something to do. I mean, there's plenty of other things you could be doing right now. You could take a run, uh, you could play some video games. You could watch porn. I mean, there's many other you could write, I don't know. What do you do? You could make coffee, you could stare at a fish tank. There's a zillion things you could do better than just endlessly sit there. They were with [inaudible]. What are you doing? Tell me what you're doing. If you're watching this right now, which I'm sure you are, what are you doing with your life? What can we do for you? I would recommend reading 12 rules for life by Jordan Peterson that might help clean up your room people. Okay. Uh, oh by the way. All right, so we should clarify something because there seems to be a little confusion here.

Speaker 1:          00:42:11       Uh, first off, I thank you guys that are all jumping in on super chat and I know that's a cool way of getting your voice heard. And I'm reading them all right here. We're not censoring any of this nonsense. Um, but the only way we're giving away stuff, again, the shirts that are right here, which are in limited supply, I would love to get rid of them and I need some closet space. You know my studio, this is my garage, so I don't have a garage anymore. We built a state of the art studio here. Uh, and you know what I'll do, we'll do, I do this for, for patrons, but I often do videos where I just kind of wandered around and I show you the whole thing and it's pretty awesome. So if you haven't seen what, what sort of the behind the scenes of this is, is you guys on Patrion on that and that the people that have allowed us to fan fund you guys, you truly, I mean it's not a, it's not a uh, it's not hyperbole or a sarcastic remark to say that you made my dreams come true.

Speaker 1:          00:42:58       I built, I bought this house cause you guys, I built this studio cause you guys, we built a state of the art studio when Tucker Carlson walked in here a couple of weeks ago. Um, he now think about this talking about and as the number one show on cable news, I have no idea how many millions of dollars a year he's making, but it's millions and millions of dollars a year. He walks into my garage and he, he literally, I don't know if he's going to want me to quote him exactly, but it was something to the effect of Holy fucking Shit, this is your garage. Like he was, he was actually jealous of this cool thing that we've been able to build here and my freedom and all that. And that's not a knock on Fox by him in any way. He loves what he's doing. I was on his show later that night and they treat them great and he's, you know, he's become a huge ally in this space of related to free speech and the rest of it.

Speaker 1:          00:43:41       And you get the guy gets unending hate. I mean for the amount of hate that I get. It's like you attach Fox to your name and now mainstream is just obsessed with you because they just want the clicks and views that you're getting. Right. And that's why the more hate that I get, the more I'm like, oh, I guess I am doing something right. Because people say Nice things to me. I'm like, all right, well I guess I'm all right. I am doing what I think is right. But then all these people that hate me, I'm like, boy, you're really spending a lot of time thinking about me. Okay. Um, but anyway, because of fan funding, we've been able to do this, but I don't have a garage anymore. So we don't have a lot of storage space in this house. And if I can move some of those boxes of mugs and tee shirts, that would actually be wonderful.

Speaker 1:          00:44:16       Shout outs to Chris and Christine. Are they a couple? I do not know. We'll find out. Um, okay, let's see. Uh, gave $50 on your site and no place for us to enter details on there, right? A heart on my mug. When you sign it, you glorious gay bastard. Love you. Okay. So have you gave money on the site? So we'll find out who that last person was. They gave 50. Um, we then have your email address and we will email you with all of the information. So fear not, we'll get you. So I'm going to sign the Mug for you right now. I feel good about that d right there. That's a good d. And you want a heart on that thing? You're gay bastard or right? No, Homo Dude,

Speaker 1:          00:44:56       you got a heart. You got a heart too. All right, there you go. Let's see. Okay. Uh, hey Dave, are you going to do anything on comic skate and the blacklisting slash doxing of people in the comics industry? So this thing keeps popping up. I, to be totally honest with you, my bandwidth try, you know, try to imagine what my bandwidth is like at the moment to be able to take in like enough stories that are related to all of the things that are going on with this and try to do all the things I'm trying to do every now and again. Something that I know should not get by me does get by me. Um, so I know I need to pay more attention to this and also like I come from the world of comic books. I love, you know, in our green room here and I'll, I'll post some videos of this also soon and I've done it before for, for the behind the scenes Patriot on thing.

Speaker 1:          00:45:38       That's what I was trying to get you earlier. Um, I love comics. I love comics. I, I've some of my old comic collection posted in the green room right over there. Um, so I know I need to know more about this. I know there's been some like SJW madness related to comics. I know it's leaking into the video game world. And in into everywhere. Oh, I had a question for you. So this past weekend on a, on Sunday, I took a couple of meetings in the morning. I try not to work on the weekend, but it never works. I always had to doing it, but I had a couple hours in the afternoon and it was pouring rain here in La and it never rains and I had a couple of hours in the afternoon to like do nothing. And I was actually like, Holy Shit, I could actually do nothing right now. Watched a couple episodes of the golden girls.

Speaker 1:          00:46:17       Then I go into the green room here. So we, one of the bedrooms in my house is the green room and a for those of you that are on Patrion, you've seen, we have a great green room, like it's totally comfortable for all the guests. We got an espresso machine in there and we got a a fully stocked fridge with whatever they want and there we've got snacks in there. I've also got all my video game systems in there. So I've got my old school a bit and ies, Nintendo. I got contrary. I got Super Mario, I got the original baseball, I got bases loaded, I got, uh, what else do I got? I got, I got a pro wrestling, a lot of the classics. I've got a sega genesis in there, um, with altered beast and goals and ghosts and NBA live and all that stuff.

Speaker 1:          00:46:54       I've got a playstation four. The calamari already got me. I've got a, a Nintendo switch that a fan got me and I think that's it on the video game department. Anyway, so I was like, I'm going to play some video games. Uh, so first I played my brother in law in no, first I played my nephew in, uh, NBA Two k 19. Um, and I was thinking, you know, maybe one of the rewards for people that are high tier donors. Maybe I would start giving out my, my handle on playstation four and every now and again I'd play people in Nba live or NBA Two k, whatever it is, or in some other co op gains. I really, I like co op games where we're working together. I don't need to fight you and blow your brains out and spit your guts all over the place or punch a hooker if we can work together to fix the world.

Speaker 1:          00:47:35       That that's more my thing. Um, so if you can think of, so my question is this. So first off, my, my, uh, that that patrolling works, um, my, uh, nephew, my nine year old, every first I have to kicked my ass in Nba two k was pathetic. It was, but he used the warriors. Now of course you're using the warriors. You got Thompson, you got, you got, uh, you got curry. Okay. I get it. You know, you got, uh, uh, Jesus Christ. Oh my God, Duran, uh, you know, they're, they're unstoppable. Basically. I was using the 91 trailblazers, which is probably my, it's my second favorite basketball team of all time except for the 95 rockets. And he just mocked me. I like to be beaten by 30 points by a nine year old is pathetic. Uh, then I played my brother in law. He crushed me.

Speaker 1:          00:48:19       He, although he was the 93 bolts, which you know, you're using Jordan in his prime and then a, and then I was like, all right, I'm going to play by myself. Like what can I play and everything. I don't want to run all over the place and have to spend all this mental energy on a world that I don't live in. I spend a lot of mental energy on this world here that I seem to be living in, so I couldn't. I ended up playing PAC man. I literally ended up playing PAC man on playstation four because I couldn't find something sort of mindless and simple. So if you've got a simple mindless game, that would be great. I also like, I like just bullet hell shooters, so if you've got a couple of good ones, I was playing our type and Rezo gun and a couple of others.

Speaker 1:          00:48:54       I don't really have time for any of this, frankly, but if you've got some good ideas, let me know. All right guys. Uh, here we go. My team wants me to do a little reset here. I'm giving shout outs for anyone that donates at all. If you donate five bucks in above, it doesn't matter. I've given live shoutouts Dave rubin.com/donate. If you donate $25 or above monthly, you're going to get a limited edition. Ruben reports, select members, sure that we'll never be printed again. I think we've about a hundred of them left, probably less than that. Maybe about 80 of them left. Uh, and you'd be cleaning out closets space for me, which would really be great cause I don't have a garage anymore so we don't have a lot of rumor out here. Uh, that will be great. We'll give you a tee shirt and for 50 bucks a month or more, you're going to get the t shirt and you're going to get a mug and I'm going to sign it for you and we're going to send it out to you this week.

Speaker 1:          00:49:37       So do let me know what's going on over there. Canada loves you, Dave. Thank you. I love Canada. I get a ton of email from Canada. I did about 10 Canadian stops with JP and Canada and, uh, I think Canada there, there's an interesting resurgence of liberty in Canada, which is really interesting that you actually, we're going to have libertarian, a prime minister, candidate, prime ministerial candidate. Uh, Maxine Bernay is going to be on the show. We were going to do it via Skype, but I just got an email this morning. He's coming here, come in directly to the studio. Maxine Bernay, uh, will be here within the next week or so. So we'll do that one. You know what? Let's jump over to the, uh, to the computer monitor as it were. I'm going to hit refresh. Let's see. Please tell me that you people have canceled this thing. You killing me? You're killing me. Stop giving me money here. All right. We dropped 14 people.

Speaker 4:          00:50:28       We're down to 1,757 people still around $10,000. I don't know.

Speaker 1:          00:50:34       No. What I can do. What are you doing? Cancel this. Whoa. Stop please. People, you don't have to donate anymore. Even on my website if you don't want, but, but please, let's end this thing.

Speaker 4:          00:50:45       Why are we giving these people money? All right, let's see. Uh, okay. Shout out to James. Thank you very much. Uh, I'm a college student who goes to a campus that is extremely liberal and I'm somewhat of a libertarian. Any advice for me not to get killed, but still at the bank?

Speaker 1:          00:51:00       Free speech. Well, that's the state of affairs. If you believe in liberty and freedom and you don't want to bother anybody and you don't want to take their shit, but you don't want them to take your shit, uh, you don't, you might be getting killed. Um, my advice would be this, which is, this is the exact same advice that I give every college kid when I go to every college, a speaking gig that I do, which is be brave. Now. That's it. You must be brave now. You will not get out of college. Really, really hear this. I think this is the most true thing that I can possibly say. If you're in college right now and you're afraid to say what you think, do you think that it magically is gonna get better? Um, if you think things are screwed up and maybe the generation before you is the one that screwed him up, do you think that it will magically get better by your silence?

Speaker 1:          00:51:45       Do you think that the people who are allowed right now will eventually give you an inch because of your acquiescence? Uh, no. They will keep taking and taking and taking. And that's why what happened to me with this patriotic thing was, all right, we could let them, they booted some people and we, we maybe dropped the ball on some are ignored, some or that person were shady or I didn't want to make that one. The exact example of why I would stand up and defend the line. Um, but then the line moves, the line moves and if you're afraid to see what you think, now you're 18, you're 19 years old. Uh, and if you think that it will magically get better, it will not, it will get worse. We live in the most privileged in the best sense of it. We're pretty, if you live in the United State, you are privileged.

Speaker 1:          00:52:31       You are the freest person in the freest society that there possibly is. It doesn't mean you have everything. It doesn't mean you came from everything. He doesn't mean you'll attain everything, but you live in a place that will give you the opportunity to do all of the things that you want in your life, but it's on you to do them. It's on you to do them. So if you're 18 or 19 years old and you're in college right now, and you're afraid to say what you think, if you don't do it now, it'll never get easier. Do you think when you get out of college in three years and now you've got a rent, you gotta Pay Rent, right? Well, you're going to suddenly be like, I'm going to tell the world would I think, and then three years later you're married and you've got a mortgage. I'm going to tell the world what I think. You've got car payments and dog. Now you've got kids. It's three months later now or three years later. Now you've got all sorts of other payments, school payments and blah, blah, blah. I building for, I'm going to tell the world what I think. You won't. You won't, it's on you. Now. There's no better moment than right this moment to start saying what you think. And part of the reason that this SJW lunacy,

Speaker 4:          00:53:26       um, is, is spreading is because they're allowed and they call everyone racist. So they've silenced good people. There is an, I assure you guys, look, I'm doing the best I can. I'm just doing what I think is right. I say that all the time. I am just one person. And guess what? I'm still here. And Douglas Murray, Douglas Murray, who I think is one of the greatest modern thinkers that we have, who I've had in the studio. If you haven't seen our interviews, watch it. And Douglas Murray talks about extremely controversial talk topics. He talks about radical Islam. He talks about immigration, a whole bunch of things. Um, and he's gay and conservative in, in the UK. Um, I asked him, well, what makes you so brave? Why are you willing to talk about these things? What you meeting? You have this person in front of me. Why are you willing to talk about these things?

Speaker 4:          00:54:09       And he said in a wonderful British accent that I can't quite do. But he said, you know, Dave, when you get in the pool, you might find out that the water is not that cold. I wish I could done that with a little more of a Cockney Downton Abbey accident. But the point is that if you guys jump in, you might find out that all of the things that you fear are not as terrible. The monster isn't as terrible. And I'm just, I'm not saying the monster doesn't exist because it does exist, but we got to start fighting back together. And if you think at 18, if you stop, if you're thinking about these things now, you know what, let's try it this way. Imagine if my advice was, you know, what, suck it up. Suck it up. Get Out of college. Does that seem like the right advice?

Speaker 4:          00:54:50       And I don't think so. We'll see. Let's see. Um, always enjoy your perspective on what's going on in this crazy world. Come to Oklahoma City. We're figuring out the standup tour. Uh, so hang tight on Oklahoma City. Looking forward to seeing you in San Jose next weekend. Thanks for the meet and greet comps. I guess I gave you meet, greet comps. My pleasure. You said before that you're a Sinatra Fan. What's your favorite song or album by Frank? I love the question. I love not getting always political questions. If you guys want to ask me anything else, there's not political, that'd be great too. Oh, quick shout outs to marry to Kelly to fill up. Thank you guys. Um, Dave rubin.com/donate. Let me give you a shirt and a mug. People, um, I'm moving product and we're officially deleting. Patrion we'll delete in a, it looks like it's going to be about an hour.

Speaker 4:          00:55:32       We're going to delete this thing or unless I just magically do it at a nowhere. I could just get sick of this and just be like, you know, I'm hungry and I got to go. But we are deleting patrion live. I love the fact that like there are these like silicon valley, like people watching like, oh my God, it's he it there. All right. When's he going to do it? Why does this mean? It's like, it's so boring. The group think thing. It's just so boring. My favorite Sinatra Song by far, by far my way by far, every word of that song is something that I try to live up to. It's just, I'm not, I'm not going to sing it for you right now, but open up another youtube tab and listened to my way. And that is, that is how I try to live my life, that I don't always succeed at it.

Speaker 4:          00:56:10       Um, but it's just great. Let's do the line about regrets. Regrets. I've had a few, I mean, just, just listen. It's just, it's just perfection. But you know, believe it or not, I actually think pound for pound. If I could only listen to Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin, if I had to choose between one of the two, I might go dean Martin. I really, really love Dean Martin, especially when, uh, when David's cooking Italian, I can listen to Dean Martin all the time. Dean Martin's a little lighter. There's like a little more play in d more in than there isn't Sinatra.

Speaker 3:          00:56:42       And I, I really do love that. Uh, oh, okay. Sorry. Mary Kelly and Philip. I didn't, uh, I didn't realize you guys were mugs. Sorry. I'm going to sign your mugs. What I do with the pen. All right, here we go. Mary, you're getting a Mug by the way guys, do not, I've been warned about this. If you put this mug

Speaker 4:          00:57:02       with the signature in the, uh, in the dishwasher, it will rub off. So either hand wash it or I was told if you bake them, but I don't want to be held legally responsible for this. If you bake the Mug, that somehow

Speaker 3:          00:57:15       the ink like gets into the Mug and you'll be okay. So that is Mary, that is Kelly and fill up and you guys are all getting t shirts as well. Thank you guys. All right, there we go. Um, all right. You know what I said? I said 500 for a shot. We'll do 200 for a shot on a on super chat. Go for it. Shout out to you all. Thank you very much. Uh, let's see. Um, do, do, do, do, uh, if he ever gets out of the embassy, Julian Assange would be a great guest. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          00:57:46       Yeah. I'd be happy to talk to them. I wonder if we could do that via Skype. He's done a couple interviews. I think

Speaker 3:          00:57:51       I would obviously be more than happy to do that. Um, hey Dave, I'm doing $50 a month. Have you had a chance to look at Christina Bichons work? She's a professor at Oxford and wrote a book about political civility. I, the name actually does not ring a bell. I will tell you this. I went to, uh, well first of all guys, can we add, add

Speaker 4:          00:58:08       her name to the list beyond bi. J. O. N. M. I went to Oxford twice in the last year. Um, I spoke at Oxford Union, which the video is on youtube on their youtube channel. It was one of the greatest honors that I've, well, it might be the greatest professional honor that I've had. It was just an incredible place to be. I mean, if you go to Oxford, if you haven't been there, it looks like it's right out of Harry Potter. It's, it's just incredible. And they, they, you know, they have these small schools everywhere and there's such a respect for learning and knowledge and the libraries are incredible and there's just young people everywhere who are interested in knowledge. It's actually amazing. Um, I had, uh, what I think was one of my best public talks. He was extremely intimate and really lovely. I got asked some really challenging questions at the end, some really interesting stuff.

Speaker 4:          00:58:53       And it was, it was a pleasure to do that. And then I went back again with Jordan a couple months ago and it's just a great place. And you know, I've mentioned this before, but going around the world, you know, in the last couple months I was in awe. I was in Norway. I'll just mention the countries, not all the cities, but I was in Ireland, I was in Norway, I was in Sweden, I was in Denmark. I was in, did I say Ireland already? I was in the UK. Uh, obviously we're in the states. We were in Canada, we're going to be doing France and Germany and we're trying to get to the Middle East and a whole bunch of other places

Speaker 1:          00:59:22       in the next couple of months. But seeing that these ideas permeate around the world and that people, I mean, trying to think how cool it is that somebody, right now, there's somebody in Brazil watching this, thinking a similar thought as someone in Iceland who's thinking of some similar thoughts as someone who's in Jordan, as someone in Russia. I mean that, that's actually incredible and that's a really beautiful thing and that's why the Internet has to be protected. And that's why we have to protect free thought. And it's why we have to protect our ability to communicate each other with each other. So let's keep doing that. Kyle, you're getting a mug. All right, let's go. Um, keep fighting the good fight, Dave. All right. That's the plan. That is the plan. Kyle, you are getting a mug. Okay. Thank you very much. Uh, all right, quick reset. Since we're about an hour and, or, you know, let's go to the, uh, let's go to the computer. Over here. We are on the computer. Now please tell me that we lost at least a hundred people. I don't know what to do here to get rid of you people. Uh, 1757. We are down to 1756. That's right people.

Speaker 1:          01:00:28       And the 20 minutes since I did that, we lost one person and I thank you. Whoever that is. You know what? I want to send that person a month. We'll send that person a mug. If we can find out who that person is. I want to send them a mug and a tee shirt if you just canceled on Patrion. Thank you. I don't know what I can do for you guys. So I have to send you guys money. Maybe I should start a Kickstarter to raise money to give money to you people to cancel the patrion thing. Uh, Lordy, Lordy, a Mug for Carrie. You're getting a Mug, sister. Thank you for support. Uh, it's much appreciated. All right people, I'm ready to do another shot at patrol. I don't know what's happened here. Let's, uh, let's make it happen. 200 on super chat or a, or you know what, a hundred monthly on Dave Rubin.

Speaker 1:          01:01:10       Dot. Conversation donate. We'll make it happen. I don't know, I'm just having fun here. Like let's just keep rolling. Um, you're a legend Dave. Keep up the good work. Can't wait to see you in Australia. I really can't wait to go to Australia. I get a ton of email from Australia. Australia I think is our fourth most listened to country. Usually it's the United States, Canada, UK and then, and then I think Australia and Germany or sometimes Australia and Sweden. Flip on that on the next most followed. Now Sweden's a particularly interesting case because there's only about 10 people that live there. And I think, I think I met everybody at the two shows with Jordan, the second show that I did with Jordan in Stockholm, which was an amazing theater and they were two of my favorite shows. I really loved all the Nordic countries actually. Um, but the day before we did the second show with Jordan, um, the Swedish foreign minister whose name is escaping me at the moment, might be Kiersten something. Kristin, Kristin something. Uh, she said that she wishes the Jordan Peterson would crawl back under the rock. He came from off the foreign minister of a Western country was upset that a clinical psychologist who talks about free speech and, and personal responsibility and the rights of the and and

Speaker 4:          01:02:20       defending the, the values of Western society. She wants him to crawl back under the rock he's came from. I mean that's how stupid everything has gotten. A though I do have to thank her because I got a lot of good laughs at her expense. A super chat. Thank you for doing what you do Dave. You got it. Hey, I signed up for 50 hours a month. I was wondering what your favorite car was. Um, man, these Teslas right now, have you guys been in these Teslas? They are UN freaking believable. Like driving a Tesla and then driving any other car, the newest anything and you will be like, wow, what a jump in technology. I mean they are smooth and clean. There's no buttons. It's all on that huge screen there. There are self driving, you know, the model x has the Delorean style wings.

Speaker 4:          01:03:05       Um, they're just absolutely like sick and cool. There's a ton of them here in La. Uh, and on top of the fact that they're fully electric obviously and everything else and a lot of must shot went into space just because he could, I mean that, that's something I'm the minister of foreign affairs in Sweden is Margo Walstrom. That's right. Margo Walstrom. She is not Kiersten anything. I made that up. Uh, let's see. Um, when you interview Maxine, Bernie asked him about the dairy industry. He says he wants to follow in Australia path. However, Australian farmers killed themselves in shop in shocking numbers when they eliminated quotas. I will be totally honest with you. I don't know anything about that. Let me do a little research. I'll try to make it happen. Okay. Um, nonpolitical question, ginger or Maryanne, oh, sorry, I forgot. Geo Gilligan or skipper, what's wrong with you people?

Speaker 4:          01:04:02       You know, like really why, what kind of question is that? Skipper, obviously, but what, what's wrong with you? You know, it's an odd question. Why are you asking that? Uh, Shah Mug for Christian. All right, here you go, Christian. Thank you guys. You know, one of the things that you're also doing in the meantime, so we are building out this platform. As I said, we're trying to figure out ways to secure the monetization. We're trying to figure out ways to secure the video hosting to secure, uh, not only that, but the, the web hosting, there's ways to decentralize that even we're, we're trying to figure out all of the pressure points and how do we deal with them systematically and make sure that we're taken care of on all fronts. We're trying to figure out what it, what does a terms of service in 2019, what does a true terms of service look like?

Speaker 4:          01:04:43       Should it be as simple as, it's just you have to follow the laws of the United States where we have no hate speech laws, but you can't, you know, make a terrorist threat or yell fire in a crowded theater or a criminal threat or direct violence, things like that. Could it be that, well, there's an argument that that could be it. And I think that's a legit argument. But then what happens the day we opened this platform, all of the racists and the white supremacists and all of these awful people, let's say they get on on the site. Now, I'm not against them expressing their free speech. I think you guys obviously know that even if I find their ideas, I pour in. The problem is that, imagine

Speaker 1:          01:05:18       now we start this site and out of the first 2000 accounts, 1500 of them are these people because they've been banned off the other sites. Well now what is the entire media? And we know the media is just mostly a bunch of nonsense anyway, the, the entire media now jumps on board and is, Oh, you see Reuben and Peterson or running the outright racist website. And then, you know, we uh, we'll hopefully have investors and board members and all that. And then all the pressure is applied on them. So we have to, we have to calculating Lee and clearly think about what does it terms of service look like? How do you launch a launch, a new platform as a platform and have to be launched that on day one everyone's on it or should it be, I'm coming around to this idea that it would be a tiered invitation system.

Speaker 1:          01:06:01       So let's say we launched with say 50 people, right? So let's say it's like sort of IDW people in adjacent people and then then that sort of the Beta test version of it, right? As the creator. But anyone can sign on to follow a creator, but that's the creator tier. And then maybe over three months as we're testing all things out, each creator gets five invites to five other creators and then you exponentially grow from there. I think something like that could be interesting. I also think people are sick of the fact that anyone can get on anything and do whatever they want and the whole thing's a free for all. I think actually people do like some rules, but they liked him to be actually enforced consistently. Not In this crazy way that they're enforced right now. Shout out to Cody. Thank you very much Cody.

Speaker 1:          01:06:40       Uh, if I remember your, if I remember correctly, you were a blazers fan. I think the Blazers get rid of either Lillard or McCollum if they don't make a deep playoff push. So I'm an early nineties, a blazers fan because Clyde Drexler was my favorite hero. Uh, if you weren't an NBA fan in the early nineties, uh, Clyde, the glide was basically the number two shooting guard to Jordan for all of those years. And I just liked the guy. He was smooth. He didn't make a big stink about everything. He was in a showboater. He got his teams to the NBA finals twice in 90 against the Pistons in [inaudible] 92 against, uh, the bowls. And then in [inaudible] 91, they made it to the western conference finals against the Lakers. He lost a couple of championships and by the time he was, he was really an old guy. Uh, 32 years old.

Speaker 1:          01:07:23       In 95, he was traded to the Houston Rockets where he had played for the Houston cougars by Slamma Jamma with the Chemo Olajuwon. Uh, he was traded to Houston and he won a championship. That's my favorite team of all time. Um, so I don't know exactly how much is going on with the blazers right now. I don't want Lillard tall to overtake Clyde though in all time. Blazers scoring. So I'm hoping that's not going to happen. Okay, there we go. Um, I'm dying to take you and Jordan out for a beer. Let me know when you're going to be in Vegas. I do a show on the strip. I'd love to drink my crown royal from your autograph Mug. The autograph monk does go well with Crown Royal. Um, we didn't make it to Vegas. I don't know. You know, there's a couple of cities that people have asked about that I'm not totally sure why this or that didn't happen. You know, there's all sorts of considerations on a tour that they try to figure out and I don't know exactly what, uh, the answer, but that was all right. Here we go. I'm going to jump back to the, uh, to the computer screen. We are trying to

Speaker 4:          01:08:16       get you people off. Patrion so I'm going to hit refresh. Come on, people tell me you dropped on Patrion I don't want money on patrion 1756 and 1755. This is going to be the longest. This is going to be the live stream from hell. People. Uh, I'm trying to get you people to cancel. I don't know what I can do. I'm deleting it either way. So no matter what happens at seven o'clock tonight, a couple of minutes before seven, I'll do it. Uh, you know, look, I could leave this thing up and just cash in on that and I could probably cash in on it for a long time because people sign up for things and forget. I'm obviously not going to do that, but I would love to see more people cancel this thing at least. But in the meantime, as we roll out a whole bunch of this stuff, uh, we are moving people over to my website.

Speaker 4:          01:09:00       So if you donate five bucks or more, I'm giving you a shout out right now. It's Dave ruby.com/donate 25 bucks or more a month. You're getting a tee shirt, 50 bucks or more a month. You're getting a signed autograph Mug and uh, and yeah, let, let's do another shot of petroleum. I'm feeling it at this point. Let's make it happen. Let's see. Uh, I just got here. Are you aware of Youtube or laws, FTC complaint, he's working against Patrion and paypal. Would you have them on your channel? So I, I know of this video and I've heard about this guy. I actually haven't watched it yet. Uh, but it sounds like there might be some legal issue related to collusion or something like that. Uh, I need to know a little bit more about it before I specifically comment on anything. Look, my preference on all of these things would not go be going through legal roots, although sometimes there's a need to do it.

Speaker 4:          01:09:48       Uh, and, and going through governmental force, uh, although I guess sometimes perhaps there's a need to do it. I know that sets bells off with the libertarian set. Uh, my, my preference would be that human ingenuity and, and, uh, creativity and the human mind will resolve problems. I think that's the way it's always been done in the best ways and human history. And I think that's what can be done here. A mug time. Jim, you're getting a mug. There you go, Jim. Thank you very much. Welcome to the team and a shout out to Nicole. Thank you very much. Let's see a super chat. I got called a white supremacist. All writer today for re tweeting Dave's tweet about family guy self-censoring gay jokes due to SJW pressure. The world is upside down. So if you haven't seen this, I tweeted this yesterday, there was an article in entertainment tonight or one of these type of sites that the producers of family guy have decided that they're going to phase out gay jokes. Now, uh, I tweeted about this because I want you to really think about how bananas is and when people say, oh, there's SJW stuff doesn't matter in this free speech stuff doesn't matter. It's just happening on college campuses and it's just a bunch of kids and all of that. It, this is why it is utter and complete nonsense. We need humor to laugh at things. We need the ability to release some steam. Sometimes we need to be able to make fun of people and sometimes groups and all these

Speaker 1:          01:11:14       things. So to show that we're all equal, watch it. Watch don Rickles do in comedy. Go on Youtube later and watch don Rickles do comedy. And he made fun of everybody. He made fun of Jews and gays and Christians and white trash and Asians and everybody. And it made everyone in the audience realize, Whoa, we're all part of the American experiment. But what the left is doing by judging us so intensely on our immutable characteristics is these are the people who are obsessed with our differences. And they want us to be exactly the same at the same time because they're, their ideology has no logic. And that's why they're so angry all the time. And that's why they're so bitter and resentful. And that's why they're, they're always trying to d platform people because they don't want to debate ideas. So the problem with this family guy thing is that first off, let's just put aside whether family guys funny or any anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:12:05       It had a couple of good years for sure. I really respect Seth Macfarlane. Basically, I like the guy, I think he's probably a decent guy. He has made millions and millions, maybe hundreds of millions of dollars. I have no idea on being politically incorrect. Think about the characters, the old gay child molester that always wants to molest Chris. Uh, more, more. Goldman is the worst Jewish stereotype you can possibly imagine. Uh, the, uh, the other two gay guys in the show, the episode where Peter Becomes Gay. Um, everything in everything in the show is a, is an awful stereotype, but it's, it's either funny or it's not funny, but you, that's up for you to decide for them to say, ah, we've now, and I'm not saying Seth made this decision specifically and by the way, I've invited him on the show many times. I would love to sit them down, sit down with him and I'm not judging him specifically for this, but the, the, the machine of family guy made a ton of money being offensive to all sorts of people and now you know, we're in our twilight, nobody really cares about us anymore.

Speaker 1:          01:13:02       No, we're going to turn against what we've done. This is like when you see Sarah Silverman now chide comedians for being politically incorrect or I remember when Milo's book was coming out, she was a tweeting about that Simon and Schuster should drop the books and now we have comedians for getting rid of books. That's pretty close to book burning. That's the modern sense of book burning that has nothing to do with anyone's feelings about Milo. Um, these people have become hysterical and, and the hectoring things that they should be making fun of. If George Carlin was alive today, what do you think George Carlin would be doing about that? Ideas? He'd be mocking them. Not demanding that we don't tell jokes about certain things or we don't let certain people publish books now. That's the whole reason I got back into stand up, even though it was like the last thing that I wanted to do.

Speaker 1:          01:13:39       I want people to see that you can laugh about these things and guess what? I go up there and I look around the crowd and they make fun of everybody and in that includes myself. So I think we can fix this stuff. But I think we can fix it through, through comedy mostly. Um, so come out to one of my stand up shows. January 30th I'll be at the Irvine Improv, a Dave ruby.com/events uh, shout out to Jason. Thank you very much. Um, uh, super chat. Your biggest issue will be that paypal, visa and mastercard. Uh, sorry, I want to read this correctly. Your biggest issue will be paypal, visa and mastercard that force you

Speaker 3:          01:14:11       to shut down, not the backlash. If you go 100% free speech, no one can pay you then and that's how you shut you down. So I, I may have missed a word in there.

Speaker 1:          01:14:20       Um, okay, so this is an issue, right? So if right now at [inaudible] dot com slash donate, if you use your credit card, you can donate through stripe, which you, which is paypal, you know it's credit card so you can donate there. Any credit card. It's a payment processor. Um, I have no reason to think that stripe is going to get rid of me, although they have gotten rid of some other people. But I have no reason to think that's gonna happen to me. But this isn't just about me, obviously. Um, I have no reason to think that paypal is going to get rid of me. And again, if just think about this for a second, let's pretend you're right and you might be right. If we're really worried that, that someone like me, let's say, could actually potentially be stopped from making financial transactions in the United States, then then think about the level of tyranny we're really talking about.

Speaker 1:          01:15:01       And if you're saying that's here now, well then again, we better start talking about this shit and fast. So, um, I do think the answer is partly lies within crypto. We are now taking bitcoin on right there below, uh, paypal and, and the credit card thing. You can see our bitcoin wallet, it's on there. Uh, and as I said, we're, we're, I'm also talking to a whole bunch of other payment processors. There's ways, there's creative ways people have figured out to do all sorts of commerce online and we're exploring all of those options. So hang tight. But if you are right and if you're watching this and you think that that guy's comment might be right then man, we better fix this quick. Otherwise we're, we're

Speaker 3:          01:15:37       really, we're far more screwed than you might think. Uh, okay. Um, I donated $5 a month and I didn't get a shout out. I'm sad now. Anyway. Best shooter ever is radiant silver gun. It was a Saturn game. I missed the Sega Saturn. Um, we were doing shout outs. If you do it, I'd Dave rubin.com/donate. So you might've done it on super chat cause that's where I just saw that. So I don't, unfortunately, I don't know your name. He didn't say it there. Uh, okay. Let's see. Let's see. Any News on the Patriot and replacement? My whole platoon at Fort Bliss, Texas is wondering when you will be in Texas next. Well, first off, thank you guys for your service. Most importantly,

Speaker 1:          01:16:14       um, did a whole bunch of shows what you are in in Texas. Um, we did Dallas, we did San Antonio, which I loved. I had never been there before. I've been to Dallas a bunch of times. Um, we did Houston, which was really cool to be, and it was humid as fuck. There it is hot in the summer in Houston. Um, I will definitely be back there. I think I'm going to do a public event with a, with Glenn Beck at some point, probably in the Dallas area, and I should look into doing some standup in a, in Texas. So hang tight on that. Uh, okay. Let's see. Where are we at? Please tell me we dropped at least two people. You're killing me here. People. What do we got on Patrion? Right now we're at one seven 1,755 I'm clicking refresh.

Speaker 5:          01:16:54       All right. That's what I'm talking about. Dropped six people, but our money went up. Our money went up. Am I correct? I am correct.

Speaker 1:          01:17:05       What was our money up before? And we just went up like 1000 bucks on Patrion. What the,

Speaker 4:          01:17:11       this is the Internet. This is as internally as it gets. This is, this is the Internet. I am trying to lose money on Patriot and our money on Patrion is going up.

Speaker 6:          01:17:27       Hmm.

Speaker 4:          01:17:29       You're funny. Whoever you did, whoever you are, and I'm assuming it's one person points for you. You know what? You know what? This is messed up. I don't want to do this, but just because the person's that's a high level of troll. Who puts their money where their mouth is. We, we know who it is. We'll figure it out because you donate it on Patrion so we get an email. I'm giving you a mug even though that's really messed up. You're getting a mug. You're motherfucker. All right. There you go. You're getting a mug. The money's going up. The ridiculous. All right guys. We've got about 40 minutes left I a little bit before seven. I will delete Patriot and no matter I can be a $25,000 a month. We're going to delete this thing. Uh, I do not know what to say to people like you.

Speaker 4:          01:18:13       Um, let's see. Uh, th the book, the coddling of the American mind is an amazing book. It's a must read during these times. While I've had a, Oh, that's Jonathan Haidt who I've had on the show years ago. We almost had them back on two weeks ago. He was in la, but we couldn't quite work it out. I will definitely get him back on. Hang on that, uh, March in. Thank you. Is that my old friend marching from, from New York. Could that be, could that be him? I used to have an old buddy marching, m a R C I n in New York. Is that him? Could that be you? You gotta sign Mug my friend. Oh, I think you just did a shadow, but you know what? You're probably getting a mug. Uh, cause I read that off the wrong thing. Uh, okay. Let's see. Um, uh, $99 and 99 cents. Take a shot. Love you Dave. Mad respect. You know what? For doing 99, 99 shot a patroned for you. There you go. We don't mess around here. This is a pretty big shot. Glass to a. All right, we're going to get a little salt. Here we go. All right.

Speaker 6:          01:19:19       Little Salt. Oh, patrol.

Speaker 4:          01:19:32       I like Tequila. I do like Tequila. I'm a, I'm a red wine drinker. As most of you guys really know. I like Napa reds mostly. Um, or northern calorie reds. Um, oh, I really like Italian reds lately, so I really only drink wine, but I do like Tequila when it, when it comes around. Um, I think it's a different Martin, he was known as Martin even though it was Marson or marching, but I believe it's a different marching. But hello march. And how are you? Um, okay. Uh, bad boys. Pistons versus up and coming Bowles was my favorite NBA time. Made you laugh? The Ginger Mary

Speaker 1:          01:20:09       a question. That was the point. All right. There you go. Uh, yeah. You know, I hated those pistons. The bad boys Pistons. They to me, that was in basketball. I hated bill Laimbeer. They also beat my blazers in 1990, which was a very underrated series. All the games were within two or three points. And one of the Games, I think it was game three, the game three, it was game mode. I think it was game four or five. Danny young who is a scrub backup on the blazers. He hit a shot at half court, that would've got the game into overtime. That A, they waved off at the Buzzer. Uh, but it was a, it was a great series. Um, shout out to Ricardo. Welcome on board Ricardo. Um, let's see. Uh, is Ian McGilchrist on your radar yet? His book is enlightening in the way it explores how we're divided brain alters behavior, culture and society. Given the name sounds vaguely familiar. Um, but I can't say he fully has. Guys, can we put Ian Mcgilchrist on the list? Um, 100 bucks. This is the weirdest pledge drive I've ever seen. Lol. This is, I'm trying to lose money in effect at some level, I suppose. And we're gaining, if I press this right now and there's more money in there, I'm actually going to punch the camera. Here we go. We have 1,749 patrons, $10,620. All right, let's see it drop. Let's see it drop.

Speaker 1:          01:21:31       Wait a minute. What happened there? We lost five. We lost $5 people. That's what I'm talking about. Lost $5. How many people did we lose their couple of people. We lost $5. Whatever you do please, people, I implore you for the sake of free speech in America for the future of the First Amendment, do not donate a patrion.com/ruben report. I'm deleting it. Don't go there. Go there to delete, but don't go there for anything else. We got in this thing. It's a nightmare. A shout out to Kim. Thank you very much, Kim. Uh, I'm starting to wish you chose January for your annual social media blackout. That's funny. That's funny. I do August off the grid. You know, I'm going to really push I think this year, uh, as many people as possible to join me on this thing. I do a 30 day cleanse. I mean, that's the only way I can describe it.

Speaker 1:          01:22:19       Completely off the grid. No phone. I locked my phone in a safe, which I don't know the code to a no television, which it's almost impossible to avoid television. It's really hard to avoid news because, hey, you got to tell everybody that you're not listening to the news. Because I try not to get anything in my brain during that, you know, I'm doing other things, but I try not to get the day to day news in my brain because it's just, we're just endlessly hit with information. I don't think this is the way we were always wired to be. Maybe it's the future, it's the next evolution of being a human. But I don't think it's supposed to be like this all the time. Um, but I realized the hardest part of being off the grid is that everywhere that there is a muted television, there is CNN, every airport, muted television, CNN, every burger, joint, muted television, CNN, you go to the gym, you did television, CNN, if you will.

Speaker 1:          01:23:06       I don't know that anyone's listening to CNN with the words, which would be, it's hilarious if you do. Um, but, uh, yeah, I highly recommend doing a little off the grid thing. I try to do it on the weekends too, to the best degree that I can. Not as, not as strictly as I did in, in August, but this, this August. I think I'm going to try to get as many people as possible to do it. A shout out to Keith. What are we doing here guys? Quick reset. Uh, we're moving everybody off patrion and we're trying to get people to Dave rubin.com/donate it is the first of about five steps over the next couple of months that I'm doing. Two just to get true independence to have true sort of ownership over our content and audience and the rest of it, we're going to remain fully funded by you guys, which is fantastic.

Speaker 1:          01:23:47       I have no boss, no one has ever told me anything to do or say on this show. We do what we want. I do what I think is right for, for all the positives and negatives of all of that. So we are doing a little fundraising here today and then deleting Patrion 25 bucks. You're getting the last remaining Ruben report. Uh, Patriot on select tee shirts and a, I'm going to sign a Mug for ya for $50 or more. A month. Shout out to Raymond. Thank you very much. Hey Dave, is Gillette the best a man can get? I mean Juliette's like I've just had it with you people. You know what I mean? It's like you don't have to turn on half the people to bow to the social justice God. You don't have to make men look toxic and, and it's just ridiculous.

Speaker 1:          01:24:29       Pandering idiocy. And you know, it's interesting there's this meme of go get woke, go broke implying that the companies are going to fail because of this. I don't know that that's actually true. Maybe they are making more money because of this, but it's not good and it's not right. And guess what? I don't give a shit about the politics of the company. I get my razors from, although I can tell you that going forward I would go out of my way not to buy a Gillette product for sure. It's like Ben and Jerry's did that, uh, resist ice cream. I don't even think Ben and Jerry's is that good anymore. Um, I really like McConnell's ice cream, which is a, a creamery in Santa Barbara up here. I don't know that they're all over. They're, they're nationwide, but if you live in the California area and probably west coast Mcconnell's ice cream is awesome.

Speaker 1:          01:25:10       They got a, they got a cookies and cream that is fantastic and a sea salt something or other. That is amazing. But anyway, it's like, all right, if you guys are putting all in that we're going in Hashtag resist. It's like, I just don't want to give you my money. And then people will say, well Dave, you're a hypocrite because you still eat a chick filet. It was like Chick-fil-a isn't putting, we're four. We're against gay marriage on their chicken sandwiches. The owner once gave a couple of hundred bucks to some anti gay marriage thing or something to that effect. It's like, who cares? People are allowed to do private things in their private lives and it's like you guys think that if you could only control the way everybody thinks and the way everyone behaves, that the world would be better and I think the world would actually be much worse. I don't care what anyone does or thinks as long as they don't do it to me or on my property, just don't touch me. That's really all I ask. Let's go to Patrion and watch this thing dump out because I know you people are canceling for me. So right now we're at 1,747 were at $10,615

Speaker 4:          01:26:05       please have dropped. We're up $52

Speaker 5:          01:26:12       look,

Speaker 4:          01:26:13       I get what the Internet is. You know I get it. You're funny. You're funny people having a good time. You know watching the livestream, you know watching the youtube or do youtube, you're killing me. I have to leave this thing. I have to go. Please stop putting money there. You think this is funny. This is funny. This is my life. 50 bucks on super chat. Signed the Mug to my wife. Just fee fee. So you in Orlando and loved it and Doby was slammed that Tequila like we do in Texas. All right fee you're getting a mug fees. Getting a mug fee is a great lady fee. F E and I'm putting an exclamation point for her. Cause I feel good about fee and I'm signing in the Mug. Uh, that Orlando show was one of my favorite shows. I, I say it, all of that.

Speaker 4:          01:27:05       A lot of the shows that I use, and I do mean it when I say it, that Orlando show is fantastic. That theater was gorgeous. I think those Disney, it was like the Disney something theater. I think the Disney people are going to be okay financially by the way. Um, that was a great, great, great, great show. We did four shows in four nights in Florida and that, that Orlando one has stuck the ones that really stuck out with me. The Atlanta one, cause it was Jordan's birthday. Uh, Orlando was amazing. Grand rapids, Michigan I think might've been the best show we did. And, and the first time we were in Calgary we blew the roof off the place. It was actually legitimately crazy. It was, it was bananas. Mockers. Shout out terrain, man. Thank you very much. Okay. Um, thanks for standing on principle Dave. Yeah, my pleasure. Um, do you think there is hope to end this far left path that we're on? First of all, I got to take some water. I'm choking so I cannot believe people are still donating to patriot. This is like, I feel like I'm in green. I'm going to actually you an episode of Black Mirror. This is black mirror. This is it. We're in Bandersnatch right now. You guys are picking my future. You know what I mean? Like we're, this is bananas. Um, the question was, um, what the hell was the question? Oh, there was a question there.

Speaker 5:          01:28:24       What, what?

Speaker 4:          01:28:27       It's there. Ah, do you think there's, there's an end to the far left path where I look, this thing has to implode one way or another. The question is how bad will it get before it implodes and how much power it will attain before it implodes. The that is, that is the true question here. When, when Cortez or some of these people talk about 70% marginal tax rate and then people scream all that, they should have it and your role, they don't, they're not going to take 70% of your money. They mean above $10 million. Now, let's pretend now I don't make $10 million. I don't make $1 million a year. Let's

Speaker 1:          01:29:02       pretend for a second that, um, that you made $10 million a year. Let's pretend you made $20 million person watching this right now. You figured out how to do something. You created something of value, something you made up a product. You made a candy bar, you made a video game, you, you sold a wine. You are an incredibly successful locksmith. Whatever the hell you are, you're not making $15 million a year. Now basically the federal government, when you're making that much money, you're in the top 1%. Let's say, um, I'm just doing rough numbers here. The government is going to tax you at basically 37% right now at that point. Now, if you own your own business, you can write off some stuff. And let's say you can get that down to about 30% what she's proposing is that over $10 million that you take in the government should take 70% of that now for young people and the Socialists crew of America, that all sounds good.

Speaker 1:          01:29:53       You don't need that money. You don't deserve that money. You didn't build that. All of those things and it just sounds right. It sounds right, like you should give back more. Why do you need that much money? Except that has nothing to do with truth or what's right. What right does someone have because they feel, because some government bureaucrat feels that they should take from you who created to give to someone who did not create, even if their intentions are good, what gives them the right to do it? I would say they have no right to do it, but this is the new left and some would argue this is the old left like some old school gave me. I think if Prager was sitting here or Shapiro, they'd say, this is what it always was. I don't know that it always was this way because I think there used to be a decent left.

Speaker 1:          01:30:41       And I think it's important that we have a decent left once again. Um, this is a horrible set of ideas and that's not just the only part of this, that's a horrible set of ideas. The fact that Tamika allow, uh, Mallory, who was one of the leaders of the women's March, was on the view yesterday, the day before and couldn't condemn outright. Louis Farrakhan, who calls Jews cockroaches and a zillion other things. And he's also met with, um, what's her name up in California. Um, the other Congress woman, I'm blanking on her name for a second. Um, and all, all of these people, they're in bed with a lot of bad people. Um, and you can see this thing coming in a judges us all in our worst ways and it, and it believes, it believes that the state is the ultimate power. And think of the irony of this.

Speaker 1:          01:31:27       Trump is in charge. These are the pain, the same people who think that Trump is a Russian asset and that, and if you agree that Trump is a Russian asset, and I say this as someone that did not even vote for Trump, but if you believe that Trump is a Russian asset, you actually think were world war three right now. What could be a higher declaration of war than having the, having installed the president of the United States? So if you think it's a good idea that we should impeach the president or something to that effect, or if you think really that Russia installed the president of United States, then understand what the pat, what you believe is the path to world war three. Now, if they did install the president then all right, I guess we're on path to world war three or could this just be a bunch of paranoid lunacy for a bunch of people who were in power, in lost power.

Speaker 1:          01:32:12       And that's why I would say that the best answer to any of this is limited power limit power. And that what that means is that when your guys empower, not that much will change, but guess what? It's pretty damn good in America. Yeah, it is. And then what that also means is when the guy that you don't like is empowered, not that much bad can change. And guess what? It's pretty good in America. So that's the negotiation to live in a free, stable Western society. You can move on the margins. But when, when Cortez gets out there and says, I'm going to tax these people at 70% and says to Joe Lieberman, who this, you're the future. You're the past. It's like you think that basically a bartender thinks that she knows how to run the world. And by the way, if you think that she's the one really tweeting all of this stuff or that there isn't a whole congregation of people that decide what she can tweet, I think you're sorely mistaken.

Speaker 1:          01:33:02       But again, I will 100% be glad to interview her and treat her with the exact same respect I would treat any other guests. We will air it live. I won't even do use questions. I will sit here with nothing and other than myself and talk to her. I would be happy to do that. Okay, let's go back to the patriarchy thing and please, for God's sakes, people please tell me there's no more money there. This is a nightmare. We're in black mirror. We have 1,740 by below 10,666 $7 oh, you mother fuckers. This is fucked up. All right. We're, we're entering a fucked up bays. Okay. That's where we're at. We're getting to a place where this is not good and nobody's happy about this,

Speaker 1:          01:33:43       Huh? Huh, Huh? Uh, it's not good. It's not. What? Why are you doing this? This is the Internet. This is the Internet. We're here. We're on the Internet. We're doing it. I'm trying to cancel this thing. I don't like this company. I don't want them to have any more success. I'm trying to stick a line in the sand and you people think it's hilarious. You people, well, Juliette, you're getting a mug. Thank you very much, and thank you for donating@daverubin.com slash donate instead of Patrion. They're no good. They don't like free speech. They're getting 5% of your money. You people who are doing this now to be funny, we got 24 more minutes and then I'm pressing delete on this freaking thing. Super Chat. 200 bucks. They want me to do a shot day by enjoyably spent hours trying to figure out what is going on within each of your studios. Paintings. I love them. I love hearing that. So, so all of my paintings are not all of them, but most of the paintings. So this one right here, which is a great, it's about three foot by five foot. Uh, this is an original, this is an absolute original. This is done by Caitlin. Janet. You can go to Kaitlyn rose, Janet see a y l I n rows, janet.com. She's an artist who has

Speaker 4:          01:34:57       done some amazing stuff, uh, in my house. Almost everything in my house is from her. This painting, which we commissioned just for, uh, just for the set obviously, um, is, Eh, I wish I could explain it in a proper sense. If you go to her site, I think you, she explains the process there. She knows how much I love coffee. So there's actual coffee grinds in the painting, which is what's giving it some of the texture over there. And I wanted something that felt a little futuristically. So that's why you're getting those stark lines. And then I want it to feel like a little bit less, sort of like the universe and, and sort of messy and, and interesting. So, hey, that's her in it. Aaron, if we can go to the guests shot right now, the regular guest shot, uh, the painting on the other side.

Speaker 4:          01:35:39       If we can go to that one. I'm not sure we can right now. We can't go to that one right now. Oh, we can't write because we moved the camera. That's right. Um, she did the one on the other side that you'd normally see behind the guests head. I'm also on her site. You can see she, we, she did an incredible, it's four foot by five foot, um, hyperspace so the Millennium Falcon going into hyperspace, she did an original forest. She painted it over days in our house, which was a freaking crazy labor of love. She had to make a protractor using a string in a piece of wood. Uh, she's an incredible, incredible arts and you get principal all of these on there. I don't get a penny for him and she's just wonderful artists. I, Kaitlyn rose, jan.com. Okay. Um, you know what you, because you asked about the paintings, he gave 200 bucks. All right, I'm going to do a shot. I hope you're happy and please people stop donating at patrion.com/rubin report. I've got a life to live. I've got to end this thing and this nightmare, this Bandersnatch now, I mean a, I mean it's the, I mean this is what the Internet is. I'm in the choose your own adventure venture of the Internet. All right, here we go. All right. You want the other guy wanted me to do this fast. So here we go. Here's this like we do it in Texas. Is that

Speaker 6:          01:36:48       there's that. There's that. All right. Love you Dave.

Speaker 4:          01:36:56       Super Chat. I love you Daniel. You're getting a shout out, a superchat hook a brother up with the mug. Please come back to Atlanta soon. How'd I do that? That was pretty good. Hook a brother. He's a B. R. O. T. H. J. Hook a brother at the, I'd be like, I did good on that. You got it. A superchat. Yes. Orlando is the best comeback soon. I would love to come back. I love, I love all of those. Uh, the Disney lands and your universal studios and things like that. We got him here to a super jack. Thanks for standing on principle, Dave. Yeah. You know what? I guess what's cool actually right now, despite the fact that people keep giving me money on Patrion, even though I asked you not to, is that I'm standing over something that I believe in. I'm a, I'm having a ton of fun right now. This is kind of fun and I'm a little drunk, but like beyond all of that, it's like, guess what? When you stay, this is what I quoted Douglas before. When you dare get in the pool, you might find out that the water's not that cold. And that I think is the truth. I think what you guys are seeing right now, I've got people all over the world in super chats and kind of unpatriotic you motherfuckers and,

Speaker 1:          01:37:56       and all over the place that are, that are giving me money, having fun, enjoying watching this. And it's just because I stood up for what I believe. And I think you can do it too. Like maybe the truth does set you free. Who somebody must have said that, right? Somebody said that. Um, Dave, serious question. Are there any creators on Patrion that you're disappointed having joined the patriarch purge? Um, no, no. Go the answer to know everyone has their own considerations. I want to be very clear about that. Someone tweeted me about this today and I retweeted with comment. Someone said something to the effect of, Oh, you know, Sam Harris deleted his immediately and you and Jordan, it's been a couple of weeks and you're tweeting about it and blah, blah blah. And it's like I, first off, I think you guys know my feelings about Sam. I have nothing but respect for him.

Speaker 1:          01:38:38       He's a good friend and I have admiration and love for the guy. I don't know exactly what his business considerations are. So he was able to, I don't know what his personal finances are or anything or anything else. I just, I I genuinely don't know for as well as I know him. He deleted his on principle. I have truly nothing but respect for that. I have a different situation here in that I have a company that I'm running that most of the money of the income from the company was coming from our fan funding. Okay. So we have different considerations. Jordan has different considerations as well. You guys have different feelings about all of us about where you want to spend your hard earned money and I do believe it is your hard earned money. Um, so anyone that's on there, whether Brett staying on there right now or Colin staying on their sword and scales on their whole bunch of other people I think are doing, doing good stuff and trying to fight the fight the same way that I'm trying to fight it for all I know.

Speaker 1:          01:39:26       Maybe Jordan and I leaving, maybe the people at Patriot on right now, look, I know a bunch of cowards and error, probably looking around going, oh, I hope nobody notices that. I actually liked Dave and Jordan and I'm not a programmed robot in an NPC, but, but there are people there that are probably happy that the headache of Peterson and Ruben and Harris has gone. Um, but I don't make my decisions based on who might think I'm a headache. So, um, so that's that. And as I said, maybe those guys will be able to change things from the inside. You anything, anything that's a movement that that matters. Um, people do it in different ways. People did the civil rights movement in different ways. Some people wanted to do it one way. Some people want to do another. Any, anything that matters. And I truly believe we're in a battle for free speech.

Speaker 1:          01:40:08       And if some people say you have to stay inside the institutions and fight, some people want to fight from the outside. It's like, it's all good. It's all good. These people are my allies and my friends and, and I mean allies in the best sense of it. Not, I don't mean ally because they bow to me forever. If there is more money on Patrion right now, I'm going to, I'm going to, um, well it's not going to be pretty people. Here we go. I am trying to cancel this thing. I'm going to 10,000, $895, 1,745 patrons please for the love of God. Let those numbers be going down.

Speaker 5:          01:40:40       They're up.

Speaker 1:          01:40:42       They're up again. We went up to people and we went up about 20 bucks. Is that right? I hope you're happy.

Speaker 3:          01:40:55       Uh, okay. Can't afford 50 bucks because I'm saving for a psychology Grad school. After discovering my interest through Jordan. And any chance I could get a leftover mug if there is one, uh, Star Wars episode nine. No hope. All right, let's first of all, let's give this guy a mug. I'll sign it right now. Can we get any know we have to figure out how to get your email. So hopefully that can be tied into your, uh, your super dress. I will gladly give you a mug. No problem. Uh, episode nine. No, no hope. So I'm glad you asked this question because let's talk about something else besides,

Speaker 1:          01:41:21       um, free speech and the rest of it for just a sec. So, so, uh, so David, my husband had a little, a, a minor surgery over the last couple of days, which on top of it, as busy as we've been about a zillion things, I've also had his brother and sister in law here and his mom here and everyone's been taking care of him and I've been trying to do the best that I can do two and, and everything else. He's completely fine. He's going through a little recovery right now. It's all good. Um, but he had a little time to watch TV. We watched the prequels. Now I've been saying for a couple of years now that I think years from now the prequels are going to be looked at very fondly, very differently than their looked at. Now. Is the acting bad? Yes. Is the script stiff? Yes, but is the story of those prequels of what the accumulation of power and then the flipping of power because that's really what it's about.

Speaker 1:          01:42:06       It's an incredible personal story of the development of Vatican Skywalker, but what it's really about is that the emperor Palpatine was accumulating, accumulating, accumulating power through political processes through creating crisises that then at the last moment, I mean this is what revenge of the system SIF is about. He then a Qa has enough power to get rid of the opposition. That's sort of what we're dealing with right now. It's an incredible political story at the, uh, what's his name? Hey, in Christian's a horrible actor. Natalie Portman is a terror is absolutely terrible in this. I'm not a big fan of hers anymore for a couple of political reasons, but I grew up in the same town as her actually, and we went to the same high school. Um, I'm sure she's a lovely woman, but I'm not, not a huge fan of the moment. Um, but anyway, I think people, if you look at the, the prequels and they're missing little moments, like we needed to know who count dookoo was a little bit more, they needed to tell us a little bit more about [inaudible] and why he went to the cloners originally.

Speaker 1:          01:43:00       A couple little things, but if you remove some of that stuff, the stories are actually great. Force awakens I think is a fantastic movie. I think Jj Abrams did an incredible lift of resetting the entire thing and, and last Jedi is just horrendous. It's horrendous at every level. Purple hair. And Laura Dern, why wasn't that Admiral Ackbar at his last moment of glory? Instead you killed him off camera layer. There's no force in space. Who the hell smoke now? Ray has no parents. What's his name? Uh, fn two eight one seven. Finn has no point in the whole movie, his whole adventure that he goes on at the casino with the SJW girl, they have no point in the movie. They fail and then it just, they just end up back there with dementia and then the movie is absolute crap. Luke is a grumpy old fool. Why at that point is he force project himself there instead of showing up to the final battle if he was going to die either right and let the guy freaking die in a blaze of glory. The whole thing was lazy. It was a resume. I think Ryan Johnson basically is resentful of wars.

Speaker 4:          01:43:52       All that being said, uh, I think JJ can fix it for episode nine and I really, I really, really, really, really, really, really, really hope that he does. We shall see. Uh, all right, I can do it. I think I can do two more shots. We got 15 minutes. I think I can do two more shots. So it's going to have to be 200 bucks on a, on any format. So whether it's a patrion no, not patriotic. CanNot be patriotic. No patriotic people are not new. A patriot. Okay. Uh, I can do two more shots, but you have to do in a Dave rubin.com/donate. You can do it on paypal. You do it on credit card. You do it on bitcoin. I don't care at this point. Please do not do it on Patriot. A shout outs to Herschel shout outs to Bannon and a Mug for Jacob.

Speaker 4:          01:44:33       Herschel Bannon. Jacob, we just went to a shtetl in a, in Poland in 1860. All right, there you go brother. I signed that one on the front for you. That's a rare one. Jacob, you're getting one on the front. Uh, exasperated. Reuben is the best. Reuben, I love you man. Okay. Uh, donating 10 bucks towards having Matt Christiansen on the Ruben where we will do that. A bunch of you have asked. We will do that for sure. Um, let's see. Dave, please briefly remind the newly joined viewers how they can support you since you're moving away from patron. I think I've been trying to do that. Dave, room and.com/donate. We are building out several things. We are rebuilding my website, it is going to be completely insulated from censorship on the video hosting front on the platform hosting front on the monetization front. That is just one step of getting away from Patriot on these third party people who don't live up to the ideals that I live up to. I am not asking the government to get involved. Um, and that is one step onto building a platform and then several other steps down the road. I promise you, this is just the beginning of several markers. We're going to do something cool here. Like why not right? Like I'm alive. You're alive. Let's do it. Okay. Uh, 200 bucks. No comment with donation, but time for another shot.

Speaker 4:          01:45:50       You all right? Here we go.

Speaker 6:          01:45:54       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          01:45:57       getting too old for this shit. You know what I mean? Here we go. Patroned for Patriot.

Speaker 6:          01:46:09       Woo.

Speaker 4:          01:46:15       And now wait a little jelly spoons. I'm going to click refresh on the page here. Here we go. Right now we have 1,747 people were getting $10,904 please, if there is a god in the universe, let that number go down. We went up $4. Are you happy for a dollar per person? You know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          01:46:46       Okay.

Speaker 4:          01:46:53       Oh God, another 200 no, that house. All right, hold on. I, I literally can't do another shot right now. Um, I'm a red wine drinker too, and I'd love to do a celebrative shy with you. Keep up all the great work. Cheers to beautiful future. I'll display by bug one shelf higher than my Michael knolls sign leftist tear your mug

Speaker 1:          01:47:12       tumbler. I appreciate that. Very nice. Stick it to that Knowles guy that rightwing maniac that. All right, maniac. Yeah. Talk about you.

Speaker 4:          01:47:20       No holes. Uh, $50 in Canadian dollars. Can I get a mug? I mean, what is 50 Canadian dollars worth in American [inaudible] what are we six, seven bucks? I don't know what I can do for that guy. Um, 20 bucks. Let's get Dave over $11,000 on Patriot and no, no, you're not good. You're not a good person. What's your thought on the Captain Marvel movie?

Speaker 1:          01:47:43       I haven't tracked this thing at all, but I know what's her name's in it. Brie Larson. I think she's a good actress. Um, but is it connected to Avengers? It is. Right then she's going to have some big role in Avengers. Infinity war by the way, was phenomenal. I have been on a lot of planes in the last couple months. I've seen infinity. It's about 20 times. And I,

Speaker 4:          01:48:01       Eh, Eh, there is perfect. It's pretty much perfect as a superhero movie. Um, it's so worth donating to your telephone to watch you load up on Tequila, love you and your spirit on spirits. Way To upstage, poke in a hockey puck in hockey, love from Jamie and Janine, Po poke in a Honky poky and hockey, whatever it is that you wrote there. I feel like it was something that I should have understood and I probably just said it wrong, but I thank you for that. Um, when the Patriot and replacement is up, will it be announced on the subscribed star site or we'll be at via mass social media explosion. And what do you think about the women's March controversy? All right. The women's March thing,

Speaker 1:          01:48:39       I think it's pretty obvious. Look, the intersectional oppression Olympics thing, it's crumbling because they literally are like, wait a minute. How can we treat Jews? Sure. They've been programmed in Holocaust, did and, and, and been in the other, in the, in the law for the longest history of anything. But now they're kind of successful over the last 50 years, especially in America. How should we treat them despite the fact there might be Brown? My brother in law happens to be a brown Jew. Um, how should we treat these people? This is the essence of what collectivism is. It is the new racism, progressives or the new races races. If you want to see something incredible. By the way, look at my Twitter from about, I think three or four tweets ago. Uh, David Webb, who is a conservative who happens to be black, was not doing, I'm doing his, uh, Fox nation show, I think a on Thursday.

Speaker 1:          01:49:29       He was on, uh, he was doing, it was either he show or another show. I'm actually not sure, uh, because I had such a crazy day. I was just catching these little clips he was on with the Rebbe Martin or read Martin. Happens to be a lovely woman who's also a black, she's been on my show years ago. She's a progressive. They get on the show together. They're doing so she doesn't know. She apparently she didn't know who he was or anything about him. He goes on and on about something and then she goes, well, you're showing your white privilege. This literally happened today and David Webb, who is a black conservative, who is a really great guy who I've drank a lot of freaking bourbon with, that he usually pays for it. That's extremely expensive. He goes, well, a river. Do you know that I'm black? And then you gotta listen to the rest of this.

Speaker 1:          01:50:09       It's incredible because progressivism is the new racism. Understand this. If you understand this, you will almost be able, that is almost the key. You need to unlock almost everything that's happening in America, the people that are peddling racism that we'll want to institutionalize racism, who want white people to bow to them and who hate Christianity and all and who hate anything that's remotely traditional or conservative. And I save this as a gauge. You, you know what I mean? I don't say this as one of these people that are trying to push anyone to believe anything. Um, this is what this thing has become and it's, and it's seriously dangerous and crazy. It is six 50

Speaker 4:          01:50:46       the two. I am going to check this thing and I don't like anyone that has gone on to this freaking thing or we're getting into dangerous territory. Where's my mouse? Mouse is a mouse actually technically is this thing of mouse. All right. 1,749 people right now have donated $10,900 a month. That is used to be around 35,000 and a lot of you have quit and I thank you for that. Thank you for stop giving me money. I appreciate it. I'm going to hit refresh on this and I hope that that number has gone down and if it hasn't gone down, you've put me in some sort of foster and bargain. Here we go.

Speaker 6:          01:51:29       I don't think I pressed it properly.

Speaker 4:          01:51:34       Oh my God. It went up again, didn't it? What? We went down, we went down to $18

Speaker 6:          01:51:48       thank you.

Speaker 4:          01:51:51       Thank you, Internet. We went down to $18 I've been talking for two hours and finally after imploring people to stop giving me over $10,000 a month, we lost $9 $18 we lost $80. That's incredible. Shout outs to Andrew and Theresa and to Sam. I appreciate it. Jim. You're getting a Mug, brother. All right, Jim, you're a good man, guys. Would it be completely insane? I'm tempted to do this just because I cannot believe this, but I want to get the thumbs up from my team. I'm looking through the window here. Uh, would it be insane to extend this for a half hour? It would not be insane. I've been given the thumbs up. Yeah, everyone's confirming this. All right, here's the deal. I'm going to continue this for a half hour. I, I genuinely cannot believe this is happening. Please. People, Internet people. Why? But this is true. This is real. You freaks.

Speaker 4:          01:52:53       Uh, Oh God. Another 200 bucks. Drink Canada 50 is $37 and 68 cents in the u s can I get a Canadian mug? Oh No. Can I get a can of Canadian and got a bug? That's very different. Can I get a Canadian mug? That's more, what is it? Canadian mug. How is that different than an American Mug? Can the Canadian get a Mug? No, you got to do it monthly. You can't do it on super chat. You're taking advantage of the situation person, Canadian person, uh, $50. Should we be supporting Dave mugging people? Good question. Uh, what percentage of your listeners do you speculate or women? So it's actually interesting. So I don't know the total answer to this because when you do audio podcasts, which actually our audio podcast is actually, I think almost more popular than the youtube show at this point. Um, which is bizarre because no one sees those numbers.

Speaker 4:          01:53:46       So it's a weird thing cause you sort of judged the popularity, uh, in terms of, uh, in terms of the youtube numbers. Um, last I saw our, our, so politics in general, if you talking about anything political excuse mail, now I know that the social justice warriors, we'd love it to have to be 50, 50 men and women should care about the exact same things at the exact same time no matter what. Let's put that aside for just a second. Um, generally politics skews heavily now. I mean, it's crazy. It's something like 90 10. Our channel is mostly politics, obviously are mostly culture, cultural related to politics, let's say. Um, I think we're at about 75, 25, so I think it's about 75% male, 25% female, which is pretty evenly distributed relative to the topics we're talking about. So it's a little hard to say.

Speaker 4:          01:54:35       Uh, someone just donated 50 bucks on super chat. Neither Reuben Mug to sit next to my left is tear monks. But you got to go to Dave rubin.com/donate. We're not doing that for super shy. You got to do it. You got to do it monthly. It's just one of the things we had to do. I appreciate it. Thank you. All right. You know what, we'll do it for that guy, but I cannot, we can't do it for anyone else. So if we can get that guy's email address, if we can possibly get it. Um, $42,000 for 42,000 coast guard members still required to work, did not get a paycheck for the first time in us history that the military were not paid. Where your, your opinion. All right, this will be a lot to get into at this at this moment. Um, what I would say is this, is that first off it sounds like, and I think this is a bipartisan thing, which is bizarre these days.

Speaker 4:          01:55:18       It sounds like everyone that's furloughed right now, we're not getting paid right now. That works for the government. We'll get back pay. So that's one thing. Now of course, that doesn't deal with your immediate bills. Now, if you work for the government, shouldn't you be living in a situation where your week to week? Probably not and maybe, maybe you have to figure out a few things for your own life. But we, we've all done that. When I was a struggling comic, I swear on my life, I remember a day when I, I, first of all, I was late on rent and I was barely making anything. And I had, I had quit several jobs and I had done for attending and I had done promotions and I had handed out shit on the streets and I've done all sorts of things. And I remember, and this is, I was already in my mid twenties or something, like I was way past this point and I moved in.

Speaker 4:          01:55:59       I didn't, I couldn't even afford an apartment anymore. And I moved in, uh, three guys who were great guys, I'll give him a shadow is Mike and Chris and Adam, they didn't even have an extra room in their apartment. They had a basically a whole way with a cot and they let me stay there for like, I think it was like 50 bucks a month to live in New York City and I remember one day I had no cash. Like I literally had no cash and I did not know what to do and I was struggling comic and the whole thing and blah blah blah. I'm not even saying this, cry me a river. I went into Mike's room. Mike is still a good buddy of mine. Mike, if you're watching this and there's a good chance you are and I love you brother, I guess is a good time to tell Ya.

Speaker 4:          01:56:40       I took 75 cents from your change jar. Chock full of nuts change here. You had an old chocolate nuts like metal coffee can dare. I took 75 cents and maybe I took 95 cents and I went to Zabar's. We lived on the upper west side. I went to Zabar's, which everyone that's been to New York City knows about gay bars and then I got a cup of coffee and I stole change for you. I felt so freaking guilty for doing that. Um, so the struggle is real, I guess is the point of that. What was the point of that? I don't really remember. Okay. Different marching, uh, seeing you in the UK during June. Jordan Peters has talk. Hope to see you again here soon. Good luck outside. Patrion right on brother. Um, longtime fan. Just want to say you're awesome. Pledging to you and Jordan on payday. Ever need to design writing worker or a VA work.

Speaker 4:          01:57:28       Uh, I'm your Gal. Much love why I appreciate it and walked back out. Yeah. Yeah. We've had so many people offer to work for us for free and offer to donate skills and this or that. We're trying. I have a, what I do is every time I get an email where someone else is offering us something or some skillset or something, I forwarded to Helen who's my assistant, who is an incredible actually and has been a godsend in this operation who we hired back in September. Who, by the way, I think I'm allowed to say this. Uh, she over the last eight or 10 years of his life was Hugh Hefner's assistance. So that's actually pretty cool. My assistant right now is you have nursing assistant. So if I start wandering around in robes with a lot of hot chicks around me, you'll know why, uh, in any event, uh, I forward everything over to her and she's compiling a list of all of these things. So we'll try to figure out a lot of this, uh, what to do going forward. All right, we got, we got a half hour left, so with, and I'm not extending it after that. This is ridiculous and I hate all of you. Uh, I'm going to press refresh here and I just want to say please, for the love of God, we want to end this thing tonight. 1,749 of you for some reason have refused to cancel your patriotic gowns. $10,000, 800, 10,000, $890 or sitting in there. Here we go.

Speaker 4:          01:58:49       Yeah, we lost, we lost about a thousand bucks. Goodnight everybody. Thank you. Thank you for deleting $1,000 of patronage. I couldn't be happier. Thank you so much. You are great people. You are great. Great people. Uh, I was so close to signing up for your Patriot on recently, but lol. Not Anymore. It goes Solo. You have immense support. Thank you very much. Um, let's see. Um, why didn't I get my $25 shadow for my Dave Rubin monthly pudge? If I go to Patrion a shout out to die standing. You got a shout out right there. How much is a shot? How much is a double shot? You gave five bucks to ask that. I'll do the next shot at 200. I can't, I can't, I mean, what am I done now? Three so far I haven't eaten all day. I had, I had a little salad and two cups of bone broth. A Dave, thanks for the amazing shout out sense. Spend some time in po, spent some time in Poland. It was amazing. I think Poland is actually going to be on the next, uh, the next tour stops, so hang tight on that. All right, lots going on here. Um, guys, I see a 200 sitting in here for drink. Is that a new one?

Speaker 6:          02:00:00       Ah,

Speaker 4:          02:00:07       can I answer another question first? Is there another? All right here. Let me have a little water. A little water.

Speaker 1:          02:00:15       How many of you watch Bandersnatch by the way, if you guys, did you guys watch a Netflix Black Mirror? Bandersnatch statuary. It's a choose your own adventure TV show. I actually do feel like we're kind of in that,

Speaker 4:          02:00:24       which is, which is pretty freaking cool. Uh, Kevin Johnson, were you a point guard on the Phoenix Suns in the early 1990s? Cause that's pretty awesome. If you were also former mayor of Sacramento, take a sip of water. Dave, you're crazy high. If you could please sign my mug before they run out, went to the website. It's properly swamped. Best of luck with this. It's just the site down is a site down right now. [inaudible] dot com slash donate I hope not. Uh, 20 bucks. You're not drunk. If you can say brewery, tour,

Speaker 1:          02:00:54       brewery tour. You know, it's a tough one to say. I want you to say this out loud. If you're watching this Irish wristwatch, can you say that? Play along with me people. Irish wristwatch. That's a tough one to say. And if you could say that, then you're really not drunk. All right, so apparently there's 200 bucks in here saying drink. I need just a second. What are we doing here? People? I'm just raising funds. We're, we're not going to do these fundraisers. We will. I promise you. At least we will. I, I said in the last thing, we're not going to do them all year, but I think we should probably do maybe, maybe twice a year. So I promise you we won't do one to let's say June or July or summer or something like that. Maybe the last thing I do before I go off the grid, uh, but we're just moving people over from Patriot over today. ruben.com/donate and you guys are bored. We're, we're, we're going to be, we're going to move forward.

Speaker 4:          02:01:40       We're going to keep building. Things were all good, but we're completely independent. Thanks to you guys. I don't have to join the network. I don't have to do any of these other crazy things. And I thank you for that. And it's awesome. It's real. This is seriously freaking real. What can I tell ya? Um, I'm monthly on paypal, but this stream is lit as fuck a f that's how the kid say as fuck these days. By the way. A good to know. Uh, um, I know you're somewhat at least at least somewhat interested in comics. Are you familiar with the sun? So Neetu series, remember to stay hydrated. I don't know this the need two people. How's my gulp sound on that? Every now and again, I have a drink on the show and people say, Dave, you're allowed goalkeeper. So I'm gonna just drink casually. Let's just pretend. I'll just pretend nobody's watching and I'm going to drink casually.

Speaker 4:          02:02:34       How was that? Let me know in the comments right down below. Okay, here we go. I'm Dave, you've upstaged, Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren. She drank a beer in her video. I think that was what the earlier comment are meant to say. Yeah, I mean, but that's like, that's how stupid this thing is. These people are trying to pretend to be human. I drink a beer with my husband, so I'm a real person. Look, oh my home, and just happens to be here with my laptop in the kitchen and he didn't know I was going to live stream to millions of people. It's like they're, they're all just bullshit artists than buffoons and stop paying attention to them. But at the other level, you have to be independent because it's your life. So it's a little bit tough because these people have on real ugly power on your life, which is a problem late.

Speaker 4:          02:03:15       A little jellies, spoons. We have 25 minutes left. Go to Dave Rubin dot compensation on it. I got to get rid of some of these freaking shirts. I can't deal with the shirts anymore. I have too many of them. They're causing problems. Okay? They're courting marital problems. I need closet space people, Dave rubin.com/donate 25 bucks a month that you're getting a shirt, 50 bucks monthly. You're getting the shirt, you're getting a mug. I'm going to sign it for you right now and then we're deleting. Patrion I'm not extending this thing after that. I promise you we're done. I know there's 200 bucks sitting there and super chat about the, about the shot. All right, the next hundred. If we got a hundred after this, I'll do the freaking shot. I hope you're happy. Let's go to the video tape.

Speaker 6:          02:03:53       Yeah.

Speaker 4:          02:03:54       Right now we have 1,745 I would say heathens, ungodly heathens who have decided that they do not want to stop paying us here even though I don't want them to. And I've sent several emails and I've done live streams and tweeted about it and the money keeps going up. I think we went down to $9 last time. That was nice. And here we go. Jesus. Fuck we did. We just go up $1,500 we just went up $900

Speaker 6:          02:04:37       I can't

Speaker 5:          02:04:38       quit. You know

Speaker 4:          02:04:43       Dave, Chris here, just wanting to let you know that sword and scale is donated about 500 on this stream and you're awesome. And if you need a product manager for me to platform, Helen has my CV. Holla. Alright. So, so Helen does have these things. I'm not making it up. We do categorize all of these things. A sword and scale. I did not know, uh, about the podcast before this, but I do know about it now. He's been a huge supporter in, uh, in, in getting the word out about Patrion. I think he's the fifth highest creator on Patrion. He's planning on leaving quite patriotic. Um, I don't, I don't know him personally. I don't know. We've traded a couple of messages. Um, I don't know what he's financial considerations are, but people are trying to do what they can and it is pretty freaking awesome.

Speaker 4:          02:05:26       I, I appreciate the support brother and let's, let's just keep trying to do what we can. Uh, I kept my patriot accounts simply because I wanted to see what happens on the patrion end when the accountant we patronize is deleted or not. That's fair. Thank you for not giving me more money. I think that's what you're saying. But that's where you, if you haven't deleted because you want to just see what happens. The moment I delete via the insider thing that is happening on Patrion. I do appreciate that. All right. I'm giving shout outs. Five bucks above on Dave ruby.com/donate shirts 25 bucks above monthly and uh, and uh, mugs on that. I will do another shot at 100 bucks on super chat because you people are seriously twisted. We just went up $900 on patriot. I, I, I don't know what to tell ya there then.

Speaker 4:          02:06:10       I can't, you know, you've got to stop giving us money there and this is not right or this is injust I'm impressed. I'm impressed. I keep asking people to not do something and they keep doing it. This is, this is depression is the oppression of the sith. It is back. Uh, all right, I will be in Irvine, California January 30th with a member of the ITW at the Irvine Improv. You can check Dave Ruby dot calculation beds to check out that in case you can't tell. I used to be on the radio. So I've done a little bit of a, a little of this, a little of that over the years. Uh, all right, who's jumping in on superchat hundred bucks? I'm going to do another shot at this point. It's like, let's just do it. You know what I mean? Like let's just go down with the ship. I'm going to end up with $4 billion on Patrion. I'll be drunk as hell. I mean, let's just roll with it. Um, okay. Um, a lot of things here. Shout out to John, Mike and Chrissie. Thank you guys. I appreciate it. All right, we got, it's seven Oh eight. We got 22 minutes left. I'm going to, I'm going to click that thing and if it's higher,

Speaker 5:          02:07:16       hmm.

Speaker 4:          02:07:17       I'm going to have to really evaluate things. Aaron, 1,743 people have donated $10,853. This is wrong.

Speaker 5:          02:07:33       This is not good.

Speaker 4:          02:07:38       We've got a $14 people. I get it. I get it. It's all a joke.

Speaker 4:          02:07:50       Do all the joke to you people as I sit here trying to delete this thing and you give me your hard earned dollars just to stick it to the man or something like that. Um, I mean this is actually hilarious. This is actually hilarious. Like I give anyone that's given any money on, they're like, we'll, we'll clear out the account before we delete, but like legitimately hilarious. Like I, this is not what I would've expected. Okay, here we go. FYI, Jordan Peterson has deleted his patrion page, but Bam, 22 minutes left people now. 20 minutes left. I have, I can confirm we are the people in the booth. Jordan B. Peterson of Canada has deleted his patrion page. All right. It's over. It's gone. It's done. He's in Switzerland right now. He deleted it from Switzerland. Okay. Try to grasp the gravity of the situation. Shout out to Rory. Thank you right now. Super Chat. You missed my shout out for joining your side. Punishment is another shot. You sick? Twisted bastard. All right, here we go.

Speaker 6:          02:08:58       Lord,

Speaker 4:          02:09:00       may the Lord have mercy. I know all of us. You don't know what's wrong with you people

Speaker 6:          02:09:14       who, Huh? All right.

Speaker 4:          02:09:26       It's good to be here. We're on Patrion. I'd like to announce today that we're rebooting our patrion on page and we want to take as many donations there as possible. I feel like that's the future of the Rubin report. Joining third party sites that don't care about free speech and seeing what happens. Let's take a role in it. Ice, um, thoughts on your comedian Buddy Owen, Benjamin and him shitting on everyone. Is He for real or he is just part of the new comedy routine? I honestly have no idea what's going on with him. I truly can't answer that in any, in any sensible way. Uh, we got 19 minutes left. I can confirm that from Switzerland. Jordan Peterson has deleted his patriotic count. I've taken I think five shots of patrolling. I'm 42 years old people, no 42 year olds should be drinking five shots in neutron. Um,

Speaker 6:          02:10:17       okay.

Speaker 4:          02:10:18       I did three shows today before this and the Internet has screwed me by continually donating to the Patriot account that I will be deleting in moment. And a, I guess it's just the sign of the Times. This is, this is what it's all about. We who

Speaker 1:          02:10:34       live in the Internet on this tube, this youtube, we're but

Speaker 6:          02:10:40       yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:10:41       Humble servants to you people. But, but really this is like a choose your own adventure. You're watching this right now or controlling my destiny. It's, it's extremely bizarre. I'll try just realize what's very bizarre. It's only seven 12 in the evening here. I A, I haven't had dinner but re but be in 18 minutes when I end this thing after I clicked delete, I'm going to be drunk. I have several employees and family members here. None of them are going to be drunk cause anyone drunk in there? Not yet. Not yet. All right. They're not drunk people. Very bizarre. Uh, okay. Subscribe for 25 but change it to 50 I didn't get another email. Will I still be able to get a mug? Keep up the good work. Yeah, we'll make sure we'll see to your name twice in there. Helen, can you make sure we take care of that for sure. We will deal with that. All right. Ask me anything. People ask me anything. We are deleting patriot. All right, let's go. Here we go. Let's do it right now. We have 1,744 patrons despite at least five emails despite three livestreams, despite at least 20 tweets, Instagram posts, everything. Please stop giving me money. Delete your page, your on account. I don't want anything to do with you people. Despite all of that. Uh, we still have 1700 people left and we have $10,957. Here we go.

Speaker 1:          02:12:04       What do we, I think, ah, we went up.

Speaker 6:          02:12:09       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          02:12:10       we went down almost $900. That's what I'm talking about. People purge the money. Let's get it out of Patrion. They don't want our money. They've got silicon valley money. They've got VC money. They don't need our buddy. I love the fact that people at at paid two and are watching this right now. Like that's actually pretty hilarious. Um, that, that's the other thing about the internet. The Internet is so stupid these days that you have silicon valley people who these people, all these social justice warriors or or more so you have, most of them are libertarians. Actually, I mean the secret of Silicon Valley is that most of these people are Libertarians because they believe that they have ideas to create and that that would give you a very liberty minded view of the world. They've become hostages to the SJW thing. And because of that, then there are around a bunch of people who they actually don't like.

Speaker 1:          02:12:56       And I'm talking to all of these silicon valley people that I know are watching this right now. They become hostages to all of these people. And then they're all, they're all just a bunch of sort of cowards, right? Know, with all the soil and everything else. They're there. They can't really stand up for themselves. So what happens is it just becomes a self fulfilling prophecy that no one will stand up for what they believe in. So I have no doubt that there are plenty of people at Patrion that completely support what I'm doing here and, and whatever. But it's like the fact, think about it. Think about this. So I joined Patriot in, in uh, Julie. It was either June or May, I think it was June of 2016 we've been on there for two a half plus years. We were basically making about 30 grand a month there that the funded this whole basically funded this entire company.

Speaker 1:          02:13:37       Um, so you'd have to do the math on that two and a half years of 30 grand a month. Can someone do the math on that 300, 600? I mean, that's almost a million bucks over the course of three years to find a Kokanee. Now that sounds like a lot of money, but when you're running a company and paying a lot of people, it's not a ton of money, but think about like I've, I've been, I've put a lot of money into this company. Sam Harris put a lot of money into this company, Jordan Peters and put a lot of money, this company, the fact that, that nobody reached out to us, you'd think that some low level nobody would. You would reach out and say, guys, we're, we're having this little issue here, but that's what, that's what's become a problem with these companies now, interestingly, I know that the lefties will say, ah, because you don't want regulation of these companies and you think they can do whatever they want to do. Yes, I do think they can do whatever they want to do. They can do whatever they want to do and I can do whatever I want to do. Freedom is messy, but freedom is good.

Speaker 3:          02:14:26       Shout out to Ethan. Thank you very much. $69 curious number. I think you're onto something with this whole. Pay me and I'll take a shot. Fundraising. I like try it and see if it works when you're not famous. Lol.

Speaker 1:          02:14:38       My famous, I guess I'm famous. It's weird that that's also a weird thing because I'd had an od level of fame where like clearly I guess I'm famous at some level, but like I go to whole foods or I go like anywhere, like I go to like the bowling alley or like wherever it is that I go or I go to like Petco or like people recognize you are often, I'll see people looking at me and I'm like, ah, they'd like me. I don't know if they or do they think I'm a white supremacist. So most of my day is wandering around strange stores picking up food for my dog going, ah, do they think I'm a white supremacist? Which should think how stupid this thing all the whole thing is become. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          02:15:15       Um, next time you take a shot, I'll make a PSAT, make us sound like Anderson Cooper and I'll donate $100. All right.

Speaker 1:          02:15:21       That's funny. That's funny. That might be the funniest thing that's happened this whole time. So if nobody watched CNN on New Year's Eve, like what kind of life do you have that you'd watch CNN on New Year's Eve? Um, but, but you might've watched a clip of it on Twitter and I saw a five second clip where him and Andy Cohen, uh, and as a Kubernetes going, they're taking shots. And it's like, that's the one night of the year that the CNN people act get to act like humans, but they can't really act like humans because they've spent a year not acting like a human. So how can they act like a human on one night? That's a tough gig. Uh, but so Anderson take a shot. He's like, oh my God, it's so, all right. You know what? Here's what we'll do. 500 bucks. I will do an Anderson Cooper impression while taking a shot. It's gotta be 509. I'm sorry, the money's going up on Pedro. And despite the fact that I wanted to go down, so here the rubber meets the road people. I will do an impression of Anderson Cooper.

Speaker 3:          02:16:15       Hey David, keep up the good work. I came to America to be around people like you. Instead I found free speech police, hopefully people like you help turn things around.

Speaker 1:          02:16:23       I'd love to know where you're from. Uh, can you do something that we can figure out where this person is from? I love story. That's the other

Speaker 4:          02:16:30       thing. When I go into Uber's and cabs and all these places that I go to, whether it's in the states or not, it was like everyone that I've met, it's like everyone loves to be in the West. They love to be in Canada. They loved to be in the UK. They love to be in America. It ain't that bad. How much for a six shot daily, you donate $5 and 69 cents. Another interesting number. Um, I remember the time before you had a patriot right after the ad. Pocalypse it won't be that bad. We're going to be all right here, right Jesse, you're getting a Mug, brother or sister Jessie could be a guy, could be a girl, but who am I to assign a gender to Jesse? You know what I mean?

Speaker 2:          02:17:09       Huh.

Speaker 4:          02:17:11       Uh, and, and again, Jesse, whatever gender you are, I just want you to know, I think you're great gender. You know, like you're really a great guy or Gal, you know Jesse, great gal, great guy or Gal. Okay, here we go. We've got 13 minutes left. By the way. My phone is exploding right now. I don't want to show all the, the names of the people. Um, but my phone is exploding, which either means that I've ruined my career tonight or we got some good shit going on. I suspect it's the latter, but you never know. Here we go. We're going to hit refresh. We have 1,444 people. We've got 11 minutes remaining. Clis if there is a lord in the university, if any of this means anything, let the number 10,079 go down. We went up $900.

Speaker 2:          02:18:17       Huh?

Speaker 4:          02:18:28       All right. You know what I love? There is a set of a anonymous Twitter accounts that are run by a journalist. There's about, there's about 10 influential lefty, um, anonymous accounts on Twitter that are run by journalists and they think they're really clever and I know they're watching this waiting for me to say anything off script or whatever. Even though there's no script here, they're waiting for me to just say anything. That's anything. And what they do is they're anonymous Twitter. There are journalists are friends of journalists, and what they do is they wait to clip one thing and then they magically get Huffpo or buzzfeed or vox, which is the worst or any of these things to quote what I say and say Ruben was drunk and morale. I said this. And it's like, I know they're just sitting there watching this and they couldn't get, they couldn't get anyone to give them a buck. And I'm literally asking people's, you know, giving me money right now.

Speaker 2:          02:19:20       Ah,

Speaker 4:          02:19:22       Oh, here we go. I can afford a couple of months at 50 right now, I hope gets me a cool sign

Speaker 3:          02:19:28       mug. Jesse is with Jesse without the eye is male. Now stop flirting with me. Oh, Jessie, welcome back. All right, so Jessie's going to get

Speaker 1:          02:19:37       the mug. Um, and you're right. So it was j e s, s, e, which I assumed was a male. But these days with the way gender is so fluid and the way just because you have a penis, you might be uh, you know, you can be a woman, you can be a decepticon, whatever it is, sith Lord doesn't matter. The point is, uh, you know, we're just doing the best we can. Okay.

Speaker 3:          02:19:57       Ladles and jellies boots. We have s

Speaker 1:          02:19:59       we have nine minutes left. We went up 900 bucks.

Speaker 2:          02:20:04       Huh?

Speaker 1:          02:20:06       The best part of this is, so we really had, the last couple days here really have been insane. So David had surgery as I mentioned before. So David's not even part of this. David's the executive producer of the show who has run, if anything, I do look remotely professional or anything. Maybe, maybe not today, but generally speaking, David has done this. This is, this is him. He is, he, he learned this from scratch and has become, I would say the best executive producer probably in the business. And he, he could not work these last couple of days because he had, it was, it was a minor sinus related surgery but like he was knocked out on pain meds and all sorts of stuff the last couple of days. So we've, our, our, my whole team is completely stepped up. We, we brought in some other people in my brother and sister alive helped in a whole bunch of people and uh, the fact that we, here we are this morning, I said to David, I was like, I hope that by the end of this like I don't know how to get to these Patriot on people.

Speaker 1:          02:20:59       I got it. It's actually incredible and it's a little sign of the times you're saying that a certain amount of people just donate to things and forget about it. And I mean that, I don't mean that judging them in a negative way. I mean that is like, it's actually kind of cool if like someone's got a couple of bucks and it's like you fall, you get to something you believe in and you just forget about it. It's like, what are, what a luxury that is. What a great thing that is. Um, but I was like at the end of this, like it would be so cool if the entire livestream two hours we could watch this number, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop, drop. And we have not had that happen. All right. 150

Speaker 3:          02:21:31       the bugs. I think what you're doing is great and I fully support your willingness to take a stand and have the conversation

Speaker 1:          02:21:36       nobody else will have. Thank you. You know what, you didn't even ask me to take a shot, but I'm feeling the flow. It's seven 23

Speaker 1:          02:21:46       this is patrolling ladles and jellies, moons, ladles and jellies. Moons. I want to give a shout out. I hope my buddy. So when I did stand up in New York for 12 years and I hope you guys will come out and see me do stand up in the future, um, because people don't know that part of me, uh, until they see it. And then people are like, Holy Shit, you're actually good at this. But, which is actually more of a fun thing cause people don't even pay to come to the show and they don't even know what to expect. But there were two comics who I knew that were great that I'm going to give a public shout out to now that I don't even know that you can find anything about them online. The two best comics that I ever knew in 12 years, a standup in New York were Bob Jergens and Mike Singer. And I don't know that you can find anything about them. Bobbed an actor now. So I hope you can at least find out about him. I don't know what happened to Mike. Um, but

Speaker 4:          02:22:26       Bob used to always get on stage and if he was really struggling and he'd ham it up and go come out ladles and jellies spoons. And I just thought it was the funniest thing. So here we go. Yeah. Uh, Bob and the old timers,

Speaker 6:          02:22:42       why,

Speaker 4:          02:22:44       why or not?

Speaker 4:          02:22:50       I look forward to the Huffington post piece on this. Uh, will you drink the whole bottle if the number goes down to zero? I mean that would genuinely be the end of my life. Which you sort of had this all should end, right? Like it should all end on a live stream. Yeah. Alright. I, here's what I do. It's, it's seven 24 I'm going to do one check right now and then at exactly seven 30 we're deleting this motherfucker regardless of what you sons of bitches have done. Here we go. It's seven 25 I am clicking refresh were taken. It's taken some time.

Speaker 4:          02:23:36       There was no change. It did not change. Thank you. That's all I ask. It doesn't have to go down, although I'd like it to go down, but if we refer not to go. All right, so that's where we're at. That's the official number. Aaron, can you throw back to that thing, Arthur, this is the final official number. I have 1,744 patrons. Better donating $10,987 a month. I am. I am. We'll come back here for a sec. I am 100% joking aside and completely acknowledging that the humor and the trollish nature of the people who have donated and last hour, I am completely appreciative of all the people that have done this and it's sort of hilarious and many of them maybe will see this video in a week or something. People have lives too. Um, so I'm completely appreciative of anyone that's been part of this thing and a shout out to Patrick and to Mike Right now.

Speaker 4:          02:24:26       I'm so appreciative of all that. We're going to donate this thing in five minutes. And so let me get serious for just a moment and then a, and then we're going to lead this thing or here. You know what? I'll do these two quick questions. Come on please give Anderson Cooper, c'mon, please give. And the Anderson Cooper and pressure. And I was supposed to use the hundred dollars to surprise to subscribe to Ben Shapiro, but here I am. And that's your bureau by the way. It's his birthday today. And because he would not bake me a gay cake, I did not send him a cake. I wanted to send them a cupcake, but you know, if you're not going to bake me a cake for my gay wedding, I'm not going to send you a birthday cake so you get nothing. Shapiro. I left patron as a support, the first amendment and they silence quite a few people. How do I attain a Mug? You can get a mug if you go to Dave ruben.com/donate and you donate $50 a month and you can cancel whenever you want, but if you donate $50 a month to start, we'll send you a mug. I shouldn't have said that because you know, we want you to obviously keep donating, but it is what it is. Ladies and gentlemen, we have three minutes left. Love drunk. Dave can't believe you didn't get sick on camera. You're a trooper

Speaker 4:          02:25:32       old school. You know what I'm saying? Old School. All right, we got two minutes left. I just want to say really this has been a pleasure. There's a huge part of me that wants to keep this going right now. Um, but I know I probably should not. And I know that, that my, my dedicated staff has lives. Some of them might want to get laid tonight or do whatever they do in their own lives. So for me to sit here and continue this insanity would be, would be selfish and I don't want to do that. So I've got about two minutes left more than anything else. I genuinely want to thank you guys. Anyone that forget anyone that's donated, knew for a second for any of you that have donated over the last two and a half years. The day that we started the patriotic thing and I, and I quit my job at, or a TV and my executive producer and my director quit with me on a lark.

Speaker 4:          02:26:23       It truly was a lark. We did not know what was going to happen. And I said to them the night before, I said, I, if I may have screwed up all of our lives, like I had worked so hard to get something and I quitted network so that we could do something. Um, we didn't know what was going to happen in the next morning within it, within a half hour. We knew we were going to be okay and we've been okay ever since then. And there has been ups, there have been downs, the twists and turns that come along the way. Um, but I've really, I truly, I have genuinely tried to do the best thing that I could along the road. I've made mistakes. I'm not perfect. I am open to the same criticism that Edinburgh, everyone else is open to. Um, but I promised you guys, this is just the beginning. It's just the beginning again, which is weird that there's something about life in that at the beginning can keep happening if you keep doing something real. I, I dunno what that is, but I actually think it is something and I'll keep trying to do it the best I can. Um, so I thank you guys for that. Um, well let's see. I will ask, I will answer one more question and then it's seven 29 and we're going to delete this bitch ass motherfucker tag team wrestling match, Huh?

Speaker 2:          02:27:34       Uh Huh. Uh Huh.

Speaker 4:          02:27:37       Tag team wrestling match. Ben Shapiro and Jordan Peterson, verse Dave Rubin and Eric Weinstein who would win.

Speaker 2:          02:27:46       Okay.

Speaker 4:          02:27:48       I run, I think this one through. And I love the fact that this is the last thing then I'm going to do before I cancel this thing and a shout out to Michael Real quick. Shapiro and Peters and now Dan Shapiro. [inaudible] Shapiro, small by Shapiro. Fast.

Speaker 2:          02:28:05       He'll get you. Okay,

Speaker 4:          02:28:07       now Peterson's got that long reach and he's got quick hands. So you've got quick hands and you got somebody quick. So this is the last speed. Dave Rubin and Eric Lyons name. I'll do Ruben last. That guy's good Weinstein. Now he can think it through. He can think of through and he's got big hair so he could use his hair as a weapon. So now you're looking at our hair weapons situation. I could also envision a situation where Eric's just gonna plow through a Weinstein. You know what I mean? Like they're going to get face to face and Shapiro was going to be moving fast, but Eric's just gonna plow through. Now. You got Ruben?

Speaker 7:          02:28:48       Yeah,

Speaker 4:          02:28:48       I, I, you know, he's the most fit of the group. Ladies and gentleman, I'm going to delete Patriot right now. I'm going to leave that decision of that question, which is an extremely important question, which is about the battle of ideas and the regressive left and all of it. I'm going to leave that, I'm going to set that down and I'm going to delete. Patria my phone is exploding. My phone is on fire. I can't show you all of this. My phone is actually melting through the table right now. I have a time bomb sitting with me. It's time to delete. Patrion um, in case it's not clear. Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Whether you, whether you donate it on Patrion I in the past or that you donate now and even if you didn't donate, if you, I don't care.

Speaker 4:          02:29:50       Truly we're going to be okay. And if you were any part of this part of the silliness that we've done for the last two and a half hours, um, this is as good as it gets. This really is as good as you get as far as anything I know on this universe is as good as it gets. So I'm going to hit refresh on this thing one more time and then you're going to watch me delete this. So here we go. So right now after two and a half hours, we have more money than we started with and I think more patrons. No, no, no. Maybe we lost patrons, but we have more money. But here we go. I'm refreshing.

Speaker 4:          02:30:26       Okay, so we did actually go down to our and throw to me one more time. Okay. So we did actually go down. So thank you. I don't know what happened here and I don't know why. I guess all of these people like it just is what it is. It is what it is. It's all good guys. Thank you. Really, really, I wish I could say this in a way that could possibly be more genuinely felt that I'm possibly saying it right now with genuinely, genuinely, genuinely thank you. That is all I can say. And uh, this is just the beginning. So now I'm going to click delete.

Speaker 4:          02:31:00       Uh, so I think there's a delete here somewhere. So I'm going to click settings. We're doing it live. Fuck it. We're doing alive. I'm clicking account. Nope. Now I may have to move here for it just to say it physically because I got to scroll. I know there's a way to scroll without doing it the way I do it. Old School. But I do it. Old School disabled my account. Here we go guys. This is it. Careful. This will permanently disable your account. You won't be able to log in again and after you do this, oh wait a minute. Wait a minute. Actually I should do one thing just to be clear in case that's actually true. I don't want them stealing the money that you guys donated, even though I didn't want you to donate money. So let's do it. Let's just knock that out real quick. Um, payout preferences. So in the course of the last two and a half hours where I've tried to lose money on this thing, you guys donated $1,452 and 89 cents. So thank you. You freaks. So we're going to send that, oops. Don't look at that, Huh? That's my old Gmail. Don't want to see that. Okay. All right, so I have nothing in my patriotic right now. And now I'm going to click settings.

Speaker 4:          02:32:27       Please don't email me. I have, you know, other things going on. Um, okay, so setting FedEx. All right. All right. Settle down. Oop, I, quick messages. No, we don't want to see that. Okay. Ignore that. Sorry.

Speaker 6:          02:39:02       Uh,

Speaker 1:          02:39:03       I promise you I will delete this fucking thing whenever I can. This is, this is actually a perfect ending to this whole story, right? Like this is the way these companies operate. If I emailed this, these people tomorrow, they would not respond to me. I'd have to publicly shame them on Twitter like I do with youtube all the time. I wouldn't be able to get in touch with the person, all of these stupid things. Um, all right, let's not worry about it. I think you guys got the point. I mean, what are ridiculously anticlimactic yet totally fitting ending to all of this. Um, I would try one more time, but I think you guys, we illustrated the point here, so is what it is. Um, so on that moat, uh, on that note, um, I genuinely have nothing but thanks for you guys. That's it. I got nothing but thanks. Thank you guys. Thank you for my team that, that helped me make this whole thing happen today. And, and since we started this whole operation, uh, I thank everybody that was part of this craziness today, whether it was on super chat or Patrion or wherever it was. Um,

Speaker 1:          02:40:14       yeah, I got, I got a bottle of Patrona and a patriotic count I can't get rid of and there in lies and incredible story, uh, which will probably make it into my book that I'm writing right now. So, uh, you guys saw it happen live so, so genuinely thank you and

Speaker 5:          02:40:31       Yah,

Speaker 1:          02:40:33       wait a minute. We will wait. Jordan deleted his account so Jordan was able to lead an account and I can delete my account. Yeah. Alright. Alright, I'm deleting this account. Please never come back to the patrion.com/rubin report page. Um, fight for what you believe in, even if it's not the things that I believe in, but fight for them honestly and forthrightly. Fourth, rightly and uh, and decently, and understand that you're supposed to live in a country with people that disagree with you. We'll keep having these conversations. This really is just the beginning. Jordan and I are going to build something great. There's all sorts of steps in the, along the road to make this happen. I think you got the point already and, and thank you. And uh, I have to pee

Speaker 5:          02:41:25       good night.
