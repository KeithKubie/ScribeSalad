00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.550
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress, in Washingotn, D.C.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.880
&gt;&gt; Many of you probably already
know and love author, illustrator,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.310
Mike Curato, for his beautifully
illustrated Little Elliot books,

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.220
about the adventures of
a polka-dotted elephant.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.420
All the Way to Havana,
Mike Curato's newest book,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.210
with author Margarita Engle,
follows a young Cuban boy

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.800
on a road trip with his family.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.860
All the Way to Havana just
came out this past week.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:36.020
After his talk, you could say hi to
Mike, and have him sign your book

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.230
from 12:30 to 1:30 p.m.
in the book signing area.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.040
So, without further ado,
let's put our hands together

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.510
and give a warm welcome
to Mike Curato.

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.110
[ Applause ]

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.410
&gt;&gt; Hi everyone.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.710
Hi! How are you doing?

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.010
Good? Yeah?

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.620 position:56%
You want to go on a road trip today?

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:00.070
This is nice, because you
get to just sit in side,

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.670
and go on a road trip, right?

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.310
Okay we've got a lot to see today.

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.030
So I am going to be speaking,

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.420
and you can follow along
on the screen, okay?

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.400
And this is called All the Way
to Havana, and it is written

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.560
by my friend, Margarita Engle,
and this is a book about going

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.900
from the country to the
city, and then later,

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.920 position:56%
I'm going to read you my new Little
Elliot book, about being in the city

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.310
and going to the country.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.550
So, okay here we go!

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.600
Here are the end papers here.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.100
See all these old cars?

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.530 position:56%
They're old American cars, and in
Cuba, they have a lot of them there.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.830
And you can see a whole bunch

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.220
of different types
here on the end papers.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.400
Okay. And do we-- do we actually
have a copy of the book with us?

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.400
No? Okay. All right.

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.670
&gt;&gt; I have a copy!

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:13.970
&gt;&gt; Oh, you do?

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.270
Great, thank you so much.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.570
It's hard to read from over here.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.870
Okay.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:22.910
Okay so here is our title page.

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.370
And Margarita is-- oh, I'm
sorry, can we back up the slide?

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.730
Thank you.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.510
Okay, so Margarita
dedicated this book:

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.340
[ Speaking Spanish ]

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.240
&gt;&gt; And that means, for my cousins,
and for my nieces and nephews.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.470
And I dedicated this book,
[speaking Spanish], and that means

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.240
for Eric, my traveling brother.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.760
My travel buddy.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.820
Okay, here we go.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:56.790
We have a gift and we have a
cake, and today we are going

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.820
to drive all the way to the big
city to see my new baby cousin

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.670
on his zero year birthday.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.020
So this is a farm in Cuba.

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.740
Some of this island's old cars purr
like kittens, but ours is so tired

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.760
that she just chatters
like a busy chicken.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.190
Cada-cada [assumed spelling],
cada-cada, cluck, cluck, cluck!

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:33.320
Today, Cada-cada sounds
like a tiny baby chick.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:35.300
Pio-pio-pio-pio [assumed spelling].

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.480
Pfff [assumed spelling]!

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.330
Papa opens the trunk and lets
me hand him the heavy tool box.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.080
Then, he raises the hood to
show me all the rattling parts

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.450
that have been fixed
with wire, tape,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.860 position:56%
and mixed up scraps of dented metal.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.230
See that on the right there?

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:55.950
That's an engine inside the car.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.320
And the car is so old, and it
breaks down sometimes, and in Cuba,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.010
they can't get new parts for
the cars, so they use parts

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.030
from all these different machines.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.330
Whatever works.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.660 position:56%
He listens to each tapping
taka-taka noise that cada-cada makes

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:19.630
as together we struggle to
fix all the grunts, squeals,

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.280
and grumbling clunk-clunks that
should be busy cluck-cluck-clucks!

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.350
I choose a wrench, and
a bolt, and a belt.

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.830
No luck, but we keep
trying and trying,

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.730
even though all the silly noises
are still a mystery unsolved.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.720
We don't give up.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.070
We experiment.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.000
We invent.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.300
A twist here.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.900
A tightening there.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.690
Move this, hold that.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:05:00.550
Try one way, then the other, until
finally after discouraging minutes

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.180
that feel like endless hours,
cada-cada once again begins

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.030
to sound like a chattering hen.

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:19.360
The road is bumpy, and our
noisy car ends up so crowded

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.990
with friendly neighbors
who need a ride,

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:26.800
that I feel like we are traveling
in a barrel of elbows and knees.

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.380
But we have a gift, and we
have a cake, and we are driving

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.620
to my new baby cousin's
zero-year birthday.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:42.510
So we purr, cada-cada,
and we glide, taka-taka.

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:44.110
And we zoom!

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:46.010
Zoom! Zoom!

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:53.360
Cluck-cluck-cluck, beside farms,
forests, beaches and forts.

00:05:56.690 --> 00:06:00.930
Toward the curved road by the
sea wall, where Mama points

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.880
out noisy old cars of every color.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:12.430
Yellow, pink, purple, green,
orange, and even a bright red car,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.450
with huge fins, like
a lurking shark.

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:20.710
I am glad that cada-cada
is peacefully blue,

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:28.730
like the clear sky above,
and the wide sea beyond.

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.870
Some of the noisy old cars
around us have torn seats,

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:37.510
shattered windows,
and cracked mirrors.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:47.030
Many of the cars roar,
growl, whine, or putt-putt.

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.230
But most just honk, honk, honk!

00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:59.880
As they glide, bumpety-bump
on potholed city streets.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.880
Where people lean over
crumbling balconies

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:11.650
as laundry dances, and
a sea breeze sings.

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:21.740
When we finally reach Tia's house,
I hug Abuelo, and everyone smiles,

00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:26.450
as we admire the funny baby boy
who is too little to know how

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:30.850
to open a gift, or play
with a box, and a ribbon,

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:34.960
or build a teetering
mango and pineapple tower.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:43.670
After lunch, cake, music,
and a happy birthday fiesta,

00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:46.980
I need a quiet siesta,
but when I wake up,

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:51.140
I discover that it is already
time to start driving home.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:56.230
So we zoom, and bump all the
way back to our little village,

00:07:56.230 --> 00:08:00.640
where we will soon have
a chance to cada-cada,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:02.730
taka-taka, pio-pio, clunk!

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:05.030
Sleep.

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:10.820
The next morning, we have
to work under the hood,

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:13.550
once again, never giving up.

00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:15.410
Never losing hope.

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:19.980
I am eager to help Papa
guess which tool is best.

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:23.600
When he asks me which
city trip car I like most,

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.500
the answer is easy, our car!

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:31.760
This noisy blue one with its
ragged seats, and cloudy windows,

00:08:31.760 --> 00:08:35.590
because cada-cada already
belonged to our family on the day

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:41.710
when my Abuelo, my old grandpa,
celebrated his zero-year birthday.

00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:46.550 position:56%
Someday, Abuelo's car will be
yours, Papa promises, making me feel

00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:50.110
as proud and as powerful
as the bold eagle

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:55.660
that makes cada-cada's sky
blue hood look so brave.

00:08:58.370 --> 00:09:02.370
So, that is Margarita's and
my story, and at the end

00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:05.980
of [applause begins] the
book, thank you, thanks!

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:09.450
And at the end of the book,
we each wrote a little note,

00:09:09.450 --> 00:09:14.570
kind of explaining more about
why Cuba has all these cars,

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:19.580
and I wrote about going there,
and doing research for this book,

00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:22.520
which I want to show
you a little bit of now.

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:25.940
Okay, so here is our
book's journey, right?

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:30.420
Our book went on a long road trip.

00:09:30.420 --> 00:09:32.480
Here is our editor, Laura Godwin.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.050
She had a bright idea.

00:09:34.050 --> 00:09:36.990
She is like, "I think
there should be a book."

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:41.580
So she told Margarita and me, "Hey,
why don't you two make it for me?"

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:43.880
And we said, "Sure."

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:49.940
So there is Margarita, and she
started out by writing the story.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:57.420 position:56%
And then I get the story, and so
Margarita, she grew up spending half

00:09:57.420 --> 00:10:01.940
of her time in Cuba, and half
of her time in the States.

00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.610
But I am not Cuban, and
I had never been there,

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:07.900
and so I thought it was important
for me to find out what it is

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:10.710
like there, so I can
make a really good story.

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:13.040
And see that circle down there?

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:16.060
There is Cuba, just
south of Florida, there.

00:10:16.060 --> 00:10:18.220
So I went all the way down there,

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:22.070
with my friend Eric,
who was my translator.

00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:23.370
There we are.

00:10:23.370 --> 00:10:25.220
And there is the real cada-cada.

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:26.520
She is real.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.820
We took a road trip.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:33.110
Here are some photos I
took all over Cuba, right?

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:36.490
So they helped me make my drawings.

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.500
And here is where it all starts,

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.540
I start with these really
messy, sloppy drawings.

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.230
Right? What is all that?

00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:45.120
It is just a bunch
of scratches, right?

00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:49.530
But I am just thinking about
different compositions,

00:10:49.530 --> 00:10:53.870
about like how each
page will look maybe?

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:58.760
And this one is getting a little
bit better, and then I take a bunch

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.880
of my photos, and I paste
them together in photo shop.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:10.750
And then I make my drawing, while
I'm looking at those photographs.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.180
And then, here comes the color.

00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:20.410
So, some of the color is digital,

00:11:20.410 --> 00:11:24.480
and then some of it is
paint that I scan in.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:28.350
And some of it comes from
the photographs that I took,

00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:30.960
so I could get the textures
from all the buildings

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.370
and the roads, and the cars.

00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:36.980
Oh, there is the sky.

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:40.450
And this building here, that is the
Flatiron building in New York City.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:42.730
That is where our publisher is.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.610
Just to remind us that even
though Margarita wrote it,

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:49.070
and I illustrated it, it takes a
lot of people to make one book.

00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:50.500
A whole lot of people.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.560
And that is where they work, in
that weird triangle building.

00:11:55.560 --> 00:11:59.220
Okay, so we don't have a lot
of time left, but I am going

00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:01.110
to read Fall Friends,
and then we are going

00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.460
to do some drawing together, okay?

00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:06.160
Okay! So, this is my other book.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:08.840
This is the book about going
from the city to the country.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:11.270 position:56%
Does anyone here know Little Elliot?

00:12:11.270 --> 00:12:14.010

Okay. So. Little Elliot
and his best friend, Mouse,

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.960
loved living in the big city.

00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:46.900
But sometimes the city was too
dirty, too loud, and too busy.

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:50.200
"We need a vacation," said Mouse.

walking your cupcakes home,

descend upon you.

the Little Elliot book?

Later that morning, Elliot and Mouse
boarded a bus bound for the country.

00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:43.160
They could see the
bright autumn leaves,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:51.010
as the big city slowly
disappeared behind them.

00:13:51.010 --> 00:13:55.300
Elliot and Mouse got off the
bus and smelled the fresh air.

00:13:55.300 --> 00:14:00.750
"Wow!" said Elliot, "The country
is even bigger than the city!"

00:14:00.750 --> 00:14:03.010
"I'll race you up that
hill," said Mouse.

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:10.260
At the top of the hill, Elliot
and Mouse could feel the breeze,

00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:13.350
and the sunshine, and
the soft grass.

00:14:13.350 --> 00:14:17.130

"I am getting hungry," he said.

trees down there," said Mouse.

said Elliot.

"Let's play hide-and-seek!"

00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:50.290
First, Mouse found Elliot
hiding in a hollow log.

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:58.570
Then, Elliot found Mouse
hiding in a pumpkin patch.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.650
Elliot picked the perfect
hiding place.

00:15:01.650 --> 00:15:05.010
"Mouse will never find
me here," he thought.

00:15:09.050 --> 00:15:11.160
Elliot was right!

He waited, and waited,
but Mouse never came.

Suddenly, Elliot smelled
something delicious.

be worth looking for, he thought.

Mouse, sweeping from behind the pie.

"When I couldn't find
you, my new friends

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.100
and I baked a pie," said Mouse.

00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:08.350
"I told them you would
follow your nose."

00:16:08.350 --> 00:16:12.240
"Nobody knows me better,"
said Elliot.

Later, they all gathered
for a fall feast.

"And to new treats," said Elliot.

That night, Elliot and
Mouse nestled into the hay
