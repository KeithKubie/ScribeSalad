00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:03.233
[music playing]

00:00:03.233 --> 00:00:05.100
Oh, what's it doing?

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.800
It's still pointing
in the right direction?

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.367
It's drifting towards us.

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:09.700
NARRATOR: Paul is
flying the climate

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.300
team's $80,000 drone system.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.133
And it's fighting so much
wind, it just can't handle it.

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:19.200
NARRATOR: And the winds are
gusting to 70 miles per hour.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.000
Maintain heading.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.266
I'll tell you when to turn.

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.066
Thank you.

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.700
That's good.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.367
Do a right-hand turn in
three, two, one-- now.

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:29.934
[whirring]

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:30.800
How's that?

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.600
That's good.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.333
Maintain heading.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:36.000
That's easier said than done
when it's beyond 54 knots.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.934
You're doing good.

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:38.367
We're seeing
60-knot average wind

00:00:38.367 --> 00:00:40.767
speeds, which is very high.

00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:43.667
The most I've ever flown
in is about 50 knots.

00:00:43.667 --> 00:00:45.233
Left-hand turn a bit.

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:46.200
Keep going.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.734
But yeah, there's
obviously more

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:50.867
pressure to make the most of
the remaining time we've got.

00:00:50.867 --> 00:00:52.367
It's gonna move south a bit.

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:53.800
And if we don't
fly, they're going

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.567
to be missing a large
component of the data

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:57.300
that they planned on getting.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.800
A right-hand turn again
in three, two, one.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.767
[whirring]

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:03.867
I mean, it just
can't handle it.

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:05.100
It's too much wind for it.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.367
We do a couple of more,
and then we call it off.

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.166
[music playing]

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:12.600
Your left hand,
adjustment a little bit.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.600
That's it?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.867
Because it's struggling
into that wind,

00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:16.200
it's using battery up faster.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.400
We might have to land.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.433
Keep going-- almost there.

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:20.400
Right-hand turn, now.

00:01:23.367 --> 00:01:25.300
A low battery-- now
I've got a battery alert.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.233
I'm coming home.

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:27.033
OK.

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:28.300
That's good.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.367
NARRATOR: The team has a
complete data set from higher

00:01:30.367 --> 00:01:32.467
altitude, but they
still need to get

00:01:32.467 --> 00:01:34.734
the drone back in one piece.

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:37.967
We've got to figure out
where we're going to land.

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:42.233
So this dry, dusty sand
gets into the motor,

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:44.600
so we're going to try and
land on this wet sand.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.500
Of course, the danger with
that is there's a river.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.100
So if we overshoot our landing,
we end up in the drink.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.200
That would be bad.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.667
The gear is not waterproof.

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:53.834
You ready?

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:55.500
Retract the probe
please, [inaudible].

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.100
OK, the probe
should be retracted.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.467
OK, good.

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:01.767
[MUSIC PLAYING AND A WHINING
SOUNDS]

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.033
[cheering]

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:07.100
Oh, you like hopped the river.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.500
How cool was that?

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.200
Outstanding.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.133
So from the angle I
was standing back there,

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:15.400
there's a bit of terrain.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.400
You can see the skid
mark-- bounce, jump.
