ANDREA BRIMMER: That is
a-- that is a very nice

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.470
welcome, very nice.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:13.180
I appreciate it.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:15.220
Very spontaneous, so thank you.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.180
Thanks, Jess, for
having me here today.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.880
I appreciate it.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.830
So what I wanted to
chat a little bit

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.812
with you guys about
today-- and first of all,

00:00:22.812 --> 00:00:24.020
thank you for having me here.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.350
I'm excited to be here--

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.630
is the importance of
bravery in marketing

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.940
and why that's so
important, really,

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.240
in today's marketing landscape
and in the world that

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.160
is, really, so focused
on technology and data

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.780
and how we intercept the art
and the science of marketing.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.920
And if you look at just
the technical definition

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.160
of bravery, it's this idea
of the quality or state

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.330
of having or showing mental or
moral strength to face danger,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.400
fear, or difficulty.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.550
So those are really powerful
words when you think about them

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.930
in the business context,
but from the lens of a CMO,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.440
why are they so important?

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.690
Well, they're important
for a number of reasons.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.860
First and foremost, the CMO
seat, especially these days,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.090
is a hot seat.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.810
The average tenure
for a CMO is 18 months

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:18.319
according to a
recent study, and I'm

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:20.110
going to talk a little
bit more about this.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.820
But 80% of CEOs
actually say that they

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.300
don't trust their CMO,
and we'll get into that.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.330
But having bravery
is a path forward.

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.870
This idea of kind of facing
danger, fear, or difficulty,

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.660
I think, aligns really
well with this idea

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.700
that I'm talking about.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.840
And I think, in a
world where people

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.390
are so overwhelmed with choice,
and people have so little time

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.520
in their day anymore,
that you have

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.369
to be brave to breakthrough,
and as marketers, that's

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:53.660
what we're really trying to do.

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.330
We're trying to break through
and make emotional engagements

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.910
with people, and it's more
difficult than ever before.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:04.390
And I think we know a
little bit about bravery,

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.510
if you think about my
company, Ally Financial,

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.710
and what we did.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.140
So think about the fact
that, like you guys,

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.570
we're a pretty young company.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:15.260
10 years ago, we
didn't even exist,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.080
which is hard to believe.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.970
And what we did is we launched
in the worst financial crisis

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.920
since the Great Depression.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.870
We were spun off
from General Motors.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.930
We were GMs captive
auto finance company,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.140
and GM was going through
its bankruptcy and needed

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.990
liquidity.

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.340
And so the idea was to sell the
captive, and all of a sudden,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.910
we found ourselves
in a marketplace

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.230
where we had been engineered
and built to do one thing,

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:48.440
and that was to serve
auto loans to GM dealers.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.630
Suddenly, we're in this
complete financial crisis,

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.440
where is, markets
are crashing down.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.830
There's no access to liquidity.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.420
We have no mother ship anymore.

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.530
GM is gone, and we
had to change or die.

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.130
And we had thousands of people
that were depending on us,

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.620
as employees of Ally.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.980
But bigger than that,
we had 17,000 dealers

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.860
that were dependent
on us to survive,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:18.400
and we had, really,
the responsibility

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.740
of a huge impact on the American
economy if GMAC went down.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.330
And so what we had to do
is start from scratch,

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.030
and we had to rethink the
way that we were going

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.400
to go to market completely.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.520
And we really felt like
there's this huge opportunity,

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.920
and everybody was saying to
us, what are you going to do?

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.740
And our thought was, we're
going to launch a bank,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.530
and the bank is going to
become the deposit gathering

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:47.260
capability that will
fund the auto loans.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:49.540
And we'll kind of
reinvent ourselves

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.030
to be able to have the
ability to do that.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.740
And we're not going to
just create a normal bank.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.340
We're going to create a
digital bank because we needed

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.960
to get to market quickly.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.000
We didn't have time
for infrastructure

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.110
to build brick and
mortar locations,

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.880
and we were on a
very short time frame

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.450
in order to be able to
start generating revenue

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:12.610
before our liquidity ran out.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.209
Complicating that is the
government came to us and said,

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:18.880
we're going to close
down Chrysler Capital,

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.730
and we want you to take on all
the Chrysler dealers as well.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.520
So that added significant
pressure to our timeline

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.340
and to what it was
that we needed to do.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:29.140
And everybody was
saying, a bank?

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.190
The world doesn't
need another bank.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.370
That's the last thing anybody
wants is another bank.

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.810
And our mantra at the
time was this notion

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.810
that, yeah, the world
doesn't need another bank,

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.610
but it needs a better bank.

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.020
And we took this bet that
everybody would be banking

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.500
in the palm of their hand.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.360
Now, it seems really
intuitive now, 10 years later,

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.960
as you watch all these
big companies scramble

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.960
to get to digital financial
services solutions,

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.360
but 10 years ago,
there was nobody out

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.520
in the category like us.

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.410
We also saw a ton of pain
points in the category.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.660
People were either
completely apathetic.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.300
They weren't paying
any attention

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.090
to how their banks
were treating them.

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.730
And if you think about
it, in a lot of ways,

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.520
we were putting up with
things that, as consumers, we

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.320
shouldn't be putting up with.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.155
Why should I pay $5 to get
my money out of the wall?

00:05:24.155 --> 00:05:24.780
Think about it.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.430
You still do it today.

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.700
Why do I have my money
sitting in a bank that doesn't

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.770
pay any interest on my savings?

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.050
People still do it today.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:37.080
Why can't I have
24 by 7 service?

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:38.860
Money's a really
important thing.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:40.230
I work really hard for my money.

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:42.470
My family depends on my money.

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:45.900
Yet if it's past 5 o'clock or 6
o'clock, and something happens,

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.990
I can't talk to
anybody at a bank.

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.820
Why is everything so confusing?

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:52.770
Why is the jargon so confusing?

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:57.030
Why do banks purposely try and
confuse you and hide things

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.060
from you, whether they're hidden
fees, this bait and switch

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.230
mentality?

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.870
So a lot of pain
points, and we really

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.750
felt like there was this huge
opportunity and a better way

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.930
forward, and that really
is what created Ally.

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:13.560
So literally, in a
six-month period of time,

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.080
back during that
financial crisis,

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.270
a very small group
of us pretty much

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.580
spent the whole entire
summer in New York

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.330
with a branding company
and an advertising agency,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:26.550
and we came up with
what we thought

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:28.300
was a better way forward.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.420
And we created Ally.

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:32.380
The launch was really different.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.630
We really took on the big banks.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.120
What we wanted to do was
of create this awakening.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.900
We wanted to reach out
and shake people and get

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.870
them to pay attention and
get them to pay attention

00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:44.585
to what was happening
in the category

00:06:44.585 --> 00:06:45.960
and, also, what
was paying-- what

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.770
was happening to their money.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:51.450
And so we launched in a really
loud and disruptive way.

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:55.230
And as a marketer at the
time, this was really

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:59.999
a brave campaign, and I'll talk
a little bit about how it did.

00:06:59.999 --> 00:07:02.040
I'll talk a little bit
about some of the reaction

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:04.720
and some of the things
that occurred as a result.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:07.964
But the whole business model
itself was brave, but also

00:07:07.964 --> 00:07:09.630
the way that we came
to market, I think,

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.740
is a great example of that.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.600
So let me play a couple of spots
that you guys may or may not

00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.560
remember.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:18.684
This is the way that
Ally came to market.

00:08:20.063 --> 00:08:21.200
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:23.140
ANDREA BRIMMER: So
a really bold way

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.600
to come to market in a
category that had always

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:30.130
done just really boring, really
plain type of advertising.

00:08:30.130 --> 00:08:34.360
Everything about what we did
was brave, including the color--

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.770
a purple bank.

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:39.130
I mean, what we did is
we put, up on the wall,

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:41.650
all bank advertising,
and everything

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.064
was either red, white, or blue.

00:08:43.064 --> 00:08:44.980
If you think about it,
like look around today,

00:08:44.980 --> 00:08:46.374
you'll see the same thing.

00:08:46.374 --> 00:08:48.040
And so we thought,
we want to stand out.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.450
We're going to be
a digital bank.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:50.960
We want to do
something different,

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.260
and we chose the color purple.

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:57.520
These spots-- the idea was
RJ represented the big banks,

00:08:57.520 --> 00:08:59.830
and we wanted to
clearly call out

00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:03.160
how dishonorably banks
were behaving and the fact

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.670
that even little kids recognize
when something is wrong.

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:09.580
Everything was
shot hidden camera.

00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:12.610
All the cameramen were
in those play structures

00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:14.200
that you saw in the
background there.

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:16.990
The kids thought that they were
coming in for focus groups,

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.150
and we got real reactions.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:22.310
And they just blew up.

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:23.740
I mean, it resonated.

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:26.560
It created that emotional
connection with people

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:27.640
right away.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:29.530
I remember shooting
the one with a pony,

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:31.150
and we shot a bunch
of different kids

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.590
just to get the best reactions.

00:09:32.590 --> 00:09:36.250
And we shot these two
sisters, and they came in,

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.560
and they did the--

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.320
RJ did the, do you want a
pony, yes, do you want a pony.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.650
And I was sitting with
her mom in the green room,

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:47.389
and when the other
sister got the real pony,

00:09:47.389 --> 00:09:48.930
the other little
sister turned to her

00:09:48.930 --> 00:09:51.115
and punched her
right in the face.

00:09:51.115 --> 00:09:52.970
I was like, I really
want to use that one,

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:56.420
but we decided to go
with this one instead.

00:09:56.420 --> 00:09:59.770
But it was a really great
way for us to come to market.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:02.290
And it really helped
us build a brand,

00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:06.230
and it helped us get in the--
get on the landscape very,

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:07.730
very quickly.

00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.570
And if you kind of fast
forward now, 10 years later,

00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:11.950
and look at how we--

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:14.740
how we've done, it's
been unbelievable.

00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:19.750
We have 1.4 million
customers of Ally bank.

00:10:19.750 --> 00:10:22.910
On the auto side, 4 and
1/2 million customers,

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.360
so all totaled, about
5 and 1/2 million

00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.240
customers that we do
business with today.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:34.610
In 10 years, nine-- almost $95
billion in deposits, and this

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:37.600
is for something where
there's no brick and mortar.

00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:41.240
People are just
interacting with us online,

00:10:41.240 --> 00:10:44.160
and we've grown to
be a top 25 bank.

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.740
Our bank CEO was named one of
the top 10 most powerful women

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:50.710
in banking last year,
and we've built a company

00:10:50.710 --> 00:10:53.710
from the ground up by
being brave and going

00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:56.200
to market in a
very different way

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:59.650
and creating something where
we saw a ton of whitespace

00:10:59.650 --> 00:11:02.770
and a ton of
opportunity in a time

00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:06.520
where there was a category
that needed to be disrupted

00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:09.296
and a category that
needed to be shaken up.

00:11:09.296 --> 00:11:11.170
The other thing that
we've done along the way

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:14.770
is we've built this
incredibly magical brand.

00:11:14.770 --> 00:11:20.740
And our CEO talks about his
six strategic priorities,

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:23.740
and the one thing that he
talks about in his priorities

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:25.930
is brand as a weapon.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:29.170
And I think that's a huge
testament to what we've

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.150
done from a marketing
perspective,

00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:33.550
because marketing's been
a catalyst for helping

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:36.010
build this brand,
and then having

00:11:36.010 --> 00:11:39.400
the right internal inertia,
much like you guys do,

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:42.670
to back up the promise of
what the brand stands for.

00:11:42.670 --> 00:11:44.650
A couple of years ago,
Boston Consulting Group

00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.160
did a list of the up and
coming brands to watch,

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:54.100
and it was Hulu, it was Tesla,
it was GoPro, it was Snapchat,

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:57.520
it was Airbnb, and Ally.

00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:01.600
No other banks on that list,
and no Fortune 500 companies

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:02.770
on that list.

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.130
Last year, Gale and Seigel did
a list of their top disruptor

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:09.490
brands, and same kind of list--

00:12:09.490 --> 00:12:15.190
Uber and GrubHub and Airbnb
and Spotify and Ally.

00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:18.280
So very different
kinds of brands,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:20.860
but it underscores
what we've done

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:24.550
and how we've been disruptive
and how we've used bravery

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:28.120
to really create an entirely new
category on something, if you

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.960
think about it, that's been
around for over 100 years.

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.570
So as we kind of
fast forward now,

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:38.170
10 years later, and look at
where we're at, last year,

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.050
we made a big strategic pivot.

00:12:41.050 --> 00:12:44.920
And we decided that we were
going to expand our product

00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.240
portfolio.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:49.090
Given how much consumers
really like doing business

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:52.480
with us on the banking side,
and the fact that we only

00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:56.680
had savings products, we
wanted to expand rapidly.

00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:59.020
So we launched-- we
bought a company,

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:03.010
and we launched an all
online investing platform, so

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.440
self-directed and
managed portfolios.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.070
We stood up, very quickly,
a mortgage capability.

00:13:09.070 --> 00:13:11.390
We partnered with
another company,

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.210
and we stood up a credit card.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:15.790
And we purchased a
company in California

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:18.880
to do direct to consumer auto
lending, kind of like a Lending

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:21.790
Tree model, but to
have the ability

00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:23.400
to be able to reach
into consumers

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.150
and not just have to
work with the dealers

00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.230
on indirect lending, but give us
that indirect lending platform.

00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.500
We're also in the process of
completely reinventing our auto

00:13:32.500 --> 00:13:36.340
business to be the digital
choice for dealers.

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.110
As dealer's businesses
are transforming,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:41.050
and that category
is finally starting

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:44.240
to catch up to the rest
of the retail world,

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.930
how do we power
dealers so that any way

00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:49.570
that a consumer wants to
interact with them digitally,

00:13:49.570 --> 00:13:52.180
we can be at the center
of those interactions,

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.160
giving them what they need
from a lending standpoint?

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:58.360
So this necessitated
a change in pace

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:01.030
in terms of how we
are going to market.

00:14:01.030 --> 00:14:04.130
And again, we needed
to be very disruptive,

00:14:04.130 --> 00:14:06.430
and we needed to be very brave.

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:09.250
We're in a category
that spends ferociously.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.180
The financial services
category spends over $2 billion

00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:17.260
a year on advertising,
and where less than 2%

00:14:17.260 --> 00:14:19.760
share a voice in that category.

00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:22.300
So for me, the
challenge was how do we

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.430
outwit, outlast, and outplay?

00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:26.590
How do we break
through and do things

00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:28.780
that are very different
than what everybody else is

00:14:28.780 --> 00:14:30.710
doing in the category?

00:14:30.710 --> 00:14:33.310
So we repositioned
ourselves, moving

00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:35.500
to this positioning
of a relentless ally

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:39.520
for your financial well-being,
and we created a campaign

00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.707
that we wanted to
humanize ourselves.

00:14:42.707 --> 00:14:44.290
Since we didn't have
brick and mortar,

00:14:44.290 --> 00:14:46.330
and people couldn't
walk into a branch,

00:14:46.330 --> 00:14:48.940
we wanted to do something
that was fun, something that

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:52.330
was differentiated, that
showed that people of Ally

00:14:52.330 --> 00:14:55.240
being relentless and
going over the top

00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:57.460
and doing things in a
really interesting way

00:14:57.460 --> 00:14:59.630
for our customers.

00:14:59.630 --> 00:15:02.890
So we tried to be disruptive
in literally everything we did.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.164
We used disruptive creative.

00:15:04.164 --> 00:15:05.830
I'm going to show you
a couple of pieces

00:15:05.830 --> 00:15:07.450
of creative in a second.

00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:11.110
Really changed up our look in
terms of our graphic design

00:15:11.110 --> 00:15:12.190
and our visual look.

00:15:12.190 --> 00:15:15.670
I mean, when you look at
this plum and our people

00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.640
in the advertising
and the headlines,

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:22.060
they have that clever wit,
and they just broke through.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:23.890
They weren't like
anything else that you

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:25.930
were seeing in our
category, or really

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:28.900
in any other category
for that matter.

00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:31.300
We used really
differentiated media,

00:15:31.300 --> 00:15:33.670
so we partnered with a
lot of content providers

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:36.070
that we had never
partnered with before--

00:15:36.070 --> 00:15:38.590
Pop Sugar and Vice.

00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:40.150
We did a really cool
promotion called

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:45.040
Lucky Penny, where we actually
got this idea that people

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.750
hate pennies.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:49.731
The US government is thinking
about not minting pennies

00:15:49.731 --> 00:15:50.230
anymore.

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:52.180
They stopped minting
pennies in Canada.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:53.650
I get them, and
I throw them out.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.980
Or you always leave them in that
little jar at the convenience

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.231
store because no one wants
to carry them around.

00:15:59.231 --> 00:16:00.730
And so we wanted
to create something

00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.680
interesting around
this idea that a penny

00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:06.100
saved is a penny earned, and
that even the smallest amount

00:16:06.100 --> 00:16:09.580
of savings can go a long way.

00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:12.670
And so we hid 10
pennies in 10 cities

00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.880
across the country,
each worth $1,000.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:19.420
They were Ally branded pennies,
and we used social media

00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.110
to push out clues about
where those pennies were.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:29.080
And we created this unbelievable
groundswell of activity

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.450
around people getting
together and trying

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.540
to go find those pennies, and
the stories that came out of it

00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:36.010
were unbelievable.

00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:39.040
And it got so big that
Jimmy Kimmel actually

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:43.240
did a segment on it where
Guillermo actually went outside

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:46.979
in LA, set up a tent,
and had people come in,

00:16:46.979 --> 00:16:48.520
where he had a sign
outside that said

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.140
"A penny for your thoughts."

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.200
And they filmed all this
really funny content of people

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.750
coming in, asking
Guillermo a question,

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:58.630
him answering the question
with something outrageous that

00:16:58.630 --> 00:17:01.630
made literally no sense,
collecting all these pennies,

00:17:01.630 --> 00:17:03.910
and then looking for
the Ally lucky penny.

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.240
So these were ways where we were
able to get our brand in front

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:10.480
of people in really different
and unique use of media.

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.790
We created a lot of really
interesting partnerships,

00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:15.040
partnered with influencers
that we had never

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.440
partnered with before,
people like Big and Rich,

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.640
who are very differentiated
people in the country music

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.680
space, that do
things their own way;

00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.400
and Danny Coker,
who sponsored ICC,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.650
which is the international
soccer friendlies.

00:17:29.650 --> 00:17:33.940
We even created an entire
fragrance line around the idea

00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.040
that people's favorite smell
is the smell of a new car.

00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.650
So we created a
line of fragrances

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:42.310
called New Car Smell, and we
had 15 different fragrances

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:44.830
that we displayed
at auto shows that

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:51.100
were all around this idea of
SUV smell and minivan smell.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:53.980
We had people walking around
auto shows with scent strips,

00:17:53.980 --> 00:17:57.040
handing them out, just like
you go into a department store.

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.490
You had the ability, on an
iPad, to create your own scent,

00:18:00.490 --> 00:18:03.490
and then we surprised 50
people from each auto show,

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:05.650
and we actually made
their scent and sent it

00:18:05.650 --> 00:18:08.110
to them, so really
just different ways

00:18:08.110 --> 00:18:10.780
to go out and do
interesting things.

00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:13.660
We created something called
our Disruptor Calendar,

00:18:13.660 --> 00:18:16.360
and we did things
like Lucky Penny.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:19.720
We created an app called
Splurge Alert app,

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:22.090
and what you did with the
Splurge Alert app is you

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:24.370
actually downloaded the app.

00:18:24.370 --> 00:18:27.100
And then you could go into
it, and you put into the app

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:28.780
what your financial
kryptonite is.

00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:32.780
So for me, it might be
Nordstrom's or a Prada store,

00:18:32.780 --> 00:18:35.680
a car dealership,
or a wine store.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.950
And then we geofence
those locations,

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.620
and every time you walked
into one of those locations,

00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.200
you got an alert from
the Ally Splurge Alert

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:46.780
app that would say, Andrea,
get the hell out of there.

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.420
Last time you were there,
it was a bad scene.

00:18:49.420 --> 00:18:52.240
And they were all
really fun and humorous.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:55.060
And then you actually got
to pick splurge buddies,

00:18:55.060 --> 00:18:58.390
and it pushed an alert
to your splurge buddies--

00:18:58.390 --> 00:19:00.340
kind of like AA,
not that I'd know.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:05.050
And those people could text you
and say, what are you doing?

00:19:05.050 --> 00:19:06.670
You're saving for
your kids college.

00:19:06.670 --> 00:19:07.570
Get out of Nordstrom.

00:19:07.570 --> 00:19:09.490
So it was a really
fun way to get

00:19:09.490 --> 00:19:10.900
people to think
about their money

00:19:10.900 --> 00:19:13.840
differently without
preaching to them.

00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:17.460
And then we really went
on the offensive with PR.

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:22.390
We had never really used earned
media as anything but reactive,

00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:25.660
and so we went out
and got very, I

00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:28.240
think, differentiated
and brave in terms

00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.650
of what we were doing with PR.

00:19:29.650 --> 00:19:31.810
One of the things that
we did that was just

00:19:31.810 --> 00:19:35.394
really interesting is
we-- we're an online bank.

00:19:35.394 --> 00:19:37.060
And if you're an
online bank, your phone

00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.770
needs to be charged
at every moment

00:19:38.770 --> 00:19:41.080
because, if you want to
interact with your money,

00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:43.390
you need a phone that's working.

00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:46.870
So we actually had drones that
were branded with the Ally

00:19:46.870 --> 00:19:50.680
logo, and we passed out
phone chargers in malls

00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.210
through these drones.

00:19:52.210 --> 00:19:53.830
And it was just a
really cool way--

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.870
they were Ally
branded phone charges,

00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:59.170
and we got a ton of PR out
of it, a lot of earned media.

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:01.840
And it was a really
interesting and disruptive way

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:03.790
to do something different.

00:20:03.790 --> 00:20:06.880
Now, the one common
thread that I can tell you

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.940
through all of this is
that, every single point

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:14.680
of it, somebody told me
how dumb the idea was.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:17.650
Somebody told me that
it was a dangerous thing

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:19.390
to do for our brand.

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.270
Somebody told me
why it would fail.

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:25.550
Somebody told me why
we shouldn't do it.

00:20:25.550 --> 00:20:29.380
And the one thing that we
did the entire way is we

00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:31.390
filtered out the noise.

00:20:31.390 --> 00:20:35.560
And we put our heads down,
and we used the golden gut.

00:20:35.560 --> 00:20:39.520
And we believed in what we were
doing, and we pushed forward.

00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:42.070
I can't tell you how many
things like the Splurge Alert

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.660
app, where somebody
said to me, what's

00:20:43.660 --> 00:20:45.040
the business case for this?

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.350
Let me see what the ROI's
going to be on this.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:49.000
What are your KPIs?

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:51.625
And that's the world
we live in today.

00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:56.560
Everything's testable,
and everybody wants

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.510
to know what the data says.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.240
And while you have to use
the data to make informed

00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:04.780
decisions, you can't
let the data prevent you

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:08.380
from doing things that you know
are the right things to do.

00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:10.480
And you have to forge
forward, and you

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.310
have to take the
consequences good or bad.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:15.730
Not everything that
we did was awesome.

00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:18.230
Not everything that
we did was successful,

00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:22.012
but the vast majority of
what we did was successful.

00:21:22.012 --> 00:21:23.470
We have our highest
brand awareness

00:21:23.470 --> 00:21:25.840
that we've had in our
company's history.

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:32.950
Our brand engagement scores went
from 43% to over 90% right now.

00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:36.070
Our likability scores
are all in the 90s.

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.110
Our business has
never been better.

00:21:38.110 --> 00:21:41.680
Our stock was at $15 a share
when we started this campaign.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:45.440
It's near $30 a share a
year and a half later.

00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:48.580
So I encourage you guys to
think about the importance

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:52.450
of bravery, filter out the
noise, and just push forward

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:54.130
and do what you need to do.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.630
launched the new campaign.

I think, when you
see it, I think

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.826
it's great testament
of what I'm talking

00:22:01.826 --> 00:22:03.790
about relative to
doing things different

ANDREA BRIMMER: So everyone
was like Motley Crue?

00:22:38.001 --> 00:22:38.861
Are you kidding me?

00:22:38.861 --> 00:22:40.860
Even our board was like,
I think the lead singer

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:42.130
died from a drug overdose.

00:22:42.130 --> 00:22:45.160
I'm like, everybody died
from a drug overdose, then.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.410
I mean, who are we going
to find that didn't?

00:22:48.410 --> 00:22:51.660
A really different way to come
to market, a really different

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.290
way to reposition our
brand, show are people doing

00:22:55.290 --> 00:22:57.990
over-the-top things,
and just have fun,

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:00.990
and what ended up happening
as a result of this spot,

00:23:00.990 --> 00:23:02.670
is it caught fire.

00:23:02.670 --> 00:23:04.650
And everybody in
social was talking

00:23:04.650 --> 00:23:08.130
about doing the hand thing,
and so we stoked the fire

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:10.950
by immediately jumping on
it and having a contest

00:23:10.950 --> 00:23:13.740
and telling people to send
in their best content of them

00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:15.150
doing the hand thing.

00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:16.650
And then we surprised
and delighted

00:23:16.650 --> 00:23:21.540
people with different prizes for
the best pictures or the best

00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.070
content that came in.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:26.400
So again, just doing things
differently, being brave,

00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.010
and getting outside
of the space.

00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:31.230
Recently, we did something
around the Super Bowl

00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:33.870
that I wanted to show you guys.

00:23:33.870 --> 00:23:35.760
This was, I think,
another moment

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:41.075
of bravery, which is this
idea that everybody can buy--

00:23:41.075 --> 00:23:43.200
every big marketer can buy
a spot in the Super Bowl

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:44.440
if they want.

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:47.140
But for us, we felt like it was
duplicitous to spend a couple

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:49.560
million on a spot
in the Super Bowl

00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.200
when we're out there telling
our customers to think

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.670
about having a savings mindset.

00:23:54.670 --> 00:23:56.670
So we wanted to take
advantage of the biggest

00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:00.150
day of consumerism
by intercepting

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:03.180
it and interrupting it
in a really unique way.

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:06.382
So I'm going to show you a

00:24:06.382 --> 00:24:08.340
a good sense of it, and
we'll talk a little bit

ANDREA BRIMMER: So again, a very
different way to go to market.

00:25:29.384 --> 00:25:32.780
In a time when all brands are
spending millions of dollars

00:25:32.780 --> 00:25:35.690
to get you to buy a bag of
Doritos or a Mountain Dew

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:39.920
by producing giant television
spots, we did something,

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:41.720
I think, much
different than that,

00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:44.670
and we created this
virtual reality app.

00:25:44.670 --> 00:25:47.090
And again, a lot of
questions around it.

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:48.300
What if the app doesn't work?

00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:50.100
What if it crashes that night?

00:25:50.100 --> 00:25:51.710
What if other brands
are mad at us?

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:55.310
Because the app only activated
during the commercial breaks,

00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:57.370
so that was the only
time that you could play.

00:25:57.370 --> 00:26:00.110
We were taking eyes away from
the investment that people

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:02.180
had in their Super Bowl spots.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:04.322
And again, there
was some risk to it.

00:26:04.322 --> 00:26:05.780
We had never done
it we didn't know

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:07.700
how the technology would work.

00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:11.330
Mercedes had a bit of a fiasco
with a virtual reality idea

00:26:11.330 --> 00:26:16.320
during the Super Bowl, and
for us, it turned out awesome.

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.200
We had a million
and a half people

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.780
that came to our microsite.

00:26:35.930 --> 00:26:40.700
We had 660,000 rounds
of the game played.

00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:45.290
And what we did is we had
the top 15 scores submitted.

00:26:45.290 --> 00:26:49.250
And we selected the best
stories and the high scores,

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:50.900
merged those two
together, and we

00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:52.910
granted those people's wishes.

00:26:52.910 --> 00:26:56.150
And now, we're getting the
outgrowth of all of the PR

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:57.810
that went along with that.

00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:01.580
And I think just to
punctuate the different way

00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:04.490
that we went to market on
this, our CEO last week

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:09.050
wrote a handwritten note to
each one of the Big Save winners

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:12.200
and congratulated every single
one of them on behalf of Ally.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:16.310
So a really cool way to,
again, be brave, disrupt,

00:27:16.310 --> 00:27:18.380
and do something
really different,

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.990
especially in the face of
a lot of people saying, why

00:27:20.990 --> 00:27:22.739
are you doing this,
and I don't think it's

00:27:22.739 --> 00:27:24.600
the right thing to do.

00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.702
I'm not to go through
all of this in detail,

00:27:26.702 --> 00:27:28.160
but I've been doing
a presentation,

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:34.110
and just part of it, when we
are together, in December.

00:27:34.110 --> 00:27:36.380
But these are the
kinds of things

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:39.140
that I think CMOs have
their eyes on right now,

00:27:39.140 --> 00:27:42.710
and these are the kinds of
things that keep us up at night

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:46.340
as we think about the best way
to come to market and marketing

00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:47.750
in this brave new world.

00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:51.470
I always say to my team,
marketing's changed more

00:27:51.470 --> 00:27:54.770
in the last five years than
it's changed in probably the 25

00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:57.260
years preceding
that, and we have

00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.020
to be on a constant
learning agenda.

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.950
I would say I probably spend 2/3
of my time doing my actual job,

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.150
and a third of my time
on this learning agenda.

00:28:07.150 --> 00:28:10.100
And it's really the reign of
digital disruption and the way

00:28:10.100 --> 00:28:12.410
that people are
interacting with brands

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:15.950
that has changed the way that
we have to behave as marketers.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:17.750
And you look at some
of these things--

00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:19.910
personalized
omnichannel experiences,

00:28:19.910 --> 00:28:22.490
this idea that people want
to be able to interact

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:25.580
with your brand regardless of
which device they come in on.

00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.550
You guys know that, but
for a lot of big brands

00:28:28.550 --> 00:28:30.280
that are in the
e-commerce space,

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.010
it's a really hard thing to
get right, this idea of speed

00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:37.970
is of the essence and how
impatient people have become.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:41.000
The attention span now
of the average consumer

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.170
is eight seconds.

00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.990
I read a statistic the other
day that was staggering,

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:49.250
that because of technology
and the ability technology

00:28:49.250 --> 00:28:52.700
has given us to multitask,
the average person

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:57.650
packs 34 hours of activity
into a 12-hour day.

00:28:57.650 --> 00:28:59.160
That's staggering.

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:01.997
So as marketers, how do we
get people's thumbs to stop?

00:29:01.997 --> 00:29:03.330
How do we get people to look up?

00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:05.780
How do we get people
to pay attention?

00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:10.070
Keeping customer attention,
not losing people, this idea

00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:11.750
of relevance versus cool--

00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:14.220
we argue about
this all the time.

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:16.040
What's more important--
to be a cool brand,

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.810
or to be a relevant brand?

00:29:17.810 --> 00:29:20.870
And our thought is relevant
because the definition of cool

00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:23.270
is changing all the time.

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:26.180
I think about this idea
that, with all this data

00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.210
like I talked about, with all
this reliance and everybody's

00:29:29.210 --> 00:29:30.770
first response
always being, well,

00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:34.600
that's a testable
proposition, brand matters.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:38.990
85% of people still say that
their purchases are driven

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:41.840
by an emotional connection,
and that they'll

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.330
spend more money to do
business with the brand

00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:46.860
that they have an
emotional connection with.

00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:51.450
So as a CMO, continuing to
drive that is really important.

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:53.670
And then the last one on
here, which is, I think,

00:29:53.670 --> 00:29:56.120
a new and emerging
one that takes

00:29:56.120 --> 00:30:00.860
an incredible amount of bravery
is this idea of taking a stand.

00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.990
It's really interesting,
in the political climate

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:06.830
that we're in right now,
people are personifying brands.

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:09.650
They expect us to have
an opinion on things,

00:30:09.650 --> 00:30:12.620
and it doesn't matter which side
of the fence that you're on.

00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:15.110
But with all the issues
that are emerging,

00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:17.810
with all of the movements
that are emerging,

00:30:17.810 --> 00:30:20.270
with a lot of the vitriol
that's being spewed

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.950
in the political
climate, people want

00:30:21.950 --> 00:30:24.110
to know where brands stand.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.720
And it's not OK to
be neutral anymore.

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:28.830
You can't take a pass.

00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:31.220
But how do you keep
your brand safe?

00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.970
When you're wearing two hats
like me, as marketing and PR,

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:37.370
how do I keep my
CO out of hot water

00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:39.770
when consumers want to
know where he personally

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:42.540
stands on gun safety?

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:44.390
How do we keep our
company safe when

00:30:44.390 --> 00:30:49.280
people want to know where we
stand on large societal issues?

00:30:49.280 --> 00:30:51.830
It's a really interesting
space that we've never

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.080
had to deal with before.

00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.740
Five years ago, people
didn't care what

00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:56.390
brands thought about stuff.

00:30:56.390 --> 00:30:58.340
Now, they won't do
business with you

00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:02.540
if you don't have an opinion
on things, so bravery, I think,

00:31:02.540 --> 00:31:05.510
is more important
than ever before.

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:08.330
And for me-- and I think
this is probably a good segue

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:10.650
into the questions--

00:31:10.650 --> 00:31:12.440
bravery's just
never been a choice.

00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:14.870
It's always been a way of life.

00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:18.560
I recently got remarried in
December, but prior to that,

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.930
I had been a single
mom for about 15 years,

00:31:20.930 --> 00:31:22.830
raising two boys.

00:31:22.830 --> 00:31:26.840
And how do you work
and raise two boys

00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:30.102
and have the bravery, when
you're in an important job,

00:31:30.102 --> 00:31:32.060
to stand up in the middle
of a meeting and say,

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:35.730
I've got to go to my son's
hockey game, and I'm leaving?

00:31:35.730 --> 00:31:38.580
I've always been a woman
in an industry full of men,

00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:41.750
whether it was automotive
or financial services.

00:31:41.750 --> 00:31:45.170
It was always me and all the
guys sitting around the table.

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:48.549
And it's just different
for a woman in business,

00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:51.090
and we'll probably talk a little
bit more about that as well.

00:31:51.090 --> 00:31:54.740
But having the bravery
to stay true to who I am

00:31:54.740 --> 00:31:56.420
and stay true to
what I believe in,

00:31:56.420 --> 00:32:00.830
but also being able to
interact in that setting

00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:03.020
and around those
tables, and then always

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:06.207
having big responsibility
at very young ages.

00:32:06.207 --> 00:32:07.790
A guy and I were
laughing a little bit

00:32:07.790 --> 00:32:09.727
before we came in
here, of maybe a lot

00:32:09.727 --> 00:32:11.810
of it is just people haven't
caught up with me yet

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:12.810
or figured it out.

00:32:12.810 --> 00:32:15.980
But I had my second son.

00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.680
I was, I think, 35 years old.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:20.180
I came back from
maternity leave.

00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.580
I had two kids under two years
old, and all of a sudden,

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:24.880
I was the account director
on the Chevrolet account

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:27.800
at Campbell Ewald, the
youngest person ever,

00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:31.370
the only woman in the '99
year history of the account.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:33.560
And I found myself
kind of thrust

00:32:33.560 --> 00:32:36.380
into a really interesting
space at a very young age.

00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.630
And how do you have that
credibility, and how

00:32:38.630 --> 00:32:40.880
do you maneuver through that?

00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.560
And for me, it just always
returned to that one thing,

00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:48.710
and it was that idea of
being brave and saying

00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:51.530
what was on my mind
and having a voice

00:32:51.530 --> 00:32:55.130
and not being afraid to
push on the issues that

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:59.240
were important to me and
not being afraid to say,

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:02.270
I am what I am, and if
people don't like it,

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:04.310
then I'm probably not
right in this culture,

00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:06.440
and I'm not right in this job.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:09.800
And knowing that you can't
operate in a world of fear,

00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:13.820
that you have to operate
from a position of strength,

00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:16.820
and I've always governed
myself by this saying that good

00:33:16.820 --> 00:33:18.860
is the enemy of great.

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.290
And I guess that's what I
want to leave you guys with,

00:33:21.290 --> 00:33:23.300
is always push for great.

00:33:23.300 --> 00:33:26.660
Bravery is that spine that
runs through all of it,

00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.530
but just remember, it's OK.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.290
You can always find another job.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:31.430
You're going to be OK.

00:33:31.430 --> 00:33:34.366
But at the end of the day,
when your career is over,

00:33:34.366 --> 00:33:35.990
you want to be able
to look at yourself

00:33:35.990 --> 00:33:39.290
and have integrity and know
that you did things the way

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:41.390
you wanted to do
things, and you always

00:33:41.390 --> 00:33:43.010
stayed true to who you were.

00:33:43.010 --> 00:33:45.950
So hopefully, you got,
out of the examples

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.770
and the things I talked
about, why it's so important.

00:33:48.770 --> 00:33:50.660
I think you're at
a perfect company

00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.430
to continue to
have this bravery,

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:56.300
to lead the charge in
the advancements of where

00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:59.660
this crazy reign of
digital disruption is going

00:33:59.660 --> 00:34:02.630
and to never forget
about staying

00:34:02.630 --> 00:34:06.237
true to what your culture
means and what it means to you

00:34:06.237 --> 00:34:07.070
and why you're here.

00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.300
So I thank you guys.

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:10.550
Despite all the technical
glitches, we got through it,

00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:11.850
and I appreciate your patience.

00:34:11.850 --> 00:34:12.350
Thank you.

00:34:18.547 --> 00:34:19.380
SPEAKER: Thank you--

00:34:19.380 --> 00:34:19.770
ANDREA BRIMMER: Thank you.

00:34:19.770 --> 00:34:21.561
SPEAKER: So much for
joining us and talking

00:34:21.561 --> 00:34:23.210
about what brave means to you.

00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:23.620
ANDREA BRIMMER: My pleasure.

00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:25.239
SPEAKER: I think one of
the biggest things that,

00:34:25.239 --> 00:34:27.040
as a company, that
we can take away

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:30.038
is the fact about
the golden gut.

00:34:30.038 --> 00:34:32.454
The golden gut-- I haven't
heard that used in a long time,

00:34:32.454 --> 00:34:35.380
but it's so true, that gut
feeling of what's really right

00:34:35.380 --> 00:34:37.690
versus wrong, rather than
always being about the data.

00:34:37.690 --> 00:34:40.690
As a big data company, I think
we get stuck with ourselves,

00:34:40.690 --> 00:34:44.500
with clients, a lot of
different audiences about it

00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.760
has to be data, data,
data, and we never use us.

00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:48.730
ANDREA BRIMMER: Yeah.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:50.800
SPEAKER: Can you
provide an example

00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:53.031
of when you had to really
go more with your gut

00:34:53.031 --> 00:34:54.489
than what the data
was telling you?

00:34:54.489 --> 00:34:56.340
ANDREA BRIMMER:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.950
I mean, that first campaign
that I showed you guys, truck

00:34:59.950 --> 00:35:06.910
and pony, the visceral reaction
from people was, it's mean.

00:35:06.910 --> 00:35:09.880
You're being mean
to the little kids.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:12.070
You shouldn't take
on the big banks.

00:35:12.070 --> 00:35:15.280
You're going to really
piss everybody off.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:17.860
Isn't there was softer
way to come into this?

00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:21.970
Why do you have to go out and
poke the bear, if you will?

00:35:21.970 --> 00:35:25.880
And it required
a lot of bravery.

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:28.120
It required us, as
a marketing team,

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.030
to unite and come together
and say, if you really

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:33.790
want to make impact, if you
really want to change things,

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:36.280
you've got to go this direction.

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.110
And I knew there was
a lot of risk in it.

00:35:38.110 --> 00:35:42.730
I mean, the reality was, if it
failed, I'd probably get fired.

00:35:42.730 --> 00:35:45.280
But it was OK because
we just felt like it

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:47.120
was the right thing to do.

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:51.220
And we pushed forward, and
honestly, to this day--

00:35:51.220 --> 00:35:54.910
it's 10 years later, and people
still talk about that campaign.

00:35:54.910 --> 00:35:56.210
It really defined us.

00:35:56.210 --> 00:35:57.830
It put us on the map.

00:35:57.830 --> 00:36:01.150
And last year was the 10
year anniversary of it,

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.010
and we actually
brought the little kids

00:36:03.010 --> 00:36:06.610
back now, 10 years later,
and with the launch

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.650
of the Do-It-Right campaign,
we said, all right,

00:36:08.650 --> 00:36:10.420
we played a mean trick
on you at the time.

00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:12.420
And now, we're going to
do things the right way,

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.130
and so we gave that
little girl a pony.

00:36:16.130 --> 00:36:19.600
We gave her a real pony, and we
brought the monster truck kid

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.230
back.

00:36:20.230 --> 00:36:23.320
And we-- actually
we blindfolded him,

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:27.850
and we had him in a giant
arena, kind of like Ford Field.

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.370
And when we took
the blindfold off

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:31.900
there was all these
monster trucks,

00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:34.180
and we let him tear it up
in a bunch of monster trucks

00:36:34.180 --> 00:36:37.240
for the afternoon, so
it's just a cool way

00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:38.630
to bring it full circle.

00:36:38.630 --> 00:36:40.570
SPEAKER: So with your teams,
though, and that golden gut,

00:36:40.570 --> 00:36:41.830
do you have-- how
do you keep them

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:43.954
engaged on that, knowing
that the numbers are going

00:36:43.954 --> 00:36:44.488
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:36:47.490 --> 00:36:49.690
ANDREA BRIMMER: One, and
you'll find this odd,

00:36:49.690 --> 00:36:51.700
but we don't pretest anything.

00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.634
So I don't pretest any creative.

00:36:53.634 --> 00:36:54.550
I don't believe in it.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:56.320
Now, thankfully,
I have a CEO that

00:36:56.320 --> 00:37:00.560
doesn't want to see pre-testing
and isn't really focused on it.

00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:02.710
But there's a lot of
times where he'll say,

00:37:02.710 --> 00:37:04.340
I don't think
that's a good spot,

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:06.190
and I don't think
we should do it.

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:07.960
But I trust your
opinion, and if you

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.600
want to go ahead and do it--
and I think my team sees that.

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.540
And I really think you
have to walk the walk

00:37:13.540 --> 00:37:14.320
and talk the talk.

00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.570
You can't talk
about being brave.

00:37:16.570 --> 00:37:18.670
You can't talk about
doing things differently.

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:21.610
You can't talk about taking
risks unless you personally

00:37:21.610 --> 00:37:24.370
take them, and I
think my team sees

00:37:24.370 --> 00:37:27.760
me take them every single week.

00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:30.220
Great example-- we're doing
agency reviews right now.

00:37:30.220 --> 00:37:34.150
We put all our business up for
review, and I was with our CEO

00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:36.670
last week in front of a
bunch of people from my team.

00:37:36.670 --> 00:37:38.890
And he said, well,
why don't I fly out,

00:37:38.890 --> 00:37:41.260
and I'll meet with some of
these agencies with you?

00:37:41.260 --> 00:37:43.420
And I'll bring
Jen, who's our CFO.

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:44.740
And I said, no.

00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:45.491
He was like, what?

00:37:45.491 --> 00:37:47.115
I mean, this was in
front of everybody.

00:37:47.115 --> 00:37:48.940
I said, I'm not going
to these agencies

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:50.260
with our CEO and the CFO.

00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:52.385
They're never going to want
to do business with us.

00:37:52.385 --> 00:37:54.850
And he's like, OK, fair enough.

00:37:54.850 --> 00:37:57.880
You have to show your team
that you're brave enough,

00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.410
and you've got the
passion, and then

00:37:59.410 --> 00:38:00.645
I think people will follow.

00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:02.380
SPEAKER: Well, I
think that fits really

00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.170
good into my next
question about presence

00:38:05.170 --> 00:38:09.430
and your ability just to be so
down to earth and so authentic.

00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:10.810
It just draws people to you.

00:38:10.810 --> 00:38:12.740
I mean, as you move
up in your career

00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:14.770
and now are sitting
in the C-Suite,

00:38:14.770 --> 00:38:16.372
it can be intimidating
for others.

00:38:16.372 --> 00:38:18.580
But when I'm with you and
presented with you in front

00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:22.130
of a bunch of
dealers, mind you, it

00:38:22.130 --> 00:38:24.250
was like talking to
your best friend.

00:38:24.250 --> 00:38:26.380
So I just would love
to hear about how you--

00:38:26.380 --> 00:38:28.379
I mean, you've spoke about
it a little bit here,

00:38:28.379 --> 00:38:30.050
but how you maintain
that and what-- why

00:38:30.050 --> 00:38:31.300
that it's so important to you.

00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.940
ANDREA BRIMMER: Well,
thank you, first of all.

00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:36.490
I have a lot of sayings, but
another favorite saying of mine

00:38:36.490 --> 00:38:38.900
is never drink
your own Kool-Aid.

00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.990
And I hate-- as I grew up
in the agency business,

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:44.590
and I think a lot of you guys
probably have seen the same

00:38:44.590 --> 00:38:45.790
thing--

00:38:45.790 --> 00:38:48.340
as people get in
bigger and bigger jobs,

00:38:48.340 --> 00:38:49.990
they become more
and more precious.

00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:54.580
It's like our old CEO didn't
want any potato chips that

00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:57.780
were brown, so his admin used
to pluck out the burnt potato

00:38:57.780 --> 00:38:58.280
chips.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:00.110
And I'm like, are
you kidding me?

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:01.610
And I've always
thought to myself,

00:39:01.610 --> 00:39:04.160
if I ever get like that,
somebody please shoot me.

00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:06.950
I never want to be that person.

00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:10.300
So I've all-- and I also
know that a job can be over

00:39:10.300 --> 00:39:12.540
like this, especially
in the C-Suite.

00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:15.590
You look at things like
average tenure of a CMO--

00:39:15.590 --> 00:39:17.570
18 months-- and you know.

00:39:17.570 --> 00:39:19.850
You get a new CEO, or
you get a board member,

00:39:19.850 --> 00:39:22.370
or you do something
and-- or the KPIs

00:39:22.370 --> 00:39:24.830
aren't going in the right
direction, and you're out.

00:39:24.830 --> 00:39:29.990
And so my belief is, if I
take myself too seriously,

00:39:29.990 --> 00:39:33.860
and if I put off that
I'm a CMO, so I'm

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:37.430
better than everybody air,
nobody wants to be around me.

00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:39.380
And who wants to be
around people like that?

00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:41.810
It isn't very fun, and
it's not fun for me

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:45.350
either because I learn
from the people on my team

00:39:45.350 --> 00:39:46.260
every single day.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:48.720
And if they're intimidated
by being around me,

00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.890
that's a bad place to be.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.040
So I've always kind
of stayed true to that

00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:53.750
never drink your own Kool-Aid.

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:56.900
Never let a job or
a career define you.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.960
When I decide to
hang it up, I want

00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:02.390
to be defined by
the kind of leader

00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:05.360
I was, the kind of person I
was, the legacy that I left

00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:08.590
on advertising and marketing,
and I want people to say,

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:09.794
she was a really cool chick.

00:40:09.794 --> 00:40:11.960
I don't want them to say,
she was an arrogant idiot.

00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:13.490
SPEAKER: I would
agree [INAUDIBLE]..

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.569
ANDREA BRIMMER: Thank you.

00:40:15.569 --> 00:40:17.860
SPEAKER: To, and speaking a
little bit to the last line

00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:19.359
that you shared, I
mean, it's really

00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:21.160
been amazing how
transparent you are

00:40:21.160 --> 00:40:25.670
about who you were as a
mom, and raising these boys.

00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:30.800
How would you say you
maintained that relationship

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:33.820
with your boys as they grew
and also this role so far?

00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:36.650
ANDREA BRIMMER: Yeah,
everybody talks about balance.

00:40:36.650 --> 00:40:39.134
Whoever came up with
the word imbalance,

00:40:39.134 --> 00:40:41.300
I don't care if you're a
man or a woman in business,

00:40:41.300 --> 00:40:42.470
there's no balance.

00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:46.952
It's just-- it's ridiculous,
and it's fairy tale land

00:40:46.952 --> 00:40:48.410
to believe that
you can achieve it.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:53.780
And so for me, my thought
was always, I'm going to be--

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.000
I'm going to make
what I do matter.

00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.670
And I have a platform where I
can make my sons into really

00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:05.960
good men, and I can
give them experiences

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:09.570
that they could never get
if I didn't have this job.

00:41:09.570 --> 00:41:12.380
And so a lot of what I
did is, first of all,

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.790
I picked the things that were
really important to them,

00:41:14.790 --> 00:41:16.440
and I never missed those things.

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.350
So I think a good
example is when

00:41:18.350 --> 00:41:20.810
my son was a senior
in high school,

00:41:20.810 --> 00:41:22.970
he was on the
varsity hockey team,

00:41:22.970 --> 00:41:25.390
and it was really important
to him that I was there,

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.200
and I travel a ton.

00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:29.910
And I made a commitment to him
at the beginning of the season,

00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:32.390
and I said, I'm not going
to miss any of your games.

00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:36.230
And no matter what I had to do,
I made it to every single game.

00:41:36.230 --> 00:41:38.570
Now, if any of you guys
are hockey parents,

00:41:38.570 --> 00:41:41.360
you know you're
talking 60 games,

00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:44.066
and I just established
that with my boss.

00:41:44.066 --> 00:41:46.190
And I said, I'm not going
to miss any of his games.

00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:48.820
So I'd literally be
on a three day trip,

00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:51.920
and if he had a game on Tuesday,
I'd leave on Tuesday afternoon.

00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:55.040
I'd fly to the game, and I'd
fly back either that night

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.786
or early the next morning.

00:41:56.786 --> 00:41:58.160
The other thing
that I always did

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.080
is I brought my boys as
much as I could with me.

00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.830
So when I traveled, I
brought them with me,

00:42:03.830 --> 00:42:06.020
and they got to
see me in action.

00:42:06.020 --> 00:42:07.490
I'd bring them to
things like this.

00:42:07.490 --> 00:42:08.240
I still do.

00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:11.840
I'd bring them to
interact with dealers.

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.680
They were always my
date for everything.

00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:17.270
I was single, so it
was my two boys and me.

00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:20.519
And they learned about
being in big cities.

00:42:20.519 --> 00:42:22.310
They learned about
getting around airports.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:25.700
They-- you can drop either
one of them in any situation,

00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:28.370
and they're not
intimidated by it.

00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:30.410
And then the time that
I was home with them,

00:42:30.410 --> 00:42:33.060
I just was really
present in the moment.

00:42:33.060 --> 00:42:34.100
My phone was down.

00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:35.720
I wasn't on my computer.

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.950
And the time that
we had was for us,

00:42:37.950 --> 00:42:42.010
and today, we have the
closest relationship.

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:43.670
And I've got two
stepkids now, and I'm

00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:44.960
trying to do the
same thing with them

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:46.370
and just give them
an opportunity

00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:48.210
to see the world
through my lens.

00:42:48.210 --> 00:42:49.460
SPEAKER: That's super helpful.

00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.630
Even for me, as my kids
are starting into school,

00:42:51.630 --> 00:42:53.880
I used to try to be at
everything, and you just can't.

00:42:53.880 --> 00:42:56.479
So really finding out what they
want you at or need you at--

00:42:56.479 --> 00:42:58.520
ANDREA BRIMMER: You got
to give yourself a break.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:03.110
I'll tell you-- women
have horrible guilt,

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.090
but I think this advice
goes for men or women.

00:43:05.090 --> 00:43:06.450
Let yourself off the hook.

00:43:06.450 --> 00:43:07.640
It's OK.

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.354
Do you think that, now
that my son's 21 years old,

00:43:10.354 --> 00:43:12.770
he's ever going to remember
that I didn't go to one parent

00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:14.180
teacher conference?

00:43:14.180 --> 00:43:15.110
I didn't.

00:43:15.110 --> 00:43:16.670
He doesn't talk about that.

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:19.100
When he's around his
friends, he talks about,

00:43:19.100 --> 00:43:21.471
my mom's got this awesome
job, and she's a CMO,

00:43:21.471 --> 00:43:22.970
and she's done this,
this, and this.

00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:26.000
That's what he talks about,
and he talks about the things

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.120
that we've done together.

00:43:27.120 --> 00:43:29.100
He doesn't talk about
those kinds of things.

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:31.089
So give yourself a break.

00:43:31.089 --> 00:43:32.630
Be where you need
to be when you need

00:43:32.630 --> 00:43:36.347
to be there, but a lot of that
stuff, don't worry about it.

00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:37.680
They're never going to remember.

00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:38.480
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:43:38.480 --> 00:43:38.930
ANDREA BRIMMER: Of course.

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:40.554
SPEAKER: One more
question before we'll

00:43:40.554 --> 00:43:43.746
turn to the audience, about
Detroit, specifically.

00:43:43.746 --> 00:43:45.620
So we know Ally has one
of the big buildings.

00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:50.442
We see your big purple Ally
sign up on the Crown building.

00:43:50.442 --> 00:43:51.650
We're coming down there, too.

00:43:51.650 --> 00:43:53.240
ANDREA BRIMMER: I'm excited
to have you guys down there.

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:54.260
SPEAKER: Very soon.

00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:55.677
And anything-- you
were mentioning

00:43:55.677 --> 00:43:57.093
how much you love
being down there

00:43:57.093 --> 00:43:59.420
even though you drive a very
long way to be down there.

00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.712
But can you just give us some
things to look forward to

00:44:01.712 --> 00:44:03.628
or things that you really
love about the city?

00:44:03.628 --> 00:44:06.500
ANDREA BRIMMER: Yeah, so we were
one of the first big companies

00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:09.140
to move back-- or to
move everybody downtown.

00:44:09.140 --> 00:44:10.894
We had half of our
employees were there,

00:44:10.894 --> 00:44:13.310
and then we had some people
in Southfield and Auburn Hills

00:44:13.310 --> 00:44:15.450
and spread out all
over the place.

00:44:15.450 --> 00:44:19.170
And we had announced that
we were going to actually

00:44:19.170 --> 00:44:21.900
be moving out of the city,
and Mayor Duggan came to us

00:44:21.900 --> 00:44:25.650
and said, give me two weeks to
put a plan together to keep you

00:44:25.650 --> 00:44:27.630
guys in the city of Detroit.

00:44:27.630 --> 00:44:31.060
And he called Dan Gilbert
and said, buy a building.

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:34.440
We need to keep them down here,
and he bought that building.

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:38.460
And we rebranded
it to Ally Center,

00:44:38.460 --> 00:44:39.930
and we did something
really cool.

00:44:39.930 --> 00:44:41.580
I actually got to do
the design working

00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:43.620
with the architects
and the design firm,

00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:45.930
and we gutted 15 floors.

00:44:45.930 --> 00:44:48.270
And we designed every floor
like a different Detroit

00:44:48.270 --> 00:44:53.220
neighborhood, so every one is
an homage to a different Detroit

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.040
neighborhood, and it's
a really cool way--

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.740
we sourced all the materials
from those neighborhoods.

00:44:58.740 --> 00:45:03.010
So for instance, Cork Town,
all the wood on the floor

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:05.700
is from trees that had
fallen in Cork Town.

00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.280
And we've got the stories
of those neighborhoods

00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:09.870
on each one of the floors.

00:45:09.870 --> 00:45:12.510
So we've got big murals with
the story of each one of those

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:15.750
neighborhoods, and it's a
great way to teach the next

00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:19.110
generation about the city
because I grew up going

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:22.074
downtown all the time, but my
kids didn't, and I'm sure a lot

00:45:22.074 --> 00:45:23.490
of the people in
this room didn't.

00:45:23.490 --> 00:45:26.610
And it's getting people to fall
in love with the city again.

00:45:26.610 --> 00:45:28.800
It's awesome being down there.

00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:32.280
We pride ourselves on being one
of Detroit's favorite children.

00:45:32.280 --> 00:45:35.730
We believe really strongly
in supporting everything

00:45:35.730 --> 00:45:38.950
that's important to the city, so
whether it's the 4th of July--

00:45:38.950 --> 00:45:41.730
the fireworks and
sponsoring those,

00:45:41.730 --> 00:45:44.400
sponsoring things
with the Red Wings

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:49.200
and the Tigers and the
Lions, being really active

00:45:49.200 --> 00:45:52.980
in charities and giving
back to the city,

00:45:52.980 --> 00:45:54.240
having people volunteer.

00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:56.320
And we've just really
immersed ourselves.

00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.110
So I would tell you guys--

00:45:58.110 --> 00:46:00.450
get out, have fun,
especially in the summer.

00:46:00.450 --> 00:46:04.170
There's so many awesome
restaurants down there now.

00:46:04.170 --> 00:46:04.832
Stay late.

00:46:04.832 --> 00:46:06.540
Have a good time while
you're down there,

00:46:06.540 --> 00:46:09.390
and throw yourself into
everything that's going on.

00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:12.870
The vibe down there is so
creative and so awesome

00:46:12.870 --> 00:46:15.810
right now that it's just
really, really inspiring

00:46:15.810 --> 00:46:16.470
to be downtown.

00:46:16.470 --> 00:46:18.030
I wouldn't want to
be anyplace else.

00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:19.692
And wear your Detroit pride.

00:46:19.692 --> 00:46:21.900
I actually got the old
English D tattooed on my back.

00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:22.399
So--

00:46:22.399 --> 00:46:23.382
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:23.382 --> 00:46:24.840
ANDREA BRIMMER: I
had to represent.

00:46:24.840 --> 00:46:26.289
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:46:26.289 --> 00:46:28.462
Well, now we're going
to turn to the audience

00:46:28.462 --> 00:46:29.670
for any additional questions.

00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:33.534
Anybody have any
questions to ask Andrea?

00:46:33.534 --> 00:46:36.386
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:46:36.386 --> 00:46:37.260
AUDIENCE: Hi, Andrea.

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:40.080
A lot of us actually got
our start on the agency side

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:42.060
as well, too, so
when you mentioned

00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.960
that you were in that big
role at 35 at Campbell Ewald--

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:47.440
not that I was
ever in a big role.

00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:48.150
I was no one.

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:51.280
But I did also start on
the creative agency side,

00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:53.700
so I'm wondering, what
do you think now--

00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.920
as a CMO who's
being brave, taking

00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.310
a lot of really cool disruptive
marketing challenges-- what

00:46:59.310 --> 00:47:01.690
do you think, from that
time on the agency side,

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:05.670
prepped you best and makes you
competitive and a great weapon?

00:47:05.670 --> 00:47:07.920
ANDREA BRIMMER: No, it's
a-- that's a great question.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.795
And I'm sure you were
somebody at the agency,

00:47:09.795 --> 00:47:11.970
so don't sell yourself short.

00:47:11.970 --> 00:47:14.610
So first and foremost,
I think that what

00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:18.330
I learned on the agency side
is just about creativity,

00:47:18.330 --> 00:47:22.170
and I know how to get great
creativity out of an agency.

00:47:22.170 --> 00:47:24.630
That's a really
important attribute

00:47:24.630 --> 00:47:26.130
because you guys
know, especially

00:47:26.130 --> 00:47:30.360
in the creative world, clients
saw off all the sharp edges.

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:32.400
You get a really cool
idea, and by the time

00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.275
it's done going through
the spanking machine,

00:47:34.275 --> 00:47:36.580
it sucks when it comes
out the other end.

00:47:36.580 --> 00:47:43.220
And so I'm very, very protective
of the creative process.

00:47:43.220 --> 00:47:46.950
I really-- while I try and bring
our business partners along,

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:49.840
I try and really shield
the creative process,

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:52.080
and I think that
agencies feed off

00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.870
of that protection
and that agency.

00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:57.630
I think the second thing is the
golden gut that I talked about.

00:47:57.630 --> 00:48:01.620
I know when I see
potential in an idea.

00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.500
And you guys remember from your
agency days-- an idea's not

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:07.170
always perfect the
first time, but you know

00:48:07.170 --> 00:48:09.090
when there's something there.

00:48:09.090 --> 00:48:11.850
And a lot of clients that
just grew up on the client

00:48:11.850 --> 00:48:13.860
side the whole time,
they either test it,

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:16.570
and it dies, or they
can't see the potential.

00:48:16.570 --> 00:48:20.460
They don't know how to keep
moving it along and making

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.830
it better and making it
into something more powerful

00:48:22.830 --> 00:48:24.840
than it was when it started.

00:48:24.840 --> 00:48:27.510
And then I think
third, just the ability

00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:31.150
to stand up and present
and have a presence.

00:48:31.150 --> 00:48:34.860
And you underestimate how
important that is in business,

00:48:34.860 --> 00:48:37.890
but when you're standing
in front of a board,

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:41.370
and you need to be
able to deliver,

00:48:41.370 --> 00:48:43.260
really powerfully,
a point of view

00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:46.890
around something that's
potentially controversial.

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:49.100
Or when your boss
says you're going

00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:51.780
to present at investor
day, and you're in a room,

00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:54.840
and you're in
front of 500 people

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:57.450
that are thinking about
investing in your company,

00:48:57.450 --> 00:49:00.480
and what you say could
affect your stock price

00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:02.310
and the way that your
company goes forward.

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:04.620
If you-- and
everything in between.

00:49:04.620 --> 00:49:06.750
If you don't have
that ability to have

00:49:06.750 --> 00:49:09.930
that presence and those
presentation skills,

00:49:09.930 --> 00:49:11.130
it's a really tough road.

00:49:11.130 --> 00:49:13.590
So those things were
really important to me.

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:17.114
I really took those
from my agency time.

00:49:17.114 --> 00:49:17.780
Yeah, go for it.

00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:18.890
Nothing's off bounds.

00:49:18.890 --> 00:49:21.720
I'll tell you anything
you want to know.

00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.540
AUDIENCE: Check.

00:49:23.540 --> 00:49:26.840
So Andrea, Mike Orlando again.

00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:28.580
Thank you again for coming in.

00:49:28.580 --> 00:49:33.590
I feel like Ally's one of the
undervalued stories of Detroit.

00:49:33.590 --> 00:49:35.750
Can you talk a little
bit about culture,

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:38.320
what you guys are doing
within the walls of Ally, what

00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:41.152
your CEO's core objectives are?

00:49:41.152 --> 00:49:43.610
ANDREA BRIMMER: Yeah, that's
a great question, and I agree.

00:49:43.610 --> 00:49:44.930
I mean, part of our--

00:49:44.930 --> 00:49:47.540
it's funny to think that 10
years has been a long time.

00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:49.550
But it's not for a
brand, and it's not

00:49:49.550 --> 00:49:52.280
for a brand that doesn't
spend like the brands spend

00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:53.130
in the category.

00:49:53.130 --> 00:49:56.660
So just our ability to
just grow sheer awareness

00:49:56.660 --> 00:49:59.870
and get the story out
there has been tough,

00:49:59.870 --> 00:50:02.190
and honestly, a big part
of it was because we

00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:03.650
were so reactive in PR.

00:50:03.650 --> 00:50:07.520
And when I took on PR
responsibility last year,

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.580
we said we're going to
really go out and start

00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:13.640
to be really proactive,
and that's helped us a lot.

00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:16.130
The company is an
amazing company.

00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:18.480
Our CEO is 44 years old.

00:50:18.480 --> 00:50:24.890
He is one of the five youngest
CEOs in the Fortune 500.

00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:27.980
He believes very
strongly in culture.

00:50:27.980 --> 00:50:30.620
When he goes out and
talks to investors,

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:33.470
and they say what is
going to separate you

00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:36.080
from all of the other players
in the financial services

00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.590
category, his first
answer is always culture.

00:50:39.590 --> 00:50:41.240
And a lot of investors
are like, wow,

00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:43.370
no one ever talks about culture.

00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:46.670
And he believes very strongly
in a number of things.

00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:48.890
He believes, first, I
think, and foremost,

00:50:48.890 --> 00:50:50.400
in diversity and inclusion.

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.700
And I know that's a really
popular thing to say,

00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:54.570
but it's a harder thing to do.

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:58.160
If you look at our C-Suite
and our executive council,

00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:03.470
out of probably 18 people
on our executive council,

00:51:03.470 --> 00:51:06.980
we have at least eight
women in C-Suite positions--

00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:08.720
our chief human
resources officer,

00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:13.670
our chief financial officer, the
president of our bank, myself.

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:14.890
The list goes on and on.

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:18.860
In fact, our CFO is
the only female CFO

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:22.910
in the entire banking
industry, which is staggering.

00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:25.320
He's established
employee resource groups.

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:28.430
So we have 15 different
employee resource groups,

00:51:28.430 --> 00:51:32.180
and you can join the employee
resource group that you either

00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:35.120
identify with, or the
employee resource group

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.800
that you want to learn about.

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:41.330
And that's been an awesome
way investing budget and time

00:51:41.330 --> 00:51:43.430
for people to do that.

00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:46.370
He believes very strongly
in being purpose driven,

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:50.000
and we give everybody time.

00:51:50.000 --> 00:51:53.440
We call it PTO time to--

00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:55.850
or VTO time where they
can volunteer and do

00:51:55.850 --> 00:51:57.680
things that are
important to them

00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:59.060
and being a part
of the community

00:51:59.060 --> 00:52:00.476
and doing things
really different.

00:52:00.476 --> 00:52:03.590
So this month happens to be
financial literacy month,

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:05.300
and we did something
really cool for that

00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:07.730
where, instead of
just writing a check,

00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:10.100
we actually wrote a
children's book called

00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:12.170
"Planet Z and the Money Tree."

00:52:12.170 --> 00:52:14.990
And it teaches kids
about money and the fact

00:52:14.990 --> 00:52:17.070
that it doesn't grow on trees.

00:52:17.070 --> 00:52:20.390
And we have all of our
employees going into schools

00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:23.480
and doing readings of "Planet
Z and the Money Tree."

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:25.730
And if you go on--

00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:27.530
if you go on any of
our social pages,

00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:29.810
you'll be able to
either download a copy,

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:33.840
and then we're donating hard
copies to schools as well.

00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.330
And then the other
big thing that I

00:52:35.330 --> 00:52:38.270
would say with him is
he's not a micromanager,

00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:39.710
and nobody at Ally is.

00:52:39.710 --> 00:52:43.280
And we let people soar
their wings and go.

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.190
We have a culture of innovation.

00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:46.900
We're digital
financial services,

00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:49.090
so we have to stay
on the leading edge--

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:51.590
maybe not always the bleeding
edge, but on the leading edge.

00:52:51.590 --> 00:52:54.710
And you have to create
a culture of innovation,

00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:58.000
and you have to, a, invest
in that even though everybody

00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:00.410
is always talking about
how do I cut expenses.

00:53:00.410 --> 00:53:03.530
So he's very good about
invest, invest, invest.

00:53:03.530 --> 00:53:07.190
And two, he's not
afraid to let us fail.

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:11.660
So you can take reasonable
risks, and if you fail,

00:53:11.660 --> 00:53:13.610
it's a good thing to learn from.

00:53:13.610 --> 00:53:15.560
And there's no punishment
on the other end.

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:17.330
You don't lose your job.

00:53:17.330 --> 00:53:19.730
You don't get a
slap on the wrists.

00:53:19.730 --> 00:53:22.550
Even little things like
putting that Motley Crue

00:53:22.550 --> 00:53:25.370
music on the spot-- like I said,
our board was really nervous

00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:28.130
about it, and he was like, if
you want to do it, you do it.

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:29.420
You're the CMO.

00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.980
Good or bad, it's on
you, and I support you.

00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.760
So I think those are the things
that are happening at Ally.

00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:37.500
It's an awesome company.

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.290
Weird going through
these agency pitches

00:53:39.290 --> 00:53:40.370
right now as I mentioned.

00:53:40.370 --> 00:53:42.470
For me, I think the next
big thing I want to do

00:53:42.470 --> 00:53:44.960
is just create this
awakening around how

00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:48.934
great the company is, how
differentiated our product is,

00:53:48.934 --> 00:53:51.350
and just get people to pay
attention to their money again.

00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:53.110
And that's what we're
really trying to do.

00:53:53.110 --> 00:53:53.943
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:53:53.943 --> 00:53:55.510
ANDREA BRIMMER: Yep.

00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:56.950
SPEAKER: Anyone else?

00:54:01.270 --> 00:54:02.610
ANDREA BRIMMER: All right.

00:54:02.610 --> 00:54:03.150
SPEAKER: Thank
you again, Andrea.

00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:04.483
ANDREA BRIMMER: Thank you, guys.

00:54:04.483 --> 00:54:05.990
Thanks for having me.
