00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:15.190
So prisons in America specifically are some
of the biggest, most dysfunctional businesses

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.580
we have in our society, and they are a business
because of the cheap and free labor.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:29.609
When you read the 13th Amendment—that basically
was the amendment that broke through slavery

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.770
and freed the men and women who were enslaved
at the time—there is a clause in there that

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:40.230
allows for the re-enslavement of people in
the event that they’re convicted of a crime.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.230
And so in prisons throughout our country,
you have people who are working for basically

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.239
free, and if they’re not working for free
they’re working for wages that, if we saw

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.270
that happening in another country, we would
be very critical of.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.471
When I was in prison I worked for $0.17 an
hour; that was my starting rate working in

00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:01.580
the kitchen.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:06.350
But there are also big corporations who invest
in prison labor because they can get this

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.240
labor for $1.50 an hour.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.990
The sad part about it is that, in turn, they
don’t even hire these men and women when

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.250
they’re actually released from prison.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.970
Everything in prison has inflated costs.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:28.130
It costs us—inside prison, when I was inside—anywhere
between $3 and $15 for a 15-minute phone call.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.810
We don’t have to pay that out here in free
society.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.690
There is a way that we can send emails to
men and women inside prison, and it cost five

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.460
cents every time we send that, whereas out
here in society we can send emails without

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.900
any charge.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.570
And so there are so many ways that the prison
is exploited: the cheap labor, the cost of

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.880
services and goods, and it’s a model that,
sadly and unfortunately, has affected a large

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.990
segment of our society.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:05.090
I think most people aren’t aware of why
the business models of prison exist, because

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.010
most of our society has been left clueless
in regards to how our judicial system works.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.820
And it’s largely been through the effect
of campaigns that politicians have run for

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:21.080
years, this whole idea that one of the greatest
fears you should have is crime in America.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.510
When you’re operating out of a space of
fear you’re not thinking clearly, so you’re

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.730
not willing to examine things that are right
in front of us.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.430
And so the way that the prison system has
developed and evolved over the years, is it

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:42.901
originally started as government-run, state-run
institutions, and then people started seeing

00:02:42.901 --> 00:02:47.970
investment opportunities when the states and
couldn’t keep up with the budgetary cost

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.629
of incarcerating so many people.

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.470
We currently have over two million men and
women incarcerated throughout the country,

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.989
and we represent five percent of the world
population, yet we incarcerate 25 percent

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.790
of the world’s incarcerated people.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.660
And so, at some point, states could no longer
keep up with those budgets, private investors

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.150
moved in and seized an opportunity, and then
they started structuring laws in a way that

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.670
ensured that people continue to be incarcerated
for the most frivolous things.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:26.200
Like, 40 years ago we didn’t have as many
laws on the books that we have now, and when

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:34.350
you look at how the war on drugs itself impacted
incarceration rates, if you follow that pathway

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.130
you’ll see how people seized on that opportunity
and began to invest in private businesses.
