18,000 species live together and we now

18,000 species live together and we now

so on we're just beginning to understand

00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840
so on we're just beginning to understand
 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.040
so on we're just beginning to understand
how the natural world works and a large

00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:18.050
how the natural world works and a large
 

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:21.520
how the natural world works and a large
part of it is that it lives in another

part of it is that it lives in another
 

00:07:21.530 --> 00:07:23.410
part of it is that it lives in another
world from the one we do it's a

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:23.420
