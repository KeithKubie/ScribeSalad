00:00:00.965 --> 00:00:01.798
(mouse clicking)

00:00:01.798 --> 00:00:04.548
(jingly beeping)

00:00:05.717 --> 00:00:08.300
(bright music)

00:00:21.888 --> 00:00:24.504
- Increasing evidence suggests
that normal brain development

00:00:24.504 --> 00:00:28.101
is impaired in schizophrenia
and other neuropsychiatric

00:00:28.101 --> 00:00:30.793
disorders long before
the onset of symptoms.

00:00:30.793 --> 00:00:34.575
So emerging genetics and
other data intriguingly

00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:37.135
have been implicating immune molecules

00:00:37.135 --> 00:00:38.392
and immune related pathways,

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:41.517
raising many questions about
the underlying biology.

00:00:41.517 --> 00:00:44.435
So we recently discovered
an unexpected role

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:47.831
for our resident immune
cell called microglia

00:00:47.831 --> 00:00:50.499
in this sculpting process,
this pruning process.

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:52.841
And so today I'd like to tell
you about what we've learned

00:00:52.841 --> 00:00:56.438
about how it is that these cells
know which synapse to prune

00:00:56.438 --> 00:00:58.793
and which synapses perhaps not to prune

00:00:58.793 --> 00:01:01.533
and how our work using
mouse models are providing

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:04.644
new biological insight
into this pruning pathway

00:01:04.644 --> 00:01:07.403
and how this might go
awry in schizophrenia

00:01:07.403 --> 00:01:09.909
and other neurodevelopmental disorders.

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:11.763
Neural circuits undergo tremendous

00:01:11.763 --> 00:01:13.491
remodeling during development.

00:01:13.491 --> 00:01:16.082
We start out with an excess
of synaptic connections

00:01:16.082 --> 00:01:18.857
that are maintained in the mature brain

00:01:18.857 --> 00:01:20.346
and through a developmental process

00:01:20.346 --> 00:01:22.390
called pruning or synapse elimination.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.017
Many of these extra synaptic
connections are permanently

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:27.666
removed while others get
strengthened and maintained.

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:29.787
This concept of use it or lose it.

00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:31.463
So this process is of course regulated by

00:01:31.463 --> 00:01:35.975
and modulated by experience
and this process,

00:01:35.975 --> 00:01:39.230
refinement process, is
necessary for developmental

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.324
and the precise wiring
of synapses in the brain.

00:01:42.324 --> 00:01:44.393
And disruptions in the process of pruning

00:01:44.393 --> 00:01:45.932
are thought to underlie neurodevelopmental

00:01:45.932 --> 00:01:48.107
and neuropsychiatric disorders.

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:50.176
Now interestingly, there are
different critical periods

00:01:50.176 --> 00:01:52.242
of pruning that happen in
different parts of the brain,

00:01:52.242 --> 00:01:54.655
and as you heard earlier
today, interestingly,

00:01:54.655 --> 00:01:56.386
parts of the brain like frontal cortex

00:01:56.386 --> 00:01:58.453
are the last area of the brains to prune.

00:01:58.453 --> 00:02:00.344
So the big question of course is what

00:02:00.344 --> 00:02:02.159
regulates this pruning process?

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.444
So a major question in the field,

00:02:04.444 --> 00:02:06.768
and one that my lab has been
intensely interested in,

00:02:06.768 --> 00:02:09.272
is understanding how it
is that specific synapses

00:02:09.272 --> 00:02:10.814
are eliminated during development.

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:12.976
If we can understand
the mechanisms by which

00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:15.711
specific synapses get
pruned, or vulnerable,

00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:17.296
this might provide new insight,

00:02:17.296 --> 00:02:18.825
and even therapeutic insight,

00:02:18.825 --> 00:02:21.704
into how these synapses
get lost in disease.

00:02:21.704 --> 00:02:23.722
So it's well established,
as you've heard today,

00:02:23.722 --> 00:02:25.930
that neuronal activity
plays a critical role

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.774
in refining synapses and
synaptic connections.

00:02:28.774 --> 00:02:31.710
So we know for example
that activity sets up

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.572
a local competition, so if
you look at this cartoon here,

00:02:34.572 --> 00:02:37.741
you can see this neuron
is innervated by inputs,

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:40.307
these left and right eye inputs,
if you were to for example,

00:02:40.307 --> 00:02:42.345
label these inputs with a visual system.

00:02:42.345 --> 00:02:43.837
But over the course of development,

00:02:43.837 --> 00:02:46.654
you can see that this neuron,
that some of these inputs,

00:02:46.654 --> 00:02:48.933
in this case the blue ones,
get permanently removed

00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:51.592
while the red ones get
strengthened and maintained.

00:02:51.592 --> 00:02:53.214
So what is the question mark that

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:55.375
we're interested in is
understanding what are the molecules

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.229
that link change in activity,

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:59.174
that with a physical elimination of

00:02:59.174 --> 00:03:01.044
the blue input but not the red one.

00:03:01.044 --> 00:03:02.741
So much of the field of course

00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:04.322
is focused on the neurons themselves,

00:03:04.322 --> 00:03:05.851
these are in fact cells that get pruned.

00:03:05.851 --> 00:03:07.656
But emerging evidence implicate glia,

00:03:07.656 --> 00:03:10.388
the non neuronal cells of the
brain in this pruning process.

00:03:10.388 --> 00:03:11.865
And more recent work have been

00:03:11.865 --> 00:03:14.187
implicating these cells called microglia.

00:03:14.187 --> 00:03:16.490
Now as a card carrying glial biologist,

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.030
I have to say I've ignored
these cells my entire career

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.316
until very recently and
that is in part because

00:03:21.316 --> 00:03:24.613
these are the only cells
not born in the brain.

00:03:24.613 --> 00:03:27.107
These are our immune cells, they actually,

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:29.559
now we know reside and are originating

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:33.206
from the yolk sac and they
actually enter the brain

00:03:33.206 --> 00:03:34.617
very, very early in development,

00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:36.267
in fact in a mouse they enter the brain

00:03:36.267 --> 00:03:37.999
as early as embryonic date eight.

00:03:37.999 --> 00:03:40.551
That means they're the first
non-neuronal cell in the brain,

00:03:40.551 --> 00:03:42.910
they're there when an
amazing growth is happening

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.464
in the embryonic brain yet
we know surprisingly little

00:03:45.464 --> 00:03:47.765
about the normal roles of these cells.

00:03:47.765 --> 00:03:48.937
Much of what we knew about them

00:03:48.937 --> 00:03:51.066
was in the context of injury and disease.

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:53.765
Now these cells make up about
10% of the cells of the brain,

00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:56.948
they tile the brain, but one
of the things that makes them

00:03:56.948 --> 00:03:59.340
incredibly unique and
different from any other cell,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.095
is they're our resident phagocytes,

00:04:01.095 --> 00:04:02.922
they're actually by
nature of the fact that

00:04:02.922 --> 00:04:05.079
they're immune cells, they're
really good at eating things,

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:07.937
or phagocytosing things,
but the other thing

00:04:07.937 --> 00:04:10.381
that two photon in vivo
imaging has shown us,

00:04:10.381 --> 00:04:13.553
meaning if you were to put a
microscope over a mouse's brain

00:04:13.553 --> 00:04:16.142
and thin their skull
and use a reporter line

00:04:16.142 --> 00:04:18.752
in which all the microglia
are labeled green,

00:04:18.752 --> 00:04:22.967
what you can see is that these
cells are incredibly dynamic.

00:04:22.967 --> 00:04:27.140
You can see the processes are
constantly moving all the time

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.895
and they're serving the
extracellular environment.

00:04:29.895 --> 00:04:31.490
And the big question we wanted to know

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.860
is what is it that they're surveying?

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.874
And one of the things we now appreciate

00:04:34.874 --> 00:04:36.854
that they're serving are synapses,

00:04:36.854 --> 00:04:39.844
so if you were to for
example overlay neurons,

00:04:39.844 --> 00:04:42.881
in this case this neuron
is labeled in red.

00:04:42.881 --> 00:04:44.739
You can see the processes
of these microglia

00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:49.345
intimately contacting spines
and axons all the time.

00:04:49.345 --> 00:04:52.332
This is happening in your
brain right now, it's amazing.

00:04:52.332 --> 00:04:53.751
And one of the things we also appreciate

00:04:53.751 --> 00:04:55.895
from our work and others
is that they can even

00:04:55.895 --> 00:04:58.091
sense local changes in neuronal activity.

00:04:58.091 --> 00:05:00.846
So if you manipulate that
neuron, you fire it more,

00:05:00.846 --> 00:05:03.617
or if you silence it, the
microglia knows somehow,

00:05:03.617 --> 00:05:06.152
and that suggests that there
must be some sort of signals

00:05:06.152 --> 00:05:08.871
that are being transmitted
and that the microglia

00:05:08.871 --> 00:05:11.373
have receptors that
recognize those signals.

00:05:11.373 --> 00:05:12.994
So what about the post-natal brain

00:05:12.994 --> 00:05:16.125
when all of this remarkable
plasticity is happening?

00:05:16.125 --> 00:05:17.975
What about early in development?

00:05:17.975 --> 00:05:19.644
So that is the question
we set up to address

00:05:19.644 --> 00:05:21.461
a number of years ago and we use

00:05:21.461 --> 00:05:23.650
the developing mouse
visual system as our model

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.458
because so much was known
about how synapses prune

00:05:26.458 --> 00:05:27.756
in this particular part of the brain.

00:05:27.756 --> 00:05:30.360
And so we use the developing
retina geniculate system

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.694
of the mouse where you can
actually label the inputs

00:05:33.694 --> 00:05:36.358
from the two eyes with
dye and then we could ask

00:05:36.358 --> 00:05:38.410
what are the microglia
doing at that circuit

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.316
during the critical period of pruning?

00:05:40.316 --> 00:05:43.660
And what you can see here is
that the microglia in green

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.548
are intimately associated with
the left and right eye axons

00:05:47.548 --> 00:05:49.540
and the question that Dori
Schafer in my lab has asked

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:53.195
was are they actually engulfing
or eating those synapses?

00:05:53.195 --> 00:05:55.449
And what we found is that
almost every microglia

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.547
we surveyed during this peak
of remodeling at this point

00:05:57.547 --> 00:06:00.853
were full of inputs from
the left and the right eye,

00:06:00.853 --> 00:06:02.320
they were actually in their lysosomes,

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.592
and quite importantly
this process of pruning

00:06:04.592 --> 00:06:06.527
was developmentally regulated.

00:06:06.527 --> 00:06:08.416
They were doing it during
these critical periods

00:06:08.416 --> 00:06:10.513
of pruning but not later and that suggests

00:06:10.513 --> 00:06:12.704
that there must be some
signals that tell the microglia

00:06:12.704 --> 00:06:15.691
to do this and other signals
that tell the microglia to stop

00:06:15.691 --> 00:06:16.750
and we're very much interested in

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.263
understanding what those signals are.

00:06:18.263 --> 00:06:20.423
So the next big question
of course is how is it

00:06:20.423 --> 00:06:23.609
that microglia know
which synapse to prune?

00:06:23.609 --> 00:06:27.377
Now we now appreciate that
it's not a random process.

00:06:27.377 --> 00:06:29.846
The first hypothesis was
well, they're phagocytes,

00:06:29.846 --> 00:06:30.957
they just happen to be there,

00:06:30.957 --> 00:06:32.520
anything that's around, they're gonna eat,

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.718
but we knew there were
critical periods, again.

00:06:34.718 --> 00:06:36.675
And so that suggested the possibility

00:06:36.675 --> 00:06:39.968
that they were recognizing
synapses through some molecules.

00:06:39.968 --> 00:06:43.550
So going back to that activity
dependent competition model,

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.343
the red and the green, the
red and the blue inputs,

00:06:46.343 --> 00:06:49.395
if you change activity, we
know that the less active

00:06:49.395 --> 00:06:50.968
inputs are selectively eliminated

00:06:50.968 --> 00:06:53.000
or more preferentially eliminated.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.931
And again using the visual
system we can manipulate activity

00:06:55.931 --> 00:06:58.561
in the two eyes and
block activity in one eye

00:06:58.561 --> 00:07:01.150
with a drug that blocks sodium
dependent action potentials

00:07:01.150 --> 00:07:04.159
and what we've found is that
microglia preferentially

00:07:04.159 --> 00:07:07.164
engulf the axons from the less active eye,

00:07:07.164 --> 00:07:08.298
and that again tells us this

00:07:08.298 --> 00:07:10.115
has some activity dependent cues.

00:07:10.115 --> 00:07:13.033
So how do microglia know
which synapse to prune?

00:07:13.033 --> 00:07:15.572
Well recent work, if you go back to work

00:07:15.572 --> 00:07:17.752
I did as a post doc in Ben Barres's lab,

00:07:17.752 --> 00:07:21.035
back then we unexpectedly
identified a role for a group

00:07:21.035 --> 00:07:24.130
of immune molecules called
complement in this process

00:07:24.130 --> 00:07:26.448
of synaptic pruning, in
the mouse visual system.

00:07:26.448 --> 00:07:28.284
Now this is a group of immune molecules

00:07:28.284 --> 00:07:31.391
traditionally associated with
the innate immune system.

00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:33.538
And this was a surprising
finding at the time

00:07:33.538 --> 00:07:34.758
but what we essentially found

00:07:34.758 --> 00:07:36.450
is that the retinal ganglion cells,

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:38.485
the cells that are
actually getting pruned,

00:07:38.485 --> 00:07:42.175
are actually expressing some
of these molecules like C1q

00:07:42.175 --> 00:07:45.523
and if you knock out
C1q and downstream C3,

00:07:45.523 --> 00:07:47.934
these mice failed to segregate into

00:07:47.934 --> 00:07:50.055
their eye specific
territories and they remain

00:07:50.055 --> 00:07:52.375
multiply innervated, even into adulthood.

00:07:52.375 --> 00:07:55.314
And so this raises question
of how is it that a group

00:07:55.314 --> 00:07:57.435
of secreted molecules that are related

00:07:57.435 --> 00:07:59.109
with the immune system could be doing

00:07:59.109 --> 00:08:01.034
something as precise as pruning?

00:08:01.034 --> 00:08:02.961
Well going back to the immune system,

00:08:02.961 --> 00:08:04.277
this is where we learned a lot,

00:08:04.277 --> 00:08:06.779
complement's main role
in the immune system

00:08:06.779 --> 00:08:10.647
is to tag apoptotic cells and
bacteria for rapid removal.

00:08:10.647 --> 00:08:13.847
So for example C1q would
bind to that bacterial cell,

00:08:13.847 --> 00:08:16.442
this would set up a proteolytic
cascade that then cleaves

00:08:16.442 --> 00:08:19.333
downstream components like C4, C2, C3,

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:22.294
and the canonical way by which
that cell would get removed

00:08:22.294 --> 00:08:25.568
is it would get tagged
by C3 and then a main way

00:08:25.568 --> 00:08:27.904
it gets removed is through
phagocytes like macrophages

00:08:27.904 --> 00:08:30.927
in your periphery that express
receptors for complement.

00:08:30.927 --> 00:08:33.714
And what we found is that
complement was actually tagging,

00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:37.224
if you will, subsets of
synapses during development

00:08:37.224 --> 00:08:40.485
and that microglia are the
main cells that express

00:08:40.485 --> 00:08:42.571
this complement receptor and
that led to this hypothesis

00:08:42.571 --> 00:08:46.727
that microglia were recognizing
complement tagged synapses,

00:08:46.727 --> 00:08:48.565
maybe the less active synapses.

00:08:48.565 --> 00:08:50.903
And indeed when we knocked
out either the receptor

00:08:50.903 --> 00:08:53.347
on the microglia or complement itself,

00:08:53.347 --> 00:08:55.880
microglia are only about half
as good as engulfing synapses

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:58.803
so this identifies complement
as one of the main ways

00:08:58.803 --> 00:09:00.514
by which these synapses get pruned.

00:09:00.514 --> 00:09:02.710
But of course it also tells
you it's not the whole story.

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:06.756
Now importantly if you fail
to prune for this mechanism,

00:09:06.756 --> 00:09:09.943
this led to sustained defects
in synaptic connectivity,

00:09:09.943 --> 00:09:11.493
there were too many synapses,

00:09:11.493 --> 00:09:13.399
in fact David Prince's lab later went on

00:09:13.399 --> 00:09:16.156
in the C1q knockout mice to
show that these mice remain

00:09:16.156 --> 00:09:18.891
multiply innervated and
hyperconnected and they were

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:21.789
more prone to epilepsy, at
least to the adolescent period.

00:09:21.789 --> 00:09:23.818
And that of course raises
questions many questions

00:09:23.818 --> 00:09:26.248
we're actively investigating
relating to the functional

00:09:26.248 --> 00:09:29.256
and behavioral consequences
of not enough pruning

00:09:29.256 --> 00:09:31.171
or too much pruning during development.

00:09:31.171 --> 00:09:34.770
And that now brings me to
this question that this is one

00:09:34.770 --> 00:09:37.644
of many mechanisms by
which synapses gets pruned,

00:09:37.644 --> 00:09:39.517
is unexpected because it
involves an immune cell

00:09:39.517 --> 00:09:41.272
and a group of these
secreted immune molecules,

00:09:41.272 --> 00:09:43.454
but there's many other
lines of evidence now

00:09:43.454 --> 00:09:45.237
that are implicating both glia

00:09:45.237 --> 00:09:48.549
and other immune molecules
like the MHC and the PRB.

00:09:48.549 --> 00:09:51.013
Now importantly, must
like the immune system,

00:09:51.013 --> 00:09:52.951
this pruning pathway we've identified

00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:55.080
seems to be tightly regulated.

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.853
Microglia do not continue
to do this through life,

00:09:57.853 --> 00:10:00.585
there are times and places
in which this is happening,

00:10:00.585 --> 00:10:03.360
they become less phagocytic
as the animal matures,

00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.061
and a lot of these molecules
like C3 are dramatically

00:10:06.061 --> 00:10:07.913
downregulated in the healthy brain.

00:10:07.913 --> 00:10:10.473
You'd not want to have pruning
continuing all the time,

00:10:10.473 --> 00:10:13.165
but what if it did,
what if it kept pruning?

00:10:13.165 --> 00:10:14.558
Or what if the brakes weren't there?

00:10:14.558 --> 00:10:16.984
Or what if something turned
this pathway on too much?

00:10:16.984 --> 00:10:19.757
We hypothesize that this
could lead to an excess

00:10:19.757 --> 00:10:22.812
or an inappropriate pruning
of the wrong synapse

00:10:22.812 --> 00:10:25.854
or too many synapses and
this could potentially

00:10:25.854 --> 00:10:29.326
lead to some of the
pathobiology underlying

00:10:29.326 --> 00:10:31.137
neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric

00:10:31.137 --> 00:10:33.365
disorders such as schizophrenia.

00:10:33.365 --> 00:10:35.219
So this has been the question
that we've been interested

00:10:35.219 --> 00:10:37.432
for a very long time but
of course as you know,

00:10:37.432 --> 00:10:39.628
there are not very many good
animal models of schizophrenia,

00:10:39.628 --> 00:10:42.093
so it's been a very
hard question to tackle.

00:10:42.093 --> 00:10:44.994
Now indeed several lines
of evidence suggest

00:10:44.994 --> 00:10:47.405
that synaptic pruning may
be altered in schizophrenia.

00:10:47.405 --> 00:10:49.994
In fact the pruning hypothesis
put forth by Feinberg

00:10:49.994 --> 00:10:53.040
40 years ago proposed an
altered cortical pruning

00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.112
is critical development of the disease.

00:10:55.112 --> 00:10:58.273
And indeed this classic
study by David Lewis's lab

00:10:58.273 --> 00:11:01.511
shows very intriguingly a loss
of spines in the prefrontal

00:11:01.511 --> 00:11:03.668
cortex of some individuals
with schizophrenia.

00:11:03.668 --> 00:11:06.929
And imaging studies have
also showed cortical thinning

00:11:06.929 --> 00:11:10.223
in patients even before
the onset of symptoms.

00:11:10.223 --> 00:11:12.399
And putting this together,
the pruning hypothesis

00:11:12.399 --> 00:11:14.288
is pretty attractive, however,

00:11:14.288 --> 00:11:17.419
it's not actually been
directly demonstrated.

00:11:17.419 --> 00:11:19.199
We don't yet know, for
example, in these patients,

00:11:19.199 --> 00:11:21.809
were these really a pruning defect?

00:11:21.809 --> 00:11:23.494
Were these lost or never formed?

00:11:23.494 --> 00:11:25.607
Was this cause or consequence?

00:11:25.607 --> 00:11:28.706
And again, this is very difficult
to really tackle in models

00:11:28.706 --> 00:11:31.871
because there really aren't
any good animal models.

00:11:31.871 --> 00:11:34.822
Well this of course is
where human genetics

00:11:34.822 --> 00:11:37.235
can be extremely useful
and in the next few slides

00:11:37.235 --> 00:11:39.611
I'd like to share with you
new and recently published

00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:41.405
findings by colleagues Steve McCarroll

00:11:41.405 --> 00:11:43.332
and his graduate student Aswin Sekar,

00:11:43.332 --> 00:11:45.592
who have been using genetics
to identify mechanisms

00:11:45.592 --> 00:11:47.943
and novel pathways for treatments.

00:11:47.943 --> 00:11:50.228
Now the strongest genetic signal

00:11:50.228 --> 00:11:52.295
by far has been on chromosome 6,

00:11:52.295 --> 00:11:54.371
in a region known as the MHC locus,

00:11:54.371 --> 00:11:55.832
which contains many genes,

00:11:55.832 --> 00:11:58.239
many of which relate to the immune system.

00:11:58.239 --> 00:12:00.037
But researchers had no idea

00:12:00.037 --> 00:12:02.586
which of these many
genes contribute to risk.

00:12:02.586 --> 00:12:05.128
Now this region spans hundreds of genes,

00:12:05.128 --> 00:12:08.102
many of them, as I said
encode immune related genes,

00:12:08.102 --> 00:12:11.885
but the MHC signal has
really remained unexplained.

00:12:11.885 --> 00:12:15.393
And really it doesn't follow
any mathematical or statistical

00:12:15.393 --> 00:12:18.684
patterns explainable by any
one known genetic variant,

00:12:18.684 --> 00:12:20.784
so what could be explaining this effect?

00:12:20.784 --> 00:12:23.773
Well intriguingly and
interestingly, within the MHC,

00:12:23.773 --> 00:12:26.111
one of the strongest risks
are associated with loci

00:12:26.111 --> 00:12:29.479
near the gene C4, complement C4,

00:12:29.479 --> 00:12:32.024
which of course is a key part
of the complement cascade

00:12:32.024 --> 00:12:33.437
I talked to you about earlier.

00:12:33.437 --> 00:12:36.424
Now Aswin honed in on this
for that and other reasons

00:12:36.424 --> 00:12:39.516
and he was also, and Steve's
lab has been interested

00:12:39.516 --> 00:12:42.469
in this question of
structural variability,

00:12:42.469 --> 00:12:45.099
why different people have
different numbers and copies

00:12:45.099 --> 00:12:47.725
of different genes and
they developed methods,

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:50.027
molecular techniques, to characterize

00:12:50.027 --> 00:12:53.164
the C4 gene's structure
in human DNA samples.

00:12:53.164 --> 00:12:55.546
And quite interesting, what
you'll see is there are

00:12:55.546 --> 00:12:58.716
actually two C4 genes, C4A and C4B,

00:12:58.716 --> 00:13:02.784
and unlike most genes,
this gene has a high degree

00:13:02.784 --> 00:13:05.158
of structural variability and variation.

00:13:05.158 --> 00:13:07.751
And what he found is that
some people's genomes have

00:13:07.751 --> 00:13:11.340
extra copies of A, some have
extra copies of B, some have,

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:13.415
completely lack one or the other,

00:13:13.415 --> 00:13:16.085
and this led Aswin to
ask could the structural

00:13:16.085 --> 00:13:18.679
form of C4 you inherit,
could this be related

00:13:18.679 --> 00:13:20.860
to the increased risk of schizophrenia?

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:23.859
Now the challenge was that
although the Aswins developed

00:13:23.859 --> 00:13:27.167
these to measure C4A
and B and the variation

00:13:27.167 --> 00:13:29.903
in different individuals, how do you get,

00:13:29.903 --> 00:13:32.772
how do you link this to
schizophrenia risk, right?

00:13:32.772 --> 00:13:35.142
So Aswin's team developed
a novel way to map

00:13:35.142 --> 00:13:39.018
how C4 structure relates to SNPs, right,

00:13:39.018 --> 00:13:41.240
or which genetic data
was already available

00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.550
from tens of thousands of individuals.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.588
They essentially built a map
to infer the four most common

00:13:46.588 --> 00:13:49.760
forms of C4 from the SNP
data, surrounding the gene,

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.987
which essentially created
molecular barcodes

00:13:51.987 --> 00:13:53.794
from the SNP patterns and it works

00:13:53.794 --> 00:13:55.894
because humans share long genomic segments

00:13:55.894 --> 00:13:58.037
they have inherited from common ancestors,

00:13:58.037 --> 00:14:00.069
and this map can allow
them to take advantage

00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:03.255
of SNP data and giant
databases from around the world

00:14:03.255 --> 00:14:05.791
which essentially turned a
molecular biology problem

00:14:05.791 --> 00:14:08.813
into a big data problem,
and here's what they found.

00:14:08.813 --> 00:14:11.244
Alleles of C4 appear to shape risk

00:14:11.244 --> 00:14:14.289
in proportion to their
effect on C4A expression.

00:14:14.289 --> 00:14:17.567
On the left, which you'll
see, is how each alleles,

00:14:17.567 --> 00:14:20.263
here, relates to schizophrenia risk,

00:14:20.263 --> 00:14:22.420
and you can see those that have more C4A

00:14:22.420 --> 00:14:24.653
have a significantly increased risk.

00:14:24.653 --> 00:14:27.995
On the right is each allele's
effect on C4A expression

00:14:27.995 --> 00:14:30.279
in the brain, they found
the C4 gene's structure

00:14:30.279 --> 00:14:32.812
could predict C4 gene activity.

00:14:32.812 --> 00:14:34.901
And notice now that those that have C4A

00:14:34.901 --> 00:14:37.800
have more C4A expression, and together,

00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:39.866
I know I'm oversimplifying this story

00:14:39.866 --> 00:14:42.300
which has been recently
published earlier this year,

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:44.122
but for now the important thing to realize

00:14:44.122 --> 00:14:46.548
is the more C4 you make from the locus,

00:14:46.548 --> 00:14:48.543
the greater the risk of schizophrenia.

00:14:48.543 --> 00:14:50.520
Now that raises a number of questions

00:14:50.520 --> 00:14:52.361
that we're now actively investigating,

00:14:52.361 --> 00:14:55.718
and we started to collaborate
Steve's lab with my lab

00:14:55.718 --> 00:14:58.510
and also Michael Carroll's
lab to ask this question,

00:14:58.510 --> 00:15:02.647
how is that elevated C4A,
how does this contribute

00:15:02.647 --> 00:15:04.178
to the risk of schizophrenia,

00:15:04.178 --> 00:15:07.467
what is the biology
underlying this risk factor?

00:15:07.467 --> 00:15:09.143
Now this brought together my lab

00:15:09.143 --> 00:15:11.089
which has been studying
complement and pruning,

00:15:11.089 --> 00:15:13.208
Michael Carroll's lab is an immunologist

00:15:13.208 --> 00:15:15.275
who's been studying C4 for his career

00:15:15.275 --> 00:15:17.456
and all of our labs together joined forces

00:15:17.456 --> 00:15:19.522
in this multidisciplinary collaboration.

00:15:19.522 --> 00:15:22.943
And the first thing we did is
we looked at the C4 protein,

00:15:22.943 --> 00:15:24.994
and they're actually pretty
good human antibodies for this,

00:15:24.994 --> 00:15:28.216
and we basically asked, much
like we'd noticed in the mouse,

00:15:28.216 --> 00:15:31.459
could C4 be tagging synapses
in the brain of humans?

00:15:31.459 --> 00:15:34.866
And we used tissue that was
generated and given to us

00:15:34.866 --> 00:15:37.448
by the Stanley Collection
and we looked in these brains

00:15:37.448 --> 00:15:40.275
and showed that C4 was in fact binding

00:15:40.275 --> 00:15:42.649
to subsets of synapses in the human brain

00:15:42.649 --> 00:15:45.391
in the schizophrenia patients.

00:15:45.391 --> 00:15:48.284
And then moreover, Heather de Rivera

00:15:48.284 --> 00:15:50.844
in Steve McCarroll's lab
grew cortical neurons

00:15:50.844 --> 00:15:53.168
and then stained them after they developed

00:15:53.168 --> 00:15:55.989
with C4 antibodies and
shown that C4 also binds

00:15:55.989 --> 00:15:59.274
to these synaptic structures
in cortical neurons.

00:15:59.274 --> 00:16:00.780
And interestingly and importantly,

00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:02.771
C4 is actually being made by the neurons

00:16:02.771 --> 00:16:04.830
and secreted by these human neurons.

00:16:04.830 --> 00:16:07.815
So this is just early data to suggest

00:16:07.815 --> 00:16:10.362
that the protein is there
and it's actually binding

00:16:10.362 --> 00:16:12.245
the synapses, at least
under these conditions.

00:16:12.245 --> 00:16:14.511
But of course the big question
is, is it related to pruning?

00:16:14.511 --> 00:16:16.871
So this is when again went back to mouse,

00:16:16.871 --> 00:16:18.849
so we went from human to mouse
in this case and we asked

00:16:18.849 --> 00:16:21.316
does C4 mediate synaptic pruning?

00:16:21.316 --> 00:16:22.959
And so we went back to our

00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:24.732
very classic retina geniculate system,

00:16:24.732 --> 00:16:27.522
we used mice that were
generated by Mike Carroll's lab,

00:16:27.522 --> 00:16:29.954
these C4 knockout mice and Allison Bialas,

00:16:29.954 --> 00:16:31.303
who was a graduate student with me

00:16:31.303 --> 00:16:33.532
and now a post doc with
Mike, did this experiment,

00:16:33.532 --> 00:16:35.478
basically did the eye-specific segregation

00:16:35.478 --> 00:16:39.240
or pruning experiments in
C4 mice versus control.

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.781
And the prediction
would be that lacking C4

00:16:41.781 --> 00:16:45.072
would lead to a defect
or a lack of pruning,

00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:47.500
much like we saw in the C1q and C3 mice,

00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:49.170
and that's exactly what we saw.

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.430
And interestingly the
retinal ganglion cells

00:16:51.430 --> 00:16:54.155
were expressing a lot of C4
during the peak of pruning,

00:16:54.155 --> 00:16:55.703
so this is a pre-synaptic neuron,

00:16:55.703 --> 00:16:59.447
and mice that lacked C4
failed to segregate nicely

00:16:59.447 --> 00:17:01.175
into these eye-specific territories,

00:17:01.175 --> 00:17:05.390
which you can actually label
by tracing the left and right

00:17:05.390 --> 00:17:08.124
eye with chlorotoxin and
then doing this threshold

00:17:08.124 --> 00:17:10.498
then to show the two eye interactions.

00:17:10.498 --> 00:17:14.960
So this told us that lacking
C4 led to failure to prune,

00:17:14.960 --> 00:17:17.054
but the big question now moving forward

00:17:17.054 --> 00:17:19.368
is could excessive pruning contribute

00:17:19.368 --> 00:17:21.427
to the pathobiology of schizophrenia?

00:17:21.427 --> 00:17:23.422
Could this relate to David Lewis's study,

00:17:23.422 --> 00:17:26.174
and so that is actually
what we're now together,

00:17:26.174 --> 00:17:28.244
as a collaboration,
actively investigating.

00:17:28.244 --> 00:17:30.818
Could over-activation of complement during

00:17:30.818 --> 00:17:32.420
this critical periods of pruning

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.761
contribute to wiring
defects in schizophrenia?

00:17:34.761 --> 00:17:37.066
A number of other
questions were raised that

00:17:37.066 --> 00:17:39.395
we're actively pursuing as
well and one of the questions

00:17:39.395 --> 00:17:41.199
that again stemmed from the beautiful work

00:17:41.199 --> 00:17:43.736
presented earlier today,
could pruning also help us

00:17:43.736 --> 00:17:46.278
to understanding age of
onset of schizophrenia?

00:17:46.278 --> 00:17:48.124
Might pruning become too intense

00:17:48.124 --> 00:17:50.506
or prolonged in certain individuals?

00:17:50.506 --> 00:17:53.318
Might it expose other,
pre-existing vulnerabilities?

00:17:53.318 --> 00:17:55.819
And how is it that
environment, like stress,

00:17:55.819 --> 00:17:59.471
impinges on the genetic pathways like C4?

00:17:59.471 --> 00:18:02.008
And we're also learning to now
move from the visual system

00:18:02.008 --> 00:18:05.141
that we love so much into much
more uncharted territories,

00:18:05.141 --> 00:18:07.495
which is the prefrontal
cortex and Mike Carroll

00:18:07.495 --> 00:18:10.320
is developing mice models
to look at overexpression

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.333
of multiple copies of human
C4A in mice so that we can

00:18:14.333 --> 00:18:16.095
start to address some of these questions.

00:18:16.095 --> 00:18:18.603
Now I'm just gonna end in
my last slide to try to

00:18:18.603 --> 00:18:21.494
pull this together, but also
to broaden this a bit more.

00:18:21.494 --> 00:18:22.327
The idea that although
we've been focused on

00:18:22.327 --> 00:18:26.190
neurodevelopmental and
neuropsychiatric disorders,

00:18:26.190 --> 00:18:27.958
could this pruning pathway represent

00:18:27.958 --> 00:18:31.324
a more general, common pathway
that not only might explain

00:18:31.324 --> 00:18:33.275
synapse loss during development,

00:18:33.275 --> 00:18:36.417
but actually could it actually
also help to understand

00:18:36.417 --> 00:18:39.080
why synapses are vulnerable
in the adult brain,

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:40.705
especially in aging and

00:18:40.705 --> 00:18:42.882
neurodegenerative disease
such as Alzheimer's?

00:18:42.882 --> 00:18:45.814
And so indeed multiple
work now from several labs

00:18:45.814 --> 00:18:49.107
including our own has suggested
that this very same pruning

00:18:49.107 --> 00:18:50.651
pathway that I just told you about

00:18:50.651 --> 00:18:53.404
becomes aberrantly
activated, very, very early

00:18:53.404 --> 00:18:55.728
in Alzheimer's Disease
models and other models,

00:18:55.728 --> 00:18:59.482
and that indeed, that this
overactivation contributes

00:18:59.482 --> 00:19:01.905
to synapse loss and very excitingly,

00:19:01.905 --> 00:19:04.459
if you block this pathway,
either genetically,

00:19:04.459 --> 00:19:06.453
or with antibodies or other mechanisms,

00:19:06.453 --> 00:19:08.610
you can prevent synapse
loss and in some cases,

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:10.428
even some of the cognitive impairment.

00:19:10.428 --> 00:19:14.376
And so I'll end with this
positive, hopeful last slide

00:19:14.376 --> 00:19:17.255
that suggests that maybe
by understanding detailed

00:19:17.255 --> 00:19:20.048
mechanisms by which
complement and microglia

00:19:20.048 --> 00:19:23.475
are selectively targeting
synapses in these various models,

00:19:23.475 --> 00:19:26.637
could this help us to try
to identify new targets

00:19:26.637 --> 00:19:29.445
to particularly manipulate synapse loss

00:19:29.445 --> 00:19:31.279
in the right time and the right place?

00:19:31.279 --> 00:19:33.080
And could it also identify new

00:19:33.080 --> 00:19:35.275
biomarkers for some of these disorders?

00:19:35.275 --> 00:19:38.034
So I'll just end there by
thanking a lot of individuals,

00:19:38.034 --> 00:19:41.196
past and present lab members,
incredible collaborators,

00:19:41.196 --> 00:19:43.665
and of course generous funding.

00:19:43.665 --> 00:19:44.498
Thanks so much.

00:19:44.498 --> 00:19:46.854
(audience applauding)

00:19:46.854 --> 00:19:49.883
- So we're talking
about brain development.

00:19:49.883 --> 00:19:54.050
And as you know there are many
ways this can get screwed up.

00:19:55.087 --> 00:19:57.296
It can get screwed up by heredity,

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:59.860
as you'll hear about
from Matt State later.

00:19:59.860 --> 00:20:01.508
It can get screwed up by disease

00:20:01.508 --> 00:20:03.610
or environmental deprivation.

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.059
And so a convenient way
of conceptualizing this

00:20:06.059 --> 00:20:08.613
is that imagine that we have
a number of different measures

00:20:08.613 --> 00:20:10.908
of brain maturation in
different parts of the brain,

00:20:10.908 --> 00:20:12.288
and so on, different processes.

00:20:12.288 --> 00:20:16.172
But all these processes improve with age.

00:20:16.172 --> 00:20:20.082
And in the case of
developmental brain disorder,

00:20:20.082 --> 00:20:22.279
it's a derailment and you see

00:20:22.279 --> 00:20:25.946
a accumulated deficit
as the person matures.

00:20:27.724 --> 00:20:30.233
And the question that we're
really interested in now

00:20:30.233 --> 00:20:32.787
is whether at the time of diagnosis,

00:20:32.787 --> 00:20:35.827
which often is in early childhood

00:20:35.827 --> 00:20:38.377
in many of these diseases or even later,

00:20:38.377 --> 00:20:40.871
can we initiate a
treatment that can reverse

00:20:40.871 --> 00:20:43.600
the consequence of the disease?

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:48.151
So we can imagine conceptually
three potential outcomes.

00:20:48.151 --> 00:20:51.735
And the most dismal outcome
is the one illustrated

00:20:51.735 --> 00:20:54.853
on the top and that is is
that I can only intervene

00:20:54.853 --> 00:20:56.800
in a very early, critical period,

00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.247
and then if you miss that period,

00:20:58.247 --> 00:21:01.129
maybe the damage has
already been done in utero,

00:21:01.129 --> 00:21:04.819
prior to birth, it's just too
late to initiate a treatment.

00:21:04.819 --> 00:21:07.040
So that's the most
pessimistic point of view.

00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:09.304
The most optimistic point
of view is that indeed

00:21:09.304 --> 00:21:11.498
we can apply our great
knowledge of neurobiology

00:21:11.498 --> 00:21:14.714
to come up with good
treatments and they actually

00:21:14.714 --> 00:21:16.731
reverse the course of the disease

00:21:16.731 --> 00:21:18.641
and actually restore normal function.

00:21:18.641 --> 00:21:20.676
And probably a realistic possibility

00:21:20.676 --> 00:21:23.323
is the one in the middle,
the hopeful scenario,

00:21:23.323 --> 00:21:25.349
that we can initiate treatments

00:21:25.349 --> 00:21:27.369
that may prevent further decline.

00:21:27.369 --> 00:21:31.536
So the work in my lab is
addressing these questions

00:21:32.661 --> 00:21:35.254
in different ways and one
of the ways we look at

00:21:35.254 --> 00:21:37.737
is a genetically defined
disease called fragile X,

00:21:37.737 --> 00:21:39.496
we've done a lot of work on that.

00:21:39.496 --> 00:21:41.154
But we're also interested
in the consequences

00:21:41.154 --> 00:21:45.131
of environmental deprivation,
particularly a disease called

00:21:45.131 --> 00:21:50.011
amblyopia, and I'm gonna tell
you about that work today.

00:21:50.011 --> 00:21:53.929
So amblyopia is a not
uncommon visual disability.

00:21:53.929 --> 00:21:57.133
It affects approximately
3% of the world population,

00:21:57.133 --> 00:21:59.852
and it's more prevalent in nations

00:21:59.852 --> 00:22:04.019
where there's poor early
childhood pediatric screening.

00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:07.521
Is this a consequence
of poor quality vision

00:22:07.521 --> 00:22:09.316
during infancy and early childhood,

00:22:09.316 --> 00:22:11.251
and that poor quality could arise

00:22:11.251 --> 00:22:13.077
because the eyes aren't properly aligned

00:22:13.077 --> 00:22:15.597
at birth so the child is seeing double,

00:22:15.597 --> 00:22:18.639
can arise 'cause there's a
dense cataract in one eye

00:22:18.639 --> 00:22:21.599
or a droopy eyelid, or
it could arise because

00:22:21.599 --> 00:22:24.132
there are different refractive
indices in the two eyes,

00:22:24.132 --> 00:22:27.817
so you can't focus an image
on both eyes at the same time.

00:22:27.817 --> 00:22:30.321
The consequence is the
same and it is usually

00:22:30.321 --> 00:22:34.471
a fairly severe visual
impairment in one of the eyes.

00:22:34.471 --> 00:22:38.471
Now if that optical
abnormality or what have you

00:22:39.490 --> 00:22:41.712
is corrected very early in life,

00:22:41.712 --> 00:22:44.494
there is a good chance to see
some recovery of function.

00:22:44.494 --> 00:22:47.221
But if that correction occurs later,

00:22:47.221 --> 00:22:49.888
there's a very dismal prognosis.

00:22:51.374 --> 00:22:55.541
So luckily there are animal
models for this amblyopia,

00:22:56.638 --> 00:22:59.857
in fact every mammal with binocular vision

00:22:59.857 --> 00:23:02.754
will show a susceptibility to poor quality

00:23:02.754 --> 00:23:04.772
visual experience during early life.

00:23:04.772 --> 00:23:09.196
I'm gonna show you a cat
video, it's always popular,

00:23:09.196 --> 00:23:10.321
(audience laughing)

00:23:10.321 --> 00:23:13.681
to illustrate the visual
disability in a kitten.

00:23:13.681 --> 00:23:15.827
So what we're looking at is,

00:23:15.827 --> 00:23:17.607
that's the top of the kitten's head,

00:23:17.607 --> 00:23:21.171
and this kitten had been
deprived of normal vision

00:23:21.171 --> 00:23:23.187
through one eye for only seven days,

00:23:23.187 --> 00:23:25.937
about the fourth post-natal week,

00:23:26.915 --> 00:23:28.960
and then that eye was unpatched,

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:31.411
and now we're gonna
measure the consequences.

00:23:31.411 --> 00:23:34.161
And first we're gonna measure
the vision to the good eye

00:23:34.161 --> 00:23:36.289
and the way we do this, when I say we,

00:23:36.289 --> 00:23:37.303
I'm being very liberal,

00:23:37.303 --> 00:23:38.952
this is actually work
done by Donald Mitchell,

00:23:38.952 --> 00:23:41.305
a collaborator of mine
at Dalhousie University,

00:23:41.305 --> 00:23:44.308
and Don's been studying
this for many, many years.

00:23:44.308 --> 00:23:47.188
And he puts the animal
in a box on a jackstand

00:23:47.188 --> 00:23:50.179
and the animal learns to
jump down onto a placard

00:23:50.179 --> 00:23:52.408
with the vertical stripes,
so the animal's reporting

00:23:52.408 --> 00:23:55.144
whether he can resolve
the stripes by choosing

00:23:55.144 --> 00:23:58.116
the correct placard to
jump on, and he gets a pat

00:23:58.116 --> 00:23:59.914
on the back and a little
bit of kitten food,

00:23:59.914 --> 00:24:02.998
and they're very happy
to perform this task.

00:24:02.998 --> 00:24:06.946
So first we're gonna look at
a kitten performing a task

00:24:06.946 --> 00:24:11.235
through the good eye, the eye
that had not been deprived,

00:24:11.235 --> 00:24:13.254
and you can see they're
quite keep to do this,

00:24:13.254 --> 00:24:16.870
they jump down, they
find the right stripes.

00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:18.870
Get a little liverwurst.

00:24:23.867 --> 00:24:25.400
And they could make the
stripes closer and closer

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.196
to get a measure of visual acuity,

00:24:27.196 --> 00:24:29.251
so this is a way that they can determine

00:24:29.251 --> 00:24:33.084
how well the animal can
resolve visual stimuli,

00:24:33.084 --> 00:24:35.836
the same way you would at the eye doctor.

00:24:35.836 --> 00:24:38.110
So now this is the same
animal but now we're gonna do

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:40.751
this test through the eye that had only

00:24:40.751 --> 00:24:43.938
temporarily been deprived of
vision, only for seven days.

00:24:43.938 --> 00:24:45.811
And what you're gonna see
is there's a very severe

00:24:45.811 --> 00:24:49.551
visual impairment, so the
good eye's being occluded

00:24:49.551 --> 00:24:52.717
with a black contact lens,
so the kitten's forced

00:24:52.717 --> 00:24:55.666
to look through its
lazy eye and you can see

00:24:55.666 --> 00:24:58.835
that it's having great
difficulty in even seeing

00:24:58.835 --> 00:25:03.208
the stripes versus the
empty chamber there.

00:25:03.208 --> 00:25:06.305
So it's a significant visual
disability and as I said,

00:25:06.305 --> 00:25:08.561
this is a kind of disability that affects

00:25:08.561 --> 00:25:11.846
up to 3% of the human population.

00:25:11.846 --> 00:25:15.325
The visual disability will
persist even when the eye's been

00:25:15.325 --> 00:25:18.630
reopened and the animal's
allowed to see through both eyes.

00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:21.297
And this is shown in this graph,

00:25:22.231 --> 00:25:25.168
where this is now a plot
of the visual acuity,

00:25:25.168 --> 00:25:27.918
the ability of the animal
to resolve the stripes,

00:25:27.918 --> 00:25:30.995
as a function of time after
the eye has been opened,

00:25:30.995 --> 00:25:32.993
the bad eye has been opened.

00:25:32.993 --> 00:25:35.335
And the green symbols show vision through

00:25:35.335 --> 00:25:37.709
the non-deprived eye and the blue symbols

00:25:37.709 --> 00:25:40.122
show the vision through the deprived eye.

00:25:40.122 --> 00:25:41.916
So you can see that
although there is some,

00:25:41.916 --> 00:25:43.785
a slight recovery, there's not much,

00:25:43.785 --> 00:25:46.418
and there's actually fairly
severe visual disability

00:25:46.418 --> 00:25:49.961
compared to the vision
through the good eye.

00:25:49.961 --> 00:25:54.375
So this model of temporary
monocular deprivation

00:25:54.375 --> 00:25:56.374
has been around for over 50 years,

00:25:56.374 --> 00:26:00.399
and many others, probably
many hundreds others,

00:26:00.399 --> 00:26:02.972
of other scientists
have been studying this

00:26:02.972 --> 00:26:04.988
very intensively, and we've
actually learned quite a bit

00:26:04.988 --> 00:26:08.720
about the mechanisms that
serve this disruption

00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:12.926
in the cortex and yet our work
has had very little impact

00:26:12.926 --> 00:26:15.575
on how the clinical
management of amblyopia.

00:26:15.575 --> 00:26:18.382
So the question I want to address today is

00:26:18.382 --> 00:26:21.599
can the understanding of the
synaptic basis for amblyopia

00:26:21.599 --> 00:26:24.213
suggest novel treatments
to promote recovery,

00:26:24.213 --> 00:26:26.682
that are better than
current standard of care?

00:26:26.682 --> 00:26:30.635
And the simple answer
to that question is yes.

00:26:30.635 --> 00:26:31.552
Here it is.

00:26:32.814 --> 00:26:36.502
So these are kittens that were
visually impaired in one eye,

00:26:36.502 --> 00:26:39.387
stable visual disability,
and a treatment was initiated

00:26:39.387 --> 00:26:43.554
based on principles of synaptic
plasticity at this age.

00:26:45.155 --> 00:26:48.325
This is now two months
after the deprived eye

00:26:48.325 --> 00:26:51.010
had been opened so about
three months of age.

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:53.133
You can see that there's
a very rapid recovery

00:26:53.133 --> 00:26:54.842
of vision through the deprived eye.

00:26:54.842 --> 00:26:58.029
So essentially curing this
form of visual disability.

00:26:58.029 --> 00:27:00.004
So hopefully I've gotten your attention

00:27:00.004 --> 00:27:03.085
with this amazing result and
now I'm gonna unpack it for you

00:27:03.085 --> 00:27:07.408
and tell you what that
magical treatment was.

00:27:07.408 --> 00:27:08.843
But to do so I need to walk you

00:27:08.843 --> 00:27:10.426
through a little bit of background

00:27:10.426 --> 00:27:14.593
which is the visual system
of mammals with two eyes,

00:27:17.895 --> 00:27:20.728
often kittens and mice or monkeys.

00:27:21.659 --> 00:27:23.352
And the visual pathway
originates with these

00:27:23.352 --> 00:27:25.542
retinal ganglion cells and the two eyes,

00:27:25.542 --> 00:27:26.936
they project centrally,

00:27:26.936 --> 00:27:29.631
they relay in the lateral
geniculate nucleus, your LGN,

00:27:29.631 --> 00:27:30.887
and then they go on and synapse

00:27:30.887 --> 00:27:33.313
on neurons in primary visual cortex.

00:27:33.313 --> 00:27:36.953
So when visual experience
is normal to the two eyes,

00:27:36.953 --> 00:27:41.003
as connections mature and
we have binocular vision.

00:27:41.003 --> 00:27:43.109
When there's an imbalance
in vision to the two eyes,

00:27:43.109 --> 00:27:46.280
it sets in motion a
stereotype choreography

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:49.894
of synaptic changes were the
inputs carrying information

00:27:49.894 --> 00:27:51.675
from the deprived eye are weakened

00:27:51.675 --> 00:27:54.513
and the inputs carrying
information by the open eye

00:27:54.513 --> 00:27:58.567
are eventually, show a
propensity towards strengthening.

00:27:58.567 --> 00:28:02.363
So we can measure these
consequences of that anatomical

00:28:02.363 --> 00:28:05.295
plasticity functionally as well,

00:28:05.295 --> 00:28:07.904
so we can put a microelectrode
in primary visual cortex,

00:28:07.904 --> 00:28:09.970
and we can record the
activity that's evoked

00:28:09.970 --> 00:28:12.706
by stimulation of the
right eye or the left eye.

00:28:12.706 --> 00:28:14.509
So that's, I just direct your attention

00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:16.435
to these histograms in the top.

00:28:16.435 --> 00:28:19.637
So this is now the number
of nerve impulses triggered

00:28:19.637 --> 00:28:21.814
in a response to
stimulation of the right eye

00:28:21.814 --> 00:28:25.386
and the left eye prior to any deprivation.

00:28:25.386 --> 00:28:26.928
So you can see this is
a neuron that responds

00:28:26.928 --> 00:28:29.324
happily to stimulation of both eyes,

00:28:29.324 --> 00:28:31.158
in fact there's a slight ocular dominance,

00:28:31.158 --> 00:28:33.917
slight preference for
stimulation of the right eye.

00:28:33.917 --> 00:28:35.601
And now this right eyelid is closed

00:28:35.601 --> 00:28:38.624
and then the neuron is
recorded again later.

00:28:38.624 --> 00:28:41.735
What you can see is it's
essentially lost all responsiveness

00:28:41.735 --> 00:28:44.492
to stimulation of the eye
that had been deprived.

00:28:44.492 --> 00:28:45.930
So no wonder the kittens can't see,

00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:49.597
we've disconnected the
cortex from that eye.

00:28:50.772 --> 00:28:54.522
So I mentioned that it
is possible to correct

00:28:56.193 --> 00:28:58.891
these visual disabilities if
you intervene early enough.

00:28:58.891 --> 00:29:02.021
And the current standard
of care is a therapy

00:29:02.021 --> 00:29:05.928
called patching therapy and
essentially that comprises

00:29:05.928 --> 00:29:09.150
putting a patch, usually an opaque patch,

00:29:09.150 --> 00:29:13.317
over the strong eye to force
the weak eye to function.

00:29:14.243 --> 00:29:17.435
And that can be successful, so
when you patch the strong eye

00:29:17.435 --> 00:29:20.363
you get a recovery of
vision to the weak eye.

00:29:20.363 --> 00:29:24.036
Now there are a number of
limitations of this approach,

00:29:24.036 --> 00:29:26.108
not least of which is
compliance because children

00:29:26.108 --> 00:29:28.347
don't like to have these eye patches.

00:29:28.347 --> 00:29:33.074
But also there is the
gains in the amblyopic eye

00:29:33.074 --> 00:29:34.949
often come at the expense of the good eye,

00:29:34.949 --> 00:29:36.544
'cause you're now patching it.

00:29:36.544 --> 00:29:38.450
There's little improvement
in binocular vision,

00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:41.547
so no stereopsis, and
again, it's only effective

00:29:41.547 --> 00:29:45.714
if you initiate this treatment
prior to age eight or so.

00:29:46.972 --> 00:29:48.603
So what are we, let's get under the hood

00:29:48.603 --> 00:29:52.253
and see what happens
during reverse patching.

00:29:52.253 --> 00:29:55.457
Well, it's again we're recording
now from a single neuron

00:29:55.457 --> 00:29:58.973
in primary visual cortex,
this is the situation,

00:29:58.973 --> 00:30:01.351
we're gonna start with the
situation after a period

00:30:01.351 --> 00:30:04.045
of monocular deprivation
so we have a neuron here

00:30:04.045 --> 00:30:06.113
that's responding only to the left eye,

00:30:06.113 --> 00:30:08.098
there's no response to the right eye,

00:30:08.098 --> 00:30:09.517
that's because we've already performed

00:30:09.517 --> 00:30:13.472
an ocular deprivation so
the kitten is amblyopic.

00:30:13.472 --> 00:30:16.495
Now what we're gonna do is we're
gonna patch the strong eye,

00:30:16.495 --> 00:30:19.520
we're gonna open the weak
eye and see what happens.

00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:22.957
And what happens is that
initially you get a loss

00:30:22.957 --> 00:30:25.804
of responsiveness to
the newly deprived eye,

00:30:25.804 --> 00:30:28.650
but with time you start
to gain a responsiveness

00:30:28.650 --> 00:30:32.067
in the formerly deprived, now seeing eye.

00:30:34.157 --> 00:30:38.184
So this is good, we can get a
recovery, but it's not ideal,

00:30:38.184 --> 00:30:41.135
it's not ideal because it
actually is a zero sum game.

00:30:41.135 --> 00:30:44.124
So the gains that we're
getting in this weak, lazy eye

00:30:44.124 --> 00:30:47.481
are coming at the expense
of the strong eye.

00:30:47.481 --> 00:30:51.605
And as in the case of
patching therapy in humans,

00:30:51.605 --> 00:30:54.051
this reverse patching in the animal models

00:30:54.051 --> 00:30:56.007
also shares a sensitive period,

00:30:56.007 --> 00:30:58.623
so this is a classic
study done by Blakemore

00:30:58.623 --> 00:31:02.275
and Van Sluyters in cats showing
that the ability to reverse

00:31:02.275 --> 00:31:06.787
this ocular dominance shift
or this change in physiology

00:31:06.787 --> 00:31:09.829
in the cortex diminishes greatly with age

00:31:09.829 --> 00:31:11.203
so that by eight weeks of age,

00:31:11.203 --> 00:31:13.072
it's very difficult to get a reversal,

00:31:13.072 --> 00:31:16.899
and it's essentially gone
by 12 to 14 weeks of age.

00:31:16.899 --> 00:31:18.188
This same sort of pattern is seen

00:31:18.188 --> 00:31:21.493
in any species that's been looked at.

00:31:21.493 --> 00:31:24.754
So there are problems
with patching therapy

00:31:24.754 --> 00:31:27.362
but these limitations not withstanding,

00:31:27.362 --> 00:31:31.121
they do demonstrate that we
can rejuvenate weak synapses,

00:31:31.121 --> 00:31:33.892
we can rejuvenate these
inputs that previously

00:31:33.892 --> 00:31:37.532
were incapable of provoking a response.

00:31:37.532 --> 00:31:39.243
So what we'd like to do
is understand that process

00:31:39.243 --> 00:31:41.420
a little bit better so
that maybe we can devise

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:43.906
a better way to restore function.

00:31:43.906 --> 00:31:46.695
So to understand where we're gonna go,

00:31:46.695 --> 00:31:47.797
I have to introduce some of

00:31:47.797 --> 00:31:51.016
the simple principles
of synaptic plasticity.

00:31:51.016 --> 00:31:54.248
So the excitatory synapses in our brains

00:31:54.248 --> 00:31:56.201
use glutamate as a neurotransmitter,

00:31:56.201 --> 00:31:59.148
glutamate activates two
types of post-synaptic

00:31:59.148 --> 00:32:02.747
glutamate receptor,
glutamate gated ion channels.

00:32:02.747 --> 00:32:05.969
The AMPA receptor mediates
fast synaptic transmission,

00:32:05.969 --> 00:32:09.355
and the NMDA receptor
is an important trigger

00:32:09.355 --> 00:32:12.558
for modification of synaptic strength.

00:32:12.558 --> 00:32:15.241
And so what we've learned
over 30 or 40 years

00:32:15.241 --> 00:32:19.560
of intensive effort is
that we can indeed modify

00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:21.787
the strength of synaptic transmission

00:32:21.787 --> 00:32:25.287
and we do so by activating NMDA receptors.

00:32:26.344 --> 00:32:28.808
So strong activation of NMDA receptors

00:32:28.808 --> 00:32:32.101
will make a synapse stronger,
and that's a phenomenon

00:32:32.101 --> 00:32:34.760
they call long term potentiation or LTP.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:38.723
Modest activation of NMDA
receptors leads to the reversed

00:32:38.723 --> 00:32:43.438
form of plasticity called
long term depression or LTD.

00:32:43.438 --> 00:32:45.598
And the NMDA receptor
has an unusual property,

00:32:45.598 --> 00:32:48.101
it's actually very sensitive
to how well correlated

00:32:48.101 --> 00:32:50.402
pre and post-snyaptic neurons are,

00:32:50.402 --> 00:32:52.095
so it's strongly correlated activity,

00:32:52.095 --> 00:32:54.472
strongly activates NMDA receptors,

00:32:54.472 --> 00:32:56.811
and you're more likely to
get a synaptic strengthening.

00:32:56.811 --> 00:32:58.282
So this is one fundamental feature

00:32:58.282 --> 00:33:01.273
of what we call bidirectional
synaptic plasticity.

00:33:01.273 --> 00:33:04.349
Another fundamental feature
is that that learning rule

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:08.516
actually is also modifiable
so if neurons are quieted

00:33:10.477 --> 00:33:13.516
for a long period of time,
there's a shift in this function.

00:33:13.516 --> 00:33:16.177
So for example the function
will shift to the left,

00:33:16.177 --> 00:33:18.146
if we put animals in
the dark, for instance,

00:33:18.146 --> 00:33:21.254
this function will shift to
the left in visual cortex

00:33:21.254 --> 00:33:24.412
which has the net effect
of making the potentiation

00:33:24.412 --> 00:33:28.932
more readily observed and making
depression more difficult.

00:33:28.932 --> 00:33:31.506
So we call that property metaplasticity,

00:33:31.506 --> 00:33:34.426
it's a type of homeostatic
plasticity to make sure

00:33:34.426 --> 00:33:38.593
the network of synapses
keeps within a dynamic range.

00:33:39.608 --> 00:33:41.086
So now how are we gonna explain

00:33:41.086 --> 00:33:43.702
this effect of reverse patching?

00:33:43.702 --> 00:33:46.082
So let's go through this again.

00:33:46.082 --> 00:33:49.286
We have a situation where
we have a neuron response

00:33:49.286 --> 00:33:51.551
only to stimulation of one eye.

00:33:51.551 --> 00:33:54.285
This eye has been
functionally disconnected,

00:33:54.285 --> 00:33:57.952
and now we're going to
close that strong eye

00:33:59.110 --> 00:34:01.951
and the first thing that happens
is that the neuron stops,

00:34:01.951 --> 00:34:05.519
loses responsiveness to
the newly deprived eye.

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:08.769
So this is believed to be a consequence

00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:13.598
of these mechanisms of long
term depression, in fact,

00:34:13.598 --> 00:34:16.401
there's very, very good evidence
to support that statement,

00:34:16.401 --> 00:34:20.163
so this initial loss of
responsiveness is due to a demotion

00:34:20.163 --> 00:34:22.898
of the strength of excitatory
synaptic transmission

00:34:22.898 --> 00:34:26.204
from inputs carrying
information to that eye.

00:34:26.204 --> 00:34:28.372
But something else has happened as well.

00:34:28.372 --> 00:34:30.335
The other thing that's
happened is imagine we have

00:34:30.335 --> 00:34:34.200
a situation where the seeing
eye is not strong enough

00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:38.724
to evoke a response and the
strong eye is not seeing.

00:34:38.724 --> 00:34:42.029
So as a consequence the
activity in the cortex falls

00:34:42.029 --> 00:34:44.229
and this is the condition required

00:34:44.229 --> 00:34:46.996
to induce this metaplasticity.

00:34:46.996 --> 00:34:49.968
So eventually what we see is as

00:34:49.968 --> 00:34:51.748
the change in the rules of the game,

00:34:51.748 --> 00:34:54.357
so this function will slide to the left,

00:34:54.357 --> 00:34:57.274
and this will allow the recovery of

00:34:58.257 --> 00:35:01.424
the formerly deprived, now seeing eye.

00:35:02.396 --> 00:35:03.405
It can recover 'cause it's got

00:35:03.405 --> 00:35:07.848
reasonably correlated
activity, it was very weak,

00:35:07.848 --> 00:35:09.991
and now this weak activity
is enough to start to gain

00:35:09.991 --> 00:35:12.991
a toehold and drive the synapses up.

00:35:13.895 --> 00:35:17.135
So I mentioned that there are
issues with patch therapy.

00:35:17.135 --> 00:35:19.337
It's not ideal and the
question is can we use

00:35:19.337 --> 00:35:21.397
these principles of metaplasticity

00:35:21.397 --> 00:35:25.564
to restore function without
resorting to patching?

00:35:26.471 --> 00:35:30.901
Well there's good reason to
believe that that's the case.

00:35:30.901 --> 00:35:34.950
First there have been a couple
of studies done by others

00:35:34.950 --> 00:35:38.515
where they put animals
into complete darkness

00:35:38.515 --> 00:35:41.232
after a period of monocular deprivation.

00:35:41.232 --> 00:35:45.399
So literally one or two
weeks of complete darkness,

00:35:46.687 --> 00:35:49.418
then the animals are
brought back into the light

00:35:49.418 --> 00:35:51.884
with both eyes open and
what they've observed is

00:35:51.884 --> 00:35:53.707
they can get a recovery of vision.

00:35:53.707 --> 00:35:54.982
Could be quite dramatic.

00:35:54.982 --> 00:35:57.229
But it does require weeks of darkness

00:35:57.229 --> 00:35:59.694
and that darkness cannot be interrupted

00:35:59.694 --> 00:36:02.829
even temporarily by light exposure.

00:36:02.829 --> 00:36:05.021
So we wondered if we could do better again

00:36:05.021 --> 00:36:08.661
based on what we knew about
this metaplasticity property.

00:36:08.661 --> 00:36:12.691
So the experiment that we
did was to use an anesthetic

00:36:12.691 --> 00:36:16.412
and inject both eyes with this anesthetic.

00:36:16.412 --> 00:36:19.224
It's an anesthetic called tetrodotoxin.

00:36:19.224 --> 00:36:20.839
But really any drug that would block

00:36:20.839 --> 00:36:22.929
sodium dependent action
potentials would work.

00:36:22.929 --> 00:36:25.321
So essentially what
we're doing is in essence

00:36:25.321 --> 00:36:27.554
we're rebooting the visual system.

00:36:27.554 --> 00:36:28.634
We are turning it off,

00:36:28.634 --> 00:36:32.018
and then we're gonna let
it turn back on again.

00:36:32.018 --> 00:36:35.453
So the rationale here is
that we put this tetrodotoxin

00:36:35.453 --> 00:36:38.733
into the eyes and we block
all impulse activity.

00:36:38.733 --> 00:36:41.268
This curve slides to the
left and this will promote

00:36:41.268 --> 00:36:45.268
the recovery of the weak
input, so what happens?

00:36:46.107 --> 00:36:48.491
Well I wouldn't be telling
you this if it didn't work,

00:36:48.491 --> 00:36:49.565
(audience laughing)

00:36:49.565 --> 00:36:52.479
works beautifully, works
amazingly, amazingly.

00:36:52.479 --> 00:36:55.230
So this is work from mice here,

00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:56.904
so I have to introduce a little bit.

00:36:56.904 --> 00:36:58.202
Essentially the only thing that matters

00:36:58.202 --> 00:37:01.672
is that the blue bars represent
the strength of one eye,

00:37:01.672 --> 00:37:04.768
the eye on the opposite side of the head,

00:37:04.768 --> 00:37:07.541
the contralateral eye, and
the yellow bar represents

00:37:07.541 --> 00:37:10.364
the strength of the other
eye, the ipsilateral eye.

00:37:10.364 --> 00:37:11.790
So if you don't do anything to a mouse,

00:37:11.790 --> 00:37:15.135
the heights of these bars wax and wane,

00:37:15.135 --> 00:37:17.075
but they don't change too much.

00:37:17.075 --> 00:37:20.279
If you monocularly deprive
a mouse, as we've done here,

00:37:20.279 --> 00:37:23.272
it goes from here where
we close the blue eye,

00:37:23.272 --> 00:37:26.727
so this response is depressed,
and it stays depressed.

00:37:26.727 --> 00:37:28.921
Okay, it never recovers spontaneously.

00:37:28.921 --> 00:37:30.798
But if we follow that
monocular deprivation

00:37:30.798 --> 00:37:33.529
with this bilateral
injection of tetrodotoxin

00:37:33.529 --> 00:37:36.516
to turn the eyes off,
when the TTX wears off,

00:37:36.516 --> 00:37:40.599
we see a rapid recovery of
vision to the deprived eye.

00:37:40.599 --> 00:37:44.453
So this is the magic treatment
that we did in the kittens.

00:37:44.453 --> 00:37:48.979
So in these animals tetrodotoxin
was injected bilaterally.

00:37:48.979 --> 00:37:51.888
In this case we did two
injections into both eyes

00:37:51.888 --> 00:37:53.753
because we didn't want
to take any chances,

00:37:53.753 --> 00:37:55.415
but you can see it's just a really

00:37:55.415 --> 00:37:58.469
remarkable recovery of sight.

00:37:58.469 --> 00:38:01.044
And then this is an
example of one experiment

00:38:01.044 --> 00:38:05.558
where initially we failed, we
failed because the injections

00:38:05.558 --> 00:38:07.177
weren't successful and they didn't block

00:38:07.177 --> 00:38:08.887
the pupillary light reflex so we knew

00:38:08.887 --> 00:38:11.335
we hadn't blocked impulse activity.

00:38:11.335 --> 00:38:14.918
We were disappointed,
animal kept maturing,

00:38:15.895 --> 00:38:17.401
we wondered what we were gonna do with it,

00:38:17.401 --> 00:38:19.076
we said ah, let's try it again.

00:38:19.076 --> 00:38:20.855
So we tried it again and now

00:38:20.855 --> 00:38:22.728
at the ripe old age of five months,

00:38:22.728 --> 00:38:26.116
a single injection of TTX and again we saw

00:38:26.116 --> 00:38:28.618
this great recovery, so
we're excited about that

00:38:28.618 --> 00:38:32.128
because it's a brief
manipulation, even very late.

00:38:32.128 --> 00:38:35.328
Just to compare, this is five
months of age or 20 weeks,

00:38:35.328 --> 00:38:37.000
and you can see that's way beyond

00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.040
what's possible with reverse occlusion.

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:44.207
So just to wrap up, we're
seeing recovery at older ages

00:38:45.895 --> 00:38:48.361
than is possible with reverse occlusion.

00:38:48.361 --> 00:38:52.010
Recovery is very rapid, occurs
over the course of a week,

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:55.211
it's 100% complete, and the
recovery of the weak eye

00:38:55.211 --> 00:38:57.171
does not come at the
expense of the strong eye.

00:38:57.171 --> 00:38:59.783
So of course what we wanna
know now is precisely

00:38:59.783 --> 00:39:02.459
how did this retinal activation work,

00:39:02.459 --> 00:39:06.316
and can we actually
translate this knowledge

00:39:06.316 --> 00:39:09.069
into better therapies for human amblyopia?

00:39:09.069 --> 00:39:10.652
And with that, just thank the people

00:39:10.652 --> 00:39:13.763
who did all the work
and our funding sources.

00:39:13.763 --> 00:39:15.170
(audience applauding)

00:39:15.170 --> 00:39:19.147
- I am gonna talk today about identifying

00:39:19.147 --> 00:39:22.018
the genetic underpinning of
autism spectrum disorders.

00:39:22.018 --> 00:39:24.272
And then really wanna talk about that

00:39:24.272 --> 00:39:26.700
as really the foundation
for beginning to understand

00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.968
not only the biology of these disorders

00:39:28.968 --> 00:39:31.955
but also something about
this complex interplay

00:39:31.955 --> 00:39:34.442
of environment and biology
that you've been hearing about

00:39:34.442 --> 00:39:37.323
throughout much of the day today.

00:39:37.323 --> 00:39:38.813
I'm gonna start by just showing

00:39:38.813 --> 00:39:41.673
a video of a child with autism.

00:39:41.673 --> 00:39:43.943
Don't worry about the sound,
in fact it's very hard to hear,

00:39:43.943 --> 00:39:48.110
but not having the sound
hopefully also makes a point.

00:39:49.305 --> 00:39:50.890
You don't need clinical
training, I don't think,

00:39:50.890 --> 00:39:53.927
to be able to identify really
what is the sine qua non

00:39:53.927 --> 00:39:56.737
of the diagnosis of autism which
is a fundamental impairment

00:39:56.737 --> 00:39:59.007
in reciprocal social communication,

00:39:59.007 --> 00:40:02.474
so I think you can tell
that this is a young man

00:40:02.474 --> 00:40:07.142
who is certainly not typically
developed in that regard,

00:40:07.142 --> 00:40:10.447
in a moment he'll sit down and
start using a picture board

00:40:10.447 --> 00:40:14.351
to communicate and has very
little useful language,

00:40:14.351 --> 00:40:16.528
which is also a hallmark of those

00:40:16.528 --> 00:40:19.700
social communication
deficits that is particularly

00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:23.117
prevalent in more severe cases of autism.

00:40:24.485 --> 00:40:25.752
Also at the beginning you saw,

00:40:25.752 --> 00:40:28.227
I believe that he flapped his hands,

00:40:28.227 --> 00:40:31.700
and the second domain for
the diagnosis is those kinds

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.328
of repetitive behaviors are
highly restricted interest.

00:40:34.328 --> 00:40:37.205
So understanding the
genetics of this syndrome

00:40:37.205 --> 00:40:39.508
despite the fact that we've
known for several decades

00:40:39.508 --> 00:40:42.999
that autism does run in families,

00:40:42.999 --> 00:40:45.971
has been extremely difficult,
we spent much the early part

00:40:45.971 --> 00:40:47.416
of my career spending more time arguing

00:40:47.416 --> 00:40:49.007
about why we couldn't get the same answer,

00:40:49.007 --> 00:40:51.240
than we did in being able
to lay a strong foundation

00:40:51.240 --> 00:40:53.510
for understanding our
biology of the disorder.

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:57.202
Wanna talk to you about the
strategy that my lab chose

00:40:57.202 --> 00:40:59.485
to pursue and a number
of other labs as well,

00:40:59.485 --> 00:41:03.652
which was understanding that
there was this very complex

00:41:04.917 --> 00:41:09.725
set of levels of analysis
potentially to try to address

00:41:09.725 --> 00:41:11.991
from molecule all the
way to complex behavior,

00:41:11.991 --> 00:41:14.313
that our thought was that
if there was a possibility

00:41:14.313 --> 00:41:16.675
that we could go from the complex behavior

00:41:16.675 --> 00:41:20.056
directly to the molecule needed
to get us directly to DNA,

00:41:20.056 --> 00:41:22.524
that that could be
valuable and the foundation

00:41:22.524 --> 00:41:25.316
and then to pull on that
thread to be able to get

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:27.746
to more and more complex
levels of analysis

00:41:27.746 --> 00:41:30.213
and really the whole idea behind this,

00:41:30.213 --> 00:41:32.337
I don't think I could have had a day

00:41:32.337 --> 00:41:34.044
that had a better set up for laying out

00:41:34.044 --> 00:41:36.831
why this was a hypothesis
but the notion if we could

00:41:36.831 --> 00:41:39.822
understand the detailed biology of autism

00:41:39.822 --> 00:41:41.511
and other neurodevelopmental disorders

00:41:41.511 --> 00:41:43.096
that this could give us
the kind of opportunities

00:41:43.096 --> 00:41:45.114
that you've heard about today
with regard to amblyopia

00:41:45.114 --> 00:41:47.972
and neurodegenerative
disorders, et cetera.

00:41:47.972 --> 00:41:50.799
So there are many reasons
why we thought that this

00:41:50.799 --> 00:41:52.940
might be a reasonable strategy among them

00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:56.338
is that in some ways we had
the sense that this was really

00:41:56.338 --> 00:41:57.932
the simplest approach to try to begin

00:41:57.932 --> 00:42:00.034
to understand something
as complex as autism,

00:42:00.034 --> 00:42:02.730
not a trivial undertaking
to try to find which

00:42:02.730 --> 00:42:05.939
individual changes among
three billion bases in

00:42:05.939 --> 00:42:08.328
the human genome present in every cell

00:42:08.328 --> 00:42:10.416
that has a nucleus, in the nucleus.

00:42:10.416 --> 00:42:14.589
But orders of magnitude
less complex in my view,

00:42:14.589 --> 00:42:16.694
when I was starting my lab,
than a hundred billion neurons

00:42:16.694 --> 00:42:19.126
that make up the human
central nervous system

00:42:19.126 --> 00:42:21.980
and orders of magnitude still less complex

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:26.539
than trying to understand the
hundred trillion connections,

00:42:26.539 --> 00:42:29.598
and you've heard a lot
about synapses today.

00:42:29.598 --> 00:42:32.156
So we decided to take this approach,

00:42:32.156 --> 00:42:34.904
you could call it really
a reductionist approach

00:42:34.904 --> 00:42:37.589
to trying to, as I said,
get at the simplest part

00:42:37.589 --> 00:42:40.003
of the problem and then move forward.

00:42:40.003 --> 00:42:43.442
We did that starting about
10 years ago by focusing

00:42:43.442 --> 00:42:45.329
on something called de novo mutation.

00:42:45.329 --> 00:42:47.240
So when people think about genetics,

00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:50.549
they often think about that as synonymous

00:42:50.549 --> 00:42:52.279
with the transmission of genetic risk

00:42:52.279 --> 00:42:53.750
from one generation to the other

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:55.731
from grandparents to parents to children.

00:42:55.731 --> 00:42:57.568
But it's also the case that a small amount

00:42:57.568 --> 00:42:59.419
of genetic variation is introduced

00:42:59.419 --> 00:43:01.273
into the genome in each generation.

00:43:01.273 --> 00:43:05.594
So there is quite a bit of
variation in the human genome,

00:43:05.594 --> 00:43:07.109
if you turn to your left or your right,

00:43:07.109 --> 00:43:10.717
you are 99% identical to the
person sitting next to you,

00:43:10.717 --> 00:43:13.659
the level of your genome, so
I hope you got a good seat.

00:43:13.659 --> 00:43:14.492
(audience laughing)

00:43:14.492 --> 00:43:15.575
I enjoy mine.

00:43:19.232 --> 00:43:21.999
But within that so even
though it's about 1%,

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:24.596
that's still 30 million
differences that you have

00:43:24.596 --> 00:43:26.550
between you and the person
sitting next to you.

00:43:26.550 --> 00:43:28.609
We were interested in de novo mutation

00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:32.022
for several reasons so the
first is that if a de novo

00:43:32.022 --> 00:43:34.890
of a new mutation which is
introduced at a low rate

00:43:34.890 --> 00:43:37.692
into the genome at every
generation is connected

00:43:37.692 --> 00:43:39.913
with something like a
neurodevelopmental disorder

00:43:39.913 --> 00:43:44.441
to the extent that it has a
significant effect over time,

00:43:44.441 --> 00:43:47.506
it will be eliminated from the
genome by natural selection.

00:43:47.506 --> 00:43:49.352
But for de novo mutation,

00:43:49.352 --> 00:43:51.337
natural selection has
very little time to act.

00:43:51.337 --> 00:43:54.149
So unless the mutation is
lethal in the generation

00:43:54.149 --> 00:43:57.235
in which it's present, you
can have genetic variations,

00:43:57.235 --> 00:43:59.490
mutations that have very
large biological effects

00:43:59.490 --> 00:44:02.021
and still if you can
find a de novo mutation,

00:44:02.021 --> 00:44:06.188
you're able then to be able to
use that as a starting point.

00:44:07.603 --> 00:44:08.934
And if you're interested in genetics

00:44:08.934 --> 00:44:11.419
as a way to understand neurobiology,

00:44:11.419 --> 00:44:14.226
starting with something that
has many, many fold increase

00:44:14.226 --> 00:44:16.675
in risk versus a small
percentage increase in risk,

00:44:16.675 --> 00:44:18.543
seemed like a start strategy.

00:44:18.543 --> 00:44:21.154
This also comported with
the clinical observation for

00:44:21.154 --> 00:44:24.198
many years that many families
come to clinical attention,

00:44:24.198 --> 00:44:26.017
I'm a child psychologist
and can tell you that

00:44:26.017 --> 00:44:28.620
it was observations in our clinic as well,

00:44:28.620 --> 00:44:30.801
that a substantial portion come in

00:44:30.801 --> 00:44:33.376
where there doesn't appear to
be any strong family history

00:44:33.376 --> 00:44:35.686
suggesting that those
families in particular

00:44:35.686 --> 00:44:39.063
might have been vulnerable to
the spontaneous new mutations,

00:44:39.063 --> 00:44:41.565
de novo mutations contributing
to their disorder.

00:44:41.565 --> 00:44:45.127
And then there were two key
papers in 2007 and 2008,

00:44:45.127 --> 00:44:47.544
I think the most relevant one

00:44:50.524 --> 00:44:51.855
and truly a seminal paper was,

00:44:51.855 --> 00:44:53.641
I believe the author was Jonathan Sebat,

00:44:53.641 --> 00:44:55.298
who's a professor here at UCSD,

00:44:55.298 --> 00:44:58.767
showing that de novo
mutations and fine chromosomal

00:44:58.767 --> 00:45:01.920
structure were much more
frequent in kids with autism

00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.247
if they came from a family
without a family history

00:45:04.247 --> 00:45:06.849
than any other group
that they compared to.

00:45:06.849 --> 00:45:09.551
We then got very lucky
and we're able to study

00:45:09.551 --> 00:45:13.096
a group of kids in the
Simons Simplex Collection

00:45:13.096 --> 00:45:15.905
that was designed to
try to help us promote

00:45:15.905 --> 00:45:18.382
these kinds of mutations
and this diagram shows

00:45:18.382 --> 00:45:21.461
really the experimental design
which is to find families

00:45:21.461 --> 00:45:23.403
that look essentially
like they've been hit

00:45:23.403 --> 00:45:25.366
by a bolt of lightening where the blue

00:45:25.366 --> 00:45:27.658
represents unaffected and red affected,

00:45:27.658 --> 00:45:30.185
so to have unaffected parents,
and if there were siblings,

00:45:30.185 --> 00:45:31.882
to have them be unaffected as well,

00:45:31.882 --> 00:45:35.586
and only be able to have
a single affected member

00:45:35.586 --> 00:45:37.997
in the family in order
to be able to participate

00:45:37.997 --> 00:45:41.153
in this cohort and then
what we were able to do then

00:45:41.153 --> 00:45:43.883
is to take a look and compare
the parents to the children,

00:45:43.883 --> 00:45:46.674
and anything that was
present in the children

00:45:46.674 --> 00:45:48.086
that was not present in the parents

00:45:48.086 --> 00:45:50.807
was either a mistake
or a de novo mutation.

00:45:50.807 --> 00:45:52.974
And the second thing that
we were able to do then

00:45:52.974 --> 00:45:54.580
is to compare affected children

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:55.946
to their unaffected siblings.

00:45:55.946 --> 00:45:57.934
So a beautifully controlled
experiment that allows us

00:45:57.934 --> 00:45:59.944
to ask the same question again that

00:45:59.944 --> 00:46:03.113
Jonathan Sebat and Mike Wigler asked.

00:46:03.113 --> 00:46:05.925
I want to give you two
other senses about why

00:46:05.925 --> 00:46:07.594
de novo mutation can be so powerful

00:46:07.594 --> 00:46:09.741
to the extent that it
contributes to disease.

00:46:09.741 --> 00:46:11.128
The first is that I've already told you,

00:46:11.128 --> 00:46:13.013
that there are about
30 million differences

00:46:13.013 --> 00:46:14.600
between you and the person
sitting next to you,

00:46:14.600 --> 00:46:17.566
so you can think about that as
a forest of genetic variation

00:46:17.566 --> 00:46:20.251
and in fact with de novo mutation,

00:46:20.251 --> 00:46:22.889
I love this picture because
it really represents about one

00:46:22.889 --> 00:46:27.628
de novo mutation per
generation in the human genome.

00:46:27.628 --> 00:46:30.594
So out of, in the section of
that that codes for genes,

00:46:30.594 --> 00:46:33.265
so it gives you very strong
signal and noise properties,

00:46:33.265 --> 00:46:35.273
you can really identify where that is

00:46:35.273 --> 00:46:37.757
and you're counting at very
low numbers, and since I,

00:46:37.757 --> 00:46:40.569
like Jay apparently, am
mathematically challenged,

00:46:40.569 --> 00:46:41.918
counting to one is something that

00:46:41.918 --> 00:46:43.694
we've been able to do in the laboratory.

00:46:43.694 --> 00:46:45.438
(audience laughing)

00:46:45.438 --> 00:46:48.170
Now the second thing is
that this is a large area,

00:46:48.170 --> 00:46:49.956
this forest, and we have very few events,

00:46:49.956 --> 00:46:54.298
so we could also leverage a
approach to statistical analysis

00:46:54.298 --> 00:46:56.396
that allowed us really
just to ask the question

00:46:56.396 --> 00:47:00.304
if we saw de novo mutations,
particular spot in the genome,

00:47:00.304 --> 00:47:02.161
if we looked at an unrelated child,

00:47:02.161 --> 00:47:04.770
could we see lightning striking twice?

00:47:04.770 --> 00:47:06.225
So we put those two things together,

00:47:06.225 --> 00:47:09.267
this good signal to noise
ration and this idea

00:47:09.267 --> 00:47:12.310
of recurrence of these very
rare spontaneous events

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:15.846
in order to identify
genes contributing to ASD.

00:47:15.846 --> 00:47:18.733
One of the first findings
that we published in 2011,

00:47:18.733 --> 00:47:22.804
first replicated, Jonathan
Sebat and Mike Wigler had done,

00:47:22.804 --> 00:47:25.223
with about 10 times the sample size,

00:47:25.223 --> 00:47:27.253
which was an enormous relief, I imagine,

00:47:27.253 --> 00:47:29.499
to the entire field given
that psychiatric genetics

00:47:29.499 --> 00:47:31.245
had spent many years, as I said,

00:47:31.245 --> 00:47:33.749
arguing with each other about
why we could not replicate,

00:47:33.749 --> 00:47:36.661
so replication was a pop the cork moment.

00:47:36.661 --> 00:47:39.414
But this finding in particular
in addition to that,

00:47:39.414 --> 00:47:41.994
we were able to identify a
new, small region of the genome

00:47:41.994 --> 00:47:45.374
contributing to ASD,
autism spectrum disorders,

00:47:45.374 --> 00:47:48.392
and that was on chromosome seven.

00:47:48.392 --> 00:47:50.211
And we found that if you had an extra copy

00:47:50.211 --> 00:47:54.085
of the small number of genes
within this chromosomal region,

00:47:54.085 --> 00:47:55.755
there are about 25 that reside there,

00:47:55.755 --> 00:47:58.486
that you would have
classically defined autism,

00:47:58.486 --> 00:47:59.765
and look very much like the child

00:47:59.765 --> 00:48:01.475
that I showed you in the first video.

00:48:01.475 --> 00:48:04.068
We also knew though that
there was another syndrome

00:48:04.068 --> 00:48:08.350
that had previously been
described that was the consequence

00:48:08.350 --> 00:48:11.067
of the loss of exactly the same gene,

00:48:11.067 --> 00:48:13.207
so autism, there were additional copies,

00:48:13.207 --> 00:48:14.778
and in this case there was a loss.

00:48:14.778 --> 00:48:18.888
And I'm gonna show you another
video, here we do need sound.

00:48:18.888 --> 00:48:19.813
- Hello buddy, how are you?

00:48:19.813 --> 00:48:22.447
- I really wanted to see you.

00:48:22.447 --> 00:48:24.511
- Oh, thank you, thank you.

00:48:24.511 --> 00:48:25.784
- What's your favorite color

00:48:25.784 --> 00:48:27.731
and what's your favorite TV show?

00:48:27.731 --> 00:48:29.713
- [Narrator] Kids love to ask questions.

00:48:29.713 --> 00:48:32.054
But not as much as these kids.

00:48:32.054 --> 00:48:34.428
- My favorite color is blue.

00:48:34.428 --> 00:48:35.261
(gasping)

00:48:35.261 --> 00:48:36.554
I have met Barney the dinosaur.

00:48:36.554 --> 00:48:38.352
(kids cheering)

00:48:38.352 --> 00:48:39.185
- Where do you live?

00:48:39.185 --> 00:48:41.010
- I live in New York City.

00:48:41.010 --> 00:48:42.571
- [Boy] Do you have any sons or daughters?

00:48:42.571 --> 00:48:43.433
- I do.
- Wow.

00:48:43.433 --> 00:48:45.313
- I have two daughters and a son.

00:48:45.313 --> 00:48:46.713
- [Narrator] And kids
love to make friends,

00:48:46.713 --> 00:48:48.856
but not like these kids.

00:48:48.856 --> 00:48:50.834
- [Boy] What nationality are you?

00:48:50.834 --> 00:48:51.667
- Italian.

00:48:51.667 --> 00:48:54.615
- [Boy] How old are you, buddy?

00:48:54.615 --> 00:48:57.684
- So that is Williams syndrome.

00:48:57.684 --> 00:48:59.690
A fascinating syndrome, could
spend the rest of the talk

00:48:59.690 --> 00:49:01.415
here and probably several
others telling you

00:49:01.415 --> 00:49:03.167
about how interesting that syndrome is,

00:49:03.167 --> 00:49:05.905
but for the sake of this talk,
what I wanted to point out

00:49:05.905 --> 00:49:08.141
is that again, you don't
need any clinical training

00:49:08.141 --> 00:49:10.081
to see the profound
differences in interest

00:49:10.081 --> 00:49:13.534
in social relations in
affiliation in this group of kids

00:49:13.534 --> 00:49:17.119
versus the example that I
gave you of the first child

00:49:17.119 --> 00:49:19.290
where the core deficit is a failure

00:49:19.290 --> 00:49:22.858
of that reciprocal social communication.

00:49:22.858 --> 00:49:27.568
So when you think about this,
so what I relayed out was

00:49:27.568 --> 00:49:29.271
a hypothesis that you could go from

00:49:29.271 --> 00:49:30.605
a complex behavioral phenotype,

00:49:30.605 --> 00:49:32.762
go to the genome, and
then work your way back.

00:49:32.762 --> 00:49:35.072
I think it would be reasonable
to be skeptical about,

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:38.234
that's a long distance between
a change in a small section

00:49:38.234 --> 00:49:42.355
of the genome going through
molecules, cells, circuits,

00:49:42.355 --> 00:49:46.785
behavior, and brain,
and invoking additional

00:49:46.785 --> 00:49:48.896
things like environment and experience.

00:49:48.896 --> 00:49:51.691
But this gave us a shot
in the arm about thinking

00:49:51.691 --> 00:49:54.817
at least in some cases
this was a viable approach

00:49:54.817 --> 00:49:56.800
because if you do the thought experiment,

00:49:56.800 --> 00:50:00.968
if we could understand what
it was about these 25 genes

00:50:00.968 --> 00:50:03.377
in the genome or the subset
of them that were contributing

00:50:03.377 --> 00:50:05.883
to this difference that
you're looking at a powerful

00:50:05.883 --> 00:50:10.050
(mumbling) of something as
complex as social affiliation.

00:50:11.351 --> 00:50:14.221
As genomic tools advance, we're
able to move from looking at

00:50:14.221 --> 00:50:17.556
segments of the genome, this
fine structure of chromosomes,

00:50:17.556 --> 00:50:20.266
to doing the same experiments
again at much higher

00:50:20.266 --> 00:50:23.021
resolution now to the single
letter of the genetic code

00:50:23.021 --> 00:50:26.134
of all the genes of the
genome simultaneously.

00:50:26.134 --> 00:50:29.499
And what you're looking at
here is a summary from 2015,

00:50:29.499 --> 00:50:32.638
it's giving you now a picture
of all of the reliable genes

00:50:32.638 --> 00:50:34.780
that we've been able to
identify that are contributing

00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:36.775
to autism spectrum disorders, again,

00:50:36.775 --> 00:50:38.923
with a substantial portion of these

00:50:38.923 --> 00:50:41.893
conferring many, many
fold increases in risk.

00:50:41.893 --> 00:50:43.731
They're individually rare in people

00:50:43.731 --> 00:50:45.654
but in the person that they exist,

00:50:45.654 --> 00:50:48.439
they are having profound
biological effects.

00:50:48.439 --> 00:50:49.880
This is Stephan Sanders on the right,

00:50:49.880 --> 00:50:51.516
he was a post doc at the time of the lab,

00:50:51.516 --> 00:50:54.633
now a junior faculty at
UCSF, a brilliant young guy

00:50:54.633 --> 00:50:57.820
who led several of the studies that led to

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.806
this summary statement that
includes not only our work

00:51:00.806 --> 00:51:03.432
but work with laboratories
around the world

00:51:03.432 --> 00:51:07.396
that have replicated both the
initial observations around

00:51:07.396 --> 00:51:11.563
de novo mutations as well as
specific genes shown here.

00:51:14.120 --> 00:51:15.560
So where does that leave us?

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:19.043
Now we've gone from a situation where,

00:51:19.043 --> 00:51:21.999
at least for the first
15 years of my career,

00:51:21.999 --> 00:51:23.619
it was like wandering in the desert,

00:51:23.619 --> 00:51:26.022
I would have given
anything to find a single

00:51:26.022 --> 00:51:27.904
gene associated with
autism spectrum disorder

00:51:27.904 --> 00:51:31.212
that I felt I knew
reliably and now we have

00:51:31.212 --> 00:51:35.379
a series of genes, there are
60 genes that were represented

00:51:36.800 --> 00:51:40.356
in that picture as well as a
number of chromosomal segments.

00:51:40.356 --> 00:51:43.561
So and that reflects only
a small number of the genes

00:51:43.561 --> 00:51:45.503
that we now predict are going to be found

00:51:45.503 --> 00:51:48.348
that can contribute to
autism spectrum disorders.

00:51:48.348 --> 00:51:50.527
This is a version of a diagram, actually,

00:51:50.527 --> 00:51:52.671
that we put together with Pat Levitt

00:51:52.671 --> 00:51:56.049
before the advances that
I've described for you,

00:51:56.049 --> 00:51:58.305
because they have been fairly recent.

00:51:58.305 --> 00:52:01.664
And at the time was aspirational
but it's turned out to be

00:52:01.664 --> 00:52:03.348
actually I think a pretty
good representation

00:52:03.348 --> 00:52:05.708
of where we are and where we're heading.

00:52:05.708 --> 00:52:07.910
So the diagram is supposed
to show the same kind

00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:09.548
of progression where we have genes,

00:52:09.548 --> 00:52:13.390
and there are many of them,
distributed across the genome,

00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:15.875
that then underlie some biology.

00:52:15.875 --> 00:52:18.429
And we hypothesized
before we found the genes

00:52:18.429 --> 00:52:20.391
that they would not be
randomly associated,

00:52:20.391 --> 00:52:23.091
but in fact would point us to
specific biological processes,

00:52:23.091 --> 00:52:24.856
and that has turned out to be the case.

00:52:24.856 --> 00:52:26.526
One of the strongest signals that we have

00:52:26.526 --> 00:52:29.838
is that these mutations
preferentially target genes

00:52:29.838 --> 00:52:32.377
that are involved in synaptic
formation and function.

00:52:32.377 --> 00:52:33.886
There are other broad areas of biology,

00:52:33.886 --> 00:52:35.670
but it's turned out, you've heard all day

00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:37.667
about the importance of
synapses and it turns out

00:52:37.667 --> 00:52:40.874
that they are quite
important for autism as well,

00:52:40.874 --> 00:52:43.890
and somehow that's mediated
through the developing brain,

00:52:43.890 --> 00:52:46.659
this is a picture of the
brain developing in a circle

00:52:46.659 --> 00:52:49.540
from embryo all the
way to developed brain.

00:52:49.540 --> 00:52:52.549
Just to remind you that
while we found some biology,

00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:55.876
that that biology's being
expressed across development

00:52:55.876 --> 00:52:58.770
in the brain and that we don't go

00:52:58.770 --> 00:53:01.632
directly from genes to behavior.

00:53:01.632 --> 00:53:03.987
And that we know that we're
now able to find genes

00:53:03.987 --> 00:53:06.421
that dramatically increase
the risk for autism.

00:53:06.421 --> 00:53:08.778
There's some additional complexities here

00:53:08.778 --> 00:53:11.241
and one of them that we found
right off the bat is that

00:53:11.241 --> 00:53:13.403
while we were finding genes
that were very reliably

00:53:13.403 --> 00:53:16.795
associated with a dramatically
increased risk for autism,

00:53:16.795 --> 00:53:18.707
our colleagues studying
intellectual disability,

00:53:18.707 --> 00:53:21.431
epilepsy, and schizophrenia,
were finding some of

00:53:21.431 --> 00:53:23.552
the exact same regions to the genome.

00:53:23.552 --> 00:53:26.969
So this presents an important but I think

00:53:28.182 --> 00:53:32.349
not only challenging but
optimistic kind of concept

00:53:34.104 --> 00:53:37.521
because you've heard about this notion of

00:53:38.689 --> 00:53:41.135
the potential plasticity
and what this tells us

00:53:41.135 --> 00:53:42.592
is that even if you have a gene,

00:53:42.592 --> 00:53:45.193
that it profoundly increases
the risk for autism,

00:53:45.193 --> 00:53:49.486
that for some people you see
nothing for the first 15,

00:53:49.486 --> 00:53:53.430
18 years of life, suggesting
that genes are not fate

00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:55.239
even ones that carry large risk,

00:53:55.239 --> 00:53:57.459
but somehow that all the
things that we're talking about

00:53:57.459 --> 00:53:59.699
today could potentially be important

00:53:59.699 --> 00:54:02.149
in determining how these
play out over time.

00:54:02.149 --> 00:54:04.252
And this diagram shows at the bottom there

00:54:04.252 --> 00:54:06.234
that there are a variety
of things that you could

00:54:06.234 --> 00:54:09.456
hypothesize might be involved
in that, epigenetics,

00:54:09.456 --> 00:54:14.114
involvement of the cellular
molecular environment,

00:54:14.114 --> 00:54:16.706
other genetic variance
that have smaller effect

00:54:16.706 --> 00:54:20.253
but help dictate how these
large genetic risks play out.

00:54:20.253 --> 00:54:23.043
And potentially for
some individuals, luck,

00:54:23.043 --> 00:54:24.434
but it does also open up this

00:54:24.434 --> 00:54:26.463
notion of potential plasticity.

00:54:26.463 --> 00:54:30.356
Something I also, Mark did a
beautiful job of laying out

00:54:30.356 --> 00:54:33.703
the three hypotheses about the development

00:54:33.703 --> 00:54:35.054
of neurodevelopmental disorders,

00:54:35.054 --> 00:54:38.295
the pessimistic one
and the optimistic one,

00:54:38.295 --> 00:54:40.578
and I think it's important
to keep that in mind,

00:54:40.578 --> 00:54:42.222
particularly in autism,
something where there's a large

00:54:42.222 --> 00:54:43.853
genetic complement and you'd see this

00:54:43.853 --> 00:54:45.539
playing out in very early life.

00:54:45.539 --> 00:54:47.754
It is also the case that
despite the fact that we are

00:54:47.754 --> 00:54:50.754
not anywhere near satisfied with

00:54:50.754 --> 00:54:51.880
the treatments that we're able to provide,

00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:54.461
that kids do improve
with early intervention.

00:54:54.461 --> 00:54:56.524
I think pointing to the
fact that genes are not fate

00:54:56.524 --> 00:54:59.316
and that beginning to use
this body of knowledge

00:54:59.316 --> 00:55:02.844
to understand how this genetic
risk plays out over time,

00:55:02.844 --> 00:55:05.897
leading either to
multiple disorders or not,

00:55:05.897 --> 00:55:10.064
or improving over time is
something that is quite important.

00:55:11.033 --> 00:55:14.380
So I think where we end is
that, at this talk at least,

00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:16.165
but hopefully not in the field,

00:55:16.165 --> 00:55:18.459
is that on the left side of the diagram,

00:55:18.459 --> 00:55:21.540
that we now have made significant progress

00:55:21.540 --> 00:55:23.972
not only in understanding
the genetic substrate

00:55:23.972 --> 00:55:26.667
but beginning to define what
the biological processes are

00:55:26.667 --> 00:55:29.568
and many labs using the kinds
of tools that you heard about

00:55:29.568 --> 00:55:32.320
all day today are now
beginning to place that

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.154
in a developmental context to understand

00:55:34.154 --> 00:55:38.718
the timing of the genetic risk
and how that's playing out.

00:55:38.718 --> 00:55:41.279
I think that leads to, we hope,

00:55:41.279 --> 00:55:44.487
the substrate to begin
to attack these problems

00:55:44.487 --> 00:55:46.159
in the way that you've
been hearing all day,

00:55:46.159 --> 00:55:48.660
that we're attacking
other complex disorders

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:51.428
where the underlying
biology has been more clear

00:55:51.428 --> 00:55:54.597
than it's been for complex
neuropsychiatric disorders.

00:55:54.597 --> 00:55:58.790
And so I wanna end by,
as with everyone else,

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:01.869
I get to stand up and give
the talk and a list of people

00:56:01.869 --> 00:56:04.280
who did all the heavy
lifting and particularly want

00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:06.962
to point to Stephan Sanders
for the remarkable work

00:56:06.962 --> 00:56:08.433
that he's done on gene discovery

00:56:08.433 --> 00:56:11.456
and my collaborators
really around the country

00:56:11.456 --> 00:56:14.524
who have made this work possible.

00:56:14.524 --> 00:56:18.261
And I can't end without also
thanking not only the funders

00:56:18.261 --> 00:56:20.544
but most importantly the
families that contributed

00:56:20.544 --> 00:56:23.386
to the Simons Simplex Collection
that we were able to study

00:56:23.386 --> 00:56:25.943
so productively for the last decade or so.

00:56:25.943 --> 00:56:27.135
Thanks very much.

00:56:27.135 --> 00:56:28.699
(audience applauding)

00:56:28.699 --> 00:56:31.282
(bright music)
