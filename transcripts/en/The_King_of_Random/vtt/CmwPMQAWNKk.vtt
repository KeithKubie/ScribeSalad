00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
Frozen on the outside liquid beverage on the inside very very refreshing hey, what's up guys welcome back

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.670
I got a very cool experiment for you today. You might remember a couple of weeks ago

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.149
I was hanging out in La with my friend Logan Paul, and we tried taking flat Dr.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.340
Pepper putting in a balloon and soaked it in liquid nitrogen

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:16.150
And the effect was amazing

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.430
We ended up creating something was kind of like an icy coconut that had a hard I see shell on the outside

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.959
But when you crack it open had a chilled beverage on the inside, so I thought for this video today

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.679
Why don't we recreate that experiment but using actual coke that way we end up with a coconut see what I did there?

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.009
Now one thing that logan, and I noticed when we were doing this experiment

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:40.378
Originally is that your soda needs to be flat you need to get all the carbonation out of it otherwise it builds pressure and builds

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.509
Weird little formations all over your balloon. So the first step in this experiment is to take our soda and shake it up

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.410
Quick update guys our soda is absolutely flat I poured it into a large pot

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.020
Then I use a mixing meter to mix it around to all the bubbles are gone

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.349
Then I use the funnel to pour it back into the bottle and this is what we've got

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.390
You can see we shake it up now

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.520
hardly any reaction at all

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.309
This is about as flat as our soda can possibly get which is great because now you transfer it to our blimp

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.740
I think for this experiment. I'm going to use for

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.099
This process is going to be pretty simple. We're just going to take the balloon

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.410
we're going to just loop it over the mouth of the bottle and we're going to carefully turn it upside down and squeeze it until

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.569
The balloon fills up to about the size of a coconut

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.220
Then we're just going to disconnect the neck tie it off and slowly dunk it into the nitrogen

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.449
So this is where we get to start experimenting a little bit with how much time it takes to get the best results

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.810
How much time would need to sit in the liquid nitrogen to make the perfect?

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.960
coconut you can put your answers in the comments below, so

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.059
I got my stopwatch ready our liquid nitrogen is ready to go, so I'm just going to hit start and make you dumb

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.110
Loulou so apparently too much nitrogen in there

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.450
I can't dunk it down hauled away, and the balloon is like flapping against the sides because it's all trying to base out

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.450
I think the balloon is actually

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:11.320
Freezing on the bottom and plugging off the soft area look at that. It's going crazy I

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.529
think it's happening as the balloon is actually too wide it's like trapping the gas and so then the gas is like coming out and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.899
The balloons falling down it's building up pressure and coming out and falling down and repeating. It's like the bottom of that's freezing

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.510
But I can't push it down far enough to get the rest

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.609
Look at that if I push it down the balloon. Just like expands

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.510
That's crazy

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.390
Okay, so it's been a little bit over a minute

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.589
I think only the bottom of this is freezing the tops not freezing at all because I think we made the balloon too big

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.170
So we have to do it again, but this time it can be wound a little bit smaller

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.119
So apparently you can actually squish the liquid around and kind of like

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:57.719
Reshape the balloon into the shape that you want make it look a bit nicer

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.109
So I think I'm going to go with that shape there a nice round bottom look at the top

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.989
That's good enough of a coconut for me. Let's mix it up

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.189
We have contact

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.830
I'm just gonna let that go. I don't know how I'm gonna get that out yet

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.040
Update our nitrogen is bubbling away. I'm going to give this about 45 seconds and then pull it out

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:27.679
We're coming up in 25 seconds now because we just want that outer layer frozen we want the inside as liquid as possible

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.649
Let's see how thick 45 seconds gets it

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.510
All right, there's 45 seconds there now the trick is to try and get this out

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.090
There we go

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.360
Oh, you know what I can already feel this isn't quite as solid as I want it to be like it's kind of chunky

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:48.499
But it's not quite frozen yet, so it's going to need a little more time. Let's go in for another minute

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.490
Go ahead and push that out

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.169
There we go that's looking a little more frozen by the way

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.930
This is very cold

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.970
But if I danced it around on my fingertips I can actually hold on to it either freezing

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:11.479
Now the balloon is actually frozen to the coke right now. So I got a pan of warm water

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.450
We're just going to dip that around rotate the balloon a little bit

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.489
And then we should be able to slip the balloon and peel it right off

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.570
Yeah, that loosens the balloon up just enough. It should be able to cut it off

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.410
Not really the best knife will be doing that way

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.660
There we go

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:45.649
That's what we got guys and just get one more bath, and we rinse in warm water here, and there is our coconut

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.239
yeah, that's kind of interesting isn't it so you can definitely see the entire outside of this little ball has frozen solid but just like

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.280
A real coconut this actually still has liquid inside

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.570
So we're to chip away at the shell we could stick in a straw and drink up the liquid inside

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:03.620
Now guys I want to take just a second and give credit where Credit's to my friend, nighthawk

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.049
And light is the one who inspired this idea when he tried using dry ice and alcohol to achieve a very similar effect

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.220
I love that

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.330
We did this with liquid nitrogen

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.120
And I loved it it comes out so clean and perfect the liquids

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.779
100% drinkable the Shell is 100% Edible and who wouldn't want a liquid nitrogen chilled Soda. This is really cool. All right

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.309
So we've seen it about 45 seconds is not enough time two and a half minutes seems to be about perfect

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.429
But we broke it up into three different segments for this third experiment

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.820
I'm going to try two and a half minutes solid with one fresh red balloon

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:41.379
All right here we go for two and a half minutes start

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.998
We're just going to throw that right in and let it go crazy

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.800
Boom there's two and a half minutes. Let's go ahead and take that out. Oh

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:54.909
Kind of frozen to the bottom there. Oh

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:59.830
No look at this so the part that was actually touching the thermos didn't really freeze

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.319
You must have kept it inflated everything else looks great. We're gonna have to put that down and freeze that a little bit there

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:08.199
Something to consider it. I didn't realize I

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:13.599
Know that might actually work on our favorite though because we might not actually have the real hole

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:15.729
Just remove the balloon and stick in the straw

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.240
Look at that

00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:26.409
And of course this doesn't just work on coke you can use it on other sodas as well

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.538
Well that accelerated quickly

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.610
whoa

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.260
All right there. We have the guys. There's two and a half minutes

00:06:54.630 --> 00:07:00.499
You can see even with the rotating we did get a little deformity up here, or it doesn't seem like it's completely solidified

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.040
But that's okay. Go ahead and take the balloon off

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:11.539
It's actually so cold that the layer of water is freezing on the top edge ice I'm going to pull the balloon and off

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:13.910
all the ice breaks off

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.760
So check this out guys. We got our little ball of frozen soda here, and if you look straight on it

00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:25.039
It actually does resemble a coconut those little chunks broke off on the bottom and give it the little coconut eyes

00:07:25.169 --> 00:07:26.100
We flip it around

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:28.429
It looks just like the bottom of a coconut

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.180
And that was made from root beer so theoretically if we crack the shell of this

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:37.790
It'll be very similar to a coconut itself. We can stick a straw down inside and drink up the chilled beverage

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.400
Let's go ahead and crack it open right here

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.429
Go ahead and chip away at the top right here and see we got

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.240
Clout that one does pretty deep

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:54.200
Might have had that one in a little bit too long might work better with the straw and stick that down inside

00:07:58.710 --> 00:08:01.070
That's good. I think I froze that one a little bit too long

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:02.060
It was like three minutes

00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:04.369
And you can see the shell is quite a bit thicker now to that

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:08.450
It almost froze all the way through it looks like a really delicate balance here

00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:13.590
So guys this one

00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.039
I just let run for a minute and a half which is substantially less time than we've done before

00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:22.469
But this time I suspended it in the middle of the nitrogen using a fork so that way it didn't touch the walls at all

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.710
You can see there's still a small deformity here

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:29.279
But the rest of it feels pretty solid let's go ahead and open this one up and see how that turned out. Oh

00:08:29.830 --> 00:08:34.020
Yeah, that's looking good beautiful for that little deformity there. That's kind of funny

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.500
Let’s knock that right off, sweet

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:39.989
So guys check it out. This is the best one. We've got so far

00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.860
I made this out of root beer

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.400
And I think we figured out the secret sauce here you put it in the balloon

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.160
And you suspend it into the thermos in the center without letting it touch the sides let it run for one minute and 30 seconds

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.889
And you end up with something that looks like this the thing

00:08:52.890 --> 00:08:54.840
I love about this idea is you've got a nice chilled beverage

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:56.190
It's going to stay very very cold

00:08:56.190 --> 00:09:00.330
But it's not going to dilute because it's the actual soda itself keeping it cold

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.080
Frozen on the outside Liquid beverage on the inside very very refreshing

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:09.390
And of course if you prefer to have your soda fizzy you can dump out the stuff already in there and pour yourself a fresh batch

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.629
All right next up Fanta

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:18.960
All right, orange just came out. This was 1 minute and 30 seconds exactly which apparently for this one was a little bit premature

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:24.210
You can see most of the shell was frozen, but this little bit here on the end was not

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:29.340
This is still pretty cool because we can actually remove the top and it looks like a cracked coconut and you can literally drink out

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:31.979
of it like a glass if you want the thing to be absolutely frozen

00:09:31.980 --> 00:09:36.960
I think we're looking for somewhere between a minute and a half to two minutes. The orange is nice and the shell

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:39.610
completely edible

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:43.950
So there you have a guys that's how to use some liquid nitrogen and some soda to make yourself an icy cold

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:49.229
Coconut beverage which you can fully enjoy because it's technically food grade and you can eat the shell as well

00:09:50.050 --> 00:09:53.580
Thanks so much for joining us for this experiment. We'll be looking for you the next one. Talk to you then

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.250
Let's see what we got

00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.310
Well, I just like literally exploded in my face look at this

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:05.820
Apparently there was still some carbonation in there or something we got some weird-looking little blemish there

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.520
So look it's refillable as well

00:10:08.920 --> 00:10:11.099
That's Fancy. Oh Dang

00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:12.720
Wow, look at this okay?

00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:18.149
So this is unexpected just look down inside our liquid nitrogen container and look what has four

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.310
It almost looks like the frost froze to the static electricity coming off of it that

00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:24.860
looks crazy

00:10:25.050 --> 00:10:29.449
