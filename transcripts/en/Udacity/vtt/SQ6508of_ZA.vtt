00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
In this problem, we're given a dictionary where the keys are children

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the values are a list of parents,

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and given a person, we want to go through the dictionary,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and calculate a list that contains all of that person's ancestors.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
So let's go over the plan.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
We're going to use recursion.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We're going to find the person that we're searching for in the dictionary.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We're going to add that person's parents, their direct relatives, to the output list,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and then we're going to recurse on the parents to find the ancestors,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
adding the result of this recursive call to our output list.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
This should be enough to get started,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
so let's go right to the editor.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
If the person we're searching for is in the genealogy dictionary,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
we're going to do what we described previously.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
If they're not in the dictionary, we're going to return an empty list

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
because we don't know any of their ancestors.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
So for each parent, we're going to add their ancestors to the result list,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
and once we're done, we're going to return the result list. And that's it.
