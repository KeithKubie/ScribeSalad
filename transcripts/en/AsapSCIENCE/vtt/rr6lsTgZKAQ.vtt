00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:05.551
Nice guys finish last - at least that’s
how the saying goes. But we’re here to destroy

00:00:05.551 --> 00:00:10.391
this myth and show you with scientific research
and evidence, how nice guys, undoubtedly,

00:00:10.391 --> 00:00:11.391
finish first.

00:00:11.391 --> 00:00:15.491
There’s a neat problem called the The Prisoner’s
Dilemma that has boggled many intelligent

00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:20.431
minds for decades. There are many variations,
but in ours, two people face off against each

00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:25.431
other, with 2 different cards in their hands.
One says “COOPERATE” and the other says

00:00:25.431 --> 00:00:29.421
“DEFECT”. Each round, both players pick
one of the cards and play it face down without

00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:33.141
the other knowing which they’ve chosen.
If both players choose “COOPERATE” then

00:00:33.141 --> 00:00:40.391
they each win $300. If both players play “DEFECT”
they both lose $10. But if one person plays

00:00:40.391 --> 00:00:44.281
“COOPERATE” and the other plays “DEFECT”,
the person who played “DEFECT” wins $500

00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:47.601
and the “COOPERATE” card loses $100.

00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:52.821
So, how is this a dilemma? Well, if I were
to play the card DEFECT, your best move would

00:00:52.821 --> 00:00:57.381
also be DEFECT. Sure, we both lose some money,
but you haven’t lost as much as if you were

00:00:57.381 --> 00:01:02.651
to play COOPERATE. And if I were to play COOPERATE,
your best move would still be to play DEFECT

00:01:02.651 --> 00:01:07.581
- because you would win the most money. So
no matter what the other does, DEFECT is always

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:13.031
our best, most logical move. And yet, if we
both play our smartest move, we will always

00:01:13.031 --> 00:01:18.311
lose - fully knowing that if we had simply
COOPERATED we could have won $300.

00:01:18.311 --> 00:01:22.451
But here’s the really interesting part;
scientists have created computer simulations

00:01:22.451 --> 00:01:26.991
to analyze and discover which strategy is
the best to win the most money over hundreds

00:01:26.991 --> 00:01:31.651
of turns. And the winner was one called “Tit
for Tat”. It was programmed to always start

00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:36.021
with COOPERATE and after that it would copy
the last move of its opponent. So if your

00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:40.651
opponent DEFECTs, then next time you DEFECT.
If they COOPERATE, then you COOPERATE next

00:01:40.651 --> 00:01:45.451
time. Using this method not only helps to
prevent you from getting duped over and over,

00:01:45.451 --> 00:01:50.951
but statistically, leads to the highest earnings
in all simulations, when compared to any other

00:01:50.951 --> 00:01:51.951
strategy.

00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:56.411
Ok so how does this relate to nice guys? Well,
it turns out the top ranked strategies were

00:01:56.411 --> 00:02:00.690
almost all the ones that begin with what the
scientists classified as “nice(ness)”.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.381
That is, they would never be the first to
defect, and would always cooperate first.

00:02:05.381 --> 00:02:09.231
Furthermore, strategies which were quick to
forgive others for deceiving them, and ones

00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:14.481
that were non-envious aka happy when others
won just as much money, were key factors to

00:02:14.481 --> 00:02:18.990
success. On the other hand, the more devious
strategies that tried to trick or defect more

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:24.041
often, while temporarily gaining more, actually
scored worst over the long term. Seriously,

00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:29.440
out of 15 strategies, the top 8 scores came
from those which contained ‘nice’ strategies,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.190
while the bottom 7 were more nasty or devious.
And this niceness, forgiveness and non-envious

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.001
behaviour pays; not only in monetary terms
like our game, but even in the real world,

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:41.500
from an evolutionary perspective.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.350
Shockingly, we can actually see these strategies
right in nature. Many birds, for example,

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.871
must work together to remove ticks in hard
to reach spots - both can cooperate and help

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:55.410
each other out, whereby they both use energy
but also benefit, or one can receive help

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.890
and then not return favour. But it turns out
that selfish birds are completely shunned

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.920
from these communities. Vampire bats, on the
other hand, hunt for blood in the night but

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.520
occasionally don’t find any. To increase
their group success, the ones who do find

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.541
blood will share it with those who don’t,
with the understanding that on their off nights,

00:03:12.541 --> 00:03:16.550
others will help them out. And ultimately,
all the bats are more successful if they carry

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.640
this trait. However, just like the Tit for
Tat strategy, if a bat is selfish and doesn’t

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.730
share, others are less likely to share with
it. Those who are nice are more successful.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:30.981
From an evolutionary perspective, animals
which contain genes that promote nice behaviour

00:03:30.981 --> 00:03:35.560
are likely to have more offspring. It’s
the basic underlying code for altruistic behavior

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.660
- you help me and I’ll help you. And ultimately,
we’ll all do better!

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.410
So while some mean, cut-throat, or envious
people may temporarily exploit and gain from

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.261
others, in the long run, not only nice guys,
but nice people, really do finish first.

00:03:50.261 --> 00:03:53.660
If you want to learn more about the human
condition and altruism, check out the book

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.090
“The Selfish Gene” by Richard Dawkins,
which this episode was based on. And if you

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:02.871
like a good deal on books, especially textbooks,
we’ve teamed up with our friends at slugbooks.com

00:04:02.871 --> 00:04:06.950
to get you the cheapest prices for the books
you need. Seriously, we know how expensive

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.250
textbooks, in particular, can be, so all you
have to do is head to SlugBooks.com/AsapSCIENCE

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.480
and search the ISBN number of the books your
looking for. SlugBooks will then compare prices

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.251
from all across the net, and hopefully save
you some money!

00:04:19.251 --> 00:04:23.681
Don’t forget, our own AsapSCIENCE book is
now on pre-sale too! Links are in the description

00:04:23.681 --> 00:04:26.501
