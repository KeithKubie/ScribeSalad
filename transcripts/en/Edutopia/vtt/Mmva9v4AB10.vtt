00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:20.356
&gt;&gt;Tim: Creating this strong sense

00:00:20.356 --> 00:00:24.706
of community inside our
school empowers our students

00:00:24.796 --> 00:00:27.196
to transform their mentality.

00:00:27.576 --> 00:00:30.816
Creating that positive culture
is something that we've done

00:00:30.816 --> 00:00:31.956
that has been very, very effective.

00:00:39.076 --> 00:00:42.166
&gt;&gt;Every morning we start our school
day with something we call Community.

00:00:42.406 --> 00:00:46.006
And really, that's a celebration
of our students' assets.

00:00:46.516 --> 00:00:48.906
It's stand up in front
of the entire school,

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:50.976
all your classmates, and be applauded.

00:00:53.056 --> 00:00:56.736
&gt;&gt;Gregory: Community is a time for
all the young men to gain some sense

00:00:56.736 --> 00:01:00.376
of self, but also a sense
that you're not in it alone.

00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:04.046
&gt;&gt;Dion: We're able to see one
another's faces every day,

00:01:04.136 --> 00:01:06.776
and we're able to come
together as a family.

00:01:06.776 --> 00:01:11.976
It's the ritual, it's the relationship,
and it's also a little respect.

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:16.336
&gt;&gt;The drums start Community.

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:19.276
We always try to make the
connection with something

00:01:19.276 --> 00:01:22.036
that is historically
significant in their culture.

00:01:23.636 --> 00:01:25.976
So now we're going to
line up, come to order.

00:01:28.256 --> 00:01:28.876
&gt;&gt;Dion: Good morning.

00:01:29.276 --> 00:01:29.946
&gt;&gt;Students: Good morning.

00:01:31.046 --> 00:01:31.966
&gt;&gt;Dion: How are my black
and brown, beautiful

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:35.906
and intelligent young men today?

00:01:35.906 --> 00:01:38.000
Very, very good.

00:01:38.306 --> 00:01:39.976
Let's check in.

00:01:40.046 --> 00:01:43.036
&gt;&gt;Quintin: We check our uniforms to
make sure that we're nice and neat.

00:01:43.436 --> 00:01:45.966
We'll all walk around and
shake each other's hands

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:47.886
and basically greet each other.

00:01:47.886 --> 00:01:53.976
&gt;&gt;Dion: It is time to show
your brother some love.

00:01:56.046 --> 00:01:58.366
&gt;&gt;Gregory: The togetherness,
that's a big part of Community.

00:01:58.366 --> 00:02:03.466
It just gives a different
type of feel to the connection

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:04.726
between student and teacher.

00:02:07.316 --> 00:02:10.326
&gt;&gt;Quintin: Just getting to cooperate
with people and seeing them every day

00:02:10.326 --> 00:02:13.306
and shaking their hands, I start
to get like, "Hey, I know this guy.

00:02:13.416 --> 00:02:14.806
I can't talk to him in the future."

00:02:15.646 --> 00:02:21.186
&gt;&gt;Tim: We like to focus on our young men
as assets, as opposed to the negatives

00:02:21.186 --> 00:02:24.776
that society so often focuses on
when it comes to young black males.

00:02:24.826 --> 00:02:30.636
&gt;&gt;Dion: We're celebrating those young
men who have reached the 4.0 mark.

00:02:30.636 --> 00:02:30.976
Give it up.

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:38.046
&gt;&gt;Teacher: At least three days a week,
we distribute gold ties to our students.

00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:41.546
&gt;&gt;Deveon: If you receive a gold
tie, that means that a teacher

00:02:41.546 --> 00:02:45.586
or staff member has recognized you for
doing something that was exceptional

00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:50.136
over the course of the week, so then
you get to wear a gold tie for a week.

00:02:50.356 --> 00:02:57.166
&gt;&gt;Dion: These young mathematicians have
risen to the occasion when called upon.

00:02:57.526 --> 00:03:02.066
&gt;&gt;Deveon: In my math class, I was seen
as an outstanding student and sometimes

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:05.086
if I see one of my fellow
students struggling,

00:03:05.086 --> 00:03:06.696
I'll try to help them as much as I can.

00:03:07.316 --> 00:03:10.606
&gt;&gt;Lionel: We want to celebrate you
for being excellent in your classes,

00:03:10.876 --> 00:03:15.046
for showing academic growth, for being
a great citizen, for having a commitment

00:03:15.046 --> 00:03:17.826
to doing the right thing, for
getting accepted to college.

00:03:18.146 --> 00:03:21.756
&gt;&gt;Tim: Then we end Community every day
with reciting the Urban Prep creed.

00:03:22.656 --> 00:03:22.976
&gt;&gt;Deveon: We believe.

00:03:28.046 --> 00:03:30.646
&gt;&gt;Tim: The creed was
developed by our first group

00:03:30.746 --> 00:03:32.516
of teachers and administrators.

00:03:32.516 --> 00:03:36.016
We asked ourselves, what do we
want our students to believe?

00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:39.006
And those eighteen lines of
that creed are the answer.

00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:42.706
&gt;&gt;Gregory: It's important that we say
it every morning, so that they get

00:03:42.706 --> 00:03:43.976
in ingrained in their minds.

00:03:46.046 --> 00:03:48.976
&gt;&gt;Gregory: Some students see the
true value in the creed, instantly.

00:03:52.086 --> 00:03:53.966
&gt;&gt;Gregory: And for some, it may be
like, why do we have to say this?

00:03:57.046 --> 00:03:57.976
&gt;&gt;Gregory: It's all about
that maturing and growth.

00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:05.116
&gt;&gt;Timothy: As I was going through it,

00:04:05.116 --> 00:04:07.646
I realized that I was
becoming more responsible,

00:04:07.796 --> 00:04:11.086
and a lot of the core values
that we were drilled every day

00:04:11.086 --> 00:04:13.816
in community were actually
becoming a part of my life.

00:04:14.136 --> 00:04:17.096
&gt;&gt;Teacher: When they leave community,
feeling good about themselves

00:04:17.096 --> 00:04:20.586
and being an Urban Prep student,
it's more likely that they actively

00:04:20.586 --> 00:04:22.566
and positively engage
in the academic process.

00:04:23.196 --> 00:04:27.336
&gt;&gt;Tim: If you create rituals within
your school that are uniquely yours,

00:04:27.676 --> 00:04:30.286
a student feels like they are
part of something special.

00:04:30.796 --> 00:04:33.916
It's an experience they
can't get someplace else.

00:04:34.336 --> 00:04:36.736
&gt;&gt;Lionel: You believe in their
greatness and you celebrate them,

00:04:36.736 --> 00:04:38.946
but you also hold them accountable.

00:04:38.946 --> 00:04:42.636
&gt;&gt;Deveon: If I was to ever slack
off, I know that I have hundreds

00:04:42.636 --> 00:04:44.746
of other people who would
get on me about it.

00:04:45.216 --> 00:04:47.686
We're all brothers so
we just help each other.

00:04:47.686 --> 00:04:48.746
It's all uplifting.
