00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.700
To survive in this high pressured, crazy world

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:15.860
most of us have to become highly

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.840
adept at self-criticism.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.100
We learn how to tell ourselves off for our failures

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.600
and for not working hard or smart enough.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.440
But so good are we at this

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.200
that we're sometimes in danger of falling prey

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:30.580
to an excessive form of self-criticism

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.460
What we might call self-flagellation

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.960
a rather dangerous state which just ushers in

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.860
depression and under-performance.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.620
We might simply lose the will to get out of bed.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.720
For those moments, we need a corrective.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.300
We need to carve out time

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.700
for an emotional state of which many of us are

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.140
profoundly suspicious.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.180
Self-compassion.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.640
We're suspicious because that sounds horribly close to self-pity

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.220
But because depression and self-hatred are serious enemies of a good life,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.660
we need to appreciate the role of self-care

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.320
in a good, ambitious and fruitful life.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.000
To this end

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.900
we can perform what we've called a,

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.900
"self-compassion exercise"

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.580
A structured meditation, lasting 15 minutes or so

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.860
Lying in bed, or perhaps a bath

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.860
Turn over a sequence of thoughts

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.160
that interrupt and correct the flow of

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
your worse self-accusations.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.360
For a time adopt an entire kindly perspective on your setbacks

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.800
The self compassion exercise goes like this:

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:38.520
We're so in love with success

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.060
we fail to notice the scale of the challenges

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.240
we routinely set ourselves.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.820
There is nothing remotely normal about what we've tried to achieve.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.980
We've failed, but given the mountain we were trying to climb,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.000
the conclusion doesn't have to be that we're simply flawless.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.600
We have tricky family histories, we all do.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.160
There were things which happened to us

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.160
at the hands of others which can help

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.840
to explain some of our current troubles.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520
We're not entirely sane or well,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.000
but none of us are.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.340
We weren't well set up to carry out certain tasks

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.740
It isn't wholly our fault in the here and now.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.980
From the media, you'd think everyone

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.980
was rich and famous and successful.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.200
But in reality, undramatic, quiet failure

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.100
is by a huge margin the statistical norm.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.200
We shouldn't tear ourselves apart

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.340
for not managing to be to what were

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.700
in truth, awesome odds.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.820
Tough, self-critical people don't allow themselves

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.820
the indulgence of believing in luck.

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.420
They take responsibility for everything.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.800
They think winners make their own luck

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.920
But they don't for the most part.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.300
Luck is a genuine feature of existence

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.100
We're robbing ourselves of fair concilation

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.940
By believing that we're entirely in control,

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.680
and therefore entirely to blame when we crash.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.680
You are not only your achievements.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.080
Status and material success are one bit of you.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.740
But there are others as well,

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.120
those who loved you in childhood knew this,

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.760
and in their best moments helped you to feel it.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.280
Rehearse the internalized voices of all those

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.660
who have been kind to you.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.160
Bathe in the memory of a laugh

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:43.240
independent of achievement.

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.140
It seems it will never end

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.700
That's not the truth

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.080
It's just how a crisis feels.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.940
You need to reduce expectations to zero

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.320
for a time.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.640
Take each new hour as it comes,

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.820
and without being banal,

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.060
what you need most of all,

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.060
is some rest.
