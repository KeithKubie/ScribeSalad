Speaker 1:          00:00          That's will happen. The Joe Rogan experience. Uh, well listen Corey, you're a bad mother fucker. I appreciate you coming here. It's just fun. It's fun talk. Do you want to talk on more? We did three hours, man, but we talk all MMA to, to me. Let's do it. Okay. Let's talk about a, but who you told me you're going on your first elk hunting trip this year. Yep. Getting out to Montana, Montana. We're part. Is it around? I can't remember. So he gave me the code to put into the DNR site. Are you using the different set because you use it a light set up out there for, but that's for target right here. I got 60 pounds. Just like 62 or 63 and how many grains arrows you a like that's a to 60 yeah, that's a really lie there. Oh Man. I'll use, when I go out there for Elka and I used it at 300 so I got the grizzly stick weighted tips, whatever, 300 grains, that's it.

Speaker 1:          00:52          That's usually what I shoot. 300 grain. I shoot five 25 525 grains. I should pull 84 pounds. I like a the tip and everything and I don't know what it is, but the answer is 300 wait, I don't wait. Yeah, with everything. Yeah. I've have to get to scale how I make my own arrows and the basement and all that. But I just don't have the scale to see how much your way at the end. Are you trying to do that for speed? Is that why you have the light grains? That's just what the guy, my guy an narrows the hats. Hats I'm wearing actually in Vegas. I'm going to connect you to John. Dudley. I mean I know you've already talked to him, but I want to get you guys together next time you're anywhere near here and he's in or if you're in Vegas and he's in Vegas, I'm going to get you guys together and have them coach you and help you.

Speaker 1:          01:33          Cause I already, I already see that. You, you very accurate. You know when we're playing techno hunt, you're, you know, scoring in the vitals every single time, you know, except for one, one little one body, one body shot. But even that's a dead elk where he, where he hit it. But John can help you tremendously. He, he'll, he'll tighten up your shit. You know, I see his videos, I study that stuff all the time. But again, he's like the Mark Henry of archery. I see it. Yeah. And hundred yard shot through the Kettlebell and target that I'll tell her friends all the time. Like I was most amazing thing I've ever seen the hold up this big. He went through an era only operation. Yup. It's like you don't see people shooting like cam is good too, but I'm not saying he couldn't do it, but I don't camp could do it too.

Speaker 1:          02:14          They have a cam to other post videos shooting through kettlebells and it's like some crazy videos too. But I mean it's just that level of commitment where they're just constantly training, constantly doing. And John is also just such a fantastic coach. You know, he's so good at the understanding archery fundamentals and explaining it to you, the positioning and it's very much like martial arts in that we would make a few little changes and it does the world of difference. I'm willing to learn. Yeah. Most of the time I'm learning on the fly, like my dad, we learn how to shoot together and I was like 12 one of his buddies was like, oh, ever did archery, took him to the rain, she got me a browning and I was a kid and you know, I was shooting at it three shooting with him. It's kind of like what I learned was from what he learned. But if you know my

Speaker 2:          02:59          dad, everything other than work, everything is kind of like ghetto guys are calling the ghetto Cabo. We had horses and everything and it was just like the way you see people do it on TV when that was not the way my dad learned how to arrange horses and grab voices and sell them up and everything was kind of ghetto ghetto cow boy, you know? So now when I go back from things I learned and I tell him, cause like you said, you see my answer cause I'm all hunting, you know, playing, fighting. I'm hunting constantly. He was like, where'd you learn is it's just watching videos and I go home with somebody else's instead of talking like I talk about what I know. But most honestly I listened to guys talk and I ask a question like yeah, like I don't know what it is but I make it seem like I do.

Speaker 2:          03:35          But yes. What are you thinking about that and you break it down. I had no clue about that. Learn how to feel dressed. My first deer in Texas with these guys, hero sports, a bunch of veterans, we go out, they asked me and just in case you that's, I got closer gates, you hunting with those guys? We've worked with veterans with amputated legs or mental problems, whatever. Just listening to a store and we kill the deer like they'd been hiding they whole life. They grew up as key. So field dressing and how to call and like you shooting the rifle was like, oh you go to just website and if you got 110 grade a bullet, it shows you here at 300 yards. Aim on this cross here. And like, and I learned different stuff from those guys. Veterans that do this stuff for a living.

Speaker 2:          04:12          They ain't had been in the war and learn how to shoot a gun then God, these are like John, Debbie. I see his videos and his uh, not in school and Knox and what not watching, stuff like that. Like you said, you ever had any coaching? Like what I do is just practice over and over and over and I'm at the range, the owner, Mike K and m, he'll come out and be like, oh, kind of try to turn your head a little bit more. I didn't have kisser button. Put a kisser button though that a forced you to turn your head and you need to be strict with the line straight down and think about pushing his lifeline through and just stuff like that. And I just practice, I guess I'm shooting. I used to shoot at least a hundred miles a day. Like I said, I'll pop that truck bit down, put the radio on your sat there and shoot.

Speaker 2:          04:49          I shot one time so long I couldn't move my neck back the next morning I fell asleep and I woke up. I could not, I was stuck like I didn't even train because I was stuck on my head turned like this cause my neck got tight cause I was crunched up here and doing this like I wasn't supposed to. But it all tightened up. Yeah. And also I'm learning the hard way was like I went Turkey hunting this year, this last week. Archery Turkey. Yeah. Never Been Turkey hunting before. I've only seen on youtube or hurt somebody telling me at the trade show great American outdoors and it just sounds so interesting. And I saw youtube and ordered all the stuff I need decoys and I was teaching myself watching videos knock the first day I slate call him boss called. I don't know. That's not right now. I came to that, now I'll put it on the slate and it sounded like an actual Turkey call. And like I'm good in a week cause I just steady and try. Right. So stuff like that. So I just look forward to fuck with those hex suits. The who

Speaker 1:          05:42          suit you noted as HTCs. It's a, especially with birds, birds, you know, birds can navigate using magnetics. They, they use, they use like the magnetic pole to electromagnetic fields. It's been proven that can register and they see electric sense electromagnetic fields. And they think that birds in particular and, and sea creatures too, like they use it with a scuba divers and, and a spear fishermen and people like that. There's a suit that blocks the electromagnetic signal that your body gives off. And uh, it's PR supposedly particularly effective with Turkeys who, you know, are very, uh, they see very well and they see things movement and they're very, very skiddish and they see any weird shit. They just get the fuck out of there. But, um, this guy, Mike's linkerd, who's one of the guys who created the heck suit, he hunts a turkeys with no blind.

Speaker 1:          06:38          He just sits out in the field with this heck suit on that blocks the electromagnet magnetic signal men. He puts Cammo on over the heck suit and there's videos of him doing this. Man, it's kind of crazy. You know, this is a, I gotta check that. Yeah, this is him sitting there. So he's sitting with this heck suit on right in front of these turkeys. Now, you know, as well as I know that most of the time if you are right in front of a Turkey like that, they'll get the fuck out of Dodge Dakota thing they put over. But he's not, he doesn't have that. They don't got the coin is, hey, yeah, I mean, he's babbling behind the giant body behind him and he's, he's moving. But the idea is that it can't see the electromagnetic signal that you're giving off. There's a lot of videos on it.

Speaker 1:          07:22          It's super controversial, but a Dudley swears by it. John Dudley swears by, and a lot of other folks do too. Um, uh, Shane Dorian. Yeah, I think it does. I think it works for everything. I think animals can sense something. I mean, it's not everything, right? I mean, you still can't be downwind or upwind, you know, if, if you, if you are wind comes and catches them, they're gonna smell you and they're going to get the fuck out of there. But it's a, and what does that, another camera, Jesus Christ. That's a great picture. Like that's a perfect example of how flow works, right? That picture is trip, but you gotta if you try to take that picture of me, you tried that, you're going to see me. It's like a perfect, yeah. And of course, I mean it's the perfect type of leaves, the perfect angle, the perfect lighting.

Speaker 1:          08:11          You know, it's probably fucked with a little, but you know, the, the heck suit is a very controversial thing, but people smarter than me say it works. It really works with sea creatures for some reason with, um, things in the water because you know, animals, they have that a lateral line or fish rather have that lateral line and they, they sense electrical signals that are coming off of a creatures that are in the water. And so scuba divers swear by this fucking the suit. It's interesting stuff. Yeah. Hurt and everything hurt. I'm like, wait, I'll get them to send you some. Yeah, for sure. Well, like I said, I listened to Dudley when it comes to every, I'm, you know, I'm like you, when it comes to martial arts, if someone's teaching me something, I just listened. I don't, I don't second gas. And when a guy is wise's him says that it works, I'm curious about it.

Speaker 2:          09:02          At least try it before I knock. You don't work for me. They like, maybe it's just I'm doing something wrong and then they come and show me and it still don't work. It's gonna like I don't believe it, but if it works, I'm going to have a particular, uh, Cammo company right now. Appreciate thicker CIC is the best. Yeah, I love it. They'll abandon me. I got, they gave me a little pro deal 50% off and that's great. So it worked out. I love it. It's still expensive, but it's worth it. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          09:24          They just have so much engineering and their shit. And guys like John Barklow, the guy was what the designer that does all the protesting and cold weather, and you ever see the cold water immersion test they've done with their shit. He's got a rewarming drilled that he put online explaining to people what you do if you're in cold conditions and you fall into the water, like how to read warm yourself. It's got a whole video where he did it. They jumped into this icy river and then yet, nope. And then clowned out. And you know, the, the suits are designed in a lot of the clothing is designed to allow you to survive and that sort of a situation. But you know, you have to know how to do it, how to go about it. See, here's, there's John and, uh, this guy that he's with and they just dumped it. There's John on the right and they'd dump themselves in this freezing fucking water and then get out. And then they put on sleeping bags and got in the tent. And

Speaker 2:          10:15          let me tell you right now, that's when the Wpas Geo, ah, you're not gonna see no black man, no frozen waters. You can prove [inaudible] brother and no, I was ready to prove a point. Um, well he's educating people though.

Speaker 1:          10:35          See when he was in the military, that's what he did. He taught cold weather survival. He's, he's so thorough too. And you know, and he's one of the reasons why sit cause gear so well engineered and designed because they've got a guy like him that's a telling them how to design things. And he's a hunter too. He hunted with me last year. I hunted elk with him and uh, in Utah,

Speaker 2:          10:57          I'm actually going to get the test out. Like my buddy told me before, like, I promise you thicker, you get that warm and stuff, no matter how coat, you're not going to get cold, like the best shit. So I'm going, uh, Saskatchewan, Canada for white tail in November. Yeah, right. They got and he told me, he say the case, he's like, it's not that bad. It was kind of cool. It was not bad. He was like sometimes like negative two. I'm like, that's fucking back. Are you calling? Right. Well I've got an extra body suit for you so I'm going to get there. Super warm gear and try it out. And he said, if it don't worry, I'll let you use the body suit. But yeah, well you might need the body suit and Saskatchewan is fucking, I'm going to test and see if it really works.

Speaker 2:          11:30          I might see you boys video, check it out. That candidate colds a different cold, you know those people are hardy folks there. You went out there and uh, June for the bear hand. Actually me and my dad in the mornings it was cold. Yeah. And our time day, the sun come out and then we go to the top of the mountain to the sea glass and you know, man fast, like instantly hands froze. I'm in a truck in the heat. He just out there chilling in his t shirt. This is how they do this. Just used to it. Yeah. Now will you, when you were up there was that spot and stalk or, yeah. Yeah. So you catching them when they were coming out of the dens and eating grass have to go up to the top of the view point. That's how my mom and we looked at me, him and my dad, he had the spotting scope and we both from Manaca he said just look for a black guy.

Speaker 2:          12:11          You see something you're telling me. And I put the spotting scope scope on it and see ever see a style or a bear we can get, you don't have something like office hours cut her cubs. We're not shooting us. We only want old males and it's crazy cause it's a 30 minute drive to the top of the mountain. So after we seal it might look like it's right there. It's like like an hour to get down there and we've got a park and they, we still got walked 2030 minutes and hope he's still in that area. You know what I mean? Like I said, we came across elk, we came across cougars, all kinds of stuff, but you get an that bear was gone and we tie back to the truck back to the time we did it all day to like it got dark and take us till midnight, whatever to get home cause it was so far into the mountains and it was great like I said, but it walked in and I had the wrong boots.

Speaker 2:          12:54          I like work boots. My cat stuff was burned in the first day but, and I'm with the head guy is I don't like driving. I was like walking a lot. So we did a whole lot of walk. He's like, I figured you'd be in the UFC fighter. I can test you. I never had a guys athletic as you that's able to walk. Most people are overweight or not athletics. They want to go a little bit and it's time to go to the trip. Like you, I can test you out a lot of cardio man. Those were you telling man, I never been so strong in my life. That's my mom said like Mr Overtime, 25, eight like Bruh, you ain't did it Mama. It's different.

Speaker 1:          13:26          It's different walking up those hills and those guys that get used to it, those very specific muscles that you use when you're constantly hiking up hills that you said you did a black per home before. I did a few in a bow or rifle in um, uh, north of Alberta with uh, my friends, uh, John and Jen, the rivets up there. They've got a great camp up there. I just don't have the time to get away for that many camps, you know? And I prefer elk hunting a year. I'm going to do for this year, for this year or two elk. One axis deer and one mule deer. Now what about Saskatchewan white till you seen those? Fuck, what would you what you do it? Yeah, we'll do it. I'll do it. He do ever want to see, I can't cause I do have something scheduled in November already. Oh, are you telling me when I can sell more than 100 a month? I'll get divorced. My kids will beat me up. I'm on the verge of that already.

Speaker 2:          14:23          I'm on every morning, I get up four o'clock she just put the baby back to sleep. I'm up making noise.

Speaker 1:          14:29          Wish me luck. I'll see you when I get back. I know they don't like it, man. It's funny, but I get it. But it's, it's one of those things that just takes a lot of time. Like if you're going to go on a hunting trip, it's seven days away, you know you have seven days and you're going to be probably somewhere where there's no cell phone signal. But for me, man, it's very valuable for my head. I, I, I've, I recenter out there. I get it man. There's fucking animals chasing deer and did things or trying to survive and it just puts everything in perspective for me when I'm sneaking up on an elk and I'm on Tiptoe tiptoeing through the grass and I'm just trying to get inside like 60 70 yards just to get a good shot off and I'm trying to make sure the wind is ride and I'm not thinking about anything else, man, nothing.

Speaker 1:          15:12          Why draw back? And I sent her my pin and you know on, I put, I'm looking through the peep site and everything's right and the housing's level and I've got my anchor point and I'm pulling up my back muscles and I'm just concentrating on that spot. Aim Small, Ms. Small it all, the whole world goes away. The world goes away and when that Arrow finds that crease and sinks right through the, and you see those fledglings disappear and you're like, ah, we fucking did it. Cause some people will never understand like why would you be happy you killed an animal because it's so hard to do. It's not that you're happy, the animals die, you happy you did it. It's a relief. It's so hard to do. It's like people don't understand like to maintain calmness and stillness when you're drawing on an animal. It's not like a rifle. I've shot things with the rifle and it's not easy. It's more hard than people think it is, but it's way easier than using a bow. It's not even close.

Speaker 2:          16:07          So you've got to draw back without being spotted. Yeah. Then you've got a hold steady. Yup. The rifle was kind of you guys sticks. Fantastic. Put your shoulder. Like I said, it ain't easy but you find a cross hair at once. You get it settled on that pool. I pull it down so they don't see me. So right now I'm starting to shake. I've been held like the one, I hit three minutes and 41 seconds. I had a record and I held his book coming. He kept stopping like I feel my back so I had to get up and I'll put it down. I'm like wobbly and I posted a video after that killed people wonder why I'm so proud of my kids. Like do you know what it's like being 235 pounds, six three in a tree, not being spotted hold or both. You know, hey you going to control your breathing and one role moving my head, if I go to, it's something he see my hat, mood or silhouette, he's gone. It's like literally like I post a video and it looked like a picture, like just me holding and it looked like a picture cause I never moved. Like, I don't think anybody understands how hard it is to be as big as I am all up in the tree with a climber. I'm using the cloud so that's hard too. And Get up and just sit still. The wind blowing everything. You can't sway. You sit, everything has to be right. It's an art to it.

Speaker 1:          17:11          People never know. They'll never know unless they do it. It's one of those things and many people that get mad at people that do it are meat eaters, which drives me crazy. They think there's something wrong with killing wild animals like that. That's the best way to do it because these animals, first of all, they're going to, you're going to get organic, real wild meat. It's better for you. Second of all, like these animals lived a real life. They're not like came in a butcher shop

Speaker 2:          17:39          after I got the band, me and my dad got and we post a picture and uh, his lady, she's in the same stuff in the company and I know she eats meat. I've seen her at a barbecue, her and her husband like pound and burgers. And I posted the picture, shit, I can't believe you are no longer fall. You. How could you dare go in a while and kill a bear to eat it? I said, don't you eat burgers? Out of that, you went and got a cattle that somebody took and chained up and slaughter you rather that than me going out and getting them the most natural way ever. Not only that serious. If you love animals, you got to kill bears because they eat everything. They eat. 50% of all the deer fawns and El Calves, they get killed by bears. 50% of them, like I post a picture of killing a coyote wants and they're like, oh, did you get a coyote?

Speaker 2:          18:24          Didn't do anything to you, but the thing they didn't see. I posted a video a week later I killed the cow as he was chasing down a dope. He was like trying to get him and I, I saw and I swung at him right when he came out. POW flipped him and it was open. I saved the deer's life. Boy y'all saw was the picture of the Kylie. What you can't eat them. Yeah. But I saved the other wildlife. They said you'll never make everybody happy. You can't make anybody happy that doesn't understand hunting, that's for sure. They, they have this perception of it from movies and from a lot of those redneck stupid TV shows where, you know, they just don't, they don't portray hunting in a positive way. And so people get this negative impression about it. But I think with more people like you, elite athletes that are getting into a Bo Jackson is a big bow hunter.

Speaker 2:          19:08          You know, there's a lot of boners now that are, you know, that we're just athletes and they realize like, wow, this is thrilling and exciting and then it's the best meat in the world. So you have so many pros and it's the most, yeah, I think it's the most ethical way to eat meat because you going out and getting it yourself, you're not hiring some supermarket hit man. You're doing it yourself. Right. That's the thing. When my youtube has the main point, ain't no about hunting. It's more like one, a black guy in her community to show her. It was more than just killing. Like I so far the one and now is a Turkey this whole week I'm out there but I didn't kill anything. But it's more showing you that it's more like you see the deer walk up to a few, the sun coming up, the sand going down all this and editing it.

Speaker 2:          19:49          I'm doing it all myself now. Do you think you'll have a career in that after you get done with [inaudible]? I don't. Like I tell when I meet people at the shows that work willing to work with me like I don't know. What do you want? Like I don't want them money or anything. I just want you to help if you can, let me use one of your gear on your thing and I advertise it. I put you a little link at the beginning. Tack the Cam, both creative people. I usually just put a thing on there cause I don't want money but because I'm just a fighter, I'm not a hunter but I love the sport. You know I love hunting and you share, you help advertise whatever. I'm just wanting to get as well as well and on the lamb and fighting. I want the same thing in hunting and with that dudes I had to bring other people cause I see like when I go to the boat shop, people ask all the time like I'm in today.

Speaker 2:          20:27          I was in the hotel on my button like oh you got a gig somewhere without a guitar? Like no, it's a bow and arrow. He said guy say oh and there he look at it. Yeah. Huh. All that. I love hunting. Especially when you see me. Like I told my wife I'm going to first person on Joe Rogan shooting techno thing with Jordan's a do rag or would a bowl. It don't work that way where you're lagging and Jordan, it's very that guy on the streets with sounds. But then you see me with a bow or a gun. I want to be the first guy to ever shoot techno hot wearing a do rag and a bow. You mark and Jordan's will direct wavy. Someone's done that. Before I went to do rack, you might get somebody to do rag [inaudible]. Joe Reg Jones by the do rag. It's true.

Speaker 2:          21:04          I got them both. You've got the Combo, you know what I mean? So that's thing I want people to see what the show, not about hunting. Just you don't have to be the typical what people see. You see country guys, cowboy has cowboy boots, kicked shit kickers and they trucks. I think that's the guy you expect to be a hunter. The guy walk around and came up. I want somebody to see because people find out how like you, I love it. That's it. When people see a top level UFC fight or doing it and they're like, Whoa, really? Like this is life. Yeah, that's, I love that. You love it man. It's, it's, it means a lot to me, man. I I think that positive role models like you are what the sport needs to change people's, but I don't want to say sport cause I don't think hunting is a sport, let's call it a disorder.

Speaker 2:          21:45          A culture to change people's perceptions of it. The positive people like you that are elite athletes and just for people to get a chance to see like, hey, this is the, I mean I'm not encouraging everyone to do it, but I think there's a lot of people that would love that. I've never tried it because they may be don't have an understanding of what it actually is. So if they see you, I'll see the videos. Are you doing like Chad Mendez? We'll deep. He's deepened, but that's all. I love it. He loves it. That's all he wants to do. I mean he basically is fighting to pay for his hunting career, you know? Yeah. Plan. Oh hey found it. I said this is just scouting and stuff. Yeah, but right now I got this in Jersey. Yeah. This is like behind my house I believe.

Speaker 2:          22:23          Yet. Mavens. Huh? It's all a lot of purchase. I can see everybody think everything. I post posted stuff. I got hooked, know a lot of stuff I've got I purchased because that's what I like to use. I'll have maybe even hook you up Brandon Weaver way yet. I actually met him. I met him at the gray. I do it. That's my bottom. Me Great. Like I tried to stuff stand like I'm a purchase this. Oh that's good man. Good for you. They make great shit. I mean, there's a lot of great companies out there. The Guy Filming, he was a teammate of mine that hunts, but when the guy, I talked to frank Yeager, he said he wanted to do it. Somebody gave him a bowl. It's like, give me a boat. I set it up. I'll show you how to get, I got all my guys. Tell them all, send the link.
