00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.004
( intro music )

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:14.714
( applause )

00:00:14.714 --> 00:00:17.016 line:0%
Mount Everest is a place
where I think I found

00:00:17.016 --> 00:00:20.019 line:0%
the most portals to discovery
for myself, personally.

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.888
<i> Everest has been in the news
 quite a bit recently</i>

00:00:22.888 --> 00:00:25.491
<i> chiefly because of a
 huge, devastating avalanche</i>

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:27.693
<i> that took place last April</i>

00:00:27.693 --> 00:00:30.029
where a number of
Nepalese climbers

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.298
predominantly from
the Sherpa ethnic group

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:35.200
were killed in the support of
Western mountaineers.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.236
<i> Of course mountaineering is</i>

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:39.005
<i>certainly by some people's view</i>

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:40.806
<i> almost an indulgent type
 of a sport.</i>

00:00:40.806 --> 00:00:42.508
<i> We're not going to save
 anyone's life doing it.</i>

00:00:42.508 --> 00:00:45.145
<i> We might actually by not
 doing it save our own lives.</i>

00:00:45.978 --> 00:00:47.180
But where we find ourselves

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.348
and certainly what
climbers share,

00:00:49.348 --> 00:00:51.484
I mean, amongst a variety of
different things,

00:00:51.484 --> 00:00:54.620
perhaps a deficient sense of
hygiene amongst others.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.290
But we have this great sense
of wanting to

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.826
impose ourselves
or place ourselves

00:00:59.826 --> 00:01:01.126
in a humble way

00:01:01.126 --> 00:01:04.030
inside this incredible, dynamic,

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.733
ever-changing
present environment.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.401
<i> Now certainly we try to
 overcome this environment,</i>

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:11.704
<i> we try to work
 with this environment.</i>

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:14.240
<i> As athletes we certainly have</i>

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.143
<i> great technical skills,
 the ability to climb rock,</i>

00:01:17.143 --> 00:01:18.378
<i> snow and ice.</i>

00:01:18.378 --> 00:01:20.980
But we also learn
technological skills

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.950
and psychological skills
to match that.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:25.251
Of course the motivation
for this

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:27.453
is something that has been
studied certainly since

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:29.389
the time Everest
was first discovered

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:31.190
and even long before that.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.526
What motivates climbers
to keep going to that place?

00:01:34.526 --> 00:01:36.396
And ultimately we find ourselves

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:38.664
navigating our lives

00:01:38.664 --> 00:01:40.333
through this sense of

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:43.803
eternity coupled
with impermanence.

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:46.239
And this is part of
certainly my Buddhist training,

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.975
that we essentially are
all going to

00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:50.610
have a death of this life.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.744
We're not going to know

00:01:51.744 --> 00:01:54.213
where we're going to move
through into the next one.

00:01:54.213 --> 00:01:55.748
How do we navigate this

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:57.917
on this great path of
self-actualization?

00:01:57.917 --> 00:02:00.519
And certainly people like
the early explorers

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:03.022
going to Mount Everest
in the 1950s.

00:02:03.022 --> 00:02:04.323
George Mallory for one,

00:02:04.323 --> 00:02:07.660
he would've taken this picture
back in the early 1920s.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.895
<i> When they first actually
 reached the mountain.</i>

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:12.565
<i> Of course many people know
 that Mallory was a person who</i>

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:14.366
<i> uttered this great</i>

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.069
<i> four-word phrase</i>

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:19.371
<i>that is derivative of all human
 motivation to climb Everest.</i>

00:02:19.371 --> 00:02:21.441
We go to climb because it's...

00:02:21.441 --> 00:02:23.109
because it is there.

00:02:24.243 --> 00:02:25.811
Little bit cryptic,
don't you think?

00:02:25.811 --> 00:02:27.012
( audience laughter )

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.448
I mean, certainly it's there,
it's the highest point on Earth,

00:02:29.448 --> 00:02:32.184
once, you know,
the cartographers and

00:02:32.184 --> 00:02:34.654
geologists discovered that.

00:02:34.654 --> 00:02:36.088
But Mallory would also
write later,

00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:39.025
"you must understand that
there is something in all of us

00:02:39.025 --> 00:02:41.293
that responds to the challenge
of this mountain

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:43.262
and goes out to meet it.

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:45.464
That the struggle is the
struggle of life itself,

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:47.566
upwards and forever upwards.

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:49.935
<i> And, that's the reason
 why we go.</i>

00:02:49.935 --> 00:02:51.637
<i> For what we take from
 this adventure</i>

00:02:51.637 --> 00:02:53.539
<i> is nothing but sheer joy.</i>

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:56.742
<i> And joy is, after all,
 the object of life.</i>

00:02:56.742 --> 00:02:59.345
<i> We don't live simply
 to eat and make money.</i>

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:02.148
<i> We eat and make money
 so we can enjoy life.</i>

00:03:02.148 --> 00:03:04.050
That is what life means

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.152
and what life is for."

00:03:06.152 --> 00:03:08.621
And you have to understand
that George Mallory's generation

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.257
was nearly decimated
in World War One.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:13.326
Many of the climbers
who went on this,

00:03:13.326 --> 00:03:15.794
these first three forays
to Everest

00:03:15.794 --> 00:03:17.897
were all part of the military,

00:03:17.897 --> 00:03:19.599
had lost friends,
had lost family,

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.668
had lost so many different parts
of their lives.

00:03:22.668 --> 00:03:24.837
Many of them,
many people actually saw

00:03:24.837 --> 00:03:26.405
the Mount Everest expeditions

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:28.942
as a way to
reintegrate themselves

00:03:28.942 --> 00:03:31.811
into their real lives,
to their passionate lives

00:03:31.811 --> 00:03:33.913
to the ones they had
before the war.

00:03:33.913 --> 00:03:37.083
And by going out into this
challenging natural environment

00:03:37.083 --> 00:03:39.018
that they could do this,
that they could succeed.

00:03:39.018 --> 00:03:40.953
It's a very romantic type
of a notion that is

00:03:40.953 --> 00:03:43.790
one that Mallory wrote
extensively about.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.192
<i> Of course my time on Everest
was a bit later than Mallory's.</i>

00:03:47.192 --> 00:03:49.395
<i> I started climbing in 1985.</i>

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:51.764
I had to fail four times

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:53.665
before I was able to
summit and then

00:03:53.665 --> 00:03:55.734
the next seven times
were quite a bit easier

00:03:55.734 --> 00:03:57.570
as a result.

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.438
But for me personally,

00:03:59.438 --> 00:04:01.740
climbing has always been
a tool for self-actualization,

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.810
it's been a way
that I challenge myself

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.077
day in and day out.

00:04:05.077 --> 00:04:06.646
There's always a way
that I can improve,

00:04:06.646 --> 00:04:09.882
there's always a way that I can
rigorously analyze my approach,

00:04:09.882 --> 00:04:11.550
there's always a way I can find

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.753
greater, more collaborative
team members.

00:04:13.753 --> 00:04:15.187
The mountain is
always different.

00:04:15.187 --> 00:04:17.957
The environment
is always changing.

00:04:17.957 --> 00:04:19.225
It's a dynamic environment.

00:04:19.225 --> 00:04:22.361
Many of the challenges
are the same, obviously.

00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:24.263
But, you know,
like Heraclitus said,

00:04:24.263 --> 00:04:27.667
"you never dip your foot
into river twice."

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:30.603
It's always different,
it's consistently changing.

00:04:30.603 --> 00:04:32.972
So this type of environment
is one that requires

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:34.606
a very rigorous approach

00:04:34.606 --> 00:04:36.843
and constant evaluation of it.

00:04:37.777 --> 00:04:40.646
Of course for me
being on Everest,

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:42.381
learning about the
local cultures,

00:04:42.381 --> 00:04:43.649
<i> especially the Sherpa.</i>

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:46.852
<i> People who have lived in this
region for upwards of 400 years.</i>

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:48.154
<i> But we climb with the Sherpa</i>

00:04:48.154 --> 00:04:49.621
<i> and we learn that
 their motivations</i>

00:04:49.621 --> 00:04:51.991
<i> are very different from ours.</i>

00:04:51.991 --> 00:04:54.493
They don't have a shred
of romance.

00:04:54.493 --> 00:04:57.829
They are in some ways
fearful of this place.

00:04:57.829 --> 00:04:59.598
They are also concerned about

00:04:59.598 --> 00:05:01.000
not propitiating the spirits

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.969
by trying to climb to the
rooftop of the world.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:04.770
At least some of the early

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.238
Sherpa involvement on Everest

00:05:06.238 --> 00:05:09.207
certainly back in the 1920s
and even in

00:05:09.207 --> 00:05:12.378
the 1950s, when
Sir Edmund Hillary
went to climb with Tenzing,

00:05:12.378 --> 00:05:14.246
there was still this sense
of fearfulness

00:05:14.246 --> 00:05:16.748
in many of them
that they might somehow be

00:05:16.748 --> 00:05:19.952
violating or some way insulting

00:05:19.952 --> 00:05:22.422
these local gods and spirits.

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.757
But in recent years
Sherpas have

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:27.760
with their burgeoning skills and
their craft on Everest,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.728
they've also taken on

00:05:29.728 --> 00:05:31.964
greater risk
because the pay is good.

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:33.966
<i> And I know that many of them
 have real conflicts</i>

00:05:33.966 --> 00:05:36.202
<i> because they're also Buddhist</i>

00:05:36.202 --> 00:05:37.637
<i> and they realize that</i>

00:05:37.637 --> 00:05:39.571
<i> to actually become</i>

00:05:39.571 --> 00:05:42.375
<i> and to find an incarnation
 as a human being</i>

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:45.311
<i> means that you've led
 a very virtuous life.</i>

00:05:45.311 --> 00:05:47.046
You've been really blessed

00:05:47.046 --> 00:05:49.114
with this great human form.

00:05:49.114 --> 00:05:50.950
His Holiness Dalai Lama said,

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.752
"the likelihood of you
arriving in human form

00:05:53.752 --> 00:05:56.121
is like rising out of the
Pacific Ocean

00:05:56.121 --> 00:05:57.656
with your hand through

00:05:57.656 --> 00:06:00.092
the donut of a life preserver."

00:06:00.092 --> 00:06:02.962
Just with a random rising
through the ocean.

00:06:02.962 --> 00:06:06.432
So, why do you want to take on
that excessive risk?

00:06:06.432 --> 00:06:08.100
Why do you want to threaten

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.404
that human life on your great
path of self-actualization?

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:13.472
Shouldn't you be doing
something like these monks

00:06:13.472 --> 00:06:14.674
who are working towards
the betterment

00:06:14.674 --> 00:06:16.742
of their own communities?

00:06:16.742 --> 00:06:19.278
<i>I've not only been a mountaineer
 on Everest.</i>

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:22.381
<i>I've had the benefit to go into
 the Kingdom of Mustang</i>

00:06:22.381 --> 00:06:24.016
<i> and to do
 archaeological research</i>

00:06:24.016 --> 00:06:27.453
<i> that was featured in the
 Sky Caves article couple
 of years back.</i>

00:06:27.453 --> 00:06:29.455
<i> It's been a great opportunity
 for my family.</i>

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:30.956
<i> You can see my wife here
 who's a filmmaker,</i>

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:32.125
<i> who's a big part of the team</i>

00:06:32.125 --> 00:06:34.260
<i> and my daughter Cleo
 is doing sound recording</i>

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.994
<i> on the back there.</i>

00:06:35.994 --> 00:06:38.597
<i> And we do some work
 with literacy,</i>

00:06:38.597 --> 00:06:41.467
<i> not only in the Everest region
 but also in Mustang.</i>

00:06:41.467 --> 00:06:44.269
<i> We've tried early on
 to instill in our kids</i>

00:06:44.269 --> 00:06:45.871
<i> this great sense of service.</i>

00:06:45.871 --> 00:06:48.173
<i> And to try and to get to know
 and understand</i>

00:06:48.173 --> 00:06:50.042
<i> the local populations.</i>

00:06:50.042 --> 00:06:52.711
You know, a lot of people
have described climbers

00:06:52.711 --> 00:06:54.713
and climbing itself as being

00:06:54.713 --> 00:06:58.617
one of the most celebrated
compulsive obsessive disorders

00:06:58.617 --> 00:06:59.885
that's out there.

00:06:59.885 --> 00:07:01.754
You know, I think throw in
a little bit of narcissism

00:07:01.754 --> 00:07:03.188
and then the bad hygiene,

00:07:03.188 --> 00:07:04.790
you kinda get a pretty good idea

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:06.459
of what most climbers are like.

00:07:06.459 --> 00:07:08.861
<i> But we try to get up
 into these wild places,</i>

00:07:08.861 --> 00:07:12.264
<i> some of which we have to
 climb very difficult rock,</i>

00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:14.300
<i> mostly because
 it has little integrity.</i>

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.902
<i> It's almost like mud.</i>

00:07:15.902 --> 00:07:18.370
<i> So we have to work
 with very primitive tools</i>

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:19.838
<i> and find our way into
 these caves,</i>

00:07:19.838 --> 00:07:21.039
<i> that sometimes are on cliffs</i>

00:07:21.039 --> 00:07:22.841
<i>that are thousands of feet high.</i>

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:26.746
<i> Of course we come out of these
caves having worked in the dust,</i>

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:28.447
<i> having worked in the mud</i>

00:07:28.447 --> 00:07:32.484
<i> and we definitely look like
 we've been put through
 the wringer a bit.</i>

00:07:32.484 --> 00:07:35.954
<i> And so, when that happens
 I have to call in my son Finn,</i>

00:07:35.954 --> 00:07:38.056
<i> and I really send him
 in as well.</i>

00:07:38.056 --> 00:07:40.158
<i> This is a real family type
 of a project</i>

00:07:40.158 --> 00:07:41.793
<i> and we look at our teammates</i>

00:07:41.793 --> 00:07:44.363
<i>as real family members as well.</i>

00:07:44.363 --> 00:07:45.497
<i> See my daughter here,</i>

00:07:45.497 --> 00:07:47.432
<i> she's with
 Dr. Mark Aldenderfer.</i>

00:07:47.432 --> 00:07:49.701
<i> They were unraveling
 one of these</i>

00:07:49.701 --> 00:07:52.471
<i> remarkable gold and silver</i>

00:07:52.471 --> 00:07:54.006
<i> annealed masks</i>

00:07:54.006 --> 00:07:55.273
<i> that we found in one
 of our caves</i>

00:07:55.273 --> 00:07:56.609
<i> in a village known as Samdzong</i>

00:07:56.609 --> 00:07:58.878
<i> which is right up against
 the Tibetan border</i>

00:07:58.878 --> 00:08:02.948
<i> in the Kali Gandaki region of
 the Central Himalaya of Nepal.</i>

00:08:02.948 --> 00:08:05.384
<i>Jacqueline Eng, she's not doing
 a tantric ritual there.</i>

00:08:05.384 --> 00:08:06.919
<i> She's actually
 a bioarchaeologist</i>

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:09.755
<i> and she's studying some of the
 bones to try to get an idea</i>

00:08:09.755 --> 00:08:12.091
<i> of what type of lives
 these people led.</i>

00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:14.293
She looks at bones
almost like a book.

00:08:14.293 --> 00:08:16.795
And she can figure out
by the condition of the bones

00:08:16.795 --> 00:08:18.698
and the type of markings on them

00:08:18.698 --> 00:08:20.465
what the life and health
of that--

00:08:20.465 --> 00:08:22.869
of that individual was
actually like.

00:08:23.802 --> 00:08:26.038
<i>Dr. Christina Warinner who does</i>

00:08:26.038 --> 00:08:27.839
<i> some of the work
 respective to our--</i>

00:08:27.839 --> 00:08:30.509
<i> our genetic extraction
 from teeth,</i>

00:08:30.509 --> 00:08:32.444
<i> who's working right now on</i>

00:08:32.444 --> 00:08:33.779
<i> trying to put together</i>

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:36.081
<i> a genetic genotype
 that gives us an idea</i>

00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:37.750
<i>of where these people are from.</i>

00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.152
And we can have,
I think a better understanding

00:08:40.152 --> 00:08:41.720
of where the origins

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.356
of the original people
inhabiting these places are.

00:08:44.356 --> 00:08:47.559
And we've been able to
help rewrite some of the history

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:49.361
of the peopling of the Himalaya

00:08:49.361 --> 00:08:52.564
and migration through
those incredible mountains.

00:08:52.564 --> 00:08:54.266
<i> So, just to give you an idea</i>

00:08:54.266 --> 00:08:56.369
<i> we are frequently</i>

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:58.838
<i> suspending ourselves
 from ropes, climbing up</i>

00:08:58.838 --> 00:09:01.173
<i> some of these remarkable</i>

00:09:01.173 --> 00:09:04.476
<i> mud-encrusted,
 completely unstable cliffs</i>

00:09:04.476 --> 00:09:06.779
<i> using pneumatic hammer drills,</i>

00:09:06.779 --> 00:09:08.714
<i> using rebar anchors</i>

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:11.149
<i> because the material is
 just so difficult to bind</i>

00:09:11.149 --> 00:09:12.918
<i> and so difficult to anchor in.</i>

00:09:12.918 --> 00:09:14.854
<i> And it's not infrequent that
 we're actually taking</i>

00:09:14.854 --> 00:09:17.856
<i> extreme risk
 getting up into these places</i>

00:09:17.856 --> 00:09:19.691
<i> to try to push back</i>

00:09:19.691 --> 00:09:22.027
<i> on our ignorance,
 to try to push back</i>

00:09:22.027 --> 00:09:24.029
<i>on this yearning for knowledge.</i>

00:09:24.029 --> 00:09:25.564
<i>And ultimately for me personally</i>

00:09:25.564 --> 00:09:27.899
<i> that's where it all is.
 It's about self-actualization</i>

00:09:27.899 --> 00:09:30.102
<i>and it's about acquiring wisdom.</i>

00:09:30.102 --> 00:09:32.538
It's also about inspiring
the next generation,

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:34.673
it's about inspiring
my own children.

00:09:34.673 --> 00:09:36.208
And certainly as a parent,

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:38.811
as a husband, as a son,

00:09:38.811 --> 00:09:41.079
I worry consistently

00:09:41.079 --> 00:09:43.949
about having my kids
in an environment that,

00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:46.284
you know, obviously could be
very threatening.

00:09:46.284 --> 00:09:48.053
By the same token, as a parent

00:09:48.053 --> 00:09:50.089
I don't want to insulate them
so much

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.958
that they never get off
the Xbox or the iPad.

00:09:52.958 --> 00:09:55.828
And I think you parents know
what I'm talking about here.

00:09:55.828 --> 00:09:57.229
So, in any case, I think

00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:59.264
it's really well summarized
in a quote

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:00.666
by one of my favorite climbers.

00:10:00.666 --> 00:10:02.668
His name is Edward Whymper
and in 1865

00:10:02.668 --> 00:10:04.003
he was one of the
first people to climb

00:10:04.003 --> 00:10:06.271
the Matterhorn for
the first time.

00:10:06.271 --> 00:10:08.940
And he said, "Climb if you will,

00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:12.177
<i> but remember
 that strength and courage</i>

00:10:12.177 --> 00:10:15.547
<i> are not without prudence.</i>

00:10:15.547 --> 00:10:18.083
<i> And that a moment's negligence</i>

00:10:18.083 --> 00:10:20.319
<i> can lead to the dissolution
 of happiness</i>

00:10:20.319 --> 00:10:21.787
<i> in a lifetime.</i>

00:10:23.522 --> 00:10:25.424
<i> Take care with each step</i>

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:27.593
<i> and do nothing in haste.</i>

00:10:27.593 --> 00:10:29.527
<i> And from the beginning</i>

00:10:29.527 --> 00:10:32.064
<i> think what may be in the end."</i>

00:10:32.064 --> 00:10:34.533
( applause )

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:37.570
( outro music )
