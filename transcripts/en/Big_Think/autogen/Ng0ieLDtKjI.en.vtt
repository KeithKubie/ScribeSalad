perhaps not easy but but it it would be

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180
perhaps not easy but but it it would be
 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:27.429
perhaps not easy but but it it would be
something that that is above the parties

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439
something that that is above the parties
 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.189
something that that is above the parties
but not so far above the parties that

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
but not so far above the parties that

the parties wouldn't understand what
 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.889
the parties wouldn't understand what

you're saying so it would be something
 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.680
you're saying so it would be something
that would take into consideration say

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
that would take into consideration say
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.530
that would take into consideration say
what both liberals and conservatives

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540
what both liberals and conservatives
 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.830
what both liberals and conservatives
typically argue and give them give each

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840
typically argue and give them give each
 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.010
typically argue and give them give each
of them something to accept or believe

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020
of them something to accept or believe
 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.490
of them something to accept or believe
in and also something to learn or get

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
in and also something to learn or get

in and also something to learn or get
used to that I think is a common good

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440
used to that I think is a common good
 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.900
used to that I think is a common good
and so you could see that the common

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
and so you could see that the common
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.619

good is very rarely practiced or made

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629
good is very rarely practiced or made
 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.740

certain moments for example at the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780
beginning of a war where everyone sees

that this is an urgent challenge but the

that this is an urgent challenge but the
common good is not confined to what is

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450

common good is not confined to what is
urgent it's also what is most important

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930
urgent it's also what is most important
 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.219
urgent it's also what is most important
in the long run and that most people

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229
in the long run and that most people
 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.530

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970

Founding is a political way that was set
down for the long-term good and I think

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759
down for the long-term good and I think
 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.950
down for the long-term good and I think
both parties now look to the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960
both parties now look to the

change according to the political
 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.440
change according to the political
situation at the moment so that's not a

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450
situation at the moment so that's not a
 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.420
situation at the moment so that's not a
complete answer but I do think that

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430

it's an especially in view
 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:12.230
it's an especially in view
and there are people who are thinking

and there are people who are thinking
 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.350
and there are people who are thinking
