00:00:12.648 --> 00:00:16.374
T. Morgan Dixon: I would like to tell you
about the most powerful woman

00:00:16.398 --> 00:00:17.728
you've never heard of.

00:00:19.017 --> 00:00:21.102
This is Septima Clark.

00:00:21.126 --> 00:00:22.910
Remember her name: Septima Clark.

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:26.671
Dr. King called her the "the architect
of the civil rights movement,"

00:00:26.695 --> 00:00:29.362
because she created something
called Citizenship Schools.

00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:32.602
And in those schools, she taught
ordinary women the practical skills

00:00:32.626 --> 00:00:35.810
to go back into their communities
and teach people to read.

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:37.882
Because if they could read,

00:00:37.906 --> 00:00:39.056
they could vote.

00:00:39.383 --> 00:00:41.698
Well, these women took
those organizing skills,

00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:44.795
and they became some of the most
legendary civil rights activists

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:46.294
this country has ever seen.

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:48.479
Women like Diane Nash.

00:00:49.092 --> 00:00:50.267
You may know her.

00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:53.523
She orchestrated the entire walk
from Selma to Montgomery.

00:00:53.547 --> 00:00:57.247
She was a cofounder of the
Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee,

00:00:57.271 --> 00:00:59.007
and they integrated lunch counters,

00:00:59.031 --> 00:01:00.850
and they created the Freedom Rides.

00:01:00.874 --> 00:01:02.637
Or you may remember Fannie Lou Hamer,

00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:06.097
who sat on the floor
of the Democratic National Convention

00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:08.410
and talked about
being beaten in jail cells

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:11.262
as she registered people
to vote in Mississippi.

00:01:11.286 --> 00:01:13.088
And her most famous student,

00:01:13.112 --> 00:01:14.406
Rosa Parks.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.039
She said Septima Clark
was the one who taught her

00:01:17.063 --> 00:01:19.007
the peaceful act of resistance.

00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:20.258
And when she sat down,

00:01:20.282 --> 00:01:22.880
she inspired a nation to stand.

00:01:24.174 --> 00:01:26.662
These were just three
of her 10,000 students.

00:01:26.686 --> 00:01:29.603
These women stood
on the front lines of change,

00:01:29.627 --> 00:01:31.110
and by doing so,

00:01:31.134 --> 00:01:34.481
they taught people to read
in her Citizenship School model

00:01:34.505 --> 00:01:38.690
and empowered 700,000 new voters.

00:01:38.714 --> 00:01:39.869
And that's not it.

00:01:39.893 --> 00:01:43.091
She created a new culture
of social activism.

00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:47.018
Pete Seeger said it was Septima Clark
who changed the lyrics

00:01:47.042 --> 00:01:48.627
to the old gospel song

00:01:48.651 --> 00:01:50.736
and made the anthem we all know:

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.401
"We Shall Overcome."

00:01:53.467 --> 00:01:55.678
Vanessa Garrison: Now,
many of you may know us.

00:01:55.702 --> 00:01:58.179
We are the cofounders of GirlTrek,

00:01:58.203 --> 00:02:01.932
the largest health organization
for Black women in America.

00:02:02.335 --> 00:02:03.675
Our mission is simple:

00:02:04.292 --> 00:02:05.978
ask Black women,

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.537
80 percent of whom are over
a healthy body weight,

00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:12.910
to walk outside
of their front door every day

00:02:12.934 --> 00:02:16.952
to establish a lifesaving
habit of walking;

00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:21.384
in doing so, ignite a radical movement

00:02:21.408 --> 00:02:24.749
in which Black women reverse
the devastating impacts

00:02:24.773 --> 00:02:26.088
of chronic disease,

00:02:26.112 --> 00:02:28.413
reclaim the streets
of their neighborhoods,

00:02:28.437 --> 00:02:31.242
create a new culture
of health for their families

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:33.975
and stand on the front lines for justice.

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:37.078
Today, all across America,

00:02:37.102 --> 00:02:42.180
more than 100,000 Black women
are wearing this GirlTrek blue shirt

00:02:42.204 --> 00:02:44.611
as they move through their communities --

00:02:44.635 --> 00:02:46.369
a heroic force.

00:02:46.983 --> 00:02:50.157
We walk in the footsteps of Septima Clark.

00:02:50.478 --> 00:02:54.002
She gave us a blueprint for change-making.

00:02:54.852 --> 00:02:57.573
One, to have a bold idea,

00:02:57.597 --> 00:02:59.611
bigger than anyone is comfortable with.

00:02:59.635 --> 00:03:03.774
To two: root down in the cultural
traditions of your community

00:03:03.798 --> 00:03:07.050
and lean heavily on what has come before.

00:03:07.074 --> 00:03:09.580
To three: name it --

00:03:09.604 --> 00:03:13.351
that one thing that everyone
is willing to work hard for;

00:03:13.375 --> 00:03:18.851
a ridiculously simple goal
that doesn't just benefit the individual

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:20.440
but the village around them.

00:03:21.906 --> 00:03:23.069
And to, lastly:

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.240
never ask permission
to save your own life.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.560
It is our fundamental right
as human beings

00:03:31.584 --> 00:03:34.922
to solve our own problems.

00:03:37.578 --> 00:03:41.589
TMD: So to the women all out there
gathered in your living rooms,

00:03:41.613 --> 00:03:44.616
rooting for us, acting crazy
on social media right now --

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.799
we see you.

00:03:45.823 --> 00:03:46.831
(Laughter)

00:03:46.855 --> 00:03:49.293
We see you every day. We love you.

00:03:49.317 --> 00:03:50.666
You are not alone,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.501
and our bigger work starts now.

00:03:53.525 --> 00:03:56.121
VG: You got us onto this stage --

00:03:56.145 --> 00:03:57.649
your leadership;

00:03:57.673 --> 00:04:00.416
auditing blighted streets in Detroit;

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.784
working with hospitals
and health care systems in Harlem;

00:04:03.808 --> 00:04:09.264
praying over the streets of Sacramento,
Charlotte, Brooklyn, Flint

00:04:09.288 --> 00:04:12.190
and every community that has seen trauma;

00:04:12.214 --> 00:04:14.760
changing traffic patterns,
making your streets safer;

00:04:14.784 --> 00:04:16.295
and most importantly,

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:18.948
standing as role models.

00:04:18.972 --> 00:04:22.939
And it all started with
your commitment to start walking,

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:25.658
your agreement to organize
your friends and family

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:28.316
and your belief in our broader mission.

00:04:29.017 --> 00:04:32.067
TMD: It's important to me
that everyone in this room understands

00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:34.428
exactly how change-making
works in GirlTrek.

00:04:34.452 --> 00:04:38.628
One well-trained organizer has the power
to change the behavior

00:04:38.652 --> 00:04:39.873
of 100 of her friends.

00:04:39.897 --> 00:04:41.063
We know that is true,

00:04:41.087 --> 00:04:44.212
because the [1,000] women
blowing up social media right now

00:04:44.236 --> 00:04:49.603
have already inspired
over 100,000 women to walk.

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:55.304
(Applause)

00:04:56.282 --> 00:04:58.000
But that is not nearly enough.

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:02.580
And so our goal
is to create critical mass.

00:05:03.341 --> 00:05:04.611
And in order to do that,

00:05:04.635 --> 00:05:08.975
we have an audacious plan
to scale our intervention.

00:05:09.646 --> 00:05:11.644
A thousand organizers is not enough.

00:05:12.192 --> 00:05:16.218
GirlTrek is going to create
the next Citizenship School.

00:05:16.242 --> 00:05:21.683
And in doing so, we will train
10,000 frontline health activists

00:05:21.707 --> 00:05:24.599
and deploy them into the highest-need
communities in America.

00:05:24.623 --> 00:05:26.697
Because when we do,
we will disrupt disease;

00:05:26.721 --> 00:05:28.580
we will create a new culture of health.

00:05:28.604 --> 00:05:30.962
And what we will do is create
a support system

00:05:30.986 --> 00:05:34.420
for one million Black women
to walk to save their own lives.

00:05:34.785 --> 00:05:39.274
(Applause)

00:05:41.276 --> 00:05:43.725
And our training is unparalleled.

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:45.939
I just want you to imagine.

00:05:45.963 --> 00:05:48.091
It's like a revival, tent-like festival,

00:05:48.115 --> 00:05:51.390
not unlike the civil rights
movement teach-ins.

00:05:51.414 --> 00:05:53.885
And we're going to go
all across the country.

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:56.179
It is the biggest announcement this week:

00:05:56.203 --> 00:05:59.334
Vanessa and I and a team
of masterful teachers,

00:05:59.358 --> 00:06:01.696
all to culminate next year,

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.437
on sacred ground,

00:06:03.461 --> 00:06:05.365
in Selma, Alabama,

00:06:05.389 --> 00:06:11.018
to create a new annual tradition
that we are calling "Summer of Selma."

00:06:11.482 --> 00:06:14.070
VG: Summer of Selma will be
an annual pilgrimage

00:06:14.094 --> 00:06:16.093
that will include a walk --

00:06:16.117 --> 00:06:17.679
54 miles,

00:06:17.703 --> 00:06:20.721
the sacred route from Selma to Montgomery.

00:06:20.745 --> 00:06:23.379
It will also include rigorous training.

00:06:23.403 --> 00:06:24.630
Picture it,

00:06:24.654 --> 00:06:28.750
as women come to learn organizing
and recruitment strategies,

00:06:28.774 --> 00:06:30.682
to study exercise science,

00:06:30.706 --> 00:06:32.447
to take nutrition classes,

00:06:32.471 --> 00:06:34.197
to learn storytelling,

00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:37.291
to become certified
as outdoor trip leaders

00:06:37.315 --> 00:06:39.547
and community advocates.

00:06:40.474 --> 00:06:42.376
TMD: This is going to be unprecedented.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.327
It's going to be a moment in time
like a cultural institution,

00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:46.463
and in fact,

00:06:46.487 --> 00:06:49.139
it's going to be the Woodstock
of Black Girl Healing.

00:06:49.163 --> 00:06:50.833
(Laughter)

00:06:50.857 --> 00:06:53.932
(Applause)

00:06:55.012 --> 00:06:56.266
VG: And the need --

00:06:57.605 --> 00:06:59.421
it's more urgent than ever.

00:07:00.691 --> 00:07:05.088
We are losing our communities'
greatest resource.

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:10.068
Black women are dying in plain sight.

00:07:11.317 --> 00:07:14.318
And not only is no one talking about it,

00:07:15.075 --> 00:07:17.192
but we refuse to acknowledge

00:07:17.216 --> 00:07:21.374
that the source of this crisis
is rooted in the same injustice

00:07:21.398 --> 00:07:24.554
that first propelled
the civil rights movement.

00:07:25.234 --> 00:07:28.941
On December 30 of 2017,

00:07:29.717 --> 00:07:30.957
Erica Garner,

00:07:32.116 --> 00:07:34.451
the daughter of Eric Garner,

00:07:34.475 --> 00:07:37.146
a Black man who died
on the streets of New York

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:38.974
from a police choke hold,

00:07:38.998 --> 00:07:41.300
passed away of a heart attack.

00:07:42.276 --> 00:07:44.574
Erica was just 27 years old,

00:07:44.598 --> 00:07:46.721
the mother of two children.

00:07:47.369 --> 00:07:51.492
She would be one of 137
Black women that day --

00:07:51.516 --> 00:07:54.081
more than 50,000 in the last year --

00:07:54.105 --> 00:07:56.346
to die from a heart-related issue,

00:07:57.159 --> 00:07:59.922
many of their hearts broken from trauma.

00:08:01.431 --> 00:08:06.442
The impacts of stress on Black women

00:08:06.466 --> 00:08:10.294
who send their children and spouses
out the door each day,

00:08:10.318 --> 00:08:13.433
unsure if they will come home alive;

00:08:13.457 --> 00:08:19.767
who work jobs where they are paid 63 cents
to every dollar paid to white men;

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:23.112
who live in communities
with crumbling infrastructure

00:08:23.136 --> 00:08:26.461
with no access
to fresh fruits or vegetables;

00:08:26.485 --> 00:08:29.776
with little to no walkable
or green spaces --

00:08:30.954 --> 00:08:34.800
the impact of this inequality
is killing Black women

00:08:34.824 --> 00:08:39.963
at higher and faster rates
than any other group in the country.

00:08:39.987 --> 00:08:42.176
But that is about to change.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.405
It has to.

00:08:47.537 --> 00:08:49.108
TMD: So let me tell you a story.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:51.501
About three weeks ago --

00:08:52.282 --> 00:08:53.828
many of you may have watched --

00:08:53.852 --> 00:08:57.022
Vanessa and I and a team
of 10 women walked 100 miles

00:08:57.046 --> 00:08:59.077
on the actual Underground Railroad.

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.126
We did it in five days --

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:03.580
five long and beautiful days.

00:09:03.604 --> 00:09:05.447
And the world watched.

00:09:05.821 --> 00:09:08.154
Three million people
watched the live stream.

00:09:08.178 --> 00:09:11.265
Some of you in here,
the influencers, shared the story.

00:09:11.289 --> 00:09:13.716
Urban Radio blasted it across the country.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.293
VG: Even the E! News channel interrupted
a story about the Kardashians --

00:09:17.317 --> 00:09:20.397
which, if you asked us,
is just a little bit of justice --

00:09:20.421 --> 00:09:21.430
(Laughter)

00:09:21.454 --> 00:09:25.376
to report that GirlTrek had made it safely
on our hundred-mile journey.

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:30.219
(Applause)

00:09:32.429 --> 00:09:34.399
TMD: People were rooting for us.

00:09:34.423 --> 00:09:39.163
And they were rooting for us because
in this time of confusion and contention,

00:09:39.187 --> 00:09:43.350
this journey allowed us all to reflect
on what it meant to be American.

00:09:44.548 --> 00:09:47.031
We saw America up close
and personal as we walked.

00:09:47.055 --> 00:09:49.701
We walked through historic towns,

00:09:49.725 --> 00:09:51.246
through dense forest,

00:09:51.270 --> 00:09:53.702
past former plantations.

00:09:53.726 --> 00:09:54.946
And one day,

00:09:55.636 --> 00:09:59.128
we walked into a gas station
that was also a café,

00:09:59.152 --> 00:10:00.520
and it was filled with men.

00:10:01.092 --> 00:10:03.813
They were wearing camo
and had hunting supplies.

00:10:03.837 --> 00:10:07.508
And out front were all of their trucks,
and one had a Confederate flag.

00:10:07.532 --> 00:10:09.391
And so we left the establishment.

00:10:09.415 --> 00:10:12.253
And as we were walking along
this narrow strip of road,

00:10:12.277 --> 00:10:15.789
a few of the trucks reared by us so close,

00:10:16.619 --> 00:10:20.488
and out of their tailpipe
was the specter of mob violence.

00:10:20.512 --> 00:10:21.878
It was unnerving.

00:10:23.232 --> 00:10:24.541
But then it happened.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.777
Right on the border
of Maryland and Delaware,

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.712
we saw a man standing by his truck.

00:10:30.736 --> 00:10:32.175
The tailgate was down.

00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:34.016
He had on a brown jacket.

00:10:34.040 --> 00:10:35.583
He was standing there awkwardly.

00:10:35.607 --> 00:10:38.071
The first two girls in our group,
Jewel and Sandria,

00:10:38.095 --> 00:10:40.300
they walked by because
he looked suspicious.

00:10:40.324 --> 00:10:41.331
(Laughter)

00:10:41.355 --> 00:10:44.008
But the bigger group, we stopped
to give him a chance.

00:10:44.032 --> 00:10:45.741
And he walked up to us and he said,

00:10:45.765 --> 00:10:47.359
"Hi, my name is Jake Green.

00:10:47.746 --> 00:10:49.805
I heard you on Christian
radio this morning,

00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:52.479
and God told me to bring you supplies."

00:10:53.793 --> 00:10:55.627
He brought us water,

00:10:55.651 --> 00:10:56.913
he brought us granola,

00:10:56.937 --> 00:10:58.444
and he brought us tissue.

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:02.476
And we needed tissue because
we had just walked through a nor'easter;

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.791
it was 29 degrees,
it was sleeting on our faces.

00:11:04.815 --> 00:11:09.456
Our sneakers and our socks were frozen
and wet and frozen again.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:13.128
We needed that tissue more
than he could have possibly understood.

00:11:13.152 --> 00:11:14.942
So on that day, in that moment,

00:11:14.966 --> 00:11:18.575
Jake Green renewed
my faith in God for sure,

00:11:18.599 --> 00:11:21.215
but he renewed my faith in humanity.

00:11:22.196 --> 00:11:24.162
We have a choice to make.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:31.024
In America, we can fall further
into the darkness of discord, or not.

00:11:31.048 --> 00:11:32.258
And I am here to tell you

00:11:32.282 --> 00:11:35.007
that the women of GirlTrek
are walking through the streets

00:11:35.031 --> 00:11:37.284
with a light that cannot be extinguished.

00:11:37.308 --> 00:11:40.163
VG: They are also walking
through the streets with a mission

00:11:40.187 --> 00:11:44.687
as clear and as powerful
as the women who marched in Montgomery:

00:11:44.711 --> 00:11:47.158
that disease stops here,

00:11:47.182 --> 00:11:49.491
that trauma stops here.

00:11:50.769 --> 00:11:52.818
And with your support

00:11:52.842 --> 00:11:55.336
and in our ancestors' footsteps,

00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:01.153
these 10,000 newly trained activists
will launch the largest health revolution

00:12:01.177 --> 00:12:03.156
this country has ever seen.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:08.767
And they will return to their communities
and model the best of human flourishing.

00:12:09.675 --> 00:12:11.088
And we --

00:12:11.112 --> 00:12:12.954
we will all celebrate.

00:12:12.978 --> 00:12:15.921
Because like Jake Green understood,

00:12:15.945 --> 00:12:18.463
our fates are intertwined.

00:12:19.321 --> 00:12:21.474
Septima Clark once said,

00:12:22.657 --> 00:12:27.083
"The air has finally gotten to a place
where we can breathe it together."

00:12:28.231 --> 00:12:29.446
And yet,

00:12:30.334 --> 00:12:35.835
the haunting last words of Eric Garner
were: "I can't breathe."

00:12:36.671 --> 00:12:40.358
And his daughter Erica
died at 27 years old,

00:12:40.382 --> 00:12:42.838
still seeking justice.

00:12:42.862 --> 00:12:44.013
So we --

00:12:44.037 --> 00:12:46.947
we're going to keep doing Septima's work

00:12:46.971 --> 00:12:49.375
until her words become reality,

00:12:50.206 --> 00:12:53.603
until Black women are no longer dying,

00:12:55.891 --> 00:12:59.490
until we can all breathe the air together.

00:12:59.895 --> 00:13:01.046
Thank you.

00:13:01.070 --> 00:13:05.793
(Applause)
