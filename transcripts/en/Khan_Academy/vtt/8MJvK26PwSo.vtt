00:00:00.332 --> 00:00:02.280
- [Instructor] We're told
that Amanda read a report

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.820
saying that 49% of teachers
in the United States

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.370
were members of a labor union.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.910
She wants to test whether this holds true

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.910
for teachers in her state,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.270
so she is going to take a
random sample of these teachers

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.390
and see what percent of them

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.160
are members of a union.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.930
Let P represent the proportion of teachers

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.960
in her state that are members of a union.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.760
Write an appropriate set of hypotheses

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.380
for her significance test.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.460
So, pause this video and
see if you can do that.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.370
And let's do it together.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.530
So, what we want to do
for this significance test

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.520
is set up a null hypothesis

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.330
and an alternative hypothesis.

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.069
Now, your null hypothesis

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:48.520
is the hypothesis that
hey, there's no news here,

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.410
it's what you would expect it to be

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.420
and so, if you read a report saying

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:54.780
that 49% of teachers in the United States

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.490
were members of labor unions,

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.890
well, then it would be reasonable to say

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.700
that the null hypothesis,

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.200
the no news here is
that the same percentage

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.440
of teachers in her state are
members of a labor union,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.150
so that percentage, that proportion is P,

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.140
so this would be the null hypothesis,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.120
that the proportion in her state

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.880
is also 49%

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.480
and now what would the alternative be?

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.310
Well, the alternative is that
the proportion in her state

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.360
is not 49%.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.390
This is the thing that
hey, there'd be news here,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.150
there'd be something
interesting to report,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.570
there's something
different about her state.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.440
And how would she use this?

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.240
Well, she would take a sample
of teachers in her state,

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.350
figure out the sample proportion,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.550
figure out the probability of
getting that sample proportion

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.160
if we were to assume that
the null hypothesis is true.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.840
If that probability is lower

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.270
than a threshold which she
should have said ahead of time,

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.740
her significance level,

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.670
then she would reject the null hypothesis

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.290
which would suggest the alternative.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.990
But let's do another example here.

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:02.390
According to a very large poll in 2015,

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:04.760
about 90% of homes in California

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.030
has access to the internet.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.730
Market researchers want to test

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.030
if that proportion is now higher,

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.460
so they take a random sample
of 1,000 homes in California

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.340
and find that 920 or 92% of homes sampled

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.190
have access to the internet.

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.300
Let P represent the proportion
of homes in California

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.540
that have access to the internet.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.870
Write an appropriate set of hypotheses

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.440
for their significance test.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.790
So, once again, pause this video

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.900
and see if you can figure it out.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.270
So, once again, we want
to have a null hypothesis

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:39.020
and we want to have an
alternative hypotheses.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.860
The null hypothesis is that
hey, there's no news here

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.620
and so, that would say that
it's kind of the status quo.

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.650
That the proportion of
people who have internet

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.290
is still the same as the last study.

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.520
It's still the same at 90%

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.740
or I could write 90%

00:02:56.596 --> 00:03:01.490
or I could write 0.9 right over here.

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.980
Now, some of you might have been tempted

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.360
to put 92% there

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.630
but it's very important to realize

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.680
92% is the sample proportion,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.140
that's the sample statistic.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.678
When we're writing these hypotheses,

00:03:11.678 --> 00:03:15.490
these are hypotheses
about the true parameter.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:20.240
What is the true proportion
of homes in California

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:21.770
that now have the internet?

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:24.120
And so, this is about the true proportion.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.850
And so, the alternative here

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:29.060
is that it's now greater than 90%

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.170
or I could say it's greater than 0.9,

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.470
I could have written 90%

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.750
or 0.9 here

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.290
and so, they really in this question

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.190
they wrote this to kind of distract you

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.850
to make you think maybe
I have to incorporate

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:42.300
this 92% somehow

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.220
and once again, how will
they use these hypotheses?

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.750
Well, they will take the sample

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:50.880
in which they got 92% of homes sampled

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.060
had access to the internet,

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.160
so this right over here

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.250
is my sample proportion

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:56.640
and then they're gonna figure out

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.610
well, what's the probability

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:59.360
of getting this sample proportion

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.850
for this sample size

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:01.950
if we were to assume

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.360
that the null hypothesis is true?

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.580
If this probability of getting
this is below thresholds,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.980
below alpha, below our significance level,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.250
then we'll reject the null hypothesis,

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.440
which would suggest the alternative.
