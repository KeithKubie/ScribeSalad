00:00:06.989 --> 00:00:10.157
The victory of the underdog over
the favored team.

00:00:10.157 --> 00:00:13.490
The last minute penalty shot
that wins the tournament.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.334
The high-energy training montages.

00:00:16.334 --> 00:00:19.749
Many people love to glorify victory
on the playing field,

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:21.118
cheer for favorite teams,

00:00:21.118 --> 00:00:22.771
and play sports.

00:00:22.771 --> 00:00:26.903
But here's a question:
Should we be so obsessed with sports?

00:00:26.903 --> 00:00:30.495
Is playing sports actually as good for us
as we make it out to be,

00:00:30.495 --> 00:00:33.834
or just a fun and entertaining pastime?

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:36.464
What does science have to say?

00:00:36.464 --> 00:00:40.561
First of all, it's well accepted that
exercise is good for our bodies and minds,

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:42.427
and that's definitely true.

00:00:42.427 --> 00:00:46.522
Exercising, especially when we're young,
has all sorts of health benefits,

00:00:46.522 --> 00:00:48.150
like strengthening our bones,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:50.997
clearing out bad cholesterol
from our arteries,

00:00:50.997 --> 00:00:55.772
and decreasing the risk of stroke,
high blood pressure, and diabetes.

00:00:55.772 --> 00:00:58.868
Our brains also release a number
of chemicals when we workout,

00:00:58.868 --> 00:01:00.928
including endorphins.

00:01:00.928 --> 00:01:02.149
These natural hormones,

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.903
which control pain and pleasure responses
in the cental nervous system,

00:01:05.903 --> 00:01:10.771
can lead to feelings of euphoria,
or, what's often called, a runner's high.

00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:14.180
Increased endorphins and consistent
physical activity in general

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.240
can sharpen your focus
and improve your mood and memory.

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.047
So does that mean we get just as much
benefit going to the gym five days a week

00:01:22.047 --> 00:01:24.812
as we would joining a team and competing?

00:01:24.812 --> 00:01:27.710
Well, here's where it gets interesting:

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.000
because it turns out that if you can find
a sport and a team you like,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.371
studies show that there are all sorts
of benefits

00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:38.639
that go beyond the physical
and mental benefits of exercise alone.

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:41.680
Some of the most significant
are psychological benefits,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.085
both in the short and long term.

00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:47.900
Some of those come from the communal
experience of being on a team,

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.555
for instance, learning to trust
and depend on others,

00:01:51.555 --> 00:01:53.118
to accept help,

00:01:53.118 --> 00:01:54.242
to give help,

00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:56.804
and to work together towards
a common goal.

00:01:56.804 --> 00:02:00.242
In addition, commitment to a team
and doing something fun

00:02:00.242 --> 00:02:04.587
can also make it easier to establish
a regular habit of exercise.

00:02:04.587 --> 00:02:07.620
School sport participation 
has also been shown

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.964
to reduce the risk of suffering
from depression for up to four years.

00:02:11.964 --> 00:02:16.210
Meanwhile, your self-esteem and confidence
can get a big boost.

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:17.846
There are a few reasons for that.

00:02:17.846 --> 00:02:19.489
One is found in training.

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.379
Just by working and working at skills,

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:24.130
especially with a good coach,

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.592
you reinforce a growth mindset 
within yourself.

00:02:27.592 --> 00:02:30.492
That's when you say, "Even if I can't
do something today,

00:02:30.492 --> 00:02:34.903
I can improve myself through practice
and achieve it eventually."

00:02:34.903 --> 00:02:38.252
That mindset is useful 
in all walks of life.

00:02:38.252 --> 00:02:40.336
And then there's learning through failure,

00:02:40.336 --> 00:02:44.926
one of the most transformative,
long-term benefits of playing sports.

00:02:44.926 --> 00:02:48.402
The experience of coming to terms
with defeat can build the resilience

00:02:48.402 --> 00:02:51.217
and self-awareness necessary 
to manage academic,

00:02:51.217 --> 00:02:52.256
social,

00:02:52.256 --> 00:02:53.780
and physical hurdles.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.575
So even if your team isn't winning
all the time, or at all,

00:02:56.575 --> 00:02:59.125
there's a real benefit to your experience.

00:02:59.125 --> 00:03:01.934
Now, not everyone will enjoy every sport.

00:03:01.934 --> 00:03:04.240
Perhaps one team is too competitive,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.256
or not competitive enough.

00:03:06.256 --> 00:03:09.430
It can also take time to find
a sport that plays to your strengths.

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:11.449
That's completely okay.

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:13.120
But if you spend some time looking,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.068
you'll be able to find a sport
that fits your individual needs,

00:03:17.068 --> 00:03:20.000
and if you do, there are so many benefits.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.409
You'll be a part of 
a supportive community,

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.129
you'll be building your confidence,

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:26.026
you'll be exercising your body,

00:03:26.026 --> 00:03:27.962
and you'll be nurturing your mind,

00:03:27.962 --> 00:03:30.183
not to mention having fun.
