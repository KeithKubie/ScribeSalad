00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.789
This is the third time we've taught the 
Archeology of harvard yard

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:15.829
and this has been by far and away the most
rewarding experience because we found what we were

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:21.490
hoping we might find.  The last thing we just did was eighty- four

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.160
This is a very large stone, larger than the others that we found

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.240
we think it was a dried laid foundation of some sort and they took out most of the materials to use somewhere else

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.240
but this is one of the larger pieces that
they left behind what we are thinking is it is a robbed wall 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.220
trench

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.610
a trends that was filled with building materials
where a Wall had originally stood seventeenth

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.319
century

00:00:47.319 --> 00:00:52.280
building materials in the trench so we believe
it actually might be

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.710
original wall location for the Indian college

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:02.280
we weren't sure if we be able to find anything
directly related to the seventeenth century

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.790
harvard Indian college

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.099
we knew about where it should be

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:10.389
proximate size of the building we knew that
it had been demolished that it had been actually

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:12.660
taken apart in sixteen ninety five

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.490
so they weren't sure if there's going to be
anything at all left

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.260
we've already found a great deal of uh print 
type. We know that the first printing press was in

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:24.080
 the Indian college and

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.510
we've got a lot of really good seventeenth century
pottery markers and pieces of pipe stand that are

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.430
definitely seventeenth century

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.570
so we have material that is definitely associated
with the Indian college and now we think we've

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.670
got the edge of it so it's very exciting and
yeah know how we're going to live with ourselves

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.820
for two years knowing its there

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.970
we're just going to have to be patient

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.109
it's going to build up a lot of excitement
for the next time we 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.359
have class
