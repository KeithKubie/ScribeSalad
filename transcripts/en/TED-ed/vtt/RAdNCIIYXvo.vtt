00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:09.189
About 66 million years ago,

00:00:09.189 --> 00:00:12.825
something terrible happened
to life on our planet.

00:00:12.825 --> 00:00:15.180
Ecosystems were hit with a double blow

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.100
as massive volcanic eruptions filled
the atmosphere with carbon dioxide

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.907
and an asteroid roughly the size
of Manhattan struck the Earth.

00:00:24.907 --> 00:00:29.731
The dust from the impact reduced or
stopped photosynthesis from many plants,

00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:33.946
starving herbivores and the carnivores
that preyed on them.

00:00:33.946 --> 00:00:35.521
Within a short time span,

00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:39.320
three-quarters of the world's species
disappeared forever,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.961
and the giant dinosaurs,

00:00:40.961 --> 00:00:42.536
flying pterosaurs,

00:00:42.536 --> 00:00:43.854
shelled squids,

00:00:43.854 --> 00:00:46.975
and marine reptiles 
that had flourished for ages

00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:49.716
faded into prehistory.

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:53.285
It may seem like the dinosaurs
were especially unlucky,

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:58.247
but extinctions of various severities have
occurred throughout the Earth's history,

00:00:58.247 --> 00:01:00.944
and are still happening 
all around us today.

00:01:00.944 --> 00:01:02.262
Environments change,

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:04.807
pushing some species 
out of their comfort zones

00:01:04.807 --> 00:01:07.832
while creating new opportunities
for others.

00:01:07.832 --> 00:01:12.667
Invasive species arrive in new habitats,
outcompeting the natives.

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:16.047
And in some cases, 
entire species are wiped out

00:01:16.047 --> 00:01:20.841
as a result of activity 
by better adapted organisms.

00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:23.996
Sometimes, however, massive changes
in the environment

00:01:23.996 --> 00:01:27.980
occur too quickly 
for most living creatures to adapt,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.039
causing thousands of species to die off
in a geological instant.

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:34.613
We call this a mass extinction event,

00:01:34.613 --> 00:01:36.871
and although such events may be rare,

00:01:36.871 --> 00:01:39.928
paleontologists have been able 
to identify several of them

00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:42.924
through dramatic changes 
in the fossil record,

00:01:42.924 --> 00:01:46.242
where lineages that persisted
through several geological layers

00:01:46.242 --> 00:01:49.099
suddenly disappear.

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:53.061
In fact, these mass extinctions are used
to divide the Earth's history

00:01:53.061 --> 00:01:55.199
into distinct periods.

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:57.281
Although the disappearance 
of the dinosaurs

00:01:57.281 --> 00:01:59.816
is the best known mass extinction event,

00:01:59.816 --> 00:02:03.747
the largest occurred long before
dinosaurs ever existed.

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:08.805
252 million years ago,
between the Permian and Triassic periods,

00:02:08.805 --> 00:02:14.497
the Earth's land masses gathered together
into the single supercontinent Pangaea.

00:02:14.497 --> 00:02:18.171
As it coalesced, 
its interior was filled with deserts,

00:02:18.171 --> 00:02:22.648
while the single coastline eliminated
many of the shallow tropical seas

00:02:22.648 --> 00:02:25.441
where biodiversity thrived.

00:02:25.441 --> 00:02:28.817
Huge volcanic eruptions 
occurred across Siberia,

00:02:28.817 --> 00:02:31.429
coinciding with very high temperatures,

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:34.583
suggesting a massive greenhouse effect.

00:02:34.583 --> 00:02:36.997
These catastrophes 
contributed to the extinction

00:02:36.997 --> 00:02:40.599
of 95% of species in the ocean,

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.433
and on land, the strange 
reptiles of the Permian

00:02:43.433 --> 00:02:49.421
gave way to the ancestors of the 
far more familiar dinosaurs we know today.

00:02:49.421 --> 00:02:53.412
But mass extinctions are not just a thing
of the distant past.

00:02:53.412 --> 00:02:55.278
Over the last few million years,

00:02:55.278 --> 00:02:58.751
the fluctuation of massive ice sheets
at our planet's poles

00:02:58.751 --> 00:03:01.939
has caused sea levels to rise and fall,

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.221
changing weather patterns
and ocean currents along the way.

00:03:05.221 --> 00:03:08.535
As the ice sheets spread, 
retreated, and returned,

00:03:08.535 --> 00:03:11.728
some animals were either 
able to adapt to the changes,

00:03:11.728 --> 00:03:14.943
or migrate to a more suitable environment.

00:03:14.943 --> 00:03:17.714
Others, however, 
such as giant ground sloths,

00:03:17.714 --> 00:03:19.095
giant hyenas,

00:03:19.095 --> 00:03:22.071
and mammoths went extinct.

00:03:22.071 --> 00:03:23.864
The extinction of these large mammals

00:03:23.864 --> 00:03:29.240
coincides with changes in the climate
and ecosystem due to the melting ice caps.

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.785
But there is also 
an uncomfortable overlap

00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:38.351
with the rise of a certain hominid species
originating in Africa 150,000 years ago.

00:03:38.351 --> 00:03:41.089
In the course of their adaptation
to the new environment,

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:45.273
creating new tools and methods
for gathering food and hunting prey,

00:03:45.273 --> 00:03:50.227
humans may not have single-handedly caused
the extinction of these large animals,

00:03:50.227 --> 00:03:54.026
as some were able to coexist with us
for thousands of years.

00:03:54.026 --> 00:03:55.532
But it's clear that today,

00:03:55.532 --> 00:03:58.722
our tools and methods 
have become so effective

00:03:58.722 --> 00:04:01.777
that humans are no longer reacting
to the environment,

00:04:01.777 --> 00:04:04.093
but are actively changing it.

00:04:04.093 --> 00:04:06.571
The extinction of species 
is a normal occurrence

00:04:06.571 --> 00:04:08.989
in the background of ecosystems.

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:11.760
But studies suggest 
that rates of extinction today

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.174
for many organisms

00:04:13.174 --> 00:04:18.255
are hundreds to thousands of times higher
than the normal background.

00:04:18.255 --> 00:04:22.804
But the same unique ability that makes
humans capable of driving mass extinctions

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:25.448
can also enable us to prevent them.

00:04:25.448 --> 00:04:27.528
By learning about past extinction events,

00:04:27.528 --> 00:04:31.203
recognizing what is happening today
as environments change,

00:04:31.203 --> 00:04:34.714
and using this knowledge to lessen
our effect on other species,

00:04:34.714 --> 00:04:37.859
we can transform humanity's impact
on the world

00:04:37.859 --> 00:04:40.917
from something as destructive
as a massive asteroid

00:04:40.917 --> 00:04:45.046
into a collaborative part
of a biologically diverse future.
