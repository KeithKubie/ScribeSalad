00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.030
In this session we'll continue to build
on concepts that gives us control over

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.740
the flow of our programs.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.510
Specifically, we'll talk
about the switch statement.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.890
Switch statements like if statements
allows us to execute specific

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.490
block of code when certain
conditions are met.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.050
Switch statements are especially useful
when conditioning on multiple values of

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.940
a given variable.
