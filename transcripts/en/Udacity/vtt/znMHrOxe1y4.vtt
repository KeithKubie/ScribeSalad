00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.110
Another type of depression is Seasonal Affective Disorder, or SAD for short.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.374
For most individuals, episodes begin in the fall or winter, and then end when

00:00:08.374 --> 00:00:12.430
spring arrives. This seems to be due to the reduced levels of life that we

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.765
experience during winter or colder seasons. For example, I spent most of my

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:21.489
life living in Michigan. And when winter rolls around, not only does it get

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:26.078
very cold, but it gets dark rather quickly as well. And that is not only due to

00:00:26.078 --> 00:00:29.555
the shorter days that we experience during winter, but also to the cloudy

00:00:29.555 --> 00:00:35.100
weather. We could go for days and days without seeing the sun. Now, I don't

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.782
think I actually had SAD, but I certainly did experience the winter blues. And

00:00:39.782 --> 00:00:43.184
this is a nice example of how we may have some of the symptoms that are similar

00:00:43.184 --> 00:00:46.532
to a disorder, but it doesn't necessarily mean we have the actual disorder

00:00:46.532 --> 00:00:48.711
itself.
