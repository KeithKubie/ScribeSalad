00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.700
GILBERT STRONG: This is the
second video on second order

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.870
differential equations,
constant coefficients,

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.410
but now we have a
right hand side.

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.740
And the first one was free
harmonic motion with a zero,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.790
but now I'm making this motion,
I'm pushing this motion,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:30.020
but at a frequency omega.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:32.580
This is my forcing term.

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.370
So I think I'm having a
forcing frequency, omega,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.150
and remember that for this
one, for the no solution,

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:45.030
there was a natural
frequency omega n.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.400
It's very important
are those close,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:51.260
are those well separated?

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.280
That governs whether the
bridge that you're walking over

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.460
oscillates too much
and eventually falls.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.110
Or in the extreme
case, are they equal?

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:04.260
If omega n is equal to omega
that's called resonance.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.083
Let me put that word in.

00:01:06.083 --> 00:01:06.583
Resonance.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.950
When omega equals omega n.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.680
And we're not going
to deal with today,

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.960
but you should know that
always the formula has an omega

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.440
minus omega n dividing by that.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.620
So if that is 0, if
omega equals omega n

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:31.240
our formula has to change.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.215
Today, this won't happen.

00:01:34.215 --> 00:01:34.714
No.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.190
So what's the formula?

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.360
What is yp?

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.235
I'm looking for a
particular solution.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.220
That's a nice function and
also important in practice.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.190
So I would like to hope that
the particular solution could

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:04.659
be some multiple of
that cosine omega t.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.410
And in this problem
that's possible.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.550
Because if I have a cosine, I've
got a cosine on the right hand

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.500
side, and if that cosine comes
here, it's on the left side,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.620
and the second derivative of
the cosine is, again, a cosine,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.070
I'm going to have a match
of cosine omega t terms.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:31.350
And then I'll just choose
the right number capital Y.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.710
I won't be able to
do that when there's

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.510
a first derivative in there,
because the first derivative

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.990
of cosine will bring in signs.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.800
I'll have a mixture
of cosines and sines

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.910
and then I better
allow for that mixture.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.910
But here I don't have to.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:50.850
There's the forcing function.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.143
Response, this is
the forced response.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.660
I'd like to get used
to that word, response,

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.370
for the solution.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.840
Here's the input, the
response is the output.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.060
So let me just plug
that into the equation

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.380
and find capital Y.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:24.175
So here I have m, second
derivative is going to be a Y,

00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:27.340
and second derivative
will bring out a minus

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.835
omega squared times the cosine.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:42.930
And here I have kY is Y times
the cosine equal the cosine.

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:52.070
I could have a constant
there, but the whole thing

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:59.650
would be no more interesting,
no more difficult than with a 1.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.790
So what do I do?

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.750
The nice thing is here
I have all cosines,

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.870
so I'm just going to have
minus omega squared m and a k.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.800
So it's k minus m omega squared.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.820
Can I write it that way?

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.160
Times Y. I'm going to
cancel the cosines.

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.680
That's just a 1.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.410
On the side is a 1.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.130
I've canceled the
cosine, so I've kept kY.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:34.810
I've kept the 1, and I've
kept a minus omega squared mY.

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.270
So that tells me Y right away.

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.380
It's just like plugging in
an exponential and canceling

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.020
exponentials all the way along.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.740
Here, I'm canceling cosines
all the way because every term

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.080
was a cosine.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.285
So I know Y. So I
know the answer.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:05:01.320
So the final answer
is Y(t) is Yn.

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.910
Well, let me put Y
particular first plus Yn.

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.990
So I've just found Y particular.

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.790
Y particular is this
capital Y cosine omega t.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:22.770
So it's cosine omega t times
Y and Y is 1 over this.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:29.220
Here's goes Y. Down below I
have k minus m omega squared.

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:33.850
Right?

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:36.980
That's what we just found,
that particular solution.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:40.340
The capital Y, the
multiplying constant,

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.800
was 1 over that constant.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:52.470
And now comes the C1
cosine of omega nt

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.395
and the C2 sine of omega nt.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.930
Remember, omega n is
different from omega.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.930
Actually, this is
pretty nice here.

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.380
I could write that
another way so you

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.440
would see the important here.

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.170
So remember, what
is omega n squared?

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:24.610
Can I just remember that
omega n squared is k over m.

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:25.930
Right?

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:26.430
Yup.

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:35.570
k is the same as-- I'm going
to put that m up here--

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:39.995
k is the same as
m omega n squared.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:46.800
k is the same as
m omega n squared

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.536
and here I'm subtracting
m omega squared.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.980
You'll see the whole point of
resonance or near resonance

00:06:57.980 --> 00:07:05.880
when the bridge is getting
forced buy a frequency close

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.170
to its resonant frequency.

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:11.360
This difference, omega
squared, the difference

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.825
between the two frequencies
squared is in the denominator

00:07:14.825 --> 00:07:19.920
and will be small and
then the effect is large.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:25.240
And if we get those too close,
the effect is too large.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:30.350
So we'll see this cosine omega
t over this is, I would call,

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:44.790
the frequency response
is this factor.

00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:50.680
1 over m omega n squared
minus omega squared.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:59.150
That's the key
multiplier for when

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:04.280
the forcing term is a pure
frequency, that frequency

00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.590
gets exploded.

00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:09.620
And now, of course, what are
capital C1 and capital C2?

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.870
We find those from
the initial condition.

00:08:12.870 --> 00:08:16.440
At t equals 0, we
put in t equals 0,

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:20.600
and that tells us
what C1 has to be.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:28.070
And we put in t equals 0 again
to match the velocity Y prime

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:31.010
at 0, and that tells us C2.

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:33.370
Are you OK with that?

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:38.890
Just look at the beauty
of that solution.

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:42.110
This is null part.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.840
This is the forced part,
the particular part,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:49.820
the cosine divided
by that constant.

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.510
There's one more
equation, one more

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:59.580
forcing term I'd like often
and always and now to discuss.

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:03.880
And that is a delta
function, an impulse.

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.920
So I'm going to add
one more example.

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:18.060
my double prime plus ky
equal the delta function.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:18.920
Delta function.

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:24.685
It's called an impulse.

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:32.680
So I'd like to solve
that equation also.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.790
When the forcing term just
happens at one second,

00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:38.050
at the initial second.

00:09:38.050 --> 00:09:40.510
At t equals 0, the
delta function,

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:43.490
I'm hitting the spring.

00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.620
So the spring is sitting or
the pendulum is sitting there.

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.170
Actually, let's set it at rest.

00:09:51.170 --> 00:09:52.100
Here's my pendulum.

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.290
I'll try to draw a pendulum.

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.070
I don't know.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.460
That's not much of a pendulum.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:03.210
But it's good enough.

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:07.910
This equation says what
happens if I hit it

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:12.480
with a point source?

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.990
At t equals 0, I hit it but
I give it a finite velocity.

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:24.260
It doesn't move in
that instant second.

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.190
This is where delta
functions come in

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.730
so let me give you the
result of what happens

00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:31.870
and then we'll see them again.

00:10:31.870 --> 00:10:33.480
So what am I doing?

00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:37.050
I want to solve this equation
when the forcing function is

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:38.820
a delta function.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:42.890
So I'm going to call y
the impulse response.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:47.620
It's the solution that comes
when the forcing function is

00:10:47.620 --> 00:10:48.370
an impulse.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:50.140
So y is the impulse response.

00:10:50.140 --> 00:10:52.370
In fact, it's so
important, I'm going

00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:55.560
to give it its own letter. g.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:59.080
Now, can I turn that y into a g?

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:10.415
So that g is g of t is
the impulse response.

00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:20.810
If I can solve that equation.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:23.430
You might say, not so easy.

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:27.140
With a delta function, it's
not even a genuine function.

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:28.140
It's a little bit crazy.

00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:31.300
It all happens in one second.

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:33.840
I'm sorry, in one instant.

00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.050
Not over one second,
but one moment.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:40.460
But I can solve it.

00:11:40.460 --> 00:11:43.770
I can solve it for this reason.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:46.600
I can think of it
as an impulse here

00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:51.860
or I have an option,
another way which clearly I

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:59.600
can think of it as solving it
with no force mg double prime.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:06.010
Same problem, same
solution is 0.

00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:13.140
But I start from rest.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:14.120
Nothing's happening.

00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.020
y of 0 is 0.

00:12:17.020 --> 00:12:23.580
And it starts from an initial
velocity, y prime of 0.

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:27.530
The impulse starts it
out like a golf ball.

00:12:27.530 --> 00:12:30.750
Just go.

00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:33.470
And there's a 1 over m there.

00:12:33.470 --> 00:12:37.580
I'll discuss that another time.

00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:43.320
What I want to see now is that
I have either this somewhat

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:48.730
mysterious equation or this
totally normal equation,

00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:53.060
even a no equation starting
from y of 0 equals 0.

00:12:53.060 --> 00:12:55.890
But with an initial
velocity that the impulse

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:57.520
gave to the system.

00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.860
And I should be calling this g.

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:02.402
This is the g.

00:13:02.402 --> 00:13:04.760
We'll see impulse
responses again,

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:07.950
but let's see it this time
by solving this equation.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:11.430
So I plan to solve that
equation and actually we

00:13:11.430 --> 00:13:14.010
solved it last time.

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.860
You remember the
solution to this one?

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.680
When it starts from
0, there's no cosine.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:26.060
But when the initial velocity
is 1 over m, there is a sign.

00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:33.350
So I'm going to just
write down the g of t,

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:38.170
which is just sine of omega nt.

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:40.820
And why is it the
natural frequency?

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:46.280
Because I'm solving the no.

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:48.030
I'm looking for a no solution.

00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:53.310
But the previous video on
no solutions gets me this.

00:13:53.310 --> 00:14:02.880
Only I have to divide by, get 1
over m as the initial velocity.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.340
You'll see that that will
solve the no equation.

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:17.160
This is what happens to the
pendulum or the golf ball.

00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.900
Well, pendulum much better.

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.370
Actually, golf ball
is poor example.

00:14:21.370 --> 00:14:22.430
Sorry about that.

00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:24.990
Golf balls don't
swing back and forth.

00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:26.680
They tend to go.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:30.690
I'm looking at pendulums,
springs going up and down.

00:14:30.690 --> 00:14:36.750
So the spring starts out, has
an initial velocity of 1 over m

00:14:36.750 --> 00:14:39.100
and then after that
nothing happens.

00:14:39.100 --> 00:14:42.286
So that is the impulse response.

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:50.390
The response to an impulse.

00:14:50.390 --> 00:14:51.700
And why do I like that?

00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.850
First of all, its beautiful.

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:55.290
Simple answer.

00:14:55.290 --> 00:14:59.010
Secondly, every
forcing function,

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:03.170
and the output
comes from this one.

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:05.020
We'll see that point.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.950
So we've introduced forcing
functions, cos omega

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:15.290
t, where the particular solution
was a multiple of cos omega t.

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:19.260
And now, we've introduced
a forcing function delta,

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:25.970
the delta function where the
response is a sine function.

00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:27.770
Thank you.
