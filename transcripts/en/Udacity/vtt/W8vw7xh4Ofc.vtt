00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.360
Let us do another exercise together. We have identified the type of each of

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.960
these junctions. Let us now use, the constraints for

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.220
each type of junction to identify the type of each of these edges. For

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:17.440
each of these boxes, right? Either fold or blade for the type of the edge.
