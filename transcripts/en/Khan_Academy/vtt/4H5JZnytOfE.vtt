00:00:00.306 --> 00:00:03.151
- [Voiceover] G of x is a
transformation of f of x.

00:00:03.151 --> 00:00:05.677
The graph here shows this
is y is equal to f of x,

00:00:05.677 --> 00:00:06.675
the solid blue line,

00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:09.918
This is y is equal to g
of x as a dash red line.

00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:12.804
And they ask us, "What is
g of x in terms of f of x?"

00:00:12.804 --> 00:00:14.511
And like always, pause the
video and see if you can

00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:17.041
give a go at it and then
we're going to do it together.

00:00:17.041 --> 00:00:18.872
All right, so when you
immediately look like it,

00:00:18.872 --> 00:00:22.772
it looks like g of x is kind of
a thinned-up version of f of x.

00:00:22.772 --> 00:00:24.603
It seems like if you were to compress it

00:00:24.603 --> 00:00:27.494
to towards the center,
that's what g of x looks like

00:00:27.494 --> 00:00:29.850
but let's put a little bit
more meat on that bone

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.479
and see if we can identify
corresponding points.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.314
So for example, if we were to
look at f of negative six.

00:00:36.314 --> 00:00:39.054
That's, so f of negative six.

00:00:39.054 --> 00:00:42.792
That seems like it corresponds
or it gives us the same value

00:00:42.792 --> 00:00:45.288
as f of negative six.

00:00:45.288 --> 00:00:46.414
So we wanna find the corresponding points.

00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:47.308
We hit this minimum point.

00:00:47.308 --> 00:00:48.434
We're coming back up.

00:00:48.434 --> 00:00:49.108
Hit the minimum point.

00:00:49.108 --> 00:00:50.454
We're coming back up.

00:00:50.454 --> 00:00:52.695
It seems like the corresponding
point right over there

00:00:52.695 --> 00:00:55.330
is g of negative three.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.514
So let's write that down.

00:00:56.514 --> 00:01:00.113
Let's see, it looks like f of negative six

00:01:00.113 --> 00:01:02.829
and it is equal to g of negative three.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:03.955
These are corresponding points.

00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:07.210
If you apply the transformation
at the point f equals,

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.612
at the point negative six
comma f of negative six.

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:14.315
You get to the point negative
three, g of negative three

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:15.666
right over there.

00:01:15.666 --> 00:01:16.998
Let's do a couple of more.

00:01:16.998 --> 00:01:19.750
If you look at f is,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.030
so f of two,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.872
looks like it corresponds to g of one,

00:01:25.872 --> 00:01:28.487
f of two corresponds to g of one.

00:01:28.487 --> 00:01:29.753
So let's write that down.

00:01:29.753 --> 00:01:33.909
F of two looks like it
corresponds to g of one.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.708
And once again, I'm looking
at the where the functions

00:01:35.708 --> 00:01:38.494
hit the same value and also
optically I'm just looking at,

00:01:38.494 --> 00:01:40.154
well, looks like it's the
same part of the function

00:01:40.154 --> 00:01:45.088
if we assumed g of x is a
squeezed version of f of x.

00:01:45.088 --> 00:01:49.019
And so in general, it looks like

00:01:49.019 --> 00:01:50.799
for given x.

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.130
So we could say f of x
is going to be equal to

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.476
g of, well whatever you have it here,

00:01:57.476 --> 00:01:59.473
it seems like we have
half the value over here.

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:02.979
So g of x over two.

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.790
Or if you wanted to think of it the other way,

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.310
if you want to think of the other way,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.934
if you want to say g of x

00:02:08.934 --> 00:02:11.639
is going to be f of...

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:12.989
Well, whatever we have here,

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.800
it's f of twice that.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.342
So f of two x.

00:02:17.342 --> 00:02:19.223
And we see that that
is one of the choices.

00:02:19.223 --> 00:02:22.543
The g of x is equal to f of two x.

00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:24.824
Whatever the x that you input into g of x,

00:02:24.824 --> 00:02:27.522
you get that same value
out of the function

00:02:27.522 --> 00:02:30.378
when you input two times that into f of x.

00:02:30.378 --> 00:02:32.665
These seem to validate that.

00:02:32.665 --> 00:02:33.942
It looks optically like that

00:02:33.942 --> 00:02:35.486
and we shrunk it down.

00:02:35.486 --> 00:02:36.646
One way to think about it

00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:37.900
when you take,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.557
when you multiply the
input into a function

00:02:41.557 --> 00:02:44.425
by a number larger than one,

00:02:44.425 --> 00:02:45.597
it's going to compress.

00:02:45.597 --> 00:02:47.756
It's going to make things happen faster.

00:02:47.756 --> 00:02:50.577
The input to the function
is going to increase

00:02:50.577 --> 00:02:52.284
or become negative faster

00:02:52.284 --> 00:02:54.474
so it thins it up.

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:56.598
And if that doesn't make intuitive sense,

00:02:56.598 --> 00:02:58.962
you can also just try
some of these values.

00:02:58.962 --> 00:03:00.239
And I encourage you to try more.

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:01.702
Find the corresponding points

00:03:01.702 --> 00:03:04.337
where the f's and the
g's seem to match up.

00:03:04.337 --> 00:03:06.090
And you'll see over and over again

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.180
that to get the same value,

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:10.258
you have to put two times as much into f

00:03:10.258 --> 00:03:12.452
as you have to put into g.

00:03:12.452 --> 00:03:14.356
Hopefully that helps.
