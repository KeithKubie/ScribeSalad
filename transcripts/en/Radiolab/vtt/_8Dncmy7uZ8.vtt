00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.210
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab.

2
00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:04.260
And today we're talking about,

3
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.760
well we're trying to think about what goes on in the mind of a bad person.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.900
What makes a bad person so bad that he's different from the rest of us?

5
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.540
And we didn't really come to any kind of agreement with the hopper thing. Yeah,

6
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:17.970
I don't think we quite the scope, but you know,

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.330
we ended up walking this question around to different people want to talk about

8
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:23.610
bad people in Shakespeare. And oddly enough we came,

9
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.540
got a really interesting take on the true nature of badness from this Guy James

10
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:28.470
Shapiro,

11
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.790
professor of English at Columbia University and he said to start,

12
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:36.420
you want to know about bad? I'll give you bad. In Titus Andronicus.

13
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.540
There's a character by the name of Aaron, the Moore,

14
00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.980
and there's a moment in the play where Aaron gets up on stage,

15
00:00:40.981 --> 00:00:42.060
looks at the audience and says,

16
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.660
let me just tell you the kinds of things I've been up to recently

17
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.030
<v 1>set deadly. And the t between two friends make poor man's cattle,</v>

18
00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.850
break their necks, set fire on bonds,

19
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:57.930
and he stacks in the night and bit the onus quench sumps quench them with it.

20
00:00:57.931 --> 00:00:59.010
Tears off.

21
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.070
Have I digged up dead men from their graves and sit them upright of their dear

22
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:06.620
friends door? Oh,

23
00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.370
even even when their sorrows almost where for God and on their skins is on the

24
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:16.371
bark of trees have wind my life with my knife carved in Roman letters.

25
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.780
Let not your sorrows die though I am dead.

26
00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.810
<v 0>So he's bad. Yeah. But see, here's the interesting thing. According to James,</v>

27
00:01:27.811 --> 00:01:32.811
he is not the bad s no in Shakespeare or in life because ultimately the play

28
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.030
offers up a reason for his nastiness. The reason why

29
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.230
<v 1>tell telling all this stuff is because he has cut a deal.</v>

30
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:44.410
They will spare his son if he fesses up and and tells them what they need to

31
00:01:45.771 --> 00:01:49.280
know. So there's a way in which is a touch of spark of humanity,

32
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:50.203
just a little glimmer.

33
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.320
<v 0>And he says that's what people wanted.</v>

34
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.020
They wanted someone who was really thrillingly bad,

35
00:01:55.021 --> 00:01:58.610
but in the end was redeemed a bit. Yeah.

36
00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.180
This wasn't just a theater thing. Oh.

37
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.200
Cause if you couldn't afford a ticket for a play,

38
00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:03.860
you'd seen all the plays in the 1500

39
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.070
<v 1>I always go to a public hanging and you'd go for much of the same reasons.</v>

40
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:12.840
And those days, if you're a convicted male felon, you are, you know, strung up,

41
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.060
but you're not allowed to hang until you die.

42
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.540
You're cut down before then warning, this next part's a little graphic.

43
00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.600
Then the executioner castrates you cuts you open and takes out your internal

44
00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:27.780
organs and then separates your head, which was put on a post.

45
00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.330
But even with all that Gore and horribleness,

46
00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:33.210
there was often a moment that people waited for.

47
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.340
And in a way we wait for it still. Even now,

48
00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.580
we want what Elizabeth and Scott at the scaffold,

49
00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.680
which was a confession before the guy is cut to shreds.

50
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.340
He's allowed to confess. You know, I, I hardly, you know,

51
00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.530
regret the fact that I kill the young maiden or defame the king, whatever it is.

52
00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.650
The expectation is somebody is made to make his peace with his maker before he

53
00:02:58.561 --> 00:03:00.160
dies. That's

54
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.250
<v 0>what you do and that's what Shakespeare did and all his plays.</v>

55
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.330
He would give all his batteries at least one moment where they could be

56
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:10.920
understood except this one time

57
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.040
<v 2>[inaudible] you [inaudible]</v>

58
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.430
<v 0>yeah, he is a soldier.</v>

59
00:03:19.431 --> 00:03:23.450
He works for a general general general's name is a fellow there supposedly

60
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.440
chums, but general a fellow has no idea that he algo

61
00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.933
heats.

62
00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.490
So he plans to destroy a fellow and then we don't exactly know why.

63
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.540
There are hints of reasons like maybe he thinks a fellow sleeping with his wife,

64
00:03:41.541 --> 00:03:42.374
we're not sure.

65
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.310
But the weird thing is that he decides not just to take down the fellow,

66
00:03:46.311 --> 00:03:47.810
but everybody

67
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:55.460
Easters up hatred between friends, between lovers,

68
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.440
he even schemes against his own wife.

69
00:03:57.441 --> 00:04:02.441
This is just somebody who's performing brain surgery without anesthesia on other

70
00:04:03.771 --> 00:04:04.604
people.

71
00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:11.320
He's a master plotter and as for why maybe a fellow was sleeping with Amelia,

72
00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.740
but as the play goes on, you begin to think that maybe that's just another lie.

73
00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:22.310
Eventually Iago convinces Othello that his wife has been disloyal,

74
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.390
which she hasn't. And then Othello goes and kills his own wife,

75
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.960
smothering her with a pillow.

76
00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.990
This is just that tsunami of evil or passes through the place.

77
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.420
<v 2>Did you start moving your head?</v>

78
00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.030
<v 0>The very end of the play, when everyone finds out what he all goes done,</v>

79
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.960
fellow asks him why? Why did you do this?

80
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:51.300
Any Jago he refuses what

81
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:58.370
we fully expect and what everybody on stage at that moment fully expects from

82
00:05:00.421 --> 00:05:02.760
him. You know? What does he say?

83
00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.410
I'm demand mean nothing. What you know,

84
00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:11.653
you know

85
00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.010
<v 1>from this time forth, I never will speak word.</v>

86
00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.330
I'm not saying a word. I'm not going to give you what you want.

87
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.530
I'm not going to give you,

88
00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.720
I'm not going to help restore the sense that there is a moral order to the world

89
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:33.250
and a moral norm.

90
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:38.060
<v 0>[inaudible]. What you know, you know,</v>

91
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.280
if this is the singular moment in Shakespeare where he gives you an

92
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:49.120
understandably evil man, no motives, no reason.

93
00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.530
Well, any idea what the hell he was intending?

94
00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.090
What you know you

95
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.180
meaning, I mean w w any idea what he was in his mind?

96
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.290
Was he trying to make a commentary?

97
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:11.140
It's and who was he grappling with something? Do we know? You know? Dammit.

98
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.083
<v 2>Okay.</v>

99
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.760
<v 0>The goody Argos make you want to shower the minute you leave the theater because</v>

100
00:06:17.761 --> 00:06:19.710
you are sullied by them.

101
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.270
Thank you to James Shapiro whose most recent book is called contested will,

102
00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.590
you know what? Yeah, you there? Yeah.

103
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.600
Well you know what I'm left thinking though is like if you could somehow,

104
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:31.620
I mean that was make belief,

105
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:35.550
but if you could somehow get a real Jago in the room and subject that person to

106
00:06:35.551 --> 00:06:39.210
questioning and really get them to sort of fess up as to why they did it,

107
00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.760
would that make a difference?

108
00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:44.610
We should say that this next section of the program has some references which

109
00:06:44.611 --> 00:06:48.060
are extremely graphic and not to everybody's taste. So we have kids in the,

110
00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.870
in the room and maybe this is a time to tell them to go brush their teeth or

111
00:06:51.871 --> 00:06:54.630
something. Yeah, yeah. It comes to us from our reporter.

112
00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.890
<v 2>Parents matter. Yes. Jeff Johnson. Nice to meet you. All right, so who is,</v>

113
00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:00.873
who is this guy? We're here.

114
00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:06.130
<v 0>This is Jeff Jensen and he's a reporter in La and he wrote this graphic novel</v>

115
00:07:06.141 --> 00:07:10.490
that I read about one of the most prolific serial killers in u s history,

116
00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:11.540
Gary Leon Ridgeway,

117
00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.690
<v 3>the green river killer.</v>

118
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.460
The first victims of the green river killer were found in the summer of 1982 and

119
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.810
the green river murders terrorized Seattle in the 1980s in Seattle today,

120
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.620
a man called the green river killer.

121
00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.450
Ridgeway murdered at least 49 women called green river killer. Right?

122
00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:32.510
It's suspected that it could be upwards of 75 making him the most prolific

123
00:07:32.861 --> 00:07:36.520
serial killer in American history. All the victims were prostitutes.

124
00:07:36.610 --> 00:07:41.380
He buried them or left their bodies in these little clumps in the woods.

125
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.930
The kind of seemed to a place the bodies as if they were mannequins.

126
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.780
And in January of 1984,

127
00:07:46.781 --> 00:07:50.440
the green river task force was formed and my father was recruited to the task

128
00:07:50.441 --> 00:07:52.720
force. So Jeff wrote this book because his father,

129
00:07:52.721 --> 00:07:56.950
Tom Jensen was one of the lead detectives tracking Gary Ridgway.

130
00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:01.840
He ultimately spent 17 years searching for this man. In December of 2001,

131
00:08:01.841 --> 00:08:06.640
my father and his colleagues make the arrest DNA testing matched him to the

132
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:08.000
crime they arrest Gary Lee

133
00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:11.830
<v 0>Leon Ridgeway. And on June 13th, 2003,</v>

134
00:08:11.980 --> 00:08:16.980
Gary was secretly taken out of his jail cell and brought to a sort of very

135
00:08:17.351 --> 00:08:22.351
nondescript concrete ugly office building.

136
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:25.480
And um, over the next six months,

137
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:28.450
from June to early December,

138
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:33.190
it was Tom's job to get Gary to open up and give up the few details that they

139
00:08:33.191 --> 00:08:36.340
really needed to link him certifiably to all these crimes.

140
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:42.560
<v 2>Today's date is June 17th, 2003.</v>

141
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:44.750
The time now is the eight 36 hours.

142
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:47.990
So every day they would bring them into this conference room.

143
00:08:48.250 --> 00:08:50.770
This is a continuation of an interview with Gary Neon.

144
00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:52.610
Ridgeway and interrogate him.

145
00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.120
What did you remember since we last talked to you?

146
00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.340
I've got those all interned at, at the time mostly, um,

147
00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:08.100
some that, uh, I remember picking her up at.

148
00:09:08.850 --> 00:09:09.683
Um,

149
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:12.070
<v 3>it immediately became apparent that there was going to be different</v>

150
00:09:12.530 --> 00:09:14.950
<v 2>faculties as far as I know. I don't know if I did or not.</v>

151
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:16.850
<v 3>Nine things. He would obscure.</v>

152
00:09:16.851 --> 00:09:21.440
He would dance around things you didn't really want a cop to everything that he

153
00:09:21.441 --> 00:09:23.690
did. I gotta tell you a, I mean, not

154
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:27.520
<v 2>totally comfortable that you're providing all the answers</v>

155
00:09:28.270 --> 00:09:31.820
<v 3>formation, especially when it came to one particular fact.</v>

156
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.880
What my father and his colleagues know is that something was done to these body

157
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:40.710
and many of them after they were murdered. Does he, is he saying,

158
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:42.030
I think he's saying, Yup.

159
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.430
Necrophilia Gary is dancing around this topic.

160
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:50.250
Gary had denied this to his own lawyers and that we're not going to be,

161
00:09:50.390 --> 00:09:54.590
so my father and the other interviewer in that room, that morning,

162
00:09:54.591 --> 00:09:59.450
detective John Mattson, they start using a line of,

163
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:02.900
uh, attack, uh, of interviewing him. That was very,

164
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.920
<v 2>it's okay. It's okay if you did. Stunningly,</v>

165
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:09.980
shockingly empathetic. Nothing to be ashamed.

166
00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.050
Thousands of people it you, I'm not the first one. You know,

167
00:10:15.051 --> 00:10:19.160
you're not the first person that's ever done this. Not going to be the last one.

168
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:22.580
You won't be the last as one of the things that we,

169
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.300
we need to know the father father's trying to like reach out to him. Okay.

170
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:30.020
I know it was more than heritage. It's okay to admit this.

171
00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:34.240
You need to admit this. Okay. It's all right. We've got to note that.

172
00:10:35.030 --> 00:10:39.740
That's one of the things we have to know and that's why it's okay to let him and

173
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:43.910
he does a yes, I did lie about that

174
00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:50.150
potentially was a wood back one time before then. You call me.

175
00:10:50.151 --> 00:10:51.980
Some of them that I,

176
00:10:54.980 --> 00:10:59.510
like I said, I've got to give it out. I can't keep [inaudible] moments

177
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.650
<v 3>like this was a major breakthrough,</v>

178
00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:07.260
so he ends up in mitigants in graphic detail and it gets even more disturbing

179
00:11:07.261 --> 00:11:11.580
for my father as the conversation suddenly pivots to another victim

180
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.660
<v 2>other than one</v>

181
00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:19.200
that was real close to me by the name of Carol Christian Centered Christiansen.

182
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:22.320
I dated her several times, three times, two times.

183
00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.280
<v 3>He brings her up as an example of a,</v>

184
00:11:24.281 --> 00:11:28.420
of a woman that he actually had strong feelings for

185
00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.520
<v 2>like just like this girl, like glade liked her, she was skinny,</v>

186
00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:33.713
she was good to me

187
00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:38.430
<v 3>and as it happens my father has very vivid memories of investigating the Carol</v>

188
00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.440
Christianson murder. Speaking with Carol's mom,

189
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:43.160
Carol's little daughter killed her.

190
00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.790
<v 2>It was a, I knew she had a daughter and so, so</v>

191
00:11:48.950 --> 00:11:53.950
<v 3>Gary starts going through this narrative of what he did to Carol the</v>

192
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:55.990
<v 2>last time. She was a,</v>

193
00:11:57.230 --> 00:12:01.990
<v 3>in a hurry. She like was allegedly in a rush and she didn't like it.</v>

194
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:04.970
Kind of like hurt his feelings. Wasn't sad

195
00:12:05.340 --> 00:12:08.640
<v 2>fighting me with it would make me mad cause you very much Noree</v>

196
00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:13.440
she had some melt in her mind and I

197
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.190
killed her killer,

198
00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:22.900
a chapter with my arm and weight killer cared for because I dated before but

199
00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:29.160
this tape didn't turn out right

200
00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:31.050
<v 3>up until that point.</v>

201
00:12:31.230 --> 00:12:34.950
Gary refused to say that from the minute I picked these women up,

202
00:12:35.190 --> 00:12:38.790
I wanted to kill them. He claimed they were in the middle of a sex act.

203
00:12:38.970 --> 00:12:42.390
He would get distracted, something would happen. He just kind of went crazy.

204
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:47.540
He had snapped and almost like blaming the victims and my father wasn't buying

205
00:12:49.231 --> 00:12:51.120
it, whistled back up.

206
00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:54.600
The fact that he kept on doing it over and over and over again was like,

207
00:12:54.601 --> 00:12:58.980
come on Ben through this a lot of times before and she's already told you she's

208
00:12:59.130 --> 00:13:01.050
in her. You knew what was going to happen

209
00:13:01.370 --> 00:13:05.790
<v 2>and you've done this. How many times have you 10 times hand,</v>

210
00:13:05.900 --> 00:13:10.220
1520 times. You know what's going to happen. She pisses your off

211
00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:14.850
and you like her telling us always yes,

212
00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:20.320
get you go into this knowing full well that it could end up in her desk

213
00:13:22.090 --> 00:13:26.500
<v 3>and Gary just says, yes, that is true. When I picked them up,</v>

214
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:32.110
I was going to kill them. Finally acknowledging. Yeah, that's true.

215
00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:35.300
There's a pause and my father just says,

216
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:37.143
<v 2>why?</v>

217
00:13:37.270 --> 00:13:41.560
<v 3>Why? Why did you do this?</v>

218
00:13:42.410 --> 00:13:43.780
You need to kill.

219
00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:47.560
And that was a question that had haunted my father for decades.

220
00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:51.490
Why isn't that why? And that one simple why that he asks Gary,

221
00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.800
there was a lot of questions. He was asking,

222
00:13:54.490 --> 00:13:57.700
why did you inflict all this suffering on them? On us?

223
00:13:57.760 --> 00:14:01.240
Why did you take these women off the streets and wanting to destroy them? Why?

224
00:14:01.241 --> 00:14:02.074
Why

225
00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:05.363
<v 4>[inaudible]</v>

226
00:14:07.300 --> 00:14:11.230
<v 3>the answer is</v>

227
00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:14.260
unsatisfying.

228
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:19.290
<v 2>Yes, I did need to kill killer because,</v>

229
00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:26.000
wait, what?

230
00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000
<v 3>I just needed to kill because of that and then he just trails off.</v>

231
00:14:31.221 --> 00:14:35.210
I need to kill because of that. That's it. It just, that's, you know,

232
00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.790
I just wanted to kill him. I just needed to kill them

233
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:45.710
in that moment. My father, he stands up and he says,

234
00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:51.920
<v 2>you've touched me, Gary. You touched me. Can you take a break</v>

235
00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:57.730
<v 3>cable going off tape now it's two Oh nine 24 hours on June 17th year 2014 he</v>

236
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.980
walked out of the room and just started weeping.

237
00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:09.560
<v 0>They spent the next six months interrogating him.</v>

238
00:15:09.561 --> 00:15:13.490
They brought in psychiatrists and forensic psychologists to try to get an

239
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:17.060
answer. Gary says, I needed to kill them. They go, why? And he says,

240
00:15:17.061 --> 00:15:19.100
because of the rage and well, why the rage?

241
00:15:19.101 --> 00:15:21.500
And because women have stepped on me all my life. Well,

242
00:15:21.501 --> 00:15:23.780
why can't you deal with it in a normal way?

243
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:26.900
Each answer just begs another why.

244
00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:30.940
And even though in the end they got him to confess to these 49 murders,

245
00:15:31.150 --> 00:15:35.920
they never really get any closer to an answer than this first one.

246
00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:39.300
<v 2>[inaudible]</v>

247
00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:42.360
<v 3>that afternoon he gets in his car, goes home,</v>

248
00:15:42.870 --> 00:15:47.370
he finds my mom on the deck, he sits down next to her.

249
00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:52.170
She says, what happened today? My Dad said,

250
00:15:52.740 --> 00:15:53.580
I don't want to talk about it.

251
00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:59.040
And to this day they have not talked about that day and he hasn't talked about

252
00:15:59.041 --> 00:16:02.970
it with anyone until I interviewed him for the book.

253
00:16:04.890 --> 00:16:05.723
And

254
00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:10.290
why is it so important do you think,

255
00:16:10.291 --> 00:16:14.370
to understand the why behind such an evil act?

256
00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:15.510
Well,

257
00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:18.570
the thing that haunts me about the why question is that I'm reminded of like one

258
00:16:18.571 --> 00:16:19.950
of the oldest stories in the Bible,

259
00:16:19.951 --> 00:16:24.951
which is the story of job of the story of job is that one day God and Satan are

260
00:16:25.051 --> 00:16:29.670
having a conversation and they're saying, have you checked out job? You know,

261
00:16:29.671 --> 00:16:31.110
I'm really proud of Joe.

262
00:16:31.111 --> 00:16:36.111
He believes in me and he trusts me in so much and he has such great faith in me,

263
00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:39.630
and Satan is like, ah, I bet I can change his mind.

264
00:16:39.930 --> 00:16:44.400
And so Satan basically systematically destroys job's life,

265
00:16:44.730 --> 00:16:47.730
takes away his wife, his children, all his material possessions.

266
00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:52.620
What follows is this ongoing conversation between job and his friends about why

267
00:16:52.621 --> 00:16:56.430
does this happen? Why does God allow this to happen?

268
00:16:57.270 --> 00:17:00.990
Only then does God speak up and kind of say like,

269
00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:04.470
you're going to question me like, you know who are you?

270
00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:11.300
My point is sometimes when we ask the why in the face of profound evil,

271
00:17:13.170 --> 00:17:17.100
I kind of wonder if what we're doing is that we're daring God to show himself

272
00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:22.680
and I think what we want out of the why is meaning meaning to life,

273
00:17:22.681 --> 00:17:27.681
to reveal itself in a way that restores order and gives us hope that all of this

274
00:17:29.551 --> 00:17:31.350
isn't just meaningless chaos.

275
00:17:49.910 --> 00:17:50.743
<v 2>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

276
00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.320
Jensen's book is the Green River Killer, a true detective story.

277
00:18:32.321 --> 00:18:35.560
It's a graphic or an illustrated novel. Thanks.

278
00:18:35.561 --> 00:18:39.580
Also to reporter Aaron Scott for that story. This is Radiolab.
