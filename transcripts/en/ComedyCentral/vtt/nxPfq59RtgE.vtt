- I'm gonna do a little story,
kind of about my family and love

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:19.179
and stuff like that--all those
sweet ideas right there.

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.813
I don't think I could have
told this story before,

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:22.949
like, had he asked me to do this
in my 20s,

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:25.584
'cause the only person I loved
was myself back in my 20s.

00:01:25.584 --> 00:01:26.919
I really did. I really did.

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:28.354
I actually--the only thing
that made me cry

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:30.623
in my twenties was thinking of
myself dying.

00:01:30.623 --> 00:01:32.992
I, um--I discovered that
in acting class.

00:01:32.992 --> 00:01:34.493
I was serious.
I would think of myself dying

00:01:34.493 --> 00:01:36.362
and I'd think about myself
departing the earth

00:01:36.362 --> 00:01:38.931
and think how sad it was for
everybody else, and I'd cry.

00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:41.667
And, um...
I know! [laughs]

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:43.302
That's twisted, right?

00:01:43.302 --> 00:01:45.972
But I grew up, so now that
I'm in my 40s, something--

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:48.274
And now that I'm older,
I can, uh,

00:01:48.274 --> 00:01:50.610
talk a little bit more honestly
about stuff like this.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.311
So--I don't have a table.

00:01:52.311 --> 00:01:54.113

00:01:55.181 --> 00:01:56.649
But I was--

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:59.152
I've recently gone through
quite an experience with my mom,

00:01:59.152 --> 00:02:00.953
and this story's gonna deal
with a lot with my mom,

00:02:00.953 --> 00:02:02.321
and she's an amazing woman.

00:02:02.321 --> 00:02:03.489
She's the coolest.
She's the coolest.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:04.623
Say anything bad about my mom,

00:02:04.623 --> 00:02:05.892
I'll kill you.
I will.

00:02:05.892 --> 00:02:08.060
I love my mom. Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.728
Uh, raised me as a--
she was an artist and a nurse.

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:11.230
Mainly an artist.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.366
From a very young age,
she exposed me to art,

00:02:14.366 --> 00:02:16.635
trying to get me to understand
the finer things in life

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:18.971
and be really sophisticated,
understanding--

00:02:18.971 --> 00:02:21.307
sort of value the beauty in
the world and stuff like that.

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:23.376
From like five or six,
she'd have me up in her studio

00:02:23.376 --> 00:02:24.910
in her room and uh,

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.979
just watching her paint
and stuff like that.

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:30.383
And first nudes I ever saw.
First nudes I ever saw,

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:33.219
uh, were my mom's paintings,
which is kind of cool.

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:34.987
Like, and, uh...

00:02:34.987 --> 00:02:36.088
Not really good nudes.

00:02:36.088 --> 00:02:37.523
I mean, this is rural Canada.

00:02:37.523 --> 00:02:39.992
Not a lot of great people posed
for art.

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:43.162
Uh, you didn't have the sexiest
people you've ever seen

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:45.864
in my mom's art shows,
but they came in handy

00:02:45.864 --> 00:02:47.867
when I started
going through puberty.

00:02:47.867 --> 00:02:49.835
And um--
I know. Isn't that gross?

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:51.170
And I'm not even making that up.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.872
The first thing
I ever masturbated to

00:02:52.872 --> 00:02:54.373
were sketches my mom's made.

00:02:54.373 --> 00:02:56.776
Um...
I know!

00:02:56.776 --> 00:02:58.278
I know--
it's--

00:02:58.278 --> 00:02:59.345
it's horrible.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:00.679
[stammering]
I--I--

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:02.047
That lasted until I found
her art books,

00:03:02.047 --> 00:03:04.417
and then--oh, her art books
were amazing.

00:03:04.417 --> 00:03:09.055
I became the most sophisticated
masturbator on the planet.

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:12.758
I did--I jerked off to Rubens,
Seurat, Botticelli,

00:03:12.758 --> 00:03:14.360
uh, Gustav Klimt.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.030
I--I painted the Louvre daily
in semen.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.366
I, um--

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:24.537
Love masturbating.

00:03:24.537 --> 00:03:26.772
And all my mom saw was me
walking up to my room

00:03:26.772 --> 00:03:28.708
with art books.
"Oh, my little boy loves art.

00:03:28.708 --> 00:03:30.476
Look at him."

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:33.379
I loved art back then.
I did.

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.314
Then a weird thing happened;
we moved.

00:03:35.314 --> 00:03:37.283
I was raised in a very...
religious family

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:39.051
and my dad lost
all of our money.

00:03:39.051 --> 00:03:41.487
Not through bad business,
but because he became religious.

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:43.889
He became a Lay Franciscan monk
and without telling my mom

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.057
or anybody else in the family,

00:03:45.057 --> 00:03:47.393
he donated all our money
to charity,

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:49.595
and we went broke.
[laughs]

00:03:49.595 --> 00:03:51.564
And we had to move.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:53.399
And so we moved.

00:03:53.399 --> 00:03:55.467
And I quickly put my stuff
in boxes,

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:58.237
and I had acquired
a little porn by that point.

00:03:58.237 --> 00:04:01.407
And, uh, I remember writing on
a box "do not look inside.

00:04:01.407 --> 00:04:03.242
This is mine."
And I put it in the truck,

00:04:03.242 --> 00:04:05.310
assuming
nobody would look inside.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.082
Uh, I was a naive child.
I really was.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.983
So, uh, I didn't think much
about it.

00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:13.252
When we got to the new place,
the box was missing.

00:04:13.252 --> 00:04:17.189
About a month later,
before school one morning,

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:20.158
about 6:00 a.m.,
my mom walks into the room.

00:04:20.158 --> 00:04:22.694
Door opens.
Light flips on.

00:04:22.694 --> 00:04:24.029
I was like, "What's going on?"

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:25.031
Mom drags a chair behind her.

00:04:25.031 --> 00:04:27.366
Under her arm is that box.

00:04:27.366 --> 00:04:29.502
I'm like, "Oh, shit."

00:04:29.502 --> 00:04:31.436
And she sits down
next to me in the bed,

00:04:31.436 --> 00:04:35.140
and she goes, "Pete,
I'm a little concerned.

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.676
"I know how much you love art,

00:04:37.676 --> 00:04:40.346
"but I found these magazines
and I--

00:04:40.346 --> 00:04:42.681
"I think the best thing to do
is for me to sit here

00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:43.849
and go through them with you."

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:45.451
[audience groans]

00:04:45.451 --> 00:04:47.720
Ohh.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:50.956
The very top magazine was
a "Hustler," I'll never forget.

00:04:50.956 --> 00:04:52.558
It was the first one
I ever bought.

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:55.161
And it had this blonde-haired
Chinese girl on it--

00:04:55.161 --> 00:04:56.895
I don't remember her name,
but oh.

00:04:56.895 --> 00:04:58.730
And my mom picks up the magazine

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.165
and she flips it
to the first pictorial

00:05:00.165 --> 00:05:02.134
and there's a picture
of this naked girl,

00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:03.903
and then she goes, "Well, look--
look at her.

00:05:03.903 --> 00:05:06.872
"She's a beautiful woman.
There's nothing wrong with that.

00:05:06.872 --> 00:05:08.140
She takes good care of herself."

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:09.909
And then
she flips the page over.

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:13.712
"And look, that's a nice photo.
It's very artistically posed.

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:16.749
"She's--leans over, that light
catches her very nicely.

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:18.250
That's all right."

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.852
And then
she flips the page over.

00:05:20.852 --> 00:05:25.024
And the next page...
is just two full pages

00:05:25.024 --> 00:05:29.094
of just a close-up
of her vagina.

00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:33.533
Just this massive pussy
just staring out.

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:37.236
And my mom's just...

00:05:37.236 --> 00:05:39.204
"Oh."

00:05:39.204 --> 00:05:43.275
Just that delicate little "oh"
just crushed me right there.

00:05:43.275 --> 00:05:47.579
She's like, "Is that how we
should look at women?

00:05:47.579 --> 00:05:50.916
"Is that what women are,
just--just a vagina?

00:05:50.916 --> 00:05:53.018
"Just a part?
Just an object?

00:05:53.018 --> 00:05:54.353
"Is that--is that her?

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.355
"Is that all we should
look at them as?

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:59.759
"Just a utilized device
for your own gratification,

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:02.027
is that what a woman is?
Is it?"

00:06:02.027 --> 00:06:03.696
I go, "No, Mom, I don't even
look at that page.

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:07.233
I skip right over that one."

00:06:10.102 --> 00:06:11.637
She flips the page

00:06:11.637 --> 00:06:14.540
and she goes through
the entire magazine like this.

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:16.208
And I love my mom, but, boy,

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:20.379
she knew how to
fuck up a kid's puberty.

00:06:20.379 --> 00:06:22.715
And I thought it messed me up.
I-I really did.

00:06:22.715 --> 00:06:24.650
For the longest time, I thought
this might have turned me

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.488
into a weirdo, but actually kind
of made me into a good person.

00:06:29.488 --> 00:06:32.558
That's kind of the amazing thing
about my mom.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:37.330
She had a roundabout way
of making me better, you know?

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.233
My mom got cancer
quite shortly after that.

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:44.236
It wasn't like--it was--it was
a weird type of cancer.

00:06:44.236 --> 00:06:46.004
I don't know if
anybody's experienced this,

00:06:46.004 --> 00:06:49.174
but it's a kind of cancer where
it doesn't seem to kill her.

00:06:49.174 --> 00:06:54.179
She got diagnosed with cancer
and she had it for 25 years.

00:06:54.179 --> 00:06:55.580
Twenty-five years of cancer.

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.584
That's the Canadian
medical system, people.

00:06:58.584 --> 00:07:00.086
Um...
[laughs]

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.588
Fight for it.

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:05.757
But after a while of her
being sick with cancer,

00:07:05.757 --> 00:07:08.094
I didn't pay attention to it.
I didn't focus on it.

00:07:08.094 --> 00:07:10.029
I just took it for granted
that she was sick.

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:12.098
And then about four
or five years ago,

00:07:12.098 --> 00:07:14.633
I was in Switzerland, doing gigs
and doing shows,

00:07:14.633 --> 00:07:16.469
and I got a phone call.
I was in Lucerne.

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:19.137
I remember, 'cause
my sister's voice on the phone--

00:07:19.137 --> 00:07:20.506
you know when you pick up the
phone, there's always--

00:07:20.506 --> 00:07:22.040
you know there's something bad,
you know?

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.375
I heard this cracking
in her voice,

00:07:23.375 --> 00:07:24.877
and she goes, "Pete,
you gotta get home."

00:07:24.877 --> 00:07:25.977
I go, "What's wrong?"

00:07:25.977 --> 00:07:27.280
And she goes, "Well, it's Mom.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.714
She's not--
you gotta get home."

00:07:28.714 --> 00:07:30.682
I go, well, my gig's finished
in three days

00:07:30.682 --> 00:07:32.184
and I'll catch a flight home.

00:07:32.184 --> 00:07:35.287
She goes,<i>"No,</i>no.
You gotta get home<i>now."</i>

00:07:35.287 --> 00:07:37.322
And you tell when you hear
that in your voice,

00:07:37.322 --> 00:07:40.025
like, this isn't--this--I don't
got time to fuck around.

00:07:40.025 --> 00:07:42.194
I gotta go now.
And I've never done this before.

00:07:42.194 --> 00:07:43.529
I grabbed my stuff,
I told the promoter

00:07:43.529 --> 00:07:45.298
I was leaving,
I got in a taxi cab.

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:47.299
I had a little app on my phone
for plane tickets,

00:07:47.299 --> 00:07:49.001
and I bought a plane ticket,

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:51.003
on the app on the way
to the airport.

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:53.005
It cost me a<i>fortune.</i>

00:07:53.005 --> 00:07:54.840
But I did it 'cause I needed
to get home

00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.141
to see my mom, you know?

00:07:56.141 --> 00:07:57.510
And I got to the airport

00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:59.145
and the flight was leaving
in about an hour.

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.313
I had a carry-on bag.
I go up to the counter.

00:08:01.313 --> 00:08:03.815
And I go, hey, I bought a ticket
on the way here.

00:08:03.815 --> 00:08:07.152
Here's my passport, here's this.
Gotta get on the flight.

00:08:07.152 --> 00:08:08.353
And the lady's, "Okay, okay.

00:08:08.353 --> 00:08:09.688
Do you have a printout
of the ticket?"

00:08:09.688 --> 00:08:12.424
And I go, no, no,
I did it on your app.

00:08:12.424 --> 00:08:15.194
Got no printout in the taxi
on the way here.

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:16.661
And she goes, "Well, I can't
let you on the plane

00:08:16.661 --> 00:08:18.931
if you don't have a printout
of the ticket.

00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:21.400
And I go, that's crazy,
it's crazy, I have an app.

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:23.336
I can't print out anything.
Could you print it out for me?

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:24.937
She goes,
"I can't print it out;

00:08:24.937 --> 00:08:26.538
you need a printout
or you can't get on the plane."

00:08:26.538 --> 00:08:28.206
I go, well,
that's fucking crazy.

00:08:28.206 --> 00:08:30.843
And she goes--and she goes--
"If you swear,

00:08:30.843 --> 00:08:32.177
"I will have to
deny you boarding.

00:08:32.177 --> 00:08:34.046
You won't be getting on
any planes today."

00:08:34.046 --> 00:08:36.848
And I'm like, what?
Wh--my mom--

00:08:36.848 --> 00:08:39.284
And I explained to her my mom's,
you know, she's really sick.

00:08:39.284 --> 00:08:40.886
I gotta get home.
This is fucking nuts.

00:08:40.886 --> 00:08:42.922
And she goes, "You swore again!
If you do this again,

00:08:42.922 --> 00:08:44.857
you're gone,"
and I didn't know what to do.

00:08:44.857 --> 00:08:47.726
And I was panicking.
And I did the craziest thing.

00:08:47.726 --> 00:08:49.194
And I don't know
if you've ever encountered

00:08:49.194 --> 00:08:51.029
this sort of
dehumanizing bureaucracy

00:08:51.029 --> 00:08:52.631
when people try to put you
in a place

00:08:52.631 --> 00:08:53.932
and limit your expression

00:08:53.932 --> 00:08:55.200
because they're
just following rules

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.602
and not treating you
like a human.

00:08:56.602 --> 00:08:59.204
Like a little object.
But I just, [growls].

00:08:59.204 --> 00:09:02.074
I growled at her.

00:09:02.074 --> 00:09:04.643
I-I-I--it just--
it came from my soul.

00:09:04.643 --> 00:09:07.045
[growling]
And I--

00:09:07.045 --> 00:09:09.314
And people started looking
at the airport,

00:09:09.314 --> 00:09:10.549
like, "What's going on?"

00:09:10.549 --> 00:09:12.217
And I didn't know
what else to do,

00:09:12.217 --> 00:09:13.585
because I couldn't swear
but I had all this--

00:09:13.585 --> 00:09:15.287
[snarls]
And the manager walked over.

00:09:15.287 --> 00:09:16.922
He goes, "What's going on here?"

00:09:16.922 --> 00:09:18.891
And I just--tears are coming
down my face at this point,

00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:21.293
and I go, listen, my mom's
dying, and I gotta get home,

00:09:21.293 --> 00:09:23.328
and she won't let me get
on the plane.

00:09:23.328 --> 00:09:24.897
And the guy goes, "Don't worry.

00:09:24.897 --> 00:09:26.565
I'll get you on the plane.
I'll take care of this."

00:09:26.565 --> 00:09:29.735
And I growled my way onto
the fucking plane.

00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.077
I miraculously got home in time.

00:09:39.077 --> 00:09:40.745
I saw her.
She was still lucid.

00:09:40.745 --> 00:09:41.780
She was in a great deal of pain,

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.582
but I got to talk to my mom

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:46.485
before, uh, you know,
before she passed.

00:09:46.485 --> 00:09:48.954
But she was in a lot of pain
and my dad showed up,

00:09:48.954 --> 00:09:51.490
the joyous, loving man
that he is.

00:09:51.490 --> 00:09:55.094
My dad's incredibly religious
in a crazy way.

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:56.662
He believes
all these crazy things,

00:09:56.662 --> 00:09:58.831
and one of the things he did
while my mom was suffering

00:09:58.831 --> 00:10:00.365
was he went to the doctors

00:10:00.365 --> 00:10:02.968
and told them not
to give her painkillers.

00:10:02.968 --> 00:10:05.371
I don't know if there's
any Catholics in here,

00:10:05.371 --> 00:10:07.973
but there's something called
Purgatory in Catholicism.

00:10:07.973 --> 00:10:10.376
And one of the things
they do is that,

00:10:10.376 --> 00:10:12.611
if you suffer a lot of pain,
you can offer that pain up

00:10:12.611 --> 00:10:14.146
to some poor souls in Purgatory
that will

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:16.048
advance your admission
into Heaven.

00:10:16.048 --> 00:10:18.050
Crazy idea,
but my mom was in pain,

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.551
and he was withholding
painkillers,

00:10:19.551 --> 00:10:21.653
and I was like,
no, you can't do that.

00:10:21.653 --> 00:10:23.355
And we got in this huge fight,
but the doctor came in,

00:10:23.355 --> 00:10:24.957
and goes, "Well, he is
her husband.

00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:27.292
He gets to decide what kind of
pain management she gets."

00:10:27.292 --> 00:10:28.827
So I can't give her painkillers.

00:10:28.827 --> 00:10:30.662
This is insane, you know?

00:10:30.662 --> 00:10:32.564
So I got my brother
to trick him outside,

00:10:32.564 --> 00:10:35.067
and I went to a nurse and this--
I fucking love nurses.

00:10:35.067 --> 00:10:36.569
And I explained it to her.

00:10:36.569 --> 00:10:37.803
It's like, my mom's
in a lot of pain.

00:10:37.803 --> 00:10:38.970
She used to be a nurse.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:39.972
She goes, "I'll take care of it.

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:41.573
Your dad's an asshole."

00:10:41.573 --> 00:10:43.142
And I...
[laughs]

00:10:43.142 --> 00:10:45.811
Yeah, nurses!
Ugh, I love 'em.

00:10:45.811 --> 00:10:49.648
But my mom, she--
that was the moment, you know?

00:10:49.648 --> 00:10:51.716
And they give her a little bit
of a thing,

00:10:51.716 --> 00:10:53.152
and called me
her little fuzzy bear

00:10:53.152 --> 00:10:54.820
and she went into a coma.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.690
And that was it; that was the
last time I ever talked to her.

00:10:57.690 --> 00:10:59.558
She stayed in that coma for
a couple of days, though.

00:10:59.558 --> 00:11:01.593
She didn't come out of it,
and I was like...

00:11:01.593 --> 00:11:03.529
I couldn't--I wanted to stick
around, but I couldn't,

00:11:03.529 --> 00:11:05.097
'cause I have a family
I have to support.

00:11:05.097 --> 00:11:07.733
I gotta keep doing shows
and it's, as much as it sucks,

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:12.204
I flew away, and I landed and I
had to go on stage next night.

00:11:12.204 --> 00:11:13.906
I got a phone call
just before going on stage

00:11:13.906 --> 00:11:15.341
that she passed away.

00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:17.242
It was like 30 minutes
before going onstage.

00:11:17.242 --> 00:11:19.512
You know, I was just--
I was dying.

00:11:19.512 --> 00:11:21.514
I was dying,
but I went onstage.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:22.948
I got in front of people
like you,

00:11:22.948 --> 00:11:24.683
and I just got up there
and I...

00:11:24.683 --> 00:11:28.720
And people acted like, that's
horrible that you went onstage,

00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:30.522
told jokes the night
your mom died.

00:11:30.522 --> 00:11:32.924
No, it was fuckin' an oasis.

00:11:32.924 --> 00:11:35.094
It was the best thing
I ever experienced,

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:38.197
'cause it was everything that
she put in me to become this,

00:11:38.197 --> 00:11:40.365
to do comedy, to be in front
of people.

00:11:40.365 --> 00:11:41.700
It invigorated me.

00:11:41.700 --> 00:11:44.436
And I just--and I loved it.
I loved it.

00:11:44.436 --> 00:11:47.038
Now, in quick epilogue,
about two years ago,

00:11:47.038 --> 00:11:49.541
I was back home in my hometown.

00:11:49.541 --> 00:11:51.276
And I got a phone call
from my sister again.

00:11:51.276 --> 00:11:53.546
Oh, she's always bringing
good news.

00:11:53.546 --> 00:11:57.382
And, uh...
[laughs]

00:11:57.382 --> 00:11:59.451
And she calls and she goes, uh,

00:11:59.451 --> 00:12:01.620
"Listen, it looks
like Dad's dying,"

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:05.157
and I go, oh,
huh, that's too bad.

00:12:05.157 --> 00:12:07.226
And, uh...
[laughs]

00:12:07.226 --> 00:12:09.094
And she goes, "Well, there's
nobody there with him.

00:12:09.094 --> 00:12:11.964
"He's all alone and you're only
a couple hours away.

00:12:11.964 --> 00:12:13.431
And it's up to you."

00:12:13.431 --> 00:12:16.635
I remember staying up that night
and just going agh, ugh,

00:12:16.635 --> 00:12:18.470
and I ended up waking up at
five in the morning,

00:12:18.470 --> 00:12:21.140
and I drove and I drove and went
and saw him in the hospital.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:24.744
And there he was,
this bitter...

00:12:24.744 --> 00:12:28.580
Just bitter, frail, thin man,
lying in the bed.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:31.650
None of the awful stuff he did
really--

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:33.418
didn't look like he was capable
of it anymore,

00:12:33.418 --> 00:12:35.921
just lying there, emaciated,
just...and the thing...

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:38.290
And I had all these things
I wanted to tell him, you know?

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.526
All this--how his religion
fucked up my life

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:42.294
and all this stuff
I wanted to say.

00:12:42.294 --> 00:12:44.596
I wanted to whisper in his ear
and tell him he didn't deserve

00:12:44.596 --> 00:12:49.768
the nothingness he was
about to encounter.

00:12:49.768 --> 00:12:51.436
Yeah, it's a fucked up thought,
isn't it,

00:12:51.436 --> 00:12:55.674
for a religious person?

00:12:55.674 --> 00:12:57.476
But I didn't.
I didn't.

00:12:57.476 --> 00:13:00.946
I saw him, 'cause I was raised
by my mom, not him.

00:13:00.946 --> 00:13:03.682
And I just held his hand
and I watched him.

00:13:03.682 --> 00:13:05.717
And the weirdest thing
fucking happened.

00:13:05.717 --> 00:13:09.020
Nurse came in.
My dad was in a lot of pain.

00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:12.391
And asked "What do you want?
Do you want--

00:13:12.391 --> 00:13:14.460
Do you want us to give him
some pain medication?"

00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.962
And I was like...
[chuckles]

00:13:16.962 --> 00:13:20.466
You gotta be kidding me.
No! I want you to wake him up.

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:21.566
I want him to feel
every fucking bit of this,

00:13:21.566 --> 00:13:25.371
is what I thought to myself.

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:26.871
But I didn't.

00:13:26.871 --> 00:13:29.641
I told them to give him
the pain medication.

00:13:29.641 --> 00:13:33.312
Because there was a weird lesson
in my mom showing me that porn.

00:13:35.714 --> 00:13:37.583
There was! There's this
weird little lesson

00:13:37.583 --> 00:13:39.484
in my mom showing me this porn
where she told me

00:13:39.484 --> 00:13:41.053
not to look at
these little objects,

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:43.855
to look at just a vagina
and think that was a woman.

00:13:43.855 --> 00:13:47.359
It's just like him; I can't see
him as just an asshole.

00:13:47.359 --> 00:13:50.496
He's not.
He's an entire person.

00:13:52.531 --> 00:13:54.532
And in that last moment,
I made the right decision,

00:13:54.532 --> 00:13:58.337
and we...and he passed away
without pain.

00:13:58.337 --> 00:14:00.939
And that's my happy
little story!
