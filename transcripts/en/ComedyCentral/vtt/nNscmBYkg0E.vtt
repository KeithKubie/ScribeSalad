00:00:02.801 --> 00:00:06.139
- [whispering] This is a...

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:10.210
Eating ASMR relaxation video.

00:00:16.615 --> 00:00:19.686
These pickles are so cold.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.058
Oh, my God.
That looks so freaking good.

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:33.600
[crunching]

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.675
- She's pounding pickles

00:00:42.708 --> 00:00:44.710
like she's cramping up
in the fourth quarter.

00:00:44.743 --> 00:00:47.747
That lady giving oral
to your eardrums is Spirit

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.116
and she's a "big dill" online.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:52.718
Heh-heh. Relish that joke.

00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:55.221
She's the creator of
a popular ASMR channel

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:56.556
where people can chill out

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:59.092
to the sweet sounds
of her chewing food.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:01.160
Whatever happened to
throwing on some Sade

00:01:01.193 --> 00:01:02.695
and taking a hot bath?

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.097
Or, if you really wanna unwind,

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:05.398
a handful of Xanax

00:01:05.431 --> 00:01:07.166
and huffing some glue.

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:09.168
ASMR is short for something

00:01:09.201 --> 00:01:11.237
you will never remember,
so why bother?

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.306
Like meditation, chiropractors,
and therapy,

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:15.108
it's a complete waste of time

00:01:15.141 --> 00:01:17.610
and we're all secretly
judging you for needing it.

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:19.745
It's meant to give you
a tingling sensation

00:01:19.778 --> 00:01:21.614
along your meridian, which

00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:24.250
I'm guessing is a five-dollar
word for boner.

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:26.352
We all know there are
a bunch of pervs out there

00:01:26.385 --> 00:01:27.587
masturbating to Spirit.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.455
Hell, even I think about it

00:01:29.488 --> 00:01:31.657
when I hear her
crunching those Clausen's.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.759
Most women don't like to eat
in front anyone,

00:01:33.792 --> 00:01:35.628
so I applaud Spirit
for doing it in front of

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:37.396
every creep on the Internet.

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.332
That's why I invited her
to stuff her face

00:01:39.365 --> 00:01:41.801
at my very conservative
Tosh Family Thanksgiving

00:01:41.834 --> 00:01:43.636
for this week's
Ce-web-rity Profile.

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:46.506
[cheers and applause]

00:01:49.275 --> 00:01:50.676
- Dear, Jesus,

00:01:50.709 --> 00:01:52.745
bless this food,

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:54.480
bless this family,

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:57.617
and bless Daniel's
interesting new friend...

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.218
Spirit?

00:01:59.251 --> 00:02:00.520
- Knock it off, Dad.

00:02:00.553 --> 00:02:03.189
all: Amen.

00:02:03.222 --> 00:02:05.324
- Thank you, Spirit,
for joining us.

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:07.593
- Thank you so much, Daniel.
I appreciate it.

00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:09.562
- Are you named
after the airline?

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:10.730
- [laughs]

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:12.665
- Shh!

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:15.935
- How long have you been
making ASMR videos?

00:02:15.968 --> 00:02:18.604
- Um, I started in 2015.

00:02:18.637 --> 00:02:20.339
- How many videos
have you made?

00:02:20.372 --> 00:02:23.176
- 1,199.

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.478
- Holy [bleep].

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:28.314
What does ASMR stand for?

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:31.584
- Autonomous sensory
meridian response.

00:02:31.617 --> 00:02:34.353
- Why do people enjoy
listening to this?

00:02:34.386 --> 00:02:37.723
- It makes you feel calm
and relax

00:02:37.756 --> 00:02:41.360
and it makes you just feel
so good all over.

00:02:41.393 --> 00:02:43.362
- Let's talk about your eating.

00:02:43.395 --> 00:02:45.364
You're not supposed to talk
with your mouth full.

00:02:45.397 --> 00:02:48.968
Does that affect your videos?

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.404
- When I first moved in,

00:02:51.437 --> 00:02:53.973
the people were loud and--

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.309
it's so, so quiet here.

00:02:56.342 --> 00:02:58.344
<i> That's the whole purpose
 of it,</i>

00:02:58.377 --> 00:03:01.314
seeing the food,
seeing the way my mouth opens,

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:04.383
seeing the way my tongue
clicks and moves.

00:03:04.416 --> 00:03:06.686
I know it's different
and it's unique,

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:10.356
but it actually really relaxes
many, many people.

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:12.525
- What won't you eat on camera?

00:03:12.558 --> 00:03:14.627
- Probably you won't see me
eat meat.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.963
- Wait, so you are
a vegetarian?

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:18.831
- You're vegetarian?

00:03:18.864 --> 00:03:20.666
That's strike two, Kaepernick.

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:22.668
- We didn't steal this country
from the Indians

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:24.870
so you could sit there
and eat vegetables.

00:03:24.903 --> 00:03:26.372
- If we don't eat meat,

00:03:26.405 --> 00:03:27.940
the animals win.

00:03:27.973 --> 00:03:30.610
- Shh!
- Uh, what about the fish?

00:03:30.643 --> 00:03:32.645
- Well, right now I'm having
a issue with the fish

00:03:32.678 --> 00:03:34.413
'cause I love salmon,

00:03:34.446 --> 00:03:36.882
but I took a trip one day
with my children

00:03:36.915 --> 00:03:39.652
and there was a whole bunch
of fish in a hotel pool

00:03:39.685 --> 00:03:41.754
and they was, like,
communicating with me.

00:03:41.787 --> 00:03:44.523
So now I'm having a problem
with eating fish.

00:03:44.556 --> 00:03:47.393
- Spirit, are you
a little crazy?

00:03:47.426 --> 00:03:48.995
- Yeah!
- Okay.

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:50.863
Would you pass the dark meat?

00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:52.999
Or did you ban it
from the table?

00:03:58.003 --> 00:04:00.506
- Oh, my God,
did you dip that in butter?

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:02.908
- Yeah, my mom's turkey's
kinda dry.

00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:04.543
[slimy munching]

00:04:04.576 --> 00:04:06.712
- You sound like you're
eating chewing gum.

00:04:06.745 --> 00:04:09.382
[chewing noises]

00:04:09.415 --> 00:04:11.684
[laughs]

00:04:13.752 --> 00:04:16.355
- Why are you always using
plastic silverware

00:04:16.388 --> 00:04:18.858
in your videos?

00:04:18.891 --> 00:04:23.396
- Because it won't be
so harsh on the ears.

00:04:23.429 --> 00:04:25.464
Because imagine someone
taking a knife and fork

00:04:25.497 --> 00:04:27.566
and just scraping it against--

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:28.934
- That's not relaxing.

00:04:28.967 --> 00:04:32.405
[chewing noises]

00:04:32.438 --> 00:04:33.472
- Mmm.

00:04:33.505 --> 00:04:36.842
[silverware clacking]

00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:39.612
- Lot of celery
in this stuffing.

00:04:39.645 --> 00:04:42.482
[munching]

00:04:50.723 --> 00:04:53.693
[munching intensifies]

00:04:53.726 --> 00:04:54.994
- Shh!

00:04:57.062 --> 00:04:59.532
- What's your favorite food
to eat?

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:02.101
- Actually, my favorite,
favorite food to eat on camera

00:05:02.134 --> 00:05:03.636
is a pickle.

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.506
[munching]

00:05:11.777 --> 00:05:14.013
[chomping]

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:19.385
<i> - So many pickle videos.</i>

00:05:19.418 --> 00:05:21.354
Why do you like pickles so much?

00:05:21.387 --> 00:05:22.488
- Tastes like vinegar.

00:05:22.521 --> 00:05:25.091
- Ugh! Vinegar's so gross.

00:05:25.124 --> 00:05:26.692
Pork rinds?

00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:28.794
- No, thank you.

00:05:28.827 --> 00:05:30.096
- Don't mind if I do.

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:33.799
[crunching]

00:05:33.832 --> 00:05:34.667
- Wow.

00:05:37.903 --> 00:05:39.839
[laughs]

00:05:39.872 --> 00:05:41.874
- Not good.

00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:44.744
I want to ask
about your crab leg video.

00:05:44.777 --> 00:05:47.079
- Yeah.
- You eat crab legs...

00:05:47.112 --> 00:05:48.848
- Yeah.
- Like an insane person.

00:05:48.881 --> 00:05:51.150
[crunching]

00:05:51.183 --> 00:05:54.086
Nobody starts
by biting the knuckle.

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:56.789
You're eating just the body.
Just was so--

00:05:56.822 --> 00:05:58.090
I couldn't handle it.

00:05:58.123 --> 00:05:59.925
- I'm so sorry.

00:05:59.958 --> 00:06:02.962
- What's the most beautiful
sound in the world?

00:06:02.995 --> 00:06:04.463
- Raindrops.

00:06:04.496 --> 00:06:06.565
- I was gonna say
you eating hot Cheetos.

00:06:06.598 --> 00:06:07.967
- [laughs]

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.070
[crunching]

00:06:11.103 --> 00:06:13.539
It is crunchy.

00:06:13.572 --> 00:06:16.041
- What's your favorite sound
to fall asleep to?

00:06:16.074 --> 00:06:17.042
- Tapping.

00:06:17.075 --> 00:06:19.512
[tapping]

00:06:19.545 --> 00:06:21.480
- Sounds like somebody's
breaking in your house.

00:06:21.513 --> 00:06:22.915
That's not relaxing.

00:06:22.948 --> 00:06:25.418
Like a serial killer.

00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:27.553
Tapping on the glass.

00:06:27.586 --> 00:06:29.522
What's your favorite holiday?

00:06:29.555 --> 00:06:30.923
- I love Thanksgiving.

00:06:30.956 --> 00:06:32.625
I love smelling the food,

00:06:32.658 --> 00:06:35.828
the pies,
the macaroni and cheese,

00:06:35.861 --> 00:06:37.696
the corn on the cob--
oh, my God.

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:38.864
- Corn on the cob?

00:06:38.897 --> 00:06:40.766
That's out of season
at Thanksgiving.

00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:42.034
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is!

00:06:42.067 --> 00:06:43.602
- No, it's not.
- You don't have corn

00:06:43.635 --> 00:06:45.471
on the cob at Thanksgiving.
- Yes, you do.

00:06:45.504 --> 00:06:47.440
- That's not true.
- It comes out of the--

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:49.008
- No, there's no cobs--

00:06:49.041 --> 00:06:50.810
- You can buy it frozen,
you know.

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:52.044
- Nobody wants frozen
corn on the cob.

00:06:52.077 --> 00:06:53.446
- [laughs]

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:54.947
- Shh!
- It.

00:06:56.248 --> 00:06:57.550
What's your favorite pie?

00:06:57.583 --> 00:06:58.884
- Sweet potato pie.

00:06:58.917 --> 00:07:00.920
- That's not--
it's not even that good.

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:02.655
- It is!
Pumpkin pie sucks.

00:07:02.688 --> 00:07:04.123
- I hate pumpkin pie too.

00:07:04.156 --> 00:07:05.791
- I can't stand it.
Why do people eat pumpkin?

00:07:05.824 --> 00:07:08.928
- Ugh.
- Oh, my gosh, a wishbone.

00:07:08.961 --> 00:07:09.962
- [gasps]

00:07:11.663 --> 00:07:14.033
You won.
You get to make a wish.

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:17.570
Now I get three gravy wishes.

00:07:18.804 --> 00:07:22.141
Do you have any favorite
ASMR artists

00:07:22.174 --> 00:07:23.809
that you like to listen to?

00:07:23.842 --> 00:07:25.744
- [laughs]

00:07:25.777 --> 00:07:28.614
[laughing]

00:07:30.082 --> 00:07:31.584
- Is this a weird question?

00:07:31.617 --> 00:07:34.119
I don't even know
what I've stumbled across.

00:07:34.152 --> 00:07:37.056
- Well, I actually
don't really want to say,

00:07:37.089 --> 00:07:39.625
but I do listen to
a young guy

00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:42.862
and he pretends to be a doctor.

00:07:42.895 --> 00:07:45.531
- Oh, you got a little freak
in you, huh?

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:46.832
- [laughing]

00:07:46.865 --> 00:07:48.567
Oh, my God.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.970
- There's nothing to be
ashamed of.

00:07:51.003 --> 00:07:53.739
You want a little doctor
talking to you at night.

00:07:55.707 --> 00:07:57.677
- Happy birthday, America.

00:08:05.984 --> 00:08:08.287
- It's time to go around
the table and say

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.156
what we're all thankful for.

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:13.192
- I'm thankful that I moved
across the country

00:08:13.225 --> 00:08:16.529
to get away from you buttholes.

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:18.597
And I'm thankful for Rihanna.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:20.566
- I'm thankful for Trump.

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:22.101
- Trump.

00:08:22.134 --> 00:08:23.636 line:92%
- Trump.

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:24.737
- Trump.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:26.672 line:92%
- Trump!

00:08:26.705 --> 00:08:27.873
- Pickles.

00:08:27.906 --> 00:08:29.709
[jar lid squeaking]

00:08:33.779 --> 00:08:35.848
[sloshing]

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:40.953
[crunching]

00:08:43.021 --> 00:08:45.558
[baby crying]

00:08:46.959 --> 00:08:49.295
[thud, baby screams]

00:08:51.029 --> 00:08:53.265
- That's better.

00:08:53.298 --> 00:08:56.135
