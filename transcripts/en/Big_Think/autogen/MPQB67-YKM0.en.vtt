people and in that we've worked with the
 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.790
people and in that we've worked with the
telecoms on lower-cost computers tablets

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800
telecoms on lower-cost computers tablets
 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.099

so they'll take their business models

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109
so they'll take their business models
 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.560
so they'll take their business models
and adjust them so you can have lower

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570
and adjust them so you can have lower
 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.620

just like as happened on the voice file

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
just like as happened on the voice file
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.370
just like as happened on the voice file
that way you reach far far more people

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
that way you reach far far more people
 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.050
that way you reach far far more people
now if you're reaching far far more

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060
now if you're reaching far far more
 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.340
now if you're reaching far far more
people people who take their computers

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350

on from schools they can use them in the

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840
on from schools they can use them in the
 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.469
on from schools they can use them in the
schools the university students can

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479

schools the university students can
afford laptops and capabilities in there

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750
afford laptops and capabilities in there
 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.440
afford laptops and capabilities in there
so it's really about affordability and

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450
so it's really about affordability and
 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.440
so it's really about affordability and
reach and then Intel we just build the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450
reach and then Intel we just build the
 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.140
reach and then Intel we just build the
comms communications capabilities into

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420
 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.850
well obviously over time the price of

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860
well obviously over time the price of
 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.980
well obviously over time the price of
computers has been coming down you can

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990
computers has been coming down you can
 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.930
computers has been coming down you can

you can get entry level computers for
 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:49.980
you can get entry level computers for
maybe $200 but then his hundred-dollar

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990
maybe $200 but then his hundred-dollar
 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.170
maybe $200 but then his hundred-dollar

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:52.180
tablets around and there's lower cost
 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.330
tablets around and there's lower cost
than that smartphones and there's a

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340
than that smartphones and there's a
 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.120
than that smartphones and there's a
spectrum of capabilities obviously the

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130
spectrum of capabilities obviously the
 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.700
spectrum of capabilities obviously the
higher price ones do a bit more but you

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710
higher price ones do a bit more but you
 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.950
higher price ones do a bit more but you
can do some great basic computing

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960
can do some great basic computing
 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.469

a tablet and a low-cost smartphone now
with that we found over the years that

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:10.509
with that we found over the years that
 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.030
with that we found over the years that
the cost of the broadband can actually

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040
the cost of the broadband can actually
 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.740
the cost of the broadband can actually
be much higher than the cost of the

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750
be much higher than the cost of the
 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.840
be much higher than the cost of the
device as we work with the telecom

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850
