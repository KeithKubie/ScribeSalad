00:00:08.014 --> 00:00:12.505
The most basic function of bodily fat
is self-storage of food reserves.

00:00:12.505 --> 00:00:15.821
In prehistoric times, natural selection
favored genotypes

00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:19.949
that could endure harsh conditions
by stocking the most fat.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.819
With chronic malnutrition being
the norm for most of human history,

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:26.693
genetics evolved to favor fat storage.

00:00:26.693 --> 00:00:29.543
So when did body fat become problematic?

00:00:29.543 --> 00:00:33.862
The negative impacts of being overweight
were not even noted in medical literature

00:00:33.862 --> 00:00:36.754
until as late as the 18th century.

00:00:36.754 --> 00:00:40.257
Then, technological advances coupled
with public health measures

00:00:40.257 --> 00:00:45.451
resulted in the betterment of the
quantity, quality, and variety of food.

00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:49.145
Sustained abundance of good food
enabled a healthier population

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:51.225
to boom economically.

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:54.480
Output increased,
and with it, leisure time

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.476
and waistlines.

00:00:56.476 --> 00:01:00.855
By the mid 19th century, being excessively
overweight, or obese,

00:01:00.855 --> 00:01:04.108
was recognized as a cause of ill health,

00:01:04.108 --> 00:01:07.487
and another century later, 
declared deadly.

00:01:07.487 --> 00:01:12.399
What is the distinction between being
overweight and being obese?

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.648
A calculation called the BMI
breaks it down for us.

00:01:16.648 --> 00:01:20.079
For example, if someone weighs
65 kilgorams

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.792
and is 1.5 meters tall,

00:01:22.792 --> 00:01:26.226
they have a BMI of about 29.

00:01:26.226 --> 00:01:29.110
Obesity is a condition of excess body fat

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.985
that occurs when a person's BMI
is above 30,

00:01:32.985 --> 00:01:37.445
just over the overweight range
of 25 to 29.9.

00:01:37.445 --> 00:01:41.010
While BMI can be a helpful estimate
of healthy weight,

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.257
actual body fat percentage can only
really be determined

00:01:44.257 --> 00:01:47.974
by also considering information
like waist circumference

00:01:47.974 --> 00:01:49.859
and muscle mass.

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:53.203
Athletes, for instance, have a naturally
higher BMI.

00:01:53.203 --> 00:01:56.331
So how does a person become obese?

00:01:56.331 --> 00:02:00.359
At its most basic, obesity is caused
by energy imbalance.

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:03.135
If the energy input from calories

00:02:03.135 --> 00:02:06.574
is greater than the energy output
from physical activity,

00:02:06.574 --> 00:02:10.286
the body stores the extra calories as fat.

00:02:10.286 --> 00:02:14.455
In most cases, this imbalance comes
from a combination of circumstances

00:02:14.455 --> 00:02:16.479
and choices.

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:21.113
Adults should be getting at least
2.5 hours of exercise each week,

00:02:21.113 --> 00:02:23.756
and children a whole hour per day.

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:28.133
But globally, one in four adults
and eight out of ten adolescents

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:29.856
aren't active enough.

00:02:29.856 --> 00:02:33.474
Calorie-dense processed foods
and growing portion sizes

00:02:33.474 --> 00:02:35.516
coupled with pervasive marketing

00:02:35.516 --> 00:02:38.043
lead to passive overeating.

00:02:38.043 --> 00:02:39.383
And scarce resources,

00:02:39.383 --> 00:02:42.418
and a lack of access to healthy,
affordable foods

00:02:42.418 --> 00:02:46.579
creates an even greater risk
in disadvantaged communities.

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.443
Yet, our genetic makeup also plays a part.

00:02:49.443 --> 00:02:51.854
Studies on families and on separated twins

00:02:51.854 --> 00:02:56.351
have shown a clear causal hereditary
relationship to weight gain.

00:02:56.351 --> 00:02:59.258
Recent studies have also found
a link between obesity

00:02:59.258 --> 00:03:04.288
and variations in the bacteria species
that live in our digestive systems.

00:03:04.288 --> 00:03:09.255
No matter the cause, obesity is
an escalating global epidemic.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:12.790
It substantially raises the probability
of diseases,

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.136
like diabetes,

00:03:14.136 --> 00:03:15.254
heart disease,

00:03:15.254 --> 00:03:16.817
stroke,

00:03:16.817 --> 00:03:18.322
high blood pressure,

00:03:18.322 --> 00:03:19.974
and cancer.

00:03:19.974 --> 00:03:24.474
It affects virtually all ages, genders,
and socioeconomic groups

00:03:24.474 --> 00:03:27.512
in both developed 
and developing countries.

00:03:27.512 --> 00:03:32.350
With a 60% rise in child obesity globally
over just two decades,

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.666
the problem is too significant to ignore.

00:03:35.666 --> 00:03:41.038
Once a person is obese, the climb
to recovery becomes progressively steeper.

00:03:41.038 --> 00:03:45.852
Hormonal and metabolic changes reduce
the body's response to overeating.

00:03:45.852 --> 00:03:50.512
After losing weight, a formerly overweight
person burns less calories

00:03:50.512 --> 00:03:52.256
doing the same exercises

00:03:52.256 --> 00:03:55.199
as a person who is naturally 
the same weight,

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.668
making it much more difficult
to shed the excess fat.

00:03:58.668 --> 00:04:00.165
And as people gain weight,

00:04:00.165 --> 00:04:03.756
damage to signaling pathways makes it
increasingly difficult

00:04:03.756 --> 00:04:07.165
for the brain to measure food intake
and fat storage.

00:04:07.165 --> 00:04:08.759
There is, however, some evidence

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:11.757
that well-monitored, 
long-term changes in behavior

00:04:11.757 --> 00:04:15.701
can lead to improvements 
in obesity-related health issues.

00:04:15.701 --> 00:04:18.418
And weight loss from sustained 
lifestyle changes,

00:04:18.418 --> 00:04:21.163
or invasive treatments 
like bariatric surgery,

00:04:21.163 --> 00:04:25.069
can improve insulin resistance
and decrease inflammation.

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:29.611
What was once an advantage for survival
is now working against us.

00:04:29.611 --> 00:04:33.415
As the world's population continues
to slow down and get bigger,

00:04:33.415 --> 00:04:37.080
moving and consciously eating our way
towards a healthier weight

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.070
is essential to our overall well-being.

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.977
And with the epidemic affecting
every country in the world

00:04:42.977 --> 00:04:45.119
for different socioeconomic reasons,

00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:48.569
obesity cannot be seen 
as an isolated issue.

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:50.643
More global measures for prevention

00:04:50.643 --> 00:04:53.355
are essential to manage 
the weight of the world.
