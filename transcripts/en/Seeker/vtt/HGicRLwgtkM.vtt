00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.279
Humans and horses have had a strong connection
for generations.

00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:08.710
But that connection may be even stronger than
we thought.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.420
Hey animal lovers, Lissette here for DNews.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.260
When I was a little girl, I wanted a pony.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.380
They’re so beautiful and majestic, but today
science is telling us they’re also pretty

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.380
smart.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.390
In a recent study published in the journal
Biology Letters, researchers found that horses

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.430
can distinguish between different human facial
expressions.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.400
They were able to figure this out by showing
the horses photographs of either angry or

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.070
happy male faces and then noting the horses’
responses.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.940
When the horses were presented with an angry
face, they exhibited left-gaze bias.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.489
This basically means that the horses turned
their heads to look more with their left eye

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.290
towards the right side of the face on the
photograph.

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:53.160
When they were presented with a happy face,
they didn’t express this same bias.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.440
In the case of the horses, this left-gaze
bias with the angry faces versus the happy

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.550
human faces, showed that they could detect
a difference between these two human expressions.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.840
Left-gaze bias is also used to study emotions
in both humans and animals, and although it

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.869
may vary by species, some studies have shown
emotions are perceived as more prominently

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.670
expressed on the right side of a person’s
face.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.740
So, as you might guess, animals detecting
different human facial expressions isn’t

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.740
something new…

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.689
According to research, other animals like
dogs and pigeonscan distinguish between faces

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:27.430
and expressions.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.999
Researchers at the University of Iowa, found
that pigeons can see similarities among human

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:35.169
faces when it comes to identity and emotion.

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:39.179
Essentially, the pigeons could tell when the
photographs they were shown were of the same

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:43.079
person and when the emotions of different
people were similar.

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.599
And, the research on dogs is particularly
robust.

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:51.669
In one study, researchers at Azabu University,
found dogs could learn to pick out photographs

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:55.520
of smiling human faces from those with blank
expressions.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.680
And researchers from Kyoto University showed
that dogs can match their owner’s face to

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.090
their owner’s voice.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.270
Furthermore, a study on 22 dogs from the University
of Lincoln showed a very similar result to

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.349
the horse study.

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:12.819
The dogs more strongly exhibited a left-gaze
bias when they looked at negative facial expressions

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.260
than positive ones.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.340
So if this dog study shows a similar result
to this new horse study, what makes it so

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.340
special?

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.421
Well, because in addition to measuring the
horses’ external physical reactions, researchers

00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:28.239
also collected internal data - specifically
their heart rate.

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.439
The horses’ heart rates accelerated at different
rates depending on whether the faces shown

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:34.530
were angry or happy ones.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.879
As one of the researchers explains, “The
reaction to the angry facial expressions was

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.750
particularly clear -- there was a quicker
increase in their heart rate."

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:43.980
Which is huge!

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.590
According to the researchers, this makes it
the first in all animal studies to show a

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.969
differential heart rate response to human
facial expressions.

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:57.040
It suggests that on top of recognizing the
difference between what the two facial expressions

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.480
look like, the horse might know what the angry
expression means.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.150
A rapidly increasing heart rate is associated
with threatening situations.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.060
Again, to quote one of the study’s researchers,
“in this context, recognising angry faces

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.700
may act as a warning system, allowing horses
to anticipate negative human behaviour such

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.859
as rough handling.”

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.530
This makes sense as horses are highly social
animals, and emotional awareness is helpful

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.730
to the functioning and survival of highly
social groups.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:29.739
Now, as one of the researchers points out,
we can’t conclude from this research that

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.159
horses evolved an ability to recognize human
faces because of co-evolution with humans

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:40.160
or if each individual horse simply learned
how to read faces during its own lifetime.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.859
Or it could be because of something else.

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.829
But what’s clear is that horses may be more
clued into our emotions than we think.

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:47.893
Maybe horses should be man’s best friend?

00:03:47.893 --> 00:03:48.893
What do you think?

00:03:48.893 --> 00:03:49.893

00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:53.719
So if some animals can recognize our emotions,
does this mean they can also feel some of

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.370
the same emotions we do?

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.629

can empathize to find out
