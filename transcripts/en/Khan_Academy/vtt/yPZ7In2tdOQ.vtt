00:00:00.411 --> 00:00:02.349
- [Voiceover] Let's see if we
can simplify this expression.

00:00:02.349 --> 00:00:05.230
So pause the video and have a try at it,

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:08.200
and then we're gonna do
it together right now.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.069
All right, so when you look at this,

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:11.741
it looks like both the
numerator and denominator,

00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:13.401
they might, you might
be able to factor them,

00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:15.143
and maybe they have some common factors

00:00:15.143 --> 00:00:18.023
that you can divide the
numerator and the denominator by

00:00:18.023 --> 00:00:19.322
to simplify it.

00:00:19.322 --> 00:00:21.400
So let's first try to
factor the numerator.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.325
X to the fourth, plus eight
x squared, plus seven.

00:00:24.325 --> 00:00:25.962
At first it might be
a little intimidating,

00:00:25.962 --> 00:00:27.739
because you have an x to the fourth here.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:29.004
It's not a quadratic;

00:00:29.004 --> 00:00:30.838
it's a fourth degree polynomial,

00:00:30.838 --> 00:00:34.239
but like any, if you,
like a lot of quadratics

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.186
that we've seen in the past,
it does seem to have a pattern.

00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:39.682
For example, if this said x squared

00:00:39.682 --> 00:00:43.361
plus eight x plus seven,

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:44.940
you'd say, oh, well, this
is pretty straightforward

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:45.839
to factor.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:47.532
What two numbers add up to eight

00:00:47.532 --> 00:00:49.251
and when I take their product I get seven?

00:00:49.251 --> 00:00:51.677
Well, there's only two numbers
where you take their product

00:00:51.677 --> 00:00:54.138
and you get positive seven
that are going to be positive,

00:00:54.138 --> 00:00:56.936
and they need to be
positive, if they're going to

00:00:56.936 --> 00:00:59.594
add up to positive eight,
and that's one and seven.

00:00:59.594 --> 00:01:02.009
So this would be x plus seven

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:05.387
times x plus one.

00:01:05.387 --> 00:01:07.036
Well, if you just think of,

00:01:07.036 --> 00:01:09.520
instead of thinking in
terms of x and x squared,

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.901
if you just think in terms of x squared

00:01:10.901 --> 00:01:11.958
and x to the fourth, it's going to be

00:01:11.958 --> 00:01:13.339
the exact same thing.

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:15.440
So this thing can be written as

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.018
x squared plus seven

00:01:18.018 --> 00:01:21.303
times x squared plus one.

00:01:21.303 --> 00:01:23.602
If you want, you can do
some type of a substitution

00:01:23.602 --> 00:01:28.148
saying, saying that a
is equaled to x squared,

00:01:28.148 --> 00:01:32.223
in which case, so if you said
that a is equal to x squared,

00:01:32.223 --> 00:01:35.427
then this thing would become a squared

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:38.585
plus eight a plus seven,

00:01:38.585 --> 00:01:41.464
and then you would factor this into

00:01:41.464 --> 00:01:45.364
a plus seven and a plus one,

00:01:45.364 --> 00:01:48.023
and then you would undo the substitution,

00:01:48.023 --> 00:01:49.439
and that's x squared plus seven

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.584
and x squared plus one.

00:01:50.584 --> 00:01:52.105
But hopefully you see
what's going on here;

00:01:52.105 --> 00:01:55.402
this is the higher order term,

00:01:55.402 --> 00:01:57.956
and then this is half the degree of that,

00:01:57.956 --> 00:01:59.732
so it fits this mold.

00:01:59.732 --> 00:02:01.032
And so you could do a substitution,

00:02:01.032 --> 00:02:02.368
or you could just recognize, oh okay,

00:02:02.368 --> 00:02:04.689
instead of dealing with x squared,

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.895
I'm dealing with x to the fourth.

00:02:06.895 --> 00:02:09.147
All right, so that's the numerator.

00:02:09.147 --> 00:02:10.749
Now let's think about,

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:12.885
let's think about the denominator.

00:02:12.885 --> 00:02:15.149
So the denominator, both of these terms

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:17.169
are divisible by three x.

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.048
So let's factor out a three x.

00:02:20.048 --> 00:02:22.474
So it's three x times,

00:02:22.474 --> 00:02:24.089
three x times,

00:02:24.089 --> 00:02:25.667
if you factor out a three x here,

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:26.944
three divided by three is one,

00:02:26.944 --> 00:02:30.972
x to the fifth divided
by x is x to the fourth,

00:02:30.972 --> 00:02:33.712
and then if you factor out a three x here,

00:02:33.712 --> 00:02:35.465
you're just gonna get one.

00:02:35.465 --> 00:02:38.030
And so far this doesn't seem too helpful.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:39.783
I don't see an x to the fourth minus one,

00:02:39.783 --> 00:02:41.567
or a three x in the numerator,

00:02:41.567 --> 00:02:43.645
but maybe I can factor this out further,

00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:45.294
x to the fourth minus one.

00:02:45.294 --> 00:02:48.254
And that's because it is
a difference of squares.

00:02:48.254 --> 00:02:50.066
And you might say, wait, I'm always used

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:51.690
to recognizing a difference of squares

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.815
as something like a squared minus one,

00:02:53.815 --> 00:02:56.450
which you could write as a plus one

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.191
times a minus one.

00:02:59.191 --> 00:03:01.326
Well, this would be a squared minus one

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:05.749
if you say that a is equal to x squared.

00:03:05.749 --> 00:03:08.349
Then this would be a squared minus one.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.404
So let's rewrite all of this.

00:03:10.404 --> 00:03:12.273
So let's rewrite.

00:03:12.273 --> 00:03:14.004
So this is all going to be equal to,

00:03:14.004 --> 00:03:15.744
same numerator,

00:03:15.744 --> 00:03:17.079
let's see, let's do it in green.

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:18.194
Same numerator:

00:03:18.194 --> 00:03:21.990
x squared plus seven, can't
factor that out any more,

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.972
times x squared plus one,
can't factor that out any more,

00:03:25.972 --> 00:03:29.421
all of that over three x,

00:03:29.421 --> 00:03:32.159
but this I can view as
a difference of squares.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:33.901
So this is x squared squared,

00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:35.537
and this is obviously one squared,

00:03:35.537 --> 00:03:38.672
so this is going to be x squared plus one

00:03:38.672 --> 00:03:41.794
times x squared minus,

00:03:41.794 --> 00:03:44.739
times x squared minus one.

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.806
Now clearly have an x
squared in the numerator,

00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:48.133
x squared minus one in the numerator,

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:50.054
x squared, sorry, x squared
plus one in the numerator,

00:03:50.054 --> 00:03:52.050
x squared plus one in the denominator,

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.989
and so I could cancel them out,

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:55.788
and I'm going to be left
with, in the numerator,

00:03:55.788 --> 00:03:58.749
x squared plus seven,

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:01.135
over three x

00:04:01.135 --> 00:04:05.653
times x squared minus one.

00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:07.330
Now, this looks pretty simple,

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:08.348
and we want to be a little careful,

00:04:08.348 --> 00:04:09.888
because whenever we do this cancelling out

00:04:09.888 --> 00:04:11.072
we don't want, we want to make sure

00:04:11.072 --> 00:04:14.206
that we restrict the xes

00:04:14.206 --> 00:04:15.774
for which the expression's defined,

00:04:15.774 --> 00:04:18.537
if we want them to be
algebraically equivalent.

00:04:18.537 --> 00:04:21.381
So this one, would this be,

00:04:21.381 --> 00:04:23.459
this would obviously be undefined,

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:25.757
so x cannot be equal to zero,

00:04:25.757 --> 00:04:29.066
x cannot be equal to plus or minus one.

00:04:29.066 --> 00:04:32.467
Positive or negative one
would make this expression

00:04:32.467 --> 00:04:33.802
right over here equal zero,

00:04:33.802 --> 00:04:35.439
so it cannot be equal to zero,

00:04:35.439 --> 00:04:38.818
x cannot be equal to, I'll
write plus or minus one;

00:04:38.818 --> 00:04:40.721
that would make this part zero.

00:04:40.721 --> 00:04:43.777
But this right over here, this one,

00:04:43.777 --> 00:04:45.853
unless, we're assuming we're dealing

00:04:45.853 --> 00:04:49.109
only with real numbers, this
one can't ever equal zero

00:04:49.109 --> 00:04:50.514
if you're dealing with real numbers,

00:04:50.514 --> 00:04:52.685
because x squared is always
going to be non-negative

00:04:52.685 --> 00:04:54.532
and you're adding it to a positive value,

00:04:54.532 --> 00:04:58.211
and so this part, this
factor, would have never made

00:04:58.211 --> 00:04:59.650
the entire thing undefined.

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.612
So we can actually just factor it out,

00:05:01.612 --> 00:05:04.607
or cancel it out, without
worrying much about it.

00:05:04.607 --> 00:05:07.104
And so this is actually
algebraically equivalent

00:05:07.104 --> 00:05:09.111
to what we had originally.

00:05:09.111 --> 00:05:11.631
Now we could write these
constraints on it, if we want.

00:05:11.631 --> 00:05:13.733
If someone were to ask me, you know,

00:05:13.733 --> 00:05:16.425
for what x is this expression not defined,

00:05:16.425 --> 00:05:18.226
well, it's clear it's not defined for x,

00:05:18.226 --> 00:05:19.722
that would make the denominator zero,

00:05:19.722 --> 00:05:21.324
dividing by zero not defined,

00:05:21.324 --> 00:05:23.264
or if x is plus or minus one,

00:05:23.264 --> 00:05:24.947
it would make the denominator equal zero.

00:05:24.947 --> 00:05:27.501
But that is, that comes
straight of this expression,

00:05:27.501 --> 00:05:29.644
so this expression and
our original expression

00:05:29.644 --> 00:05:31.323
are algebraically equivalent.

00:05:31.323 --> 00:05:33.737
Now if you wanted to, you
could expand the bottom

00:05:33.737 --> 00:05:36.674
out a little bit, you could
multiply it out if you like.

00:05:36.674 --> 00:05:38.324
That's equivalent to,

00:05:38.324 --> 00:05:40.099
so x squared plus seven

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:43.500
over three x times x squared
is three x to the third

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.276
minus three x.

00:05:45.276 --> 00:05:48.899
So these are all, these are
all equivalent expressions,

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:51.110
and we are done.
