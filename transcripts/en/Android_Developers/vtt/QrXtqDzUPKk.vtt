TODD KERPELMAN: Hello
game developers,

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.080
and thank you for joining me in
this very special presentation.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.740
I apologize for
not dressing nicer.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:18.830
Actually, I have this really
nice shirt that my wife just

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.960
got me for Christmas
that I was going to wear,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.830
but if you'll notice, it's
kind of the same color

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:25.610
as our green screen background.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:26.990
And I would be
invisible for most

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.085
of the talk, which I guess
I thought at first was cool,

00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:31.460
but then decided
would be creepy.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.230
So you get t-shirt Todd.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.300
But that's OK.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.590
I still respect you.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.650
And we're going to jump
right into our talk here.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.490
This presentation is called
Play Games Best Practices.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:50.140
This is based on a talk that
I gave in November of 2013

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.220
at GDCNext, that
was formerly titled

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.930
Play Games-- What We've Learned.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.280
I've edited it somewhat,
shortened it for content,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.682
and really focused more on best
practices for implementing Play

00:01:01.682 --> 00:01:03.390
Games services, which
I think, hopefully,

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.980
you as game developers
will care most about.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.670
So with that in
mind, here we go.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.360
So when we talk
about, Play Games,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.140
what I'm really here
to talk about today

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.240
is two aspects of Play Games.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.030
First would be the set
of mobile gaming services

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.760
that we launched at Google
I/O. These include features

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.720
like achievements, leaderboards,
Cloud Save, and multi-player.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.380
This also includes the Play
Games standalone application.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.270
If you've tuned into
this presentation

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.450
because you're hoping to
hear like the five ways

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.990
to hack the Google Play Store
to get on to the top most

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.750
recent list, this
is not that talk,

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.170
and you're going to be
somewhat disappointed.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.250
Just to give you a little
history of these services,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.520
Play Games launched
at Google I/O of 2013,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.750
which means they are about
eight months old as of maybe

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:53.700
next week.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.690
We started with about
24 games at launch.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.360
I think at this point we have
well over 2,000 games that

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.410
have integrated game services.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.510
And these games
are available both

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.830
on iOS-- here you can see
some achievements on the iOS

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.229
version of Stickman Gun Fu,
I believe-- and on Android.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.180
And here we can see
some lovely achievements

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.050
for Triple Town, one
of my favorite games.

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.850
The Play Games app
launched the standalone app

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.920
in July of 2013,
which means it's

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.810
about six months old
as of this recording.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.980
So happy half-birthday,
Play Games standalone app.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.000
I don't have official numbers
to share with you right now,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.710
but if you go to the
Play store and you

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.410
look at the
application, you'll see

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.490
it's in the 10 to 50
million installs category.

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:41.670
So hopefully that will
give you a rough idea

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.490
of the number of people who
have this thing installed,

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.600
with a margin of error of plus
or minus 20 million, I guess.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.656
The point of all these
stats, by the way,

00:02:50.656 --> 00:02:52.530
is not to cheerlead,
and to not say, oh, wow,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:53.970
look how great we are.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.020
It's really just to show
you that at this point,

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:00.020
we feel like we have enough
information from all the people

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.420
using the Play Games app,
from all the developers

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.140
that have implemented
game services,

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.980
that we feel like some
patterns have emerged--

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.530
some very sexy patterns.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.760
And we feel like we now
have enough information

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.610
to give you some best practices
to kind of improve your games

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.600
and make them the best that
they can be using our platform.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.830
So with that, let's start
by talking about sign-in.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.590
So this is a tale of two sign-in
flows, one which eventually

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.490
leads to a revolution,
but hopefully

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.429
without the muskets and the
bloodshed and the decapitation.

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:35.970
So we're going to
start by taking you

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.260
through the officially
sanctioned sign-in flow,

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:43.030
as implemented by Riptide
2 GP, by our friends

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:44.290
over at Vector Unit.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.204
So this is the initial
screen that you

00:03:46.204 --> 00:03:47.870
might see if you were
to start the game.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.307
There's a little sign in
button there on the left.

00:03:50.307 --> 00:03:52.140
But you know, maybe I
choose to ignore that,

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.765
and I say, hey, you
know what, I'm just

00:03:53.765 --> 00:03:55.770
going to click on
my player profile.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.630
We click on that.

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:58.110
We get into another screen.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.032
The sign-in button
is still there.

00:04:00.032 --> 00:04:01.490
But maybe I say,
you know what, I'm

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.430
going to go and click on
this achievements button,

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.870
and see what my
achievements are.

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.140
Well at this point, a dialog
box pops up that says,

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.260
hey, would you like to
sign in to Play Games,

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.310
because we use that to
track your achievements.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.900
I say, OK, yeah
that sounds good.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.850
An OAuth2 dialogue permission
screen pops up that I look at.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.757
And I say, oh OK,
this makes sense.

00:04:20.757 --> 00:04:22.340
I understand why the
game is asking me

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:23.050
for these permissions.

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.770
It just said, hey, do
you want to sign in

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.600
to track your achievements?

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.110
And so I say, this looks good.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.620
I hit sign in.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.560
I get back into the application.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.610
I now see that it has
been personalized.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:37.400
Over on the upper right there,
you can see my name-- or,

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.580
most of my name.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.530
And the sign in button has now
turned into a sign out button.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.800
All in all, this has
been a generally kind

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.220
of friendly flow.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.040
I understood at every step of
the way what's been going on.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.160
You know, it's kind of
the warm fuzzy puppy

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.700
dog of sign-in flows.

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.060
So that's nice.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.837
Now, let's take a look at
a not-so-recommended flow.

00:04:59.837 --> 00:05:02.170
This-- I didn't want to call
out any particular partner,

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:06.160
so this is my lovely
made-up game of Eschaton.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.370
The game starts up, and
maybe it kind of loads.

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.330
And before I even
get into the game,

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:14.600
before I get into a main
menu or anything like that,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.940
I'm shown this
permissions dialogue.

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.200
And at this point,
I don't quite know--

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:20.500
why is it showing me this?

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.280
Why is it asking me to sign in?

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.120
I don't really understand.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.857
And this, it's a little scary.

00:05:26.857 --> 00:05:27.940
It's a little frightening.

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.490
And you know, I want my mommy.

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:33.640
So here's our quiz for you.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.420
Which sign-in flow do you think
did better-- the warm fuzzy

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:41.770
puppy dog flow, or the
scary, I want my mommy flow?

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.944
Go, raise your hand.

00:05:42.944 --> 00:05:45.360
I know this is on YouTube, and
maybe you're at the office.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.360
But you know, put your
hand up behind your head,

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.540
as if you were kind of
scratching or something.

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:54.240
Raise your hand if you
said warm puppy dog flow.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.490
That's a fair number of you.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.040
Raise your hand if
you think scary,

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:59.389
I want my mommy flow did better.

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:00.180
That's some of you.

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.560
Well, if you thought that the
warm puppy dog flow converted

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.760
better, you would be incorrect.

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:09.620
The scary, I want my
mommy flow actually

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:13.330
converted significantly better
than our officially recommended

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.070
flow.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:17.930
And this is a bit of a dilemma,
particularly for you guys

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:18.890
as game developers.

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:22.520
Right like, why be good, why
try and do the right thing,

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.360
when you get much
better conversion

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.840
by doing the thing
we don't recommend?

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.820
And this is kind of your
traditional prisoner's dilemma,

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.970
tragedy of the commons,
stuff you probably

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.440
learned about in Economics
101 kind of thing.

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.630
And so we looked at this.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.713
And the way we saw it,
there were sort of two ways

00:06:38.713 --> 00:06:40.220
we could resolve this situation.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.830
One would be simply enforcement.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:44.090
We could say, hey, you
know this sign-in flow goes

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.260
against our best practices,
and if you don't fix it,

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:48.060
we're going to ban
you from the store,

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.900
and send our robot
army after you,

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.020
and say bad things about
you behind your back.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.110
The thing is, this is
isn't really our style.

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:58.890
We don't like to use the
bandhammer if we don't have to.

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.870
And the robot army
is still in beta.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:04.910
That joke was a little
funnier, more outlandish,

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:07.350
before we went and bought
all those robot companies.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:08.190
Now, I don't know.

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.900
A little close to home.

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:13.160
Anyway, option number
two is hey, maybe,

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.040
we should take this
scary and jarring flow,

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:17.770
and just make it a little
less scary and jarring.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.190
So we're doing two things.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:23.060
First, we're changing our policy
to explicitly allow and even

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.550
encourage this type
of sign-in flow.

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.550
However, along with
that, rolling out

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.460
to Android devices
like, now-- by the time

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.284
you see this video-- we're
adding a nice little animation

00:07:34.284 --> 00:07:35.950
that's going to let
the user know what's

00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:38.520
about to happen, right
before they sign in.

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.950
So here's our example again.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.380
Here's our game of Eschaton.

00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:43.070
And the game starts up.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.770
And I see the loading bar.

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.584
And now this time, look at that.

00:07:47.584 --> 00:07:49.500
We got this nice little
animation saying, hey,

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.583
we're about to sign you
in to Play Games services.

00:07:51.583 --> 00:07:53.040
Right, this is nice.

00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:57.400
I have a lot more context now
as to why the game is giving me

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.470
this permissions dialogue.

00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:01.470
In fact, in some
ways, I actually

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:02.710
think this is a lot better.

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:04.543
With the sign in button,
you didn't actually

00:08:04.543 --> 00:08:06.650
know, necessarily, what
you were signing in for.

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:10.816
Right, like was it just
to share posts on Google+?

00:08:10.816 --> 00:08:13.820
Was it to remember who I am?

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:16.400
There was nothing about that
button that suggested oh, yeah,

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.800
this is for achievements
and leaderboards.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.350
So with this intro
animation, the user suddenly

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:24.831
has a lot more context, and
they understand now what

00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:27.330
they're being asked when they
get this permissions dialogue.

00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:29.770
So I think it's kind of
a win-win all around.

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:32.730
Your users understand what's
going on a lot better,

00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:35.100
and you as developers
hopefully get some better

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:36.620
sign-in conversion.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:39.574
So all in all, we think
this is a good change.

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:46.770
With that, let's move
on to achievements.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.130
So, the first point I want
to make about achievements

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.260
is achievements do matter.

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.720
I feel like at some point,
all of us as game developers,

00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:56.480
game designers-- we
all got really cynical

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.271
about achievements.

00:08:57.271 --> 00:08:59.620
You know, we're too
cool for them now.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.330
I don't entirely
know why this is.

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.710
My theory is maybe we got
tired of like, all these guys

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.930
in suits coming in and
saying things like, hey, I'm

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:09.710
going to add the
gamification to cooking,

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:13.280
and getting a ton of VC funding.

00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:15.420
Which actually is
not a bad idea.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:17.860
If any of you would like to
join my gamification cooking

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:21.090
start up, talk to
me after this video.

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:24.040
But, my point is that
achievements do matter.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:26.400
Maybe not to all
of your players,

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.161
but definitely to some of
them, most likely your hardcore

00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:29.660
players.

00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.310
Right?

00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:32.010
The players that
are actually going

00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:37.050
to be spending most of their
money in your application.

00:09:37.050 --> 00:09:40.740
And so my first recommendation
when it comes to achievements

00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:43.320
is, don't phone it in.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.040
I know as developers, you
can spend hundreds of hours

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:50.410
play testing and balancing
all of your game play.

00:09:50.410 --> 00:09:53.220
But then don't kind of whip
together the achievements

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:55.210
in the last four
minutes before you ship.

00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.022
Don't do that.

00:09:56.022 --> 00:09:57.480
Think about these
achievements when

00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.910
you're first
designing your game.

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.390
Think about what
achievements would be fun.

00:10:02.390 --> 00:10:04.790
So the number one trick
I have to designing

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:07.290
good mobile
achievements is simply

00:10:07.290 --> 00:10:09.020
design good achievements.

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.200
We sort of went out
onto the internet

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.220
and looked at some
of the advice that

00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:15.460
was out there about
good achievement design,

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.380
and we felt like 90% of
that advice still stands.

00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:21.240
If you haven't designed
achievements before,

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.000
if you're looking
for where to start,

00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.620
there's a really good article
on Gamasutra called "Achievement

00:10:27.620 --> 00:10:29.850
Design 101" by Greg McClanahan.

00:10:29.850 --> 00:10:33.060
I believe he was the community
manager on Kongregate

00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.880
for quite a number of years.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:36.780
He designed a lot of
their achievements

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.650
in the first few years
of their service.

00:10:38.650 --> 00:10:40.100
He wrote this very good article.

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:41.660
I encourage you to check it out.

00:10:41.660 --> 00:10:43.740
I'm not going to repeat
all that advice here,

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.250
because that would be redundant.

00:10:45.250 --> 00:10:49.330
But here's one example
that I really like.

00:10:49.330 --> 00:10:52.620
Let's say that there's this
amazing, once in a blue moon

00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.270
moment that happens in
your game that's awesome.

00:10:56.270 --> 00:10:58.240
Somehow, your play
tester manages

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.490
to make this amazing, crazy
thing happen in your game,

00:11:00.490 --> 00:11:02.970
and you're like, oh my god,
I've never seen that before.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:05.620
We have to reward
our players if they

00:11:05.620 --> 00:11:07.660
can pull off that same maneuver.

00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:09.910
And so you add this achievement.

00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:11.760
You say, hey here's
this achievement--

00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.170
pull off this crazy, once
in a lifetime maneuver.

00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:17.270
And for your players who, as
they're playing their game,

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:19.690
happen to pull off this
crazy, once in a blue moon

00:11:19.690 --> 00:11:23.700
kind of maneuver, it is kind of
nice to get an achievement that

00:11:23.700 --> 00:11:26.310
recognizes hey, that thing
you did was really awesome,

00:11:26.310 --> 00:11:28.680
and we'd like to
reward you for it.

00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:31.672
However, the problem is
the rest of your players--

00:11:31.672 --> 00:11:33.255
there's going to be
a lot of them that

00:11:33.255 --> 00:11:36.910
are going to try and earn all of
your achievements in your game.

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:39.170
And so what's going
to happen is they

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:43.610
are going to play this level,
try and pull off this once

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.700
in a lifetime maneuver, fail,
quit, restart your level.

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:48.550
Try again.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.100
Try and pull off
this crazy maneuver.

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:50.600
Fail.

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.099
Quit.

00:11:51.099 --> 00:11:54.120
Restart, and restart,
and restart, and restart,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:58.630
until after a few hundred
repeats of gameplay,

00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.270
they can finally pull off this
crazy, once in a blue moon

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.912
type of maneuver.

00:12:02.912 --> 00:12:04.370
And when that
happens, the reaction

00:12:04.370 --> 00:12:06.460
is not going to be, oh
my god, that was awesome.

00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:08.260
The reaction is
going to be, I'm so

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.930
glad to be done with
this stupid thing.

00:12:10.930 --> 00:12:13.000
And, by the way, I
hate you, your game,

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.080
and everything your
game stands for.

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.620
What I do recommend,
by the way, is

00:12:17.620 --> 00:12:19.500
if your game does
have moments like this

00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:23.220
that you want to show off,
consider capturing replay

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.870
and uploading it to
someplace like YouTube.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.850
I mean gameplay is the
second most popular category

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:32.490
on YouTube after music.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.370
People love watching
other people play games.

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.144
And if you're able
to-- it's not trivial.

00:12:39.144 --> 00:12:40.560
But if you're able
to kind of keep

00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:44.290
a running total, or a running
record of your game's logic

00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:47.830
over the last few minutes,
be able to rewind,

00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:51.520
record that out to a buffer,
upload that video then

00:12:51.520 --> 00:12:55.920
onto YouTube, and allow players
to share it, all of a sudden,

00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.720
there's an opportunity
now for your game

00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:01.870
to be exposed to thousands,
or tens of thousands,

00:13:01.870 --> 00:13:04.620
or hundreds of thousands
of people who might not

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.490
have otherwise seen
or noticed your game.

00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:10.820
So if you do want to reward a
player for this kind of moment,

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:14.170
look into being able to share
replays on a video sharing

00:13:14.170 --> 00:13:16.485
site, instead of looking
at an achievement.

00:13:18.967 --> 00:13:20.550
A good mobile
achievement should serve

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.800
as a guideline for your
players so that there is still

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.440
more for them to do.

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.230
I think this holds particularly
true in mobile games,

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:31.940
because in general,
a console game still

00:13:31.940 --> 00:13:33.760
tends to have more
of the stronger,

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.050
single player
narrative experiences.

00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:39.810
No one is playing BioShock
and they get to this moment

00:13:39.810 --> 00:13:43.360
here where Elizabeth clocks them
with the book and says, well,

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.240
I guess I'm done.

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:47.090
Put down the controller, let
me find something else to play.

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.930
This doesn't happen, because
there's very clearly something

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.170
in the narrative that is
dragging the player forward,

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.753
that is letting them know, no,
there's definitely more for you

00:13:55.753 --> 00:13:57.260
to do here in this game.

00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.920
By contrast, let's
look at a game

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.740
like Plague Inc. By the time
I'm done playing this game,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:06.280
and maybe I've infected
the world, am I done?

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.170
Is there more for me
to do in this game?

00:14:08.170 --> 00:14:10.380
Maybe I can play on a
harder difficulty level.

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.050
But maybe I also think
that I've seen everything

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:16.070
there is to see in this
game, and I uninstall it.

00:14:16.070 --> 00:14:19.830
I think this is an example
where Plauge Inc. In particular

00:14:19.830 --> 00:14:21.880
did a really good job
with their achievements.

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:24.020
If you look at their
list of achievements,

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:26.880
you can see that there's a
lot of depth to this game

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:29.880
that a player who's only playing
it the first or second time

00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:31.127
around might not realize.

00:14:31.127 --> 00:14:33.210
You look at some of the
achievements on this list,

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:36.210
and it's like, you can cause
World War III to break out.

00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.170
Or you can infect astronauts
before they go to the moon,

00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:41.030
and all of a sudden,
you can infect space.

00:14:41.030 --> 00:14:45.170
Or you can cause a zombie
outbreak to happen.

00:14:45.170 --> 00:14:47.470
This is all stuff
that I as a player

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:51.967
might not realize if I were to
just casually play this game.

00:14:51.967 --> 00:14:53.550
Now all of a sudden,
I see this stuff,

00:14:53.550 --> 00:14:59.370
I'm compelled to try and pull
off more of these goals here.

00:14:59.370 --> 00:15:04.670
And I suddenly discover
there's a much deeper aspect

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:07.050
to this game than I might
have otherwise realized.

00:15:07.050 --> 00:15:10.900
So if your game has
these kind of elements,

00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:12.320
if your game has
a layer of depth

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.445
that you want to make sure
your players know about,

00:15:14.445 --> 00:15:17.859
use an achievement to
kind of guide them there.

00:15:17.859 --> 00:15:19.400
When it comes to
mobile achievements,

00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:21.230
do remember that you're
on a mobile device,

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:23.710
and users can be
interrupted at any moment.

00:15:23.710 --> 00:15:26.480
Watch out for achievements
that require your user

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:29.330
to do something in one
sitting, or watch out for,

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:32.040
hey, do this thing
in under 60 seconds.

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:34.310
At the very least,
make sure that you're

00:15:34.310 --> 00:15:36.361
pausing your achievement
timer if your game has

00:15:36.361 --> 00:15:38.360
to go into the background,
or your user suddenly

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.760
receives a phone call.

00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:42.360
This is not a major
issue I've seen

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.920
with most mobile developers.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.600
They kind of understand the
context of mobile games.

00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:50.630
But if you are porting your
game over from another platform,

00:15:50.630 --> 00:15:54.480
if you're porting it
over from console, look

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:56.500
at your achievements,
make sure they still

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.390
stand up in this
kind of environment.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:02.810
And don't forget that
your game is expanding.

00:16:02.810 --> 00:16:04.310
Don't forget to add
new achievements

00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:06.630
when you add new content.

00:16:06.630 --> 00:16:09.430
Maybe seems obvious, but I've
seen some developers miss this.

00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:11.330
You've got three
worlds in your game,

00:16:11.330 --> 00:16:12.690
and you're game goes out there.

00:16:12.690 --> 00:16:14.070
And it turns out
it's a massive hit.

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:16.278
And you're like, whoa, we've
got to keep adding stuff

00:16:16.278 --> 00:16:18.380
to this game so that
players keep playing it,

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:20.250
and keep talking
about it, and keep

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:22.200
buying in-game items,
and all of that.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:25.050
And so you go ahead and you
add more levels to your game.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.850
Well remember,
achievements serve

00:16:26.850 --> 00:16:29.080
as a guidepost to your
player that there's still

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.240
more for them to do.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.590
And so add in some
achievements to accompany

00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:33.655
this extra content.

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.690
And finally, watch out for
what I call the achievement

00:16:38.690 --> 00:16:39.570
avalanche.

00:16:39.570 --> 00:16:42.166
I have seen a lot
of games do this.

00:16:42.166 --> 00:16:44.290
Let's say we've got ourselves
a little puzzle game.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.210
And we decide all
right, well, we'll

00:16:47.210 --> 00:16:49.460
add some achievements
for completing

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:51.260
various levels along the way.

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:54.130
This is fine, totally
standard, it works.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:55.647
And then we say,
we should also add

00:16:55.647 --> 00:16:57.480
some kind of challenge
type of achievements.

00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:00.650
You know, like can
you finish a game,

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:02.660
or finish a level in
under three minutes?

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:04.619
And can you finish a
level without dying,

00:17:04.619 --> 00:17:07.230
or without using an undo?

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:08.880
This seems all like
a really good idea.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:12.060
Seems like we've sort of
got a nice mix of progress

00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:14.560
achievements and
challenge-type achievements.

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.500
But who can see
the problem here?

00:17:16.500 --> 00:17:17.869
Raise your hand.

00:17:17.869 --> 00:17:18.990
OK, a couple of you.

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:21.290
I see you out there
in YouTube land.

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.250
Here's the issue.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:25.390
I play the game, and
I complete level one,

00:17:25.390 --> 00:17:27.210
and I get an achievement for if.

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.910
The kicker is, level
one was probably

00:17:29.910 --> 00:17:31.940
the easiest level
in the entire game.

00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:33.400
And so there's a
very good chance

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.660
that not only have I
completed level one,

00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:38.470
but I have now completed a level
without dying, without using

00:17:38.470 --> 00:17:40.170
any undos, in under
three minutes,

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.200
and I've gotten a
three star score.

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:46.390
And blammo, sort of before I've
gotten the chance, as a player,

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.280
to get invested at
all in your game,

00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:51.100
all the interesting
achievements are gone.

00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:52.850
These are all used up.

00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:54.874
And maybe it's kind of
nice having that moment

00:17:54.874 --> 00:17:57.040
after the first level where
I get five achievements,

00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.930
but I'm not invested enough in
your game yet, at this point,

00:17:59.930 --> 00:18:01.560
to care.

00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:05.420
And then there's not
much left to keep

00:18:05.420 --> 00:18:06.810
me interested after that.

00:18:06.810 --> 00:18:09.349
So watch out for these
types of achievements.

00:18:09.349 --> 00:18:11.640
If it seems like there's a
good chance you'll give away

00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.922
half your achievements
in the first level,

00:18:13.922 --> 00:18:16.380
find other ways to reward those
same types of achievements.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.940
So with that, let's
get into leaderboards.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.400
And here the best piece
of advice I can give you

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.440
is keep your leaderboards clean.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.250
Leaderboards can
be a fantastic way

00:18:30.250 --> 00:18:32.360
to build community
around your game.

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:34.750
People start to compete.

00:18:34.750 --> 00:18:38.000
They decide to check out
the weekly leaderboard

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.090
and see how they're doing.

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:41.810
And they come back and
make sure they're still

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.590
somewhere in the top of
their weekly leaderboard,

00:18:44.590 --> 00:18:47.200
or their social leaderboard
among their friends.

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:49.310
If you have a good
leaderboard system going,

00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:54.480
it can be inexpensive and really
easy retention for your game.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.090
So imagine how
disheartening it can

00:18:56.090 --> 00:18:59.580
be for one of your top players
if they get a score that they

00:18:59.580 --> 00:19:03.110
think has got to make the
top five all time scores,

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:04.540
they check out
their leaderboard,

00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:06.760
and they see this-- oh,
look, the top layer here

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.360
has [INAUDIBLE].

00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:11.380
Well, that can be
really disheartening.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:15.350
And this happens enough
times, players sort of

00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:17.480
get disillusioned,
and they no longer

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.080
care about your leaderboards.

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:22.320
And the fact of matter
is, at the end of the day,

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.880
leaderboard board data
generated by your game client

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:27.290
is never going to be
completely trustworthy.

00:19:27.290 --> 00:19:30.780
But there are things you can
do to help mitigate this.

00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:35.350
First, kind of a quick and
easy solution-- set limits.

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.860
Not all games have a
theoretical maximum.

00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:40.185
But if you do, add those
into the leaderboards.

00:19:40.185 --> 00:19:41.560
Make sure the
leaderboard rejects

00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.490
any score that is
theoretically impossible.

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:48.070
At the very least, it just
kind of makes them look better.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.350
This can help, but
obviously not all games

00:19:50.350 --> 00:19:51.720
have theoretical limits.

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:53.204
Maybe yours doesn't.

00:19:53.204 --> 00:19:55.370
So the other option I would
encourage you to look at

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:57.040
is players.hide.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.980
This is a REST call, this is
one of our management calls,

00:19:59.980 --> 00:20:03.392
that hides any player from
the public leaderboard.

00:20:03.392 --> 00:20:05.850
This can also be kind of sneaky
in that it hides the player

00:20:05.850 --> 00:20:08.240
from everybody but
him or herself.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:10.060
So the cheating player
doesn't actually

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:12.210
know that they've been
hidden unless they

00:20:12.210 --> 00:20:14.920
were to find a friend
playing the same game

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:18.370
and ask their friend to go
and check the high score list

00:20:18.370 --> 00:20:19.120
and look for them.

00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:21.119
And then they find out
that they've been hidden.

00:20:21.119 --> 00:20:24.950
And maybe if they're a cheater,
they don't have any friends.

00:20:24.950 --> 00:20:27.440
So I would encourage you
to look at players.hide

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.750
to hide any players that
very obviously don't

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:32.720
have legitimate scores.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.300
The REST call is out there.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:35.380
It's well documented.

00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:38.760
The actual documentation is
not in perspective like this.

00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:40.880
It's just normal, readable.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:42.290
We also have a
sample application

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.780
that you can download
that will make it easier

00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:46.570
for you to make these calls.

00:20:46.570 --> 00:20:48.940
It's called, I believe,
management tools.

00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.910
And it's available
from our github page.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:52.600
So drop on by your github page.

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:54.400
Check it out.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:58.100
And then finally, we just
recently added score tags.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:02.730
And this is a string of up
to 64 URI-safe characters

00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.120
that you can submit
along with your score

00:21:05.120 --> 00:21:06.860
when they get sent
to our servers.

00:21:06.860 --> 00:21:09.150
And this could be used in
a number of different ways.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:11.800
Some of it might just be
for analytics information.

00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:13.940
You're curious what
level a player was

00:21:13.940 --> 00:21:16.430
on when they submitted
this amazing score.

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:19.140
But you can also use it for
things like adding a hash.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:23.530
You can kind of make some
hash of the user's score

00:21:23.530 --> 00:21:25.980
as sort of a way to verify
that their score actually

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.120
seems somewhat legitimate.

00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:32.360
Or, if your game server happens
to be the ultimate recorder

00:21:32.360 --> 00:21:35.700
of truth, add a link to
the entry on your server

00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:37.880
that confirms that
yes, this score

00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:39.750
that this player
submitted is legitimate.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:42.380
It's what the
server thinks it is.

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:44.720
And you can kind of
start to combine this

00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:49.620
with the players.hide call that
we had in the previous slide

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.640
to make your own custom
anti-cheating script.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.992
So you can make a script that
makes this scores.list call,

00:21:55.992 --> 00:21:57.450
gets a whole bunch
of these scores,

00:21:57.450 --> 00:21:59.640
and starts analyzing them--
going through each one

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.240
and saying, all right, looking
at this score and score

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:04.785
tag that's with it, does
this seem legitimate?

00:22:04.785 --> 00:22:07.840
And if it doesn't,
call players.hide.

00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:12.060
Hide that player, go back, and
go through your next score.

00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.590
And if you start running
this kind of script

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.370
on a regular basis,
you can start

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.220
to get really efficient with
your leaderboard cleaning.

00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:23.030
You can get your con ops person,
your customer support person,

00:22:23.030 --> 00:22:24.910
to run this once or twice a day.

00:22:24.910 --> 00:22:28.100
And suddenly you have
some leaderboards

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:31.890
that once again look legitimate
and can kind of bring

00:22:31.890 --> 00:22:34.230
on that type of
retention you get

00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:37.630
with a good leaderboard system.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:41.684
And so with this, we're going
to move on to multi-player.

00:22:41.684 --> 00:22:43.350
And I should probably
make it clear here

00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:44.850
that what we're
really talking about

00:22:44.850 --> 00:22:47.830
right now is real
time multi-player.

00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:51.690
Turn-based multi-player has
just been announced and launched

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:53.310
within a day or
two of this video.

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:57.140
We don't have enough information
yet to give you best practices.

00:22:57.140 --> 00:22:59.440
But when it comes to
real time multi-player,

00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:03.700
the biggest thing we learned
is matchmaking is really hard.

00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:05.997
So be glad you
don't have to do it.

00:23:05.997 --> 00:23:07.080
Here's what we discovered.

00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.600
So in a traditional
client server set up,

00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:11.570
you've got your
desktop computer,

00:23:11.570 --> 00:23:14.670
and it's going out, and
pinging a list of known servers

00:23:14.670 --> 00:23:15.820
out there in the world.

00:23:15.820 --> 00:23:18.260
And finds the one that seems
have the best ping time,

00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:21.510
and suggests, hey, maybe this
is the server you want to join.

00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:24.180
And that works fine in
a client-server set up.

00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:28.070
However, with real time
games using Games services,

00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:30.320
we're using a
peer-to-peer network.

00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:34.130
And you can't ping every
other phone in the world.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:36.420
Partly because there
is a lot of them.

00:23:36.420 --> 00:23:39.110
And partly because they're just
not really set up that way.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:41.630
The only way to really
know about another client

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.554
is to connect with them.

00:23:43.554 --> 00:23:45.220
And at that point,
it's kind of too late

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:46.950
if it turns out it's
a bad connection.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.000
And maybe you didn't want
to connect with them.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.670
You kind of have to write
it out at that point.

00:23:52.670 --> 00:23:54.780
However, we can start to learn.

00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:56.750
So for instance,
we might discover

00:23:56.750 --> 00:23:59.430
that a number of devices--
maybe it seems like they're

00:23:59.430 --> 00:24:01.780
in the same general
area, geographically,

00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:05.517
and therefore are likely to
connect well with each other.

00:24:05.517 --> 00:24:07.350
We can get more
sophisticated than that too.

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:09.770
Like we might learn about
different connections

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:12.840
among different devices
in different locations.

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:15.550
And by the way,
all this example--

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.300
completely hypothetical.

00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:20.100
But let's say we learned that
devices in, say, the Seattle

00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:23.860
area and devices in Boise, Idaho
have a really good connection.

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.440
Not sure why, they just do.

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.720
And maybe we also
learned that-- again, all

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.077
hypothetical-- maybe connections
between Seattle and Portland,

00:24:32.077 --> 00:24:33.910
they're all getting
routed through Baltimore

00:24:33.910 --> 00:24:35.120
for some reason.

00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:37.110
And so they're not as good.

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:38.600
And so maybe we'll
start to avoid

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.980
trying to connect these
two devices if we can.

00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:45.750
And we can start taking this
vast amount of information

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:49.620
that we're getting, and use that
to more intelligently match up

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:50.550
players.

00:24:50.550 --> 00:24:52.270
So we've got this
situation where

00:24:52.270 --> 00:24:54.380
a player is looking for
opponents to play with.

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.720
We start off a little picky.

00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:58.649
A player pops up that we
know isn't a good connection,

00:24:58.649 --> 00:25:00.440
we might say, hey, you
know what, let's not

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.648
connect with them right away.

00:25:01.648 --> 00:25:03.740
Let's see if there's maybe
some other players that

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.030
would be better for us
to play a game with.

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:09.690
So some time goes on, and we
find a player that we think,

00:25:09.690 --> 00:25:12.940
yeah, will connect
well with them.

00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:14.290
Maybe another opponent pops up.

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.900
We say, yeah, they would
be a good opponent.

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.230
It's only after
some time goes on,

00:25:19.230 --> 00:25:21.800
and we haven't found
anybody else better,

00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.470
then we will kind of
lower our standards

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.530
and pick a player with a
not as good connection.

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:31.230
And you might be
asking yourself,

00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:32.500
why are we doing this?

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.160
Why don't we just wait for
somebody better to come along?

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:37.440
Why even make this connection
in the first place?

00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.750
Well, here's the big
metric-- 12 seconds.

00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.760
This is the amount
of time at which

00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.030
players will start
to abandon your game.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.230
They'll start to get
impatient and say, eh, I

00:25:47.230 --> 00:25:49.620
didn't want to play
this game after all.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.410
So we want to do
our best to match up

00:25:51.410 --> 00:25:54.610
the majority of our players
before we hit that point, based

00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:59.300
on the idea that any game is
better than an abandoned game.

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:02.560
And so the first piece
of advice I can give you

00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.930
is that if you want a really
successful multi-player game,

00:26:05.930 --> 00:26:10.050
you'd start by having a very
successful multi-player game.

00:26:10.050 --> 00:26:12.850
You want a game with millions
of people all playing it,

00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:15.160
at all times, the idea being
that if there are millions

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:17.600
of users out there,
all looking to play,

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:19.200
we have a very rich
pool from which

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.750
we can pull really good
multi-player candidates.

00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:24.677
Which, I know is not
very actionable advice.

00:26:24.677 --> 00:26:26.260
You're probably
already trying to make

00:26:26.260 --> 00:26:28.540
a successful multi-player game.

00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:31.370
So let's look at maybe a more
practical recommendation, which

00:26:31.370 --> 00:26:33.820
is keep variants to a minimum.

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:37.010
We have this feature
that is very powerful.

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:40.070
We let you select what
type of multi-player game

00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:44.970
you want to join before
you even start connecting.

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:48.030
So for instance, you
might decide, hey,

00:26:48.030 --> 00:26:50.730
I'm going to add a variant where
people can decide before they

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:53.840
play, do I want to play a
game of capture the flag,

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.410
or do I want to play a game of
team death match or conquest?

00:26:58.410 --> 00:27:00.757
And players will
only get matched up

00:27:00.757 --> 00:27:03.090
with other players looking
to play the same type of game

00:27:03.090 --> 00:27:04.740
as them.

00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:06.530
Again, powerful feature, right?

00:27:06.530 --> 00:27:08.810
But there's a downside to it.

00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.134
Let's say we have this
full complement of users.

00:27:11.134 --> 00:27:13.550
And you say, OK, well you know
I'm going to add a variant.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:16.300
I want to let players
decide whether they're

00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.360
going to play death match
or capture the flag.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:21.640
Well, just by doing
that, you've divided

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.150
this pool of potential
players in half.

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:26.880
And then you say to
yourself, oh, well, I also

00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:29.200
want to have a variant for
whether friendly fire is

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.540
turned on or off.

00:27:30.540 --> 00:27:32.990
And we should
probably let players

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:35.550
decide if they want to play a
three, five, or seven minute

00:27:35.550 --> 00:27:36.245
game.

00:27:36.245 --> 00:27:36.740
Oh, and you know what?

00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:38.530
Of course we want a
newbies-only room,

00:27:38.530 --> 00:27:40.940
so that beginning players
don't feel overwhelmed

00:27:40.940 --> 00:27:42.640
when they first start the game.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:44.890
Well, now, all of
a sudden, we've

00:27:44.890 --> 00:27:47.330
got nobody around
that wants to play

00:27:47.330 --> 00:27:50.500
the same newbies-only, seven
minute, friendly fire on,

00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.290
capture the flag game as
our initial player, who's

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:55.610
looking for opponents.

00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:58.350
And maybe we don't find
anybody for them to match with,

00:27:58.350 --> 00:28:00.150
and they end up
abandoning the game.

00:28:00.150 --> 00:28:03.320
And that's sad for all of us.

00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.690
So how do we fix this?

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.420
My recommendation
would be that if you

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:08.910
think all of these
options that you

00:28:08.910 --> 00:28:11.850
have variants for-- if you
think they're all nice,

00:28:11.850 --> 00:28:15.570
but not deal breakers, like if
you think players wouldn't mind

00:28:15.570 --> 00:28:19.610
playing a friendly fire game
even if they prefer it off--

00:28:19.610 --> 00:28:21.750
then create auto-matching
with no variants,

00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:23.940
or as few variants as possible.

00:28:23.940 --> 00:28:28.110
That will bring up as
many potential candidates

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:31.270
for us to match up
your players with.

00:28:31.270 --> 00:28:32.830
Then, once your
players have joined

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.871
and we find people that
seem to have good network

00:28:34.871 --> 00:28:37.410
connections for each
other, then bring up

00:28:37.410 --> 00:28:40.340
a UI that lets players
vote on what type of game

00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:42.140
they want to play.

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.990
Not everyone's going to
get what they voted for.

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:46.850
A majority is
going to rule here.

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:50.080
But if you think these options
are all sort of nice-to-haves

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:52.970
and not deal
breakers, leave them

00:28:52.970 --> 00:28:57.840
as something players can vote on
after they've been matched up.

00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:01.480
So let's move on to another
aspect of multi-player games,

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.780
and that's invitations.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:03.920
So we have this system.

00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:07.170
We have a bunch of built-in
UI that allows your player

00:29:07.170 --> 00:29:10.610
to invite specific
friends to play with them.

00:29:10.610 --> 00:29:12.490
But here's one thing
we discovered--

00:29:12.490 --> 00:29:14.350
and again, real
time multi-player

00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:17.060
only-- the vast
majority of people

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.330
don't send out
invitations to friends

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:22.310
unless they're all in
the same room already.

00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:26.060
Or, I guess in this case, the
same park where they are all

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:30.110
dressed formally, because it's
one of those formal parks.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:33.880
And the reason is, when you send
off the invitation to a friend,

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.426
you don't know what
their situation.

00:29:36.426 --> 00:29:38.300
I mean, are they sitting
at home watching TV,

00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.920
and happy to be interrupted?

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:42.330
Are they sitting at
the movies and don't

00:29:42.330 --> 00:29:44.760
want to get your game invite?

00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:47.240
Are they playing a game on
their phone already and happy

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:48.780
to receive other invitations?

00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:50.280
Are they taking a
serious phone call

00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:52.490
and don't want to
get interrupted?

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:56.360
Your inviting
player doesn't know.

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:57.650
You don't know as a developer.

00:29:57.650 --> 00:29:59.070
And frankly, neither do we.

00:29:59.070 --> 00:30:01.940
From a technical perspective,
I have my phone in my pocket

00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.570
and I'm bored versus I
have my phone in my pocket

00:30:04.570 --> 00:30:06.300
and I don't want to
be interrupted looks

00:30:06.300 --> 00:30:08.120
very much the same.

00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:12.580
And remember, you only have 12
seconds for this other person

00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:15.245
to take the phone out of
their pocket see the invite,

00:30:15.245 --> 00:30:17.620
make a decision as to whether
they want to join this game

00:30:17.620 --> 00:30:21.540
or not before your original
player gets impatient.

00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:23.890
And so what we've discovered
is the vast majority

00:30:23.890 --> 00:30:27.420
of your games, like 95% of your
games, are using auto-match.

00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.536
This is the flow
where basically I say,

00:30:30.536 --> 00:30:32.160
I don't care who I
get matched up with.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:34.790
Just match me up with an
opponent as soon as possible.

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:37.740
And so you should do your best
to encourage this type of flow

00:30:37.740 --> 00:30:41.060
in a real-time
multi-player game.

00:30:41.060 --> 00:30:44.060
And so that means you start by
adding a quick match button.

00:30:44.060 --> 00:30:46.670
This should be a button
that's sort of one click, zero

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:50.390
dialogues to get into
a multi-player game.

00:30:50.390 --> 00:30:52.340
And while you're at
it, make this button

00:30:52.340 --> 00:30:53.880
the obvious default.

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:55.780
Have the invite
friends button there,

00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.171
some people if they are
gathered in the same room

00:30:58.171 --> 00:31:00.420
as their friends will want
to play a multi-player game

00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:01.060
with them.

00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:05.220
But make the quick match
the easy to find default.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.720
This would be the
code for doing it.

00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.700
I'm not going to go over this
too much, because this is all

00:31:09.700 --> 00:31:12.410
available in our
sample documentation,

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:13.365
so check that out.

00:31:16.479 --> 00:31:18.770
And so with that, let's move
into our lightning round--

00:31:18.770 --> 00:31:20.860
a few other little
best practices

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:23.470
that I wanted to talk about.

00:31:23.470 --> 00:31:26.370
First, use diverse icons
for your achievements

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:28.296
in leaderboards.

00:31:28.296 --> 00:31:29.920
So let's go back to
our Play Games app.

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.060
Remember I said it had 10
to 50 million installs?

00:31:33.060 --> 00:31:35.700
I want to point out, these
are voluntary installs.

00:31:35.700 --> 00:31:38.990
These are people-- this doesn't
count the app being preloaded

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:42.360
on devices, which it
also is for some devices.

00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.770
This is people that have
gone to the Play store,

00:31:45.770 --> 00:31:47.690
found the Play Games
app, and said, yes, I

00:31:47.690 --> 00:31:49.770
want to download this thing.

00:31:49.770 --> 00:31:52.350
So you've got some
hard core game

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.400
players that are using
the Play Games app.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:57.660
And you're going to start to
get a not insignificant number

00:31:57.660 --> 00:32:01.860
of installs that come
from this application.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.890
So you want to make sure
that your app is well

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.690
represented in here.

00:32:06.690 --> 00:32:09.350
And there are three
things when people say,

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:12.490
I want to see what games
my friends are playing.

00:32:12.490 --> 00:32:15.050
I want to see what games are
recommended in the Play Games

00:32:15.050 --> 00:32:15.550
app.

00:32:15.550 --> 00:32:17.700
They're going to bring up
this entry about your game.

00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.616
And there's three things
they're going to see.

00:32:19.616 --> 00:32:22.420
First is going to be
your game's description.

00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:26.870
Next is going to be a list
of achievements in your game.

00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:30.130
And the third is going to be
your list of leaderboards.

00:32:30.130 --> 00:32:32.100
And what we
recommend here is you

00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.530
want to use some really
nice diverse icons here

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:38.870
so that your game displays
well in this type of situation.

00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:41.830
So if we take a look
at Triple Town here,

00:32:41.830 --> 00:32:44.400
they've got they got a
pretty good set of icons.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:45.890
They're different.

00:32:45.890 --> 00:32:46.920
They're kind of cute.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.510
They're fun.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:50.250
They're within the
style of the game.

00:32:50.250 --> 00:32:51.127
They look fun.

00:32:51.127 --> 00:32:52.710
They might make me
say, hey, this game

00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:53.668
kind of looks like fun.

00:32:53.668 --> 00:32:55.920
Maybe I will check it out.

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:57.230
Don't be this guy.

00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:59.670
Sorry Nostalgic Racer,
I'm going to pick on you.

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.430
Notice how all the
achievement icons

00:33:01.430 --> 00:33:03.920
are just the same version
of their game icon, that's

00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:06.180
repeated right there
on the upper left.

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:09.290
This looks a lot less
interesting, I think,

00:33:09.290 --> 00:33:11.270
to a potential player.

00:33:11.270 --> 00:33:14.450
Just visually, it doesn't
have that same kind of oomph.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:16.760
And for crying
out loud, don't do

00:33:16.760 --> 00:33:20.210
what this developer
did, and just put

00:33:20.210 --> 00:33:22.954
a bunch of secret achievements.

00:33:22.954 --> 00:33:24.620
No one looks at that
and says, oh man, I

00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:26.930
can't wait to try out this
game with a few achievements

00:33:26.930 --> 00:33:29.807
that I don't know what they are.

00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:31.390
Secret achievements
really should only

00:33:31.390 --> 00:33:33.895
be used if you've got
spoilers in your game

00:33:33.895 --> 00:33:37.080
and you don't want players
to find out about them.

00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:41.730
Otherwise, this does
nothing to draw a player in.

00:33:41.730 --> 00:33:45.970
So remember, this is kind of
your game's representation

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:47.820
in the Play Games app.

00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:51.340
You've probably spent 40
iterations tweaking your game's

00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.320
icon to make sure it looks
good in the Play store.

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.920
Don't then kind of ignore
your game's representation

00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.390
in the Play Games app.

00:33:59.390 --> 00:34:01.990
And by the way, all this advice
goes double for leaderboards,

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:04.810
because leaderboards are
always going to show up.

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:07.120
One, they're always going
to show up in color,

00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:10.059
because unlike achievements,
leaderboards are always earned.

00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:12.860
And I think developers
often overlook this,

00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:15.750
because they forget that
leaderboard icons can also

00:34:15.750 --> 00:34:19.550
be displayed to the user.

00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:23.409
Check your alerts in the Google
Play Developer console, also

00:34:23.409 --> 00:34:27.060
known as mistakes your
game is probably making.

00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:29.630
There are few situations
where your game is probably

00:34:29.630 --> 00:34:33.929
running into trouble, and you
as a developer won't realize it.

00:34:33.929 --> 00:34:36.310
One of the most
common ones is if you

00:34:36.310 --> 00:34:41.179
were to add a new achievement or
a new leaderboard to your game,

00:34:41.179 --> 00:34:45.389
and you forget to
publish that leaderboard

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:47.090
within the developer console.

00:34:47.090 --> 00:34:50.370
You get a warning
that looks like this.

00:34:50.370 --> 00:34:54.020
And admittedly, this is a
very weird, tricky scenario.

00:34:54.020 --> 00:34:56.590
The idea is, let's say
you add a new high score

00:34:56.590 --> 00:34:57.570
list to your game.

00:34:57.570 --> 00:34:59.240
There's two things
you need to publish.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.740
First, you need to
publish your client that

00:35:01.740 --> 00:35:04.210
attempts to submit scores
to this new leaderboard.

00:35:04.210 --> 00:35:07.800
But you also need to publish
the leaderboard itself,

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.995
within the game service.

00:35:08.995 --> 00:35:11.120
And that's what you would
do through the Play Games

00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.390
developer console.

00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:15.260
And so what will
happen is, if you only

00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:18.174
remember to publish the client,
a bunch of your players,

00:35:18.174 --> 00:35:19.340
they'll get this new client.

00:35:19.340 --> 00:35:22.080
It will attempt to submit
the player's high score

00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:23.230
to this leaderboard.

00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:26.320
And the Play Games service
will say, wait a minute,

00:35:26.320 --> 00:35:27.610
I don't know this leaderboard.

00:35:27.610 --> 00:35:30.510
This is a leader board
that hasn't been published.

00:35:30.510 --> 00:35:31.930
I'm going to reject this call.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:35.130
And your players' scores
will get discarded.

00:35:35.130 --> 00:35:37.890
And what even makes
this trickier is

00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.880
that you as a developer
probably don't

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:45.310
see this error, because with
any developer or test accounts,

00:35:45.310 --> 00:35:47.570
those can submit
scores to leaderboards

00:35:47.570 --> 00:35:48.920
that are not published.

00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:51.920
So your players will
complain, hey, you know,

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:53.700
I can't seem to earn
this achievement,

00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.404
or I can't seem to
get this leaderboard.

00:35:55.404 --> 00:35:57.570
You're going to try it out,
and you're going to say,

00:35:57.570 --> 00:35:58.361
I don't understand.

00:35:58.361 --> 00:35:59.582
It works fine for me.

00:35:59.582 --> 00:36:01.290
Yes, this is the little
publishing screen

00:36:01.290 --> 00:36:04.069
that you have to remember
to visit as well.

00:36:04.069 --> 00:36:05.860
And so really, one of
the best ways for you

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.440
to find out about these
types of situations

00:36:08.440 --> 00:36:11.400
is to look for any alerts
that you might get.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.400
Get in the habit of
visiting your developer

00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.770
console on a weekly
basis, and just

00:36:15.770 --> 00:36:19.830
make sure there's no alerts
that are popping up there.

00:36:19.830 --> 00:36:24.020
Another best practice-- I
implore you to use Cloud Save.

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:26.260
I think Cloud Save was
probably better received

00:36:26.260 --> 00:36:30.510
than what some of the folks
on the team had anticipated.

00:36:30.510 --> 00:36:34.450
And if you think about
it, it's really basic

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:36.750
compared to a lot of
the other cloud services

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:38.350
that we provide at Google.

00:36:38.350 --> 00:36:40.650
All it is it's
just a system that

00:36:40.650 --> 00:36:44.690
lets developers save and load
information to the cloud.

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:45.775
And that's kind of it.

00:36:45.775 --> 00:36:49.220
But it turns out basic and
simple Cloud Save solution

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.307
is really all a lot of
developers really need.

00:36:52.307 --> 00:36:54.140
And if you think about
it, this makes sense.

00:36:54.140 --> 00:36:57.670
This covers a lot of the
most problematic cases

00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:59.270
that players run into.

00:36:59.270 --> 00:37:01.450
The biggest being
the hey, I just

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:04.090
got a new device, and
this game that I've

00:37:04.090 --> 00:37:07.670
been playing for the last four
months and I'm up at level 30,

00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:10.750
I've installed on my new
device and, oh my god,

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:12.119
here I am at level one again.

00:37:12.119 --> 00:37:13.660
And I really don't
want to have to go

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:16.720
and unlock those same 30 levels.

00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:18.790
Maybe I'll go find
something else to play.

00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:21.770
I mean, developers tell us
that they see a drop off

00:37:21.770 --> 00:37:24.860
in game play when a user
upgrades their device.

00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.430
And I am quite sure this is
one of the main reasons why.

00:37:28.430 --> 00:37:30.940
No one wants to go and
unlock those same 60

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:32.740
beginning levels
again, just to get

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:34.820
to where they were last time.

00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:37.700
This also by the way
helps deal with the hey,

00:37:37.700 --> 00:37:39.954
I just uninstalled and
reinstalled my game,

00:37:39.954 --> 00:37:41.870
and oh my god, what
happened all my game data?

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:43.240
Is that gone too?

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:43.740
Forget it.

00:37:43.740 --> 00:37:45.430
I don't want to play
this game anymore.

00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:48.270
I mean, that could be
amazingly disheartening

00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:50.890
if you suddenly find
that all your progress is

00:37:50.890 --> 00:37:53.380
lost because you either
reinstalled the game,

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:55.280
or because you switched devices.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:59.281
So, please, please, please, look
at using Cloud Save if you can.

00:37:59.281 --> 00:38:01.780
For crying out loud, you don't
even have to use our service.

00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:03.360
Use some kind of
cloud save service.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.300
But you know, ours
is pretty good.

00:38:06.300 --> 00:38:08.060
So let's review.

00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.210
First, use the new sign-in flow.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:14.230
This nice intro animation should
be out to all Android devices

00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.820
now.

00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:17.800
So just send people right
into the OAuth dialogue.

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.270
It'll be a much better
experience for them.

00:38:20.270 --> 00:38:23.100
Achievements do matter, but
only if you do them right.

00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.370
Watch out for some of
the most common traps.

00:38:25.370 --> 00:38:27.100
Keep your leaderboards clean.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.651
Get a script to
do it if you can.

00:38:29.651 --> 00:38:31.400
You're going to have
enough people playing

00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:33.290
that I think automating
the process is

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:35.300
kind of the right solution here.

00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.730
Watch out for
multi-player variants.

00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:40.800
They can divide your
player pool to a point

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.705
where you don't have enough
good players to match

00:38:43.705 --> 00:38:45.280
your players with.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:50.580
And again, if you're playing
a real time multi-player game,

00:38:50.580 --> 00:38:51.870
add a quick match button.

00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:54.670
Get people into a game
as fast as they can.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.866
So that's it.

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:58.490
Thank you very much for sitting
through the whole presentation.

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:00.190
Wow, good for you.

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.460
If you have any
comments, any questions,

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:05.950
go ahead and add them in the
comments right below here.

00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:09.170
I do read them, and sometimes
I even respond to them.

00:39:09.170 --> 00:39:11.215
And go ahead and
follow me on G+.

00:39:11.215 --> 00:39:13.170
I'm right there.

00:39:13.170 --> 00:39:13.910
That's it.

00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:15.330
Thank you very
much for watching.

00:39:15.330 --> 00:39:18.170
And I will see you next time.
