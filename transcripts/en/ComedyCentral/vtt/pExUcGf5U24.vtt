00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:01.701
- Why are all the ghosts white?

00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:03.203
- That's a-- yeah.

00:00:03.203 --> 00:00:05.372 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You don't think any slaves
have unfinished business?

00:00:05.372 --> 00:00:07.340 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Interesting now,
because like you know,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.908
if you live in certain
gentrified neighborhoods,

00:00:08.908 --> 00:00:11.578 align:start position:0%
you can't tell if that person's
a ghost or just a hipster.

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:12.679 align:start size:84% position:16%
You don't know,
some of the clothes

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:13.513
these people are wearing.

00:00:13.513 --> 00:00:14.981
- Oh.

00:00:14.981 --> 00:00:15.782 align:start size:97% position:3%
- You have people out there
on the bus dressed like

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:16.316
Civil War generals.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:17.150
- Yeah.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.318
- Just on the bus.

00:00:18.318 --> 00:00:19.185 align:start size:88% position:13%
- And they're not
healthy, so you're like,

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.420
that's probably--

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.688
- Yeah, like this
guy has scurvy.

00:00:21.688 --> 00:00:22.756
- You shouldn't be translucent.

00:00:22.756 --> 00:00:25.725
(rock music)

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.061 align:start size:97% position:3%
- What's up everybody,
welcome to Stupid Questions,

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:30.130
I'm Chris Distefano,
AKA Chrissy the Nipple

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.133 align:start size:94% position:6% line:0%
with me, Josh Johnson.
Writer for The Daily Show,

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.735 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
got a great album
out called I Like You

00:00:35.735 --> 00:00:38.138 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
and he did a half hour
special last year.

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:39.472 align:start size:72% position:28%
I do like you.
- Thank you

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:40.306
- You're a good kid,
you got good energy.

00:00:40.306 --> 00:00:41.908
- I like you too.

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:42.742
- Appreciate it.

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:45.145 line:0%
(rock music)

00:00:47.914 --> 00:00:49.449 line:0%
- I think I'd be an avocado.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:51.418 line:0%
- Wow, is that--
that is a fruit.

00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:52.685
- Yeah.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:53.920 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Why would you want
to be an avocado?

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.455 align:start size:84% position:16%
- The seed is, like,
indestructible.

00:00:55.455 --> 00:00:57.357 align:start size:84% position:16%
- You can't destruct
that seed, yeah.

00:00:57.357 --> 00:00:59.125
- White women would be all
over me, if I was an avocado.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.760
- 100%

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.896
- That, or like an iced latte.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:04.230
But like, since you
asked me a fruit,

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.065
- Yeah.

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:06.266
- I'm gonna say a fruit.

00:01:06.266 --> 00:01:08.401 align:start size:88% position:13%
- Avocado. Or if you
were a sushi? Oh my god.

00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.335
- Yeah

00:01:09.335 --> 00:01:10.437
- White girls love sushi.

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:11.137 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Also whole
countries love sushi.

00:01:11.137 --> 00:01:13.540
(rock music)

00:01:18.711 --> 00:01:19.913 line:0%
My uncle.

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.715 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
My uncle's, like,
never had a good job.

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:23.917
- Right. Yeah.

00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:25.351
- And you can tell he's
never had a good job

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.321 align:start size:97% position:3%
because he, like, never
answers with one or two words.

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:29.923
Straight up, when you
ask him what he does

00:01:29.923 --> 00:01:31.524
he's like, "Well, what
you gotta know is.."

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:34.694
and it's like "No," (laughs)
"that's not how jobs work.

00:01:34.694 --> 00:01:35.929
"Just tell me what you do."

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.230
- I'm an electrician.
Tell you what I'm doing

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.731
- Exactly, get to it.

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:41.101
There was one time where
I straight up was asking

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.469
my uncle right, "How you
been, what you been up to?"

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.104
He's like, "Well you
like turkey, right?"

00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:47.373
And I'm like, "No, just
tell me what you do."

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:50.844
Now it turns out, turkeys
can't even breed naturally,

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.112
- Right

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:53.213
- So someone has to
jerk turkeys off.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:54.714
He was like a turkey jerker.

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:56.983
"Look, you want thanksgiving,
you gotta come through me"

(rock music)

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:03.490 line:0%
Throwing up.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.724 line:0%
- Yeah.

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.493 line:0%
- I've never seen,
like a hot throw up.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:07.660
- Yeah

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:08.361 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I've never seen
someone be like, "Blah."

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:09.195
- Yeah

00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:10.463
- You know what I mean?

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.898
It's always like,
"Graah!" (laughs)

00:02:11.898 --> 00:02:14.334 align:start size:94% position:6%
Have you ever met somebody
who, like, throws up

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:15.568
when they see people throw up?

00:02:15.568 --> 00:02:16.870
- Oh yeah, it's hilarious.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.272 align:start size:88% position:13%
- OK, so I have a
friend that's in Chicago

00:02:19.272 --> 00:02:22.008
and my buddy and I would
just stand next to him

00:02:22.008 --> 00:02:24.377
and be like, "Hey do you
guys want to- (gagging)"

00:02:24.377 --> 00:02:25.612
- Yeah

00:02:25.612 --> 00:02:26.846
- And he'd be like,
"What are you doing?"

00:02:26.846 --> 00:02:28.314 align:start size:84% position:16%
And we'd be like,
"Nothing- (gagging)"

00:02:28.314 --> 00:02:30.984 align:start size:97% position:3%
And we only ever did it
once because we felt so bad

00:02:30.984 --> 00:02:33.119
about it once it
actually happened.

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.053
- Yeah

00:02:34.053 --> 00:02:34.787
- It's like poking the bear.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:36.222
- Right

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:37.824 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And then he actually
threw up. And we were like,

00:02:37.824 --> 00:02:39.626
oh we gotta, like, take care
of him and stuff. (laughs)

00:02:39.626 --> 00:02:41.528
(rock music)

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:43.596
- What we do no this show is
you answer stupid questions

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:44.864
you get a stupid gift.

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:46.299
So I got you a gift.

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.036
What this is, it's
a turtleneck bib.

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.304
Because you have like a joke

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:53.072
and you have bitch
hands or something.

00:02:53.072 --> 00:02:56.109
So we figured that this
just encompasses a person

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.078 align:start size:97% position:3%
who says that he can't
choke someone out sexually.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:00.446
- I never said that I had--

00:03:00.446 --> 00:03:01.848
- Its a turtleneck.

00:03:01.848 --> 00:03:04.150 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Oh no, it looks completely
useless, thank you.

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:05.385
- Do you like the gift?

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:06.886
- Send the- No! I don't
like the gift at all.

00:03:06.886 --> 00:03:08.621
And you said that
I had bitch hands.

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.256
- Put it on.

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.090
Oh yeah.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.426
(laughs)

00:03:13.426 --> 00:03:14.460
- Then why is the
bib on the back?

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.929
(Chris laughs)

00:03:15.929 --> 00:03:17.297
What is this? Is this so
you don't have to clean it,

00:03:17.297 --> 00:03:19.399
you can just switch it around?

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:20.300
What is this trash?

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.868
- Look at this idiot.

00:03:21.868 --> 00:03:22.702
- Why are there two sides?

00:03:22.702 --> 00:03:24.137
- Just smile.

00:03:24.137 --> 00:03:26.406 align:start size:94% position:6%
- No, I'm not gonna
smile. I don't like this.

00:03:26.406 --> 00:03:27.507
This is dumb

00:03:27.507 --> 00:03:28.508 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I can even
remember which side--

00:03:28.508 --> 00:03:29.776
- Anger

00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:31.110
- This looks like
a bad porn outfit.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.646
- Hey, people are into that.

00:03:33.646 --> 00:03:35.148
- No, no one is into this.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:37.116
