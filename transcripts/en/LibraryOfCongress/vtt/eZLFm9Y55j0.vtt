00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.990
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.900
&gt;&gt; Wow!

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.200
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Welcome.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.370
Thank you for sticking
around for our Post Concert

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:25.670
Nightcap Conversation.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.300
Fortunately, there is no festive
beverage to accompany that,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.370 position:56%
but we'll do the best we can to get
out of here soon so we can get that.

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:35.350
So, I'm very thankful to all of
you for joining us this evening.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.120 position:56%
It was really a spectacular concert.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.590
Thank you to the musicians for
being phenomenal, of course.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.390
Feel free to clap.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:46.160
[ Audience Applause ]

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.460
Thank you.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.760
And so if you wouldn't
mind introducing yourselves

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.410
and maybe give a bit
about your background

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.800
and what your main jobs are these
days, whether some of you are

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.140
with orchestras or doing
Chamber music; more are teaching

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.420
or just teaching as soloists.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.720
&gt;&gt; Lydia Brown: Start with me?

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.020
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Sure.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.320
&gt;&gt; Lydia Brown: Hi.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.620
My name is Lydia Brown.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:07.530
I'm a pianist, and I do a
lot of work with singers

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.230
in any capacity that I can do it.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.490
I'm working at the Metropolitan
Opera and San Francisco Opera,

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.000
and I've recently joined the staff

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.200
of the Cincinnati College
Conservatory of Music,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.480
where I coach singers all
day long, and I'm just,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.390
I've always been happiest
when they were around.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.220
So, I'm glad to have been
overseeing the vocal program evolve

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.920
over the last ten years, and
that was actually really one

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.800
of the greatest gifts that I was
ever given to me was the chance

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.370
to be able to work with
singers, the young singers,

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.690 position:56%
seven weeks every summer, and we do,
you know, this kind of repertoire,

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.760
and then also vocal ensemble
with only piano, and to me,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.950
it's like my greatest joy.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.650 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Albers: I'm Becca Albers.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:01.580
My main job, I guess, is
Assistant Principal Violist

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:05.720
of the Minnesota Orchestra, and I
also play a lot of tuber music in

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.020
and around Minnesota and, I guess,
around the rest of the country.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.160 position:56%
But and then I also teach, actually,
at McAllister College and St. Paul

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.440
and also down at the Robert
McDuffie Center for Strings

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.380
at Mercer University in Georgia.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.890
So, I go down there three
times a month usually.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.610
I'm going in a couple of days,
in the middle of the tour,

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.660
but it's nice to have a lot
of variety in what I'm doing.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.770
&gt;&gt; Alice Yoo: Hi.

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:35.810 position:56%
&gt;&gt; The mike, [inaudible] the button.

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.110
&gt;&gt; Alice Yoo: Hello.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.810
Okay. My name is Alice Yoo.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.560
I am originally from Montana,
and I was living in New York

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.400
until this past year when I
moved to Denver, Colorado,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.850
and I've been playing with the
[inaudible] Symphony for the last,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:58.960
I guess, four, five months,
and fairly new there.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.990
So, I really love it
there, and I'm happy.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:12.200
&gt;&gt; Carmit Zori: Carmit Zori,
I'm originally from Tel Aviv,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:18.130
and I play chamber
music for a living,

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.750
and I teach at Rockford
University, part-time,

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.760
and also at Purchase College.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.870
That's it.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michelle Ross: I'm Michelle Ross.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.610
I live in New York.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.130
I was born in California,
and I guess I do a little bit

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.160
of everything these days; lots
of chamber music and some solo

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.530
and sometimes some guest
concert master work,

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:51.130
which is really fun,
and I also compose.

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.350
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: I'm Nick
Phan, and I just travel

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.550
around being a guest soloist
mostly with various orchestras,

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.770
opera companies, [microphone
noise] microphones.

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:06.200
Yeah, and that's what I do.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.500
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: So,
and I'm Nick Brown.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.870
I'm the concert producer
of this evening's concert.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.210
I've worked with some
great colleagues

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.510
in the concert office here,

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.930
and apologies for not introducing
myself at the beginning.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.570
Just a reminder that we are being
filmed for this Conversation

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.820
so that you can tell all your
friends and send them a link later

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.580
on that you heard some
great insights

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:23.350
from the musicians this evening.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.650
All right.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:25.950
So, the first thing
I'd love for us to talk

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.590
about is the Marlboro Process
for from putting concerts

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.570
and repertoire together in the
summer, where you come from all

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.420
over the country or all over the
world into that setting; and then,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.140
you bring things back on tour.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.450 position:56%
So, what is that experience like for
you all with the big gap in between?

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.650
&gt;&gt; Carmit Zori: Big gap.

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.950
What do you mean by that?

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:50.360
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: As in, was this
program originally performed this

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.660
past summer?

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.980
&gt;&gt; Carmit Zori: A portion of
the program was performed.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.280
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Okay.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:57.540 position:56%
Cool! So, what's the experience for
you to put it together in the summer

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:59.810
and then come back together
after may not seeing each other

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.110
since that summer season?

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.930
&gt;&gt; Carmit Zori: Well, we're
all sensitive musicians,

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:13.600
and we like to work hard,
and what we do in the summer,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.130
it's like an orgy of chamber music,

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:21.930
and so when we are actually meeting
it's like meeting old friends,

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:31.860
and it's a big party of hard work,
and it's incredibly rewarding.

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.340
So, yeah, that's what
it's like; it's very nice.

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.180
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: I had
the [inaudible] position

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:42.150
of joining this group because when
they performed this three summers

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.930
ago it was with a different
tenor, who was not actually able

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:47.080
to do the tour in the end.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.720
So, I, as a former alum,
was, they called me next,

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.120
and I performed this
piece, The [inaudible]

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.620
in particular many times,
and what was so nice

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.310
about coming together this week
was it's generally hard to find

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:07.310
that sort of group sound somehow,

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.710
and jumping into this,
they all had it already.

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.780
So, all I had to do was
just sort of dive in,

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:15.980
and it's been a really luxurious
experience to be working

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.570
with these lovely ladies
this past week.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.100
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:22.400
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Albers: Mutual.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.700
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: Thank you.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.000
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Albers: It's worth
mentioning that the piece

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.980
that this tour was arranged
around was the Vaughan Williams,

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.570
and so everything else
on the program is new

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:33.570
to us as a, as an ensemble.

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:36.130
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Where
is this tour taking you,

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.490 position:56%
and where will you go next together?

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.870
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Albers: We started in
Boston at the Gardiner Museum,

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:45.440
and then we were at Wyle
[phonetic], at Carnegie on Monday.

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.230
Tomorrow, we're in
Philadelphia, and then we're

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:51.650 position:56%
in Greenwich, Connecticut on Sunday.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:52.950
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Okay.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.080
What do you think about
your sort of unique set

00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:58.210
of professional experiences
as individuals?

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.230 position:56%
You come from from different
backgrounds, right, and you do a lot

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:02.770
of different things in different
combinations, and some of that,

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.380
is it similar between each of you?

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:09.470
What do you bring to the
table when you meet together?

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:10.770
So, does one of you as more

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:14.510
of an [inaudible] player have a
certain personality versus Nick

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:17.840
as the touring tenor might have a
different personality, you know?

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:19.140
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: Oh, no.

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:21.440
Be nice.

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:25.230
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Or
does that not matter?

00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:26.530
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: Which
is it [inaudible] casting.

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:27.830
&gt;&gt; Lydia Brown: I don't know.

00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:32.290
I mean, I think, you know, we
all, what binds us, what binds us

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:34.740
and bonds us is music,
and so somehow I think

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:40.320
in a way our outside
experiences, in a way, we , I hope,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.560
I think they just inform
who we are as people

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.860
and who we are as musicians.

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:45.160
And when we're all
in a room together,

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:48.640 position:56%
I think it's just we're just dealing
with the notes and the feelings

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:51.630
between the notes, and I
think somehow, I don't know,

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:53.820
it kind of simplifies things,
you know, as kind of the rest,

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:59.360
at least for me, kind of falls
away, and it's just five of us and,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.650
you know, six of us, and
we're just there trying

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:08.470
to kind of unearth some answers.

00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.430
And so, I don' know, I
guess for me personally,

00:08:10.430 --> 00:08:12.910
I feel a little bit
less kind of overwhelmed

00:08:12.910 --> 00:08:14.210
by other [inaudible] the opposite.

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.640
My feelings are more just about
this is what we're here to do,

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:20.640
and let's find it together.

00:08:20.640 --> 00:08:21.940
Yeah.

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:29.150
&gt;&gt; Michelle Ross: What's so amazing
about Marlboro is that everyone is

00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:33.920
at a different point in their
life, their age, their career,

00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:37.510
wherever they are professionally
around the world,

00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:43.290
but the thing that matters is what
kind of musicianship you bring,

00:08:43.290 --> 00:08:45.550
and I actually think it's
kind of the other way around.

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.860
It's like that's the standard

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.410
for us is playing chamber
music with each other.

00:08:51.410 --> 00:08:55.700
So, whether or not in our
real lives we're, you know,

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.590
outside of the Marlboro oasis
where in an orchestra or teaching,

00:09:00.590 --> 00:09:02.130
it's the musicianship
that you're bringing

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.460
to every single one
of those situations.

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:08.650
So, all of your experiences and the
composite experiences is amazing

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:11.690
because everyone, just
because of everyone's,

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.700
the variety of personality and
perspective regardless is going

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.070
to bring something to the table.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:21.170
But I think what's so
amazing about Marlboro

00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:25.490
and what it inspires
is this absolute focus

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.090
on what's important
about making music.

00:09:28.090 --> 00:09:31.200
So, to be able to do the tour
in the middle of the year is

00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:35.940
like for me it's just this gift of,
a reminder of what it's like to be

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:41.980
so inspired and challenged by your
colleagues and by the composers

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:46.870 position:56%
and the works and to have this
almost impossible task of, you know,

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:51.340
making, bringing what, as
much as we can to each other

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:53.090
and to the music and
to the performer.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:58.020
So, it's a gift to be able to
do that in this little mini way.

00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:00.630
&gt;&gt; Carmit Zori: I think,
and to add to this,

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:04.370
is I think we all respect
each other, and it's,

00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:09.950
the rehearsal period is and
concerts from one to another is

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:14.570
like an intellectual and
emotional feast, you know.

00:10:14.570 --> 00:10:18.350
That's what's so, it's just lovely!

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:19.650
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: That's great.

00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:20.950
That's what we love to hear.

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.290
The last person I'm going
to ask before we turn it

00:10:24.290 --> 00:10:25.730
over to audience [inaudible] is

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.150
about the Vocal Chamber
Music repertoire.

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:30.450
So, we had the Vaughan Williams,
which was just spectacular,

00:10:30.450 --> 00:10:33.180
and also the Beethoven, which
is probably something that few

00:10:33.180 --> 00:10:36.310
of us have ever heard before,
but is really exciting to hear.

00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:42.020
How do you approach the Chamber
Ensemble plus voice repertoire

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:47.350 position:56%
differently than non-voice
repertoire, or non-vocal repertoire?

00:10:47.350 --> 00:10:49.150
&gt;&gt; Lydia Brown: I mean,
I can start this.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:50.870
I'm sure Nick has a lot to say too.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:56.960
But I think, I've, personally,
I always feel like the pianist

00:10:56.960 --> 00:11:02.270
and the singer are kind of the core
even within local chamber music.

00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.560
And so, I always oftentimes
at Marlboro,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:07.160
I'll rehearse with the
singer just with piano.

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.080
It depends on the piece,
but I mean I think that only

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.830
if the singer feels like
they have that as a place

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:19.330
where they can always, you know,
be at one with that instrument.

00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:22.780
So, it kind of keeps the song
aspect of it kind of central.

00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:26.470
And then, I think, after that,
you know, it's kind of trying

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:31.650 position:56%
to find the reasons that the
instruments exist based on the text,

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.600
and then everything
goes around that.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.400
But I just feel from my own
experience that if you start

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.240
from that singer, piano
kind of core, it helps.

00:11:42.890 --> 00:11:44.190
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Albers: Well,

00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:46.140
I think having the text is
maybe the biggest difference

00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.610
because it brings it completely --

00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.750
I mean, for us, it's sort of a
foreign element and just thinking

00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:56.560
about how the text relates to
every little gesture and line,

00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.180
it's a different starting
point; I think,

00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.490
ultimately, a different result.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:04.840
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: Yeah,
but the text,

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.990
music is such an abstract
thing by itself.

00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.600
You know, it's an abstract way of
expressing an abstract emotion,

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.570
and maybe a composer, most likely,

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.600
a composer has something
specific in mind.

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.730
But you know, it's left to us
to sort of infer and guess and,

00:12:20.730 --> 00:12:22.250
you know, if we're lucky,
read a book about it,

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.800
or something, if that exists.

00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:28.690
But the text makes
the abstract concrete,

00:12:28.690 --> 00:12:32.630
and that is a huge
difference, I find.

00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:37.660
I think the other challenge,
the biggest challenge with it is

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:43.880 position:56%
that it's hard to find singers who
can feel comfortable in that setting

00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:49.160
because we start late, you know,
we have to wait for our bodies

00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:54.670
to finish changing, and so a lot
of singers come to music very late

00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:59.150
when all of you guys have been
doing it since they were four,

00:12:59.150 --> 00:13:02.370
and most singers probably
don't start until they 16, 17,

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:04.780
and 18; sometimes, even later.

00:13:04.780 --> 00:13:08.930
And it creates a different
kind of relationship with music

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.660
for most singers, I think.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:13.360
And then there are a few of us,
like me, where I actually started

00:13:13.360 --> 00:13:16.680
like you guys when I was four,
and I tried really poorly

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.130
to play their instruments.

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:24.010 position:56%
So, for me, doing the vocal chamber
music actually is a real big passion

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:27.780
for me because it allows me
to reconnect with what kind

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.280
of made me fall in love with
music in the first place as a kid.

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.880
I mean, I used to love reading
[inaudible] string Quartets

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:38.210
and whatever, and it probably
sounded absolutely horrifying.

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:41.520
But it was fun, and that's kind
of why I wanted to be a musician,

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:45.820
so it's, these moments are really
luxurious for me personally

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:49.790
because it's like, ah, you
know, stop being a singer

00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:52.420 position:56%
and just kind of be one of the gang.

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:53.720
It's fun.

00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.010
&gt;&gt; Carmit Zori: One more thing that
happens when we play with singer

00:13:56.010 --> 00:14:00.570 position:56%
or probably wood bits also, any
kind of thing that they're different

00:14:00.570 --> 00:14:06.600 position:56%
from us is that we have to learn how
to adjust the kind of sound we do

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:11.950 position:56%
and make sure that his words or her,
whoever is singing with us, come,

00:14:11.950 --> 00:14:15.720
and it's a different click for us.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.020
Wonderful!

00:14:17.020 --> 00:14:18.320
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Great.

00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:20.280
A slight follow up question,
so when you have a piece

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:26.300
like the Vaughan Williams, do you
let Nick present an interpretation

00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.570
of the text, and then
you kind of respect that?

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:29.870
Do you work collaboratively?

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:32.940 position:56%
Do you all do close readings of the
text, or is it just an organic thing

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.280
that happens in rehearsals?

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:37.290
&gt;&gt; Chamber music, chamber music.

00:14:37.290 --> 00:14:39.700
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: We had a lot of
discussions, and actually it was

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:42.620 position:56%
so nice to have this week, the time
this week to have those discussions.

00:14:42.620 --> 00:14:45.410
It's kind of the Marlboro way.

00:14:45.410 --> 00:14:47.810
You have to ask a lot of
questions, and it's great.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.860
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Awesome!

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.100
Great! So, we'll open the
floor up to all of you.

00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:54.000
If you could just raise your
hand, and my colleague, Simon,

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.210
will bring over a microphone,
and we'll try and get a few

00:14:58.210 --> 00:15:00.860
of these in tonight before we go.

00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:03.530
&gt;&gt; Great. Aye.

00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:15:04.950 --> 00:15:08.140
I'm, well, first, let me say I
enjoyed the whole concert tonight.

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:11.730
I certainly enjoyed the
instrumental parts tremendously.

00:15:11.730 --> 00:15:16.730
The Razumousky was great and the
Haydn was great, and I would really

00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:19.040
like it if you'd expand
a little bit more

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:24.940
on Nicholas Brown's question
about the vocal parts.

00:15:24.940 --> 00:15:33.500
First of all, have
either the Beethoven

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:38.410
or the [inaudible] been
recorded very much before?

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:39.750
How well known are these?

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:42.060
They're not well known to me.

00:15:42.060 --> 00:15:46.880
I remember that last year or the
year before, you had a program here

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:54.960
at the library that featured
George Thompson works

00:15:54.960 --> 00:16:00.990
for the Haydn did the
instrumental music for.

00:16:00.990 --> 00:16:03.030
That was a really great program.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.840
I don't remember from that that
Thompson had written anything or,

00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:10.980
I'm sorry, had asked anybody else,
but apparently, he asked a lot

00:16:10.980 --> 00:16:15.750
of other people to help him out,
and Beethoven is one of those.

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.970 position:56%
So, is this, how well known is this?

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:21.640
Has this been widely recorded,
either the Beethoven leader,

00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:24.480
or for that matter, the Vaughan
Williams, is that widely recorded?

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.680
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: So, the Vaughan
Williams is an extraordinarily

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:30.130
popular piece in the UK, and
there are a ton of recordings.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:36.790
If you search on Spotify, you'll
probably find at least five.

00:16:36.790 --> 00:16:41.770
The Beethoven is less recorded, but
there is a complete recording on DG

00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:45.750
with Malcolm Martineau and
a bunch of British singers

00:16:45.750 --> 00:16:48.090
and two beautiful players.

00:16:48.090 --> 00:16:49.490
So, the recordings do exist.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:52.640
They're not, it's not quite
as widely known and, I mean,

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:59.120
I think we focus on other things by
Beethoven like the Ninth Symphony,

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.620
or other things of that ilk.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.920
Yeah, exactly.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:03.220
So, I just think that's
why it's not as known,

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:04.970
as other works sort of overshadow.

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:07.290
They cast a giant shadow
and, you know,

00:17:07.290 --> 00:17:10.010
you have to be really interested
in Beethoven to kind of --

00:17:10.010 --> 00:17:11.310
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:12.610
&gt;&gt; So, when you put
together a program

00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:16.090
like this general chamber
music audience, okay,

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:22.390
you can be pretty sure that
if it includes vocal music

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:25.600
like this, it'll be well received.

00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:28.280
People, they're going
to like it, and so.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:29.580
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: We hope so.

00:17:29.580 --> 00:17:30.880
[Laughing] I'm sorry.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.330
I don't mean to dominate this
conversation, but my take on,

00:17:34.330 --> 00:17:36.700
I've founded an organization

00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.200
in Chicago called Collaborative
Arts Institute of Chicago,

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:43.110
and the mission of the organization
is to promote vocal chamber music

00:17:43.110 --> 00:17:48.010
and art song because that
is like the dustiest corner

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.120
of the classical music world.

00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:56.480 position:56%
And that, this particular music I
think is kind of losing its audience

00:17:56.480 --> 00:18:00.760
because of just, you know, the way
technology and the way we relate

00:18:00.760 --> 00:18:04.320
to music and listen to music and
discover music has changed because,

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:07.240
as we were saying before,
with texts,

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:11.970 position:56%
so much of vocal music really
relies on what is the singer saying;

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:13.830
otherwise, it just sounds like
a singer is shouting at you

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.760
in some language for 20
minutes, and you're like, why?

00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:21.720
And so, you kind of, it kind
of puts a barrier, you know,

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:24.220
but back in the time of recordings
when we actually listened

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.060
to physical copy of things, and you
had liner notes, and you had text

00:18:27.060 --> 00:18:30.180
and translations, and those
things were like available

00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:32.230
without even thinking because
it was all just one thing.

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:35.260
You didn't have to do the extra
Googles or search or whatever.

00:18:35.260 --> 00:18:41.000
And so, what I'm finding in my
experienced over the last decade,

00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.480
since I was at Marlboro,
has been that the audiences

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:49.850
that love this repertoire are
the chamber music audiences

00:18:49.850 --> 00:18:52.670
because you guys are
so knowledgeable

00:18:52.670 --> 00:18:56.160
about every corner
of classical music.

00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.970
And because there's just
not so many platforms for us

00:18:59.970 --> 00:19:06.310 position:56%
to perform this kind of music,
these audiences, you, are responding

00:19:06.310 --> 00:19:08.300
because you think, oh
gosh, great, that's nice.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.290 position:56%
I haven't heard that in a long time.

00:19:10.290 --> 00:19:13.710
And so, actually, I've found
that in general when trying

00:19:13.710 --> 00:19:15.780
to promote the repertoire
in general,

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:20.150 position:56%
first place once you turn is the
chamber music audience because it's,

00:19:20.150 --> 00:19:23.900
it's such a welcome respite, you
know, on a program that's two hours

00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:26.850
with just interested
in instrumental music.

00:19:26.850 --> 00:19:29.470
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.580
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown:
Any other questions?

00:19:31.580 --> 00:19:33.880
In the back here?

00:19:37.090 --> 00:19:41.320
&gt;&gt; Hi. First, thank you so much
for the wonderful performance.

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:49.200 position:56%
I have a question for, for the
singer, is there a particular reason

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.060
that you have decided
to choose English,

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.640
sing in English rather than German?

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:04.840
And if you had a chance to
sing in German, would there,

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:09.150
what would be the difference
as a singer?

00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:13.060
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: So, just today,
this program, which was developed

00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.680
by Marlboro, just happened
to be English.

00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:17.460 position:56%
I would have happily sung in German.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:20.360
The Beethoven songs were
intended to be sung in English.

00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:22.250
He wrote, he set them
for the English words.

00:20:22.250 --> 00:20:25.170
So, that's why we're
in English today.

00:20:25.170 --> 00:20:29.500
If I were singing in German, it
would just be a little extra work

00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:31.600
for me before I walk on stage.

00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.120
I mean, that's the only thing
I would do really differently.

00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.730
It's also sometimes with
German, I find that there's just

00:20:38.730 --> 00:20:41.730 position:56%
because it's not my native language,
and it's not your native language,

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:43.420
or most of the people in the
audience, you have to kind

00:20:43.420 --> 00:20:46.470
of do just a little extra
work to be extra specific.

00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:49.250
You know, English affords
you the opportunity to paint

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:51.000 position:56%
with some broader strokes sometimes,

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.320
which because you know the
audience will, hopefully,

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:58.700
if I'm singing properly, understand
what's happening more easily.

00:20:58.700 --> 00:21:02.480 position:56%
So, that's, basically, it just
requires a little bit extra homework

00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.810
and a little bit of extra practice.

00:21:06.810 --> 00:21:09.110
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown:
Any other questions?

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.460
Yes, Michael.

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.760
&gt;&gt; Michael: Thank you.

00:21:12.760 --> 00:21:19.610
My [inaudible] and it was wonderful
to see Marlboro here away from --

00:21:19.610 --> 00:21:20.910
we were watching at home.

00:21:20.910 --> 00:21:22.210
We're very grateful to the library

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:24.660
for hosting while our
[inaudible] was closed.

00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:27.470
I have a pretty singer's question.

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:30.780
I sing in a church choir, and
listening to the Vaughan Williams,

00:21:30.780 --> 00:21:34.480
I, of course, as an amateur singer,

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.180
we do not like singing the e-vowel
very much, especially if it's high

00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:41.500
or loud, and listening
to Vaughan Williams,

00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:47.370
I think I only heard
one extended e-sound.

00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.300
All the rest were a, o, ah,
beautiful sounds to sing.

00:21:51.300 --> 00:21:56.230
So, did Vaughan Williams go out
of his way, as far as you know,

00:21:56.230 --> 00:22:00.190
or do really good composers writing
[inaudible] go out of their way

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:06.960
to avoid forcing that singer
to sing e-vowel loud or long?

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.090
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: I think
just we lucked out this time

00:22:12.090 --> 00:22:15.330
because of Housman's poetry,
there's not a lot of spaces where,

00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:18.110
or words that involved
e on a stressed syllable

00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:22.080
that Vaughan Williams would
have wanted to emphasize.

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:26.230
So, I think it's mostly luck
of the draw on this one, yes.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:29.520
Unfortunately, sometimes
professional singers also do not

00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:34.630
always like doing that, and we
are still required to sing e

00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:38.060
for long periods of time
on high, high notes.

00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:39.670
We just pray that it
sounds beautiful.

00:22:39.670 --> 00:22:44.480
&gt;&gt; Michael: Can I ask one
more question just about that?

00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:49.090
If I were to listen to an
English tenor, or an Irish

00:22:49.090 --> 00:22:52.850
or Scottish tenor, and an
English or a UK Quartet,

00:22:52.850 --> 00:22:57.130
would the pronunciation

00:22:57.130 --> 00:23:01.470
in non-American dialect
be very different,

00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:07.460
and then would it affect how the
string players and piano accompany?

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:08.950
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: From my
perspective, I really try and go

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:13.420
for the British accent in these
particular songs, and I mean,

00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.770
I'm an America, so I'm doing
my best Meryl Streep, you know.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:17.570
That's --

00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:21.920
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:23.910
She's the master of
Excellence [phonetic].

00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.210
&gt;&gt; I know.

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:26.510
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: So,
I'm just, you know,

00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:27.810
that's what I'm basically doing.

00:23:27.810 --> 00:23:29.520
You might hear, obviously,
more British things.

00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:33.220
British singers tend to
approach certain vowels

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:36.080
in a much darker fashion
than American singers do

00:23:36.080 --> 00:23:39.610
because the vowels are just
darker in their accent.

00:23:39.610 --> 00:23:42.620
But as for how that affects
you guys, I can't really say.

00:23:42.620 --> 00:23:44.890
&gt;&gt; Carmit Zori: Well,
just if anything was going

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:48.750
to be extremely delicate, we
would, after we talk about it,

00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:50.220
probably agree [phonetic].

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:51.520
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: True.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.820
So, probably a little bit.

00:23:52.820 --> 00:23:55.310
But I mean, I really feel like
this music sounds a little funny

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:57.220
if you just go for a
completely American accent.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.510
So, I aim for it like at least
mid-Atlantic to Meryl Streep.

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:07.540
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.840
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Okay.

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:10.440 position:56%
I'm going to close out with one last
question now, but before I do that,

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.180
I just want to reiterate
what Michael said.

00:24:12.180 --> 00:24:13.530 position:56%
Michael, of course, is our colleague

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:15.600
over at the First [inaudible]
Galleries, and he's the head

00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.740
of the Music Program and
Performing Arts Program in there.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:22.300
He's been such a treat to work with
last season and this season as well

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:26.300
as the library has co-presented the
musicians from Marlboro concerts,

00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:30.770
at least several of them, while
their hall is being renovated.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.070
So, thank you to the
[inaudible] Galleries

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:34.020 position:56%
for working with us on this project.

00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.110
It's been such a treat to have the
Marlboro organization in our Hall

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:39.730
for a change, and I know it's
happened in the past before,

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.030
and we hope that we'll continue
to collaborate like this.

00:24:42.030 --> 00:24:44.140
And there's all kinds of
information in your program

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.540
about the Career [inaudible]
Galleries,

00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.760
information about when you
can get back into their spaces

00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.280
and that kind of business.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:51.730
Check out their website
and also check

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:53.970
out their social media presence,
which is really exciting.

00:24:53.970 --> 00:24:57.380
They have some really
phenomenal things going

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:00.000
on on Instagram, I believe.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.610
So, anyways, there's that.

00:25:01.610 --> 00:25:03.510
And we also have one more
performance by, oh yes, Michael.

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:08.110
[ Inaudible Question ]

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:10.520
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Hopefully, yes.

00:25:10.520 --> 00:25:15.570
So, our latest radio series just
concluded, and we're discussing

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:18.100 position:56%
with Rita to figure out what's next.

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:21.350
One thing that we do hope with this
concert is that at least a portion

00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:23.090
of it will go up online
as a webcast.

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:25.670
You can see one of the Marlboro
concerts from last season

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.530
on our website,
www.lsu.gov/broadcast,

00:25:28.530 --> 00:25:32.340
and you can also see in here
Nick's recital from last season

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.880
when he was here performing
Britain and Shumann

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.300
and Bowles and Rorum [phonetic].

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.600
That's a really great concert,

00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:40.350
so you can hear him doing
some different repertoire.

00:25:40.350 --> 00:25:44.020
And so Marlboro is going
to be here again in March.

00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:46.190
So, check out our website
for information about that.

00:25:46.190 --> 00:25:48.420
If you don't have a ticket,
sign up with a Ticket Alert,

00:25:48.420 --> 00:25:49.810
or just come to the door.

00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:52.610 position:56%
As you see, there are always empty
seats because people do not show up.

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.850
They're not committed to their
ticket orders for some reason,

00:25:55.850 --> 00:25:59.350
but don't, we don't want you to be
discouraged by sold out notices.

00:25:59.350 --> 00:26:00.650
Always come on down.

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:03.810
So, the last question, and
I'll say it's for the ladies,

00:26:03.810 --> 00:26:07.020
since Nick got to talk
about singing.

00:26:07.020 --> 00:26:12.340
My question is, on your tours,
maybe specific to Marlboro,

00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.940
or just your own experiences,
what is your process

00:26:15.940 --> 00:26:18.550
of adapting to the concert halls?

00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:19.850
So, for example, on this tour,

00:26:19.850 --> 00:26:21.720
you've been in the
Gardiner Museum's Hall,

00:26:21.720 --> 00:26:25.160
which is that vertical box thing,
which is really funky and cool.

00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:26.470 position:56%
If anyone hasn't seen it, go see it.

00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:27.770
It's really cool.

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:30.130
And in Wyle [phonetic],
and now are out here

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.990
and other exciting
venues coming up too.

00:26:33.990 --> 00:26:38.460
&gt;&gt; Lydia Brown: Well, I
think, you know, as a pianist,

00:26:38.460 --> 00:26:43.500
we have been raised to
do this our whole lives.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.200
It's actually part of the job.

00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:48.780
So, you know, I think
it's always a challenge.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:52.480
I actually enjoy the challenge
of trying to kind of be able

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.380
to make any instrument in front
of you sound beautiful and never

00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.750
to make any excuses about it.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.570
So, I don't know, that's probably,

00:27:01.570 --> 00:27:04.210
that's my own personal
kind of love and challenge.

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.580
Other is kind of to try
to find the instrument

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:11.340
and find the places that,
the way that it sings.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.620
You know, you try to find
the soul of the instrument,

00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:16.560
and you have usually a little
bit of time to do that.

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:21.680
And then, I think once you find
that, I think it's easy to find,

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:25.690
I think any musician has to find
that sound within themselves.

00:27:25.690 --> 00:27:28.600
And then, I think once you
have that, and you can kind

00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:36.690 position:56%
of fit your sound around your
place, and so I think that's always,

00:27:36.690 --> 00:27:38.560
I start with myself and
the piano sound first,

00:27:38.560 --> 00:27:42.440
and then I think once I, then
I feel like I can open up.

00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:46.970
But I think if I didn't do the,
if I didn't have that first,

00:27:46.970 --> 00:27:49.870
it would be harder for me.

00:27:49.870 --> 00:27:51.170
&gt;&gt; Carmit Zori: We do have to say

00:27:51.170 --> 00:27:53.710
that tonight was a
really big spoiled.

00:27:53.710 --> 00:27:55.280
Tonight was being spoiled.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.580
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Thank you.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:01.040
&gt;&gt; Carmit Zori: This is a Hall
that loves our instruments.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.340
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:07.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Carmit Zori: So, and compliments,
the audience make us feel good too.

00:28:07.430 --> 00:28:12.940 position:56%
Somehow, when you played, we felt
something in the air, and that makes

00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:19.250
for always alleviating a
wonderful rapport in playing.

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:20.550
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Well, thank you.

00:28:20.550 --> 00:28:21.850
We appreciate that on your behalf.

00:28:21.850 --> 00:28:26.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Michelle Ross: I think it's funny

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:31.950
because no matter how many Halls
you go to or rooms or galleries,

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:36.250 position:56%
or whatever you're playing in, every
soundtrack is going to be a moment

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:40.950
where you have this like if you
feel like you don't have control

00:28:40.950 --> 00:28:45.260 position:56%
because it's different, and I
always try and remember that as soon

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:51.230
as there are bodies in the space,
99% of the time, it feels perfect,

00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:55.700
and tonight was so special
because the Hall was amazing

00:28:55.700 --> 00:29:00.190
when we got here, and we just
played to Carnegie on Monday, so.

00:29:00.190 --> 00:29:02.460
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown:
Take that, New York.

00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:04.510
&gt;&gt; Michelle Ross: So, we're coming
from a really beautiful experience,

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:11.320
and there was something so special
about, also what Carmit was talking

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.090
about in terms of the
history of this Hall.

00:29:15.090 --> 00:29:19.460
I know she mentioned the Budapest
Quartet right before we played the

00:29:19.460 --> 00:29:25.930
concert, and I was so moved
just thinking about that,

00:29:25.930 --> 00:29:29.570 position:56%
and not consciously while I'm
playing, but it was just feeling so.

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.840
I think in a way touring
is so special

00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.200
because you don't have very
much time in all these places,

00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:38.070
but it's you're so concentrating.

00:29:38.070 --> 00:29:41.100
You bring so much of yourself that
you end up getting so much back,

00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:47.030
and I thought it was so special
tonight to feel the space change

00:29:47.030 --> 00:29:50.520
with the audience and know
what amazing legacy we're --

00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:51.820
&gt;&gt; Tradition.

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:53.120
&gt;&gt; Michelle Ross: Yeah,
where, tradition,

00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.420
we're so honored to be a part of.

00:29:54.420 --> 00:29:58.920
So, that was and I think if you
can bring that mindset to any hall

00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:03.480
and just kind of trust that it's a
part of your instrument in a way.

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:08.710
So, then it sort of
alleviates all of the stress.

00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:14.110 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Alice Yoo: Well, for me, wherever
I go, I try to make it a challenge

00:30:14.110 --> 00:30:16.740
of being really present and aware.

00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:22.510
So, in not a hall like this;
maybe it's not an ideal space,

00:30:22.510 --> 00:30:27.240 position:56%
then instead of focusing on what you
wish it could be or you're trying

00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.840
to make something happen,
but you just sort of try

00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:33.110
and make yourself really
present for where you are.

00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:38.540
And then, some of that helps
me accept where I'm playing

00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:40.670
and what my colleagues
are doing around me

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:42.520
and what's coming back towards me.

00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:46.250
So, even if you're playing
Carnegie or just a hall like this,

00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:51.920
or in a concrete box, the
experience that you're,

00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:56.150
where you're sitting is
it'll still be a special one

00:30:56.150 --> 00:30:57.800
because you're present.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.490
Does that make sense?

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:03.910
&gt;&gt; Rebecca Albers: I don't
really have anything to add.

00:31:03.910 --> 00:31:07.960
I freaked, and I think it's
always interesting to listen,

00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:12.000
to try to listen kind of from the
outside when you're in a new space

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.860
because what's happening right
here is always a different,

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.570
it's a different experience
than if you're listening

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:21.290
to higher sound that's coming back.

00:31:21.290 --> 00:31:24.020
So, it's, I really enjoy actually
playing in different halls

00:31:24.020 --> 00:31:29.910
because it's interesting and
it's kind of a fun challenge too

00:31:29.910 --> 00:31:31.800
for your ears and for
physicality play.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:37.260
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Did you
want to chime in, Nick?

00:31:37.260 --> 00:31:38.560
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Phan: No.

00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:39.860
&gt;&gt; Nicholas Brown: Oh!

00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:42.490
Great. Well, thank you
all for spending some time

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:43.790
with us after the concert.

00:31:43.790 --> 00:31:46.260
I know it's exhausting to do
that and then have to come out

00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:47.850
and do more in front
of the audience,

00:31:47.850 --> 00:31:49.160
but they really appreciate it.

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:50.460
We really appreciate it,

00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:53.000
and the viewers online will
definitely appreciate it as well.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.580
And just since you mentioned the
Budapest Quartet's experience here,

00:31:57.580 --> 00:31:59.000
being a library and an archive,

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.380
we do happen to have the
Budapest Quartet's Orca.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.440
So, we have all of their scores
and their parts and their markings.

00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.270
So, out there in YouTube
land, if you're hearing this,

00:32:08.270 --> 00:32:10.410
you can come and copy
their markings.

00:32:10.410 --> 00:32:13.090
Check out our website, www.lsc.gov,

00:32:13.090 --> 00:32:14.720
and you can search
for Budapest Quartet.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:17.070
You'll find recordings, all kinds
of other available materials,

00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:18.370
and then there's a
special collection

00:32:18.370 --> 00:32:19.960
of theirs in the Music Division.

00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:22.970
If you're having any trouble
finding out how to access that,

00:32:22.970 --> 00:32:26.310
just click on the Ask a Librarian
link anywhere on the website,

00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:29.840
and you can send a direct question
to our Music Reference librarians,

00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.140
and they will help you out.

00:32:31.140 --> 00:32:34.630
They're really a fantastic bunch,
and we're the biggest Music Library

00:32:34.630 --> 00:32:36.550
in the world, so how about that.

00:32:36.550 --> 00:32:38.380
So, thank you again for being here.

00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:42.230
Thank you again for being
here, and we'll look forward

00:32:42.230 --> 00:32:44.220
to all reconvening
sometime in the future

00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:48.320
to hear you all play some
more and sing some more.

00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:51.430
And without further ado, off
to dinner or drinks, or bed.

00:32:51.430 --> 00:32:53.230
So, thank you all so much.

00:32:53.230 --> 00:32:56.920

00:32:56.920 --> 00:33:00.570
