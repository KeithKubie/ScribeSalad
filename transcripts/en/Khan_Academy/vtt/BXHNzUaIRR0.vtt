00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.880
We're asked to evaluate
the expression a squared

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:11.860
plus 10b minus 8 when a is
equal to 7 and b is equal to 4.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.800
So to evaluate the
expression, we really just

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.620
have to substitute a with 7 and
substitute b with negative 4

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.090
because they're saying evaluate
it when a is equal to 7

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.610
and b is equal to negative 4.

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.940
So let's do that.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.860
So a everywhere we see
an a in the expression,

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.930
we should put a 7 there.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.920
So instead of a squared, we
should write 7 squared plus--

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.170
I'll do it in that same
color-- plus 10 times b.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.030
But instead of a b
there, we are now

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.110
going to substitute it with
b is equal to negative 4.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.610
So 10 times negative 4 instead
of the b right over there.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.120
And then we have the minus 8.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.770
And now we just have
to evaluate this thing.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.780
7 squared is 49.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.110
And then 10 times negative 4.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.180
Remember, order of
operations, multiplication

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:08.480
comes before addition.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.960
So we have to multiply this.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.990
10 times negative
4 is negative 40.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.670
So it's negative 40.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.410
And then we have minus
8 back over here.

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:24.030
And so we get 49
plus negative 40,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.560
which is really the same
thing as 49 minus 40

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.030
is going to be 9.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.220
And then we're going to
subtract 8 from that.

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.340
And so we get 1.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.450
49 minus 40 is 9 minus 8 is 1.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.710
And we are done.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.630
We've evaluated the expression
when a is equal to 7

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.520
and b is equal to negative 4.
