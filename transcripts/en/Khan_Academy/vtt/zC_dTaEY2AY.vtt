00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.290
Let's say we've got the
function, f of x is equal

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.780
to the natural log of x
to the fourth plus 27.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.060
And all we want to do is take
its first and second

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:15.200
derivatives, and use as much of
our techniques as we have at

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.320
our disposal to attempt
to graph it without a

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.210
graphing calculator.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.560
If we have time, I'll take out
the graphing calculator and

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.810
see if our answer matches up.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.300
So a good place to start
is to take the first

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.420
derivative of this.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.040
So let me do that over here.

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:31.670
So the derivative of f.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.870
Well, you take the derivative
of the inside, so take the

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.900
derivative of that right there,
which is 4x to the third, and

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.960
then multiply it times the
derivative of the outside,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.400
with respect to the inside.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.940
So the derivative of the
natural log of x is 1over x.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.580
So the derivative of this whole
thing with respect to this

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.040
inside expression is going
to be, so times 1 over x

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.220
to the fourth plus 27.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.660
If you found that confusing,
you might want to rewatch

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.460
the chain rule videos.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.290
But that's the first
derivative of our function.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:10.670
I could rewrite this, this is
equal to 4x to the third over

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.850
x to the fourth, plus 27.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.400
Or I could write it as 4x to
the third times x to the

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.000
fourth, plus 27 to
the negative 1.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.130
All three of these
expressions are equivalent.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.950
I'm just the writing, I
multiplied it out, or I could

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.670
write this as a negative
exponent, or I could write

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.870
this as a fraction, with
this in the denominator.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.740
They're all the equivalent.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:31.620
So that's our first derivative.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.060
Let's do our second derivative.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.990
Our second derivative,
this looks like it'll get

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.470
a little bit hairier.

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.220
So our second derivative is
the derivative of this.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.590
So it's equal to, we can now
use the product rule, is the

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.760
derivative of this first
expression, times the

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:49.590
second expression.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.260
So the derivative of this first
expression, 3 times 4is 12.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:58.450
12x squared, right, we just
decrement the 3 by 1, times the

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:06.280
second expression, times x to
the fourth plus 27 to the minus

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.380
1, and then to that, we want to
add just the first expression,

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.900
not its derivative, so just 4x
to the third, times

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.305
the derivative of the
second expression.

00:02:17.305 --> 00:02:19.380
And the derivative of the
second expression, we could

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.940
take the derivative of the
inside, which is just 4x to the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.690
third, the derivative of 27 is
just 0, so times 4x to the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.670
third, times the derivative
of this whole thing with

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.790
respect to the inside.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.650
So times, so you take this
exponent, put out front, so

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.290
times minus 1, times this whole
thing, x to the fourth plus

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.930
27 to the, we decrement this
by one more, so minus two.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:53.420
So let's see if I can simplify
this expression a little bit.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.590
So this is equal to, so this
right here is equal to 12x

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:07.400
squared over this thing, x to
the fourth plus 27, and then,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.220
let's see, if we multiply we're
going to have a minus here, so

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.400
it's a minus, you multiply
these two guys, 4 times 4is 16,

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.660
16x to the third times x to the
third is x to the sixth,

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.380
over this thing squared.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.620
Over x to the fourth
plus 27 squared.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.600
That's just another way to
rewrite that expression

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.380
right there, right?

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.810
To the minus 2, you just put in
the denominator and make it

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.150
into a positive 2 in
the denominator.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.610
Same thing.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.860
Now, if you've seen these
problems in the past, we

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.480
always want to set these
things equal to 0.

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.090
We want to solve
for x equals 0.

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.750
So it'll be useful to have this
expressed as just one fraction,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.460
instead of the difference or
the sum of two fractions.

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.880
So what we can do, is we could
have a common denominator.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.170
So we could multiply both the
numerator and denominator of

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.830
this expression by x to the
fourth plus 27, and

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.290
what do we get?

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.830
So this is equal to, so if we
multiply this first expression,

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:06.730
times x to the fourth plus 27,
we get 12x squared, times

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.290
x to the fourth, plus 27.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.340
And then in the denominator,
you have x to the

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.830
fourth plus 27 squared.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.220
All I did, I multiplied this
numerator and this denominator

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.610
by x to the the fourth plus 27.

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:20.610
I didn't change it.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.600
And then we have
that second term.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:30.310
Minus 16 x to the sixth over x
to the fourth plus 27 squared.

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.020
The whole reason why did that?

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.740
Now I have a common
denominator, now I can

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.250
just add the numerators.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:40.230
So this is going to be
equal to, let's see.

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.360
The denominator, we know what
the denominator is, it is x to

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.410
the fourth plus 27 squared.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:49.330
That's our denominator.

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.480
And then we can
multiply this out.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.580
This is 12x squared
times x to the fourth.

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:59.040
That's 12x to the sixth,
plus 27 times 12.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.150
I don't even feel like
multiplying 27 times 12,so

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.060
I'll just write that out.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:09.300
So plus 27 times 12x squared, I
just multiplied the 12x squared

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.570
times the 27, and then minus
16x to the sixth minus

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.430
16x to the sixth.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:20.000
And this simplifies to,
let's see if I can simplify

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.240
this even further.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.050
7x to the sixth here,
x to the sixth here.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.720
So this is equal to,
do this in pink.

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.220
This is equal to the 27 times
12x squared, I don't feel like

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.970
figuring that out right now,
times 12x squared, and then you

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.140
have minus 16x to the sixth
and plus 12x to the sixth.

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:41.600
So you add those two,
you get minus 4.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:48.900
12 minus 15is minus 4, x to the
sixth, all of that over x to

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:57.160
the fourth plus 27
plus 27 squared.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.000
And that is our
second derivative.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.190
Now, we've done all of the
derivatives, and this was

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.800
actually a pretty
hairy problem.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.860
And now we can solve for when
the first and the second

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.305
derivatives equal 0, and we'll
have our candidate, well, we'll

00:06:10.305 --> 00:06:12.810
know our critical points, and
then we'll have our candidate

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.780
inflection points, and
see if we can make any

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.630
headway from there.

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:18.940
So first, let's see where our
first derivative is equal to 0,

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:20.240
and get our critical points.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.680
Or at least maybe, also
maybe, where it's undefined.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.330
So this is equal to 0.

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.520
If we want to set, if the only
place that this can equal to 0

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.740
is if this numerator
is equal to 0.

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.490
This denominator, actually, if
we are assuming we're dealing

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.490
with real numbers, this term
right here is always going to

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.130
be greater than or equal to 0
for any value of x, because

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:42.490
it's an even exponent.

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.790
So this thing can never equals
0, right, because you're

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:47.410
adding 27 to something
that's non-negative.

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:49.540
So this will never equal
0, so this will also

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:50.850
never be undefined.

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:54.890
So there's no undefined
critical points here, but

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:58.550
we could set the numerator
equal to 0 pretty easily.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:02.060
If we wanted to set this equal
to 0, we just say 4x to the

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.900
third is equal to 0, and we
know what x-value will make

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:08.280
that equal to 0, x has
to be equal to 0.

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.230
4 times something to the
third is equal to 0, that

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:11.760
something has to be 0.

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.770
x to the third has to
be 0, x has to be 0.

00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:19.590
So we can write, f prime
of 0 is equal to 0.

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.350
So 0 is a critical point.

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:23.970
0 is a critical point.

00:07:26.940 --> 00:07:29.190
The slope at 0 is 0.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:32.060
We don't know if it's a
maximum or a minimum, or

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.380
an inflection point yet.

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:37.785
We'll explore it a
little bit more.

00:07:37.785 --> 00:07:39.310
And actually, just so
we get the coordinate,

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.380
what's the coordinate?

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:45.150
The coordinate x is 0, and then
y is the natural log-- if x is

00:07:45.150 --> 00:07:49.620
0, this just turns out, it's
the a natural log of 27.

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.880
Let me figure out what that is,
I'll get the calculator out.

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.740
I said I wouldn't use a
graphing calculator, but I can

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:54.910
use a regular calculator.

00:07:54.910 --> 00:07:59.870
So27, if I were to take the
natural log of that, for

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.420
our purposes let's
just call it 3.3.

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.760
We're just trying to get the
general shape of the graph.

00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:04.190
So 3.3.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:11.050
Well, we could just say
2.9 and it kept going.

00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:13.020
So this is a critical
point right here.

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.210
The slope is 0 here.

00:08:15.210 --> 00:08:20.260
Slope is equal to 0
at x is equal to 0.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.110
So this is one thing
we want to block off.

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:23.930
And let's see if we can
find any candidate

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:25.170
inflection points.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:27.910
And remember, candidate
inflection points are where the

00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:29.510
second derivative equals 0.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.040
Now if the second derivative
equals 0, that doesn't tell

00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.790
us that those are definitely
inflection points.

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.910
Let me make this very clear.

00:08:35.910 --> 00:08:39.520
If, let me do it
in a new color.

00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:52.160
If x is inflection, then the
second derivative at x is

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:54.090
going to be equal to 0.

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:58.910
Because you're having
a change concavity.

00:08:58.910 --> 00:09:02.830
You have a change in the slope,
goes from either increasing

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:05.340
to decreasing or from
decreasing to increasing.

00:09:05.340 --> 00:09:09.350
But if the derivative is equal
to 0, the second derivative is

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:11.900
equal to 0, you cannot assume
that is an inflection point.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.390
So what we're going to do is,
we're going to find all of the

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:19.140
point at which this is true,
and then see if we actually do

00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:22.230
have a sign change in the
second derivative of that

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:25.280
point, and only if you have a
sign change, then you can say

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.550
it's an inflection point.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.170
So let's see if we can do that.

00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:30.220
So just because a second
derivative is 0, that by

00:09:30.220 --> 00:09:32.550
itself does not tell you
it's an inflection point.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:36.210
It has to have a second
derivative of 0, and when you

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:40.190
go above or below that x, the
second derivative has to

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.500
actually change signs.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.140
Only then.

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:54.170
So we can say, if f prime
changes signs around x,

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:56.890
then we can say that
x is an inflection.

00:10:00.226 --> 00:10:03.070
And if it's changing signs
around x, then it's definitely

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:06.470
going to be 0 right at x, but
you have to actually see that

00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.350
if it's negative before x, has
to be positive after x,or if

00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:11.737
it's positive before x, has
to be negative after x.

00:10:11.737 --> 00:10:13.270
So let's test that out.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:15.610
So the first thing we
need to do is find

00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:16.490
these candidate points.

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.430
Remember, the candidate
points are where the second

00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:21.160
derivative is equal to 0.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:23.570
We're going to find those
points, and then see if this

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:25.670
is true, that the sign
actually changes.

00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:29.750
We want to find where this
thing over here is equal to 0.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.450
And once again, for this to
be equal to 0, the numerator

00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:33.390
has to be equal to 0.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:36.200
This denominator can never be
equal to 0 if we're dealing

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.570
with real numbers, which I
think is a fair assumption.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:43.450
So let's see where this our
numerator can be equal to 0

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:45.650
for the second derivative.

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:48.610
So let's set the numerator
of the second derivative.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:54.900
27 times 12x squared minus 4x
to the sixth is equal to 0.

00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:56.210
Remember, that's just
the numerator of our

00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:57.250
second derivative.

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:59.360
Any x that makes the
numerator 0 is making

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.580
the second derivative 0.

00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:06.500
So let's factor
out a 4x squared.

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:09.060
So 4x squared.

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:14.140
Now we'll have 27 times, if we
factor 4 out of the 12, we'll

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:17.900
just get a 3, and we factored
out the x squared, minus, we

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.120
factored out the 4, we factored
out an x squared, so we have x

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.580
to the fourth is equal to 0.

00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:29.480
So the x's that will make this
equal to 0 will satisfy either,

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:35.180
I'll switch colors, either 4x
squared is equal to 0, or, now

00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.060
27 times 3, I can do
that in my head.

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:38.170
That's 81.

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:43.060
20 times 3 is 60, 7 times
3 is 21, 60 plus 21is 81.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:48.920
Or 81 minus x to the
fourth is equal to 0.

00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:51.410
Any x that satisfies either
of these will make this

00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:52.700
entire expression equal 0.

00:11:52.700 --> 00:11:54.180
Because if this thing is
0, the whole thing is

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:54.755
going to be equal to 0.

00:11:54.755 --> 00:11:56.750
If this thing is 0, the
whole thing is going

00:11:56.750 --> 00:11:57.445
to be equal to 0.

00:11:57.445 --> 00:11:59.640
Let me be clear, this
is 81 right there.

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.760
So let's solve this.

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:07.460
This is going to be 0 when
x is equal to 0, itself.

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:10.560
This is going to be equal
to 0 when x, let's see.

00:12:10.560 --> 00:12:12.590
If we add x to the fourth to
both sides, you get x to

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:15.060
the fourth is equal to 81.

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:18.070
If we take the square root of
both sides of this, you get x

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:23.090
squared is equal to 9, or so
you get x is plus or minus 3.

00:12:23.090 --> 00:12:29.590
x is equal to plus
or minus three.

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:32.640
So these are our candidate
inflection points, x is equal

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:36.770
to 0, x is equal to plus 3,
or x is equal to minus 3.

00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.150
So what we have to do now, is
to see whether the second

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.360
derivative changes signs around
these points in order to be

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.710
able to label them
inflection points.

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:49.130
So what happens when x
is slightly below 0?

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:52.290
So let's take the situation,
let's do all the scenarios.

00:12:52.290 --> 00:12:54.720
What happens when x
is slightly below 0?

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:58.620
Not all of them, necessarily,
but if x is like 0.1.

00:12:58.620 --> 00:13:01.490
What is the second derivative
going to be doing?

00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:07.230
If x is 0.1, or if x is minus
0.1, this term right here is

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:12.080
going to be positive, and
then this is going to be 81

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.990
minus 0.1 to the fourth.

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.890
So that's going to be a
very small number, right?

00:13:16.890 --> 00:13:19.520
So it's going to be some
positive number times 81

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:20.530
minus a small number.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.300
So it's going to be
a positive number.

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:26.930
So when x is less than 0, or
just slightly less than 0, our

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:31.740
second derivative is positive.

00:13:31.740 --> 00:13:34.520
Now what happens when
x is slightly larger?

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.320
When I write this notation, I
want to be careful, I mean,

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.960
really, just right below 0.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.030
Now when x is right
above 0, what happens?

00:13:43.030 --> 00:13:47.040
Let's say x was 0.01,
or 0.1, positive 0.1.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.180
Well, it's going to
be the same thing.

00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:49.830
Because in both cases,
we're squaring, and

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:50.760
we're taking the fourth.

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.850
So you're kind of losing
your sign information.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:57.290
So if x is 0.1, this thing
is going to be a small

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.470
positive number.

00:13:58.470 --> 00:14:00.850
You're going to be subtracting
a very small positive number

00:14:00.850 --> 00:14:05.060
from 81, but 81 minus a small
number is still going

00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:05.920
to be positive.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.810
So you're going to positive
times a positive, so your

00:14:09.810 --> 00:14:13.530
second derivative is still
going to be greater than 0.

00:14:13.530 --> 00:14:15.430
So something interesting here.

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:20.940
f at your second derivative is
0 when x is equal to 0, but it

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:22.980
is a not an inflection point.

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:29.230
Because notice, the concavity
did not change around 0.

00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:32.810
Our second derivative is
positive as we approach 0 from

00:14:32.810 --> 00:14:36.290
the left, and it's positive as
we approach 0 from the right.

00:14:36.290 --> 00:14:41.340
So in general, at 0, we're
always, as we're near 0 from

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:44.040
either direction, we're going
to be concave upwards.

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:48.820
So the fact that 0 is a
critical point, and that we're

00:14:48.820 --> 00:14:52.600
always concave upward, as we
approach 0 from either side,

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.690
this tells us that this
is a minimum point.

00:15:00.760 --> 00:15:04.600
Because we're concave
upwards all around 0.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.160
So 0 is not an
inflection point.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.490
Let's see if positive
and negative 3 are

00:15:09.490 --> 00:15:11.270
inflection points.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:14.520
And if you study this
equation, let me write

00:15:14.520 --> 00:15:17.480
our-- and actually, I
just want to be clear.

00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:19.050
I've just been using
the numerator of the

00:15:19.050 --> 00:15:20.270
second derivative.

00:15:20.270 --> 00:15:23.880
The whole second derivative is
this thing right here, but I've

00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:25.800
been ignoring the denominator
because the denominator

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:27.340
is always positive.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:29.140
So if we're trying to
understand whether things are

00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.980
positive or negative, we just
really have to determine

00:15:30.980 --> 00:15:33.000
whether the numerator is
positive or negative.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.430
Because this expression right
there is always positive.

00:15:35.430 --> 00:15:38.930
It's something to
the second power.

00:15:38.930 --> 00:15:43.200
So let's test whether we have a
change in concavity around x is

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:45.610
equal to positive
or negative 3.

00:15:45.610 --> 00:15:48.450
So remember, the numerator of
our, let me just rewrite our

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:50.850
second derivative, just so
you see it here. f

00:15:50.850 --> 00:15:52.180
prime prime of x.

00:15:52.180 --> 00:15:54.170
The numerator is this
thing right here.

00:15:54.170 --> 00:16:00.330
It's 4x squared times 81
minus x to the fourth.

00:16:00.330 --> 00:16:03.050
and the denominator
was up here, x to the

00:16:03.050 --> 00:16:04.430
fourth plus 27 squared.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.120
That was our second derivative.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.270
Let's see if this changes signs
around positive or negative 3.

00:16:16.270 --> 00:16:19.940
And actually, we should get the
same answer, because regardless

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.440
of whether we put positive
or negative 3 here.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:24.360
you lose all your sign
information because you're

00:16:24.360 --> 00:16:25.835
taking it to the fourth
power, you're taking it

00:16:25.835 --> 00:16:26.630
to the second power.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.850
And obviously, anything to the
fourth power is always going to

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.990
be positive, anything to the
second power is always

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:31.710
going to be negative.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.170
So when we do our test, if it's
true for positive 3, it's

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.950
probably going to be true
for negative 3 as well.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.540
But let's just try it out.

00:16:39.540 --> 00:16:44.960
So when x is just a little bit
less than positive 3, what's

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.820
the sign of f prime prime of x?

00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.970
So it's going to be 4 times
9, or it's going to be 4

00:16:51.970 --> 00:16:53.880
times a positive number.

00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.930
It might be like 2.999,
but this is still

00:16:55.930 --> 00:16:57.420
going to be positive.

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:01.540
So this is going to be positive
when x is approaching 3, and

00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:05.360
then this is going to be, well,
if x is 3, this is 0, so x is

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:07.420
a little bit less than 3.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.390
If x is a little bit less than
3, if it's like 2.9999, this

00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:14.120
number is going to be less
than 81, so this is also

00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:15.460
going to be positive.

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:17.860
And of course, the denominator
is always positive.

00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:21.490
So as x is less than 3, is
approaching from the left,

00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:22.760
we are concave upwards.

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:24.650
This thing's going
to be a positive.

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:27.610
Then f prime prime
is greater than 0.

00:17:27.610 --> 00:17:31.380
We are upwards,
concave upwards.

00:17:31.380 --> 00:17:35.230
When x is just larger than
3, what's going to happen?

00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:37.820
Well, this first term is
still going to be positive.

00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:41.220
But if x is just larger than 3,
x to the fourth is going to be

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:44.720
just larger than 81, and so
this second term is going to be

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.130
negative in that situation.

00:17:48.676 --> 00:17:51.150
Let me do it ina new color.

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:53.910
It's going to be negative
when x is larger than 3.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.360
Because this is going
to be larger than 81.

00:17:56.360 --> 00:17:59.230
So if this is negative and this
is positive, then the whole

00:17:59.230 --> 00:18:00.980
thing is going to be negative,
because this denominator is

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:02.440
still going to be positive.

00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.251
So then f prime prime is going
to be less than 0, so we're

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:09.290
going to be concave downwards.

00:18:09.290 --> 00:18:10.700
One last one.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:16.280
What happens when x is just
a greater than minus 3?

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:19.470
So just being greater
than minus 3, that's

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:22.940
like minus 2.99999.

00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.280
So when you take minus 2.99
square it, you're going to get

00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:27.760
a positive number, so this
is going to be positive.

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.010
And if you take minus 2.99 to
the fourth, that's going to be

00:18:31.010 --> 00:18:32.640
a little bit less
than 81, right?

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:35.130
Because 2.99 to the fourth is a
little bit less than 81, so

00:18:35.130 --> 00:18:37.030
this is still going
to be positive.

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:39.920
So you have a positive times a
positive divided by a positive,

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:43.120
so you're going to be concave
upwards, because your second

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.090
derivative is going to
be greater than 0.

00:18:45.090 --> 00:18:47.740
Concave upwards.

00:18:47.740 --> 00:18:52.000
And then finally, when x is
just, just less than negative

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.100
3, remember, when I write this
down, I don't mean for all x's

00:18:55.100 --> 00:18:58.770
larger than negative 3,or all
x's smaller than negative 3.

00:18:58.770 --> 00:19:01.130
There's actually no, well, I
can't think of the notation

00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:04.910
that would say just, as we just
approach three in this case,

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:09.120
from the left, but what happens
if we just go to minus 3.11?

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.570
Or 3.01, I guess is a
better one, or 3.1?

00:19:12.570 --> 00:19:15.040
Well, this term right here
is going to be positive.

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:19.320
But if we take minus 3.1 to the
fourth, that's going to be

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:21.760
larger than positive 81, right?

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:24.080
The sign will become positive,
it'll be larger than 81, so

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.210
this'll become negative.

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:28.540
So in that case as well, we'll
have a positive times a

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:32.410
negative divided by a positive,
so then our second derivative

00:19:32.410 --> 00:19:34.100
is going to be negative.

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.830
And so we're going
to be downwards.

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:42.060
So I think we're ready to plot.
so first of all, is x plus or

00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:43.120
minus 3 inflection points?

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:43.870
Sure!

00:19:43.870 --> 00:19:47.800
As we approach x is equal to 3
from the left, we are concave

00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:52.810
upwards, and then as we cross
3, the second derivative is 0.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:54.550
The second derivative's
0, I lost it up here.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:57.880
The second derivative is 0.

00:19:57.880 --> 00:20:00.590
And then, as we go to the
right of 3, we become

00:20:00.590 --> 00:20:01.400
concave downwards.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:04.050
So we got our sign change
in the second derivative.

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.000
So x is equal to 3.

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.610
So 3 is definitely an
inflection point, and the

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:10.390
same argument could be
made for negative 3.

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.770
We switch signs as we cross 3.

00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:17.620
So these definitely are
inflection points.

00:20:17.620 --> 00:20:19.920
Just so we get the exact
coordinates, let's figure out

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:24.050
what f of 3 is, or f of
positive and negative 3.

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:25.840
And then we're ready to graph.

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.110
So first of all, we know that
f, we know that the point 0,

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:34.880
3.29, that this was a minimum.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.870
Because 0 was a critical
point, the slope is 0 there,

00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:41.000
and because it's concave
upwards all around 0.

00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:43.230
So 0 is definitely not
an inflection point.

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.970
And then we know that the
points positive 3 and minus 3

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.210
are inflection points, and in
order to figure out their

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:53.110
y-coordinates, we can
just evaluate them.

00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:54.950
So they're actually going to
have the same y-coordinates,

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:57.680
because if you put a minus3 or
positive 3 and take it to the

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:59.010
fourth power, you're going
to get the same thing.

00:20:59.010 --> 00:21:01.090
Let's figure out what they are.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:04.770
So if we take 3 to the fourth
power, that's what, 81.

00:21:04.770 --> 00:21:09.990
81 plus 27 is equal to 108,
and then we want to take

00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:11.160
the natural log of it.

00:21:14.730 --> 00:21:17.130
Let's just say 4.7, just
to get a rough idea.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:18.780
That's4.7.

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:20.920
And that's true of whether we
do positive or negative 3,

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:22.300
because we took to
the fourth power.

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:27.720
So it's 4.7, 4.7.

00:21:27.720 --> 00:21:31.240
These are both
inflection points.

00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.570
And we should be
ready to graph it!

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:35.250
Let's graph it.

00:21:35.250 --> 00:21:35.790
All right.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:42.090
Let me draw my axis,
just like that.

00:21:42.090 --> 00:21:46.840
And this is my y-axis, this
is my x-axis, this is y.

00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:49.740
You can even call it the f
of x axis, if you like.

00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:50.820
This is x.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:53.750
And so the point 0, 3.29.

00:21:53.750 --> 00:22:01.210
Let's say this is 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, to the point 0, 3.29.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.290
That's 0, 1, 2, 3, a little bit
above 3, it's right there.

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:06.950
That's the minimum point.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:08.550
And then we're concave.

00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:12.230
The slope is 0 right there, we
figured that out, because the

00:22:12.230 --> 00:22:13.360
first derivative was 0 there.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.950
So it's a critical
point, and it's concave

00:22:14.950 --> 00:22:15.710
upwards around there.

00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:19.510
So that told us we arepoint at
a minimum point, right there.

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.430
And then at positive 3.

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:24.400
So 1, 2, 3.

00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:26.950
At positive 3, 4.7.

00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:30.890
So 4.7 will look
something like that.

00:22:30.890 --> 00:22:32.660
We have an inflection point.

00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:36.700
Before that, we're concave
upwards, and then after that

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:37.460
we're concave downwards.

00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:39.600
So it looks something
like this.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:42.520
So we're concave upwards
up with up to that point.

00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:45.820
Maybe, actually, you should,
let me ignore that yellow

00:22:45.820 --> 00:22:47.550
thing I drew before.

00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.550
Let me get rid of that.

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:52.930
Let me draw it like 1, 2, 3.

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:59.040
3, 4.7 looks like that, and
minus 3, 4.7, 1, 2, 3,

00:22:59.040 --> 00:23:01.290
4.7 looks like that.

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:07.200
So we know at 0, we are slope
of 0 and we're concave upwards,

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.140
so we look like this.

00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:12.320
We're concave upwards,
until x is equal to 3.

00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:17.690
And at x is equal to 3, we
become concave downwards, and

00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:22.300
we go, let me try my best to
draw it well, and we

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:23.800
go off like that.

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:28.170
And then we're concave upwards
around 0, until we get, we're

00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:32.290
concave upwards as long as x is
greater than minus 3, and

00:23:32.290 --> 00:23:34.440
then at minus 3 we become
concave downwards again.

00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.620
Maybe I should do
it in that color.

00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:40.010
This concave downwards right
here, that's this, right here.

00:23:40.010 --> 00:23:41.720
That's that, right there.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:45.340
And this concave downwards,
right here-- sorry, I meant

00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:48.440
to do it in the red color--
this concave downwards right

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:51.440
here, is this, right there.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:54.490
And then the concave upwards
around 0 is right there.

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:57.080
You could even imagine, this
concave upwards that we

00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.660
measured, that's this, concave
upwards, and then this

00:23:59.660 --> 00:24:01.580
concave upwards is that.

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.700
And then around 0,
we're always upwards.

00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:07.340
So this is my sense of what the
graph will look like and maybe

00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:10.050
it'll just you know it turns
into well you could think about

00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:13.420
what it does is x approaches
positive or negative infinity,

00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:15.230
some of the terms, well,
I won't go into that.

00:24:15.230 --> 00:24:18.430
But let's test whether we've
grafted correctly using

00:24:18.430 --> 00:24:19.570
a graphing calculator.

00:24:19.570 --> 00:24:25.150
So let me get out my TI-85,
trusty TI-85, and let's

00:24:25.150 --> 00:24:26.480
graph this sucker.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:28.290
All right, press graph.

00:24:28.290 --> 00:24:38.830
y equals the natural log of
x to the fourth plus 27.

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.660
All right, I want to
hit that graph there.

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:43.650
So I do second, graph.

00:24:43.650 --> 00:24:45.760
And let's cross our fingers.

00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.380
It looks pretty good!

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:49.770
It looks almost exactly
like what we drew.

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:53.680
So I think our I think our
mathematics was correct.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.650
This was actually
very satisfying.

00:24:55.650 --> 00:24:59.060
So hopefully you appreciate the
usefulness of inflection

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:02.810
points, and second derivative,
and first derivative, in

00:25:02.810 --> 00:25:06.860
graphing some of
these functions.
