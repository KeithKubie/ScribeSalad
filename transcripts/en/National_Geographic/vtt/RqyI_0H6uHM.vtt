Lee:<i> Extraordinary people doing
 extraordinary things.</i>

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:11.678
<i> By the end of
 a 21-day excavation</i>

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:15.281
<i> we had discovered the
richest early Hominid site</i>

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.517
<i> ever discovered in the
 history of the planet.</i>

00:00:18.384 --> 00:00:22.755 line:0%
This site is one mile away
from the site of Sterkfontein.

00:00:23.256 --> 00:00:25.290
It's less than
half that distance

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.460
from the second best known site

00:00:27.827 --> 00:00:30.596
in the entire
continent of Africa

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:34.434 line:0%
the site of Swartkrans,
800 meters away.

00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:36.536 line:0%
It was right under our nose.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.406
<i> It was an incredible
 environment of science.</i>

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:42.509
<i>There, we had a fossil tent</i>

00:00:42.509 --> 00:00:45.177
<i>where we kept joking that
 we need a bigger safe</i>

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:47.146
<i>and we had to buy more boxes</i>

00:00:47.146 --> 00:00:49.015
<i> and more bags than
 we ever envisioned.</i>

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:53.018
<i> We'd set up a thing to
 find a skeleton</i>

00:00:53.018 --> 00:00:56.322
<i> and we had, first,
 hundreds of remains</i>

00:00:56.322 --> 00:01:00.459
<i>and by the end of it, thousands
 of remains of hominids.</i>

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.962
<i> We would work late
 into the night.</i>

00:01:02.962 --> 00:01:06.632
<i>I, sometimes couldn't get the
scientists out of the cave</i>

00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:10.069
<i> as they excavated for
shifts of six or seven hours</i>

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.139
<i> in these cramped,
 humid conditions.</i>

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:14.440
And no one could
go get them anyway

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.309
so they could just stay there
as long as they wanted.

00:01:16.309 --> 00:01:17.643
( audience laughter )

00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:23.983
Some people have said, "Well, it
really isn't that dangerous."

00:01:23.983 --> 00:01:26.519
<i>Rick is going to demonstrate
 to you, though that</i>

00:01:26.519 --> 00:01:29.055
<i> just because we
 did not kill anyone</i>

00:01:29.856 --> 00:01:32.892
<i> that this is
 every bit as dangerous</i>

00:01:32.892 --> 00:01:37.063
<i> and extraordinary a risk
as has ever been undertaken.</i>

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:40.499
<i> These are the easy parts
 you're looking at.</i>

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:43.769
<i>This was an original thing
we called "Superman Crawl"</i>

00:01:43.769 --> 00:01:45.204
<i> which you go through.</i>

00:01:45.204 --> 00:01:47.040
<i> I can get through that.</i>

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.609
<i> So, that's not a
particularly tight squeeze</i>

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:53.879
<i> in the scheme of what
 we're doing here.</i>

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:56.615
<i> For those of you who are
squeamish about closed spaces</i>

00:01:56.615 --> 00:01:59.152
<i> you may look away,
 because it gets worse.</i>

00:02:00.552 --> 00:02:05.157
<i>This is the type of journey that
these remarkable scientists</i>

00:02:05.157 --> 00:02:07.593
<i> the runners,
the people who assisted us</i>

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:10.562
<i>would take on a daily basis</i>

00:02:10.562 --> 00:02:14.634
<i> usually three, four,
 five times a day,</i>

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.636
<i> getting to these sites.</i>

00:02:16.636 --> 00:02:18.404
<i> Some people said to me</i>

00:02:18.404 --> 00:02:20.873
<i> "Why haven't you
 opened this cave up?"</i>

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:24.443
<i>I hope you can begin to see,
how fragile this cave is.</i>

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:25.678
<i> You do not want to do</i>

00:02:25.678 --> 00:02:28.481
<i> any opening of caves
 in that environment</i>

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:30.950
<i>because if you do, you may
destabilize the entire system</i>

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.984
<i> and it could collapse.</i>

00:02:31.984 --> 00:02:34.720
<i> And secondly, I didn't
 want to do that.</i>

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.489
<i> Who was it for me
 to destroy a cave</i>

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.125
<i> that's potentially
 millions of years old</i>

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:42.127
<i>just so it could be large enough
that my ego could get in there</i>

00:02:42.127 --> 00:02:45.431
<i> when there is technology
 and extraordinary people</i>

00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:49.201
<i> who have the capability
of doing that work today.</i>

00:02:49.702 --> 00:02:52.738
<i>Here, this is kind of a normal,
 narrow passage.</i>

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:55.908
<i>You're going to see the chute
 and parts of it here.</i>

00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:57.577
<i> And you'll get an
 idea of the depth</i>

00:02:57.577 --> 00:03:01.513
<i>as you see Steve Tucker's
 light in the distance</i>

00:03:01.513 --> 00:03:03.549
<i>as we look down into the chute</i>

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.585
<i>and you get an idea of how
 narrow those spaces are</i>

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:09.088
<i>that they are traversing down.</i>

00:03:09.555 --> 00:03:12.157
<i> You'll see how dangerous
some of those loose rocks are.</i>

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:14.360
<i> This rock that Rick
 is about to touch</i>

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.230
<i>actually fell on a National
 Geographic Photographer</i>

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.833
<i>and shattered his fingers,
 as he was under there.</i>

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:25.070
<i>Oh and... Rick can dislocate
 his shoulders. Watch.</i>

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:26.472
<i>I just showed you that for fun.</i>

00:03:26.472 --> 00:03:29.609
( audience laughter )

00:03:30.076 --> 00:03:35.715
Extraordinary people doing
extraordinary things.

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:38.985
By the end of a
a 21-day excavation

00:03:38.985 --> 00:03:42.421
we had discovered the
richest early hominid site

00:03:42.421 --> 00:03:44.790
ever discovered in the
history of the planet.

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.594
More fossil hominids had
come out individually

00:03:48.594 --> 00:03:51.864
than had been discovered in
the previous 90 year history

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:54.934
of the search for human
origins in Southern Africa.

00:03:54.934 --> 00:03:57.537
<i> All because of these
 remarkable scientists.</i>

00:03:58.037 --> 00:04:01.040
<i> We would name
a new species, "Homo naledi".</i>

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.309
Homo naledi was an
incredible creature.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:05.811
A brain, the size of an orange

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:08.981
<i> primitive characters and
 advanced characters</i>

00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:13.286
<i>teeth that are remarkable in
being a little bit human-like</i>

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:15.520
<i> and then primitive in
 so many other ways.</i>

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.089
<i>Things we'd never seen before.</i>

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:21.427
We would eventually
find 15 individuals.

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:26.698
One thousand, five hundred
and seventy four fossils.

00:04:26.698 --> 00:04:29.735
From an area,
that big by that big.

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:34.741
The entire floor is
comprised of these fossils.

00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:36.609
We had every age
group represented.

00:04:36.609 --> 00:04:39.912
From near fetal aged infants

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:43.249
to the extreme elderly with
their teeth worn right out

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.785
and everything in between,
males and females.

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:50.422
<i> We had fossils like this
field has never seen before.</i>

00:04:50.422 --> 00:04:52.291
<i>That is the most complete foot</i>

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:54.594
<i>ever discovered in the history
 of paleoanthropology.</i>

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:56.128
<i> One of six.</i>

00:04:56.128 --> 00:04:57.529
<i>This is the most complete hand</i>

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:00.166
<i>ever discovered in the history
 of paleoanthropology.</i>

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.300
<i> One of eight.</i>

00:05:01.667 --> 00:05:04.136
<i>The assemblage was remarkable.</i>

00:05:04.136 --> 00:05:07.406
<i>Remarkable in its diversity,
remarkable in its preservation</i>

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:09.542
<i>remarkable in its quality.</i>

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:13.012
<i> We simply had seen
 nothing like it.</i>

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:17.015
<i> All lying on the floor
 of this chamber.</i>

00:05:17.015 --> 00:05:20.253
We would name a new species,
"Homo naledi".

00:05:20.786 --> 00:05:22.422
It's a crazy creature.

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:24.724
Brain, the size of an
orange, ape-like shoulders

00:05:24.724 --> 00:05:27.960
<i> human-like arms ending
 in a human-like hand</i>

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.229
<i> with the most curved
fingers we have ever seen</i>

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:32.265
<i> outside the most
 primitive hominids.</i>

00:05:32.265 --> 00:05:34.500
<i> Four or five million
 year old equivalents.</i>

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.534
<i> It's bizarre.</i>

00:05:36.135 --> 00:05:40.173
It's thorax, starts ape-like,
becomes more and more advanced.

00:05:40.173 --> 00:05:43.675
It's pelvis is like that
of Lucy, wide and flared.

00:05:44.076 --> 00:05:46.845
So, we know what its
legs and feet look like.

00:05:46.845 --> 00:05:48.780
They should be primitive too

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:52.251
but they are at the top and
become progressively more and

00:05:52.251 --> 00:05:55.754
more and more human-like
until you reach the feet.

00:05:55.754 --> 00:05:58.558
And those are the most
human-like feet ever discovered

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:00.927
since humans.

00:06:02.427 --> 00:06:04.497
Look at the size of that head.

00:06:04.497 --> 00:06:07.800
<i>That is a normal sized, modern
 human in the background.</i>

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.270
<i> That is an adult female
 of Homo naledi.</i>

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:14.006
About 450 cubic centimeters.

00:06:14.573 --> 00:06:18.310
We had truly never seen
anything like this.

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.347
<i>To give you an idea of how
strange they would've looked.</i>

00:06:21.347 --> 00:06:24.984
<i>That's Lucy on the left, in the
middle is a very famous skeleton</i>

00:06:24.984 --> 00:06:27.520
<i> called, "Turkana Boy"
 of Homo Erectus.</i>

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.155
<i> And there, you can see a
relatively human-like visage.</i>

00:06:30.155 --> 00:06:32.425
<i>There on the right, is that
almost, without being derogatory</i>

00:06:32.425 --> 00:06:37.563
<i>pin-headed look of Homo naledi,
with its very strange profile.</i>

00:06:37.563 --> 00:06:39.799
And it is not an aberrancy
because we have

00:06:39.799 --> 00:06:44.503
multiple individuals
and they all look exactly alike.

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:48.006
<i>We now know more about this
remarkable species, perhaps</i>

00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:51.510
<i>than almost any other species
of primitive human relative</i>

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.246
<i>that's ever been discovered.</i>

00:06:54.213 --> 00:06:56.381
<i>We, very quickly realized,
 something was--</i>

00:06:56.381 --> 00:06:58.150
<i> strange going on</i>

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:01.787
<i>with the way in which these
fossils were in that chamber.</i>

00:07:01.787 --> 00:07:03.755
<i> During the course
 of the excavation</i>

00:07:03.755 --> 00:07:05.424
we had found on the first day

00:07:05.424 --> 00:07:09.628
to be transparent,
three bird bones.

00:07:10.162 --> 00:07:12.431
That were owl,
that were lying on the surface.

00:07:12.431 --> 00:07:16.068
They were clearly much younger.
Some owl had got in there.

00:07:16.068 --> 00:07:18.737
And then we found, during the
course of the excavation

00:07:18.737 --> 00:07:22.274
a few, tiny, rodent incisors,
mixed into the sediment.

00:07:22.274 --> 00:07:24.010
And nothing else.

00:07:24.743 --> 00:07:26.512
Nothing but hominids.

00:07:27.413 --> 00:07:28.748
Now, we had on the team

00:07:28.748 --> 00:07:31.517
world experts in many,
many different things.

00:07:31.984 --> 00:07:34.253
But, all of us had the
same basic training

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:36.422
in physical anthropology,
forensic anthropology

00:07:36.422 --> 00:07:38.757
archeology, all related
to human biology.

00:07:38.757 --> 00:07:41.294
And those senior members
of the team knew

00:07:41.294 --> 00:07:43.395
that there was something
very strange from word go

00:07:43.395 --> 00:07:45.598
when you see an
assemblage like that.

00:07:46.165 --> 00:07:49.001
We, of course, began trying
to eliminate the obvious.

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:51.870
It's gotta be a
predator accumulation.

00:07:51.870 --> 00:07:54.640
But there are no predatory--
marks of damage

00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.241
on any of this bone.

00:07:56.241 --> 00:07:58.043
There's no marks of scavenging.

00:07:58.043 --> 00:07:59.645
We knew, very early on

00:07:59.645 --> 00:08:02.781
that the material had not
been transported in.

00:08:02.781 --> 00:08:07.019
There was no sign in the
sediments of water transport.

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:09.555
We also could tell from
the way they were set

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:12.891
that they'd come in one
by one by one, over time.

00:08:12.891 --> 00:08:14.827
There was time involved in this.

00:08:15.728 --> 00:08:17.696
<i> Over on the right hand
 side of this image</i>

00:08:17.696 --> 00:08:19.098
<i> is where that chute is.</i>

00:08:19.098 --> 00:08:22.200
<i>You can see that the floor
 slopes away from that</i>

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.804
<i>and quite literally, from that
point all the way to the end</i>

00:08:25.804 --> 00:08:27.539
<i>are these bones of Homo naledi.</i>

00:08:27.539 --> 00:08:29.508
<i> Literally, from
 underneath the chute.</i>

00:08:29.508 --> 00:08:31.009
We have used, I can tell you

00:08:31.009 --> 00:08:33.111
ground penetrating radar
and other methods.

00:08:33.111 --> 00:08:35.681
We can find no other entrance.

00:08:36.482 --> 00:08:41.386
And we were left, eventually,
with the unlikely conclusion

00:08:41.386 --> 00:08:44.656
<i> that in fact, this
 must be some sort of</i>

00:08:44.656 --> 00:08:47.159
<i>deliberate body disposal site.</i>

00:08:47.159 --> 00:08:48.828
<i>That we had, for the first time</i>

00:08:48.828 --> 00:08:51.564
<i> found a species
 other than humans</i>

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:55.100
that in a ritualized, and
I mean, repeated fashion

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.402
had taken it's dead
into a chamber

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:00.739
and secreted them
there over time to

00:09:00.739 --> 00:09:04.911
prevent whatever from happening
to them for whatever reason.

00:09:05.844 --> 00:09:08.347
And that is the hypothesis
we put forward.

00:09:08.714 --> 00:09:11.250
That's a fairly
remarkable thing.

00:09:12.117 --> 00:09:16.355
Because, until that moment,
on September 10th last year

00:09:16.355 --> 00:09:18.590
when we announced the
existence of Homo naledi

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.225
and this situation...

00:09:20.792 --> 00:09:24.763
we had seen
deliberate body disposal

00:09:24.763 --> 00:09:28.901
as sort of the last bastion of
what identified us as human.

00:09:29.268 --> 00:09:31.536
When Jane Goodall wrote
to Louis Leakey saying

00:09:31.536 --> 00:09:34.941
"I have seen a
chimpanzee using tools."

00:09:35.674 --> 00:09:37.442
He said, prophetically

00:09:37.442 --> 00:09:40.379
"We're going to have to redefine
what it means to be human."

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:43.615
We had precious little left
until September 10th

00:09:43.615 --> 00:09:46.786
except, we deliberately
disposed of our dead

00:09:47.486 --> 00:09:49.255
and whatever that means.

00:09:50.222 --> 00:09:53.258
And should this
hypothesis hold true

00:09:53.258 --> 00:09:55.027
for the first time in history

00:09:55.027 --> 00:09:59.364
<i> you are meeting another
species that did just that.</i>

00:09:59.364 --> 00:10:01.800
<i> What these discoveries
 tell you is that</i>

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.804
<i>we may have walked or set
foot over most of this planet</i>

00:10:04.804 --> 00:10:08.441
<i> but we have not seen
 what we were walking on.</i>

00:10:09.541 --> 00:10:13.145
We've not understood
what we were looking at.

00:10:13.846 --> 00:10:17.817
There are extraordinary
things to be found.

00:10:18.684 --> 00:10:22.621
And if it is true in a field

00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:24.590
like paleoanthropology

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:29.528
then it must be true in
every field of science.

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:32.431
We need to use
discoveries like this

00:10:32.431 --> 00:10:39.170
to inspire this and the next
generation to be explorers.

00:10:39.437 --> 00:10:42.141
To get out in the field.

00:10:42.875 --> 00:10:47.179
To look, to prepare yourself
to make discoveries

00:10:47.179 --> 00:10:50.215
to use the technology
to inform you,

00:10:50.215 --> 00:10:53.886
but to physically go out and
make those discoveries.

00:10:54.186 --> 00:10:58.056
We need, ladies and gentlemen,

00:10:58.056 --> 00:11:01.327
to inspire exploration.

00:11:02.361 --> 00:11:03.729
Thank you very much.

00:11:03.729 --> 00:11:08.167
