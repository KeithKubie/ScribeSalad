00:00:06.272 --> 00:00:08.272
(piano)

00:00:09.627 --> 00:00:12.464
- [Narrator] We are the paradoxical ape.

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:14.964
Bipedal, naked, large brained.

00:00:17.648 --> 00:00:21.770
Long the master of fire,
tools and language.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.187
But still trying to understand ourselves.

00:00:26.056 --> 00:00:30.223
Aware that death is inevitable,
yet filled with optimism.

00:00:32.772 --> 00:00:36.272
We grow up slowly, we hand down knowledge,

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:39.684
we empathize and deceive.

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:42.095
We shape the future from our

00:00:42.095 --> 00:00:44.845
shared understanding of the past.

00:00:46.536 --> 00:00:48.226
Carta brings together experts from

00:00:48.226 --> 00:00:51.240
diverse disciplines to exchange insights

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.073
on who we are and how we got here.

00:00:56.401 --> 00:00:57.783
An exploration made possible by

00:00:57.783 --> 00:01:00.616
the generosity of humans like you.

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.062
(techno music)

00:01:41.688 --> 00:01:42.720
- Thanks very much for the opportunity

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.223
to come and talk with you today.

00:01:45.223 --> 00:01:47.768
I'm going to speak about
our work on how crows

00:01:47.768 --> 00:01:51.281
and other birds recognize
and respond to their dead.

00:01:51.281 --> 00:01:53.274
The message is fairly
simple from what we know

00:01:53.274 --> 00:01:56.671
at this point, I think that it mainly is

00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:59.687
an opportunity for them to learn about

00:01:59.687 --> 00:02:03.085
sources of death and
places to avoid and perhaps

00:02:03.085 --> 00:02:05.929
other objects in the environment to avoid.

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:08.656
So I see it as a real arena for learning.

00:02:08.656 --> 00:02:10.440
Before I get into the crows, I wanted to

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.281
step back to the mammals for just a second

00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:14.593
and relate quite an
interesting observation

00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:16.223
I had in Yellowstone National Park,

00:02:16.223 --> 00:02:18.973
about four years ago to this day.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:21.848
And at this point we were
with a group of students

00:02:21.848 --> 00:02:24.707
looking at a wolf kill,
trying to assess the landscape

00:02:24.707 --> 00:02:27.364
that might have contributed to this death.

00:02:27.364 --> 00:02:29.712
And it was an old female that had died,

00:02:29.712 --> 00:02:31.873
she'd been killed about two weeks earlier.

00:02:31.873 --> 00:02:35.479
And the death scene was one
of a large cleft boulder,

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:37.872
the female had backed
into that, it was a bison

00:02:37.872 --> 00:02:41.015
that had been killed by a pack of wolves.

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:43.967
And we were measuring the
aspects of the terrain

00:02:43.967 --> 00:02:46.999
and the situation,
there was a lot of still

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:49.536
blood stained on the rock and the bones

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:52.786
of the dead female bison on the ground.

00:02:52.786 --> 00:02:54.226
And as we were busying ourselves,

00:02:54.226 --> 00:02:57.424
we heard a roar of hooves
come over the ridge,

00:02:57.424 --> 00:02:59.851
and a whole herd of
about three dozen bison

00:02:59.851 --> 00:03:01.944
displaced us from that scene.

00:03:01.944 --> 00:03:05.128
And we felt pretty bad
for having been there

00:03:05.128 --> 00:03:07.711
and interrupted this situation.

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:10.800
But the thing that was impressive was that

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.170
these bison, after they pushed us away,

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.144
they all smelled the
bones, much as we heard

00:03:15.144 --> 00:03:17.967
with other mammals, and
then each one individually

00:03:17.967 --> 00:03:19.768
walked through this cleft in the rock

00:03:19.768 --> 00:03:21.514
right where the female had been killed

00:03:21.514 --> 00:03:24.385
and passed through and
then went on their way.

00:03:24.385 --> 00:03:26.704
They were there for
about an hour in total.

00:03:26.704 --> 00:03:28.668
And that's very different than we see with

00:03:28.668 --> 00:03:32.721
the response to when a
crow finds a dead animal.

00:03:32.721 --> 00:03:35.334
So what you see in this
video are the responses

00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:38.825
of crows to finding a
dead bird that we placed

00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:42.724
on the ground right below
that telephone pole.

00:03:42.724 --> 00:03:44.334
They come in, they're
very noisy, they gather

00:03:44.334 --> 00:03:47.407
and they might last for 15 or 20 minutes

00:03:47.407 --> 00:03:50.455
before they move on out of the area.

00:03:50.455 --> 00:03:52.384
And this is a widespread
response that's been seen

00:03:52.384 --> 00:03:55.569
in other members of this
family, the Corvidae,

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:57.839
that includes things like magpies,

00:03:57.839 --> 00:04:01.543
which have been seen to
even bring tufts of grass

00:04:01.543 --> 00:04:04.223
in to a dead magpie, or scrub jays,

00:04:04.223 --> 00:04:05.128
there's been a lot of work on

00:04:05.128 --> 00:04:07.504
scrub jays just north of us here,

00:04:07.504 --> 00:04:11.004
and also ravens gathering around the dead.

00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:14.613
So let me introduce you to
this family of birds briefly,

00:04:14.613 --> 00:04:16.616
they're birds that are
familiar to most of us,

00:04:16.616 --> 00:04:18.626
they live close by with us, they include

00:04:18.626 --> 00:04:22.709
the ravens and crows,
magpies, jays, nutcrackers.

00:04:23.826 --> 00:04:26.471
And they live around the world

00:04:26.471 --> 00:04:29.270
in all the continents except Antarctica.

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.016
And almost all of these species have had

00:04:31.016 --> 00:04:33.484
some sort of interaction, as I described

00:04:33.484 --> 00:04:37.271
with the crows, to finding the dead.

00:04:37.271 --> 00:04:39.048
So, some aspects of this group,

00:04:39.048 --> 00:04:41.095
they're long lived,
they're typically social,

00:04:41.095 --> 00:04:44.282
they have long lasting
partnerships with their mates

00:04:44.282 --> 00:04:47.647
and sometimes extended family groups.

00:04:47.647 --> 00:04:50.496
They have rather large
brains for their body size.

00:04:50.496 --> 00:04:53.359
On this graph, these show
the average relationships

00:04:53.359 --> 00:04:57.526
between body size on the X axis
and brain size on the Y axis

00:04:59.464 --> 00:05:03.681
for things like fish and
here's the average bird line.

00:05:03.681 --> 00:05:05.383
And then you'll see that the dots for the

00:05:05.383 --> 00:05:06.930
various Corvids are well above

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:08.945
the bird line, more on the mammal line

00:05:08.945 --> 00:05:10.791
and even some, like the American crow

00:05:10.791 --> 00:05:13.103
that I study, right on the primate line.

00:05:13.103 --> 00:05:14.334
So these are really more like small

00:05:14.334 --> 00:05:17.470
flying monkeys than they are birds.

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:19.583
Their brains are quite complex.

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:21.634
We know now, in the last several decades,

00:05:21.634 --> 00:05:23.671
that they include places in the brain

00:05:23.671 --> 00:05:27.015
that are analogous and
also homologous to ours.

00:05:27.015 --> 00:05:30.423
For example, the hippocampus
is a homologous structure.

00:05:30.423 --> 00:05:34.590
And the amygdala is at least
an analogous structure.

00:05:35.656 --> 00:05:39.528
They have a large forebrain,
all this area here,

00:05:39.528 --> 00:05:41.143
there's a striatum, but a large forebrain

00:05:41.143 --> 00:05:43.969
where more complex sorts
of sensory information

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:46.410
might be combined and considered.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.744
And they have important
connections between

00:05:48.744 --> 00:05:52.911
the forebrain and the thalamus
back up to the forebrain

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:57.015
that allows these animals
to reconsider actions

00:05:57.015 --> 00:06:01.590
and shape them before they
act upon that information.

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:04.439
So the typical response is
to get some information in,

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:06.942
maybe from the eye,
process it in the forebrain

00:06:06.942 --> 00:06:09.856
and send a response down the spinal cord

00:06:09.856 --> 00:06:12.112
to the muscles to do something.

00:06:12.112 --> 00:06:13.537
But they don't have to always do that

00:06:13.537 --> 00:06:15.503
because of the connection here that allows

00:06:15.503 --> 00:06:17.040
that information to go back to

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.663
the forebrain and be adjusted.

00:06:19.663 --> 00:06:23.102
That's how they, for example,
learn different vocalizations.

00:06:23.102 --> 00:06:25.487
So, with an animal like
that, long lived, social,

00:06:25.487 --> 00:06:29.654
and quite cognitively nimble,
there are many reasons

00:06:30.537 --> 00:06:32.968
why they might attend
their dead, as we discussed

00:06:32.968 --> 00:06:35.176
just with Dora's presentation.

00:06:35.176 --> 00:06:37.527
So they may be looking
at a social opportunity,

00:06:37.527 --> 00:06:40.159
a vacant territory, a
potential mate for example.

00:06:40.159 --> 00:06:42.904
They may looking to learn about danger.

00:06:42.904 --> 00:06:46.944
They may be looking at
other aspects of that scene

00:06:46.944 --> 00:06:49.240
to learn what caused the death,

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:51.695
what sort of expectation in the future

00:06:51.695 --> 00:06:56.575
that area may hold for
danger and things like that.

00:06:56.575 --> 00:06:57.923
They may also be grieving and mourning

00:06:57.923 --> 00:07:01.681
a lost member of their
family, or, as I said,

00:07:01.681 --> 00:07:04.103
since these animals mate for
life, they might have been

00:07:04.103 --> 00:07:05.978
with this same individual that's dead now

00:07:05.978 --> 00:07:09.512
for 20 or 30 years and might
have a profound relationship

00:07:09.512 --> 00:07:13.912
and interaction with that
animal after it's lost.

00:07:13.912 --> 00:07:15.329
So we have tried to investigate

00:07:15.329 --> 00:07:18.627
this response by doing experiments.

00:07:18.627 --> 00:07:20.848
And what we do is we basically prepare

00:07:20.848 --> 00:07:23.671
taxidermy mounts of individual crows

00:07:23.671 --> 00:07:27.343
and have them in kind of a dead status,

00:07:27.343 --> 00:07:28.743
and then we place those out and see

00:07:28.743 --> 00:07:32.326
the response of wild
birds to those mounts.

00:07:33.423 --> 00:07:35.904
And this is a general description
basically of what we do.

00:07:35.904 --> 00:07:38.023
There's some sort of a conditioning phase,

00:07:38.023 --> 00:07:40.573
where we get animals used
to coming to an area.

00:07:40.573 --> 00:07:42.871
Then we present them with some stimulus,

00:07:42.871 --> 00:07:45.406
that could be a dead crow, or a hawk

00:07:45.406 --> 00:07:48.334
for example, just to see the response.

00:07:48.334 --> 00:07:49.704
And then we measure their response

00:07:49.704 --> 00:07:51.504
after they've encountered that.

00:07:51.504 --> 00:07:53.081
And during this time
we've been feeding them

00:07:53.081 --> 00:07:55.480
at a spot, so we know
they reliably come in,

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.502
they're using that spot to gain food,

00:07:57.502 --> 00:07:59.502
and we can look for a
change in their behavior,

00:07:59.502 --> 00:08:01.335
maybe how long it takes
for them to approach

00:08:01.335 --> 00:08:05.031
that food after they've
seen a dead bird there.

00:08:05.031 --> 00:08:06.769
So what we've found and
this is work I should say

00:08:06.769 --> 00:08:10.519
that my PhD student Kaylee Swift
and I have been engaged in,

00:08:10.519 --> 00:08:13.183
and Kaylee's continuing
this work now, but these are

00:08:13.183 --> 00:08:16.470
some of the early findings
that she discovered.

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.359
First off, in terms of
how many gatherings occur

00:08:19.359 --> 00:08:22.135
around these dead crows, about 60 percent

00:08:22.135 --> 00:08:24.921
of all the crows we put out had

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.591
a large mob form around them.

00:08:27.591 --> 00:08:29.140
And that's similar to what you would see

00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:32.119
if a hawk was present,
which is a known danger,

00:08:32.119 --> 00:08:34.672
and it's not as often as you would see

00:08:34.672 --> 00:08:37.466
if a hawk had a dead crow
in its grip for example,

00:08:37.466 --> 00:08:40.328
that almost always elicits
this sort of response.

00:08:40.328 --> 00:08:43.993
So from this, comparing to
more controlled situations

00:08:43.993 --> 00:08:45.865
where just a person is there feeding,

00:08:45.865 --> 00:08:49.616
or just food is provided,
suggests that this

00:08:49.616 --> 00:08:52.633
is some sort of response
to danger for sure.

00:08:52.633 --> 00:08:54.800
And we know that the
individuals are learning

00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:57.787
something about being
in this dangerous place,

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.975
because their approach to
the food is quite different

00:09:00.975 --> 00:09:04.982
after a danger has been
seen, versus not been seen.

00:09:04.982 --> 00:09:06.687
So here you just see the amount of time

00:09:06.687 --> 00:09:09.687
pre and post exposure to a stimulus.

00:09:10.631 --> 00:09:12.991
In this case the stimulus is just food,

00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:15.390
or a person, nothing
dangerous, no difference,

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:18.359
and if the stimulus is
a hawk or a dead crow,

00:09:18.359 --> 00:09:22.590
much longer time to approach
that food after seeing that.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.647
And this kind of narrows that response,

00:09:25.647 --> 00:09:27.672
because actually in some cases the birds

00:09:27.672 --> 00:09:30.292
refuse to come down to food
at a place they had seen

00:09:30.292 --> 00:09:34.111
a dead crow for up to six to eight weeks.

00:09:34.111 --> 00:09:36.324
And this is different also depending upon

00:09:36.324 --> 00:09:39.279
whether it's a crow or
a pigeon that they see.

00:09:39.279 --> 00:09:41.646
So they're very sensitive
to the type of stimulus.

00:09:41.646 --> 00:09:44.326
They avoid places after
seeing a dead crow,

00:09:44.326 --> 00:09:46.582
even though they had been
feeding there before,

00:09:46.582 --> 00:09:48.567
but if a dead pigeon is placed there

00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:51.774
there's no real response, no difference.

00:09:51.774 --> 00:09:55.477
And also crows do this
and not all birds do this.

00:09:55.477 --> 00:09:56.905
So we just controlled this by looking at

00:09:56.905 --> 00:09:59.615
the response of pigeons, as well as crows,

00:09:59.615 --> 00:10:02.105
to this sort of presentation.

00:10:02.105 --> 00:10:05.055
And when pigeons see a
place they've been fed at

00:10:05.055 --> 00:10:07.166
that now has a dead pigeon
at it, they continue to

00:10:07.166 --> 00:10:09.977
feed there afterwards,
like nothing had happened.

00:10:09.977 --> 00:10:12.919
I suspect turkeys, we've been
seeing some turkey videos

00:10:12.919 --> 00:10:15.606
of turkeys walking
around a dead cat today,

00:10:15.606 --> 00:10:18.792
and I suspect they act like
pigeons in this respect.

00:10:18.792 --> 00:10:20.999
But crows clearly increase their hesitancy

00:10:20.999 --> 00:10:25.949
to approach a spot after they've
seen a dead animal there.

00:10:25.949 --> 00:10:28.302
And this is a pretty
nuanced response as well.

00:10:28.302 --> 00:10:32.071
So what we see in this
graph is that the response

00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:34.334
to an adult crow that's dead versus

00:10:34.334 --> 00:10:38.376
a juvenile crow that's dead
over here, is different.

00:10:38.376 --> 00:10:42.950
And that's especially different
during the breeding season.

00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.014
So when you find a dead
juvenile crow in the

00:10:45.014 --> 00:10:48.770
breeding season, which is
a fairly common response,

00:10:48.770 --> 00:10:52.319
a lot of young birds die,
birds, the adult crows,

00:10:52.319 --> 00:10:53.502
and other crows in the area

00:10:53.502 --> 00:10:55.246
don't pay much attention
to that, they only scold

00:10:55.246 --> 00:10:58.889
and form a mob about a third of the time.

00:10:58.889 --> 00:11:00.574
Likewise during the breeding season

00:11:00.574 --> 00:11:02.694
if an adult is found,
scolding and mobbing is

00:11:02.694 --> 00:11:06.406
not as common as it is during
the non-breeding season.

00:11:06.406 --> 00:11:09.502
So this sort of nuanced
response to me suggests

00:11:09.502 --> 00:11:12.823
that this sort of
behavior is triggered more

00:11:12.823 --> 00:11:16.990
by an ecological, or more
of a social or ecological

00:11:18.832 --> 00:11:21.462
factor than it is perhaps
something like grieving

00:11:21.462 --> 00:11:25.176
or mourning the loss of this individual.

00:11:25.176 --> 00:11:26.975
In fact, I would expect the exact opposite

00:11:26.975 --> 00:11:30.033
if they were really
considering, for example,

00:11:30.033 --> 00:11:32.296
a lost young bird of
their own, their sibling

00:11:32.296 --> 00:11:35.086
or their offspring, or their mate,

00:11:35.086 --> 00:11:36.758
you would expect those responses to be

00:11:36.758 --> 00:11:38.840
especially strong during
the breeding season,

00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:43.503
for example, and especially
strong among adult birds.

00:11:43.503 --> 00:11:46.862
So we have tried to
understand where in the brain

00:11:46.862 --> 00:11:50.190
the crow is processing this information,

00:11:50.190 --> 00:11:52.584
and using that to help
explain a little bit more

00:11:52.584 --> 00:11:56.288
about why they're doing
this sort of thing.

00:11:56.288 --> 00:11:58.527
And let me explain our procedure to you

00:11:58.527 --> 00:12:00.238
a little bit here, in this slide.

00:12:00.238 --> 00:12:02.903
We're doing PET imaging of live crows

00:12:02.903 --> 00:12:06.258
as they view various sorts
of dangerous stimuli,

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:08.654
a hawk, a person that
had just captured them,

00:12:08.654 --> 00:12:12.398
or a person holding a
dead crow for example.

00:12:12.398 --> 00:12:15.080
And what we do, shown up here at the top,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:17.398
is we capture our birds in the wild.

00:12:17.398 --> 00:12:19.883
We wear a mask when we capture them,

00:12:19.883 --> 00:12:22.550
so that they learn a
particular face associated with

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:26.582
that dangerous experience,
being captured in the wild.

00:12:26.582 --> 00:12:28.233
We capture them with a
net gun that goes off

00:12:28.233 --> 00:12:30.296
with a blast and pins them to the ground,

00:12:30.296 --> 00:12:32.433
it's a pretty scary thing for a bird.

00:12:32.433 --> 00:12:34.878
And we don't want them to
associate that with us,

00:12:34.878 --> 00:12:37.071
when we see them later,
and we want to be able

00:12:37.071 --> 00:12:39.338
to have anybody take on the role of that

00:12:39.338 --> 00:12:42.117
dangerous person by putting on this mask.

00:12:42.117 --> 00:12:44.390
So, we wear a mask when we catch them.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.414
We then bring the birds into captivity

00:12:46.414 --> 00:12:48.871
and care for them
wearing a different mask.

00:12:48.871 --> 00:12:50.928
So we have one person that's good here,

00:12:50.928 --> 00:12:53.294
caring for the birds, and
one person that's bad,

00:12:53.294 --> 00:12:55.597
that has captured the bird.

00:12:55.597 --> 00:12:57.365
And we keep the birds for about a month.

00:12:57.365 --> 00:13:00.857
And during this time we bring
them in to a smaller cage,

00:13:00.857 --> 00:13:03.122
shown in the middle diagram here,

00:13:03.122 --> 00:13:06.446
where they are acclimated
overnight and then

00:13:06.446 --> 00:13:09.967
the next morning we perform
a procedure upon them.

00:13:09.967 --> 00:13:12.473
And that procedure is
simply to catch the bird

00:13:12.473 --> 00:13:16.390
out of the cage, inject
it with a glucose mimic

00:13:18.142 --> 00:13:20.408
that we use as a tracer to indicate

00:13:20.408 --> 00:13:23.366
where synaptic activity, where nerve cells

00:13:23.366 --> 00:13:26.229
are actively communicating
with one another.

00:13:26.229 --> 00:13:29.336
And we then put them back in that cage,

00:13:29.336 --> 00:13:33.350
after they've been given the
shot of glucose in their belly,

00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:35.838
and then we show them something.

00:13:35.838 --> 00:13:37.574
We let them, while they're awake, look out

00:13:37.574 --> 00:13:40.511
and observe perhaps just
a person in the room

00:13:40.511 --> 00:13:42.474
that they've never
seen, they could observe

00:13:42.474 --> 00:13:44.085
the person that caught them, or the person

00:13:44.085 --> 00:13:47.248
that cared for them, or a
person holding a dead crow,

00:13:47.248 --> 00:13:50.414
or a hawk, or nothing at all.

00:13:50.414 --> 00:13:52.945
And then, during that 20 minutes or so,

00:13:52.945 --> 00:13:55.808
we continue to let them
see that person on and off.

00:13:55.808 --> 00:13:58.300
And we then anesthetize
them, and this tracer

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:01.097
with the PET imaging
allows us to basically

00:14:01.097 --> 00:14:03.526
step back in time, while
they're anesthetized,

00:14:03.526 --> 00:14:06.783
and see where in the brain
that tracer has accumulated

00:14:06.783 --> 00:14:08.661
during the time when they were actually

00:14:08.661 --> 00:14:11.375
looking at that stimulus we gave them.

00:14:11.375 --> 00:14:13.295
So this way we can keep
them still, get a nice image

00:14:13.295 --> 00:14:15.997
and see what's going on in their brain,

00:14:15.997 --> 00:14:18.785
then wake them up, let
them rest for a day,

00:14:18.785 --> 00:14:21.478
let the tracer, the
radioactive tracer clear

00:14:21.478 --> 00:14:24.246
and they can be released back to the wild.

00:14:24.246 --> 00:14:26.351
So, for example, here's
what a crow would see

00:14:26.351 --> 00:14:29.270
if it was sitting in our cage metabolizing

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:31.894
that glucose we gave it
and looking out and seeing

00:14:31.894 --> 00:14:35.526
a person it had never seen
before holding a dead crow.

00:14:35.526 --> 00:14:37.864
The images we get of
their brain are striking,

00:14:37.864 --> 00:14:40.405
they show relative activity by how bright

00:14:40.405 --> 00:14:44.572
the areas are here, this
is the glucose fluorescing

00:14:45.488 --> 00:14:48.502
basically in the tomography,
and what you see here

00:14:48.502 --> 00:14:51.085
are bright spots on either
hemisphere of the brain

00:14:51.085 --> 00:14:53.310
which are the entopallium of the bird,

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:55.990
that's the visual processing
center of a bird's brain

00:14:55.990 --> 00:15:00.393
assessing information coming
from the two eyes here.

00:15:00.393 --> 00:15:01.740
I'm going to show you a set of graphs

00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.784
that look somewhat like
this, figures that basically

00:15:03.784 --> 00:15:06.118
show MRIs in gray, to show you the

00:15:06.118 --> 00:15:07.992
structure of the bird's brain,

00:15:07.992 --> 00:15:10.143
and then the red areas indicate what parts

00:15:10.143 --> 00:15:12.473
of the brain were most
activated in a given set

00:15:12.473 --> 00:15:15.424
of birds that saw one
thing, versus a set of birds

00:15:15.424 --> 00:15:17.649
that saw something quite different.

00:15:17.649 --> 00:15:19.759
And in this case, this
shows the part of the brain

00:15:19.759 --> 00:15:21.791
and this is the front
part of the bird's brain,

00:15:21.791 --> 00:15:24.360
that's activated when they
saw a person in the room,

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:26.184
versus nobody else in the room,

00:15:26.184 --> 00:15:28.232
so any kind of person in this case.

00:15:28.232 --> 00:15:30.782
There's a lot of higher order processing

00:15:30.782 --> 00:15:33.596
occurring in the forebrain of these birds

00:15:33.596 --> 00:15:36.238
as they consider that person,
and also in the striatum

00:15:36.238 --> 00:15:39.014
as they possibly are making
connections between that person

00:15:39.014 --> 00:15:41.990
and something that it had previously done.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:43.909
Now if we look at them
in response to basically

00:15:43.909 --> 00:15:46.670
how they see particular
people, what we have

00:15:46.670 --> 00:15:50.382
on the top panel here
is the response of birds

00:15:50.382 --> 00:15:52.894
when they looked out
and they saw the person

00:15:52.894 --> 00:15:55.918
that had previously captured
them, so a dangerous person.

00:15:55.918 --> 00:15:57.543
And they're recalling, at this point,

00:15:57.543 --> 00:15:59.904
something about that person.

00:15:59.904 --> 00:16:01.480
They already know that he was dangerous,

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.019
and now what we see
activated most clearly,

00:16:04.019 --> 00:16:05.679
in addition to that frontal area

00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:08.086
that I showed previously,
is their amygdala.

00:16:08.086 --> 00:16:09.965
So they're basically responding like

00:16:09.965 --> 00:16:12.232
other vertebrates do
with a strong response

00:16:12.232 --> 00:16:14.255
in the right hemisphere of their brain,

00:16:14.255 --> 00:16:16.911
in the amygdala region, that indicates

00:16:16.911 --> 00:16:19.102
they're responding to a known danger,

00:16:19.102 --> 00:16:22.184
a learned danger I should say.

00:16:22.184 --> 00:16:23.774
In contrast, when they see a person

00:16:23.774 --> 00:16:25.038
that they've never seen before

00:16:25.038 --> 00:16:27.846
and they're learning about
that person's behavior,

00:16:27.846 --> 00:16:29.742
because it's holding a dead crow,

00:16:29.742 --> 00:16:31.455
what is activated most strongly

00:16:31.455 --> 00:16:33.590
is the hippocampus in the bird.

00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:35.846
So what we interpret is going on here

00:16:35.846 --> 00:16:38.175
is that these birds are
acquiring information,

00:16:38.175 --> 00:16:40.733
they're learning about
this dangerous person,

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:43.876
by its association with a
dead crow, and in this case

00:16:43.876 --> 00:16:47.566
they're recalling
something already learned.

00:16:47.566 --> 00:16:50.010
We know something about the
way information proceeds

00:16:50.010 --> 00:16:52.548
from the eyes up to the bird's brain.

00:16:52.548 --> 00:16:54.269
And I just show you this diagram

00:16:54.269 --> 00:16:57.573
to point out the complexity with which

00:16:57.573 --> 00:17:00.103
this information travels from the retina

00:17:00.103 --> 00:17:04.026
up through the basal ganglia
and into the forebrain.

00:17:04.026 --> 00:17:06.629
And it's a rather simple picture actually

00:17:06.629 --> 00:17:08.536
when they're looking at a person

00:17:08.536 --> 00:17:10.646
that they've learned to be threatening,

00:17:10.646 --> 00:17:13.944
as compared to the situation when they're

00:17:13.944 --> 00:17:16.310
first assessing somebody
that's potentially

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:20.308
dangerous by in fact
holding this dead crow.

00:17:20.308 --> 00:17:22.087
So here the hippocampus
is involved as well

00:17:22.087 --> 00:17:24.936
as the forebrain and the
visual processing centers,

00:17:24.936 --> 00:17:26.927
and in this case it's mainly the forebrain

00:17:26.927 --> 00:17:30.910
and the visual processing
centers interacting.

00:17:30.910 --> 00:17:32.541
So all of these field experiments

00:17:32.541 --> 00:17:34.938
and laboratory experiments
basically point me

00:17:34.938 --> 00:17:39.597
to one conclusion, when
we show a crow a dead crow

00:17:39.597 --> 00:17:43.286
that's not a familiar individual,
that they're responding

00:17:43.286 --> 00:17:45.525
and learning about that situation,

00:17:45.525 --> 00:17:47.753
perhaps the person associated with it,

00:17:47.753 --> 00:17:50.306
or the place associated with that death,

00:17:50.306 --> 00:17:53.792
quite clear I think in this respect to me.

00:17:53.792 --> 00:17:55.167
But what else could we be missing?

00:17:55.167 --> 00:17:56.366
And to me this is the more interesting

00:17:56.366 --> 00:17:58.944
part of the work that we basically,

00:17:58.944 --> 00:18:00.798
I can only tell you I don't know,

00:18:00.798 --> 00:18:04.086
but I hope to find out at some point.

00:18:04.086 --> 00:18:07.613
But this is a pair of ravens
interacting with one another.

00:18:07.613 --> 00:18:09.230
They form very close relationships,

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.557
and surely, I would guess,
we would see differences

00:18:11.557 --> 00:18:13.968
in the brain activity of a bird after it

00:18:13.968 --> 00:18:16.982
had lost its mate, than
if it just encounters

00:18:16.982 --> 00:18:20.238
a dead bird that it
doesn't know personally.

00:18:20.238 --> 00:18:21.945
But we haven't done that experiment,

00:18:21.945 --> 00:18:23.629
it's something that could be done,

00:18:23.629 --> 00:18:27.126
but ethically is difficult to do.

00:18:27.126 --> 00:18:29.374
There are other things
that suggest there may be

00:18:29.374 --> 00:18:32.238
a lot more going on than
just learning about a site.

00:18:32.238 --> 00:18:34.889
And these are more anecdotal observations.

00:18:34.889 --> 00:18:37.701
I mentioned earlier that
when magpies come in

00:18:37.701 --> 00:18:40.309
to their dead, they've been
observed to carry grass.

00:18:40.309 --> 00:18:41.965
And maybe that's just the nesting material

00:18:41.965 --> 00:18:44.598
that they were carrying
when they encountered that,

00:18:44.598 --> 00:18:46.871
or maybe it was something more purposeful.

00:18:46.871 --> 00:18:49.551
So, for example, in
crows this picture shows

00:18:49.551 --> 00:18:52.932
one that was found that was
surrounded by these sticks.

00:18:52.932 --> 00:18:54.790
There were no trees
around, there was nothing

00:18:54.790 --> 00:18:56.039
where these sticks could have just

00:18:56.039 --> 00:18:59.504
been there incidentally,
maybe a human put them there,

00:18:59.504 --> 00:19:02.405
or perhaps the crow had come in and

00:19:02.405 --> 00:19:05.125
put those sticks around this dead crow.

00:19:05.125 --> 00:19:06.093
We don't know, but I have several

00:19:06.093 --> 00:19:07.814
observations like this from people.

00:19:07.814 --> 00:19:12.130
And then finally, just a
week ago, a woman sent me

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:13.738
this image which she took on the

00:19:13.738 --> 00:19:16.630
Michigan State University campus.

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:17.964
And what you see here is a crow

00:19:17.964 --> 00:19:20.857
that is looking at a dead crow,

00:19:20.857 --> 00:19:24.298
the dead crow has only recently died.

00:19:24.298 --> 00:19:26.658
The woman suggested it
might have hit a window

00:19:26.658 --> 00:19:28.322
or something by the looks of it,

00:19:28.322 --> 00:19:30.874
and this bird flew in, totally silent,

00:19:30.874 --> 00:19:33.290
brought this piece of tinfoil in its bill

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:35.954
and set it down in front of the dead crow.

00:19:35.954 --> 00:19:38.947
And it stood there for 20
minutes, watching this.

00:19:38.947 --> 00:19:41.130
I have no idea if these are a mated pair,

00:19:41.130 --> 00:19:44.132
or if, again, this was
anything other than incidental,

00:19:44.132 --> 00:19:45.785
but it's curious to me
that they didn't scold,

00:19:45.785 --> 00:19:47.104
this bird didn't scold and didn't

00:19:47.104 --> 00:19:50.125
attract a crowd in, like we regularly see.

00:19:50.125 --> 00:19:52.059
So I think there's much more going on here

00:19:52.059 --> 00:19:54.396
than we know, and it will take much more

00:19:54.396 --> 00:19:56.764
sophisticated experiments to get at them,

00:19:56.764 --> 00:20:00.206
which hopefully we'll do in the future.

00:20:00.206 --> 00:20:01.391
And with that I would thank you

00:20:01.391 --> 00:20:02.956
very much for your attention.

00:20:02.956 --> 00:20:05.206
(applause)

00:20:14.502 --> 00:20:17.085
(techno music)
