00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.210
 Let's take a look at some more methods for 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:04.410
 solving systems of equations. 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:12.370
 Let's say I have the equation 3x plus 4y equals 2.5. 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:24.788
 And I have another equation 5x minus 4y equals 25.5. 

00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:28.150
 We want to find the values ​​of x and y that satisfy both 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.220
 of these equations. 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.260
 If you think about it graphically, it will be 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.850
 the intersection of the lines representing the solutions of 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.080
 both of the equations. 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.930
 So how can we do? 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.520
 We saw that in the substitution, we want to 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.350
 we remove one of the variables. 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.030
 We did it by replacing it the last time. 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.720
 But is there anything we can add or draw - let's focus 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.690
 to this yellow, to the above equation here - is there 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.200
 something we can add or subtract from both 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.330
 sides of this equation? 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.290
 Remember, every time you work with an equation, you must 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.240
 add or remove the same thing for both sides. 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.590
 But is there anything we could add or remove from the two 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.410
 sides of this equation that can 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.069
 remove one of the variables? 

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:08.170
 And then we will have an equation with a variable i 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.610
 we can solve it. 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.460
 And that probably is not obvious, even though it's right 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.050
 in front of your eyes. 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.620
 What if we just add that? 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.190
 equation to this equation? 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.860
 What I have in mind is: what happens if we add 5x minus 4y 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.140
 to the left and add 25.5 to the right? 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.030
 If I had to literally add this to the left, 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.830
 add this to the right side. 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.340
 And you'll probably say, Sal, wait, how can it be simple 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:37.870
 to add two equations this way? 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.830
 Remember that when you make an equation if I have 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.400
 some form equation - well, really any equation - 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.650
 Ah plus Wu is equal to C if I want to do something with that 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.460
 equation, I just have to add the same thing to both sides 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.470
 of the equation. 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.570
 So I could for example, I can add D to both sides of 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.090
 the equation. 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.310
 Since D equals D, I will not 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.970
 changes the equation. 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:09.270
 You will get Ax plus plus Wu, plus D equals C plus D. 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.170
 We have seen this many, many times. 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.500
 Everything you do with one side of the equation, you have to do it 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.760
 and to the other side. 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.350
 But you say, hey, Sal, wait, on the left, 

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.180
 you add 5x minus 4y to the equation. 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.090
 On the right side add 25.5 to the equation. 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.976
 Do not add two different things to both sides 

00:02:27.976 --> 00:02:28.840
 of the equation? 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.740
 And my answer will be no. 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.450
 We know that 5x minus 4y is 25.5. 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.160
 This quantity and quantity is the same. 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.630
 They are both 25.5. 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.660
 This second equation tells me explicitly. 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.710
 So, I can add this to the left side. 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.170
 I add essentially 25.5 to it. 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.150
 And I can add 25.5 to the right side. 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.340
 So, let's do that. 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.910
 If we add the left side, 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.580
 3x plus 5x is 8x. 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.590
 And then, how much is 4y minus 4y? 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.660
 And that's the whole point. 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:08.080
 When I looked at these two equations, I said, oh, I have 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.860
 4y, I have and minus 4 y. 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.490
 If you just add these two together, they will 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.180
 are canceled. 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.670
 They will be plus 0y. 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:17.780
 Or this whole article will just disappear. 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:25.540
 And this will be equal to 2.5 plus 25.5 is 28. 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.800
 So, divide both sides. 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.530
 You get 8x equals 28. 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:38.600
 Divide both sides to 8 and get x equals 28 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.760
 on 8 or divide the numerator and 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.200
 the denominator of 4. 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.900
 This is equal to 7 on 2. 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.070
 This is our x value. 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:51.050
 Now we want to find our y value. 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.930
 We can replace that in each one 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.550
 from these two equations. 

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.820
 Let's use the above. 

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.830
 You can also do it with the lower one. 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:08.280
 So, we know that 3 by x, 3 by 7 on 2 - simple 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:11.510
 replace the value of x that we found in the above 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.130
 Equation - 3 by 7 on 2, plus 4y is equal to 2.5. 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.589
 Let me just write this as a 5/2. 

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:21.410
 We will remain in the fracture world. 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:28.670
 This will be 21 on 2 plus 4y is equal to 5/2. 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.510
 We take 21 out of 2 on both sides. 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:37.310
 So, minus 21 on 2, minus 21 on 2. 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.700
 The left side - you just stay with 4y, because 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.930
 these two boys are canceled - is equal to - that's 5 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.220
 minus 21 on 2. 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.060
 Minus 16 on 2. 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.730
 It's minus 16 on 2, which is the same as - 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.550
 well, I will write it as minus 16 on 2. 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:02.030
 Or we can write this as - let's continue here on top - 4y - 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:06.340
 just keep going in this line of thought here - 4y is equal 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.400
 to minus 8. 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.550
 You divide the two sides into 4, and you get y is 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.010
 equal to minus 2. 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.150
 So the solution of this equation is x is equal to 7/2, 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.510
 y is equal to minus 2. 

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.650
 This will be the coordinates of their crossing. 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:28.180
 And you can try them in both of these 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.130
 equations here. 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.500
 Let's check that out 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.330
 also satisfies the lower equation. 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:42.930
 5 by 7/2 is 35 on 2, minus 4 by minus 2, so minus 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.170
 - 8. 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:52.620
 This is equal to - let's see, this is 17.5 plus 8. 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.070
 And it really is 25.5. 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:58.970
 So, this satisfies both equations. 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:02.400
 Now let's see if we can use our newly discovered skills for 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.580
 dealing with a tricky task, our newly discovered skills in 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:07.440
 elimination. 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:10.460
 Here it is said, Nadia and Peter are visiting a patisserie. 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:16.970
 Nadia buys 3 chocolate desserts and 4 fruit rolls for $ 2.84. 

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:21.700
 Peter also buys 3 chocolate desserts but can only afford 1 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.430
 an additional fruit roll. 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.950
 The purchase costs $ 1.79. 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.030
 What is the price of any chocolate dessert and any fruit roll? 

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.310
 Let's define some variables. 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:33.650
 Let's just use x and y. 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:40.720
 Taking x is equal to the price of chocolate dessert - I would put 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.830
 c and f for the fruit roll, but I will stay with x and y 

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.290
 y - price for chocolate dessert. 

00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:53.020
 Let y be equal to the cost of a fruit roll. 

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.260
 All right. 

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:00.310
 So what does this first statement say to us? 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:04.060
 Nadia buys 3 chocolate desserts, so the price of 3 desserts 

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.310
 will be 3x. Three times the price of a chocolate dessert. 

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.950
 And 4 fruit rolls. 

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:15.570
 Plus 4 y, the cost of a fruit roll. 

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.340
 That's how much Nadia has spent. 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.480
 3 chocolate desserts, 4 fruit rolls. 

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:23.960
 And it will cost $ 2.84. 

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.980
 This is what the first statement says. 

00:07:25.980 --> 00:07:28.210
 It turns into this equation. 

00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:29.390
 The second statement. 

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:35.750
 Peter also buys 3 chocolate desserts but can only afford 1 

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.550
 an additional fruit roll. 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:40.300
 Plus 1 extra fruit roll. 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:46.250
 The value of his purchase is $ 1.79. 

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:49.210
 What is the price of any chocolate dessert and any fruit roll? 

00:07:49.210 --> 00:07:51.040
 We will solve this with the elimination. 

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.270
 You can decide this by using any of the techniques we've seen 

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.390
 so far - substitution, elimination, even graphics, 

00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:57.650
 although it's a bit hard to see 

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:59.020
 things to draw. 

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:00.570
 How can we do that? 

00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:03.200
 Remember, with elimination you will add - let 

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:05.990
 focus on the above equation here. 

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.380
 Is there anything we can add to both sides of this 

00:08:08.380 --> 00:08:09.910
 an equation that will help us 

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.170
 to remove one of the variables? 

00:08:12.170 --> 00:08:14.240
 Or let me say this way: is there anything we can add 

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:18.100
 or to pull out on both sides this equation that will help us 

00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:20.550
 to eliminate one of the variables? 

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.950
 As with the task we did a little earlier in 

00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:27.860
 video, what if we get this equation or 

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:31.500
 what happens if we draw 3x plus y from 3x plus 4y of 

00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:34.799
 left side and pull out $ 1.79 from 

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:36.030
 the right side? 

00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.590
 And do not forget that by doing this, I will pull out the same thing 

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:41.909
 something on both sides of the equation. 

00:08:41.909 --> 00:08:44.059
 That's $ 1.79. 

00:08:44.059 --> 00:08:44.830
 How do I know this? 

00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:48.170
 Because it is said that this is equal to $ 1.79. 

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.810
 So, if we do that, we'll pull out the same thing 

00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:53.760
 on both sides of the equation. 

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:57.320
 So, let's get 3x plus y from 

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.620
 left side of the equation. 

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.550
 And let's do it right at the top. 

00:09:03.550 --> 00:09:08.550
 If I draw 3x plus y, it's the same thing as minus 

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:12.680
 3x minus y if you simply allocate the negative sign. 

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:13.750
 So, let's get it out. 

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:20.820
 You get minus 3x minus y - maybe you should 

00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.750
 I want to make it clear that this is not a plus sign; you can imagine that 

00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:27.560
 multiply the second equation by minus 1 - e 

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.460
 equal to minus $ 1.79. 

00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:32.000
 I just take the second equation. 

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.090
 You can imagine that I multiply it by minus 1 

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:37.440
 and now I will add to the left side, 

00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.310
 the left side of this equation and the right 

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.160
 side to the right side of this equation. 

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.450
 And what will we get? 

00:09:45.450 --> 00:09:49.010
 When you add 3x plus 4y, minus 3x, minus y, 

00:09:49.010 --> 00:09:50.540
 3x are canceled. 

00:09:50.540 --> 00:09:52.730
 3x minus 3x is 0x. 

00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:54.080
 I will not even write it. 

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.650
 You get 4x minus - sorry, 4y minus y. 

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.630
 That's 3y. 

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:06.940
 And it will be $ 2.84 minus $ 1.79. 

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:07.930
 How is this? 

00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:12.980
 That's $ 1.05. 

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:15.100
 So, 3y is equal to $ 1.05. 

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.903
 We divide the two sides into 3. 

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.700
 y is equal to - how much is $ 1.05 divided by 3? 

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:27.980
 3 is contained in $ 1.05 ... 

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.340
 It is contained in 1 zero times. 

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:33.290
 0 in 3 is 0. 

00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:35.190
 1 minus 0 is 1. 

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:36.620
 Download below 0. 

00:10:36.620 --> 00:10:38.800
 3 is contained in 10 three times. 

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.220
 3 in 3 is 9. 

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.380
 We remove. 

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.170
 10 minus 9 is 1. 

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.360
 Take 5 below. 

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:49.170
 3 is contained in 15 five times. 

00:10:49.170 --> 00:10:51.740
 5 by 3 is 15. 

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.630
 We remove. 

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.150
 We have no residue. 

00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:57.910
 So y is equal to $ 0.35. 

00:10:57.910 --> 00:11:01.020
 The cost of the fruit roll is $ 0.35. 

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.930
 Now we can substitute back into any of these equations, 

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:07.720
 to find the price of chocolate dessert. 

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.470
 So let's use the equation below here. 

00:11:12.470 --> 00:11:14.680
 Which was originally if you remember before I multiplied it 

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:22.840
 by minus 1, it was 3x plus y equals $ 1.79. 

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:29.590
 This means that 3x plus the cost of a fruit roll, 0.35 

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:32.090
 is equal to $ 1.79. 

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:39.470
 If we draw 0.35 on both sides, what will we get? 

00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:42.110
 On the left - just stay 3x; these 

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:45.530
 are canceled - is equal to - to see this 

00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:47.750
 is $ 1.79 minus $ 0.35. 

00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.000
 That's $ 1.44. 

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:59.670
 And 3 is contained in $ 1.44, I think it is contained - well, 3 is contained in 

00:11:59.670 --> 00:12:03.250
 $ 1.44, enter 1 zero times. 

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:06.280
 1 by 3 is 0. 

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.540
 Download below 1. 

00:12:07.540 --> 00:12:08.190
 We remove. 

00:12:08.190 --> 00:12:09.380
 Download below 4. 

00:12:09.380 --> 00:12:11.970
 3 enters at 14 four times. 

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:14.130
 4 by 3 is 12. 

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:17.360
 I make it messy. 

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.260
 14 minus 12 is 2. 

00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.750
 Download below 4. 

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.440
 3 is contained in 24 eight times. 

00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:24.820
 8 by 3 is 24. 

00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:26.250
 No residue. 

00:12:26.250 --> 00:12:30.740
 So, x is equal to 0.48. 

00:12:30.740 --> 00:12:31.660
 So, we already have it. 

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.760
 We found using the elimination that the cost of 

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:39.030
 chocolate dessert is equal to $ 0.48 and that the price of fruit 

00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:42.800
 roll is equal to $ 0.35.
