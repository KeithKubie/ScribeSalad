Speaker 1:          00:01          Okay. So we're going to finish up on nucleus Phillips substitution, the sn two, where we're spending so much time looking at how you prove a mechanism and then look at the, that, the elimination, that second order, and then the substitution and elimination that our first order kinetically. So we've looked at that proving mechanisms that is disproving mechanisms by stereochemistry, by rate, law, by rate, constant, varying, all the different components of the reaction. And finally, there's another way, which is to look at structure, which you can do either with quantum mechanics or, uh, by X-ray. Uh, and the problem, remember, is this really subtle distinction. One that probably doesn't make much difference, but if you're really looking carefully at mechanism and want to understand them, it's an interesting question, which is, is there an energy minimum at the top? Is there an intermediate in the concerted sn two reaction, or is it just the transition state?

Speaker 1:          01:05          And of course, they blend into one another as the, as the, uh, stability of the pentavalent intermediate. If there were one, uh, gets, uh, less and less. So the, the interesting thing is, is when you have the nucleophile leaving group and the carbon in the middle try Vaillant carbon, is it actually a pentavalent carbon? Is there some stability associated with that? So you could imagine a ranging groups like oxygen's with their unshared pairs on the left and right and a planar carbon cad I and in the middle and see whether there's a bond there. How are you going to get them? Things that remember that the, the non bonded distances between Adams when they're in contact is about twice as big as bonded distances. Right? So if the thing is, is only marginally stable, what's going to keep it from flying apart? How will it last long enough for you to look at it?

Speaker 1:          02:00          Well, you can put other things in a molecule that hold those pieces in place. Like this set of three aromatic rings of the anthropocene system. Okay, now we've got the groups up there on top where we want and the question is going to be, well first, how do we get them there? The thing in the middle is started as an Ester, right? But we want it to be a cad ion with a vacant p orbital in the middle. So what you do is react it with the molecule we talked about before, mayor vines reagent, which is a way of giving methyl groups. It's got a great leaving group on it. A dye methyl ether is the leaving group. So we can have, uh, a substitution reaction and put a methyl group on. And now the carbon has a positive charge. Although if you want to be careful about not all the positive charges on carbon, because the unshared payers on the knee on the adjacent oxygen's, of course, they're mixing with that vacant orbital.

Speaker 1:          02:57          Okay? So we've got our tribal carbon cad, I in the middle, uh, there we see it and uh, on, there should be this, this, an eye on that was left from the original mayor vine salt. And the people who did the ex-ray work were surprised to find that it was not BF four minus, but B to f seven minus it had it had gotten together with another BF three. So that's neither here nor there, but it's what was there in the crystal. So now they have the oxygen's next to the central carbon. And to remember calculated when you had a cat ion with waters on both sides of a travail and carbon. Was that at the uh, symmetrical pentavalent quote geometry? Uh, it was a transition state. Okay. So we don't, they, if you believed in, in the theory, you wouldn't expect there to be stability here.

Speaker 1:          03:52          Now, how do you know if there's stability? How do you know if there are bonds there? Well, you can look in the paper that's cited down there on the bottom right, and it shows a picture and you can see that indeed there are bonds there, right? That's supposed to engender a laugh. I see Chris smiling. Why do you smile? They just drew the bonds, right? How do you know there are bonds there? Well, there's one interesting thing. This, the structure is symmetrical, has drawn. Okay. And you noticed these funny shapes of the atoms have what they are are ellipses with uh, uh, octa cutout of them to show the size of the axes. And one thing you major in X-ray is how much? The eye, the Adam's vibrate. Okay. And those show how much it vibrates in the three principal directions for vibration. Right. And if we look at that, see 19 the central carbon there, notice it's not a long gated, right?

Speaker 1:          04:54          It would be a long gated if it, if it vibrated with great amplitude back and forth. Right. It would move a lot in that direction. So it could be, remember in ex-ray what you see is the average structure over many molecules. It could have been that one of them is like this. Another one is like this and other ones like this. I know there's like this and the average would appear to be in the middle. Right? But it would have a long displacement on the average. You see? But that's not what you see there. It could be like this bell clap or sometimes they're, sometimes they're but on average in the middle. But it's not because it's not stretched out that way. Okay. But that still doesn't answer the question whether their bonds there, it couldn't be in the middle, but no bonds. Okay. So let's look right edge on at the, at the central carbon and ask the question, how far apart are those two oxygens?

Speaker 1:          05:50          If the, if the interaction is repulsive, then they should move apart if it's attractive, should move together compared to what? Well, the authors compared it with the two carbons they were attached to, hey, what's your 5.02 Ostrom's apart? And the white is 4.86 so they'd been drawn together. The distance is shortened by 0.1, six songs, drums as if they're being sucked in, right? So, uh, that looks like there's a pentavalent carbon that's actually attracting those adjacent oxygens. So this was published in a distinguished journal, the Journal of the American Chemical Society. And notice that it's not only that distance, but you can see also that the angles are distorted. The w instead of those being hundred 20 degree angles out on the left there, uh, one of them is larger and one of them is seven degrees smaller. It's bent in as if it's being sucked by the central carbon so that there's a bond there. So pentavalent seem to be a safe inference. And that was the subject of this paper. But if they did compared to what, and just had hydrogen in the middle, instead of that positive carbon, it turned out they were sucked in even further. So instead of being 4.84 or whatever it is, it's for, it's a, it's 4.75 songs. Drums, right. So much for that proof that the, that these groups are being sucked in, right? With nothing in the middle, just the hydrogen, they're sucked in.

Speaker 1:          07:28          Now notice that that wasn't all that was on. There wasn't just that positive carbon. There were, there were these other things, the oxygen's in the methyls. So there was some space to that which could have pushed things apart. Right? So now lacking that push apart, they come together closer. So from one point of view, that's reasonable, but why should they come together? It's not a pull to the central carbon. It seems to be a push. Where is the push coming from? Can anybody see what pushes those methoxy groups? The oxygen's toward the center.

Speaker 2:          08:10          Helen, this screen,

Speaker 1:          08:18          one of the methyls being pushed by.

Speaker 2:          08:21          Yeah,

Speaker 1:          08:25          it must be some push to bend those ankles in. Anybody got an idea, Chris, with the hydrogen? Ah, the hydrogens, right? There's a clips and there's repulsion there that causes them to bend in right now. You can put it, you can put instead of a positive carbon, you can put oxygen in the middle with this extra group on it and that you see does push them further apart, but still they're bent in a little bit, right as compared to the carbon. But the central oxygen is only slightly repulsive compared to the carbon. So the carbon is not pulling things in at all. It's pushing them out, trying to fight against that hydrogen pushing into the methyl out on the side. Now if you have BF three in the middle, which clearly has the vacant orbital on Boron has very small other things on the Boron, so they're not pushing apart and those other things are flury.

Speaker 1:          09:26          So not only are they're small, but they're withdrawing electrons and making that be orbital, especially low in energy. Then you can see them generally genuinely being sucked in right further than in any of the other cases. Okay. As compared there to the, to the positive carbon in the middle. Now if you try to make the things on the outside more willing to give up their electrons diet, that is higher homos to make stronger bonds. Right. And make it oh minus rather than ch three. Oh, so we have the minus charge raising those homos, then indeed it forms a bond, but not to bonds. It's unsymmetrical. Right. So one of them is a, is a reasonable bond. The other one is just a non bonded interaction. Right. And in fact, it turns out that this is assault. It's an anti on. So there's a positive, uh, cat die in nearby a potassium, which makes it a little bit unsymmetrical so that it's better to have the minus charge on the right near the potassium cad I, and then on the left. So that also helps distort it. Now I remember that as compared to the, uh, an eye and that was calculated, which again was said to be by calculation, the transition state.

Speaker 1:          10:50          Okay. So here are the whole bunch of things they studied and I don't want to spend the time going through this in great detail, but compared to what? Compared to just having a hydrogen in the middle, right, to see what these distances are. And then in the case where c plus was in the middle, right, they made the c plus that that way, but it's not such a great c plus because of the, of the, uh, vacant orbital on the carbon being mixed with the unshared pairs on the adjacent oxygen's a, but if you have, uh, uh, if you have a bow, if the central atom is bonded to oxygen or sulfur, which has these extra electrons, that seems to use up the vacant orbital. So it's not so good at bonding and therefore sucking things in. If you have fluorine on Boron, then the, as we said, the electron withdrawal lowers the energy.

Speaker 1:          11:42          And indeed it does seem to suck it in to give a pent availa data, but in the middle. But if you have a higher homos on the neighbor of the Boron giving their electrons to the, to the Boron, then that's a better source of electrons for the Boron than the neighboring atoms are. And you can see in these cases, okay, so if you'll look up this whole bunch of things plotted in this particular way, you can see, for example, there's a boron with two chlorine in the middle and meth oxides on both sides. And the, the bar then shows the two different bond distances. So it's unsymmetrical, one is short, one is long, it's not a pentavalent carbon, right? So there's some that are like that on the right, very different and unsymmetrical. Then there's some on the left that are about equal bond distances, right and left that are symmetrical.

Speaker 1:          12:36          Right? And there's our reference with hydrogen in the middle, right? And it's pressed in to give somewhat short distances by that, by the hydrogen. Pushy on the methyl is, as we spoke about before, if you have bore on, on the middle, it's not sucked in very much, right? Unless you have that case with fluorine on the Boron. And then it attracts enough that you can make a pentavalent Adam in the middle. Right? But most of the Boron are tetra coordinate. That is unsymmetrical, not, uh, not a single minimum, but a double minimum day. And if you look at the two cases of carbon, the one with, uh, with oxygens on each side there, on the left is, uh, is a symmetrical but not short, right? And the one on the right is, is a short, one of them is short, but the other, as long it's not symmetrical. So there's no sign from this exercise for a pentavalent intermediate of the sn two sword being stable, it seems genuinely to be, uh, to be just a maximum on the way across. Okay. That's a, so it's a transition state as calculated by quantum mechanics. So that should give us a little more confidence perhaps in the reliability of quantum mechanics, which of course can't take into account all the neighbors around the molecule.

Speaker 1:          14:07          Okay. So that's as far as we're going to go. Looking at the mechanism of the sn two now we're going to look at alternative paths of reaction. That elimination reaction, which we already mentioned last semester, and also first order nuclear affiliate substitution and elimination first e two or Beta elimination. Now we, this is from last semester. You remember you can attack here with a high homo anti-bonding here anti-bonding here you break off fluoride, you break off hydrogen and formed the carbon carbon bond is shown by the curved arrows here and we said last semester that that's the two elimination mechanism. Now what influences the rate? The rate is influenced by the base, right? That's what makes it second order. It depends not only on the concentration of the substrate but also on the concentration of hydroxide. So the two must be getting together in the rate limiting step or before the rate limiting step in approval, luminary equilibrium that God gets drawn off.

Speaker 1:          15:11          So that's the same thinking it was we had on the sn two that both things are involved in the rate limiting or before the rate limited step. It depends on the nature of the leaving group. A better leaving group reacts faster, so that means that the fluoride is leaving and the rate limiting step or before the rate limiting step. In a pre equilibrium, there's a hydrogen isotope effect called a kinetic isotope effect. If you change hydrogen for deuterium, you change the rate, and this has, this has special implication as you can see here. These others only meant it was at the transition state or before the transition state that something was happening. But if this makes a difference, it shows that that bond is been breaking during the bead broken during the transition state. So we know the leaving group is leaving, we know the base has coming in either before or those two things, either before or at the transition state.

Speaker 1:          16:12          And now we know the hydrogen is leaving at the transition state and let's see how that works. Okay, so we saw an Arab and meets Goldie locks that you have a of vibrational potential surface and you'd have also a vibrational potential surface for the hydrogen that's being transferred after it's transferred. It stuck first place to the carbon in the second place to the oxygen and in both, but it halfway across when the bond is being broken, it's between the two. So it's not being bound to either. It's a very low, it's easy to move back and forth when it's halfway between. Okay. Now what implication to this have for the kinetic energy of that hydrogen? Remember there's a lowest possible kinetic energy, the one that gives no nodes and the wave and it'll be, uh, it'll be here in that case here and the oxygen case. But when it's very easy to move that you can stretch the wave way out. Very little curvature, very little kinetic energy. So you could have much lower minimum kinetic energy at when the hydrogen bond has been broken. That when it's either attached to the carbon or attached to the height, to the oxygen. Okay. Now, what's the implication of that? What when you do the reaction, you have to get to the transition state. So you have to put in that much energy. Okay. Now, what's the implication if we change from hydrogen to deuterium?

Speaker 1:          17:46          You remember what happens when you have changed the mass in Arabic meets goldilocks to the lowest energy. If you make the mid to do pterygiums, then you have a wave that looks like this. But the bigger mass means it has lower energy.

Speaker 2:          18:10          Hi.

Speaker 1:          18:12          So we have lower energy here, lower energy here, and lower energy here, but it can't be lower than the minimum. So there's hardly any change in the energy here when you go from hydrogen to deuterium. But there's a substantial change here and a substantial change here, right? So now, if, if you look at the energy that's required for the reaction, it's more energy is required for the deuterium because it started lower. If you were talking about an equilibrium between here and here, then that difference would cancel out. It's only at that transition state, which has the very low potential, right? That means that there's something special about the deuterium, or perhaps you should say something not special about the deuterium, right? When it's bonded, it's unusually low in energy, but when it's not tightly bonded, then it has the same energy as hydrogen, right? So because you have more, uh, more of a barrier for deuterium, the reaction should be slower.

Speaker 1:          19:13          So hydrogen is faster than deuterium. If that is the rate limiting step, if that's not the rate limiting step, if it happens, uh, before this or after this, right, then you don't have the difference between hydrogen to deuterium. It's only when the rate, when the hydrogen is being broke broken away during the transition state, during the rate determining step that you can see it. So, so you get that difference in rates only that so-called kinetic isotope effect only if bond is being weakened in the rate determining transition state. Okay. So now there's another interesting implication as there was an sn two, which is stereochemistry. So we have a hydrogen and a leaving group that are going to come off, right? And if we look at that from the end with the Newman projection, we see them Auntie to one another. So we can imagine pulling the two off and forming a bond by what's left.

Speaker 1:          20:11          They could have been sin to one another in an eclipsed confirmation now, which should be better. Should we pull them off anti to one another or sin to one another? Well, of course the, the top con formation would in, in, uh, involve eclipsing, right? So that would be higher in energy than the ante. And furthermore, it turns out, although we don't have time to talk about it right now, that anti orbitals overlap with one another better than sin or bottles, which seems to me that seems counterintuitive. You'd think though they are like this, they'd overlap better than when they're like that, but in fact they overlap better when their auntie. So by both accounts, one would expect, uh, the ante to be the preferred mode for, for elimination. But is it true? How could you test that experimentally? How could you tell whether they were being, they had been pulled off or we're being pulled off from the same side or from opposite sides? Well, if you look at the title of this slide, you use stereo chemistry.

Speaker 2:          21:21          Okay.

Speaker 1:          21:24          Okay. So notice then,

Speaker 2:          21:28          uh, what's happening here?

Speaker 1:          21:32          There we go. That if we put our groups on here, right? Then when we lose h and l here, these two, ours will be on the same side, but if it's rotated into this form, then there'll be on opposite sides of the new double bond that's being made across the middle. Right? So we could start for sin elimination of this particular compound where notice this configuration is s and that went also his ass and it's rotated into a confirmation where the leaving groups or sin to one another. Okay. Now of course it could rotate and they could be anti to one another and the question is which one really happens? Okay. So we can look at the product and find that the two methyls are on the same side of the double bond as they are here, both in back. Whereas here one's in front of the other is in back.

Speaker 1:          22:26          Right. So this suggests that the fact of that one gets the isomer of the, of the owl keen that it was the anti form that gave rise to it. So stereochemistry showed that it's anti elimination in this case. Of course, there could have been another reason for anti elimination. It could have been that this product is more stable than the one where the federal group is near the methyl, right? So how can we discriminate whether it's just that it's the preferred confirmation and Auntie is good for the reasons shown here, or whether the only reason you get that one is because it's more stable. Can anybody see how you can test that? You could use a different stereo chemistry of the starting material and see if it still gives that one. Okay. So maybe he is just more stable than the Z isomer. Okay. So here we can change the configuration on the right to make it are right. The methyl is now in back and the hydrogen in front here, right? So now the sin is the one that should give the isomer and the Auntie should give the Z. Right?

Speaker 1:          23:46          And in fact, you see it is Izzy. So no matter which way, it can't be just because this one is more stable, because if you change it, you've got that one, right? So it has to be that it favors the ante con formation for the elimination. Okay, so there's Auntie stereochemistry, right? But nature is not dogmatic about this. If there's, if you can't do the, the uh, anti, then the sin is, is a, is still okay. And here's an example of that, uh, taken from the Jones Textbook. Uh, notice that in this case, the treatment with base to eliminate hydrogen or deterioration from this side and tousled each from that side removes the deuterium leaving two hydrogens and gives that a 98% yield. Even those two, even though those two are required to be sin to one another, because again, this by cyclic framework, the say one used by Bartlett and knocks, that idea of holding things in place that way doesn't require, doesn't allow confirmational change around here.

Speaker 1:          24:58          So these have to be sin to one another, right? So it loses d ots, not h o t s despite the kinetic isotope of factor. Remember, hydrogen is eliminated and preference to do Tyrian other things being equal, but other things are equal as you can look here. If you do a sort of semi Newman projection along this bond, you can see that d and Ots, their bonds are in the same plane. So in this rigid eclipsed case, the overlap of Sigma Star here, which is losing its electrons, right? Uh, that is as the ots minus leaves, this vacant orbital is able to overlap well and stabilize the sigma orbitals and in this, uh, bond. So it takes away those electrons and deep plus leaves. So the Eclipse d is better than age, which would would be better if it could be anti, but this framework doesn't allow it to be anti.

Speaker 1:          25:55          There's not good overlap between the h and the ots. It's anticline UL. And notice in this case that you don't have to pay a penalty for having the starting material for the sin elimination eclipsed. It's required to be eclipsed by the nature of the linkage among the carbons. Okay. Now there's, that's a question of Stereo Chemistry, whether you get E or z Isomer, right? There's also a question of what's called Riggio Chemistry. Where does the double bond appear? So if the leaving group is here on the second carbon and you treat it with base to remove h and l, uh, then you can get the double bond either in this position or in this position, right? And that that one can both be both CIS and trans. I draw only the Trans isomer right now. So you could remove a blue hydrogen or red hydrogen. Right?

Speaker 1:          26:50          And this is the kind of thing where before people knew anything about mechanism, people tried to figure out how you can get a certain product and these at different pathways, this was just lore, right? This would do this, this would do this. And there were two kinds of rules. One was the rule do to Hoffman, the other was the rule do to site sef, right? So there was the site's f rule, which said you should take off the blue hydrogen and there was the Hoffman rule that you should take off the red hydrogen. Okay. And some cases did one and some cases did the other. And it was your business if you are a synthetic chemist, to know which ones did which. So you had no what kind of leaving group to choose or what kind of bass to choose to do your particular to get the particular product you are desirous of.

Speaker 1:          27:44          So if you have the leaving group of the halogen, Ziad and bromine, chlorine, you see their site, Seth, the dominant Ice Library you get is in the second position, not the terminal position, right? But notice as we go, I had and bromine, chlorine and it gets less and less sites. F and in fact, if you go to flu ride, it turns around and it becomes Hoffman and its orientation. Right? And the same is true for the leaving group being uh, trimethylamine. So the trimethyl ammonium starting material loses that this, uh, this, uh, uh, trimethylamine and, and uh, and this proton. So it's 98% of Hoffman orientation. So, uh, so this big group seems to be Hoffman a iodide seems to be sites f but look, let's look a little bit about the energetics that are involved here. Okay. So this is a ratio of about four to one.

Speaker 1:          28:42          This is about one to 50. So the whole range, which is very important, which what you're going to be getting, uh, is only a factor of 200 between four to one and one to 50. So 400 means a factor of 10 to the 2.3, which means that it's about three kilocalories change and energy that makes it from going four to one, one way to 50 to one the other way, a change of just three kilocalories. And remember that a hydrogen bond is not a particularly strong hydrogen bond is worth three kilocalories. So you can see that subtle things are going to enter into this, not it's, it's, it's not surprising that there are not a hard and fast rules that sometimes that sites sef and sometimes it's, uh, it's Hoffman because this is a very subtle thing. It's important for synthesis, but it does, but it's not a big factor that you could be confident that you put your finger on it and say, that's the reason that went that way.

Speaker 1:          29:45          Okay, now you can have e two versus asset too. You can have the High Hobo come in, either attack a carbon or take a hydrogen. How well do we understand which, what, what does that, well, suppose we take ti Butyl, uh, w to do an sn. Two reaction you'd have to attack there, but we've seen this picture before and you know that that sterically hindered, you can't get in there. So steric hindrance tends to favor to disfavor sn two pro processes, but it's much easier to get to the neighboring hydrogen and pull it off. It's on the surface of the molecule. So steric hindrance favors he too over sn two. It doesn't by disfavor in sn two. So if you have very hindered center, you tend to get elimination, not substitution. Right. That makes perfect sense. And furthermore, remember when we looked at nucleo Felicity and tried to how, how good things are at attacking carbon, we, we tried to see whether it would be the same as attacking hydrogen and there wasn't such good parallelisms.

Speaker 1:          30:56          Some things were more dramatic in their PKA in attacking hydrogen than they were in attacking carbon. So that, that obviously means that if you take something that's a fairly weak nucleophile compared to how basic it is, right? The PKA though, if you look at those which are grossly out of whack, then they could be ones that would, that would, uh, prefer that, the attack and the hydrogen. So for example, hydroxide is of that case. It's a strong base but not as good a nucleophile as you would expect for such a strong base. So hydroxide or alk dockside tends to do elimination rather than substitution. But always these are a balancing act and it could depend on other factors as well.

Speaker 2:          31:42          Now

Speaker 1:          31:46          I've given the title to these next things a synthesis games because, uh, synthesis is, is for many people, the real goal of organic chemistry is how to make new molecules or to make old molecules and better ways. And there are certain, uh, uh, one of the best ways is to follow lore, right? But we, but it's also guided by understanding and there've been big, uh, lots of progress made in the last 50 years because of people having studied mechanism that if something isn't going right, you have some idea what you might change in order to make it, not just looking up in the, in the literature to see what people did before. Although that remains a very important procedure. But we saw all these different nuclear fillic a substitution reactions. And the question then, if you're trying to apply somebody else's work to yours is how general they are. For example, the Williamson ether synthesis, how general is it? So for example, here's the compound Mtb e, have you ever heard of that? I bet you've seen the word

Speaker 1:          33:00          or the acronym. It's methyl t butyl ether. Have you ever seen MTBE where did you see it? On the gasoline pump, right? This is an additive to, to, to tig gasoline. So it's made in enormous quantities right now. So here you want to make this ether. Okay, so here's the way to do it. You could start with methanol, treat it with sodium hydride. So there is a high hobo which can attack the Proton and take it away as h two leaving the sodium, salt of meth oxides. So we have a nuclear file. Now if we want to make this bond here, the one between the oxygen or the tertiary carbon, then we would react it with tea. Beautiful Bromide. Right? Are you going to get rich in the petroleum industry making Tbe that way? Are there any problems? What did we just been talking about? The competition between substitution and the elimination. Right? And what are the factors that favor he two over sn. Two Amy steric hindrance, right? Crowded here. It's hard for this option to get out the carbon. And what else

Speaker 1:          34:29          did, if you have an I have an eye on right, or a nuclear file, that's even better as a base taking hydrogen. So here we have the worst of all possible worlds. We have something that wants to take hydrogen and something that wasn't, doesn't want to be attacked at the carbon, right? So you get elimination. It's too hindered for sn two and the strong base favors he too. So all you get is, is, uh, is the, uh, the, uh, double bond compound. You don't get methyl TV. It'll ether. So does the Williams since synthesis then not work, you just throw up your hands if you're a synthetic chemist. We said we wanted to make, to make Mtbe we wanted to make that oxygen carbon bond. Can you see any alternative?

Speaker 2:          35:17          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          35:18          Do you use to make this either you could make that oxygen carbon bond. Okay. There's more than one way to skin this kind of cat. Okay. So that one won't work. Right? But if we do it the other way around and make this an ion right, which again would prefer to eliminate rather than substitute. Right? But you attack methyl bromide, which can't eliminate because it doesn't have a hydrogen on the other carbon because it doesn't have another carbon. Right? So now you get the MTBE and high yield, although nobody makes it that way. The stuff that's made for petroleum has made a different way. And we'll talk about that a little later on. But anyhow, this illustrates that often there are different ways of choosing, putting the reagents together and one will work and one won't work for reasons that you can understand mechanistically. Or here's another interesting, uh, synthetic intermediate, which is if you start with a compound that is o h and chlorine on adjacent Adams, and notice it has one in the front and one in the back, right? And you treat this with base, right? It gives this funny ether at ether. That's a three membered ring, right? And it does. So in pretty good yield, right? How does it do it? Well, hydroxide takes off this proton and can you see what happens next?

Speaker 1:          37:01          It's a reaction that's familiar to you.

Speaker 2:          37:06          Yeah.

Speaker 1:          37:07          We want to make this bond. How do we make that second box, the new bond and the three membered ring? It's an sn two reaction, right? This hobo attacks sigma star backside, so it's an in trob molecular sn two reaction and chloride leaves degenerate. Generate this three membered ring, the three membered ether is called sometimes at Parkside, sometimes oxirane. Some people call it one, some call at the other. And in fact, ETP oxides, uh, are very useful synthetic intermediates because, uh, that, uh, although aro minus is, is a crummy leaving group, right? In this case it's helped by losing the ring strain. So you, it's spring loaded to open up, right? So you can, so you can, uh, you say you can attack here with some nucleophile break the bond. The old binus comes away and this gives away of adding CCO to a nucleophile.

Speaker 1:          38:22          So you bring some nucleophile in and it adds to the nucleophile two carbons and then an oxygen. So synthetic chemists often think, what is it? If I, if I want to get this product, that's something plus CCO, how could I do that? Ethylene oxide, right? That epoxide can do it. And in fact, we're going to talk more about that as a synthetic intermediate later. For example, that's the stuff from which you make a crown. Ethers does, it has, remember at CCO, see COO CCO, but we'll talk about that a few lectures further on now. First synthetic purposes of particularly useful set of nuclear files is cyanide. A satellite, the thing you get by losing proton from a settled lead and this other type of anti which has an Alpha, uh, an Alpha and I, and it's lost the proton adjacent to carbon units. We talked about that one before.

Speaker 1:          39:25          And the reason these are interesting is because they are nuclear files that form carbon carbon bonds. Most of the things we talked about, uh, replace one functional group by another alleving group goes away. The new one comes in, the new one is typically some something like oxygen or nitrogen, right? But these anti ions have carbon coming in and that means you make a new carbon skeleton. So that's something that's very important in putting together a organic molecules. Now notice that this, that these two both have a PK of nine. So you put the starting material that is the protonated forums have a PK of nine. So you put them in with Bass and you get the anti and it does its trick, right? But a satellite is PK of 25, so you can't use that in water. It would immediately take the proton away from water, right?

Speaker 1:          40:22          So it's a base and it actually tends to do elimination sometimes rather than substitution, right? So you need a stronger base if you want to pull off a proton and do that. So you can do it with sodium amid. Notice that this is the anti and coming from Nh three is the acid and Nh three. Then as the product after it's pulled off this proton, and it is a much, a much stronger base, a much weaker acid, but nine powers of 10 than the acetyl ideas. So you can make it that way. So these could be important in synthesis and we'll see later on in the course how very important, uh, nuclear files that are carbon are in putting molecules together. Now if we look at the rate of the reaction of sodium hydroxide with an [inaudible] bromide for different r groups, and look at the, uh, we're going to look at in a log scale.

Speaker 1:          41:18          So we can cover five powers of 10 and the rate, and it's how much of our br gets converted to Hor per minute. Okay? And we're going to do it in ethanol water, four to one at 55 degrees. And we see a 1% about 10 to the minus two is of, of, of uh, of uh, methyl bromide is converted to this ether our apartment until the alcohol per minute. 1% per minute, right? If we make it, uh, ethyl bromide, it's only a 10th of a percent per, uh, per minute. Right? What would you expect for ice approval? Right? Looks good. What do you expect for t butyl? So there's something funny. Something has changed where we went from Methyl Ethyl Eissa propyl butyl

Speaker 2:          42:18          right

Speaker 1:          42:21          now. This was done with 0.01 molar sodium hydroxide getting these rates. But it turns out that the rate of these depends on how much hydroxide there is. That doesn't surprise you. It's sn two. Depends on how much of the nuclear file their eyes, right? Uh, and in fact, if you look at the, at the second order rate constant, which takes into account the concentration of base, then you'll see these fall on a nice curve and it slowed down by crowding the steric hindrance that we talked about before. But you'd expect t beautiful, they'll be down here someplace. In fact, it's up there. Right? And that's because that one is not dependent on hydroxide, right? It's not sn two. It doesn't, the rate doesn't depend both on how lied and the hydroxide. It depends only on the Halide, right? So at the rate determining step, the base hasn't gotten involved yet.

Speaker 1:          43:20          Right? So, and notice that it's accelerated by crowding. When you get to the most crowded one, that mechanism goes really fast, right? It, it happens by a, and it could happen because the cad ion is more stable when it's more substituted, right? It's also accelerated by a polar solvent. If you try a solvent that stock polar, it's harder to make ions in it, right? But the ethanol and water is, is a reasonably polar solvent. So this is the sn one reaction as opposed to sn two and this a categorization was was a formulated sn one sn two in England and in London and uh, in the 1930s by Hughes, an end goal. That rate actually wasn't measured at that temperature. They've measured at a lower temperature and figured out what it would be at this temperature. Okay. This is how much is converted to Hor, but some of the starting material is not converted to Hor.

Speaker 1:          44:27          Some of it undergoes elimination. So at this stage, 19%, so about one fifth of the product is in fact the elimination product, e to the base of tax, the adjacent hydrogen, rather than waiting for it to ionize. And we know it's e two because the amount you get depends on how much hydroxide you put in there, the amount, the rate of forming the alcohol, the rate of the substitution doesn't depend on the hydroxide, but the rate of farming the alkene does depend on the hydroxide. So you change the rate, the ratio of the products by changing the hydroxide concentration. So now you can have sn one and d one as well. Now in that case, in the case we just talked about, if you put more hydroxide in the starting material goes away more rapidly, right? Because that the elimination is dependent on hydroxide. But in the case here where it's cyanide that's doing, that's the High Hobo, it's doing the attacking. You find that you get not only the cyanide substitution, but you also get substitution by water. Right? Now, this the product ratio depends on how much cyanide you put in. That doesn't surprise you. You put in more cyanide. The formation of this product is faster, right? But the rate doesn't change.

Speaker 1:          45:58          The rate of destroying the starting with Daryl doesn't change when you do this. Can everybody see how that could be? How could you change the products but not change the rate?

Speaker 2:          46:15          Matt,

Speaker 1:          46:26          let's try it here. So we have this starting material and these two products. So we're going to draw a reaction, coordinate diagram to get from the starting material to other products. Okay. Here we formed as an sn one intermediate cad I on. All right? And then it goes on. If there's cyanide around to give that product or with water to give that product. Well, what determines the rate of the process? What's the rate determining step? The Red One, right? That happens before you decide which product you'll get. Now if you have more cyanide in there, more of it, we'll go this way, right? So you can change the products without changing the rate if you have this cat high and intermediate. So if the product is determine after the rate by competition for the short lived and I cad I am. So that's evidence that you have a cat.

Speaker 1:          47:21          I ended RBD yet in this substitution. Now here's a, uh, silver nitrate helping to pull off the levy group, uh, iodide. But notice what's funny in this case. Whoops. What's funny is I've talked my head off here. Okay. So, um, there are a few more slides that I think it would be helpful to have to make the, uh, the exam, uh, coherent. So since the exams are going to be on Friday, why don't we put a few more of one to the next than, I apologize and let you go now. So we'll do a few more slides next time and then kind of for the exam, and there'll be a review session on Wednesday.
