00:00:00.414 --> 00:00:02.997
(bright music)

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.970
- Bob Epstein is a remarkable person,

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:15.670
he is a Berkeley product,

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.640
he has a PhD from Berkeley,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.087
he has undergraduate
degrees from Berkeley,

00:00:19.087 --> 00:00:21.410
he had a PhD in engineering,

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.454
he has an undergraduate degree
in music among other things?

00:00:24.454 --> 00:00:26.400
(background noise drowns out other sounds)

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.750
A minor in music, okay,
so a minor in music.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.490
And what's neat about Bob is that

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.810
he is a technological innovator

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.190
so he was present at the
creation of relational databases

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:42.200
and also SQL language which of course

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.500
is a really important step
forward in trying to find ways

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.710
to store and access data.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.360
So he's a technological innovator

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.730
but he's also an entrepreneur.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.070
So he started a company
Sybase which helped

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.680
implement that technology and get people

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.600
around the world using it.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.140
And then thirdly, he's also
a policy and entrepreneur

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:05.540
and a person who's put
together all these things

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.130
and come up with new ideas about

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.090
how do we can make the
world a better place.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.580
And in that capacity, he is co-founder

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.700
of environmental entrepreneurs called E2.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.760
And E2 was very instrumental in helping

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.890
to lay the groundwork
for the passage of AB32

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.050
which is the path-breaking legislation

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.403
that's really put
California at the forefront,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.538
it was respect to energy conservation

00:01:30.538 --> 00:01:32.190
and changing the way we think

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.700
about using energy in the world.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.700
So Bob has been a technological,
a business entrepreneur

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:41.260
and also a policy entrepreneur.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.039
And I think that's very Berkeley,

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:46.180
that's the kind of people
we produce who can do it all

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:47.910
and who put all those things together.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.240
And as you'll see here today when he goes

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.990
through his presentation, he drool upon

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.150
all of those talents
in the work that he did

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.780
to try to think about
how to change the way

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.680
we approach energy and how we try to deal

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.580
with the problems of climate change.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.180
So Bob is also by the way a member

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.240
of the Goldman School Board of Advisors

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.500
and we're really lucky to have him.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.410
He's been very helpful to
us, he in fact was the person

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.890
who helped start on the
way to our third building

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.200
that we're building, just nearby,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.350
where the parking lot is behind me.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.550
And Bob helped me sit
down with a spreadsheet

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.090
and explained to me what was going on

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.150
with financing a building like that

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.030
and helped us figure out how to do it.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.080
And so I give you Bob Epstein

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.850
who is really an extraordinary person.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.850
A person who has brought
lots of thinking thought

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:50.900
in just lots of new ways of
approaching policy problems

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.560
and who will tell you about
that today in his talk.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.436
So Bob Epstein.

00:02:55.436 --> 00:02:58.170
(students applauding).

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.003
- I have mine.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.480
Thank you Dean Brady, I
appreciate the nice comments.

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.201
This talk has a long origin

00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:11.170
but having looking at a 10
year anniversary of AB32,

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.520
it was passed in 2006 and in 2016,

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.580
the goals were achieved four
years ahead of schedule.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.370
How many governments do that?

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:22.710
Of course many do but it's always good

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.630
when the local government can do that.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.150
So I tried to look at, well,
so what did we think in 2006

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.310
and what really happened?

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.510
'Cause that's an interesting point.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:35.220
So I'm going to spend a
little bit of time on that.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.430
But then given all the
climate news that happened

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:38.650
in the last year, I'm gonna talk

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.540
about how we get to 1.5 degrees.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:45.660
How we don't exceed that
target and more importantly,

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.730
what's the role of
California and all of this?

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.000
What should we be doing and not be doing?

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.280
I'm gonna give you lots of opinions,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.430
a bunch of facts, feel free
to challenge all of them.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.050
But before I get started I
wanna recognize two people

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:01.050
that were very much part of the bill.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.190
And that's Adrienne Ovod here.

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.120
Adrian was Fran Pavley's
legislative person on the bill

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.280
and kind of they had
person behind the scenes

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.370
that we worked with.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.280
I guess every day if not every hour

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.020
for a year or so (laughs).

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:22.020
And then Diane Doucet who
also was instrumental in this.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.720
One thing you'll learn is
sometimes it's easy to pass a bill

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.400
but it's hard to implement it.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.730
So in the first two
years, that was the time

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.440
when the opposition was gonna
try to take the bill apart

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.520
and Diane was instrumental in organizing

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:34.970
the business community and still is.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.010
She's not looking at me though

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:37.431
but that's as Diane right here.

00:04:37.431 --> 00:04:38.264
(students laughing)

00:04:38.264 --> 00:04:39.610
So I just I rarely get a chance

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.370
to acknowledge these two
amazing people in person

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.350
in front of an audience on recording.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:47.360
So it's now permanently known
(students laughing)

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.300
and of course if I say
anything out of line,

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.510
they will immediately correct me.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.650
Now a couple of surprises in here,

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.251
there'll be a surprise every 15 minutes.

00:04:56.251 --> 00:04:57.100
(students laughing)

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.380
Now you'll probably all wanna
know what the surprise is

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:02.172
and it hasn't, it's only
been 10 minutes, right.

00:05:02.172 --> 00:05:06.120
So I'm not really covering
the science of climate change.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.310
However, a very good
friend of mine has written

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.670
the world's best book on that topic.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:14.320
It's called the Global Warming Primer.

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:15.820
It's by Jeffrey Bennett,

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:19.360
he's at the University
of Colorado in Boulder.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.640
I brought six copies, every
15 minutes approximately,

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.234
one will be given away.

00:05:24.234 --> 00:05:25.180
(students laughing)

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.140
There's a hidden jury in
the room that will decide

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.470
when a question or a comment
or even a facial expression

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:34.411
rises to the level of worthiness.

00:05:34.411 --> 00:05:35.760
(students laughing)

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.420
At that point one of the
books will be given away.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:42.610
For the rest of you, I thought
maybe six people would come,

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.124
otherwise I would have brought more.

00:05:44.124 --> 00:05:45.600
(students laughing)

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:48.040
For the rest of you, I'll
give you the reference.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:50.660
But this not only explains the science

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.210
and easy to understand ways,

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.850
it also explains how to
refute the climate deniers

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.310
and all of the claims behind that.

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:00.170
So it's quite a quite a good read.

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.763
So that's the background.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.933
So let's dig in.

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:09.540
So we'll start with the good news.

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:14.080
So the goal of AB32 in
2006 when it was approved

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.140
by the legislature in a bipartisan manner,

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.843
that was a Republican, that voted for.

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:21.063
(students laughing)

00:06:21.063 --> 00:06:21.970
Was to get...

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:24.347
Just testing to see if
you can hear me (mumbles).

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.160
But we'll cover that,
there's actually a stronger

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.710
bipartisan support now than
there was at that time.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.470
The goal was by 2020 to get emissions

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:39.070
back to 1990 levels or lower.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.350
So you can see on the chart here,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.350
a California's GDP, our
economic growth kept going up

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.580
during this whole period.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.523
It actually grew faster than
the United States overall.

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:55.360
Population grows steadily in California,

00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:58.380
40 million now is about 38
million when we started this,

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.020
greenhouse gas emissions dropped

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.770
and of course the divisor here,

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:04.000
greenhouse gas emissions per capita

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.970
and per GDP continued to go down.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.723
Hurray, right, that's great news.

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.759
You can applaud.

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:16.160
(students applauding)

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.160
Okay, and just to make a fine
point on this that in 1990,

00:07:21.703 --> 00:07:25.830
we were at 431 Million
Metric Tons of emissions

00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:31.653
in the state and in 2016, we're at 429.

00:07:33.232 --> 00:07:35.260
So the details of this, are all

00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:38.030
in the Air Resources Board inventory

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:39.880
that was printed last summer.

00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:43.610
And so I felt like I
should have put together

00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:46.210
a list of references
and I forgot to do that.

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.550
So I will do that and give it to Borah

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:49.810
and make it available.

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:52.440
But that's the source of this data.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.970
So let's look at what actually
worked in this time period.

00:07:56.970 --> 00:07:58.810
The first of all is electric power

00:07:58.810 --> 00:08:01.570
through renewables overachieved.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:03.330
What we thought would happen.

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:07.680
So in this time frame, we're
now up to six gigawatts

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:11.040
of wind capacity, 10
gigawatts of utility solar,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:13.660
five gigawatts of rooftop solar.

00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:15.840
So you can see that the
electric power curve

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:19.920
in terms of emissions
has dropped, you know,

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:24.130
started peaked here in 2008,

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:28.110
started steadily dropping,
it's dropping very quickly now.

00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:31.920
So that's I would say, it's
a clear over achievement.

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:35.490
And I'll show you later that solar

00:08:35.490 --> 00:08:38.650
with storage and windless storage

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:40.503
is now cheaper than natural gas.

00:08:41.490 --> 00:08:44.670
So that's an important scenario behind it.

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:48.540
If we look at liquid fuels,
there's a program called

00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:50.900
the LCFS, the Low Carbon Fuel Standard,

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.570
of course you already all knew that

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:53.670
but I just thought I'd prove to you

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.763
that I knew it stood for also.

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:01.000
And what this required is that
the greenhouse gas content

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.470
in fuel had to drop by 10% by 2020.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.480
The way that's measured of course

00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:10.000
is in grams per mega Joule.

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.890
Now you all know furlongs
per fortnight for example,

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:16.530
as a unit of measure,
so grams per mega Joule,

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.040
gram of CO2, a mega Joule
unit of work in the vehicle.

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.100
It's a way of normalizing
all vehicles and everything.

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:26.800
So you have a way of
comparing heavy duty trucks

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.610
to you know, light duty cars.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:33.680
So this was also a huge
success in terms of reducing

00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:38.260
the greenhouse gas content
of the fuel, that was good.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:40.460
California has always
been good in efficiency,

00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.760
so that was a great success.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:45.130
Transportation fuel usage was pretty good

00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:46.913
while oil prices were high.

00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:49.830
And then oil prices dropped,

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:52.050
will show you what that looks like.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:53.620
The other thing that really counts here

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:57.660
is 10 years experience of
taking an entire economy,

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.270
the fifth largest one in the world

00:09:59.270 --> 00:10:01.660
and figuring out how to operate it

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.520
and regulate it and make it all work

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.010
with all the moving parts.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.810
That's huge, there are very
few places know how to do that.

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.370
And the other thing is 14
years of political support

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:16.180
for something that takes 50 years to fix.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:18.530
By alternative, you could
think of health care.

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:21.290
Well the support moves in and out,

00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:23.900
so having a stable political environment

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.250
and during this time period
the entire legislation

00:10:27.250 --> 00:10:29.633
turned over because of term limits.

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:34.520
Maybe there's somebody still
left who has voted on in 2006

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:36.240
but I can't think of who it is,

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:38.210
So it's a complete turnover and that.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.160
So all of the legislators could say,

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.902
that was somebody else who did that,

00:10:41.902 --> 00:10:44.700
that's not my bill.

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:47.110
So we had, and we'll talk
about how we dealt with that.

00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:49.423
So that's what worked quite a bit.

00:10:50.270 --> 00:10:53.473
Okay, anyone wanna ask the first question?

00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:58.313
Alright, well that 15, oh yes.

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:00.763
- [Student] Is there any research

00:11:00.763 --> 00:11:03.310
into why the transportation
first (mumbles)?

00:11:03.310 --> 00:11:07.010
- Yes, there is, I'll
show you that very soon.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:09.726
But because you're willing
to ask the first question,

00:11:09.726 --> 00:11:11.090
you get the first book.

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.524
Congratulations sir.

00:11:12.524 --> 00:11:14.930
(students applauding)

00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:17.740
Okay the ice has been
broken, you know it's safe

00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:20.210
to ask any question you want.

00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:24.360
Okay, so if we look at
Californians emissions by detail

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.850
and you could spend a
long time on this chart,

00:11:26.850 --> 00:11:29.480
let's first talk about the big bars.

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:32.410
Transportation is the largest source

00:11:32.410 --> 00:11:33.660
of emissions in California.

00:11:33.660 --> 00:11:38.660
It's about 40% and it's not
getting a lot better quickly.

00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.140
In that you can look at
the biggest portion of that

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:42.833
which is passenger vehicles.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:45.520
So I think there's 1.6 cars

00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:46.870
per licensed driver in (mumbles).

00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:49.710
It's some number like
that, it's more than one.

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.120
There's a lot of people driving,

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:53.720
either because they like to drive

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:56.770
or because there's no
alternative to get to work

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:58.160
or you can't afford the housing

00:11:58.160 --> 00:11:59.720
so you buy a house in Tracy

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.580
and you drive to San Francisco every day.

00:12:01.580 --> 00:12:03.340
So there's plenty of reasons

00:12:04.260 --> 00:12:07.260
why there's a lot of
passenger miles in California.

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.260
That's a big part, the heavy-duty trucks

00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.940
is the other big part then there's some

00:12:10.940 --> 00:12:12.960
rounding errors on the top.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:17.960
If we look at electric power
in this time frame of 2016,

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.290
then when you have in- state power

00:12:20.290 --> 00:12:24.290
and then you have the
out-of-state imports coming in.

00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:26.360
You know we're down to 1% coal,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.700
so it's mostly natural gas and renewables

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.130
and nuclear which we'll
talk about a little bit.

00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:33.870
There's still 10% there.

00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:36.000
Then you have all the industrial sources,

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:38.490
the refineries being
the single largest one,

00:12:38.490 --> 00:12:40.450
you have industrial manufacturing,

00:12:40.450 --> 00:12:42.510
the extraction of oil and gas.

00:12:42.510 --> 00:12:45.230
Sometimes it's hard to
remember that California

00:12:45.230 --> 00:12:48.870
used to be the third
largest oil producing state

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.030
in the United States
behind Texas and Alaska.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:53.750
Anyone remember who bumped us off

00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:55.100
and moved us in the fourth?

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:58.213
Ah c'mon this is an easy one.

00:13:00.302 --> 00:13:02.104
And now think north.

00:13:02.104 --> 00:13:02.937
(background voice drowns other sounds)

00:13:02.937 --> 00:13:03.770
There we go, alright.

00:13:03.770 --> 00:13:06.460
So North Dakota in a 10-year period

00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.400
totally outstripped us through fracking.

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:12.280
We'll see if they like it when
they're done but that's it.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.190
You have other things like landfills.

00:13:14.190 --> 00:13:16.580
And then an interesting factoid

00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:18.790
they'll be really great at
your next cocktail party,

00:13:18.790 --> 00:13:20.550
do you guys do cocktail...

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:21.510
Probably don't.
(students laughing)

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.513
I'm sorry, I showed my age.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.190
Cement, if you took all
the cement production

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.720
in the world and made it a country,

00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.370
it would be the third largest
greenhouse gas emitter.

00:13:34.820 --> 00:13:37.040
Go to it, you'll have a great
time at your next party.

00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:38.330
Yes, you have a question?

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.253
- Okay, so the question is,

00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:43.000
why is transportation so large

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:45.840
when there's so many ways
of making it smaller?

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:49.290
Okay, I'm gonna let Adrienne answer.

00:13:49.290 --> 00:13:52.210
No answer (laughs)
(students laughing)

00:13:52.210 --> 00:13:54.150
I'd say there's a couple
of reasons to look at it.

00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:56.040
One is California historically has had

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.800
very poor public transit infrastructure.

00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:02.150
And if you start out with very poor stuff

00:14:02.150 --> 00:14:04.150
and then you try to put it in afterwards,

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:07.060
it's incredibly expensive
for the land value.

00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.720
So if I look at something like BART

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.350
which is the only way
I get to San Francisco,

00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:13.040
somehow that managed to happen

00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:16.930
but that was the last major
transit project I can think of.

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.950
If you go to San Francisco and
you look at Van Ness Street,

00:14:19.950 --> 00:14:22.160
they're trying to put in
a bus rapid transit lane,

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.310
they're in their third
year of construction

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:26.870
but just to take a
little bit of the street

00:14:26.870 --> 00:14:30.610
and make it two lanes for a bus service.

00:14:30.610 --> 00:14:34.630
So I think if you don't start
out with the design for it,

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:37.010
it's very hard to add
it in after the fact.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:39.850
That's the first reason,
the second reason is oil

00:14:39.850 --> 00:14:42.573
used to be, you know, it's
an oil-producing state.

00:14:43.470 --> 00:14:47.690
So oil here was plentiful,
all the refineries were here.

00:14:47.690 --> 00:14:50.750
It was a great thing to
do and the main problem

00:14:50.750 --> 00:14:54.860
with transport originally
was smog and pollution.

00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.440
So that was that started to be addressed,

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.530
so I think starting from behind,

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:03.030
now we'll talk about how
you fix it going forward.

00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:06.350
But I have no apologies
for California except

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:09.230
when you start out without
thinking about transit,

00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:12.250
it's very hard to add it in afterwards.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:14.363
And my dad who's the city planner,

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:17.130
I grew up in Stockton in the middle there,

00:15:17.130 --> 00:15:19.390
he showed me his, he had two master plans.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:22.250
One is where you do a plan and you design

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.927
for regional growth and the
other is where you don't,

00:15:23.927 --> 00:15:26.350
you say people will be
buying houses in Tracy

00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:27.750
and commuting in San Francisco.

00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:30.270
I said, dad, that's the
stupidest prediction

00:15:30.270 --> 00:15:32.010
I have ever heard.

00:15:32.010 --> 00:15:36.590
And I've apologized them
for years after that.

00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:38.793
Okay, looking at the other items,

00:15:39.932 --> 00:15:42.310
they have agriculture and forestry,

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.300
the largest one being livestock.

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.550
Now for those of you who have any doubts,

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.510
the main source of
emissions from livestock

00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.420
comes from the front
end, not the back end.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.860
Another important cocktail
joke that you might need.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.820
Okay, a residential commercial,

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:01.363
this is the use of natural gas
for heating or for cooking.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:05.660
And then you have them not specified,

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.420
we won't talk about it.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:08.900
so that's where the source...

00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.733
Yes.

00:16:10.830 --> 00:16:13.720
Now, if we look at
solely, first the Question

00:16:13.720 --> 00:16:17.570
is whether residential has
dropped in this time period.

00:16:17.570 --> 00:16:19.587
And what this slide shows is that--

00:16:19.587 --> 00:16:24.070
(background noise drowns other sounds)

00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:25.820
So there has been some improvement

00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.930
between the combination of
commercial and residential.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:33.160
If I was going to predict,
I'd say most of its...

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:34.670
I don't, I could find a detail

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:37.390
but not while everybody's watching.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:38.470
You have some mixture there.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.880
The other thing is that
any new construction

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:44.140
typically picks up in an efficiency.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:45.620
And so if houses get more efficient,

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.110
they use less natural gas for heating.

00:16:48.110 --> 00:16:50.470
You also have efficiency and
well the air conditioning

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:52.070
would show up in another column.

00:16:53.150 --> 00:16:55.810
This is somehow related to a drop

00:16:55.810 --> 00:16:59.630
in the use of natural gas
most likely through efficiency

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:03.000
but I would have to look
at the actual report

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.200
to give you an accurate
answer to that question.

00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:09.560
Okay, so let me talk about
what wasn't part of the plan

00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:12.160
that influenced the results.

00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:14.570
So these are all things,
they're not good or bad,

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:17.850
they just happened and
they influenced the result.

00:17:17.850 --> 00:17:20.220
The first was macroeconomics.

00:17:20.220 --> 00:17:23.740
If we look at where
the drop really started

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.440
to accelerate, it was in 2009.

00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:28.833
So if you damage the economy,

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.140
there will be less economic output,

00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:35.650
there will be less use of resources

00:17:35.650 --> 00:17:39.180
and you will see a drop in
greenhouse gas emissions.

00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.469
It's not a great plan.

00:17:42.469 --> 00:17:43.950
(students laughing)

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:46.423
But it does happen and
the reverse happens.

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:50.163
If the economy is doing
better than your model,

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.440
then if the economy is going faster

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.520
than you're cutting emissions,

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.020
you will see the reverse trend as well.

00:17:56.020 --> 00:18:00.210
So that's the first point, the second is,

00:18:00.210 --> 00:18:03.383
at the time of passage,
if we look back to 2006,

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.500
you know, we're dealing with,

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:10.860
we're getting close to
$100 a barrel for oil

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:14.340
and it peaked at a $160.

00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:17.050
Well at those prices,
all sorts of other things

00:18:17.050 --> 00:18:21.893
become affordable and people
think less about buying an SUV.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:26.800
But when it starts to crash
down like this and the other,

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:29.000
the whole buying, the whole shift

00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.820
in what sort of vehicles
people buy has shifted

00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:34.420
back to trucks and SUVs.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.788
So cheap fossil fuels
at least with the effect

00:18:38.788 --> 00:18:43.360
of these an odd diesel but of crude oil

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.830
had a bad effect.

00:18:46.830 --> 00:18:49.290
Now you have something like fracking.

00:18:49.290 --> 00:18:52.360
So fracking just by
itself made natural gas

00:18:52.360 --> 00:18:55.690
cheaper than coal, is
straightforward to use it

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:59.200
instead of coal, so
effectively what killed off

00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.913
the coal industry in the
United States is dead.

00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.720
It's dying, it's dying at a steady rate,

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:07.000
that hasn't changed in years.

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.040
We'll talk about some attempts

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.380
by various government entities
to try to change that,

00:19:12.380 --> 00:19:13.540
none of that's worked.

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:18.540
Natural gas is so cheap
that that was a huge benefit

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:22.160
behind it but it also works against you,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:25.050
it sort of says well,
in order for renewables

00:19:25.050 --> 00:19:27.440
to be competitive they had to
be cheaper than natural gas.

00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:31.490
So that set the bar for
renewables even harder.

00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:33.500
Now you have things like weather.

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.000
So in 2016, there is huge amounts,

00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.550
you can probably remember
how much it rained

00:19:38.550 --> 00:19:40.470
if you were here, there's a lot of rain

00:19:40.470 --> 00:19:42.660
and a lot of snow, a
lot of really good snow

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:44.880
the powder none of that sierra cement.

00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:48.330
So there was abundant hydro and so hydro

00:19:48.330 --> 00:19:50.550
comes with no emissions.

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:53.200
On a drought year you
don't get that benefit.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.220
And then you have weird like

00:19:56.220 --> 00:20:00.950
the largest refinery was
shut down due to an accident,

00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:02.860
was offline for a year.

00:20:02.860 --> 00:20:04.310
Well that really cut emission

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:08.430
but that's not something you can count on.

00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.010
And then the most amazing thing
at the start of this time,

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.280
California had 20% of its
power coming from nuclear.

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.100
Now I'm not going to comment on whether

00:20:18.196 --> 00:20:19.029
that's a good or a bad thing
but from the perspective

00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:23.170
of a running start, that's
20% with no emissions.

00:20:23.170 --> 00:20:26.840
Half of it, the San Onofre nuclear power

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:31.840
was shut down in 2012, yeah
in 2012, yet we still made it.

00:20:31.870 --> 00:20:34.930
The other half, a Diablo
Canyon will be shut down

00:20:34.930 --> 00:20:37.993
in 2025, is that right?

00:20:38.940 --> 00:20:41.360
So that will have gone from 20% nuclear

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.070
to zero and still made it,

00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:45.650
and still overachieve
the emissions target.

00:20:45.650 --> 00:20:49.380
So my point behind this, is
you can plan all you want

00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:53.240
but the external factors can be 50%

00:20:53.240 --> 00:20:55.550
plus or minus behind this.

00:20:55.550 --> 00:20:58.380
So none of these things, if
you had asked me to predict

00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.380
the price of crude oil, I
would say well, you know,

00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:05.380
no one can do that but I'll
say $200, instead it's 50.

00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:08.740
If you look at the price of natural gas,

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:11.313
well it was $8 per unit.

00:21:12.856 --> 00:21:15.470
When this bill was passed,
I said well at that rate

00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:17.250
you got all these things
that are competitive,

00:21:17.250 --> 00:21:19.063
it drops down below two dollars.

00:21:21.570 --> 00:21:24.060
So thet have these huge factors going on

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:25.560
that weren't part of the plan.

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.530
Yes, okay the question
is whether federal policy

00:21:30.530 --> 00:21:32.380
influences the true price of it?

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.080
Absolutely, as does the avoided cost,

00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:37.020
the social cost of carbon.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.537
So that there are a lot of
factors that you can look at

00:21:39.537 --> 00:21:42.740
and you can see studies to
look at these various things.

00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:44.210
I'm just showing you what the results

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:47.130
were in terms of
emissions and those prices

00:21:47.130 --> 00:21:50.350
are the wholesale prices
that people purchased

00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:51.593
not their true costs.

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:56.650
Does that answer your...

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.944
I mean that's--

00:21:57.944 --> 00:22:00.850
(background noise drowns other sounds)

00:22:00.850 --> 00:22:04.463
I have two hours with the
material and an hour left.

00:22:04.463 --> 00:22:07.490
So I'm not gonna try to answer that

00:22:07.490 --> 00:22:10.330
'cause I'm really not
well-prepared to do it (mumbles).

00:22:10.330 --> 00:22:12.460
I mean your point is valid.

00:22:12.460 --> 00:22:15.840
So let's look at what's
the history in California

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.750
in terms of major laws.

00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:19.260
Now the point I wanna emphasize here,

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.623
every one of these things
is a performance standard.

00:22:23.490 --> 00:22:25.470
So if we look at the first ones, Nox,

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:28.350
not just oxygen emissions from vehicles.

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:31.040
That was the start of
regulating the tailpipes.

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.260
Before that, your car could put anything

00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:35.670
it wanted through its
tailpipe and it could aim it

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:38.040
at any direction, at anybody.

00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:40.530
And if you got too close
you got really sick.

00:22:40.530 --> 00:22:44.430
And if you stayed far away
your whole air basin got sick.

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.210
So these are performance
standards that said,

00:22:46.210 --> 00:22:49.600
this is exactly how much
of each of these toxics

00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:51.420
you're allowed to emit.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.700
And if you exceed that, you
can't sell in California

00:22:54.700 --> 00:22:58.558
even if you're VW, we'll get you.

00:22:58.558 --> 00:22:59.740
(students laughing)

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:04.740
Okay, now in 1977, partly in
response to the energy crisis

00:23:06.010 --> 00:23:09.100
that happened in the early 70s,

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:12.393
California started setting
standards for appliances.

00:23:14.140 --> 00:23:16.820
Those have had a huge impact behind things

00:23:16.820 --> 00:23:18.240
and again their standards they say,

00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:20.700
the emissions for this
size your refrigirating

00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:22.920
you can't use more than
this much electricity

00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:24.890
or you can't sell it in California.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:26.560
Now for the most manufacturers,

00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:28.850
if you can't sell it in California,

00:23:28.850 --> 00:23:31.190
there's not worth making a non Californian

00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:32.513
and a Californian version.

00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:34.870
So they just made it becomes,

00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:37.390
many of these things are
become a national standard.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:40.210
The next year we started
building efficiency standards

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:42.240
also known as Title 24.

00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:45.020
So that said, if you're
building something new,

00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:47.790
there's a minimum threshold that you have

00:23:47.790 --> 00:23:49.510
to be at in terms of efficiency.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:53.030
Then in 2002, not that long
ago, was the first time

00:23:53.030 --> 00:23:55.920
we actually created a
renewable portfolio standard

00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:58.460
which guaranteed a market
for, and I'm gonna call it

00:23:58.460 --> 00:24:02.740
affordable electricity,
seems really expensive now

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:05.400
but it was the starting point behind that.

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:09.820
Then in 2002, California
started the with climate change

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:13.730
And the very first bill that
I've ever worked on in my life

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:16.190
and Fran Pavley when she was a freshman

00:24:16.190 --> 00:24:17.960
assembly member worked on 2002

00:24:17.960 --> 00:24:20.040
as the California clean cars bill,

00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:24.090
it said a standard for how
much greenhouse gas emissions

00:24:24.090 --> 00:24:27.390
could come out of the
tailpipe of a vehicle

00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:32.480
through a long involved process
and a change in presidency,

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:35.026
eventually became a national standard

00:24:35.026 --> 00:24:37.650
and that's where we are today

00:24:37.650 --> 00:24:39.660
with a couple of minor exceptions.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:44.060
2006, then the global
warming solutions Act

00:24:44.060 --> 00:24:47.380
was enacted by the legislature.

00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:52.170
Skip ahead ten years and we're
starting doing the renewals.

00:24:52.170 --> 00:24:56.240
In Fran Pavley's last year,
in office due to term limits

00:24:56.240 --> 00:25:01.010
as a senator, she passed
SB32 just a coincidence

00:25:01.010 --> 00:25:03.350
that it has the same
number I've been told.

00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:08.350
And that set standards for the year 2030

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:13.500
in legislation to be
40% below 1990 levels.

00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:14.797
So that was the next standard.

00:25:14.797 --> 00:25:17.070
But the most important
thing about that bill

00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:20.080
was it got the legislature on record,

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.632
the current legislature
is saying we are behind

00:25:23.632 --> 00:25:26.523
dealing with climate in California.

00:25:27.410 --> 00:25:31.340
The next year we established a legal,

00:25:33.750 --> 00:25:34.800
secured the legalness

00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:39.450
trade system of a price on carbon.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:43.670
Prior to this bill, there was
at least a legal ambiguity

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.800
whether the original legislation was legal

00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:51.210
or included the ability
to set a price on carbon.

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:52.790
The Air board was sure that it did,

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:54.310
many lawyers were sure there did

00:25:54.310 --> 00:25:55.570
and the oil industry was sure

00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:58.470
they would eventually prove them wrong.

00:25:58.470 --> 00:26:00.480
So by passing this bill that took away

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:03.650
all of the legal risk behind it,

00:26:03.650 --> 00:26:07.690
it also got eight Republicans on board,

00:26:07.690 --> 00:26:09.400
enthusiastically on board.

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:12.150
So it changed the dynamics,

00:26:12.150 --> 00:26:13.760
the political dynamics by saying,

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:16.260
this is a broad accepted targets

00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:18.270
that we're trying to do, it isn't narrow,

00:26:18.270 --> 00:26:21.410
it isn't just the enviromental caucus

00:26:21.410 --> 00:26:23.960
which is much smaller now
than it was 10 years ago.

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:26.730
If we look at this
picture, there's Gray Davis

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:29.652
signing the first bill, there's
me when my hair was black.

00:26:29.652 --> 00:26:30.485
(students laughing)

00:26:30.485 --> 00:26:35.010
There's Fran Pavley, Josa
Midian, many other other friends.

00:26:37.380 --> 00:26:40.610
So for those of you at the Goldman School,

00:26:40.610 --> 00:26:42.680
I'm saying there's nothing
more satisfying for me

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:45.750
in my life, besides my family,

00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:48.370
if I go the next step on behind it,

00:26:48.370 --> 00:26:53.250
of when the California
cleans cars bill was passed

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.800
which is my first time ever
trying to work on something

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:57.360
and I looked down the hallway

00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:00.070
at the auto industry representatives

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:02.810
and they were, you know,
they weren't bummed out,

00:27:02.810 --> 00:27:04.180
they were paid to do their job,

00:27:04.180 --> 00:27:06.760
it didn't get it done, they'll
still be employed whatever.

00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.834
And just thought about
what was accomplished,

00:27:09.834 --> 00:27:11.810
it was the best feeling ever

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:15.490
and I hope you all experience
that multiple times.

00:27:15.490 --> 00:27:18.830
That's my wish for all of you in policy

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:20.480
'cause that's why you're here.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:24.240
Okay, so now I'm gonna move to the future.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:28.120
And first of all, we're gonna
start about the one sentence,

00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:30.923
definition of the strategy
for the energy sector.

00:27:31.890 --> 00:27:35.450
As we saw, there's lots of
other sources of emissions,

00:27:35.450 --> 00:27:39.390
decarbonize electricity and
electrify everything you can.

00:27:39.390 --> 00:27:41.660
That's the strategy, okay.

00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:45.090
So let's look at where this came from.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:47.510
If we back up and this chart is taken,

00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.600
this is not a non-government
chart, this is from the Lazard

00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.670
and this is an attempt
to look apples to apples

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:58.910
at all energy generation and
try to compare them equally.

00:27:58.910 --> 00:28:01.020
So it's called the
levelized cost of energy.

00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:03.380
It says, "If you're gonna
build a new facility

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.400
and run it for 20 years,
what are all of your costs

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.620
during that 20 year period
including the fuel?"

00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:13.280
So you have to forecast
what natural gas will cost

00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:17.060
or what coal or nuclear,
what the cost of capital is?

00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.250
So it's an attempt to take everything

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.260
and put it on the same playing field.

00:28:21.260 --> 00:28:24.170
So people who argue over these things,

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.850
argue over the assumptions but the idea

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.750
is to try to make them all look the same.

00:28:28.750 --> 00:28:32.170
So if we look at this item right here

00:28:32.170 --> 00:28:35.877
which is utility scale
solar, it starts out at $359

00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:43.700
in 2009 and it ends up down here at $50.

00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.923
These are measured in per megawatt-hour.

00:28:47.553 --> 00:28:49.600
So it ends up down here at $50.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:54.100
If we look at wind, it had
less distance to travel,

00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:58.600
started at 135 comes down here to $45.

00:28:58.600 --> 00:29:00.670
Now the nearest competitor

00:29:00.670 --> 00:29:03.580
is efficiency gas combined cycle.

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:05.350
So this is natural gas

00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:07.650
and a combined cycle large operations.

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:09.520
It hasn't changed much.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:14.520
It (mumbles) $83 10 years
ago and it's $60 now.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:18.230
It's not that the
equipment got any cheaper,

00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:21.050
it's natural gas drop in price.

00:29:21.050 --> 00:29:24.680
And you have to look at what
the forecast is going forward.

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:29.680
Now let's look at coal, it's a $102.

00:29:30.150 --> 00:29:32.550
So if you had to decide whether
you can build a coal plant

00:29:32.550 --> 00:29:34.650
or a solar, and I realized
they're not the same thing,

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:36.200
we'll come to that in a minute,

00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:39.680
it's coal is twice the price.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:44.680
Now, if we look at nuclear,
it's higher than that.

00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.330
The reason why is the
incredibly high cost of capital

00:29:48.330 --> 00:29:50.410
and the incredible high uncertainty

00:29:50.410 --> 00:29:52.010
of whether you'll ever finish it

00:29:53.050 --> 00:29:56.240
because in the history United
States in the last 30 years,

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:58.120
there hasn't been a new one finished,

00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.570
there have been some started.

00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:03.813
This is the state of things in 2017.

00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:09.183
Now that has an interesting effect.

00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:14.270
It says that there's been
now five gigawatt hours

00:30:14.270 --> 00:30:16.340
of rooftop solar.

00:30:16.340 --> 00:30:19.510
So let me show you what's
called the duck curve.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:20.910
Now first of all, can anyone tell

00:30:20.910 --> 00:30:23.694
why it's called the "duck" curve?

00:30:23.694 --> 00:30:25.020
(students laughing)

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:25.853
Who can?

00:30:25.853 --> 00:30:26.833
Who can tell me why?

00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:29.154
Yes.

00:30:29.154 --> 00:30:29.987
(background noise drowns other sounds)

00:30:29.987 --> 00:30:31.630
That's right, that's right.
(students laughing)

00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:33.420
We have another winner,

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.029
round of applause for the young lady.

00:30:36.029 --> 00:30:38.850
There we go, there we go.
(students applauding)

00:30:38.850 --> 00:30:41.670
Nice job, now let's look at this "duck"

00:30:41.670 --> 00:30:42.970
in a little bit of detail.

00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.420
If we back back up to 2013
and this is looking at

00:30:47.420 --> 00:30:49.780
a typical spring day in California

00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:52.760
and this line looks at demand.

00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:57.080
So you know, it starts
out at 19,000 megawatts

00:30:57.080 --> 00:30:58.260
and it runs through most of the day.

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.170
And then near the end
of the day, it goes up

00:31:00.170 --> 00:31:02.020
because people turn
their air conditioners on

00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:02.970
when they get home.

00:31:03.890 --> 00:31:07.070
Now what happens when
you put rooftop solar

00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:09.513
on your house behind the meter?

00:31:10.788 --> 00:31:12.120
You know, if you're on the
other side of the meter

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:15.210
and you're the independent
systems operator,

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:17.880
it looks like demand's dropping, alright,

00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:19.210
'cause all it knows is you're drawing

00:31:19.210 --> 00:31:21.253
less demand from the grid.

00:31:22.170 --> 00:31:24.300
So that's what happens here,

00:31:24.300 --> 00:31:28.123
so if we look at the
actual curve here on 2017,

00:31:30.150 --> 00:31:32.604
actual usage, if we look at
the amount of electricity

00:31:32.604 --> 00:31:34.810
(mumbles) being used in
California is up here.

00:31:34.810 --> 00:31:37.490
But if we look at how much
was being drawn from the grid,

00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:40.070
it's down here hence the "duck"

00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:42.133
as you correctly identified.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.330
Now what happens around five six o'clock

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:50.700
when it's not dark yet
but your solar panels

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.820
are no longer directly in the Sun,

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:54.210
the sun's at a lower angle,

00:31:54.210 --> 00:31:56.530
the tree has come and blocked you?

00:31:56.530 --> 00:31:58.530
Well, suddenly you see this huge demand.

00:31:58.530 --> 00:32:00.543
So for the last three hours,

00:32:01.490 --> 00:32:03.020
suddenly have this three hour ramp,

00:32:03.020 --> 00:32:08.020
you have to get 13,000 megawatts
from somebody in a hurry.

00:32:10.762 --> 00:32:13.720
So there's a couple
issues with renewables,

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:15.310
there's three basically.

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:19.933
The first is that demand
and generation are shifted.

00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:24.091
So you have to account
for the shift behind that

00:32:24.091 --> 00:32:24.950
and I'm gonna show you how about Hawaii

00:32:24.950 --> 00:32:27.850
has done to solve that
problem, they have sun there.

00:32:27.850 --> 00:32:29.473
That's one problem, the second is,

00:32:29.473 --> 00:32:31.110
that sometimes you can have a storm

00:32:31.110 --> 00:32:33.870
that will go on for a week
in the middle of winter

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:38.870
and the wind is too high
to run the the windmills

00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:40.840
and there isn't enough sunlight.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.520
So you've got to go...

00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:43.830
So you have two storage problems,

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:45.690
one is the time shifting one

00:32:45.690 --> 00:32:48.960
and the other is that there's
just no power anywhere

00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.080
and people want the lights on.

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.960
So those are the two, I
said there were three,

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.360
but those are the two big
issues to deal with in solar.

00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:01.133
So of course one of the
answers is battery storage.

00:33:02.020 --> 00:33:04.270
So let's look at Hawaii.

00:33:04.270 --> 00:33:08.550
Now Hawaii's a great example
because prior to solar

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:11.820
and wind, a 100% of Hawaii's electricity

00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:14.060
came from what fuel source?

00:33:14.060 --> 00:33:16.060
Who can read this slide?

00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:16.893
Quick, diesel.

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:24.200
Right, 'cause it's just like
the North Slope of Alaska.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.760
If you want to have electricity,

00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:28.210
you have a diesel generator
and that's how it gets done.

00:33:28.210 --> 00:33:31.480
Well how much diesel is
locally produced in Hawaii?

00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:34.080
Very close, probably zero.

00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:36.620
Okay, so it all gets shipped over

00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:37.453
and I'll guess done there.

00:33:37.453 --> 00:33:42.220
So it's incredibly expensive,
so just the cost of the fuel

00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:46.090
for diesel is about 25 cents in Hawaii

00:33:46.090 --> 00:33:48.163
to produce one kilowatt.

00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:51.490
Now to run that 100 watt
light bulb for 10 hours

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:55.390
cost you 25 cents in fuel.

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:57.670
So if we look at the most recent project,

00:33:57.670 --> 00:34:00.130
this was announced January 8th,

00:34:00.130 --> 00:34:03.090
there were seven solar projects awarded,

00:34:03.090 --> 00:34:08.090
260 megawatts of solar but
it comes with 16 gigawatts

00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:11.010
of storage, they handle the time-shifting

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:14.750
and a guaranteed price
between eight and 12 cents.

00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:17.590
So solar with storage in Hawaii

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:20.360
is 1/2 the price of the alternative.

00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.890
What's the probability that Hawaii

00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:23.340
will be a 100% renewable?

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.780
Will the first state 100% renewable?

00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.380
Well, I'd better book on that

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.270
and I have three left so are four left.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:31.663
So I can afford to do it.

00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:36.210
But this is a good
example where if you have

00:34:36.210 --> 00:34:40.183
a predictability of things and
you have a high initial cost,

00:34:41.612 --> 00:34:44.330
the transformation is there already.

00:34:44.330 --> 00:34:46.960
If we look at every other
state having to do it,

00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.620
you've got different cost equations

00:34:48.620 --> 00:34:50.190
but that's what you need to do, yes.

00:34:50.190 --> 00:34:53.040
Okay, so the question is how
do they guarantee a price?

00:34:53.040 --> 00:34:55.110
They guarantee that
price and they guarantee

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:58.070
a minimum number, a minimum
amount of generation

00:34:58.070 --> 00:35:02.040
based on the average amount of
solar radiation in that side.

00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:04.130
And then they downgraded,
they assumed that

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:05.470
there'll be some decay.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:06.800
And so they'd come up and say,

00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:09.300
well, we can guarantee you
this much at this price

00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:12.668
and the advantage of solar
is, what's the fuel cost?

00:35:12.668 --> 00:35:15.650
Zero, so you have your capital investment,

00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:16.960
you have the reliability equipment

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.520
and you have the Sun predictability

00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:22.570
and you have 50 years worth
of information on the Sun.

00:35:22.570 --> 00:35:25.480
So it's a very low risk that come up

00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.263
with this guarantee, yes?

00:35:27.263 --> 00:35:31.846
(background noise drowns other sounds)

00:35:33.350 --> 00:35:34.700
Okay, I'm not an expert on Hawaii

00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:36.480
but I doubt that there's any natural gas

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:37.710
'cause you would have to bring it in,

00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:38.993
there's probably propane.

00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:42.320
So if you're like me and
you really wanna cook

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:44.030
on something other than electric,

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:45.740
you'll have a propane stuff.

00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:47.460
So there's probably still propane

00:35:47.460 --> 00:35:49.389
coming into this state, yes?

00:35:49.389 --> 00:35:51.340
(background noise drowns other sounds)

00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:52.844
Yeah, okay.

00:35:52.844 --> 00:35:57.427
(background noise drowns other sounds)

00:35:59.167 --> 00:36:01.300
It would have had to, it's
the all-in cost to build it.

00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.890
So it would have had to
include some prediction

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:06.260
on subsidies but as you know,

00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.599
the production tax credit expires.

00:36:08.599 --> 00:36:11.880
So I would be willing
to bet that they assume

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.023
you get the subsidy until it expires.

00:36:14.900 --> 00:36:17.000
And then nobody's gonna
take the political risk

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.786
that it'll be renewed.

00:36:18.786 --> 00:36:19.619
(background noise drowns other sounds)

00:36:19.619 --> 00:36:22.920
They would change a
little, yeah they would.

00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:26.173
They would but now this is looking at

00:36:26.173 --> 00:36:28.770
a levelized price for 20 years,

00:36:28.770 --> 00:36:31.150
so I doubt it would change much.

00:36:31.150 --> 00:36:33.623
Those prices down there
would have been affected.

00:36:34.730 --> 00:36:37.173
But the subsidies certainly played a role.

00:36:38.290 --> 00:36:41.700
Okay, so let's talk about
moving forward here.

00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:45.130
And look at what California
is gonna try to do

00:36:45.130 --> 00:36:47.360
and then how do we get this done.

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:51.280
So if we look at where we
are right now in, you know,

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:54.130
2016 is the last full year of data,

00:36:54.130 --> 00:36:56.780
we've got a four year head
start on the next target

00:36:56.780 --> 00:37:00.300
which is gonna be helpful
because, see how that line

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.910
looks a little steeper than the last one.

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:07.910
so the line from 1990, the
line to get to the 2020 target

00:37:08.980 --> 00:37:13.480
was about a 1% per year drop in emissions.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.970
The line from 2020 to 2030

00:37:15.970 --> 00:37:19.500
is a little over 3%
drop emissions per year,

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.130
something we've never
done without a recession.

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:24.890
And that Air Resources Board

00:37:24.890 --> 00:37:28.605
did not plan a recession as
part of their scoping plan.

00:37:28.605 --> 00:37:29.883
(students laughing)

00:37:29.883 --> 00:37:31.280
So you've got a that target moves you down

00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:34.920
to 260 Million Metric Tons.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:39.803
And that's on the path
for the two-degree target.

00:37:40.760 --> 00:37:44.550
If you wanna match the
IPCC target of 1.5 degrees,

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:49.310
then we'd have to drop
down to 249 instead of 260,

00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:52.060
not a huge difference for California

00:37:52.930 --> 00:37:54.000
assuming you can do that.

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.280
The other thing is the
original 2050 target

00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.620
was not in legislation but it was an edict

00:38:01.620 --> 00:38:06.620
by then Governor Schwarzenegger
of get it to the 80%

00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:12.220
below 1990 by 2050, which if
you include population growth,

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:16.120
is actually a 90% cut.

00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:20.113
The IPCC has said we
need to be zero by 2045,

00:38:21.930 --> 00:38:25.090
so Governor Brown in his
last couple of months

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:28.190
made that the target if
I remember correctly.

00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:30.690
So this target has moved down to here,

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:34.983
that target could move a little
but those are the targets.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:38.603
So let's look at what's
called the scoping plan.

00:38:39.900 --> 00:38:44.010
So what California does is
every two years produce,

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:47.230
and the last one was in
2017, a scoping plan.

00:38:47.230 --> 00:38:49.130
This was published in November.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:50.560
This lists all of the (mumbles),

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:53.089
what all the targets are,
what all the measures are,

00:38:53.089 --> 00:38:56.030
what are the risks
associated with each one?

00:38:56.030 --> 00:38:58.330
What's the economic analysis?

00:38:58.330 --> 00:39:00.610
And then that becomes the guideline

00:39:00.610 --> 00:39:04.393
and then they do regulations
to match the scoping plan.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.900
So I borrowed this, this is page 21 or 28

00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.530
from the scoping plan
and this is looking at

00:39:13.530 --> 00:39:17.550
over that 10-year period, the
aggregate amount of reductions

00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:19.160
in different categories.

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:23.520
So if we look at this, here's electricity

00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.200
going to a 50% renewable,

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.730
it's 16 out of this big number, 660.

00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:37.720
The reduction in transportation fuels,

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:40.860
not in transportation,
just the fuels, it's 25,

00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:45.820
energy efficiency will add 64
mobile source improvements 64,

00:39:45.820 --> 00:39:48.590
then you've got these two huge categories,

00:39:48.590 --> 00:39:51.720
217 from the short-lived
Climate Pollutants.

00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:54.930
This is trying to reduce
the methane in California

00:39:56.020 --> 00:40:00.630
and also the high potential
ones that have the long names

00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:02.610
that I can't pronounce but (mumbles)

00:40:02.610 --> 00:40:05.210
I wrote them down, so you'll
see the names in a minute.

00:40:05.210 --> 00:40:08.890
And then 236 from cap-and-trade.

00:40:08.890 --> 00:40:11.043
So this is where my problems start.

00:40:12.723 --> 00:40:17.270
So let me give let me just
give you two scenarios, okay?

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:20.190
One scenario says we can
guarantee the reductions

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:22.870
but we have no idea what the prices are.

00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:24.730
The other is we can guarantee the prices

00:40:24.730 --> 00:40:26.930
but we have no idea
what the reductions are.

00:40:26.930 --> 00:40:28.630
Which one do you want to vote for?

00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.550
Right.
(students laughing)

00:40:32.550 --> 00:40:34.060
So you want to kind of...

00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.239
Who said neither?

00:40:35.239 --> 00:40:36.072
- [Student] Me.

00:40:36.072 --> 00:40:39.500
- Oh, alright, that was
exactly the right answer.

00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:44.050
So here we go it's been 15 minutes.

00:40:44.050 --> 00:40:46.476
Alright, round of applause.
(students applauding)

00:40:46.476 --> 00:40:48.676
Here go, come on,
(mumbles) congratulations.

00:40:51.050 --> 00:40:53.220
Okay, gotta ask more questions.

00:40:53.220 --> 00:40:58.020
Okay, so they're both
horrible alternatives, right?

00:40:58.020 --> 00:40:59.320
So what California is trying to do

00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.750
is split the difference.

00:41:00.750 --> 00:41:03.030
It's saying, the direct measures

00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:05.890
we know exactly how
much you have to reduce

00:41:05.890 --> 00:41:08.130
or you can't do business in California.

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:11.430
And those have all generally
worked out just fine.

00:41:11.430 --> 00:41:13.840
Then there's the other measures which is,

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:15.300
well we don't know how you're gonna do it,

00:41:15.300 --> 00:41:18.200
but you can only emit this much.

00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:20.370
And if you can't figure out yourself,

00:41:20.370 --> 00:41:22.850
find somebody who can
and buy it from them.

00:41:22.850 --> 00:41:25.550
So that's the general
notion of cap-and-trade.

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:30.550
So 236 getting the largest single category

00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:35.830
from something unknown is quite a risk.

00:41:35.830 --> 00:41:39.324
So I'm going to talk about
how we do you risk that.

00:41:39.324 --> 00:41:43.030
But the other thing is right now

00:41:43.030 --> 00:41:45.583
if that's trading at $15 a ton,

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.683
how much are Californians willing to pay?

00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.550
And at what point do you find out?

00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:55.250
So I'm going to show you how
to think about all of that

00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:57.600
and that'll give you some
idea behind my own thinking

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.670
of what the solution looks like.

00:41:59.670 --> 00:42:02.550
But let me give you...

00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:06.253
So I've decided I'm gonna give
grades to all these things.

00:42:07.110 --> 00:42:08.903
Alright, so if I look at,

00:42:08.903 --> 00:42:12.350
does California have the
technology and the policy

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:16.170
to do the scoping plan,
here's how I would rate it.

00:42:16.170 --> 00:42:17.940
I would say for renewables,

00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:20.020
the 50% target in the scoping plan

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:22.530
will actually be met 10 years in advance.

00:42:22.530 --> 00:42:26.363
So I'd say that one we
can over achieve on.

00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:28.760
The low carbon fuel standard

00:42:28.760 --> 00:42:31.363
has already been increased from 18 to 20,

00:42:32.730 --> 00:42:34.850
there'll be an announcement
at 5 o'clock today

00:42:34.850 --> 00:42:38.300
that the Biofuels Association believes

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:41.550
we could eliminate all
fossil diesel by 2030

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:43.010
and so they're releasing a report

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:44.690
to show how that would be done.

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:49.110
So I think those two can be done.

00:42:49.110 --> 00:42:50.550
Appliance and building standards,

00:42:50.550 --> 00:42:53.320
we've never had a problem doing them.

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:54.800
I mean it'll work out.

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.520
So those are, yes, now the likely category

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:00.720
means I didn't thoroughly research it

00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.930
but I talked to people I trust

00:43:02.930 --> 00:43:04.980
and I kind of think it'll happen.

00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:06.700
So the high potential greenhouse

00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:10.030
gas reductions will happen.

00:43:10.030 --> 00:43:12.890
I'll talk about the Kigali
agreement in a moment.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:14.300
I think those are very likely,

00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:15.620
I'll explain what they are

00:43:15.620 --> 00:43:20.420
but these are the pollutants
that caused the ozone hole,

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:24.810
got replaced with pollutants
that don't damage the ozone

00:43:24.810 --> 00:43:28.420
but are highly, highly
greenhouse gas damaging.

00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:30.770
So those have to replace one more time.

00:43:30.770 --> 00:43:33.440
The methane emissions, I kind of think

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.670
we'll know how to do that 'cause you know

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:37.060
where to find them, you can smell them.

00:43:37.060 --> 00:43:38.900
Okay, you can deal with it.

00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:43.300
And then energy storage, I think
enough has happened already

00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.930
that that'll find its way in.

00:43:44.930 --> 00:43:47.800
So I'm gonna put all those
in the likely category.

00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.060
Then we've got the unclear, how do we go,

00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:52.240
like your question earlier,

00:43:52.240 --> 00:43:54.740
how do you get more
reductions in transportation?

00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.823
'Cause this isn't nearly enough.

00:43:57.824 --> 00:44:00.324
How're you gonna get
reductions from cap-and-trade

00:44:01.197 --> 00:44:04.780
'cause that's a pure economics,
and we'll talk about that.

00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:07.790
Then Forest Management
which is not in the plan,

00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:11.020
agriculture and pasture land
management is not in the plan,

00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.950
in the scoping plan
except as aspirational.

00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:17.350
So all those are unclear

00:44:17.350 --> 00:44:20.560
which leads me to the
main point of my talk here

00:44:20.560 --> 00:44:22.630
besides the congratutory point is,

00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:26.330
so where the wrists
and how do we fix that?

00:44:26.330 --> 00:44:29.370
So the biggest unknown is carbon pricing

00:44:29.370 --> 00:44:31.770
and this is the thing that
gets the most attention

00:44:31.770 --> 00:44:33.573
and the least emissions reductions.

00:44:34.970 --> 00:44:37.913
So let me talk about it for a minute.

00:44:39.060 --> 00:44:41.770
First of all in the original scoping plan

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:44.860
leading up to 2020, it
was only a backstop.

00:44:44.860 --> 00:44:48.370
What it meant is the
direct missions reductions

00:44:48.370 --> 00:44:51.860
from renewables cleaner fuels etc,

00:44:51.860 --> 00:44:54.680
were enough to meet all of the targets.

00:44:54.680 --> 00:44:56.910
But what if we were
wrong about one of those

00:44:56.910 --> 00:44:58.610
where the idea behind
cap-and-trade was to say,

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.550
well then, all those major emitters.

00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:02.950
And there's anyone in
this room a major emitter?

00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.880
Come on, you can tell
me, I'm trust (mumbles).

00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:09.290
Alright, do you how
much you'd have to emit

00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:10.740
to be a major emitter?

00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.090
About 25,000 tons.

00:45:14.090 --> 00:45:15.490
So that's the target.

00:45:15.490 --> 00:45:18.230
So if you can find all those people,

00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:20.720
there's about 500 entities in California

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.180
that emit that much or more.

00:45:22.180 --> 00:45:24.933
No one in this room does.

00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:29.830
So you can go after those, you
can really tighten them up,

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:33.000
you can you can work on
it and if all else fails,

00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:36.060
then they have to buy
the emission reduction,

00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:39.760
they have to buy an
allowance to emit a ton

00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.140
and there's only so many allowances.

00:45:42.140 --> 00:45:46.120
And then the price was set at $11 to $15

00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:48.353
in this range to have a minimum price.

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:52.530
As I mentioned in 2017, this whole program

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:54.950
is reauthorized under the tax code

00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:57.960
which enables the
legislature in their wisdom

00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:00.660
to use the proceeds from
this from anything they want.

00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:03.740
Anything from a high-speed trade,

00:46:03.740 --> 00:46:07.510
from Fresno to Merced,
which will drastically

00:46:07.510 --> 00:46:09.110
reduce emissions in that area

00:46:09.110 --> 00:46:10.920
'cause they won't have to fly any more

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.750
between those two cities.

00:46:12.750 --> 00:46:13.810
I made that up, right.

00:46:13.810 --> 00:46:15.437
Okay, you know I'm just kidding.

00:46:15.437 --> 00:46:16.270
(students laughing)

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:18.160
Okay, no need to write
that down, it's not true.

00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:22.420
Okay, but they can do anything
they want with that money,

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:26.470
there is no requirement,
there's no standard that says,

00:46:26.470 --> 00:46:29.000
you have to get this many
tons out of this money.

00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:30.453
It is money available.

00:46:31.720 --> 00:46:34.070
The other thing I was
added was a ceiling price

00:46:34.070 --> 00:46:36.560
strongly recommended by
Severn Bornstein who,

00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:39.210
congratulations, was just
appointed to the Cal Board

00:46:39.210 --> 00:46:42.680
which is great news for him
for Cal and for California,

00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:44.340
very excited about that.

00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:48.030
The reason for a ceiling
price is there is a price

00:46:48.030 --> 00:46:49.730
at the emissions trading at which there

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:51.703
the political support disappears.

00:46:53.350 --> 00:46:55.840
And the way to tell where that price is

00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:00.840
is if we look at a $10 per
ton, each $10 ton for emission.

00:47:02.610 --> 00:47:07.580
For carbon adds about 10
cents to a gallon of gas,

00:47:07.580 --> 00:47:12.580
it adds about 0.5 a cent to
natural gas energy generation,

00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:13.930
it adds one cent to coal

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:17.020
and it adds zero cents to renewables.

00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:18.570
How much does gas have to go up

00:47:18.570 --> 00:47:21.160
before the public gets outraged?

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:23.083
Well, generally it's about 50 cents.

00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:29.000
So if that suddenly went from $15 to $50,

00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.120
there'd be public outrage,

00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.910
the Legislature would whip into action

00:47:34.910 --> 00:47:38.530
and they'd say, we're
gonna fix those regulators,

00:47:38.530 --> 00:47:41.160
those unelected bureaucrats
who have decided

00:47:41.160 --> 00:47:42.450
to choke the California.

00:47:42.450 --> 00:47:44.500
You can just imagine the frenzy

00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.487
and how the excitement
of this war speech is

00:47:47.487 --> 00:47:48.540
why that happened.

00:47:48.540 --> 00:47:51.784
So somewhere between $50 and $65,

00:47:51.784 --> 00:47:54.560
my feeling is that's where
the political support

00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:56.113
drops below majority.

00:47:58.430 --> 00:48:02.110
So in fact the ceiling price was added

00:48:02.110 --> 00:48:05.240
but because there was fear
of saying what it was,

00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:07.310
it was deferred to the Air Resources Board

00:48:07.310 --> 00:48:09.740
to decide what the ceiling price is.

00:48:09.740 --> 00:48:11.710
So this gets back to the question

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:13.670
that was so aptly explained that,

00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:16.133
I don't want either earlier.

00:48:17.350 --> 00:48:21.320
Above a certain price, we no
longer care about emissions,

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:23.320
we just don't want the price any higher.

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:25.620
The number has not been announced yet

00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:27.470
but I'm gonna guess it's $65,

00:48:27.470 --> 00:48:30.370
I'll be happy to do a
raffle on that price.

00:48:30.370 --> 00:48:34.460
At $65 you can buy as many
allowances as you want.

00:48:34.460 --> 00:48:37.840
So at $65, we stop
worrying about emissions

00:48:37.840 --> 00:48:39.840
and we start worrying about the economy.

00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:43.150
Below that number then we're happy to see,

00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:45.393
just take our chances
and see what happens.

00:48:46.440 --> 00:48:48.600
So that's how California compromised.

00:48:48.600 --> 00:48:51.670
But if we look historically
at where carbon pricing

00:48:51.670 --> 00:48:54.950
has actually caused emission reductions,

00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:56.740
it's in what's called offsets.

00:48:56.740 --> 00:49:00.980
So California has defined five offsets;

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.350
Forestry, Urban Forests, Livestock,

00:49:03.350 --> 00:49:06.730
Ozone Depleting Substances
and Mine Methane Capture.

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:09.223
If you do one of those according to SPEC,

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.680
you are allowed to sell that reduction

00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.180
and the people who buy
it are the oil companies

00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:18.556
'cause though they offer, they buy those

00:49:18.556 --> 00:49:20.920
for 90 cents on the dollar.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.690
So they could do spend
15 to buy an allowance

00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:27.860
or they could spend $14 and buy an offset.

00:49:27.860 --> 00:49:32.770
So what the floor on a mission
I'm pricing actually does,

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:34.663
is it creates a market for offsets.

00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:38.283
And and that's what's actually happening.

00:49:39.409 --> 00:49:42.650
So the expectations from the scoping plan

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:45.373
is starting in 2023.

00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:49.040
We'll start seeing
reductions from cap-and-trade

00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:53.283
and by 2030, there'll be
60,000,000 tons in that one year.

00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:57.820
Okay, so now let me back up

00:49:57.820 --> 00:50:01.400
and say what's California's
mission in all of this.

00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:04.210
The arguments will be California's about

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:06.240
is the fifth largest economy,

00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:10.070
so in 2017 which is
the last available data

00:50:10.070 --> 00:50:13.210
I could verify, you had these numbers.

00:50:13.210 --> 00:50:16.450
The USA was 16.6 without California,

00:50:16.450 --> 00:50:21.450
California was 2.7 behind
Germany, Japan and China

00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.060
but we beat out France and the UK.

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:28.270
We used to be behind them, not anymore

00:50:28.270 --> 00:50:30.600
and we know what the UK is trying to do.

00:50:30.600 --> 00:50:32.721
So I feel pretty good about that.

00:50:32.721 --> 00:50:34.860
So we're the largest economy,

00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:37.570
fifth largest economy we
should behave like one

00:50:37.570 --> 00:50:39.990
and be responsible, that's one goal.

00:50:39.990 --> 00:50:43.390
The second is to be the
resistance to Washington

00:50:43.390 --> 00:50:46.653
for a good sport if not
for good policy reasons.

00:50:46.653 --> 00:50:50.000
And then we get to the
real things going on here.

00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.520
The innovation not just
technology but policy

00:50:53.520 --> 00:50:56.320
'cause what we have to do in California

00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.050
if we wanna address the
global climate problem

00:50:59.050 --> 00:51:01.340
is we have to demonstrate there is a way

00:51:02.570 --> 00:51:05.350
of eliminating the greenhouse gases

00:51:05.350 --> 00:51:06.943
without damaging the economy.

00:51:08.370 --> 00:51:10.550
If we can do that, there is no reason

00:51:10.550 --> 00:51:12.530
why other countries won't and other states

00:51:12.530 --> 00:51:15.040
and sub nations won't follow us.

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:18.040
If we demonstrate, we
can cut greenhouse gases

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:20.930
by making the quality of life worse

00:51:20.930 --> 00:51:22.210
and shrinking the economy.

00:51:22.210 --> 00:51:24.363
No one's gonna pay any attention, yes?

00:51:25.410 --> 00:51:27.960
That is a great question,
so the question is,

00:51:27.960 --> 00:51:29.940
if we're trying to encourage innovation,

00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:32.330
why are offsets encouraged?

00:51:32.330 --> 00:51:35.050
And the fact is that's an ongoing debate

00:51:35.050 --> 00:51:36.710
and if you're an emitter,

00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:39.270
you're limited to a
limited number of offsets.

00:51:39.270 --> 00:51:40.740
But if you ask the Air Resources Board,

00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:42.870
what they would say is, we're regulators,

00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:46.680
we're not omnipresent and
knowledgeable of everything.

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.970
So part of the idea is
to create some markets.

00:51:48.970 --> 00:51:51.020
So if somebody can figure
out some way of doing it,

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:53.970
it isn't the Air Resources
Board to figure out

00:51:53.970 --> 00:51:55.470
every possible thing that could be done

00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:57.350
and decide which ones are good.

00:51:57.350 --> 00:52:01.060
So they created categories and
as people came up with ideas,

00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:03.320
if they could demonstrate they're real

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:06.420
and they're additional, then
they qualify as an offset.

00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:09.460
So it's a way of allowing innovation

00:52:10.490 --> 00:52:14.711
that is not driven by
government, if you will.

00:52:14.711 --> 00:52:18.230
And it's a limited amount,
so it can't be everything,

00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:19.640
it's a smaller amount.

00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:23.400
And there some people think it's worked

00:52:23.400 --> 00:52:26.480
and some people think it's a sideline

00:52:26.480 --> 00:52:28.530
and it's not worth fighting over anymore.

00:52:29.490 --> 00:52:31.380
I think those are the kind of the ranges.

00:52:31.380 --> 00:52:33.810
So the other thing we're gonna do

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:35.200
is we wanna do knowledge transfer
to the rest of the world.

00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.960
So if you look at like
the state of Oregon,

00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:40.410
they've just adopted our policies.

00:52:40.410 --> 00:52:42.990
If you look at China,
the majority of policies

00:52:42.990 --> 00:52:45.100
in China started in the United States.

00:52:45.100 --> 00:52:46.930
There's a regular exchange there.

00:52:46.930 --> 00:52:51.540
If our only job was to get
to California and China,

00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:54.290
to these targets, I feel
really good about the chances.

00:52:55.578 --> 00:52:58.120
Say whatever you want about China

00:52:58.120 --> 00:53:00.680
in terms of human rights
and the rest of that,

00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:04.820
when it comes to policy and
the rest of these items,

00:53:04.820 --> 00:53:07.200
they're highly motivated
because their economy

00:53:07.200 --> 00:53:08.623
is held back by pollution.

00:53:10.490 --> 00:53:11.970
So when you're in that situation,

00:53:11.970 --> 00:53:14.210
you're willing to invest
a lot behind this.

00:53:14.210 --> 00:53:16.720
It's also a country that's, you know,

00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:18.670
I think the average politician in China

00:53:18.670 --> 00:53:20.530
has an engineering background,

00:53:20.530 --> 00:53:22.310
the average one in the United States

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:24.530
tends to be more legal behind it.

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:26.140
So it's a different, it's obviously

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:27.470
a totally different culture

00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:29.750
but in terms of adopting
California's policies

00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:33.040
and being a great partner
on looking at these things,

00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:34.600
they've done some amazing stuff.

00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.580
They are the largest producers
of electric vehicles.

00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:40.030
One of their new company,
one of the spin-offs

00:53:40.030 --> 00:53:42.320
a new company is making
the electric buses,

00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:46.170
they'll be the largest
supplier, they're in California.

00:53:46.170 --> 00:53:50.270
So the innovation behind what's
happening all those things

00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:53.960
is quite dramatic and it's
an amazing, amazing area.

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.050
So we wanted the knowledge transfer.

00:53:56.050 --> 00:54:00.550
We wanna win with the lowest
possible price on carbon.

00:54:00.550 --> 00:54:03.553
And this is where I
have most of my debates.

00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:06.350
There people are saying, let's stick it

00:54:06.350 --> 00:54:09.193
to the oil companies, let's
make the price really high.

00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:13.700
Okay, there's a reason why
Exxon wants a price on carbon,

00:54:13.700 --> 00:54:16.180
they just pass it through
everybody will have to pay it.

00:54:16.180 --> 00:54:17.860
We're gonna come to that moment.

00:54:17.860 --> 00:54:21.560
So let me move ahead,
and let's start first

00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:23.440
with the federal government.

00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:26.830
So here's a model the federal government:

00:54:26.830 --> 00:54:29.843
Denial, Delay, Disaster,
Drench and Repeat.

00:54:31.370 --> 00:54:34.510
This is the summer and fall season

00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:35.980
in the federal government.

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:38.823
And the question is, what
has an eye but cannot see?

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:43.210
So my strategy on the federal government

00:54:43.210 --> 00:54:47.030
is resistance through
2020, mostly through legal

00:54:48.070 --> 00:54:52.800
political climate, the political
climate changes behind it

00:54:52.800 --> 00:54:57.283
and in 2021, there's major federal action.

00:54:58.460 --> 00:55:00.890
But if you're gonna have
major federal action in 2021,

00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:03.760
you need to decide in the
next two years what action

00:55:03.760 --> 00:55:05.170
you would actually wanna have

00:55:05.170 --> 00:55:07.543
which I'm gonna talk about, yes?

00:55:07.543 --> 00:55:12.126
(background noise drowns other sounds)

00:55:16.144 --> 00:55:16.977
Yeah.

00:55:18.506 --> 00:55:22.760
(background noise drowns other sounds)

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:24.330
They're powerful but, you know,

00:55:24.330 --> 00:55:26.906
one of the things that happened right,

00:55:26.906 --> 00:55:27.975
they got in all this trouble

00:55:27.975 --> 00:55:29.225
and then they've got nationalized

00:55:29.225 --> 00:55:32.090
and then we passed all these
laws which they agreed to

00:55:32.090 --> 00:55:33.960
and then we set them free again.

00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.027
I just think they're a different world now

00:55:36.027 --> 00:55:39.040
and I think they do see a
lot of money and opportunity

00:55:39.040 --> 00:55:41.400
if they ever get batteries affordable

00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:43.360
and sell electric vehicles either.

00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.980
So I think I think of the oil industry

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:47.447
as a bigger problem
than the auto industry.

00:55:47.447 --> 00:55:52.447
And I see Adrian nodding,
so you generally think...

00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:55.610
So I'm gonna repeat that
so everyone can benefit

00:55:55.610 --> 00:55:57.823
who's listening online, both of them.

00:55:59.410 --> 00:56:01.190
(students laughing)

00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:04.830
So it's because it's a global market

00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:06.000
and if we look at what's happening

00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:07.570
in Europe and Asia and elsewhere,

00:56:07.570 --> 00:56:10.620
there's huge demand on
more efficient vehicles.

00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:12.680
And on electrification of vehicles

00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:15.190
and you even have some countries banning

00:56:15.190 --> 00:56:18.180
the internal combustion
engine which I would never do

00:56:18.180 --> 00:56:19.270
but they're doing that.

00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:21.493
So they have all that pressure already,

00:56:22.480 --> 00:56:24.450
they don't wanna risk the tea leaves

00:56:24.450 --> 00:56:26.360
by betting on a total reversal.

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.700
On the other hand, the oil
industry is a different problem,

00:56:28.700 --> 00:56:30.833
so I'm gonna focus on them in that.

00:56:32.621 --> 00:56:34.887
(background noise drowns other sounds)

00:56:34.887 --> 00:56:38.330
Okay, the reason why is, that's
picking winners and losers.

00:56:38.330 --> 00:56:40.590
So to ban the internal combustion engine

00:56:40.590 --> 00:56:42.280
is to bet that no one's
going to figure out

00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:45.390
how to make a liquid
fuel that's carbon free.

00:56:45.390 --> 00:56:48.460
And why would you want to ban that

00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:51.360
when there's all these people
working on it currently?

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:53.350
I mean there's huge investments in that,

00:56:53.350 --> 00:56:55.940
they've had some success,
some failures behind it

00:56:55.940 --> 00:56:57.230
but someone might figure that out.

00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:58.970
Someone might figure out how to convert

00:56:58.970 --> 00:57:01.050
sunlight to hydrogen.

00:57:01.050 --> 00:57:03.200
You can go directly from
hydrogen to liquid fuel

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:07.710
and it's got a lot more density
than all these batteries.

00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:12.240
So why would you eliminate that
possible technology thread?

00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.730
I mean what benefit is
there from eliminating it?

00:57:14.730 --> 00:57:19.650
You could say that cars have
to be zero emission behind it

00:57:19.650 --> 00:57:21.230
but right now the electric vehicle,

00:57:21.230 --> 00:57:23.430
it's emissions are somewhere else.

00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:26.040
Now they're just not with
you, they're somewhere else.

00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:28.770
Alright, so you could
say that the standard

00:57:28.770 --> 00:57:31.020
is the emissions from an electric vehicle

00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:34.620
and you have to meet this in your fuel

00:57:34.620 --> 00:57:35.940
and then you haven't eliminated.

00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:38.110
So that's why I think
those countries are wrong

00:57:38.110 --> 00:57:39.260
but they didn't ask me,

00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:43.030
they should have maybe, yes?
(students laughing)

00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:44.110
Okay, so the question is,

00:57:44.110 --> 00:57:48.810
are there disadvantage
to all electrification

00:57:48.810 --> 00:57:51.720
behind in terms of transmission
lines and other things?

00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.460
There may be some, it's not anything

00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:57.340
that I'm not knowledgeable about it.

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:59.690
But it's kind of like
if somebody discovered

00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:01.460
that cellphones really
weren't very healthy,

00:58:01.460 --> 00:58:02.570
how many people...

00:58:02.570 --> 00:58:05.280
At some point, no one's
going to turn them in.

00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:07.170
So it may be with electricity

00:58:07.170 --> 00:58:08.870
that we don't think it's a problem

00:58:11.350 --> 00:58:13.420
but I don't really have a good answer

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:15.150
of what that risk is.

00:58:15.150 --> 00:58:16.033
Yes, in the back.

00:58:16.980 --> 00:58:19.700
Okay, so I just want
to repeat the comments,

00:58:19.700 --> 00:58:20.860
it's a really important one.

00:58:20.860 --> 00:58:24.297
If one of the studies I was
involved in is looking at

00:58:24.297 --> 00:58:25.920
the year 2050 and the general strategy

00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:28.350
is all the new electricity demand

00:58:28.350 --> 00:58:30.590
coming from the vehicles
would more or less

00:58:30.590 --> 00:58:33.290
be offset by improvements in efficiency,

00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:35.230
so the overall demand on the grid

00:58:35.230 --> 00:58:37.820
is gonna not be dramatically different

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:40.210
in this timeframe but how it distributes

00:58:40.210 --> 00:58:43.760
and how it all works is
is the real challenge.

00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:45.830
Okay, so let's look at some of the things

00:58:45.830 --> 00:58:48.760
the federal government has been
doing lately, just for fun.

00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:50.790
Every morning I get up that
there's something interesting

00:58:50.790 --> 00:58:53.620
to do, I capture on a slide
and then I hope to use it

00:58:53.620 --> 00:58:55.150
but I never have enough time.

00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:58.950
So you saw that coal and
nuclear are too expensive,

00:58:58.950 --> 00:59:00.543
like way too expensive.

00:59:01.476 --> 00:59:03.400
Well there's a solution to
that, let's subsidize them.

00:59:03.400 --> 00:59:07.040
So Rick Perry who didn't know that nuclear

00:59:08.144 --> 00:59:11.660
was part of the Energy
Department until he took the job,

00:59:11.660 --> 00:59:14.600
that's just a political
comment but it is true,

00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:16.223
I have my source verified there.

00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:19.670
He came up with this
idea of subsidizing them

00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:22.710
and having everybody else pay for it.

00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:25.470
He took that to the took that

00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:27.940
to the Federal Energy Regulatory committee

00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:29.670
which voted it down.

00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:32.290
So we think it's gone
for a while (laughs).

00:59:32.290 --> 00:59:33.280
Anyway but it might come back.

00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:35.230
So that's one idea.

00:59:35.230 --> 00:59:37.670
Then you have people
like the City of Oakland

00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:41.510
or the state of Washington
refused to export coal.

00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:43.750
So if you're a coal
producer in United States

00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:46.740
and coal demand is
dropping, your only hope

00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:48.800
is to send it somewhere
else but to do that,

00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:50.720
you have to ship it and you need a port.

00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:54.320
So those are all turned down,
so Trump announced the plan

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.940
to use the military ports to do this.

00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:02.740
It won't happen but that's
kind of what you deal with

01:00:02.740 --> 01:00:03.670
on a regular basis.

01:00:03.670 --> 01:00:07.170
So I heard one of these almost
for every day of the year.

01:00:07.170 --> 01:00:09.666
(students laughing)

01:00:09.666 --> 01:00:10.610
But let's talk about the reality sucks

01:00:10.610 --> 01:00:12.280
but we all expected it.

01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:15.580
So last year had a 3%
to 4% jump in emissions.

01:00:15.580 --> 01:00:19.410
Well duh, if you're not
driving reductions fast enough

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:22.080
and you have a huge economic goose

01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:24.920
that happens in the first
six months, guess what?

01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:27.544
Emissions go up, so you
could have modeled this

01:00:27.544 --> 01:00:30.090
and predicted it to two digits accuracy.

01:00:30.090 --> 01:00:31.910
So that's not, I mean it's a problem

01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:35.020
but it's not a new problem to have.

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:36.950
Okay, half okay let's
look at some other things

01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:40.110
that happened and then we're
gonna move to the solutions.

01:00:40.110 --> 01:00:41.930
So this is a great headline,

01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:45.020
this was from October,
if I remember correctly.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.592
ExxonMobil gives a $1,000,000

01:00:47.592 --> 01:00:49.692
to promote a carbon tax and dividend plan.

01:00:51.389 --> 01:00:54.420
So Larry Summers, is a smart guy said,

01:00:54.420 --> 01:00:56.930
a company getting behind
its product being taxed

01:00:56.930 --> 01:00:58.173
is a very rare thing.

01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:00.931
Do you agree or disagree?

01:01:00.931 --> 01:01:03.312
(students laughing)

01:01:03.312 --> 01:01:04.865
- [Students] Agree.

01:01:04.865 --> 01:01:06.605
- Agree, okay, good.

01:01:06.605 --> 01:01:09.850
Okay the plan also includes
a regulatory simplification.

01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:10.683
What does that means?

01:01:10.683 --> 01:01:13.283
Well, an end the federal
and state tort liability.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:18.630
So if you're an oil company
and you've known for 50 years

01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:21.430
that your product is causing damage,

01:01:21.430 --> 01:01:23.917
are you concerned or not that
may be someone's gonna sue you

01:01:23.917 --> 01:01:25.330
and some courts gonna decide

01:01:25.330 --> 01:01:28.000
you're actually liable, strict liability?

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.640
Well the answer is absolutely yes.

01:01:29.640 --> 01:01:31.480
What's the solution?

01:01:31.480 --> 01:01:33.980
Well, we think you
should have a carbon fee

01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:36.050
and we should do some
regulatory simplification,

01:01:36.050 --> 01:01:37.390
there we go.

01:01:37.390 --> 01:01:39.990
Alright, so that's an
announcement from October 8th.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.410
Okay, the other thing that happened

01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:47.160
at the very end of session
is the energy innovation

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.370
and carbon dividend Act HR 773

01:01:50.370 --> 01:01:53.737
was introduced on November 27th.

01:01:53.737 --> 01:01:56.693
The session ended early January,

01:01:57.756 --> 01:01:58.940
the bill has not been reintroduced.

01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:03.393
But it did introduce
a concept bi-partisan,

01:02:04.265 --> 01:02:09.265
there is this the citizens climate lobby,

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:11.360
is anybody here a member?

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.430
It's a great organization,
they've been working for years

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:17.320
to try to get a policy like
this enacted in Congress.

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:22.320
One of their other ideas
is to have a climate caucus

01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:28.180
at the federal level,
yeah, but the way it works,

01:02:28.180 --> 01:02:31.320
is a Democrat can only join
if a Republican comes in.

01:02:31.320 --> 01:02:34.323
So they had in equal numbers of both.

01:02:35.260 --> 01:02:37.760
The idea is a carbon fee at %15 initially,

01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.370
goes up ten dollars a year for 10 years

01:02:40.370 --> 01:02:43.123
and if it solves their
problem great and if not,

01:02:43.123 --> 01:02:44.233
will revise the plan.

01:02:45.580 --> 01:02:49.130
Okay, the carbon dividend and the money

01:02:49.130 --> 01:02:52.010
that's collected is not spent
by the federal government

01:02:52.010 --> 01:02:55.203
but it's sent back per
capita to all citizens.

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.010
There's also something
really important in this,

01:02:59.010 --> 01:03:00.970
a carbon Equalization tariff which says

01:03:00.970 --> 01:03:03.406
if you're a country whose price on carbon

01:03:03.406 --> 01:03:05.940
is not at least at our level,

01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.540
the carbon content of your product,

01:03:08.540 --> 01:03:11.160
how much emissions occurred
to create your product

01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:14.070
and ship it here well,
there'll be a tariff

01:03:14.070 --> 01:03:15.680
equal to the carbon.

01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:19.100
And that solves it, it
creates an incentive here

01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:20.880
in another country, you wanna ship here,

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:23.230
if you had a carbon
fee at least like ours,

01:03:23.230 --> 01:03:24.350
then you'd have no tariffs

01:03:24.350 --> 01:03:26.150
if not your products are disadvantaged.

01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:28.450
This is just a fabulous idea

01:03:28.450 --> 01:03:29.580
and there are lawyers who think

01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:33.023
they would hold up from the
World Trade Organization.

01:03:33.950 --> 01:03:37.050
There's also a regulatory adjustment

01:03:37.050 --> 01:03:41.033
which means that EPA could
do nothing for 10 years.

01:03:42.830 --> 01:03:45.390
There's a similar bill in the Senate,

01:03:45.390 --> 01:03:46.840
there'll be a bunch of these,

01:03:47.730 --> 01:03:49.550
that are happening this year.

01:03:49.550 --> 01:03:52.500
Here's my problem with
it, is if I have to bet

01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:56.450
my grandchildren's
future on a fee on carbon

01:03:56.450 --> 01:04:00.090
causing behavioral changes
and in 10 years from now

01:04:00.090 --> 01:04:01.410
finding out whether it works or not,

01:04:01.410 --> 01:04:03.070
I'm not willing to bet on that.

01:04:03.070 --> 01:04:06.090
I would have this but I
wouldn't have this by itself.

01:04:06.090 --> 01:04:08.490
So let me tell you what else I would do.

01:04:08.490 --> 01:04:12.500
And by the way in the
midterms unfortunately

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:17.490
half of the climate caucus
Republicans lost re-election.

01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:20.030
I went through the list,
I don't think anybody

01:04:20.030 --> 01:04:21.500
had to deal with climate,
they just happened

01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:23.780
to be in districts that were competitive.

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:26.280
So there's an interesting
thing there, sideline.

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.130
Alright, so here's some new thinking

01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:29.380
we're gonna try to cover.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.580
First of all can the oil and gas companies

01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:34.033
be made part of the solution?

01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.120
And the way to think about this,

01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:39.790
is we're in the year 2045,
we're celebrating zero emissions

01:04:39.790 --> 01:04:41.183
what business is Exxon in?

01:04:44.647 --> 01:04:46.795
(background noise drowns other sounds).

01:04:46.795 --> 01:04:48.148
I mean it's a rhetorical question

01:04:48.148 --> 01:04:49.640
but if we don't have an answer for that

01:04:49.640 --> 01:04:53.210
or ideas behind that, I think
the goal is how do we get them

01:04:53.210 --> 01:04:55.200
into the lines of business that we think

01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.080
and needed by then, that's a good fit.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.580
It's no longer we're at the point

01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:00.590
where we have the luxury of saying,

01:05:00.590 --> 01:05:02.110
let's just drive them out of business

01:05:02.110 --> 01:05:05.230
and somebody else will hire those people.

01:05:05.230 --> 01:05:07.890
So then we have the Kigali agreement

01:05:07.890 --> 01:05:10.080
which I'll talk about Carbon Farming,

01:05:10.080 --> 01:05:11.620
Rethinking building materials

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:14.550
and converting carbon
to something of value.

01:05:14.550 --> 01:05:17.610
So and when I look at
California's targets,

01:05:17.610 --> 01:05:22.160
I'm totally uncomfortable
with cap-and-trade at $60

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:24.200
getting those emissions.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:26.650
So I'm trying to figure out
what else could we be doing

01:05:26.650 --> 01:05:29.480
and I'm gonna spend a few
minutes on each one of these.

01:05:29.480 --> 01:05:32.540
So let's look at the future
businesses for oil and gas.

01:05:32.540 --> 01:05:34.950
This is a thought experiment,

01:05:34.950 --> 01:05:37.250
these are the businesses
they're currently in.

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:40.950
Now let's take carbon pricing,

01:05:40.950 --> 01:05:43.100
sometimes the price on
carbon is just enough

01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:44.870
to get them into oil business.

01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:47.830
There's policy drivers and
then there's the unknown

01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:50.230
which is litigation which
I think has to ramp up

01:05:51.159 --> 01:05:53.608
really really hard and fast
you put all those pressures on

01:05:53.608 --> 01:05:56.170
but you want to pressurize them in a way.

01:05:56.170 --> 01:05:58.960
Oh, there's a great quote
that Dean Brady once told me,

01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:01.900
as an old quote about Standard Oil,

01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.450
they said they've done
everything in the Congress

01:06:03.450 --> 01:06:04.643
except to refine it.

01:06:06.338 --> 01:06:07.171
(students laughing)

01:06:07.171 --> 01:06:08.650
So we have to take these refiners

01:06:08.650 --> 01:06:12.010
and turn them into a productive
part of the solution.

01:06:12.010 --> 01:06:15.340
So if we look at one of
these things might be

01:06:15.340 --> 01:06:17.160
one is renewable power generation,

01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:20.400
a few of them have moved
into that a little bit now.

01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.130
Can they decarbonize?

01:06:22.130 --> 01:06:23.920
Can they take natural gas?

01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:25.900
So this gets back to the problem that

01:06:25.900 --> 01:06:27.680
when you have bad weather for a week,

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:30.180
your batteries ran out six hours ago,

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:32.277
how do you keep the lights on?

01:06:32.277 --> 01:06:34.000
Well the cheapest way to do that

01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:36.119
is to use the existing infrastructure.

01:06:36.119 --> 01:06:39.823
The US has six months worth
of natural gas storage.

01:06:41.860 --> 01:06:45.620
If natural gas where the
backup, we could go months

01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:47.700
without any renewable.

01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:50.870
So no one thinks we have to
go more than three weeks.

01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:53.410
So if you could decarbonize natural gas,

01:06:53.410 --> 01:06:56.480
well, the way you would do that
is you take the natural gas,

01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.830
you'd split it in the
hydrogen and carbon, co2,

01:06:59.809 --> 01:07:03.100
you could store the co2 you
somewhere, take the hydrogen

01:07:03.100 --> 01:07:07.030
and you can burn it directly
and make electricity.

01:07:07.030 --> 01:07:09.180
So would we like them to
be in that line of work?

01:07:09.180 --> 01:07:11.570
Well, they know how to
handle a natural gas,

01:07:11.570 --> 01:07:13.510
they have pipelines, they
know how to move it around.

01:07:13.510 --> 01:07:16.210
So I think part of the thinking has to be

01:07:16.210 --> 01:07:19.130
what businesses do we want them to be in?

01:07:19.130 --> 01:07:21.560
And what pressures do we
need to apply so they move

01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:25.844
to those businesses
sooner rather than later?

01:07:25.844 --> 01:07:28.300
So this is just the thought
of a thought experiment

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:30.780
that I'm working on for the next year

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:32.490
with various people to say,

01:07:32.490 --> 01:07:34.910
how do we make them part of the solution?

01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:39.910
Now Shell, after the Paris
climate accords came out

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:43.660
did a model that said,
this is how you could meet

01:07:43.660 --> 01:07:45.710
the targets and but it includes

01:07:45.710 --> 01:07:49.600
some very deep negative
emissions meaning carbon

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:51.210
that's taken out of the atmosphere

01:07:51.210 --> 01:07:54.420
done primarily through
a mixture of biofuels

01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:58.490
and taking biomass, taking plant material

01:07:58.490 --> 01:08:01.233
and getting the carbon into the ground.

01:08:03.590 --> 01:08:06.500
The fact that they did this
scenario is interesting,

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:08.940
it doesn't mean their
business is moving that way

01:08:08.940 --> 01:08:11.930
but it gives you, reading
through this gives you a clue

01:08:11.930 --> 01:08:15.420
to their own thinking of what
businesses might they be in.

01:08:15.420 --> 01:08:17.060
Now not all businesses are the same,

01:08:17.060 --> 01:08:19.440
this gets your question
of, is the auto industry

01:08:19.440 --> 01:08:21.150
the oil industry the bigger problem?

01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:24.080
Marathon petroleum is
the largest distributor

01:08:24.080 --> 01:08:26.843
of liquid fuels in the United States.

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:30.400
And you probably have all
heard of the Coke brothers.

01:08:31.650 --> 01:08:34.990
So you have this article in December 16th,

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:37.190
The Oil Industry covert plan that changed

01:08:37.190 --> 01:08:38.560
the car mission rules.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:41.668
They went to the Trump
administration and said,

01:08:41.668 --> 01:08:43.020
you know, fuel efficiency used to matter

01:08:43.020 --> 01:08:46.000
when we were buying oil
from dangerous places

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:49.894
but now the US as of October
is the largest producer

01:08:49.894 --> 01:08:54.513
of fuels in the world, and
you know if you by country,

01:08:55.550 --> 01:08:59.480
So we have all we need,
so there's no reason

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:01.510
for these anymore, why
don't you just relax them.

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:04.986
The auto industry wasn't a big fan of this

01:09:04.986 --> 01:09:06.010
'cause they're already working toward it

01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:09.330
and they already want to
promote electric vehicles

01:09:09.330 --> 01:09:11.810
but the oil industry
went behind the scenes

01:09:11.810 --> 01:09:13.453
and are trying to muck this up.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:16.200
That's just shows it won't be easy

01:09:16.200 --> 01:09:18.010
but the part that intrigues me the most

01:09:18.010 --> 01:09:20.660
is this litigation by the
state of Rhode Island.

01:09:20.660 --> 01:09:22.830
So the state of Rhode
Island is not an island

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:26.433
but it is on the coast, just
quick geography refresher.

01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:32.960
Okay, and they are suing 50 oil companies

01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:36.703
not necessary all the right
ones but 50 which is a start.

01:09:37.950 --> 01:09:41.107
Okay, they're claiming
that due to sea level rise,

01:09:41.107 --> 01:09:44.860
they've suffered damages,
the oil industry knew

01:09:44.860 --> 01:09:47.150
that sea level rise was a direct result

01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:48.850
then we know exactly
what their emissions is,

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:51.880
we know how to convert
emissions into sea level rise

01:09:52.720 --> 01:09:55.929
assuming Antarctica
doesn't fall into the sea

01:09:55.929 --> 01:09:57.220
or any other major ice things.

01:09:57.220 --> 01:09:59.783
So they want damages to
pay for infrastructure.

01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:04.580
There's a very good legal
standing behind this.

01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:06.200
Now the trick is that the oil industry

01:10:06.200 --> 01:10:08.520
tries to move this to friendly courts

01:10:08.520 --> 01:10:11.390
but the states can keep
it in a state court

01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:13.100
which is more friendly to our costs.

01:10:13.100 --> 01:10:17.733
It only takes one major
thing to try to change it.

01:10:18.677 --> 01:10:20.200
So I think putting pressure here

01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:22.290
but what will happen is that all companies

01:10:22.290 --> 01:10:24.740
will go to congress and
then say, we need relief,

01:10:26.249 --> 01:10:27.758
you know, you you provided free insurance

01:10:27.758 --> 01:10:30.710
to the nuclear industry,
whatever, we need it too.

01:10:30.710 --> 01:10:33.440
So the trick is in the
next two years to know

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.460
if they could do that how do you stop it?

01:10:36.460 --> 01:10:41.010
Now the way you stop it,
you'll notice that Tobacco

01:10:41.010 --> 01:10:44.620
they went to Congress for
tobacco and asked for protection

01:10:44.620 --> 01:10:45.710
and they didn't get any.

01:10:45.710 --> 01:10:46.820
Now I believe the reason why

01:10:46.820 --> 01:10:48.930
is 'cause every state gets money

01:10:48.930 --> 01:10:50.470
from the tobacco settlement.

01:10:50.470 --> 01:10:52.950
So there aren't probably
aren't two senators

01:10:52.950 --> 01:10:56.030
that wanna mess up their state's income

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:59.020
to do a favor for a tobacco company

01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:00.780
that's not even in their state.

01:11:00.780 --> 01:11:04.230
So I think connecting the dots on this

01:11:04.230 --> 01:11:05.740
and getting more states involved

01:11:05.740 --> 01:11:08.700
is a big way of a new
way of putting pressure

01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:09.880
on the oil industry.

01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:12.210
But you have to know when
they come to complain,

01:11:12.210 --> 01:11:13.460
what you want them to do.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.050
Let me talk about two
other things quickly.

01:11:17.050 --> 01:11:20.130
So the Kigali agreement, Kigali's.

01:11:20.130 --> 01:11:22.210
This goes back to the Montreal Protocol,

01:11:22.210 --> 01:11:24.940
I would say it's the
only successful example

01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:29.940
of a global environmental
policy structure that's held up.

01:11:31.290 --> 01:11:33.990
And I guess the reason why
is 'cause the ozone hole is

01:11:35.344 --> 01:11:36.922
you know, it's a small
number of pollutants

01:11:36.922 --> 01:11:38.950
that caused the problem a
small number of companies.

01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:40.790
But anyway, the Kigali agreement

01:11:40.790 --> 01:11:43.603
amended the 1987 Montreal Protocol.

01:11:46.338 --> 01:11:48.080
It went into force January 1st, 2019.

01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:51.460
Now it's phasing out hydro fluorocarbons

01:11:51.460 --> 01:11:55.730
that replaced the original
chlorofluorocarbons.

01:11:55.730 --> 01:11:58.540
My understanding of this
is the chlorofluorocarbons

01:11:59.690 --> 01:12:01.373
then damage the ozone.

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:04.680
The hydro fluorocarbons
don't damage the ozone

01:12:06.087 --> 01:12:08.610
but they just happen to
be 1,200, 1,300 times

01:12:08.610 --> 01:12:11.493
more potent as a greenhouse gas than co2.

01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:14.163
I guess you could say whoops!

01:12:15.671 --> 01:12:19.740
Alright, so the goal
is to fix this problem,

01:12:19.740 --> 01:12:22.602
it turns out the
alternatives already exists

01:12:22.602 --> 01:12:23.600
and it's mostly, the
alternatives are mostly made

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:24.963
by American companies.

01:12:25.890 --> 01:12:30.890
So you have this interesting
thing that the EPA in 2015

01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:33.300
you know, rule that we're
going to move in this direction

01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:36.860
and guess who said the EPA overreached?

01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:38.370
Probably somebody you've never heard of,

01:12:38.370 --> 01:12:41.803
a Judge Kavanaugh, there
you have heard of them.

01:12:42.716 --> 01:12:43.562
(background noise drowns other sounds)

01:12:43.562 --> 01:12:44.395
Well that's interesting,

01:12:44.395 --> 01:12:45.690
I wonder if that predicts
the future, who knows.

01:12:45.690 --> 01:12:47.050
But then you have this amazing thing

01:12:47.050 --> 01:12:48.730
the US Chamber of Commerce said,

01:12:48.730 --> 01:12:50.860
the Kigali agreement is
a win for the environment

01:12:50.860 --> 01:12:52.333
and for the US economy.

01:12:53.210 --> 01:12:57.120
150,000 jobs in the next 10 years,

01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:00.120
13 Republican senators still in office

01:13:00.120 --> 01:13:02.176
signed a letter requesting that Trump

01:13:02.176 --> 01:13:07.176
if only he didn't know
that it helps the climate,

01:13:08.230 --> 01:13:09.600
maybe it wouldn't be a problem

01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.710
but I don't see any reason
why this can't get done.

01:13:12.710 --> 01:13:14.470
You've got a great alignment behind it,

01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:15.530
it's a huge benefit.

01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:17.960
The state of California
has an estimate of how much

01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:22.076
this would help us and it
makes air conditioners.

01:13:22.076 --> 01:13:23.430
Using the alternative,

01:13:23.430 --> 01:13:26.070
can be 30% to 60% more
efficient so it cuts...

01:13:26.070 --> 01:13:28.173
It's just everybody wins.

01:13:29.335 --> 01:13:32.010
So that's a hopeful thing
and you could imagine

01:13:32.010 --> 01:13:34.510
that happening in the current Congress.

01:13:34.510 --> 01:13:38.980
Carbon Farming, this is one of
the new areas of opportunity

01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:41.870
the state has recently
increased its objectives

01:13:41.870 --> 01:13:42.703
to work in this area.

01:13:42.703 --> 01:13:45.030
And the basic idea is the farm

01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:47.860
in a way that keeps soil there

01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:50.960
and keeps carbon building up in the soil.

01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.890
So the California current targets

01:13:52.890 --> 01:13:56.210
are 15 to 20 million metric tons by 2030.

01:13:56.210 --> 01:14:00.210
The state just recently
released a new analysis

01:14:00.210 --> 01:14:01.530
that doesn't say how to do it

01:14:01.530 --> 01:14:04.260
but says the target should be doubled.

01:14:04.260 --> 01:14:06.160
There's a bunch of researchers here at Cal

01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:08.410
that are trying to
figure out how to do this

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:12.730
but some examples, one
research paper that I looked at

01:14:12.730 --> 01:14:16.510
called 147 million metric tons by 2030

01:14:16.510 --> 01:14:21.510
could be safe well that's half
of the problem right there.

01:14:22.530 --> 01:14:24.190
There's lots of other states behind this

01:14:24.190 --> 01:14:27.640
but the main point is they're
getting agricultural products

01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:29.570
and this is part of the next 10 report

01:14:30.870 --> 01:14:33.497
that just came out looking towards

01:14:34.880 --> 01:14:36.720
a carbon neutral California.

01:14:36.720 --> 01:14:38.570
You just can't do it unless you start

01:14:39.524 --> 01:14:40.357
to look at the natural systems

01:14:40.357 --> 01:14:42.770
and get them more involved.

01:14:42.770 --> 01:14:45.930
So carbon farming is one way to do that.

01:14:45.930 --> 01:14:48.650
Another way to do that is to
rethink building materials

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:53.290
so total self shameless self-promotion,

01:14:53.290 --> 01:14:55.410
everybody understand the rules.

01:14:55.410 --> 01:14:57.410
Okay this is a company I've invested in.

01:14:59.210 --> 01:15:01.900
The ideas you can
actually make wall systems

01:15:01.900 --> 01:15:03.833
out of certain types of bamboo.

01:15:04.730 --> 01:15:08.316
When you do that if you
look at the lifecycle

01:15:08.316 --> 01:15:13.316
of bamboo in three to six
years of grows to maturity.

01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:15.840
And then you cut off the
stock and guess what happens,

01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:19.630
three to six years later,
another one comes back.

01:15:19.630 --> 01:15:21.663
Let's look at Douglas Fir,

01:15:23.872 --> 01:15:25.940
well he cut it off, the stamp has to decay

01:15:25.940 --> 01:15:28.740
and nothing happens
unless you actively do it.

01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:31.343
And then it grows back in 50 to 100 years.

01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:35.880
So the opportunity using timber bamboo

01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:37.940
and it turns out the environmental
properties are better,

01:15:37.940 --> 01:15:39.900
everything is better behind it.

01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:44.301
Could we switch a huge portion
of the wood construction

01:15:44.301 --> 01:15:47.560
into two things, one would be bamboo,

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:49.330
the other advantage of
bamboo is if you create

01:15:49.330 --> 01:15:51.960
more demand for it, you
can grow bamboo forests,

01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.720
you can replant them and grow them back

01:15:53.720 --> 01:15:56.143
where they were cut down
in a couple of years.

01:15:57.428 --> 01:15:58.730
It takes an unknown amount of time

01:15:58.730 --> 01:16:01.103
to restore the Amazon,
if it even can be done.

01:16:02.030 --> 01:16:06.700
So this is a very fast
way to replace a product

01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:08.720
with a more efficient one and create

01:16:08.720 --> 01:16:11.380
a sequestration demand through bamboo.

01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:15.000
So that's why I'm very excited
about the potential for this.

01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:18.050
The other thing that we have looked at

01:16:18.050 --> 01:16:21.720
is how do you get more of the
material out of the forests

01:16:21.720 --> 01:16:23.960
and use that in construction.

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.280
And so there's a lot of
research going on there

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.700
and Sandra did that work when she was

01:16:29.700 --> 01:16:31.403
a grad student here, last year.

01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.660
Let me now move on, to carbon capture

01:16:34.660 --> 01:16:36.773
and carbon-to-value real quickly.

01:16:38.090 --> 01:16:41.600
So submarines and spacecraft
if you've ever been in one,

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:42.990
in their natural environment,

01:16:42.990 --> 01:16:44.723
guess what happens to the co2?

01:16:45.770 --> 01:16:47.490
They take it out.

01:16:47.490 --> 01:16:50.590
So taking co2 out has been done forever,

01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:54.380
you may remember Apollo 13
where one of the canisters

01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:58.750
was around and the other was
square and they had a problem,

01:16:58.750 --> 01:17:00.330
they were fitting one into the other.

01:17:00.330 --> 01:17:02.690
So knowing how to do it,
it's just doing it at scale

01:17:02.690 --> 01:17:04.700
and doing it affordably.

01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:08.123
But there's two sources, you
can take concentrated co2

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:13.150
and that's out of the smokestack
or you can take it out

01:17:13.150 --> 01:17:15.550
of the air which is much harder to do.

01:17:15.550 --> 01:17:18.830
So recently the Carbon XPRIZE,
just to give you some hope,

01:17:18.830 --> 01:17:21.270
offered a $20,000,000 prize for people

01:17:21.270 --> 01:17:24.480
that could take carbon,
from either source,

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.340
and converted into something
you could actually sell.

01:17:27.340 --> 01:17:29.820
So some examples here, C2CNT,

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:32.570
not cleverest name I ever saw,

01:17:32.570 --> 01:17:35.650
it transforms co2 flue
gas into a carbon nanotube

01:17:35.650 --> 01:17:40.020
which you can then build into
airplanes wings, for example.

01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.748
So the carbon is now captured
in a structure that's,

01:17:42.748 --> 01:17:46.890
you know, it's a physical
structure that's of value.

01:17:46.890 --> 01:17:51.890
Another example here is CAX
which is based in Hayward,

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.830
a local example, they convert the gas

01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:59.010
to ethylene glycol which is an ingredient

01:17:59.010 --> 01:18:02.033
in lithium-ion batteries
and a lot of other things.

01:18:03.064 --> 01:18:06.500
Kiverdi takes these
certain type of microbes

01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:09.343
add co2 and then convert
it into protein and oils.

01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:14.330
So the dream here and it has
to be some amount of reality,

01:18:14.330 --> 01:18:16.050
is that there'll be certain markets

01:18:16.050 --> 01:18:18.590
that can be figured out,
that can take carbon

01:18:19.525 --> 01:18:21.760
either dense at first
and maybe change later

01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.340
and convert it in the value.

01:18:23.340 --> 01:18:26.350
Now my favorite example is
a company called CarbonCure,

01:18:27.200 --> 01:18:31.330
they inject co2 as the
cement is being mixed,

01:18:31.330 --> 01:18:32.770
that creates...

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.530
Here's that chemistry right here.

01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.857
It takes the calcium and the carbon

01:18:37.857 --> 01:18:40.420
and it makes it a solid limestone,

01:18:40.420 --> 01:18:43.730
it turns out that means
you need less concrete.

01:18:43.730 --> 01:18:48.400
So the cost of using carbon
cure, you can recover

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:51.293
by selling less concrete and
the concrete is stronger.

01:18:52.150 --> 01:18:54.350
And now you've taken
co2 that would have been

01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:58.690
in the atmosphere and instead
it's in your concrete.

01:18:58.690 --> 01:18:59.973
Yes?

01:18:59.973 --> 01:19:04.556
(background noise drowns other sounds)

01:19:12.067 --> 01:19:16.400
No, that's included in their
process, is to do that.

01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:20.440
So there's gonna have to
be some invention here

01:19:20.440 --> 01:19:21.623
in these areas, yes.

01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:25.680
That's exactly the right question,

01:19:25.680 --> 01:19:27.263
exactly the right question.

01:19:28.802 --> 01:19:29.635
(students applauding)

01:19:29.635 --> 01:19:30.635
There we go.

01:19:31.520 --> 01:19:33.580
Okay, how much price on
carbon would have to be

01:19:33.580 --> 01:19:36.500
to make one of these
things financially viable?

01:19:36.500 --> 01:19:37.420
For some of these things

01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:39.553
that we've looked at, it's $30 $40.

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:44.690
It's in the range where an
affordable price of carbon

01:19:44.690 --> 01:19:46.090
might trigger our market.

01:19:46.090 --> 01:19:49.710
Now California currently
doesn't anticipate this

01:19:49.710 --> 01:19:54.380
but you've got this large amounts
of money coming into this.

01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:57.290
Something good might
happen out of this process.

01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:59.900
Now I realized that that
was the last question

01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:02.410
and I'm happy to stick around afterwards

01:20:02.410 --> 01:20:04.180
but let me try to summarize

01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:05.780
and leave you with a conclusion.

01:20:08.436 --> 01:20:10.540
When I started this talk, working on it,

01:20:10.540 --> 01:20:12.990
I said well I'll be
depressing but it's the truth

01:20:13.830 --> 01:20:17.850
will set you free but I
actually got really excited

01:20:17.850 --> 01:20:20.170
after going through all this
of thinking all the things

01:20:20.170 --> 01:20:23.140
that can be added into what
we already know how to do

01:20:23.140 --> 01:20:25.764
and the fact that we actually have 13,

01:20:25.764 --> 01:20:26.760
you know, we have 12 years,

01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:28.500
that's a reasonable length of time,

01:20:28.500 --> 01:20:30.290
that this could all happen.

01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:32.120
So we're going to decarbonize electricity

01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:35.470
and electrify everything
we can, that's happening.

01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:38.493
There's a company that's announced
an electric pickup truck.

01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:43.160
Now the thing about an
electric pickup truck

01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:48.160
is it has way more power
than a diesel pickup truck,

01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:51.300
huge amounts more, you
can run it all day long

01:20:51.300 --> 01:20:53.163
in your garage with the door closed.

01:20:54.250 --> 01:20:56.250
I mean it's got all of these advantages.

01:20:56.250 --> 01:20:57.730
So you can imagine a scenario

01:20:57.730 --> 01:21:01.160
where suddenly the hot
pickup truck and that is the,

01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:03.690
you know, that is the
largest selling vehicle

01:21:03.690 --> 01:21:06.690
in the United States in any category,

01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:10.210
suddenly becomes, you know,
you get the price right.

01:21:10.210 --> 01:21:11.880
Who would wanted diesel pickup truck

01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:14.120
if you can have an electric one.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:16.136
Oh, you would like a diesel pickup truck?

01:21:16.136 --> 01:21:16.969
(background noise drowns other sounds)

01:21:16.969 --> 01:21:20.417
I'm sorry ma'am you'll have
to give me your book (laughs).

01:21:22.636 --> 01:21:23.484
What?

01:21:23.484 --> 01:21:24.344
(background noise drowns other sounds)

01:21:24.344 --> 01:21:25.613
Yeah, the Ford F-150, yeah.

01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:29.400
So we're gonna decarbonize liquid fuels,

01:21:29.400 --> 01:21:31.960
it's another target behind this.

01:21:31.960 --> 01:21:35.040
We have to expand natural
system sequestration,

01:21:35.040 --> 01:21:38.266
forest lands, agricultural
lands, whatever,

01:21:38.266 --> 01:21:40.650
that's where a lot of
the work is shifting,

01:21:40.650 --> 01:21:44.210
is how do you do that in a way
that's really going to work.

01:21:44.210 --> 01:21:46.710
We have to scale electric
vehicles at four times

01:21:46.710 --> 01:21:48.260
the rate we're currently doing.

01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:50.990
And then we have to start figuring out

01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:54.630
how to take carbon and convert
it into something, a value.

01:21:54.630 --> 01:21:56.910
We need a receptive
federal government by 2021

01:21:56.910 --> 01:21:59.040
which will be elections
and in that timeframe

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:00.810
will bring big oil to the table.

01:22:00.810 --> 01:22:03.290
So that's my path to success.

01:22:03.290 --> 01:22:06.080
I can take questions after we adjourn

01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:09.910
but let me show you...

01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:12.018
There's always this
small chance that maybe

01:22:12.018 --> 01:22:15.030
we forgot something and all this

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:18.710
is gonna self-correct
automatically by nature.

01:22:18.710 --> 01:22:20.390
What happens then?

01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:22.480
Well, what if it's a big hoax

01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.371
and we create a bigger
better world for nothing?

01:22:25.371 --> 01:22:26.204
(students laughing)

01:22:26.204 --> 01:22:28.220
I can live with that, I hope you can too.

01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:29.646
Thank you very much.

01:22:29.646 --> 01:22:31.966
(students applauding)

01:22:31.966 --> 01:22:34.549
(bright music)
