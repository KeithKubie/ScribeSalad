DEENA SHAKIR: Thanks for tuning
in to this special edition

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.690
of Google Developers Live.

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.990
Today we're featuring Reshma
Saujani, from Girls Who Code,

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.900
in celebration of Computer
Science Education Week.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.830
Hello and thanks for joining us.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.680
My name is Deena
Shakir, and I work

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.320
with google.org, the social
impact arm of Google.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.380
I'm thrilled today to
introduce and welcome

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.890
my friend, Reshma Saujani,
the founder of Girls Who

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.050
Code, a role model
and public figure,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.440
who is here to talk about
her incredible vision

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.660
and work with this
organization, who

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.660
we are thrilled
to be supporting.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.020
Welcome, Reshma, and thank
you so much for joining us.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.100
RESHMA SAUJANI: I'm
so happy to be here.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.520
DEENA SHAKIR: We're
thrilled to have you.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.978
I'd like to start off with a
question about your own story,

00:00:42.978 --> 00:00:45.330
and if you could tell us a
bit about your career, which

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:46.913
has traversed so
many different fields

00:00:46.913 --> 00:00:49.610
and has landed you with this
incredible organization,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.160
from law, to politics, to
finance, and now to Girls

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.990
Who Code.

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.650
Can you tell us a bit about
what ultimately landed you

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:56.980
on this incredible idea?

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.330
RESHMA SAUJANI:
Sure, so in 2010, I

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.470
was running for Congress.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.281
And as you know, as someone who
has a long career in politics,

00:01:03.281 --> 00:01:05.530
when you run for office, you
talk to a lot of parents,

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.400
you go to a lot of schools,
you meet a lot of kids.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
And my district had some of the
wealthiest ZIP codes in America

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.860
and some of the poorest.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.640
And I remember being
in these schools

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.624
and watching some girls who
barely had a teacher who

00:01:17.624 --> 00:01:19.290
could help them use
a computer, and then

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.340
some places that had
more gadgets than kids

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.630
knew what to do with.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.521
And as someone who's
passionate about policy,

00:01:24.521 --> 00:01:26.270
it's clear where the
jobs are going to be.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.561
They're in the computing and
technology-related fields,

00:01:28.561 --> 00:01:31.370
almost 1.4 million jobs by 2020.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.130
But less than 50%
of them are going

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.600
to be filled by women, even
though we are 50% of the labor

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.400
force, 50% of those grad-- we
literally own the internet.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.320
But young girls are not
going into these fields.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.650
And so I wanted to do
something about it.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.800
And so I brought
20 girls together,

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.890
put them into a classroom
at a technology company,

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.860
convened a bunch of computer
scientists and academics

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.627
to develop a curriculum that
was very targeted at girls,

00:01:55.627 --> 00:01:57.210
and I thought, let's
see what happens.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.719
And it was a tremendous first
year because all of our girls

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.260
learned how to code-- because
that wasn't clear when we first

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.410
put them in that classroom
at AppNexus-- and two,

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.490
they fell in love
with computer science,

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.610
and they built things that
would change the world.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.990
And we realized that we
were really on to something

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.210
and that we needed to get
the resources together

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:18.840
to really have more girls who
are learning computer science

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.340
education.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.090
DEENA SHAKIR: That's
fantastic, so can you

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.340
tell us a bit about where
Girls Who Code is now

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.720
and how you went from
that group of 20 girls

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.471
to what is going to be a
nationwide, and potentially

00:02:28.471 --> 00:02:29.470
international, movement.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.010
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah, so
we started with 20 girls

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.980
in New York, and the following
year, we went from one program

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.020
to 8 programs, so we
taught about 152 girls

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.350
in New York, Detroit,
and then in California.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.660
And this year, our goal
is to launch 16 programs,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.710
have classes in Boston,
Seattle, New York, California,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.090
and Miami, and to also,
through the support of Google,

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.622
to launch Girls Who Code clubs.

00:02:53.622 --> 00:02:55.080
Because we realized
that, you know,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.740
young girls are not
monolithic, right,

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.040
on one end of the
spectrum there girls

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.316
that know they're
passionate about technology,

00:03:01.316 --> 00:03:02.690
they just don't
know where to go.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:04.648
And that's really our
summer immersion program,

00:03:04.648 --> 00:03:06.550
our eight week,
intensive summer camp,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.450
where the girls learn the basics
of computer science education,

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.130
they get exposure to female
mentors and role models,

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.060
and they learn how to build
stuff that changes the world.

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.900
Our Girls Who Code
clubs are the place

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.130
to really-- your first
experience with computer

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.850
science, right.

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:24.510
So we have two hours
of coding a week,

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.150
resulting in 36 hours
of coding a year.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.940
And we hope that these Girls Who
Code clubs will become funnels

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.447
into our summer camp,
our summer program.

00:03:32.447 --> 00:03:33.280
DEENA SHAKIR: Great.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.540
So in coming up with your
methodology and curriculum,

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.700
can you talk a bit about what
it is that differentiates Girls

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.420
Who Code and how the curriculum
is tailored in such a way as

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.270
to attract more
girls specifically?

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:44.890
RESHMA SAUJANI: So
we really convened

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.770
people who had
experience in one,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.630
not only in computer science,
but in teaching girls.

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.580
And so we made sure that our
curriculum exposed young girls

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.210
to, like I said, female
mentors, but also got

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.830
them the fundamentals
and the basics.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.840
Because oftentimes,
I think girls

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.100
think, computer science, it's
too hard, like I can't do this.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.880
And they have to get really used
to failure in getting the code,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.338
or getting algorithm wrong,
and then trying again, and then

00:04:08.338 --> 00:04:10.176
trying again, and
then trying again.

00:04:10.176 --> 00:04:11.800
And then they also
have to build things

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.110
that are about
changing the world.

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:14.600
When you ask most
high school girls what

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:16.850
they want to do with their life,
they want to change the world.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:19.070
They want a career that's
going to help them do that.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:21.740
That's why you see more young
girls going into medicine,

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:24.360
going into law, even going
into forensic science,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.160
because they see the
clear relationship

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.130
between those
industries and change.

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.200
And so our curriculum
makes that connection

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.480
to them in a specific context.

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.890
So we have Twitter
come, and they

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.190
build something on their API.

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.820
We do projects with
Intel, with Google.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:43.450
So they can actually create
things using their API

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.180
to actually change the
world and to build products

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.680
that are going to
help them do that.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.560
DEENA SHAKIR: It sounds
like they come up

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:49.820
with pretty amazing projects.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:51.195
RESHMA SAUJANI:
Amazing projects.

00:04:51.195 --> 00:04:53.640
I remember our first
year, we had a girl

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.230
who was five years old when
her father got diagnosed

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.490
with cancer, and so she wanted
to be a doctor, because she

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:00.830
wanted to save her dad's life.

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:03.710
And she didn't know how
computer science was connected

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:06.590
to medicine, until the last two
weeks of our program, where she

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.450
built an algorithm
to help detect

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:10.320
whether a cancer is
benign or malignant.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:11.070
DEENA SHAKIR: Wow.

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.700
RESHMA SAUJANI: She
was 16 years old.

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.020
This year, I remember the
most awesome experience

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.320
was the girls had an opportunity
to meet Sheryl Sandberg.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.870
And so we're all sitting
around this conference room,

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.010
and Sheryl walks past
the conference room.

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:26.150
It had these huge windows.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.670
And the girls literally
start screaming

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.836
like she was Beyonce, right.

00:05:28.836 --> 00:05:31.310
It was awesome, these
amazing little girls

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.460
geeks so excited to
see Sheryl Sandberg.

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.260
And then they get up
in twos and threes,

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.520
and they present to Sheryl
the Facebook apps that they

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.810
had built, and they were
fearless, like unabashed.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.110
I don't know if I could
have done that at 16, right,

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.790
present to the CEO of Facebook
and to tell her why that they

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.280
should take the app that they
built and put it into market.

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.630
It was amazing.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.940
It's so huge for them in
terms of confidence building.

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:59.090
So our girls have
built video games.

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.080
They built an app
called Let It Flow

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.090
to help find a public
bathroom, which

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:04.729
is again an important thing.

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:06.770
They built apps on bullying,
they built-- I mean,

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.144
anything that you
could think of,

00:06:08.144 --> 00:06:10.780
but I think the common thread
is they built things that

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:13.220
were about making their
communities better, helping

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.730
their families, again, making
the world a better place.

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:17.990
That's where their interest
level is really at.

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:20.320
DEENA SHAKIR: So computer
science and technology

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:23.287
is no longer a separate field,
it's a way of doing everything.

00:06:23.287 --> 00:06:25.120
Can you talk about why
it's important for us

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.520
to have diverse minds
helping to create products

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.405
that we use in
everyday circumstances?

00:06:29.405 --> 00:06:30.780
RESHMA SAUJANI:
I just think it's

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:33.520
about having the best
and the brightest minds

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.780
helping us solve
everyday problems.

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:38.270
And to me it's just crazy,
when you think about the fact

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.710
that last year, 4,000 girls
took the AP computer science

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:43.860
exam, that's it.

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.870
Less than 7,500 women
graduated in computer science--

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.080
again defining
that broadly-- even

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:51.630
though 56% of our
labor force are women.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:54.920
We just simply can't
out-innovate as a nation

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:57.180
unless we have half
of our labor force,

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.410
again, working to
solve these problems.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:02.050
And we talked about this.

00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:03.940
The United States is
also kind of behind when

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:06.540
it comes to other nations,
right-- the Middle East,

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:09.040
in some countries in the Middle
East, more female engineers,

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.310
India, more female engineers,
China, more female engineers.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.200
Around the world, they are
inspiring their young girls

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.970
to stand up and raise
their hand and say I

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:18.340
want to become a
computer scientist,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.715
I want to be a
software engineer,

00:07:19.715 --> 00:07:20.827
I want to be a programmer.

00:07:20.827 --> 00:07:22.660
We need to do the same
thing in this country

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:24.427
because our economy is changing.

00:07:24.427 --> 00:07:26.510
We're moving away from
being a manufacturing-based

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:28.160
to a service-based economy.

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.320
We're going to have
to build things,

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.249
and every person, in order
to think about-- I mean,

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:35.290
I hate to say this, but
it's like I tell parents,

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:37.630
don't tell your kids to major
in East Asian studies any more.

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:38.511
I hope you didn't major
in East Asian studies.

00:07:38.511 --> 00:07:39.469
DEENA SHAKIR: I didn't.

00:07:39.469 --> 00:07:40.500
I almost did.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.250
RESHMA SAUJANI: We
need to major in things

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:44.280
that you can actually
go out and get a job in.

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:48.069
And you can make $80,000
a year being a programmer.

00:07:48.069 --> 00:07:48.610
That's a lot.

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:51.289
That's a lot of money for
families here in this country.

00:07:51.289 --> 00:07:52.330
DEENA SHAKIR: Absolutely.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:53.400
RESHMA SAUJANI: And
we see that happen

00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.983
with our young girls,
many of them who

00:07:54.983 --> 00:07:56.500
come from under-served
communities,

00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.020
when they graduate
Girls Who Code,

00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.311
they're able to build websites.

00:07:59.311 --> 00:08:01.154
They're getting jobs to do that.

00:08:01.154 --> 00:08:03.570
And so they're going to lift
their families out of poverty

00:08:03.570 --> 00:08:06.880
and put them into upward
mobility, into the middle class

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.720
by learning this 21st century
skill set that is so critical.

00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.150
DEENA SHAKIR: There's been a
narrative over the last two

00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:16.750
decades, really, on girls and
STEM, sort of more broadly,

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:20.310
in science, technology and
medicine, and engineering.

00:08:20.310 --> 00:08:22.720
Why is that you think
that, for computer science

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.290
specifically,
there's actually been

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:26.630
an attrition in the number
of women majoring in computer

00:08:26.630 --> 00:08:28.746
science in the last
20 years, whereas many

00:08:28.746 --> 00:08:30.810
of the other fields
are actually rising?

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:32.851
RESHMA SAUJANI: Right, I
mean Steve Jobs probably

00:08:32.851 --> 00:08:34.470
had more women on
his original team

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:36.091
than any tech
entrepreneur has today.

00:08:36.091 --> 00:08:38.049
So it's the one industry
where there's actually

00:08:38.049 --> 00:08:38.675
been a decline.

00:08:38.675 --> 00:08:40.757
I've been giving a lot of
thought to this, I mean,

00:08:40.757 --> 00:08:42.549
I think it has a lot
to do with culture.

00:08:42.549 --> 00:08:45.310
And 20 years ago, it
was the Barbie, right,

00:08:45.310 --> 00:08:48.570
who said math is tough,
let's go shopping, right.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.550
And just 2 years ago,
I bought a t-shirt

00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.840
that says, basically,
algebra sucks, in Forever 21.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:57.480
So culture has still
told young girls,

00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.890
math and science
are not for you.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.020
It's OK to say that
you're not good at it,

00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:02.200
even though you really are.

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.940
We're sending the exact wrong
messages to our young girls,

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:08.410
and we need to flip
it, and we need

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:12.410
to use pop culture to actually
inspire our young girls to get

00:09:12.410 --> 00:09:13.700
involved in technology.

00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:15.616
And that's what we're
doing at Girls Who Code.

00:09:15.616 --> 00:09:18.160
We had, one of the things we
did with our gorls in Detroit

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:20.690
is they built-- they had their
robots dance to the Harlem

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:23.460
Shake, where the girls
actually did dance with them.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.370
I mean, we're using
pop culture to get

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.110
girls excited about
computer science.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:29.050
DEENA SHAKIR: Yeah.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:30.380
How do you think your life
would have been different

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:31.880
if you had the chance to
participate in Girls Who

00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:33.090
Code when you were
in high school?

00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:34.840
RESHMA SAUJANI: So
much different, I mean,

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:37.540
I grew up with a-- both
parents of mine were engineers,

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:41.130
and I was terrified of math
and science growing up.

00:09:41.130 --> 00:09:42.762
And it lasted
throughout my career,

00:09:42.762 --> 00:09:44.970
throughout my career in
finance, throughout my career

00:09:44.970 --> 00:09:45.770
in politics.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:48.980
And even for me now it's--
so much of what I do,

00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.399
when I was in politics, was
about building my website,

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:53.440
right, being able to
communicate on social media.

00:09:53.440 --> 00:09:56.480
I wish that I could go in and
make a change to my website

00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.177
by myself.

00:09:57.177 --> 00:09:59.635
One of the things we've done
at Girls Who Code this year is

00:09:59.635 --> 00:10:01.260
really mandate that
everybody on staff,

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:03.120
including me, has to
learn how to code.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:07.380
We can't be an organization that
is promoting computer science

00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:10.930
if all of our employees
don't also know how to code.

00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:13.040
I mean, I really
believe that the future

00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.370
is about mandatory CS education.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:15.871
We need it.

00:10:15.871 --> 00:10:17.245
DEENA SHAKIR:
Yeah, it definitely

00:10:17.245 --> 00:10:19.540
is 21st century literacy,
and there is a big language

00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.310
barrier, particularly in
tech, but increasingly

00:10:21.310 --> 00:10:23.380
across all fields if you
can't speak the language.

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.588
RESHMA SAUJANI: Right, it's
like reading and writing.

00:10:25.588 --> 00:10:26.510
DEENA SHAKIR: Exactly.

00:10:26.510 --> 00:10:28.260
So we have an audience
of developers here.

00:10:28.260 --> 00:10:30.725
How can developers
and parents and adults

00:10:30.725 --> 00:10:33.100
who are interested in helping
to promote computer science

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.475
education for
girls help you out?

00:10:34.475 --> 00:10:35.349
RESHMA SAUJANI: Yeah.

00:10:35.349 --> 00:10:37.170
So through this
amazing partnership

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:39.390
that we have with Google,
we need more volunteers.

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:42.080
We have set out to
teach thousands of girls

00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:44.204
how to code through our
Girls Who Code clubs.

00:10:44.204 --> 00:10:46.120
And since we have a
dearth of computer science

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.840
teachers in our country, we
are reliant on volunteers,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:52.040
and these volunteers
are developers.

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.280
And so anybody who
is watching this,

00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:56.380
please sign up to
volunteer at a Girls

00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.730
Who Code club, which we're
launching in New York, Detroit,

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:03.250
we have clubs in Boston,
and then here in California.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.335
We had a hundred girls show up
at the San Diego Public Library

00:11:06.335 --> 00:11:07.210
to learn how to code.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:10.830
It's amazing what's happening,
and we can teach as many girls

00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.800
as we have volunteer
teachers to teach.

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:13.800
DEENA SHAKIR: Excellent.

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.610
Now if you're successful
in your mission,

00:11:15.610 --> 00:11:18.530
where do you see the ecosystem
at in 5 years, in 10 years?

00:11:18.530 --> 00:11:21.110
RESHMA SAUJANI: Ah, so I think
that this is kind of a 2050

00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.270
problem, and I have to
tell myself that everyday,

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:25.905
because many of our
successes are incremental,

00:11:25.905 --> 00:11:28.030
and they feel like it's
slow, but it's really fast,

00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:29.380
if that makes sense.

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:31.720
Again, I go back to telling
myself, in the '70s,

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:34.250
10% of women were
lawyers and doctors,

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:37.170
and now that number
is almost over 40%,

00:11:37.170 --> 00:11:38.810
less than 40 years later.

00:11:38.810 --> 00:11:41.050
That's where I
want to be, that's

00:11:41.050 --> 00:11:42.870
where we want to be
as an organization.

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.700
So it's going to take
some time, and it's

00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:47.730
going to take collaboration,
which we've also talked about.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.490
There's so many
amazing organizations

00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:51.560
that are in this space,
from Black Girls Code,

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.330
to Code.org, to
what GoldieBlox did

00:11:54.330 --> 00:11:56.690
two weeks ago with their
Beastie Boy video that

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:58.910
inspired so many young girls.

00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:00.830
My 10-year-old niece
is learning how

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:02.460
to code through Code Academy.

00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:05.230
So we all are working
together to really solve

00:12:05.230 --> 00:12:07.434
this tremendous,
tremendous problem, which

00:12:07.434 --> 00:12:09.600
I think is, again, the most
important domestic issue

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:10.202
of our time.

00:12:10.202 --> 00:12:12.160
DEENA SHAKIR: How can
parents specifically help

00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.110
to encourage their
girls to get into CS?

00:12:14.110 --> 00:12:15.380
RESHMA SAUJANI: Parents
are our biggest advocates.

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.759
I mean, studies show-- Girl
Scouts did a great study,

00:12:17.759 --> 00:12:19.300
and it's girls in
STEM, and it showed

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:21.091
that most of the girls
that went into STEM,

00:12:21.091 --> 00:12:22.260
it was because of a parent.

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:24.380
A parent had encouraged
them to go into STEM.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:26.740
They had introduced them to
an engineer or a programmer.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:29.710
They had opened up this
amazing world to them.

00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:31.519
So parents are key to that.

00:12:31.519 --> 00:12:34.060
Also, when we think about how
we get volunteers at our clubs,

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.500
it's having a parent who is
an advocate at a school who

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:38.100
can actually teach,
who can change

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:41.090
the minds of administrators,
making this an important issue.

00:12:41.090 --> 00:12:42.460
Parents are voters.

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.450
We still don't have
enough elected officials

00:12:44.450 --> 00:12:46.750
around the country who realize
how critical of an issue

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.720
this is.

00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.362
And so we all need
to be basically

00:12:49.362 --> 00:12:51.820
standing up, stepping up, and
saying that this is something

00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:53.249
that we need to
push as a nation.

00:12:53.249 --> 00:12:55.540
DEENA SHAKIR: Thank you so
much for joining us, Reshma,

00:12:55.540 --> 00:12:58.460
and for your incredible efforts
in this organization, and all

00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:01.080
the work that you do to get more
girls into computer science,

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.060
and helping to shape
the future of our world.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.730
RESHMA SAUJANI:
Thank you, Deena,

00:13:03.730 --> 00:13:05.380
and thank you for everything
that you and Google have

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:07.046
done to really support
our organization.

00:13:07.046 --> 00:13:10.436
We wouldn't be able to
do this work without you.

00:13:10.436 --> 00:13:12.060
DEENA SHAKIR: Thank
you for joining us.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:14.180
We've been sitting down
with Reshma Saujani,

00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:16.270
the founder of Girls Who Code.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:18.210
For more information
on Girls Who Code,

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.434
check them out online,
girlswhocode.com.

00:13:21.434 --> 00:13:25.400
Make sure to join in on the
fun at CSEdWeek.org, where

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:27.370
you can participate
in an Hour of Code

00:13:27.370 --> 00:13:30.580
during Computer
Science Education Week.
