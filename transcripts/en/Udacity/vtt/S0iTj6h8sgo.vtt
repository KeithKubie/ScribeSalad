00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.000
So I'm going to start off with for

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.240
job in work dot jobs, which is giving me the jobs array in the work object.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.510
Then I'm going to append HTMLworkStart to the work experience div,

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:14.970
which we can see right here in our HTML.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.110
Then, I'm going to work on formatting the employer in the title.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:21.136
To do so, I use the HTMLworkEmployer and

00:00:21.136 --> 00:00:24.096
HTMLworkTitle strings that are in helper.js.

00:00:24.096 --> 00:00:26.122
Calling the replace method on both of them,.

00:00:26.122 --> 00:00:29.710
I will replace the placeholder data with our employer and

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.060
our title from the work.jobs object.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.556
Notice here I'm using job, the iterator from the for

00:00:36.556 --> 00:00:42.060
in loop, as the index of the job that we want inside the work.jobs object.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:44.470
This variable, formatted employer title,

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.490
is a concatenation of formatted employer and formatted title.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.980
We're just adding them together.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.490
This last line here .appends the formatted employer title,

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.230
which we just created to .work-entry:last.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.190
Now this is an interesting syntax.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.180
In jQuery, we're selecting every object with a class work-entry.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.210
We know we want a class because it has a dot in front of it.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.250
But then, this colon last tells us that we specifically want to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.200
append this formatted employer title to the last element

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.060
with the class work-entry on the page, which should be the one we just created.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.450
Let's go ahead and check our work.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.870
We've refreshed the page and we can see that within the work experience section,

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.040
we can see our two entries for

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.180
work experience for Planet Express and Panucci's Pizza.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.180
&gt;&gt; And it looks good too
