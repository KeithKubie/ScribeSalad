<i> - Here's the best part.</i>

00:00:06.005 --> 00:00:08.474
The front door of the Freak Bus
was a stripper's booty,

00:00:08.507 --> 00:00:12.311
so when the door opened, it was
like a stripper booty opened,

00:00:12.344 --> 00:00:16.149
and then it's strippers
walking out of a stripper.

00:00:16.182 --> 00:00:17.984
[laughter]

00:00:18.017 --> 00:00:19.485
And I'm 20 years old,

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:22.488
and I'm standing there
and I'm just like, "Yo!"

00:00:22.521 --> 00:00:24.490
Welcome to "This is Not
Happening."

00:00:24.523 --> 00:00:26.325

Now, tonight's episode--
it's not for the faint of heart.

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.833
In fact, you might even
want to cover your ears.

00:00:33.866 --> 00:00:35.768

[cheers and applause]

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:36.896
You know this man
from his work

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:38.498
on "The Daily Show"
with Trevor Noah.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:40.399
<i> Roy Wood, Jr.!</i>

00:01:40.432 --> 00:01:43.102
<i> [cheers and applause]</i>

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:44.904
College, if nothing else,

00:01:44.937 --> 00:01:48.407
is an opportunity for you
to experience other cultures.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.076
I grew up
in Birmingham, Alabama.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:53.079
Birmingham in the '90s
was very black and white.

00:01:53.112 --> 00:01:54.747
There wasn't a lot of diversity
in the city.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.916
So when I went to college
in Tallahassee,

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.784
this was my first time
experiencing

00:01:58.817 --> 00:02:02.588
all these different cultures
and foods and people.

00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:04.023
And music was the one thing

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:06.425
that I really got
my nose open to, man,

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:08.928
'cause I thought it was just,
you know, Southern rap.

00:02:08.961 --> 00:02:10.663
I thought it was just Outkast

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:13.933
and, you know, a little bit
of NWA, you know.

00:02:13.966 --> 00:02:16.602
And I got to college,
and my roommate Kuda,

00:02:16.635 --> 00:02:19.272
my homeboy, he put me
on the Wu-Tang Clan.

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.773
[scattered cheers]

00:02:20.806 --> 00:02:22.341
It was dope.
I go, "Who are these dudes?

00:02:22.374 --> 00:02:25.144
Why do they think they ninjas?
Who are they?"

00:02:25.177 --> 00:02:28.214
[laughter]

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:31.984
'Cause that's what I thought
Wu-Tang was.

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:34.453
Just a bunch of niggas
who think they Shaolin ninjas.

00:02:34.486 --> 00:02:37.823
[laughter]

00:02:37.856 --> 00:02:39.625
Yeah.

00:02:39.658 --> 00:02:41.294
But the most moving music
I got exposed to

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:44.964
while I was in college
was Miami Bass.

00:02:44.997 --> 00:02:49.001
Miami Bass music was amazing.

00:02:49.034 --> 00:02:52.305
Hands down, Luther Campbell
of 2 Live Crew

00:02:52.338 --> 00:02:58.010
is the most important rapper
in the history of the genre.

00:02:58.043 --> 00:02:59.979
Matter of fact,
I'll double down on that.

00:03:00.012 --> 00:03:02.148
Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew,

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:07.320
the most important musician
of the last 30 years, period.

00:03:07.353 --> 00:03:10.656
Last 30 years, Luther Campbell,
2 Live Crew--

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.760
all they did was make songs
about sex.

00:03:14.793 --> 00:03:18.264
That's it. Every song: sex.

00:03:18.297 --> 00:03:22.101
They had song titles like
"Pop That Coochie."

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:24.170
"Me So Horny,"

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:27.006
"Throw the Dick."

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:30.176
"Doo Doo Brown." I don't know
what that one meant.

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.778
[laughter]

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:35.348
But the music was rhythmic,
and it was just--

00:03:35.381 --> 00:03:37.216
[imitating bass line]

00:03:37.249 --> 00:03:39.518
And you could always hear
a girl in the background

00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:44.890
of every Miami Bass song...
[imitating vocal hook]

00:03:44.923 --> 00:03:48.127
[alternating bass lines
and vocal hook]

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.131
But I don't know
if it was sex or singing.

00:03:52.164 --> 00:03:53.566
But you could hear it
in the bass.

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:55.968
Oh, my God, the bass.

00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:57.870
The bass of this music, man.

00:03:57.903 --> 00:04:00.039
This is what originated,
white people.

00:04:00.072 --> 00:04:01.974
This is the stuff that was
shaking your car

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:05.378
when a Cutlass
would pass by you

00:04:05.411 --> 00:04:08.247
in 1993...

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.882
with a booming-ass system

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:12.752
with that Miami Bass shit
rattling the trunk.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:16.022
[imitates bass line]

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:27.967
Luther Campbell's music
was so obscene

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.638
that record store owners
were arrested for selling it.

00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:36.142
That's how crazy it was
back in the day.

00:04:36.175 --> 00:04:39.078
So Luther Campbell decided
to be a little, you know--

00:04:39.111 --> 00:04:40.813
He decided to you know--
"You know what?

00:04:40.846 --> 00:04:42.915
"I got an idea
to keep these shop owners

00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:44.016
"from getting in trouble,

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:46.986
"I'm gonna label my albums

00:04:47.019 --> 00:04:49.922
so that people know
that it's vulgar."

00:04:49.955 --> 00:04:51.791
He created what we know today

00:04:51.824 --> 00:04:54.427
as the Parental Advisory
sticker.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.431
He created that, nobody else.

00:04:58.464 --> 00:05:00.366
They still arrested him
for obscenity

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:04.437
for performing hit songs,
such as "Throw That Dick"...

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.373
[laughter]

00:05:07.406 --> 00:05:08.607
And "Pop That Coochie."

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:11.777
[laughter]

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.446
But he was the only one
that was getting arrested

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:16.449
that had the guts to take
the government head on, man.

00:05:16.482 --> 00:05:20.453
This dude took the government
head on and won.

00:05:20.486 --> 00:05:22.021
He won, and because of that,

00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:24.724
any performer
that you can name right now--

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:26.692
the only reason you can
buy their shit

00:05:26.725 --> 00:05:30.029
like a regular fucking American
is because Luther Campbell

00:05:30.062 --> 00:05:31.864
fought for the First Amendment

00:05:31.897 --> 00:05:33.499
to be able to say
whatever the hell

00:05:33.532 --> 00:05:35.034
he wanted to say on a song.

00:05:35.067 --> 00:05:37.636
[cheers and applause]

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:39.906
And...

00:05:42.841 --> 00:05:45.978
He said a lot
of freaky stuff.

00:05:46.011 --> 00:05:48.748
He had a van. I don't even know
how to describe this,

00:05:48.781 --> 00:05:51.484
but he was a pioneer
of promotion as well.

00:05:51.517 --> 00:05:53.819
And any rap group
that you see now

00:05:53.852 --> 00:05:56.322
that has a van with all
of the logos wrapped

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:59.992
and all the design--
Luther Campbell did it first.

00:06:00.025 --> 00:06:02.495
They had a freak van.

00:06:02.528 --> 00:06:05.664
That's what it was called.
It was called Luke's Freak Van.

00:06:05.697 --> 00:06:07.366
And the 2 Live Crew van,

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:10.336
you'd be outside a nightclub
at 2:00 in the morning.

00:06:10.369 --> 00:06:14.240
And you could hear this van
coming from around the corner...

00:06:14.273 --> 00:06:17.176
with that booming-ass
bass subwoofer.

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:19.612
The license plate rattling.

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:24.016
[imitating bass line]

00:06:24.049 --> 00:06:26.018
[imitating vocal hook]

00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:29.288
[imitating bass line]

00:06:30.556 --> 00:06:33.192
And you'd go outside,
and you'd see this van

00:06:33.225 --> 00:06:37.196
turning the corner, and it had
the neon lights on the bottom.

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:39.031
It had neon lights on the top.

00:06:39.064 --> 00:06:42.701
It was like one of them
Scooby-Doo kidnap vans.

00:06:42.734 --> 00:06:44.537
But it had partitions.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.073
There were Plexiglas partitions
in the back part of the van,

00:06:48.106 --> 00:06:50.042
where you could
look inside the glass,

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:52.411
and inside the glass is a woman

00:06:52.444 --> 00:06:55.214
just shaking her ass.

00:06:55.247 --> 00:06:57.783
I'm 18 years old,

00:06:57.816 --> 00:07:00.252
and there is a van cruising by

00:07:00.285 --> 00:07:03.489
with half-naked women
just popping their ass.

00:07:03.522 --> 00:07:05.958
And I did what any 18-year-old
would have done.

00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:10.496
I chased this van...

00:07:10.529 --> 00:07:12.832
all the way up
West Tennessee Street.

00:07:12.865 --> 00:07:17.403
I'm running alongside
the Luke Freak Van,

00:07:17.436 --> 00:07:20.272
trying to get a glimpse.

00:07:20.305 --> 00:07:22.308
That's what Luke Dancers
were about, man.

00:07:22.341 --> 00:07:24.944
Luke Dancers, they were like
the Seal Team Six of stripping.

00:07:24.977 --> 00:07:27.813
I don't know how to--
how else to describe them,

00:07:27.846 --> 00:07:29.415
but it was just amazing stuff.

00:07:29.448 --> 00:07:33.486
And that was a lot
of my teenage years and college,

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:35.254
was going to Luke shows

00:07:35.287 --> 00:07:39.091
and just watching all of this
debauchery unfold onstage.

00:07:39.124 --> 00:07:41.427
So imagine my delight
couple years later,

00:07:41.460 --> 00:07:43.996
I'm interning
at a radio station.

00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:46.332
And my boss comes up, he goes,

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:49.602
"Hey,
I'm having a bachelor party,

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:53.272
if you want to come to
this bachelor party."

00:07:53.305 --> 00:07:55.541
I go, "Man, I'm 20.
Y-you cool?"

00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:57.443
And he says,
"I don't care if you're 20.

00:07:57.476 --> 00:08:01.480
Just come up.
There's gonna be Luke Dancers."

00:08:01.513 --> 00:08:04.283
[laughter]

00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:08.787
The Grinch-like smile
that came over my face

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.156
when I found out I had
an opportunity

00:08:11.189 --> 00:08:15.661
to be in the same building
as the Luke Dancers!

00:08:15.694 --> 00:08:17.296
So I go to this party.

00:08:17.329 --> 00:08:19.732
Not only do I go to this party,
I iron clothes.

00:08:19.765 --> 00:08:24.303
I ironed an outfit like I was
going to impress a Luke Dancer

00:08:24.336 --> 00:08:27.640
with a crease in my khakis.
"Well, hello.

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:31.744
Hello, Ms. Hip-Hop Stripper,
how are you doing?"

00:08:31.777 --> 00:08:33.846
So I go to this bachelor party,

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:36.081
and I'm sitting in the corner.

00:08:36.114 --> 00:08:38.918
And I don't know if you ever
been to a bachelor party

00:08:38.951 --> 00:08:40.586
before the strippers get there,

00:08:40.619 --> 00:08:42.588
but it's very awkward.

00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:44.256
It's very awkward.

00:08:44.289 --> 00:08:46.659
It's 20, 30 men just all
sitting there, and they just--

00:08:46.692 --> 00:08:49.595
[heavy breathing]

00:08:49.628 --> 00:08:51.063
