- All right.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.380
We got a big ass spot right
here, except for this thing.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.710
What is this white thing?

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.040
A sign used to hang
from it and rotate.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:11.120
We can get rid of it?

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.830
- You good with that?
- Yeah.

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.540
Taking it down?

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.210
Yeah.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:14.120
The ceiling?

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:15.170
Yeah.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.540
There's no other place for it.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.380
Painting on the
ceiling, I don't even

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.710
think Danny is going to notice.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.710
I bet he can walk right
through that door,

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.330
right up to Shane, say hello and
everything, and not even notice

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.170
it's there.

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.500
Gentleman's bet?

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.210
How am I going to
do a gentleman's bet?

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.920
I'm not a gentleman.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.580
OK, you want to bet that the
boss walks through the door

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.920
and doesn't even notice it?

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.580
I don't do well on bets.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.920
I never do, but I do have a
lot of confidence in myself.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.670
What are you going to
bet me that he's not

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.250
going to see this monstrous,
beautiful painting on

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.750
the ceiling that's all lit up?

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.210
All right.
All right.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.380
We're in a tattoo shop.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.000
Yeah.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
If he walks right past that
painting, notices nothing,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.750
you gotta get my
name tattooed on you.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.250
[laughing]

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.620
And if he notices, and if
he notices, which I know

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:06.920
he won't, he'll
walk right past it,

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.120
I'll get your name
tattooed on me.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.580
I'll even do the tattoo.

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.620
Oh, you're going to be sorry.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:12.710
You saw that, Shane, right?

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.120
- Yep, witnessed him.
- Walk.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.380
This is him.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:17.540
Hey, Shane, how you doing?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:18.620
Got it right there.
Don't worry.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.040
Nobody walks up like this.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:20.960
He's going to.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.080
See you later, brother.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.750
Later.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.290
Go, get, go.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.120
He's going to love it.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:27.380
It's a waste of time.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.420
What's up, Danny?

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.420
What's going down?

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.880
You guys tell me, man.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.380
It's my day off, you
guys are telling me, come

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.460
on down to the tattoo shop.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:41.920
I'm sensing something
wonderful up in my head.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:43.120
[laughing]

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.500
I have excellent peripheral.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.420
He didn't even look at it.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.750
I have excellent peripheral.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.500
How did you look us
in the eyes and you

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.120
notice that on your ceiling?
- Awesome.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.170
First of all, before
you even get to that,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.790
we wanted to show
our gratitude for you

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.830
letting us get our fresh,
beautiful ink on our arms.

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.830
- Thank you.
- There is art for art.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.000
OK.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.120
You gave us some?

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.290
So we gave you some.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:07.670
This art over
my head right now?

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.960
- Beautiful art.
- Really?

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.250
When am I allowed to look at it?

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.500
Well, I mean, it's
your tattoo shop.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.750
You're the boss.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.920
You can look at it
whenever you want.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.420
Oh, my.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:23.420
[music playing]

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.790
Are you kidding me?

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.460
We wanted something
that screamed, vampire.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:31.380
Dude, that is so, so wicked.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.500
I do have to admit, that's
got Mike written all over it.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.880
The depth of it is
unbelievable and

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.120
the originality of using the
mouth as a whole other scene

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.710
is so wicked.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.460
I mean, you've got eyes
that are actual 3D eyes.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.880
The eyes move.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.040
It's crazy.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.210
They kind of follow
you, don't they?

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.170
This is one of
your best pieces.

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.380
I think it is.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.670
And it looks
great in here, man.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.170
People are going to
trip out on that.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.790
And if I'm going to lose
a bet, I'd lose to this.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.460
Yeah, let's get
back to this bet.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.170
So the bet was, if you
walked through the shop

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.670
and did not notice the painting
way up there on the ceiling,

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.830
Mike would get my name
tattooed on his foot.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.580
But if you noticed
it right off the bat,

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:20.750
Brian would get Mike's
name tattooed on his foot.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.880
And you said you're going
to get his name and his face?

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.250
And his face.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.750
If I'm going to lose,
I'm going to lose big.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.250
Yeah, first shoot I
do, I'm wearing my horns.

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.750
[laughing]

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.380
He's getting that picture.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.170
OK.

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:34.420
OK.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.750
Well, bro, hey man,
you made that bet.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.580
I figured you'd know
that I would notice that.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.880
I just can't believe
you took this bet.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.380
So to me, this is hilarious.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:42.580
When does this happen?

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.000
Before it gets too
late, go into it.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.210
- Dive right into it.
- I think we should.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.040
Start getting you set up.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.880
Get your foot shaved,
because I have no doubt you

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.250
have hair on the bottom of it.

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.080
You mean today?

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.290
Yeah, man, today.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.620
I'm certain.
- Get your shoes off.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.420
No, get off my shoe.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:58.790
I know people here,
they're really good.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.460
You've got other clientele.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.250
He's got other
clientele before you.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.120
You agreed to the bet.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.250
Man, it's just Mike's
face, so you know,

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:12.250
it's going to take
Dave a minute.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.960
We could have done
this some other day.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.710
It's just going to
be a smiley face.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.960
[laughing]

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.210
This is going to hurt
so bad when you see it

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:23.790
because it's really accurate.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.460
[laughing]

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.120
I can't believe
you're making me do it.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.830
Dave is arguably one of
the greatest tattoo artists

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.170
that you ever would've
met in your life.

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.580
That's not helping.
That's not helping.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:36.620
- How's that feeling?
- It hurts.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.170
You're shaking the artist.

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.420
You're going to ruin
my beautiful face.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.000
You know, I always say
how Mike gets under my skin,

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.750
well, now he's
there permanently.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.000
I can't even die to
get away from this guy.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.290
This is hilarious.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:52.120
I can't believe
this happened today.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.080
That and I can't believe--

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.830
See, it's a good day.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.670
--that you just get your foot
drilled with horny Mike's face.

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.670
Good luck, man.
