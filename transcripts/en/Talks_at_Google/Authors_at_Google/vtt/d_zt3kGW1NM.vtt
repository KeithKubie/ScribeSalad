[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.827 --> 00:00:07.660
ANAND GIRIDHARADAS:
Thank you for having me.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.540
Look, we all recognize
the awkwardness

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.560
of me talking about the
elite charade of changing

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.290
the world at Google.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.970
So let's just name that
upfront, and be aware of that,

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:27.465
and be aware of our complicated
feelings we may have.

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:28.840
This is going to
be like therapy.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:42.340
I want to start by laying
out some kind of propositions

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.260
to you, and I say this in a
spirit of sharing with you some

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.980
of what I've found as I spent
the last three years thinking

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.760
about what happens when
the winners of our age

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.630
move with great sincerity to
try to solve some of our biggest

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.810
societal problems,
but also, in my view,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.840
end up having an effect
that they don't sometimes

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.780
understand, which is changing
how we think about change,

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.230
and redefining
change in ways that

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:13.810
makes it friendly
to winners and makes

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.971
it hard to make real change.

00:01:16.971 --> 00:01:18.970
I'm going to advance some
of these propositions,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.640
and then I'd really love to
have a dialogue with you,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.109
because we are here in
the belly of the beast.

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:26.650
The first proposition
is that we live

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.010
in an age of extraordinary
generosity by any measure.

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.150
Some of you may just have
seen the Bezos announcement

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.220
a couple hours ago, which
only is the latest installment

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:43.570
in very wealthy people
who've done very well, many

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.554
of them in the technology
realm, deciding

00:01:45.554 --> 00:01:48.220
they want to give back, deciding
they want to make a difference.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.980
There's 184 people who have
signed the Giving Pledge.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.450
I think American philanthropy
is now $410 billion a year

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.280
being given away,
which is starting

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.460
to approach the level of
nonmilitary discretionary

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.452
spending by the
federal government.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.000
Every young person-- and
that includes many of you--

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.077
but you go to any campus,
every young person

00:02:11.077 --> 00:02:12.160
wants to change the world.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.770
There are talks about
making a difference

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:17.596
in millions of lives.

00:02:17.596 --> 00:02:19.720
Starting a social enterprise--
people will tell you

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.136
they've just come
back from Africa

00:02:21.136 --> 00:02:23.050
where they started
some organization

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.240
to recycle poop into
coffee, or there's

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.910
all these kinds of
efforts everywhere

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.020
you look of elites using their
skills and talents to try

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.510
to respond to an age of extreme
inequality in the United

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.110
States, an age of extreme
anger, and do something.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.760
But the second proposition is
that we also cannot deny that

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.930
we live in an age of
extraordinary cruelty

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.540
in the United States, that this
is as unequal as our society

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.310
has been in 100 years.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.290
It's as tough a time to achieve
the American dream of building

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.300
a better life than your parents
as we've had in 100 years.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.070
When you look at economic growth
over the last 30 or 40 years,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.260
almost all the
benefits of growth

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.290
have bypassed the bottom
half of Americans.

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.380
About 117 million Americans
saw their average income go up

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.100
from $16,000 to $16,200
in the age of Google,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.240
and the genetics revolution,
and the rise of India and China,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.410
and automation, and everything
else Tom Friedman writes about.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.920
All of that amazing stuff--
the progress that you probably

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.820
see around you every day
in 50 different forms

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.980
somehow miraculously
bypassed the bottom line

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.000
of half of our country.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.710
It actually takes a
lot of engineering

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:46.710
to achieve that outcome.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.340
That is not a natural outcome.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.050
And so what I became
very interested

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.830
in is the question of, how do we
explain the extraordinary elite

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.450
helping of our time and the
extraordinary elite hoarding

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.950
of our time?

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.200
How do we understand the two
of those things together?

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.680
What is the relationship
between all these elites making

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.720
a difference and
all these elites

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.400
building a winners
take all economy that

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.990
only generally works for them?

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:18.510
And one possible answer is
that the elite helpfulness

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:21.510
is trying as hard as it
can, doing the most it can,

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:24.750
working as hard as it can,
disrupting things, and creating

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.360
things, but it's
just not fast enough.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.690
It's just a drop in the bucket.

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.600
That's one possibility.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:33.540
And I think that's probably
the conventional wisdom that's

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:34.350
out there.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.070
Yeah, we live in a very unequal
time, but people are helping.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.300
The ambulance is on the way.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.560
What I want to argue is a
more awkward proposition

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.130
in this space, which is
I've come to believe and be

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.480
persuaded that a lot of the
elite helpfulness in our time

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:58.240
is part of how we
maintain the hoarding.

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.700
We do giving in ways that
protect the opportunity

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:04.340
to keep taking.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.590
We make a difference
in ways that

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:11.120
protect the continued
opportunity to make a killing,

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.850
and we seek to change the
world in ways carefully chosen

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.970
to not change our world.

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:24.440
When you look at the ways in
which the winners of our age

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.650
give back, help out,
make a difference,

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:33.380
they are often designed to
protect the system above all

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.400
that the winners
stand on top of.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.190
And so I want to
explore what I think

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.300
of as the ideology behind a
lot of elite change making,

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:46.730
and it's an ideology
that'll be familiar to you.

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:49.970
It's an ideology that has a lot
of resonance in Silicon Valley.

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.590
It's also an idea that you hear
in Wall Street foundations,

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.630
and an idea you
can actually hear

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.410
every time you go to the
shopping mall and someone

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.052
pitches you a red
iPhone case that's

00:06:05.052 --> 00:06:07.010
going to change the world,
or a tote bag that's

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:09.860
going to change the
world, or coffee that's

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.450
going to change the world.

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.400
What's the ideology?

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:16.100
Something that you probably
have heard five times

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:17.390
in the last week--

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.520
the word win-win.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.010
How many of you have heard
that term in the last week

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.810
would you say?

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.972
How many of you have
used that term recently?

00:06:27.972 --> 00:06:29.430
And what's your
general impression?

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.674
Win-win-- good or bad?

00:06:31.674 --> 00:06:32.670
AUDIENCE: Good.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:33.120
ANAND GIRIDHARADAS: Good, right?

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:33.770
Positive.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.660
It's not just one victory.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.540
It's two.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.990
Double the pleasure,
double the fun.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.360
What I want to suggest
today is that win-win

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.910
is a more sinister and dangerous
ideology than we recognize,

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.170
and I know that's a little
mind bending, particularly

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:56.600
in an institution like
this that has created

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.980
some genuine win-wins
for the world,

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.610
but here's the problem with
a lot of what happens when

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:10.520
the win-win becomes our way of
thinking not about business,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.270
but about social change.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.600
Win-win starts to mean that the
only kind of social change that

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.810
is acceptable, or the kind
that should get the most

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:24.380
funding and the most attention
is the kind of social change

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:27.230
that kicks something
up to the powerful.

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.690
The only kinds of social
change that are good

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:31.910
are the kind that
don't cause problems,

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:33.960
don't ruffle feathers,
don't blame anybody,

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:38.150
don't accuse anybody, don't
have perpetrators-- just solves

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:40.760
a problem in a way that is a win
for the people you're helping

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:44.684
and frankly a win for
those who are helped.

00:07:44.684 --> 00:07:46.100
And what has
happened in our time,

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:50.120
I believe and I have found
through my reporting,

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:53.810
is that, on any number of the
most fundamental questions

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:58.430
of what ails us as a society,
there is a real change option

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:02.180
out there if we think
hard and study hard,

00:08:02.180 --> 00:08:04.130
but often that
real change option

00:08:04.130 --> 00:08:08.990
is expensive for the winners
of our age one way or another.

00:08:08.990 --> 00:08:14.330
And then, miraculously, a
fake change, light facsimile

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:17.660
of change materializes
that is very

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:20.150
inexpensive for the
winners, and often

00:08:20.150 --> 00:08:21.920
what happens in
our culture now--

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.860
in a culture overrun by
win-win thinking in my view--

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.720
is that we go for
the fake change.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.880
We go for the light
facsimile of change

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.059
because that kind
of change is free.

00:08:32.059 --> 00:08:34.419
So I'm going to give
you a couple examples.

00:08:34.419 --> 00:08:36.710
In theory, everybody in this
room and many, many people

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:39.140
in America would
agree that we need

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:42.110
to do a better job
of empowering women,

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:45.200
particularly empowering
women at work and in playing

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.630
their many roles in life.

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.360
Now, we know, if you look
at most countries that

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.512
have done this better
than we have, the reason

00:08:53.512 --> 00:08:55.970
they generally have done this
better than we have is social

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:57.479
policy.

00:08:57.479 --> 00:08:59.270
They actually have
maternity leave in a way

00:08:59.270 --> 00:09:02.540
that we do not as our law.

00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.020
They actually provide
a childcare tax credit

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:09.500
that makes it not
punitively expensive

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.047
to go to work after
having a child,

00:09:13.047 --> 00:09:14.630
and they do any
number of other things

00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:17.990
at the level of the
system and for everybody.

00:09:17.990 --> 00:09:20.650
Well, what's the problem
with all those ideas?

00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:22.340
Expensive.

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:25.040
That's real money.

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:28.116
We're talking about multibillion
dollar kind of money

00:09:28.116 --> 00:09:29.240
to fix a problem like that.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:32.640
It's not a mystery,
but it's expensive.

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.420
So what happens?

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.930
We get an idea like Lean In.

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:38.690
And again, Lean In seems great.

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:41.310
Good for your back
to move around.

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:43.140
What's the problem with Lean In?

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:48.309
It is telling women to bear
the burden of our failure

00:09:48.309 --> 00:09:50.850
to create the kind of policies
that would actually help them.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:53.490
It is telling women to
bear the burden of sexism.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:56.100
It is telling women
to bear the burden

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:01.230
of their lack of representation
in the halls of power,

00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:02.970
and this is what we often do.

00:10:02.970 --> 00:10:07.650
Faced with a real change that
we know would make a difference,

00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:10.180
we gravitate as a culture--
and not just rich people--

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:12.510
people who then follow
rich people's ideas,

00:10:12.510 --> 00:10:14.280
and that includes many of us.

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.490
We gravitate to the Lean
In school of change,

00:10:18.490 --> 00:10:21.030
which is cheaper and
easier on the winners,

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:24.130
and frankly, for many
women, unfortunately becomes

00:10:24.130 --> 00:10:25.120
fake change.

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.990
Let's take another
issue-- education.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:31.560
Across this country, right
and left, rural and urban,

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.080
many, many Americans
would agree we

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.620
have a problem with education.

00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.650
Many Americans I think would
agree that if you want to fix

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.570
many of the deeper
other problems we have--

00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:42.990
from climate change to our
political polarization,

00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:45.340
to our economy--

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:47.460
education would be
a great single lever

00:10:47.460 --> 00:10:50.020
to make a lot of difference on
a lot of those other issues--

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.690
a good bargain.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:56.410
Do that, get a bunch
of other fixes free.

00:10:56.410 --> 00:10:58.840
But when the winners of our
age, as they very often do--

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.670
this is one of their
most popular issues--

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.920
move into making
public schools better,

00:11:02.920 --> 00:11:05.890
what is their most
common approach?

00:11:05.890 --> 00:11:11.740
Charter schools, or other kinds
of programs that maybe help

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:14.260
match more effective teachers
with students in need,

00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:16.720
or things like that.

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:18.220
You know what the
winners of our age

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.430
don't do in general when
they approach the problem

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:24.557
of public education in America?

00:11:24.557 --> 00:11:26.140
They don't actually
raise the question

00:11:26.140 --> 00:11:28.420
of how we fund public
schools in America, which

00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:32.062
is a barbaric way of funding
public schools, which

00:11:32.062 --> 00:11:33.520
is funding public
schools according

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:35.950
to the value of essentially
the homes in your parents'

00:11:35.950 --> 00:11:37.344
neighborhood.

00:11:37.344 --> 00:11:39.760
Now, I don't know anybody in
this building or any building

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.510
who could actually sit, and look
at a six-year-old in the face,

00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:48.970
and explain why their education
should be indexed to the home

00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:52.150
values in their neighborhood.

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:55.060
I actually don't think there
are right wing people who,

00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:57.190
as a matter of deep
principle, believe

00:11:57.190 --> 00:12:03.219
that that is the optimal way to
organize an education system.

00:12:03.219 --> 00:12:05.260
And I think there are many
people on the left who

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:07.240
would find that
really objectionable,

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:09.184
but frankly, who do
nothing to challenge that,

00:12:09.184 --> 00:12:11.350
because in the neighborhoods
where the winners live,

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:14.870
in the neighborhoods where
perhaps many of us live,

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.240
we benefit from a system that
ring fences our own property

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.570
taxes for our own
schools, and that

00:12:22.570 --> 00:12:26.890
leaves schools in other parts
of this country high and dry.

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.600
And so when the winners
step into social change,

00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:33.177
they change change.

00:12:33.177 --> 00:12:34.510
They're not just joining change.

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.510
They change what change
is, how it's defined,

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:42.010
how it's talked about, how
it gets covered in the press.

00:12:42.010 --> 00:12:43.840
And those are just
two examples of how

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:46.864
that change in how
we think about change

00:12:46.864 --> 00:12:48.030
can actually be devastating.

00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:50.950
It can mean that on some of
the biggest issues of our time

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:53.890
we move from the
possibility of doing

00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:57.400
something transformational,
bringing millions of women

00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.680
into the workforce who find it
hard to play their many roles,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:05.770
to sort of telling them
to raise their hand more--

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:10.240
actually funding public schools
equally and for all, which

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:13.150
you could achieve in theory
with a single Supreme Court

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:16.000
ruling holding this
system that we currently

00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:21.410
have unconstitutional versus
what a lot of rich people do,

00:13:21.410 --> 00:13:25.389
which is setting up one charter
school in a poor neighborhood

00:13:25.389 --> 00:13:27.430
in their city, and going,
and being on the board,

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:29.470
and mentoring, and telling all
their friends at the country

00:13:29.470 --> 00:13:31.870
club that they helped those
three minority kids get

00:13:31.870 --> 00:13:34.920
into Yale, and it's so great.

00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.420
So great.

00:13:39.209 --> 00:13:41.000
And I'm happy to be
having this conference.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.210
I'm surprised to be having
this conversation at Google,

00:13:44.210 --> 00:13:46.830
and I'm happy to be having
this conversation at Google.

00:13:46.830 --> 00:13:52.430
And I applaud whoever it was
who invited me or did not

00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:58.284
read my book carefully
when they invited me,

00:13:58.284 --> 00:14:00.700
because I think this is ground
zero for this conversation.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.882
And it's ground zero for
the following reasons

00:14:02.882 --> 00:14:03.590
that are obvious.

00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:06.500
One, who represents
the winners of our age

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:08.630
more than this institution?

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:14.000
Who represents the
complexity of win-win change?

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.251
Because this is not like
a Koch brothers factory.

00:14:18.251 --> 00:14:20.000
This is a company that
I think we all know

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.950
does tremendous real
good in the world,

00:14:21.950 --> 00:14:25.021
that has made a lot of money
making a lot of people's lives

00:14:25.021 --> 00:14:25.520
better.

00:14:25.520 --> 00:14:27.530
The win-win is real,
and you guys know that

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:29.790
and live that every day.

00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:32.630
But this is also a
company that, because

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.230
of the very real fact of the
win-win, can perhaps in my view

00:14:36.230 --> 00:14:39.680
be blind to the ways and the
places in which that story

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.700
breaks down.

00:14:40.700 --> 00:14:42.830
When that ceases
to be true, you may

00:14:42.830 --> 00:14:45.710
be the last to know
precisely because

00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:47.870
of how deep the truth is.

00:14:50.025 --> 00:14:51.900
One of the people I
write about-- some of you

00:14:51.900 --> 00:14:53.790
may have known him or
worked with him-- is

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:56.868
a guy named Justin Rosenstein.

00:14:56.868 --> 00:14:58.690
He worked at Google
and Facebook,

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:02.670
invented some very important--

00:15:02.670 --> 00:15:04.170
I think he was part
of the team that

00:15:04.170 --> 00:15:07.330
invented Google Drive, but
some very important things

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.470
in this company.

00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:11.277
And he and I talked
about the win-win,

00:15:11.277 --> 00:15:13.860
and he said, you know, the thing
about tech that is so amazing

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.692
is that, in tech
particularly-- there's

00:15:15.692 --> 00:15:18.150
other industries where it's
true, but in tech particularly,

00:15:18.150 --> 00:15:21.120
there really are opportunities
where you can have your cake

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:21.990
and eat it, too.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:25.500
You can make something that
makes you a lot of money, that

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:29.400
makes a big company, that allows
you to have the darling of Wall

00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:32.340
Street, and you can truly
make the world better.

00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:36.506
And he said, actually, in our
interview, Google search--

00:15:36.506 --> 00:15:38.130
out of the many things
that you all do,

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:41.190
search is the greatest
example of this of all time.

00:15:41.190 --> 00:15:46.500
It's an incredibly lucrative
franchise that has immeasurably

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.530
made the world better
for all kinds of people,

00:15:49.530 --> 00:15:52.620
and I think you could argue has
particularly empowered people

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.680
with the least power.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.940
If you're a doctor at Mt.

00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.349
Sinai here in the US,
maybe Google search

00:15:59.349 --> 00:16:01.140
made a certain amount
of difference to you.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:04.880
If you're a doctor in a
very rural clinic in Uganda,

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.570
the marginal effect
of Google for you

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:10.650
is probably transformative.

00:16:10.650 --> 00:16:16.650
So that's very real, but as
I was speaking to Justin,

00:16:16.650 --> 00:16:20.232
I started to realize
where we diverge

00:16:20.232 --> 00:16:21.690
and where our
perspectives diverge.

00:16:21.690 --> 00:16:25.611
And I think all of you know
that the way in which America

00:16:25.611 --> 00:16:28.110
thinks about Silicon Valley and
thinks about these companies

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:30.240
has evolved over the
last year or two,

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.640
and you may be feeling that.

00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:37.260
And I started to realize
where Justin and I parted

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.157
from that initial sense that,
yeah, you can, in some cases,

00:16:40.157 --> 00:16:42.490
have your cake and eat it,
too-- make the world a better

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.760
and make a great company,
and make a lot of money.

00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:51.300
And where we diverged
was the world

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:56.610
he was calling for was a world
in which the concentration

00:16:56.610 --> 00:17:00.570
of wealth and power and
the emancipation of mankind

00:17:00.570 --> 00:17:06.930
could both keep growing
in tandem to infinity.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:11.040
If he is right that a
company like Google,

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.020
or Facebook, or others
is able to make money

00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:16.650
in ways that just
empower more people

00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:21.240
and do more public good the more
money is made, play that out.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.150
What does 50 more years
of that look like?

00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:25.349
What does 100 more
years of that look like?

00:17:25.349 --> 00:17:28.980
It a vision in which it
is possible to imagine

00:17:28.980 --> 00:17:31.789
there are only three companies
left in the United States,

00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:33.330
but everybody is so
empowered they're

00:17:33.330 --> 00:17:37.120
tired of being empowered.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:38.870
And I think even those
of you who are here

00:17:38.870 --> 00:17:42.950
know that there's probably some
kind of irreconcilable tension

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:46.520
in that vision that needs to be
thought through and worked out.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:56.762
And that's way I think you
will notice all around you--

00:17:56.762 --> 00:17:58.970
and I think we notice all
around us in this society--

00:17:58.970 --> 00:18:04.820
more and more of a desire to
challenge the win-win story,

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:07.490
to challenge you all who work
in Google, who work in tech,

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:11.870
who work among the winners
of our age to push yourselves

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:15.500
a little harder than to simply
say whatever we do happens

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.460
to be what's best for humanity,
to explore the uncomfortable

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:23.180
possibility that there are
places and situations--

00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:25.546
and there may be more
of them than you think--

00:18:25.546 --> 00:18:27.920
where what is good for you
and what is good for the world

00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:29.450
are different.

00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:33.140
And what will you do when
you come to those places?

00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.640
That is a very
important question.

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.950
And what will the society do
when we come to those places.

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:41.330
A lot of the
winners of our age--

00:18:43.582 --> 00:18:45.290
when they're thinking
about getting back,

00:18:45.290 --> 00:18:46.790
when they're thinking
about doing CSR,

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:48.831
when they're thinking
about any number of things,

00:18:48.831 --> 00:18:51.590
a lot of the winners of our age
ask the following question--

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:53.520
what can I do?

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:56.520
What can I start?

00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:58.856
What can I create?

00:18:58.856 --> 00:19:00.230
That's an
understandable question

00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.460
in the age of entrepreneurship.

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:07.410
What a lot of the winners
of our age refuse to ask is,

00:19:07.410 --> 00:19:09.440
what am I already doing?

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:12.410
How am I already involved
in these problems?

00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:17.300
How am I complicit in an
economy and a society that

00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:19.730
has been so unkind
to so many people,

00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:23.930
even as it builds and
created amazing things?

00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.680
How am I part of the central
drama of American life

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:32.390
today, which is more
future raining on America

00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:36.020
than we know what to do with,
but the very few harvesting

00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:38.870
almost all of that rain water?

00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:40.970
How am I involved in
that, and how could I

00:19:40.970 --> 00:19:42.500
be part of changing that?

00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:47.840
And not just what new
initiative could I create.

00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:51.320
So I want to raise with
you a couple of questions

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.150
that I'm sure you
think about a lot,

00:19:53.150 --> 00:19:57.470
I'm sure you explore
within, and I'm raising them

00:19:57.470 --> 00:19:59.720
as questions as an outsider.

00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:05.060
The obvious question that
comes up again and again

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:08.780
is the question of, should
Google be broken up?

00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.940
Is this company intrinsically
anti-competitive

00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:17.120
in just the scale that it's got?

00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:19.130
And that's a hard question.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:21.350
I mean, do we divide the
room this way, or would

00:20:21.350 --> 00:20:24.020
we divide the room this
way, or how would we do it?

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.520
It's an awkward
thing to talk about.

00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.519
Let's be honest, we're
all feeling awkward right

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:31.106
now because I'm talking about
breaking up Google at Google.

00:20:31.106 --> 00:20:33.860
Does this happen all the
time, or this never happens?

00:20:33.860 --> 00:20:35.025
Never happens.

00:20:35.025 --> 00:20:38.480
I told you they
didn't read my book.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:44.170
So I'll give you one example
of where this question comes up

00:20:44.170 --> 00:20:49.720
in an important way in my
industry, which is the media.

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.529
One place where
the story of what's

00:20:51.529 --> 00:20:53.320
good for us is good
for humanity, one place

00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:54.250
where that breaks down--

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.374
I think an important place.

00:20:55.374 --> 00:20:56.890
We'd all agree an
important place.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:20:59.530
So a recent piece in "The
Guardian" I'm quoting.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:02.410
"In the nine years since Google
bought the mobile ad company

00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:05.110
AdMob, annual ad revenue
of Google and Facebook

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:09.580
has soared to more than $95
billion and almost $40 billion

00:21:09.580 --> 00:21:10.540
respectively.

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:13.090
During this period, ad
revenue at newspapers

00:21:13.090 --> 00:21:19.072
fell around $50 billion in 2005
to under $20 billion today."

00:21:19.072 --> 00:21:19.780
And you all know.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.480
You read all the time the
stories that flow from that.

00:21:25.090 --> 00:21:27.490
Newspapers cutting-- they're
laying off half their staff

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:28.210
overnight.

00:21:28.210 --> 00:21:30.543
There's another one of those
kinds of stories every day.

00:21:30.543 --> 00:21:32.890
Newsrooms in America
lost 40% of their people

00:21:32.890 --> 00:21:36.760
over the last decade or two.

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:39.820
In my world and as a
journalist, the profession

00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:43.900
essentially feels like
something's been gutted.

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:45.910
And it's not "The
New York Times"

00:21:45.910 --> 00:21:49.480
and "The Post" that
actually have some resources

00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:50.980
and are going to do OK.

00:21:50.980 --> 00:21:54.580
It's every state legislature
in this country that basically

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.640
doesn't have a full time
correspondent anymore

00:21:57.640 --> 00:21:59.905
sitting there, reporting on
what happens in the state.

00:21:59.905 --> 00:22:01.780
I mean, there are many
states in this country

00:22:01.780 --> 00:22:05.380
that basically their
legislative process is now

00:22:05.380 --> 00:22:07.051
an unreported thing.

00:22:07.051 --> 00:22:08.800
You might as well have
the Chinese system,

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.240
because what is done by public
officials in that space is not

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:16.090
reported on in a way that's
presented back to people.

00:22:16.090 --> 00:22:19.450
Now, did Google go in and
cause that effect directly

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:19.990
and mean to?

00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:22.330
Probably not.

00:22:22.330 --> 00:22:25.150
But most of the
best thinking on how

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:27.910
it is that in a
very brief period

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:30.700
you went from $50 billion
in ad revenue in newspapers

00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:34.870
to $20 billion involves
the rise of the online ad

00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:39.710
business, which is what
powers what you guys do.

00:22:39.710 --> 00:22:42.310
But also-- and this is not
no one would have sour grapes

00:22:42.310 --> 00:22:44.650
if it was like, you did
better than everybody else--

00:22:44.650 --> 00:22:46.827
there's the question
of monopoly.

00:22:46.827 --> 00:22:47.410
Let's be real.

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.420
There's a real
question of, is there

00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:52.930
the abuse of a
monopolistic level of power

00:22:52.930 --> 00:22:54.820
over that online ad business?

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:57.010
I mean, does anybody
really use Yahoo.

00:22:57.010 --> 00:22:59.710
Let's be real here.

00:22:59.710 --> 00:23:05.110
That creates a condition in
which newspapers could not

00:23:05.110 --> 00:23:08.470
thrive even if they were
thinking, innovating,

00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:12.130
figuring it out, hacking
it, reinventing themselves.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:14.560
That's what monopoly
means, right?

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:18.720
And I am not an
anti-trust lawyer,

00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.160
and I can't litigate
that question here today,

00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:25.060
and I'm sure you're
relieved, but I think

00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.920
it's an important question.

00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.170
And certainly in the
EU you have people

00:23:29.170 --> 00:23:30.670
who have grappled
with that question

00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:32.230
and have charge big
fines to Google,

00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:34.630
and have found that there is
an anti-competitive issue,

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:37.000
and that it is suffocating
the parts of the economy

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.270
that we need full of air.

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:42.340
And the question is,
do you block that,

00:23:42.340 --> 00:23:46.900
or do you let the public do what
it needs to do on that score?

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:52.270
Do you obstruct that, or do
you say, OK, here's a place

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:56.330
where Justin Rosenstein's
theory cracks a little bit?

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:57.850
Here's a place
where there may be

00:23:57.850 --> 00:24:01.220
a divergence between what's good
for me and good for the world.

00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:03.860
And what will your
posture be then.

00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:08.362
If it is simply to
insist on the old story--

00:24:08.362 --> 00:24:09.820
more of what's good
for you is more

00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:11.344
of what's good for the world--

00:24:11.344 --> 00:24:13.510
we may live in a world in
which this country doesn't

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:15.880
have journalism anymore.

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:18.100
I will tell you as a
working journalist that

00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:22.060
is not an insane possibility.

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:24.280
That's not a remote possibility.

00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:27.610
It may not be
probable, but in an era

00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:31.720
when the business is collapsing
with the numbers I said to you,

00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.421
and the President of the United
States thinks news is fake

00:24:35.421 --> 00:24:37.170
and journalists are
enemies of the people,

00:24:37.170 --> 00:24:41.880
those are headwinds that
may not be recovered from.

00:24:47.510 --> 00:24:50.180
Moving on from the
monopoly issue,

00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:55.250
there's the question
of, when organizations

00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:58.640
like this give back and
help, what does that

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.220
buy you in terms of influence?

00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:04.220
When I say the
winners change change

00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:07.400
by getting into the
arena of change,

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:11.150
there's that whole controversy
that some of you may remember,

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.040
which made very
big waves and was

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.550
on the front page of
newspapers where you all

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:19.760
had made some very
well-meaning donations to New

00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:23.900
America, a think tank
which does exemplary work.

00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.625
And it does work on
actually thinking about,

00:25:26.625 --> 00:25:28.250
how do you bring this
country together,

00:25:28.250 --> 00:25:31.650
how do you have solutions
that are cross partisan,

00:25:31.650 --> 00:25:33.986
and any number of other--

00:25:33.986 --> 00:25:36.110
thinking a lot of things
about democracy right now.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.680
How do we protect and
defend democracy right now?

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:41.900
But when one of those--

00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:43.490
not just one person,
but one person

00:25:43.490 --> 00:25:47.210
plus a whole team of
thinkers with New America

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.377
sponsorship started to push
the question-- actually,

00:25:49.377 --> 00:25:51.001
I said I was moving
away from monopoly.

00:25:51.001 --> 00:25:52.040
It's sort of related--

00:25:52.040 --> 00:25:54.380
started to push the
question of what

00:25:54.380 --> 00:25:58.550
do we do about
Google's market power,

00:25:58.550 --> 00:26:01.340
Eric Schmidt made his
displeasure known.

00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:02.960
The guy was fired.

00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:07.829
New America spun off that
think tank to itself,

00:26:07.829 --> 00:26:10.370
and there was a whole discussion
at New America and elsewhere

00:26:10.370 --> 00:26:15.620
about how do we protect honest
research and scholarship

00:26:15.620 --> 00:26:19.880
from the winners of our
age who have all the money

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:26.990
now so they inevitably are
going to end up sponsoring

00:26:26.990 --> 00:26:28.587
research and thinking.

00:26:28.587 --> 00:26:30.920
There are fewer institutions
that have the kind of money

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:33.410
to sponsor that
thinking, and again, you

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:37.640
get into this cycle of that
very noble giving comes

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.712
with strings attached.

00:26:40.712 --> 00:26:42.420
And it's going to take
a lot of fortitude

00:26:42.420 --> 00:26:45.930
on your part, and a lot
of self protectiveness

00:26:45.930 --> 00:26:49.790
on the part of think
tanks and others

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:53.960
to take that help in ways that
don't compromise the help,

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.360
to take that help in ways
that allow researchers

00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.910
and thinkers to actually
push for real change

00:26:59.910 --> 00:27:05.970
and not be hobbled by the
source of their patronage.

00:27:11.376 --> 00:27:13.000
Moving on to a third
issue, how many of

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:19.960
you feel like you have a good
sense of what Google lobbies

00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.130
for in Washington?

00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:28.300
Who it meets, what
issues it lobbies on,

00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:31.690
what positions it takes on
those issues, who it gives money

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.120
to in terms of
campaign donations,

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:39.670
and how that is structured to
kind of deliver against those.

00:27:39.670 --> 00:27:43.440
Raise your hand if
you think you know.

00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.270
I mean, it's being
done in your name.

00:27:46.270 --> 00:27:48.257
It's being done on
behalf of your work.

00:27:48.257 --> 00:27:49.840
They're doing that
to make your work--

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:54.279
to protect it, to allow
you to do your work,

00:27:54.279 --> 00:27:55.570
but you don't really know that.

00:27:55.570 --> 00:27:59.410
And that's something
that I've heard a lot--

00:27:59.410 --> 00:28:06.860
that companies-- a lot of
where the rubber of an age

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:08.474
of an extreme equality
hits the road--

00:28:08.474 --> 00:28:10.640
a lot of where that happens
is actually in lobbying,

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.730
not in the companies themselves,
because the companies are doing

00:28:13.730 --> 00:28:19.130
what they're doing, but in
order for that work to be--

00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:21.140
individual people are
head down at their desk

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.880
doing their individual thing.

00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:27.620
It is somewhere else, often,
that a particular policy

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:31.340
is fought for,
external to you, that

00:28:31.340 --> 00:28:35.210
has to do with the interface of
the society and the company--

00:28:35.210 --> 00:28:39.202
that is actually the place
where, out of your view,

00:28:39.202 --> 00:28:40.910
a certain policy is
being fought for that

00:28:40.910 --> 00:28:43.250
would relax the
pressure on this,

00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:47.880
or that would allow
this or not allow this.

00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.670
And one of the things I found--

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.662
and I've been educated
by going on book tour

00:28:51.662 --> 00:28:53.870
and talking to people, and
talking to a lot of people

00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:57.470
privately about
their experiences--

00:28:57.470 --> 00:28:59.872
particularly in Silicon
Valley companies--

00:28:59.872 --> 00:29:01.580
and I'm obviously
using that term broadly

00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:02.621
because we're in Boston--

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:10.532
people are almost
totally kept in the dark

00:29:10.532 --> 00:29:12.990
about what's being done with
their work, and in their name,

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.264
and with the resources
they generate

00:29:15.264 --> 00:29:16.305
in the realm of politics.

00:29:18.940 --> 00:29:21.940
And the reason
that's important is

00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:29.300
I actually think that if
people in these companies

00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:30.510
insisted on the following--

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:32.343
I'm going to propose
this idea, and you guys

00:29:32.343 --> 00:29:33.974
see if you want to run with it.

00:29:33.974 --> 00:29:35.390
I think the employees
of a company

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.790
like this that is all
about transparency and open

00:29:37.790 --> 00:29:38.990
information--

00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:42.830
you should demand, as
employees, to know--

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.510
have an annual report, not
a financial annual report,

00:29:45.510 --> 00:29:48.980
but another annual report
that is an audited report that

00:29:48.980 --> 00:29:53.360
discloses to you, as
employees, the full lobbying

00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:57.320
and political persuasion
activities of your company.

00:29:57.320 --> 00:29:59.011
I think you should
know those things.

00:29:59.011 --> 00:30:01.260
We can argue about whether
I should know those things,

00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:04.670
but I think you are entitled
to know those things,

00:30:04.670 --> 00:30:09.312
and I think you should know if
your work is being used to spy

00:30:09.312 --> 00:30:10.520
on people in other countries.

00:30:10.520 --> 00:30:12.110
I think you have a
right to know that,

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:14.568
because I think you have the
right to decide whether or not

00:30:14.568 --> 00:30:17.150
you want to be part of that.

00:30:17.150 --> 00:30:21.470
I think you deserve to know
whether your work is being

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:25.730
advocated for in ways
that foster your belief,

00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:29.960
say, in competition, or in
journalism, in anything else,

00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.530
or whether your work
is being used in ways

00:30:33.530 --> 00:30:36.180
that undermine your own values.

00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:38.074
That's the whole point
of having values.

00:30:38.074 --> 00:30:40.490
You're allowed to do you, and
the company is allowed to do

00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:46.670
it, but often that cognitive
dissonance that I actually have

00:30:46.670 --> 00:30:50.134
found has a very
deep reality in many,

00:30:50.134 --> 00:30:51.800
many of these elite
spaces in our time--

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:56.870
my reporting tells me there's
a huge divergence between many

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:57.620
people--

00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.010
in these leading
institutions of our country,

00:31:00.010 --> 00:31:02.720
there's a huge divergence
between what many workers

00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.650
and executives feel and the
way their companies show up

00:31:06.650 --> 00:31:08.139
in the world.

00:31:08.139 --> 00:31:10.430
And part of what allows that
cognitive dissonance to go

00:31:10.430 --> 00:31:15.580
on is not knowing what
your company actually--

00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:17.570
how it fully shows
up in the world--

00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:18.980
not knowing.

00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:21.860
And I think that's something
that we could start

00:31:21.860 --> 00:31:26.270
right here at Google with some
of you insisting that you have

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:28.580
the right to know that,
and you have the right

00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:30.450
to know what is being
done with your work.

00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:39.030
I think one of the challenges
of some of these kinds of ideas

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:44.490
of looking within is
that, because there

00:31:44.490 --> 00:31:48.540
is some truth to the story
that you here at Google

00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:53.370
have at your fingertips
some genuine tools

00:31:53.370 --> 00:31:58.020
of human liberation-- because
there is truth in that story,

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.300
it is possible to also
believe that anything

00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:06.570
that slows you down from
executing on your mission

00:32:06.570 --> 00:32:08.090
is bad.

00:32:08.090 --> 00:32:10.470
Journalists asking
you questions, bad.

00:32:10.470 --> 00:32:12.990
Regulators pushing back, bad.

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:15.180
Courts that want to
slap fines on you,

00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:17.847
slowing you down from your
mission of emancipation.

00:32:17.847 --> 00:32:19.680
And so I think what's
going to be incredibly

00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:26.730
important in phase two
of the tech revolution

00:32:26.730 --> 00:32:29.580
if we think of this backlash
that you've been living

00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:30.872
with as a kind of pivot point--

00:32:30.872 --> 00:32:32.246
I think what's
going to be really

00:32:32.246 --> 00:32:34.192
important is to be able
to actually hold two

00:32:34.192 --> 00:32:35.400
different ideas in your head.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.500
Number one, that you
have at your fingertips

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.810
some genuine tools of
human liberation that,

00:32:39.810 --> 00:32:42.540
if deployed correctly, can
really make the world better.

00:32:42.540 --> 00:32:45.930
Number two, that there
are large and possibly

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.449
growing areas of
human societies where

00:32:49.449 --> 00:32:51.240
what is good for you
is different from what

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:52.260
is good for the world.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.160
And not just solving
those problems

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.320
or Columbus-ing your
way into those problems,

00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:02.480
but actually,
first and foremost,

00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:05.930
not being part of
the obstruction

00:33:05.930 --> 00:33:08.960
of the world as a world,
as a society, as a nation,

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.360
as a city, as an EU, whatever.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.950
Not being part of
the obstruction

00:33:12.950 --> 00:33:16.310
of the public solving
those problems as a public

00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:20.509
and understanding that a
deeper consequence of the kind

00:33:20.509 --> 00:33:22.050
of world you fought
to build, a world

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:25.010
that is transparent, and has
information, and knows truth--

00:33:25.010 --> 00:33:28.530
a consequence of that once
you get big and powerful

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.530
is that much of what that
world is going to want

00:33:30.530 --> 00:33:34.350
may not benefit you, and to
have the fortitude, as I say,

00:33:34.350 --> 00:33:40.520
to press on with humility in
the face of the public's desire

00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.770
to solve some of
its own problems

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:44.000
without your permission slip.

00:33:51.375 --> 00:33:52.750
When I was growing
up, I remember

00:33:52.750 --> 00:33:56.840
seeing on the news you'd see
news of some war torn country,

00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:03.670
and you'd often see rebels
in pickup trucks fighting--

00:34:03.670 --> 00:34:06.730
this kind of ragtag army
fighting an unjust king

00:34:06.730 --> 00:34:10.810
or fighting a president
that was corrupt.

00:34:10.810 --> 00:34:13.909
And sometimes the
rebel army would win,

00:34:13.909 --> 00:34:17.185
and the guy in the back
of the pickup truck

00:34:17.185 --> 00:34:18.310
would end up in the palace.

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:23.920
And I think that's
what happened to tech.

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:27.389
This was, in many ways,
an industry of renegades,

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:31.050
and hackers, and tinkerers,
and people doing weird things,

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:33.966
and I could imagine when
some of these technologies--

00:34:33.966 --> 00:34:35.340
and some of you
may be old enough

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.006
to remember-- some
of these technologies

00:34:37.006 --> 00:34:39.370
were getting off the ground.

00:34:39.370 --> 00:34:44.159
I can imagine that to
be up against General

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:49.080
Electric, or Walmart, or IBM
you must have felt like rebels

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:55.120
against an incredibly
powerful establishment,

00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.199
but here's the problem.

00:34:56.199 --> 00:35:00.250
When the rebel in the pickup
truck ends up in the palace,

00:35:00.250 --> 00:35:04.820
you know you're in trouble if
they keep wearing that beret.

00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:07.730
Think of Saddam, or
Mugabe, Idi Amin.

00:35:07.730 --> 00:35:09.320
The people who keep
the beret on-- you

00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:11.190
know what happens to them?

00:35:11.190 --> 00:35:16.280
They never actually
process their own arrival.

00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:19.089
They actually never
cross that threshold

00:35:19.089 --> 00:35:21.380
of understanding that I am
now the establishment that I

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:23.390
was once fighting against.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:24.320
I am now power.

00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:26.810
I'm not going up against power.

00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:27.910
I'm not the rebel.

00:35:27.910 --> 00:35:29.030
I am Goliath now.

00:35:32.310 --> 00:35:35.730
And there is a great danger
in being a Goliath who

00:35:35.730 --> 00:35:38.320
thinks they're a David.

00:35:38.320 --> 00:35:43.530
There is great danger in being
an establishment figure who

00:35:43.530 --> 00:35:46.030
thinks they're a rebel.

00:35:46.030 --> 00:35:48.990
There's great danger
in being a king who

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:51.960
thinks they're an insurgent.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:56.100
And the danger is a blindness
to those spaces where

00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.990
the story of what is good
for me and good for the world

00:35:58.990 --> 00:35:59.530
breaks down.

00:36:02.770 --> 00:36:05.800
I think what would be
really important to start

00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.760
thinking about in this realm
of tech, what would mark

00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:14.080
a new kind of maturity as a
response to this backlash,

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.230
as a response to the way in
which the society seems to be

00:36:17.230 --> 00:36:22.120
looking at you with new lenses
is actually relinquishing

00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:25.620
this fantasy of the win-win.

00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:28.440
It's a cherished fantasy.

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:33.660
All of you seem to have
positive associations with it,

00:36:33.660 --> 00:36:36.150
but I think maturity--

00:36:36.150 --> 00:36:38.250
now that you've
ascended to the palace,

00:36:38.250 --> 00:36:45.870
maturity means accepting that
it is your job to play offense,

00:36:45.870 --> 00:36:48.810
and it's the society's
job to play defence.

00:36:48.810 --> 00:36:52.350
It's the society's job to
protect a bunch of things

00:36:52.350 --> 00:36:55.860
that are properly its
to protect and that you

00:36:55.860 --> 00:36:58.260
can't be in charge of both.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:00.300
There's that saying
the best offense--

00:37:00.300 --> 00:37:02.490
the best defense-- the
best offense is the--

00:37:02.490 --> 00:37:03.720
I'm very bad at sports.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.740
The best offense is defense.

00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:10.920
And in a way, you tell
us something similar,

00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.700
that the best defense of
our values and institutions

00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:22.520
as a society is letting you
play offense unencumbered.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:24.350
But I think we have to
accept that our best

00:37:24.350 --> 00:37:28.670
defense as a society
is not your offense.

00:37:28.670 --> 00:37:31.020
Maybe that was true at
some moment in time,

00:37:31.020 --> 00:37:35.370
but I don't think it
can be true today.

00:37:35.370 --> 00:37:41.060
I think those of you in the
temples of this new power

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:44.940
need to learn do you
and let us do us.

00:37:47.650 --> 00:37:51.270
I think you have to learn to
be satisfied with creating,

00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:53.310
and innovating, and
profiting, and doing all

00:37:53.310 --> 00:37:57.450
those amazing things that you
do, and yes, by all means,

00:37:57.450 --> 00:38:03.420
do them with a view to making
the world better, but also

00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:08.340
stepping out of the way when
the society, unimpeded by you,

00:38:08.340 --> 00:38:11.640
seeks to tend to its
own welfare in ways that

00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:14.220
may be at your expense, that
may make it harder to build

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:16.500
a particular business,
that may mean more

00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:21.360
intrusion into your
affairs, that may mean

00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.470
less profitable quarters.

00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:31.850
I think, if we think about
what it means for this industry

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:36.080
and spaces like this to
truly accept their arrival,

00:38:36.080 --> 00:38:39.620
to accept showing
up in the palace

00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:45.040
and to take off that
beret, it means actually it

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:50.380
will require moving past
the win-win fantasy,

00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:56.230
accepting the world's
need to fight for itself

00:38:56.230 --> 00:39:00.250
in ways that may threaten you.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:02.350
And above all actually--

00:39:02.350 --> 00:39:04.840
because I truly believe this--

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.720
above all, listening more,
and giving more space

00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:10.090
to the voices of individuals
within this company

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:15.560
and many organizations like
it who I think privately--

00:39:15.560 --> 00:39:17.060
and they confess
to me all the time,

00:39:17.060 --> 00:39:18.970
and they did so for
my book, and now

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:21.190
that I'm out in the
world with the book

00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:24.370
I'm getting more and
more messages every day.

00:39:24.370 --> 00:39:26.890
There is a quiet
rebellion happening

00:39:26.890 --> 00:39:33.370
across many of the victorious
institutions of our age--

00:39:33.370 --> 00:39:36.600
tech, big philanthropy,
any number

00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:38.510
of big banks in Wall Street.

00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:40.620
And I get these messages
every day from people--

00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:44.580
young people often,
but not only--

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:48.090
saying I don't like
the way my institution

00:39:48.090 --> 00:39:50.830
shows up in the world.

00:39:50.830 --> 00:39:56.910
I like what I do, but I
can't defend what it does

00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:59.520
in some bigger aggregate way.

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:02.100
And the way things
are set up now

00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:04.255
people are sending
me that in private.

00:40:04.255 --> 00:40:05.880
I mean, you guys
probably know about it

00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:08.580
because you're at Google,
but in general, it's

00:40:08.580 --> 00:40:10.932
private to most people.

00:40:10.932 --> 00:40:12.390
And I think what
we've got to think

00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:16.035
about is how do we actually
let those people that--

00:40:16.035 --> 00:40:20.520
I'm convinced there's a minority
of people at least of rank

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:23.910
and file people within some of
the most powerful institutions

00:40:23.910 --> 00:40:27.390
in our age who know that they
are part of a system that they

00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:29.400
can't defend and who
want it to be different,

00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.410
but who are often
isolated from each other,

00:40:31.410 --> 00:40:33.330
and don't quite know
how to speak up,

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:35.430
and who sit there
calculating in a meeting

00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:37.350
the risk of their
speaking truth to power.

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:44.930
I think we need to think
about how can we create space

00:40:44.930 --> 00:40:48.380
for those people, because
those people are the people who

00:40:48.380 --> 00:40:53.210
are actually going to turn
these ships in directions that

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:58.250
are going to make fewer people
hate you and actually may help

00:40:58.250 --> 00:41:02.532
you get out of the way of the
society doing what you have

00:41:02.532 --> 00:41:04.490
long been committed to
doing, which is changing

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:06.560
the world for the better.

00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.801
Thank you very much.

00:41:08.801 --> 00:41:13.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.592
AUDIENCE: So there's
an idea, I think,

00:41:16.592 --> 00:41:18.800
that's at the root of a lot
of people not wanting to,

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:21.560
for example, increase
the top marginal tax

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:24.710
rate to fund early childhood
education, that kind of thing--

00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:26.387
is this idea-- and
I think it's wrong--

00:41:26.387 --> 00:41:28.220
that the government
can't do anything right.

00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.562
And I think it's because the
government is doing things

00:41:30.562 --> 00:41:32.270
right all the time,
and it's transparent,

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:35.600
and we don't notice it
unless it's not there.

00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:38.300
Why or why isn't
changing people's minds

00:41:38.300 --> 00:41:42.500
about that particular
thing sort of part

00:41:42.500 --> 00:41:44.300
of the solution
where people might

00:41:44.300 --> 00:41:47.600
stop hoarding their money, and
then spending it privately,

00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.351
and support higher tax
rates, for example?

00:41:49.351 --> 00:41:51.808
ANAND GIRIDHARADAS: I think
that's a such a great question,

00:41:51.808 --> 00:41:53.030
and you're absolutely right.

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:55.250
The way that I tell
the story in the book

00:41:55.250 --> 00:42:02.360
is there has been a 30 or
40 year all out war mainly

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:05.660
from the political right in this
country against the very idea

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.540
of the government, against
the idea of virtually

00:42:08.540 --> 00:42:10.640
having a government.

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:11.760
Government is the problem.

00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:12.530
Government is the enemy.

00:42:12.530 --> 00:42:13.779
The government is taking this.

00:42:13.779 --> 00:42:15.200
The government is doing that.

00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:17.570
Now, I think most people
here probably don't subscribe

00:42:17.570 --> 00:42:18.820
to that version of the theory.

00:42:21.580 --> 00:42:25.270
That has been a very
successful revolution.

00:42:25.270 --> 00:42:28.840
Government has
truly scaled back.

00:42:28.840 --> 00:42:31.090
There's a reason that that
private philanthropy giving

00:42:31.090 --> 00:42:37.450
is starting to approach the
level of federal nonmilitary

00:42:37.450 --> 00:42:40.390
spending--
discretionary spending.

00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:43.240
But one of the things
that I explore in the book

00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:45.250
is that that
revolution prosecuted

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:47.440
by the political right
didn't end there,

00:42:47.440 --> 00:42:50.740
because often what happens when
a revolution like that succeeds

00:42:50.740 --> 00:42:53.350
is that it kind of changes the
cultural atmosphere in which

00:42:53.350 --> 00:42:54.710
everybody operates.

00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:57.340
And even those on
the other side of it

00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:01.960
end up playing on its
field, if you see it I mean.

00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.355
You may be an
opponent of that idea,

00:43:05.355 --> 00:43:06.730
but you're not
playing that game.

00:43:06.730 --> 00:43:08.410
You're forced to play that game.

00:43:08.410 --> 00:43:12.520
So it is not an accident
that, after Reagan said

00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:15.310
government is the
problem, some years

00:43:15.310 --> 00:43:17.650
later, Bill Clinton
from the other party--

00:43:17.650 --> 00:43:20.750
very different world view,
much more favorable view

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:23.380
of government-- nonetheless
said the era of big government

00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:25.480
is over.

00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:29.140
That's what it means
to be an opponent who's

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:32.800
still fundamentally playing
on someone else's field.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:37.717
And I fully, fully, fully agree
with you that one of the most

00:43:37.717 --> 00:43:40.300
essential things we need to do--
and I end the book by talking

00:43:40.300 --> 00:43:42.280
about this on a hopeful note--

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:45.640
is we need to redeem the idea
of government in people's eyes.

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.964
Is the government bloated, and
inefficient, and underfunded,

00:43:48.964 --> 00:43:50.380
and not good at a
bunch of things?

00:43:50.380 --> 00:43:55.030
Yeah, but as you say, the
government is also a miracle.

00:43:55.030 --> 00:43:56.280
All the things that go right--

00:43:56.280 --> 00:43:58.030
I mean, have you been
to other countries

00:43:58.030 --> 00:44:01.840
where you need to
do a lot of homework

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.145
before you eat out in public?

00:44:05.079 --> 00:44:07.495
When was the last time you got
sick eating in a restaurant

00:44:07.495 --> 00:44:08.455
in America.

00:44:08.455 --> 00:44:11.080
When was the last time you
put your kid in a car seat

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:13.750
and wondered if it had
been properly tested?

00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:17.740
When was the last time
you stayed in a hotel room

00:44:17.740 --> 00:44:21.280
and wondered if it was safe
or it had been cleaned?

00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:26.710
I mean, you think
about all the greed

00:44:26.710 --> 00:44:29.650
in this society-- even
Wall Street, for all that

00:44:29.650 --> 00:44:33.310
it does wrong, it is so
carefully regulated and hyper

00:44:33.310 --> 00:44:36.287
regulated, and you can't
just do crazy stuff,

00:44:36.287 --> 00:44:37.870
except every now and
then when you can

00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:40.520
and tank the world economy.

00:44:40.520 --> 00:44:42.950
But we forget how
much works right

00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:47.200
because we have not
some big overbearing

00:44:47.200 --> 00:44:49.390
evil step-dad of a
government, but because we

00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:53.290
have a government that actually
in all these million unsung

00:44:53.290 --> 00:44:55.072
ways tends to common welfare.

00:44:55.072 --> 00:44:55.780
And I would say--

00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.238
I'm not saying
Google specifically,

00:44:57.238 --> 00:44:59.980
but Silicon Valley
institutions and the complex

00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:04.730
of thinking around tech
have been part, I think,

00:45:04.730 --> 00:45:08.710
of discrediting government,
of framing government

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:15.400
as this old kind of 1.0 thing
that can't really fix things

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:20.170
anymore, and crediting the
kind of innovative sphere

00:45:20.170 --> 00:45:22.630
as being the place where
real change happens.

00:45:22.630 --> 00:45:25.031
And I think that's very
unfortunate, not least

00:45:25.031 --> 00:45:26.530
because the entire
internet was made

00:45:26.530 --> 00:45:30.790
by the government in its
origin, but also because there's

00:45:30.790 --> 00:45:33.070
a real reason that
Silicon Valley didn't

00:45:33.070 --> 00:45:35.860
arise in another country.

00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:37.750
A lot of the common
institutions we

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:41.770
share in this country-- the
courts, the boring stuff

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:44.900
that you don't even realize
allows you to do what you do

00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:46.590
are public things,
are common things,

00:45:46.590 --> 00:45:47.770
are things we share
in common, and we

00:45:47.770 --> 00:45:49.420
need to give those
things more credit.

00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:52.240
Otherwise we're going to head
into a society that is actually

00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:54.370
like many very poor
countries where there's

00:45:54.370 --> 00:45:56.290
a lot of rich people and
some great companies,

00:45:56.290 --> 00:45:59.560
and most people are just
not part of the economy,

00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.725
are not part of
building a better world,

00:46:01.725 --> 00:46:03.433
and I don't think
that's actually a world

00:46:03.433 --> 00:46:05.010
that anybody wants to live in.

00:46:05.010 --> 00:46:06.010
AUDIENCE: So in your
discussion today,

00:46:06.010 --> 00:46:07.884
you've talked about some
of the problems that

00:46:07.884 --> 00:46:10.110
can result from good
faith actors who

00:46:10.110 --> 00:46:13.241
maybe go about things in a way
that's not helpful to society.

00:46:13.241 --> 00:46:14.740
How much of the
problem do you think

00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:16.370
comes from bad faith actors?

00:46:16.370 --> 00:46:19.600
Or how much do they end
up co-opting or corrupting

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:21.010
good faith efforts?

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:23.000
ANAND GIRIDHARADAS:
That's a great question.

00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:27.460
I mean, I focused
this book on people

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:31.734
who I think are genuine in
trying to make a difference

00:46:31.734 --> 00:46:33.400
and who end up upholding
the system that

00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:36.452
causes the problems, but
you're exactly right.

00:46:36.452 --> 00:46:38.160
And I think that has
more to do with what

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:40.080
I saying a moment ago.

00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:43.600
When I think about
the Koch brothers,

00:46:43.600 --> 00:46:46.120
they're not part of my story.

00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:50.290
When I think about Fox News,
that's not part of my story.

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:54.340
I don't think that those
are people chiefly motivated

00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:56.212
by making the world
a better place.

00:46:56.212 --> 00:46:57.670
I think those are
people who wanted

00:46:57.670 --> 00:47:00.370
to grab wealth and
power, and understood

00:47:00.370 --> 00:47:04.660
that a certain kind of influence
campaign and changing people's

00:47:04.660 --> 00:47:08.890
norms and values, and
kind of tricking--

00:47:08.890 --> 00:47:11.680
astroturfing issues
so that regular people

00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.060
supported things that actually
only benefit billionaires--

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:20.170
that that was a cynical effort
to achieve their own business

00:47:20.170 --> 00:47:23.050
interest at the
expense of the society.

00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:25.000
And there's a very
good book on that

00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:27.770
called "Dark Money" by Jane
Mayer about how that was done.

00:47:27.770 --> 00:47:29.020
That's not my story.

00:47:29.020 --> 00:47:34.630
My story is the story of how
is it that Mark Zuckerberg can

00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:40.610
be one of the most powerful
idealists in American history,

00:47:40.610 --> 00:47:43.090
but also the first person
in American history

00:47:43.090 --> 00:47:49.030
to potentially allow an
election to be compromised.

00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:50.980
And are those things
just a coincidence,

00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:55.550
or is his idealism
part of why he

00:47:55.550 --> 00:47:59.620
was able to get enough power
to have the election be

00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:04.156
compromised, and part of why,
when reporter friends of mine

00:48:04.156 --> 00:48:05.780
have tried to
investigate what happened

00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:07.070
and what happened with
Cambridge Analytica,

00:48:07.070 --> 00:48:09.470
they get so much pushback
from him and his company

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:11.290
that they can
barely do their job?

00:48:11.290 --> 00:48:14.750
Is his idealism and his
sense of himself as a savior

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:18.860
part of what actually
allows that problem

00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:20.730
to happen the way it did?

00:48:20.730 --> 00:48:22.530
AUDIENCE: So you
asked the question,

00:48:22.530 --> 00:48:24.740
what are we already doing?

00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:27.050
And one answer
that comes to mind

00:48:27.050 --> 00:48:29.840
that I see at
Google and elsewhere

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.120
is the issue of subcontracting.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.490
There' was a great "New
York Times" article recently

00:48:34.490 --> 00:48:38.165
comparing a janitor at Kodak I
think in the '70s and a janitor

00:48:38.165 --> 00:48:41.900
at Apple today, and back in
the day, the janitor at Kodak

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:44.930
received the same vacation
and health benefits

00:48:44.930 --> 00:48:46.520
as every other Kodak employee.

00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:51.410
And now the janitor at Apple is
an employee of some contracting

00:48:51.410 --> 00:48:53.450
company, and they're
not receiving

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:57.110
any of the same benefits,
and my understanding is

00:48:57.110 --> 00:49:00.890
the situation is similar here.

00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:04.580
And we see these
workers every day.

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:08.377
Can you comment at all on
that particular situation?

00:49:08.377 --> 00:49:10.210
ANAND GIRIDHARADAS:
That's a great question.

00:49:10.210 --> 00:49:11.960
There's another story
even more recently.

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:13.830
The Kodak one was amazing.

00:49:13.830 --> 00:49:18.170
There's another story a couple
of days ago about Harvard,

00:49:18.170 --> 00:49:22.640
and the students at Harvard
on the exact same issue

00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.730
you named revolted
against the administration

00:49:25.730 --> 00:49:27.650
and basically
forced them to stop

00:49:27.650 --> 00:49:31.820
doing this thing of
subcontracting it out to--

00:49:31.820 --> 00:49:35.130
essentially it's like the labor
version of shell companies

00:49:35.130 --> 00:49:37.309
so that you can say
I had no idea they

00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:38.600
didn't provide maternity leave.

00:49:38.600 --> 00:49:39.160
I'm shocked.

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.420
Shocked.

00:49:41.420 --> 00:49:43.630
And Harvard students
found out about that

00:49:43.630 --> 00:49:46.430
and pushed Larry Summers, who
was the president of Harvard

00:49:46.430 --> 00:49:51.620
at the time, and
Harvard fixed it.

00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:57.170
And the story was focused
on this woman who works--

00:49:57.170 --> 00:49:59.890
I forget what part of the
university she works in--

00:49:59.890 --> 00:50:02.000
but she and her
husband between them

00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.200
make a low six figure income
both doing working class jobs.

00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:10.524
It's exactly like what it used
to be at Kodak in the past,

00:50:10.524 --> 00:50:11.690
and they make a good living.

00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:12.530
They have a home.

00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:15.080
They are living in
dignity and decency,

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:21.170
and it was because students
said don't clean up after us,

00:50:21.170 --> 00:50:24.520
or don't serve us food in a way
that's degrading other people.

00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:27.020
And so look, one of the things
that people have talked about

00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:30.050
is, relative to most
employees in America,

00:50:30.050 --> 00:50:32.120
you have a lot of power.

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:34.184
You really do.

00:50:34.184 --> 00:50:36.350
The China thing, the Microsoft
thing that happened--

00:50:36.350 --> 00:50:38.140
these are all stories--

00:50:38.140 --> 00:50:40.280
particularly the people
with that kind of coding

00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:43.040
and engineering background
have an enormous amount

00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:46.190
of power in these companies,
but you all have a lot of power.

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:47.750
You're very talented
people, and each

00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:49.795
of you in general with
a couple exceptions--

00:50:49.795 --> 00:50:51.920
there's always a couple
exceptions, but each of you

00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:56.200
generally would be a huge
loss for your company.

00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:00.269
They don't want your talent next
door fighting for someone else.

00:51:00.269 --> 00:51:02.060
And then I think you've
got to think about,

00:51:02.060 --> 00:51:03.750
who do you use that?

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:05.810
If there were people
at this company who

00:51:05.810 --> 00:51:09.950
wanted to work on
that issue, I 100%

00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:12.950
guarantee you you could get
that issue done in a month,

00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:16.520
and that would
have a huge effect.

00:51:16.520 --> 00:51:19.880
How many offices does Google
have around the world?

00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.180
AUDIENCE: A lot.

00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:24.200
ANAND GIRIDHARADAS: That
would have a huge, real effect

00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:27.350
this month on a lot of people's
lives, on people's kids,

00:51:27.350 --> 00:51:30.450
and whether their kids
can go to school or not--

00:51:30.450 --> 00:51:31.670
real.

00:51:31.670 --> 00:51:35.060
That's an example of using
that power in a way that

00:51:35.060 --> 00:51:40.010
feels right, but that involves
a painful conversation

00:51:40.010 --> 00:51:42.620
about that's going
to cost real money.

00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:45.920
That's going to come at
the expense of something,

00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.800
and those are exactly
the kind of conversations

00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:51.050
I would encourage you to have.

00:51:51.050 --> 00:51:53.650
And I think one of the myths--

00:51:53.650 --> 00:51:56.496
one of the people that read the
book recently and explore kind

00:51:56.496 --> 00:51:58.370
of what it meant for
her-- she said this very

00:51:58.370 --> 00:52:02.390
profound thing,
which is this book

00:52:02.390 --> 00:52:08.270
has made me resist my urge
to overestimate the risks

00:52:08.270 --> 00:52:10.590
of speaking truth to power.

00:52:10.590 --> 00:52:12.680
I think we all tend to
overestimate the risk

00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:14.162
of speaking truth to power.

00:52:14.162 --> 00:52:16.370
I actually think if you
raised the issue you raised--

00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:20.690
I don't think anything
would happen to you,

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:22.956
and we could all do
more on those fronts.

00:52:22.956 --> 00:52:24.830
So thank you for your
question, and good luck

00:52:24.830 --> 00:52:25.790
with your campaign.

00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:27.087
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:52:27.087 --> 00:52:29.045
AUDIENCE: Looking forward
to reading your book,

00:52:29.045 --> 00:52:32.540
and thank you for,
in your words,

00:52:32.540 --> 00:52:35.570
coming and speaking in
the belly of the beast.

00:52:35.570 --> 00:52:40.520
My question is regarding
global movement of capital.

00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:43.550
I mean, capital moves
with complete impunity,

00:52:43.550 --> 00:52:46.390
and the issues that
you spoke about--

00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:51.120
health care, education-- all
of these are national issues.

00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:53.460
How, without any
democratic control

00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:59.260
over movement of capital
versus, say, movement of labor--

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:01.620
how are we going to make
any real effective changes

00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:02.790
and what--

00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:04.630
of course, this is a
very general question,

00:53:04.630 --> 00:53:09.210
but what do you think
we, as Google employees,

00:53:09.210 --> 00:53:10.987
can even say or do
about some of these?

00:53:10.987 --> 00:53:12.820
ANAND GIRIDHARADAS:
That's a great question.

00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:16.835
I mean, so when I think about,
if you're persuaded by me,

00:53:16.835 --> 00:53:18.960
that we need to do less of
the fake change and more

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:19.477
real change.

00:53:19.477 --> 00:53:21.810
You start thinking about, OK,
what are the three or four

00:53:21.810 --> 00:53:26.060
really big areas of
American life where

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:28.560
a little tinkering is
not going to solve it,

00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:32.730
where are we need some
transformational reform?

00:53:32.730 --> 00:53:33.760
I would say a couple.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:35.700
One is health.

00:53:35.700 --> 00:53:38.310
Regardless of what your
view is on the right system,

00:53:38.310 --> 00:53:39.830
I think we can all
agree we're not

00:53:39.830 --> 00:53:42.660
a particularly healthy country.

00:53:42.660 --> 00:53:43.452
It's very cruel.

00:53:43.452 --> 00:53:45.660
People are dying of things
they don't need to die of.

00:53:45.660 --> 00:53:46.980
Life expectancy is going down.

00:53:46.980 --> 00:53:48.854
It's not supposed to
move in that direction--

00:53:48.854 --> 00:53:49.992
health.

00:53:49.992 --> 00:53:51.450
I think we'd all
agree on education

00:53:51.450 --> 00:53:54.580
as another major area, major
transformational change

00:53:54.580 --> 00:53:57.300
required simply to keep up
with where the world is.

00:53:57.300 --> 00:54:00.390
I think a third area is
labor and thinking about work

00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:03.270
and the kind of
question that was raised

00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:05.630
by that woman,
but also questions

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:08.550
around what does it
mean to protect an Uber

00:54:08.550 --> 00:54:11.750
driver from the vicissitudes
of the gig economy?

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:15.000
And the solutions
we have don't really

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.792
fit the realities we've created,
but the fourth area that I

00:54:17.792 --> 00:54:19.500
think is a big one is
the one you raised,

00:54:19.500 --> 00:54:26.460
which is, in a world where
money is not necessarily

00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:28.850
a physical thing in your
wallet, not just a thing

00:54:28.850 --> 00:54:30.960
in an account anymore
either, but can be--

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.293
I mean, I don't understand
what all of these things are,

00:54:33.293 --> 00:54:35.490
but you probably
do, but is virtual,

00:54:35.490 --> 00:54:38.050
and can bounce around untraced,
and can be anonymized,

00:54:38.050 --> 00:54:40.410
and can be moved
through shell companies,

00:54:40.410 --> 00:54:43.500
and transferred, and
turned into things faster

00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:49.107
than any government may ever
be able to make sense of.

00:54:49.107 --> 00:54:50.440
What does it mean to tax people?

00:54:53.850 --> 00:54:55.710
Let's just face reality.

00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:58.980
Many of the largest
American corporations

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:02.790
do not pay corporate income
tax in any given year.

00:55:02.790 --> 00:55:05.880
I'm talking about big,
big, big, big companies--

00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:09.630
companies that make an
enormous amount of money.

00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:11.650
There's the double Dutch
with an Irish sandwich.

00:55:11.650 --> 00:55:13.066
I don't know if
you've eaten that,

00:55:13.066 --> 00:55:15.807
but that's a tax
maneuver that saves--

00:55:15.807 --> 00:55:18.140
a lot of companies pretend
to be a lot bigger in Ireland

00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:18.990
than they actually are.

00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:19.906
Let's put it that way.

00:55:22.590 --> 00:55:26.080
You've got all these tax havens
that kind of rich individuals

00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:28.110
use-- and others.

00:55:28.110 --> 00:55:29.850
And I think we just
have to face I don't

00:55:29.850 --> 00:55:32.490
know what the answer
is, but in a world

00:55:32.490 --> 00:55:34.107
in which it is as
easy as it is--

00:55:34.107 --> 00:55:35.940
and by the way, all of
that that I described

00:55:35.940 --> 00:55:37.620
is without any of
this crypto stuff

00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:39.450
having really affected it.

00:55:39.450 --> 00:55:41.670
We haven't even seen--

00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:44.950
when GE adopts crypto.

00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:46.170
It's going to be a slow--

00:55:46.170 --> 00:55:49.110
and then that becomes part of
how we have figure out taxing,

00:55:49.110 --> 00:55:51.520
it's going to be a nightmare.

00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:53.230
And we're very-- if
we're not careful,

00:55:53.230 --> 00:55:57.600
we are heading into a world in
which the most important pots

00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:03.360
of money to tax to fund
a basic common existence

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:06.275
are going to be invisible
to the taxation authorities.

00:56:06.275 --> 00:56:07.650
And so what can
you at Google do?

00:56:07.650 --> 00:56:11.040
I mean, the technology
and know how you have--

00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.290
you're probably one of the
few people who can actually

00:56:13.290 --> 00:56:15.460
think about solving that issue.

00:56:15.460 --> 00:56:19.330
From the beginning of this money
revolution that's happening,

00:56:19.330 --> 00:56:26.190
how do we embed in
those inventions

00:56:26.190 --> 00:56:30.475
the ability to tax people?

00:56:30.475 --> 00:56:35.307
That's antithetical to why a
lot of these people do crypto,

00:56:35.307 --> 00:56:37.390
but one of the things we
learned with the internet

00:56:37.390 --> 00:56:42.210
that you know very well is early
design choices matter a lot.

00:56:42.210 --> 00:56:46.230
The internet was designed
to protect anonymity,

00:56:46.230 --> 00:56:48.890
and that's very hard
to work around that.

00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:53.400
Well, the internet ended up
being this incredibly abusive,

00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:58.500
racist space, and if
persistent identity

00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:01.920
had been more of a part of the
early design of the internet,

00:57:01.920 --> 00:57:04.009
maybe the internet would
be in a different way.

00:57:04.009 --> 00:57:05.550
Maybe people would
behave online more

00:57:05.550 --> 00:57:08.370
than the way they do at cocktail
parties, which is occasionally

00:57:08.370 --> 00:57:11.490
mean, but not calling
people by racist names

00:57:11.490 --> 00:57:15.100
every time they say something
that slightly offends them.

00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:16.600
These kind of design
choices matter,

00:57:16.600 --> 00:57:18.141
so I think it's
worth thinking about,

00:57:18.141 --> 00:57:21.890
how do you design money, this
new money in a way that is not

00:57:21.890 --> 00:57:23.640
going to lead to a
world in which there is

00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:26.140
no money for the common good?

00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:28.440
AUDIENCE: So I'm really
glad you came here also.

00:57:28.440 --> 00:57:30.856
I came because I heard your
interview on Ezra Klein, which

00:57:30.856 --> 00:57:32.050
I thought was great.

00:57:32.050 --> 00:57:33.300
ANAND GIRIDHARADAS:
He's one of the greatest

00:57:33.300 --> 00:57:34.369
interviewers on earth.

00:57:34.369 --> 00:57:35.410
AUDIENCE: He's very good.

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:42.990
I was struck by how much you
seemed to get all of it right.

00:57:42.990 --> 00:57:44.797
I don't have a lot of--

00:57:44.797 --> 00:57:47.130
I don't see a lot of what
having big plans [INAUDIBLE],,

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:48.380
but it all makes sense.

00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:49.879
You have a whole
bunch of people who

00:57:49.879 --> 00:57:51.120
there's concentrated wealth.

00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:52.170
They're going to give money.

00:57:52.170 --> 00:57:54.003
Those people are going
to be unintentionally

00:57:54.003 --> 00:57:56.010
or intentionally influenced.

00:57:56.010 --> 00:57:58.620
Everything you say
makes a ton of sense.

00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:02.610
And to your question,
I've actually

00:58:02.610 --> 00:58:04.620
brought stuff to an SVP--

00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:08.320
so I was one of like
5,000 of his reports,

00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.209
and pushed him directly,
and got no retribution.

00:58:11.209 --> 00:58:13.500
ANAND GIRIDHARADAS: On that
issue or a different issue?

00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:15.041
AUDIENCE: Completely
different issue,

00:58:15.041 --> 00:58:18.825
but I don't mind
getting yelled at.

00:58:18.825 --> 00:58:20.700
ANAND GIRIDHARADAS:
That's an important asset

00:58:20.700 --> 00:58:22.800
in making change.

00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:25.200
AUDIENCE: I got
surprisingly little pushback

00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.670
as it went up the chain--

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:33.379
only just crisp up your
message, but go for it.

00:58:33.379 --> 00:58:34.920
The only thing I
want to push back on

00:58:34.920 --> 00:58:39.480
is it's not always easy
to tell when you're

00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:40.860
being the Goliath or not.

00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:43.480
So Google started off
as a very small company.

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:43.980
We grew.

00:58:43.980 --> 00:58:47.130
We put a lot of businesses
out of business.

00:58:47.130 --> 00:58:48.720
Was that bad?

00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:52.550
Which of those businesses that
we put out of business was bad?

00:58:52.550 --> 00:58:55.170
There's some, I think, fairly
relatively clear cut cases,

00:58:55.170 --> 00:58:57.625
but with a lot of
cases companies

00:58:57.625 --> 00:59:00.000
grow, and then they get old,
and they become inefficient,

00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.625
and they eventually
go out of business.

00:59:01.625 --> 00:59:06.220
Google will not be in business
probably 300 years from now.

00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:08.270
That's OK.

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:09.970
What are your
guidelines for that?

00:59:09.970 --> 00:59:12.511
ANAND GIRIDHARADAS: I think the
simple answer for that that's

00:59:12.511 --> 00:59:14.520
actually embedded in the law--

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:17.130
it is not bad to put another
company out of business

00:59:17.130 --> 00:59:20.090
when you do so out of an
abundance of competition.

00:59:20.090 --> 00:59:21.684
It is bad to put
another company out

00:59:21.684 --> 00:59:23.100
of business when
you do so because

00:59:23.100 --> 00:59:24.722
of a lack of competition.

00:59:24.722 --> 00:59:26.180
So when you guys
were starting out,

00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:30.720
and you were smarter and
nimbler than competitors,

00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:32.530
and there were a
bunch of competitors,

00:59:32.530 --> 00:59:35.370
and people wanted to come
to you instead of them,

00:59:35.370 --> 00:59:37.470
I don't think anybody
cries for that,

00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:41.280
except the people who are being
disrupted, as you guys say.

00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:43.230
But I think when
you get to a state

00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:45.390
where there's many
people wanting

00:59:45.390 --> 00:59:49.440
to advertise basically only one
company left to do their ad buy

00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:55.080
on, and you then see "The New
York Times," or "The Washington

00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:58.380
Post," or actually, more to
the point, smaller newspapers

00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:01.830
struggling to exist--

01:00:01.830 --> 01:00:08.130
at that point, I don't think
that business is struggling

01:00:08.130 --> 01:00:12.420
because only of competition.

01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:15.810
I think if there were eight
Googles vying for the online ad

01:00:15.810 --> 01:00:19.650
business the price
dynamics in the market

01:00:19.650 --> 01:00:23.710
might be different enough that
that newspaper could compete.

01:00:23.710 --> 01:00:25.371
So I think you have
to ask yourself,

01:00:25.371 --> 01:00:27.120
when is there an
abundance of competition,

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:31.170
and when have we become
the thing that results

01:00:31.170 --> 01:00:32.640
in a lack of competition?

01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:33.360
[APPLAUSE]

01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.180
Thank you.

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:38.540
Thank you for embracing
the awkwardness.
