00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:05.400
Hi, I am Kagure Kabue. I am from Kenya originally, but I live in San Francisco

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.732
now. And I lived in an area that had a high prevalence for sickle cell anaemia.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.330
&gt;&gt; In Kenya, is Sickle cell anaemia a common trait?

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.970
&gt;&gt; I don't know how common it is, but I

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:19.690
do know of people who've had it, or who have it.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.930
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and what are the symptoms of sickle cell anaemia, or what

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.730
was it like for these people that you know of who, who've had it?

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:27.380
&gt;&gt; It was something that I didn't

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.330
know was happening until they told me themselves.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.613
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:30.613 --> 00:00:33.160
&gt;&gt; with one person, I always thought to myself that she looked a

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.340
little sickly sometimes. But, I just thought that maybe she had a cold.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:37.130
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:40.680
&gt;&gt; But, it turns out that she had, or has sickle cell anaemia.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.030
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, is it is it a big

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.239
deal? I mean, does it seriously affect their lives?

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.090
&gt;&gt; I'm not sure. I'm not sure it does. I would imagine

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.600
it does, but she's very private with it and so I don't know

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.878
how much it affected her. All in all, she seemed to function normally. or,

00:00:58.878 --> 00:01:02.854
you know, she would show up to class and go through everything that

00:01:02.854 --> 00:01:06.870
we would go through. And then, I'd think to myself, oh she's sick again?

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:09.327
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm, is any one known in your family,

00:01:09.327 --> 00:01:12.440
though who has ever been affected by sickle cell anaemia?

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.579
&gt;&gt; No.

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:12.852
&gt;&gt; That you know.

00:01:12.852 --> 00:01:14.083
&gt;&gt; No, not in my family.

00:01:14.083 --> 00:01:16.348
&gt;&gt; Do you know if you're a carrier for sickle cell anaemia?

00:01:16.348 --> 00:01:18.398
&gt;&gt; I do know that and I'm not.

00:01:18.398 --> 00:01:24.144
&gt;&gt; That's great. does that factor net in people's decisions about

00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:29.430
you know, children? Do people worry about that? having sickle cell anaemia.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.950
&gt;&gt; I, I would imagine that in a family where it was common, where it had been

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.610
running through the family that they might consider it.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.570
But I've never heard of people getting that test,

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.280
because with some people they know it's not, it's

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.740
more common in some tribes than it is in others.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.140
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.880
&gt;&gt; And so I think in a tribe like mine where it rarely happens

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.250
I don't see why. I don't think they'd factor in.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.531
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:01:55.531 --> 00:01:58.260
&gt;&gt; Sickle cell anaemia or whether they were

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.430
carriers or not into who they would marry.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:06.440
&gt;&gt; Do you know of the treatment for sickle cell anaemia? I

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.995
mean for people who have it in Kenya? Is it generally accessible? I

00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:12.416
mean is it able? I mean, do people know about it, is

00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:16.120
it something that's able to be treated in general for, for most people?

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.070
&gt;&gt; So in a country like Kenya with

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.012
a rural population that may be less literate.

00:02:23.012 --> 00:02:23.990
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.695
&gt;&gt; They would be less likely to know about treatment options,

00:02:26.695 --> 00:02:31.340
than a population that was more, more urban or more literate.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.980
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.030
&gt;&gt; Not necessarily the same thing but more literate.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.207
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm. They would know more and would have

00:02:36.207 --> 00:02:38.980
access to treatment. So it depends the region as well.
