00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.660
- So this is Sal Khan,
founder of the Khan Academy.

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:05.680
And this is a very exciting
Skype call that we're on.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.260
I'm with Ben Hedrick,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.080
who's the lead for AP Calculus.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.980
What do you at the College Board?

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.570
- Really, anything with AP
Calculus and AP Statistics

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.900
is something that I have a
little bit of control over.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.800
So for example, for AP Calculus,

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.640
anything with the curriculum,
anything with the assessment

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.837
is something that I work with.

00:00:25.837 --> 00:00:29.020
- And I'm sure that you're as excited

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.650
as I am and, you know,

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.040
several hundred thousands of
students are around the country

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.720
for the AP exams that are coming up

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.600
in roughly a little less than a week.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.294
And I thought a fun
place to start would be

00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:44.460
when you guys write the test,

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.020
what are you trying to assess?

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.290
What's the spirit of the questions?

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.622
Both on the multiple choice
and the free response section.

00:00:51.622 --> 00:00:53.620
- So what we're looking for from students

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.520
is evidence of good, conceptual
understanding in calculus.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.890
Now, we have some things that
are gonna test procedures,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.740
but really, we want students
to understand what's going on

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.560
with the calculus rather
than just calculating things

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.110
or putting numbers on paper.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.780
A lot of thinking
questions, a lot of insight

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.240
to make sure that whatever
good calculus those students

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.510
have learned in their courses,

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.920
we're assessing it on the AP exam.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.360
- And I've done a bunch of
example problems for the AP exam,

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.724
and yeah, my sense of it is

00:01:22.724 --> 00:01:26.760
you sometimes will do
some of the minutiae work

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.140
or you'll give the formula,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.380
and you're really trying to understand

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.880
whether students understand the essence

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.800
of what an integral is,

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.680
or the essence of derivative
as a rate of change,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.240
or the slope of a tangent line.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.320
So, if you were preparing for this exam,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.420
if you were the students,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.280
what you suggest to them?

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.170
You know, obviously we have
a little less than a week

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.100
for this current test,

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.960
so what advice would you
have for those students?

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.040
And then just generally, as
students go through the year,

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:51.189
how should they think about it?

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.930
- Yeah, the advice I would give

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.980
is dependent on how much
time the students have

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:57.080
to prepare, so the advice that I give

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.900
at the beginning of the year
is different from the advice

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.662
that I give now, several
days before the exam.

00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:03.970
Getting ready for it, first, relax.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.660
You know, this is a calculus exam.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.990
We're not gonna be throwing
anything at you from left field.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:09.140
It's calculus.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.360
You need to know limits.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.560
You need to know derivatives.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.920
You need to know integrals.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.730
In terms of preparation, make
sure you're taking the time

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:17.254
to review the basics.

00:02:17.254 --> 00:02:18.500
Every question that they see

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.500
is gonna hit one of those big topics,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.570
so make sure you know
your derivative rules,

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.546
make sure you know your integral rules.

00:02:24.546 --> 00:02:26.100
Take a look at the old exams

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.100
and see how we're asking questions.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.940
And you'll at the patterns and
see that we're always asking

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.420
about understanding
what a derivative means,

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.920
understanding integration
or the idea of accumulation.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.730
There are no secrets on the exams,

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.130
so really stick with what we've done.

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:42.650
Make sure that you're thinking of ways

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.220
to apply to your good knowledge,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.611
and just review your basics.

00:02:46.611 --> 00:02:49.060
- And my experience with the
exam is there's a lot of,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.020
as you just said, really the
mainstream, meaty topics.

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:54.720
You know, chain rule, fundamental theorem,

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.260
or theorems of calculus, things like that.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.950
What's your sense of the more,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:00.920
what I would concern maybe a
little bit more, the minutiae,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.770
some of the more special case derivatives,

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.284
or special case integrals,
you know, arc tangent and,

00:03:06.284 --> 00:03:10.355
how much does that play into the exam?

00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:12.250
- You know, I think, Sal,
you've actually answered

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.570
your own question in asking that,

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.470
is it is the minutiae.

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.020
So really, at this point in
time, if you're getting ready

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.320
for the exam, spending time on minutiae

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.836
is not where you're gonna be
best served with your time.

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:24.250
You should be hitting the major things,

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.040
and you said it right at
the beginning, chain rule.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.660
I mean, any kind of question
we do with derivatives,

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.000
you know, if you're doing maxes or mins,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.440
if you're doing tangent lines,

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.350
if you're doing a related rates problem,

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.870
they're all derivatives,
derivatives, derivatives.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.090
And if you're having
trouble with chain rule,

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.940
it doesn't matter how much
minutiae you spend time with,

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.480
the chain rule's gonna come up.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.680
So I would say don't sweat the minutiae.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.210
There might be something on the exam

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.430
that you haven't reviewed
as much as you want to,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.649
but it's gonna be one
single, solitary question.

00:03:53.649 --> 00:03:56.050
Basic derivatives are going to form, well,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.860
the basis for all those problems.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.580
So that's where your time is best spent.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.770
- Yeah, I definitely get that sense.

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.210
Especially, you know, how
do you interpret the first,

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.910
second, you know, derivatives, concavity.

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:10.140
Things like that, those
seem to show up a lot.

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.930
But once again, that's a
conceptual idea of derivatives.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:15.390
And on the integration side,

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.280
I've been doing a bunch
of the free response.

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.840
It just seems like, I mean, you know,

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.300
what happens if you swap
the bounds of integration,

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.620
or if you add integrals.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.300
So a lot of the properties and
the conceptual understanding

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.734
of what an integral is,

00:04:26.734 --> 00:04:29.740
but not necessarily the fancy tricks.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.840
At least at this point,
if you're studying.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:34.080
- Absolutely, there's
nothing that we go after

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.010
the fancy tricks.

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:37.200
We're not trying to ask trick questions

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:38.800
or play any gotcha moments on it.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.880
It's really assessment of calculus.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.330
And for the students who
have been going through

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:43.960
these great courses all year,

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.280
this is a wonderful opportunity to show us

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.590
everything that you know

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.731
and get a really great score on the exam.

00:04:49.731 --> 00:04:51.440
- And what about calculator?

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:52.960
I mean, I was doing some
of the free response.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.440
That first part of the free response,

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.940
knowing your calculator well helps.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.890
- Oh, absolutely.

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:59.250
The calculator's a tool,

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:00.930
and like any tool, you want to make sure

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.390
that you're applying it
appropriately and strategically,

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:05.780
which sometimes means
using your calculator,

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.737
and using it well and correctly,

00:05:07.737 --> 00:05:09.500
but other times not using your calculator.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:11.250
I mean, even on the free response section

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.220
where the calculator is being used,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.220
we expect students to show their work.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.800
If you're taking an integral,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.290
we wanna see that you've
actually taken that integral.

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:21.470
Now, the calculator
will do the work of it,

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:23.080
but we wanna see the notation that says

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.680
this is the integral you calculated,

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.930
and this is the answer you obtained.

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:29.250
And then do whatever you
will with that answer

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:30.560
as required by the question,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.180
but good communication through writing,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.942
even on the calculator
section, is necessary.

00:05:35.942 --> 00:05:39.485
- And for students taking the BC exam,

00:05:39.485 --> 00:05:42.240
above and beyond the core differentiation,

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.530
integration, you know,
a lot of what you learn

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.850
about parametric equations
is actually just an extension

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.980
of what you learn in
differentiation, integration.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:52.420
But probably some of the convergence tests

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:55.320
are something to become
pretty familiar with.

00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.166
- That would be correct, yes.

00:05:57.166 --> 00:06:01.060
- And in terms of grading of the exam,

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.882
you know, some people,

00:06:02.882 --> 00:06:06.081
to get a five or a high,

00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:07.820
my understanding is you
don't need to answer

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:10.493
absolutely every question perfectly.

00:06:10.493 --> 00:06:12.570
- Well, like any test,
if you want to do well,

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.140
you don't have to have perfection on it,

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.400
and this is a test where
students are coming in

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.200
and it's a three hour timed test,

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.340
well, a little over three hour timed test,

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.450
and you know, you can do
a lot of really good work

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:27.830
and earn a five pretty easily.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.380
So I wouldn't tell anyone
to go in there worrying

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.570
about trying to figure out
what magical numbers they need

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.100
to get in order to get a
perfect score on the test

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:37.210
or to get a five on the test

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:39.720
or whatever it is that they're going for.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:41.760
Just go in like you would on any test,

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.300
do your best on every question,

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.046
get every point that you can,

00:06:45.046 --> 00:06:47.110
and hopefully it'll work out fine for you.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.530
- What advice would you have for students,

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.680
especially on the free response

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.920
where there's multiple sections,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.330
and if, you know, on part A they say,

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.300
what, that, that's,

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.070
I don't get what that, what,

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:57.010
you know, should they
skip to the next free,

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.718
what should they do?

00:06:58.718 --> 00:07:02.660
- I actually have very
common advice on that one

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:04.480
and that's to make sure
that students are trying

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.500
every part of a free response question.

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.500
One of the misconceptions students have

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.570
is exactly what you said.

00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:11.920
If you hit part A and you're
freaking out a little bit

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.195
because you don't know
what part A is about,

00:07:14.195 --> 00:07:15.950
that's okay, move on to part B.

00:07:15.950 --> 00:07:18.460
There are some questions
where the answer for part b

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.340
depends on part A, but for
the majority of the questions,

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:22.590
they're separate pieces.

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:24.560
So part A, part B, part C,

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.720
if there's a part D,

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:28.140
they might all be asking
very different things.

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:31.020
And if you have trouble even with part C,

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.520
that doesn't mean the question

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.400
gets progressively more difficult.

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.920
Give part D a try.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.380
And a lot of the things
that we do give points for

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.940
are good, solid calculus work.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:42.660
So if you can set up a problem,

00:07:42.660 --> 00:07:44.350
maybe you don't have time to finish it,

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:46.520
maybe you make some
mistakes along the way,

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:48.650
the answer point is only one little point

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.720
out of the nine.

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.320
There are other points for the setup

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:53.470
and the conceptual
understanding of the problem,

00:07:53.470 --> 00:07:56.280
and a lot of students have
good conceptual understanding

00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:57.558
that they could set up,

00:07:57.558 --> 00:07:59.560
pick up a point here,
pick up a point there,

00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.340
but they panic a little bit,

00:08:01.340 --> 00:08:02.800
and they move on to another question

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.214
and never come back.

00:08:04.214 --> 00:08:06.730
And that's okay if you want to
move on to another question,

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:08.440
but absolutely I would say,

00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.338
if you're having trouble with part A,

00:08:10.338 --> 00:08:12.769
that's all right, take a look at part B.

00:08:12.769 --> 00:08:15.176
- And one thing that I've observed is

00:08:15.176 --> 00:08:16.770
a lot of these questions, at
first when you look at 'em,

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:18.120
like oh wow, this looks like some really,

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:19.660
you know, super deep thing,

00:08:19.660 --> 00:08:23.060
but it really is some
core basic calculus ideas,

00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:24.780
and that if you're on the right track,

00:08:24.780 --> 00:08:26.260
it's actually quite simple.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:29.450
Would you say it's fair
if a student finds himself

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.160
doing a very hairy calculation

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:34.349
that they might question
whether they need to?

00:08:34.349 --> 00:08:36.100
- I would go beyond might.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.660
They should question what they're doing.

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.420
If you've done something
where you feel like

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:41.090
you need to prove a new calculus theorem

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:42.100
in order to answer it,

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.915
something has gone
terribly, terribly wrong.

00:08:44.915 --> 00:08:46.250
And also, if you feel like you need

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:47.840
to bring in some sort of mathematics

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.660
you've never seen before in calculus,

00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:53.700
as much as I hate to say it,
you know, this is calculus.

00:08:53.700 --> 00:08:56.580
It's limits, it's
derivatives, it's integrals.

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:58.460
Even though there's a lot
of wealth in that one,

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:00.630
if you're doing something beyond that,

00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.859
probably something has gone wrong.

00:09:02.859 --> 00:09:04.040
- Yeah, yeah.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.770
Well, thanks.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.240
I think, you know,

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.180
thousands of AP students are
gonna really appreciate that.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:12.749
Any other parting words
for the coming test?

00:09:12.749 --> 00:09:14.400
- You know, it's the same thing

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:15.760
that I used to tell my students

00:09:15.760 --> 00:09:17.160
when I was teaching AP Calculus,

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.520
this is just another test,

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:21.090
and the beauty of AP is
the teachers have been

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.570
prepping their students since
the beginning of the year.

00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:24.920
It's one of the few tests

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.248
where everyone knows what's coming,

00:09:27.248 --> 00:09:30.210
so when you sit down and you've
got free response questions,

00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.030
you've got multiple choice questions,

00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:34.320
you know, there really
shouldn't be any surprises.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:36.693
This is the stuff they've seen all year.

00:09:36.693 --> 00:09:38.361
They know what to do.

00:09:38.361 --> 00:09:40.615
Take a moment, take a breath,

00:09:40.615 --> 00:09:42.350
take a look at the problem,

00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:43.580
get all the points that you can.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:44.940
Show us that good calculus.

00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:46.320
- Awesome, and I'll throw in a plug.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.720
We have tons of resources
for the students as well,

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:51.520
and we're gonna have our
office hours on Monday.

00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:52.920
So, super exciting.

00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:54.230
Thanks a bunch, Ben.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.670
- No, thanks for having me.
