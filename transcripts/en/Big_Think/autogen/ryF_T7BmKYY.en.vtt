Aaron so many times scientists have

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640
Aaron so many times scientists have
 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.450
Aaron so many times scientists have
wondered is it somehow possible that we

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460
wondered is it somehow possible that we
 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.650
wondered is it somehow possible that we
can set up an interplanetary

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660
can set up an interplanetary
 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.740
can set up an interplanetary
communication system so we don't have to

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750
communication system so we don't have to
 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.529
communication system so we don't have to
wait hours to days for messages to go

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:15.539
wait hours to days for messages to go
 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:17.330
wait hours to days for messages to go
back and forth within the solar system

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340
back and forth within the solar system
 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.280
back and forth within the solar system
for example if you want to communicate

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:19.290
for example if you want to communicate
 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.220
for example if you want to communicate
with the Mars rover sometimes it takes

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230
with the Mars rover sometimes it takes
 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.550
with the Mars rover sometimes it takes
up to 20 minutes 20 minutes for a signal

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560
up to 20 minutes 20 minutes for a signal
 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.680
up to 20 minutes 20 minutes for a signal
to go from Earth to Mars and then

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:27.690
to go from Earth to Mars and then
 

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.810
to go from Earth to Mars and then
another 20 minutes for a message to come

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820
another 20 minutes for a message to come
 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.939
another 20 minutes for a message to come
back you certainly cannot carry on a

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949
back you certainly cannot carry on a
 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.979
back you certainly cannot carry on a
conversation between two people this way

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989
conversation between two people this way
 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.200
conversation between two people this way
so some people have said what about

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210
so some people have said what about
 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.540
so some people have said what about
gravity or what about another way to

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
gravity or what about another way to
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.810
gravity or what about another way to
send messages around the solar system

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820
send messages around the solar system
 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:42.740
send messages around the solar system
well there's a problem there

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750
well there's a problem there
 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.979
well there's a problem there
first of all Newton said the gravity

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989
first of all Newton said the gravity
 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.200
first of all Newton said the gravity
moves instantly throughout the solar

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210
moves instantly throughout the solar
 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.990
moves instantly throughout the solar
system if the Sun for example were to

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000
system if the Sun for example were to
 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.080
system if the Sun for example were to
disappear right now right now the Sun

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090
disappear right now right now the Sun
 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.750
disappear right now right now the Sun
were to disappear Newton would say that

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760
were to disappear Newton would say that
 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.549
were to disappear Newton would say that
instantly throughout the universe

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559
instantly throughout the universe
 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.979
instantly throughout the universe
everybody knows that our Sun has

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989
everybody knows that our Sun has
 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.950
everybody knows that our Sun has
disappeared but along comes Einstein who

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960
disappeared but along comes Einstein who
 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.489
disappeared but along comes Einstein who
says not so fast not so fast if the Sun

00:01:07.489 --> 00:01:07.499
says not so fast not so fast if the Sun
 

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:10.099
says not so fast not so fast if the Sun
were to disappear the shock wave of

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:10.109
were to disappear the shock wave of
 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:13.910
were to disappear the shock wave of
gravity travels at the speed of light so

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920
gravity travels at the speed of light so
 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.349
gravity travels at the speed of light so
it would take eight minutes eight

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359
it would take eight minutes eight
 

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:17.899
it would take eight minutes eight
minutes for us to be aware of the fact

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909
minutes for us to be aware of the fact
 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.309
minutes for us to be aware of the fact
that our son has disappeared so gravity

00:01:22.309 --> 00:01:22.319
that our son has disappeared so gravity
 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:25.609
that our son has disappeared so gravity
waves also travel at the speed of light

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619
waves also travel at the speed of light
 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.949
waves also travel at the speed of light
not to be fair no one has ever measured

00:01:27.949 --> 00:01:27.959
not to be fair no one has ever measured
 

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:30.800
not to be fair no one has ever measured
this I repeat no one has ever measured

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810
this I repeat no one has ever measured
 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.249
this I repeat no one has ever measured
the speed of gravity however most

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259
the speed of gravity however most
 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.620
the speed of gravity however most
scientists do believe that gravity

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
scientists do believe that gravity
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.319
scientists do believe that gravity
travels at the speed of light so in

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329
travels at the speed of light so in
 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.149
travels at the speed of light so in
other words to answer your question we

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159
other words to answer your question we
 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.669
other words to answer your question we
simply don't know of a communication

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679
simply don't know of a communication
 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.159
simply don't know of a communication
system that would allow us to link up

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:46.169
system that would allow us to link up
 

00:01:46.169 --> 00:01:48.260
system that would allow us to link up
all the planets of the solar system

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270
all the planets of the solar system
 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.230
all the planets of the solar system
instantly light can't do it gravity

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240
instantly light can't do it gravity
 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.179
instantly light can't do it gravity
can't do it we're faced to the fact that

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189
can't do it we're faced to the fact that
 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.469
can't do it we're faced to the fact that
Einstein is the cop on the block
