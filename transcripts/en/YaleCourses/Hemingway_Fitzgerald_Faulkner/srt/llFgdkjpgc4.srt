1
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,530
Okay. So, um,

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,320
with stalling on our final novel,

3
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:10,270
and I'm very glad this is Faulkner.
Um,

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,610
there's some of these stories to tell
about Faulkner just about the competition

5
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:19,680
after normal. Um, so this started
out having a different title.

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:23,250
Um,
it started out being called dark house,

7
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:27,390
so you can see that it really is right
on the other side of the spectrum. Um,

8
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,900
and it's really interesting the thing
that actually this novel could be

9
00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:35,160
described as either dark
house or late in August.

10
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:40,260
So really late and downfalls. The
other two constitutive parts, Bernardo,

11
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:45,030
even though it's the light that has
been highlighted in the present title,

12
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:49,000
um, in fact, it could just
as well had been dark. Uh,

13
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:51,770
this is what Faulkner says about,
um,

14
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,570
the title that we now have late in August.
Um,

15
00:00:55,650 --> 00:01:00,330
this is much later. Um, he, um,
when he was hopping about it,

16
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,380
um,

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:06,380
the University of Virginia in
1957 in August in Mississippi,

18
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:13,020
there's a few days somewhere about the
middle of the month when actually just

19
00:01:13,021 --> 00:01:15,540
fortes or fall is cool.

20
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,890
There's a [inaudible] and luminous
quality to the light as though it came not

21
00:01:21,091 --> 00:01:22,230
from today,

22
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:27,620
but from back in the old classic times
in my Alphonse and Santos and the gods

23
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,780
from police.
And that's all that the title meant.

24
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,470
It was just to me lessened evocative
title because it reminded me of that time

25
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:46,070
of who luminosity older than
our Christians through ization.

26
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:51,770
Maybe the connection is
we've been a growth who has
something of that plague and

27
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:54,540
quality. This is great. Um,

28
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:57,800
Andrew Point two novel,
um,

29
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,800
is about the quality of
light in Mississippi.

30
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:04,500
So it has a very important
local dimension to it,

31
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,490
but in also is sees itself as completely,
um,

32
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:14,650
looking back to extremely long literary
tradition going back to the classic

33
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,530
times. Um, and in fact
it predates Christianity.

34
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:24,030
So that's very important, um, to consider
it as well is that Christianity is very,

35
00:02:24,031 --> 00:02:26,090
very important in this novel.
Um,

36
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:29,550
but it's very important to remember
that thought and actually also has a

37
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:33,960
reference point that is older
than Christianity. So, um,

38
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,560
because thought that was talking about
funds and Seth has just, you know, I mean,

39
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:39,940
I think the dose was,
I just words to most of it.

40
00:02:39,941 --> 00:02:44,941
So I just found some illustration
is this is from the Roman mosaics.

41
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,420
Um, the satire, so he can see
it. Basically, it's a huge, uh,

42
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,290
like human beings except
the WHO's the feet, uh, uh,

43
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,310
the WHO's of a goat.
So that's really the,

44
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,580
this is not a very pretty,
um, image on the farm.

45
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:04,190
I think that in our minds
with 10 to thing of the fine,

46
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,100
it's very delicate and graceful,
um,

47
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,010
but as they have kind of an
animalistic dimension to it. Um,

48
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,070
and this is more of probably looking
more like our stereotypical image of the

49
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:22,030
foreign, very graceful. Uh, but
nonetheless we're to WHO's of a goat.

50
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,580
So, um, and, uh,

51
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:29,230
as I lay down and we talked a lot about
the relation to train animals and humans,

52
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:32,320
um, so it's very important
to keep that in mind as well,

53
00:03:32,321 --> 00:03:37,060
just in the reference to the fun.
Faulkner is,

54
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:41,560
uh, invoking that whole
uncertain boundary. Um,

55
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:45,880
and then in between is
between human and animal.

56
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,640
Um, and as the satire actually
has the even long history,

57
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:54,810
if the phone basically is
Roman, um, set high, has a,

58
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:59,930
it goes back to the fifth
century BC basically is Rick
and there's a whole genre

59
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,410
called satire comedy if
filtering this creature. Um,

60
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,000
it's again looking for the most
part, like a human being. Um,

61
00:04:10,030 --> 00:04:15,030
but having the tail of a horse
and also the ears of a daunting,

62
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:16,990
um,

63
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:21,990
just to see the way in which the satire
has been reactivated and picking up and

64
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:25,840
reading incarnated in the 20th century.

65
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:29,920
Here is someone have the ears of I,
you know,

66
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:31,720
we them the Vulcans ears,

67
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:36,721
but looking at your faculty like the
ears of the satire a and here's another

68
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:42,370
image. Basically the ears are the
giveaway of this creature. Also small, um,

69
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,990
very, not very noble looking compared
to the human being onto the guard.

70
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:52,250
Um, so, but father, even though he's
interested in the center in Florence,

71
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:56,650
he's not really writing about them.
He, he's mostly interested in Lena, um,

72
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:01,210
and the fact that she is
a pagan character to him.

73
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:06,610
So more on Lena.
She was never ashamed of that child,

74
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:09,400
whether it had any father or not.

75
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:15,030
She was simply going to the conventional
laws of the time and find his father.

76
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,800
But as far as she was concerned,

77
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:23,010
she didn't especially need any father
Fred any more than the women that on whom

78
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:24,550
Jupiter,

79
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:28,990
bigger children when answers
for home and her father.

80
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:34,530
So father seems to be really interested
in women who get Brandon out of wedlock,

81
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:41,230
right with vendors. Um, and as
I laid down in Dewey doubt, um,

82
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,610
and um,
the,

83
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:47,290
the kind of way in which that is
the constant burden on her mind.

84
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:52,720
Um, and it seems that he now has gone
to the other side of the spectrum. Um,

85
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:57,100
if pregnancy was a
constant burden on Dewey,

86
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,460
Dell's mind here,

87
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,880
it appears that it is not a burden at all.
Um,

88
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,760
leaners mine and maybe
that's why she's a pagan, um,

89
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:12,820
is that it's completely okay to be proud
and our web long not to have a father

90
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:18,800
not as aware that father, um,
as the father of your child. Um,

91
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:23,830
and the reason that is the case is that
Jupiter has had this long history of

92
00:06:24,021 --> 00:06:27,710
having father, many children, um,

93
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,650
who can point to with her as the father,
Jupiter, suse, um, as the father,

94
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:34,550
but otherwise not having a human father.

95
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:39,550
So it's a completely honorable thing to
have a baby when you don't know who the

96
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:40,850
father is.

97
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,100
And the most famous example of
course is someone called leader,

98
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:46,730
right?

99
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:51,730
So you guys know I'm picking
two very chase illustrations,

100
00:06:51,810 --> 00:06:56,570
a leader and this one, this
one being suits, obviously. Um,

101
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,620
but you can, if you would just go and
look it up, you can find numerous,

102
00:07:00,621 --> 00:07:04,880
other than the stations, I'm also a
chase, uh, showing Leda and the Swan,

103
00:07:04,881 --> 00:07:08,840
and this is the most famous example,
um, Leidos married to someone else.

104
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:10,820
And so it was just was enamored of her.

105
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:16,060
So he comes to her in the form
of a swan and the offspring one,

106
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:21,140
the most famous offspring
from that union was Helen.

107
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,810
So basically the whole of the Iliad,
the whole of the artists,

108
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:30,110
they really comes from this
union between Beta and sooth.

109
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,010
Um,

110
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:36,010
and there would have been no attic at
all if that had not been this union

111
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:39,890
between leader and someone
who's not quite human. Um,

112
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,680
so here's another
illustration. This one is, uh,

113
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:47,710
Greg and this one is Roman was again
Roman most say in many modern incarnations

114
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,730
as well. Um, yeah, he's also
has a poem about leader.

115
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:57,310
So basically someone who
goes down in history as, um,

116
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,060
and kind of thought if even though
it's not presented in this way,

117
00:08:02,061 --> 00:08:06,510
but she's really going down in history
as the most honorable instance of

118
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,920
pregnancy outside of wet bar. Um, so,

119
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:15,520
but farmers also not writing
leaders story either, right?

120
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:17,750
He's writing leaners story.

121
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,910
So this is very much a case of
Lena updating the American Lena,

122
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:26,250
updating the Greek data. Um, she,

123
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:30,950
even though maybe she doesn't
know the father or maybe you know,

124
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:35,510
but she's not sure that she can get
the legitimate wedded husband to be the

125
00:08:35,511 --> 00:08:38,650
father of the top. She's definitely
going to go and, and you know,

126
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,590
she's going to get someone.

127
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,920
So it was her destiny to have a
husband and children and she knew it.

128
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:49,310
And so she went out and attended to it
completely matter with that, you know,

129
00:08:49,311 --> 00:08:54,311
this is the American case is not the
old classic times and the more I in 20th

130
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:58,050
century America, you need
to find a guy. So, um,

131
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,070
she's on the road, um, to
find this guy, uh, who,

132
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,570
whom she still thinks is thought
to be out of the actual father.

133
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:12,150
So today's lecture is really
about the updating of, um,

134
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,480
of, of this, the old
classmate when mother,

135
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,380
and um,
this is the structure of today's lecture.

136
00:09:19,381 --> 00:09:21,390
The way that I've been talking
about. Obviously, you know,

137
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,880
this is going to be comedy
on the part of Lena.

138
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:27,630
So it's comedy and
especially sex as comic. Um,

139
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:31,860
but because this is a road
novel, one of the Manny, um,

140
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,790
it also has an epic
dimension to it. Um, and,

141
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,860
and now the innovation that foreigner is
bring to bear on novel and that really

142
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:44,160
is a serious,
uh,

143
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:48,120
updating of the classic epic calamity,
um,

144
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:50,190
is the introduction of two.

145
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:54,840
Allegorical name's Byron and burden.
So,

146
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,870
um, but just, just let,
um, they want to go back,

147
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:01,860
still linger with the
classics for a moment. Um,

148
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:04,590
in the defining comedy
in that particular way.

149
00:10:04,591 --> 00:10:07,890
Usually we just think of comedy is,
you know, like Jane Austin, you know,

150
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:12,460
that would be comedy. Um, having,
having, uh, but actually, um,

151
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,373
in the poetics,

152
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,130
Aristotle defines a common thing in
slightly different way than Natalie is

153
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:22,460
closer to the way that I would like to
talk about comedy in this class in the,

154
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:25,740
he's has the participants in comedy,

155
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:30,920
we're car commodore die not from the bean
revelers but because they wander from

156
00:10:32,581 --> 00:10:37,530
one village to another.
So wandering on the row people,

157
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,360
persons who are inferior,

158
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:44,840
not however going all the way to fool
villainy but imitating the ugly a wish

159
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:53,010
doesn't do the interest is one pot.
The ludicrous that is,

160
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:58,070
is a failing of or a piece of Berliners
which causes no pain or destruction with

161
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:04,110
a very content into the
definition of comedy.

162
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,840
A lot of it is, is not
that nice. You know,

163
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:10,040
it has to do with villainous people,

164
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:14,790
but not going all the way to food.
Villainy ugly people.

165
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,650
But again,
not going all the way.

166
00:11:16,651 --> 00:11:20,940
So that other lady speak about it has
a lot to deal with people who are not

167
00:11:20,941 --> 00:11:25,020
knowable. And that really is the
classic definition of comedy.

168
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:27,890
The emphasis really less on,
um,

169
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:32,220
the happy ending then on the
fact that they are low born, um,

170
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,640
that they are low in every other way,

171
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,310
that they don't rise to the,

172
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,370
to the tragic height of nobility,

173
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:45,660
which is the elevation proper to um,
to,

174
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:50,610
to tragedy. Um, combinate
is of much lower elevation.

175
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:54,480
Um, so they are sometimes
the Chris, um, they uh,

176
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:57,050
basically not at we will people,
um,

177
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:02,100
but as one result of not being completely
admirable is that they actually

178
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:09,700
survive quite well. They
actually manage to, um,

179
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,920
you know, to hang in there. Um,

180
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:16,950
so they bring no pain or destruction
either to themselves or to other people.

181
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:21,760
Once again, this is the
exact opposite, a tragedy.

182
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:25,120
We have mass destruction
at the end of tragedy.

183
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:29,380
Everything about the challenge that
you're Troy of all the tragedies based on

184
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:33,590
the story to try and master
introduction here. Um, accommodate.

185
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:37,840
It's just that everyone is going
to be able to survive. So, um,

186
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,280
with that definition in mind,
um,

187
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:45,700
less thing about the ways in
which Lena as peg and there,

188
00:12:45,701 --> 00:12:50,701
especially in relation to her sexuality
and the way the five that represents

189
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,200
this aspect of him, the
human condition. Um,

190
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:59,890
and this is the story of
how Lena gets pregnant.

191
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,520
She's lab in the lean to room
at the back of the house.

192
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:08,260
It had a window which she learn to open
and close again in the dark without

193
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:13,261
making noise to live the eight years
before she opened the window for the first

194
00:13:13,901 --> 00:13:14,734
time,

195
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:19,750
she had not opened it a
dozen times Hartley before
she discover that should not

196
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:23,560
have opened it at Oh, she said
to herself, that's just my luck.

197
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:27,340
Two weeks later she climbed
again through the window.

198
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:32,200
It was a little difficult this time
even had been this hard to do before.

199
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:37,120
I reckon that would not be doing it. Now
she talked. So the UN has, or I know this,

200
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,510
what could have been seen as tragic,
traumatic,

201
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:45,520
the kind of devastation of one person's
life, one poses line being ruined,

202
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,470
all that is told through binos
relation to the window, um,

203
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:54,430
that she can open it without making a
noise that's just done it a few times and

204
00:13:54,431 --> 00:13:58,030
then she realized this shouldn't have
done it. And then the final time,

205
00:13:58,090 --> 00:14:02,590
it's really hard, but she wished that
it had been that hard to begin with.

206
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:08,070
So it's all told through this completely
off focus of center relation to the

207
00:14:12,131 --> 00:14:15,220
main event and is,
it doesn't,

208
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:17,680
it doesn't seem especially bad really,
you know,

209
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:22,681
even though this matter of inconvenience
and that really is what the pregnancy

210
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:27,520
is to lean that it is a matter
of inconvenience isn't nuisance.

211
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:32,140
That is not so easy for her to
get out the window this time. Um,

212
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:37,200
and just to remind us the
farm that doesn't always
write about sexuality in this

213
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:39,041
way.

214
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:44,041
And let's just go back to a character who
was completely non pagan and this none

215
00:14:45,401 --> 00:14:50,290
other, um, more normal striking example.

216
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,660
Quentin, um, in the sound of the fury. Um,

217
00:14:53,690 --> 00:14:56,360
so this is what you think
thinks about women's sexuality,

218
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,980
delicate equilibrium or periodic
filth between two moons,

219
00:15:00,981 --> 00:15:05,570
balance moons. He says full and
yellow as harvest moons, her hips,

220
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,140
thighs,

221
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:10,700
liquid faction like drunk
things floating like power,

222
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:15,110
rubber laterally filled, getting the
border of honeysuckle. Oh, mixed up.

223
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,680
So for Quentin and indeed
for most non big and,

224
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:25,760
uh, characters, there's a good part
of the world that is repugnant,

225
00:15:25,820 --> 00:15:29,000
that is just really repulsive.
Um,

226
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:34,030
and it turns out that women and
sexuality is part of that very,

227
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,620
very prominent,
uh,

228
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:40,550
well and so it's not great
to live in a world like that.

229
00:15:40,670 --> 00:15:44,420
That's really why Quentin
does what he does. Um,

230
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:49,100
for someone like Lena for his
Pagan, um, much of the world,

231
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:53,280
in fact, probably all of the
world is not Republican, you know,

232
00:15:53,290 --> 00:15:57,200
is inconvenience. Sometimes
it's a little ugly flow, messy,

233
00:15:57,350 --> 00:16:02,180
but it's not rebelling. And that's
why she is where she is. Um,

234
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:03,290
so on,

235
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:08,291
so this is one way we can think about
Lena in version tell you that she's not

236
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,510
the only character. So there's
novel is actually not that comic,

237
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:16,100
but her share of the novel
as comic and in that way.

238
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:18,060
But um,

239
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,220
even though there is now
this defines comedy as um,

240
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,840
as basically the journey, um, that
is undertaken by ignoble persons.

241
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:32,320
The more recognizable modern
obviously is the epic journey, right?

242
00:16:32,330 --> 00:16:36,710
So anytime we think of someone travelling
on the road, we thing of the APIC Jara.

243
00:16:37,130 --> 00:16:39,050
Um,
and that is very much in play.

244
00:16:39,050 --> 00:16:44,030
We're that employed elsewhere in Faulkner
is her imagine the way here as well.

245
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:47,630
And this is actually a kind
of not so funny a killer.

246
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:50,450
It's interesting to see what
the tone of this is. Um,

247
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,190
of description of Lena being underwrote,

248
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:59,010
building muse plot in a steady
and unflagging hypnosis.

249
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:04,630
The vehicle does not seem to progress
like a shabby beat upon the mile red

250
00:17:05,301 --> 00:17:10,010
string of rope. So much so is this
that in the watching of it, the,

251
00:17:10,011 --> 00:17:15,011
I loses a site and sense drowse Linwood
and land the road itself with all the

252
00:17:16,401 --> 00:17:20,690
peaceful and monotonous changes
between darkness and day,

253
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:25,160
like already measure thread
being rewind onto a school.

254
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:30,790
So that Alaska as though our sound
trivial and unimportant Asian beyond even

255
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:32,943
distance,

256
00:17:33,110 --> 00:17:38,110
the sound of it seems to come slow and
terrific and without meaning as though it

257
00:17:38,871 --> 00:17:39,140
were,

258
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:44,140
goes traveling a half mile ahead
of his own shape rate description.

259
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,600
Um, and it's, um,

260
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,930
it's on a different register can see
that it's really on a different tone.

261
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:55,590
No register from Lina having
trouble climbing out the window. Um,

262
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,750
and I would say that that the,

263
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,840
there's a complicated relation between
the APIC drama and the comic genre in

264
00:18:03,851 --> 00:18:06,030
this novel on the whole,
uh,

265
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:10,130
what the addict genre
brings to this novel, um,

266
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:15,210
is the sense of some of a
journey that simply has to go on,

267
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,100
um, is not even especially,
um, pleasurable,

268
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:24,780
um, is just stretches on, um, yesterday.

269
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:28,980
Just the thing more in terms of
paradigm that we've been using, um,

270
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:33,720
tomorrow is going to be exactly like
today and going to be exactly like

271
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:37,950
yesterday is the state
repetition of the same. Um,

272
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,920
that defines this kind of epic journey.

273
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:46,430
So it is peaceful and monotonous and
image that thoughtfully uses is that it's

274
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:52,941
like already measured the threat
being rewarmed onto the spoon,

275
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:56,760
right? There's absolutely
nothing new under the sun.

276
00:18:56,850 --> 00:19:01,260
It is just an old story being
told over and over again.

277
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:06,050
Um, and um, the complete, um,

278
00:19:06,630 --> 00:19:11,630
exclusion of anything that is dramatic
from this sense of the journey.

279
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,290
So it's in many ways it's very hard to
write a novel based on the fact that it's

280
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:19,320
completely monotonous and as part
of the challenge of, you know,

281
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:24,110
I promise you the rest of where as
with anything but monotonous, but um,

282
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,260
leaders part of it,

283
00:19:25,261 --> 00:19:30,261
Ashley aspires to be monotonous in a
good sense in the sense that there's

284
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:34,770
really, um, is good. You know, that
there's no dramatic development,

285
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:38,190
there's no catastrophe.
That's really what Faulkner has.

286
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:42,100
The back of his head is that could,
has to fade is what defines tragedy.

287
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:47,190
Non Catastrophe is more
defiance comedy. So, um,

288
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,380
just to give you a sense of the
way in which this epic journey,

289
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:56,670
it's been incarnated and
incarnated American literature,

290
00:19:56,730 --> 00:20:00,960
two other very famous novelists,
Jack Heroin on the road.

291
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:05,780
And more recently, this apocalyptic
instance of that calming in the car,

292
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:10,710
the, the road, um,
foreigners on the road, um,

293
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:13,590
is a low different from those two.
Um,

294
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,650
so today we'll think about all the
ingredients that go into his making of his

295
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:24,090
road novel has to deal with
kindness of strangers, um,

296
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:27,360
has to do with something
like switch ability. Um,

297
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:32,420
if the journey is going to be
pretty monotonous for Lina,

298
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:36,840
the scar to be some variation, right?
It has to alternate with something else.

299
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,540
So it turns out that actually,

300
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:44,250
even though the protagonist who itself
is two is peaceful for the story to be

301
00:20:44,251 --> 00:20:47,320
very dramatic. Um, there
will be other people,

302
00:20:47,321 --> 00:20:49,960
the supporting counts actually
with supply, the drama.

303
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:53,160
So there's a kind of as a switch
and below they be him, um,

304
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:56,110
where the action or where the
drama is going to come from.

305
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,630
As long as Lena is concerned,

306
00:20:57,631 --> 00:21:01,420
the drama is going to come from the
supporting cast rather than from Vienna

307
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:02,500
herself.
Um,

308
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:07,530
and this for which ability in terms of
the relation to train the weighty and

309
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:09,520
that Monday.
And then I'll talk about jurrens as well.

310
00:21:09,521 --> 00:21:12,190
So there's the outline of what is to come,

311
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:17,200
but let's just stay with the kindness
of strangers, uh, for a little bit. Um,

312
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:21,530
leaners come by farm.
Um, and the reason, um,

313
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,760
that the journey is so
peaceful and monotonous is
that there's an endless supply

314
00:21:28,811 --> 00:21:32,080
of people who would do things for right,

315
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,830
who will be the suppliers of hospitality,
um,

316
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:39,790
to keep going.
And that too is very Greek.

317
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:44,690
We know that hospitality is
one of the key virtues, um,

318
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:49,540
in Greek cocksure that when a stranger
comes to supposed to feed them,

319
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,870
shelter them, give them
presence when they go away. Um,

320
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:57,310
that is the understanding of the basic
model that are exchanged between human

321
00:21:57,311 --> 00:21:59,050
beings is that you're good to people,

322
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,220
you think the first time and
that you never see again. Um,

323
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:07,390
so this Google hardly the something of
that and the way that and at has being

324
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:08,224
treated,

325
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:13,710
the evocation of far is the peaceful
corridor paved with unflagging and

326
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:19,630
triumphal faith and people
with kindness and thing.

327
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:23,680
Those faces and voices,
Lucas version, I don't know.

328
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:28,440
I don't know anybody by that name around
here. This road. It goes to Honda.

329
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:32,620
He might be there as possible. Here's a
work in this going a piece of the way,

330
00:22:32,890 --> 00:22:34,090
we'll take you that far.

331
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,470
So these people are completely
faceless and nameless.

332
00:22:38,471 --> 00:22:40,660
They really aren't complete strangers.

333
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:44,890
They're not meant to be remembered
or to be encountered again,

334
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,000
even though,

335
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,760
and sometimes actually picks up some
of them and there's other novels,

336
00:22:49,330 --> 00:22:54,330
but they're meant to recede into the
background as part of that peaceful and

337
00:22:54,611 --> 00:22:59,611
monotonous corridor and which it is
completely safe for being a travel right.

338
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:02,501
So it's,

339
00:23:02,501 --> 00:23:07,501
this has of guarantees safety due to
the guarantee hospitality of strangers.

340
00:23:10,270 --> 00:23:13,930
But we know that it's,

341
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:18,960
the kindness of strangers has got to take
a dramatic turn for there to be a good

342
00:23:19,901 --> 00:23:24,700
story into the novel. So we're
actually seeing a very soon, um,

343
00:23:24,790 --> 00:23:27,860
and it comes about,
um,

344
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:32,200
through leaners interaction with a couple,

345
00:23:32,201 --> 00:23:35,710
she was being taken in by this couple,
um,

346
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:40,800
and it turns out that they arrive or of
Lena careism and leisure upheaval in the

347
00:23:42,821 --> 00:23:44,830
life of this married couple.

348
00:23:44,831 --> 00:23:49,170
So all of a sudden Lina recedes
into the background. So, you know,

349
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,660
we can also to switch ability.

350
00:23:50,661 --> 00:23:54,470
We can also add the switch ability
between foreground and background.

351
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:59,920
Lina recedes into the background as the
supporting cast comes to the foreground.

352
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,950
So this is the exchange between the arms.
There's,

353
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:09,020
he cannot tell from her voice
if she's watching him or not.

354
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,720
Now he to Howard's himself
with his lead flowers,

355
00:24:12,721 --> 00:24:17,721
said maybe she will ever is running away
from her is after I reckon is going to

356
00:24:18,261 --> 00:24:23,261
find out can made a bad mistake when he
started before he put the Mississippi

357
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:24,380
River and train them.

358
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:29,330
And now he knows that she's
watching him do gray woman,

359
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:34,630
not plum enough then men hot work
on in a serviceable Greg Garman,

360
00:24:36,770 --> 00:24:40,250
one savage and bras her hands on her hips,

361
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:45,610
her phase like those of generals who
had been defeated in battles you man.

362
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:49,150
She says,
what do you want to do about it?

363
00:24:49,151 --> 00:24:52,340
To other out whether it's
sleeping the by maybe you men,

364
00:24:52,341 --> 00:24:54,180
she says done there.

365
00:24:55,610 --> 00:25:00,500
So this is all we are going to early.
We'll get one more a little bit for this,

366
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:04,490
but this is really, um, for
as far as staff nurse one.

367
00:25:04,491 --> 00:25:09,491
So this is completely adequate fleas
standing snapshot of the marriage.

368
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:10,880
Um,

369
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:15,880
and I would say that it is as interesting
as the marriage between Cora and her

370
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:20,820
husband and how, um,
except that is sort of,

371
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:23,780
is at the moment of
tension between the two.

372
00:25:24,170 --> 00:25:28,700
So we know that what kinds
of people, these are the
poor whites. One more, right?

373
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:29,840
People where,

374
00:25:29,870 --> 00:25:34,270
who can afford and how and use
split flowers after a towel.

375
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:36,033
Um,

376
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:41,110
and the re the way that they
actually know each other very well.

377
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:46,810
So, um, arms to, doesn't
have to look as the arms.

378
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,570
Um, Armstead doesn't have to look. Um,

379
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:54,770
usually to see issues
watching him on that,

380
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,600
it really says a lot about
what kind of relationship, um,

381
00:25:59,690 --> 00:26:03,830
it is that you can just tell by the
tone of voice whether or not the other

382
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,300
person's looking at you.

383
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:10,360
So that for me is a measure of
how good our marriage is that,

384
00:26:11,781 --> 00:26:15,080
you know, you know, your companion,
that why, just a tone of words,

385
00:26:15,081 --> 00:26:19,130
we'll be able to tell you exactly the
posture, the physical departure, um,

386
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:23,620
of this person. Um, so initially you
can really tell. Um, but then, um,

387
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:26,150
once he says something, once
he said, okay, you know,

388
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,510
that this guy is not going to be
able to escape from [inaudible].

389
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:34,790
Once he said that, then she know
instantly that she's looking at him.

390
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,730
Um, and we know what she
looks like. Um, serve, uh,

391
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:43,500
uh, uh, um,

392
00:26:43,530 --> 00:26:47,210
most doing version I think of addy,
um,

393
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:52,300
but pretty much very much belonging
to the same socio economic group,

394
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:58,770
um, in a gray gum and, um,
working hard all alive,

395
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,800
but also not just work hard and all
this interesting and adjectives by a

396
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:09,770
[inaudible] man hot. I don't exactly
know what that means, man. Hot.

397
00:27:09,771 --> 00:27:13,410
It's just that maybe she is completely
resistant to the charms of men.

398
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:17,370
Maybe that's one definition of
what it means to be man hall. Um,

399
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:21,690
certainly she's worked hard all her
life and maybe the two adjectives are

400
00:27:21,691 --> 00:27:25,680
related in that way. There's a way in
which, you know, if you will so hodge, um,

401
00:27:26,310 --> 00:27:29,970
all your life, you're kind of immune to
a chance of other people, men and women.

402
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:35,250
Um, so she is immune to the
charms. Her husband, um,

403
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,700
and her face is like the phase of
generals who've been defeated in,

404
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:48,220
um, it is, we reference,
um, it is not, you know,

405
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:53,250
the civil war is really not important.
Um, in this who are the, no,

406
00:27:53,251 --> 00:27:55,920
actually it was very,
very important to another character,

407
00:27:55,921 --> 00:27:58,480
but it's not going to Reno.
Um,

408
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,230
the civil was front and
center for another character,

409
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:06,260
but it's oddly intrudes into this moment
when it really is not the reference

410
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,080
point.
Um,

411
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:13,220
but they are at high history of the
south is in the acts in this reference of

412
00:28:14,521 --> 00:28:19,150
Mrs arms, this face looking
like, um, the face of general.

413
00:28:19,151 --> 00:28:23,800
So she is in many ways
she's more like a man, um,

414
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,380
than like a woman. Um, I
know there's actually, um,

415
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:31,930
that when I came to this sections,
uh,

416
00:28:32,070 --> 00:28:33,570
last week and I enjoyed them very much.

417
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:38,520
Some of you mentioned that they cause
is financially, uh, more like a man.

418
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:42,140
So it's rosemary.
Rosemary is financially more like a man.

419
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:46,560
So the Fitzgerald has also thought about
the ways in which they could be across

420
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:50,970
gender dynamics in people,
otherwise completely feminine. Um,

421
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:52,180
and here's,

422
00:28:52,190 --> 00:28:56,760
she doesn't look especially
feminine and across Gender Dynamics,

423
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,480
um, much, much more powerful here.

424
00:29:00,481 --> 00:29:04,530
So she is like the general
who's been defeated in battle.

425
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:08,880
Maybe she's been defeated in life just
because there's been such a hard life,

426
00:29:08,881 --> 00:29:12,350
although you know that. So,
um, or just that you know,

427
00:29:12,351 --> 00:29:15,370
that it didn't go exactly
the way she wanted. Uh,

428
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:19,230
we don't know the contents
of that phrase that you know,

429
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:23,760
that we'll have phases like the face
of generals who had been defeated. Um,

430
00:29:23,790 --> 00:29:25,980
we also don't know,
but that's the least of it.

431
00:29:26,010 --> 00:29:31,010
We don't know why she suddenly saying
what she's saying to her husband.

432
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,650
And,
um,

433
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:39,980
honestly there's really not contemplating
having an affair with being right.

434
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:45,440
So the doorman is not really a
complaint against her husband.

435
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:51,770
It is a grievance that is probably
to record against the entire,

436
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:58,570
you know, half of the
human population, men, um,

437
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,830
that this is what men would do to women.
Um,

438
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:05,960
and her husband being an instance of that.
Although you know,

439
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:10,540
obviously there are many other episodes
in the marriage who might that might be

440
00:30:10,541 --> 00:30:14,920
at the back of her mind. But in any
case, this completely out of the blue,

441
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,570
out of context,

442
00:30:16,930 --> 00:30:21,930
outburst from Mrs arms that suggest that
this is both buffering good marriage

443
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:28,360
but also a complicated marriage as
all marriages would have to beat,

444
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:30,250
right if there's lasted for a long time.

445
00:30:30,670 --> 00:30:35,320
So these two people know
each other very well. Um,

446
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:40,420
and he seems to know he knows better than
we do exactly what is going on in her

447
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:45,050
mind when she says you do
it, man. Um, and then this,

448
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:49,790
um, uh, further development
to this. And so, um,

449
00:30:51,130 --> 00:30:55,130
she's actually now this, we're getting
into dramatic action for Mr. Thompson.

450
00:30:55,960 --> 00:31:00,160
Whether are you fixing to do with your
egg money this time of night? He says,

451
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:04,840
I reckon his mind to do with what I like,
she just dumps into the land per phase,

452
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:06,640
hush better.

453
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:10,990
God knows it was me sweat over them
and nurse them. You never lifted.

454
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,790
No hand show is says,

455
00:31:13,060 --> 00:31:17,080
I recommend a in any human in this
country is going to dispute them hands.

456
00:31:17,081 --> 00:31:22,020
Will you lesson is the possums. And this
next, that rooster band leader, he says,

457
00:31:22,030 --> 00:31:27,010
because two things suddenly to job's off
one shoe and strikes the China event,

458
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:32,320
the single Shannon glow from the bat
reclining Armstead watches her Gavin's

459
00:31:33,371 --> 00:31:38,371
remaining coins from amount of China
Franklin's and drop them where the others

460
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:44,940
into the slack and nodded and really
nodded three or four times with savage

461
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:48,510
finality.
Um,

462
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:53,830
that is says satisfying representations
of arms giving or people we being

463
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:59,440
charitable and looking completely not
charitable when they're doing it. Right.

464
00:31:59,441 --> 00:32:04,441
So this is the only way this woman would
allow herself to be a chair of the boat

465
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:10,350
is by looking as harsh
and bitter as she could.

466
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,950
Um, so, uh, uh,

467
00:32:15,010 --> 00:32:18,760
before that [inaudible] had thought, well,
you know, maybe she's just into comfort,

468
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:20,650
jealous moon.

469
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,370
It was just going to not allow
leaner to stay in the house,

470
00:32:24,371 --> 00:32:27,970
but it turns out that is
quite the opposite. Um,

471
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:31,960
and it's poly is a kind
of very calm, calm, calm,

472
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:36,370
calm class combination of recognizing
that yes, this is a young woman,

473
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,220
very attractive, um, that she's not
that young woman, very attractive. Um,

474
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,220
but recognizing maybe in some sense,
um,

475
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,890
that, you know, she also,

476
00:32:48,891 --> 00:32:53,891
that this woman is embodying a long nurse
grievance that she has against man in

477
00:32:56,241 --> 00:32:59,840
general, whatever the psychology, um,

478
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:04,500
she is in solidarity,
um,

479
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:09,700
with Lina without ever wanting
to be trade that solidarity,

480
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:16,210
right? So it is that complicated
kind of behavior, um,

481
00:33:16,310 --> 00:33:20,270
that you want to do something for that
person that you never want to give

482
00:33:20,271 --> 00:33:24,290
yourself away is doing
something. Um, so it,

483
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,860
it really is the,
uh,

484
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:32,600
the most interesting and dramatic
and psychologically and behaviorally

485
00:33:32,601 --> 00:33:36,180
complicated kind of client
is or strangers, um,

486
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:41,350
is that is not definitely not the
traditional kind of arms giving.

487
00:33:41,990 --> 00:33:44,090
So in terms of the narrative dynamics,

488
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:49,091
we can say that the arms does have
completely taken over the narrative,

489
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,121
right?

490
00:33:50,121 --> 00:33:55,121
There's a complete switch between
Lena to suppose for tagging is,

491
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,000
um, and the two of them
be in the supporting cast.

492
00:33:59,390 --> 00:34:04,390
It turns out that the supporting cast
that fall in probably spends more time

493
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,080
thinking about the supporting cast than
he does thinking about protagonists.

494
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:16,130
And that is a really interesting way to
define the protagonists is that maybe

495
00:34:16,131 --> 00:34:20,540
the protagonist is someone you can
actually afford not to spend a of time

496
00:34:20,541 --> 00:34:21,374
thinking about.

497
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:26,650
And that is really the supporting cast
that you have to give your energy to it.

498
00:34:27,111 --> 00:34:31,040
A very interesting
definition of reversibility,

499
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:35,870
of the distribution of space, distribution
of attention within the story.

500
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:40,850
Um, and we've seen many instances of
this. So, um, just to, because we've,

501
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,040
we've just done with Gero just going to
remind you of a very obvious instance of

502
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:49,880
switch ability and tender is the night,
um,

503
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:54,970
in the description of Nicole that who
ran back is hanging from the pools,

504
00:34:55,101 --> 00:35:00,020
right? So it, the human body is
hanging from the appendage, um,

505
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:00,171
uh,

506
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:05,171
completely switch the reboost degree
of importance between the person who

507
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,720
supposed to the protagonist and that
what is supposed to be just in the panel.

508
00:35:11,990 --> 00:35:16,400
And of course that such ability that is
played out not only in terms of that one

509
00:35:16,401 --> 00:35:21,401
particular detail but also in terms of
the entire narrative of is the night.

510
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:26,620
It turns out that Duke divers completely
upstage by Nicole as she becomes really

511
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:32,570
the main actor in the novel
that is becomes her story,

512
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:37,780
that she gets to dictate the outcome of
that story and he becomes her bandage

513
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:42,810
and dispensable appendage at
the end of the novel. So, um,

514
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,220
we've, we've seen this in Faulkner. Um,

515
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:50,270
basically on a very large macro scale in
terms of the entire narrative structure

516
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:54,330
of tender is the night in
thoughtless is much more local.

517
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,980
It's just this one moment,
um,

518
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,750
that this is switch relation to train
protagonists and supporting cast. Um,

519
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:02,551
but I also,

520
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:07,551
and but they're also plays
out in different registers
in tenders and light in

521
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:09,840
August.

522
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:14,330
So we'll look at one other also
local instance of such ability.

523
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,270
Um,

524
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:20,270
and this is the food non if the arms
that's represent the kinds of dramatic arm

525
00:36:21,151 --> 00:36:25,590
of the novel where followed, can give
us high human psychological drama.

526
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:30,900
Um, w when it comes to Lena,
he, when he gives us is,

527
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:31,410
um,

528
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:36,410
kind of very small upheavals on
one is basic way of level platform,

529
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,790
but even on that very level of iPhone,
um,

530
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,880
their mile upheavals and it has to do
with the switch ability between the lady

531
00:36:45,991 --> 00:36:46,890
and the mundane.

532
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:51,360
So she seems to museum
on the mountain road.

533
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:56,450
Why the slow spitting and squatting and
watch her coach Lee believing that she

534
00:36:57,721 --> 00:37:02,721
is thinking about the man and the
approaching crisis when in reality she is

535
00:37:03,121 --> 00:37:08,121
waging of mile battle with a prudential
caution of the earth of and with and by

536
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:13,890
which she lives.
This time she conquers,

537
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:18,120
she rises and walking Alo
awkwardly though carefully,

538
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:23,420
she traverses to rank battery of
man eyes and to see the store,

539
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:26,400
the Clo following,
I'm going to do it.

540
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:31,790
She thinks even ordering the cheese and
crackers and go into it saying allow and

541
00:37:32,181 --> 00:37:34,900
a box of sardines she
caught themselves means.

542
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:42,110
So this is the essence of the drama
and the to be or not to be over in this

543
00:37:45,361 --> 00:37:50,350
case, to do, not to do the,
to do or not to do, uh,

544
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,600
in Lenas consciousness revolves
around Abbas of Saturdays.

545
00:37:55,140 --> 00:38:00,140
And that is completely okay for Faulkner
qualifies were to be the protagonists

546
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:05,410
of his novel.

547
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,440
So we really have to give some thought
to what it is that entitles a person to

548
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:16,860
be the protagonist of the novel.
We know that in Greek tragedy,

549
00:38:16,861 --> 00:38:21,861
a person that has to be noble and it's
to have a very drastic downfall in all of

550
00:38:22,411 --> 00:38:25,850
the power of art to be the
hero of the tragedy. Um,

551
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:30,570
and the modern comic novel,
nothing like that, just very,

552
00:38:30,571 --> 00:38:35,100
very minor upheaval is okay. So, um,

553
00:38:35,340 --> 00:38:40,340
[inaudible] I think that is because of
that very level platform because of that

554
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,650
basic,

555
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:46,650
very reliable continuum that is uh,

556
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:50,320
backed up, supported, uh,

557
00:38:50,350 --> 00:38:54,340
by the kindness of strangers is
because of that continuum that we can,

558
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:59,260
a really interesting thing
with the practice and kind
of a stylistic take almost.

559
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:02,980
Um, in this particular
novel there was maybe some,

560
00:39:03,070 --> 00:39:05,290
we've seen a little bit of
that and the other novels,

561
00:39:05,291 --> 00:39:08,350
but this novel is really pronounced,
um,

562
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,480
has to do with the use of germs,

563
00:39:10,481 --> 00:39:13,420
especially turning verbs into nouns.

564
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:16,450
We've seen a little bit of
that earlier in the passage,

565
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:19,630
but here it becomes this
in the fall foreground. Um,

566
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:23,230
that far within my
hearing before my seeing,

567
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:28,740
I will be writing within the hearing of
Lucas Bush before he seeing who would

568
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:31,030
hear wagon but he won't know.

569
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:36,630
So there will be one within his hearing
before he's seeing and then he was

570
00:39:36,631 --> 00:39:38,560
seeing me and he will be excited.

571
00:39:39,100 --> 00:39:43,750
And so there will be two within this
thing before he is normally highly

572
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:48,340
stylized. Um, basically there's
no way we can not know this.

573
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:53,240
The fact that the verbs, I mean
users now in this instance. Um,

574
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:58,180
so the way that we can maybe try
to make sense of it, it's very,

575
00:39:58,250 --> 00:39:59,083
um,

576
00:39:59,350 --> 00:40:04,350
self conscious practice on thoughtless
apart is by noticing how different an

577
00:40:05,380 --> 00:40:09,190
image of Lucas Bush
we're getting from Lena.

578
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,230
How different from the image that we've
been getting just a moment ago? Uh, no,

579
00:40:14,231 --> 00:40:16,600
actually just a moment later, um, from,

580
00:40:16,630 --> 00:40:21,370
from Armstead answered knows exactly
what Lucas is doing is running away from

581
00:40:21,371 --> 00:40:22,330
her.
Um,

582
00:40:22,510 --> 00:40:25,900
it's just really unlucky that he hasn't
put the Mississippi River road between

583
00:40:25,901 --> 00:40:27,880
himself and his woman.
Um,

584
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:33,000
so onset is a completely
accurate that noses and portrait.

585
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:36,610
What kind of a man Lukas brewers is.

586
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:42,300
Lina has a completely unrealistic out
of touch with reality or trade of Lucas.

587
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:49,870
She thinks that he'll be very glad to
see her and the he'll be excited and in

588
00:40:49,871 --> 00:40:53,500
fact, it's not just one person
who's coming but tube. Um,

589
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:59,040
and so in many ways what Faulkner is
giving us in this very stylized linguistic

590
00:40:59,951 --> 00:41:04,951
practice is to create a kind of
link it linguistic cocoon around,

591
00:41:05,790 --> 00:41:06,220
uh,

592
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:11,220
Lena that cheers insulated by this an
idiomatic use of English just as she was

593
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:19,350
insulated by an interpretation of reality
that really has very little to do with

594
00:41:21,761 --> 00:41:25,330
the reality would be truth
about Lucas Bert. Um,

595
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:30,460
it is very much a kind of linguistic
shelter in which she can afford to keep on

596
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,830
thinking in this way about the man
who keeps running away from her.

597
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,430
Um,
and this is why she can afford.

598
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:45,460
And why can't she be continued to
be completely unworried on anxious,

599
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:51,750
um, about her pregnancy that
that is just not, this is why,

600
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:56,180
how she can have war, she can prevent
that from becoming a burden on her.

601
00:41:56,780 --> 00:42:01,430
Um, so we can think of this
as one element, you know,

602
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,680
color,
um,

603
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,840
as various authors do intervene to
make certain things possible for one

604
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:11,000
character that will not be
possible for other characters.

605
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,060
And this particular intervention they
use of is one stylistic device to make

606
00:42:17,511 --> 00:42:22,220
sure that Lena is preserved in
a state of constant wellbeing.

607
00:42:22,910 --> 00:42:25,850
So, um, there and,

608
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:30,880
but he's also clearly enough to know
that she really is completely dead wrong

609
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:34,520
about Lucas boat. So, um, this is, sorry,

610
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:38,330
fast forwarding to have much later moment.
Um,

611
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,010
but this is just to um,

612
00:42:40,190 --> 00:42:45,070
bring Faulkner into a discussion
that we've been having
all through the semester,

613
00:42:45,110 --> 00:42:49,660
which is about types, right? Weather,
um, certain people, characters,

614
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:54,170
um, can be classified, they'd
be allowed to broader groups,

615
00:42:54,230 --> 00:42:57,020
they are groups that have labels.
Um,

616
00:42:57,050 --> 00:43:01,110
so it turns out that he's also a
quite conscious of the fact that uh,

617
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:05,080
Lucas Bird Ashley is now
so much and individual, um,

618
00:43:05,270 --> 00:43:10,130
as a type a type of man. Um, and he,

619
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,790
this is his commentary. Uh, oh,

620
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:16,850
this was actually hide how has gotten
a drink but is as good as farmers. Um,

621
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,000
commentary on the fate of Lena
growth for the Lena grows.

622
00:43:22,370 --> 00:43:27,370
There are always two men in the
world and the number is lesion.

623
00:43:28,250 --> 00:43:31,380
Lucas, Burgess and
Byron bunches, you know,

624
00:43:31,570 --> 00:43:34,250
all of them has suddenly
appearing and thorough.

625
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:37,500
So the other roof herself is a type,
they,

626
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:42,530
the Lena rose off the world and then
they Lucas Burgess and burn bunches.

627
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:48,910
And this is really once say's Lena is
that she actually is one of the Lena rose

628
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:55,070
and her faith, um, is to
be unlucky in one sense.

629
00:43:55,071 --> 00:43:57,470
And that she's stuck with
a male like Lukas boroughs.

630
00:43:58,430 --> 00:44:01,820
But she's lucky in the sense
that you can just know,

631
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:06,860
I mean it's almost a kind of statistical
point that to every Lucas bird there

632
00:44:07,641 --> 00:44:12,190
will be a Byron bunch, will
take care of her. So you know,

633
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,200
she was saving this way that there always
be the parent of two kinds of men in

634
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:20,780
her life. Um, so here is, you know,

635
00:44:20,781 --> 00:44:24,860
the allegory thick and fast, um, Beverly,

636
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:29,920
very heavy handed and meant to
be noted as Byron Lebaron do,

637
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:34,710
you know, romantic poet. Um,

638
00:44:34,770 --> 00:44:37,650
and with the added little joke,

639
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,680
I think he actually died and missile
lonely Italy has some reference to,

640
00:44:43,650 --> 00:44:46,230
has some affinity to Mississippi as well.

641
00:44:46,230 --> 00:44:51,150
And she would not be on and to thing
that there's a nice connection. Um, so,

642
00:44:51,210 --> 00:44:56,040
um, it, um, the, so, so
here's Byron, you know,

643
00:44:56,070 --> 00:44:59,660
being the namesake for apparently button,
um,

644
00:44:59,730 --> 00:45:04,280
and sure enough he lives up
to his namesake, the, the,

645
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:08,970
the romanticism of his namesake.
Um, then baron fell in love.

646
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:14,390
He fell in love country to honor
tradition off his osteon jealous country

647
00:45:14,761 --> 00:45:18,630
raising, which demands in the
object physical inviolability.

648
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:24,170
It happens on a Saturday afternoon while
he was alone at the no two miles away,

649
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,060
the house was still burning.

650
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:32,130
Two yellows smoke standing straight
as a monument on the horizon.

651
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:37,560
They side before noon when the smoke
first rose about the trees before the

652
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:40,050
whistle blew.
And the oldest department,

653
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,960
I reckon Barron could do today,

654
00:45:43,110 --> 00:45:46,860
they said with a free five to watch,

655
00:45:47,890 --> 00:45:52,890
um, the switch ability
is in high gear in here.

656
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:58,050
It starts out with Barron falling in love,
but that

657
00:46:00,090 --> 00:46:05,090
romantic side of the story doesn't even
get to control the entire paragraph.

658
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:12,250
Um, basically it just
gets two sentences. Um,

659
00:46:12,450 --> 00:46:16,980
and then the rest of the paragraph
is taken over by something like that.

660
00:46:16,981 --> 00:46:20,430
It says nothing to do with romantic love.

661
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,740
And all of a sudden we realized that yes,

662
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:28,070
Byron is falling in love
at the same time as a very,

663
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:33,010
you know, that's dramatic
enough of this life. Um,

664
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:38,090
but this drama parent's life
is taking pot with a drama.

665
00:46:38,491 --> 00:46:43,110
There's going to overtake the entire time,
which is the burning of a house.

666
00:46:43,470 --> 00:46:44,840
Um,
and it's,

667
00:46:44,841 --> 00:46:49,350
there's something and we also getting
another glimpse of what kind of people are

668
00:46:49,351 --> 00:46:51,040
living in this town.
Um,

669
00:46:51,090 --> 00:46:54,930
in the reference to
the free fire to watch.

670
00:46:54,990 --> 00:46:59,990
This is not the strangers who are kind
to other strangers is a very different

671
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:04,080
poetry of the local community. So, um,

672
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:08,530
it turns out that Byron is not the only
person who has another core and call

673
00:47:08,531 --> 00:47:12,660
names, but, and now you character, he does
as well. It's a big fire and other side.

674
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:13,710
What can they be?

675
00:47:13,710 --> 00:47:18,120
I don't remember anything coming up that
way big enough to make all that smoke

676
00:47:18,150 --> 00:47:22,080
except the burden house. Maybe that's
what it is. And then they said,

677
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:27,320
my pappy says he can remember how 50 years
ago folks said it ought to be burned.

678
00:47:29,110 --> 00:47:33,190
And with a little human
fat man to start good.

679
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,890
Maybe you'll happens to the dock
there instead of fire with those,

680
00:47:37,891 --> 00:47:38,950
then they laugh.

681
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:44,160
So this is the other are going to name
is that buyer is always going to be here

682
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:48,880
with someone whose name
is burden and burden.

683
00:47:49,060 --> 00:47:51,370
Why is not,
as you know,

684
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:55,430
there's no Byron I'm two clues and uh,

685
00:47:55,480 --> 00:48:00,480
there's actually a very famous poem that
was sudden suggest to us the origins of

686
00:48:00,761 --> 00:48:02,350
that name Kipling's poem,

687
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:07,380
White Man's burden and take out the
white man's burden and leap is Ole reward

688
00:48:08,210 --> 00:48:10,210
the blame of those eat better.

689
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:14,530
The hate of leave of those you got,

690
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:18,760
I think we've a completely misguided
wrong headed notion as Waco.

691
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:24,030
Kipling's white man's burden is not really
about how great it is to take up the

692
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:25,331
white man's burden,

693
00:48:25,331 --> 00:48:30,331
but how awful it is and that you
incur the hatred of lost of people.

694
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,420
Um, so this is what, um, the,

695
00:48:34,510 --> 00:48:39,510
what the elk oracle names of how they
function in light in August and how

696
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:45,240
farmers really updating the old classic
story is that it really is the story

697
00:48:47,590 --> 00:48:52,590
about the fate of someone call Byron
and the fate of someone call burden.

698
00:48:53,561 --> 00:48:56,810
And obviously there are
other characters who, uh,

699
00:48:57,330 --> 00:49:02,050
invoke through those two characters,
but they're both on fire.

700
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,170
Baron is on fire because
it's falling in love.

701
00:49:05,460 --> 00:49:10,300
Join the [inaudible] naturally is on
fire and as she's being burned alive,

702
00:49:10,330 --> 00:49:12,790
oh no, she's dead. But
at that point, but, um,

703
00:49:13,870 --> 00:49:18,130
she's on fire by itself. So, um, she's,

704
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:22,870
that is also a contribution
to the lighting and all this.

705
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,900
And that's why the
other alternative title,

706
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,460
dark house is business improved really.
