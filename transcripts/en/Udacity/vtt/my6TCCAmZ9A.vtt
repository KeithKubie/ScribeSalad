00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.370
Let's do a quick review of all the steps
needed to add Android Auto Messaging

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.900
to an app.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.937
The first is to edit
AndroidManifest.xml.

00:00:07.937 --> 00:00:10.880
Then create automotive_app_desc.xml.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.065
Add the support library to
your build.gradle file.

00:00:14.065 --> 00:00:16.805
Add read and replied intent filters.

00:00:16.805 --> 00:00:19.495
Add PendingIntents for
read and reply actions.

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:21.185
Add an unread conversation.

00:00:21.185 --> 00:00:22.425
Add a CarExtender.

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.005
Make sure you use
NotificationManagerCompat and

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:27.445
not the framework notification manager.

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:29.735
And finally test it all using
the Messaging Simulator.

00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:30.945
And that's it, we're done.
