00:00:06.915 --> 00:00:08.824
Here's a conundrum:

00:00:08.824 --> 00:00:11.970
identical twins originate 
from the same DNA,

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.323
so how can they turn out so different

00:00:14.323 --> 00:00:17.816
even in traits that have a significant
genetic component?

00:00:17.816 --> 00:00:21.792
For instance, why might one twin
get heart disease at 55,

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:25.377
while her sister runs marathons
in perfect health?

00:00:25.377 --> 00:00:27.889
Nature versus nurture 
has a lot to do with it,

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:33.131
but a deeper related answer can be found
within something called epigenetics.

00:00:33.131 --> 00:00:35.719
That's the study of how DNA interacts

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.187
with the multitude of smaller molecules
found within cells,

00:00:39.187 --> 00:00:43.291
which can activate and deactivate genes.

00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:45.572
If you think of DNA as a recipe book,

00:00:45.572 --> 00:00:49.697
those molecules are largely what determine
what gets cooked when.

00:00:49.697 --> 00:00:53.692
They aren't making any conscious 
choices themselves,

00:00:53.692 --> 00:00:58.388
rather their presence and concentration
within cells makes the difference.

00:00:58.388 --> 00:01:00.099
So how does that work?

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:05.645
Genes in DNA are expressed when they're
read and transcribed into RNA,

00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:10.579
which is translated into proteins
by structures called ribosomes.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:15.256
And proteins are much of what determines
a cell's characteristics and function.

00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:21.752
Epigenetic changes can boost or interfere
with the transcription of specific genes.

00:01:21.752 --> 00:01:25.001
The most common way interference happens
is that DNA,

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:27.252
or the proteins it's wrapped around,

00:01:27.252 --> 00:01:30.100
gets labeled with small chemical tags.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.665
The set of all of the chemical tags
that are attached to the genome

00:01:33.665 --> 00:01:35.037
of a given cell

00:01:35.037 --> 00:01:37.442
is called the epigenome.

00:01:37.442 --> 00:01:41.508
Some of these, like a methyl group,
inhibit gene expression

00:01:41.508 --> 00:01:44.316
by derailing the cellular 
transcription machinery

00:01:44.316 --> 00:01:48.002
or causing the DNA to coil more tightly,

00:01:48.002 --> 00:01:49.694
making it inaccessible.

00:01:49.694 --> 00:01:52.788
The gene is still there, but it's silent.

00:01:52.788 --> 00:01:55.729
Boosting transcription is essentially
the opposite.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.828
Some chemical tags will unwind the DNA,
making it easier to transcribe,

00:02:00.828 --> 00:02:04.507
which ramps up production
of the associated protein.

00:02:04.507 --> 00:02:07.788
Epigenetic changes can survive
cell division,

00:02:07.788 --> 00:02:11.827
which means they could affect
an organism for its entire life.

00:02:11.827 --> 00:02:13.634
Sometimes that's a good thing.

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:16.377
Epigenetic changes are part 
of normal development.

00:02:16.377 --> 00:02:19.639
The cells in an embryo start
with one master genome.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:22.486
As the cells divide,
some genes are activated

00:02:22.486 --> 00:02:24.423
and others inhibited.

00:02:24.423 --> 00:02:27.187
Over time, through this epigenetic
reprogramming,

00:02:27.187 --> 00:02:29.447
some cells develop into heart cells,

00:02:29.447 --> 00:02:31.629
and others into liver cells.

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.799
Each of the approximately 200
cell types in your body

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:37.064
has essentially the same genome

00:02:37.064 --> 00:02:39.866
but its own distinct epigenome.

00:02:39.866 --> 00:02:43.170
The epigenome also mediates 
a lifelong dialogue

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.914
between genes and the environment.

00:02:45.914 --> 00:02:48.938
The chemical tags that 
turn genes on and off

00:02:48.938 --> 00:02:51.598
can be influenced by factors 
including diet,

00:02:51.598 --> 00:02:52.970
chemical exposure,

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.971
and medication.

00:02:54.971 --> 00:02:58.754
The resulting epigenetic changes
can eventually lead to disease,

00:02:58.754 --> 00:03:04.324
if, for example, they turn off a gene
that makes a tumor-suppressing protein.

00:03:04.324 --> 00:03:07.846
Environmentally-induced epigenetic
changes are part of the reason

00:03:07.846 --> 00:03:13.101
why genetically identical twins
can grow up to have very different lives.

00:03:13.101 --> 00:03:16.382
As twins get older, 
their epigenomes diverge,

00:03:16.382 --> 00:03:20.820
affecting the way they age
and their susceptibility to disease.

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.628
Even social experiences can cause
epigenetic changes.

00:03:24.628 --> 00:03:26.378
In one famous experiment,

00:03:26.378 --> 00:03:29.578
when mother rats weren't attentive
enough to their pups,

00:03:29.578 --> 00:03:34.034
genes in the babies that helped them
manage stress were methylated

00:03:34.034 --> 00:03:36.067
and turned off.

00:03:36.067 --> 00:03:38.565
And it might not stop 
with that generation.

00:03:38.565 --> 00:03:43.252
Most epigenetic marks are erased
when egg and sperm cells are formed.

00:03:43.252 --> 00:03:47.783
But now researchers think that some
of those imprints survive,

00:03:47.783 --> 00:03:51.751
passing those epigenetic traits
on to the next generation.

00:03:51.751 --> 00:03:55.098
Your mother's or your father's
experiences as a child,

00:03:55.098 --> 00:03:57.064
or choices as adults,

00:03:57.064 --> 00:04:00.073
could actually shape your own epigenome.

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:02.573
But even though epigenetic changes
are sticky,

00:04:02.573 --> 00:04:04.879
they're not necessarily permanent.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.638
A balanced lifestyle that includes
a healthy diet,

00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:08.782
exercise,

00:04:08.782 --> 00:04:10.914
and avoiding exposure to contaminants

00:04:10.914 --> 00:04:14.630
may in the long run 
create a healthy epigenome.

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.696
It's an exciting time to be studying this.

00:04:17.696 --> 00:04:19.785
Scientists are just beginning 
to understand

00:04:19.785 --> 00:04:24.632
how epigenetics could explain mechanisms
of human development and aging,

00:04:24.632 --> 00:04:26.469
as well as the origins of cancer,

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:27.599
heart disease,

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:28.750
mental illness,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.721
addiction,

00:04:29.721 --> 00:04:31.502
and many other conditions.

00:04:31.502 --> 00:04:35.632
Meanwhile, new genome editing
techniques are making it much easier

00:04:35.632 --> 00:04:40.574
to identify which epigenetic changes
really matter for health and disease.

00:04:40.574 --> 00:04:44.218
Once we understand how our epigenome
influences us,

00:04:44.218 --> 00:04:46.915
we might be able to influence it, too.
