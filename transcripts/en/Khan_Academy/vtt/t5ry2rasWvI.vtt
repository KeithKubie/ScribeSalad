00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.220
So let's think
about the graph of y

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.115
is equal to the
principal root of x.

00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:06.990
And then we'll start
playing around with this

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.070
and see what happens
to the graph.

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:11.210
So y is equal to the
principal root of x.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:12.770
Well, this is going
to be undefined

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:15.500
if we want to deal
with real numbers.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.820
For x being any negative value.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.420
So the domain here is really x
is greater than or equal to 0.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.800
When x is 0, y is
going to be equal to 0.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.230
When x is 1, the principal
root of 1 is positive 1.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.830
So it's going to be like that.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.800
When x is 4, the
principal root of 4 is 2.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.810
When x is 9, the
principal root of 9 is 3.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.470
So this is what it is
going to look like.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.630
Which is going to
look more like this.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.690
So it's going to look
something like that.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.820
That's my best attempt
at actually graphing it.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.460
Now let's think
about what happens

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.110
if we wanted to
shift it in some way.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.680
So let's say we
wanted to shift it up.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.720
Let's say we wanted
to shift it up by 4.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.904
So how would we do that?

00:01:04.904 --> 00:01:06.570
Well, whatever value
we're getting here,

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.960
we want y to be 4 higher.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.170
So we could just add 4 to it.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:18.730
So we could just use y is equal
to the square root of x plus 4.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.890
So that would be like taking
this graph right over here.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.834
So let me copy and
then let me paste it.

00:01:24.834 --> 00:01:26.500
So it's like taking
this graph and we're

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.310
shifting it up 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.320
It would look that.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.150
Well, that was pretty
straightforward.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.650
Let me do it in
that same blue color

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.755
so that you
recognize that that's

00:01:39.755 --> 00:01:42.440
that one right over there.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.410
But what if we wanted to shift
it, let's say, to the left.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.240
Let's say we wanted to
do something like this.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.190
Let's say we wanted to
shift it to the left by 3.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.410
Like that.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.180
So how would we define
the function then?

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.740
And I'll do this in
this orange color.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.190
We want to shift by 3.

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.070
So you're shifting
to the left by 3.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.640
So think about it.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.250
This point, y equaled
0, right over here,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.600
where whatever you put under
the radical was equal to 0.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.140
So what do you have to put
under the radical here to get 0?

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.660
Well, here x is negative 3.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.760
So if you put x plus
3 under the radical

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.590
then you are going to get--
and you take the square root

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.180
of that-- you're going to get 0.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.000
So this right over here, this
orange function, that is y.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.530
Let me do it over here. y
is equal to the square root

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.965
of x plus 3.

00:02:47.965 --> 00:02:49.840
And once again it might
be counter-intuitive.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.900
We went from square root of
x to square root of x plus 3.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.080
When we added 4 outside of the
radical that shifted it up.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.736
But when we add 3
inside of the radical

00:03:00.736 --> 00:03:02.360
instead of it shifting
it to the right,

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.970
instead of shifting it that
way, it shifted it to the left.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:08.330
It made this point go
from 0 to negative 3.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:09.830
And the important
thing to realize

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.500
is what makes y equal to 0.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.340
Over here y equals
0 when x is 0.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.810
Over here and over
here, y is equal to 0

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.990
when x plus 3 is equal to 0,
or x is equal to negative 3.

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.720
And you could do
that for other points

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.332
to see that it does
definitely shift to the left.

00:03:27.332 --> 00:03:29.040
And that's an important
thing to realize.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.998
This isn't actually just
for radical functions.

00:03:30.998 --> 00:03:32.837
This is actually for
functions in general.

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:34.920
If you're just going to
add a 4-- add a number out

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:38.000
here-- whatever you add is
going to shift it up or down.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.540
If this was a minus 4 it
would have shifted it down.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.970
But within, when you
replace the x with an x

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.510
plus 3, when you replace
it with an x plus 3,

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.840
this actually shifted
it to the left by 3.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.680
If you wanted to shift
it to the right by 3

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:56.020
you would put an x
minus 3 over there.

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.740
Well, that's all interesting.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.400
But let's say that I wanted
to flip this thing over.

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.454
So I wanted it to
look like this.

00:04:04.454 --> 00:04:05.620
Let me see if I can draw it.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:11.550
I want this graph to
look something like that.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.519
I'll try my best to-- to
look something like that.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.300
So it's flipped around.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.440
I could do a better
job than that.

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.630
So we have that point on it.

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.570
And then we're going
to go 3 and then

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:29.112
we're going to have
that point on it.

00:04:29.112 --> 00:04:30.486
So I want it to
look-- actually I

00:04:30.486 --> 00:04:32.420
did a decent job the
first time I drew it--

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.100
I want to look
something like that.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.160
So essentially I want
to take its mirror image

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.260
around the line x is equal to 3.

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.210
How could I do that?

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.340
Well, now my domain
is different.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:48.560
Now my domain-- it should
be undefined for anything

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.960
where x is greater
than negative 3.

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.290
And it should be defined
for any x that is less than

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:57.527
or equal to negative 3.

00:04:57.527 --> 00:04:59.110
Or another way to
think about it is we

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.790
need to flip the
sign of whatever we

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:02.400
have under the radical.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.620
So this thing over here--
let me actually scroll over

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:10.870
a little bit-- this
thing over here in green

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.170
could be y is equal
to the square root

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.800
of the negative of x plus 3.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.390
And I encourage you to try some
x values here to try it out.

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.380
What we've done is
we've essentially

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.290
flipped what happens
under the radical.

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:30.870
Now in order to get a positive
value under the radical,

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.680
now x plus 3 has to be negative.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.700
And the only way that
x plus 3 is negative,

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:41.130
or the only way
that x plus 3 is,

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.160
I guess you can
say nonpositive, is

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:48.042
if x is less than negative 3.

00:05:48.042 --> 00:05:50.000
Now what if we wanted to
do something even more

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:50.600
interesting?

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.700
What if we wanted to flip
this one right over here

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:00.880
over the horizontal
axis, over y equals 0?

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.880
Well, then we're just
flipping what root we take.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.560
So that would be y is equal
to the negative square root

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:10.380
of negative x plus 3.

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.670
So it would look like this.

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:18.565
It would look like that.

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:22.970
And if we wanted to
shift that thing,

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:25.420
we could just add or
subtract something outside

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:26.630
of the radical.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.770
So let's say we wanted to do--
let me copy and paste this.

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:36.560
So let's copy and
then let's see.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.780
Let's say that we wanted
to shift it down here.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.445
So instead of beginning at y
equals 0 right over here, where

00:06:41.445 --> 00:06:43.070
y equals negative 4,
then we would just

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.990
subtract 4 outside
of the radical.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.410
So this thing and this thing--
I'm running out of colors

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:52.940
here-- this thing
right over here

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:58.980
would be y is equal to negative
square root of negative x

00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:04.640
plus 3 minus 4.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.650
And so we could keep
going on and on and on.

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:08.150
But hopefully this
gives you a sense

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:10.730
of the different ways you
could manipulate this thing.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:12.510
And we'll do some
more examples to get

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.160
a better understanding of it.
