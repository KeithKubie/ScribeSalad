so there's a lot of discussion of what

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:07.810
so there's a lot of discussion of what
 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.900
so there's a lot of discussion of what
might life look like on other planets if

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910
might life look like on other planets if
 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.330
might life look like on other planets if
life has evolved there will diversify in

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340
life has evolved there will diversify in
 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.380
life has evolved there will diversify in
a way like the world today and there's a

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:16.390
a way like the world today and there's a
 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:17.609
a way like the world today and there's a
lot of speculation about that question

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619
lot of speculation about that question
 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.950
lot of speculation about that question
but we actually don't need to go to

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:19.960
but we actually don't need to go to
 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.290
but we actually don't need to go to
other planets to ask that question and

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300
other planets to ask that question and
 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.120
other planets to ask that question and
that's because there are different

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130
that's because there are different
 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.609
that's because there are different
places on earth that have had different

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:26.619
places on earth that have had different
 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.859
places on earth that have had different
evolutionary histories and so we can ask

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869
evolutionary histories and so we can ask
 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.810
evolutionary histories and so we can ask
on different places in the world has

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:30.820
on different places in the world has
 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:32.940
on different places in the world has
life evolved in the same way under

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950
life evolved in the same way under
 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:35.010
life evolved in the same way under
similar conditions and it turns out that

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020
similar conditions and it turns out that
 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.600
similar conditions and it turns out that
we're very well set for that because

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610
we're very well set for that because
 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.820
we're very well set for that because
there are isolated islands that have

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830
there are isolated islands that have
 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.220
there are isolated islands that have
been their own evolutionary theaters if

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230
been their own evolutionary theaters if
 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.930
been their own evolutionary theaters if
you will that life has evolved very

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940
you will that life has evolved very
 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.230
you will that life has evolved very
independently for a long time the best

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.240
independently for a long time the best
 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.090

example of that I think is New Zealand

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100
example of that I think is New Zealand
 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.850
example of that I think is New Zealand
now New Zealand broke off from Australia

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:50.860
now New Zealand broke off from Australia
 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.820
now New Zealand broke off from Australia
about 80 million years ago and this was

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:53.830
about 80 million years ago and this was
 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:56.550
about 80 million years ago and this was
before moderate most modern mammal

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:56.560
before moderate most modern mammal
 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.710
before moderate most modern mammal
groups had really diversified and in

00:00:58.710 --> 00:00:58.720
groups had really diversified and in
 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.770
groups had really diversified and in
fact today there are no native land

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780
fact today there are no native land
 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.350
fact today there are no native land
mammals on New Zealand there are some

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360
mammals on New Zealand there are some
 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.060
mammals on New Zealand there are some
seals that come ashore on the beach

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070
seals that come ashore on the beach
 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.859
seals that come ashore on the beach
there are few species of bats but there

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869
there are few species of bats but there
 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:09.749
there are few species of bats but there
are no rodents there are no carnivores

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759
are no rodents there are no carnivores
 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:11.580
are no rodents there are no carnivores
and so on except the ones that humans

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590
and so on except the ones that humans
 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.289
and so on except the ones that humans
have introduced in the last couple

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299
have introduced in the last couple
 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:15.719
have introduced in the last couple
hundred years so the question is how did

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729
hundred years so the question is how did
 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.849
hundred years so the question is how did
New Zealand evolve in the absence of

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859
New Zealand evolve in the absence of
 

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.639
New Zealand evolve in the absence of
land mammals well it turns out that

00:01:20.639 --> 00:01:20.649
land mammals well it turns out that
 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:23.099
land mammals well it turns out that
birds in particular have taken advantage

00:01:23.099 --> 00:01:23.109
birds in particular have taken advantage
 

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:24.899
birds in particular have taken advantage
of that and they've evolved to do many

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909
of that and they've evolved to do many
 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:26.550
of that and they've evolved to do many
of the things that mammals do elsewhere

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560
of the things that mammals do elsewhere
 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.709
of the things that mammals do elsewhere
in the world and there are carnivores

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719
in the world and there are carnivores
 

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:30.569
in the world and there are carnivores
and herbivores and all kinds of birds

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579
and herbivores and all kinds of birds
 

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.489
and herbivores and all kinds of birds
now if we thought that evolution is

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:32.499
now if we thought that evolution is
 

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:34.649
now if we thought that evolution is
deterministic then we would expect New

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659
deterministic then we would expect New
 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.899

birds to have species very similar to

birds to have species very similar to
those elsewhere in the world but that's

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:43.440

not at all the case the best example is
