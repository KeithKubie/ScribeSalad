you're<00:05:02.560><c> blind</c><00:05:02.860><c> to</c><00:05:02.980><c> your</c><00:05:03.100><c> own</c><00:05:03.510><c> weaknesses</c><00:05:04.510><c> but</c>

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
you're blind to your own weaknesses but
 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
you're blind to your own weaknesses but
you're<00:05:04.840><c> also</c><00:05:05.110><c> blind</c><00:05:05.290><c> to</c><00:05:05.500><c> your</c><00:05:05.590><c> own</c><00:05:05.680><c> strengths</c>

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:06.190 align:start position:0%
you're also blind to your own strengths

you're also blind to your own strengths
and<00:05:06.610><c> so</c><00:05:07.210><c> then</c><00:05:07.360><c> I</c><00:05:07.390><c> think</c><00:05:07.690><c> well</c><00:05:07.870><c> if</c><00:05:08.200><c> you've</c><00:05:08.440><c> got</c>

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 align:start position:0%
and so then I think well if you've got
 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.930 align:start position:0%
and so then I think well if you've got
your<00:05:08.800><c> act</c><00:05:08.920><c> together</c><00:05:09.070><c> it'd</c><00:05:09.310><c> be</c><00:05:09.400><c> better</c><00:05:09.580><c> for</c><00:05:09.790><c> you</c>

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 align:start position:0%
your act together it'd be better for you
 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:11.640 align:start position:0%

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 align:start position:0%
and instantly it would be better for
 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.210 align:start position:0%
and instantly it would be better for

then<00:05:16.600><c> it</c><00:05:16.690><c> would</c><00:05:16.780><c> be</c><00:05:16.900><c> better</c><00:05:17.050><c> for</c><00:05:17.290><c> the</c>

so<00:05:50.460><c> maybe</c><00:05:51.460><c> you</c><00:05:51.640><c> could</c><00:05:51.820><c> sort</c><00:05:52.630><c> yourself</c><00:05:52.930><c> out</c><00:05:53.080><c> so</c>

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 align:start position:0%
so maybe you could sort yourself out so
 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:55.910 align:start position:0%
so maybe you could sort yourself out so
that<00:05:53.500><c> you</c><00:05:53.590><c> wanted</c><00:05:53.950><c> nothing</c><00:05:54.160><c> but</c><00:05:54.400><c> the</c><00:05:54.730><c> good</c><00:05:54.910><c> and</c>

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
that you wanted nothing but the good and

that you wanted nothing but the good and
