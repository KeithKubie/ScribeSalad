00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.280
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS: I have
to start, obviously, by

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.370
addressing a basic question.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.670
Which is, why should anybody
care about a dead company

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:14.800
called Polaroid?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.540
I should say up front that
they're not exactly dead.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.340
It still exists in a very
different form.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:21.635
And we'll get to
that later on.

00:00:21.635 --> 00:00:25.080
But it is certainly diminished
from its glory days.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.250
The product on which Polaroid's
fortunes were built

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.470
was analog instant
photography.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.000
And it has gone from mass
medium to a curio.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.660
After all, everybody in
this room, I'm sure,

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.110
owns a digital camera.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.150
You probably have one on your
smartphone that's better than

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.810
the cameras you grew up with.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.630
If you have a Polaroid camera,
it's in the closet somewhere,

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:52.030
and you use rarely, if ever.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.910
I carry one everywhere
and use it every day.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.890
But that's me, I recognize.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.430
Polaroid stopped making
film in 2008.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.680
And although other manufacturers
are still in the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.460
game, nobody is going around
saying that's the future of

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.020
photography, as people were
as recently as the 1980s.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.710
In the late '70s, there were a
billion Polaroid photos shot

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.420
every year.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:23.060
And now, as a form, it's almost
gone, for the simple

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.180
reason, of course, that digital

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.340
pictures are instant pictures.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.310
The chief advance of Polaroid
photography was that you saw

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.180
what you'd done right away,
or nearly right away.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.600
If a photo was overexposed, or
blurry, or otherwise flawed,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.700
you could shoot it again while
you were in the moment.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.440
With a digital camera, you do
that essentially for free.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.580
And anyone who's old enough to
have grown up in the film era

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.570
knows quite what a serious
learning curve you had when

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.730
you were learning to
take pictures.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:58.465
You shoot off your 24 exposures
of 36, you drop it

00:01:58.465 --> 00:02:00.450
in an envelope, you take them
off, you get them back two

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.560
days later.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.350
If the roll's blank, or it's too
light, or it's too dark,

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.940
you had no real memory
of what you'd done.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.880
All that's erased.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.160
And that's mostly
a good thing.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.090
Somehow, though, digital
pictures do not quite do the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.600
same thing that Polaroid
pictures did, in terms of

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.260
drawing people together.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.880
Although we all exchange photos
all the time on our

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.040
phones and on Facebook and
Instagram and Twitter and all

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:36.480
the rest, something special
happens when you take out one

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.670
of these cameras in a social
setting, like at a party.

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.600
I often bring mine.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.730
And the questions start right
away, partly because it's old

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.060
and weird-looking, but also
because when the pictures

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.560
start coming out, they are
shared as objects rather than

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.310
as streams.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.630
And because there's a physical
print in your hand, there's a

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.440
certain little social exchange
that appears.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.210
People start asking you, hey,
how does that work?

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.610
And then when they see the
pictures, they often say,

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:12.880
that's better than I remember,
because many people remember

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.590
Polaroid photography as
rather low quality.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.450
They're wrong, and we'll get
to that shortly as well.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.650
Most of all, the slight delay
to let the photo develop

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.840
creates a moment.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.260
And it's a little hard
to describe.

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.370
But I can guarantee you'll
see it happen.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.870
The photo ejects from
the camera.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.660
You pull the tab out,
in the older styles.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.480
And while it's developing, while
it's steeping, you talk

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.410
to the person you took
a picture of.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.720
If it's a kid, they've
never seen it

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.050
before, and they're curious.

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.490
And they will stare at
the picture as it

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:55.290
comes out of the murk.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.820
If it's their parents who are
interested, they'll talk about

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.950
the camera they grew up with.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.640
You have a little exchange.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.500
I can't tell you how many
friends I've made this way.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.510
We have a little kid at home.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.730
He's three.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.520
And I often take his picture
at the playground, and the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.300
other parents invariably get
involved, because their kids

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.040
come over and wonder what
this crazy thing I'm

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.180
carrying around is.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.100
And so you chat with
the parents.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:18.610
The kids play with each other.

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:20.990
And then at the end, because
the photo is a physical

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:23.030
object, it's handed
over as a gift.

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.820
And that little exchange, the
social stuff followed by the

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:31.110
little present, is like
nothing else.

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:34.320
Polaroid used to have a slogan
back in the '60s for one of

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.780
its inexpensive models that
was advertised on TV.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.700
The jingle went, "it's more
than a camera, it's almost

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.180
alive." And there is something
to that, although it's

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.430
extremely hyperbolic.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.580
Polaroid, in its heyday, was a
company whose founders really

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:57.110
believed in that kind of
pure social moment.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.830
They were not a company that
just made cameras and film.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.040
They were really a place
about inventing things.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.420
It was an idea factory.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.620
There's a new book about Bell
Labs called "The Idea

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:12.290
Factory." And Polaroid worked
much the same way.

00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.950
It was almost like a university
chemistry

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.620
department, physics department,
or a think tank.

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.850
And periodically, it would
kick out a good idea that

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:25.410
would bring in a billion
dollars or so.

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.120
Its successors, I would say,
are not people who make

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:34.890
cameras like Nikon, but places
like this, Google, or Apple,

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.610
or other companies that really
are in the business of coming

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:41.160
up with things you didn't know
you wanted, then showing those

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.050
things to you, and making
you realize, I can't

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:45.300
live without this.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.810
That approach, and especially
the story of the founder of

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:56.450
Polaroid, which you're going to
hear about, will probably

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:57.810
remind you of someone.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.035
I bring up Apple deliberately
because-- and I'm hardly the

00:06:00.035 --> 00:06:01.520
first to point this out-- there
are really striking

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.980
similarities between
the two companies.

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.930
Both Polaroid and Apple were
built on the spot where

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.960
liberal arts meet
high technology.

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.860
Both had cultures that
really almost

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.590
fetishized industrial design.

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.720
They insisted on objects that
feel good in the hand, and

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.150
sort of demand that you pick
them up when you see them.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.480
And both were run by visionary,
demanding, genius,

00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:30.980
godhead figures, who were
idolized inside the company,

00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:33.700
and who drove their employees
to distraction in very

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.560
different ways.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:38.540
At Apple, we all know that
figure was Steve Jobs.

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:42.280
At Polaroid, it was a man named
Edwin Herbert Land.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.670
And there he is.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:48.750
Just as Apple stories all seem
to go back to Steve, Polaroid

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.580
stories all go back to Land.

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:56.100
In his time, he was as public
a figure as Jobs was.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:58.880
At Kodak, which was Polaroid's
chief competitor--

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.720
much larger, too-- they used to
refer to Polaroid as "he."

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.240
They'd say, what's
he doing next?

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:11.450
When Land introduced the
SX-70 camera in 1972--

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:14.330
that's the one we all think of
as a Polaroid picture, with

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:18.880
the wide white border with the
tab at the bottom that ejects

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:20.940
out the front of the camera
as it develops--

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:24.160
Land appeared on the covers of
"Time" and "Life" magazines,

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:26.080
three or four months apart.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:28.420
I don't know if anybody else
except the president has ever

00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:32.300
done that, certainly
not a chemist.

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:37.350
At his shareholders' meetings,
starting in the '60s, Land

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.300
began to introduce products in
a way that had never really

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.060
been seen before.

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:44.710
Shareholders' meetings back then
were, some guy would get

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.900
up with a spreadsheet and
read a few numbers

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:49.310
and then sit down.

00:07:49.310 --> 00:07:50.800
And everybody would go home.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.400
Land would hire an orchestra,
get in some art and artists.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.610
He would set up stages with
flair, and there'd be a

00:07:57.610 --> 00:07:59.512
presentation, and there'd be
stuff behind him, and there'd

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:02.000
be stuff to take pictures
of with the new cameras.

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.440
He turned it into a show.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.990
And 40 years later, I would say
Steve Jobs was doing very

00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.940
much the same thing.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:11.880
And that is not an accident.

00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.410
He was watching.

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.940
I will point out, as you look
at this, that not only are

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.690
they doing the same thing, but
they have the same table.

00:08:23.882 --> 00:08:25.840
AUDIENCE: Is that
an Eames table?

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.090
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS: Saarinen.

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.830
Land, starting in the 1960s--

00:08:33.830 --> 00:08:36.860
well, really starting in the
1940s, when Polaroid got going

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:38.110
in the photography business--

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.410
started thinking about the
future of photography.

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.660
And there is, from just about
the time of that photograph, a

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:50.360
film he made for one of these
shareholders' meetings.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:53.380
It was in 1970, and he stood in
an empty factory, that was

00:08:53.380 --> 00:08:56.810
just being completed and hadn't
been fitted out yet, to

00:08:56.810 --> 00:09:00.510
show people what the SX-70
was going to be.

00:09:00.510 --> 00:09:03.140
And he started talking about
the future of photography.

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.850
And it's uncanny.

00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:08.810
I can send you to the link
online, if anybody's

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.140
interested.

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:15.260
But what he says is, we're a
long way from the camera that

00:09:15.260 --> 00:09:17.320
will be with you all the time.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.455
That'll be something you use
every day, not when you go to

00:09:20.455 --> 00:09:22.510
visit your grandchildren, or
on the occasion of a party,

00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:26.830
but that you use constantly the
way you use a telephone.

00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:29.680
It'll be like your pencil,
or your eyeglasses.

00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.230
And then he says, this is what
I was picturing back in 1944.

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:35.430
It would be like a wallet.

00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:37.110
And he takes out a black
wallet, and he

00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:39.470
holds it up this way.

00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:44.340
And he said, and I had
this idea that it

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:46.000
would be like a wallet.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.030
And you'd just take it out,
you'd hold it up,

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.430
maybe open it, click.

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:51.540
And you'd have your picture.

00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:52.910
And he puts it back
in his pocket.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.540
And the gesture is so
uncannily familiar.

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.000
Especially the wallet's that
big, and it's black.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:59.530
And he holds it upright.

00:09:59.530 --> 00:10:01.660
It's eerie.

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:04.694
And 40 years later, you are
doing exactly what he said.

00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:10.680
I mentioned that this started in
the 1940s, but Polaroid is

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.490
an older company than that.

00:10:12.490 --> 00:10:15.570
It started in 1932 under a
different name, and became

00:10:15.570 --> 00:10:18.180
Polaroid in 1937.

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.280
And what they made had nothing
to do with photography, except

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.830
in the most peripheral way.

00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:22.820
I have an example here.

00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.250
What they were founded
on was an invention

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.990
called the sheet polarizer.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:29.460
Some of you may know
what that is.

00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.420
It's a light filter that Land
had actually invented when he

00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:37.370
was at Harvard as a 19-year-old
undergraduate.

00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:39.905
He dropped out of Harvard
to commercialize it.

00:10:39.905 --> 00:10:46.480
That's another parallel with
this guy, and with Gates and

00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:49.070
any number of tech entrepreneurs
who are moving

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.515
too fast for the undergraduate
curriculum and have an idea

00:10:51.515 --> 00:10:52.765
that's going to make
a lot of money.

00:10:56.320 --> 00:11:00.028
The polarizing filter
is essentially--

00:11:00.028 --> 00:11:01.950
well, here's how it works.

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:06.600
It's a thin sheet that filters
light so that all the rays are

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:08.640
in one dimension.

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.610
This is an oversimplification,
but it functions like a cone.

00:11:11.610 --> 00:11:15.840
The classic example is that if
a beam of light is a handful

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:17.960
of thrown straws,
the polarizing

00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:19.380
filter is a picket fence.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:21.430
And what comes out the other
side is only the ones that are

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:24.300
aligned with the pickets.

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:26.050
It is a slight
oversimplification, but it

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:26.980
does the job.

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.380
Anyway, it sounds somewhat
arcane, but

00:11:29.380 --> 00:11:30.150
it is anything but.

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.500
Because if you put two of
those filters together--

00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:33.870
is there a strong light here?

00:11:33.870 --> 00:11:34.790
I don't know if we can see.

00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.240
But some of you will be able
to see through the light.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:40.600
If you take two of them,
and you turn one

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.460
90 degrees, it blackens.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.770
And it's almost clear when
you have them aligned.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.300
So what you've made, because
it's adjustable, is a very

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.350
finely-controllable valve.

00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:52.660
And again, this may sound a
little arcane, but it has a

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.680
billion applications,
even more so back in

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:56.910
those analog days.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:01.410
It ends up in cameras, but it
also ends up in sunglasses.

00:12:01.410 --> 00:12:04.100
It ends up in bomb sites, which
were extremely valuable

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:05.500
during the Second World War.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.790
It ends up in a scheme that Land
almost got employed by

00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.850
Detroit, where every car
windshield has one filter, and

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:14.590
every headlight has
another filter.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.590
And you don't need high beams,
because when a car is coming

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:20.400
at you, the cross beams mean
you can't see the oncoming

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.590
headlights.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:24.070
It's actually a pretty good idea
that ought to have been

00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:25.950
employed and would still work.

00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.240
And they could do it for
$2 a car or something.

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:30.490
I'm in favor.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:38.130
Anyway, this was a small,
industrial company that got

00:12:38.130 --> 00:12:42.230
rather big during the
Second World War,

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:44.750
mostly making war material.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.400
And then it was going to have
to shrink away, because it

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:51.484
became evident, by 1944, that
the war was ending.

00:12:51.484 --> 00:12:54.610
And Land knew he had to either
fire people or come up with

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:55.700
another idea.

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.630
And fortunately, he had one
in his back pocket.

00:12:58.630 --> 00:13:00.310
This is the founding
myth of Polaroid.

00:13:00.310 --> 00:13:06.030
And Land once called it their
"apocryphal true story."

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:08.080
At the end of 1943, he was on
vacation with his daughter

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:11.780
Jennifer in Santa Fe.

00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:13.670
He spent the day taking pictures
of her as they walked

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:15.390
around the resort they
were staying at.

00:13:15.390 --> 00:13:19.320
And at the end of the evening,
in front of the fire, Jennifer

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:22.160
said, why can't I see
the pictures now?

00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.100
And Land said, well,
why can't you?

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:29.160
And as the story goes, he sent
Jennifer off to be with her

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.810
mother, and spent the rest of
the evening pacing the resort,

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.385
working his idea out.

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.920
He once said that he figured the
whole thing out in three

00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:42.620
hours, except for the details,
that took from

00:13:42.620 --> 00:13:47.480
1943 to 1972 to solve.

00:13:47.480 --> 00:13:50.310
And as soon as he got back to
Cambridge, Massachusetts--

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:54.210
which is where he had
started his company

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.460
after leaving Harvard--

00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.430
he started a little lab devoted
to this project.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.810
And it gradually began to drink
up the resources of the

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:08.090
company, as it became clear that
it was going to have to

00:14:08.090 --> 00:14:10.620
shrink a great deal if
he didn't get this

00:14:10.620 --> 00:14:12.560
thing off the ground.

00:14:12.560 --> 00:14:14.840
Gradually, the money stopped
coming in from the war, and

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.640
the money started going out
toward research and

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.180
development.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:21.680
So it was a rather
desperate gamble.

00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:22.700
And it paid off.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:27.550
In 1947, the first demonstration
in New York was

00:14:27.550 --> 00:14:28.896
just a sensation.

00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:38.090
He demonstrated his invention at
an optics convention at the

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:40.390
Hotel Pennsylvania
in New York.

00:14:40.390 --> 00:14:44.830
And it got a huge story in "The
New York Timess," plus an

00:14:44.830 --> 00:14:46.900
editorial that said, "there is
nothing like this in the

00:14:46.900 --> 00:14:50.510
history of photography." The
next week, he got a full page

00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:52.430
in "Life Magazine." Oh,
I meant to show you.

00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.130
That's the polarizing sunglasses
from earlier.

00:14:55.130 --> 00:14:57.970
It got a full page in
"Life Magazine," and

00:14:57.970 --> 00:14:59.220
that was the photo.

00:15:01.410 --> 00:15:04.900
It was a spectacular moment.

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.900
And within a very short
time, it was patented.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:14.470
There is the patent.

00:15:14.470 --> 00:15:17.290
And the product made its
debut the next year.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.310
It was a Jordan Marsh department
store in Boston,

00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.010
which was their big Macy's.

00:15:21.010 --> 00:15:23.260
In fact, it is a
big Macy's now.

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:26.330
And again, it was a sensation.

00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:28.810
It was introduced on what we
now call Black Friday--

00:15:28.810 --> 00:15:30.060
this week--

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.470
64 years ago.

00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:35.930
And they got stock in that they
thought would hold the

00:15:35.930 --> 00:15:39.270
store till Christmas, and it
was all gone by 5 o'clock,

00:15:39.270 --> 00:15:40.240
film and cameras.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:41.780
They even sold the demonstrator
camera that the

00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:43.860
photo department had.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.370
I can show it to you.

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:48.590
There is a photo for everyone.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:52.540
But this is what
it looked like.

00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.500
It is not the Polaroid camera
you remember, I'm sure.

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:59.730
It's a lot bigger and
a lot heavier.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:01.730
It weighs more than
four pounds.

00:16:01.730 --> 00:16:03.770
And it's a monster.

00:16:03.770 --> 00:16:05.990
It also didn't eject the photo
or anything like that.

00:16:05.990 --> 00:16:07.950
There was a very elaborate
system by which you had

00:16:07.950 --> 00:16:08.830
[INAUDIBLE].

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:13.350
You fired the shutter, then
you threw a switch.

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:15.875
Then you pulled the paper tab
out the back, and tore it off

00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:17.100
and threw it away.

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.530
And then you wait
your 60 seconds.

00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:21.030
And then you open this door
on the back, and you

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:23.110
peel out the picture.

00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:25.990
It was an elaborate
thing to use.

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:27.770
And it was a sensation,
all the same.

00:16:27.770 --> 00:16:29.860
Land had said, just before the
product introduction, that he

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:33.290
thought, well, we could sell
50,000 of these things.

00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:34.720
And the rest of the
company cringed.

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:37.510
They said, how are we going
to make all that film?

00:16:37.510 --> 00:16:39.910
And as it turns out, they sold--
of this model alone,

00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:40.550
over five years--

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:43.210
900,000 of them.

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:47.560
It was a phenomenon, starting in
the late '40s and into the

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.200
'50s and '60s.

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.400
It was even, I might add,
a witness to history.

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.740
It was such a ubiquitous
product.

00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:56.450
All over TV, because
of the commercials.

00:16:56.450 --> 00:16:59.230
It was just everywhere.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:04.150
And there was even a Polaroid
camera in Dealey Plaza on a

00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:06.130
very bad day in 1963.

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:10.319
That is the only still
photograph of the moment

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.319
President Kennedy died.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:14.000
That was shot with a Polaroid
camera by woman named Mary

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.109
Moorman across the street from
Abraham Zapruder, who was

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:19.713
shooting film--

00:17:19.713 --> 00:17:21.300
movie film, I mean.

00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:26.230
And in fact, that's him,
standing there by the steps.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:28.180
She's in his film,
and he's in hers.

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.070
I've seen pictures of the
original, and there's a big

00:17:34.070 --> 00:17:34.410
thumb print.

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:36.418
I suspect when she was doing
her peeling, she

00:17:36.418 --> 00:17:39.570
got a little tense.

00:17:39.570 --> 00:17:41.100
It's a remarkable picture.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:43.320
And although it's grainy,
it is also powerful.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.850
The big development project of
the '50s and early '60s at

00:17:50.850 --> 00:17:52.640
Polaroid was going from black
and white to color.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:55.000
And it was a huge thing.

00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:57.910
There was one scientist who was
heading up that project,

00:17:57.910 --> 00:17:59.320
and he'd been with Polaroid
for a very long

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.810
time already by then.

00:18:01.810 --> 00:18:04.330
He was tasked with coming up
with color while black and

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:08.920
white was still in the works,
at the very beginning.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:15.940
And essentially, Land told him,
just watch what we do,

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:18.570
follow it, and see what
applies to color.

00:18:18.570 --> 00:18:21.270
And two years in, he turned
to Land and said, I'm

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:23.040
ready to start now.

00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.220
And Land was very
proud of this.

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.200
He said, we created an
atmosphere in which a man was

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.610
expected to sit and do nothing
for two years, just to figure

00:18:31.610 --> 00:18:32.480
something out.

00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:35.580
And he drew a salary, and he
worked with Land for the rest

00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.330
of their careers.

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:40.380
And he was considered really a
genius within Polaroid, a guy

00:18:40.380 --> 00:18:41.630
named Howard Rogers.

00:18:44.410 --> 00:18:48.390
As I said, color was a massive
hit, and it arrived with the

00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:51.340
new line of cameras in the 1960s
that look like that.

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.880
But the real breakthrough
came in 1972.

00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.405
I could show you one of
these, if you like.

00:19:00.405 --> 00:19:02.310
This is from the same line.

00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:03.000
These are lots of fun.

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.380
This is the camera I
carry every day.

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:06.970
I still use it.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:11.480
And this is the oldest one for
which film is still made.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.830
As I said, it was
a massive hit.

00:19:12.830 --> 00:19:16.210
But the real fundamental
change came,

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.410
as I said, in 1972.

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:22.590
Up until then, all these systems
required peeling and

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:26.530
sometimes coating the picture
after it was produced.

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:35.660
There was a lot of rigmarole
involved.

00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:40.130
Land had said, starting in the
1940s, that his dream was

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:41.880
one-step color photography.

00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:45.430
You point, you shoot, you see
your print, and that nothing

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.610
should impede your experience
of taking pictures.

00:19:48.610 --> 00:19:49.940
You shouldn't have to
focus the camera.

00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:51.510
You shouldn't have to worry
about the f-stop.

00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:53.030
You shouldn't have to worry
about anything.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:54.590
You point, shoot, see.

00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:57.010
And that would remove the
impediments between a

00:19:57.010 --> 00:19:57.770
photographer and subject.

00:19:57.770 --> 00:19:59.480
It would mean you could
shoot effortlessly

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:02.120
and record your life.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.622
And that camera was the
SX-70, as I said.

00:20:05.622 --> 00:20:07.720
And I've got one of
those as well.

00:20:07.720 --> 00:20:11.310
This is the product
of $2 billion--

00:20:11.310 --> 00:20:13.550
and now those are
1960s dollars--

00:20:13.550 --> 00:20:14.120
in research.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:17.686
It is a fantastic
little object.

00:20:17.686 --> 00:20:20.790
Remember what I said about it
being the thing you see on a

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.070
table and want to pick
it up and touch it?

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.110
It feels good in the hand.

00:20:25.110 --> 00:20:26.590
It's very small.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:28.770
It's what's called a single-lens
reflex, which, if

00:20:28.770 --> 00:20:31.800
you're a photographer, you
know means that your view

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:34.720
through the viewfinder is the
view through the lens.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.830
And in a camera that small,
that's remarkable.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:42.320
I should explain that
that's how it works.

00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:48.360
And although it is manual focus,
it's a big ground glass

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:50.980
screen, and it is very,
very close to being

00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:54.010
effortless to use.

00:20:54.010 --> 00:20:56.590
Some version of this is the
camera we all grew up with.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.400
And you just can't
underestimate

00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:02.580
its impact back then.

00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.760
It was the ultimate expression
of a medium.

00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.900
And as I said, it
was a sensation.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:14.180
Cover of "Time," cover of
"Life." And I will say that

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:16.545
there were fans of this camera
absolutely everywhere.

00:21:19.870 --> 00:21:21.630
Do I not have it
on full screen?

00:21:24.486 --> 00:21:27.818
AUDIENCE: If you just play,
I think it'll just--

00:21:27.818 --> 00:21:30.198
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS: Sorry.

00:21:30.198 --> 00:21:31.130
There you go.

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:32.660
Much better.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:33.910
Thank you.

00:21:37.610 --> 00:21:39.710
Not only was this popular
amongst snapshot people, but

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:41.830
it was embraced by all
sorts of people.

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:44.050
Fine artists loved Polaroid.

00:21:44.050 --> 00:21:49.050
There were people like Walker
Evans, who was a great

00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:50.610
chronicler of Depression-era
America.

00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.100
He always use a big
view camera, or

00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.680
something very involved.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:57.150
Late in his career, he was old
and sick and unable to handle

00:21:57.150 --> 00:21:59.630
a great big photographic
apparatus.

00:21:59.630 --> 00:22:02.300
But somebody gave him one of
these, and he took it as a

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.410
little challenge.

00:22:03.410 --> 00:22:07.010
He said, let's see what we
can make this thing do.

00:22:07.010 --> 00:22:10.370
And he shot hundreds upon
hundreds of Polaroid pictures.

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:12.590
At the end of his career,
there's a whole second body of

00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:16.280
work from the 1970s in the
couple of years before his

00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:19.240
death, when he just
went nuts with it.

00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.760
They look like the Walker Evans
photos you know from the

00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:23.520
'40s and '50s, except they're
color, and they're little

00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:24.190
square things.

00:22:24.190 --> 00:22:25.210
And they're beautiful.

00:22:25.210 --> 00:22:29.210
Metropolitan Museum of Art has
the whole run of them.

00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:30.010
They've done exhibits.

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.930
If they do another one soon,
I highly encourage a visit.

00:22:32.930 --> 00:22:35.240
They are irresistible
little things.

00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:38.070
There's a good book
of them, too.

00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:40.536
But he was hardly the
only artist who did.

00:22:40.536 --> 00:22:43.260
There's someone you
may have heard of.

00:22:43.260 --> 00:22:46.760
Andy Warhol loved Polaroid
pictures, because they were

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:50.860
spontaneous, because they
were instantaneous.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:56.400
This particular picture you see
is something very special.

00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:02.080
Polaroid, in the 1970s,
built a very special

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:03.150
large-format camera.

00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.270
It's the thing standing
behind him.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:09.060
It makes pictures that are
20 by 24 inches, original

00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:11.800
Polaroid prints that develop
in 90 seconds.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.430
And the picture he's holding
had come out of that camera

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.800
perhaps two minutes before.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:22.680
They built, ultimately, about
five of these cameras.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:27.220
And at least one of them is
still active in New York.

00:23:27.220 --> 00:23:29.940
I have been down to the studio
where it runs, and it is like

00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:32.620
nothing else imaginable.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:34.760
This picture fascinates me in
particular, because what you

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.670
see is that, A, he's got exactly
the same expression in

00:23:39.670 --> 00:23:41.540
both images of himself.

00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:43.720
And B, there's an extra little
[INAUDIBLE], which is that

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:46.180
he's got one of these cameras
under his arm.

00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:50.080
So this is a Polaroid of Andy
of a Polaroid of a Polaroid.

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:54.960
And if you're deep in this
subject, it says it all.

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:58.190
Another reason he embraced
Polaroid, I think, was that it

00:23:58.190 --> 00:24:02.990
was, as these media
go, kind of sexy.

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:06.920
And that opens up the
discussion to

00:24:06.920 --> 00:24:08.100
a whole other world.

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:10.900
It's no secret that a lot of
people embrace Polaroid for

00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:14.690
the kind of pictures you can't
send out to the lab.

00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:16.580
At the high end of that
discussion is Robert

00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:21.730
Mapplethorpe, who produced
beautiful nudes and semi-nudes

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:25.120
with a Polaroid camera--
one of these guys--

00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:30.650
that, given how strongly
homoerotic they are, in the

00:24:30.650 --> 00:24:34.530
1960s and early '70s, if he'd
sent them to a lab, even in

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.590
New York, I think he probably
would have gotten arrested.

00:24:37.590 --> 00:24:39.180
So he did them privately
at home.

00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:42.350
It also provides a certain
intimacy and, not to say

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.150
secrecy, but a safety measure.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:48.840
If you have a Polaroid print of
yourself that you wouldn't

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:51.880
want other people to see,
and you have it in your

00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:53.630
hand, that's it.

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:55.930
There's no negative off
in a vault somewhere.

00:24:55.930 --> 00:24:56.670
It can't escape.

00:24:56.670 --> 00:24:59.230
If you lock it in your desk
drawer, until somebody takes

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:01.290
it from you and puts it on
a scanner, it's yours.

00:25:01.290 --> 00:25:03.230
It is an addition of one.

00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:08.135
And thus, it's almost more
like a painting than a

00:25:08.135 --> 00:25:09.650
photograph in some ways,
because you can't

00:25:09.650 --> 00:25:10.650
exactly copy it.

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.800
You can take a picture of
it and copy it that way.

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:14.880
But the original is the
original, and that's it.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:21.780
If there's anyone, though, any
fine artist who embraced

00:25:21.780 --> 00:25:23.910
Polaroid more than anyone else,
it had to have been

00:25:23.910 --> 00:25:30.710
Ansel Adams, who was always a
technician of photography.

00:25:30.710 --> 00:25:32.930
If you read his photography
books, there's a lot about

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.300
making a fantastic image
on a piece of paper.

00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:43.650
But there's even more about
f-stop settings.

00:25:43.650 --> 00:25:46.400
He was besotted with the
technology of photography and

00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:48.350
making his pictures
better that way.

00:25:48.350 --> 00:25:53.440
So you had, in Adams, an artist
who was a technician.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:54.830
And in Land, a great

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:56.950
technician who was an aesthete.

00:25:56.950 --> 00:26:00.260
The two of them met at a
conference in 1949, and they

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:02.320
hit it off fantastically.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.940
The discussion ended with Land
taking Adams's portrait on

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:10.320
experimental Polaroid film, and
asking him if he'd consult

00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:11.940
for Polaroid.

00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:17.770
And Adams said yes, $100 a
month, and stayed a Polaroid

00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.540
consultant at considerably
higher rates later on, for the

00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.270
rest of his life.

00:26:23.270 --> 00:26:24.830
He dedicated one of
his books to Land.

00:26:24.830 --> 00:26:26.450
He wrote an entire book
on just how to

00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:27.700
take Polaroid pictures.

00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.110
He took his consultancy
seriously.

00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:35.346
He was not just some guy who
sort of collected money and

00:26:35.346 --> 00:26:37.110
showed up at a party
once in awhile.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:40.420
Every time they created a new
film or a new camera, they'd

00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.660
box it up and send it out to
Carmel, and Ansel would go off

00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.880
to the woods or to the mountains
or something and

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.240
take a lot of pictures, and
annotate them, and mark them

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:51.730
up on the back, staple them to
memos with lots of technical

00:26:51.730 --> 00:26:53.500
notes, and mail them
back to Cambridge.

00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:55.860
And then he'd come up and
discuss what he'd done, also.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.440
A lot of old Polaroid people I
talk to have stories about

00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:01.910
going out and getting drunk
with Ansel Adams, which is

00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:02.910
irresistible.

00:27:02.910 --> 00:27:03.930
He took it seriously.

00:27:03.930 --> 00:27:05.510
He thought of himself as
part of the movement.

00:27:09.870 --> 00:27:13.770
So given that this was going
so great, the question

00:27:13.770 --> 00:27:17.820
everybody has is where things
started to go wrong.

00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:20.860
And as I said, the company
peaked in the mid-'70s at a

00:27:20.860 --> 00:27:22.890
billion pictures a year.

00:27:22.890 --> 00:27:25.250
And right then, a few things
started to happen.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:29.580
The company was so successful
that it began to bring a lot

00:27:29.580 --> 00:27:32.910
of its work in-house.

00:27:32.910 --> 00:27:35.690
Manufacturing became a large
arm of Polaroid.

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:39.460
Instead of it being an idea
factory that made stuff, it

00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:44.330
began to be a company that made
stuff and also had ideas.

00:27:44.330 --> 00:27:47.420
And while that was probably
necessary, especially because

00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:50.110
one of their suppliers in the
film business had been Eastman

00:27:50.110 --> 00:27:51.940
Kodak, and Kodak was beginning
to perceive them as a

00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:54.390
competitor rather than a
partner, they had to bring a

00:27:54.390 --> 00:27:55.740
lot of things in-house.

00:27:55.740 --> 00:27:59.660
But that began to change their
orientation slightly.

00:27:59.660 --> 00:28:03.030
And then came a product called
Polavision, which is largely

00:28:03.030 --> 00:28:05.530
forgotten now, and is sort
of a fascinating

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:08.020
Boot Hill of a thing.

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:10.350
It had been a pet project of
Land's starting in the early

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:13.650
'60s, and he spent almost two
decades nursing it through the

00:28:13.650 --> 00:28:15.900
labs and out into
the marketplace.

00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:18.430
Polavision was a system
of instant-developing

00:28:18.430 --> 00:28:20.394
eight-millimeter movie film.

00:28:20.394 --> 00:28:24.350
You had a camera with
a cartridge of film.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:26.445
You shot your three
minutes of film.

00:28:26.445 --> 00:28:27.600
You took out the cartridge.

00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:29.900
You dropped it in a player,
which looked like a TV set

00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.520
with a slot on top.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:34.890
As it rewound the cartridge, it
developed it in 90 seconds.

00:28:34.890 --> 00:28:37.360
By the time it got to the
end, it was done.

00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:40.570
It was so irresistible as a
piece of technology, but it

00:28:40.570 --> 00:28:42.045
was not an irresistible
product.

00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:49.350
It had user experience flaws,
we might say today.

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:51.970
You had to use very bright
lights, because the film was

00:28:51.970 --> 00:28:54.750
not very sensitive to light.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:58.230
So you had people squinting into
the movie camera a lot.

00:28:58.230 --> 00:29:01.510
More than that, you couldn't
swap it in that same way.

00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:04.550
And most of all, it came
to market in 1977.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:07.070
And two years earlier, Sony
had brought out the first

00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:10.290
Betamax player and camera.

00:29:10.290 --> 00:29:11.860
We think of Betamax now
as the loser in the

00:29:11.860 --> 00:29:12.750
great videotape wars.

00:29:12.750 --> 00:29:14.050
But back then, they were first,

00:29:14.050 --> 00:29:15.730
and they were a sensation.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:18.530
And a Betamax tape lasted an
hour at the beginning, two

00:29:18.530 --> 00:29:20.970
hours later on.

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:22.910
And a Polavision cartridge
held three

00:29:22.910 --> 00:29:26.320
minutes and had no sound.

00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:27.570
It looked a little better.

00:29:27.570 --> 00:29:30.370
Those early beta tapes were
kind of grainy and nasty.

00:29:30.370 --> 00:29:36.400
But it wasn't that much better
to compensate for the vast

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:40.140
ease of using magnetic tape,
which you could erase and copy

00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.700
and edit easily.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.590
I frankly think this is the
very, very beginning of the

00:29:45.590 --> 00:29:47.310
analog versus digital wars.

00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:49.990
Magnetic tape is still analog,
but it functions in some ways

00:29:49.990 --> 00:29:50.690
like digital media.

00:29:50.690 --> 00:29:55.950
You can copy it, and you
can mess with it.

00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:58.010
You can take it over to a
friend's house, and they

00:29:58.010 --> 00:29:59.280
probably have a player
that matches.

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.560
Whereas this Polavision thing
was only in your house,

00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:02.810
chances are.

00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.750
You could argue that swapping
videotapes--

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:08.950
or renting videotapes,
whatever--

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:12.990
was the very, very beginning
of something akin to file

00:30:12.990 --> 00:30:17.110
sharing, or BitTorrenting,
or whatever way

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:19.720
you swap movies now.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:23.470
Polavision was a disaster.

00:30:23.470 --> 00:30:26.790
They sold maybe 50,000 sets.

00:30:26.790 --> 00:30:29.840
A lot of them were dumped
in a landfill.

00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:32.550
And Land, for the first time,
after 60 years of betting his

00:30:32.550 --> 00:30:35.280
company over and over on the
next product, and driving it

00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.680
higher and higher, had
missed a step.

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:40.710
And he began to lose the
confidence of this board.

00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:43.320
He was coaxed into not retiring,
but to giving up

00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.170
chairmanship to one
of his colleagues.

00:30:45.170 --> 00:30:47.310
And he was suddenly on
a shorter tether.

00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:49.240
There was an idea that
maybe he had run out

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:50.890
his creative strain.

00:30:50.890 --> 00:30:56.380
And he became frustrated, and
was eventually eased into

00:30:56.380 --> 00:30:56.870
retirement.

00:30:56.870 --> 00:31:01.300
He left Polaroid in 1982, and
he really cut all his ties.

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.760
He stopped going to parties.

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.880
He had nothing to do
with the place.

00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:09.950
The other thing that happened
was that Kodak, as I said,

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:15.570
which had begun to perceive
Polaroid as a competitor,

00:31:15.570 --> 00:31:17.440
decided to actually
compete with them.

00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.090
I apologize, I'm behind.

00:31:21.090 --> 00:31:23.510
That's the Polavision system,
and that was from their

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:24.060
advertising.

00:31:24.060 --> 00:31:27.590
Danny Kaye was their
spokesman.

00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:34.860
Kodak decided to get into the
game, and in 1976, introduced

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:36.710
its own instant camera line.

00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:39.650
It competed directly
with SX-70.

00:31:39.650 --> 00:31:42.430
It was a big, ugly, hulking
camera, and it ejected its

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:45.000
print out the front, and it had
a white border with a fat

00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.970
tab at the bottom, and it was
a more or less square image.

00:31:47.970 --> 00:31:50.710
It looked a whole lot like a
Polaroid camera, except it

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:51.460
didn't fold up.

00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:53.990
It wasn't an elegant little
doodad like this.

00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:57.220
It was a big thing with fake
wood grain on the front.

00:31:57.220 --> 00:32:01.640
And the Polaroid people were not
only concerned about the

00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:07.030
competition, but Land himself
was, I think, furious.

00:32:07.030 --> 00:32:10.790
He didn't express anger, per se,
but he sort of sneered at

00:32:10.790 --> 00:32:11.810
this product.

00:32:11.810 --> 00:32:16.500
He felt that if Kodak, with
its vast reach and vaster

00:32:16.500 --> 00:32:20.020
resources, couldn't do more
than rip him off--

00:32:20.020 --> 00:32:24.200
well, if they'd come up with a
fantastic, superior product

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:26.510
that had leapfrogged Polaroid,
he probably would have

00:32:26.510 --> 00:32:28.830
appreciated that and said, well,
let's use that to drive

00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:30.160
us to the next great thing.

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:32.330
Instead, they just did
a cheesy copy.

00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:34.550
And what they had done was hire
lawyers to go through all

00:32:34.550 --> 00:32:36.630
of Polaroid's patents, and see
if they could do a bob and

00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:38.370
weave and get around it.

00:32:38.370 --> 00:32:41.650
Some of this may sound
familiar, too.

00:32:41.650 --> 00:32:44.140
So what they'd done, for
example, was to rearrange the

00:32:44.140 --> 00:32:46.730
camera geometry, so the photo
exposed through the back

00:32:46.730 --> 00:32:48.110
rather than the front.

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:52.050
And the layers were structured
differently

00:32:52.050 --> 00:32:53.830
within the instant film.

00:32:53.830 --> 00:32:55.480
And a few other things were
done differently, too.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:59.920
But fundamentally, it looked
an awful lot like that.

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:02.390
Well, Polaroid, a few days
after the product

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.150
introduction, sued them.

00:33:04.150 --> 00:33:08.580
And the two companies spent
14 and 1/2 years in court.

00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:12.520
What happened, ultimately,
was that Polaroid won.

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:16.080
In 1991, they got $1 billion
from Kodak. $925

00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.540
million, to be exact.

00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:21.420
And it was, at the time,
the largest patent

00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.680
lawsuit ever paid out.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.420
And it was, until
two months ago.

00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.430
Apple v Samsung finally
topped it.

00:33:26.430 --> 00:33:28.500
I think $1.3, $1.4 billion.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:32.070
Until then, nobody had ever
paid more over a patent or

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.320
series of patents.

00:33:35.360 --> 00:33:39.410
What this did, although it was
a great victory for Polaroid,

00:33:39.410 --> 00:33:44.820
is it kind of focused them on
going through their paperwork

00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:45.650
and their past.

00:33:45.650 --> 00:33:48.950
And a lot of people were
distracted from innovation in

00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:53.210
favor of shoring up
their history.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:55.370
There are people who were proud
to have done good work

00:33:55.370 --> 00:33:56.340
during that time.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:04.090
But there was definitely a sense
of, not exactly resting

00:34:04.090 --> 00:34:05.760
on their laurels, but definitely
digging through

00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.790
their laurels to
prove a point.

00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:10.940
And it may have been a little
bit of a distraction for a

00:34:10.940 --> 00:34:12.199
company that was in
the business of

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:13.449
coming up with the future.

00:34:16.719 --> 00:34:21.179
In those years, as I
said, Land was no

00:34:21.179 --> 00:34:23.730
longer running the company.

00:34:23.730 --> 00:34:27.900
Two insiders followed
him as CEO.

00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:31.920
And they did some good work.

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:35.040
Throughout the 1980s and early
'90s, there were products

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.280
percolating through the Polaroid
labs that would have

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:40.389
been the next big thing.

00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:43.690
Polaroid had invented, among
other things, a CCD, the

00:34:43.690 --> 00:34:46.090
center that goes into a digital
camera, And actually

00:34:46.090 --> 00:34:50.570
built a lab to refine that
business and produce them, and

00:34:50.570 --> 00:34:55.139
then didn't commercialize it.

00:34:55.139 --> 00:34:59.610
Even more, they developed a
line of inkjet printing

00:34:59.610 --> 00:35:03.810
technologies, and held a lot
of patents there, and also

00:35:03.810 --> 00:35:06.300
failed to commercialize that,
and in fact, even spun it out

00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:09.350
as a separate company.

00:35:09.350 --> 00:35:13.210
They gave up on it.

00:35:13.210 --> 00:35:17.320
All these decisions, in
retrospect, look disastrous.

00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:20.390
I understand why they didn't
get into digital cameras.

00:35:20.390 --> 00:35:22.250
Polaroid made virtually
all its money by

00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:23.390
manufacturing film.

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:26.040
The cameras were, not to say an
afterthought, but they were

00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:29.530
a medium for getting you into
the habit of Polaroid

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:30.010
photography.

00:35:30.010 --> 00:35:31.260
Business school people
know this.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:32.670
It's called the razor
and blade model.

00:35:32.670 --> 00:35:34.780
Gillette gives you the handle,
and then they sell you blades

00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.900
for the rest of your life.

00:35:36.900 --> 00:35:39.180
So it was with Polaroid,
especially the inexpensive

00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:42.475
cameras that came along after
this guy, the plastic ones we

00:35:42.475 --> 00:35:44.080
all grew up with.

00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:46.020
They got down to the point where
they could make them for

00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.390
$5 or something.

00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:49.770
And when a pack of film retailed
for $10, you can see

00:35:49.770 --> 00:35:51.020
the appeal of that business.

00:35:55.340 --> 00:35:57.520
So I can understand why they
didn't make digital cameras,

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.530
because they were simply
terrified of a

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.250
future without film.

00:36:01.250 --> 00:36:02.830
And they kept saying, well,
where's the money in this?

00:36:02.830 --> 00:36:05.220
We can't make any money
without film.

00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:08.110
The inkjet printer mistake is
tougher to understand, because

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:11.491
it's precisely the same
business model.

00:36:11.491 --> 00:36:13.890
You know what you all pay for an
inkjet cartridges for your

00:36:13.890 --> 00:36:15.170
printer at home.

00:36:15.170 --> 00:36:18.470
And even if the printer's a
cheapie, and you save $30 over

00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:21.960
and over for black ink, that
is a great, great business.

00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:23.400
Or was, at least, for HP.

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:30.590
And in fact, one of the CEOs,
the CEO from the late '80s, a

00:36:30.590 --> 00:36:32.960
guy named Mac Booth, once said,
yeah, maybe we should

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.600
have become a printer company.

00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:38.210
That's probably our
great mistake.

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:41.830
But there were a lot of concerns
then, mostly that

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:45.660
because that manufacturing
operation had become so huge,

00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.980
they were tethered to it.

00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:49.070
They owned all that real estate,
and they had all those

00:36:49.070 --> 00:36:53.210
employees, and the system had
been built for huge production

00:36:53.210 --> 00:36:57.100
volumes in the late '70s
and early '80s.

00:36:57.100 --> 00:36:59.330
And as the instant film business
contracted a little

00:36:59.330 --> 00:37:01.030
bit, they had all these
fixed costs.

00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:02.080
You had to pay all those guys.

00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:03.290
You had to pay all
the mortgages.

00:37:03.290 --> 00:37:05.820
You had to keep everything
going.

00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:07.970
So the solution to that was to
keep cranking out more and

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:11.030
more film, and to goose that
market over and over.

00:37:11.030 --> 00:37:14.120
And that meant more plastic,
cheap cameras, many of which

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:17.390
did not make such great
pictures, and long-term,

00:37:17.390 --> 00:37:20.060
probably damaged the reputation
of Polaroid

00:37:20.060 --> 00:37:21.390
photography.

00:37:21.390 --> 00:37:23.610
Because, as I said, many people
think of it as a sort

00:37:23.610 --> 00:37:26.830
of junkie medium, where you use
it to document your dented

00:37:26.830 --> 00:37:32.370
car, but you wouldn't use it
when you went to a national

00:37:32.370 --> 00:37:34.350
park to take great
photographs.

00:37:34.350 --> 00:37:36.840
The problem is some of the
better cameras, like this guy,

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:39.330
actually can make beautiful
pictures on Polaroid film.

00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:42.710
And the large-format stuff that
Ansel Adams favored could

00:37:42.710 --> 00:37:43.820
be magnificent.

00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:46.830
Or the 20 by 24, I have seen
photos taken with that that

00:37:46.830 --> 00:37:49.120
would just knock
your eyes out.

00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:54.030
The clarity of that camera as an
instrument is spectacular.

00:37:54.030 --> 00:37:56.940
I've had my portrait taken
with it, and it's kind of

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:01.030
sobering to see your face blown
up to that big on an

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:04.480
original, for which there is a
negative that big, because the

00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:06.130
resolution is that
much higher.

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:10.360
And so if you have a pore, don't
ask what it looks like.

00:38:10.360 --> 00:38:11.610
They look like nickels.

00:38:16.450 --> 00:38:21.690
Anyway, by the early 1990s,
Polaroid had a sense that

00:38:21.690 --> 00:38:23.910
they'd missed something,
and that they

00:38:23.910 --> 00:38:27.170
couldn't really play catch-up.

00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:35.690
And the solution was to double
down on analog, which now

00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:36.520
sounds ridiculous.

00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:39.220
But back then, they had this
idea that maybe they could

00:38:39.220 --> 00:38:43.370
just get their costs down on
everything and they'd hang on

00:38:43.370 --> 00:38:45.750
to some market share,
and it would be OK.

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:48.180
There was a feeling in the photo
business that the change

00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:51.400
from film to digital would
happen slowly, it would unfold

00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:55.040
over a lot of years, they'd have
the time to work it out.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.940
And although a lot of the prep
work happened through the late

00:38:57.940 --> 00:38:59.690
'80s and into the '90s, when it

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.570
finally came, boom, around--

00:39:01.570 --> 00:39:02.750
call it 2000--

00:39:02.750 --> 00:39:04.250
it happened very fast.

00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:06.920
In less than 10 years, it went
from a completely film

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.150
universe to a completely
digital universe.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:12.080
And they were really,
really socked by it.

00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:19.435
After 1995, they got a
turnaround CEO, and he tried

00:39:19.435 --> 00:39:22.950
to goose it by slashing research
and making all the

00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:25.650
choices that people do when a
company's in desperate times.

00:39:25.650 --> 00:39:27.130
Things just got worse
and worse and worse.

00:39:27.130 --> 00:39:28.940
The debt kept rising.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.280
They'd also had to fight off a
hostile takeover some years

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.660
earlier, and that had incurred
a lot of debt.

00:39:33.660 --> 00:39:35.430
So the financial picture
got bleaker

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:36.740
and bleaker and bleaker.

00:39:36.740 --> 00:39:40.370
And then, a few weeks after
9/11, as the economy of the

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:45.100
United States just fell apart,
Polaroid declared bankruptcy

00:39:45.100 --> 00:39:47.900
in October, 2001.

00:39:47.900 --> 00:39:50.990
Since then, it has been
sold and sold again.

00:39:54.090 --> 00:39:57.860
Then it got a new CEO, who about
four or five years in

00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:00.460
went to jail for fraud because
he'd been running a Ponzi

00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:03.780
scheme and propping it up with
film income from Polaroid.

00:40:06.610 --> 00:40:08.590
He got 50 years in
the federal pen.

00:40:08.590 --> 00:40:10.910
He's still in there.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.710
And in 2004, he made
the decision--

00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:14.580
his name's Tom Petters.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.280
In 2004, he made the decision
that the company was going to

00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:20.290
get out of the film business,
because it was dying.

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:22.690
And they stockpiled enough
ingredients for five years,

00:40:22.690 --> 00:40:25.340
and they said, over and out.

00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:30.720
In 2008, they said we're out
of negatives, the negative

00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:31.430
layer of the film.

00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:33.680
We're going to close down the
next year, all the film

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:35.450
manufacturing.

00:40:35.450 --> 00:40:38.125
Except something happened then
that's sort of surprising.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:45.090
Instead of it tailing off into
oblivion in those five years,

00:40:45.090 --> 00:40:48.320
film sales bottomed out,
and started to go up.

00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:54.310
What started to happen was a
small but noticeable return to

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:57.300
analog instant photography, not
as a mass market product,

00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:00.700
but as an interesting
something else--

00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:04.300
an alternative to digital,
call it.

00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:09.460
You started to see small fine
art shows in the incubators of

00:41:09.460 --> 00:41:11.280
urban hip life.

00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:13.780
Places like Seattle and Portland
and Williamsburg.

00:41:16.730 --> 00:41:21.583
There began to be a hipster
interest in analog instant

00:41:21.583 --> 00:41:22.570
photography.

00:41:22.570 --> 00:41:23.920
It somewhat parallels
what happened to

00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:25.480
LPs a few years earlier.

00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:28.380
In 1995, everybody gave
up the LP for dead.

00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:31.750
And then DJ culture began, and
people discovered you could

00:41:31.750 --> 00:41:33.990
spin things by hand, and you
could do certain things.

00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:36.290
Now, some of this is obviously
just wanting to do something

00:41:36.290 --> 00:41:37.910
different from your peers.

00:41:37.910 --> 00:41:39.280
But that's not all of it.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:44.500
I would say that certain parts
of the appeal of instant

00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:48.890
photography are the urge
for something physical.

00:41:48.890 --> 00:41:50.980
That thing I was talking about
earlier, where you get the

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:54.840
physical print on the spot,
is something special.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:42:01.740
And when everything you see is
digital, and utterly crisp,

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:07.720
and color corrected, and
consistent, some of us crave

00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.800
something that looks a little
different, because it's part

00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.890
of creativity to want to make
something a little different,

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:17.480
and even something
unpredictable.

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:20.150
An instant picture that comes
out of a Polaroid camera, the

00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:22.755
color may be a little weird
because it's chilly that day

00:42:22.755 --> 00:42:27.280
and the chemistry of the print
is reacting strangely.

00:42:27.280 --> 00:42:30.260
That inherently ties the thing
to the moment it was made,

00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:33.370
which is interesting to an
artist or a creative

00:42:33.370 --> 00:42:36.370
person of any kind.

00:42:36.370 --> 00:42:40.010
Nonetheless, they ran out of
ingredients in 2008, 2009,

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:42.010
shut everything down,
because they had to.

00:42:42.010 --> 00:42:43.190
They had stopped
ordering them.

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:44.940
The supply lines had dried up.

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.990
The manufacturers of the weird
chemicals in a Polaroid print

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:49.880
had stopped making them
and shut down.

00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:53.100
One of those factories was even
in Louisiana, and it was

00:42:53.100 --> 00:42:55.370
completely destroyed by
Hurricane Katrina.

00:42:55.370 --> 00:42:57.570
So everything was over.

00:42:57.570 --> 00:42:59.030
They shut down.

00:42:59.030 --> 00:43:03.400
And in fact the plant was
essentially abandoned.

00:43:03.400 --> 00:43:05.120
I mean, it's not abandoned;
somebody owns it.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.940
But that's up in Waltham,
Massachusetts, and that made

00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:12.280
millions upon millions of
packs of Polaroid film.

00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:14.555
I sneaked in and took
that picture myself.

00:43:24.630 --> 00:43:30.280
The thing that happened to
support those people surprises

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:34.090
me a great deal, which is that,
after this plant was

00:43:34.090 --> 00:43:36.250
closed, the last one to shut
down was a place in the

00:43:36.250 --> 00:43:40.060
Netherlands that fed
Europe with film.

00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:44.010
And 48 hours before that plant
was to be closed and its

00:43:44.010 --> 00:43:49.030
machinery demolished, two guys
swooped in and bought it.

00:43:49.030 --> 00:43:51.305
One of them had been the plant
manager, and he was one who

00:43:51.305 --> 00:43:53.150
was supposed to manage
the demolition.

00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:56.350
And he had deliberately
delayed a little bit.

00:43:56.350 --> 00:43:59.620
And the other was a guy named
Florian Kaps, who had been

00:43:59.620 --> 00:44:00.980
working for Lomography.

00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:06.450
You know LOMO, the people who
make analog cameras that shoot

00:44:06.450 --> 00:44:08.510
conventional film
and sell them.

00:44:08.510 --> 00:44:12.060
They have a shop on Eighth
Street, and a big website

00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:15.070
devoted to analog photography
in all its forms.

00:44:15.070 --> 00:44:17.380
They swooped in and bought the
tooling and rented the

00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:21.310
building, and they set
themselves on a project to

00:44:21.310 --> 00:44:24.490
make analog instant film from
scratch, without those

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:29.220
suppliers, and without the
negative layer that Polaroid

00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:33.980
had made on a different site,
and really without all that

00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.470
much expertise, either.

00:44:35.470 --> 00:44:39.500
They hired a lot of old guys who
had institutional memory.

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:43.020
And they had a year's
worth of funding.

00:44:43.020 --> 00:44:44.020
And they went at it.

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:47.560
And after a year and a little
bit, they introduced an analog

00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:50.850
instant film that fits
in an SX-70 camera.

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:51.960
And it didn't work very well.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.780
It looked smudgy and brown.

00:44:54.780 --> 00:44:56.660
And as it came out of the
camera, you had to dive around

00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.510
the front and cover it with a
piece of cardboard, because it

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:00.080
was a little light sensitive.

00:45:00.080 --> 00:45:02.630
There were many reasons
it was flawed.

00:45:02.630 --> 00:45:04.390
Nonetheless, it worked.

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:09.920
And six weeks later, they
introduced a slightly

00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.120
different batch that was maybe
a step better and a little

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.950
less beige and brown.

00:45:14.950 --> 00:45:16.750
It was more like black and
white, a little closer to

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:18.376
black and white.

00:45:18.376 --> 00:45:22.035
A couple of months later,
an improved formula.

00:45:22.035 --> 00:45:25.080
A few months after that,
experimental color, which

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.600
didn't look so great, but didn't
look so bad, either.

00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:29.010
Next batch was a little
brighter.

00:45:29.010 --> 00:45:30.350
Next batch was a little
brighter.

00:45:30.350 --> 00:45:34.100
And this year, in September
2012, they introduced their

00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:36.160
first film that you don't
have to cover.

00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.060
It comes out of the camera, you
put it down, it develops

00:45:39.060 --> 00:45:41.640
in the light, like a Polaroid
picture is supposed to.

00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:45.000
It is a remarkable thing to be
doing, reverse-engineering

00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.370
film to fit in a 40-year-old
camera in 2012, so you can

00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:50.520
make an analog instant
picture.

00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:55.260
Particularly when Fujifilm has
a line of cheapo instant

00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:56.580
cameras that they
already make.

00:45:56.580 --> 00:45:57.670
So you can do this.

00:45:57.670 --> 00:46:01.150
People are besotted with this
camera, and the system that it

00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:06.100
embodies, and want to keep it
going almost against reason.

00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:07.880
I will tell you that Impossible
sold a million

00:46:07.880 --> 00:46:12.740
packs of film last year, at
the breathtaking price of

00:46:12.740 --> 00:46:19.120
$23.50 a pack for
eight photos.

00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:21.340
And got a lot of money out of
me, I'll tell you that.

00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:28.450
So as I said, there is an almost
irrational urge to keep

00:46:28.450 --> 00:46:29.940
this medium alive.

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:31.700
I will show you.

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:36.380
That's inside the Waltham
plant, by the way.

00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:38.840
That is an Impossible
picture that I shot

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:42.270
about four weeks ago.

00:46:42.270 --> 00:46:44.260
That's the little boy I was
telling you about earlier, my

00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:47.350
son, who gets photographed at
the playground all the time.

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:48.930
I will tell you a story
about him as well.

00:46:48.930 --> 00:46:55.090
The other day, he walked up to
me, and he picked up one of

00:46:55.090 --> 00:46:58.180
his toys-- not a toy camera,
just a regulator toy--

00:46:58.180 --> 00:47:00.490
and he said, I'm going
to take your picture.

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:05.522
And he held it up in front
of his eye, like that.

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:08.420
And he said, click!

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:12.010
And then he went like this
with the toy, just mimed.

00:47:12.010 --> 00:47:15.160
And there's your picture.

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:19.630
So I figure he'll make it into
the late 21st century, if he

00:47:19.630 --> 00:47:20.500
lives well.

00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:23.250
And therefore, I think
it brings that old

00:47:23.250 --> 00:47:25.980
slogan back to life.

00:47:25.980 --> 00:47:29.470
"It's more than a camera,
it's almost alive."

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:31.050
Thank you all for coming.

00:47:31.050 --> 00:47:39.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.130
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS:
Questions?

00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:44.820
Yes.

00:47:44.820 --> 00:47:46.110
AUDIENCE: Can you just talk a
little bit about what your

00:47:46.110 --> 00:47:48.290
research process was
for [INAUDIBLE]?

00:47:48.290 --> 00:47:50.220
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS: Sure.

00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:54.230
It was three major parts.

00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:58.180
Polaroid, because they were so
obsessed with patenting, kept

00:47:58.180 --> 00:47:59.490
everything.

00:47:59.490 --> 00:48:01.320
They wanted a paper trail.

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:08.130
And they stashed documentation
about every invention that was

00:48:08.130 --> 00:48:11.710
not only on paper, but
signed and witnessed.

00:48:11.710 --> 00:48:13.700
Every time somebody came up with
something new, they'd go

00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.650
over to one of the lawyers,
and disclose

00:48:15.650 --> 00:48:16.600
on a piece of paper.

00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:18.330
And as I said, the lawyer would
sign the corner, and

00:48:18.330 --> 00:48:20.380
they'd date it, and it'd go
into a file somewhere.

00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:23.620
And I will tell you that when
you're try to trace out these

00:48:23.620 --> 00:48:25.440
inventions as a researcher
50 years later,

00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:28.930
there is nothing better.

00:48:28.930 --> 00:48:32.530
That stuff was all in the
Polaroid archives, which is a

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:33.670
monumental thing.

00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:37.320
It's two million documents,
and at least that many

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.510
photographs.

00:48:38.510 --> 00:48:40.140
It goes on and on forever.

00:48:40.140 --> 00:48:47.040
And after the bankruptcy in
2004, Polaroid gave the whole

00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:50.940
heap to Harvard Business
School's library.

00:48:50.940 --> 00:48:53.840
It's a 30-year project
to catalog it.

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.740
There are about--

00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:55.340
what did I say?

00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:55.660
2004.

00:48:55.660 --> 00:48:56.630
So they're eight years in.

00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:57.305
There's one librarian.

00:48:57.305 --> 00:48:58.260
A guy named Tim Mahoney.

00:48:58.260 --> 00:48:59.660
It's his whole career.

00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:01.770
That archive, that's
what he does.

00:49:01.770 --> 00:49:03.460
The Polaroid archive.

00:49:03.460 --> 00:49:04.170
He's about my age.

00:49:04.170 --> 00:49:06.170
He's going to be there til
retirement, working on just

00:49:06.170 --> 00:49:07.940
this one thing.

00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:11.260
Amazing devotion
to this thing.

00:49:11.260 --> 00:49:14.690
And the first tranche of it
opened to researchers at the

00:49:14.690 --> 00:49:16.490
end of 2009.

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:20.920
In January 2010, I went up
to Cambridge and started.

00:49:20.920 --> 00:49:23.070
It was a fantastic resource.

00:49:23.070 --> 00:49:24.900
And that's where a lot
of it came from.

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:29.160
Second, because Polaroid was at
its peak in the '70s, the

00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:31.980
people who were young then are
still around, and even the

00:49:31.980 --> 00:49:33.980
ones who had been
there a while.

00:49:33.980 --> 00:49:36.350
I talked a lot of people who
started there in the '50s and

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:38.590
retired around 2000.

00:49:38.590 --> 00:49:40.220
And a remarkable number of
them are still around.

00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:42.080
And there's a lot of pride
in what they did.

00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:48.700
Imagine you see a company
disintegrate, and then a

00:49:48.700 --> 00:49:51.710
reporter comes along and wants
to document what you did, that

00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:54.730
you are in danger of
seeing forgotten.

00:49:54.730 --> 00:49:57.380
And if it's something you're
proud of, you want that.

00:49:57.380 --> 00:50:00.530
So people were very
open to me.

00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:03.110
Especially, without knowing
it, a few of the people I

00:50:03.110 --> 00:50:05.680
talked to early turned
out to be--

00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:08.310
they had a lot of friends who
they kept in touch with.

00:50:08.310 --> 00:50:12.100
And so when I talked to them,
and they got to know that I

00:50:12.100 --> 00:50:16.350
wasn't writing some hit piece or
something, very often, when

00:50:16.350 --> 00:50:19.660
I'd call somebody else, they'd
call them and check me out.

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:22.860
So it helped a lot to have hit
a couple of people early who

00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:25.060
turned out to be important.

00:50:25.060 --> 00:50:26.700
The third thing is that
the museum pieces--

00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.360
this kind of stuff--

00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:29.970
Polaroid also had a little
museum collection.

00:50:29.970 --> 00:50:34.960
And it went to the MIT Museum in
Cambridge, which is just an

00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.700
awesome place.

00:50:35.700 --> 00:50:37.510
If you've never been
up there, go.

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:39.190
It's great.

00:50:39.190 --> 00:50:42.610
And that's 10,000 pieces of
interesting artifacts.

00:50:42.610 --> 00:50:44.720
And a lot of the photos of
artifacts that went into the

00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:48.574
book were shot there.

00:50:48.574 --> 00:50:50.265
eBay helps with that, too.

00:50:50.265 --> 00:50:54.712
I have a closet full of
these things now.

00:50:54.712 --> 00:50:55.184
Yes.

00:50:55.184 --> 00:50:58.500
AUDIENCE: What happened
to Land, after all?

00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:00.770
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS: He retired,
as I said in 1982,

00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:03.430
and he cashed out his
Polaroid stock.

00:51:03.430 --> 00:51:06.300
And that brought in the
better part of $1

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:08.440
billion, I might add.

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.870
He had to do it pieces, because
the market wouldn't

00:51:11.870 --> 00:51:12.590
soak it up.

00:51:12.590 --> 00:51:16.820
He used it to start a pure
science institute.

00:51:16.820 --> 00:51:18.330
It's called The Rowland
Institute for Science.

00:51:18.330 --> 00:51:20.120
It was about basic research.

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:21.710
And it was on the Charles
River in Cambridge.

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:24.910
And because they had all this
money from the Polaroid stock,

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:28.190
they built a very
nice building.

00:51:28.190 --> 00:51:30.520
It worked a little like the
Institute for Advanced Study

00:51:30.520 --> 00:51:31.420
at Princeton.

00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:34.160
It was a place where people
could just do

00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:35.250
whatever they pleased.

00:51:35.250 --> 00:51:37.260
Land could perform an experiment
a day that

00:51:37.260 --> 00:51:38.330
interested him.

00:51:38.330 --> 00:51:40.510
Other fellows were brought
in in that same way.

00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:43.380
You got a lab, and you got to
sit and think if you wanted.

00:51:43.380 --> 00:51:47.230
It was something he was very
proud of, and arguably the

00:51:47.230 --> 00:51:49.580
thing he was proudest of at
the end, because he always

00:51:49.580 --> 00:51:51.820
wanted to make a major
contribution to basic science,

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:54.460
and had been, on the side
through his Polaroid years,

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:58.710
working on a theory of how
people perceive color, called

00:51:58.710 --> 00:52:01.620
the retinex theory, which
you can read up on

00:52:01.620 --> 00:52:02.870
if you Google it.

00:52:10.170 --> 00:52:13.020
He spent years trying to--
he would often do these

00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:19.440
demonstrations, where he would
show a black-and-white picture

00:52:19.440 --> 00:52:23.590
through a color filter, and,
with a single filter of yellow

00:52:23.590 --> 00:52:28.000
or red, would be able to make
that image appear almost in

00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:29.370
full color.

00:52:29.370 --> 00:52:31.500
This doesn't make any sense.

00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:34.505
And there is, actually, on
YouTube, a very good film of

00:52:34.505 --> 00:52:36.820
him doing his demonstrations and
showing you how it worked.

00:52:36.820 --> 00:52:38.865
It was done by the BBC
in 1985, and you

00:52:38.865 --> 00:52:41.130
can look for that.

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:44.290
He did that for the last years
of his life very happily,

00:52:44.290 --> 00:52:46.020
cutting all ties with
Polaroid, as I said.

00:52:46.020 --> 00:52:49.800
He skipped the 50th anniversary
party in 1987.

00:52:49.800 --> 00:52:52.080
He just said, let them
do what they do.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:53.750
He kept doing his research.

00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:55.120
Gradually, he became
old and ill.

00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:57.540
He died in 1991.

00:52:57.540 --> 00:53:00.380
And the Rowland Institute kept
going in its form for another

00:53:00.380 --> 00:53:04.580
dozen years or so, and it was
then absorbed by Harvard.

00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:08.350
As the Institute for Advanced
Study is a separate little

00:53:08.350 --> 00:53:11.200
island within Princeton,
the Rowland is

00:53:11.200 --> 00:53:13.590
within Harvard's structure.

00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:19.470
Any more?

00:53:19.470 --> 00:53:19.855
Yes.

00:53:19.855 --> 00:53:22.700
AUDIENCE: How did you first
become involved in Polaroids,

00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:24.668
and where did you get
all [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:28.640
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS: I started
taking pictures

00:53:28.640 --> 00:53:30.980
when I was a kid.

00:53:30.980 --> 00:53:34.790
I think I got my first Polaroid
camera when I was 14.

00:53:34.790 --> 00:53:36.370
It was one of these, if
you can believe it.

00:53:36.370 --> 00:53:38.370
And I must have looked like a
freak, a little kid carrying

00:53:38.370 --> 00:53:39.980
this around.

00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:43.020
But it was $3 in a junk shop.

00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:45.310
It was already old
and out of date.

00:53:45.310 --> 00:53:47.280
And it took this weird old film
that was not so easy to

00:53:47.280 --> 00:53:49.180
find, but it worked.

00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:51.390
And I still have it.

00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:52.960
I towed it around for years.

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.160
Until they stopped making that
particular film format in the

00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:58.330
1990s, I used it
semi-regularly.

00:53:58.330 --> 00:54:00.320
And then I drifted in and out,
like a lot of people.

00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:04.695
But I never exactly forgot
about this stuff.

00:54:04.695 --> 00:54:08.380
In 2008, when the film business
went away, I wrote a

00:54:08.380 --> 00:54:12.268
tiny story for "New York
Magazine," where I work, about

00:54:12.268 --> 00:54:17.343
the curious fact that, although
it had disappeared as

00:54:17.343 --> 00:54:19.240
a mass medium, there were still
artists using Polaroid

00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:22.030
film, and they were very
agitated about this.

00:54:22.030 --> 00:54:24.410
And when I talked to a couple of
artists, they said the same

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:26.810
thing, which is that they
weren't just sad about it

00:54:26.810 --> 00:54:27.660
going, they were angry.

00:54:27.660 --> 00:54:29.420
And they said, this didn't
have to happen.

00:54:29.420 --> 00:54:31.270
This was greed and stupidity.

00:54:31.270 --> 00:54:35.170
And they were really unhappy
about that guy Petters, who I

00:54:35.170 --> 00:54:37.280
mentioned earlier, who
had clearly been

00:54:37.280 --> 00:54:38.960
doing something nefarious.

00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:43.170
And they were angry.

00:54:43.170 --> 00:54:44.370
And that got me curious.

00:54:44.370 --> 00:54:46.960
And then I started, as I was
researching the rest of the

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:52.180
story, going down the sinkhole
into enthusiast websites.

00:54:52.180 --> 00:54:53.830
And I discovered that
there was a cult

00:54:53.830 --> 00:54:55.970
following for this medium.

00:54:55.970 --> 00:55:03.450
And then I found the story of
Land, and over the next few

00:55:03.450 --> 00:55:05.800
months, the story of the
Impossible project, which grew

00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:09.060
out of one of these
enthusiast sites.

00:55:09.060 --> 00:55:11.510
So what I discovered very
quickly was that the story had

00:55:11.510 --> 00:55:14.210
a beginning, middle, and an end,
and a little coda, and

00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:15.680
that through it all, you
had the story of this

00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:17.750
extraordinary guy, Land.

00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:21.400
And I always say, if you're a
writer and you discover, A,

00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:24.240
great story in three acts, and
B, a great main character, you

00:55:24.240 --> 00:55:28.140
start to think, hmm,
there's a book.

00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:31.590
Also, to be blunt, it was 2009,
and a lot of magazines

00:55:31.590 --> 00:55:32.930
were in serious trouble.

00:55:32.930 --> 00:55:34.920
And I thought, well, maybe I
ought to have a lifeboat.

00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:39.280
So a book project
was a lifeboat.

00:55:43.050 --> 00:55:43.820
Any other questions?

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:47.428
AUDIENCE: Can we
look at them--

00:55:47.428 --> 00:55:49.220
can you hold up the SX-70?

00:55:49.220 --> 00:55:50.982
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS:
Sure thing.

00:55:50.982 --> 00:55:52.360
AUDIENCE: Because when you held
it up, and you said it

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:55.048
fits in the palm of your hand--
hold it up like this.

00:55:55.048 --> 00:55:56.000
Like, flat like this.

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:56.720
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS:
Exactly like that.

00:55:56.720 --> 00:55:57.540
AUDIENCE: Is it the
same length?

00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:58.390
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS:
It's pretty close.

00:55:58.390 --> 00:56:00.340
AUDIENCE: This is a Nexus 7.

00:56:00.340 --> 00:56:01.160
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS:
And the other way?

00:56:01.160 --> 00:56:02.520
It's almost the same,
isn't it?

00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:03.010
AUDIENCE: See what I mean?

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:04.740
Like you said, it fits
in your hand.

00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:05.940
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS: This is
thicker, so your hands have to

00:56:05.940 --> 00:56:06.670
go up the side.

00:56:06.670 --> 00:56:10.750
Also, it's a lot heavier,
because there's a

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:11.850
lot of metal in there.

00:56:11.850 --> 00:56:15.180
Oh, you asked also where
I got these.

00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:16.520
Let's see.

00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:20.290
The oldest one was
a buck on eBay.

00:56:20.290 --> 00:56:22.530
As I said, they sold almost a
million of these, and nobody

00:56:22.530 --> 00:56:24.990
wants them.

00:56:24.990 --> 00:56:26.570
They're heavy.

00:56:26.570 --> 00:56:27.575
I mean It's a lovely doorstop.

00:56:27.575 --> 00:56:31.180
But if you want it,
you can have it.

00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:32.952
I have a couple.

00:56:32.952 --> 00:56:35.670
The SX-70, you can
get these through

00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:36.370
the Impossible Project.

00:56:36.370 --> 00:56:38.040
They re-condition them
and sell them.

00:56:38.040 --> 00:56:40.060
Or you can take your chances
with a garage sale, which

00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:42.120
would be much cheaper.

00:56:42.120 --> 00:56:46.680
This one, I bought this online
somewhere several years ago.

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.820
I'm not sure where.

00:56:47.820 --> 00:56:52.390
And this guy has the best story
of all, because I had a

00:56:52.390 --> 00:56:53.920
similar camera on my shoulder.

00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:57.180
As I said, I go around with
one all the time.

00:56:57.180 --> 00:57:01.757
And a guy sees me on
the subway one day.

00:57:04.270 --> 00:57:05.450
This was their professional
model.

00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:07.270
This was the expensive
one in that line.

00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:08.960
And I had the cheaper
one on my shoulder.

00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:12.270
And a guy sees me on the subway,
and he leans in close,

00:57:12.270 --> 00:57:15.660
and he says, do you
have a model 180?

00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:17.220
And I said, no.

00:57:17.220 --> 00:57:21.970
And I know what a model 180 is
because who if not me, right?

00:57:21.970 --> 00:57:23.280
And I said, no, but
I want one.

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:28.150
And he's like, I've
got a few of them.

00:57:28.150 --> 00:57:29.430
And he gives me his
phone number--

00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:30.830
no, I give him my
phone number.

00:57:30.830 --> 00:57:33.040
And I get a call a
few hours later.

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:35.086
He says, I'm going to be in
the city on Saturday.

00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:38.400
I know.

00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.680
It's like I was buying
drugs, right?

00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.210
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:42.815
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS: And so
we meet in Central Park.

00:57:45.340 --> 00:57:46.900
This is absolutely true.

00:57:46.900 --> 00:57:50.630
And he's got this suitcase
with nine cameras in it.

00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:51.440
And it's filthy.

00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:54.000
It's been in his basement
in the Bronx.

00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:55.750
It's covered in crud.

00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:56.740
It's disgusting.

00:57:56.740 --> 00:57:59.680
It smells like a basement
in the Bronx.

00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:03.500
And it's nine cameras.

00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:06.120
Two of the good ones, and seven
of the regular ones.

00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:10.520
And he sells me the whole thing
for what less than one

00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:15.270
of these would cost from
a reputable source.

00:58:15.270 --> 00:58:18.640
And I sold the others off to a
guy who refurbishes cameras

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:20.140
and sells them online.

00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:24.230
And so I essentially broke
even on the whole thing.

00:58:24.230 --> 00:58:27.168
And I got the best story
imaginable out of it.

00:58:27.168 --> 00:58:29.377
Although I did have to spend a
couple of days cleaning, let

00:58:29.377 --> 00:58:31.300
me tell you, because the
thing was repulsive.

00:58:34.540 --> 00:58:35.790
Anyone else?

00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:38.420
Looks like we're done.

00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.696
Oh, yes, one more.

00:58:40.696 --> 00:58:43.347
AUDIENCE: I don't know if it's
a question so much, but I

00:58:43.347 --> 00:58:45.516
didn't know this story at all,
and it's really interesting.

00:58:45.516 --> 00:58:49.613
Especially the company goes from
a company that would let

00:58:49.613 --> 00:58:53.776
someone work alone for two years
to a company that gets

00:58:53.776 --> 00:58:57.504
held up in litigation
for 15 years.

00:58:57.504 --> 00:59:01.977
Do you see any, apart from the
obvious, parallels with Apple

00:59:01.977 --> 00:59:02.971
[INAUDIBLE]

00:59:02.971 --> 00:59:05.953
other companies today that have
learned from Polaroid,

00:59:05.953 --> 00:59:09.940
whether they be trying
to avoid [INAUDIBLE]?

00:59:09.940 --> 00:59:11.520
CHRISTOPHER BONANOS: Well,
I'll tell you.

00:59:11.520 --> 00:59:13.210
My sense of what
to take away--

00:59:13.210 --> 00:59:14.670
I can't name any company,
per se.

00:59:14.670 --> 00:59:16.760
But the thing I would
tell anybody to

00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:19.160
take away is twofold.

00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.210
One is a credo of Land's.

00:59:21.210 --> 00:59:24.650
He once said, don't do anything
someone else can do.

00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:31.960
A business school might talk
about unique business models

00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:32.280
or whatever.

00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:35.590
But fundamentally, the thing on
which you're trying to make

00:59:35.590 --> 00:59:37.850
your money should be something
that's yours and yours alone.

00:59:37.850 --> 00:59:41.840
And if you patent it, it'll stay
yours for a little while.

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:43.520
Patents don't hold.

00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:46.210
You can't probably own a
technology for 40 years

00:59:46.210 --> 00:59:49.030
anymore, the way Polaroid did.

00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:51.580
Nobody else got into the game
for the first 40 years, which

00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:53.050
is astonishing.

00:59:53.050 --> 00:59:58.410
And then, when they beat back
Kodak, they got another 20.

00:59:58.410 --> 01:00:00.220
And in fact, that became their
undoing, that they

01:00:00.220 --> 01:00:01.850
just stuck with it.

01:00:01.850 --> 01:00:05.410
But the point is that they had
a product that was all their

01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:08.730
own, that nobody else could
do, because it was so

01:00:08.730 --> 01:00:09.630
complicated.

01:00:09.630 --> 01:00:11.680
Making instant film is crazy.

01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:15.130
And they were so far ahead
of everyone else.

01:00:15.130 --> 01:00:17.600
So that's thing one.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:23.820
And thing two is another
saying that's

01:00:23.820 --> 01:00:24.710
attributed to Land.

01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:26.560
I don't know if it's true.

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:28.540
I was never able to confirm that
he actually said this.

01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:32.380
But it's around, and
people do think so.

01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:36.050
Which is that someone is going
to make your product obsolete.

01:00:36.050 --> 01:00:38.850
Make sure it's you.

01:00:38.850 --> 01:00:41.110
And I think that's very telling,
because Polaroid did

01:00:41.110 --> 01:00:42.870
not make sure it was them.

01:00:42.870 --> 01:00:45.050
And that's that.

01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.190
OK, thanks all for coming.

01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:54.287
[APPLAUSE]
