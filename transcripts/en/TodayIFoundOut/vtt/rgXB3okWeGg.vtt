00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.200
While sharks aren’t exactly the ruthless
predators most Hollywood features make them

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.680
out to be (see: Do Sharks Really Not Like
How Humans Taste?), they do possess a number

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.090
of frighteningly efficient mechanisms to assist
with aquatic hunting, including ultra-streamlined

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.009
bodies, high intelligence, the ability to
detect electrical fields and minute changes

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.820
in water pressure, great hearing, incredibly
sharp vision, amazing sense of smell (Lemon

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.580
sharks can even detect tuna oil at a concentration
of just one part per 25 million), and the

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:44.870
topic of today- many rows of razor sharp teeth,
including the ability to rapidly replace them.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.629
But are sharks actually able to grow an unlimited
number of teeth throughout their lives?

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:50.629
Yep.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:54.320
In fact, while the number varies wildly based
on things like type of shark and lifespan,

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.880
it’s not out of the question for a single
shark to grow as many as 30,000-50,000 teeth

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.000
in its lifetime!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.770
This might have you wondering what the process
is on how exactly sharks replace missing teeth?

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.870
shark teethIn a nutshell, all sharks have
multiple series and rows of teeth.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.470
The number varies between type of shark, but
most have between 5 and 15 series of teeth

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.250
(counted from front to back) in their mouths
which themselves contain between 15 and 25

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.000
rows of teeth (counted along the jawline).

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.049
(As an example of how this can vary, the bull
shark possess an unbelievable 50 rows and

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.840
7 series of teeth, giving it somewhere in
the vicinity of 350 frightening teeth at any

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:32.920
given time.)

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:37.000
These teeth are arranged in such a way that
the frontmost series will always house the

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.670
largest teeth with the series behind it holding
slightly smaller teeth and behind that holding

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.119
smaller ones still, and so on until we get
back to the rear series which are the most

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.409
recently formed.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.789
These front teeth are referred to as the shark’s
“working teeth” and are the ones primarily

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.790
used for biting, tearing flesh and all of
the other things a shark is thinking about

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.650
doing when it’s swimming around below your
legs as you dangle them in the ocean…

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:02.429
This isn’t to say that the second, third
or even the teeth located towards the back

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.300
of a shark’s mouth aren’t used when a
shark is devouring something like your lower

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.160
half, it’s just that the front series of
teeth are typically subjected to the most

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.240
stress when this occurs.

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:16.150
(Note: In truth, only about a dozen people
per year are killed by sharks vs. approximately

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:21.120
20-30 million sharks per year killed by humans
according to the Florida Museum of Natural

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.090
History’s Department of Ichthyology.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.960
Who’s the apex predator now sharky?)

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.900
Given shark teeth are not deeply rooted like
human teeth and given the animal’s incredible

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.459
biting power, shark lose teeth pretty frequently
when eating, usually front ones.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.340
Not only that, but they also naturally shed
teeth throughout their lives, with the front

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.040
teeth being fully replaced approximately every
few weeks.

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.370
(This rate varies by type of shark, age, and
even the temperature of the water- younger

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.870
sharks typically replace teeth faster and,
at least in some types of sharks, colder temperatures

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.750
help them hang on to their teeth longer.)

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.610
This means that the teeth in a shark’s mouth
are nearly always in pristine condition and

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.730
quite sharp, as they typically never get the
chance to be dulled or worn over time before

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.459
being shed or broken off.

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.360
Whenever a shark loses a tooth, the tooth
directly behind it will begin to be pushed

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:10.360
forward into the area left by the old tooth,
all the while growing to the size of the tooth

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.470
it is replacing.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.900
At the same time, the tooth behind that will
do the same thing and so will every other

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.159
tooth until the shark once again has a full
set of teeth- more or less a “conveyor belt”

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:21.159
of death.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.220
And if you’re wondering whether or not losing
teeth via them breaking off when they bite

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.900
something hurts sharks, this isn’t clear.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.349
Shark teeth do have a certain amount of flex
(in great whites approximately 15 degrees

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.730
of flex) which they can sense, using this
fact to help “feel” things, not unlike

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.470
how a human might touch something to feel
its texture.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.599
But as for pain in over-flexing to the point
of loss of a tooth, observations of sharks

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.909
in the wild and captivity seem to indicate
that, if there is any pain involved, it is

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:49.069
only minor discomfort at most.

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.790
Given how critical it is for sharks to have
a good set of chompers and how easily teeth

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.790
are broken off, it will likely not surprise
you that this replacement process happens

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.959
quite quickly.

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:02.209
As for an exact time-frame, this varies and
can be influenced by a number of factors including

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:06.920
the size, species and age of the shark, how
recently the tooth replacing their missing

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.950
tooth was itself replaced and the shark’s
overall health.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.280
But for a ballpark figure, this process can
take anywhere from between a single day to

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.299
a few weeks.

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.400
However, even in the event that replacing
the tooth does take weeks, the smaller teeth

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.960
are still useful, meaning the loss of even
several teeth in the first series is highly

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:27.000
unlikely to negatively impact the shark in
question.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.100
So to sum up, as far as experts are aware,
there is no upper limit on the amount of teeth

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:36.550
a given shark can produce in a lifetime; as
long as it stays healthy, a shark will continue

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.970
to grow new teeth until the day it dies.

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.520
As a side-effect of all this, the ocean floor
is covered in many trillions of shark teeth,

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.320
which is one of the reasons we know so much
about shark evolution.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.600
You see, as with most teeth, because shark
teeth are primarily made of a hard, calcified

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.449
tissue known as dentin (for reference elephant
tusks are primarily made of dentin as well)

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:59.270
surrounded by an even harder layer of enamel,
their teeth don’t typically decompose.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.320
This, combined with how (relatively) quickly
their teeth are fossilised by the sediments

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.699
on the ocean floor, means we have a massive
number of ancient shark teeth to study today.

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:08.699
(And if you’re curious, see How Do Things
Become Petrified?)

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:12.210
(As another interesting aside, a shark’s
placoid scales are also made up largely of

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.789
dentine and don’t grow in size once in place.

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:18.910
So to accommodate this, as their bodies grow,
they produce new teeth-like scales to more

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.449
or less fill in the gaps.)
