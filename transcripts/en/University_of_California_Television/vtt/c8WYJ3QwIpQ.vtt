(upbeat music)

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.340
- [Man] Funding for this
program was provided by

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.033
the UCLA Office of
Instructional Development.

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:20.439
(dramatic music)

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:44.192
(audience applauding)

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:49.700
- Professor Bristow and
Executive Vice Chancellor Waugh,

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.310
thank you very much for
the kind introduction.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.010
I'd like to thank the faculty committee

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.720
for giving me the honor and privilege

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.083
of presenting this lecture.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.800
Family, friends, colleagues, students,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.350
and those who are interested
in matters of breathing,

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.120
I welcome you.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.840
I'm gonna talk to you today
about breathing matters.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.050
And just give you an outline
of what I'm going to say,

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.210
I'm going to tell you
a little bit about me

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.930
so you understand why a
scholar would be interested in

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.850
understanding the basic mechanisms

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.000
by which the brain controls breathing.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.480
I'll tell you a little bit
about breathing in general,

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.090
just so you understand what
the brain has to work with

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.433
in order for us to be able
to ventilate properly.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.250
I'll talk about our discovery of

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.630
the principal engine for
breathing that drives the rhythm

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.873
that you're all experiencing right now.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.420
I'll then talk about
some of the mechanisms

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.130
that my underlie rhythmic generation.

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.530
Then I'll talk a little bit about

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.743
a discovery of a second engine
that was totally unexpected.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.960
And then I'll talk about
some recent work we've done

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.970
about things that are
not normally considered

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:04.730
part of the general aspect of breathing.

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:09.730
One is sighing, which I think
is a rather interesting story.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.880
And the other is about
breathing and emotion.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.253
Now, a little bit about my background.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:20.243
There we go.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:26.190
When I went to graduate school,
I was very interested in

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.064
studying the physics of space and time.

00:02:29.064 --> 00:02:30.760
And that was going to be my thing.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.490
I went to a university that
had a great cosmologist

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:35.450
and I was all set to work on this.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.360
But it was a time in
universities throughout America

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.910
that students were very
interested in perception

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.320
and I read a lot about perception.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.890
And I realized that the
perception of space and time

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.960
was a really interesting problem.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.710
And I got read, and I read about it,

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.610
and I went to my physics
department professor and I said,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.740
look, here's the problem
I want to work on.

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:03.140
You have an image, it
goes through your retina,

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.120
it goes through this complex process,

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.280
and then up in your head pops grandma.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.980
Now, how does this happen?

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.740
Well, when I told that to my
advisor, he about had a stroke.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.280
Because he said, this is
an impossible problem.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.780
I can't let you work on
an impossible problem.

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.880
The only way I'm gonna permit
you to work on a problem

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.750
is you find something that's solvable.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.580
So I went back and I
spoke to a lot of people,

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.330
read quite a bit, and they said, look,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.930
the simplest problem is
if we have a tonic input

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.960
and it goes into a
relatively simple circuit

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.630
and out comes a rhythm.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.600
And as a physicist, rhythms
were right in my sweet spot.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.510
And what is a behavior that
fits into this category?

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.500
It's breathing because we can say,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.020
we have tonic inputs related
to oxygen and carbon dioxide,

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.283
and ultimately, we produce
a rhythm for breathing.

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.750
I thought this would be
a rather simple problem

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:00.540
I'd solve for my PhD thesis

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.960
and then move on to other things.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.540
Well, I'm still doing
it because it turns out,

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.433
it's not as simple as we thought.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.450
Now, breathing, to me, is a critical thing

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.890
that the brain does.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:17.830
And my colleagues in Europe,
writing in a manifesto

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:20.950
about why brain research is important

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:24.677
wrote in the second
sentence of their preface,

00:04:24.677 --> 00:04:25.977
"It is more than clear to us that

00:04:25.977 --> 00:04:27.757
"our brain is extremely important to us.

00:04:27.757 --> 00:04:29.280
"It allows us to breathe."

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.350
So the first thing they
talk about the brain doing

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.460
is breathing.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.070
So breathing is fundamentally important

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.920
and it's a fundamental
thing that the brain does.

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.640
And of course, breathing, we
see throughout all of culture,

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.520
we use metaphors with
respect to breathing,

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.850
and I'm gonna give you a
clip from popular culture.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.683
- He's right.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.840
We're all on the same side.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.663
- How can we be?

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.130
- We're all breathing.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:02.470
- So we're all breathing.

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.490
And in a way, this is an unusual lecture

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.450
because I'm gonna be lecturing you

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.240
about something you're doing right now.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:11.290
It's inexorable, you can't
stop, you'll be doing it.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:13.010
It's okay if you're
self-conscious about it

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:14.100
because I think it might have

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.570
a little bit more valence
to you if you realize

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:18.790
what I'm talking about is something

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:20.740
you're actually doing right now.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.620
Now, I'm gonna intersperse
my talk with this,

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.320
which is a signal that I would like you to

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.910
take a deep, one deep breath.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.950
And that one deep breath
actually has a purpose.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.410
It'll, if you're getting
a little bit tired,

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:34.870
it'll alert you, it may actually

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:36.520
improve your cognitive function

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.980
so what I've just told you might register

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.360
a little bit more deeply,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.250
and gets you ready for the next
thing I'm gonna talk about.

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:46.420
So don't be shy when you see this.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:49.350
Now, why do we breathe?

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.300
Well, the principal
reason is we need oxygen

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.610
for the metabolism of cells.

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.543
And when we metabolize
oxygen, we produce CO2.

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.107
We use about 250 milliliters
a minute of oxygen.

00:06:02.107 --> 00:06:04.910
And that's about a fistful size of oxygen

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.110
that our bodies are using at rest.

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:10.280
But in our body, we only
have 1000 milliliters,

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:13.420
that is, we only have
a four-minute supply.

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.840
This means we have to
breathe continuously.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.190
We can't stop.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:19.570
It's inexorable because we only have

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:22.460
a four-minute supply in our blood.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.960
So we have to breathe continuously.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.050
Now, the byproduct of
this oxidative metabolism

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.670
is carbon dioxide.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.080
Carbon dioxide is very
critical in determining

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.550
the acid-base balance of the,
our body and cells, the pH.

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:40.130
And we need to exquisitely regulate that

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:44.660
because cells get very
unhappy when the pH gets off.

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:46.993
So we have to exquisitely
control breathing.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.610
Now, at the center of all
this is an organ, the lung.

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.800
And the lung expands and contracts,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.460
but the lung itself has
no muscle to do that.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:58.410
The lung is just like a balloon

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.980
and it has to be expanded and contracted

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.750
by the muscles around it.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:05.380
But it's not just one big balloon,

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:09.620
it's a balloon that has
a lot of little balloons.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.040
That is, the air comes
in through your trachea,

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.190
this one tube, and it branches,

00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:17.440
and it branches, and it
branches, and it branches.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.630
At the end, you have 500 million terminals

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:22.090
with these tiny little spheres.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.590
Each sphere is about one-hundredth
of an inch in diameter.

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:27.410
And that's where the oxygen and CO2

00:07:27.410 --> 00:07:29.600
gets into and out of the bloodstream.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.020
500 million of them, but
that's a lot of surface area.

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:35.690
It's about 70 square meters.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:37.580
Now, what that means, that's about

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:39.653
one-third the size of a tennis court.

00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.680
So at every breath, you're
expanding and relaxing

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:46.840
this rubber-like membrane

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.680
that's a third the size of a tennis court.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:53.550
In order to do that, mammals
evolved a very special muscle

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:55.300
that is able to do that.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.280
And that muscle is the diaphragm
that sits under the lung

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.750
and it pulls down about
three-quarters of an inch

00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.000
to expand the lung and then
relaxes and the air flows out.

00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.060
So there's a very special
muscle, the diaphragm,

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:11.760
and we'll talk a little
bit about that later.

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.610
Now, breathing starts in utero.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:16.500
You have to be breathing
the instant you're born,

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:19.090
so in the third trimester
you're starting to

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:22.550
engage in rhythmic activity
and your muscles move,

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:24.750
the lung gets stressed, and it's vital

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:26.990
that it works when you're born.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.060
You breathe all the time,
about 12 times a minute.

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.810
You might take 600 million
breaths in a normal lifetime.

00:08:33.810 --> 00:08:36.290
So the system has to be extremely robust

00:08:36.290 --> 00:08:38.060
and has to be reliable.

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:41.700
And, of course, if you get
arrest without interruption,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.730
without intervention,
excuse me, death results.

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.610
This could be natural causes,
it could be opiate overdose,

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:52.210
it could be injury, and,
unfortunately, nerve gasses,

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:55.060
the principal cause of death
is that they stop breathing.

00:08:56.410 --> 00:09:00.000
Breathing uses about 7%
of your body metabolism.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.110
We evolved that that's the
minimal amount of energy

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:04.750
that we can expend and still move

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.570
the amount of air we need to move.

00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:09.173
So breathing is extremely efficient.

00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.810
Now, in addition to blood gasses,

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:17.230
we use the breathing apparatus
for a lot of other things.

00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:19.990
We have reflexes to keep
the airways working,

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:23.430
coughing, sneezing, yawning, gagging.

00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:25.040
We have volitional and other behaviors,

00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.800
my ability to speak, sniffing,
during birth, spitting,

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:32.170
and if you're a rodent,
whisking seems to be

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:33.823
driven by breathing movements.

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:38.290
We have emotional movements
that are driven by breathing.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:42.050
We laugh, we cry, we sigh,
we can hyperventilate,

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:47.050
we breath hold, we gasp, and
if you're a cat you might purr.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:51.370
So these are all emotional
breathing movements.

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.120
We also know breathing can affect emotion.

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:56.650
Meditative breathing can
affect emotional state,

00:09:56.650 --> 00:09:58.730
sense of pain, cognitive function.

00:09:58.730 --> 00:10:01.650
And I'll talk about that
at the end of the talk.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:04.260
And the breathing rhythm, cycle by cycle,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.730
is everywhere throughout your body.

00:10:06.730 --> 00:10:08.720
It modulates, your pupil diameter

00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.840
oscillates with the respiratory cycle.

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.850
We don't know why, but it does.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:16.150
Your reaction time varies
with the respiratory cycle,

00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:18.930
boxers and martial artists know this.

00:10:18.930 --> 00:10:22.500
And your fear response varies
with the respiratory cycle.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.410
You're more fearful of certain things

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:26.480
during inspiration than expiration.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.530
We don't know why, but
that's just the observation.

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:30.363
Excuse me.

00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.580
And it's present in
many areas of the brain

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.310
and it's probably involved
in a lot of functions

00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:44.723
that are necessary for normal
higher function of the brain.

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.290
Now, breathing is not always perfect.

00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.590
Illness or injury can
cause changes of breathing,

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:53.610
which can cause further problems.

00:10:53.610 --> 00:10:56.130
So in a variety of
neurodegenerative diseases

00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:00.280
like Parkinson's and Alzheimer's and ALS,

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.700
commonly referred to as
Lou Gehrig's disease,

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:06.030
these diseases result
in changes in breathing

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.970
and that in itself can
cause further damage.

00:11:09.970 --> 00:11:12.850
These problems with breathing
are usually happening

00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:14.910
during sleep, so they're not noticed,

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.970
but severe problems of
breathing during sleep

00:11:16.970 --> 00:11:19.350
can affect brain function.

00:11:19.350 --> 00:11:22.010
We have what are called
single gene mutations

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:26.550
where a single gene gets mutated.

00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:28.250
And we have diseases like

00:11:28.250 --> 00:11:31.180
congenital central
hyperventilation syndrome.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:35.780
There's about 1000 kids
worldwide who have this.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.410
And they have to remember to breathe.

00:11:38.410 --> 00:11:40.530
When they fall asleep,
they stop breathing.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:43.110
So they have to be ventilated at night,

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:44.450
and if they're ventilated at night,

00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:47.330
they can grow to healthy adulthood.

00:11:47.330 --> 00:11:49.670
Rett syndrome is another disease

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.970
that affects about one in 9000
girls under the age of 12.

00:11:52.970 --> 00:11:55.680
And they have particularly emotional,

00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.180
they have emotional problems
related to breathing.

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:01.320
Insults or injuries, strokes,

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.550
spinal cord injury will affect breathing.

00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:06.980
And these other things are
actually very important.

00:12:06.980 --> 00:12:10.760
So sleep apneas affect
about 18 million Americans.

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.110
And looking at the
demographics of this audience,

00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:15.640
I would say there's a
reasonable fraction of people

00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.820
who have sleep apnea.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.200
And some of you may be undergoing

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:22.000
CPAP therapy for sleep apnea.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.120
Opiate overdose, I think
the latest number is

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:29.120
70,000 in America died last
year from opiate overdose.

00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:34.290
Sudden infant death is the
most prevalent cause of death

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.200
in infants under one years of age.

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:40.100
And the terminal event
is they stop breathing.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.510
And we have things like
panic and anxiety disorders,

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:46.703
which are associated with
severe breathlessness.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.030
Now, so we have this beautiful
machine of breathing.

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:55.590
And the question that I
asked a long time ago is,

00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:57.660
where is the engine for breathing?

00:12:57.660 --> 00:13:00.030
And of course, most of us
would probably look here,

00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:01.950
but, in fact, it's back there.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:04.400
So the engine for breathing was not

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:07.010
exactly where we thought it was.

00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:09.860
The history goes back, at
least in Western culture,

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.820
to Galen, who noted that gladiators

00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:14.700
and animals with high neck injuries

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.290
immediately stop breathing,

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.833
but if they're injured way below the neck,

00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:22.870
they continue to breathe.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.600
So there's something happening
in the area around the neck

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:28.560
that's critical for
generating breathing rhythm.

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.660
There's a big gap in the science of this.

00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:35.020
And then in the early 1800s,
LeGallois concluded that

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.570
the noeud vital, the node of life,

00:13:37.570 --> 00:13:40.410
because breathing is associated with life,

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:44.120
so the noeud vital, the vital
node, is in the brainstem.

00:13:44.120 --> 00:13:45.890
And I'll talk about where that is.

00:13:45.890 --> 00:13:50.890
In 1909, the renowned neuroanatomist
Ramon y Cajal proposed

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:53.800
a circuit for brainstem
control of breathing.

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:57.240
And in 1931, Lord Adrian showed that

00:13:57.240 --> 00:14:01.443
you can take the brainstem
out of a goldfish,

00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:05.790
put it in a dish, and it still generates

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:07.440
a rhythm of breathing.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:10.450
So it means that the rhythm
of breathing can be generated

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:11.800
within the nervous system.

00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:15.100
You don't need all that
apparatus to generate the rhythm.

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:16.960
So a little bit like the engine of a car.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:19.070
It works in the car, but
you can take the engine out

00:14:19.070 --> 00:14:21.310
and put it on a table, and hook it up,

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:22.610
and the engine will still work.

00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.960
And that's a great advantage
for if you're trying to

00:14:24.960 --> 00:14:26.683
understand how the engine works.

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:32.220
So here we have a human,
you'll see the lungs,

00:14:32.220 --> 00:14:36.360
the diaphragm, but I wanna
focus on this part of the brain

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.520
and in particular, the
brainstem, which is down here.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.147
And we discovered a region which we call

00:14:43.147 --> 00:14:45.610
the preBotzinger Complex
that in humans has

00:14:45.610 --> 00:14:48.050
about 5000 neurons.

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.387
And this is the engine for breathing.

00:14:50.387 --> 00:14:52.220
And I wanna spend a
few minutes telling you

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.593
how we discovered this.

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:59.150
So we started out by taking the brainstem

00:14:59.150 --> 00:15:02.890
and spinal cord from a newborn rat.

00:15:02.890 --> 00:15:04.630
This is a generalized preparation

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:07.320
that have been used by
Japanese investigators.

00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.460
And when you put it in a dish

00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.960
and you use a recording electrode,

00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:13.840
you can record rhythmic activity

00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:16.410
coming out of this
chunk of nervous system.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:18.840
And that rhythm activity,
if it were connected,

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.400
would be driving the respiratory muscles.

00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:22.840
So we did a simple experiment.

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.610
We said, okay, let's suppose we cut away

00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:27.630
parts of the brainstem.

00:15:27.630 --> 00:15:28.660
Does the rhythm go away?

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.680
So we make one cut, nothing happens,

00:15:30.680 --> 00:15:33.050
we make the second cut, nothing happens,

00:15:33.050 --> 00:15:36.130
a third cut, nothing happens,
but we make a fourth cut,

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:37.600
the rhythm goes away.

00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:41.640
So it says that this region
around that yellow line,

00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.960
there's something critical going on there.

00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:46.873
Then we can do the experiment
going the other direction,

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:49.970
but we have to move the electrode up.

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:51.017
So we move the electrode up

00:15:51.017 --> 00:15:54.090
and we still get this rhythmic activity,

00:15:54.090 --> 00:15:59.090
but now we can cut away the spinal cord.

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:02.690
Of course, we lose this nerve,
so there's no activity there,

00:16:02.690 --> 00:16:05.190
but we still have
activity coming out here.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:07.420
We make another cut,
we still have activity.

00:16:07.420 --> 00:16:11.060
But we make one more cut,
and the activity goes away.

00:16:11.060 --> 00:16:13.120
So it says that there's something critical

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.010
happening in this region.

00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:18.930
So what we did is, we took
a slice through this region.

00:16:18.930 --> 00:16:21.140
We just made a cut here and a cut here,

00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:23.480
and we put it in a dish, and we asked,

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.670
would we see breathing rhythm

00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:27.890
in this thin slice of brainstem?

00:16:27.890 --> 00:16:30.610
So this is what the slice looks like.

00:16:30.610 --> 00:16:34.070
And here we have these glass electrodes

00:16:34.070 --> 00:16:35.760
on the hypoglossal nerve.

00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:38.560
That's the nerve that would
normally enervate the tongue.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:41.113
And the tongue has respiratory movements.

00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:47.270
And this is a schematic
of what it looks like.

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:50.290
So here's the output
coming out the 12th nerve,

00:16:50.290 --> 00:16:51.670
the hypoglossal nerve.

00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:55.120
Here's where the neurons
are that come out the nerve.

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:58.600
But what's driving this
are cells in this region.

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.320
And we can see that by recording.

00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.890
So record from the output,
we have rhythmic outputs.

00:17:04.890 --> 00:17:06.460
This is in real time.

00:17:06.460 --> 00:17:08.040
And if we record from the neuron here,

00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:10.700
we can see that neuron
is firing rhythmically.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.183
So this is driving that.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:17.970
Now, where does the name
preBotzinger come from?

00:17:17.970 --> 00:17:20.990
Botzinger is not a famous
German neuroanatomist,

00:17:20.990 --> 00:17:24.170
as many people mistakenly think.

00:17:24.170 --> 00:17:26.690
The history goes back when we identified

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:28.280
a region in the brainstem.

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.200
So this is the brainstem.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:34.030
We identified a region
indicated by these red dots.

00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:38.800
And it had no name in any of the atlases,

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.660
the maps of the brain.

00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:45.220
And I had presented this work
at a meeting in Stockholm

00:17:45.220 --> 00:17:47.120
and had a colleague who had proposed

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.940
a different region of the brain
was critical for breathing.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.200
And he got up and he ripped me to shreds.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:56.103
It was a post-doc, it was
not particularly pleasant.

00:17:57.430 --> 00:18:00.430
A year later, we had
another meeting in Germany

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:04.490
and he gets up and he not only
confirms that this exists,

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.113
but starts taking credit
for its existence.

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:10.690
And there's a tradition in science

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:12.470
of people naming things after themselves.

00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:14.950
I was afraid they were
going to name it after him.

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:17.670
We were at a banquet,
there were about 100 of us,

00:18:17.670 --> 00:18:21.700
and I got very nervous they
were gonna name it after him,

00:18:21.700 --> 00:18:23.840
so I stood up and I said we should,

00:18:23.840 --> 00:18:26.150
if he found this great
area, we should name it.

00:18:26.150 --> 00:18:29.280
And I had no idea what to name it.

00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:31.760
And the only thing with a
name that was in front of me

00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.699
was this battle of wine.

00:18:33.699 --> 00:18:34.540
(audience laughing)

00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:37.750
And I picked up the
bottle of wine and I said,

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:39.380
we should name it after
the bottle of wine,

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:40.420
which we were all drinking.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:44.840
We were sufficiently
inebriated that it stuck.

00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.070
Now, it turns out Botzinger,

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:48.800
and we call it the Botzinger Complex,

00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:50.610
was not the place generating the rhythm,

00:18:50.610 --> 00:18:54.320
but we found another place
indicated in yellow here

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.300
that we thought was generating the rhythm.

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:00.820
And because of its proximity
to the Botzinger Complex,

00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:02.690
this had no name in the literature,

00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:04.580
and because we thought it
was the source of the rhythm,

00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.270
we named it the preBotzinger Complex.

00:19:07.270 --> 00:19:09.330
If you wanna hear the full story,

00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:12.510
I had an interview with
the BBC two years ago.

00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:17.510
And if you Google Feldman,
BBC, sighs, S-I-G-H-S,

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:19.740
you can listen to the interview

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:22.320
and it tells the story in
sort of all its gory detail.

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.820
It's sort of fun to listen to.

00:19:25.996 --> 00:19:28.040
So I'm gonna talk about
the preBotzinger Complex.

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.540
And of course, we take the slice,

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.520
that's the slice I told you about,

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.580
and if we look at the slice,
we have high magnification,

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.670
you can see these neurons are lighting up.

00:19:38.670 --> 00:19:41.980
This is a slice from a
mouse that's been engineered

00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:45.540
that whenever there's
activity in the cells,

00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:47.220
the cells light up and we can see

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:49.060
the light of them lighting up.

00:19:49.060 --> 00:19:51.020
And so you can see they
light up rhythmically.

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:54.840
And in your brainstems right
now, every time you inspire

00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.000
you have a few thousand cells lighting up

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.060
that are ultimately gonna cause
your diaphragm to contract

00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.773
and then they stop firing
and your diaphragm relaxes.

00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.270
If we silence about 10% of these neurons

00:20:08.270 --> 00:20:11.493
and we can do that by
doing some molecular magic,

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:16.330
if we look at the normal
breathing pattern in an adult rat,

00:20:16.330 --> 00:20:19.710
this awake rat, the rat's
breathing, this is one minute,

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:22.390
and now we add a drug that's gonna

00:20:22.390 --> 00:20:24.920
just turn off 10% of these neurons

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:27.370
and only that in the whole brain.

00:20:27.370 --> 00:20:32.180
It takes a minute or two
for the drug to get around

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.180
to where the preBotzinger Complex is.

00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.120
And then the animal stops breathing.

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:37.290
You get what's called apnea.

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:38.530
It literally stops breathing.

00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:40.900
The animal's awake, it stops breathing.

00:20:40.900 --> 00:20:42.780
We have to mechanically
ventilate the animal

00:20:42.780 --> 00:20:43.860
because it's not breathing.

00:20:43.860 --> 00:20:47.840
And after an hour, it
starts breathing again.

00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:51.470
So I think this demonstrates
that the preBotzinger Complex

00:20:51.470 --> 00:20:53.483
is the engine for normal breathing.

00:20:55.250 --> 00:20:58.050
Well, that's a big finding

00:20:58.050 --> 00:21:00.430
because now we know where to look.

00:21:00.430 --> 00:21:02.060
All right, time to take a deep breath

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:03.620
because we're gonna now move on

00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:06.780
to talk about rhythm generation.

00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:11.010
Oh, I put the next thing in

00:21:11.010 --> 00:21:13.470
for those people who are not scientists

00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:15.530
to understand a little bit about science.

00:21:15.530 --> 00:21:18.210
As I alluded to earlier
about the Botzinger Complex,

00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:21.110
science is not just a group
of smart men and women

00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:23.700
getting together and coming to a consensus

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.900
simply based on the data.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:26.630
It's a human endeavor.

00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:31.270
And there are many different
descriptions like this,

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.210
but this is the one by
Haldane, which I like,

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:36.040
who calls it the four stages of truth.

00:21:36.040 --> 00:21:37.800
You propose a new idea.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.250
The first thing that happens is

00:21:39.250 --> 00:21:41.880
the colleagues who have a vested
interest in something else

00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:44.060
say, this is worthless nonsense.

00:21:44.060 --> 00:21:47.160
That happened with the
preBotzinger Complex.

00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:50.140
This is an interesting but
perverse point of view.

00:21:50.140 --> 00:21:52.730
So they transform a bit, they accept that

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:55.870
the data may be right, but it's perverse.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:58.350
Then, this is true but quite unimportant.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.523
And then finally, they
said, I always said so.

00:22:00.523 --> 00:22:02.300
(audience laughing)

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.810
And although it's nice when
they get around to this point,

00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:07.620
you then, they position themselves

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:08.530
so they get in front of you

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.130
and you wanna get your
full credit for this.

00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:12.860
So this happened with
the Botzinger Complex.

00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:15.380
The preBotzinger Complex,
it took about 10 years

00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:16.940
to win over people.

00:22:16.940 --> 00:22:19.550
And it was a big battle
that we had with people

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:22.123
to try and get them to see the data.

00:22:23.670 --> 00:22:26.920
Okay, so let's talk
about rhythm generation.

00:22:26.920 --> 00:22:28.823
What are the usual suspects?

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:36.700
The most obvious idea
to most of us scientists

00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:38.480
is that it's a pacemaker neuron.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.100
So we know the heart is
driven by cells that,

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:46.530
if they were totally isolated,
would generate a rhythm.

00:22:46.530 --> 00:22:49.250
They have special properties,
they generate a rhythm,

00:22:49.250 --> 00:22:51.010
so why not breathing?

00:22:51.010 --> 00:22:53.730
Breathing has to be just
as reliable as the heart.

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.610
So you have these neurons
which are called pacemakers.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:59.010
So pacemaker neurons are
the kernel of breathing

00:22:59.010 --> 00:22:59.857
was the idea.

00:22:59.857 --> 00:23:03.170
That's a seductive idea that doesn't work.

00:23:03.170 --> 00:23:05.910
So this was stuck in the literature

00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.330
and we found pacemaker neurons
in the preBotzinger Complex,

00:23:09.330 --> 00:23:12.060
so that seemed to be
consistent with this idea.

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:15.800
Then we designed an experiment
with Christopher Donegro

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.580
where we blocked the pacemaker activity.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:20.770
So we got rid of the pacemakers.

00:23:20.770 --> 00:23:23.400
And the rhythm continued.

00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:26.490
So here's the rhythm
under control conditions

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:27.837
and then we get rid of pacemakers

00:23:27.837 --> 00:23:29.840
and we still have a rhythm.

00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.440
The amplitude is down a little bit,

00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:32.520
but that's not the point.

00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:34.640
The point is that the rhythm persists

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.370
in the absence of these pacemaker cells.

00:23:37.370 --> 00:23:39.930
So if it's not pacemakers,
maybe it's inhibition.

00:23:39.930 --> 00:23:42.000
So here's another favorite idea.

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000
The idea being is that
you start the activity,

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.020
the activity grows and
it grows and it grows

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:48.800
and then you reach a trigger point

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.240
and then some massive sort of inhibition

00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.720
sort of slams the door.

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:55.230
And that's how you get the cycle going.

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:57.490
And in the nervous system,
that slamming the door

00:23:57.490 --> 00:23:58.890
would be done by inhibition.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:02.350
And we know inhibition is important.

00:24:02.350 --> 00:24:06.080
So here we can excite
preBotzinger inhibitory neurons.

00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:10.000
So we just, we engineer the mice

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.370
so they have in the inhibitory neurons

00:24:12.370 --> 00:24:17.083
a special channel called channelrhodopsin

00:24:17.083 --> 00:24:21.193
that when you shine
light, excites the cells.

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.370
So when we excite the inhibitory cells,

00:24:26.370 --> 00:24:27.980
the animal stops breathing.

00:24:27.980 --> 00:24:30.680
So those inhibitory
cells can do something.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:33.790
The thing is, are they critical
for the breathing rhythm?

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.540
So we did another experiment.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.690
So this would be the
control, and this is just

00:24:37.690 --> 00:24:41.380
the cartoon to say we have
excitation and inhibition.

00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:45.230
And we record, this is in a rat,

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.570
and you can see the animal
is breathing quite fine.

00:24:47.570 --> 00:24:50.120
This is their breathing effort.

00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:52.440
Now we block inhibition.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.890
What happens?

00:24:53.890 --> 00:24:56.650
Theory would predict you'd have no rhythm.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:24:58.600
But in fact, you do have a rhythm.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:25:01.440
It's slower, and the reason it's slower

00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.550
because some of the things that

00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:06.030
inhibition does is regulate the timing,

00:25:06.030 --> 00:25:08.750
but it's not critical for
generating the rhythm.

00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.160
So we have to throw that out.

00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.540
The rhythm persists and
inhibition is not necessary.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.470
So if it's not pacemakers
and it's not inhibition,

00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.400
maybe it's bursting.

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.570
Now, what do I mean by bursting?

00:25:21.570 --> 00:25:23.720
Well, if anyone knows the score

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.010
they could probably scream it out,

00:25:25.010 --> 00:25:28.410
but you know, if you were
sitting outside Dodgers Stadium,

00:25:28.410 --> 00:25:30.570
could you figure out
the rules of baseball?

00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:33.940
So you have your mobile
phone in hand and you notice,

00:25:33.940 --> 00:25:36.553
every time there's a big
scream from the crowd,

00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:39.420
the score goes up.

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:42.070
And you notice this is consistently.

00:25:42.070 --> 00:25:44.630
So you form a hypothesis.

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:46.010
The screaming of the crowd is

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.881
what's causing the runs to go up.

00:25:47.881 --> 00:25:49.220
(audience laughing)

00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:51.090
Reasonable hypothesis.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.890
You know, a lot of what we do
with the brain is like that.

00:25:52.890 --> 00:25:54.360
We're standing outside the stadium,

00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:56.730
trying to figure out
what's going on inside.

00:25:56.730 --> 00:25:59.050
Then one day, the Dodgers have a game,

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:01.810
but there's no, the
public is not allowed in.

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:03.260
And you're watching on your cell phone,

00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:05.780
standing outside the
stadium, and you notice that

00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:10.780
the score keeps incrementing
and there's no crowd.

00:26:11.010 --> 00:26:13.040
So you say, the crowd is not necessary

00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:15.720
for generating the rhythm.

00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:18.470
Doesn't tell you what is,
but it says the crowd is not.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:20.507
So when we think about breathing,

00:26:20.507 --> 00:26:22.890
what's the most noticeable
thing about breathing?

00:26:22.890 --> 00:26:25.980
The most obvious thing is
these inspiratory efforts

00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.950
that you're making every breath.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:31.619
So something related to
driving that inspiratory effort

00:26:31.619 --> 00:26:35.310
must be critical for
generating the rhythm.

00:26:35.310 --> 00:26:36.763
So we did an experiment.

00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:43.500
And we call this the burst hypothesis.

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.670
That is, if we look at the diaphragm,

00:26:45.670 --> 00:26:48.877
the diaphragm generates
these inspiratory bursts.

00:26:48.877 --> 00:26:51.247
If you look in the preBotzinger Complex,

00:26:51.247 --> 00:26:54.700
the preBotzinger Complex is
also generating these bursts

00:26:54.700 --> 00:26:58.037
and the causality is the
bursts here drive those bursts.

00:26:58.037 --> 00:27:00.620
But we also noticed that
there's some activity

00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:02.750
preceding the bursts which we call

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.673
the preinspiratory
activity, or the burstlet,

00:27:06.515 --> 00:27:07.883
that's not present here.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.003
So we did an experiment.

00:27:12.670 --> 00:27:15.050
We recorded from the preBotzinger Complex

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:17.860
and they hypoglossal nerve
in one of these slices.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:20.190
And we get these bursts of activity

00:27:20.190 --> 00:27:21.550
in the hypoglossal nerve,

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:23.760
we get these bursts in the preBotzinger,

00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.730
and you see that it's one to one.

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:27.670
Every time there's a
burst in the preBotzinger,

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.270
it drives a burst in the hypoglossal.

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.960
This is consistent with a burst hypothesis

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.970
for rhythmogenesis.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:38.050
Now we do it under conditions
of lower excitability

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:39.710
and we notice that every time there's

00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:42.140
a burst in the hypoglossal,

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:43.500
there's a burst in preBotzinger.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:47.200
So that's consistent of these
bursts driving these bursts.

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:49.330
But if we look more
carefully at the activity

00:27:49.330 --> 00:27:52.210
in the preBotzinger Complex,
and what I mean by activity,

00:27:52.210 --> 00:27:54.837
this is the sum of all
the activity going on

00:27:54.837 --> 00:27:57.610
in all the thousand neurons,

00:27:57.610 --> 00:28:00.720
you see these little things
which we call burstlets.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:01.850
And if you look carefully,

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.170
it looks like they're keeping time.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:06.370
And you can see that more clearly here.

00:28:06.370 --> 00:28:08.400
So here are two consecutive bursts,

00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:10.690
two consecutive bursts in preBotzinger.

00:28:10.690 --> 00:28:13.310
Now, where the bursts are
a little further apart,

00:28:13.310 --> 00:28:16.220
we notice that when we
would've expected a burst

00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.250
there's one of these burstlets.

00:28:18.250 --> 00:28:20.390
Here they're further and further apart

00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:22.090
and we have two of the burstlets.

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:24.600
And here we have three,
and they're all coming

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.350
when you expect them to come.

00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:29.497
So the simplest conclusion here is that

00:28:30.397 --> 00:28:33.440
this is what's really
generating the rhythm.

00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:38.053
Now, you might say, gee,
this is all negative stuff.

00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:41.280
Why don't you tell me something positive?

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.070
But you have to understand
that in doing science.

00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:45.720
You don't know the answer beforehand

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:48.220
and you go after the usual suspects.

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.520
But sometimes we're like the drunk

00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:52.420
who's looking under the lamppost.

00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:54.630
And you say to the drunk,
what are you looking for?

00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:57.780
And the drunk says, I'm
looking for my keys.

00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:59.780
And you say, oh, you
dropped your keys there?

00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:01.290
He says, no, I dropped them in the bushes,

00:29:01.290 --> 00:29:03.010
but the light is here.

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:06.560
And so as scientists, we
go where the light is.

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.490
The light looked like it was pacemakers,

00:29:08.490 --> 00:29:09.790
it looked like it was inhibition,

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:11.360
it looked like it was bursting.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.290
It's not, so we begin now
to look in other places.

00:29:14.290 --> 00:29:16.040
We go look in the bushes.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:19.483
And when we look in the bushes,

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:26.573
and these burstlets are
generating the rhythm,

00:29:27.990 --> 00:29:29.880
what is the mechanism underlying it?

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.490
And our current hypothesis,
it's the network.

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:35.580
This is one of the hot
topics now in neuroscience

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:37.700
is how neurons are interacting.

00:29:37.700 --> 00:29:40.690
So here's the experiment:
we have this bursting,

00:29:40.690 --> 00:29:42.930
it's about 1000 neurons in each burst,

00:29:42.930 --> 00:29:46.130
and we said, what
happens if we can trigger

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:49.920
just a few neurons, one, two, three, five?

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:52.263
Would that be enough to initiate a burst?

00:29:54.010 --> 00:29:57.573
And then, if we can initiate
the burst, what's the delay?

00:29:58.510 --> 00:30:02.040
And with our colleagues in
Paris, Valentina Emiliani,

00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:03.720
we were able to do this experiment.

00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:06.870
It was very, her technology
was very sophisticated.

00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:08.390
And the way it worked is,

00:30:08.390 --> 00:30:11.310
here's a blown-up of the
preBotzinger Complex.

00:30:11.310 --> 00:30:13.610
And you can see the yellow cells there.

00:30:13.610 --> 00:30:18.000
And under a microscope,
we identify the cells.

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.480
And then using some chemical magic,

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:25.760
we use a laser to stimulate the cells.

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.450
So we can only stimulate one,
two, three, four, five cells.

00:30:28.450 --> 00:30:32.340
And what we found was
that, if we stimulate

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:35.190
only three cells at this point,

00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:37.840
at some delay, we get a burst.

00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:39.663
With only three cells.

00:30:40.810 --> 00:30:43.010
If we stimulate three more cells,

00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:45.420
we get a burst, and it's
a little bit sooner.

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:48.910
And if we stimulate nine
cells, it's even sooner.

00:30:48.910 --> 00:30:51.890
But we only need a few cells to do that.

00:30:51.890 --> 00:30:56.890
And what is particularly
intriguing is how long it takes.

00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.100
Okay, in neural terms, this is like

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.320
three-tenths of a second, that's forever.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.810
And what is happening?

00:31:04.810 --> 00:31:07.290
So what we think is happening is that

00:31:07.290 --> 00:31:09.730
the activity sort of
starts with a few cells

00:31:09.730 --> 00:31:11.900
and because of the way the network,

00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.130
nature builds the network,

00:31:14.130 --> 00:31:16.540
the activity doesn't immediately explode,

00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:18.270
but it sort of percolates.

00:31:18.270 --> 00:31:20.420
And it percolates and it grows slowly

00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:22.410
and then all of the sudden explodes.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:26.350
And we proposed this idea,
which is one of those ideas

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:29.930
which many of our colleagues
thinks are totally crazy,

00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:34.930
and Sufi Arshad in the lab
now has experimental data

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:38.040
that's entirely consistent with this idea

00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.640
and we're very excited
about this possibility

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:43.660
as being critical for
generating breathing rhythm.

00:31:43.660 --> 00:31:44.923
So it's the network.

00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.360
Now we thought we had this done.

00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:58.000
We found the engine.

00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:00.370
But then we had some
anomalous experiments.

00:32:00.370 --> 00:32:03.210
And the mindset was sort of followed

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:05.290
by this article in the New York Times.

00:32:05.290 --> 00:32:07.547
And it was A Romance Gone Sour.

00:32:07.547 --> 00:32:09.127
"And since the way she breathes,

00:32:09.127 --> 00:32:11.147
"exhalation following inhalation,

00:32:11.147 --> 00:32:13.863
"has already gotten on your
nerves after 24 hours."

00:32:13.863 --> 00:32:14.810
(audience laughing)

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:17.560
We think of breathing as
like inspiration, expiration,

00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:20.530
one has to follow the other,
one has to follow the other,

00:32:20.530 --> 00:32:23.210
it's like day and night, they
have to follow each other.

00:32:23.210 --> 00:32:25.370
Turns out, that's not the case.

00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:28.340
So okay, I'm gonna show
you some real data.

00:32:28.340 --> 00:32:30.063
So here's a rat breathing.

00:32:31.350 --> 00:32:34.670
Down is expiration, up is inspiration.

00:32:34.670 --> 00:32:36.790
So it's expiration, inspiration.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:39.760
And this is expiratory muscle activity.

00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.080
So it sees the expiratory
muscle activity is very rhythmic

00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:45.150
and the inspiration is very rhythmic.

00:32:45.150 --> 00:32:48.140
This is normal breathing, quite,

00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:50.790
maybe you might say uninteresting.

00:32:50.790 --> 00:32:52.850
But if we give this animal fentanyl,

00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:55.720
which is an opiate agonist,
watch what happens.

00:32:55.720 --> 00:32:59.330
Expiration, inspiration,
expiration, no inspiration.

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:03.260
Expiration, inspiration, now watch this.

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:08.260
Expiration, no inspiration,
expiration, no inspiration,

00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:12.450
expiration, inspiration.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:15.283
And you notice, the
expiration is constant.

00:33:16.300 --> 00:33:17.410
So what's going on?

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:20.400
Well, several years of experiments

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.610
and we came to the conclusion that

00:33:21.610 --> 00:33:23.333
there were two oscillators.

00:33:27.213 --> 00:33:28.870
So we have the preBotzinger Complex

00:33:28.870 --> 00:33:30.980
and we discovered that
this other oscillator

00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:35.010
is sitting nearby in a region
called the paraFacial Nucleus.

00:33:35.010 --> 00:33:38.210
It's not in exactly the
same place, but it's nearby.

00:33:38.210 --> 00:33:40.593
And we did the following experiment.

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.580
We recorded under
conditions where you have

00:33:44.580 --> 00:33:47.190
inspiratory activity and
no expiratory activity.

00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:50.550
Now, I should say, at rest here,

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:52.300
it's just inspiratory activity for you.

00:33:52.300 --> 00:33:53.920
There's no expiratory activity.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:56.410
You're totally passive at expiration.

00:33:56.410 --> 00:33:58.670
It's only when you need
to drive lots of air,

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.900
like when you exercise,
that you actively expire.

00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:05.030
So it turns out that if we excite

00:34:05.030 --> 00:34:07.440
these neurons in the paraFacial region,

00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:10.780
and we do this by using this genetic tool

00:34:10.780 --> 00:34:13.800
of channelrhodopsin,
we shine a laser light,

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:17.660
and what happens is, we
turn on expiratory activity.

00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:19.660
We have inspiration, expiration,
inspiration, expiration,

00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:22.660
and then when we turn
the light off, it stops.

00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.900
So we have lots of data now

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.510
that we have these two oscillators

00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:28.470
and they normally talk to each other,

00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:30.140
they're very tightly coordinated.

00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:33.100
The expiratory one is normally turned off,

00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.523
but we turn it on when
we need to turn it on.

00:34:37.240 --> 00:34:38.990
Now, why have separate oscillators?

00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.240
Well, if you're a
non-mammalian vertebrate,

00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.260
they done have diaphragms,
they have simple lungs.

00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.180
In other words, they don't have

00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.140
70 square meters of lung space.

00:34:49.140 --> 00:34:51.320
It's very, very limited,
so they can only pass

00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:53.070
a limited amount of oxygen,

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:55.110
they can only support being cold-blooded,

00:34:55.110 --> 00:34:56.810
and their brains are a lot smaller.

00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:00.973
Our brains are extremely
demanding of oxygen, continuously.

00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:04.710
So they can't make inspiratory efforts

00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:06.350
because they don't have a diaphragm,

00:35:06.350 --> 00:35:09.650
and they have an oscillator that drives

00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:11.800
their expiratory-dominated movements.

00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:13.620
Now, we evolve into mammals.

00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:15.860
Mammals are the only class of vertebrates

00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:17.400
that have a diaphragm.

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.730
So we now develop these lungs

00:35:19.730 --> 00:35:24.730
that can produce a lot of
oxygen, move a lot of oxygen.

00:35:25.610 --> 00:35:28.180
And we have a diaphragm,
we have complex lungs,

00:35:28.180 --> 00:35:31.420
we can be warm-blooded,
and we have big brains

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.040
that are demanding of oxygen all the time.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.470
So powerful inspiratory efforts
are needed and possible.

00:35:37.470 --> 00:35:39.940
And our hypothesis is
that a new oscillator,

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:43.350
the preBotzinger Complex,
to drive the diaphragm

00:35:43.350 --> 00:35:45.340
that couples to the old
expiratory oscillator.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:46.990
That's the one in the paraFacial.

00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:52.330
So we have this core system
of the preBotzinger Complex

00:35:52.330 --> 00:35:55.540
and the parafacial,
they talk to each other,

00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:00.400
and then each one drives
either inspiratory muscles

00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:04.660
or expiratory muscles.

00:36:04.660 --> 00:36:08.863
And so this is the core for
generating breathing movements.

00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:13.740
Now, one of the
interesting aspects of this

00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:16.250
is that whereas we think brain function

00:36:16.250 --> 00:36:18.700
in mammals of all different sizes

00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:21.030
sort of acts on the same time scale,

00:36:21.030 --> 00:36:22.830
that learning and memory and perception

00:36:22.830 --> 00:36:25.880
is the same time scale,
when we look at breathing,

00:36:25.880 --> 00:36:30.880
a mouse will breathe up
to 300 times a minute,

00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:35.220
a whale that's not diving
will breathe once a minute.

00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.460
So what is it about the
nervous system that's changed

00:36:38.460 --> 00:36:41.170
that you go over a factor of 300

00:36:41.170 --> 00:36:43.070
in how the rhythm is generated?

00:36:43.070 --> 00:36:45.880
It's not simply the animals are bigger.

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:48.550
There's something going
on, and at some point

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:50.850
we hope to discover what that is.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:53.433
But I'm going to leave this
as an unsolved problem.

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:58.070
So the summary here is,
we're inspiratory breathers.

00:36:58.070 --> 00:36:59.820
Expiration is passive at rest.

00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:02.313
And we have two oscillators:
one for inspiration,

00:37:02.313 --> 00:37:04.973
one for expiration.

00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:15.100
I'm going to talk to you about sighing.

00:37:15.100 --> 00:37:16.711
You all know what sighing is.

00:37:16.711 --> 00:37:17.544
(sighing)

00:37:17.544 --> 00:37:19.490
They're these deep breaths that you take.

00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:22.900
The story basically starts with

00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:26.910
the widespread use of iron lungs.

00:37:26.910 --> 00:37:29.200
When they were first used,

00:37:29.200 --> 00:37:32.650
individuals were ventilated
at normal lung volumes

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.823
and there was high mortality rates.

00:37:35.860 --> 00:37:40.860
Then they decided to ventilate
at slightly higher volumes,

00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:44.670
and there's lower mortality.

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:48.080
Then in the '50s, they discovered
what really was necessary

00:37:48.080 --> 00:37:52.010
was just to have an
occasional large breath.

00:37:52.010 --> 00:37:53.510
Now, why is that?

00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:56.140
Well, remember I said there
were 500 million alveoli,

00:37:56.140 --> 00:37:58.790
each less than a hundredth
of an inch in diameter?

00:37:58.790 --> 00:38:02.440
They're like balloons
that are fluid-lined.

00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:04.860
They have a probability of collapsing.

00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.720
And if you've ever tried
to inflate a wet balloon,

00:38:07.720 --> 00:38:08.553
it's very hard.

00:38:08.553 --> 00:38:10.840
You've gotta (blowing
out breath), pop it open.

00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:12.960
So a normal breath doesn't pop it open.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.380
A sigh does.

00:38:14.380 --> 00:38:16.280
So if you sigh every five minutes,

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.160
and all of you are sighing
every couple of minutes,

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:22.490
it pops open the alveoli
that have collapsed

00:38:22.490 --> 00:38:23.870
during that five minutes.

00:38:23.870 --> 00:38:25.440
But if you're prevented from sighing

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.500
for an extended period of time,

00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:30.580
lots of these alveoli would collapse

00:38:30.580 --> 00:38:34.440
and your ability to exchange
oxygen would decline.

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:38.313
And if you're stuck in an
iron lung, you could die.

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:44.490
Now, a colleague of
mine, Victor Yancheski,

00:38:44.490 --> 00:38:47.030
was reading that when you're stressed,

00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:48.140
your sigh rate goes up.

00:38:48.140 --> 00:38:50.450
We know when we're anxious we sigh more.

00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:53.700
But it also turns out that
we release these peptides

00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.720
from a region called the hypothalamus.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.290
And he thought that
maybe these were related.

00:38:58.290 --> 00:39:00.960
So bombesin is cheap.

00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:04.420
And I said to him, well,
why don't we just buy some

00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:06.020
and see what happens?

00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:07.240
And we did, and when we inject it

00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:10.240
into the preBotzinger
Complex of adult rats,

00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.580
it increased their sigh rate

00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:14.570
from 25 per hour to 250 per hour.

00:39:14.570 --> 00:39:18.370
10 times, without changing
their regular breathing pattern.

00:39:18.370 --> 00:39:19.780
So we were on to something.

00:39:19.780 --> 00:39:22.020
Now we asked, what happens if we kill

00:39:22.020 --> 00:39:25.090
the subset of neurons in
the preBotzinger Complex

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:27.203
that have these receptors?

00:39:29.390 --> 00:39:31.890
And so here's a control rat.

00:39:31.890 --> 00:39:34.690
It's sighing about 25 per minute.

00:39:34.690 --> 00:39:37.370
We now add this toxin that only kills

00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:40.180
cells that have the
bombesin receptor, BBN.

00:39:40.180 --> 00:39:43.260
After three days, the
sigh rate is way down.

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:45.710
The animal's still breathing
normally otherwise.

00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:48.840
After five days, the sigh
rate is way, way down.

00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.470
And then at that point, there
are problems with the lungs

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:55.423
because of all the alveolar collapse.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.050
Now, we have let this data
sit on the shelf for a while.

00:40:00.050 --> 00:40:02.970
And through interactions
with Kevin Yackle,

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:05.240
who as an undergraduate at UCLA,

00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.760
actually heard a lecture of mine,

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:09.450
got interested in breathing
when he went to Stanford,

00:40:09.450 --> 00:40:12.890
did some extremely interesting
things about breathing,

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:16.590
discovered that there was
a tiny population of cells,

00:40:16.590 --> 00:40:20.550
which you can't see here,
that have one of these,

00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:24.470
that express the peptide,
one of the bombesin peptides.

00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:26.880
And if you look around
the facial nucleus here,

00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.490
here's a blowup, you see these red cells.

00:40:29.490 --> 00:40:31.080
And if you look throughout
the entire brain,

00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:33.640
that's about the only place you find them.

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:37.080
Here's a picture looking
from the ventral surface.

00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:38.130
It would be like you were looking

00:40:38.130 --> 00:40:39.690
at the brain from this side.

00:40:39.690 --> 00:40:42.410
And you can see the cells
and the green dots here.

00:40:42.410 --> 00:40:43.833
So they're very localized.

00:40:46.110 --> 00:40:49.110
If you inject the peptides
into the preBotzinger Complex,

00:40:49.110 --> 00:40:50.600
it turns out the neurons that have

00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.790
the receptors for these peptides,

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:56.060
that listen to the peptides,
are in preBotzinger Complex.

00:40:56.060 --> 00:40:59.150
Here's an animal sighing, these are sighs.

00:40:59.150 --> 00:41:01.010
So that's sighing about once per minute,

00:41:01.010 --> 00:41:02.230
once per two minutes.

00:41:02.230 --> 00:41:06.220
If you inject the peptides,
the sigh rate goes way up.

00:41:06.220 --> 00:41:08.680
This is five different rats.

00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:13.680
If you inject and you block the receptors,

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:16.780
the sigh rate goes way, way down.

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.750
So we've established
a very simple circuit.

00:41:18.750 --> 00:41:23.500
This is rather unusual, that
in the brain we can establish

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:27.120
such a simple circuit for a fundamental

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.770
and critical behavior
that's ongoing all the time.

00:41:29.770 --> 00:41:32.270
We have about 230 neurons here,

00:41:32.270 --> 00:41:34.320
while rats have about 230 neurons here

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:36.280
and about 250 neurons there.

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:39.000
And that is driving sighing.

00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:41.240
What is the rhythmogenic
mechanism for sighing?

00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.040
We have no idea.

00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.270
But we're very interested in finding out.

00:41:46.270 --> 00:41:48.860
Now, one nice thing about this paper,

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.080
when we published it, it went viral.

00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:55.590
And so we had the usual
suspects write about it.

00:41:55.590 --> 00:41:57.960
The Guardian wrote
something very straight-up,

00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:00.840
the Washington Post wrote
something very straight-up,

00:42:00.840 --> 00:42:05.464
NPR got cute, and a lot of
outlets got very cute about this

00:42:05.464 --> 00:42:06.573
because it's a sigh.

00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:10.090
But perhaps the thing
I'm most proud of is that

00:42:10.090 --> 00:42:12.200
the Onion wrote about it.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.530
It has been found that nerve
cells within the brainstem

00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:17.230
regulate sighing to 12 times per hour.

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:20.810
So I really think now we've
sort of sent out our message,

00:42:20.810 --> 00:42:22.650
if it's in the Onion.

00:42:22.650 --> 00:42:24.963
And it gave me a lot of cred with my sons.

00:42:28.740 --> 00:42:30.930
So the summary for this section is,

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:34.150
we must sigh all of the
time, due to a simple circuit

00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:36.014
involving the preBotzinger Complex

00:42:36.014 --> 00:42:37.563
and the paraFacial Nucleus.

00:42:39.325 --> 00:42:43.100
(sighing)
(audience laughing)

00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.060
Not supposed to laugh,

00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:45.330
you're supposed to take a deep breath.

00:42:45.330 --> 00:42:46.823
You can laugh, that's okay.

00:42:49.030 --> 00:42:50.490
A brief interlude about opiates.

00:42:50.490 --> 00:42:52.670
Opiates, lots of people are dying,

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.470
it's a big public health problem.

00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:56.760
70,000 last year.

00:42:56.760 --> 00:42:59.200
Most deaths are due to
depression of breathing.

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:02.460
Can we make a safe formulation
of a prescription opioid?

00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:07.460
And the idea is, we found, the
background is, we found that

00:43:09.360 --> 00:43:12.890
opiate receptors are in
preBotzinger neurons.

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:15.970
So that makes a logical place that

00:43:15.970 --> 00:43:18.150
when someone takes an opioid,

00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:19.670
it's not only going to go to places

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:22.150
that are involved in pain,
but also affect breathing

00:43:22.150 --> 00:43:23.660
by depressing breathing.

00:43:23.660 --> 00:43:27.680
So we can imagine a region
that's important in pain,

00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:29.660
like the periaqueductal gray,

00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:32.090
the opioid receptors go
there and block pain.

00:43:32.090 --> 00:43:36.040
They also go to the
preBotzinger Complex and block,

00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:39.830
depress breathing to the point
that someone can asphyxiate.

00:43:39.830 --> 00:43:42.010
So is there some way we can block it?

00:43:42.010 --> 00:43:44.860
So we have a, we just submitted a grant,

00:43:44.860 --> 00:43:49.150
because we have an idea that
was originally demonstrated

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:52.740
or proof of principle in 2003
of a colleague who showed

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:56.030
they can block the actions
here, but not there.

00:43:56.030 --> 00:44:00.580
Unfortunately, in the human
trial the drug did not work.

00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:03.380
And we think we understand
why and we're hoping to

00:44:03.380 --> 00:44:06.143
get money from the NIH to look at this.

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:11.750
So by counteracting opiate actions

00:44:11.750 --> 00:44:15.710
in the preBotzinger Complex,
it's possible for safer drugs,

00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:17.423
safer for pain management.

00:44:22.570 --> 00:44:23.713
Breathing and emotion.

00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:29.070
We had a review recently
and this is the cover

00:44:29.070 --> 00:44:32.100
that they put on it of a meditating mouse.

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:36.360
And in fact, our interests are
such that we have a grant to

00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:41.000
teach mice and rats to
breathe slowly on command

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.890
to try and understand how
this is adducing the effects

00:44:44.890 --> 00:44:48.660
we know that breathing can
adduce on emotion and pain.

00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.740
So they're called the
breathe in, breathe out,

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.363
the neurocontrol of respiration.

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:57.400
And how can breathing
affect emotional state?

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.610
Well, there's a variety of ways,

00:44:58.610 --> 00:45:00.450
but I'm just going to mention two.

00:45:00.450 --> 00:45:03.350
One is a direct projection
from preBotzinger Complex,

00:45:03.350 --> 00:45:06.070
affecting regions involved in emotion.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:09.750
But what I'm gonna talk to
you now is about a projection,

00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:12.520
once again by Kevin Yackle, Mark Krasnow,

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:14.880
and our colleagues up at Stanford,

00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:17.243
that identified to go from
the preBotzinger Complex

00:45:17.243 --> 00:45:19.573
to a region called locus coeruleus.

00:45:21.580 --> 00:45:23.670
Locus coeruleus is a very special region

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:25.640
because from the locus coeruleus,

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.650
you have projections going
throughout the entire brain.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:31.430
And we found neurons in
the preBotzinger Complex

00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:32.630
that project here.

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:36.880
And through some molecular
magic, Kevin was able to

00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:40.970
kill the small population
of preBotzinger neurons

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:42.610
that projected there,

00:45:42.610 --> 00:45:45.040
but left the rest of
the preBotzinger intact.

00:45:45.040 --> 00:45:47.910
And what happened is that the animals

00:45:47.910 --> 00:45:49.920
seemed to be perfectly normal.

00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:52.420
When he looked at it more carefully,

00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.830
ablating the preBotzinger Cdh neurons

00:45:55.830 --> 00:45:59.100
projecting to locus
coeruleus, it slows breathing.

00:45:59.100 --> 00:46:04.100
So if you look at the distribution
of breathing frequencies

00:46:04.930 --> 00:46:09.930
in a mouse as it grooms, as
it, just during wakefulness,

00:46:10.650 --> 00:46:14.090
as it stays still, as it
roams around the cage,

00:46:14.090 --> 00:46:16.020
this is the distribution.

00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:19.130
After we kill the Cdh9
cells, you could see that

00:46:19.130 --> 00:46:21.543
the animal is breathing slower.

00:46:22.710 --> 00:46:24.980
Now, associated with the slower breathing,

00:46:24.980 --> 00:46:27.130
if you look at the behavior,

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:30.360
and you measure electrical
activity in the brain,

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:32.053
the mice appear calmer.

00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:36.390
So we put together the
story that this may be a way

00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:39.610
that breathing is
influencing emotional state.

00:46:39.610 --> 00:46:42.240
And in this case, the animals are calmer.

00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:45.050
Now, this, you can see how,

00:46:45.050 --> 00:46:47.350
the profound effects in
preBotzinger Complex.

00:46:47.350 --> 00:46:50.380
So here's a side view
of the brain of a rat.

00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:52.680
The head is here, the tail is there.

00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:54.610
Here's the preBotzinger Complex.

00:46:54.610 --> 00:46:57.860
The green is the projections
from the preBotzinger Complex,

00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.570
which goes to a lot of places.

00:46:59.570 --> 00:47:02.040
But what I want you to
look at is this orange,

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.680
which is going to locus coeruleus.

00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.290
And from locus coeruleus,
it goes to the whole brain.

00:47:06.290 --> 00:47:08.420
So that's a potential entryway

00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:10.720
for breathing to affect the whole brain.

00:47:10.720 --> 00:47:12.973
And we're busy investigating this now.

00:47:13.930 --> 00:47:16.750
Now, this paper also went viral.

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:20.563
And it had one extremely positive effect.

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:23.430
Shortly after this
appeared, I got a phone call

00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:26.240
from a colleague in a
department of psychiatry,

00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:31.240
Helen Lavretsky, and Helen
uses breathing exercises

00:47:33.010 --> 00:47:37.670
for helping people who
are at risk for dementia

00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:40.380
and caretakers for people with dementia

00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:42.370
who are under a lot of stress.

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:44.980
And she was looking to put together

00:47:44.980 --> 00:47:47.210
a overall research program,

00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:49.780
and asked us if we'd be interested.

00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.200
And of course, we were.

00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:53.490
And together with Helen, we are trying to

00:47:53.490 --> 00:47:55.680
put together a center to study

00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:58.200
the relationship between
breathing and emotion,

00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.350
where we can get to the
very basic mechanisms

00:48:01.350 --> 00:48:04.340
and she can look at, she and
her colleagues can look at

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:08.913
mechanisms involved in the
brain at large in humans.

00:48:09.970 --> 00:48:13.010
So we have this core
circuit for breathing.

00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:16.290
This core circuit for breathing is

00:48:16.290 --> 00:48:18.700
interacting with other movements.

00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:21.880
So we have to coordinate
breathing with speech.

00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:22.727
In order for me to speak to you,

00:48:22.727 --> 00:48:25.890
I have to coordinate
the expiratory airflow

00:48:25.890 --> 00:48:27.520
with the fact that in need to take air in

00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:30.520
on a regular basis so I don't pass out.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.090
We need to stop breathing when we swallow,

00:48:33.090 --> 00:48:36.183
chewing, so there's coordination here.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.900
We also have these, what we
call the ascending inputs

00:48:39.900 --> 00:48:41.920
to places like locus coeruleus,

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:44.280
that are gonna coordinate with and affect

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:47.460
emotion, cognitive function,
and sensory function.

00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:50.000
And then we have these descending inputs,

00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.470
which are related to
the emotional expression

00:48:53.470 --> 00:48:56.813
of laughing, crying, and so on.

00:49:00.130 --> 00:49:03.793
Now I'm gonna end with
another popular quote.

00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:07.570
I presume most of you
are familiar with this.

00:49:07.570 --> 00:49:12.570
It was written by a Swedish
author, who was educated by

00:49:13.990 --> 00:49:17.150
my neuroscientist colleagues in Stockholm.

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:20.250
And I congratulated them because

00:49:20.250 --> 00:49:23.220
in this book, he talks about the brain.

00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:25.217
And he says, "she had a talent

00:49:25.217 --> 00:49:27.157
"for irritating the other employees.

00:49:27.157 --> 00:49:30.167
"she became known as 'the
girl with two brain cells'

00:49:30.167 --> 00:49:32.870
"one for breathing and
one for standing up."

00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:37.300
So just like the European Brain Council,

00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:38.687
which mentioned breathing as one of

00:49:38.687 --> 00:49:40.790
the most critical things the brain does,

00:49:40.790 --> 00:49:43.417
here, Elizabeth Salander
has two brain cells,

00:49:43.417 --> 00:49:45.040
and one's for breathing.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.790
But now you know that this is not correct.

00:49:47.790 --> 00:49:50.855
She has two for breathing,
one for inspiration,

00:49:50.855 --> 00:49:52.571
one for expiration, so she has
at least three brain cells.

00:49:52.571 --> 00:49:55.571
(audience laughing)

00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:02.420
So in summary, this is
gonna be on the exam.

00:50:02.820 --> 00:50:03.653
(audience laughing)

00:50:03.653 --> 00:50:06.130
Okay, so, the preBotzinger Complex,

00:50:06.130 --> 00:50:09.160
that's the engine for
inspiratory breathing.

00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.850
It's active before birth because

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:12.640
it has to be working when you're born.

00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.360
The mechanisms for rhythm
generation are unknown,

00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:17.833
but we think the network is very critical.

00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:21.670
The paraFacial Nucleus,
it's the engine for

00:50:21.670 --> 00:50:23.297
active expiratory breathing.

00:50:23.297 --> 00:50:26.840
And I say active, because
normally it's quiescent.

00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.350
It's silent at rest, because
activated in exercise

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:32.090
and when you make volitional efforts

00:50:32.090 --> 00:50:34.233
where you need your expiratory movements.

00:50:35.510 --> 00:50:37.290
I talked about sighs.

00:50:37.290 --> 00:50:40.160
They're vital for life and it seems to be

00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.960
a relatively straightforward circuit

00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.240
that's responsible for doing it.

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:47.070
We don't understand how it's regulated

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:49.430
on a breath by breath
or side by side basis,

00:50:49.430 --> 00:50:52.130
but it's, we're actively looking at that.

00:50:52.130 --> 00:50:54.450
And then breathing affects emotion.

00:50:54.450 --> 00:50:57.440
I will stipulate, yes,
and the mechanisms are

00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:59.420
currently being explored.

00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:04.420
Now, this work was done in my lab,

00:51:04.890 --> 00:51:08.450
but it was done by a large cohort

00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:11.470
of extremely talented
and wonderful people.

00:51:11.470 --> 00:51:13.490
And I can't thank them individually,

00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:16.210
but you'll get to see pictures of

00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:19.870
all the people I work with,
who stand behind this work.

00:51:19.870 --> 00:51:22.540
And for them I'm eternally grateful,

00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:26.700
for their efforts to advance
the topic as much as we did.

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:28.800
With that said, thank you
very much for your attention.

00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:30.111
I'll be happy to take some questions.

00:51:30.111 --> 00:51:33.278
(audience applauding)

00:51:43.689 --> 00:51:46.830
- Professor Feldman, thank
you for such a marvelous talk.

00:51:46.830 --> 00:51:49.130
We do have time for questions.

00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:52.960
And it's going to be useful,
if you raise your hand,

00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:55.180
a person with a microphone,
a roving microphone,

00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:56.990
will run towards you.

00:51:56.990 --> 00:52:00.270
- [Man] Is yawning a
sighing, a type of sighing,

00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:04.556
and what causes that, and
is it indeed contagious?

00:52:04.556 --> 00:52:07.354
(laughing)

00:52:07.354 --> 00:52:09.820
- This is usually something I reserve for

00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:12.203
discussions in bar rooms late at night.

00:52:14.300 --> 00:52:17.510
Yawning is another reflex.

00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:20.200
We are not entirely sure

00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:23.610
what the full benefit is of yawning.

00:52:23.610 --> 00:52:25.251
Certainly, we can use that

00:52:25.251 --> 00:52:27.560
if our eustachian tubes get closed up,

00:52:27.560 --> 00:52:29.970
we can use it to open up the airways.

00:52:29.970 --> 00:52:33.650
As far as contagion goes, there may be

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:35.780
a social aspect to yawning.

00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:37.463
I'm bored, I wanna get out of here,

00:52:37.463 --> 00:52:39.610
and I wanna communicate
that to other people.

00:52:39.610 --> 00:52:41.610
Why other people then imitate it,

00:52:41.610 --> 00:52:44.660
I can't, I really don't know.

00:52:44.660 --> 00:52:47.200
If I had a couple of
beers I might speculate,

00:52:47.200 --> 00:52:48.046
but not at this point.

00:52:48.046 --> 00:52:49.622
(audience laughing)

00:52:49.622 --> 00:52:50.650
- [Man] I have a question over here.

00:52:50.650 --> 00:52:52.250
- Jack, Jim Weiss.

00:52:52.250 --> 00:52:53.210
- [Man] Beautiful talk.

00:52:53.210 --> 00:52:54.530
- Thank you, Jim.

00:52:54.530 --> 00:52:57.850
- [Man] Terrestrial mammals, obviously,

00:52:57.850 --> 00:53:01.340
mostly breathing is involuntary,
but aquatic mammals,

00:53:01.340 --> 00:53:04.960
it seems need much more
of a voluntary mechanism

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:07.430
to control breathing so they don't drown

00:53:07.430 --> 00:53:08.263
when they're submerging.

00:53:08.263 --> 00:53:10.930
Are there any differences in the circuits

00:53:10.930 --> 00:53:13.980
that regulate breathing in them?

00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:18.980
- Well, that's a very interesting
question, Jim, thank you.

00:53:19.280 --> 00:53:24.000
Diving mammals have a
lot of specializations.

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.310
And we actually still have some of them.

00:53:26.310 --> 00:53:28.410
It's called a diving reflex.

00:53:28.410 --> 00:53:30.950
So if you splash cold water on yourself,

00:53:30.950 --> 00:53:32.690
you may initiate the diving reflex.

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:37.690
And what the diving reflex
does is, you stop breathing,

00:53:37.730 --> 00:53:42.350
you stop your circulation
from going anywhere

00:53:42.350 --> 00:53:44.340
except the two most critical organs:

00:53:44.340 --> 00:53:46.510
your heart and your brain.

00:53:46.510 --> 00:53:48.400
And if you're a diving whale, it'll go to

00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:51.270
your extremely efficient tail muscle.

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:54.560
And the rate of oxygen consumption

00:53:54.560 --> 00:53:56.633
then gets reduced tremendously.

00:53:57.470 --> 00:54:01.710
Every year we have young
children fall through the ice.

00:54:01.710 --> 00:54:04.990
And they could be submerged
for a half an hour and more

00:54:04.990 --> 00:54:07.420
and they can survive.

00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:11.000
And the reason they survive
is, one, diving reflex,

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.840
and two, because they're small,

00:54:12.840 --> 00:54:16.770
their surface area to
body volume is so small,

00:54:16.770 --> 00:54:19.030
they cool down quickly enough so

00:54:19.030 --> 00:54:22.020
that four-minute oxygen that we have

00:54:22.020 --> 00:54:24.520
can now last them 30 or 40 minutes,

00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:27.190
whereas you and I, if
we went below the water,

00:54:27.190 --> 00:54:29.460
we wouldn't cool off fast enough.

00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:32.120
So I don't know if that
really answered your question,

00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.770
but that's as close as I can get.

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:36.390
- [Woman] Thank you.

00:54:37.350 --> 00:54:39.340
Here, I'll stand up.

00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:41.790
I don't quite know what my question is,

00:54:41.790 --> 00:54:44.273
but it's about apnea, sleep apnea.

00:54:45.950 --> 00:54:47.920
It seems to be being diagnosed

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:51.200
much, much more frequently these days

00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:53.300
and not just in people with CPAPs,

00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:58.053
but people who, I don't
know, snore a little.

00:54:59.568 --> 00:55:02.800
And I guess I, I'm in the second category,

00:55:02.800 --> 00:55:06.460
and I'm just wondering if you,
and we're always told that

00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:10.540
there're really dire
consequences of apnea.

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.428
Oh, okay, so that's the answer.

00:55:12.428 --> 00:55:13.400
(audience laughing)

00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:15.920
- Well, I could explain a little bit.

00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:20.380
So, you stop breathing,
you're still using oxygen,

00:55:20.380 --> 00:55:22.500
so your oxygen levels drop,

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:23.853
depending how long you're not breathing,

00:55:23.853 --> 00:55:27.090
your oxygen levels can drop to the point

00:55:27.090 --> 00:55:29.980
where they can begin to do damage.

00:55:29.980 --> 00:55:32.140
Now remember, you're not
just stopping breathing,

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:34.930
people with sleep apnea, once per night.

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:37.750
It can be as many as 400 times a night,

00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:39.480
people stop breathing,

00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:42.380
and the only way they
start again is to wake up.

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:46.020
So that has the consequences
of disrupting sleep,

00:55:46.020 --> 00:55:49.580
exposing all their cells,
but particularly their brain

00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:52.040
to extended periods of low oxygen,

00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:56.290
and their blood pressure
can often shoot up

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:58.810
to well over 200 systolic.

00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:02.000
So you imagine it happening,
this hundreds of times a night,

00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.980
and the cumulative effect
over time is just devastating.

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:08.830
Now, the therapy that works are

00:56:08.830 --> 00:56:10.740
these positive pressure ventilators.

00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:13.660
The problem is, most people hate them

00:56:13.660 --> 00:56:15.310
and there's a lot of effort

00:56:15.310 --> 00:56:17.860
to try and find alternative mechanisms

00:56:17.860 --> 00:56:20.720
that can keep people
ventilating all night.

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:22.425
Did that answer your question?

00:56:22.425 --> 00:56:23.390
(woman speaking in background)

00:56:23.390 --> 00:56:24.614
Like snoring.

00:56:24.614 --> 00:56:25.960
- [Woman] Yeah.

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:29.980
- NIH says that people who
snore have three to five times

00:56:29.980 --> 00:56:34.850
the rate of incidence of
strokes and heart attacks.

00:56:34.850 --> 00:56:38.790
Snorers, not people
with frank sleep apnea.

00:56:38.790 --> 00:56:40.690
So snoring in and of itself is

00:56:40.690 --> 00:56:43.363
something that is a matter of concern.

00:56:44.900 --> 00:56:46.450
I don't mean to alarm you, but.

00:56:47.660 --> 00:56:48.530
- [Woman] Hi.

00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:51.550
Since we sometimes
historically have thought of

00:56:51.550 --> 00:56:54.330
basic mechanisms in terms
of the male model of human,

00:56:54.330 --> 00:56:55.670
I just wonder--

00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:56.856
- Excuse me, the?

00:56:56.856 --> 00:57:00.410
- [Woman] Sometimes we
think of basic mechanisms

00:57:00.410 --> 00:57:02.880
in terms of a male model of human being,

00:57:02.880 --> 00:57:04.020
as opposed to both genders.

00:57:04.020 --> 00:57:06.410
And I'm just wondering
if your research includes

00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:09.380
any potential differences in females.

00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.230
Because if you're linking the entry points

00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:13.780
and neural networks, you know,

00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.530
I just wonder if you've
seen any differences

00:57:16.530 --> 00:57:17.990
between male and female or--

00:57:17.990 --> 00:57:20.610
- We haven't, at the level
we've been looking at,

00:57:20.610 --> 00:57:22.160
we have not seen any differences.

00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:26.260
However, demographically, for sleep apnea

00:57:26.260 --> 00:57:29.540
women seem to be
protected until menopause.

00:57:29.540 --> 00:57:33.140
And then at menopause, their
rate of sleep apnea rises.

00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:36.660
So it's something about the
protective effects, probably,

00:57:36.660 --> 00:57:40.610
of hormones that are
reducing the likelihood

00:57:40.610 --> 00:57:44.500
that women becomes, have
obstructive sleep apnea.

00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:46.910
But as soon as they pass menopause,

00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:49.650
their rate of sleep apnea goes up.

00:57:51.752 --> 00:57:54.502
