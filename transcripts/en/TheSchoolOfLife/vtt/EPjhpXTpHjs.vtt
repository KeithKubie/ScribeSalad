00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.460
It is one of the seven virtues of Christianity.
It used to have a central place in Roman ethics

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.709
and Judaism as well. Today, we remain deeply
impressed by the idea of charity, but often

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:17.960
from a distance, without probing the concept
too deeply, with little attempt to practise

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.250
it systematically. It’s something we might
have recourse to when we’re moved by a documentary

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.669
on the TV or have some loose change left over
after the holidays. At its most basic, charity

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.190
means: giving someone something they need
but can’t get for themselves. And normally

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.800
that’s understood to mean something material.
We overwhelmingly associate charity with giving

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:45.789
money. The heroes of Christianity are exemplars
of such charity. Outside the city, Saint Francis

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:51.059
comes across a poor man. His garments are
thin and ragged. Winter is coming on and coats

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.629
are expensive. The saint is moved to charity.
But, at its core, charity goes far beyond

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.579
finance. It is about recognising that a person
needs help with something that they can’t

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.130
do for themselves – and that their helplessness
is not a sign of wickedness or sin, but is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.770
part of the human condition. We freely give
because we appreciate how often we wouldn’t

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.450
have made it if other people had not – at
key points, in different contexts – cut

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.130
us some slack. It is in relationships that
charity becomes particularly necessary. Here

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.770
we don’t generally require the charity of
money, cloaks and free meals. What we are

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.960
short of is charity of interpretation: that
is, a charitable perspective on our weaknesses,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.170
eccentricities, anxieties and follies – failings
that we are unable to explain or win sympathy

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.549
for, that we merely act out, with immaturity
and hurt. It might be that one person in a

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:52.960
couple has badly messed up in their professional
life. They made a significant decision at

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.360
work that played out badly. They got severely
criticised; there was talk of court action.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.570
For months, they were very agitated, and hard
to live with. They couldn’t articulate their

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.600
fears. They were sullen and irascible. Their
partner might have added stern admonitions

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.340
to those of the regulator, the senior management
and people on Twitter… They could have concluded

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.990
that their partner was inept, greedy, maybe
a bit unprincipled. But instead, a charitable

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:23.990
soul does the work the partner has not been
able to do. They do the explaining for them.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.980
They understand enough about their past to
have a picture of where their impatience and

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.230
over-ambition came from. They hold in mind
what happened with their parents and with

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.810
the move to another country and with the brother
who died too young. They lend a picture of

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.760
who the ‘beggar’ is that is sufficiently
generous and complex as to make them more

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.500
than just the ‘fool’ or ‘weirdo’ they
could so easily have been dismissed as. The

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:53.560
genuinely charitable person gives generously
from a sense that they too stand in need of

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:59.860
charity. Not right now, not over this, but
in some other area. They know that self-righteousness

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:05.000
is merely the result of a faulty memory, an
inability to hold in mind – at moments when

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.950
one is totally right – how often one has
been deeply and definitively in the wrong.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.960
Charity remembers how there might still be
goodness amidst a lot of evil. Charity keeps

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:22.220
in mind that if someone is tired and stressed,
they are liable to behave appallingly. Charity

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.540
is aware that when someone shouts an insult
they are not usually revealing the secret

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.670
truth about their feelings. They are trying
to wound the other because they feel they

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.120
have been hurt – usually by someone else,
whom they don’t have the authority to injure

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:42.230
back. Charity is interested in mitigating
circumstances; in bits of the truth that can

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:48.290
cast a less catastrophic light on our follies.
In financial matters, charity tends always

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.070
to flow in one direction. The philanthropist
may be very generous, but usually they stay

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:59.740
rich; they are habitually the giver rather
than the recipient. But in life as a whole,

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:05.150
and especially in relationships, charity is
unlikely ever to end up being one-sided: who

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:09.980
is weak and who is powerful changes rapidly
and frequently. You are likely to be, as it

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:15.580
were, a patron in one area and a beggar in
another. So we must be kind not only because

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.790
we are touched by the suffering of others
but because we properly understand that we

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:26.030
too will soon be in urgent need of an equally
vital dose of charity in some other part of

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.530
our lives.
