00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.360
In March of 2015, American astronaut Scott
Kelly and his Russian colleague Mikhail Kornienko,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.500
began an unprecedented mission in space.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.769
They began a one-year term of service aboard
the International Space Station, the longest

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:13.960
tour of duty ever served on the ISS.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, I imagine there’s all sorts of stuff
to worry about when you’re packing for a

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.990
year-long space voyage, like, say, “How
many books should I bring? How many pairs

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.510
of underwear? Am I really okay with pooping
into a suctioned plastic bag every day for

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.970
a year? Will I come upon a derelict ship haunted
by some stranded and insane astronaut from

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.390
a forgotten mission, like in pretty much every
space horror movie ever? Will there be coffee?”

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.880
Reasonable questions, all, but in reality,
another one you might want to ask is: “Will

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.230
I be able to walk when I get back home?”

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.070
We know micro-gravity is hard on a body, and
this mission is largely about testing the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.550
physical effects of being weightless for so long.

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:50.740
Astronauts often experience things like trouble
sleeping, puffy faces, and loss of muscle

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:55.480
mass, but perhaps the most serious damage a
microgravity environment causes is to the bones.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.760
And bones, well, they’re pretty clutch.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.060
Though they may look all dried up and austere,
don’t be fooled -- your bones are alive.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.540
ALIVE I tell you!

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.499
They’re actually as dynamic as any of your
organs, and are made of active connective

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.760
tissue that’s constantly breaking down, regenerating,
and repairing itself throughout your lifetime.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.259
In fact, you basically get a whole new skeleton
every 7 to 10 years!

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:19.729
In short, your bones do way more than just
providing your squishy sack of flesh with

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.429
support and scaffolding and the ability to
move around.

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:25.549
Your bones are basically how you store the
calcium, phosphate, and other minerals you

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.270
need to keep neurons firing and muscles contracting.

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:32.870
They’re also crucial to hematopoiesis, or
blood cell production. All of your new blood

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.090
-- and we’re talking like, a trillion blood
cells a day! -- is generated in your bone

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.330
marrow, which also helps store energy as fat.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.770
Bones even help maintain homeostasis by regulating
blood calcium levels and producing the hormone

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.060
osteocalcin, which regulates bone formation
and protects against glucose intolerance and diabetes.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.649
So, the big buzzkill about life in space is
that, up there, a person suffers one to two

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.479
percent bone loss EVERY MONTH.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.270
By comparison, your average elderly person
experiences 1-2 percent bone loss every YEAR.

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.609
So for Kelly and Kornienko, that could mean
losing up to 20 percent over a year in orbit.

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:04.409
Given everything your bones do for you, that’s
really serious.

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.979
And while most of that loss is reversible
once they’re back on earth, it’s not as

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.129
easy as chugging some of Madame Pomfrey’s
Skel-E-Gro potion.

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.510
Rehabilitation can take years of hard work,
and that’s just after a few months in orbit…

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.930
Which is why Kelly and Kornienko are heroes
of science, and not just for scholars of anatomy

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.150
and physiology everywhere, but for anybody
who has bones.

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.760
An average human body contains 206 bones,
ranging in shape and size from the tiny stapes

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.019
of the inner ear to the huge femur of the
thigh.

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.359
That’s a lot of bones to keep tabs on, so
anatomists often divide these structures first

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:47.870
by location, into either axial or appendicular
groups.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.549
As you might guess, your axial bones are found
along your body’s vertical axis -- in your

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.609
skull, vertebral column, and rib cage.

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.939
They’re kind of like your foundation, the
stuff you can’t really live without -- they

00:02:56.939 --> 00:03:01.249
carry your other body parts, provide skeletal
support, and organ protection.

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:04.939
Your appendicular bones are pretty much everything
else, the bones that make up your limbs, and

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.599
the things that attach those limbs to your
axial skeleton, like your pelvis and shoulder

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.320
blades. These are the bones that help us move
around.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.070
From there, bones are generally classified by their
shape, and luckily those names are pretty obvious.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.090
Long bones are your classic-looking, dog-bone-shaped
bones -- the limb bones that are longer than

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.700
they are wide, like tibia and fibula of your lower legs,
but also the trio of bones that make up your fingers.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.960
Follow some of those long bones to your foot
or hand, and you’ll hit a cube-shaped short

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.700
bone, like your foot’s talus and cuboid,
or your wrist’s lacunate or scaphoid.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:39.829
Your flat bones are the thinner ones, like
your sternum and scapulae, and also the bones

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:41.269
that make up your brain case.

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.299
And your irregular bones are all the weirdly-shaped
things like your vertebrae and pelvis, which

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:46.909
tend to be more specialized and unique.

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:51.269
But despite their variations in size, shape,
and finer function, all bones have a similar

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.450
internal structure.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.139
They all have a dense, smooth-looking external
layer of compact, or cortical bone around

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.340
a porous, honeycomb-looking area of spongy
bone.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.969
This spongy bone tissue is made up of tiny
cross-hatching supports called trabeculae

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:09.239
that help the bone resist stress. And it’s
also where you typically find your bone marrow,

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.749
which comes in two colors, red and yellow.

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:15.529
Red marrow is the stuff that makes blood cells,
so you should be glad that you have some of that.

00:04:15.529 --> 00:04:19.720
And yellow marrow stores energy as fat -- if
you happen to be a predatory animal, yellow

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:22.780
bone marrow can be one of the best sources
of calories you can find.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.240
The arrangement of these bone tissues, though, can be
slightly different, from one type of bone to the next.

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.470
In flat, short, and irregular bones, for example,
these tissues kinda look like a spongy bone

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:33.800
sandwich on compact-bone bread.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.380
But in some of your classic long bones, like
the femur and humerus, the spongy bone and

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.800
its red marrow are concentrated at the tips.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.500
These flared ends, or epiphyses bookend the
bone’s shaft, or diaphysis, which -- instead of

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.479
having spongy bone in the center -- surrounds a hollow
medullary cavity that’s full of that yellow marrow.

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.380
Now, although bone can look rock-solid, grab
a microscope and you’ll see that it’s actually

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.669
loaded with layered plates and laced with
little tunnels.

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:00.919
It’s intricate and kinda confusing in there,
but the more you zoom into the microanatomy

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.140
of bones, the better you can see how they’re built
and how they function, right down to the cellular level.

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:09.620
Let’s start with the basic structural units
of bone, called osteons.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.840
These are cylindrical, weight-bearing structures
that run parallel to the bone’s axis. Look

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:18.889
inside one and you’ll see that they’re composed
of tubes inside of tubes, so that a cross-section

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.069
of an osteon looks like the rings of a tree
trunk.

00:05:21.069 --> 00:05:26.140
Each one of these concentric tubes, or lamellae, is
filled with collagen fibers that run in the same direction

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:29.880
But if you inspect the fibers of a neighboring
lamella -- either on the inside or outside

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.429
of the first one -- you’ll see that they run in a
different direction, creating an alternating pattern.

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:38.639
This reinforced structure helps your bone resist
torsion stress, which is like twisting of

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.699
your bones, which they experience a lot, and
I encourage you not to imagine what a torsion

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:44.669
fracture of one of your bones might feel like.

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:49.289
Now, bone needs nourishment like any other
tissue, so running along the length of each

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:52.770
osteon are central canals, which hold nerves
and blood vessels.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:58.169
And then, tucked away between the layers of
lamellae are tiny oblong spaces called lacunae.

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.289
As tiny as they are, these little gaps are
where the real work of your skeletal system

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:05.569
gets done, because they house your osteocytes.

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.759
These are mature bone cells that monitor and
maintain your bone matrix. They’re like

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:13.699
the construction foremen of your bones, passing
along commands to your skeleton’s two main

00:06:13.699 --> 00:06:16.699
workhorses: the osteoblasts and the osteoclasts.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:21.099
Osteoblasts -- from the Greek words for “bone”
and “germ” or “sprout” -- are the

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:25.110
bone-building cells, and they’re actually
what construct your bones in the first place.

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.080
In the embryonic phase, bone tissue generally
starts off as cartilage, which provides a

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.440
framework for your bones to grow on. When
osteoblasts come in, they secrete a glue-like

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.920
cocktail of collagen, as well as enzymes that absorb
calcium, phosphate, and other minerals from the blood.

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:43.220
These minerals form calcium phosphate, which
crystallize on the cartilage framework, ultimately

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.250
forming a bone matrix that’s about one-third
mineral, two-thirds protein.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.220
From your time in the womb until you’re
about 25, your osteoblasts keep laying down

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:56.120
more collagen and more calcium phosphate, until
your bones are fully grown and completely hardened.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:01.539
So while your osteoblasts are the bone-makers,
your osteoclasts are the bone-breakers -- which

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:05.119
is a kind of violent image. Maybe think of
them as like a bone-breaker-downer.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.159
Although the two kinds of cells do exact
opposite jobs, they’re not mortal enemies.

00:07:09.159 --> 00:07:13.150
In fact, I’m happy to report that they get
along fabulously, and create a perfect balance

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.889
that allows your bones to regenerate.

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:18.680
It’s like if you want to renovate your house,
you’ve gotta rip out all those busted cabinets

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:23.250
and the musty carpeting before you can bring
in the nice hardwood floors and custom countertops.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:27.490
These cells work in a kinda similar way, in
a process that I’d argue is less stressful

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.009
than home improvement -- it’s called bone
remodeling.

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:33.639
The supervisors of this process are those
osteocytes, which kick things off when they

00:07:33.639 --> 00:07:38.259
sense stress and strain, or respond to mechanical
stimuli, like the weightlessness of space,

00:07:38.259 --> 00:07:39.840
or the impact of running on pavement.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:42.509
So, say you’re out running and something
happens -- nothing to be alarmed about! -- but

00:07:42.509 --> 00:07:47.639
suddenly the osteocytes in your femur detect
a tiny, microscopic fracture, and initiate

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.439
the remodeling process to fix it up.

00:07:49.439 --> 00:07:53.409
First, the osteocytes release chemical signals
that direct osteoclasts to the site of the

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:58.229
damage. When they get there, they secrete
both a collagen-digesting enzyme, and an acidic

00:07:58.229 --> 00:08:02.879
hydrogen-ion mixture that dissolves the calcium
phosphate, releasing its components back into

00:08:02.879 --> 00:08:06.110
the blood. This tear-down process is called
resorption.

00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:10.219
When the old bone tissue is cleaned out, the
osteoclasts then undergo apoptosis, where

00:08:10.219 --> 00:08:13.899
they basically self-destruct before they can do any
more damage. But before they auto-terminate, they

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:18.840
use the hormone hotline to call over the osteoblasts,
who come in and begin rebuilding the bone.

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:23.219
The ratio of active osteoclasts to osteoblasts
can vary greatly, and if you stress your bones

00:08:23.219 --> 00:08:28.060
a lot, through injury, by carrying extra weight,
or just normal exercise, those osteoclasts

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.420
are going to be swinging their little wrecking balls
non-stop, breaking down bone so it can be remade.

00:08:32.430 --> 00:08:37.610
In this way, exercising stimulates bone remodeling
-- and ultimately bone strength -- so when

00:08:37.610 --> 00:08:39.970
you’re working out, you’re building bone
as well as muscle.

00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:44.890
Which brings us back to our two space-heroes-slash-
guinea-pigs, Scott Kelly and Mikhail Kornienko.

00:08:44.890 --> 00:08:49.300
Space crews generally need to exercise at
least 15 hours a week to slow down the process

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:53.430
of bone degradation, but even that can’t
fully stave loss of bone density.

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:58.560
In microgravity, osteocytes aren’t getting much 
loading stimuli, because less gravity means less weight.

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.600
But, for reasons that we don’t understand
yet, the osteoclasts actually increase their

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:07.540
rate of bone resorption in low gravity, while
the osteoblasts dial back on the bone formation.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:11.300
Because there’s more bone breaking than
bone making going on, everything is out of

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:15.670
balance, and suddenly people start experiencing
1 to 2 percent monthly loss in bone mass.

00:09:15.670 --> 00:09:19.650
So, in addition to providing astronauts with
oxygen and water and food and protection from

00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:23.420
radiation and an environment that will keep
them mentally stable, it turns out that we

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.060
also have to figure out how to keep their
bodies from consuming their own skeletons.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.770
But at least today we learned about the anatomy
of the skeletal system, including the flat,

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:37.350
short, and irregular bones, and their individual
arrangements of compact and spongy bone. We

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:42.440
also went over the microanatomy of bones,
particularly the osteons and their inner lamella.

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:45.960
And finally we got an introduction to the
process of bone remodeling, which is carried

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.060
out by crews of osteocytes, osteoblasts, and
osteoclasts.
