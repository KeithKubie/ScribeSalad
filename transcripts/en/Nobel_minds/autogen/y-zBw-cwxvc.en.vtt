science fiction can you say something of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730
science fiction can you say something of
 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.570
science fiction can you say something of
the history behind the optical tweezers

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580
the history behind the optical tweezers
 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.529
the history behind the optical tweezers
for example I think that author Ashkan

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539
for example I think that author Ashkan
 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.410
for example I think that author Ashkan
very soon after the first laser had been

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420
very soon after the first laser had been
 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.620
very soon after the first laser had been
constructed realized that suddenly there

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630
constructed realized that suddenly there
 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.010
constructed realized that suddenly there
was available a tool of light or the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020
was available a tool of light or the
 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.170
was available a tool of light or the
totally different quality than you had

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180
totally different quality than you had
 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.590
totally different quality than you had
earlier and he started to think about

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600
earlier and he started to think about
 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.610
earlier and he started to think about
how can one use this tool to manipulate

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620
how can one use this tool to manipulate
 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.119
how can one use this tool to manipulate
objects and he realized that by thinking

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129
objects and he realized that by thinking
 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.240
objects and he realized that by thinking
about this he realized that just take a

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250
about this he realized that just take a
 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.470
about this he realized that just take a
small micro sized

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480
small micro sized
 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.439
small micro sized
transparent sphere it should be possible

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:58.449
transparent sphere it should be possible
 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:01.590
transparent sphere it should be possible
even if the radiation pressure from the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600
even if the radiation pressure from the
 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.840
even if the radiation pressure from the
laser is very small it should be

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850
laser is very small it should be
 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.719
laser is very small it should be
possible to manipulate such a sphere and

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:06.729
possible to manipulate such a sphere and
 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:09.899
possible to manipulate such a sphere and
indeed he was correct and already 1970

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:09.909
indeed he was correct and already 1970
 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.420
indeed he was correct and already 1970
he had demonstrated this so that but

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430
he had demonstrated this so that but
 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.350
he had demonstrated this so that but
then of course that was a long

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360
then of course that was a long
 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.590
then of course that was a long
development one development that that

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600
development one development that that
 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.690
development one development that that
went into the direction of manipulating

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700
went into the direction of manipulating
 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.389
went into the direction of manipulating
atoms something much smaller than than

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399
atoms something much smaller than than
 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.260
atoms something much smaller than than
microsites feared but he also started to

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270
microsites feared but he also started to
 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.270
microsites feared but he also started to
think about something much more complex

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280
think about something much more complex
 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.370
think about something much more complex
than a sphere namely viruses bacteria

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380
than a sphere namely viruses bacteria
 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.550
than a sphere namely viruses bacteria
even living cells he could trap so that

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560
even living cells he could trap so that
 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.080
even living cells he could trap so that
and that was of course the real

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090
and that was of course the real
 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.059
and that was of course the real
breakthrough that one could manipulate

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069
breakthrough that one could manipulate
 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.440
breakthrough that one could manipulate
such very complex objects same time you

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450
such very complex objects same time you
 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.660
such very complex objects same time you
can say that the dream of using

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670
can say that the dream of using
 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.100
can say that the dream of using
radiation pressure for example like

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110
radiation pressure for example like
 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:59.399
radiation pressure for example like
solar arrays is banking if you go a long

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409
solar arrays is banking if you go a long
 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.410
solar arrays is banking if you go a long
time back I mean already clipped Kepler

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.420
time back I mean already clipped Kepler
 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.389
time back I mean already clipped Kepler
realized that radiation pressure from

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:03.399
realized that radiation pressure from
 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:05.700
realized that radiation pressure from
the Sun could explain how the comet

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:05.710
the Sun could explain how the comet
 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.440
the Sun could explain how the comet
tails are behaving when they are coming

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:07.450
tails are behaving when they are coming
 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.870
tails are behaving when they are coming
in and out in the neighborhood of the

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880
in and out in the neighborhood of the
 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.870
in and out in the neighborhood of the
Sun so indeed it is you know it is an

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880
Sun so indeed it is you know it is an
 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.479
Sun so indeed it is you know it is an
older subject but it was really the

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489
older subject but it was really the
 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.390
older subject but it was really the
invention of the laser that put it into

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400
invention of the laser that put it into
 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.810
invention of the laser that put it into
the laboratory prior to that I mean you

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820
the laboratory prior to that I mean you
 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.190
the laboratory prior to that I mean you
didn't have light sources that would

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200
didn't have light sources that would
 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.290
didn't have light sources that would
work

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300
work
 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.770
work
laser so would it be possible to use

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780
laser so would it be possible to use
 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.180
laser so would it be possible to use
optical tweezers in moving objects in

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190
optical tweezers in moving objects in
 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.900
optical tweezers in moving objects in
space for example you mean up in out in

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910
space for example you mean up in out in
 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.980
space for example you mean up in out in
space I guess so I haven't thought about

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990
space I guess so I haven't thought about
 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.910
space I guess so I haven't thought about
that direction really but in space I

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920
that direction really but in space I
 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.070
that direction really but in space I
mean I guess there you want to have if

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080
mean I guess there you want to have if
 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.770
mean I guess there you want to have if
you want to have more than one spaceship

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780
you want to have more than one spaceship
 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:54.470
you want to have more than one spaceship
you what you really need is to keep them

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480
you what you really need is to keep them
 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.600
you what you really need is to keep them
extremely precise with respect to each

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610
extremely precise with respect to each
 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.320
extremely precise with respect to each
other and that laser of course plays a

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330
other and that laser of course plays a
 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:03.710
other and that laser of course plays a
very important role and this is a

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720
very important role and this is a
 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.270
very important role and this is a
development I think we will see in the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280
development I think we will see in the
 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.060

did they want to develop such things and

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850
did they want to develop such things and
 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.850
did they want to develop such things and
I think there are several reasons I mean

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860
I think there are several reasons I mean
 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.970
I think there are several reasons I mean
if you saw the curve I did that was the

new frontiers you want to push the pulse

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910
new frontiers you want to push the pulse
 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.520
new frontiers you want to push the pulse
intensity you want to go to higher and

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530
intensity you want to go to higher and
 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.740
intensity you want to go to higher and
higher intensity where you really start

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750
higher intensity where you really start
 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.090
higher intensity where you really start
to not only talk to the molecule or atom

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100
to not only talk to the molecule or atom
 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.780
to not only talk to the molecule or atom
but really - seriously influence it and

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790
but really - seriously influence it and
 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.140
but really - seriously influence it and
this is something that really started

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150
this is something that really started
 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.230
this is something that really started
with the invention of the CPA technique

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:00.240
with the invention of the CPA technique
 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.820
with the invention of the CPA technique
because then you get bounces of

interacting with atoms and molecules it

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560
interacting with atoms and molecules it
 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.470
interacting with atoms and molecules it
was no longer a small perturbation but

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480
was no longer a small perturbation but
 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.620
was no longer a small perturbation but
it was a drastic change of the electron

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630
it was a drastic change of the electron
 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.930
it was a drastic change of the electron
shell of the atom and this then led to

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940
shell of the atom and this then led to
 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.590
shell of the atom and this then led to
strong field physics and up to second

if you expose atoms to such strong
 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.440
if you expose atoms to such strong
fields you can take a movie of what's

if you're a potential PhD student you

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:46.409
if you're a potential PhD student you
 

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:47.540
if you're a potential PhD student you
should look for something that really

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:47.550
should look for something that really
 

00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.619
should look for something that really
interests you you should look for groups

00:07:51.619 --> 00:07:51.629
interests you you should look for groups
 

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:53.239
interests you you should look for groups
that are very good in that particular

00:07:53.239 --> 00:07:53.249
that are very good in that particular
 

00:07:53.249 --> 00:07:56.239
that are very good in that particular
area that interests you and then try to

00:07:56.239 --> 00:07:56.249
area that interests you and then try to
 

00:07:56.249 --> 00:07:58.790
area that interests you and then try to
start to get the PhD position in one of

00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800
start to get the PhD position in one of
 

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.420
start to get the PhD position in one of
these groups I think if you start with

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:01.430
these groups I think if you start with
 

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:04.670
these groups I think if you start with
something that you doesn't really

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:04.680
something that you doesn't really
 

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.619
something that you doesn't really
inspire you I don't think that's that's

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:06.629
inspire you I don't think that's that's
 

00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:08.809
inspire you I don't think that's that's

not right then you're on the wrong wrong
track you should choose the topic first

00:08:11.139 --> 00:08:11.149
track you should choose the topic first
 

00:08:11.149 --> 00:08:14.089
track you should choose the topic first
then look for people that are doing this

00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:14.099
then look for people that are doing this
 

00:08:14.099 --> 00:08:17.389
then look for people that are doing this
and try to select the best it's not easy

00:08:17.389 --> 00:08:17.399
and try to select the best it's not easy
 

00:08:17.399 --> 00:08:20.059
and try to select the best it's not easy
admittedly but

00:08:20.059 --> 00:08:20.069
admittedly but
