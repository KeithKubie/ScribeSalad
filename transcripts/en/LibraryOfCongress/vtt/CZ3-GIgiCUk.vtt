&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.350
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Good
evening everybody.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.570
My name is David Plylar and I'm
a music specialist at the Library

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.780
of Congress and I'm very
pleased to be here tonight

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.920
with some special people.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.340
First we have two members of
WindSync; Jack Marquardt, clarinet,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.730
and Tracy Jacobson, bassoon.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.540
And they are going to be
speaking with us a bit

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.270
about their performance and
what they're up to these days.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.670
And in particular about
the new pieces going

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.610
to be premiered tonight
by composer Paul Lansky.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:05.000
Paul Lansky is a major, major
figure in, I don't like to say

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.360 position:56%
in electronic or computer music
because he's a major figure in music

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.700
in general, and so we're
very pleased to have him here

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.430
because he's doing a lot, kind of
in all realms of music these days.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.080
He just recently retired
from Princeton University

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.010
after teaching there
for 45 years, I think.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.310
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.070
[ Laughter ]

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.900
And I'm also pleased to say that
his wife Hannah is here who is on,

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.800 position:56%
who provided the voice for the vocal
part in Six Fantasies on a Poem

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:42.780
by Thomas Campion in 1973.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.080
Is that?

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:45.380
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.060
Sixty-eight, '78.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.160 position:56%
Okay so look like I have the sources
here to be able to correct me

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.540
with my frequent errors, but I,
so Paul Lansky was commissioned

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.130
by the Caroline Royal Just
Fund in the Library of Congress

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.180
and the Chamber of Music
Society of Lincoln Center.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.160
He wrote a new piece called
the Long and Short of it.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.510
So let's please welcome our guests.

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:13.480
[ Applause ]

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.080
So I thought we'd dive, we're
going to start with a focus

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.800
on the wind quintet because
our players need some time just

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.250 position:56%
to get ready just before the concert
as well, but I'm going to dive

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.220
into it with wind quintet
repertoire.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.400
I mean what do you have, for the
most part, is a lot of new music,

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.480
new transcriptions,
things like that.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.260
How do you go about kind
of building programs

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.510
and doing the things you do?

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.220
What is it that draws
you to the ensemble?

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.730
&gt;&gt; Jack Marquardt: Well with
this program in particular,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.560
we were so inspired by the fact
that the Long and Short of it,

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.690
the world premiere piece
tonight was inspired by one

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.220 position:56%
of the seminal pieces of the wind
literature, the Mozart Gran Partita.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:00.560
So what we decided to do was
pick three pairs of pieces,

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.080
three pieces that are
standards to the one literature;

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.260
Barbara Summer music, Antoine
Reicha Opus 88 number two quintet

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:14.010 position:56%
in E flat major, and the Mozart Gran
Partita arrangement we'll be doing

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.630
of the Adagio movement.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.780
And we decided to pair
each one with a piece

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.170
that either inspired directly
or indirectly, in a way.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.360
So with the, obviously with
the Mozart Gran Partita,

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.860
there's the Paul Lansky,
the Long and Short of it.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.000
And then with the Maslanka,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.480 position:56%
sorry with the Reicha we're actually
pairing, Antoine Reicha was one

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.890
of the most prolific composers
and one of the earliest composers

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.570
of the wind quintet in
the early 19 century.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.190
He's often kind of seen as
the same way as Haydn was

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:51.280
to the string quartet, but
only for the wind quintet.

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.660
So he's kind of the
grandfather of the wind quintet

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.030
and David Maslanka is one

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.480
of the most prolifical writers
today for the wind quintet.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.170
So we kind of paired these two.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.880
They're going to bookend into the
program and then for Summer Music,

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.150
we're actually pairing it with
a piece called Winter Music

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.910
by a contemporary composer
named Adam Shurnberg

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.450
who lives in Los Angeles.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.020
He's in his mid-30's, so he's still
kind of young and it's a piece

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.420
that he found direct inspiration
from and so that's kind

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.000 position:56%
of how we put this program together.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.310
More generally we like to do
a lot of our own arrangements.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.090
So this program actually only
has one of our own arrangements,

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.450
the Mozart Gran Partita,
but generally you'll find

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.130
that almost 90% of our programs
are our own arrangements.

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:38.550
Not just the pieces
written for winds,

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.290
but orchestra, piano,
string quartet.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:45.510
It really runs the gamut of
anything is possible for us to do.

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.810
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Do all five of
you participate in that process

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.520
or is it do you kind of
switch roles every once

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.240
in a while, take the lead, and --

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.520
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson: Well
Jack is our primary arranger

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:59.560
and then once Jack has put
the arrangement on the page,

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.090
it's a very collaborative
process from there.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:08.820
Where we're taking a pencil or
a pen to the part and switching

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.190 position:56%
around parts and seeing what's,
what really works best for all of us

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:15.360
and once we come up with
that then we perform it

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.780
and change it all again.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.690
And that's one of the
really exciting things

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.430
about our particular experience
playing in wind quintet,

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:27.830
that we have so many
performances that we're really able

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:32.250
to in every performance have a very
different experience with the music

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.720
and be very playful
and learn new things

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.420
about the music every
time we play it.

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:40.610
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well that strikes
me as a very convenient scenario

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.100
to be able to have that ability to
have that flexibility on the fly

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:48.540
and make those decisions
depending on where you are without,

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:51.850
you know causing any, too much
consternation to the transcriber.

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:53.380
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson:
Exactly [laughter].

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:56.630 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well maybe looking
at the new piece, the Long and Short

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.780
of it, I want to ask Paul
about it, but first I want

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.620
to hear what you have to say about
what you see as a relationship

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.890
between that piece and
the Adagio for the Mozart

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.620
or like how does it fit it,
how does the inspiration seem

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.490
to trace to you?

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.390
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson:
Well it's very obvious,

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:21.870
even from the first few notes of
Paul's piece because even just

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.170
with the tempo marking and
the way that it's written,

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:31.620 position:56%
it looks like the Mozart and there's
a particular rhythm that's present

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:36.090
in the Gran Partita which actually,

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:41.210
even before we played Paul's piece
we actually played the arrangement

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.510
of the Partita.

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:43.810
So we were in that mindset

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:47.420
when we first approached
the Long and Short of it.

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:52.330
And so when we first began, it
was this feeling of familiarity

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.670
from the beginning because
we were already familiar

00:06:54.670 --> 00:06:58.380
with this same rhythm
and the melody as well.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:02.530
It references very directly
the melody in the Gran Partita,

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:06.770 position:56%
but with some very key changes and
then one of the most exciting things

00:07:06.770 --> 00:07:10.780
about playing this piece is
seeing where it goes differently.

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:16.280
And to find those differences
and then with many

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.820
of the different movements,
they're not as directly tied

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.960
to that original, that original
theme and that original kind

00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.270
of motor behind what's
going on in the melody.

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:29.610
So there's a lot of really
interesting wind textures

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.940
that are very well
written for wind quintet.

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:38.480
I must say that a lot of, a lot of
wind quintets that we've attempted

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.540
to perform or attempted to play
are not necessarily written

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:44.610
by wind players and they
don't understand the need

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:48.400
to breathe [laughter]
and some of these things.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:52.900
So we really have appreciated
Paul's writing.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.740
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I think what's so
fascinating about the inspiration

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:57.040
from the Gran Partita is not,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.570
you know one of the
beautiful melodies with,

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.900
actually from this accompanimental
figure that's so present throughout

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:04.670 position:56%
and that's the launching point for
this whole piece and I think that is

00:08:04.670 --> 00:08:07.600
so cool that the, he's
actually taken the heart beat

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.940
out of the Gran Partita and kind
of injected his own voice to it.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.280
Whereas a lot of times
it's much more

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:13.970
of a straight forward inspiration.

00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:17.400
So it's really amazing to see
that kind of, that heart beat kind

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.920
of wove into this really
amazing texture of this piece.

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.460
Well Paul, what are your thoughts
on maybe the genesis of it?

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.490
What led you to this idea as
having this be a kind of kernel

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:30.300
for the start of a wind quintet?

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:31.600
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: It's funny.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:32.900 position:56%
I don't really know how it happened.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:38.810
I know the Mozart and I love the
Mozart and the Mozart always seemed

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:45.450
to me to epitomize
breathing in wind instruments,

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:47.710
you know you can imagine,

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:51.500
you can imagine string
instruments playing through them.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.510
The basic rhythm goes --

00:08:53.510 --> 00:08:59.080
[ Singing Out Rhythm ]

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.410
Which is a long note and a short
note and that's the genesis

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:04.320
of the title, Long and Short of it.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.030
I think it's an inspired title.

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:08.040
[ Laughter ]

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:12.970
And so my idea, I started
out, I can't remember

00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.270
where I started out in this.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:16.890
I usually don't write pieces
in chronological order.

00:09:16.890 --> 00:09:20.350
You know things, I think I actually
started with the first movement

00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:26.730 position:56%
or the second movement, but the idea
behind using the accompaniments sort

00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:32.980
of as the DNA of the piece, as
it were, was, came pretty quickly

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.440
and I had mixed feelings when
I heard that we were going

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:39.030
to play the Mozart because
Mozart does it so well.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:41.040
[ Laughter ]

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.390
And, but that's okay.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.690
Okay.

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.990
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well one thing

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:48.290
about your title is I've
always thought that you,

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:52.150
you had a little certain sense of
humor similar to Milton Babbitt

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.410
with whom you studied
in terms of the kind

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:56.620
of clever titles [laughter].

00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:01.630
One of the, did it get to a
point that was made earlier

00:10:01.630 --> 00:10:07.280
about the writing well for winds,
I haven't been able to spend time

00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.480
with the score, but I believe
that there's certain focuses

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.990
on different instruments
in the kind of the interim,

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.370
intermediary kind of
shorter movements.

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.550
I believe that that's true
and to me that strikes me

00:10:16.550 --> 00:10:20.340
as a really smart way to give other
players a break even though I think

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.750 position:56%
you're still playing, but [laughter]
maybe you can talk to that

00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:26.320
or is that something that
you're very much thinking about?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:30.890
Just knowing that these are going
to be, that there's a chops issue

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.140
as well as other types of --

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.140
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Yeah, I
thought it would be a good way

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:38.000
to exercise the different
things that instruments can do.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.810
I saved the last one
for the clarinet.

00:10:39.810 --> 00:10:41.600
That's the biggest one.

00:10:41.600 --> 00:10:44.090
[ Laughter ]

00:10:44.090 --> 00:10:48.860
But it's nice, the, it
consists of what is it?

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:50.910
Five short movements.

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.680
There's a [inaudible] and
three interludes and four sort

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.540 position:56%
of main movements which are slightly
longer and each of the preludes

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:02.460
and interludes features
one of the instruments.

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:06.430
So I start with the flute and
then I think bassoon is next.

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:07.730
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson: Right.

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:12.890
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: And then obo
then horn and then clarinet

00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:15.760
and I thought it was just
a nice way to do this

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.820
because these instruments
have different roles to play

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:21.100
in multiple wind quintets.

00:11:21.100 --> 00:11:25.820
So that sort of came, that
idea came pretty quickly

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:29.370
and the writing the movements,
the other movements was sort

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:33.400
of an exercise in trying to,
and I have an escape philosophy.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.160
You know get something going that
got away from the Long and Short

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:42.020 position:56%
of it, but we'll see how that works.

00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:47.590
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson: If I might add,
another really great thing for us,

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:51.120
having these different
instrument features is

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.160
that the wind quintet features
these five very different

00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.540
sounding instruments.

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:58.980
Instruments that produce
sound in different ways

00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:03.580
and in different ranges and
one thing that can happen is

00:12:03.580 --> 00:12:06.610
that the instruments get
pigeon hold into their range,

00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:10.290
particularly you have the bassoon
always playing the bass line.

00:12:10.290 --> 00:12:15.570
You have the flute always playing
the top voice and to do this

00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:18.240
in the way that you did where each
of the instruments is featured

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:22.130
as a solo voice, it
creates, it turns everything

00:12:22.130 --> 00:12:27.000
around throughout the piece and so
the audience is constantly getting

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.730
to hear different, different
parts of the wind quintet

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:33.950
and so I think it's really
exciting and it makes the piece

00:12:33.950 --> 00:12:38.250
so much more dynamic as
you're listening to it.

00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:42.150
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So Paul, you're
a recovering wind quintet player.

00:12:42.150 --> 00:12:44.280
[ Laughter ]

00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.870 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: I played, it was one

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.220
of the highlights of
my life actually.

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.790
When I was just graduating
from college,

00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:55.410
I got a call from the
Dorian Wind Quintet,

00:12:55.410 --> 00:12:57.350
they asked me to audition for them.

00:12:57.350 --> 00:13:01.580
I did and they called me before
I got home and I played with them

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.690
for a year or two before I went
to graduate school at Princeton

00:13:05.690 --> 00:13:08.440
in composition, but it was great.

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.200
The horn was a great
instrument for me.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:17.080 position:56%
I seem to, for some reason I seem to
have a knack for it and it sort of,

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:21.380
I realized that when my junior high
school band teacher gave us each a

00:13:21.380 --> 00:13:24.800
little audition and he said to me
I can see you've been practicing.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.590
And I hadn't been practicing.

00:13:26.590 --> 00:13:29.080
[ Laughter ]

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:31.510
So this has got to be a
good instrument for me.

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.040
[ Laughter ]

00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:36.440
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well
Tracy and Jack,

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:40.380
what sorts of projects are you
working on now in addition to,

00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:42.520
you know giving this
premiere tonight

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.010
and other things you're up to?

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.510
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson: One of
the most exciting things

00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:49.410
that we're doing right
now is actually a program

00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:54.210
of music that's inspired in some
way or another by Shakespeare

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.680
and so we're looking at all
these different angles of music

00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:01.410 position:56%
that was inspired by Shakespeare and
a lot of these are transcriptions

00:14:01.410 --> 00:14:05.340
and particularly of
Romeo and Juliet.

00:14:05.340 --> 00:14:09.400
And so again, we're
featuring Jack's arrangements

00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:14.540
in some pretty exciting capacities
and the other thing in this program

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:18.480
that we're doing that's beyond even
just Shakespeare is just classical

00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.960
storytelling and looking
at the wind quintet

00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:25.720
as a storytelling instrument
in a lot of ways.

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:33.640 position:56%
And so in, I guess the common thread
of this program is that every piece

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:37.050 position:56%
that we're playing tells a story
and in the telling or in the playing

00:14:37.050 --> 00:14:41.270 position:56%
of this piece, we're also
including the audience in this story

00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:44.690
and because Shakespeare's
stories are all so well-known,

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:49.060
it's something that we can
all really relate to together.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:51.860
&gt;&gt; Jack: And also on the horizon
this season we've actually

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.110
commissioned concerto for
wind quintet and orchestra.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:15:00.140
It'll be getting its premiere in
May with the Lafayette Symphony

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:01.990
in Indiana and then next year

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.730
with the River Oaks Chamber
Orchestra in Houston.

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.270
That's by a young composer
named Michael Gilbertson and so

00:15:07.270 --> 00:15:08.600
that will be really exciting thing

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.040
to have an entire wind
quintet standing up in front

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:13.830
of an orchestra playing a concerto.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:15.820
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson: And the
other aspect of what we do,

00:15:15.820 --> 00:15:20.120
which is pretty substantial
for us, is we focus a lot

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.030
on building classical
music audiences

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.760
and particularly young audiences.

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.740
And so we have a project right now

00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:31.750
which is called the Play
Different Project and again,

00:15:31.750 --> 00:15:36.370
going with this storytelling theme
we're looking at the wind quintet

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:41.580
as a way of seeing five individual
instruments that look different

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.970
and sound different, but they play
beautifully together and the music

00:15:45.970 --> 00:15:47.900
that we create is better
than the sound of our parts.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:53.240
And so we look at this as a
way to relate to young kids

00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:58.590
in elementary school and have
essentially created this campaign

00:15:58.590 --> 00:16:02.210
where we're using a musical
performance and actually going

00:16:02.210 --> 00:16:07.580
into classrooms to create
this environment of tolerance

00:16:07.580 --> 00:16:11.580
and appreciation of
differences amongst young people.

00:16:11.580 --> 00:16:12.880
So --

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:14.180
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I have a
question that comes to mind

00:16:14.180 --> 00:16:16.970
with these younger people
experiencing a wind quintet

00:16:16.970 --> 00:16:21.430
for the first time, perhaps do
they have these issues that,

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.940
you know some composers have
and, about a lack of [inaudible]

00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:30.030
of the sound between the voices
or, I mean I'm sure they hear

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:31.590
when you do things that
are like characters

00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:34.770
and of each individual instruments,
but do they have that same sort

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:39.660
of bias or something that they,
not in a negative way I don't mean,

00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.960
but you know what I mean?

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.800
&gt;&gt; Jack Marquardt: Well I
mean I think that it actually,

00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.030
we work it to our advantage.

00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:49.260
We have five distinct personalities
and five, you know people

00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.820
who really shine as
individuals within the group

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.400
and so I think that's,
you know the [inaudible]

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:58.330
of the strong quartet
is interesting,

00:16:58.330 --> 00:17:01.060
but I think we allow our
individual personalities to shine

00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:02.480
through a little bit more.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.970 position:56%
So we feel like they get to know us
as people a little bit more as well,

00:17:05.970 --> 00:17:08.670
I think, the kids do at least.

00:17:08.670 --> 00:17:11.730
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson: And we almost
become our instrument, in a way,

00:17:11.730 --> 00:17:16.820
which is so neat and exciting
to share and not even just

00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:22.040
for young audiences, but in general
our personalities really shine

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.410
through our instruments and
that's not something that we try

00:17:24.410 --> 00:17:26.170
and dampen in a performance.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:30.710
We really, we obviously want
to create a group sound,

00:17:30.710 --> 00:17:35.820
but we want that group sound to
be based on five soloists rather

00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:40.310
than five people that are
trying to blend initially.

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:41.610
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: That's
a great way to put that.

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:42.910
That's really nice.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:44.210
How are we doing on time?

00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:46.510
I just want to make sure we --

00:17:49.340 --> 00:17:50.640
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] at 10 minutes.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.940
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Oh great okay.

00:17:51.940 --> 00:17:56.550
Why don't we, we'll come back
to Paul in just a moment,

00:17:56.550 --> 00:17:58.570
but while we still have you here,

00:17:58.570 --> 00:18:03.830
I'm wondering if you can maybe
say a bit more about this process

00:18:03.830 --> 00:18:11.330 position:56%
of commissioning that you do and how
you go about building repertoire.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.880
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson: Well we actually
commissioned on a few occasions

00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:18.560
and one thing that we also
do is we try and find pieces

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.410
that are already written
for wind quintet.

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.390
Maybe that someone
else commissioned,

00:18:22.390 --> 00:18:26.310
that have been played once, that
type of thing and that's going

00:18:26.310 --> 00:18:30.650
to the piece by Adam Shurnberg
that we're playing today.

00:18:30.650 --> 00:18:35.690 position:56%
And that wasn't actually written for
us, but across our careers we've run

00:18:35.690 --> 00:18:39.410
into a lot of composers and
composers that we really

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:42.690
like as people and whose
music we really enjoy.

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:46.110
And we always ask if they
have a wind quintet already

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:50.480
that we could read and see
if we'd like to perform

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.490
and when we're commissioning music
and when we're performing music

00:18:54.490 --> 00:19:00.000
or selecting music to perform, we
look for a few key ingredients.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:02.710
I think the most important thing,

00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:07.680
which fortunately Paul's piece
really got quite well is the

00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:09.570
playability for wind
instruments because a lot

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:11.320
of composers will write for winds

00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:14.720
without truly understanding
the voices of wind instruments

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:16.750 position:56%
and what we can do and how we shine.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:18.850
And so that's one of
the main things.

00:19:18.850 --> 00:19:24.000
We're always looking for new
iterations of wind quintet sounds.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:28.950 position:56%
One of the things that is, one of
the things about the wind quintet is

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:32.990
that our repertoire compared
to the repertoire of a lot

00:19:32.990 --> 00:19:36.150
of other chamber ensembles
is quite limited.

00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:40.430
Most composers wrote one or
two pieces for wind quintet,

00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:43.480
if they wrote anything for wind
quintet and there's some composers

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:46.160
that were very prolific
for wind quintet,

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:49.200
but those pieces are quite
similar to each other

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:54.170
and so what we have is a relatively
limited pool of repertoire and so

00:19:54.170 --> 00:19:58.020
when we're looking for composers
that want to add to that repertoire

00:19:58.020 --> 00:19:59.640
that have added to that repertoire.

00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.590
We want to find new sounds and
things that are really interesting

00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:08.650 position:56%
to us and the other thing that we're
really looking for is we're looking

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:14.290
for a composer that doesn't just
want to write a piece that's based

00:20:14.290 --> 00:20:19.330
on anything, but we really like
music that will tell a story.

00:20:19.330 --> 00:20:22.470
And that's been something
that's very important

00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:27.780 position:56%
to us throughout our careers because
we find that audiences will relate

00:20:27.780 --> 00:20:30.560
to a piece of new music that
they haven't heard before

00:20:30.560 --> 00:20:33.130
if they can relate to
the story behind it.

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.730
If they can understand
where it's coming from,

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:38.000
even before they've heard it, then
that's something that they're going

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:41.030
to be able to appreciate without
ever having heard it before.

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:46.460
I think one of the, one of
the disadvantages of new music

00:20:46.460 --> 00:20:50.220
for audiences being connected to
it from the beginning is simply

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.170
that they haven't heard it before
and so that's one of the things

00:20:54.170 --> 00:20:58.160
that unfortunately can't overcome,
can't send a CD ahead of time

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.680
and say listen to this and come to
the concert and hear us perform it.

00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:08.040 position:56%
And so we look for ways in the music
that we can connect to the audience

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.490
on an emotional; level so
that they're able to feel

00:21:10.490 --> 00:21:15.700 position:56%
as though they've heard it before in
a small place in their heart rather

00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:18.050
than actually heard it before.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:22.630
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: By tells a story,
are you privileging narrative

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:24.920 position:56%
in particular or more just something

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:27.940
about the piece that
it has a graspable?

00:21:27.940 --> 00:21:29.360
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson:
A graspable point.

00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.730
So it might be a narrative, but
it also might just be the relation

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.350
to the Gran Partita,
it might be something,

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:41.100
some other graspable exactly.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:44.490
So something that they can
hold onto and relate to.

00:21:44.490 --> 00:21:46.750
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well I think it's
a, one thing that I think is very,

00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:52.030
a very positive thing that you
do and that I've always thought

00:21:52.030 --> 00:21:55.190
that there should be ensembles
out there that dedicate themselves

00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:57.900
to the second performance
of works [laughter]

00:21:57.900 --> 00:22:02.770
because this is often the plaint of
composers who will write a piece,

00:22:02.770 --> 00:22:05.740
it'll be performed a few
times, and, or one time,

00:22:05.740 --> 00:22:09.170
and then it doesn't get picked
up because of a particular type

00:22:09.170 --> 00:22:12.210
of commissioning culture that
sometimes is there, which is,

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:14.740
it's nice to see though
that there are more and more

00:22:14.740 --> 00:22:18.770
of these co-commissioning
consortia that come together to

00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:22.500
and immediately give
some pieces a leg up

00:22:22.500 --> 00:22:25.560
and that's a nice thing to see too.

00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.090
I guess would there be anything
more that you would like to add

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:31.040
about the pieces tonight?

00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:34.470
In particular Paul's piece that
we haven't already talked about?

00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:38.160
Before I let you go to
go ahead and get ready.

00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.060
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson: Well there's
some more really interesting names

00:22:41.060 --> 00:22:42.360
of the movement.

00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.660 position:56%
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Oh yes, absolutely.

00:22:43.660 --> 00:22:44.960
Please go into that.

00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:46.260
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson: I
thought about adding them

00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:47.560
when you were talking
about it, but --

00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.860
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Please.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:50.160
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson: So one
of the most interesting ones

00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:54.390
and it took us a while to
really understand is the second

00:22:54.390 --> 00:22:58.480
to last movement, which
is La De Da Da De Da,

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:00.950
La Da De De Da De Da and --

00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:02.250
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Almost.

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.140
[ Laughter ]

00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:05.440
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson: And
we were looking at it,

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.630
it's like La De Da Da Da De Da Da
Da La De Da Da, so we're trying

00:23:09.630 --> 00:23:10.940
to figure out what
does this relate to?

00:23:10.940 --> 00:23:12.240
Where does this come from?

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:14.450
And then in the music
there's a passage

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:17.800
which is Da Da Da Da
De Da Da Da De Da Da Da

00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:21.290 position:56%
and it goes throughout the piece and
so we were just rehearsing the piece

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:22.690 position:56%
and we kind of given up on the name.

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:24.610
We hadn't really understood
the relation yet

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:28.290
and we were just rehearsing it
one day and it, we were trying

00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:33.240
to sing this passage and it came
out as the title of the piece

00:23:33.240 --> 00:23:37.890
and so we understood in that
moment where it came from.

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:39.190
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: There's also,

00:23:39.190 --> 00:23:41.300
there's like a movement called
the Joy of B Flat Minor?

00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:42.600
Is that right or -- -

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:43.900
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Yeah that's right.

00:23:43.900 --> 00:23:45.200
&gt;&gt; Tracy Jacobson: Yeah.

00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.500
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Which
has a precedent.

00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:49.370
I believe you have another piece
called the Joy of F Sharp Minor.

00:23:49.370 --> 00:23:52.190
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: The
Joy of F Sharp Minor.

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.490
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Right [laughter].

00:23:53.490 --> 00:23:56.410
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: More than F Sharp
Minor, this is B Flat Minor.

00:23:56.410 --> 00:23:57.820
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So
you've got some B,

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.120
it's a little series
that could have --

00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.510
[ Inaudible Response ]

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:07.040
[ Laughter ]

00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:08.430
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well thank
you so much for being here

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:10.790
and for talking with us a bit.

00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:12.970
We'll let you go get ready
and I'm sure you're going

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:14.760
to enjoy the concert very much.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:17.510
Let's give a round
of applause for --

00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:28.340
[ Applause ]

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:31.850
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: And so I'm going
to talk a bit more with Paul.

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:34.770
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Yeah, go ahead.

00:24:34.770 --> 00:24:36.890
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Oh sure.

00:24:36.890 --> 00:24:42.720
One, I was mentioning to him
earlier that my first introduction

00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.700
to his music was through a composer
named Scott Lindroth through,

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:50.350
I forgotten the title of it, but
It's Table Clear, which is a piece

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:56.550
from 1990 and the, speaking
of a story element behind it,

00:24:56.550 --> 00:25:01.270
I believe at that point
it was a recording

00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:04.350
of your Children Clearing
the Table, is that where,

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:07.800
the kind of the genesis
of that work?

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.740
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Yeah.

00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:13.500
Several times, I have two
children; Jonah and Caleb

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:19.330
and they're five years apart
and several times before that,

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:23.090
you know I just sort of
tap something on the glass

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:27.700
and they'd tap on the glass and
we'd bang some pots and pans

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:31.490
and they'd bang pots and pans.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:37.010
And Hannah would leave
the room [laughter].

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:40.820
So one night after dinner
I said well why not sort

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:43.040
of make something out of this.

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:48.740
So I got a tape recorder and I set
the kids free in the kitchen just

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.410
to bang on whatever they
wanted and I recorded them.

00:25:52.410 --> 00:25:53.710
And they were great.

00:25:53.710 --> 00:25:57.220
They, Caleb discovered that
if you hit the back of the pan

00:25:57.220 --> 00:26:02.840
in a certain way it goes boing,
boing and Jonah got out his violin

00:26:02.840 --> 00:26:05.700
and had some pluck notes.

00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:11.510
And this is the only piece,
I think it's the only piece,

00:26:11.510 --> 00:26:14.790
well at a certain point in
the recording Caleb decided

00:26:14.790 --> 00:26:17.210
to use his own body for noises.

00:26:17.210 --> 00:26:22.450
So he did armpit farts and
that's in the piece [laughter]

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.320
and he could also burp
on command [laughter].

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.910
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Talented family.

00:26:27.910 --> 00:26:29.210
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Yeah I can't do it.

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:30.510
I don't know.

00:26:30.510 --> 00:26:33.560
Jonah can't do it either, but
Caleb can do it [laughter]

00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.590 position:56%
and so I'm very proud of this piece.

00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:43.520
I, it's consistent about 30 or
40 sounds and I sort of start

00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:47.560
out with a scenario that could
actually really be something

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.860
that might happen.

00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:54.200
It's sort of, you know rhythmic and
slow and it gets faster and faster

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:58.990 position:56%
until it sort of starts to swirl and
it's supposed to be a kind of dream

00:26:58.990 --> 00:27:03.330
like scenario where you get into
this swirling world and then all

00:27:03.330 --> 00:27:05.670
of a sudden it stops
and it's clapping sounds

00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:08.150
and armpits and things like that.

00:27:08.150 --> 00:27:10.730
And then there's a big long
sustained section which I put

00:27:10.730 --> 00:27:17.200
in last in the process and
at the end Caleb saying

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.030
that will be the best part.

00:27:19.030 --> 00:27:21.040
[ Laughter ]

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:23.040
It's the only piece I know
that uses armpit farts

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:24.740
and carries the same commentary.

00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:27.130
[ Laughter ]

00:27:27.130 --> 00:27:30.400
So you can hear it on
the [inaudible], I can.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:35.120
Table's Clear, the title comes
from a Street Car Named Desire

00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:39.780
when Blanche DuBois asks Stanley
Kowalski to clear the table

00:27:39.780 --> 00:27:43.510
and he just [laughter]
clears, table's clear.

00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:46.090
[ Laughter ]

00:27:46.090 --> 00:27:48.810
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: I bring up that
piece in particular because it kind

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:54.290
of represents one of many
different avenues that you pursued

00:27:54.290 --> 00:27:58.240
over the course of your
career and a lot of these,

00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.960
I know that there's
this sort of break,

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:03.490
not a break in a negative sense,

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.570
but a change that happened
in terms of ways.

00:28:05.570 --> 00:28:08.190
You started to do a bit
more non-electronic,

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:11.110
non-computer music fairly
recently or at least starting

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:13.620
in the late-90's and to the 2000's,

00:28:13.620 --> 00:28:19.250
but before that you were doing
predominantly, I believe,

00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:22.490
computer music and
electronic music both synthesis

00:28:22.490 --> 00:28:27.730
and in this case taking recordings
and then putting them together.

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:32.480
One thing I noticed about
this music in general and also

00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:37.110
with everything else I've heard
that doesn't involve the computer,

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:43.580
computer in a major capacity, is
that you immediately get a sense

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:46.450
of a sound world of a piece
from it, of a piece of music.

00:28:46.450 --> 00:28:48.350
You don't get this, you
don't feel like oh no,

00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:51.750
here's an electronic piece that's
going to be, you know building

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:54.990 position:56%
for 30 minutes and I have to, you
know not that there's anything wrong

00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:57.470
with those types of
pieces, but you feel like,

00:28:57.470 --> 00:29:00.210
I feel like you build
this world very quickly

00:29:00.210 --> 00:29:04.880
and one thing I would love to hear
you speak about is that process

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:10.990
of building that world because
you have such distinctive ways

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:14.040
of creating the sounds that are,
it's a different type of thing

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.020
to say to write a wind
quintet than it is to actually,

00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:20.780
you know create the sounds from
the ground up or collect the sounds

00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.950
and put them together
in a particular way.

00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:27.920
Some of them are more labor
intensive, I don't know.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:29.720
What is your experience with that?

00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:35.360
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Well I grew up in
the really learning to love music

00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:38.140
in the 50's and the 60's and part

00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:40.260
of what I did was just
listen to records.

00:29:40.260 --> 00:29:42.740
My father actually was a
recording engineer and he worked

00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:46.510
for Capital Records in New York
and so I spent a lot of time,

00:29:46.510 --> 00:29:50.890
you know visiting his recording
studio and so recording

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.300
in general is very
interesting to me.

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:58.650 position:56%
And I realized probably quite early
on that there, as far as Avant Garde

00:29:58.650 --> 00:30:05.740 position:56%
or experimental or electronic music,
is really a sort of a bifurcation

00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:10.030
of different kinds of
uses of loud speakers.

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:15.160
The standard electronic model, the
loud speaker is the instrument,

00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:21.370
you know it goes crunch and
squeak and squeal and grind and,

00:30:21.370 --> 00:30:24.560
and that's sort of you
know what we come to expect

00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:28.790 position:56%
from electronic music, but one thing
that I liked a lot was the idea

00:30:28.790 --> 00:30:33.510
that loud speakers are
windows into a virtual space.

00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.040
Let me repeat that.

00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.860
Windows into a virtual space.

00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:39.200
So you know you listen
to a recording

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:43.770
and if the recording is done
well, then this real tendency

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:48.310
of the recording engineer
to create the illusion

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:52.310
that something is actually
happening in the loud speakers

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:55.040
and I got very interesting
in doing that sort of thing

00:30:55.040 --> 00:30:57.880
with electronic music and
creating the impression

00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.440
that there's a world beyond,

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:04.320
behind the loud speakers
that's functioning that way.

00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:08.230
And I spent a lot of
time working with voice.

00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:14.150
I used Hannah, I'm very lucky to
have a, such a wonderful reader

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:17.650
for my pieces and I spent
a lot of time trying

00:31:17.650 --> 00:31:20.540
to model real instruments.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:24.130
And to get real instruments,
to get the sound of a violin

00:31:24.130 --> 00:31:28.510
or the sound of, you
know armpit farts.

00:31:28.510 --> 00:31:31.040
[ Laughter ]

00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:35.660
And so a lot of my, most of my
pieces, actually I think almost all

00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:41.320
of my electronic pieces consist of
something that is a virtual world

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:46.850
of its own and this became
sort of an obsession with me

00:31:46.850 --> 00:31:52.990
and then one day I thought well
rather than synthesize the violin,

00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:55.460
why not use a real violin?

00:31:55.460 --> 00:32:03.850
And I had done a lot of
things with recording players

00:32:03.850 --> 00:32:08.310
and using their sounds, but to
actually use the real violin

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:12.550
in a way that real
violinist would appreciate.

00:32:12.550 --> 00:32:19.730
Sort of the point of the
exercise, so there's a real,

00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:22.070
I don't want to go
too far afield here,

00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:25.350
but let me just say really quickly
that there's a different kind

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:31.100
of compositional conception
behind created and frozen

00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:35.510
in time electronic music
and music for instruments.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:39.520
One thing that I like a lot
of is the idea of danger

00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.430
in music, in performance.

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:46.060
So when you hear somebody perform,
there's always the possibility

00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.930
that they'll miss a
note, that they'll die

00:32:47.930 --> 00:32:51.290
of a heart attack [laughter], that,

00:32:51.290 --> 00:32:52.590
you know something
strange will happen.

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:55.970
With electronic music, it's
always fixed and the only thing

00:32:55.970 --> 00:32:59.670
that can happen really is the
tape machine will break down,

00:32:59.670 --> 00:33:01.030
which has happened actually.

00:33:01.030 --> 00:33:03.040
[ Laughter ]

00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.480
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: At the same
time you have these certain times

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:07.750
where you have referential things
like say with cars going by

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:09.520
or something like that
where you do get the sense

00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:11.370
of potentially sense of --

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:15.340
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Yeah so almost
all the, I think I have one piece

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.700
that I did toward the end
of my time doing this,

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:21.460
which is truly electronic.

00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:26.520
It doesn't reference real world
sounds, but all of the pieces,

00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.860
virtually all the pieces that
I did consist of some aspect

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.300
of focusing on realities.

00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:42.400 position:56%
Some way to sort of peer into a real
world and it got, it was getting old

00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:45.700
around 2005 or 6 with
Table's Clear turned

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:51.930 position:56%
out to be a cathartic experience and
percussionist in particular ask me

00:33:51.930 --> 00:33:57.810 position:56%
for a transcription of Table's Clear
and there's no way I can do that.

00:33:57.810 --> 00:34:00.780
I mean I used all kinds of
random number generators

00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:03.040
and different things
to create the rhythms

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.670
and textures of Table's Clear.

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:07.750
So that got me into
writing percussion music

00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:12.000 position:56%
and I've written a lot of percussion
music and it's a different world.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:17.150
You know I was basically
60 when I started sort of,

00:34:17.150 --> 00:34:18.700 position:56%
when I finished doing computer music

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:21.260
and started doing this
stuff and it was great.

00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:26.850
It was like I was beginning
again and starting over.

00:34:26.850 --> 00:34:28.820
So it's been a really
interesting voyage.

00:34:28.820 --> 00:34:35.030
You know, my one regret is that,
well let me not go into regrets.

00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:37.040
[ Laughter ]

00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:39.380
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well it's,
there are certain things

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.290
that you said that, one thing that
I would like to say about your,

00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.540
many of your pieces in
general is that there's

00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:48.730
that great deal of activity.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:52.660
There's a lot of things to say
with granular types of processes

00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:56.810
and things like that going on,
but they're so controlled both

00:34:56.810 --> 00:35:02.320
like in a tonal sense, well in
many cases a harmonic sense,

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:07.890
but also a sense of like you find
the pitch material and the types

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:11.630 position:56%
of things in the types of sound that
you're using and you control them

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:14.600
so clearly even with
all this activity.

00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:19.760
So it feels like there's this
great undercurrent of energy,

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:22.510
but you're kind of suppressing
it and kind of floating atop

00:35:22.510 --> 00:35:24.570
and I don't know if
that's just something

00:35:24.570 --> 00:35:27.200
that has always been a part of
your music or do you think of it

00:35:27.200 --> 00:35:30.200
that way at all or maybe not.

00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:33.250
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Well,
it's complicated.

00:35:33.250 --> 00:35:42.390
I did a piece in 1984 called Idle
Chatter, which has gotten a lot

00:35:42.390 --> 00:35:49.000
of play and I started, I was
inspired by actually a trip,

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.450
driving into New York City going
through the Lincoln Tunnel coming

00:35:53.450 --> 00:35:54.900
out at the end of the
Lincoln Tunnel.

00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:58.820
Some people how lived in New York
remember the days when the mouth

00:35:58.820 --> 00:36:05.400
of the Lincoln Tunnel was really a
pretty seedy place and you came out

00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.110
and there was a bunch of teenagers,
[inaudible] teenagers standing

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:12.870
around the cop, sort of bouncing
up and down and he had a smile

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:17.550
on his face and I rolled down
the window and they were doing,

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:21.110
you know a rap to the cop
and he was enjoying it

00:36:21.110 --> 00:36:24.010
and I thought well what
a great idea for a piece.

00:36:24.010 --> 00:36:29.180
So I went home and started to
do it and I took Hannah's voice

00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:34.620
and chopped it up into little bits
and tuned the bits and I started

00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:39.280
to do a real fancy, you know
harmonic thing with all kinds

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:42.600
of weird chords and it just
became totally exhausting.

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:48.380 position:56%
So I narrowed it down to an F. Every
one doing F and that time it's good,

00:36:48.380 --> 00:36:51.280
but it got a little old after
a while so I added an E flat

00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:55.730
and then I added D and B
flat and I had B flat major.

00:36:55.730 --> 00:37:00.720
And you have to realize that in
the late 70's and early 80's,

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:05.180 position:56%
that Princeton, nobody was taken
seriously if they wrote tonal music.

00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:08.550
You know we were all
sort of experimentalists

00:37:08.550 --> 00:37:13.110
and I had done my share of fancy
ways of organizing harmony,

00:37:13.110 --> 00:37:16.230
but I realized that the
computer actually freed me

00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:20.710
up to write tonal music and
I love writing tonal music.

00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:22.010
I love tonality.

00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:26.010
I think tonality is one of
the great accomplishments

00:37:26.010 --> 00:37:34.200
of western civilization and the
piece sort of flowed in tonal terms

00:37:34.200 --> 00:37:39.350
and since then, most of my pieces
are in way or another diatonic.

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:44.270
I don't, the piece tonight
is very explicitly diatonic.

00:37:44.270 --> 00:37:46.770
I do other pieces which
are more or less diatonic

00:37:46.770 --> 00:37:50.620
and so the electronic sort
of freed me, in a way.

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:58.800 position:56%
So I still got respect, but I could,
I can do things with tonality.

00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:00.210
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well
one, one other thing

00:38:00.210 --> 00:38:02.850
that I have always been
curious about, I think people

00:38:02.850 --> 00:38:06.760
who haven't tried to produce
their own electronic music,

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:11.220
especially back when, you know
you had to rent time at a computer

00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:14.220
if you were going to
or you know just be

00:38:14.220 --> 00:38:15.520
on the [speaking over one another].

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.820
Really, oh wow.

00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:18.840
That was at university.

00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:20.850
So back in the day when
it was really you had

00:38:20.850 --> 00:38:24.290
to invest a great deal of time
to get any sort of feedback

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:27.900
versus today when you have a
bit more of immediate feedback,

00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:32.300
but not necessarily mastery
of say if somebody were just

00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:33.880
to go and look at software.

00:38:33.880 --> 00:38:35.240
They would have some
immediate feedback,

00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.640
but they wouldn't still
have mastery of that,

00:38:37.640 --> 00:38:40.450
how to produce exactly
what they want to produce.

00:38:40.450 --> 00:38:44.860
How does that compare what you were
doing in those days versus the way

00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:46.460
that you approach composition now?

00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:50.030
Do you, are you thankful
that you have like,

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:56.200
that you're a bit divorced from
those technological impediments

00:38:56.200 --> 00:39:00.040
or was that something that
helped the compositional process?

00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:03.360
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Well I loved
getting under the hood.

00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.620
I actually wrote a lot of software.

00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:11.710
I discovered strangely that I
had a knack for writing software

00:39:11.710 --> 00:39:15.000
and I did a lot of it, but I
always did it in the service

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.810
of a piece in one way or another.

00:39:16.810 --> 00:39:18.980
So what was your question?

00:39:18.980 --> 00:39:21.710
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: So the amount
of time that you would take just

00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:25.730
to be able to get to where you, and
then utilize that software or --

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:28.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Oh it was very slow.

00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:32.610
I typically spend the
year on a piece

00:39:32.610 --> 00:39:38.150
and you mentioned the Six Fantasies
on a Poem by Thomas Campion,

00:39:38.150 --> 00:39:39.990
which I did in the late 70's.

00:39:39.990 --> 00:39:44.260
It took me a year and a half and
it was a very tedious process.

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.910
For that piece I can actually
work at home with the line

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:54.620
at a time monitor, 30
characters a second,

00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:59.190
which just was transmitting code
and then I'd have to go into school

00:39:59.190 --> 00:40:04.690
and sign out a digital tape and
take the digital tape into a lab,

00:40:04.690 --> 00:40:08.050
which had mini computers.

00:40:08.050 --> 00:40:12.060
We used Hewlett Packard's very
first computer and there was noise

00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.800
and whirling and it was
called the D Day converter

00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:18.680
and I remember picking my son Jonah
up from nursery school one day

00:40:18.680 --> 00:40:22.040
and I said he had a friend I had
to take home too and I said we have

00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:27.200
to go to the D Day converter and
Jonah said he was I guess five

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:33.510
at the time, maybe six, said have
you ever been to a D Day converter?

00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:36.150
[ Laughter ]

00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:39.470
And I often wondered what
his consciousness was

00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:43.950
like because he would go and hear
his mother's voice trans modified

00:40:43.950 --> 00:40:46.380
over a loud speaker.

00:40:46.380 --> 00:40:51.690
So the process was fun and I
had patience for it and I seemed

00:40:51.690 --> 00:40:56.800
to get a lot of music out of
it, but it's almost the case

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:59.960
that these days when
it's so easy to do.

00:40:59.960 --> 00:41:03.260
That, you know the sort
of fun is taken out of it.

00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:05.270
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well I think in
some cases it might be easy to get

00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:08.760
that start, but it's harder
to sometimes hear that mastery

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:12.660
that you're presenting in all
these pieces over the years.

00:41:13.710 --> 00:41:15.650
With new projects that
you're up to you mentioned

00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:17.980
that you're doing some
more percussion music?

00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:21.040
I know that [inaudible] percussion,
you did a quartet for them.

00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:25.250 position:56%
Do you have anything else coming up?

00:41:25.250 --> 00:41:29.540
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: I just heard
a song for guitar and voice

00:41:29.540 --> 00:41:35.960
about insomnia [laughter] and
the song is, I wrote the words,

00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:37.940
the song is called Just Once

00:41:37.940 --> 00:41:41.330
and the insomniac says
just once let me sleep

00:41:41.330 --> 00:41:43.550
through the night [laughter].

00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:44.850
So --

00:41:44.850 --> 00:41:47.660
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Is that
for David Stirbin also --

00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:50.980
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: No, it's for Bill
Anderson who composes [inaudible]

00:41:50.980 --> 00:41:56.100
for New Jersey and yeah I have
a bunch of other pieces in the,

00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:58.060
but nice thing about
being retired is

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:00.780 position:56%
that I can devote all my time to it.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:04.600
So it's fun.

00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:05.900
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well that's great.

00:42:05.900 --> 00:42:09.450
I think maybe we'll open it up to
ask if anybody has any questions

00:42:09.450 --> 00:42:10.750
that they want to ask you.

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:12.520
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Yeah, please
ask me a question [laughter].

00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.560
I'll do what I used to do with
undergraduates, I say I'm going

00:42:15.560 --> 00:42:17.510

&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Yes actually
the last piece I did,

00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:32.740
electronic piece was a piece
for the Laptop Orchestra.

00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:39.170
It's called the Guy
Walks into a Modal Bar.

00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:41.550
It uses things called
modal bar synthesis.

00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:44.840
We had a guy at Princeton named
Perry Cook who was very good

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:47.620
at doing what are called
physical models, that is instead

00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:53.040 position:56%
of modeling the way the sound works,
the way the sound sort of evolves

a pop and decay, it actually is,

00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:06.470
well for a flute for example,
you have the right going wave

00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:08.650
and the returning wave
and that sort of thing.

&gt;&gt; Hi, you were talking
about tonality.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:51.690
You use the word diatonic,
which I'm,

00:43:51.690 --> 00:43:56.440
to be honest with you
not very familiar with.

00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:59.650
Can you explain that
a little bit more.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:01.950 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: What diatonic means?

00:44:01.950 --> 00:44:03.250
&gt;&gt; Yes, please.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:04.840
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Yeah, you
hear a whole slew of notes

00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:07.730 position:56%
and you reference them in one way or
another, if you're, you know I think

00:44:07.730 --> 00:44:10.710 position:56%
with Milton Babbitt and George
Pearl and other composers like that,

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:14.340
they reference them as notes
of the chromatic scale.

00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:17.630
With, one thing I love
about tonality is that,

00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:22.910
or using diatonic tonality as
a model is that you hear a note

00:44:22.910 --> 00:44:24.950
and you think of it
as a scale degree.

00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:31.220 position:56%
So if I go [singing harmony] you can
think of that as, or you can think

00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:37.150
of it as the third note of a G
major scale [singing harmony].

00:44:37.150 --> 00:44:39.510
Or you can think of it as the
second note of an A major scale.

[ Singing Harmony ]

00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:49.450
[Inaudible] in a performance and
when I used to teach tonal harmony

00:44:49.450 --> 00:44:51.230
to beginners, I would
take the [inaudible]

00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:53.190

which starts

00:44:53.190 --> 00:44:56.510
out with a G major chord
with a B on the top.

[ Singing Harmony ]

00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.840

00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:08.050
[ Singing Harmony ]

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:14.200
So you just, the ability to locate
a note as a place in a scale.

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:18.380
So the note has a quality and a
meaning that depends a lot on,

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:23.830
you know the tonal context and
I guess the short answer is

00:45:23.830 --> 00:45:27.170
when I think of things in diatonic
terms, I do think of things

00:45:27.170 --> 00:45:29.370
as members of a, as scale degrees.

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:33.210
So it's, you know it's
the second scale degree

00:45:33.210 --> 00:45:34.510
or it's the first scale degree.

00:45:34.510 --> 00:45:37.640
So the note has a quality
and the wonderful thing

00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:40.370
about this is I don't want
to go too far afield here,

00:45:40.370 --> 00:45:42.950
but the wonderful thing about
this is it give you a metric

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:44.950
for distance.

00:45:44.950 --> 00:45:50.850 position:56%
You do something in G major and it's
going to be very far from B major

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:55.110
and the wonderful thing Beethoven
does, he jumps from G major

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:59.080
to the B major and then sort
of wonders back to G major.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:03.050

that I'm thinking about.

60's on new theories of harmony.

with George Pearl

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:18.440

00:46:30.420 --> 00:46:34.600

the knowledge of a system and --

work quite the same way.

that probably confuses you more

about composing electronic

that you don't need a performer,
at least not a living performer

and then you go back to composing
music that required performance.

00:47:34.300 --> 00:47:37.650

felt about suddenly having

00:47:37.650 --> 00:47:41.520
to have performers
involved in your work?

&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Well that
actually became the focus

00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:47.290
of my intention especially
with percussion music.

00:47:47.290 --> 00:47:50.290
When I started to write
percussion music,

00:47:50.290 --> 00:47:53.740
I guess my first really percussion
piece was a piece called Threads,

00:47:53.740 --> 00:47:56.050
which I did in 2005.

00:47:56.050 --> 00:47:59.890
When I first started to do
percussion music, it was very much

00:47:59.890 --> 00:48:03.130
like doing electronic music.

00:48:03.130 --> 00:48:07.210

worry about attack and decay and so

00:48:07.210 --> 00:48:11.020
that felt great, but at a
certain point I lost the thread,

00:48:11.020 --> 00:48:17.690
pardon the pun, and it started to
get mysterious and then I realized

00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:22.820
that one of my roles as a
composer was to be a choreographer

00:48:22.820 --> 00:48:27.680
and with percussionist, that's
really the name of the game.

00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:31.430
You know, I imagine them
moving in various kinds

00:48:31.430 --> 00:48:34.770

00:48:36.070 --> 00:48:38.460
Well it is now.

00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:42.380
I imagine them moving in
various ways and you know

00:48:42.380 --> 00:48:46.100
like with greased chests
and big drums

00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:51.790 position:56%
and when you see a percussion
group, there are some percussionists

00:48:51.790 --> 00:48:55.450
who are like dancers
and so the notion

00:48:55.450 --> 00:49:01.040 position:56%
of being a choreographer became part
of the, part of the whole action.

00:49:01.040 --> 00:49:04.580 position:56%
I liked that a lot, so I'm actually,

00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.770
a lot of my electronic
music had been danced to,

00:49:07.770 --> 00:49:09.710
but I would never persuaded by it.

00:49:09.710 --> 00:49:13.350
But looking at, you know
a percussion ensemble

00:49:13.350 --> 00:49:18.650
as a dance troop really makes
it seem quite different.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.660
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Just to follow up
on that, you had mentioned earlier

00:49:23.660 --> 00:49:28.030 position:56%
that a lot of the work you were
doing in electronic music was trying

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:31.460
to get towards a more realistic
sound like something that was

00:49:31.460 --> 00:49:35.500
in the real world, but
that was created by you.

00:49:36.610 --> 00:49:38.100
Is there any flip of that?

00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:42.650
Do you find with non-electronic
music that you're writing,

00:49:42.650 --> 00:49:46.950
do you find yourself moving back in
some way towards a different type

00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:49.510
of ideal idiom or something
like that?

00:49:49.510 --> 00:49:51.560
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: Well
it's really different.

00:49:51.560 --> 00:49:55.750
One thing that I have to admit is

00:49:55.750 --> 00:50:00.120
that when I was doing electronic
music, it was before the days

00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.670
of computer programs that
could write your score for you

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:08.700
and I remember writing a,
spending six months writing a piece

00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:12.810
and spending a year writing
the parts and then hearing it

00:50:12.810 --> 00:50:15.350
and wishing I could revise it.

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:18.400
So the great thing
about these programs is

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:25.920
that it makes revision possible
and my publisher is very graceful

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:30.040
about it and doesn't make too much
of fuss when I say please throw

00:50:30.040 --> 00:50:31.340

Also one thing that
it makes possible,

00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:49.090
which I like a lot is
it makes it possible

00:50:49.090 --> 00:50:53.390
to compose and out of order.

00:50:53.390 --> 00:50:55.700
So you know you write
something and then you say well,

00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:59.060
in the middle of that there
should be this, something longer,

00:50:59.060 --> 00:51:01.410
and actually the beginning
should be different

00:51:01.410 --> 00:51:03.410
or there should be an
additional part of the beginning.

00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:10.520
So I don't compose in, things
in time the ordered ways.

00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:13.560
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Well as
before you would be forced

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:16.560
to put together the
program, compile it,

00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:19.730
and go through that before
you get any feedback?

00:51:19.730 --> 00:51:21.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: It's very different.

00:51:21.120 --> 00:51:25.250
It's very different and I'm
very glad that I did it.

00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:27.850
You know I loved writing
electronic music.

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:31.950
It was great, you know I'd go
up to my studio after breakfast,

00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:38.280
in my bathrobe, and I'd just
play with sound and it was great

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:41.080
and now I can play with
sound to a certain extent,

00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:43.630
except you know the many
realizations as you do it,

00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:47.150
you're pieces always sound
so dreadful that you have

00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:49.320
to know what you're doing.

00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:55.130
But it's very different and I love
this, one thing I really liked

00:51:55.130 --> 00:52:00.230
about doing electronic music was
the feeling of being in a studio,

00:52:00.230 --> 00:52:06.340
a pottery studio or a, you
know any kind of studio

00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:11.780
where you fabricate something and
I'm a great admirer of composers

00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:15.670
who can just sort of write a piece
out and, with a pencil and paper.

00:52:15.670 --> 00:52:20.870

you know the feeling of being

You're actually, as I said you're
scripting activity for humans to do.

abstract piece, you're writing,

you're choreographing something that
performers are going to want to,

00:53:11.020 --> 00:53:13.890
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: Somebody
please, we have one over here.

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:25.070
&gt;&gt; So I'm impressed that in the
audio file world people are going

00:53:25.070 --> 00:53:31.840
from transistors back to vacuum
tubes and you composed during

00:53:31.840 --> 00:53:35.580
that period of transition, I
would assume, where you started

00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:37.890
with the amplification
was more based

00:53:37.890 --> 00:53:40.630
on tubes moving into transistors.

00:53:40.630 --> 00:53:47.260
Did you sense a lack of warmth as
things became so fully digital?

00:53:47.260 --> 00:53:52.760
&gt;&gt; Paul Lansky: I sort
of think this whole back

00:53:52.760 --> 00:54:00.460
to vinyl is simple minded.

00:54:00.460 --> 00:54:05.150
My first experience with the
difference between digital

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:08.190
and vinyl was with
my Campion Fantasies.

00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:12.020
I did the piece, I spent the year

00:54:12.020 --> 00:54:14.100
and a half doing it,
and it was great.

00:54:14.100 --> 00:54:18.130
I was very proud of it
and I got a recording.

00:54:18.130 --> 00:54:19.620
It was issued on an LP

00:54:19.620 --> 00:54:24.700
when I composing recording
and it was great.

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:27.920
I played it, played
it once and at the end

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:33.300
of the thing there's a loud
part and it sounded awful.

00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:34.680
It sounded nothing like that.

00:54:34.680 --> 00:54:36.660
I asked my father what was going on

00:54:36.660 --> 00:54:40.590
and he said just inter
diameter distortion.

00:54:40.590 --> 00:54:44.640
It's the angle of the
needle changes with,

00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:48.960 position:56%
as you get to the end of the record.

00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.860
And I noticed back in those days,

00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:55.010
you know I still had good high
frequency hearing and I'd listen

00:54:55.010 --> 00:54:59.180
to a recording once and it sounded
great and I'd listen to it twice

00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:02.590
and the second time
it sounded less good.

00:55:02.590 --> 00:55:05.310
Actually a young faculty
members at Princeton used to wait

00:55:05.310 --> 00:55:10.190
at the record library to get
recordings of pieces that were,

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:13.970
that were, hadn't been played
so you can take them home

00:55:13.970 --> 00:55:16.880
and play them for the first time.

00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:22.030
So I was really not thrilled
with the analog world.

00:55:22.030 --> 00:55:24.520
Also the fact is that
if you made a copy

00:55:24.520 --> 00:55:27.380
of something you degrade the copy.

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:30.470
So after recording something,

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:33.490
you know recording something then
recording the recording of that

00:55:33.490 --> 00:55:35.430
and then recording
the recording of that,

00:55:35.430 --> 00:55:37.950
it gets more and more distorted.

00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:43.800
So I constantly was battling
with the, with the problems

00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:49.020
of analog recording and the thing
I love about digital recording is

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:56.290 position:56%
that you can copy it an infinite
number of times and I think this is,

00:55:56.290 --> 00:55:58.010
you know a significant difference.

00:55:58.010 --> 00:56:02.460
So it is, that's not to say
that there's not some problem

00:56:02.460 --> 00:56:07.290
with digital recording, but I
think that anything that you can do

00:56:07.290 --> 00:56:09.050
in analog you can do in digital

00:56:09.050 --> 00:56:13.320
if you have a high
enough sampling rate.

00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.850
Does that make sense?

00:56:14.850 --> 00:56:16.150
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:56:16.150 --> 00:56:17.450
&gt;&gt; David Plylar: That's
a great answer.

00:56:17.450 --> 00:56:21.870
Well thank you, let's thank Paul
Lansky for speaking with us today

00:56:21.870 --> 00:56:24.160 position:56%
and I hope you all enjoy his pieces.

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:25.960
I'm sure we all will.

00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:29.130
