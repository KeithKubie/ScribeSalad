There's still a lot of details on the page that you're going to need to

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.790
tweak before it looks exactly like the design mock up.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.740
And you should continue to tweak to make this portfolio page your own.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.950
At this point, it makes sense to get into the Code, Test, Refine process for

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.420
building your portfolio.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.190
Code part of the portfolio.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.540
Test your code by opening the page in the browser.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.470
And then refine your code once you see what's right and what's wrong.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.230
Then keep coding, keep testing, and keep refining.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.760
My suggestion is to start off by making the layout look as much like the mock up

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.000
as possible, and once you're happy with the layout, start customizing it.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.720
You can change the CSS or really, whatever you want.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.860
Because this is your portfolio and it should show off you.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.730
When you finish customizing, check this box to let us know that

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.200
you're happy with the way your portfolio looks.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.350
Then, think back to the process of building the portfolio.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:46.880
What was the hardest part for you?

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.120
Type your answer in here.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:48.970
Good luck.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.860
Jessica and I really can't wait to see your portfolios when you finish.
