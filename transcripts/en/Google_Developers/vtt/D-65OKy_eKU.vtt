[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.275 --> 00:00:06.400
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hey, there.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.310
We're in the AR and
VR tent right now.

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:12.070
And I'm going to play with some
of the coolest, latest stuff

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:13.580
from Tango and Daydream.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.750
Want to come along?

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.250
OK.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.560
See?

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.190
That's the Earth.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.940
I don't know much about this,
but my friend [? Aton ?]

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.774
over there, maybe he
can come explain it.

00:00:28.774 --> 00:00:30.766
SPEAKER 1: Hey, Timothy.

00:00:30.766 --> 00:00:31.690
All right.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.200
So here we are at the
Tango booth at Google I/O.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.950
And we're going to show off a
product that we announced today

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.080
called AR Expeditions.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:44.980
And this is all about
helping kids in schools

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.310
learn in a different way, in
a more immersive and intuitive

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.910
way.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.610
So we're actually
going to bring things

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.820
to them, in front of them,
compositing virtual objects

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.839
into the real world that
enable them to just see

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.380
the sun, and the
Earth, and the moon,

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.463
and some other things too.

00:01:00.463 --> 00:01:02.918
So Brandon over here is going
to help us out with that.

00:01:02.918 --> 00:01:04.209
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:01:04.209 --> 00:01:06.097
Let's check it out.

00:01:06.097 --> 00:01:06.680
BRANDON: Yeah.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.860
So what we're looking at
here is we can actually

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.260
see the Earth that
has been placed

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.650
in our actual physical space.

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.770
So we'd map the room, we
understand where we're at.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.260
And we can actually
allow students

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.960
to all experience
the Earth together,

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.770
and look around, and find
the five different hurricanes

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.090
that are around the Earth.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.670
We can do things like
switch to the moon.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.669
And you can see, actually,
the approximate location here

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:32.710
that Neil Armstrong landed
on the moon initially.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.640
TIMOTHY JORDAN: What?

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:34.240
BRANDON: Pretty awesome.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:34.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That is so cool.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.390
BRANDON: Pretty awesome.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.020
We can also see the sun.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.240
Can we actually go
around this side?

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.150
So we can see, if we go around
this side, the different layers

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.980
inside the sun and
how hot they are.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.017
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Whoa, that is crazy.

00:01:51.017 --> 00:01:52.850
BRANDON: Here, we can
see the inner planets.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.450
And students can
actually go, and explore,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.780
and see Earth and its relative
size to Mars or Venus.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.428
We can also see other planets
like Jupiter or Saturn.

00:02:06.428 --> 00:02:08.214
Look at that.

00:02:08.214 --> 00:02:09.880
And then kind of my
favorite is actually

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:12.400
looking at the asteroid belt,
because it seems like you're

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.629
flying through the asteroids.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:14.920
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.690
BRANDON: Pretty fun.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.030
And then finally,
on our exploration

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.910
of the solar system, you
can see dwarf planets

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:24.040
such as Haumea or Pluto.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.980
And Haumea really
interesting, because it's

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.227
this kind of
smashed-looking planet,

00:02:28.227 --> 00:02:30.310
something that would be
really hard to kind of get

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.560
a sense of if you weren't
being able to see this

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.540
placed in your physical
space and compared

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.610
to the other planets.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.317
So that's Expeditions AR.

00:02:39.317 --> 00:02:40.900
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's Expeditions AR.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:41.710
Thank you so much.

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:43.444
That is really cool.

00:02:43.444 --> 00:02:45.610
I'm just going to play with
this for a little while.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.240
You guys don't mind, do you?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.210
BRANDON: Let's go back
to the asteroid belt,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.620
because that one's the best one.

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.590
So you can kind of feel like
you're flying through space.

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.416
Take a look.

00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:57.892
Whoop.

00:02:57.892 --> 00:03:00.280
There it goes.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.155
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Whoa.

00:03:01.155 --> 00:03:02.110
BRANDON: There it is.

00:03:04.661 --> 00:03:06.345
You feel like you're
actually flying.

00:03:06.345 --> 00:03:07.720
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
And what's really

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.300
cool here is that we're all
playing in this same space

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.870
together.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:11.520
BRANDON: Yeah, this is great.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.080
Actually, there was an attendee
just earlier that was asking,

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.080
why would we want to bring
this in the classroom

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.630
and not just have them
work on their laptops?

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.620
But what's nice is instead
of being heads down

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.710
and exploring this on your own,
or kind of passively learning,

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.770
you can actually go and you can
move around the asteroid belt.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.810
You can move around
Jupiter or Saturn.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.510
And you can do that not just by
yourself, but with the teacher

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:32.800
or with the other students.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.320
And that's really
the power of Tango--

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.200
being able to have
this shared space

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.280
and use it as this
educational tool.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.280
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.029
Thank you so much.

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:44.260
BRANDON: Yup, thank you.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.343
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:03:45.343 --> 00:03:47.470
Let's go check out
some more cool stuff.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.510
SPEAKER 1: Here, we're
showing up a partnership

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.510
with Gap where they
want to allow people

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.120
to see what clothes might
look like on mannequins,

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.870
but in their home.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.500
So you can bring their whole
product catalog to your home.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.220
And so what we've got here
is a bunch of options.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.280
Maybe I'm looking for a dress.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.405
So I drop it into the
world, select a size.

00:04:09.405 --> 00:04:11.030
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm
a size 5, actually.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.071
SPEAKER 1: Oh, I'm sorry.

00:04:12.071 --> 00:04:13.810
I'm sorry, Timothy.

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.040
So we've got a size
6 mannequin here.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.709
And you can change
the size of the dress.

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.590
So you can see how an extra
small would look, a small would

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.600
look, or a medium.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.570
But sometimes I want to see
what a medium would look

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.940
like next to an extra small.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.120
So I can press the plus icon.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.760
And now I have two
mannequins in space.

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.400
And you can see one of
them has a medium, which

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.860
is a little bit looser
and more drapey.

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.810
And the other one
has an extra small.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.300
And you can get
right up in on them.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.580
You can see the
texture of the fabric.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:51.520
And they actually do a very
realistic physics simulation,

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:56.020
which is pretty cool too, to
get the drapiness correct.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.004
So this is just one way to
bring shopping into your home.

00:05:00.004 --> 00:05:01.170
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's cool.

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.154
Well, can I?

00:05:02.154 --> 00:05:02.820
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.030
Absolutely.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.810
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I
think what's really

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.790
neat is you could
sort of walk around it

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:11.640
like you do in a store, which
feels a lot different than just

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.705
pressing buttons on a web page.

00:05:13.705 --> 00:05:17.370
SPEAKER 1: Yeah, it gives you
a much better sense of scale

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.960
and how the garment's
actually going

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.210
to look on someone who's
roughly your body size.

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.122
So here, we have a
storytelling experience,

00:05:25.122 --> 00:05:27.330
where we're bringing some
characters from "The Wizard

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.850
of Oz" into the space.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:31.350
And we're doing
some special things.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:33.150
We're really working
on showing off

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.779
how well we can composite
them into the space

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:37.320
and light them
relative to the space.

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.540
You'll see what I
mean in a minute.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.730
But you can take
pictures with the Lion,

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:44.400
or the Scarecrow,
or the Tin Man.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.670
And yeah, it's a really
interesting and social AR

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:48.510
experience.

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.860
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.235
Well, maybe we
can show everybody

00:05:50.235 --> 00:05:52.500
what you see while I just
kind of stand over there.

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.166
SPEAKER 1: Sure.

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:55.590
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:57.330
Here, let me hand
you the microphone.

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.900
SPEAKER 1: Awesome.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:58.400
All right.

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.520
So here, we can have you take
a picture with a character.

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.430
So here, you're kind
of behind the Lion.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:06.870
You can stand next to him.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.220
We can see that
the Lion is here.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.240
And so now I will
take a picture.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:11.740
Ready?

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.830
Smile.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.280
Yeah, do a flex.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:17.820
Nice.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:19.660
That's a good picture.

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:20.160
Cool.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:24.420
So we've got a few pictures
of you with the friendly Lion.

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.970
So this is kind of what the
intro experience looks like.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.990
So if you want, you
can even hold it.

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:34.260
And you can kind of look around.

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:36.850
And you'll just get taken
through each character.

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:39.720
So the mode we used earlier was
just so you could take selfies.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:42.790
But this actually shows the
characters doing something.

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:45.370
You can see he's writing
on the actual wall there.

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:46.920
So that's the kind
of registration

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.520
that we have to the environment
in this scene, which

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.982
is really great.

00:06:51.982 --> 00:06:54.220
TIMOTHY JORDAN: (LAUGHING)
Oh-oh, poor Toto.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:58.049
SPEAKER 1: Yeah,
tornadoes are unfortunate.

00:06:58.049 --> 00:06:59.340
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:06:59.340 --> 00:06:59.840
All right.

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:02.939
Well, I think we have one more
Tango experience to check out.

00:07:02.939 --> 00:07:03.730
VIVEK: How are you?

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.060
TIMOTHY JORDAN: I'm good.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:04.740
How are you, Vivek?

00:07:04.740 --> 00:07:05.573
VIVEK: I'm good too.

00:07:05.573 --> 00:07:07.680
Thanks.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.120
So here, I'm going to
demonstrate the Constructor

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.660
app.

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.590
It's built on the
hardware and software

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:15.210
stack provided by Tango.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.930
So this is one of our new phones
that is being released by ASIS.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.750
It's coming around this summer.

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.750
So as you know,
the Tango phones,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:29.100
they have a depth sensor for
sensing the 3D environment.

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.890
It has a fisheye camera,
which is used for tracking

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:35.760
and that, in combination, we
are able to accurately get

00:07:35.760 --> 00:07:40.650
the 3D position of the
phone as you move around.

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:42.990
And so let me demonstrate
one of the apps

00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:47.430
that we have created
for this purpose.

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:50.370
So what we are seeing
right now is the raw output

00:07:50.370 --> 00:07:52.260
of the depth camera.

00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:55.050
And as you move around, you can
sort of make out the objects.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:58.020
But what it's basically doing
is that each pixel is not

00:07:58.020 --> 00:08:00.510
a color value,
but rather how far

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:02.460
that particular object
that you're seeing

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.136
is from the camera.

00:08:04.136 --> 00:08:05.760
And we have this
recording mode, where,

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.980
once we start
recording, what it does

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:11.160
is it takes all of these depth
images and it combines them.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.740
So sort of like stitching them
together into the 3D space

00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.030
to create a mesh.

00:08:15.030 --> 00:08:19.432
And you can sort of walk around
and painting the surfaces.

00:08:19.432 --> 00:08:20.890
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's really cool.

00:08:20.890 --> 00:08:21.750
That was very easy.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:25.710
VIVEK: Yeah, it's as easy
as using a regular camera.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.390
And once you stop
the recording, it'll

00:08:27.390 --> 00:08:28.650
do a little bit of processing.

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:32.669
And then what you have is the
3D mesh of the environment

00:08:32.669 --> 00:08:33.757
that you just scanned.

00:08:33.757 --> 00:08:36.090
So you can imagine, if you
spend a little bit more time,

00:08:36.090 --> 00:08:38.760
let's say 10 minutes
or so, comprehensively

00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:40.590
scanning the
environment, then you can

00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:44.087
get much more better models.

00:08:44.087 --> 00:08:46.170
And I'll show you an example
of some of the models

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:48.330
that we have created before.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:50.190
So here's a
two-bedroom apartment

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:52.110
that was scanned in
about 15 to 20 minutes.

00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:54.900
Just walk around using the
same process that we just

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:57.660
did for a few seconds.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:08:58.539
And voila.

00:08:58.539 --> 00:09:00.330
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That
is really cool, Vivek.

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:02.167
VIVEK: Yeah, that's
pretty exciting stuff.

00:09:02.167 --> 00:09:04.000
So let's look at another
model that we scan.

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.810
We can also use this for
scanning outdoor environments.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:11.400
So now, remember that
the depth camera works

00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:13.860
using IR light, infrared light.

00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.200
And since there is a lot
of ambient infrared light

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.774
in bright sunlight, that
would interfere with it.

00:09:18.774 --> 00:09:20.190
But if it's a
cloudy day, then you

00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.130
can reasonably scan
outdoor environments.

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.370
And here is somebody who scanned
the outside of their house.

00:09:26.370 --> 00:09:28.890
And you can see they did a
really good job in scanning it.

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:33.240
And the result is
also quite impressive.

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:38.450
Since this phone is also
a Daydream-ready phone,

00:09:38.450 --> 00:09:40.270
we have this
Daydream button here.

00:09:40.270 --> 00:09:42.660
So once you click on
that, you can pair it

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.750
and put it in one of
these Daydream headsets

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:48.060
and look at these things in VR.

00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:50.205
That's, in a nutshell,
what our app can do.

00:09:50.205 --> 00:09:50.850
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's perfect.

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:51.630
Thank you so much.

00:09:51.630 --> 00:09:53.089
VIVEK: Oh, you're quite welcome.

00:09:53.089 --> 00:09:53.880
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:58.350
So we're going to go check
out some Daydream here.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.050
We're here in the AR
and VR Tent still.

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:03.157
And now we're going
to look at Daydream.

00:10:03.157 --> 00:10:03.990
I'm here with Brian.

00:10:03.990 --> 00:10:05.031
Brian, how are you doing?

00:10:05.031 --> 00:10:06.480
BRIAN: Hey, I'm doing excellent.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:08.104
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
you're going to help

00:10:08.104 --> 00:10:09.280
me experience some Daydream.

00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:09.780
BRIAN: Yeah.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.905
That's absolutely right.

00:10:10.905 --> 00:10:13.719
So Daydream, it's our mobile
virtual reality platform.

00:10:13.719 --> 00:10:16.260
What we're going to be looking
at is virtual virtual reality.

00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.760
It's the experience
that Clay talked

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.890
about during the keynote,
where you go further

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:23.009
and further into VR from inside
VR just like "Inception."

00:10:23.009 --> 00:10:24.300
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.440
I've got to try this.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.399
BRIAN: It's pretty rad.

00:10:26.399 --> 00:10:27.189
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:10:27.189 --> 00:10:29.350
So all I need to do is
put on the headset, right?

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.725
BRIAN: Yup.

00:10:30.725 --> 00:10:33.030
So I'll get you set up here.

00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:37.189
And in just a moment, you'll
be going into VR inside of VR.

00:10:37.189 --> 00:10:37.980
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:39.710
Now, while you're
setting that up,

00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:44.220
Brian's actually going to grab
his phone, and outside the kind

00:10:44.220 --> 00:10:45.630
of headset experience
to give you

00:10:45.630 --> 00:10:47.730
an idea of what it
feels like or what I'm

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.890
experiencing with the headset.

00:10:49.890 --> 00:10:50.670
Sound good?

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.858
All right.

00:10:52.858 --> 00:10:54.810
BRIAN: There you go.

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:57.799
And here's your
Daydream controller.

00:10:57.799 --> 00:10:59.090
SPEAKER 2 (ON SCREEN): Oh, wow.

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:01.982
[CHUCKLES] While I appreciate
your selection, I must insist

00:11:01.982 --> 00:11:03.690
you choose one of the
three test objects.

00:11:06.726 --> 00:11:11.840
Now pick it up and
stick it to me.

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:14.150
[GROAN] Perfectly crunchy.

00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:26.110
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That was really fun.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:27.060
That was really fun.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:28.101
BRIAN: How'd you like it?

00:11:28.101 --> 00:11:31.630
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And
a little strange.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.283
The content of it--
it was strange.

00:11:33.283 --> 00:11:34.658
BRIAN: If you
butter toast in VR,

00:11:34.658 --> 00:11:35.350
you butter toast in real life.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.221
That's how it works.

00:11:36.221 --> 00:11:37.720
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's how it works?

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.777
And all the headset--

00:11:38.777 --> 00:11:40.110
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:42.780
BRIAN: I was just saying if
you butter toast in real life,

00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:44.594
you butter toast in VR.

00:11:44.594 --> 00:11:45.385
It's all confusing.

00:11:45.385 --> 00:11:47.240
Nobody knows what it means.

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.740
It's crazy.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.110
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Well, and the
headsets just kept coming.

00:11:50.110 --> 00:11:52.475
And you went deeper
and deeper into VR.

00:11:52.475 --> 00:11:53.100
BRIAN: Exactly.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:53.770
Yeah.

00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:57.310
The actual experience is
about two to three hours long.

00:11:57.310 --> 00:11:59.320
And you just continue
going further and further

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:00.255
into virtual reality.

00:12:00.255 --> 00:12:01.630
There's a couple
different things

00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:03.838
that are going on here,
where, at the very beginning,

00:12:03.838 --> 00:12:07.180
you choose between a potted
plant, a fish, and a ball.

00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:10.850
And no matter what choice you
make, you're always wrong.

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:12.550
So it's part of that
illusion of choice

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.924
that virtual reality can give
you and a lot of the things

00:12:14.924 --> 00:12:17.440
that the game designers
chose to do to give you

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.619
that illusion of choice.

00:12:18.619 --> 00:12:19.910
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.950
There was a lot of fun, Brian.

00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:21.580
Thank you so much.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.746
BRIAN: Yeah, thanks so much.

00:12:22.746 --> 00:12:26.010
