00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.610
IDO GREEN: Hi, Ido Green
here, a developer advocate

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.320
for Actions on Google.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.990
In my last video link
up here, I showed you

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.060
how to use a flashcard
card template to create

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.950
an app without any code.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.520
Now, I'll show you how to use
one of our other templates,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.370
the Trivia Game template
to create yet another app

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.046
for the Google Assistant.

00:00:24.046 --> 00:00:25.670
In addition to showing
you how to build

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.700
an app with the template, I'll
show you how to test your app

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.170
and submit it for review.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.880
To get started, open
the Action console.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.630
Here, you can see the three
templates to choose from.

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.880
To select the
Trivia Game, simply

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:39.840
click on the Build button.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.920
The next few steps are the same
for all three apps template.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.820
You'll come to this screen
where you can customize your app

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:47.330
by choosing a personality.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.310
Different personalities
have different ways

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.950
to presenting your
prompts and response.

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:54.890
They also have their own
music and sound effects.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.659
Go ahead, click the Play button
to hear the examples of prompts

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:00.200
and choose the
personality that makes

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.070
the most sense for your app.

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.170
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.760
Click Next.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.400
Now, we'll add questions,
answers, hints,

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.560
and follow-ups for
the game, and we'll

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.330
use a Google Sheets for that.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.370
Click on Upload Content
via Google Sheets.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.250
Click on the hyperlink to
create a copy of the template

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.610
we made for you.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.330
You'll get a new browser
tab with this option.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.300
Click on the Make a Copy button.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.220
Now, here's the
creative part where

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.380
you could customize your app.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.110
Make sure to change the
content on both the Questions

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:36.740
and Answers tab and
the Configuration tab.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.190
The blue sections
should not be changed.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.150
Add your questions
and answers here

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.330
and try adding fun
follow-ups that give users

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.730
extra facts about the answer.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.370
If something is missing
or filled out incorrectly,

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.950
you'll get a
warning on the cell.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.810
Once the Questions and
Answers Tab is completed,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.190
click on the Configuration tab.

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.450
You'll need to change the
title and choose the number

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.310
of questions per game.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.880
You could customize your app
with categories difficulty

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.980
and grade level, or
even custom audio

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:10.800
files to build your
own personality.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.620
To configure a custom
option, type the key

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.450
and the value in the
Configuration tab

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.800
of your sheet.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.590
Check out the description
for a link to configuration

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.430
parameters documentation.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.180
You're now done with
the spreadsheet.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.580
Copy the URL at the
top and paste it

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.510
into the previous screen in the
Google Sheet browser URL field.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.710
Click on Connect.

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.630
Once your content is
uploaded successfully,

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.620
click on Create App, which
will close this wizard.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.000
Congrats.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.340
You've just finished
the hard part.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.570
Getting creative with
your questions and answers

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:46.810
and other customization
make a fun,

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.670
engaging experience
for your users

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.250
and give your trivia
game a unique character.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:52.780
Ready to test your app?

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.460
Let's take it for a spin.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.740
Click on the simulator
in the left-side menu

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.630
or on the Test Up button.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.530
Here's what the
simulators look like.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.550
We'll focus on the left side.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.220
The web simulator is a great
tool for testing your app

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.850
and seeing how it is going
to work on Google Assistant.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.550
It's important to test that
everything is working well

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.010
before submitting
your app for review.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.290
As you can see, you
could talk or type

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.810
to test your personality quiz.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.510
By the way, if you logged
in into the Assistant

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.210
with the same account on
your phone or Google Home,

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.800
you could test your
creation there as well.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.890
Once you've tested your
app, you're done building,

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.620
and it's time to move
on to the app preview.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.140
Make sure your app follows
our Content Guidelines

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.140
and Best Practices link
below before submitting it

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.160
to Google for review.

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.300
If your app is approved, it will
be available to all Assistant

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.110
users.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.230
To submit your app for review,
go to the Overview page

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.260
for your project in
the Actions console.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.880
Click on the App
Information section.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.020
Click Add and fill out
the requested information.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:58.610
Most of this
information is public

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.530
and appears in the
Assistant Directory.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.920
When you are done filling
out your app information,

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.330
you will return to the
Assistant app Draft Page.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.060
You could skip the Location
Targeting section, the Surface

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:12.580
Capability section, and
the Account Linking section

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:14.050
by clicking Next.

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.500
Remember, template apps work
on all surfaces supported

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.130
by the Google Assistant.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.480
Click Submit Draft for
review to submit your app.

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.140
That's it.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:24.140
You're done.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.186
Thanks for watching.

00:04:25.186 --> 00:04:26.560
