Given how important getting a location
is to getting good weather information,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.620
this is a lot harder than it should be.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.000
Typing, really?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.970
&gt;&gt; Yeah, it's not good.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.640
I mean, Dan tried to fix it a bit
with the whole validation stuff.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.800
But, I mean,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.570
it's really obvious to me how there are
some ways you could make it even easier.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:18.258
&gt;&gt; Okay, so why don't you go do them?

00:00:18.258 --> 00:00:22.580
&gt;&gt; Okay, calm down.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:23.474
I got this.
