AMIR ELAQUIZY: Cratejoy
is an ecommerce platform

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.120
for building your own
subscription business.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.550
So if you're familiar with
Birchbox or the Dollar Shave

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.020
Club, Cratejoy allows you,
a non-technical person,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.830
to create your own website
where people can sign up, buy

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.290
products on a
subscription basis,

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:22.400
and you can ship it
out and delight them

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.690
every single month.

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:27.920
We are building tools
which other people use

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.350
for their business, which
means it has to work.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:32.670
There's just no exceptions.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.940
And bells and whistles are
cool, but the second one

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.210
of those bells or whistles
detracts from them actually

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.180
making money with their
business, you look really dumb.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.380
So we actually-- although
our merchant portal

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.630
is heavily JavaScripted
and Ajax-y and really cool

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.160
and I like it a lot--
our stores, which

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.284
are what the merchant-- their
business faces the customers,

00:00:52.284 --> 00:00:53.700
those have very
little JavaScript.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.310
We actually stripped out almost
all the dynamic components,

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:58.900
especially from
the checkout flow.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.960
It is possible to make that
stuff very robust and very

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.400
high functioning, but we
needed time to get that done,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:05.980
and we hadn't had that time yet.

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.110
So stripping it all out,
our merchants actually

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.896
significantly improved
their conversion rates,

00:01:10.896 --> 00:01:12.270
their overall
platform happiness.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.200
And now we can slowly introduce
that stuff one at a time.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.570
Make it a little bit easier
to automatically figure out

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.560
their sales tax rates by calling
to the server and Ajaxing it,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.640
or detect when they've
typo'd of their address.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.430
We can add those
things one at a time

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.226
and in a controlled
fashion roll them out.

00:01:27.226 --> 00:01:29.100
And the merchants are
happy because we're not

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.490
degrading the experience at
all So for us, it was actually

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.680
stripping out
functionality and adding it

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.000
back in in a controlled fashion.
