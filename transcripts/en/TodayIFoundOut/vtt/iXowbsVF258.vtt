00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.040
What most people refer to as “tonsils”
are known as Palatine tonsils.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.070
These are the two large protruding tissues
that reside on the sides of the back of your

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.070
throat.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.710
These are actually part of a grouping of lymphoid
tissues (tissue that perform different functions

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.430
for your immune system) known as Waldeyer’s
tonsillar ring.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.080
Waldeyer’s ring creates a rough circular
edge at the opening of our digestive system.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.949
Encompassing both the nasopharynx (the space
where your nose meets the back of your throat)

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.330
and the oropharynx (the back of your throat),
it creates a barrier of sorts.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.870
It’s the first point of contact our immune
system has with the bacteria and microbes

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.969
we ingest or inhale.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.450
While the Palatine tonsils are the largest
part of Waldeyer’s ring, the other parts

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.910
include the pharyngeal tonsil, also known
as the adenoids, Gerlach’s tonsils, which

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:53.739
are at the opening between your nasopharynx
and your middle ear, known as your eustachian

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.640
tubes, and the lingual tonsils which are the
tissues that resides on the base of your tongue.

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.260
Your lymphatic system has many responsibilities
that intertwine with each other.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.000
Its main responsibility is to collect and
transport fluid from all of the inter-cellular

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.260
spaces of the body (known as interstitial
fluid), back to the bloodstream.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.350
It’s also responsible for transporting digested
fats and large molecules like enzymes and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.940
hormones from the places they are created
to the bloodstream.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.250
The other thing the lymphatic system does,
in reference to the tonsils, is create antibodies

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.650
that help in building an immunity to infectious
diseases.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:31.770
They also help filter out smaller bacterias
and toxins.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.160
So to answer your question specifically, the
tonsils’ job, in this web of logistical

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.850
functions, is to create antibodies (immunoglobulins).

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.050
Most active between the ages of 4 and 10,
they have been observed creating a type of

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.870
lymphocyte (a type of white blood cell) known
as a B cell.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.220
There are several different types of theses
cells and they are programmed to make specific

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.220
antibodies.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.330
One type might make an antibody for bacteria
that causes pneumonia, while another might

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.380
make an antibody for the common cold.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.270
Once created by the tonsils, these B cells
will move to the mucus in your upper airway,

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.450
salivary and lacrimal glands.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.269
When it comes in contact with a source that
will trigger it, like pneumonia bacteria,

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.290
it will trigger larger plasma cells to produce
more antibodies.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.739
This evolutionary barrier to bacterial attack
seems exceedingly important to me.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.950
So the question still remains, why did at
one time everyone born within ear-shot of

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.480
a doctor seem to have them removed?

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.480
Why has this approach suddenly become less
common place?

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.480
Short answers: Infections and technological
advances in modern medicine.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.480
Long answer…

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.250
The biggest reason for removing your tonsils
(tonsillectomy) used to be their reoccurring

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:35.250
infection.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.319
This usually occurs between the ages of 4-10
when they are the most active.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.420
By the age of 11, your tonsils will begin
to shrink and the chance of them becoming

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:44.420
infected lessens.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.500
One of the main culprits causing your tonsils
problems is the streptococcus bacterium (strep

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.780
throat), and many people can get numerous
tonsil infections, even several per year.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.270
Before the advent of modern antibiotics, removing
them from the equation was the best available

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.709
treatment for reducing the chance of this
painful chronic condition.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.200
The fact that there were relatively low complication
rates to a tonsillectomy helped make this

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.189
procedure commonplace until recently.

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:16.280
With the introduction of antibiotics, it has
now become easier to treat tonsillitis with

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.840
antibiotics as opposed to surgery.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.790
Dr. Chris Johnson states, “I first trained
and practiced as a pediatric infectious disease

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.760
specialist, and I was consulted many times
about such children (tonsillitis patients).

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.359
My bias was nearly always against tonsillectomy.

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:37.030
My reason, shared by most infectious disease
experts, was that we have effective antibiotics

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.799
to treat strep.

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:41.249
Why risk the surgery?”

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:46.209
In 2002, Tom Marshall published “The Effectiveness
of Tonsillectomies” in the Oxford Journals

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:47.410
“Family Practice”.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.129
In it, he laid out why tonsillectomies are
slowly becoming a thing of the past, when

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:52.840
treating recurrent tonsillitis.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.510
In the only controlled trial that demonstrated
effectiveness of tonsillectomies, only 25%

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.489
of patients who had one performed on them,
met the criteria recommended.

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:03.489
In fact, many studies point out there is insufficient
evidence, in many cases, to justify the risks

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:04.489
of surgery.

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.989
In response to this glaring oversight on many
doctors’ parts, he replied “Perhaps the

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.540
simplest solution to this problem is to tell
patients the truth.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.951
A child who meets these strict criteria will
probably suffer from 6 throat infections in

00:04:14.951 --> 00:04:16.310
the next two years.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:20.510
A child who has surgery now will probably
suffer from 3 throat infections.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.090
In two years, there will probably be no difference.”

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:27.240
I know what you’re thinking.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.270
Why would you want to remove any tissue that
helps fight infection?

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:37.160
The answer is that most people have no increase
in the risk of other body infections when

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.690
the tonsils are removed.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.860
This is why it’s still a common procedure
for afflictions like reoccurring tonsillitis

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:49.300
that does not respond to antibiotics, tonsil
abscesses that do no respond to drainage,

00:04:49.300 --> 00:05:05.380
too large of tonsils that can affect nighttime
breathing, or tumors of

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:09.540
the tonsils.

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.620
Tonsils contain pockets on them.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.290
When we eat or drink bacteria, dead cells,
mucous, and other materials can become trapped

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:16.290
in them.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.190
Over time, these concentrated debris can become
calcified and become what is known as a tonsillolith

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.760
or tonsil stone.

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.780
Ever wonder what those white chunks are at
the back of your throat?

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:27.810
Now you know.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:06:02.640
They’re a bit gross, and they smell awful,
but in most cases aren’t really

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:06.540
a big deal.
