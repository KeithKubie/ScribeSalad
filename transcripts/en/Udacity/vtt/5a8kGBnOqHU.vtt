00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So a useful thing to know about a social network

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
is whether everything is connected to everything else

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
or whether there's some subset of nodes that's isolated

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
from the main body of nodes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
To put it in another way: whether any given pair of nodes in the network

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
can communicate by passing messages

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
from friend to friend, from one place to another.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000
So this graph is actually separated into two different components.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We'll call them A and B,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
where A has three nodes and B has five nodes.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In this case we can do it just by looking at it,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
but sometimes this problem is easier and sometimes it's harder.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So it's good to have an algorithmic approach so that the computer

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
can do it on our behalf.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Just to make sure you understand, here's another graph.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
How many disconnected components are in this graph?

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
If every node can communicate with every other node

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
by passing messages along the green links,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
then you should put one.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
If there's actually two separate groups of nodes within each group,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
they can communicate but between them they can't, then put two.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
If there's three such groups, put three, and so on.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Just write it in the box.
