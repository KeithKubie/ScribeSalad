00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 Hmm

 Hmm 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.310

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.000
 Hmm 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 Hmm 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.990
 me 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.990

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.990

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:27.960
 Fellow 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:39.800
 After all, the place where it will be served at the side is still very very 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.800
 Say I'm happy 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.850
 I'm receiving 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.870
 Good morning 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.870
 Fine

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:05.710
 good for you 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:16.189
 I have a tech festival on the day of September last year, but pepper 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.189
 There is a tech festival and there 7 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:25.070
 There are only 100 in 200 and 100 papers in 200 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:30.450
 In that we can apply for 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:33.480
 But the introduction was about 1000 people, so more people who are very high also had their application 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.690
 See you pepper here 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:41.780
 Do you see 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:46.400
 It was decided to come to me to be very lucky and I received this 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:50.430
 Because it is a big box to let you have a girl 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:54.140
 I was a bit surprised at what this bamboo does 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.140
 It is rainy on tough days 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:03.450
 Just take off the tape and write this along with the dwarf pepper out the pair together 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:08.130
 Turn on the Deco power and take 7 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:13.160
 Put a simple application and start publishing 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.160
 You say something really thin in a new era? 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.180
 Arthur's dull 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.230

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.480
 Let's polish carefully 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:06.450
 It's such a bad feeling to say for the first time 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.160
 Even if I think that I have a feeling at first, I'm still looking at it 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.630
 I will attach 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:16.310
 Rather than saying cute 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:21.880
 For example, at a desk, I don't think if I hit something like this 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.880
 I'm sorry that I want to see pepper but I want to see it 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.490

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.690
 I feel like I feel close to pets 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.730
 Always bread 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.730

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.980
