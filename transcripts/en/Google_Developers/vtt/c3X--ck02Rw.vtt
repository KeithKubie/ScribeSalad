00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.510
Package management.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:02.790
Everyone's talking about it.

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.990
Here's how we do it in Dart.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.600
Of course, package management
is nothing new.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.270
Java has Maven.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.600
RubyGems has Bundler.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.860
Node.js has npm.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.560
And now Dart has Pub, the
package manager for Dart apps.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:22.440
Pub exists today.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.030
You can use it to integrate
third-party libraries into

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.460
your Dart app.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.710
You can find the Pub
scripts in the SDK.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.200
And Pub will even
walk transitive

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.340
dependencies for you.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:35.450
Using Pub is quite simple.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.810
First, import your Dart
libraries with the package

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:40.370
colon prefix.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.440
Second, link those package
names to git repositories

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.630
using the pubspec file.

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.280
Third, install those packages
with Pub Install.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.530
Let's see this in action.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.280
Here we have a simple
app that, of course,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.300
prints kitten pics.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.240
It uses three different
packages,

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.810
catpic, frame and widget.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.130
Notice how the editor
doesn't know

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.880
anything about these packages.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.750
We haven't installed them yet.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.040
The first thing we do is
create a pubspec file.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.030
This will link your package
names to their git

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.120
repositories, in this case,
three different packages to

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.490
three different git
repositories.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.060
Once we have our pubspec file,
we go to the command line, and

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.650
we run Pub install.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.400
This will go out, clone the
the git repositories, and

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.110
create a packages directory
right next to our application.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.220
Now the editor knows
about the packages.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.930
In fact, we can see here
there's four packages.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.030
This is an example of Pub's
transitive dependencies.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.140
For instance, the catpic package
itself has a pubspec.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.690
Looking inside, we can see that

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.700
catpic depends on kittens.

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.930
Now that we have all of our
packages loaded up and our

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.435
editor happy, let's go ahead
and run the application.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.560
Sure enough, your life
is complete.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.490
You have kitten pics
in your app.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.080
And you can see how the cat
pics, the widgets, and the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.810
frames all pulled together
from different libraries

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.872
across the net into one Dart
app, thanks to Pub.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.670
What you saw was just the
beginning of Pub.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.500
Here's what we're
working on next.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.440
First, we're creating a
pub.dartlang.org hosting site.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.960
Here you can publish, discover,
search and install

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.690
third-party libraries
and packages.

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.170
We'll also support the
concept of .tar.gz

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.990
packages for snapshots.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.120
We'll also integrate Pub
into the Dart Editor.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.090
And it'd be really cool to see
if we can help you decide

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.830
which packages to make, if we
integrate with interesting

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.700
metrics like what's the
number of forks or

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.010
watchers for this package.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.080
This is where your feedback
can really help.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.440
Please join the mailing list
at misc@dartlang.org.

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.850
File feature requests and
bugs at dartbug.com.

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.830
And, of course, test your
libraries and apps with Pub.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.050
You just saw Pub, the package
manager for Dart.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.780
It can help you integrate
third-party

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.760
libraries into your app.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.080
Today, you'll install these
packages directly from git.

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.700
But soon, we'll help you search,
publish, install and

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:41.050
discover more third-party
Dart libraries via

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.530
pub.dartlang.org.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.570
Thanks for watching, and
thanks for trying Dart.
