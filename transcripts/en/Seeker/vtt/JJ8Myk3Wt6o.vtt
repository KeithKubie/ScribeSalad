00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.800
Almost 50 years after the last mission to
the moon, there are still questions the expeditions

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:05.880
didn’t answer.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.880
Now though thanks to some archival sleuthing,
one of those mysteries has been solved and

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.160
it turns out the solution is… kinda dumb.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.380
It all started when the Apollo 15 mission
in 1971 and the Apollo 17 mission in 1972

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.170
buried some platinum thermometers in the lunar
surface.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.580
They were planted at different depths, from
a meter to two-and-a-half meters down.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.640
The goal was to see how heat flowed from the
interior of the moon out to the surface, which

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.790
would help scientists learn about the moon’s
interior, like if it had a hot core like the

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:36.640
Earth and the rate of internal geologic activity.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.480
But they found something they didn’t expect:
when astronauts visited the moon they may

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.220
have altered its temperature -- just by being
there.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.579
Although they didn’t figure that out until
recently.

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:46.579
4.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.140
The thermometers reported a gradual uptick
in temperature by one and a half to three

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.079
and a half degrees celsius, and nobody could
pin down exactly why.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:57.460
A few things could be eliminated right away,
like the sun.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.650
Even though temperatures on the moon swing
wildly over a lunar day, the probes were deep

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.690
enough in the lunar soil to avoid the sun’s
effect.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.510
It also couldn’t be the probes’ power
source, as the thermoelectric generators were

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.360
far enough away from the thermometers to rule
them out.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.760
But there were still other possibilities,
like fluctuations in the moon’s orbit, radiation

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.040
from Earth, or maybe some lasting effect from
the astronauts.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.080
We didn’t know because of a bureaucratic
whoopsie.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.000
The thing is, each of these probes beamed
back temperature data for years.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.380
The data were recorded on 7-track magnetic
tapes, which were then analyzed and archived.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.340
But when the experiment ended in 1977, only
tapes up to 1974 had been analyzed and stored

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.530
away.The rest from 1975 to 1977 were lost,
And it wasn’t until 2010 that NASA started

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.340
searching for old mission data from Apollo
and other programs, and lordy were there tapes.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.180
Researchers discovered 440 of them had somehow
wound up at the Washington National Records

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.000
Center, presumably right next to where they
keep the Arc of the Covenant.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.710
440 tapes sounds like a lot, but it’s less
than 10% of the missing data, and what was

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.710
found was badly degraded.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:07.230
In another stroke of luck they found weekly
logs of the probe’s temperatures during

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.590
the missing years at the Lunar and Planetary
Institute in Houston.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.799
So, after eight years of searching and analyzing
they finally had all the pieces of the puzzle.

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:21.020
The new data showed that the probes kept warming
all the way until their demise in 1977, and

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.159
the ones closer to the surface warmed first,
meaning the heat was coming from above and

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.189
slowly penetrating downward.

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:31.059
That made one scenario the most likely fit:
humans did it.

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:35.069
A quick peek at pictures of the landing sites
taken by a probe currently orbiting the moon

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:36.409
revealed how.

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:40.560
Turns out setting up those experiments on
the moon involved a lot of shuffling about.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.209
That kicked up the bright shiny dust on the
moon’s surface, exposing darker soil beneath.

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:49.529
That darker soil absorbed more sunlight, causing
the thermometers to record higher temperatures.

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.650
So after all this time, it was just us.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.959
As soon as we set foot on the moon we were
warming it up.

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.250
Typical humans.

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.939
This also means the act of installing the
instruments muddled the results of the heat

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:01.939
flow experiments.

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:05.209
But knowing where we went wrong will help
us design future missions.

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.670
Maybe we’ll keep this in mind when we’re
kicking up Martian dust one day in the far

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.670
future.

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.670
Thanks for watching, be sure to subscribe.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.340
If you could move to the moon, would you?

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.989
You’d probably have to live in a cave…

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.099
Lunar Real Estate Agent, Trace explains this
crazy plan here.

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:21.139
One last thing: We could take pictures of
the astronauts tracks today because there’s

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.319
no wind or water on the moon to erode them.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.560
Ok I’m out but I’ll see you next time
on Seeker.
