00:00:00.422 --> 00:00:01.973
- [Paige] Hello grammarians, hello David.

00:00:01.973 --> 00:00:03.139
- [David] Hello Paige.

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:05.905
- [Paige] So today we're gonna
talk about Plural Possession.

00:00:05.905 --> 00:00:10.424
Meaning when more than one
person, or thing, or animal,

00:00:10.424 --> 00:00:12.091
owns something else.

00:00:13.258 --> 00:00:16.661
And this, like most other
types of possession,

00:00:16.661 --> 00:00:18.904
tends to involve apostrophes.

00:00:18.904 --> 00:00:20.138
- [David] Makes sense, checks out.

00:00:20.138 --> 00:00:21.857
- [Paige] Yeah, cool.

00:00:21.857 --> 00:00:23.312
- [David] So it's just
apostrophe, S, right?

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:24.991
Like, I mean, why are we
even making this video?

00:00:24.991 --> 00:00:26.008
- [Paige] Well, no.

00:00:26.008 --> 00:00:26.841
- [David] Oh.

00:00:26.841 --> 00:00:28.319
- [Paige] Apostrophe, S,
is a rule that applies when

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.486
the possessive noun is singular.

00:00:30.486 --> 00:00:33.173
So for example, the dog's bone.

00:00:33.173 --> 00:00:35.761
Right, that's one dog's bone.

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:38.301
- [David] One singular
dog possessing one bone.

00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:39.134
- [Paige] Exactly.

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:40.173
- [David] What if I
wanted to talk about like,

00:00:40.173 --> 00:00:42.378
five dogs' bones?

00:00:42.378 --> 00:00:44.865
Like they had a big old pile of bones?

00:00:44.865 --> 00:00:47.225
- [Paige] Right, so that is a case where

00:00:47.225 --> 00:00:48.845
we will not use apostrophe, S.

00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:50.162
- [David] What?

00:00:50.162 --> 00:00:52.066
- [Paige] I'm sorry to disappoint.

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:54.312
- [David] I'm not disappointed,
I'm just surprised.

00:00:54.312 --> 00:00:57.810
Not actually surprised,
that's just a stage trick.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.303
- [Paige] So, if we're
talking about five dogs,

00:01:00.303 --> 00:01:02.176
and their bones,

00:01:02.176 --> 00:01:05.176
we say five dogs, apostrophe, bones,

00:01:06.254 --> 00:01:08.228
and there's no S after the apostrophe.

00:01:08.228 --> 00:01:10.932
- [David] So it goes S, apostrophe?

00:01:10.932 --> 00:01:13.105
So we have the S for the plural,

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:15.251
and then an apostrophe for possession,

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:18.733
but not a second S for possession?

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.080
- [Paige] Right, we don't want like,

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.273
the dogs's bones.

00:01:22.273 --> 00:01:23.995
- [David] Okay.

00:01:23.995 --> 00:01:28.676
Okay, but the apostrophe
at the end isn't about

00:01:28.676 --> 00:01:30.249
there being multiple bones, right?

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:32.146
It's about there being multiple dogs?

00:01:32.146 --> 00:01:35.621
- [Paige] Yeah, so even
if it's multiple dogs,

00:01:35.621 --> 00:01:38.954
and they're possessing a singular thing,

00:01:39.891 --> 00:01:42.298
- [David] So if five dogs
all had the same favorite

00:01:42.298 --> 00:01:43.131
dog park.

00:01:43.131 --> 00:01:45.423
- [Paige] Right, because
it's the best dog park

00:01:45.423 --> 00:01:46.256
in the world.

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:47.872
- [David] Okay.

00:01:47.872 --> 00:01:49.524
- [Paige] So in that case
you would say something like,

00:01:49.524 --> 00:01:51.455
the dogs' favorite park.

00:01:51.455 --> 00:01:54.392
Right, park is still
singular, but dogs' is plural.

00:01:54.392 --> 00:01:58.559
So that's why it's just
apostrophe, and no S afterwards.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.846
- [David] So this also only
applies to plural nouns that

00:02:02.846 --> 00:02:04.898
end in S, right?

00:02:04.898 --> 00:02:08.888
So if I'm talking about one
of our irregular plural nouns,

00:02:08.888 --> 00:02:09.721
like mice,

00:02:11.671 --> 00:02:12.504
or geese,

00:02:13.644 --> 00:02:15.837
or men, or women,

00:02:15.837 --> 00:02:18.054
I would still add apostrophe, S, right?

00:02:18.054 --> 00:02:21.166
Like, okay, so I'm imagining
a department store,

00:02:21.166 --> 00:02:24.407
and there's a men's
section, a women's section,

00:02:24.407 --> 00:02:26.081
and a mice's section.

00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:29.130
- [Paige] (laughs) Okay,
that is an interesting

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.231
department store.

00:02:30.231 --> 00:02:32.069
- [David] Well it doesn't
take up that much floor space

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.118
for the mouse section.

00:02:34.118 --> 00:02:37.362
So, I get that if there's
more than one dog,

00:02:37.362 --> 00:02:39.445
it's D-O-G-S, apostrophe.

00:02:40.286 --> 00:02:44.171
If it's a plural irregular
noun that doesn't end in S,

00:02:44.171 --> 00:02:45.669
then it's still just apostrophe, S,

00:02:45.669 --> 00:02:48.109
like regular possession.

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:50.389
What about family names?

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:52.802
- [Paige] Oh, okay,
that's a good question.

00:02:52.802 --> 00:02:56.597
So, let's say there's a family
with the last name, Harper.

00:02:56.597 --> 00:02:57.880
- [David] Okay.

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.216
- [Paige] And I am going to
visit the Harpers' house.

00:03:02.216 --> 00:03:03.049
- [David] Okay.

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:05.101
- [Paige] Right, so that's
the house that belongs to

00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:08.814
all of the Harpers, the Harper family.

00:03:08.814 --> 00:03:10.612
- [David] Okay, so that seems
pretty straight forward,

00:03:10.612 --> 00:03:14.307
but what if we're talking
about a name that ends in S?

00:03:14.307 --> 00:03:15.564
Like Burns?

00:03:15.564 --> 00:03:16.939
- [Paige] Okay, yeah.

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:19.441
That can make things a
little bit complicated.

00:03:19.441 --> 00:03:21.855
The way that names that
end in S become plural is

00:03:21.855 --> 00:03:24.723
by adding ES to the end of them.

00:03:24.723 --> 00:03:26.806
So Burns becomes Burnses.

00:03:28.202 --> 00:03:30.251
- [David] And so Burnses,
without the apostrophe,

00:03:30.251 --> 00:03:34.702
is how I would refer to that
family unit in total also.

00:03:34.702 --> 00:03:38.202
Right, like it's Mr Burns and the Burnses?

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:41.832
Or Dr Jones and the Joneses?

00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:43.558
- [Paige] Exactly.

00:03:43.558 --> 00:03:44.391
- [David] Okay.

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:46.235
- [Paige] So then when you
wanna make that possessive,

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:48.789
as in, the Burnses' house,

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:52.223
you make it plural by adding that ES,

00:03:52.223 --> 00:03:54.441
and then put the apostrophe after that.

00:03:54.441 --> 00:03:56.373
- [David] Cool, so plural
things that end in S

00:03:56.373 --> 00:04:00.006
don't have a second S
after the apostrophe?

00:04:00.006 --> 00:04:00.839
- [Paige] Yeah.

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:01.830
- [David] But irregular plurals,

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.492
like men, women, mice, do?

00:04:04.492 --> 00:04:05.325
- [Paige] Yeah.

00:04:05.325 --> 00:04:06.158
- [David] Thank you, Paige.

00:04:06.158 --> 00:04:07.512
- [Paige] You're welcome.

00:04:07.512 --> 00:04:08.850
You can learn anything.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.683
- [David] David out.

00:04:09.683 --> 00:04:10.516
- [Paige] Paige out.
