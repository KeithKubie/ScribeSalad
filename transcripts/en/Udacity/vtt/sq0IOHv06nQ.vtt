00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:04.616
Marijuana is classified separately from other drug classes because its effects

00:00:04.616 --> 00:00:09.608
are varied and complex. Cannabinoids are 66 chemicals unique to the cannabis

00:00:09.608 --> 00:00:15.093
plant, which is what marijuana comes from. Delta 9 tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC

00:00:15.093 --> 00:00:19.829
for short, is the most pharmacologically active cannabinoid similar to our

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:26.660
endogenous opiate-like endorphins. We also have an endogenous substance that

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.771
has marijuana like effects called anandamide. The cannabinoids and anandamide

00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:40.110
interact with our CB1e and CB2 receptors. Our CB1 receptors are found in huge

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.900
numbers in the brain, but they're also widespread throughout the body. Our CB2

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.416
receptors are primarily found outside of the brain in immune cells. It's

00:00:54.416 --> 00:00:57.838
important to know where the receptors are found because it can help us

00:00:57.838 --> 00:01:03.289
determine why marijuana can produce the effects that account for medical use.
