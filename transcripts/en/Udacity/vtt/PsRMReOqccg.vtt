00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:01.569
Now I know our work up to this point

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:03.620
with this yogurt data set has been review and it

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.570
should be, but let's hear from Dean about how we

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.000
might proceed differently with this type of a data set.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.650
&gt;&gt; When familiarizing yourself with a new data set that

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.560
contains multiple observations of the same units, it's often useful

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.285
to work with a sample of those units so that

00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:23.969
it's easy to display the raw data for that sample.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.260
In the case of the yogurt data set, we might want to look at a small sample

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.910
of households in more detail so that we know

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.520
what kind of within and between household variation we

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.010
are working with. This analysis of a sub-sample might

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.430
come before trying to use within household variation as

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.520
part of a model. For example, this data set

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.060
was originally used to model consumer preferences for variety.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.190
But, before doing that, we'd want to look at how often we observe households

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.330
buying yogurt, how often they buy multiple items, and what prices they're buying

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:06.822
yogurt at. One way to do this is to look at some sub-sample

00:01:06.822 --> 00:01:11.830
in more detail. Let's pick 16 households at random and take a closer look.
