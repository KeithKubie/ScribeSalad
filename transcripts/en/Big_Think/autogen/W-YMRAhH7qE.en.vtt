prosecutors oh look at this case there's
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.410
prosecutors oh look at this case there's
an obvious basis to do a DNA test and it

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:40.420
an obvious basis to do a DNA test and it
 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.969
an obvious basis to do a DNA test and it
could prove somebody innocent and maybe

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979
could prove somebody innocent and maybe
 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:44.069

anybody resist this right and then even
after the DNA proof came in why would

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170
after the DNA proof came in why would
 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.719

prosecutors still say oh no no no we're

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:03.729

is a question of for cognitive
psychology and

psychology and
 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.780
psychology and
a lot of people thought about it I think

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790
a lot of people thought about it I think
 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:18.390
a lot of people thought about it I think
there's a number of factors the first is

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400
there's a number of factors the first is
 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.490
there's a number of factors the first is
very simple it's human nature people

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500
very simple it's human nature people
 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.290

don't like to admit they're wrong we're
 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.720
don't like to admit they're wrong we're
all like that number two and maybe well

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730
all like that number two and maybe well
 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.490
all like that number two and maybe well
I don't know want to give primacy to any

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500
I don't know want to give primacy to any
 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.430
I don't know want to give primacy to any
of these they're all work together

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440
of these they're all work together
 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.530
of these they're all work together
there's the problem that when somebody's

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540
there's the problem that when somebody's
 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.940
there's the problem that when somebody's
convicted there's a victim or a victim's

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950
convicted there's a victim or a victim's
 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.570

family in the case of a homicide and the

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580
family in the case of a homicide and the
 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.650
family in the case of a homicide and the
prosecutor has said well this defendant

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660
prosecutor has said well this defendant
 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.760
prosecutor has said well this defendant
is a horrible person a beast and animal

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770
is a horrible person a beast and animal
 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.280
is a horrible person a beast and animal
in some instances they would say killed

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290
in some instances they would say killed
 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.290
in some instances they would say killed
this person committed this most heinous

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.300
this person committed this most heinous
 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.720
this person committed this most heinous
of crimes and now you have to go back to

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730
of crimes and now you have to go back to
 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.030
of crimes and now you have to go back to
the victims family and say oh guess what

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040
the victims family and say oh guess what
 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.310
the victims family and say oh guess what
we were wrong well that's very difficult

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320
we were wrong well that's very difficult
 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.830
we were wrong well that's very difficult
for the victim or a family and we see it

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840
for the victim or a family and we see it
 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.780
for the victim or a family and we see it
so often in these sexual assault cases

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790
so often in these sexual assault cases
 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.030
so often in these sexual assault cases
in particular there was eye witness

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040
in particular there was eye witness
 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.580
in particular there was eye witness
misidentification so hard for somebody

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590
misidentification so hard for somebody
 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.250
misidentification so hard for somebody
that's been subject to such a brutal

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260
that's been subject to such a brutal
 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.800
that's been subject to such a brutal
crime to now who made an honest mistake

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810
crime to now who made an honest mistake
 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.979
crime to now who made an honest mistake
and making a misidentification and I say

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989
and making a misidentification and I say
 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:25.170
and making a misidentification and I say
oh my god I was wrong I mean you feel

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180
oh my god I was wrong I mean you feel
 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.690
oh my god I was wrong I mean you feel
doubly triply violated I mean it's a

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700
doubly triply violated I mean it's a
 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.390
doubly triply violated I mean it's a
horrible burden to carry so there's a

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400
horrible burden to carry so there's a
 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.270
horrible burden to carry so there's a
lot of reluctance to upset victims

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:33.280
lot of reluctance to upset victims
 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.340
lot of reluctance to upset victims
within a community so that's a second

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350
within a community so that's a second
 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.840
within a community so that's a second
factor that inhibits prosecutors

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850
factor that inhibits prosecutors
 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.470
factor that inhibits prosecutors
sometimes and police from acknowledging

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480
sometimes and police from acknowledging
 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.750
sometimes and police from acknowledging
a wrongful conviction or even opposing

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760
a wrongful conviction or even opposing
 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.810
a wrongful conviction or even opposing
an effort to get a DNA test and then

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820
an effort to get a DNA test and then
 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.370
an effort to get a DNA test and then
finally and this may be more subtle but

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380
finally and this may be more subtle but
 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.440
finally and this may be more subtle but
I think it's a very very important

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450
I think it's a very very important
 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.440
I think it's a very very important
factor because in a lot of cases we

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450
factor because in a lot of cases we
 

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.780
factor because in a lot of cases we
would find the prosecutor who was

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790
would find the prosecutor who was
 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:00.060
would find the prosecutor who was
standing in the way of the DNA testing

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:00.070
standing in the way of the DNA testing
 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:01.860
standing in the way of the DNA testing
and refusing to acknowledge the obvious

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870
and refusing to acknowledge the obvious
 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.250
and refusing to acknowledge the obvious
implications of the new evidence wasn't

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260
implications of the new evidence wasn't
 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.710
implications of the new evidence wasn't
even in office when the crime was

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720
even in office when the crime was
 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.630
even in office when the crime was
committed and the reason I think that

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640
committed and the reason I think that
 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.370
committed and the reason I think that
some of these prosecutors were so

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380
some of these prosecutors were so
 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.300
some of these prosecutors were so
reluctant to go along with what was I

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310
reluctant to go along with what was I
 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:21.810
reluctant to go along with what was I
think clearly just outcome or even to

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820
think clearly just outcome or even to
 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.680
think clearly just outcome or even to
find out

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690
find out
 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.890
find out
the truth or get better scientific

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900
the truth or get better scientific
 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.930
the truth or get better scientific
evidence that would shed light on the

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940
evidence that would shed light on the
 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.120
evidence that would shed light on the
truth is that they're afraid of the next

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130
truth is that they're afraid of the next
 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.910
truth is that they're afraid of the next
case so if we have an exoneration and an

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:33.920
case so if we have an exoneration and an
 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:36.310
case so if we have an exoneration and an
eyewitness identification case and now

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:36.320
eyewitness identification case and now
 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:38.170
eyewitness identification case and now
I'm trying a new case in front of the

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180
I'm trying a new case in front of the
 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.060
I'm trying a new case in front of the
jury the jury had just heard about this

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070
jury the jury had just heard about this
 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.980
jury the jury had just heard about this
big exoneration and they're always big

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990
big exoneration and they're always big
 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.710
big exoneration and they're always big
news they should be too and they're

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:44.720
news they should be too and they're
 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.820
news they should be too and they're
gonna be thinking ah well maybe I

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:45.830
gonna be thinking ah well maybe I
 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:47.440
gonna be thinking ah well maybe I
shouldn't trust this eyewitness or maybe

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450
shouldn't trust this eyewitness or maybe
 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.570
shouldn't trust this eyewitness or maybe
that case involved police misconduct

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580
that case involved police misconduct
 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.970
that case involved police misconduct
maybe I shouldn't trust the police or it

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:51.980
maybe I shouldn't trust the police or it
 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.800
maybe I shouldn't trust the police or it
was a false confession maybe I shouldn't

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810
was a false confession maybe I shouldn't
 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:58.900
was a false confession maybe I shouldn't
be so sure that a confession means that

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910
be so sure that a confession means that
 

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:01.360
be so sure that a confession means that
somebody is really guilty and on it goes

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370
somebody is really guilty and on it goes
 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.520
somebody is really guilty and on it goes
so I think that they're worried about

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530
so I think that they're worried about
 

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.820
so I think that they're worried about
the next case the truth is that if

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830
the next case the truth is that if
 

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.260
the next case the truth is that if
you're a prosecutor that has a

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270
you're a prosecutor that has a
 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.670
you're a prosecutor that has a
reputation for going back and looking at

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680
reputation for going back and looking at
 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.310
reputation for going back and looking at
old cases and correcting errors I think

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320
old cases and correcting errors I think
 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.900
old cases and correcting errors I think
that your reputation for reliability

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:16.910
that your reputation for reliability
 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.530
that your reputation for reliability
goes up
