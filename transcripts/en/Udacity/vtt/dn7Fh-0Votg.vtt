00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
And the correct answer is n over n - 1.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We can see this just with looking at the single example

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
because of the other options, the only other one that yields 2 is n.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That would imply that the correction factor grows linearly with the amount of data.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So if we have a million data points,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
our variance would need to be somehow multiplied by a million

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
to come up with the actual variance.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
That doesn't correspond well with intuition

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
because, presumably, as we have bigger and bigger samples,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
we should be getting closer to reality,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
although that's not a true proof, but you can prove it to yourself

00:00:40.000 --> 99:59:59.000
by trying this out on some larger sample sizes.
