00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.770
&gt;&gt; So let's look at a concrete example, where

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.579
the hypothesis space is the set of intervals. So the

00:00:05.579 --> 00:00:08.160
inputs that we are trying to learn about are

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.560
just single numbers on the real line. And the hypothesis

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.120
space is this set of functions that return true

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.510
for all the things that are between a and b,

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.270
and this is parameterized by a and b. So

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.920
how many different hypotheses are there in our class here?

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.370
&gt;&gt; At least 2.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.790
&gt;&gt; Sure. How about how many are there in the class?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.750
&gt;&gt; There's an infinite number of them.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.110
&gt;&gt; That's right. So, so this is one of these situations

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.270
where it's going to be really helpful to apply the notion

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.220
of VC dimension if we think we'd like to be able

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.390
to learn from a finite set of data. Which, you know, generally

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.250
we like that. So how do we figure out what the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.530
VC dimension is? We want to know, what is the largest set

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.580
of inputs that we can label in all possible ways, using

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.720
hypotheses from H. Alright, so, I want you to figure that out.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.040
Figure out the, the largest, the size of the

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.730
largest set that we can shatter, that we can label

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.020
in all possible ways using these hypotheses. And then just,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.380
you know, write it as an integer in this box.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.050
&gt;&gt; Cool.
