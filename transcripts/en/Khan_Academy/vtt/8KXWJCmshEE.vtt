00:00:00.571 --> 00:00:02.566
- [Voiceover] All right,
let's see what's going on

00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.133
in this chemical reaction.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.666
On the reactant side,

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:08.433
we have an iron oxide.

00:00:08.433 --> 00:00:10.767
This is ferric oxide right over here,

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.866
reacting with sulfuric acid,

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.501
and it's producing,

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:20.067
this is ferric sulfate and water.

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:22.600
We want to balance this chemical equation.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.900
I encourage you to pause this
video and try to balance this.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.567
I'm assuming you've had a go at it,

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:30.600
and you might have been able
to successfully balance it.

00:00:30.873 --> 00:00:32.166
If you didn't, if you weren't able

00:00:32.166 --> 00:00:33.400
to successfully balance it,

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:37.267
one theory of why you
weren't able to is because

00:00:37.267 --> 00:00:39.700
this sulfate group made
things really confusing.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.300
You have four oxygens, three oxygens here,

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.534
you have seven on this side,

00:00:43.768 --> 00:00:46.200
then you have four oxygens
in the sulfate group here,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.467
but you have three sulfate groups.

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:49.533
This is 12 oxygens here,

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:51.033
and then you have another oxygen here.

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:52.906
This seems really, really,
really, really confusing,

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:55.300
especially with all this
sulfate group business.

00:00:55.767 --> 00:00:58.900
The key here is to appreciate
that the sulfate group

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:00.600
is kind of staying together.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.700
You can kind of treat it ...

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:03.534
Instead of just saying,
"Hey, let's try to balance

00:01:03.534 --> 00:01:04.901
"all of the oxygens," you can say,

00:01:04.901 --> 00:01:07.133
"Let's balance the oxygens

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.300
"that are outside of the
sulfate groups separately,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.733
"and let's balance the
sulfate groups separately."

00:01:12.067 --> 00:01:14.166
To help our brains grapple with that,

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:15.867
I'm going to rewrite
this chemical equation

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:16.933
with a substitution.

00:01:17.267 --> 00:01:18.033
I'm going to say,

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:21.833
let's say that x is equal to a sulfate,

00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:23.466
a sulfate group.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.820
Let me rewrite all of this business.

00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:26.633
I have ...

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.067
It's nice to have, I guess
this is close to a rust color,

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:30.368
which seems appropriate.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.300
Let's say I have some ferric oxide.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.433
I'm just rewriting what I
have above right over here.

00:01:35.433 --> 00:01:39.167
Ferric oxide plus some sulfuric acid.

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.200
But instead of writing H2,

00:01:41.233 --> 00:01:42.667
and then writing the sulfate group,

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:44.533
I'm going to write H2 and then x.

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:49.600
H2 and then x is going to yield ...

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.567
Is going to yield

00:01:52.233 --> 00:01:53.501
ferric sulfate.

00:01:54.067 --> 00:01:56.133
Ferric sulfate has three sulfate groups.

00:01:57.067 --> 00:01:58.833
So x is a sulfate group.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.333
It's going to have three of them.

00:02:00.675 --> 00:02:03.866
Ferric sulfate plus molecular,

00:02:04.366 --> 00:02:06.166
plus molecular water.

00:02:06.633 --> 00:02:08.933
Now, even though x
represents an entire group,

00:02:09.201 --> 00:02:11.333
let's treat it like an
element and just ...

00:02:11.333 --> 00:02:13.433
make sure we have the same number of x's,

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.733
or the same number of
sulfate groups on both sides.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.466
Let's balance this chemical equation.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.133
Let's start with the iron.

00:02:21.501 --> 00:02:23.033
Over here, I have two irons.

00:02:23.933 --> 00:02:26.100
And over here, on the right-hand
side, I have two irons.

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.366
It doesn't seem like I have
to tweak the irons at all.

00:02:28.966 --> 00:02:31.267
Now let's move on to

00:02:32.082 --> 00:02:33.133
the oxygens.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.333
I have three oxygens here,

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:37.366
on the left-hand side.

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:39.066
On the right-hand side,
I only have one oxygen.

00:02:39.071 --> 00:02:40.267
But I can change that by saying,

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:42.869
"Let's have three water molecules."

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:45.300
Then this is going to be

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:47.166
three, right over here.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:49.242
Now let's focus on the hydrogens.

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.401
Focus on the hydrogens, I
have two hydrogens here,

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:56.033
and I have six hydrogens right over here.

00:02:56.667 --> 00:02:59.566
If I have six hydrogens right over there,

00:02:59.966 --> 00:03:01.366
how do I get six hydrogens here?

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:05.701
Well, I'll have three
molecules of sulfuric acid.

00:03:05.701 --> 00:03:07.700
Each of them have two hydrogen atoms.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.366
Now I have six hydrogens.

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:12.433
My hydrogens, my irons, and my oxygens

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:14.933
that are not part of the sulfate group

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:15.966
are all balanced.

00:03:15.966 --> 00:03:16.903
Now let's see

00:03:17.111 --> 00:03:18.366
if we can balance the sulfate groups.

00:03:19.036 --> 00:03:21.400
On the left-hand side, I
have three sulfate groups.

00:03:21.833 --> 00:03:23.333
Let me do that in that magenta color.

00:03:24.468 --> 00:03:26.366
I have three sulfate groups.

00:03:26.468 --> 00:03:29.766
On the right-hand side, I also
have three sulfate groups.

00:03:30.238 --> 00:03:31.700
I'm all balanced.

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:33.866
And if we want to un-substitute,

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.100
we just go back up here.

00:03:35.133 --> 00:03:36.435
Okay, we didn't change the coefficient

00:03:36.435 --> 00:03:39.100
on this molecule, on the ferric oxide.

00:03:39.667 --> 00:03:42.467
We did change the coefficient
on the sulfuric acid.

00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:46.333
We say we have, for every
molecule of ferric oxide,

00:03:46.366 --> 00:03:48.766
we have three molecules of sulfuric acid.

00:03:49.305 --> 00:03:50.200
We didn't change this.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.555
They're going to yield

00:03:51.555 --> 00:03:53.967
one for every one
molecule of ferric oxide,

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:55.867
and three molecules of sulfuric acid.

00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:57.800
It's going to yield,

00:03:58.639 --> 00:03:59.866
the product,

00:04:00.102 --> 00:04:03.000
are going to be one
molecule of ferric sulfate

00:04:03.266 --> 00:04:04.146
and

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.136
three molecules of water.

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:09.939
And we are done.
