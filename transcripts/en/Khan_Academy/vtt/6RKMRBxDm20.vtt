00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.430
Understanding the ethnic
and religious commonalities

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.310
and differences in the
state or the region that

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.277
used to be Yugoslavia
can be quite confusing.

00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:10.860
What I want to do in this video
is try to give a primer on it.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.230
It's really key to understanding
some of the triggers of World

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.990
War I. And to, obviously,
understand the breakup

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.100
of Yugoslavia which was
quite ugly during the fall

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.476
of Communism in the late
'80s and early '90s.

00:00:24.476 --> 00:00:25.850
So first of all,
it's a good idea

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.960
to just understand where the
word Yugoslavia comes from.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.000
It's literally referring to
the southern Slavic states.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.190
So Yugo- is referring
to southern.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.610
And -slavia, we're talking
about the Slavic states.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.624
And when people talk
about Slavic languages,

00:00:40.624 --> 00:00:42.290
they're talking about
the languages that

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.700
are spoken in this region, but
also much of Eastern Europe,

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.070
and in what is now Russia.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.410
Now, what we have
here in blue is,

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.080
we have shaded in
where Serbo-Croatian

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:02.210
is spoken, which is the dominant
Slavic language in this region.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.430
And there are multiple dialects.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.060
Some people will say, oh,
it's Croatian or Montenegrin

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.204
or Serbian or
whatever it might be.

00:01:12.204 --> 00:01:13.870
But mostly, linguists
say, well, they're

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.260
pretty close to each other.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.810
And you can categorize them as
one language as Serbo-Croatian.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.536
And you see that it's now spoken
in modern day Croatia, Bosnia

00:01:24.536 --> 00:01:28.330
and Herzegovina,
Serbia and Montenegro.

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:31.430
And that is the
commonality here,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.710
the thing that ties
together this region.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.490
Now on top of that,
the Slovenian language

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.180
is also Slavic language
that is closely related

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.800
to Serbo-Croatian.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.290
In Macedonia, they also
speak a Slavic language.

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.830
It's closer to Bulgarian.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.320
But it has some close ties.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.950
It's not completely different
than Serbo-Croatian.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.150
So you have this
linguistic connection

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.220
throughout this area.

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.730
Now, what divides this area is
really religion and history.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:01.060
So this area, if you look,
go back hundreds of years,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.640
it was under the control
of various empires,

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.220
the Austro-Hungarian
Empire, the Ottoman Empire.

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.634
Different-- the
Austro-Hungarian Empire,

00:02:08.634 --> 00:02:10.550
you're dealing with the
Roman Catholic Empire.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.880
When you're talking
about the Ottomans,

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.710
you're dealing with
the Muslim Empire.

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.180
And they held in different
parts of this territory

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.570
for hundreds of years.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.510
And so what you end up, is
really a mix of religions.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.220
And that often gets tied to
people's-- what they perceive

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.450
as also their ethnicities.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.110
And so what I have
here is a break down,

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.230
the religious
breakdown of the state,

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.380
the former state of Yugoslavia.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.570
So in this pinkish
color right over here,

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.500
I have the areas that are
predominately Roman Catholic.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.190
And I say, predominantly,
because it really is all mixed

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.690
together.

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.470
So Slovenia, Croatia,
primarily Roman Catholic.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.510
If you look at Serbia
and Montenegro,

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.170
primarily Eastern Orthodox.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:00.950
Kosovo, you have a strong Muslim
majority right over there.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.240
And it really gets-- and
Kosovo, before its break up,

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.520
was kind of part of
Serbia and Montenegro.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.770
Despite it having this very
different religious makeup.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.360
And then, Bosnia
and Herzegovina is

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.740
where things get
really, really mixed up.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.740
Roughly half of the
population, and it's

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.650
been moving over the centuries.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.380
But the dominant
religion there is Islam.

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.630
And in general, and this is
where it can be confusing,

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.420
when people talk
about a Bosniak,

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.250
when they're talking
about a Bosniak,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.080
they're talking about
a Bosnian Muslim.

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.710
But Bosnia and Herzegovina
also has significant fractions

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:44.020
of Serbs who are
Eastern Orthodox.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.840
So that's why I put
the brown here as well.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.410
It's about a third
of the population.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.580
And it also has a pretty sizable
Roman Catholic population.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.025
Or we could say Bosnian Croats.

00:03:53.025 --> 00:03:55.150
So just to be clear here,
it can be very confusing.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.980
Even when you when
you hear history of it

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.490
or when you've heard
it on the news.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:00.340
I remember the '90s
hearing this on the news

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.060
and getting very confused.

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:04.970
If someone's referring to a
Bosnian Muslim or Bosniak,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.780
that's a Muslim
living in Bosnia.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.070
That's they tend
to be referring to.

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:16.709
If they say a
Bosnian Croats, this

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.440
would be an ethnically Croat
who is living in Bosnia.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:24.600
And they are-- it would
tend to be Roman Catholic.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.320
And then if you
have a Bosnian Serb,

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.760
this is someone who ethnically
identifies themselves

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:35.870
as a Serbian or as
a Serb who lives

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:38.330
in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.210
But is probably going
to be Eastern Orthodox.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.070
So you can imagine, you have
the strong linguistic and even

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.160
ethnic ties.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.040
But at some point, because
of the religion and dialect

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.510
changes, there's also
significant amount

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:55.380
of differences here.

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.780
Especially when things
got ugly, as you

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.927
have the fall of Communism.

00:04:58.927 --> 00:05:00.510
So hopefully, this
lays the groundwork

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.030
of the commonalities and
the differences here.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.272
And it'll help us understand
what got us into World War I,

00:05:06.272 --> 00:05:08.480
or at least what triggered
World War I. And also some

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:12.590
of the ugliness that was
seen in the early '90s.

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.100
And just to finish up with
a little bit of context,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.010
this was not a unified
state until-- World War

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.380
I, to some degree, was
precipitated by a desire

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.455
to make this a unified state.

00:05:24.455 --> 00:05:28.600
This ethnic grouping,
this linguistic grouping

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:31.150
tended to be broken up with
the Austro-Hungarian Empire,

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:32.454
the Ottoman Empire.

00:05:32.454 --> 00:05:34.120
Entering into a World
War I, you started

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.850
to have the decline
of the Ottoman Empire

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.170
which started to allow
these people to start

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:43.780
to have more energy behind their
desire to form a unified state.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.850
World War I was
essentially the catalyst

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:49.970
that allowed the state
of Yugoslavia to unify.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:51.850
And in different
forms, it stayed

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:54.600
unified until the
fall of Communism.

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:56.435
And even though it
was a socialist state,

00:05:56.435 --> 00:05:59.320
a communist state
during the Cold War,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:03.030
it actually always had a
strange and distant relationship

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.360
with the Soviet Union.

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.320
But after the fall
of Communism, that

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.170
was kind of holding it
together, these, especially

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.590
these religious
differences, frankly,

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:15.732
and these ethnic and religious
differences broke it apart.
