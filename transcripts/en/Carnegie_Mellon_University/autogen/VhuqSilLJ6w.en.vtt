gains in agricultural productivity have

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219
gains in agricultural productivity have
 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.310
gains in agricultural productivity have
come from using more water and using

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320
come from using more water and using
 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.599

more land we're at a point where we

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609
more land we're at a point where we
 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.939
more land we're at a point where we
don't have those resources anymore the

together take a comprehensive view bring

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380
together take a comprehensive view bring
 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.020

all these technologies together we use

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030
all these technologies together we use
 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.030
all these technologies together we use
robotics for controlling we use

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040
robotics for controlling we use
 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.530
robotics for controlling we use
different types of sensor technologies

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540
different types of sensor technologies
 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:37.790
different types of sensor technologies
for the measurement and often the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800
for the measurement and often the
 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.470
for the measurement and often the
sensors are deployed by the robots and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480
sensors are deployed by the robots and
 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.090
sensors are deployed by the robots and
then we use machine learning for the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100
then we use machine learning for the
 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.180
then we use machine learning for the
analysis we can grow more food with less

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190
analysis we can grow more food with less
 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310
analysis we can grow more food with less
water and less land so one of the things

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320
water and less land so one of the things
 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.920
water and less land so one of the things
we need to do is transfer the kinds of

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930
we need to do is transfer the kinds of
 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.080
we need to do is transfer the kinds of
research we do in the United States to

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
research we do in the United States to
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:52.670

so that they can create better crops

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930
so that they can create better crops
 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.139
so that they can create better crops
that then go to their local growers that

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149
that then go to their local growers that
 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.420
that then go to their local growers that
the growers can grow then using their

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430
the growers can grow then using their
 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.279
the growers can grow then using their
traditional methods however their food

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289
traditional methods however their food
 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.170
