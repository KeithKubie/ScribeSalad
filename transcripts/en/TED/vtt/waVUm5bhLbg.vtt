00:00:12.476 --> 00:00:13.626
Hi.

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:18.071
I've received hate online.

00:00:18.373 --> 00:00:19.539
A lot of it.

00:00:19.563 --> 00:00:22.203
And it comes
with the territory of my work.

00:00:22.227 --> 00:00:23.782
I'm a digital creator,

00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:26.660
I make things specifically
for the internet.

00:00:27.292 --> 00:00:31.087
Like, a few years ago, I made
a video series called "Every Single Word"

00:00:31.111 --> 00:00:33.229
where I edited down popular films

00:00:33.253 --> 00:00:36.101
to only the words
spoken by people of color,

00:00:36.125 --> 00:00:40.469
as a way to empirically and accessibly
talk about the issue of representation

00:00:40.493 --> 00:00:41.643
in Hollywood.

00:00:42.076 --> 00:00:45.482
Then, later, as transphobic bathroom bill

00:00:45.506 --> 00:00:49.045
started gaining media attention
around the United States,

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.689
I hosted and produced an interview series

00:00:51.713 --> 00:00:54.482
called "Sitting in Bathrooms
with Trans People"

00:00:54.506 --> 00:00:56.172
where I did exactly that.

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:57.363
(Laughter)

00:00:57.387 --> 00:00:58.578
And then --

00:00:58.602 --> 00:01:00.069
Sure, I'll take applause.

00:01:00.093 --> 00:01:01.998
(Applause)

00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:03.172
Thank you.

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:07.805
And then, are you familiar
with those unboxing videos on YouTube

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:11.396
where YouTubers open up
the latest electronic gadgets?

00:01:11.797 --> 00:01:14.791
Great, so I satirized those
in a weekly series,

00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:18.268
where instead I unboxed
intangible ideologies

00:01:18.292 --> 00:01:23.718
like police brutality, masculinity
and the mistreatment of Native Americans.

00:01:23.742 --> 00:01:24.992
(Laughter)

00:01:25.016 --> 00:01:26.198
My work --

00:01:26.222 --> 00:01:27.373
Thanks.

00:01:27.397 --> 00:01:29.150
One person applauding, God bless.

00:01:29.174 --> 00:01:31.594
(Laughter)

00:01:31.618 --> 00:01:32.785
Mom, hi.

00:01:33.332 --> 00:01:35.340
(Laughter)

00:01:35.364 --> 00:01:38.156
So, my work became popular.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.332
Very popular.

00:01:39.356 --> 00:01:42.537
I got millions of views,
a ton of great press

00:01:42.561 --> 00:01:44.428
and a slew of new followers.

00:01:44.744 --> 00:01:47.783
But the flip side of success
on the internet

00:01:47.807 --> 00:01:49.370
is internet hate.

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.538
I was called everything.

00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:57.355
From "beta" to "snowflake"
and, of course, the ever-popular "cuck."

00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:00.034
Don't worry, I will break
these terms down for you.

00:02:00.058 --> 00:02:01.228
(Laughter)

00:02:01.252 --> 00:02:03.736
So, "beta," for those of you unfamiliar,

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:07.013
is shorthand online lingo for "beta male."

00:02:07.434 --> 00:02:09.776
But let's be real, I wear pearl earrings

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.085
and my fashion aesthetic
is rich-white-woman-running-errands,

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:15.196
so I'm not angling to be an alpha.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.783
(Applause)

00:02:17.807 --> 00:02:19.141
Doesn't totally work.

00:02:20.128 --> 00:02:21.257
(Laughter)

00:02:21.281 --> 00:02:24.609
Now, "snowflake" is a put-down
for people who are sensitive

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:26.664
and believe themselves to be unique,

00:02:26.688 --> 00:02:30.450
and I'm a millennial
and an only child, so, duh!

00:02:30.474 --> 00:02:32.982
(Laughter)

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:36.741
But my favorite, favorite,
favorite is "cuck."

00:02:37.196 --> 00:02:39.561
It's a slur, short for "cuckold,"

00:02:39.585 --> 00:02:42.315
for men who have been
cheated on by their wives.

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:44.570
But friends, I am so gay,

00:02:44.594 --> 00:02:48.458
that if I had a wife, I would
encourage her to cheat on me.

00:02:48.482 --> 00:02:50.688
(Laughter)

00:02:50.712 --> 00:02:51.862
Thank you.

00:02:52.514 --> 00:02:56.349
Let's take a look at some
of this negativity in action.

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:58.625
Sometimes it's direct.

00:02:58.649 --> 00:03:00.070
Like Marcos, who wrote,

00:03:00.094 --> 00:03:02.390
"You're everything I hate
in a human being."

00:03:02.823 --> 00:03:04.023
Thank you, Marcos.

00:03:04.395 --> 00:03:06.276
Others are more concise.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.795
Like Donovan, who wrote,
"gaywad fagggggg."

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.482
Now, I do need to point out,
Donovan is not wrong, OK?

00:03:14.506 --> 00:03:18.561
In fact, he's right on both counts,
so credit where credit is due.

00:03:18.585 --> 00:03:19.737
Thank you, Donovan.

00:03:19.761 --> 00:03:22.992
Others write to me with questions,
like Brian, who asked,

00:03:23.016 --> 00:03:27.133
"Were you born a bitch or did you
just learn to be one over time?"

00:03:27.157 --> 00:03:29.498
But my favorite thing about this

00:03:29.522 --> 00:03:33.228
is that once Brian was done typing,
his finger must have slipped

00:03:33.252 --> 00:03:36.739
because then he sent me
the thumbs-up emoji.

00:03:36.763 --> 00:03:38.033
(Laughter)

00:03:38.057 --> 00:03:40.560
So, babe, thumbs up to you, too.

00:03:41.176 --> 00:03:43.080
(Laughter)

00:03:43.477 --> 00:03:46.450
It's fun to talk about these messages now.

00:03:46.474 --> 00:03:47.625
Right?

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:50.123
And it's cathartic to laugh at them.

00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:55.413
But I can tell you that it really
does not feel good to receive them.

00:03:56.683 --> 00:03:59.230
At first, I would screenshot
their comments

00:03:59.254 --> 00:04:00.934
and make fun of their typos,

00:04:00.958 --> 00:04:04.972
but this soon felt elitist
and ultimately unhelpful.

00:04:05.427 --> 00:04:09.293
So over time, I developed
an unexpected coping mechanism.

00:04:09.807 --> 00:04:13.022
Because most of these messages I received
were through social media,

00:04:13.046 --> 00:04:16.566
I could often click on the profile picture
of the person who sent them

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.979
and learn everything about them.

00:04:19.003 --> 00:04:20.971
I could see pictures they were tagged in,

00:04:20.995 --> 00:04:23.130
posts they'd written, memes they'd shared,

00:04:23.154 --> 00:04:26.974
and somehow, seeing that it was
a human on the other side of the screen

00:04:26.998 --> 00:04:28.641
made me feel a little better.

00:04:28.665 --> 00:04:31.474
Not to justify what they wrote, right?

00:04:31.498 --> 00:04:33.365
But just to provide context.

00:04:34.538 --> 00:04:37.355
Still, that didn't feel like enough.

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:40.379
So, I called some of them --

00:04:40.403 --> 00:04:42.926
only the ones I felt safe talking to --

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:45.553
with a simple opening question:

00:04:45.577 --> 00:04:47.111
"Why did you write that?"

00:04:47.958 --> 00:04:50.474
The first person I spoke to was Josh.

00:04:50.498 --> 00:04:52.843
He had written to tell me
that I was a moron,

00:04:52.867 --> 00:04:55.331
I was a reason this country
was dividing itself,

00:04:55.355 --> 00:04:59.287
and he added at the end
that being gay was a sin.

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:03.357
I was so nervous
for our first conversation.

00:05:03.381 --> 00:05:05.032
This wasn't a comments section.

00:05:05.056 --> 00:05:08.228
So I couldn't use tools
like muting or blocking.

00:05:08.252 --> 00:05:11.684
Of course, I guess,
I could have hung up on him.

00:05:12.157 --> 00:05:13.704
But I didn't want to.

00:05:13.728 --> 00:05:15.940
Because I liked talking to him.

00:05:15.964 --> 00:05:17.298
Because I liked him.

00:05:18.022 --> 00:05:20.822
Here's a clip of one of our conversations.

00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:23.220
(Audio) Dylan Marron: Josh, you said

00:05:23.244 --> 00:05:25.609
you're about to graduate
high school, right?

00:05:25.633 --> 00:05:26.784
Josh: Mmm-hmm.

00:05:26.808 --> 00:05:28.315
DM: How is high school for you?

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:31.117
Josh: Am I allowed to use
the H-E-double-hockey-stick word?

00:05:31.141 --> 00:05:32.831
DM: Oh, yeah. You're allowed to.

00:05:32.855 --> 00:05:34.196
Josh: It was hell.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.370
DM: Really?

00:05:35.394 --> 00:05:38.886
Josh: And it's still hell right now,
even though it's only two weeks left.

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:41.889
I'm a little bit bigger --
I don't like to use the word "fat,"

00:05:41.913 --> 00:05:44.552
but I am a little bit bigger
than a lot of my classmates

00:05:44.576 --> 00:05:48.514
and they seem to judge me
before they even got to know me.

00:05:48.538 --> 00:05:49.807
DM: That's awful.

00:05:50.173 --> 00:05:52.569
I mean, I also just want
to let you know, Josh,

00:05:52.593 --> 00:05:55.251
I was bullied in high school, too.

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.466
So did our common ground
of being bullied in high school

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.023
erase what he wrote me?

00:06:02.585 --> 00:06:03.752
No.

00:06:03.776 --> 00:06:06.903
And did our single phone conversation

00:06:06.927 --> 00:06:09.808
radically heal a politically
divided country

00:06:09.832 --> 00:06:12.133
and cure systemic injustice?

00:06:12.157 --> 00:06:14.751
No, absolutely not, right?

00:06:15.466 --> 00:06:18.331
But did our conversation
humanize us to each other

00:06:18.355 --> 00:06:21.536
more than profile pictures
and posts ever could?

00:06:21.927 --> 00:06:23.077
Absolutely.

00:06:23.411 --> 00:06:24.957
I didn't stop there.

00:06:24.981 --> 00:06:28.783
Because some of the hate I received
was from "my side."

00:06:29.123 --> 00:06:33.046
So when Matthew,
a queer liberal artist like me

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.826
publicly wrote that I represented
some of the worst aspects of liberalism,

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:39.517
I wanted to ask him this.

00:06:40.483 --> 00:06:42.265
DM: You tagged me in this post.

00:06:42.289 --> 00:06:44.095
Did you want me to see it?

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:46.908
Matthew (Laughing): I honestly
didn't think that you would.

00:06:46.932 --> 00:06:49.453
DM: Have you ever been publicly dragged?

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:51.032
Matthew: I have been.

00:06:51.056 --> 00:06:53.737
And I just said, "No, I don't care."

00:06:53.761 --> 00:06:55.007
DM: And did you not care?

00:06:55.031 --> 00:06:56.253
Matthew: But it was hard.

00:06:56.277 --> 00:06:57.483
DM: Did you not care?

00:06:57.507 --> 00:06:59.240
Matthew: Oh, I cared, yes.

00:07:00.652 --> 00:07:02.462
DM: At the end of these conversations,

00:07:02.486 --> 00:07:04.962
there's often a moment of reflection.

00:07:04.986 --> 00:07:06.256
A reconsideration.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:08.248
And that's exactly what happened

00:07:08.272 --> 00:07:10.418
at the end of my call
with a guy named Doug

00:07:10.442 --> 00:07:14.014
who had written that I was
a talentless propaganda hack.

00:07:14.831 --> 00:07:16.871
(Audio) Did the conversation
we just had --

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:20.244
does it, like, make you feel differently
about how you write online?

00:07:20.268 --> 00:07:22.495
Doug: Yeah! You know,
when I said this to you,

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:24.472
when I said you were a "talentless hack,"

00:07:24.496 --> 00:07:26.833
I had never conversed
with you in my life, really.

00:07:26.857 --> 00:07:29.071
I didn't really know anything
really about you.

00:07:29.095 --> 00:07:30.838
And I think that a lot of times,

00:07:30.862 --> 00:07:32.923
that's what the comment
sections really are,

00:07:32.947 --> 00:07:37.066
it's really a way to get
your anger at the world out

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.518
on random profiles
of strangers, pretty much.

00:07:40.542 --> 00:07:42.042
DM (Laughing): Yeah, right.

00:07:42.966 --> 00:07:45.600
Doug: But it definitely
has made me rethink

00:07:45.624 --> 00:07:49.212
the way that I interact
with people online.

00:07:50.934 --> 00:07:53.791
DM: So I've collected these
conversations and many others

00:07:53.815 --> 00:07:57.363
for my podcast "Conversations
with People Who Hate Me."

00:07:57.387 --> 00:07:58.537
(Laughter)

00:07:59.776 --> 00:08:01.625
Before I started this project,

00:08:01.649 --> 00:08:04.839
I thought that the real way
to bring about change

00:08:04.863 --> 00:08:07.760
was to shut down opposing viewpoints

00:08:07.784 --> 00:08:11.903
through epically worded
video essays and comments and posts,

00:08:11.927 --> 00:08:14.434
but I soon learned
those were only cheered on

00:08:14.458 --> 00:08:17.005
by the people who already agreed with me.

00:08:17.355 --> 00:08:18.791
Sometimes -- bless you.

00:08:18.815 --> 00:08:21.863
Sometimes, the most subversive
thing you could do --

00:08:21.887 --> 00:08:23.228
yeah, clap for him.

00:08:23.252 --> 00:08:25.985
(Laughter)

00:08:27.069 --> 00:08:29.799
Sometimes, the most subversive
thing you could do

00:08:29.823 --> 00:08:33.339
was to actually speak
with the people you disagreed with,

00:08:33.363 --> 00:08:34.896
and not simply at them.

00:08:35.777 --> 00:08:37.252
Now in every one of my calls,

00:08:37.276 --> 00:08:40.936
I always ask my guests
to tell me about themselves.

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.356
And it's their answer to this question
that allows me to empathize with them.

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:47.504
And empathy, it turns out,

00:08:47.528 --> 00:08:51.068
is a key ingredient in getting
these conversations off the ground,

00:08:51.092 --> 00:08:53.433
but it can feel very vulnerable

00:08:53.457 --> 00:08:57.148
to be empathizing with someone
you profoundly disagree with.

00:08:57.839 --> 00:09:00.696
So I established
a helpful mantra for myself.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.672
Empathy is not endorsement.

00:09:04.735 --> 00:09:07.490
Empathizing with someone
you profoundly disagree with

00:09:07.514 --> 00:09:11.141
does not suddenly compromise
your own deeply held beliefs

00:09:11.165 --> 00:09:12.323
and endorse theirs.

00:09:12.347 --> 00:09:16.672
Empathizing with someone who, for example,
believes that being gay is a sin

00:09:16.696 --> 00:09:19.363
doesn't mean that I'm suddenly
going to drop everything,

00:09:19.387 --> 00:09:22.420
pack my bags and grab
my one-way ticket to hell, right?

00:09:22.775 --> 00:09:24.768
It just means that I'm acknowledging

00:09:24.792 --> 00:09:28.686
the humanity of someone who was raised
to think very differently from me.

00:09:29.617 --> 00:09:32.085
I also want to be super clear
about something.

00:09:32.109 --> 00:09:34.776
This is not a prescription for activism.

00:09:35.498 --> 00:09:37.888
I understand that
some people don't feel safe

00:09:37.912 --> 00:09:39.260
talking to their detractors

00:09:39.284 --> 00:09:41.283
and others feel so marginalized

00:09:41.307 --> 00:09:45.129
that they justifiably don't feel
that they have any empathy to give.

00:09:45.153 --> 00:09:46.533
I totally get that.

00:09:46.557 --> 00:09:49.342
This is just what I feel
well-suited to do.

00:09:49.787 --> 00:09:52.770
You know, I've reached out
to a lot of people for this podcast.

00:09:52.794 --> 00:09:54.680
And some have politely declined,

00:09:54.704 --> 00:09:56.712
others have read my message
and ignored it,

00:09:56.736 --> 00:10:00.132
some have blocked me automatically
when I sent the invitation

00:10:00.156 --> 00:10:01.942
and one guy actually agreed to do it

00:10:01.966 --> 00:10:03.728
and then, five minutes into the call,

00:10:03.752 --> 00:10:04.902
hung up on me.

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:09.112
I'm also aware that this talk
will appear on the internet.

00:10:09.556 --> 00:10:11.665
And with the internet comes
comment sections,

00:10:11.689 --> 00:10:14.952
and with comment sections
inevitably comes hate.

00:10:15.358 --> 00:10:17.341
So as you are watching this talk,

00:10:17.365 --> 00:10:19.815
you can feel free to call me
whatever you'd like.

00:10:19.839 --> 00:10:24.903
You can call me a "gaywad,"
a "snowflake," a "cuck," a "beta,"

00:10:24.927 --> 00:10:27.188
or "everything wrong with liberalism."

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:31.080
But just know that if you do,
I may ask you to talk.

00:10:31.717 --> 00:10:35.145
And if you refuse
or block me automatically

00:10:35.169 --> 00:10:37.434
or agree and hang up on me,

00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:40.458
then maybe, babe, the snowflake is you.

00:10:40.778 --> 00:10:41.976
Thank you so much.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.056
(Applause)

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.436
(Cheering)

00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:51.365
(Applause)
