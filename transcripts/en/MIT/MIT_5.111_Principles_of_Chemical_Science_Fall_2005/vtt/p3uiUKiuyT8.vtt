00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.880
Okay.
Great.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.640
Let me just pick up where we
left off on Friday.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.200
And that is we were talking
about some of the physical and

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.840
chemical properties of the
elements as we go across or down

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.303
the Periodic Table.
And one of those properties

00:00:35.303 --> 00:00:39.740
that we were talking about was
the electron affinity,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.153
which I defined for shorthand
just as EA.

00:00:43.153 --> 00:00:45.542
And we saw that,
for example,

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:49.894
if we add an electron to
chlorine to make the anion,

00:00:49.894 --> 00:00:54.501
chlorine minus,
that there is an energy change

00:00:54.501 --> 00:01:00.139
associated with that reaction.
And that energy change was

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:04.089
minus 349 kilojoules.
And what we saw is that the

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.945
electron affinity is defined as
the negative of this energy.

00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:13.306
So the electron affinity,
here, is minus this delta E.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:18.408
So if you have a reaction that
you write with something plus an

00:01:18.408 --> 00:01:23.346
electron to give the anion here,
the change in that energy is

00:01:23.346 --> 00:01:28.119
this, in the case of chlorine,
but the electron affinity is

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.894
defined as minus that.
All right.

00:01:31.894 --> 00:01:36.277
So chlorine we say has an
electron affinity of 349

00:01:36.277 --> 00:01:39.766
kilojoules per mole.
And it is positive.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:44.686
Now, unlike the ionization
energy, the electron affinity

00:01:44.686 --> 00:01:47.191
can be negative.
For example,

00:01:47.191 --> 00:01:52.380
if you take nitrogen and you
try to stick an electron on it

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.031
to make N minus,
delta E for this reaction is

00:01:57.031 --> 00:02:01.643
positive.
When delta E is positive it

00:02:01.643 --> 00:02:04.777
means, of course,
that the anion,

00:02:04.777 --> 00:02:08.694
the product here,
is less stable than the

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:14.569
reactant or the neutral atom.
You cannot put an electron onto

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.409
nitrogen.
It won't stay there.

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:20.836
It will fall apart.
It is not bound.

00:02:20.836 --> 00:02:23.676
And, therefore,
nitrogen here,

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:28.572
the electron affinity of a
nitrogen atom is minus 7

00:02:28.572 --> 00:02:34.058
kilojoules per mole.
So you can have a negative

00:02:34.058 --> 00:02:37.542
electron affinity.
So nitrogen has a negative

00:02:37.542 --> 00:02:41.185
electron affinity.
And you can understand it in

00:02:41.185 --> 00:02:44.748
terms of the electronic
structure of nitrogen.

00:02:44.748 --> 00:02:49.104
If you draw the states of
nitrogen and put the electrons

00:02:49.104 --> 00:02:52.350
in the states here,
here is the electronic

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.834
structure of nitrogen,
just nitrogen neutral.

00:02:55.834 --> 00:03:00.506
But now if you go and you try
to add another electron to the

00:03:00.506 --> 00:03:05.099
nitrogen, it's going to have to
go into one of these filled

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.444
states.
There is a repulsion between

00:03:09.444 --> 00:03:13.722
these two electrons.
That repulsive interaction is

00:03:13.722 --> 00:03:18.436
large enough so that the
attractive interaction between

00:03:18.436 --> 00:03:23.674
the electrons and the nucleus is
not great enough to overcome

00:03:23.674 --> 00:03:29.000
that negative interaction,
that repulsive interaction.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.224
And, therefore,
the electron affinity here is

00:03:32.224 --> 00:03:36.475
negative or, in other words,
this delta E here is positive.

00:03:36.475 --> 00:03:40.286
So you can understand that in
terms of the electronic

00:03:40.286 --> 00:03:42.851
structure.
The other atoms that have

00:03:42.851 --> 00:03:46.368
negative electron affinities are
the inner gases.

00:03:46.368 --> 00:03:49.373
Here is a plot of the electron
affinities.

00:03:49.373 --> 00:03:53.770
Here are all the inner gases.
They all have negative electron

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.021
affinities, because you're
trying to put an electron in the

00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:02.297
next shell.
That's a higher energy state.

00:04:02.297 --> 00:04:06.891
The charge on the nucleus is
not large enough to compensate

00:04:06.891 --> 00:04:10.534
for that extra energy to promote
that electron,

00:04:10.534 --> 00:04:14.336
to put that electron in that
higher energy state.

00:04:14.336 --> 00:04:17.425
All right.
So let's look at what happens

00:04:17.425 --> 00:04:21.702
here as we go across the
Periodic Table to the electron

00:04:21.702 --> 00:04:24.871
affinities.
As you go across the Periodic

00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:29.227
Table, the bottom line is,
in general, that the electron

00:04:29.227 --> 00:04:34.434
affinities increase.
They get larger as you go

00:04:34.434 --> 00:04:39.790
across the Periodic Table.
They get larger because the Z

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.906
on the nucleus is getting
larger.

00:04:42.906 --> 00:04:47.093
The charge on the nucleus is
getting larger.

00:04:47.093 --> 00:04:52.352
When that charge gets larger,
the Coulombic interaction

00:04:52.352 --> 00:04:58.000
between the nucleus and the
electrons is greater.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.229
And if that's greater,
well, then the electron

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.248
affinity here is going to go up.
And it's greater because

00:05:05.248 --> 00:05:09.698
remember, that potential energy
of interaction is minus Z times

00:05:09.698 --> 00:05:14.004
e, the charge on the nucleus
times Z over 4 pi 

00:05:14.004 --> 00:05:17.090
epsilon nought r.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:20.177
If Z is going up,
this interaction Coulombic

00:05:20.177 --> 00:05:23.622
attraction becomes greater.
But at the same time,

00:05:23.622 --> 00:05:28.000
we've got another parameter
here, and that's r.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.121
And r, as you go across the
Periodic Table,

00:05:31.121 --> 00:05:35.135
is remaining essentially
constant because you're in the

00:05:35.135 --> 00:05:38.256
same shell.
So if you're in the same shell,

00:05:38.256 --> 00:05:41.824
r is about constant.
And so the only thing really

00:05:41.824 --> 00:05:44.945
changing is Z.
And so the electron affinity

00:05:44.945 --> 00:05:47.250
goes up.
The same reason why the

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:51.709
ionization energy goes up as we
go across the Periodic Table,

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:54.608
as we talked about last time.
All right.

00:05:54.608 --> 00:05:58.175
But now, in general,
let's look at going down the

00:05:58.175 --> 00:06:02.111
Periodic Table here.
All right.

00:06:02.111 --> 00:06:04.111
Fluorine.
Chlorine.

00:06:04.111 --> 00:06:05.777
Bromine.
Iodine.

00:06:05.777 --> 00:06:11.000
Well, in general,
the electron affinity actually

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.555
goes down.
And the electron affinity there

00:06:15.555 --> 00:06:21.111
goes down because r is,
in general, getting larger.

00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:27.111
You're putting electrons in
shells that are further and

00:06:27.111 --> 00:06:32.403
further away.
Z is also getting larger,

00:06:32.403 --> 00:06:35.576
but not fast enough compared to
r.

00:06:35.576 --> 00:06:39.615
So, in general,
that electron affinity goes

00:06:39.615 --> 00:06:43.076
down.
There are always some glitches,

00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:46.153
but in general that is the
trend.

00:06:46.153 --> 00:06:49.230
Okay.
So then, the other property

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:55.000
that I wanted to talk about is
the atomic radius.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.404
And the atomic radius here is
plotted on the side.

00:07:05.404 --> 00:07:11.801
And let's look at what happens
as we go across the Periodic

00:07:11.801 --> 00:07:14.889
Table here.
Well, in general,

00:07:14.889 --> 00:07:20.955
as we go across the Periodic
Table, the atomic radius is

00:07:20.955 --> 00:07:25.588
going down.
The atomic radius is going down

00:07:25.588 --> 00:07:30.000
because, again,
Z is going up.

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.782
The charge on the nucleus is
getting larger,

00:07:33.782 --> 00:07:38.445
meaning that attractive
interaction is getting larger,

00:07:38.445 --> 00:07:42.756
meaning that those electrons
are pulled in closer.

00:07:42.756 --> 00:07:46.803
Now, as you go across the
Periodic Table again,

00:07:46.803 --> 00:07:50.058
your r is remaining,
roughly speaking,

00:07:50.058 --> 00:07:55.513
the same, in the sense that the
electrons are in the same shell

00:07:55.513 --> 00:08:00.000
with the same principle quantum
number.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.221
So, in general,
that's remaining the same.

00:08:03.221 --> 00:08:07.385
So that's not changing.
It's Z that is changing as you

00:08:07.385 --> 00:08:11.707
go across the Periodic Table.
And that is the dominating

00:08:11.707 --> 00:08:15.792
factor, the change in Z.
The change in Z brings those

00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:18.542
electrons in closer.
And, therefore,

00:08:18.542 --> 00:08:23.100
the radius actually goes down.
And then what about down the

00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.378
Periodic Table,
down a column?

00:08:25.378 --> 00:08:28.992
Well, in this case,
as you go down the Periodic

00:08:28.992 --> 00:08:33.000
Table, again,
Z is also increasing.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.276
But it's r that is changing
faster than Z because you're

00:08:38.276 --> 00:08:42.785
having electrons in shells that,
on the average,

00:08:42.785 --> 00:08:47.007
are a farther distance away
from the nucleus.

00:08:47.007 --> 00:08:52.380
And that is increasing more
rapidly than Z is increasing,

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:56.313
so, therefore,
this radius here is getting

00:08:56.313 --> 00:08:59.000
larger.
All right.

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.837
So those are the three big
trends across the Periodic Table

00:09:04.837 --> 00:09:09.970
that you should know.
Ionization energy and electron

00:09:09.970 --> 00:09:15.204
affinity increase as you go
across, radius decreased.

00:09:15.204 --> 00:09:21.444
Ionization energy and electron
affinity decrease as you go down

00:09:21.444 --> 00:09:27.081
a column, radius increases.
That is something that you do

00:09:27.081 --> 00:09:30.000
need to know.
Okay.

00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.503
Now there is one other concept
or quantity that I want to make

00:09:35.503 --> 00:09:39.654
you familiar with,
and that is something called

00:09:39.654 --> 00:09:42.000
the electronegativity.

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:53.124
And the electronegativity is
really an empirical concept.

00:09:53.124 --> 00:09:57.882
We're going to use the
definition gave by Mulliken in

00:09:57.882 --> 00:10:02.000
1934, as opposed to Pauling's
definition.

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.767
Mulliken's definition is a
little bit more straightforward.

00:10:06.767 --> 00:10:10.958
And the electronegativity is
often just labeled chi,

00:10:10.958 --> 00:10:15.561
and it is given by one-half
times the quantity ionization

00:10:15.561 --> 00:10:20.082
energy plus the electron
affinity.

00:10:20.082 --> 00:10:24.931
That is out electronegativity.
So the electronegativity here

00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:29.534
is kind of some average of the
ionization energy plus the

00:10:29.534 --> 00:10:34.792
electron affinity.
The electronegativity is some

00:10:34.792 --> 00:10:40.666
measure of the tendency of an
atom to accept an electron or to

00:10:40.666 --> 00:10:45.192
donate electrons.
So if the electronegativity of

00:10:45.192 --> 00:10:49.718
an atom is high that's a good
electron acceptor.

00:10:49.718 --> 00:10:54.340
If the electronegativity of an
atom is low, well,

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:59.147
that's a good electron donor.
For example,

00:10:59.147 --> 00:11:04.217
if you look at the Periodic
Table here and you look at

00:11:04.217 --> 00:11:08.713
electronegativities,
the elements that have high

00:11:08.713 --> 00:11:11.965
electronegativities,
high chi here,

00:11:11.965 --> 00:11:15.217
are in the upper right-hand
corner.

00:11:15.217 --> 00:11:20.382
These atoms have large
electronegativities because they

00:11:20.382 --> 00:11:25.930
have high electron affinities
and high ionization energies.

00:11:25.930 --> 00:11:31.000
These atoms are good electron
acceptors.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.270
They're good electron acceptors
because their electron affinity

00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.819
is high.
The change in the energy when

00:11:37.819 --> 00:11:41.745
you add an electron is very
large and negative meaning the

00:11:41.745 --> 00:11:44.983
electron affinity is high.
They're good electron

00:11:44.983 --> 00:11:47.463
acceptors.
They're also good electron

00:11:47.463 --> 00:11:50.838
acceptors because their
ionization energy is high.

00:11:50.838 --> 00:11:54.076
It is difficult.
You have to put a lot of energy

00:11:54.076 --> 00:11:56.693
into the system to remove the
electron.

00:11:56.693 --> 00:12:00.000
They're good electron
acceptors.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.872
On the other hand,
if you look at the elements

00:12:03.872 --> 00:12:09.293
down here in the left-hand lower
corner, these elements have low

00:12:09.293 --> 00:12:10.756
chi.
They have low

00:12:10.756 --> 00:12:14.715
electronegativities.
They are not good electron

00:12:14.715 --> 00:12:18.157
acceptors.
Their electron affinity is low

00:12:18.157 --> 00:12:21.083
and their ionization energy is
low.

00:12:21.083 --> 00:12:25.127
So these elements here are good
electron donors.

00:12:25.127 --> 00:12:31.538
Their ionization energy is low.
You don't have to put in as

00:12:31.538 --> 00:12:37.179
much energy to pull an electron
off as you do for some of the

00:12:37.179 --> 00:12:41.504
other elements.
They have low ionization energy

00:12:41.504 --> 00:12:44.888
and low electron affinity.
All right.

00:12:44.888 --> 00:12:50.341
So you can already suspect that
some of the strongest ionic

00:12:50.341 --> 00:12:55.794
bonds are going to be made
between those elements with high

00:12:55.794 --> 00:13:02.000
electronegativity and those with
low electronegativity.

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.636
Because in an ionic bond,
as we're going to talk about,

00:13:06.636 --> 00:13:10.242
there is this unequal sharing
of electrons.

00:13:10.242 --> 00:13:15.136
So strong ionize bonds are
typically made between elements

00:13:15.136 --> 00:13:18.914
of high electronegativity and
elements of low

00:13:18.914 --> 00:13:21.318
electronegativity.
All right.

00:13:21.318 --> 00:13:26.297
And then finally one other
concept, or one other definition

00:13:26.297 --> 00:13:31.535
that I just wanted to make sure
everybody was on the same page

00:13:31.535 --> 00:13:36.000
with is this term here,
isoelectronic.

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:41.672
Isoelectronic means having the
same electron structure,

00:13:41.672 --> 00:13:45.453
having the same electronic
structure.

00:13:45.453 --> 00:13:51.441
All of these atoms and ions
have the 1s 2 2s 2 2p 6

00:13:51.441 --> 00:13:56.483
electron structure.
So nitrogen here.

00:13:56.483 --> 00:14:01.000
Nitrogen has added three
electrons.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.837
That makes it minus three to
get this electronic structure.

00:14:06.837 --> 00:14:11.870
Aluminum has pulled three
electrons off to get this

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:16.399
electronic structure.
These are isoelectronic.

00:14:16.399 --> 00:14:22.136
And typically the common ions
that are found in nature are

00:14:22.136 --> 00:14:26.967
ions that have this octet,
this inner gas kind of

00:14:26.967 --> 00:14:32.000
structure to it like the neon
structure.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.895
So, for example,
typically you will see a

00:14:34.895 --> 00:14:37.285
nitrogen minus three
ion.

00:14:37.285 --> 00:14:41.122
You won't see nitrogen minus
two because that

00:14:41.122 --> 00:14:44.018
doesn't have the inner gas
configuration.

00:14:44.018 --> 00:14:48.072
You will see oxygen minus two,
but you won't see

00:14:48.072 --> 00:14:52.054
oxygen minus one,
because that doesn't have the

00:14:52.054 --> 00:14:54.515
inner gas configuration.
All right.

00:14:54.515 --> 00:14:58.714
So common ions in nature are
ions that have either added or

00:14:58.714 --> 00:15:04.000
removed electrons to obtain that
inner gas configuration.

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.805
Okay.
So those were a little bit of

00:15:06.805 --> 00:15:10.848
the odds and ends,
that I wanted to just make sure

00:15:10.848 --> 00:15:14.478
that we all understood each
other about them.

00:15:14.478 --> 00:15:19.099
And now what we're going to do
is we're going to move on,

00:15:19.099 --> 00:15:23.306
and we're actually going to
start talking about what

00:15:23.306 --> 00:15:27.514
chemistry is all about.
And that is the formation of

00:15:27.514 --> 00:15:31.659
bonds.
We're going to take these atoms

00:15:31.659 --> 00:15:37.063
now and we're going to put them
together and we're going to make

00:15:37.063 --> 00:15:41.352
some chemical bonds.
So I am going to start to talk

00:15:41.352 --> 00:15:46.843
about this just in terms of what
are the fundamental interactions

00:15:46.843 --> 00:15:50.274
that are taking place in a
chemical bond.

00:15:50.274 --> 00:15:55.078
So that's what I will do for
most of the rest of the hour

00:15:55.078 --> 00:16:00.053
today, is to talk about those
fundamental interactions that

00:16:00.053 --> 00:16:04.000
are common to all chemical
bonds.

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:08.491
And then at the end of the
hour, I'm going to tell you

00:16:08.491 --> 00:16:13.661
about one very simple model for
bonding, which are these Lewis

00:16:13.661 --> 00:16:16.881
diagrams.
And then in the next few days

00:16:16.881 --> 00:16:20.779
we will look at some more
sophisticated models.

00:16:20.779 --> 00:16:25.440
We'll look at molecular orbital
theory and we'll look at

00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:29.000
hybridization.
That is the plan.

00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:34.057
So today, just the elementary
principles behind chemical

00:16:34.057 --> 00:16:38.471
bonds, the elementary
interactions and a start on

00:16:38.471 --> 00:16:41.873
Lewis structures.
Let's take hydrogen.

00:16:41.873 --> 00:16:46.011
That is going to be our
prototypical molecule.

00:16:46.011 --> 00:16:50.425
If we have two hydrogen atoms
that are far apart,

00:16:50.425 --> 00:16:54.011
well, we have the hydrogen
nucleus here,

00:16:54.011 --> 00:16:58.701
which is positive and its
electron, which we'll call

00:16:58.701 --> 00:17:03.494
electron A.
And they're sort of attached.

00:17:03.494 --> 00:17:07.021
And way out here is another
hydrogen atom.

00:17:07.021 --> 00:17:11.150
Here is the nucleus and its
electron, electron B.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:15.881
And so in the separated atom
limit, the interaction that

00:17:15.881 --> 00:17:19.666
we've got is the
electron-nuclear attraction.

00:17:19.666 --> 00:17:24.569
This electron is attracted to
this nucleus and vice versa.

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:29.387
It's that electron-nuclear
attraction that is operable in

00:17:29.387 --> 00:17:35.304
both of these hydrogen atoms.
But now, as these two atoms

00:17:35.304 --> 00:17:39.317
come closer together,
well, this nucleus here is

00:17:39.317 --> 00:17:43.756
bringing its electron along,
and this nucleus here is

00:17:43.756 --> 00:17:47.853
bringing its electron along.
But what happens is,

00:17:47.853 --> 00:17:52.548
as they get closer together,
this electron that was only

00:17:52.548 --> 00:17:56.817
attracted to this nucleus,
nucleus A, now begins to

00:17:56.817 --> 00:18:01.000
experience an attraction to
nucleus B.

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.681
And this electron that was
attached only to nucleus B

00:18:05.681 --> 00:18:10.813
experiences an attractive
interaction here with nucleus A.

00:18:10.813 --> 00:18:15.495
And it is that mutual
attraction of the electrons for

00:18:15.495 --> 00:18:21.257
both nuclei that actually is the
force, the energy of interaction

00:18:21.257 --> 00:18:25.938
that brings the two nuclei
together, and ultimately a

00:18:25.938 --> 00:18:31.351
chemical bond is formed.
However, at the same time that

00:18:31.351 --> 00:18:35.741
you now have this additional
attraction, this attraction,

00:18:35.741 --> 00:18:39.738
say, of electron A not only to
its original nucleus,

00:18:39.738 --> 00:18:43.971
but to the other nucleus,
at the same time as you bring

00:18:43.971 --> 00:18:47.420
those two together,
well, you're bringing the

00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.026
electrons together.
And the electrons have like

00:18:51.026 --> 00:18:54.788
charges and they repel.
So, at the same time now,

00:18:54.788 --> 00:18:58.864
we've got a repulsion,
an electron-electron repulsion

00:18:58.864 --> 00:19:04.386
that is coming into play.
And, at the same time to that,

00:19:04.386 --> 00:19:08.602
we're bringing the two nuclei
together, which are both

00:19:08.602 --> 00:19:12.579
positively charged.
We've got a repulsion coming up

00:19:12.579 --> 00:19:15.443
there also.
And so the formation of a

00:19:15.443 --> 00:19:19.579
chemical bond here is an
interplay between three very

00:19:19.579 --> 00:19:22.840
strong interactions,
this electron-nuclear

00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:26.261
attraction, the
electron-electron repulsion,

00:19:26.261 --> 00:19:30.000
and the nuclear-nuclear
repulsion.

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.638
And so what we want to take a
look at is how those energies

00:19:35.638 --> 00:19:40.111
actually change.
And the components change as a

00:19:40.111 --> 00:19:44.680
function of the distance between
the two nuclei.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:48.666
That's what we are going to
look at today.

00:19:48.666 --> 00:19:53.041
So I am going to take two
hydrogen atoms here,

00:19:53.041 --> 00:19:58.680
H, H, and I am going to plot
the energy of interaction as a

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:05.000
function of the distance between
those two hydrogens.

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.206
So that distance between the
two hydrogen here is r.

00:20:09.206 --> 00:20:12.670
That's the distance between the
two nuclei.

00:20:12.670 --> 00:20:15.639
Now, I've changed my definition
of r.

00:20:15.639 --> 00:20:20.752
Up until now we've been talking
about r as the distance between

00:20:20.752 --> 00:20:25.536
the electron and the nucleus,
but I just changed it in this

00:20:25.536 --> 00:20:31.815
discussion of the chemical bond.
It's the distance between the

00:20:31.815 --> 00:20:34.631
two nuclei.
This is important.

00:20:34.631 --> 00:20:39.194
Now let me plot this energy of
interaction here.

00:20:39.194 --> 00:20:42.883
And I am going to write this as
energy.

00:20:42.883 --> 00:20:46.087
This is the energy of
interaction.

00:20:46.087 --> 00:20:49.873
It's going to be in kilojoules
per mole.

00:20:49.873 --> 00:20:54.145
And I am going to plot it as a
function of r,

00:20:54.145 --> 00:20:59.000
this distance between the two
nuclei.

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:03.737
And what I am going to find,
this is going to be my zero of

00:21:03.737 --> 00:21:08.230
energy here, is that way out
here where the two hydrogen

00:21:08.230 --> 00:21:12.232
atoms are separated,
this energy of interaction is

00:21:12.232 --> 00:21:15.663
going to be minus 2624
kilojoules per mole.

00:21:15.663 --> 00:21:19.175
So this is hydrogen plus
hydrogen,

00:21:19.175 --> 00:21:21.871
hydrogen atoms infinity
separated.

00:21:21.871 --> 00:21:26.037
But now I am going to bring
those two hydrogen atoms

00:21:26.037 --> 00:21:29.059
together.
And what happens is that the

00:21:29.059 --> 00:21:34.835
energy will go down.
The energy of interaction will

00:21:34.835 --> 00:21:39.466
go down; it will keep going down
until some point,

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:42.396
and then it will start going
up.

00:21:42.396 --> 00:21:48.256
And that energy of interaction
will be actually at some value r

00:21:48.256 --> 00:21:53.643
here greater than what it was in
the separated atom limit.

00:21:53.643 --> 00:21:58.935
Now, everywhere where this
energy of interaction is lower

00:21:58.935 --> 00:22:05.930
than the separated atom limit --
Everywhere along these values

00:22:05.930 --> 00:22:11.487
of r we have a chemical bond.
The two hydrogen atoms are

00:22:11.487 --> 00:22:17.449
bound because their energy of
interaction is lower than that

00:22:17.449 --> 00:22:20.986
of the two separated hydrogen
atoms.

00:22:20.986 --> 00:22:25.331
Where it is the lowest,
where that energy of

00:22:25.331 --> 00:22:32.000
interaction is the lowest is the
equilibrium bond length.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:42.028
That's what defines the bond
length, is the value of r at

00:22:42.028 --> 00:22:46.608
which that energy of interaction
here is the lowest,

00:22:46.608 --> 00:22:50.918
is the most negative.
That's the equilibrium bond

00:22:50.918 --> 00:22:54.061
length.
In the case of H two,

00:22:54.061 --> 00:22:59.000
that bond length turns out to
be 0.4 angstroms.

00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.895
Everywhere here,
where that energy of

00:23:02.895 --> 00:23:09.603
interaction is lower than that
of the separated hydrogen atoms,

00:23:09.603 --> 00:23:14.472
from here to here,
we call that the attractive

00:23:14.472 --> 00:23:19.340
region of the potential energy
of interaction.

00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:25.724
We call that the attractive
region, because everywhere here,

00:23:25.724 --> 00:23:32.000
from here to here,
two hydrogen atoms are bound.

00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:37.199
They are lower energy than that
of the separated hydrogen atoms.

00:23:37.199 --> 00:23:41.160
So, in other words,
they are bound if they are at

00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.708
this value of r.
They're bound if they're at

00:23:44.708 --> 00:23:48.339
this value of r.
It's just that they are most

00:23:48.339 --> 00:23:52.053
strongly bound at the
equilibrium bond length.

00:23:52.053 --> 00:23:54.694
So that's how you read the
curve.

00:23:54.694 --> 00:23:56.922
This well here,
if you will,

00:23:56.922 --> 00:24:01.956
we call this sometimes a well,
that's the attractive region of

00:24:01.956 --> 00:24:06.000
this energy of interaction
curve.

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:11.490
Sometimes we call it the
potential energy of interaction.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:16.882
And then another important
definition here is the change

00:24:16.882 --> 00:24:22.176
here from the bottom of this
well to the separated atom

00:24:22.176 --> 00:24:28.156
limit, as you measure it from
the bottom to the separated atom

00:24:28.156 --> 00:24:33.549
limit that energy change I'm
going to call delta E sub d.

00:24:33.549 --> 00:24:38.923
This is the bond association

00:24:38.923 --> 00:24:42.578
energy.
This is how much energy it's

00:24:42.578 --> 00:24:48.425
going to require to dissociate
the H two molecule if it's

00:24:48.425 --> 00:24:53.959
sitting in its equilibrium
position from here to here.

00:24:53.959 --> 00:24:58.554
That turns out to be,
in kilojoules per mole,

00:24:58.554 --> 00:25:04.486
432 kilojoules per mole.
That's the bond association

00:25:04.486 --> 00:25:07.342
energy.
But you also notice here

00:25:07.342 --> 00:25:12.684
something a little peculiar in
the sense that you can bring

00:25:12.684 --> 00:25:17.934
these two hydrogen atoms in.
And, if you bring them in too

00:25:17.934 --> 00:25:21.894
close, that is,
if you start to push them in

00:25:21.894 --> 00:25:25.855
closer than their equilibrium
bond distance,

00:25:25.855 --> 00:25:30.000
the energy of interaction goes
up.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.928
And you can keep pressing them
in.

00:25:32.928 --> 00:25:37.633
And the energy of interaction
will go even further up.

00:25:37.633 --> 00:25:41.627
In other words,
will increase more as you push

00:25:41.627 --> 00:25:46.686
those two hydrogen atoms in.
The energy of interaction can

00:25:46.686 --> 00:25:50.769
get above that of the separated
hydrogen atoms.

00:25:50.769 --> 00:25:55.917
And it's this region of the
potential energy of interaction

00:25:55.917 --> 00:26:00.000
that we call the repulsive
region.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:05.062
It's repulsive because if you
push those two hydrogen atoms

00:26:05.062 --> 00:26:10.124
closer than about this point
right here, those two hydrogen

00:26:10.124 --> 00:26:14.401
won't stick together.
They're even closer than the

00:26:14.401 --> 00:26:19.551
bond length, but they're not
going to stick together because

00:26:19.551 --> 00:26:24.438
their energy of interaction is
greater than the separated

00:26:24.438 --> 00:26:28.192
hydrogen atom limit.
So that is, in general,

00:26:28.192 --> 00:26:33.341
what the energy of interaction
looks like for every chemical

00:26:33.341 --> 00:26:37.767
bond.
But this curve here is really

00:26:37.767 --> 00:26:43.587
given by the competition and the
interplay between these three

00:26:43.587 --> 00:26:48.549
interactions that I started
talking about right here.

00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:53.702
And so I want to try to
decompose this curve into those

00:26:53.702 --> 00:26:58.473
three interactions.
And that is what we're going to

00:26:58.473 --> 00:27:03.114
do now.
We're going to try to explain

00:27:03.114 --> 00:27:08.375
why that curve has the shape
that it actually has.

00:27:08.375 --> 00:27:13.959
I started out saying that this
energy of interaction,

00:27:13.959 --> 00:27:20.187
I will just call it energy of I
here, was really the sum of

00:27:20.187 --> 00:27:25.342
three interactions.
One of those interactions was

00:27:25.342 --> 00:27:32.000
the nuclear-nuclear repulsion
between the two nuclei.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:41.952
That's one.
Another one of those

00:27:41.952 --> 00:27:47.000
interactions was the
electron-nuclear attraction --

00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.975
-- between the electron and
both nuclei, or between both

00:27:58.975 --> 00:28:02.545
electrons and both nuclei.
And then finally,

00:28:02.545 --> 00:28:07.272
the third, is this electron
repulsion between the two

00:28:07.272 --> 00:28:12.727
electrons as we bring the two
hydrogen atoms closer together.

00:28:12.727 --> 00:28:15.727
So those are the three
components.

00:28:15.727 --> 00:28:21.090
Now, what I want to try to do
is I want to try to figure out

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:25.454
an r dependence for each one of
those components.

00:28:25.454 --> 00:28:32.000
I want to see how each one of
those components change with r.

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.746
And then when I add that up,
I should get something that

00:28:37.746 --> 00:28:39.940
looks like that.
Okay?

00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:44.223
All right.
So how are we going to do that?

00:28:44.223 --> 00:28:49.447
Well, first of all,
I am going to realize that with

00:28:49.447 --> 00:28:55.611
a nuclear-nuclear repulsion,
what is that r dependence going

00:28:55.611 --> 00:29:00.000
to look like?
You want to guess?

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.271
Coulomb interaction,
right?

00:29:02.271 --> 00:29:05.765
Coulomb interaction between
like charges.

00:29:05.765 --> 00:29:10.220
That's what that r dependence
is going to look like.

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:13.802
So that's e squared for the
hydrogen atom,

00:29:13.802 --> 00:29:18.606
the charge on the nuclei.
Each hydrogen atom is e over 4

00:29:18.606 --> 00:29:23.324
pi epsilon nought times r.

00:29:23.324 --> 00:29:27.604
In the case of the
nuclear-nuclear repulsion right

00:29:27.604 --> 00:29:32.671
here, I've got a very good
handle on what that r dependence

00:29:32.671 --> 00:29:38.000
for that interaction energy
should look like.

00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:40.461
How come I ran out of board
here?

00:29:40.461 --> 00:29:42.000
Oh, wait a minute.

00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:53.000
All right.
Let me draw that.

00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000
So I have the energy of
interaction here.

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:05.981
And I've got a zero of energy.
And so I'm drawing a 1 over r

00:30:05.981 --> 00:30:10.543
dependence there.
Well, 1 over r looks like it

00:30:10.543 --> 00:30:17.032
starts at infinity and drops off
to zero for very large values of

00:30:17.032 --> 00:30:20.175
r.
So this is my nuclear-nuclear

00:30:20.175 --> 00:30:22.000
repulsion.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.714
That is this dependence right
over here.

00:30:31.714 --> 00:30:36.571
I have one of the components,
but now what about the

00:30:36.571 --> 00:30:42.571
electron-nuclear attraction and
the electron-electron repulsion?

00:30:42.571 --> 00:30:48.285
Well, it turns out that I have
no simple way to predict the r

00:30:48.285 --> 00:30:52.857
dependence for the
electron-nuclear attraction or

00:30:52.857 --> 00:30:58.857
the electron-electron repulsion.
I have no simple way to do that

00:30:58.857 --> 00:31:04.000
without doing a sophisticated
calculation.

00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.606
And, in fact,
I don't even have a simple way

00:31:07.606 --> 00:31:11.464
of doing that if I want to sum
these two terms.

00:31:11.464 --> 00:31:15.825
These two terms are really the
electron interactions.

00:31:15.825 --> 00:31:20.438
These two terms involve the
electron-electron repulsion,

00:31:20.438 --> 00:31:24.799
electron-nuclear attraction.
This one didn't have any

00:31:24.799 --> 00:31:28.574
electrons in it.
So I have no simple way to do

00:31:28.574 --> 00:31:32.771
that.
However, what I can do is that

00:31:32.771 --> 00:31:38.315
I can evaluate the sum of these
two energies at two extremes.

00:31:38.315 --> 00:31:44.043
I can evaluate the sum of these
two energies when r is infinity

00:31:44.043 --> 00:31:48.016
way over here,
and I can evaluate the sum of

00:31:48.016 --> 00:31:52.358
those two terms when r is at
zero way over here.

00:31:52.358 --> 00:31:57.440
So I am going to have two
points, and then I am going to

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:04.000
interpolate between those two
points to get my r dependence.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:11.142
That's what I'm going to do on
my graph over there.

00:32:11.142 --> 00:32:17.857
So let's do that.
I am going to erase this here.

00:32:17.857 --> 00:32:26.714
Let's start by looking at what
that energy of interaction is at

00:32:26.714 --> 00:32:32.435
r equal infinity.
At r equal infinity,

00:32:32.435 --> 00:32:38.280
what is the electron-electron
repulsion equal to?

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:43.881
Zero, because the electrons are
very far apart.

00:32:43.881 --> 00:32:50.944
There is no interaction there.
When r is equal to infinity,

00:32:50.944 --> 00:32:55.693
what is the electron-nuclear
attraction?

00:32:55.693 --> 00:33:00.321
I'm sorry?
What is the electron-nuclear

00:33:00.321 --> 00:33:04.733
attraction?
I'm over here.

00:33:04.733 --> 00:33:09.688
When r is infinity,
what is the energy of

00:33:09.688 --> 00:33:15.013
interaction for the electrons in
the nuclei?

00:33:15.013 --> 00:33:21.454
It's not zero because when the
two hydrogen atoms are

00:33:21.454 --> 00:33:30.000
separated, in each hydrogen atom
the energy of interaction is?

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:40.833
How about the binding energy of
an electron to a nucleus,

00:33:40.833 --> 00:33:44.687
right?
It is the binding energy of the

00:33:44.687 --> 00:33:50.104
electron to the nucleus.
That's the binding energy of

00:33:50.104 --> 00:33:53.437
the electron in the ground
state.

00:33:53.437 --> 00:33:57.812
It's the binding energy of the
1s electron.

00:33:57.812 --> 00:34:03.589
Make sense?
Does this make sense to you?

00:34:03.589 --> 00:34:05.769
No it doesn't.
No.

00:34:05.769 --> 00:34:08.589
Okay.
What's confusing?

00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:13.974
You don't know.
Do you understand what I am

00:34:13.974 --> 00:34:21.794
plotting here as a function of
r, the distance between the two

00:34:21.794 --> 00:34:23.333
nuclei?
Okay.

00:34:23.333 --> 00:34:30.000
When the two nuclei are very
far apart --

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.539
Right over here they're really
far apart.

00:34:33.539 --> 00:34:36.991
There is no electron-electron
repulsion.

00:34:36.991 --> 00:34:41.592
Because each electron is
attached to each nucleus and

00:34:41.592 --> 00:34:47.168
they're too far apart for there
to be any repulsive interaction.

00:34:47.168 --> 00:34:50.000
That makes sense,
right?

00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.002
But when they are far apart
here the electron-nuclear

00:35:02.002 --> 00:35:07.198
attraction, between this
electron and its nucleus here,

00:35:07.198 --> 00:35:11.720
that electron-nuclear
attraction, that energy of

00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:17.011
interaction is the binding
energy of the electron to the

00:35:17.011 --> 00:35:20.763
nucleus.
In the case of the ground state

00:35:20.763 --> 00:35:25.959
hydrogen atom it is the binding
energy of the 1s state.

00:35:25.959 --> 00:35:28.364
Does that make sense?
Yes?

00:35:28.364 --> 00:35:30.625
No?
Good.

00:35:30.625 --> 00:35:37.875
But we've got two hydrogen
atoms so there is a two in front

00:35:37.875 --> 00:35:42.750
of this.
We've got two hydrogen atoms so

00:35:42.750 --> 00:35:50.000
there is a two in front of that.
And now, you know that the

00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:57.125
binding energy of an electron to
a nucleus is -2.18x10^-18

00:35:57.125 --> 00:36:02.367
joules, right?
Yeah, you know that.

00:36:02.367 --> 00:36:09.232
I am going to turn that into
kilojoules per mole instead of

00:36:09.232 --> 00:36:14.085
joules per molecule.
When I turn that into

00:36:14.085 --> 00:36:20.122
kilojoules per mole,
it is 1312 kilojoules per mole.

00:36:20.122 --> 00:36:25.567
If I multiply that by 2,
I am going to get 2624

00:36:25.567 --> 00:36:32.555
kilojoules per mole.
And so way out here at r equals

00:36:32.555 --> 00:36:39.207
infinity I've got one point
minus 2624 kilojoules per mole.

00:36:39.207 --> 00:36:45.860
That is where that number came
from in this original graph.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:50.562
Do you understand that?
This is important,

00:36:50.562 --> 00:36:56.068
because these are the
interactions present in all

00:36:56.068 --> 00:37:01.000
chemical bonds.
So we've got that.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:09.055
Now we're going to estimate
what the sum of these two terms

00:37:09.055 --> 00:37:16.138
are at r equals zero.
At r equals zero we've got the

00:37:16.138 --> 00:37:24.750
electron-nuclear attraction and
we've got the electron-electron

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:31.000
repulsion.
How are we going to do this?

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:35.272
Well, at r equals 0,
what we've got are two hydrogen

00:37:35.272 --> 00:37:40.465
atoms with the nuclei right on
top of each other because that's

00:37:40.465 --> 00:37:44.821
what r equal zero means.
There is no distance between

00:37:44.821 --> 00:37:46.581
the two nuclei,
right?

00:37:46.581 --> 00:37:50.853
So we've got two protons right
on top of each other.

00:37:50.853 --> 00:37:54.790
And, as far as we're going to
be concerned here,

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:59.984
if you've got two protons right
on top of each other that looks

00:37:59.984 --> 00:38:05.407
like a helium nucleus.
If we've got two protons right

00:38:05.407 --> 00:38:10.543
on top of each other at r equals
0, Z is going to be plus 2.

00:38:10.543 --> 00:38:13.191
That is going to look like a

00:38:13.191 --> 00:38:16.722
helium nucleus.
This is a thought experiment.

00:38:16.722 --> 00:38:21.537
We're taking two hydrogen and
we're putting them right on top

00:38:21.537 --> 00:38:24.907
of each other.
So you've got something that

00:38:24.907 --> 00:38:29.000
looks like a helium nucleus,
Z equals 2.

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:35.090
And now, because r is equal to
0, we've got two electrons

00:38:35.090 --> 00:38:41.181
around that helium nucleus.
So all of a sudden what we've

00:38:41.181 --> 00:38:46.728
got here is something that looks
like a helium atom.

00:38:46.728 --> 00:38:52.818
This looks like a helium atom
in this thought experiment.

00:38:52.818 --> 00:38:58.148
How can I estimate the sum,
not these individuals,

00:38:58.148 --> 00:39:05.000
but the sum of these
interactions in the helium atom?

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.349
In the helium atom we have the
electron-nuclear attraction,

00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:13.775
the attraction between this
electron and the helium nucleus,

00:39:13.775 --> 00:39:17.824
this electron and the helium
nucleus, and we've got the

00:39:17.824 --> 00:39:20.599
repulsion between these two
electrons.

00:39:20.599 --> 00:39:26.215
How can I estimate that?
Well, experimentally I can

00:39:26.215 --> 00:39:32.522
estimate that by taking the
first ionization energy,

00:39:32.522 --> 00:39:37.346
making that minus,
plus minus the second

00:39:37.346 --> 00:39:43.406
ionization energy.
That will be my total energy of

00:39:43.406 --> 00:39:49.466
interaction as far as the
electrons are concerned.

00:39:49.466 --> 00:39:58.000
So I go and I look up the first
ionization energy of helium.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:03.514
Remember the first ionization
energy was the energy required

00:40:03.514 --> 00:40:08.186
to pull off the first electron?
I find that number.

00:40:08.186 --> 00:40:12.859
The binding energy is minus
that ionization energy,

00:40:12.859 --> 00:40:16.691
so that's why I put that minus
sign there.

00:40:16.691 --> 00:40:20.429
I do that, and that removes one
electron.

00:40:20.429 --> 00:40:25.757
And now, I want to know how
much is this electron bound to

00:40:25.757 --> 00:40:31.223
the nucleus.
I go up and I look up my second

00:40:31.223 --> 00:40:37.253
ionization energy for helium,
where I solve the Schrödinger

00:40:37.253 --> 00:40:40.581
equation for a one electron
atom.

00:40:40.581 --> 00:40:44.948
I look that up.
That's minus the ionization

00:40:44.948 --> 00:40:48.587
energy.
It turns out that the sum of

00:40:48.587 --> 00:40:53.058
those two is minus 7622
kilojoules per mole.

00:40:53.058 --> 00:40:58.464
Does this make sense?
The electron-nuclear attraction

00:40:58.464 --> 00:41:04.223
plus the repulsion --
I cannot separate those two

00:41:04.223 --> 00:41:08.752
terms, but I know what they are
experimentally as a sum,

00:41:08.752 --> 00:41:13.776
because I go and I measure how
much energy is required to pull

00:41:13.776 --> 00:41:18.058
the first electron off,
add it to the energy required

00:41:18.058 --> 00:41:22.176
to pull the second electron off.
That's totally the

00:41:22.176 --> 00:41:27.447
electron-nuclear attraction plus
the electron-electron repulsion.

00:41:27.447 --> 00:41:33.783
That's what that is.
And I have to make it negative

00:41:33.783 --> 00:41:41.099
because the binding energy,
the energy interaction is minus

00:41:41.099 --> 00:41:47.531
the ionization energy.
So way over here on this plot

00:41:47.531 --> 00:41:52.198
I've got another point for r
equals 0.

00:41:52.198 --> 00:41:58.000
That is minus 7622 kilojoules
per mole.

00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:02.252
And so now what I'm going to do
is I am going to just draw a

00:42:02.252 --> 00:42:06.360
line here between the two.
I just interpolate it because I

00:42:06.360 --> 00:42:10.324
don't know what else to do.
I don't know how to get that

00:42:10.324 --> 00:42:14.504
energy of interaction in a
simple way as a function of r in

00:42:14.504 --> 00:42:17.675
any other way.
But now, what I've got are the

00:42:17.675 --> 00:42:19.765
three components.
Here is one,

00:42:19.765 --> 00:42:23.009
the r dependence.
Here is my approximation for

00:42:23.009 --> 00:42:26.972
the r dependence of the sum of
the other two components.

00:42:26.972 --> 00:42:32.188
I am going to add them up.
Because my total energy of

00:42:32.188 --> 00:42:35.977
interaction I said was the sum
of those three.

00:42:35.977 --> 00:42:40.354
And when I add them up,
well, what I am going to get,

00:42:40.354 --> 00:42:44.563
if I add this curve to that
curve, I'm going to get

00:42:44.563 --> 00:42:49.783
something that looks like that.
This is going to bring it down.

00:42:49.783 --> 00:42:53.823
This goes to infinity,
so this will go high up to

00:42:53.823 --> 00:42:57.443
infinity here.
I am going to get a potential

00:42:57.443 --> 00:43:03.000
energy of interaction that looks
something like that.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.708
The point of all of this was to
illustrate that a chemical bond

00:43:09.708 --> 00:43:15.876
is really a result of the
competition between the electron

00:43:15.876 --> 00:43:20.421
interactions.
The electron interactions are

00:43:20.421 --> 00:43:25.940
this green line here.
It's a competition between the

00:43:25.940 --> 00:43:32.000
electron interactions,
which is always negative.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:38.053
Even though you have an
electron-electron repulsion

00:43:38.053 --> 00:43:44.955
here, which is a repulsive
interaction, the overall energy

00:43:44.955 --> 00:43:50.161
of interaction is negative.
It's attractive.

00:43:50.161 --> 00:43:55.973
The electron interactions
overall are attractive.

00:43:55.973 --> 00:44:01.558
They're negative.
So this chemical bond is a

00:44:01.558 --> 00:44:05.986
competition between the electron
interactions,

00:44:05.986 --> 00:44:10.316
which are attractive,
and the nuclear-nuclear

00:44:10.316 --> 00:44:13.859
repulsion, which is always
repulsive.

00:44:13.859 --> 00:44:18.484
This was always positive.
It's always repulsive.

00:44:18.484 --> 00:44:23.797
And what you can see here is
that there is some optimal

00:44:23.797 --> 00:44:29.702
distance which ends up being the
bond length, where the total

00:44:29.702 --> 00:44:36.000
energy of interaction is a
maximum negative number.

00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:40.761
Where the total energy of
interaction is the greatest.

00:44:40.761 --> 00:44:44.714
In other words,
what you have to do is you're

00:44:44.714 --> 00:44:50.195
going to make a chemical bond.
You have to bring the two atoms

00:44:50.195 --> 00:44:54.777
in close enough so that the
electron attractions are

00:44:54.777 --> 00:44:59.000
present, which bring the two
nuclei in.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.425
But you cannot press them so
close together such that the

00:45:04.425 --> 00:45:10.043
nuclear repulsions take over.
So there is some intermediate

00:45:10.043 --> 00:45:15.371
distance here where you have
enough electron attraction,

00:45:15.371 --> 00:45:20.990
but you don't push them so
close that the nuclear repulsion

00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:25.059
takes over.
And it is that optimal distance

00:45:25.059 --> 00:45:30.000
here that is the equilibrium
bond length.

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:36.617
Now, there is one other very
important point.

00:45:36.617 --> 00:45:45.191
And that is that what we often
do is we shift this zero of

00:45:45.191 --> 00:45:51.357
energy when we talk about a
chemical bond.

00:45:51.357 --> 00:45:59.930
This zero of energy right now
is 2624 kilojoules above the

00:45:59.930 --> 00:46:07.000
energy of the separated hydrogen
atoms.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.616
But we already saw that this
energy of interaction is the

00:46:11.616 --> 00:46:16.562
energy of interaction between
the electron and the nucleus in

00:46:16.562 --> 00:46:19.283
the separated hydrogen atom
limit.

00:46:19.283 --> 00:46:23.982
When we talk about a chemical
bond, we really want to know

00:46:23.982 --> 00:46:28.928
what the energy of interaction
between the two hydrogen atoms

00:46:28.928 --> 00:46:32.761
is.
And so it is useful for us to

00:46:32.761 --> 00:46:38.571
take for us to take this zero of
energy here and just shift it

00:46:38.571 --> 00:46:43.333
down and set it here,
make this the zero of energy.

00:46:43.333 --> 00:46:48.666
Now our zero of energy is when
the two hydrogen atoms are

00:46:48.666 --> 00:46:53.809
separated from each other.
That is just the convention.

00:46:53.809 --> 00:46:59.047
It is often useful to talk
about chemical bonds when you

00:46:59.047 --> 00:47:04.281
set the two atoms --
When they are far apart,

00:47:04.281 --> 00:47:09.223
and you set that energy of
interaction equal to zero.

00:47:09.223 --> 00:47:10.623
See you on Wednesday.
