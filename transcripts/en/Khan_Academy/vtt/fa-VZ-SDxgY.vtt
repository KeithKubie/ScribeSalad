00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.960
I've had enough requests by now
for videos on investing,

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.910
that I thought I would make
some videos on investing.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.280
And the way I'm going to go
about it is, over the next few

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.580
videos, I'm going to give people
the vocabulary of at

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:17.830
least how do you think
about investing?

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.950
And what are the terms and
the ratios people use?

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:22.210
And why do they make sense?

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.540
Or why do they not make sense?

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.680
And when do they apply?

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.950
And when do they not apply?

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:28.260
And then we're going to use
those tools later on, and then

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.060
hopefully we'll look at some
particular companies.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.020
And my goal isn't to do what
they do on CNBC and tell you,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.940
buy, buy, buy, and
sell, sell, sell.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.510
Because frankly that's
not a thoughtful way

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.460
of going about things.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:45.010
What I want to do is really give
you the tools to come to

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.200
the conclusions yourself.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.130
And maybe through the videos,
we'll come to conclusions.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.720
But I don't want to be too
strong about them, because if

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.870
I'm wrong I don't want you
to lose your 401(k).

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.970
So the first thing that I guess
you could say bugs me a

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.680
little bit, is I go to these
family gatherings, and some

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.850
uncle or aunt will come
up to me and says, hey

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.800
I just made a killing.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.710
I bought Citibank.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.590
It's so cheap.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.200
I don't know what it was at the
time, but it's only $1.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:13.600
It's a cheap stock.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.880
As opposed to implicitly there,
there's the assumption

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.340
that a $10 stock would
be expensive.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.760
And I think this is very obvious
to you, but let me

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.550
write that down.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:24.950
So price per share.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.300
So when someone tells me that
a $1 stock is expensive,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.780
they're implicitly saying, well
that's just because it's

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.080
a low number, as opposed
to, say, a $10 stock.

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.330
Let's call this Stock A.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.130
And Stock B.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.940
And I think this is very obvious
to anyone hopefully

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.630
who's spent any time investing,
or thought about

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.230
what a stock even represents.

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:57.290
But you'd be surprised.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:00.860
I've had family members
who are doctors and

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.920
engineers tell me this.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.130
So I thought it's a good
place to start,

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.010
to clarify any confusion.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:11.480
So my question to you is, is
something that is $1, is that

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.870
cheap relative to something
that is $10.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.150
In the everyday world it is.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.010
If I could buy an apple for
$1, that's cheaper than an

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.560
apple that costs $10,
or any good, really.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.380
And the twist here is that
a share is just a share.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.650
It doesn't somehow represent
the entire company.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.650
It's a fraction of
the company.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.290
It's just a share.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.230
And all companies don't have
the same amount of shares.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.810
For example, if I have one
company-- and actually maybe

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.900
that's a good point to introduce
a balance sheet--

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.910
let's say one company whose
assets, because I want to do

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.610
this throughout our
discussion.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:58.440
Whose assets are worth,
let's say, $1 million.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.280
That's its assets.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.380
All its buildings and its
employees and its brand.

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.630
It's worth $1 million.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.030
Let's say it doesn't
have any debt.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.780
And we'll introduce debt later,
because that's another

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.090
variable that a lot of people
don't think about when they

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.800
look at stocks.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.220
They just look purely at the
equity value or the market

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.990
capitalization.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.480
And all these terms we'll
hopefully get very familiar

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.040
with over the course
of these videos.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.690
But let's say its assets
are worth $1 million.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.380
It has no liabilities.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.800
So the asset value
is all in equity.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.860
So this is all equity.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.210
Sometimes called stockholders'
equity.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.830
And the equity is really, the
people who own the company.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.020
what is their stake?

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:44.100
So in this case, they never
borrowed any money to buy

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.080
these assets.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.630
So the owners of the company
own all $1 million, if you

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.560
believe that this is really
worth $1 million.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.260
Now you could have
this scenario.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.560
Let me actually draw the same
scenario over again.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.426
Let me copy and paste this.

00:03:58.426 --> 00:04:01.930
soon.

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.450
So these are two equivalent
companies.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.470
Completely equivalent
companies.

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.960
But this company over here,
they might have decided to

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.600
have 10 shares.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:22.570
So if I were to draw that, 1,
2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.480
I think that's 10 shares.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.360
Well that's my intention.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.840
They have 10 shares.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.610
So what is the value
per share?

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.070
Each share in this case-- once
again, if you believe that the

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:35.930
assets are worth $1 million--
are going to be $1 million.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:40.080
And the equity's $1 million,
because there's no debt, so

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.600
all of the assets are held
by the equity holders.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.255
So each share would be worth
$1 million divided by 10,

00:04:47.255 --> 00:04:49.260
which is equal to $100,000.

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.280
Obviously you never see $100,000
shares out there, or

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:57.380
at least not in the great
majority of examples.

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:59.520
So this is a bit of an
artificial example.

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:02.180
More likely a company might
have a million shares, in

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.560
which case this would
be a $1 stock.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.110
But anyway, this is
a case where they

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.960
only have 10 shares.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:06.720
It's $100,000.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.870
Now let's say this company
right here says, well

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.140
$100,000, that's
kind of a crazy

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.480
number for a share price.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.740
It'll keep a lot of people
from buying our shares.

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:17.960
So let's just divide it
into a million shares.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.220
So they have times one
million shares.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.750
So in this situation, the
company is worth what?

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:28.370
Or the shares are worth what?

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.200
They're worth $1 million divided
by one million shares,

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.280
or $1 per share.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.430
So going back to the idea where
my family member would

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.220
come to me at a party, they
would say oh, look how cheap

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.720
this company is compared
to this company.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:47.450
Even more, let's say for
whatever reason, because not

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:51.650
so many people could afford this
stock, because just to

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:53.050
get in the game, you've
gotta put up

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:54.470
$100,000 to buy a share.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:56.670
Let's say this stock
trades down, and

00:05:56.670 --> 00:06:03.560
it's trading at $50,000.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.290
And their assets
are identical.

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.675
So obviously there's no two
companies that are identical

00:06:08.675 --> 00:06:10.150
in this way, but let's
say that they are.

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.100
Let's say in both cases the
assets of this company are

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.300
worth the exact same thing as
the assets of that company.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.910
So here investors are valuing
this company at $1 times a

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:21.730
million shares.

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.560
They're valuing these assets
at $1 million.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.350
In this case, the investor is
saying, OK, I'm willing to pay

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:30.690
$50,000 per share.

00:06:30.690 --> 00:06:31.940
And there's only 10 shares.

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.720
So they're valuing the
assets at $500,000.

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.330
And this is of course the market
value of the assets.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.570
And we'll talk more about
market versus

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.560
book value of assets.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.180
But the market value or assets
is essentially, what is the

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:46.220
market saying the assets
are worth?

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:49.320
The book value of the assets, or
what the accountants within

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.710
the company are saying
the assets are worth.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.070
And there's a whole methodology
to how one would

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:56.090
account for that.

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:58.600
But this is the market
value of the assets.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:01.340
And I already told you that
these assets are identical.

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.760
They generate the same
earning stream with

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:05.240
the exact same risk.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:09.340
So in this situation, you're
paying $500,000 for the same

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.610
asset that over here you're
paying $1 for.

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:14.570
I don't care what the actual
share price is.

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:16.110
This is what you're
valuing it at.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.260
So the person who says that $1
here is cheap, relative to

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.010
$50,000 here.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:23.850
And they might even say, oh well
they're the same company.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:26.300
And I get it here for $1 a
share, and I get it there for

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.335
$50,000 a share, this
is a cheap company.

00:07:29.335 --> 00:07:32.700
But that's completely
180 degrees in the

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.370
wrong direction wrong.

00:07:34.370 --> 00:07:37.010
Because you're actually paying
more for this company.

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:40.080
You're paying $1 for one
millionth of this company,

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.050
while you're paying $50,000
dollars for one

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:43.190
tenth of this company.

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:46.030
So this one is actually
the better deal.

00:07:46.030 --> 00:07:49.930
So in general, when you're
trying to figure out relative

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:52.900
price of a company-- and we're
going to talk a lot more about

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:55.953
ratios and how do you know if
something is inherently cheap,

00:07:55.953 --> 00:07:58.760
you relative to its earnings or
what it could earn, or its

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.420
growth or anything like that--
but the first cut is, you

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:03.350
can't just look at the price.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.350
The price is almost a
meaningless number.

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:08.330
It matters to some degree
for trading purposes.

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:11.270
Where a lot of institutional
funds won't look at a stock

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.900
that's below $5.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.055
A lot of stocks that go
into the penny stocks.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:22.470
There's a lot of frictions in
investing in penny stocks,

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:25.790
because obviously if you have a
$10 stock, a $10 stock could

00:08:25.790 --> 00:08:29.410
go from $10 to $10.01.

00:08:29.410 --> 00:08:33.130
Or if could go to $9.99.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:37.140
And this is only a 0.1% move.

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:39.789
But let's say you have
a penny stock.

00:08:39.789 --> 00:08:44.410
Let's say you have a stock
that's at $0.05, it can only

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:46.980
move by a penny in
one direction.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:49.690
And before it was actually
an eighth.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.390
So if you move only by a penny
you can only go to $0.06 or

00:08:54.390 --> 00:08:57.010
you could go to $0.04.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:59.670
And so in either direction
you're looking at a 20% move,

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:05.470
while here you're looking at a
1/1000th move or a 0.1% move.

00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:07.250
So that's one reason why
price might matter

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:08.450
a little bit here.

00:09:08.450 --> 00:09:11.740
There's huge frictions if you
were to buy and sell, there's

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.180
20% every time.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.350
And we'll talk about things
like bid-ask spreads and

00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:17.220
liquidity and things like
that in the future.

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:19.250
But that's where the price
really starts to matter.

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.710
And obviously if you have a
really huge price, like

00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:24.850
$100,000, that makes it
difficult for people to buy

00:09:24.850 --> 00:09:26.480
even one share.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.020
But that's the only place
where price matters.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.770
Inherently, when you're talking
about value, you have

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:35.630
to take the price per share and
you multiply it times the

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:36.880
number of shares.

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.760
So these Stock A and Stock B,
these are different than the

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:44.000
ones I drew down here.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.940
So let me draw a little dividing
line right there.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.060
And let me erase some of this.

00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:55.590
So if in this example-- let
me actually erase more.

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.320
So in this example, it's
important to write down the

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.260
number of shares you have. And
you could look this up on

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:13.070
Yahoo Finance.

00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:14.060
And we'll do this in the future

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:14.910
with a bunch of companies.

00:10:14.910 --> 00:10:16.840
We'll just go through the
motions of figuring out all of

00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.660
the metrics.

00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.290
Just because that's a good
starting point just to get a

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:22.100
sense of what the company's
all about.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:27.060
So let's say that this company
has ten million shares.

00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:34.745
And this company right here
has 500,000 shares.

00:10:34.745 --> 00:10:37.940
So what you do is you multiply
these numbers to figure out,

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.480
what is the market value or the
market capitalization of

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:41.950
the company?

00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:44.190
So that's a word.

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:47.320
Let me write that down.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.740
Sometimes called
the market cap.

00:10:49.740 --> 00:10:51.143
Market capitalization.

00:10:58.450 --> 00:11:01.380
And it's essentially, what
is the market saying

00:11:01.380 --> 00:11:03.060
the equity is worth?

00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:07.650
In this case where you don't
have debt, they're actually

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:10.450
saying what is the
asset worth?

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:16.140
So if I took this, $1 per share
times 10 million shares.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.270
The market is saying, this
company's worth $10 million.

00:11:19.270 --> 00:11:22.360
Or that the equity of this
company's worth $10 million.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.470
In this case, they're
saying $10 per share

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:28.330
times 500,000 shares.

00:11:28.330 --> 00:11:31.960
They're saying it's
worth $5 million.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.260
That's the market capitalization
of the company.

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:40.020
That's what the people are
saying the company is worth.

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.610
And actually I'm running
out of time from there.

00:11:42.610 --> 00:11:45.220
So in the next video we'll talk
a little bit about how do

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:47.710
people actually determine
what something is worth?

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:51.250
And that obviously can be an
infinitely deep discussion.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:53.480
But we'll try to get our
feet wet a little bit.

00:11:53.480 --> 00:11:54.730
