when building an app is that we call our

your framework because you're working

you make it right so my point here is

you make it right so my point here is
that background services aren't bad

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140
that background services aren't bad
 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.620
that background services aren't bad
what's bad is when every app has their

what's bad is when every app has their
 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.030
what's bad is when every app has their

we need to coalesce these together so we

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090
we need to coalesce these together so we
 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.280
we need to coalesce these together so we
can create a good experience for the

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:29.990
I'm going to respond to a text message
and the other one probably not okay so

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000
and the other one probably not okay so
 

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.520
and the other one probably not okay so
these three states there we've really

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:32.530
these three states there we've really
 

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:33.570
these three states there we've really
thought a lot of thought into this and

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:33.580
thought a lot of thought into this and
 

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.279
thought a lot of thought into this and
you'll see why as I continue to talk to

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:35.289
you'll see why as I continue to talk to
 

00:08:35.289 --> 00:08:37.620
you'll see why as I continue to talk to
you so let's take a look at this

00:08:37.620 --> 00:08:37.630
you so let's take a look at this
 

00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:38.850
you so let's take a look at this
beautiful image that you probably

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:38.860
beautiful image that you probably
 

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.380
beautiful image that you probably
recognize from our documentation about

00:08:40.380 --> 00:08:40.390
recognize from our documentation about
 

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.209
recognize from our documentation about
doze because you totally read all of our

00:08:42.209 --> 00:08:42.219
doze because you totally read all of our
 

00:08:42.219 --> 00:08:43.649
doze because you totally read all of our
docs and you're really excited about it

00:08:43.649 --> 00:08:43.659
docs and you're really excited about it
 

00:08:43.659 --> 00:08:45.900
docs and you're really excited about it
this is an estimation of like a timeline

00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:45.910
this is an estimation of like a timeline
 

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:48.750
this is an estimation of like a timeline
of how doze works we have this nice long

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:48.760
of how doze works we have this nice long
 

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.310
of how doze works we have this nice long
period over idle right at the end and

00:08:50.310 --> 00:08:50.320
period over idle right at the end and
 

00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.390
period over idle right at the end and
these nice orange bars which represent

00:08:51.390 --> 00:08:51.400
these nice orange bars which represent
 

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.170
these nice orange bars which represent
those main

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:52.180
those main
 

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:54.000
those main
knows that you'll start to understand

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.010
knows that you'll start to understand
 

00:08:54.010 --> 00:08:55.380
knows that you'll start to understand
later on and then we have these crazy

00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:55.390
later on and then we have these crazy
 

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.820
later on and then we have these crazy
spikes at the beginning and all those

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:56.830
spikes at the beginning and all those
 

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:59.130
spikes at the beginning and all those
crazy spikes represent normal usage of

00:08:59.130 --> 00:08:59.140
crazy spikes represent normal usage of
 

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:00.960
crazy spikes represent normal usage of
the device and that's the period when

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:00.970
the device and that's the period when
 

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:02.460
the device and that's the period when
the user is using it and we're trying to

00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:02.470
the user is using it and we're trying to
 

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:04.260
the user is using it and we're trying to
determine if we have reached idle mode

00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:04.270
determine if we have reached idle mode
 

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:05.550
determine if we have reached idle mode
and if we're there yet and like whether

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:05.560
and if we're there yet and like whether
 

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:07.590
and if we're there yet and like whether
how confident we are that we really

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:07.600
how confident we are that we really
 

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.079
how confident we are that we really
should be idle right now so normal usage

00:09:10.079 --> 00:09:10.089
should be idle right now so normal usage
 

00:09:10.089 --> 00:09:12.180
should be idle right now so normal usage
which if it happened all day would join

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:12.190
which if it happened all day would join
 

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:15.480
which if it happened all day would join
the battery and like what hours okay so

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:15.490
the battery and like what hours okay so
 

00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:18.150
the battery and like what hours okay so
the reason we have this nice long period

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:18.160
the reason we have this nice long period
 

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.560
the reason we have this nice long period
of mobile usage even after we might have

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:19.570
of mobile usage even after we might have
 

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:20.910
of mobile usage even after we might have
started thinking about does is because

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:20.920
started thinking about does is because
 

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.710
started thinking about does is because
we want to hit that confidence level and

00:09:22.710 --> 00:09:22.720
we want to hit that confidence level and
 

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.110
we want to hit that confidence level and
to do that we have States so we don't

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:25.120
to do that we have States so we don't
 

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:26.550
to do that we have States so we don't
just jump straight from active to idle

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560
just jump straight from active to idle
 

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.680
just jump straight from active to idle
we walk ourselves into it and we do that

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:28.690
we walk ourselves into it and we do that
 

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:31.290
we walk ourselves into it and we do that
with a device idle controller class so

00:09:31.290 --> 00:09:31.300
with a device idle controller class so
 

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:32.310
with a device idle controller class so
this class was introduced in the

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320
this class was introduced in the
 

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:33.600
this class was introduced in the
marshmallow code it's pretty fantastic

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:33.610
marshmallow code it's pretty fantastic
 

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.910
marshmallow code it's pretty fantastic
and that's part of the AOSP so you can

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920
and that's part of the AOSP so you can
 

00:09:35.920 --> 00:09:37.560
and that's part of the AOSP so you can
read about it and figure out what's

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:37.570
read about it and figure out what's
 

00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:39.240
read about it and figure out what's
going on and understand everything on

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:39.250
going on and understand everything on
 

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:41.310
going on and understand everything on
your own or you can trust me or you can

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:41.320
your own or you can trust me or you can
 

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.600
your own or you can trust me or you can
find someone else who wrote a blog on it

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:42.610
find someone else who wrote a blog on it
 

00:09:42.610 --> 00:09:45.180
find someone else who wrote a blog on it
and read their blog ok so there's

00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:45.190
and read their blog ok so there's
 

00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:46.889
and read their blog ok so there's
several states the first and easiest is

00:09:46.889 --> 00:09:46.899
several states the first and easiest is
 

00:09:46.899 --> 00:09:49.829
several states the first and easiest is
active right because before active then

00:09:49.829 --> 00:09:49.839
active right because before active then
 

00:09:49.839 --> 00:09:50.790
active right because before active then
we know that everything is working

00:09:50.790 --> 00:09:50.800
we know that everything is working
 

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.230
we know that everything is working
properly and like they're using their

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240
properly and like they're using their
 

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.610
properly and like they're using their
device and your app is gonna run exactly

00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:53.620
device and your app is gonna run exactly
 

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:56.100
device and your app is gonna run exactly
as expected and that's just great then

00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:56.110
as expected and that's just great then
 

00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:57.900
as expected and that's just great then
we hit inactive and this is when we've

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:57.910
we hit inactive and this is when we've
 

00:09:57.910 --> 00:10:00.090
we hit inactive and this is when we've
noticed that the screen is off and the

00:10:00.090 --> 00:10:00.100
noticed that the screen is off and the
 

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.160
noticed that the screen is off and the
device isn't moving and all those

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:02.170
device isn't moving and all those
 

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.449
device isn't moving and all those
conditions for those have been met but

00:10:03.449 --> 00:10:03.459
conditions for those have been met but
 

00:10:03.459 --> 00:10:05.280
conditions for those have been met but
like we don't really know why yet we're

00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:05.290
like we don't really know why yet we're
 

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:07.019
like we don't really know why yet we're
just like ok great we're not active

00:10:07.019 --> 00:10:07.029
just like ok great we're not active
 

00:10:07.029 --> 00:10:09.510
just like ok great we're not active
we're just chill with this then comes an

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:09.520
we're just chill with this then comes an
 

00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:11.370
we're just chill with this then comes an
idle pending state which is okay we

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:11.380
idle pending state which is okay we
 

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:12.780
idle pending state which is okay we
weren't active it's been a period of

00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:12.790
weren't active it's been a period of
 

00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:15.180
weren't active it's been a period of
time we're still not active let's one

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:15.190
time we're still not active let's one
 

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:16.380
time we're still not active let's one
real abode of confidence like we're

00:10:16.380 --> 00:10:16.390
real abode of confidence like we're
 

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.000
real abode of confidence like we're
getting close to there and we have to go

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:18.010
getting close to there and we have to go
 

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:19.560
getting close to there and we have to go
through this before we can ever even get

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:19.570
through this before we can ever even get
 

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:21.870
through this before we can ever even get
to our idle state right and the

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:21.880
to our idle state right and the
 

00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:23.100
to our idle state right and the
beautiful thing about this is you can

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:23.110
beautiful thing about this is you can
 

00:10:23.110 --> 00:10:24.900
beautiful thing about this is you can
read the class and the AOSP and you can

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:24.910
read the class and the AOSP and you can
 

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:26.610
read the class and the AOSP and you can
see how we get there and it's really

00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:26.620
see how we get there and it's really
 

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:28.920
see how we get there and it's really
easy because device idle controller has

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:28.930
easy because device idle controller has
 

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:30.780
easy because device idle controller has
an alarm manager that triggers its own

00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:30.790
an alarm manager that triggers its own
 

00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:32.220
an alarm manager that triggers its own
alarm so that it can track its own

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:32.230
alarm so that it can track its own
 

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:34.560
alarm so that it can track its own
progress and so we wait about thirty

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:34.570
progress and so we wait about thirty
 

00:10:34.570 --> 00:10:36.540
progress and so we wait about thirty
minutes between each alarm to see have

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:36.550
minutes between each alarm to see have
 

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:37.949
minutes between each alarm to see have
we gotten out of this like are we good

00:10:37.949 --> 00:10:37.959
we gotten out of this like are we good
 

00:10:37.959 --> 00:10:39.180
we gotten out of this like are we good
like it is something happen are we

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:39.190
like it is something happen are we
 

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:41.280
like it is something happen are we
moving like is there some new foreground

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:41.290
moving like is there some new foreground
 

00:10:41.290 --> 00:10:43.199
moving like is there some new foreground
service like what's going on and then we

00:10:43.199 --> 00:10:43.209
service like what's going on and then we
 

00:10:43.209 --> 00:10:45.480
service like what's going on and then we
use those half-hour periods to see like

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:45.490
use those half-hour periods to see like
 

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:46.620
use those half-hour periods to see like
do we need to back up or do we move

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:46.630
do we need to back up or do we move
 

00:10:46.630 --> 00:10:49.019
do we need to back up or do we move
forward so there's a very long time to

00:10:49.019 --> 00:10:49.029
forward so there's a very long time to
 

00:10:49.029 --> 00:10:50.730
forward so there's a very long time to
be comfortable if the users really not

00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:50.740
be comfortable if the users really not
 

00:10:50.740 --> 00:10:52.470
be comfortable if the users really not
interested before we get to idle and

00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480
interested before we get to idle and
 

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.540
interested before we get to idle and
that way you can trust our comfort level

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:54.550
that way you can trust our comfort level
 

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:56.220
that way you can trust our comfort level
so you can know if they're comfortable

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:56.230
so you can know if they're comfortable
 

00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:57.840
so you can know if they're comfortable
at the users not coming I can be comfort

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:57.850
at the users not coming I can be comfort
 

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:58.829
at the users not coming I can be comfort
all the users not coming and I don't

00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839
all the users not coming and I don't
 

00:10:58.839 --> 00:11:00.360
all the users not coming and I don't
have to panic and think my app is going

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:00.370
have to panic and think my app is going
 

00:11:00.370 --> 00:11:02.130
have to panic and think my app is going
to be ignored because we care about our

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:02.140
to be ignored because we care about our
 

00:11:02.140 --> 00:11:03.840
to be ignored because we care about our
developers even when you're upset with

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:03.850
developers even when you're upset with
 

00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:04.250
developers even when you're upset with
us

00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:04.260
us
 

00:11:04.260 --> 00:11:06.620
us
okay there's also a state called idle

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:06.630
okay there's also a state called idle
 

00:11:06.630 --> 00:11:07.820
okay there's also a state called idle
maintenance and this one's really cool

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:07.830
maintenance and this one's really cool
 

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:09.200
maintenance and this one's really cool
because this is that maintenance window

them anyway so the first is you need to
 

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:50.520
them anyway so the first is you need to
think about your apps architecture you

00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:50.530
think about your apps architecture you
 

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:51.900
think about your apps architecture you
need to understand what it's doing and

00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:51.910
need to understand what it's doing and
 

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:53.430
need to understand what it's doing and
what it's expecting because if you have

00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440
what it's expecting because if you have
 

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:54.900
what it's expecting because if you have
something kind of weird like your server

00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:54.910
something kind of weird like your server
 

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:56.580
something kind of weird like your server
relies on your client to check in every

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:56.590
relies on your client to check in every
 

00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:58.500
relies on your client to check in every
day at 6 p.m. for an update then

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:58.510
day at 6 p.m. for an update then
 

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.180
day at 6 p.m. for an update then
probably that's not going to be great

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:00.190
probably that's not going to be great
 

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:01.650
probably that's not going to be great
because if you miss that because you're

00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:01.660
because if you miss that because you're
 

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:03.630
because if you miss that because you're
in doze mode at 6 p.m. then your servers

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:03.640
in doze mode at 6 p.m. then your servers
 

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:05.790
in doze mode at 6 p.m. then your servers
gonna panic but then again you shouldn't

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:05.800
gonna panic but then again you shouldn't
 

00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:08.040
gonna panic but then again you shouldn't
be doing that anyway so that's on you

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:08.050
be doing that anyway so that's on you
 

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.010
be doing that anyway so that's on you
and you should use downstream messaging

00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:11.020
and you should use downstream messaging
 

00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.780
and you should use downstream messaging
it's just a general best practice that

00:14:12.780 --> 00:14:12.790
it's just a general best practice that
 

00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:13.980
it's just a general best practice that
way your client is always the one

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:13.990
way your client is always the one
 

00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:16.200
way your client is always the one
reacting instead of in the server but if

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:16.210
reacting instead of in the server but if
 

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:17.700
reacting instead of in the server but if
you're using downstream messaging and

00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:17.710
you're using downstream messaging and
 

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:19.020
you're using downstream messaging and
specifically Google Cloud messaging

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:19.030
specifically Google Cloud messaging
 

00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:21.510
specifically Google Cloud messaging
which you should be using anyway and I

00:14:21.510 --> 00:14:21.520
which you should be using anyway and I
 

00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:22.710
which you should be using anyway and I
can tell you about that later then you

00:14:22.710 --> 00:14:22.720
can tell you about that later then you
 

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:25.500
can tell you about that later then you
can add a high priority tag and this is

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:25.510
can add a high priority tag and this is
 

00:14:25.510 --> 00:14:26.790
can add a high priority tag and this is
great because anything with a high

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800
great because anything with a high
 

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:28.680
great because anything with a high
priority the system will receive and

00:14:28.680 --> 00:14:28.690
priority the system will receive and
 

00:14:28.690 --> 00:14:30.540
priority the system will receive and
then they'll be able to say okay great

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:30.550
then they'll be able to say okay great
 

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:32.070
then they'll be able to say okay great
temporary wake up for the app they can

00:14:32.070 --> 00:14:32.080
temporary wake up for the app they can
 

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:33.660
temporary wake up for the app they can
react to this high priority message and

00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:33.670
react to this high priority message and
 

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:35.280
react to this high priority message and
be able to respond appropriately in case

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:35.290
be able to respond appropriately in case
 

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:36.870
be able to respond appropriately in case
it actually is something important like

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880
it actually is something important like
 

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:39.000
it actually is something important like
you know a text message if you're like a

probably gonna think this is great I'll
 

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.310
probably gonna think this is great I'll
add high priority to every message I

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:47.320
add high priority to every message I
 

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:48.660

then it's worth getting the users

00:14:56.100 --> 00:14:56.110
then it's worth getting the users
 

00:14:56.110 --> 00:14:58.050

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:26.630
still able to do an complement and we're
 

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:28.930
still able to do an complement and we're
still able to preserve our battery so

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:28.940
still able to preserve our battery so
 

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:30.580

it we care about battery so one alarm

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:42.500
it we care about battery so one alarm

will go off in a fifteen minute period

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:43.820
will go off in a fifteen minute period
 

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:45.220
will go off in a fifteen minute period
so if you trigger two right after each

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:45.230
so if you trigger two right after each
 

00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:46.540

there's gonna be a fifteen minute delay

00:16:47.950 --> 00:16:47.960
there's gonna be a fifteen minute delay
 

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:49.900
there's gonna be a fifteen minute delay
before the second one triggers which it

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:49.910
before the second one triggers which it
 

00:16:49.910 --> 00:16:52.090

actually is fine most apps will affect

00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:52.100

done it while you were listening to me
 

00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:53.269
done it while you were listening to me
and already be done so you can still

that you probably don't qualify for it
 

00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:06.590

to this beautiful mental model that I
told you to memorize right and we can't

about app standby is it has the exact

00:18:53.779 --> 00:18:53.789
about app standby is it has the exact
 

00:18:53.789 --> 00:18:56.240
about app standby is it has the exact
same goals as dothis does it's really

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:56.250
same goals as dothis does it's really
 

00:18:56.250 --> 00:18:57.560

easy to remember we just care about the

00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:57.570
easy to remember we just care about the
 

00:18:57.570 --> 00:18:59.180
easy to remember we just care about the
battery we care about a beautiful user

00:18:59.180 --> 00:18:59.190
battery we care about a beautiful user
 

00:18:59.190 --> 00:19:01.399
battery we care about a beautiful user
user experience and making sure that we

user experience and making sure that we
 

00:19:01.409 --> 00:19:04.460
user experience and making sure that we
can get that at all times because this

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:04.470
can get that at all times because this
 

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:05.600

is that mental model that you totally
 

00:19:05.610 --> 00:19:07.070
is that mental model that you totally
forgot by now right because it's so

00:19:07.070 --> 00:19:07.080
forgot by now right because it's so
 

00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.960
forgot by now right because it's so
complicated over time we want every

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:08.970
complicated over time we want every
 

00:19:08.970 --> 00:19:10.100
complicated over time we want every
background thing to be happening in

00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:10.110
background thing to be happening in
 

00:19:10.110 --> 00:19:12.409

their device actively we never get into
doze mode we still want to be able to

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:15.600
doze mode we still want to be able to
 

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.320
doze mode we still want to be able to
optimize for them so we've done is we've

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:18.330
optimize for them so we've done is we've
 

00:19:18.330 --> 00:19:21.529
optimize for them so we've done is we've
made a slight comparison which stands

00:19:21.529 --> 00:19:21.539
made a slight comparison which stands
 

00:19:21.539 --> 00:19:25.039
made a slight comparison which stands
out in the sense that it affects apps it

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:25.049
out in the sense that it affects apps it
 

00:19:25.049 --> 00:19:26.180
out in the sense that it affects apps it
doesn't affect the whole device the

doesn't affect the whole device the
device is still functional but if an app

00:19:28.039 --> 00:19:28.049
device is still functional but if an app
 

00:19:28.049 --> 00:19:29.779
device is still functional but if an app
hasn't been used in a while that we're

hasn't been used in a while that we're
 

00:19:29.789 --> 00:19:31.549
hasn't been used in a while that we're
going to kind of decrease when that app

00:19:31.549 --> 00:19:31.559
going to kind of decrease when that app
 

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:33.320
going to kind of decrease when that app
has access the current try to optimize

all of the quiet ones okay so other
 

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:37.460
all of the quiet ones okay so other
things you want to know about the

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:37.470
things you want to know about the
 

00:19:37.470 --> 00:19:39.019
things you want to know about the
difference before we go into this is

00:19:39.019 --> 00:19:39.029
difference before we go into this is
 

00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:40.700
difference before we go into this is
that we're definitely restricting

00:19:40.700 --> 00:19:40.710
that we're definitely restricting
 

00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:41.930
that we're definitely restricting
network access because we care about

00:19:41.930 --> 00:19:41.940
network access because we care about
 

00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:43.070
network access because we care about
that except now we're doing it on the

00:19:43.070 --> 00:19:43.080
that except now we're doing it on the
 

00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:45.230
that except now we're doing it on the
app level instead of on the device level

00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:45.240
app level instead of on the device level
 

00:19:45.240 --> 00:19:47.419

and syncs they'll get their chance I
 

00:19:48.809 --> 00:19:50.630
and syncs they'll get their chance I
promise look at their chance but it's

00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:50.640
promise look at their chance but it's
 

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.940
promise look at their chance but it's
going to be in a controlled way we're

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:52.950
going to be in a controlled way we're
 

00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:55.070
going to be in a controlled way we're
gonna honor wakelocks though we're going

00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:55.080
gonna honor wakelocks though we're going
 

00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:55.940
gonna honor wakelocks though we're going
to like

00:19:55.940 --> 00:19:55.950
to like
 

00:19:55.950 --> 00:19:57.230
to like
- your way clocks to respect your way

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:57.240
- your way clocks to respect your way
 

00:19:57.240 --> 00:19:58.519
- your way clocks to respect your way
clocks and we're gonna respect your

00:19:58.519 --> 00:19:58.529
clocks and we're gonna respect your
 

00:19:58.529 --> 00:20:01.039

alarms from alarm manager and this these
 

00:20:01.049 --> 00:20:02.659
alarms from alarm manager and this these
two things at the end that's what's

00:20:02.659 --> 00:20:02.669
two things at the end that's what's
 

00:20:02.669 --> 00:20:04.240
two things at the end that's what's
going to have made all of the difference

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:04.250
going to have made all of the difference
 

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:06.889
going to have made all of the difference
because app standby is triggered

00:20:06.889 --> 00:20:06.899
because app standby is triggered
 

00:20:06.899 --> 00:20:10.580
because app standby is triggered
differently than dozes so it's triggered

00:20:10.580 --> 00:20:10.590
differently than dozes so it's triggered
 

00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:12.409
differently than dozes so it's triggered
when again the users not using your app

00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419
when again the users not using your app
 

00:20:12.419 --> 00:20:14.240
when again the users not using your app
so this is similar idea to the device

00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:14.250
so this is similar idea to the device
 

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:15.860
so this is similar idea to the device
except they just aren't opening your app

00:20:15.860 --> 00:20:15.870

they haven't opened it all month they're
 

00:20:17.279 --> 00:20:19.940
they haven't opened it all month they're
not really that interested in it and I'm

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:19.950
not really that interested in it and I'm
 

00:20:19.950 --> 00:20:21.529
not really that interested in it and I'm
sorry like it's not every app is used

00:20:21.529 --> 00:20:21.539
sorry like it's not every app is used
 

00:20:21.539 --> 00:20:22.789
sorry like it's not every app is used
every day remember at the toothbrush

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799
every day remember at the toothbrush

maybe you don't have any active
 

00:20:26.429 --> 00:20:28.370
maybe you don't have any active
activities or foreground services like

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:28.380
activities or foreground services like
 

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:29.690

you're streaming music like we get that
 

00:20:31.710 --> 00:20:33.080
you're streaming music like we get that
that that's kind of important and like

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:33.090
that that's kind of important and like
 

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:34.220
that that's kind of important and like
they're not interacting with your app

they're not interacting with your app
 

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.570
they're not interacting with your app
but they're listening to it for the

services and activities those are
 

00:20:39.870 --> 00:20:41.659
services and activities those are
respected and even more than that we

00:20:41.659 --> 00:20:41.669
respected and even more than that we

activities if they were launched by
another app it doesn't have to be

00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:46.110
another app it doesn't have to be
 

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:47.509
another app it doesn't have to be
launched by the user but if you're you

00:20:47.509 --> 00:20:47.519
launched by the user but if you're you
 

00:20:47.519 --> 00:20:49.159
launched by the user but if you're you
know app behaves in response to another

00:20:49.159 --> 00:20:49.169
know app behaves in response to another
 

00:20:49.169 --> 00:20:50.840
know app behaves in response to another
app but we respect that to anything in

00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:50.850
app but we respect that to anything in
 

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:53.029
app but we respect that to anything in
the foreground is safe but this is where

00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039
the foreground is safe but this is where
 

00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:54.680
the foreground is safe but this is where
our differences matter there are no

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:54.690

which means that you actually have this

00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:01.590
which means that you actually have this
 

00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:03.710
which means that you actually have this
really cool way of getting yourself out

00:21:03.710 --> 00:21:03.720
really cool way of getting yourself out
 

00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:05.509
really cool way of getting yourself out
of that standby when it matters to your

00:21:05.509 --> 00:21:05.519
of that standby when it matters to your
 

00:21:05.519 --> 00:21:07.879
of that standby when it matters to your
app so let's talk about how to get do

00:21:07.879 --> 00:21:07.889
app so let's talk about how to get do
 

00:21:07.889 --> 00:21:10.070
app so let's talk about how to get do
that so apps to anybody's gonna end when

00:21:10.070 --> 00:21:10.080
that so apps to anybody's gonna end when
 

00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:11.450
that so apps to anybody's gonna end when
you know the user wants to use your app

00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:11.460
you know the user wants to use your app
 

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:13.310
you know the user wants to use your app
that's a very clear signal to us they

00:21:13.310 --> 00:21:13.320
that's a very clear signal to us they
 

00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:14.570
that's a very clear signal to us they
want to interact with you you're gonna

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:14.580
want to interact with you you're gonna
 

00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:16.730
want to interact with you you're gonna
interact with them or the device is

00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:16.740
interact with them or the device is
 

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.289
interact with them or the device is
plugged in because again we're doing all

00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:18.299
plugged in because again we're doing all
 

00:21:18.299 --> 00:21:19.909
plugged in because again we're doing all
of this for battery so if we're plugged

00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919
of this for battery so if we're plugged
 

00:21:19.919 --> 00:21:21.200
of this for battery so if we're plugged
into the wall everything's free

00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:21.210
into the wall everything's free
 

00:21:21.210 --> 00:21:22.940
into the wall everything's free
everything is released from us and by

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:22.950
everything is released from us and by
 

00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:24.590
everything is released from us and by
doze it ends like everything is for you

00:21:24.590 --> 00:21:24.600
doze it ends like everything is for you
 

00:21:24.600 --> 00:21:26.000
doze it ends like everything is for you
to behave as they want as long as we

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:26.010
to behave as they want as long as we
 

00:21:26.010 --> 00:21:28.639
to behave as they want as long as we
have power coming but the most important

00:21:28.639 --> 00:21:28.649
have power coming but the most important
 

00:21:28.649 --> 00:21:30.529
have power coming but the most important
is that maybe your alarm manager set an

00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539
is that maybe your alarm manager set an
 

00:21:30.539 --> 00:21:32.269
is that maybe your alarm manager set an
alarm and that alarm is gonna go off and

00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:32.279
alarm and that alarm is gonna go off and
 

00:21:32.279 --> 00:21:33.769
alarm and that alarm is gonna go off and
then because the alarm went off you're

00:21:33.769 --> 00:21:33.779
then because the alarm went off you're
 

00:21:33.779 --> 00:21:35.090
then because the alarm went off you're
gonna do some sort of work in response

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100
gonna do some sort of work in response
 

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:36.500
gonna do some sort of work in response
to that and you're gonna create a

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:36.510
to that and you're gonna create a
 

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:37.820
to that and you're gonna create a
notification to the user that

00:21:37.820 --> 00:21:37.830
notification to the user that
 

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:39.470
notification to the user that
something's up-to-date maybe at 6:00

00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480
something's up-to-date maybe at 6:00
 

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.759
something's up-to-date maybe at 6:00

way you think about some of the

00:27:06.070 --> 00:27:06.080
way you think about some of the
 

00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:06.909
way you think about some of the
assumptions you made in your

assumptions you made in your
 

00:27:06.919 --> 00:27:08.769
assumptions you made in your
architecture and then your jobs and your

00:27:08.769 --> 00:27:08.779
architecture and then your jobs and your
 

00:27:08.779 --> 00:27:11.139

sinks or might happen a couple hours
 

00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:12.789
