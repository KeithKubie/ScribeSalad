00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.779
- [Voiceover] Let's think a
little bit how energy flows,

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:07.362
and how matter is
recycled in an ecosystem.

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:11.099
And so the whole time that
we go through this video,

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.829
think about these two ideas.

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:14.268
And even after watching this video,

00:00:14.268 --> 00:00:15.789
look at ecosystems around yourself,

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.182
even ones that you're a part of

00:00:17.182 --> 00:00:20.967
and think about how energy
flows and how matter's recycled.

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:23.394
Let's first think about energy.

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:26.180
The energy for most ecosystems

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.282
originally comes from the Sun.

00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:29.559
There are other sources of energy,

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:31.579
you could think about even moonlight,

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.133
but that essentially comes from the Sun.

00:00:34.133 --> 00:00:36.245
But there's also geothermal energy,

00:00:36.245 --> 00:00:39.740
but the Sun is a source of
most energy for most ecosystems

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.145
we could think of.

00:00:41.145 --> 00:00:43.618
And how does the ecosystem
make use of that energy?

00:00:43.618 --> 00:00:45.057
How does it get into,

00:00:45.057 --> 00:00:47.077
how does it that get
stored within the ecosystem

00:00:47.077 --> 00:00:49.040
especially as biomass?

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.303
Well, it starts with primary producers

00:00:51.303 --> 00:00:52.952
which are usually going to be plants.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:57.119
They can also be bacteria that
are able to photosynthesize,

00:00:58.752 --> 00:01:01.735
or that are able to take that
energy and create biomolecules

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:03.743
that store energy from it.

00:01:03.743 --> 00:01:06.660
And so these are primary producers,

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:10.857
these plants in this diagram.

00:01:10.857 --> 00:01:13.980
Sometimes you'll see them
referred to as autotrophs.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.160
They are getting their
own food from the Sun,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.577
from this energy.

00:01:20.424 --> 00:01:23.094
And once again, how is that energy stored?

00:01:23.094 --> 00:01:25.637
Well, it's stored in these
biological molecules.

00:01:25.637 --> 00:01:28.806
If you were to zoom in into
the molecules in this plant,

00:01:28.806 --> 00:01:30.490
and this is a huge oversimplification,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.321
you'll see all these bonds
between these carbons.

00:01:34.321 --> 00:01:37.072
And to make those bonds requires energy

00:01:37.072 --> 00:01:39.174
and if you were to break those bonds

00:01:39.174 --> 00:01:41.473
it could release energy.

00:01:41.473 --> 00:01:42.306
And you might say, well,

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:45.919
where did all these carbons
come from that are in this tree?

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:48.137
Well, the carbon is coming from the air.

00:01:48.137 --> 00:01:50.644
Our air has carbon dioxide in it.

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:53.561
It has carbon dioxide,
so those are the carbons,

00:01:53.561 --> 00:01:55.213
maybe let me draw some oxygens.

00:01:55.213 --> 00:01:57.880
So two oxygens for every carbon.

00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:01.749
And the whole process of photosynthesis

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.932
is all about fixing that carbon.

00:02:03.932 --> 00:02:05.453
Let me write that word down.

00:02:05.453 --> 00:02:07.536
We are fixing that carbon

00:02:11.246 --> 00:02:14.857
from a gaseous form when
it's part of carbon dioxide,

00:02:14.857 --> 00:02:16.703
into the structure of the plant,

00:02:16.703 --> 00:02:19.779
into the biological
molecules of the plant.

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.498
So it's storing that energy.

00:02:21.498 --> 00:02:23.715
Now it's not a perfectly
efficient process.

00:02:23.715 --> 00:02:26.223
Not all of the energy from the Sun

00:02:26.223 --> 00:02:28.487
is going to be able to be stored.

00:02:28.487 --> 00:02:30.333
Some of it is being reflected.

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.166
Even the plant itself as it lives,

00:02:34.721 --> 00:02:38.390
as it reproduces, as its cells divide,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.992
some of that energy is used.

00:02:39.992 --> 00:02:43.034
And eventually, that
energy is released as heat.

00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:44.509
And you're gonna see this trend a lot

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:46.111
in thermodynamic systems,

00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:48.897
that you're going from one energy,

00:02:48.897 --> 00:02:51.196
you're using energy to do some work,

00:02:51.196 --> 00:02:55.178
but in the process, you are
going to be producing heat.

00:02:55.178 --> 00:02:58.951
But this is just the
beginning of our energy flow.

00:02:58.951 --> 00:03:01.506
Now we could think about
how that energy now flows

00:03:01.506 --> 00:03:03.978
to the other actors in the ecosystem.

00:03:03.978 --> 00:03:07.136
So the next phase, and this
is a very simplified diagram

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:08.750
or ecosystem that we're thinking about.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.152
Most ecosystems are far,
far, far more complex.

00:03:12.152 --> 00:03:15.321
Let's think about the characters
that would eat the plants,

00:03:15.321 --> 00:03:18.328
the characters that would
eat the primary producers,

00:03:18.328 --> 00:03:20.876
and we call the folks that
eat the primary producers,

00:03:20.876 --> 00:03:23.965
we call them primary consumers.

00:03:23.965 --> 00:03:27.877
So this bunny, or this
squirrel right over here,

00:03:27.877 --> 00:03:30.127
they are primary consumers.

00:03:31.987 --> 00:03:35.157
They consume the primary producers.

00:03:35.157 --> 00:03:36.678
And why do they consume them?

00:03:36.678 --> 00:03:39.499
Why does a bunny eat the grass?

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:43.119
Well, because it gets
energy from those bonds

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.521
in the biological molecules,
from those carbon bonds,

00:03:46.521 --> 00:03:48.483
and other bonds.

00:03:48.483 --> 00:03:52.546
And it's able to use that
energy to grow itself,

00:03:52.546 --> 00:03:55.629
to reproduce, to live, to run around,

00:03:56.494 --> 00:04:00.720
and it also stores some of
that energy in its own biomass.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.773
And once again, this process
is not very efficient.

00:04:03.773 --> 00:04:08.603
Going from one layer of trophic
to another layer of trophic,

00:04:08.603 --> 00:04:10.484
you only have about 10%,

00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:14.416
10% of the energy gets transferred

00:04:14.416 --> 00:04:17.166
or gets stored in the next layer.

00:04:18.526 --> 00:04:20.128
Why only 10%?

00:04:20.128 --> 00:04:24.250
Well, because not all
of the plants get eaten.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:28.577
The whole process of eating
plants, digesting plants,

00:04:28.577 --> 00:04:31.993
some of the energy gets pooped out,

00:04:31.993 --> 00:04:33.357
gets pooped out

00:04:33.357 --> 00:04:36.858
because the primary consumer
here, or the consumer

00:04:36.858 --> 00:04:39.284
isn't able to get all of it out

00:04:39.284 --> 00:04:41.885
of the actual biological molecules.

00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:44.834
And so overall, it's
an inefficient process.

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:46.645
Now, we're not done yet.

00:04:46.645 --> 00:04:49.315
We still have energy stored
in the biological molecules

00:04:49.315 --> 00:04:51.208
of this primary consumer that someone

00:04:51.208 --> 00:04:52.531
might be interested in.

00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:54.389
And we know that in many ecosystems

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:57.501
there are things that like to
eat rabbits or even squirrels.

00:04:57.501 --> 00:05:00.333
And in this drawing it will be this fox.

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:03.422
And this fox because it
eats primary consumers,

00:05:03.422 --> 00:05:06.870
we would call it a secondary consumer.

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.459
The secondary consumer.

00:05:09.459 --> 00:05:11.850
And you could keep going on with this

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.022
if there were some character out here.

00:05:14.022 --> 00:05:17.644
Let's say there's some guy
who likes to eat foxes.

00:05:17.644 --> 00:05:19.490
That's a knife in his hand that he uses

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.138
to go after the foxes with.

00:05:21.138 --> 00:05:24.006
Well, so the fox could go to him,

00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:25.933
and once again, why is he eating foxes?

00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:28.650
Well, he wants that energy in that fox,

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:31.657
and actually it's not
just about molecules.

00:05:31.657 --> 00:05:33.224
We'll talk about matter in a second.

00:05:33.224 --> 00:05:35.442
He wants the energy and
the matter from the fox

00:05:35.442 --> 00:05:38.077
to grow and live himself.

00:05:38.077 --> 00:05:41.978
And so this character would
be called a tertiary consumer.

00:05:41.978 --> 00:05:43.478
Tertiary consumer.

00:05:45.485 --> 00:05:47.493
And if there's no one
who wants to eat him,

00:05:47.493 --> 00:05:50.988
well then he would be
considered an apex consumer,

00:05:50.988 --> 00:05:52.718
or an apex predator.

00:05:52.718 --> 00:05:54.738
And these characters
that eat other animals,

00:05:54.738 --> 00:05:57.245
we've talked about it before,
they're called carnivores.

00:05:57.245 --> 00:05:59.138
But let me just say, he's the apex.

00:05:59.138 --> 00:06:01.019
And apex, we're really thinking

00:06:01.019 --> 00:06:02.574
about the top of the food chain.

00:06:02.574 --> 00:06:03.979
That's why they're called,

00:06:03.979 --> 00:06:08.008
that would be called an apex
consumer, or an apex predator.

00:06:08.008 --> 00:06:10.713
But we're not done yet
because at some point

00:06:10.713 --> 00:06:12.931
all of these characters,
whether we're talking

00:06:12.931 --> 00:06:15.102
about the trees, the bunnies, the fox,

00:06:15.102 --> 00:06:18.886
this character who likes to eat foxes,

00:06:18.886 --> 00:06:20.895
they're going to die.

00:06:20.895 --> 00:06:23.449
And that energy just doesn't disappear.

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:24.390
In general, you're going to see,

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.513
energy is conserved and it
flows from one place to another.

00:06:27.513 --> 00:06:31.680
That energy is then going to
be used by these characters

00:06:33.328 --> 00:06:36.410
right over here, which
we call decomposers.

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:40.020
They can take all that leftover
energy and that dead carcass

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.109
or even in the poop, and
they can make use of it,

00:06:43.109 --> 00:06:46.812
once again, for them to
live, for them to reproduce.

00:06:46.812 --> 00:06:49.395
And then by breaking that down,

00:06:50.252 --> 00:06:52.687
they can release a lot of those nutrients

00:06:52.687 --> 00:06:53.918
and the matter that's used.

00:06:53.918 --> 00:06:55.524
And once again, the matter's recycled,

00:06:55.524 --> 00:06:58.607
once again, to be used by the plants.

00:07:00.202 --> 00:07:02.466
So it creates this really nice cycle.

00:07:02.466 --> 00:07:04.069
And the important thing to realize is

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:06.321
that it comes in as light
that energy gets transferred

00:07:06.321 --> 00:07:10.802
as we go through the
different layers of trophic.

00:07:10.802 --> 00:07:14.169
And it's not a completely
efficient process,

00:07:14.169 --> 00:07:15.203
and a lot of that energy,

00:07:15.203 --> 00:07:18.314
especially as these organisms
live, and reproduce,

00:07:18.314 --> 00:07:21.397
and run around gets released as heat.

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:24.038
Now we've focused a lot on the energy,

00:07:24.038 --> 00:07:25.965
let's think a little about the matter.

00:07:25.965 --> 00:07:29.088
I've already touched on it,
but the matter is recycled.

00:07:29.088 --> 00:07:31.886
There isn't, at least the
way that we've set this up,

00:07:31.886 --> 00:07:34.347
there isn't new matter that is entering

00:07:34.347 --> 00:07:37.842
or leaving these ecosystems
or being magically created

00:07:37.842 --> 00:07:39.781
or magically destroyed.

00:07:39.781 --> 00:07:42.033
As I mentioned, when you look at a leaf

00:07:42.033 --> 00:07:44.541
on a plant growing, or a tree growing,

00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:46.793
or a leave of grass growing,

00:07:46.793 --> 00:07:49.212
that matter isn't just
coming out of nowhere,

00:07:49.212 --> 00:07:51.454
it's coming out of,

00:07:51.454 --> 00:07:52.918
it's just a different form,

00:07:52.918 --> 00:07:54.764
or maybe the best way to put it,

00:07:54.764 --> 00:07:58.143
that matter was always there
in the form of carbon dioxide.

00:07:58.143 --> 00:08:00.767
The plant is just using
that energy from the Sun

00:08:00.767 --> 00:08:04.934
to fix that carbon from a
gas form into a solid form.

00:08:06.328 --> 00:08:10.570
And it's able to use
that energy to form bonds

00:08:10.570 --> 00:08:13.445
between the carbons in
these biological molecules

00:08:13.445 --> 00:08:15.209
that actually store energy.

00:08:15.209 --> 00:08:17.555
And the plant can use that energy to grow

00:08:17.555 --> 00:08:19.726
and as we've talked about,
things that eat the plants,

00:08:19.726 --> 00:08:21.827
or things that eat the
things that eat the plants

00:08:21.827 --> 00:08:23.847
can use that energy.

00:08:23.847 --> 00:08:27.052
And as we talked before,
the carbon dioxide

00:08:27.052 --> 00:08:29.432
comes in these plants.

00:08:29.432 --> 00:08:32.021
And maybe this arrow might
be a little bit misleading,

00:08:32.021 --> 00:08:34.438
so let me erase that for now.

00:08:36.386 --> 00:08:38.553
But we release oxygen, O2.

00:08:40.658 --> 00:08:43.162
That oxygen, and we've seen that as part

00:08:43.162 --> 00:08:44.777
of the photosynthesis process,

00:08:44.777 --> 00:08:48.777
that oxygen is used by
the animals to metabolize

00:08:51.221 --> 00:08:53.039
these biological molecules.

00:08:53.039 --> 00:08:56.675
We studied that in biology in respiration.

00:08:56.675 --> 00:08:58.783
And the matter itself, as we say,

00:08:58.783 --> 00:09:00.413
we have this carbon right over here.

00:09:00.413 --> 00:09:02.341
When it gets eaten, well
then that becomes part

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:05.841
of the bio molecules inside of this bunny,

00:09:08.529 --> 00:09:12.186
and when the bunny uses any
of these biological molecules

00:09:12.186 --> 00:09:15.205
as a source of energy so it's
able to break those bonds

00:09:15.205 --> 00:09:16.389
through respiration.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:19.848
Well, then that carbon
gets released in the form

00:09:19.848 --> 00:09:23.931
of carbon dioxide, so
maybe this is a better way.

00:09:25.033 --> 00:09:28.620
Oh, actually it was already
drawn right over here.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.093
And so the important thing
to realize is that energy

00:09:31.093 --> 00:09:33.637
is flowing, light from the
Sun comes in, it's slow,

00:09:33.637 --> 00:09:35.528
you know all this action goes on,

00:09:35.528 --> 00:09:37.267
and then it gets released as heat

00:09:37.267 --> 00:09:40.518
on almost every step,
but the matter itself,

00:09:40.518 --> 00:09:41.830
it's always been there.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.384
All of the atoms in our body, on Earth,

00:09:44.384 --> 00:09:46.450
it's just constantly being recycled.

00:09:46.450 --> 00:09:49.655
It's actually was
generated inside of stars

00:09:49.655 --> 00:09:52.081
many, many billions of years ago,

00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:54.998
and we just keep reusing it
over, and over, and over again.

00:09:54.998 --> 00:09:58.362
It gets recycled from one form to another,

00:09:58.362 --> 00:10:01.279
even after all of these actors die,

00:10:02.995 --> 00:10:04.515
the decomposers break them down

00:10:04.515 --> 00:10:06.199
into simple inorganic molecules.

00:10:06.199 --> 00:10:08.207
As we talked about before,

00:10:08.207 --> 00:10:11.087
that can then be used as
the plants in conjunction

00:10:11.087 --> 00:10:14.988
with the carbon from the air
and the light from the Sun

00:10:14.988 --> 00:10:18.923
and water that it gets through its roots

00:10:18.923 --> 00:10:22.840
to start that process
all over, all over again.
