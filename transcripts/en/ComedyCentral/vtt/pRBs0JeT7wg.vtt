00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:04.421
Okay, you heard it here first.
Minotaurs are people.

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:05.881
See you next time on
Every Damn Day.

00:00:05.881 --> 00:00:07.132
- Cut.
- I don't know, man.

00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:08.884
I still don't think they should
be able to get married.

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:10.093
- Wow, dude.
- It's not natural.

00:00:10.093 --> 00:00:11.345
Great show, guys.

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:12.930
Love the energy today,
but bad news,

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.224
Ryan is coming back
from his vacation today.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:16.516
Yeah, so watch out,

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:18.810
because he is going to want
to talk about it.

00:00:19.603 --> 00:00:22.397
Last time he left town, he
cornered me for like 10 minutes,

00:00:22.397 --> 00:00:24.066
and I ended up missing
my hot yogurt class.

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:25.400
You mean, yoga.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.027
Oh, you misheard me.
I said yogurt.

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:30.364
The thing I hate about Ryan
is his face and what he says.

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.003
I'm back.

00:00:46.588 --> 00:00:47.881
Run.

00:00:47.881 --> 00:00:49.549
I've got photos.

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:52.094
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:57.182
Shit. They always get
the black dude first.

00:00:57.182 --> 00:01:00.143
Chris, is that you buddy?
You pooping?

00:01:00.686 --> 00:01:03.021
I gotta tell you about
the bathrooms at Six Flags.

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:04.314
Woo. What a doozy.

00:01:04.314 --> 00:01:06.441
This is the ladies' room.

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.151
Hey, check out
this caricature of me.

00:01:08.151 --> 00:01:09.403
What am I?
George Bush?

00:01:09.403 --> 00:01:11.488
Ahhhh!

00:01:11.488 --> 00:01:13.991
Who wants to hear
about my vacation?

00:01:17.953 --> 00:01:21.290
I've got water park photos
to show you.

00:01:22.165 --> 00:01:26.003
Ah, Natasha. You gotta see this.
I gotta great one to show you.

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:31.758
No, please. No.
You're a monster. A monster.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.387
Oh god. The lazy river.
No there's so many.

00:01:40.183 --> 00:01:42.227
- (sneezes)
- Jordy!

00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:44.771
Shit. I forgot
I'm allergic to mud.

00:01:44.771 --> 00:01:47.065
Did you could get
a speeding ticket on a jet ski?

00:01:47.065 --> 00:01:48.275
No, no, no, no, no.

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:49.985
I had a great vacation.

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:01.163
You ever been on a paddle boat?

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.584
- No, I haven't.
- They are a lot of fun.

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:09.129
I don't wanna. No, no!

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:22.976
Enough is enough.

00:02:22.976 --> 00:02:24.644
I'm going to show you
these photos

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.229
whether you like it or not.

00:02:26.229 --> 00:02:27.689
Over my dead body.

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.399
That can be arranged.

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.278
I've got photos.

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:35.489
(slow motion roaring)

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.039
Ow, god. My phone.

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.832
You're nothing
with your pictures, bitch.

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.167
I don't have insurance on this.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.127
You started it. I finished it.

00:02:49.127 --> 00:02:50.796
Family plan.

00:02:54.257 --> 00:02:56.510
Hey Hanna.
Ever heard of the cloud?

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:02.474
Yeah!
(laughing)
