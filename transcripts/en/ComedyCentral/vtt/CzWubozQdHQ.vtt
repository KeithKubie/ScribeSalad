- [Mosher voiceover] Hey,
this is Moshe Kasher.

00:00:06.171 --> 00:00:07.707
- [Natasha Voiceover]
And Natasha Leggero.

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:09.375 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Mosher voiceover] We just
got married 6 months ago.

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:11.110
- [Natasha voiceover] Which
we think pretty much makes us

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:13.178
qualified to give love
advice to strangers.

00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:14.547
- [Mosher voiceover]
So that's what we did.

00:00:14.547 --> 00:00:16.249
We packed up the
car, hit the road,

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:17.884
and spread the love.

00:00:17.884 --> 00:00:22.055 align:start position:0% line:0%
- [Mosher and Natasha voiceover]
This is The Honeymoon Tour.

00:00:24.023 --> 00:00:26.425
(jazz music)

00:00:26.425 --> 00:00:27.394
- Are you filming?

00:00:27.394 --> 00:00:28.461
- [Man] Yeah.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:33.366 line:0%
- Before every show,
I liked these Scoops

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.436
- I had a joke about Scoops.

00:00:37.436 --> 00:00:38.905 align:start size:84% position:16%
Probably couldn't
get away with it now,

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:43.242 align:start size:88% position:13%
'cause it's kinda a
little bit fat-shaming.

00:00:43.242 --> 00:00:47.246
It was about a woman that
I once saw in an airport

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:51.217
and she had a king-sized
Snicker bar ice cream.

00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:55.254
She was scooping
out the ice cream

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:57.823
with these Tostitos Scoops.

00:00:57.823 --> 00:00:58.791
- Ew!

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:00.159
- Scooping out the ice cream

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.328
and eating it like,

00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:03.262
all like--

00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:04.730
- You can't do a joke like that

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.733
'cause it's fat-shaming?

00:01:09.234 --> 00:01:10.603
- I mean I could do the joke,

00:01:10.603 --> 00:01:12.439
but it might not work.

00:01:13.306 --> 00:01:14.440
But isn't that funny?

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.774
- Yeah that is funny.

00:01:15.774 --> 00:01:18.277
- Washing it down
with a king-sized

00:01:18.277 --> 00:01:19.812
double-tall Red Bull.

00:01:19.812 --> 00:01:21.314
- (Laughs)

00:01:21.314 --> 00:01:24.250
- I was like, "You want to
be awake for this?" (laughs)

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.951 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Does anyone have
a real problem?

00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:27.286
- A real question?

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:28.520
Want to come up?
- Something that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.789
they would like--
- You can come up.

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:30.990
Not a joke one.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.957
- Okay, hold on.
- Not a joke one.

00:01:31.957 --> 00:01:32.859
- Wait, but hold one. Is he ...

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:33.959
Are you in a relationship?

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:35.127 align:start size:75% position:25%
- [Man] No.
- Oh you're not.

00:01:35.127 --> 00:01:35.962
- Okay, we got a single.

00:01:35.962 --> 00:01:37.329
All right, hold on.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:38.164
What's your name?

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:38.998
- Zayer.

00:01:38.998 --> 00:01:39.965
- Zayer?

00:01:39.965 --> 00:01:41.133
- Very big fan of both of you.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.035 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Thank you
- Thank you very much.

00:01:43.035 --> 00:01:45.972
- My question is, "Why
do women love assholes?"

00:01:45.972 --> 00:01:48.307
(laughter)

00:01:48.307 --> 00:01:50.643
- [Moshe] You mean why
do women love jerks?

00:01:50.643 --> 00:01:52.144
- Yeah. I don't know.

00:01:52.144 --> 00:01:53.712
I try to be nice to them

00:01:53.712 --> 00:01:55.314
but it's like every single time,

00:01:55.314 --> 00:01:56.482
it just doesn't work out.

00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:57.784
- [Amanda] Okay,
how old are you?

00:01:57.784 --> 00:01:59.285 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Wait, say it again.
- I'm 19.

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:00.486
(audience boos)

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.788
- Woah. Way to be "boo".

00:02:02.788 --> 00:02:05.525
Boo, "19". How developed
were you when you were 19?

00:02:05.525 --> 00:02:06.492
(laughter)

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:07.392
Zayer's trying to understand.

00:02:07.392 --> 00:02:08.694
You're basically saying, Zayer,

00:02:08.694 --> 00:02:11.197
that you feel like the
women that you go after,

00:02:11.197 --> 00:02:12.031
'cause you're a nice guy,

00:02:12.031 --> 00:02:13.399
like mean people.

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.667
But maybe it's just that

00:02:14.667 --> 00:02:15.901 align:start size:84% position:16%
you haven't found
the right person yet.

00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:17.136
It's not about women,

00:02:17.136 --> 00:02:19.072 align:start size:88% position:13%
it's just about the
people that you've met.

00:02:19.072 --> 00:02:22.041 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So we can't make jokes
about fat, which I understand.

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.010
What else? Rape's
not funny anymore.

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.514 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I know, it sucks
that we live in a world

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:31.350
where rape's no
longer hilarious.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.685
- Everyone used to
have a rape joke,

00:02:32.685 --> 00:02:33.853
now you can't do 'em.

00:02:33.853 --> 00:02:36.489 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I think you should
do rape jokes.

00:02:37.923 --> 00:02:40.860
- They don't come to me anymore.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.097 align:start size:84% position:16%
- 'Cause you're scared
of the backlash?

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:48.001
- Everyone's just become
more sensitive about it,

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.669
including me.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:52.504
Well no, I'm just saying.

00:02:52.504 --> 00:02:55.408 align:start size:97% position:3%
No, I'm just saying, sensitive
about joking about it.

00:02:55.408 --> 00:02:56.375
- Right.

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:57.677
- Because comedy is, you know

00:02:57.677 --> 00:02:58.778
you try to diffuse
terrible situations

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:00.546
by making jokes about it.

00:03:00.546 --> 00:03:02.582
Absurd stuff. You know.

00:03:02.582 --> 00:03:04.884
It's not like I think
rape is not horrible.

00:03:04.884 --> 00:03:06.285
Of course it's horrible.

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.855
For eight years,
my strongest joke

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:10.123
was probably a rape joke.

00:03:10.123 --> 00:03:11.024
Or five years.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:12.224
- What is it?

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:14.627
- One time I knew this
girl, and she was like--

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.562 align:start size:84% position:16%
- This is a good
joke. I know this one.

00:03:16.562 --> 00:03:19.432 align:start size:84% position:16%
- "You seriously never
been raped before?"

00:03:19.432 --> 00:03:20.967
"No, why?"

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:24.036
"You never woke up at a party
and some guy was inside you?"

00:03:24.036 --> 00:03:25.538
"I never woke up at a party."

00:03:25.538 --> 00:03:27.906
- (Laughs) See?

00:03:27.906 --> 00:03:31.210
- Also, I would like to add that

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.880 align:start size:84% position:16%
I kinda liked assholes
'til I was like 30,

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.218
so it's gonna take a little
bit of time to meet someone.

00:03:39.218 --> 00:03:41.888 align:start size:84% position:16%
You might have to
grow up a little bit

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.922
and deal with some women.

00:03:43.922 --> 00:03:45.424 align:start size:84% position:16%
What are you looking
for in a woman?

00:03:45.424 --> 00:03:47.092
- I'm just looking to fuck 'em.

00:03:47.092 --> 00:03:49.261
(audience laughs)

00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:52.298 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Wait, wait, wait,
wait. Hold on.

00:03:52.298 --> 00:03:55.834
Okay, he's like,
"I gotta question.

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:59.939
"Why are women, these
trifling ass women,

00:03:59.939 --> 00:04:01.340
"all they want is
some man that'll

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.409
"use 'em, abuse 'em, and bounce.

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.977 align:start size:84% position:16%
"Me? I'm tryna'
fuck 'em and leave,

00:04:04.977 --> 00:04:08.648 align:start size:84% position:16%
"but it's a different
kind of fucking."

00:04:08.648 --> 00:04:11.783 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Okay, okay. Please
explain yourself.

00:04:11.783 --> 00:04:14.353
- Okay so I just feel
like you shouldn't,

00:04:14.353 --> 00:04:17.456 align:start size:84% position:16%
like for me, it's
cool if you wanna like

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:19.158
hook up with people and,

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:21.627 align:start size:97% position:3%
if you wanna have one-night
stands that's fine,

00:04:21.627 --> 00:04:23.029 align:start size:84% position:16%
but for me I just
feel like you should

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:24.496
get to know someone first.

00:04:24.496 --> 00:04:26.165
You know, see if they're cool.

00:04:26.165 --> 00:04:28.300 align:start size:81% position:19%
See if you have
that relationship,

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.002 align:start size:84% position:16%
then you know that
could carry on to sex,

00:04:30.002 --> 00:04:31.804
but it doesn't have to be like--

00:04:31.804 --> 00:04:33.339
- I have the solution.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:37.309
Hold on, Dan. I got, I know
what you need to do exactly.

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:40.646
Literally, you can't not do it.

00:04:40.646 --> 00:04:43.282 align:start size:97% position:3%
You need to be 11 years
older than you are right now.

00:04:43.282 --> 00:04:46.119
(audience cheers)
