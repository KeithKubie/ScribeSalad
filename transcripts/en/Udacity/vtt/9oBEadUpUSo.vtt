00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.040
To understand a method of means and analysis. Let us look at this blocks

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.360
word problem. This is a very famous problem in AI. It has occurred again and

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.930
again. And almost every textbook in AI has this problem. You're given a table on

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:19.680
which there are three blocks. And A is on table, B is on table, and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.440
C is on A. This is the initial state. And you want to move these blocks,

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.970
to the gold state. On this configuration, so that C is on table, B is on C and

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.780
A is on B. The problem looks very simple listen, doesn't it?

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.850
Let's introduce a couple of constraints.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.870
You may move only one block at a time, so you can't pick both A and B together.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.390
And second, you may only move a block that has nothing on top of it. So,

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.870
you cannot move block A in this configuration, because it has C on top of it.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.700
Let us also suppose that we're given some operators in this world.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:00.770
These operators essentially move some object to some location. For

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.140
example, we could move C to the table, or C onto B, or C onto A.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.740
Not all the operators may be applicable in the current state. C is already on A,

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.770
but in principle, all these, all of these operators are available. Given these

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.300
operators, and this initial state and this goal state, write a sequence of

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.040
operations that will move the blocks from the initial state to the goal state.
