1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.060
Yeah.
See,
Starbucks is way up the chart.
Look at that there.

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:08.180
Starbucks tall is like closing in on 200 and what does it looks like about two

3
00:00:08.611 --> 00:00:12.960
70 yeah,
somewhere in the range of 270 milligrams caffeine.

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.380
But that's a coffee.
That's not right.
Espresso coffee.

5
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.860
It would be better to go to Starbucks and get a tall coffee that,

6
00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.660
but there's an espresso.
See how low it is?
It's below a hundred.

7
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.320
So that's why I'm drinking so many.
So when I drank five,
I guess,

8
00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:28.320
I think I had five,
I think 500 milligrams,

9
00:00:28.321 --> 00:00:33.110
which is basically less than drinking two of these things.
See?
Yeah.

10
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.500
These Caveman Nitros.
These are the shit.
Yeah,
I live off these goddamn things.

11
00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:39.810
They're responsible for half my productivity.
Uh,

12
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.110
basically I'm too chicken shit to go on Adderall.
So I just,

13
00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:44.490
I just drink this stuff all day.

14
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.050
Good move.
Good move.
I,
there's nothing wrong with coffee,
man.
Scared of Adderall.

15
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.360
But people admit they're alert,
they're addicted to coffee and everyone's like,

16
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.780
God,
me too.
If you go,
dude,
I am so addicted to Adderall,
they'll let go.
Katie Jo,

17
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.870
not calling you to like,
you're going to think I'm laying,

18
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:06.810
but til five years ago I didn't even know what Adderall,
it was good.
No,

19
00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:10.380
I think you're smart.
I like all my friends in Houston.

20
00:01:10.381 --> 00:01:15.000
They do it and I asked my friend,
like I texted him and I go,
hey man,

21
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.690
you got a,
what's your addie?
And he goes,
yeah,
we got Adderall.
I was like,

22
00:01:18.691 --> 00:01:21.510
what are you know your address to go to your house?

23
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.260
Like literally he thought it was talking about Adderall and then he explained to

24
00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:28.410
me like when you're in a club and you want to stay up and you want to stay like

25
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.520
energize you take Adderall.
And I was like,
oh,
okay.
But I,

26
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.880
I don't drink so I can stay up till three,
four o'clock in the morning,

27
00:01:35.881 --> 00:01:36.714
I'd be fine.

28
00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.780
What's fascinating about Adderall is what they've essentially done is taken an

29
00:01:40.781 --> 00:01:45.781
amphetamine and made it so that if you prescribe it for a condition,

30
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.010
right?
Like they give it to people who have what add is one of them,

31
00:01:50.011 --> 00:01:51.150
write whatever the fuck that means.

32
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.080
And it's very debatable whether or not you have it or don't have.

33
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:59.180
Everybody has a B.
Dot.
I have it for sure if it's real,
if it's real,
I have it.

34
00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.640
But they give you Adderall,
which is fucking speed.

35
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:06.660
And because it's a medication that you give to somebody who has supposedly has a

36
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:09.780
condition.
And by the way,
I'm not diagnosing you.
If you're out there,

37
00:02:09.781 --> 00:02:12.000
you're getting frustrated with me right now.
Just listen to me.

38
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.000
It's fucking speed.
Maybe you need speed.

39
00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.920
Maybe you're that person that needs speed.

40
00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.440
Maybe you do need it legitimately as a medication,

41
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.580
but there's a fuck load of people that are just doing speed.

42
00:02:24.581 --> 00:02:27.450
So by somebody giving you speed,
it's supposed to slow you down.

43
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:30.870
So you want to have add,
is that the reason they say legit?

44
00:02:30.871 --> 00:02:33.540
If you have the legit add,
look,

45
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:37.860
I am not doubting that some people have what a hundred sky have worse than I

46
00:02:37.861 --> 00:02:42.510
have.
There's a spectrum,
right,
with everything.
But for some people,

47
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.740
when they take Adderall or similar type of substances,

48
00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.520
it actually lets them focus and they can,
they can actually be on track.

49
00:02:50.521 --> 00:02:54.920
So by speeding it up,
somehow it focuses at it.
I think it's,

50
00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.440
I think the idea is that it's proof that their system is wired wrong,

51
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.040
which is why when you give them that speed,
they can send her out and mellow out.
