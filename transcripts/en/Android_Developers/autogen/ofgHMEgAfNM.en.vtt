is a tool that is events based so it's

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109
is a tool that is events based so it's

not a dozen sample as an active profiler
 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:40.990
not a dozen sample as an active profiler
it's based on events that are fired from

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000
it's based on events that are fired from
 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.599
it's based on events that are fired from
from the system it records all these

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:43.609
from the system it records all these
 

00:03:43.609 --> 00:03:45.580
from the system it records all these
events and then it shows that all these

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590
events and then it shows that all these
 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.039
events and then it shows that all these
events in a common timeline where you

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049
events in a common timeline where you
 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.469

system process yes and this is very
 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.309
system process yes and this is very
interesting because you can see what

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490
there a very interesting formation most
 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.790
there a very interesting formation most
of the CPU is happening mostly CPU time

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800
of the CPU is happening mostly CPU time
 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.120
of the CPU is happening mostly CPU time
is spent on the CPU on the core 3 the

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:50.130
is spent on the CPU on the core 3 the
 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:55.130
is spent on the CPU on the core 3 the
other course are relatively light how I

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:55.140
other course are relatively light how I
 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.480
other course are relatively light how I
use the information where it depends on

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490
use the information where it depends on
 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.880
use the information where it depends on
what you're trying to do but for example

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890
what you're trying to do but for example
 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:00.080
what you're trying to do but for example
this would tell me

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090
this would tell me
 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.530
this would tell me
ok wait a second I might get a little

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540
ok wait a second I might get a little
 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.420
ok wait a second I might get a little
better framerate if I take this work and

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430
better framerate if I take this work and
 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.970
better framerate if I take this work and
I spread across multiple threads but now

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:10.980
I spread across multiple threads but now
 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.409
I spread across multiple threads but now
you don't have to guess these will tell

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419
you don't have to guess these will tell
 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:21.730
you don't have to guess these will tell
you let's look at this render thread

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740
 
 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.300
 
again here it's using quite a lot of CPU

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:26.310
again here it's using quite a lot of CPU
 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:28.340
again here it's using quite a lot of CPU
and you can see other icing signals

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350
and you can see other icing signals
 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.909
and you can see other icing signals
tasks that are running on in parallel

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919
tasks that are running on in parallel
 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.130
tasks that are running on in parallel
this is telling you another interesting

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140
this is telling you another interesting
 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.450
this is telling you another interesting
formation you do have a render thread

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460
formation you do have a render thread
 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.980
formation you do have a render thread
that you separate from the main thread

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:36.990
that you separate from the main thread
 

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:40.190
that you separate from the main thread
good job something that generally you

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200
good job something that generally you
 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:46.530
good job something that generally you
want to do

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540
 
 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.230
 
now let's look at this trace you can see

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240
now let's look at this trace you can see
 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.770
now let's look at this trace you can see
that playing bitmaps there's this

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780
that playing bitmaps there's this
 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.060
that playing bitmaps there's this
particular friend is using a lot of CPU

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070
particular friend is using a lot of CPU
 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.670
particular friend is using a lot of CPU
fine that's alright but you can also see

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680
fine that's alright but you can also see
 

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.140
fine that's alright but you can also see
that it's jumping from one chord to the

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150
that it's jumping from one chord to the
 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.280
that it's jumping from one chord to the
other it's being scheduled on different

now let's imagine you're already hitting

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:05.600
now let's imagine you're already hitting
 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.540
now let's imagine you're already hitting
your framerate so you're good for the

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:07.550
your framerate so you're good for the
 

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.590
your framerate so you're good for the
framerate this information could be used

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:11.600
framerate this information could be used
 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.290
framerate this information could be used
to say okay let's try to to set affinity

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:14.300
to say okay let's try to to set affinity
 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.700
to say okay let's try to to set affinity
for this thread to as low core and let's

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710
for this thread to as low core and let's

put it on a fast cord let's see if we

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670
put it on a fast cord let's see if we
 

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.550
put it on a fast cord let's see if we
can save some battery there this way

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560
can save some battery there this way
 

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.820
can save some battery there this way

instead of just jumping around but the

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:32.870
instead of just jumping around but the
 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.170
instead of just jumping around but the
takeaway that I want from this is you
