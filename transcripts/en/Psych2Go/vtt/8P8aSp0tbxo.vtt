[Music]

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:11.680
If I had to count how many people
Iâ€™ve crushed on throughout my 25 years,

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.580
I think I'd run out of hands before I reached
my high school years.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:20.890
I wasn't necessarily boy crazy but it didn't
always take a lot for me to start developing

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:21.890
feelings.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.000
A kind gesture or a zany personality was sometimes
enough to get my heart fluttering.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.960
When I was in my preteen and early teenage
years, I had a thing for funny boys.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.260
Maybe it's because during that time in my
life, I was easily bogged down by the realities

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.220
of keeping up with school that I left little
to no time to address my true feelings of

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.260
[?], frustration and loss.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.370
I always felt like I had to mature fast and
the only three things that made me feel young

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.109
were Disney Channel, pop music and the boys
I crushed on.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.350
In elementary and middle school, I developed
feelings for the class clowns.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:02.719
I admired their natural ability to charm people
with their easygoing funny remarks.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.260
It didn't matter how bad my day was going,
the minute we'd step into class, I'd forget

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.980
all about my troubles.

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:11.990
In eighth grade, I developed the biggest crush
on...

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.509
Let's call him Stanley.

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.720
Stanley moved to my school, so he was the
new student.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.340
He also happened to ride on the same school
bus.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.370
At first, I didn't think much of him.

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.000
I remember feeling slightly annoyed actually.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.560
My bus held a lot of students already, so
when he and his brother joined us too, I knew

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.030
I was doomed to sit on the edge of my seat
for the rest of the year.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.149
On his first day riding the bus to attend
my school, I decided to sit next to him and

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:40.039
this other boy in my grade.

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.759
He was quiet and we didn't talk at all.

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:45.000
Over time though, he became a riot.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.299
One day he got up and started singing on the
bus.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.490
The bus driver was mad and told him to sit
down.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:57.009
Eventually he did but that didn't stop him
from having a good time the rest of the ride.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.770
He was a bass player and had strong aspirations
to be in a band which is actually what he's

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.619
doing nowadays, living the dream, right?

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.720
I never really interacted much with him though,
I liked him from afar.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.759
Yeah, creepy, right?

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.710
But hey, no shame in that, we all have stories like
that.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.140
He was highly unpredictable and I guess with
my uneventful life at the time, it was easy

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.440
for me to develop feelings for him.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.310
Energetic, passionate and adventurous, he
didn't care so much about school but knew

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.510
how to live life to the fullest.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.480
In a lot of ways, he taught me a lot just
from my observations.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.840
When you want something, even if it's different
from the usual norms, you should go for it

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.420
without feeling apologetic about it.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.250
Teachers would often get frustrated with his
rambunctious behavior but underneath his wild

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.610
exterior was a kind heart.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:52.220
Like I said earlier, my bus was always jam-packed
with kids, so I started getting into the habit

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.260
of sitting next to this boy who always sat
alone.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.940
I guess he was super greedy about his space
while everyone else suffered sitting sometimes

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.840
three people to a seat.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.000
So he expressed his annoyance with me; "it's
the third time this week you've asked me to

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
move over", he scowled.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.060
Stanley, sitting behind us saw the whole thing
happen and stood up for me; "no one wants to

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.410
sit next to you anyway", he said.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.060
I never did say thank you for that moment,
I was too shy at the time.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.861
Inspired by his bold character that one day,
I finally mustered the courage to tell him

00:03:24.861 --> 00:03:25.861
how I felt.

00:03:25.861 --> 00:03:29.580
I did it on eighth grade graduation day actually,
over Myspace.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.850
To all my Myspacers, remember those days?

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.600
I felt so cheesy but I messaged him, keeping
things short and simple.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.560
Even though my mind's racing thoughts couldn't
have been more than the opposite.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.950
He was nice about it but timing didn't work
in my favor.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.800
He typed back, "thank you for telling me,
you seem really cool but unfortunately, I'm

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.570
moving this summer".

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.170
I was crushed.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.950
All that time developing quiet secret feelings
for him, I could have talked to him more and

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.850
I felt so stupid for realizing that too late,
we could have been friends or maybe we could

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:06.840
have grown to become enemies, who knows.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.260
The funny thing is, when I was a lot younger,
I wasn't so self-conscious.

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.540
If I liked someone, I usually let them know
but man, middle school years were rough on

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.540
me.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:22.570
This moment always reminds me to take risks
because without taking scary leaps, I wouldn't

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.940
have met my current boyfriend.

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:28.379
Rejections are part of being honest and forward.

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.470
Timing might sometimes be off but the important
thing is to persevere.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.550
You never know who you're going to meet or
where you're going to meet them, whether it's

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.840
through school, a mutual friend or OKCupid.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.490
Do yourself a favor and start recognizing
things will get messy but that should never

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.530
be an excuse to not try.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.150
You'll thank yourself in the long run when
you look back.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:54.150
When was the last time you confessed to your
crush and how did it turn out?
