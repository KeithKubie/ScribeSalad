00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Antarctica, home to the south pole(s),

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.040
penguins, and about 5000 people during the summers,

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.280
but less than 1000 during the ever dark winter.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.940
No one lives on the continent permanently,

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.700
so, who owns Antarctica?

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.640
Most stuff outside national borders, the sea floor, the moon,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.100
really all of space, is the common heritage of mankind.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.340
It belongs to none of us and all of us, held in trust for future generations.

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.160
Which is nice, if perhaps a bit presumptive

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.220
to say that the entire universe is ours,

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.540
and maybe someone will have something to say about that eventually,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.860
story for another time, but still.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.220
Well done humanity.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.380
Except, it's never that simple.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.780
Because the paperwork on Antarctica sort of says common heritage of mankind,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.960
but it doesn't go all in.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.160
Here's why. Explorers started landing

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.260
in Antarctica in about the 1800's, planting flags

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.240
and making claims. But these claims were a bit hollow

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.860
because on the civilization tech tree, Antarctica

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.240
wasn't colonizable. Nonetheless, like Monopoly,

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.480
the optimal colonial strategy is claim everything you land on.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.500
In the early 1900's, the UK toyed with claiming all of

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.920
Antarctica before scaling back her ambitions to just

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.820
the coastal parts she had explored to the south pole.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.860
France also claimed coastal explorations to the pole,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.340
followed by Norway followed by the Nazis.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.880
Mid-century, Argentina and Chile claimed slices overlapping

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.920
with the UK, who they figured was rather too busy

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.980
at the time to care, but later she and her now

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.120
independent colonies totally did. This left

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.980
Antarctica a mess of competing claims, at a bad time

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.360
to have large territorial disputes. Complicating things,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.380
the United States and the Soviet Union gave

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.260
themselves the right to make a claim on

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.820
Antarctica, not now, but maybe later.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.360
Given this, quite remarkably in 1959 the US and USSR

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.700
and ten other countries, Argentina, Australia, Belgium,

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.280
Chile, France, Japan, New Zealand, Norway,

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.200
South Africa, and the UK made a treaty to ease the tensions,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.240
saying that on Antarctica, there would be

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.620
no military, no mining, and no nuclear exploding.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.820
The Antarctican paperwork is the first Cold War

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.400
disarmament treaty, and set aside the continent

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.000
for science and nature.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.040
By the way, because it's a nature preserve,

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.560
there's a rule about garbage. Leave nothing behind.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.600
Nothing. Travel to Antarctica in the summer and you'll

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.580
fly back with your poo in the winter.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:17.800
So this looks pretty great. What's the problem

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.280
with the line about common heritage?

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.040
Well, no one actually gave up their claims on Antarctica

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.740
because the only way to get everyone to sign was to

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.440
include this clause, which sidesteps the issue,

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.940
basically saying countries will act as though Antarctica

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.740
is the common heritage of mankind and as though

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.820
they have no claims, but  they aren't legally for realsies

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.800
giving up anything, which is why maps of Antarctica

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.080
often include the current state of claim wedges.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.640
This blank spot, by the way, is nobody's, leaving it

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.400
the largest territory unclaimed on Earth by any nation.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.100
So far, anyway.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.420
Now unlike the colonial days, countries have the tech

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.100
to build permanently staffed bases on Antarctica, and

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.540
it just so happens that countries build their bases

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.380
in their own claims, leaving no clear answer to this question.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.220
According to the treaty, Antarctica belongs to everyone,

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.820
but the treaty itself has an intentional hole.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.240
So Antarctica exists in this quantum state where

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:19.260
the claims are real and unreal. Some countries build

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
within their "borders" and some countries without claims,

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.020
like China, build their bases on the continent wherever

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.980
because it belongs to everyone, right guys?

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.900
These claims don't really matter, until they do in the

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:36.260
2040's when the mining ban comes up for review.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.100
Oh, and there's possibly a lot of oil in Antarctica, not to

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.260
mention 70% of the Earth's fresh water, which could be

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:46.440
the more valuable resource in the future. The US and

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.300
the Soviet... er, Russia might just yet dust off those one

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.700
free claim because I say so tickets. But for now,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.220
Antarctica is as the treaty intended. A continental

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.500
nature preserve and scientific research haven.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.740
Squarespace is the easiest way to create a beautiful

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.480
