00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.080
- [Voiceover] In the
last video, we worked out

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:05.280
the step response of an RC circuit,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.820
and now we're gonna
look at a real example.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.400
So, this is our answer,
this is the step response,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.700
the total response to our
circuit, to a step input.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.960
And what does this look like?

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.480
Well, I'm gonna move down a little bit.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.860
We'll make up a circuit and
we'll do a real example here.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.240
Let's say we do a step,

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.340
and the step goes from .2 volts

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.040
up to, say 1.1 volts.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.840
And let's let R equal one K, ohm.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.120
K, ohm.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.220
And let the capacitor
equal four microfarads.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.500
So now let's plug these values
over here into our solution

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.680
and see what we get.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.860
Now, first I'm gonna work out RC.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.660
RC is equal to one K, ohm

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.980
times four microfarads.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.520
And what does that equal?

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.340
K is plus three.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.240
And micro is minus six.

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.000
So one times four is four.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.860
And plus three minus six is times

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.160
10 to the minus three.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.040
And that is in seconds,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.680
so that's equal to four milliseconds.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.016
Now, let's plug the rest
of our values in here.

00:01:48.016 --> 00:01:49.500
V of T.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.760
The total response, or the step response

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.880
equals v naught, .2,

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.360
minus V, S, that's the step voltage, 1.1,

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.240
times e to the minus t

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.380
over four milliseconds

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.336
plus V, S.

00:02:17.336 --> 00:02:19.700
V, S is 1.1.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.180
So I went ahead and I plotted this

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.460
using a computer, and we'll
see how close this comes

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.040
to what we sketched earlier.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.760
So here's V, T.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.140
Or, the step response, the total response

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.884
of our RC network to a step voltage.

00:02:46.884 --> 00:02:49.980
The step voltage is here in rose color.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.024
And it goes from .2 volts up to,

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:56.654
ooh, I got it wrong.

00:02:56.654 --> 00:02:59.940
1.2 volts, let's change
that to the right number.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.560
1.2, 1.2.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:06.880
And this is what it looks like.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.980
And if you go back and
compare this to what we saw,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.580
what we sketched at the beginning,

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:12.080
it'll look pretty similar.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.040
So, the output voltage, the
voltage on the capacitor here,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.046
starts at V naught, which is .2,

00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:27.560
it ends up at V, S, which
is 1.2 in this case,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.500
and that's the forced response up here.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.240
And in between, it did that
smooth exponential curve.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.640
That's what the step response
of an RC circuit looks like.
