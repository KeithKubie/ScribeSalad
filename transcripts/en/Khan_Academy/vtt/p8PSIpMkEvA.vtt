00:00:00.363 --> 00:00:01.538
Voiceover: What i want to do in this video

00:00:01.538 --> 00:00:02.772
is dig a little bit deeper

00:00:02.772 --> 00:00:04.270
in this marginal product revenue curve,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.938
and really make sure we understand

00:00:05.938 --> 00:00:07.009
what it's telling us,

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:08.899
that it really is the
marginal benefit curve

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:10.407
for this firm.

00:00:10.407 --> 00:00:13.995
In the video we constructed,
this firm is a car wash.

00:00:13.995 --> 00:00:16.337
Also, how we can use this to think about

00:00:16.337 --> 00:00:18.361
what's a rational number of people

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:20.492
for this firm to hire?

00:00:20.492 --> 00:00:23.009
Just as a reminder, this
horizontal axis here,

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.571
this is a quantity of labor per hour,

00:00:25.571 --> 00:00:28.079
so this is people per hour

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:29.069
that are working at the firm.

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:31.338
People per hour.

00:00:31.338 --> 00:00:33.212
And the vertical axis here,

00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:35.383
the marginal product revenue,

00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:36.492
that you could view as

00:00:36.492 --> 00:00:37.936
the marginal dollars,

00:00:37.936 --> 00:00:40.408
or the incremental dollars
that you're getting

00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:42.337
per person, per hour.

00:00:42.337 --> 00:00:46.673
Per person, per hour,

00:00:46.673 --> 00:00:48.875
per hour.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.412
And to just verify that it's
telling us the same thing

00:00:51.412 --> 00:00:54.516
visually that this table
told us right up here,

00:00:54.516 --> 00:00:56.784
we can think about what is the marginal,

00:00:56.784 --> 00:00:59.106
how much incremental revenue do we get

00:00:59.106 --> 00:01:01.169
from hiring that 1st person.

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:03.832
What we could do is we
could multiply the quantity

00:01:03.832 --> 00:01:04.754
of people,

00:01:04.754 --> 00:01:05.757
which is 1,

00:01:05.757 --> 00:01:07.847
times the average,

00:01:07.847 --> 00:01:10.475
times the average increment,

00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:13.093
the average marginal product revenue

00:01:13.093 --> 00:01:15.140
that we get from 1 person,

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.139
or I should say, the average we get

00:01:17.139 --> 00:01:19.498
going from 0 to 1 person,

00:01:19.498 --> 00:01:22.048
and the average is 25.

00:01:22.048 --> 00:01:24.477
The average is 25.

00:01:24.477 --> 00:01:26.384
The reason why I said it that way,

00:01:26.384 --> 00:01:27.839
is you could imagine a reality

00:01:27.839 --> 00:01:29.862
where getting a tenth of a person,

00:01:29.862 --> 00:01:31.969
you get a value higher than 25.

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:32.382
You might say,

00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:33.539
how do I get a tenth of a person?

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:36.386
Well, what if one person
shows up every ten days?

00:01:36.386 --> 00:01:38.938
Then you get a little less
benefit as you get closer

00:01:38.938 --> 00:01:41.270
and closer to a whole person per hour.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.109
But on average, as we
go from 0 to 1 person,

00:01:44.693 --> 00:01:48.081
we are getting $25 of value,

00:01:48.081 --> 00:01:53.268
or $25 of marginal revenue
per person per hour.

00:01:53.268 --> 00:01:55.221
So if you wanted to figure
out what's the total

00:01:55.221 --> 00:01:58.666
marginal revenue that
we got from this person

00:01:58.666 --> 00:01:59.268
right over here,

00:01:59.268 --> 00:02:00.886
the total incremental revenue

00:02:00.886 --> 00:02:02.835
that this is allowing us to get,

00:02:02.835 --> 00:02:04.670
well, it's the one person

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.765
times the average
marginal product revenue,

00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:09.181
which is 25,

00:02:09.181 --> 00:02:11.549
so that would give us the
area of this rectangle

00:02:11.549 --> 00:02:12.269
right over there,

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.229
which would be $25.

00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:16.662
Now, and you would really have to do

00:02:16.662 --> 00:02:18.914
a little bit of calculus
to fully appreciate it,

00:02:18.914 --> 00:02:20.337
but I think you can look
at it geometrically,

00:02:20.337 --> 00:02:21.812
that also happens to be,

00:02:21.812 --> 00:02:23.090
given that this is a line,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.083
that our curve,

00:02:24.083 --> 00:02:25.664
our marginal product revenue

00:02:25.664 --> 00:02:27.633
is a line right over here,

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:29.671
that the area under this rectangle

00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:31.368
is going to be the same thing as the area

00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:33.152
under the orange curve.

00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:34.151
The orange curve,

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:38.800
between 0 and ½ is above this rectangle

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.216
and between ½ and one,

00:02:40.216 --> 00:02:41.836
it is below the rectangle.

00:02:41.836 --> 00:02:44.655
The area above is the
same as the area below.

00:02:44.655 --> 00:02:47.873
So $25 is also the area,

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.510
is also the area under this curve.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.016
That's essentially how much benefit

00:02:54.016 --> 00:02:55.656
the firm is getting from hiring,

00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:57.962
from going from 0 to 1 person.

00:02:57.962 --> 00:03:00.644
They're getting $25 of benefit.

00:03:00.996 --> 00:03:02.087
Now, how much benefit do they get

00:03:02.087 --> 00:03:04.139
going from 1 to 2 people?

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:05.840
Well, going from 1 to 2,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:09.848
our change in quantity
of people per hour is 1,

00:03:09.848 --> 00:03:12.632
and then our average
marginal product revenue

00:03:13.032 --> 00:03:16.142
going from 1 to 2 people is $20.

00:03:16.757 --> 00:03:20.538
So, it is $20, and so
the area is 1 times 20,

00:03:20.538 --> 00:03:21.666
and that's also going to be the same

00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:23.766
as the area under the curve.

00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:25.765
So the area under the
curve right over there

00:03:25.765 --> 00:03:27.853
is going to be 20.

00:03:27.853 --> 00:03:29.878
Likewise, the area under the curve,

00:03:29.878 --> 00:03:31.103
if we want to say how much ...

00:03:31.103 --> 00:03:33.284
What's the marginal product revenue we get

00:03:33.284 --> 00:03:34.587
going from 2 to 3 people?

00:03:34.587 --> 00:03:36.350
Well, the average height here,

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:37.266
we'd essentially just say,

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:40.096
"What is the area between 2 and 3?"

00:03:40.096 --> 00:03:41.552
And we can figure out that area

00:03:41.552 --> 00:03:43.178
by saying, "Well the average height,

00:03:43.178 --> 00:03:45.141
The average height is 15.

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:47.666
Multiply 15, so this height,

00:03:47.666 --> 00:03:48.468
the average height is 15.

00:03:48.468 --> 00:03:50.189
Multiply 15 times 1.

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:52.075
You get $15,

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:53.945
$15 of benefit.

00:03:53.945 --> 00:03:57.269
Between 3 and 4, the average height is 10.

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.767
The average height is 10,
so you get 10 times 1.

00:04:00.767 --> 00:04:02.565
You get $10 of benefit,

00:04:02.565 --> 00:04:05.306
would be the area under
the curve right over here.

00:04:05.306 --> 00:04:06.670
$10 of benefit.

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:07.755
Then the area under the curve there,

00:04:07.755 --> 00:04:10.807
by the same argument, is $5.

00:04:10.807 --> 00:04:13.159
Is $5 of benefit.

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.280
Now, we've ...

00:04:14.803 --> 00:04:16.676
Given this, this is just
telling us the revenue

00:04:16.676 --> 00:04:17.332
we're getting,

00:04:17.332 --> 00:04:18.504
but it's really not telling us,

00:04:18.504 --> 00:04:19.850
it's really not telling us

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.171
what is the optimal,

00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:23.418
or the rational number
of employees to hire?

00:04:23.418 --> 00:04:24.004
To do that,

00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:25.689
we have to think about
the cost per employee,

00:04:25.689 --> 00:04:29.031
the marginal cost that we
are actually incurring.

00:04:29.031 --> 00:04:31.520
I mentioned earlier that
this is a competitive firm.

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:33.167
When I mentioned it before,

00:04:33.167 --> 00:04:34.798
I talked about it being competitive

00:04:34.798 --> 00:04:37.050
in terms of the car wash market,

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:39.229
so it was a competitive supplier,

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:42.083
but let's assume that it
is also a competitive buyer

00:04:42.083 --> 00:04:43.268
in the labor market,

00:04:43.268 --> 00:04:44.402
so these are two different,

00:04:44.402 --> 00:04:45.824
these are two different markets,

00:04:45.824 --> 00:04:47.165
and I want to clarify.

00:04:47.165 --> 00:04:48.233
In the car wash market,

00:04:48.233 --> 00:04:49.812
in the car wash market,

00:04:49.812 --> 00:04:51.189
we are competitive,

00:04:51.589 --> 00:04:53.480
we are a competitive supplier,

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.141
or I guess we could say
are a seller of car washes.

00:04:56.141 --> 00:04:57.656
In the labor market,

00:04:57.656 --> 00:04:58.816
in the labor market,

00:04:58.816 --> 00:05:00.497
our firm is a competitive,

00:05:00.943 --> 00:05:04.109
is a competitve buyer.

00:05:04.109 --> 00:05:06.163
Now, I'll do a little
bit of an aside here,

00:05:06.163 --> 00:05:09.506
because when we talk about suppliers,

00:05:09.506 --> 00:05:11.066
there's the competitive suppliers,

00:05:11.066 --> 00:05:12.736
where there's many undifferentiated people

00:05:12.736 --> 00:05:15.012
who are supplying some
type of good or service

00:05:15.012 --> 00:05:18.013
and the opposite of that was a monopoly,

00:05:18.382 --> 00:05:19.885
so a non-competitive,

00:05:20.531 --> 00:05:22.475
non-competitive.

00:05:23.336 --> 00:05:25.667
As a seller, we call that a monopoly.

00:05:26.143 --> 00:05:29.331
If we had a non-competitive buyer,

00:05:29.331 --> 00:05:32.237
so if you had many sellers
but only one big buyer

00:05:32.237 --> 00:05:33.673
that could have a lot of market influence,

00:05:33.673 --> 00:05:35.665
and we haven't done a
deep analysis of that yet,

00:05:36.065 --> 00:05:37.471
that word, just so you know it,

00:05:37.871 --> 00:05:40.327
and you're not taken by
surprise if someone says it,

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.408
it means monopsony,

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:44.446
or the word is monopsony.

00:05:45.122 --> 00:05:46.048
Monopsony.

00:05:46.048 --> 00:05:47.153
Not relevant to this video.

00:05:47.553 --> 00:05:49.375
We are the opposite of a monopsony

00:05:49.375 --> 00:05:50.563
in the labor market.

00:05:51.025 --> 00:05:52.744
We are assuming that we
are a competitive buyer.

00:05:52.744 --> 00:05:53.710
There are many, many, many, many,

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:54.896
many buyers here,

00:05:54.896 --> 00:05:57.070
so we essentially just have
to take the market wages,

00:05:57.070 --> 00:05:59.150
and we are also the opposite of a monopoly

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:00.869
in the car wash market.

00:06:00.869 --> 00:06:02.481
We're assuming that we are one of many

00:06:02.481 --> 00:06:03.185
competitive sellers.

00:06:03.185 --> 00:06:05.678
Monopoly means only one seller,

00:06:05.678 --> 00:06:09.192
monopsony means one powerful buyer.

00:06:09.192 --> 00:06:10.601
The whole reason why I'm saying

00:06:10.601 --> 00:06:12.393
that we are competitive
in the labor market

00:06:12.393 --> 00:06:13.633
is I'm assuming that we're
just going to have to

00:06:13.633 --> 00:06:15.493
take the market wages,

00:06:15.493 --> 00:06:18.258
so the market wage for the
type of labor we're hiring,

00:06:18.258 --> 00:06:19.376
so the market wage,

00:06:19.376 --> 00:06:20.751
and we're just going to have to take that.

00:06:20.751 --> 00:06:23.381
The market wage is going to be,

00:06:23.381 --> 00:06:25.321
let's just say it is $10 per hour.

00:06:25.321 --> 00:06:26.936
$10 per hour.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.291
Given that, what is a rational number

00:06:29.291 --> 00:06:30.948
of people to hire?

00:06:31.378 --> 00:06:33.081
Well, that 1st person we hire,

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.140
we're getting $25 of benefit.

00:06:35.555 --> 00:06:37.291
The marginal cost of them,

00:06:37.291 --> 00:06:39.132
and we can actually draw
a marginal cost curve.

00:06:39.132 --> 00:06:41.357
The marginal cost curve
will just be flat right here

00:06:41.357 --> 00:06:43.006
at $25.

00:06:43.006 --> 00:06:45.943
It'll just be, sorry,
it'll be flat here at $10.

00:06:45.943 --> 00:06:47.395
That's how much it costs us.

00:06:47.395 --> 00:06:48.542
If we hire one person,

00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:50.757
it costs us, the area would be $10.

00:06:50.757 --> 00:06:52.039
If we hire 2 people,

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:54.381
the area would be between 0 and 2,

00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:55.253
and under the curve,

00:06:55.253 --> 00:06:56.192
which would be 20,

00:06:56.192 --> 00:06:57.396
or you could say the increment

00:06:57.396 --> 00:07:00.508
from going from 1 to 2
people is another $10,

00:07:00.508 --> 00:07:01.810
or going from 2 to 3 people,

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.226
this area right over here is another $10.

00:07:05.226 --> 00:07:06.700
If you go from 3 to 4 people,

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:09.196
this area under here is another $10,

00:07:09.196 --> 00:07:10.865
under this green curve.

00:07:11.342 --> 00:07:12.802
Does it make sense to
hire that 1st person?

00:07:12.802 --> 00:07:15.104
Sure, you're going to get $25 in revenue,

00:07:15.104 --> 00:07:16.879
and you're going to have $10 in wages,

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:19.091
so you're going to have $15 of benefit.

00:07:19.091 --> 00:07:20.960
You definitely want to hire one person.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:23.166
Does it make sense to
hire that 2nd person?

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:26.139
Well, the marginal product revenue

00:07:26.139 --> 00:07:28.122
is going to be $20 from that 2nd person.

00:07:28.491 --> 00:07:30.999
Your marginal cost from
that 2nd person is $10,

00:07:30.999 --> 00:07:33.674
so you're going to make
$10 on that 2nd person,

00:07:33.674 --> 00:07:35.138
so you should hire that 2nd person.

00:07:35.738 --> 00:07:38.477
The 3rd person, you're
going to make $15 off them,

00:07:38.477 --> 00:07:40.791
they're going to cost you $10 dollars,

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:42.022
so you're going to,

00:07:42.022 --> 00:07:43.296
and this is all on a per-hour basis.

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.392
You're going to make $5,

00:07:44.392 --> 00:07:45.410
so you should hire that.

00:07:45.886 --> 00:07:47.121
The 4th person,

00:07:47.412 --> 00:07:48.661
well, now it's interesting.

00:07:48.661 --> 00:07:53.047
The 4th person, you're
going to make $10 in total

00:07:53.047 --> 00:07:54.133
off of the 4th person,

00:07:54.501 --> 00:07:55.506
but you're not,

00:07:55.506 --> 00:07:57.302
but you're also going to have to pay $10

00:07:57.302 --> 00:07:58.624
for that 4th person,

00:07:58.624 --> 00:07:59.966
so it doesn't make sense for you to hire

00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:02.301
another total 4th person.

00:08:02.562 --> 00:08:03.490
Now, if you could,

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.414
it could make sense for you to hire

00:08:05.414 --> 00:08:06.902
another half person,

00:08:06.902 --> 00:08:09.282
maybe someone who shows
up every other day,

00:08:09.282 --> 00:08:10.398
if this still holds,

00:08:10.398 --> 00:08:13.096
or maybe someone who
shows up for half an hour,

00:08:13.096 --> 00:08:15.414
or maybe someone who is doing this job

00:08:15.414 --> 00:08:17.289
and also operating the cash register,

00:08:17.289 --> 00:08:19.027
and they're kind of going in between.

00:08:19.243 --> 00:08:20.677
Because for a half-person,

00:08:20.677 --> 00:08:21.970
it does make sense.

00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:24.547
A half-person is going to cost $5,

00:08:24.547 --> 00:08:26.917
and their marginal benefit is going to be

00:08:26.917 --> 00:08:29.498
the area under the
curve between this point

00:08:29.498 --> 00:08:30.210
and this point,

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:30.984
and so we get,

00:08:30.984 --> 00:08:33.093
so the profit from that person,

00:08:33.093 --> 00:08:35.429
the net benefit we're going to get

00:08:35.429 --> 00:08:37.239
is going to be this area right over here.

00:08:37.239 --> 00:08:39.194
It would be rational to get them.

00:08:39.194 --> 00:08:40.497
But what you're seeing is,

00:08:40.497 --> 00:08:43.092
is it makes sense to keep increasing

00:08:43.092 --> 00:08:44.713
the quantity demanded.

00:08:44.974 --> 00:08:48.080
It makes sense to keep
hiring more and more people

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.758
until the marginal benefit,

00:08:49.758 --> 00:08:50.616
or another way of saying,

00:08:50.616 --> 00:08:52.531
the marginal product revenue curve

00:08:52.531 --> 00:08:54.933
is equal to the marginal cost curve.

00:08:54.933 --> 00:08:56.824
After that point, the person's costs

00:08:56.824 --> 00:08:58.614
are higher than their benefits,

00:08:58.614 --> 00:09:01.000
and you wouldn't want to hire them.
