[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.225 --> 00:00:10.600
FERNANDA VIEGAS: I have a lot
of stuff to show you today.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.440
I'm going to show
you some live demos.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.350
Living dangerously, but
that's the way I like it.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.100
And I thought I would
start by telling you

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.340
a little bit about who I
am and where I come from.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.970
As [? Annalee ?] said, I co-lead
a research team here at Google.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.000
And our mandate is to do data
visualization for end users,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.210
so turning very complex data
into really interesting images

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.520
that people hopefully
can understand

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.550
without too much hand-holding,
making complex data

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.310
very legible and digestible.

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:49.580
And you know, I work at
Google, but the truth

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.480
is I am a very
unlikely technologist.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.890
Nothing in my past
would ever tell you

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.090
that I would end up
here, or doing what I do.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.090
As [? Annalee ?] said,
that's where I come from.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.030
I grew up in Rio.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.180
Ended up coming to Kansas.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.260
I did not know about the
flat lands in the US,

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.720
or anything like that.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.730
But I loved it anyway.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.620
And my background is graphic
design and art history,

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.800
very traditional graphic
design and art history.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.950
I had never, ever
touched programming ever

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:23.840
in my entire life.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.530
I had no interest
in it, actually.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.970
I loved things that were visual.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.460
So this was like a poster I
did, and a book cover I did.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.670
But then when I was
about to graduate,

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.580
I decided I love visual things,
but it started feeling a little

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.250
limiting for me.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.700
And so that's when I
learned about a place

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.520
called the Media Lab,
where they welcomed people

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.120
with different backgrounds.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.450
And so that's when I started
thinking, oh, maybe I

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.090
should start picking up
programming, this thing

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.300
that people talk about.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.520
And so anyway, ended up doing
a lot of data visualization.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.740
And data visualization
is nothing more

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.010
than turning data
like this, raw data,

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.520
into pictures that hopefully
tell stories and bring together

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:14.910
so many numbers in a
way that your mind,

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.310
that you work with your
visual system to digest.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.520
This is what data
visualization used to be.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.020
So when I started
in the field, this

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.610
is what visualization
used to be.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.090
It was very scientific, and it
was very, very male-dominated.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.871
And it was sort of like serious
technology for serious people,

00:02:34.871 --> 00:02:35.370
you know?

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.390
Only experts.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.690
Also because it was hard.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.480
It was expensive to be able
to run graphics of any kind.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.680
Thankfully, this is very
different now, right?

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.880
So now, you have all
sorts of different kinds

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.390
of visualization projects.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.200
You have visualizations
that are artistic.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.580
You have visualizations
that are journalistic.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.730
You have entire reports that are
done through data visualization

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:02.950
and infographics.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.400
You have visualization
being used for activism.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.960
And I am very
interested in this arc,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.360
in this change that goes from a
very sort of serious discipline

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.170
that's very limited to
something that becomes more

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.170
of a mainstream communication
media welcoming people

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.490
to the world of data.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.220
That's one of the things that I
love about data visualization,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.070
is that it can be sort of
like a gateway to statistics,

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.360
like a gateway drug
to statistics, right?

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.410
You're doing statistics
without having

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.660
to have a degree, without having
to learn about distributions

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.840
and such.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.330
So I'm going to
start by showing you

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.140
one of my favorite projects.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.280
And this was done before
I even came to Google.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.060
So it's called the web seer.

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.520
And-- oh, and one little note.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.930
All the work I'm going
to show here today,

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.550
it's work that I
didn't do by myself.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.970
It's work that I did with my
partner, Martin Wattenberg.

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.970
We've been working together
for, like, 10 years.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:08.150
And so when you hear
we, that's what I mean,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.240
it's me and Martin.

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:10.690
And my team also.

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.620
But this was done
way before Google.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.180
Before we joined Google.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.579
We started noticing that the
Google Instant, right, you

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.730
start typing things
into Google, and it

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:21.769
starts giving you suggestions.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:24.880
Any clue about why
Google does that?

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.658
Why does Google give
you suggestions?

00:04:27.658 --> 00:04:29.830
AUDIENCE: So you have a
better search [INAUDIBLE].

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.163
FERNANDA VIEGAS: So you have
a better search experience,

00:04:32.163 --> 00:04:34.790
because it's faster, because,
you know, maybe this way

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.260
you don't have to waste
time typing everything.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.120
And these suggestions are
the most popular things,

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.330
the most popular
queries that people

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:49.570
have come to Google with given
the beginning of your string.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.390
So if you say why, well,
these are the things

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.870
that people usually
ask Google about why.

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:01.870
So I want to actually do
one little thing here.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.790
I'm going to show
you a visualization

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.780
of the same kind of data.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.890
So now, I'm going to say why.

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.520
And I'm visualizing
the same data, OK?

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.150
But I'm going to
say why doesn't he.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.774
And you can see that I'm
showing the same information

00:05:23.774 --> 00:05:25.940
that Google is showing you,
but I'm also showing you

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.660
a sense of priorities.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.920
OK, so why doesn't he like
me is the top thing that

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:33.650
comes after why doesn't he.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.400
But now I want to
do another thing.

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.310
I want to combine that
query with another one.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:44.200
I want to compare and
say why doesn't she.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.910
And now the visualization
is showing me

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.350
where these two come together,
and where they break apart,

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.850
right?

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:53.140
So why doesn't he or she
love me or like me or text

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.890
me first is interesting.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:06:02.360
But why doesn't she just
leave is only for shes.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.625
So you know, you start to get
a sense of interesting things.

00:06:07.625 --> 00:06:08.750
And you can play with this.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.041
This is a public visualization.

00:06:10.041 --> 00:06:11.282
You can play with this.

00:06:11.282 --> 00:06:20.060
You know, is chocolate--
chocolate-- versus is coffee.

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.760
And you can start
to see what people

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.290
are worried about, right?

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.370
But then you can get
to more serious things,

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:33.710
like is my son versus
is my daughter.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:42.650
And you can-- you get a sense
of people's vulnerabilities,

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.770
right, of parents
coming to Google

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:46.360
and actually asking
these questions.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.560
And this is something
that I love about data,

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:54.140
is that data can be seen as
something so cold and removed,

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.730
but when you look at a
picture like this, it's not.

00:06:56.730 --> 00:06:57.820
It's like, oh my god.

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:59.780
It just hits you, right?

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.500
The good news is that if you
turn that from a question--

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.120
is my son versus is my
daughter-- to an affirmative--

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:15.110
my son is versus
my daughter is--

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:21.110
the best and awesome is
still some of the top things

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:22.620
you get there.

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.400
So again, this is
just to give you

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:26.360
a sense of the kind
of visualization

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.190
I'm interested in.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.200
I'm interested in visualization
that resonates culturally

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.390
with people, and sort of takes
you out of that notion of,

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:38.280
oh, you know, data
is something boring.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.040
I want to show you
another visualization.

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.210
This is something that
we did here at Google.

00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:47.250
And this is a map, a real-time
map of the top viral YouTube

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:50.600
videos in the US right now.

00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.200
And I'm showing you
what-- and it's by region.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.790
So let's look at Boston.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:08:00.230
This is a region for Boston and
Manchester in New Hampshire.

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:03.240
So this, you know,
do it yourself

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.380
ORBEEZ SLIME video is the
top one that people care

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:11.140
about right now in our region.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.920
But the top one is
this video game one.

00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.470
I'm going to break it down
by interesting demographics.

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:19.950
So let's look at what
males are looking at.

00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:22.900
Oh, this is 13- to
17-year-olds, OK?

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.310
All right.

00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:26.850
It's going to get better.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:28.330
I promise.

00:08:28.330 --> 00:08:31.410
So males are looking at this.

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.960
Female youngsters are
looking at the ones

00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.090
that the Bostonians
like the most.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:43.980
But as I go over
older demographics,

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:45.640
it changes completely, right?

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.930
So this is what older ladies are
looking at, "Little Big Shots"

00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:54.920
Sassy Viral Dancer video.

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.600
And males are all looking
at this Trump supporter

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:04.040
punching a protester
in the face.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.290
There's other things,
too, that are very local.

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:09.150
So like this video
here about flooding.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.310
Another one also about flooding.

00:09:11.310 --> 00:09:12.890
Very local.

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:17.100
So this map changes every day.

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.460
It's live data.

00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:21.690
And you can see things that
sweep the nation, which

00:09:21.690 --> 00:09:23.350
is really interesting to me.

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:25.070
So let me just go back
to my presentation

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:27.491
here, and let me do this.

00:09:27.491 --> 00:09:27.990
OK.

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:29.530
So I just wanted
to call attention

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.070
to a couple of
historical screenshots.

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.710
So this was last year,
or a year and a half

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:44.460
ago, I forget, when males were
looking at the "Men of Steel"

00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:45.930
movie trailer.

00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:48.680
And then-- whoops-- and
then females on the same day

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.800
were looking at the Dove
"Real Beauty" commercial.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.305
Does anyone-- has
anyone seen that?

00:09:53.305 --> 00:09:53.805
Yeah.

00:09:53.805 --> 00:09:54.801
Yeah, right?

00:09:54.801 --> 00:09:55.300
Me, too.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.330
When this was happening,
I was like, oh yeah,

00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:58.790
I'm part of the demographic.

00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.310
Yeah, I get it.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.630
Yeah, that's true.

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:07.510
And then you have things like
these, that you can't make up.

00:10:07.510 --> 00:10:09.920
Grandma smoking weed
for the first time.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:13.582
And it just, like, sweeps
the country, right?

00:10:13.582 --> 00:10:14.290
And it's awesome.

00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:15.432
I watched the video.

00:10:15.432 --> 00:10:16.890
But one of the
things that was cool

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:23.080
is to actually see that not only
cat videos go viral on YouTube.

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.800
That was a relief.

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:27.400
OK.

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:31.420
Let me talk about a different
kind of-- in a sense,

00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.930
both visualizations I
showed you to this point

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:36.670
were sort of real time-ish.

00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:41.088
The Google Instant
is an aggregate.

00:10:41.088 --> 00:10:45.410
The YouTube is real-time.

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:48.160
This is a very different
kind of visualization.

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.840
A few years ago, Martin
and I were approached

00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:54.560
by the "Boston Magazine."

00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:56.660
And they said to
us, can you create

00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:02.050
a visualization of Boston
for us on the print magazine?

00:11:02.050 --> 00:11:03.430
So it was non-interactive.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:05.180
We love doing things
that are interactive.

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.660
So this is even
more challenging.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:10.470
How do you visualize an entire
city on a piece of paper?

00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:11.970
So we started
thinking about Boston.

00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:13.345
And one of the
things that struck

00:11:13.345 --> 00:11:14.900
us is the seasonality, right?

00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:15.800
OK, great.

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.400
How do you get
that through data?

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.820
So we decided to go to
Flickr and look at-- scrape

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:29.800
all the public pictures
of the Boston Common

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.000
that were licensed under the
Creative Commons license.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:37.200
And we scraped that for
an entire year's worth.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.660
So we had photos for
January, for February,

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:45.050
for an entire year of the park.

00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:48.340
And then what we
did is we started

00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:51.440
counting the number of pixels
that were different colors.

00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.850
So for the bin of January,
how much white is there?

00:11:55.850 --> 00:11:56.900
How much red?

00:11:56.900 --> 00:11:57.850
How much blue?

00:11:57.850 --> 00:11:58.620
OK?

00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:00.770
So this is just a color cube.

00:12:00.770 --> 00:12:03.070
And this is how we
divided the color cube.

00:12:03.070 --> 00:12:06.860
And basically, by counting the
pixels, some of these cubes

00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:10.650
became bigger, some of
these cubes got smaller.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:13.520
And then we decided
we would sort of

00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.000
have this over a whole
year, and overlay

00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.620
each hue on top of each other.

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:26.170
And then we decided,
because it's a yearly thing,

00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:33.210
it's a cyclic thing, we decided
to put it on a circular format.

00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:36.310
And this is what a whole
year of Boston Common

00:12:36.310 --> 00:12:37.450
ended up looking like.

00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:41.770
So at the bottom
here, this is January.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:44.700
And you can see that
on the Boston Common,

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:49.390
there's a lot of snow, right?

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:52.570
As you start getting
closer to spring here,

00:12:52.570 --> 00:12:55.540
you get this fuchsia layer.

00:12:55.540 --> 00:13:00.420
And this is a lot of the flowers
that are blooming in the park.

00:13:00.420 --> 00:13:04.670
You get this bulge of greens
here for beginning of summer.

00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:09.410
And then it flows into sort
of like more towards the fall

00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:11.800
foliage over here.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:15.800
So this was our way
of trying to capture

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:20.560
a year's worth of Boston through
looking at the Boston Common.

00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:25.360
We were very happy because,
since we were working with data

00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:28.830
that wasn't ours, right, we
were just scraping from the web,

00:13:28.830 --> 00:13:30.970
it's very noisy data.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:32.690
People don't go to
the Boston Common

00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:35.020
just to take pictures
of the foliage.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.130
They take pictures of their
kids, or of the carousel,

00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.730
or of the frog pond, whatever.

00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.420
And so it was
totally unknown to us

00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:47.360
whether we would
have any signal that

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.950
would tell the story that we
were interested in in terms

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:50.740
of seasons.

00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.480
And if you broke
this very flowy thing

00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:55.330
into the different
seasons, you can

00:13:55.330 --> 00:13:57.020
see that the
distribution of colors

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.930
is actually dramatically
different between summer

00:13:59.930 --> 00:14:03.674
and winter and so forth.

00:14:03.674 --> 00:14:04.650
OK.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:10.250
And then I want to finish
with one project that

00:14:10.250 --> 00:14:11.600
is very interesting to us.

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:16.760
So before the awful
winter we had last year,

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:18.450
there was another
winter that was not

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:19.960
nearly as mild as this one.

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.750
I'm so happy about this winter.

00:14:22.750 --> 00:14:25.730
And so Martin and I were
thinking, you know, weather,

00:14:25.730 --> 00:14:28.560
is there anything we
can do with weather?

00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:31.720
And we decided there's a lot
of-- there are tons of data

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.230
about wind, about weather.

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.630
Is there anything
interesting we can do?

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:38.930
Well, the truth is,
wind has been visualized

00:14:38.930 --> 00:14:40.540
for hundreds of years, right?

00:14:40.540 --> 00:14:43.100
And so these are sort of
traditional visualizations

00:14:43.100 --> 00:14:44.630
of the wind.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:47.950
And they tended to be static
and sort of like vector

00:14:47.950 --> 00:14:51.120
field-based, right?

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:53.750
And so you do get a
sense of direction.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.050
You do, by the
length of each arrow,

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:58.910
you do get a sense of speed.

00:14:58.910 --> 00:15:01.600
But still, it's hard to
get a gestalt, right,

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:04.140
to get an overview and
sort of like, oh yeah,

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:08.150
this is where there's a little
round thing going over here.

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:14.750
This is where there's a
major pattern and so forth.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:18.580
So we decided to play
with this idea of,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.550
even though wind has been
visualized for hundreds

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:24.630
of years, is there anything we
can do that's new on the web,

00:15:24.630 --> 00:15:27.230
and that is more
dynamic or feels more

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:31.560
like this movement of the wind?

00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:35.410
And so let me show you
what we ended up doing.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:40.070
So this is the wind map.

00:15:40.070 --> 00:15:45.820
It's a live visualization of
the wind over the US right now.

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.170
And it's public, and
it's always there.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:53.070
And by keeping a
lot of the detail,

00:15:53.070 --> 00:15:57.000
by not averaging everything
out into a vector field,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:02.530
and keeping animation, you
do get a much more texture

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:06.080
sense of the wind, and how
there are these broad strokes

00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.350
in the middle of the country.

00:16:07.350 --> 00:16:11.300
But then, how over here in the
West, even though we're not

00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.220
showing you anything
about the way the land is,

00:16:15.220 --> 00:16:20.520
you can still see the tracery
of the mountains there.

00:16:20.520 --> 00:16:26.560
And then you can start to
play with this and zoom in.

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.510
And you can see here Boston.

00:16:28.510 --> 00:16:33.010
And we're doing great, because
we're not having too much wind.

00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:34.990
And wind is coming
from the south

00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:37.120
up, which is awesome,
because it makes

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:40.390
for that nice warm weather.

00:16:40.390 --> 00:16:42.830
But then another thing
that was interesting to us

00:16:42.830 --> 00:16:47.190
is just how much the
wind changes day to day.

00:16:47.190 --> 00:16:51.010
So we ended up creating
a small gallery

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.310
of different days of wind.

00:16:53.310 --> 00:16:57.080
And so you get things
like this, where

00:16:57.080 --> 00:17:01.280
this is a day where, like,
Canada was stealing our air,

00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:06.260
and not even the mountains
were stopping them.

00:17:06.260 --> 00:17:08.480
And this is very unusual.

00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:12.440
This is a very
different kind of day.

00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:20.099
You also have days
like these, where

00:17:20.099 --> 00:17:23.160
there's a lot of stuff
going on in different parts

00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:25.579
of the country.

00:17:25.579 --> 00:17:29.960
And you just-- you know,
it's like the wind parts

00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:32.650
in different ways, sort
of how you part your hair

00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:33.540
different days.

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:39.850
And then you have
stuff like this,

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:46.460
where you start zooming in
and this is Hurricane Isaac

00:17:46.460 --> 00:17:48.690
making landfall.

00:17:48.690 --> 00:17:52.260
And because this is a
real-time visualization,

00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.030
this was running,
and we were starting

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:56.700
to get emails from people.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:17:59.420
Like I remember this
one person said,

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:01.319
I live here in New
Orleans, and I'm

00:18:01.319 --> 00:18:03.110
looking at your
visualization, and I'm just

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:08.060
praying that this thing just
stops, just blows over us

00:18:08.060 --> 00:18:09.160
and we're OK.

00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:11.080
And that was a really
powerful moment,

00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.630
because we had never
had a visualization that

00:18:13.630 --> 00:18:18.950
was real-time, where
seeing this felt so--

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:23.480
made us connect to people in
different parts of the country.

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:32.710
It wasn't until we had this guy
that we realized what it meant.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:36.600
So this was Sandy
also making landfall.

00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:40.420
And for this-- you know, for the
first time we were in the path.

00:18:40.420 --> 00:18:45.690
And so this was interesting
because it was a visualization

00:18:45.690 --> 00:18:47.570
that sort of could be scary.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:51.570
We had never had this
situation before.

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:54.580
And so I want to tell you a
little bit about the reaction

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:59.670
that we got for
this visualization.

00:18:59.670 --> 00:19:04.260
Oh, yeah, and the other thing
that-- just because that's

00:19:04.260 --> 00:19:06.904
my-- that's what I
do, I visualize data,

00:19:06.904 --> 00:19:09.070
one of the things that I
think is really interesting

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:15.340
is the data on these images
is exactly the same data as

00:19:15.340 --> 00:19:17.710
on these images, right?

00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:22.130
And so the way in which
you approach something

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:24.317
makes a big difference.

00:19:24.317 --> 00:19:26.150
One of the things that
we're not doing here,

00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.100
that we're trying,
striving to do here,

00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:32.320
is to show as much detail
of the data as possible,

00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.400
to not aggregate the
data as much as possible.

00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:37.650
And that has a
bunch of pitfalls,

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:41.670
because it could create a much
more complex visualization

00:19:41.670 --> 00:19:43.540
than people can understand.

00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.880
But in a fascinating
way, I would

00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:48.570
say that the complexity,
the visual complexity

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.580
of these pictures here,
actually helps your eyes.

00:19:51.580 --> 00:19:55.120
It's sort of like when you have
more pixels in your camera,

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:56.682
it just, like, focuses.

00:19:56.682 --> 00:19:58.140
To me, it's sort
of the same thing.

00:19:58.140 --> 00:20:03.980
It's like, oh finally, I can
see these broad patterns of wind

00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:10.350
that, actually now, seeing them
all at once makes sense to me.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.460
So we started getting
a lot of email.

00:20:12.460 --> 00:20:13.120
A lot.

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:16.260
Like, we have never gotten
this much email before.

00:20:16.260 --> 00:20:18.620
And so it turns
out that farmers--

00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:20.030
we did this as an art piece.

00:20:20.030 --> 00:20:21.590
We just put it on
the web, and we

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:24.825
thought it was going to be this
completely sort of niche thing.

00:20:24.825 --> 00:20:26.930
It was like, who cares
about wind, right?

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:30.780
I didn't before I did
this visualization.

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.710
But it turns out a
ton of people do.

00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:35.460
So farmers will look
at this visualization

00:20:35.460 --> 00:20:39.050
before spraying their crops.

00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:41.440
Scientists will look
at the visualization

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:44.760
for bird migration, for
butterfly migration.

00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:47.440
Teachers love to
show this to kids,

00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.720
and to try to sit with them and
try to think about forecasts,

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.510
weather forecasts
and is this a week

00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:59.310
that's prone to tornadoes,
and things like that.

00:20:59.310 --> 00:21:04.410
Pilots started looking at this
visualization before flying.

00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:08.070
And then when we started-- both
commercial and military pilots,

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.730
by the way.

00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:11.165
And so when we got those
emails about the pilots,

00:21:11.165 --> 00:21:14.970
we're like, whoa,
whoa, no, no, no.

00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:18.620
Do not look at this map
before you fly your plane.

00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:22.780
We very specifically say that
we are showing surface wind,

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:23.280
right?

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:27.420
So surface wind is from the
earth to, like, 10 meters.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.320
It's like, you're going to
fly your plane way above that.

00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.920
And that's not going
to be the wind.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:32.735
They know that.

00:21:32.735 --> 00:21:33.360
They know that.

00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:37.140
But it just got a little
bit too scary for us.

00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:42.010
Like, wildfire firefighters
would look at the visualization

00:21:42.010 --> 00:21:44.980
before deciding
on their strategy.

00:21:44.980 --> 00:21:50.810
And so something that started
as our curiosity about the wind

00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:53.710
ended up being a
utilitarian tool for people

00:21:53.710 --> 00:21:54.700
without us knowing.

00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:56.600
And it is great.

00:21:56.600 --> 00:21:59.680
At the same time, you feel
like you're on the hook,

00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:03.900
because what if your
visualization isn't right?

00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:06.740
So we put a disclaimer.

00:22:06.740 --> 00:22:10.540
We said, do not use this
map for flying a plane,

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:12.380
sailing a boat, or
fight wildfires,

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:16.050
because we got multiple emails
about each one of those things.

00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:19.040
And we thought, OK, just
FYI, we have this disclaimer.

00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:21.320
Then we started getting
emails where they're like,

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:24.210
we understand that
it's your thing,

00:22:24.210 --> 00:22:28.450
but respect the power
of the visualization.

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:35.160
And so this just, to me, is
a really interesting moment,

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.920
because what it tells
me is that we are coming

00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:42.300
in an interesting
other end of the arc

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:44.710
I was talking to
you about before.

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:47.340
When I started
working in this field,

00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:51.870
we were very much in the this
is scientific, for scientists

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:54.200
only, for experts only.

00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:58.030
And now, I am so
proud that we have

00:22:58.030 --> 00:23:01.710
ways of talking about
data, of looking at data

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:05.930
where we're embracing so many
more communities, where it's

00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:08.010
not about whether
you're doing science

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:10.780
or not, or whether about you're
running a government or not,

00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:12.790
but it is about
your life, right?

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:15.400
It's how you
appropriate the data.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:17.150
How do you make use of it?

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:20.410
How do you become a better
consumer, a more skeptical

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.320
consumer of data?

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.110
And so that's what excites
me about this kind of work.

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:29.640
It's sort of like how can
we use these powers, right?

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:36.350
How can we use data for our
own benefits as citizens,

00:23:36.350 --> 00:23:39.010
and become better at it?

00:23:39.010 --> 00:23:42.640
And I think visualization can
play an awesome role there.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.890
So that's it.

00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.180
Thank you so much.

00:23:45.180 --> 00:23:46.575
[APPLAUSE]

00:23:46.575 --> 00:23:49.365
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

00:23:50.566 --> 00:23:51.690
SPEAKER: Thank you so much.

00:23:51.690 --> 00:23:51.880
FERNANDA VIEGAS: Yeah.

00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.220
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:23:52.220 --> 00:23:53.594
We're going to
have a few minutes

00:23:53.594 --> 00:23:55.020
here for questions and answers.

00:23:55.020 --> 00:23:59.276
We have a couple runners
with speaker-- with little--

00:23:59.276 --> 00:24:00.150
what are they called?

00:24:00.150 --> 00:24:00.710
Microphones.

00:24:00.710 --> 00:24:01.980
Thank you.

00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:03.960
So, yes.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.570
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:05.744
Thank you very much.

00:24:05.744 --> 00:24:06.910
I just had a quick question.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:08.360
When you started--
no, I'm sorry,

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.784
I wanted to ask both of you.

00:24:09.784 --> 00:24:10.992
FERNANDA VIEGAS: [INAUDIBLE].

00:24:10.992 --> 00:24:13.260
AUDIENCE: You
started off your talk

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.500
about talking about diversity,
and how that Google,

00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.400
you know, embraces
it and everything.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:23.730
I have read over, I think,
the last year or so,

00:24:23.730 --> 00:24:27.150
I guess, some not
very good statistics

00:24:27.150 --> 00:24:31.000
about diversity in
high-tech companies,

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:34.490
and how that women
make up only, like,

00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:37.995
5% of the engineers at all
these high-tech companies.

00:24:37.995 --> 00:24:42.470
I just wanted to know if you
could talk about sort of where

00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:45.870
Google stands in that,
and is Google any better

00:24:45.870 --> 00:24:48.535
or worse than your compatriots?

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:53.411
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:24:53.411 --> 00:24:54.160
Hi, [? Annalee ?].

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:54.820
Hi, Fernanda.

00:24:54.820 --> 00:24:55.660
Sorry to steal that.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:57.420
I just wanted to
take that because I'm

00:24:57.420 --> 00:24:59.789
one of the members of
the diversity team here.

00:24:59.789 --> 00:25:01.080
So thank you for that question.

00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.070
It's super important.

00:25:03.070 --> 00:25:04.820
For those of you who
don't know or may not

00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:07.760
have seen it, around
this time last year,

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:10.230
Google released
our public numbers

00:25:10.230 --> 00:25:12.970
around diversity, gender,
and I believe also

00:25:12.970 --> 00:25:15.490
some ethnicity numbers.

00:25:15.490 --> 00:25:18.640
So I would say reference
that for the most up-to-date

00:25:18.640 --> 00:25:19.980
statistical information.

00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.030
And I believe we will
be refreshing that

00:25:22.030 --> 00:25:23.430
around the same time this year.

00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:25.210
So you guys can be
looking out for that.

00:25:25.210 --> 00:25:26.910
Until that
information comes out,

00:25:26.910 --> 00:25:30.760
we can't talk specifically
about the actual numbers.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:34.552
But if you have questions
about last year's numbers--

00:25:34.552 --> 00:25:35.468
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:25:38.339 --> 00:25:38.880
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:41.505
I would just say, for all those
details, check out the website.

00:25:41.505 --> 00:25:43.940
The reports are all there,
and they're much more

00:25:43.940 --> 00:25:46.010
elaborate than I
could be right now.

00:25:46.010 --> 00:25:47.940
I would say, for this
Q&amp;A, if we could just

00:25:47.940 --> 00:25:50.320
focus it on Fernanda's content.

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.070
And if you have other
diversity questions,

00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:53.370
just feel free to let us know.

00:25:58.399 --> 00:25:59.274
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:01.974 --> 00:26:03.390
AUDIENCE: My name
is [? Anya. ?] I

00:26:03.390 --> 00:26:05.840
just wanted to ask you,
Fernanda, about your work

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.070
particularly.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.810
You mentioned about
visualizations and statistics,

00:26:09.810 --> 00:26:12.630
and I was wondering,
from my knowledge of it,

00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:15.780
how do you deal with-- because
with visualizations, you

00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:21.830
can show powerful information,
but you can also mislead,

00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:24.210
because there are outliers,
there is a section

00:26:24.210 --> 00:26:26.710
sample of overall big picture.

00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:29.210
I was just wondering how do you
deal with that in your work?

00:26:29.210 --> 00:26:31.043
What are the strategies
that you try to make

00:26:31.043 --> 00:26:33.840
sure that the final
product avoids

00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.084
the potential misleading?

00:26:35.084 --> 00:26:36.000
FERNANDA VIEGAS: Yeah.

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.530
So it's true-- so visualization,
as with any other media,

00:26:40.530 --> 00:26:43.760
you can mislead with words,
you can mislead with pictures,

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:46.570
and you can mislead
with visualization.

00:26:46.570 --> 00:26:51.090
So we try hard to make sure
that we have checks and balances

00:26:51.090 --> 00:26:54.910
for whatever data we work with.

00:26:54.910 --> 00:26:57.110
And there are different
levels at which we do that.

00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:59.620
So for instance, we
have user studies,

00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:02.400
where we show things
to people and we

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:04.500
try to understand from
their perspective what

00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:07.580
are they getting from the
representation we chose.

00:27:07.580 --> 00:27:09.380
I'll give you a very
specific example.

00:27:09.380 --> 00:27:10.840
I didn't show this
project today,

00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.020
but we have
launched-- last year,

00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:15.990
we launched with Google
Sheets the ability

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:18.150
to automatically
visualize your data.

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:20.570
So when you open
Google Sheets now,

00:27:20.570 --> 00:27:24.020
if we identify a data
table, we'll automatically

00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:28.230
visualize it and verbalize
things about your data,

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:30.660
verbalization
meaning we will say

00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:33.720
things that are of
interest about your data.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.590
So we started
saying things like,

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:39.900
oh, this is growing
exponentially, by 2%.

00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:44.190
And then we realized that lay
users do not understand that.

00:27:44.190 --> 00:27:46.710
What do you mean, an
exponential growth of 2%?

00:27:46.710 --> 00:27:50.040
An exponential growth is
an explosive growth, right?

00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:57.870
So we had to reword things
because our jargon was not

00:27:57.870 --> 00:28:00.840
making sense to end users.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:04.090
I would say another thing
that we did a long time ago,

00:28:04.090 --> 00:28:07.090
we created-- this
was not at Google,

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:09.290
this was when I was at IBM.

00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:12.100
We created the
first website where

00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:15.320
anyone could come
upload data and create

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:18.610
interactive visualizations
of their data and share

00:28:18.610 --> 00:28:20.110
with others.

00:28:20.110 --> 00:28:24.730
And when we presented that at
the top academic conference

00:28:24.730 --> 00:28:27.160
on visualization, on
data visualization,

00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:29.750
it was a half and half split.

00:28:29.750 --> 00:28:33.810
Some people were really excited
about the ability of giving--

00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:36.640
of making this technology
available to end users,

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:40.840
to anyone without training, and
half of the people were like,

00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:42.430
are you crazy?

00:28:42.430 --> 00:28:45.580
How dare you put these
visualization techniques

00:28:45.580 --> 00:28:47.820
in the hands of non-experts.

00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:49.610
They're going to mislead.

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:52.070
They're going to come up
with the wrong conclusions.

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.560
They're going to visualize
the data in the wrong way.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.850
To which I say, let them.

00:28:57.850 --> 00:29:01.970
Because if we don't make
these tools available,

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:04.190
then people are
not going to learn.

00:29:04.190 --> 00:29:07.720
I want people to make
little mistakes with data,

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:11.330
play with things, before they
make big mistakes with data

00:29:11.330 --> 00:29:15.050
at government or at industry.

00:29:15.050 --> 00:29:20.380
I want to have a pipeline where
kids-- so in this website, kids

00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:22.600
were playing with data, right?

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.330
And that's the kind
of pipeline that I

00:29:24.330 --> 00:29:28.460
think is important for you to
grow as a consumer of data,

00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:31.090
as a consumer of
data visualization.

00:29:31.090 --> 00:29:33.480
You have to become more skilled.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:35.390
And the only way
to become skilled--

00:29:35.390 --> 00:29:37.370
I think one of the
most effective ways

00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.970
is to play with it
yourself, right?

00:29:39.970 --> 00:29:43.060
So yes, I'm sure people
will make mistakes.

00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:45.260
But I welcome them,
right, before they

00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:46.442
become big mistakes.

00:29:46.442 --> 00:29:47.650
Like, I want little mistakes.

00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:52.010
Hi.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:54.107
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:54.107 --> 00:29:55.940
Your presentation is
incredible, by the way.

00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:58.597
And you come from a very
creative background,

00:29:58.597 --> 00:29:59.180
it seems like.

00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:00.805
And you've made this
transition to sort

00:30:00.805 --> 00:30:04.100
of like cutting-edge
data analytics.

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:05.790
What advice do you
have for someone

00:30:05.790 --> 00:30:08.350
who wants to make the
same type of transition,

00:30:08.350 --> 00:30:12.920
and perhaps what obstacles did
you have to surmount, if any,

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:14.540
sort of coming
from one background

00:30:14.540 --> 00:30:17.570
and going into another, but
staying true to what you love,

00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:19.510
it's just in a
different context?

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.224
So can you talk about your
journey and your obstacles?

00:30:22.224 --> 00:30:23.140
FERNANDA VIEGAS: Yeah.

00:30:23.140 --> 00:30:27.280
So as I said, I had
never programmed before.

00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:30.987
Like, I programmed very, very
little before I got to MIT.

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:38.800
So I will give you-- so yes,
there were lots of hurdles,

00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.130
and it was hard.

00:30:40.130 --> 00:30:42.290
So I think one of
the things that

00:30:42.290 --> 00:30:48.550
helped me was hoping that I
was going to learn this stuff,

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:50.210
and believing that I could.

00:30:50.210 --> 00:30:54.320
But I remember being in this
one software engineering class

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:58.210
at MIT and just, like,
crying my eyes out

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.360
because I was just like,
I am the dumbest person

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.320
in this entire class, in
this entire institute.

00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:04.910
I'm never going to get this.

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:10.780
And then just working and
working on it on-- and until I

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:16.800
got-- until programming
started to sink a little bit.

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:18.350
I think the most
important thing is

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:20.860
being open, and understanding
that getting out

00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:25.270
of your comfort zone
is hard, but it's OK.

00:31:25.270 --> 00:31:27.950
I feel like I never
grew as much as when

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:30.930
I went from graphic
design to the Media Lab,

00:31:30.930 --> 00:31:35.530
where I was exposed to all these
intellectual tools I had never

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:38.480
been exposed to before, and
all these different ways

00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:39.370
of thinking.

00:31:39.370 --> 00:31:45.580
It's hard work, and it-- and
in my case, it hurt a lot.

00:31:45.580 --> 00:31:48.440
Maybe other people are just,
like, more naturally prone to,

00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:55.810
you know, going from visual
to very mathematical thinking.

00:31:55.810 --> 00:31:57.070
But it's worth it.

00:31:57.070 --> 00:31:59.900
I feel like it was
the best thing,

00:31:59.900 --> 00:32:02.740
was to have these two very
different perspectives,

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:06.560
and just finding that
connections are where

00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:10.820
the excitement is, really.

00:32:10.820 --> 00:32:14.740
I think there's a question
all the way there.

00:32:14.740 --> 00:32:18.310
AUDIENCE: For someone who's
interested in learning more

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:20.210
about making data
visualizations,

00:32:20.210 --> 00:32:23.710
are there specific tools
or libraries or things

00:32:23.710 --> 00:32:26.430
that you should learn
about to move forward?

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:28.080
FERNANDA VIEGAS: Yes.

00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:33.080
There are some really nice tools
and communities at this point.

00:32:33.080 --> 00:32:36.790
So one, I-- two
things I recommend.

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:40.110
One is the processing community.

00:32:40.110 --> 00:32:42.160
There's processing.js.

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:45.620
And there's a very
strong community there.

00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:49.300
And people are happy
to answer questions.

00:32:49.300 --> 00:32:52.320
And just the community
aspect is great.

00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:57.190
If you already know a little
bit of front-end programming

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:59.130
and you just want
to go, oh, what

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:01.420
is visualization
libraries, then I

00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:04.590
would say D3 is the way to go.

00:33:04.590 --> 00:33:10.050
It's not super welcoming
of newbies, I guess,

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:12.210
but the good thing about
D3, I would say this,

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.190
is they have an amazing
set of examples.

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:17.270
And so you can just
reuse the code.

00:33:17.270 --> 00:33:19.950
You don't have to start from
scratch, which is awesome.

00:33:19.950 --> 00:33:22.690
And D3 is what everybody
like the pros use.

00:33:22.690 --> 00:33:23.710
So it's great.

00:33:26.760 --> 00:33:30.220
AUDIENCE: So just asking
more library questions.

00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:33.900
Where do you think WebGL
is trending in the future,

00:33:33.900 --> 00:33:37.100
and what do you think are the
late-- the sort of hottest

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.040
libraries, whether it's
three.js or, you know,

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.287
something that is a little
less mature than D3?

00:33:43.287 --> 00:33:44.120
FERNANDA VIEGAS: OK.

00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:49.450
So are you specifically
interested in 3D things, or--

00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:52.980
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
and what libraries

00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:56.310
do you think are really
sort of hot at the moment?

00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:57.540
FERNANDA VIEGAS: OK.

00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:04.920
So I would say definitely
D-- oh my god, now I'm

00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:08.460
getting all confused in
my library names here.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:14.540
One of the things for me is
that I do a lot of 2D work.

00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:18.860
So even WebGL, I'm just now
getting started with WebGL.

00:34:18.860 --> 00:34:21.000
And one of the things
I'll say about WebGL

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.330
is that I'm actually
starting to learn it

00:34:24.330 --> 00:34:27.739
so I can do 2D things with it.

00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:30.530
And I think that is a
really interesting-- oh, OK.

00:34:30.530 --> 00:34:31.400
All right.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:37.350
That's a really interesting next
step for these 3D libraries,

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:41.830
is to how can we co-opt
them for 2D work?

00:34:41.830 --> 00:34:50.210
And so what is-- you
mentioned-- is it js-- three.js?

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:54.230
Yes, that's one that
I would definitely--

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:57.230
that's one of the ones
we're exploring with,

00:34:57.230 --> 00:35:03.530
and we've had the biggest sort
of return on investment so far.

00:35:03.530 --> 00:35:06.230
So I would definitely
look into that.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:09.880
