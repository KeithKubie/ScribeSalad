00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.072
So if you were to give guidance about
where to put all these fancy read

00:00:03.072 --> 00:00:05.240
listeners in your activity,
what would you say?

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.537
&gt;&gt; You know, that's a great question and
I'm not entirely sure.

00:00:08.537 --> 00:00:10.660
&gt;&gt; Eh, it was mostly rhetorical.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.560
I've actually done a little
reading on this one.

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:13.720
Here's what I found.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.700
Here's our friendly Android life cycle,
where we create and

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.180
destroy our Fire base listeners
is a typical developer trade off.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.710
Memory versus network
traffic in this case.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.030
Remember that every time you recreate
a listener, it pings the database.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.610
And listeners are also so big they
can be kept around for a long time,

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:31.850
in which case they leave
a memory footprint.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:34.580
So, there are some different rules
of thumb that you should go by

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.090
when you're actually creating or
destroying your listeners.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.100
If you're going to come back to the
activity a few times, you should make

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.020
your listeners in on create, and
get rid of them in on destroy.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.448
This is because your activity
will be going in and

00:00:46.448 --> 00:00:49.943
out of the visible life cycle, and
therefore on start and on stop, and

00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:54.180
on resume and on pause will get called
many times as your activity lives.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.290
You put your listeners in any of these
methods, you'll be generating unwanted

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:00.650
network activity by continually
recreating listeners.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.790
If the activity is likely to be a one
off activity, you should consider making

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.760
your listeners in on start, and
cleaning them up in on stop.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.340
So you might be wondering what
I mean by one off activity.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.570
Well, some sort of activity that
the user is unlikely to return to.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.330
Such as a login screen.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.840
A user will probably log in once and
then sort of use the app for a while.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.940
They might even minimize the app and
do other things and

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.030
come back to the app, all without
visiting the login screen again.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.760
Now why not just put these in
on created and on destroy?

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.480
Well, on stop will be fired sometimes
significantly earlier than on

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:35.820
destroy will.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.850
And because of that you'll end
up freeing up the memory sooner.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.450
With all of that said, the engineers
at Fire base did build listeners to be

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.350
relatively lightweight, but
just like cleaning up your listeners,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.910
this is another best practice to
keep your app running smoothly.
