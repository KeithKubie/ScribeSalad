new issues this is really dangerous path
 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.870
new issues this is really dangerous path
because the climate change will not not

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880
because the climate change will not not
 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.990
because the climate change will not not
stop it will accelerate so therefore it

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000
stop it will accelerate so therefore it
 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.389

issue and then on a longer perspective
 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.650
issue and then on a longer perspective
we might look better yes this was a temp

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660
we might look better yes this was a temp

situation it was negative but we learned
 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.859
situation it was negative but we learned
so much from it that we answer that it

speeded up and and then met our goal and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650
speeded up and and then met our goal and
 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.620
speeded up and and then met our goal and
ensure that we installed a climate

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630
ensure that we installed a climate
 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.550
ensure that we installed a climate
change problem and therefore prepared

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
change problem and therefore prepared
 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:25.040
change problem and therefore prepared
paralyzed for next generation

change so that we have passed a tipping

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870
change so that we have passed a tipping
 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.660
change so that we have passed a tipping
point and that will not be able to

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670
point and that will not be able to
 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.830
point and that will not be able to
influence ah the future of our globe the
