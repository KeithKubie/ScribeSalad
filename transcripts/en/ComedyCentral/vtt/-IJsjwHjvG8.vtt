00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:01.500
I was always coming into
auditions with the script

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.770
just reading it like this-
Me too.

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:04.410
And then other people come in
and have it memorized.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.630
Yeah. Yeah.

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.850
You want a Cajun accent?

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.200
And I was like,
"Well, fuck this."

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.290
He's got options,
I'm just reading.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.930
Every audition is just literally
Desus reads this script.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.840
I'm like, "Don't take my baby.
Please, don't take my baby."

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.270
You're so funny.

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.670
They're like,
"Give more action," I'm like,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.280
"Don't take my baby.
How was that? I got the part?

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.140
No? I'm out, alright" ...
I take mad waters and leave.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.390
I definitely think those two
have banged offscreen.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:33.080
Yeah, they definitely
seem like they've ramrodded.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.310
Because their chemistry
is too much.

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.010
Speaking of banging offscreen-

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.090
Ey!

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.190
I thought that was ...
I was like wow, we're here.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.410
[crosstalk]
Hello. Wow.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.620
So messy.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.710
Guys, Desus and Mero
just walked into the studio.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.830
Guys, thank you so much
for being here.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.230
You guys are going to be
at the New York Comedy

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.000
Festival November 11-

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.210
11/11, yes.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.210
Bodega Boys Live
at Madison Square Garden.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.570
Are you into astrology?

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.780
Ah no. Why?

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:02.990
No, 'cause I don't know.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:05.410
Is anybody into astrology?
Isn't 11-11 a special number?

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.630
Yeah, it is.
It is.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.550
No. You're supposed
to make a wish.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.790
That's like 'hood astrology.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.250
That's what guys would say.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.780
Like Babe, you text your girl
that you love her.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.040
Like make a wish.
Thinking about you.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.250
Making a wish. Making a wish.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.990
If your girl's really simple,
you hit her at 12:34,

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.650
like 1-2-3-4 babe.
I love you.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.160
'Hood astrology is so funny.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.660
There's certain
numbers like 666.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.870
Yeah, 420, yeah.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.510
There's certain things
that you ... 420, yeah.

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.990
But 11-11 make a wish,
I still do that.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.380
It's never worked.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.590
Never?

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.890
I think it's worked.

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.260
Or like an eyelash on your nose.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.630
Nose, yeah.
No, I'll take every wish.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.590
I don't think we're keep track
of those, nobody's following up.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:38.800
Oh, I do.
No, God and Jesus.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.020
Do you make a chart?

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.320
God and Jesus are listening
to every single one.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.530
Make it come true.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:43.450
Wow.
I swear to God.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:44.650
Imagine if you were God,
you was like,

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.460
"I made all the planets, these
idiots are wishing on 11-11?"

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.690
He's just looking at it.
He's like-

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:49.910
Look at gravity.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:51.910
Yo, you asshole,
it's an eyelash.

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:53.130
I'll take any dumb wish.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.350
It's an eyelash.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.570
I'll get my mits on any,

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:57.530
and even if I think
it's completely hog shit,

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.160
I'm like "I'll take
the God damned wish."

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.830
You know what else I'm doing?

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:02.520
To make me feel better
about living in New York

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.240
I've started throwing coins in
the water, on the train tracks.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.450
Yeah.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.970
'Cause you do that
in Disney World, right?

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.190
Oh.
You can make a wish.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.600
And you make a wish,
I wanna do that.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.810
Like, a urban wish.

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.010
That is so sweet.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:13.530
So you're like, "I wish
my train comes on time."

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.770
Yeah.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.940
Do you ever miss the puddle?

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.220
[crosstalk] a rat curses at you.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.410
Or worse, you splash up some of
the water, gets on your mouth.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.260
That water's pretty
fucking opaque.

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.530
I don't know if you-

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:26.730
Yeah, that's a good-

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.000
The coin just starts dissolving
as it goes through.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.280
Yeah, you just see smoke
coming out of the fucking thing,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.650
as soon as you threw
your penny in there.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.850
It's wild.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.400
Also, I'm pretty sure NYPD would
give you a ticket for that.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.650
"Oh, you throwing pennies
on the tracks?"

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.880
Hey asshole!
Come over here.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:39.110
Hey, hey, hey. Hey.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.320
That's littering, technically.
Yeah.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.600
Yeah. "You wanted to penny
on a track?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:42.990
I'll throw a fucking penny
on a track,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.690
how about you, you asshole?"

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.600
Do you ever think about
how much money you've just lost

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.580
by pulling money
out of your pocket and-

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.820
Oh yeah, all the time.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.130
Today a $20 came out of
my pocket and I saw it luckily.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:55.410
I always just think ...

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.440
Or you've just thrown away
in the trash

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.720
with just cleaning
out pockets or purse-

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.010
Everything. I lose ...

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:02.810
I just shed debit cards
throughout this thing.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.910
I'm like Oprah.
"You get a debit card!

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:06.700
You get a debit card!
You get a debit card!"

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.080
I was walking and I
dropped about ...

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:09.300
I wanna say four quarters
.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.580
Yeah.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.790
But it was like on 53rd Street,

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.080
and there's all
these people around.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.370
And people recognized me
and I was like,

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.370
"Do I really wanna be see
bending over for four quarters?"

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.990
Chasing a quarter as it rolls
all the way down.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:21.560
Around the street.
I got a long stick,

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.150
I'm going down the sewer
trying to get the quarter

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:24.360
with a piece of gum
on the end of it.

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.560
That'd be like somebody more.

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.310
If I saw like Robert De Niro
chasing a-

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.810
Like chasing a dollar.

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.070
"Oh my God. It's take a penny,
leave a penny."

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.590
I'm like, "I better go see
his movies.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.480
He's not doing so well.
He's so humble.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.780
I gotta go see Meet the Fockers,
he's such a real guy."

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.820
That's so true,
when you drop change.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.740
Because if you leave it though,
you look like,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.000
"I don't need money."

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.270
You know what you've gotta do.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.520
You have to just chase it.
I don't care.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.850
Or if you pay for something
at a Bodega

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.950
and you a dime drops
into the gum?

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.230
And instead of fishing it out,
sometimes I just leave it

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.910
and someone will go,
"Hey, there's a dime."

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.190
And I'm like, "I don't ... "

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.770
You just feel like ...
Okay thanks. Now I have to-

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.150
It makes me feel like
an uppity cunt.

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.390
Yeah.
Exactly.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.860
Oh look at fancy pants
over here.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.080
Doesn't need a dime.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.270
And you're getting
in your Tesla.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.520
You don't need a dime.
You don't have the time to dig

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.270
in the Double Bubble
for your dime?

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.680
I'm sure you guys
have heard it before.

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.340
Who's this person?
Who's-

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.370
What we get a lot is people
coming directly to us like,

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:16.740
"Who are you?
Where do I know you from?"

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.720
I'm like, "I don't know. Cops?"

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.230
That's so funny.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:21.630
I don't know. The local news.

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:22.840
It happens a lot.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.360
If other people on the street
see us they're like,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.610
"Oh, Desus and Mero."
And they're like, "Huh.

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.750
What you guys?
What are you? Rappers?"

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.430
You rap?

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:35.690
Rap for me. Rap. Rap. Rap.
Hip hop.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.950
A baby bubba. I'm like,
"Nah, we don't do that."

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.650
Hot tracks.
Somebody isolate that.

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:43.740
Big with the millennials.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:46.100
You guys have a show
coming out on Showtime.

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.160
What's going on
with that right now?

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.370
So cute.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.160
It's just a rip of Ray Donovan.
It's completely unoriginal.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.490
Yeah. It's just another season
of Shameless,

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.440
but I replace William H. Macy
and he plays one of the kids.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.990
No, no. It's similar to our last
show but more polished.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.240
More, you know-

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:04.480
Bigger.

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.920
What process are you in?
When is it going to be on?

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:08.180
Do we know what date?

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.490
Are you guys just
in pre-production?

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.080
Starting 2019, still early idea.

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.830
You guys. I love this point.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.170
When you have the deal.
But it's not in the-

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:20.320
And it's like shush.
And all your handles are like,

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.720
"Do not say the air date
on the air.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.490
On any show.
You can't say anything."

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:26.780
Yup. You can't even-

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.010
You can't say anything.

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:29.230
Do not even say it.
But it's there.

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:30.430
We have it.

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.630
Everything is there.
Everything is there.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.760
You have the announcement.
Everyone is so excited for you.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.290
Everything is being worked on.

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:36.620
It's all coming together
beautifully.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.860
We're super excited.

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.810
I'm just about to blurt it out
but I'm like, "No."

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:41.340
My new this is I just
tell people made-up dates.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:42.550
Yes, okay.

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.210
'Cause people are like,
"When's it gonna start bro?"

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.610
November 38.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:46.830
April 18!

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.530
Black Friday, Black Friday.

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.640
February 30th.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.800
First day of Hanukah.
First night, sorry. First night.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.000
First day of Hanukah.
Wow.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.700
Is that the day party
for Hanukah?

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.420
You've been holding out on me?

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.740
So much of this business
is the announcement.

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:08.850
Is the deadline announcement.
That's almost like most of it.

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.100
Just announcing it.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:12.690
You guys are in that perfect
position of having announced it

00:06:12.690 --> 00:06:14.800
and having got
all the congratulations

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.150
and you're a big ...

00:06:16.150 --> 00:06:18.700
But you haven't had
to show us anything yet.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:20.680
So, it's all excitement.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.340
We only expect
the greatest from you.

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:24.400
There's no disappointment.
I love that phase.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:26.420
Between announcement
and show-date.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.420
It's a delightful feeling, yeah.

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.860
We're kinda getting
a different result.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:32.260
Not 'cause people
on Twitter ...

00:06:32.260 --> 00:06:33.610
People on Twitter
hate everything.

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.240
They're already like, "Oh wow.

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.280
You guys blew your load.
You should have been on already.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.270
No one's gonna watch it now.
You fucked up."

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.550
It's too late.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:42.760
We haven't even started yet.
What's-

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.020
I can't wait for this show.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.720
Look at all the stuff that's
happening in the world today.

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:47.110
You guys should be
on TV covered.

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:48.530
I'm like, the world
is still gonna exist

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.770
when we're on the air.

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.480
Well, that's debatable.
Fingers crossed.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.920
Fingers crossed.
You know what I'm saying?

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.700
Unless I push a button
and end it all.

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:59.710
I will do it.
Don't say I won't.

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:01.550
Is it gonna be a weekly?
Yeah.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:04.830
Okay. 'Cause you guys used
to do four days a week?

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:06.100
Yeah, four days a week.

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.110
How was that?
How was the grind of that?

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.210
It wasn't that bad 'cause it was
all off the cuff, improv.

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:13.370
We were just talking.
Just riffing, whatever.

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.520
'Cause we've met other comedians
who work four nights a week,

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.210
and they're like, "Bro."
They're like burned out.

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.430
How do you do it?

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.130
Because they have to
write everything.

00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:21.520
All the scripts. And edits and-

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.780
You guys just show up
and be yourselves.

00:07:24.650 --> 00:07:27.650
It's wild 'cause they're like,
"Oh man, this is so nuts.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:29.340
Me and my 30 writers ... "

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.720
I'm like, "30 writers?
How do you pay them?

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:36.950
How do you ...
We just go in and talk."

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:38.180
It was fun 'cause you had ...

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.810
If something happened
you had an immediate platform

00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.010
to react to something.

00:07:41.010 --> 00:07:42.260
So now it's like,
something happens

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:44.710
and you might send one tweet.
Like, "Huh. Showed her."

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:46.470
But it's not the same.
It's not the same.

00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:48.280
Yeah, what does it feel
like not doing it every day?

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:49.510
Does it feel a little bit-

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:51.010
Now you get people come at you
and they're like,

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.210
"I wish I could get
your viewpoint on this."

00:07:54.030 --> 00:07:55.820
I'll be in my basement,
stoned at 2:00am like,

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:57.320
"Here's my viewpoint
via Twitter."

00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.060
You know what I'm saying?
"I have 280 characters out."

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.870
It's the same way
I feel about this show.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.720
It's like, it's four days
a week for two hours.

00:08:05.970 --> 00:08:07.950
I literally walked in
at 10:03am today.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:10.020
I was late.
First day being late.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.230
Right gang, we all here.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:12.520
But that's now gonna
be the new rag.

00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.960
The new thing.

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:15.950
And you just talk and people
are like,

00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:19.460
"How is it? Is it such a grind?"
And I'm like, "I'm just myself

00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:21.010
and I get to talk
with my friends.

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:24.330
It's the great ... We've carved
out the greatest ...

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:25.750
I have the greatest job."

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.160
That's because you're yourself.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.520
It's not like you gotta
come here

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.890
and get gemmed up and be like,
"I'm going into character mood."

00:08:30.890 --> 00:08:32.230
Well, I like to get
gemmed out, but-

00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:33.850
Nikki Wack Wack. That would be-

00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:35.500
You show up,
you don't get ready.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.050
Look like shit.

00:08:37.050 --> 00:08:41.340
I was just like [crosstalk]

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:42.960
No, but it is just so nice

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.340
to have carved out a place
in this business for myself

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.770
where I don't have
to prepare that much.

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:51.090
I just wanna be.
And what you can do-

00:08:51.090 --> 00:08:52.310
The persona is whack-

00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.770
And what you can do,
what I've gotten fired

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:56.650
for in every other job,
just running my dumb yap.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:59.050
It's like, "Finally,
I'm paid to talk back."

00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:00.840
Yeah, you think about all
those times in the past like,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.940
"If I had said that.
I'd be at HR right now."

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.500
But now the crowd's like,
"Wonderful. Take our money."

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.130
I'm like, "I should have done
this ten years ago."

00:09:08.130 --> 00:09:09.420
Oh my God. Oh wow. I love it.
I love it.

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:11.580
Desus and Mero
are here in the studio.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:13.690
Rachel Feinstein is also here.

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:15.530
Make sure to check them out
at the New York Comedy

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.030
Festival, November 11.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:20.920
Bodega Boys
Live at Madison Square Gardens.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:22.680
Is it just you guys
at Madison Square Garden?

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.890
Just us.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:25.130
Dude.
That's insane.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:26.610
At the Hulu Theater.
At the Hulu Theater.

00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:29.470
Not the actual Madison Square.
We're not doing Drake levels.

00:09:29.470 --> 00:09:32.400
Not gonna be Kanye
floating on the stage above.

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.160
But that's still a big deal.

00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.760
It's still Madison
Square Garden.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:38.470
If you guys were lowered onto
the stage, I would respect that.

00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:39.860
If you're ever
gonna be lowered-

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.100
Oh yeah.

00:09:41.100 --> 00:09:43.220
You should be dropped
with strings.

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.790
We talked about that
and it's just like,

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.110
that comes out
of our own pocket.

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:48.800
And knowing us, we'd each want
to cut edges, so it's just like,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:50.600
"I'll hold the string
while you go down,

00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:51.820
and have someone else
do it for me."

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:53.460
That is so funny that
that one activity

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.690
would come out of your pocket.

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:56.810
It's like $79.99
to lower yourselves.

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.240
The shows are weird.
They're like,

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.360
"You can do anything you want."
They'll pay for everything else.

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.930
I was like, "Can I have
a microphone on a stand?"

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.170
They're like, "That's $2000."

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:08.950
"That's $80000." If you go over
two minutes, it's $45000-

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:10.970
What about flames or smoke?

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:12.230
Oh, forget it.

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:14.550
The fire service charges
are way up.

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:17.200
If you see us with pyrotechnics,
you know we made it.

00:10:18.650 --> 00:10:20.920
And monitors and shit like that,
on trillion dollar set.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.250
We made it.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.490
We wanna get to U2 levels.

00:10:23.490 --> 00:10:26.120
Like, unnecessary flying in
on a helicopter.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.770
Putting our podcast
on every Apple product.

00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.260
How about just oiled women
petting you?

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:30.880
You could have some friends
or something.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.300
Oh wow, yeah.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.540
I'll wear Speedo, yeah.
I'll wear Speedo.

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:35.850
There'll be so much body here.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:38.240
I'll do it for a Starbucks
gift card.

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.440
Sounds good. Sounds good.

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:40.710
Any amount.

00:10:40.710 --> 00:10:41.920
Any amount.

00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.240
I just like the card.

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.539
I like to fill my wallet
with different cards.

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:49.440
I actually just used
the Starbucks app.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.950
I haven't used it in a while.
It got really fancy.

00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.810
I tried to order
from a moving car

00:10:54.810 --> 00:10:56.590
and for a pick-up
and it got a little sassy.

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:58.100
It was like,
"You're seven minutes away.

00:10:58.100 --> 00:10:59.660
It's gonna take three minutes
to order this drink.

00:10:59.660 --> 00:11:00.870
Order when you
get closer."

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.120
Dang.

00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:03.500
I was like, "Wow."

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.720
Bitch.

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:09.280
I was like, "Wow. Okay.
Let me tell you something-"

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.490
Excuse me. When you get closer.

00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:14.040
Then you can make
your order, sir.

00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.350
I was like, "Wow."

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:20.090
I have a line. Excuse me.
I have to take care of them.

00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:21.820
It's really my most-used app.

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:23.260
I get Starbucks
three times a day,

00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:24.790
and I always use
the mobile app.

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:26.290
I look at people in line
and I'm like, "You idiots."

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.360
"What's wrong with you? Idiots.
You guys are maniacs".

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.170
Come in all impatient,
and you're like,

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.570
"A latte for Nikki."

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:34.620
Yeah.
"I used the app."

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:36.470
You just push through
all the others.

00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:39.910
I have it out so the people
at the bar know

00:11:39.910 --> 00:11:41.310
that that's what I'm there for.

00:11:41.310 --> 00:11:43.090
It's like a cop badge.
Just walk in like-

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.320
Casually.

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:46.260
"Hey, it's the Sheriff
of Starbucks."

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:47.850
I love listening to orders.

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:50.450
You order like Meg Ryan on
When Harry Met Sally.

00:11:50.450 --> 00:11:52.380
Like, it's the most
specific order ever.

00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.100
But it just sounds like a woman
who knows what she wants.

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.450
Can I have a chai latte
with almond milk?

00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:00.470
A splash of lamb's wool?

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:03.030
I'm so cunty. I hate my orders.

00:12:03.030 --> 00:12:04.620
I always feel so bad.
But I always-

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:06.140
What is your main order now?

00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:08.690
At Starbucks, it's ...
Well, it's ridiculous.

00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:10.030
Just say it. Say it!

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:12.660
Today literally the girl goes,
"I don't know what this means."

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:15.720
I heard the barista say
that to another person.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.470
And I go, "I know
that's my drink."

00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:22.070
So, it's a venti traditional
misto, I don't know ...

00:12:22.070 --> 00:12:26.230
A misto is half coffee
and half steamed soy.

00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.820
It is a ...
It's a bitch latte.

00:12:29.570 --> 00:12:32.280
It's not as strong as a latte,
and it's less milk.

00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:34.640
It's not as milky as a latte.

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:35.940
But you're worth it.

00:12:35.940 --> 00:12:37.760
I had never heard
the word misto before.

00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:38.960
It's a café au lait

00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:41.520
If you were going to the Bodega
to get coffee,

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:42.970
I'd be like,
"Yo Papi, I'll have a misto."

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.069
They're like,
"Is that an anime character?

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.800
Is he in Infinity War?

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:50.460
I don't remember him
from that movie."

00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.770
So, a misto is ...

00:12:51.770 --> 00:12:55.450
It's a café au lait but
Starbucks uses Italian phrases,

00:12:55.450 --> 00:12:57.680
not French,
so you have to say misto.

00:12:57.680 --> 00:12:58.910
But it is a café au lait,

00:12:58.910 --> 00:13:01.090
which is a common order
in a French café.

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:02.390
Okay, I'm not crazy.

00:13:02.390 --> 00:13:04.240
Okay, good to know.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.860
And let me just say,
50% of people

00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:07.340
don't know where to find it
in the computer.

00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:08.640
They're always like,
"Where's a misto?"

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.880
Like, it is a weird order.

00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:12.370
Then, okay.
Then I get almond ...

00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:15.150
They don't call it almond milk,
they call it almond drink.

00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:17.700
So, it's with almond milk
instead of regular.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.530
Light soy ...
And then I do a splash of soy,

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.030
which that confuses people
because it should just be ...

00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:24.410
I'm adding soy.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.920
I recently found out
the soy milk

00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:29.430
there has a candy bar's
amount of sugar in it.

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:31.920
So now I just want a little bit
of soy milk as a sweetener-

00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:33.470
So bad saying a splash
of anything.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:34.940
That's how you ask
for that amount.

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:37.210
A Jew's whisper of soy.

00:13:37.210 --> 00:13:38.940
Wow. That's one phrase

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:42.520
I would not be saying out
loud at Starbucks ever.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:43.900
"Can I get a Jew's whisper?"

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:47.500
"Can I have an Italian blink
of a ... "

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:50.990
"Let me get a Jamaican
trailer-load of cinnamon."

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:57.390
And then I get it extra hot,
'cause it's never hot enough.

00:13:57.390 --> 00:13:59.960
I get it extra hot
'cause I chug things too much.

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.370
I'm a chugger.

00:14:01.370 --> 00:14:02.830
And that slows me
down from chugging,

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:04.040
'cause it'll burn my throat.

00:14:04.040 --> 00:14:05.240
Burn your throat, yeah.

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:08.680
So it keeps me at a normal pace
that people tend to sip coffee.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:10.450
It keeps me sipping.

00:14:10.450 --> 00:14:13.980
And oftentimes, they will only
fill it up to here because-

00:14:13.980 --> 00:14:15.260
That's how they get you.

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:16.960
I hate that.

00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:19.050
If I wanted space-

00:14:19.050 --> 00:14:22.130
If I wanted a grande,
I would have ordered a grande.

00:14:22.130 --> 00:14:23.940
I hate when they don't ask you
if you want space,

00:14:23.940 --> 00:14:25.140
and they just give it to you.

00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.450
Oh, I don't want room.
I never want room.

00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:29.270
No room. Just tell them no room.

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:31.840
Don't ever B&amp;B
my fucking coffee.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.870
No. I'll get them fired.
I'll get them fired.

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:36.120
Wait, you'll Jewish whisper
to their manager?

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:39.800
I'm a letter writer.
I make sure.

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:41.800
Oh my ... No.
Can you imagine?

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.440
You sound like my wife when she
writes letters for everything.

00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:46.540
I've never wrote a letter ever.

00:14:46.540 --> 00:14:48.520
Does she really?
Does she get stuff from it?

00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:50.220
She gets so much shit.

00:14:50.790 --> 00:14:54.570
I had never known
of this strategy.

00:14:54.570 --> 00:14:58.570
If you get something fucked up,
you write an angry

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:01.200
but well-worded
email or letter.

00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:05.040
If you fucking physically write
a letter and put a stamp-

00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:06.830
Wait, she writes a letter
like Benjamin Franklin?

00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.110
Yeah.
That's the only person

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.330
I can think of
who has written a letter.

00:15:09.330 --> 00:15:10.930
My mom used to do that.
I've never done it in my life,

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.620
but she would get
all kinds of free stuff

00:15:12.620 --> 00:15:15.220
My mom ... This is bizarre.

00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:17.310
Wait, she'll take out
a pen and paper? And stationery?

00:15:17.310 --> 00:15:18.610
And paper. Yeah.
And stationery.

00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:19.840
I don't think I even own paper.

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:21.040
I don't know how
to write anymore.

00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:24.270
I just have to write on the back
of my American Express card.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:26.730
My friend does it,
and he writes certified mail

00:15:26.730 --> 00:15:29.920
to the head of the company
so that they have to answer it.

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.640
They have to ... Acknowledge me!
Don't just throw me in a pile!

00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.870
Wow.

00:15:33.870 --> 00:15:35.710
She will literally write-

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:37.170
And you get all kinds
of free shit.

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:41.090
All kinds of free shit.
Very petty stupid thing.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:43.860
Got an Entiman's cake
from the supermarket.

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:45.940
It was bad.
Had mold on the bottom.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:48.010
She was like ...
She took pictures of it.

00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.020
Was like, "This fucking cake
had mold on the bottom.

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.990
I demand my money back.
Blah blah blah blah."

00:15:52.990 --> 00:15:54.270
Supermarket gave her
a hard time.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.570
She was like,
"I'm going to corporate."

00:15:55.570 --> 00:15:59.490
Wrote a ...
Was a brick and mortar letter.

00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:03.830
Put it in a fucking envelope,
put a stamp on it, send it-

00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.260
She had like a five
paragraph essay?

00:16:05.260 --> 00:16:06.540
Yeah, seriously.

00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.550
Sent it, and then Entiman's
sent back a fucking giant

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.590
envelope full of free
Entiman's forever.

00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:13.930
Wow.

00:16:13.930 --> 00:16:15.240
It's like Charlie's
golden ticket.

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:17.730
They're all over my house.
I lift up my couch cushion

00:16:17.730 --> 00:16:19.160
and there's like,
"Oh, free cake."

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:21.220
It's true.
It takes one cunty note

00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.500
and you get a lifetime
of free shit.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:23.710
A lifetime of free shit.

00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:25.370
Just the idea of writing
a physical letter

00:16:25.370 --> 00:16:26.600
is so exhausting to me.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:27.870
I would never do it.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.440
I don't even mail things
I'm supposed to mail.

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.680
Where do you even get a stamp
nowadays?

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:31.900
You gotta go the Post Office?

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:33.210
I went to the Post Office
the other day and I was like,

00:16:33.210 --> 00:16:34.600
"Do you sell stamps?"
And they were like,

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.550
"We don't take food stamps."
I was like, "No."

00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:38.550
Believe it or not,
at one time people

00:16:38.550 --> 00:16:40.170
put a little picture
on an envelope

00:16:40.170 --> 00:16:41.520
and sent it across the land.

00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:42.740
Nobody has stamps.

00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.220
You've gotta go to the airport
to get rid of something.

00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.460
It's crazy.
[crosstalk]

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.910
You go to the Post Office ...

00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:50.650
People at the Post Office hate
you for using the Post Office.

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:52.660
[crosstalk]
Yeah, they get angry.

00:16:52.660 --> 00:16:54.460
You're sending a package?
Mother fucker.

00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.260
Why are you keeping us
in business?

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:57.970
They just want it to be over.

00:16:57.970 --> 00:16:59.350
They want to be
put out of their misery.

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.590
They're like,
"You people ..."

00:17:00.590 --> 00:17:01.800
You see the windows

00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:03.410
and you see the person
sitting there like ...

00:17:03.410 --> 00:17:04.690
And you walk over
and they're like,

00:17:04.690 --> 00:17:06.710
"Did I turn the light on?
No. So, go back online."

00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:07.950
"Did I say next?"

00:17:07.950 --> 00:17:10.020
Mother fucker.
"Did I say next?

00:17:10.020 --> 00:17:14.290
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Did I say next?"

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.890
"You want this package next day
or overnight?" I'm like ...

00:17:16.890 --> 00:17:18.870
"Overnight is next day."
"Overnight is not next day.

00:17:18.870 --> 00:17:20.710
Overnight means it will
reach there at 9:00am.

00:17:20.710 --> 00:17:22.320
Next day means it will
reach there the next day."

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:24.220
"If you would read the website
before you come here,

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:25.500
you wouldn't be wasting my time.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.760
Excuse me,
he is wasting your time

00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.010
because he did not read
the directions on the website.

00:17:31.010 --> 00:17:32.230
Excuse me. Thank you."

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:33.590
"You know what?
We're going to lunch."

00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:37.350
"Daniel Baker. Daniel Baker
is wasting your time."

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.110
"We're going to lunch now.
Close your window, girl."

00:17:40.110 --> 00:17:42.860
And then they shut the window.
Get the fuck outta here.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.050
I've done the thing before where
I've called Starbucks

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:49.099
because ...
I've called corporate before.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.080
Because I know they'll throw me
a free drink on the app.

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.350
It's very easy for them to do.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:56.770
You talk to someone online
and what you do is, you go,

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.870
"I'm a loyal customer.
I swear ..."

00:18:00.450 --> 00:18:02.530
You just present yourself
as someone ...

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:05.580
"I've spent a lot of money here.
And I will continue to-"

00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:07.380
I'm a good customer.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:09.030
I've never given
a man a shit job.

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:12.700
I just love your coffee."

00:18:13.450 --> 00:18:15.220
I give the finest handies.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.340
Is one free drink enough
to [inaudible]

00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:18.620
you?

00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:21.580
Yeah. Yeah.
'Cause that's five bucks.

00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:23.480
Do latte art?

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.490
$5 for coffee. I just ...

00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:29.870
I'm a lady that can
drop $5 on the street

00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:31.620
and it's not gonna pain me.

00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:34.930
I'm not in a position where
$5 is really that much money.

00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:37.940
But when you're spending
that much on a cup of coffee,

00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:41.810
I demand excellence.
I demand it.

00:18:41.810 --> 00:18:44.350
But here's the thing-
This is water and beans.

00:18:44.350 --> 00:18:46.250
I feel like she's making
a speech at the register

00:18:46.250 --> 00:18:48.880
and I'm like, "Damn,
I am not making this train."

00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.110
She demands excellence.

00:18:50.110 --> 00:18:52.060
Oh no I'm tweeting like,
"She demands excellence."

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:54.160
Only 'cause people
working at Starbucks, I'm like,

00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.780
"You're making minimum wage.
You have to ..."

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:57.430
And I've heard
the other side of it.

00:18:57.430 --> 00:18:59.170
Oh yeah, working at Starbucks.
It's awful. It is.

00:18:59.170 --> 00:19:00.440
It's awful, right?

00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:01.670
It's awful.

00:19:01.670 --> 00:19:03.760
I have so much empathy for
people who have to work with-

00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.960
And it was worse.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:06.570
'Cause it wasn't
a standalone Starbucks.

00:19:06.570 --> 00:19:08.570
It was a Starbucks
within a Barns &amp; Noble.

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:09.800
No.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:11.410
Which is the Starbucks
where people go

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:14.260
and they're obnoxious
and they order outlandish shit-

00:19:14.260 --> 00:19:16.170
Set up shop all day with it.
Reading all the books.

00:19:16.170 --> 00:19:17.940
And they're like
with 20 magazines.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:19.240
I'm like, "Fuck you."

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.390
And they leave shit,
they spill shit on books.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:22.740
Then it's my fault.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:23.960
Then the boss comes up
and he's like,

00:19:23.960 --> 00:19:25.420
"You know they're not supposed
to be reading up here?

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:27.110
You're supposed
to politely tell them

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:28.660
to move to a different area."

00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:30.030
I'm like, "Brah,
I'm not going ...

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:32.570
This guys has weird
looks on him.

00:19:32.570 --> 00:19:33.960
He has a thousand yard stare.

00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:35.200
And he's reading
40 Laws of Power-"

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:37.330
You shouldn't have to
privately scold people

00:19:37.330 --> 00:19:39.400
on top of serving coffee.
That's ridiculous.

00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:41.320
So what I did is,
I got high in the back

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.540
and I ate the entire
Snickers pie.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.990
So, fuck you.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:47.040
That's why we have no more
Barnes &amp; Nobles in New York.

00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.690
That one sad one
in Union Square.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:50.080
It's like ...

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.080
Everyone just goes there to use
the bathroom, and that's it.

00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.630
That's the only reason
to go to Barnes &amp; Noble.

00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:55.330
There's nothing better
than a Barnes &amp; Noble bathroom.

00:19:55.330 --> 00:19:57.650
That's why I'll always
complain about ...

00:19:57.650 --> 00:19:59.630
I'll complain about product,
but never service.

00:19:59.630 --> 00:20:01.630
'Cause I've been so terrible

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:03.560
at every single one
of my jobs that ...

00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.590
Just wildly fired
from every place.

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:08.040
And fired in like,
under four hours before.

00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.620
I'm like, "Who am I to complain
about service?"

00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.520
I once had a temp job,
and it was just a four day job

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.780
and it was just
answering phones.

00:20:13.780 --> 00:20:15.020
They called me on day two

00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.410
and said,
"You don't need to come back."

00:20:17.410 --> 00:20:19.440
They were like,
"It's not temporary enough."

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:22.360
I wasn't even working there.
I got fired from a temp job.

00:20:22.360 --> 00:20:24.040
But like, I understand
what you're saying.

00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.490
Service, I never complain.
When my dad does a thing ...

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:29.920
Dads never understand

00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:33.170
that it's not the waitress'
fault that food is late.

00:20:34.300 --> 00:20:36.320
It's so rarely
the waitress' fault,

00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.070
but they can not think
to the kitchen.

00:20:39.070 --> 00:20:40.280
They cannot fathom.

00:20:40.280 --> 00:20:41.500
They think she's the one
cooking it.

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:44.490
They really do. They really do.

00:20:44.490 --> 00:20:46.930
And I always try to explain it
is not her fault that ...

00:20:46.930 --> 00:20:48.580
And he goes,
"Well she's just waiting there."

00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:50.200
I go, "'Cause she's waiting
for the kitchen-"

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.770
For the fucking bell to ding!

00:20:51.770 --> 00:20:53.470
What is she supposed to do?

00:20:54.510 --> 00:20:57.320
But yeah. What jobs
have you been fired from?

00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.120
Four hours.
I mean, that's crazy.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:01.160
I was fired from a store called
Phat Shoes

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:03.040
and Clothes on Broadway
and I thought I was so cool-

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.280
Phat with a ph?

00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:05.490
Yeah. With a ph.

00:21:05.490 --> 00:21:06.920
Oh, hip-hop. Hip-hop.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.950
I thought that was truth
'cause I got that job.

00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:10.300
I remember it was
my first job in New York

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:11.500
and I thought
I was like a Beastie

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.200
Boy. I work on Broadway
in a place called

00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:14.430
Phat Shoes and Clothes-

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:15.680
Sabotage!

00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:17.510
Yeah, I was like definitely
get off my dick.

00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:18.750
I told everyone.

00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:21.010
"I'm working on Broadway.
Phat Shoes and Clothes.

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:25.770
Get right off my dick."
And it was so humiliating

00:21:25.770 --> 00:21:27.220
'cause I was telling
all my friends.

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:29.670
I was like,
"Don't call me as much.

00:21:29.670 --> 00:21:31.270
I'm working at Phat Shoes
and Clothes now.

00:21:31.270 --> 00:21:33.280
Give me some space."

00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:34.480
I don't have time.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.010
I have an early shift tomorrow
at Phat Clothes and Shoes.

00:21:37.010 --> 00:21:38.210
Phat with ph.

00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:40.390
I really did.
I felt I was in the Beastie ...

00:21:40.390 --> 00:21:42.160
In my mind,
I was like that's it.

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:44.960
And then it was
so humiliating

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:47.240
'cause I was fired
in under four hours.

00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.570
Damn.

00:21:48.570 --> 00:21:51.060
But basically, I was supposed to
get people to buy the clothes.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:52.260
I was like,
"I can't do that.

00:21:52.260 --> 00:21:53.490
I can't bother people
like that."

00:21:53.490 --> 00:21:55.000
That's the worst feeling
in the world-

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.640
"Can I help you?"

00:21:56.640 --> 00:21:58.440
Yeah. And bothering like,
"That looks good.

00:21:58.440 --> 00:22:00.230
You should buy that."
I can't ...

00:22:00.230 --> 00:22:03.220
And so, I was supposed to that.
And fold. I can't fold.

00:22:03.220 --> 00:22:07.830
My fold was a slovenly disaster.
He was so ... "Are you a woman?"

00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:10.700
He was so disgusted
with my folds. My folds were ...

00:22:10.700 --> 00:22:12.410
Right away I remember him
glaring at me like,

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:14.510
"She has suspicious,
heinous folding skills."

00:22:14.510 --> 00:22:16.470
"Who's this? I don't know.
She's using the board

00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:17.930
and she still
can't get it right."

00:22:17.930 --> 00:22:19.920
I couldn't! I used that dumb
cardboard-

00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:22.490
Fucking stupid board!
Fuck you board!

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:27.460
And fuck Intel and Loft.
[crosstalk]

00:22:27.460 --> 00:22:29.630
I feel so bad for people
in retail.

00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:31.870
[crosstalk]

00:22:31.870 --> 00:22:34.130
I worked inventory at Intel
and Loft.

00:22:34.130 --> 00:22:35.350
Noway!

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:40.110
Yeah. And then they got a guy
fired for scamming and stealing.

00:22:40.770 --> 00:22:43.860
And then they had to do
an instant promotion

00:22:43.860 --> 00:22:45.720
and they promoted the guy
with straight back cornrows

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:48.270
and gold fronts
to work the floor,

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:50.740
to where Anne Taylor blouses
and tell people,

00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:52.000
tell Hispanic Jewish women,

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:53.580
"You look great in this
floral length skirt,"

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:54.870
in the sale section.

00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:57.970
You know what I'm saying?
It was the worst shit ever.

00:22:57.970 --> 00:23:00.740
People are like,
"Well, this price tag

00:23:00.740 --> 00:23:02.320
doesn't match this price tag.
I'm switching."

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:04.900
I'm like, "You can't switch
price tags on shit."

00:23:04.900 --> 00:23:06.880
And I'm just overwhelmed.

00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.500
"Put me back
in inventory, please."

00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:10.540
I worked loss prevention
at the Gap

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.240
on 34th Street
during Christmas.

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.180
Oh no. What does that entail?

00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.910
First of all, everything
that happens

00:23:16.910 --> 00:23:18.540
is just continuous
Christmas music

00:23:18.540 --> 00:23:21.330
on a loop in the background.
Just Jingle Bells.

00:23:21.330 --> 00:23:24.330
Tackle a shop-lifter like,
"Jingle Bells."

00:23:24.330 --> 00:23:26.890
All we had to do was watch
to make sure

00:23:26.890 --> 00:23:30.940
the register from the basement
got to the security room.

00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:32.430
But the register
would be like $30000

00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:33.710
every time
they would take it out.

00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:34.970
So sometimes people
would try to tackle

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:36.180
the people
carrying the register.

00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.390
No way!

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:38.590
So you'd have to walk
behind them,

00:23:38.590 --> 00:23:40.580
then when they reached the room
you'd be like, "Touchdown."

00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:41.830
And were you watching
just to see

00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:43.040
if people were shoplifting too?

00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:44.830
No. You were just all
about the register.

00:23:44.830 --> 00:23:46.090
You'd see people
shoplifting and stuff

00:23:46.090 --> 00:23:47.390
and you couldn't do
anything about it.

00:23:47.390 --> 00:23:50.210
I'm like, "Take as many sweater
and as many pouches as you want.

00:23:50.210 --> 00:23:51.860
All I'm worried about
is this register over here."

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:53.550
So that was your only job,
was to watch the register?

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.750
Only had to ...
I did it for like a week,

00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:56.040
and then I had to quit.
Oh my ...

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:57.750
The Christmas music
was driving me insane.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:58.980
Oh my God.

00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.820
Here comes Santa Claus,
here comes Santa Claus ...

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:02.030
And I'm smelling the ...

00:24:02.030 --> 00:24:04.550
Remember when Gap had that
cologne that smelt like grass?

00:24:04.550 --> 00:24:05.760
Grass scent?

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:07.390
Yeah.
I loved grass.

00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:09.450
So immediately, I heard
the Christmas music,

00:24:09.450 --> 00:24:11.990
I smell grass,
I'm like oh my God.

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:15.050
And people were like, "Do you
have these chinos in a 34?"

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:16.620
I don't even know.
I don't work here.

00:24:16.620 --> 00:24:17.860
What are chinos?

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.430
Oh my God. Yeah.

00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:20.660
I was ...

00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.820
And it's funny,
they delegated me to be the guy

00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:30.770
to escort the cash register guy
to the deposit thing.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:32.900
Like, I'm running away.

00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.280
If this guys is getting robbed,
I'm out of here.

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.300
I'm not fighting
over $9.50 an hour.

00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:41.230
If the guy tripped with the bag,
I'm running out the store.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:42.700
I'm not ...
No smoke.

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.650
I'm on the chair like,
"Hope he lives."

00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:46.890
They like, "You big.
You go with him."

00:24:46.890 --> 00:24:48.100
I'm like, "No, no, no."

00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:49.770
Saw me walking in like,
"Everyone, give me your money."

00:24:49.770 --> 00:24:51.030
And I'm like,
"I don't really work here.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:52.320
I'm temp.
I'm just gonna leave."

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.020
I just cover the loss thing ...

00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:56.620
I don't know.
I don't know who this guy is.

00:24:56.620 --> 00:24:58.760
I'm just shopping.
I have no idea.

00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:03.120
The shoplifting thing ...
You realize anyone can shoplift.

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:04.560
They can't do anything
about it now.

00:25:04.560 --> 00:25:06.270
Yeah, but you always get that
one employee

00:25:06.270 --> 00:25:07.590
that wants to go a bit extra.

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:09.410
Maybe they tried out to be a cop
and didn't make it,

00:25:09.410 --> 00:25:11.290
and now they work
at Victoria Secret.

00:25:11.290 --> 00:25:13.110
"You're not getting out of here
with that pair of panties."

00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:14.310
Yeah.

00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.660
Just tase you on the middle
of 34 in the crowd.

00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:17.940
It's $5 panties.

00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.720
I've learned that
you can just ... They can't.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:22.740
They give up. They don't care.

00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:24.260
They don't care. No one cares.

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:26.600
The laws protect
the shoplifters.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.770
Thank God, the laws protect us.
They're on our side.

00:25:30.770 --> 00:25:32.500
All the rights are on
the side of the lifter.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.510
The one time I got,
the thing went off.

00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.840
And I've never
been caught since.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.620
But no.
The thing went off,

00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.450
and it beeped,
and the woman came up ...

00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:42.900
And I could have
just kept walking,

00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:44.690
'cause every time
it beeps you just go,

00:25:44.690 --> 00:25:46.850
"Oh, sorry."
It beeps all the time.

00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:48.670
You just walk out the same time
as someone else,

00:25:48.670 --> 00:25:50.940
and when they stop,
you keep moving.

00:25:50.940 --> 00:25:52.150
Oh.

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:54.170
That's how I worked
at Center 21.

00:25:54.170 --> 00:25:55.830
You just do this confused
look like,

00:25:55.830 --> 00:25:57.690
"Oh. I would never steal."

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:59.970
Which is what I do every time
when it does beep

00:25:59.970 --> 00:26:01.630
and I haven't stolen.
I just go, "Oh, weird!"

00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:03.830
Just give a confused
white girl shrug.

00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:07.630
Oh man, when you're guilty
and that beep happens.

00:26:07.630 --> 00:26:09.760
The color drains
from your face and away

00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.370
and you just freeze in a way

00:26:11.370 --> 00:26:12.690
that everyone knows
you're guilty.

00:26:12.690 --> 00:26:14.540
And then I ...
I think I wanted to get caught.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:16.990
You ever do that shrug
then take off sprinting?

00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:18.290
Yes. I should have.

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:19.780
I have the advantage
over all of you

00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:21.030
'cause as soon as it goes off,
they're like

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:22.420
"Beep beep beep,
let me see your bag."

00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:24.640
I'm like, "Why?
'Cause I'm black?"

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.240
And they're like,
"No sir, have a nice day."

00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.470
I'm gonna try that.

00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:30.060
And I just have a TV under
my arm I haven't paid for.

00:26:30.060 --> 00:26:31.440
I should try that.

00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:35.010
I'm here with my sister Nikki.
Me and her out shopping.

00:26:35.590 --> 00:26:38.220
We're protesting this store.
Shut down this Target.

00:26:38.220 --> 00:26:40.470
Oh my God.
I love you guys so much.

00:26:40.470 --> 00:26:43.950
Desus and Mero. You guys.

Shoplift outfit
to come to the show.

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:04.980
If I'm in town, I'll be there.

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:06.520
Can we do that?
Let's do a thing where me

00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.990
and you shoplift outfits
to go to the show.

00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:14.100
I would love that. I need to get
back into it anyway.

00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:18.980
Thanks for having us!
