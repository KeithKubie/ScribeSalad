00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:21.400
John Nash was a most peculiar
man-- an extraordinary man.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.930
And it will be the
purpose of this talk

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:26.990
to pay due attribute
to this man.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.090
And recall, as suggested by
this title, that what he did

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.050
was amazing or, to put it in
the words of the great geometer

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.320
Mischa Gromov, speaking of
an accomplishment of Nash,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.070
"It could not be true,
and it was true."

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.330
Let's explain what
Gromov meant by that.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.290
Here's a short biography
of John Forbes Nash.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.950
Born in Virginia, he
starts as an engineer

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.930
at heart, studies chemistry, but
eventually goes to mathematics.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.340
In 1948, he becomes a
student in Princeton.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:15.450
1949, 1950, he defends his
PhD, including in particular

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.210
the famous Nash equilibria.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.910
It's a two-page paper.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.750
From 1951 to 1958, he does
a first-order world-class

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:32.140
mathematical career in MIT,
Courant Institute, in New York,

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:33.710
and Princeton.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.900
And then he proved
some theorems which

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.090
are extraordinarily famous
among analysts and geometers--

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.730
embedding and continuity.

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:50.610
1959, history-- a sad history
of acute paranoid schizophrenia.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.250
And, around 1990, spontaneous,
progressive healing.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.860
1994, Nobel Prize in Economics,
while lived in Princeton.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.620
This slide was written
a few years ago,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.220
as I was for the first
time lecturing on Nash.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.280
And later on I will update
this, at the end of this talk.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.450
Here is a paradox.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.590
Maybe 95%, I know it's
subjective measurement

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.400
of Nash's fame is due to
game theory and his work

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.190
on the so-called
Nash equilibria--

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.070
famous in economics,
famous in biology.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.810
But is that not, to use
his own words, the least

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.790
of his accomplishments?

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.810
Should not Nash be
thought of as one

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.580
of the greatest analysts
in this century?

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.650
As Gromov said, he was combining
extreme analytical power

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.710
with geometric intuition.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:02.390
And the goal tonight is to focus
on the less-known story-- less

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.730
known than the game-theory
stuff-- to ask ourselves,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.590
what makes a value of
a mathematical result,

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.230
and to get behind the scene
of a famous and dramatic paper

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.415
of mathematical research.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:26.490
Let's get 60 years in the past,
at the moment when young Nash

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.680
arrives in Courant Institute.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.410
He's 28 years old.

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.060
His a, you know,
strongly built guy.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.660
He arrives in New York.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.070
And in New York, he arrives in
this famous-- already famous--

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.610
institute for advanced,
uh-- pride mathematics,

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.670
in some sense-- Courant
Institute, a place that,

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.560
after the Second
World War has reason

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.740
to extreme mathematical fame
and which is part of the world

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.730
history of mathematics.

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.460
As he arrives in
Courant Institute,

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.150
he's young but already
preceded by his legend.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:13.240
And Louis Nirenberg, one of
the most important people

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.430
in Courant Institute,
has a problem for him.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.410
Hey, young Nash is coming.

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:21.260
I know what I will ask.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.000
What was it that had
made Nash famous already?

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.810
Let's do a little bit of
flashback and talk about that.

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:35.790
What had made Nash famous
was the so-called isometric

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.850
embedding theorem.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.370
To motivate this, let
us say that geometry

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.380
can be done in several ways.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.710
Historically, geometry
is measuring the Earth

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:52.290
or making a map of the world.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:54.740
"Map of the world,"
we think of something

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.175
which is two-dimensional.

00:04:56.175 --> 00:04:59.100
You know, on a
sheet of paper, let

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.620
us draw the shape of the
continents and the rivers

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.530
and whatever.

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.990
But, as we understood,
as ancient Greeks already

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:11.500
understood, the
Earth is not flat.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.030
The Earth is spherical.

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:21.740
And, as was first observed at
the time of space exploration--

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:29.200
you know, the '60s-- the
Earth is indeed round.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.730
And somehow that
second view is simpler.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.390
The flat view is
more complicated.

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:39.930
Why more complicated?

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.890
Well, you have all kinds
of problems and paradoxes

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:47.510
when you want to represent
the world on a flat space.

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:51.660
Problems of the shapes
and, you know, the areas.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:56.610
If you look at the usual map
of the world, in a rectangle,

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.110
like, Antarctica
looks like it's huge!

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.470
And the countries
in center of Africa,

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.430
they look small, when
in fact they are huge

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.380
and Antarctica is not so big.

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:12.900
It's distortion, due to
the flat representation.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.112
There are other problems
which are interesting.

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.540
This is a picture which
I took some years ago,

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.420
in a hotel in Palestine.

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:30.590
And, as people who
traveled in some places

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.770
in the world in which
dominating region

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:39.470
is Islam, when you arrive in
a hotel you always have this.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.060
A qibla.

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.390
That's an arrow indicating
the direction of Mecca.

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:47.250
Because, if you're
a good Muslim,

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:51.140
that's the direction in
which you should pray.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.750
Now, my friends, what does it
mean, "the direction of Mecca"?

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.410
Well, viewed from here, it's OK.

00:07:01.410 --> 00:07:04.270
South, east.

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:08.190
But the answer is not
so OK, not so easy,

00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:10.437
if you are in any
part of the world.

00:07:10.437 --> 00:07:12.020
If you are in North
Pole, what does it

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:14.690
mean, "direction of Mecca"?

00:07:14.690 --> 00:07:16.970
It actually was a problem.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:20.480
It was one of the motivations
for development of geometry

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.810
in the Arab world-- at a time
in which European mathematicians

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.380
were complete amateurs, compared
to the Arabic and Persian

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:30.240
mathematicians.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.890
And here is a
problem, for instance,

00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:35.910
that really was a problem
when mosques started to be

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.570
built in the United States.

00:07:38.570 --> 00:07:43.960
Viewed from, say, New York,
which is direction of Mecca?

00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:49.030
And the answer is easy, if you
think of the Earth as a sphere.

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:51.190
Put it on your globe.

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:54.480
Say you take some
elastic string,

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:59.130
and you put one end in Mecca,
the other end in New York,

00:07:59.130 --> 00:08:02.250
and you see what is
the trajectory, there,

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:03.560
of the string.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.290
But if you look on
the planisphere,

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:06.920
it's not obvious at all.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.830
And the answer, if
you are in New York

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:11.080
and you want to go in
direction of Mecca,

00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.620
you have to face,
somehow, northeast.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.700
This is a thing that
people, some people,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:19.600
could never understand.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.480
Actually, there
were some incidents

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:24.610
with this in which some
embassy was involved

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.320
and, you know,
saying, you are crazy.

00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.390
Put it direction of south,
because it's south--

00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.890
No, no, no!

00:08:29.890 --> 00:08:32.169
But it's geodesic-- it's
shortest path-- and so on.

00:08:32.169 --> 00:08:33.549
I don't understand your thing.

00:08:33.549 --> 00:08:36.610
It's south-- it should
be south-- whatever.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:40.039
Now you know, with the
development of aviation,

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:40.909
it's obvious.

00:08:40.909 --> 00:08:43.409
You look at the
trajectories to go, say,

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:45.130
from Paris to New York.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:47.180
Has to be this way, you know?

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:49.440
It's a curved trajectory.

00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:51.575
And we know it's the best way.

00:08:51.575 --> 00:08:54.270
It looks as a curve, it
looks as a path which

00:08:54.270 --> 00:08:57.640
is not economic on the
plane, in two dimensions.

00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:00.750
But if you think of it as
a sphere, it makes sense.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:02.660
It's obvious that's
the way it should be.

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:05.360
So spherical
geometry, in a sense,

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.360
is more simple than plane
geometry, for that reason.

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.010
On the other hand,
plane geometry

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:16.880
is more economical, because
you just use two dimensions.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.750
While spherical geometry,
you need the three dimensions

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.720
to put your sphere in
something, in our space, which

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.360
is three-dimensional.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.710
So it seems that it demands
more information, the sphere.

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:32.610
So this is the kind of
dilemma that you have.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.010
Either work on a
simple geometry that

00:09:35.010 --> 00:09:39.640
requires "many" dimensions--
in this case, many three--

00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.280
or work with a
complicated geometry that

00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.340
requires few dimensions-- and,
in this case, "few" is two.

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.350
This is a problem that can
get much more complicated

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:53.190
than this, but this is the
essence of this problem, which

00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:55.870
geometers called "embedding."

00:09:55.870 --> 00:09:58.210
Embedding is like the
spherical representation,

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.550
because we think of
the sphere as part

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.530
of the three-dimensional
space, as embedded

00:10:04.530 --> 00:10:06.770
in the three-dimensional space.

00:10:06.770 --> 00:10:09.180
And, on the contrary,
the plane representation,

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:11.630
geometers would
call it "intrinsic,"

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:15.400
because it only uses
the two dimensions which

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.670
are intrinsic to the
surface of the sphere.

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:22.660
So, intrinsic, or embedded.

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:24.710
What is geometry?

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.310
Should it be intrinsic,
or should it be embedded?

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:30.890
It takes us back to
the problem of what

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:34.280
we want to do in geometry.

00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:37.710
At first, geometry
developed, you

00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:41.880
know, with the ancient Greeks
as a Euclidean geometry,

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:44.190
drawing figures that
you can draw in the sand

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:48.050
or on paper or on the
flat stone or whatever.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.830
But then people understood,
when you travel long distance,

00:10:50.830 --> 00:10:55.220
and so on, you need to
understand spherical geometry.

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:56.940
And then some people
say, after all, you

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.445
could do geometry on any
surface, not specially

00:10:59.445 --> 00:11:00.510
a sphere.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.380
Could be some weird thing.

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:07.720
And then people said, let's
work on any possible geometry

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:11.890
and devise a theory that
can encompass all of them.

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:14.970
And let's try,
also, to do things

00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:18.880
which withstand
deformation, things which

00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:22.030
are as intrinsic as possible.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:25.990
You know, if you take
a sheet of paper,

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:29.900
and you make a drawing
on your sheet of paper--

00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:31.170
this is my sheet of paper.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:33.450
I do some drawing on it.

00:11:33.450 --> 00:11:38.000
If I bend the sheet of paper,
from an embedding point of view

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.270
it will be very different,
but the figure, here,

00:11:42.270 --> 00:11:44.270
will remain the same.

00:11:44.270 --> 00:11:45.740
So, if I look at
it intrinsically,

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.850
it should be the same object.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:51.550
And geometry made
huge progress when

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:54.600
it started to think
in intrinsic terms,

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.710
even for curved geometries.

00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.460
This is related
to the development

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:04.880
of the non-Euclidean
geometries in the 19th century

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.460
and, in particular, the
so-called hyperbolic geometry,

00:12:08.460 --> 00:12:14.020
which was devised by people
like Gauss and Lobachevsky.

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.450
Hyperbolic geometry, like
the Euclidean geometry,

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:21.470
was a geometry in which
all points were equivalent.

00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:23.650
No privileged point.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:25.725
A sphere, also, is such
a geometry, you know?

00:12:25.725 --> 00:12:30.930
On a sphere, from any point
the sphere looks just the same.

00:12:30.930 --> 00:12:32.780
There are very
few geometry which

00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:34.940
have this property
of looking the same.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:37.660
And the hyperbolic
geometry is one like this.

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.880
But somehow it's the
inverse of the sphere.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:45.400
While the sphere is
always positively curved,

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.420
the hyperbolic plane is
always negatively curved.

00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:53.440
And it has some
weird properties.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:58.580
Here is an example of a picture,
in the hyperbolic plane,

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.650
of these lines which
are all geodesic lines,

00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:04.480
meaning "shortest path."

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.860
And we are making
it rotate, like we

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.560
would do to rotate a figure
by rotation in the plane.

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:14.640
See how unusual it looks.

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.760
Here is a famous rendition of
the hyperbolic geometry by MC

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.740
Escher, the famous artist.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.940
And, you see,
hyperbolic geometry

00:13:23.940 --> 00:13:26.100
is a geometry in
which units of length

00:13:26.100 --> 00:13:31.620
will change from place to place
in a plane representation.

00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:36.360
I told you, intrinsically
every point is the same.

00:13:36.360 --> 00:13:38.340
But when we represent
it on the plane

00:13:38.340 --> 00:13:41.250
we are forced to make it
having dimensions that

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:46.210
change from place to place,
so that, in this, each fish

00:13:46.210 --> 00:13:49.580
has the same length
as any other fish.

00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:52.510
This is hyperbolic geometry.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:57.470
And you may ask,
OK, but now, can I

00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:01.540
represent this hyperbolic
geometry in such a way

00:14:01.540 --> 00:14:04.590
that the distances
are not distorted,

00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:06.270
like I would do on the sphere?

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:09.580
Can I embed this
hyperbolic geometry

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:11.370
in our three-dimensional space?

00:14:11.370 --> 00:14:13.790
And this is a problem
which already tormented

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:16.860
Gauss, the early 19th century.

00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:19.370
And he thought, well,
there's a problem in there.

00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:21.210
There's a problem.

00:14:21.210 --> 00:14:25.120
And it was a huge progress when
Riemann, the student of Gauss,

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:29.520
said, let's not worry whether
it's embeddable or not.

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.940
Let's go on and work with
the intrinsic properties.

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:34.880
And we'll make
progress from this.

00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.330
And he defined the so-called
curvature which, to this day,

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.730
has remained the most
important tool used

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:44.240
by geometers to study
non-Euclidean geometries--

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:46.150
the Riemann curvature.

00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:49.500
Without Riemann curvature,
general relativity would never

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:52.310
have existed, and
an enormous amount

00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:55.250
of everything that we
see in image processing

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:58.950
could not exist, either.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:02.930
And Riemann set up the axiom
that we still use, to this day,

00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:05.590
to describe a
non-Euclidean geometry--

00:15:05.590 --> 00:15:08.580
the concept of
Riemannian manifold,

00:15:08.580 --> 00:15:12.630
which is a geometry
in which each point is

00:15:12.630 --> 00:15:17.604
in a neighborhood resembling
a distorted Euclidean space.

00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:23.790
This was a marvelous
achievement and one

00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:28.410
in which you say, let's forget
whether it can be embedded.

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:33.030
So we can treat much
more general situations.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:33.730
OK.

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:35.480
Looks much more general.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:37.095
Is it, really?

00:15:37.095 --> 00:15:40.084
Is it really more general
than embedded geometry?

00:15:40.084 --> 00:15:42.570
Hmm!

00:15:42.570 --> 00:15:47.120
Can one embed hyperbolic
space, for instance?

00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:49.250
Can we have a representation
of the geometry

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:52.050
that I showed you
which would be set

00:15:52.050 --> 00:15:56.000
in our three-dimensional
space without distortion?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.560
Answer is, no.

00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.980
We can have approximations.

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.160
We can have some
partial geometries

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.820
with some so-called
singularities, like crests,

00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:09.400
like on these representations.

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.580
This one, on the right top,
is called the "pseudosphere."

00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:17.010
Below it, it's called
[INAUDIBLE] surface.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:20.880
And, on the left
bottom corner is

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:23.026
called a "hyperbolic crochet."

00:16:23.026 --> 00:16:24.430
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:26.690
I have one here.

00:16:26.690 --> 00:16:30.520
Let's hand it over to you.

00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.540
And you may pass it from
people to people, OK?

00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:34.580
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:34.580 --> 00:16:36.720
That's a hyperbolic crochet.

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.220
You can distort it, and so
on, and reflect on the fact

00:16:40.220 --> 00:16:44.210
that every point of this
has the same geometry

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:46.980
properties as the others.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:49.040
And that they should
try to continue this

00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.860
for knitting and knitting.

00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:52.140
There are recipes from this.

00:16:52.140 --> 00:16:56.520
You'll find this online, how
to do hyperbolic crochet.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:59.510
If you try to make a very
large one, you will fail.

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:05.730
Such a knitting, such a crochet,
has to be rather limited.

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:09.010
And it was proven by some
of the famous mathematicians

00:17:09.010 --> 00:17:10.680
of 20th century.

00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.280
Hilbert, for
instance, proved it's

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:17.440
impossible to have a very
large hyperbolic crochet.

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:24.140
So, OK, this seems like,
yes, the embedded geometry

00:17:24.140 --> 00:17:25.720
is restricted.

00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:28.540
And there are some geometries
like the hyperbolic space that

00:17:28.540 --> 00:17:30.730
we cannot embed.

00:17:30.730 --> 00:17:33.080
No, no, no.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:35.900
And the mathematician
will tell you, OK,

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:39.790
we cannot embed it in our
three-dimensional space.

00:17:39.790 --> 00:17:42.280
But who said we need
three dimensions?

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:43.690
Let's dream!

00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.290
Let's embed it in a space
of four dimensions, maybe,

00:17:46.290 --> 00:17:49.290
or five, or six-- whatever.

00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:52.360
It was proven by Blanuša that you

00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:56.960
can embed hyperbolic
geometry, infinitely large,

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:59.820
in a six-dimensional space.

00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.940
So, in the end, it is embedded
geometry, all the same.

00:18:03.940 --> 00:18:08.046
But we just needed to
enlarge the point of view.

00:18:08.046 --> 00:18:11.440
And now you may say, is it
the same for any geometry?

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:12.710
So here's the rule.

00:18:12.710 --> 00:18:15.860
I give you an abstract
geometry-- an abstract surface,

00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:17.190
for instance.

00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:21.980
Can you find a Euclidean
space, a straight space,

00:18:21.980 --> 00:18:27.410
but possibly with 10 or 20
or 100 dimensions, in which I

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:30.580
can embed my
geometry such that it

00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:32.460
would be a part
of that geometry,

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:36.100
as the sphere is part of the
three-dimensional geometry.

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:39.100
And this was a problem
that stood open,

00:18:39.100 --> 00:18:42.990
ever since the time of Riemann.

00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:46.320
An old, respectable problem.

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.910
Now, let's go back to Nash.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:53.270
You have to understand that
Nash was not very humble,

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:54.260
as a young man.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:59.570
Nash was rather,
you know, annoying.

00:18:59.570 --> 00:19:06.250
And when he arrived in MIT,
one of his colleague, Ambrose--

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:09.910
a quite good mathematician--
became so annoyed

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:12.610
with Nash's arrogance-- like,
you know, I am a genius.

00:19:12.610 --> 00:19:14.130
I'm the best in here.

00:19:14.130 --> 00:19:16.950
OK, Wiener is good, but
I think I'm even better.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.060
And so on.

00:19:18.060 --> 00:19:20.330
And once he was so
angry, he told him, well,

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.150
if you're so good, why don't you
solve the isometric embedding

00:19:23.150 --> 00:19:25.400
problem?

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:26.970
Nash's reaction was, what?

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:28.990
What is this embedding problem?

00:19:28.990 --> 00:19:31.150
What is this about?

00:19:31.150 --> 00:19:34.720
And Nash was, like, thrilled.

00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:36.200
Oh, is this a difficult program?

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.060
Maybe I can become
famous by solving it.

00:19:40.060 --> 00:19:41.330
OK.

00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:43.010
So he checks, you
know, asking people

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:47.300
whether this is really a problem
that can make him famous.

00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.140
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.170
Starts working on it.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:52.800
Spends more than
two years on it.

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:56.450
Wow, he said, I will solve it,
I will solve it, et cetera.

00:19:56.450 --> 00:19:58.954
Here is my idea, here
is this, and so on.

00:19:58.954 --> 00:19:59.740
[EXHALE]

00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.560
Ambrose laughs at him.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:03.630
We have a letter
of Ambrose in which

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:06.420
he says to one of his
colleagues, well, there's Nash.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:08.580
"We've got him, and
we saved ourselves

00:20:08.580 --> 00:20:11.780
the possibility of having
gotten a real mathematician.

00:20:11.780 --> 00:20:14.220
He's a bright guy but
conceited as hell,

00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:18.590
childish as Wiener, hasty
as X, obstreperous as Y,

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.770
for arbitrary X and Y."

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:24.070
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:24.070 --> 00:20:26.612
This is mathematician
humor, you know?

00:20:26.612 --> 00:20:27.980
[LAUGHTER]

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.260
OK.

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:33.750
But now the thing is, Nash
did solve the problem.

00:20:33.750 --> 00:20:37.650
Not only one proof, but two
amazing proofs-- two amazing

00:20:37.650 --> 00:20:39.770
theorems that he got from it.

00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:42.850
Nonsmooth embedding,
smooth embedding.

00:20:42.850 --> 00:20:44.870
People were not even aware
there was an interest

00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:47.320
in nonsmooth embedding, here.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.770
He proved both.

00:20:48.770 --> 00:20:52.630
Let me explain a little
bit what it was about.

00:20:52.630 --> 00:20:55.430
First amazement was
the method of proof.

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.380
Here was an abstract
geometry question,

00:20:57.380 --> 00:20:59.435
you see-- general question.

00:20:59.435 --> 00:21:00.810
When you have a
general question,

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.040
in math, it's natural
to think it will

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:05.380
be solved by general reasoning.

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:07.940
Abstract question will be
solved by abstract proof.

00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:09.110
Not at all.

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:11.970
He solved it by
concrete analysis,

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.820
getting his dirty hands
into big calculations.

00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:16.660
And we'll get back to that.

00:21:16.660 --> 00:21:19.775
It was to anticipate a
little bit the same amazement

00:21:19.775 --> 00:21:24.040
as 50 years later, when Russian
genius Grigori Perelman solved

00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.660
the most famous
Poincare conjecture,

00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.730
about all possible shapes of
the three-dimensional universe--

00:21:29.730 --> 00:21:33.160
a very general question--
by some very hands-on and

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:38.940
technical calculations
and reasonings.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.930
Of Nash's proof,
Gromov said, it's

00:21:41.930 --> 00:21:44.510
"one of the first works which
made Riemannian geometry

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:47.910
simple-- an incredible
change of attitude

00:21:47.910 --> 00:21:49.880
on how to think of manifolds.

00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:54.720
You could manipulate them
with your bare hands."

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.380
This leads us to the
question, what is an analyst?

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:59.910
We asked the question,
what is geometry?

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:01.460
Now, what is an analyst?

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:02.780
What is analysis?

00:22:02.780 --> 00:22:06.660
You know, mathematicians
is not a single species.

00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:07.960
You have several [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:12.180
You have several subspecies
and subsubspecies and so on.

00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.730
Analysis can be compared
to fine cuisine.

00:22:16.730 --> 00:22:20.122
In Japanese it's the
same word, by the way.

00:22:20.122 --> 00:22:23.820
It needs fine tuning,
precise control.

00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:27.300
Analysts pride themselves on
the strength and sharpness

00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.304
of attack with simple
and powerful tools.

00:22:30.304 --> 00:22:31.720
We like to study,
in great detail,

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.250
functions-- signals-- often
unknowns, because they

00:22:35.250 --> 00:22:37.100
are solutions of problems.

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:39.530
And they ask how
fast they change.

00:22:39.530 --> 00:22:43.560
is it a small variation, a fast
variation, a big variation?

00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:47.490
Like stock exchange, will it
fluctuate very much, and so on?

00:22:47.490 --> 00:22:48.990
Et cetera.

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:51.370
Here are some
examples of functions.

00:22:51.370 --> 00:22:54.530
Some of them are
smooth-- slowly varying.

00:22:54.530 --> 00:22:56.960
Others are wild, and so on.

00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.380
Analysts spend
their life on this.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:04.150
Well, the main-- the
first tool of analysis

00:23:04.150 --> 00:23:07.450
are the derivatives--
the differentials.

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.990
This is the peak of variation.

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:11.630
This is a slope.

00:23:11.630 --> 00:23:15.510
And inventors of
this famously were

00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:21.360
Newton and Leibniz, who were
both geniuses and engaged

00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:25.320
in a horrible
battle, for the shame

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:28.640
of mathematical
community, in a sense.

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:32.600
But it was brilliant
what they did.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.660
You know, look at
this graph, there.

00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:39.260
If I drew the tangent
to the graph, which

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:41.980
is the line which
touches the graph,

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:45.320
and I look at the
slope of this line,

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.180
it will tell me
instantly what is

00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:53.360
the variation-- if it's growing
fast, or decreasing, and so on.

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.920
And when I have
this slope, I can,

00:23:56.920 --> 00:24:02.620
for any value of the variable,
plot the value of the slope

00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:05.230
and then look at the
slope of the slope.

00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:06.840
Which is a variation
of the variation,

00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.660
the second
derivative, and so on.

00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:11.190
And I can continue.

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:13.700
And the study of these
successive derivatives

00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:18.210
gives me strong information
about the way these functions

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.170
change.

00:24:19.170 --> 00:24:22.720
This is what people
call the "regularity."

00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.590
Derivative is easy
to understand.

00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:30.850
You know, 1% interest rate--
we understand this easily.

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:34.950
Second derivative, not so easy.

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:37.560
Starting from third
derivative, it's

00:24:37.560 --> 00:24:40.870
really difficult to get it.

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:44.900
Well, actually there is a famous
example of third derivative

00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.190
in political speech.

00:24:46.190 --> 00:24:50.620
This was Nixon, 1972,
when he announced publicly

00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:52.540
that the rate of
increase of inflation

00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.930
had started to decrease.

00:24:53.930 --> 00:24:55.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:24:55.330 --> 00:24:58.440
Which, as you may guess,
was not such great news.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:24:59.644
You know?

00:24:59.644 --> 00:25:04.950
And which, as you see, was
a good way to say things

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:07.600
are improving in a way
that nobody can understand.

00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:11.900
But for analysts,
it's no problem.

00:25:11.900 --> 00:25:13.180
We're used to this.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:17.050
We use arbitrary numbers of
derivatives-- or dimensions,

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:18.500
for that matter.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.282
Even fractional number of
derivatives is no problem.

00:25:22.282 --> 00:25:23.740
And the more
derivatives there are,

00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.100
the more the function is smooth.

00:25:26.100 --> 00:25:29.620
This is our daily
bread, and it can change

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:31.697
the conclusion of a problem.

00:25:31.697 --> 00:25:33.530
For instance, if you're
looking at a problem

00:25:33.530 --> 00:25:35.840
about fluid mechanics,
whether you're

00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:40.420
looking for smooth solutions
or nonsmooth solutions,

00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:43.250
it will change not only
the mathematical attack

00:25:43.250 --> 00:25:48.820
but the physical conclusion
of the problem, and so on.

00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:51.250
And, as a true
analyst, Nash revealed

00:25:51.250 --> 00:25:54.580
that, in that geometry
problem, the regularity

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.360
was very important.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:59.180
And, depending whether you're
looking for smooth embedding

00:25:59.180 --> 00:26:00.960
or nonsmooth
embedding, the answer

00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:02.910
could be completely different.

00:26:02.910 --> 00:26:08.120
Geometers had no
idea about this.

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:10.280
The proofs are incredible.

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:14.090
For instance, to construct
his nonsmooth embedding,

00:26:14.090 --> 00:26:16.765
Nash started by grossly
reducing distances,

00:26:16.765 --> 00:26:20.490
you know, in a way that was
certainly not an embedding

00:26:20.490 --> 00:26:23.310
and then increasing them
back, progressively,

00:26:23.310 --> 00:26:27.510
by some progressive
process, by spiraling.

00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:31.270
Looked like crazy idea.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:32.830
And from the smooth
embedding, he

00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.580
attacked an incredibly
difficult system

00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:38.480
of equations-- solutions, in
a sense, loses derivatives.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:40.160
That may not say
anything about this,

00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:43.220
except that it was
identified as a nightmare.

00:26:43.220 --> 00:26:47.230
And he understood that you
can counteract this nightmare

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:49.370
by a numerical
method which had been

00:26:49.370 --> 00:26:52.790
devised by Newton to solve
equations in a very, very

00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:54.170
fast way.

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:56.400
In one problem, it's
a regularity issue.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:59.030
In the other, it's like
a numerical problem--

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:00.310
finding solution.

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:03.400
But he understood he could
play one against the other.

00:27:03.400 --> 00:27:07.190
Nobody had a clue about this.

00:27:07.190 --> 00:27:08.680
The methods were founding.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.720
And the tools that he
introduced gave rise

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.230
to new, powerful theories
which later would be

00:27:14.230 --> 00:27:18.080
taught in mathematical classes.

00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.470
Even without referring
to the geometry problems

00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:23.040
that they had been
introduced to.

00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.840
It was not only solving problems
but finding new techniques

00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:30.190
to solve these problems.

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:33.510
And the conclusions were
powerful and amazing.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:35.580
Here is one of the things
that Gromov referred to

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:36.780
as "impossible."

00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:39.740
You may take a
sphere and crunch it,

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:44.760
without altering its geometry--
its intrinsic geometry--

00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:47.405
neither getting bumps, you know?

00:27:47.405 --> 00:27:51.340
Not like taking a hammer
and-- boc, boc, boc, boc.

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.460
There will be no bumps--
still, it will be crunched.

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.380
This is contradicting
our experience.

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.110
We know in some sense
that the sphere is rigid.

00:27:59.110 --> 00:28:01.800
But that transform
defies experience,

00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:03.110
because it is hardly smooth.

00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:05.380
Here is how it looks like.

00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:08.040
This is the way that
Nash-- or, rather, this

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:12.340
is how, a few years ago, a
team of mathematicians in Lyon

00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:16.100
represented what Nash had
proved to exist-- a way

00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.300
to embed the flat torus.

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.180
What is a flat torus?

00:28:20.180 --> 00:28:23.330
It's a geometry
that is well known

00:28:23.330 --> 00:28:27.256
to people of a certain age
who used to play Pac-Man.

00:28:27.256 --> 00:28:28.150
[LAUGHTER]

00:28:28.150 --> 00:28:31.130
You know Pac-Man--
it's like a square,

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:32.920
and there is some
labyrinth, whatever,

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:35.140
and there is your
Pac-Man, your body.

00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.480
And it goes, goes--
and when it goes out

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.300
in some direction it enters
back through the other side,

00:28:40.300 --> 00:28:41.280
you know.

00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.360
And when it goes this direction
and gets over the top,

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:46.590
it comes back from the bottom.

00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:50.550
This is known to mathematicians
as the "flat torus" geometry,

00:28:50.550 --> 00:28:54.960
a geometry in which you identify
left side and right side

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:57.180
and up with the down.

00:28:57.180 --> 00:29:00.590
And that geometry,
if you try to do it

00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:03.560
on a sheet of
paper-- hmm-hmm, OK--

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:05.120
let's identify this with this.

00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.200
Easy.

00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:08.250
I do like this.

00:29:08.250 --> 00:29:08.980
OK.

00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:10.530
And I glue this.

00:29:10.530 --> 00:29:13.740
And indeed, if my little
guy will go there,

00:29:13.740 --> 00:29:15.770
it will enter the
other side, et cetera.

00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:20.003
But now you try to
glue this to that.

00:29:20.003 --> 00:29:20.889
Mm-hmm!

00:29:20.889 --> 00:29:22.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:29:22.220 --> 00:29:23.420
Does not work.

00:29:23.420 --> 00:29:26.550
And you can prove
it doesn't work.

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:28.780
Well, Nash
[INAUDIBLE], my friend,

00:29:28.780 --> 00:29:33.250
it doesn't work if you'll
go for a smooth embedding.

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:34.760
But if you do it
in a clever way,

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.890
and that is the
clever way, it works.

00:29:37.890 --> 00:29:40.120
So that thing,
here, which nowadays

00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:44.770
is called a "smooth
fractal," looks like this.

00:29:44.770 --> 00:29:48.200
You see how it has tiny
structures and micro structures

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.650
and micro micro
structures and so on.

00:29:50.650 --> 00:29:53.920
But still it's not
irregular as a fractal.

00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:57.930
There is a derivative
at every place in there.

00:29:57.930 --> 00:29:59.680
And it is flat.

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:04.000
If you are a tiny,
tiny, microscopic being,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.940
living on the
surface of this, you

00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:10.650
would not distinguish-- you
will not feel that it is curved.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:13.856
For you, it will
be perfectly flat.

00:30:13.856 --> 00:30:16.870
It took years before
geometers digested

00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:20.400
these new things of Nash.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:25.120
And then came, two years later,
the great embedding theorem.

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.880
If you take an
abstract geometry,

00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:31.920
you may embed it in a very
smooth manner, much smoother

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:38.150
than this, but provided
you put enough dimensions.

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:41.200
In this, you only
needed three dimensions.

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.510
If you get it smooth, you cannot
make it in three dimensions,

00:30:44.510 --> 00:30:47.510
but you can do it in
a large-enough number

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:48.990
of dimensions.

00:30:48.990 --> 00:30:51.130
This was great achievement.

00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:53.620
And there, it solved
a problem which

00:30:53.620 --> 00:30:58.130
had been asked
something like 80 years

00:30:58.130 --> 00:31:02.520
before-- whether the point
of view of Gauss, embedded,

00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.040
and the point of
view of Riemann,

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.180
intrinsic, were
actually equivalent.

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:06.680
Answer?

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.410
They are.

00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:09.900
That was good.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.310
That was good, and,
as a result of this,

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:14.450
Nash had demonstrated
that he mastered

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.160
regularity better than anyone.

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.650
And that's the reason
why Louis Nirenberg, when

00:31:19.650 --> 00:31:21.830
he saw Nash arriving in
Courant Institute, thought,

00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:24.800
that's the guy to
solve my problem.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:28.090
It was for a problem of
regularity-- regularity

00:31:28.090 --> 00:31:31.000
of partial
differential equations.

00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.720
What are partial
differential equations?

00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:36.860
Partial differential
equations are equations

00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:40.620
about derivatives-- tangents.

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.850
But you know, in real
life a function doesn't

00:31:43.850 --> 00:31:45.635
depend on one variable.

00:31:45.635 --> 00:31:47.740
Depends on many variable.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:49.290
Take temperature, for instance.

00:31:49.290 --> 00:31:51.600
If you're interested
in meteorology,

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.870
temperature depends on
the time-- you know,

00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:58.262
this morning it was quite cold,
today it's better, and so on.

00:31:58.262 --> 00:32:02.660
It depends on the latitude and
the longitude and the altitude.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:05.050
Depends on four parameters.

00:32:05.050 --> 00:32:07.390
So you may compute the
derivative with respect

00:32:07.390 --> 00:32:09.620
to any of these parameters.

00:32:09.620 --> 00:32:11.630
Is it getting warmer
by the minute,

00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:13.540
or colder by the minute?

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:17.300
Is it getting warmer when I
get to the south-- et cetera.

00:32:17.300 --> 00:32:20.785
Partial derivatives capture
these, these tendencies

00:32:20.785 --> 00:32:23.250
with respect to the parameters.

00:32:23.250 --> 00:32:26.570
And this is a big
discovery of people,

00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:32.170
starting from the 18th century,
that almost any phenomenon you

00:32:32.170 --> 00:32:35.020
can think of
eventually is modeled

00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:38.000
by these partial differential
equations-- related

00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.610
to tendencies of the functions.

00:32:40.610 --> 00:32:42.820
For instance,
temperature in this room

00:32:42.820 --> 00:32:45.730
is a problem of partial
differential equations.

00:32:45.730 --> 00:32:47.510
Electric potential in our brain?

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:50.910
It's a problem of partial
differential equations.

00:32:50.910 --> 00:32:51.670
Whatever.

00:32:51.670 --> 00:32:52.620
You know?

00:32:52.620 --> 00:32:55.380
Control, understanding
the motion of fluids?

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:59.830
It's partial differential
equations, et cetera.

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:03.380
Here are some of the most famous
partial differential equations.

00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:05.090
I don't want you
to understand them,

00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:09.010
but first you may appreciate
how beautiful they are.

00:33:09.010 --> 00:33:10.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.200
This here is Boltzmann equation.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:14.947
Gosh-- I spent 10 years
of my life on this!

00:33:14.947 --> 00:33:15.446
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:15.446 --> 00:33:18.590
This describes the
evolution of a gas.

00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:25.870
Was first devised by James Clark
Maxwell and Ludwig Boltzmann

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:30.150
and changed the face
of theoretical physics.

00:33:30.150 --> 00:33:33.210
This here is the
Vlasov equations.

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.900
Tells us about the evolution
of a galaxy, for instance,

00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:38.620
over billions of years.

00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:41.080
This one, on the
contrary, is so, so small.

00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.440
Schrodinger equation, the
basis of quantum mechanics.

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:48.850
This one, actually,
when you go to Paris

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:52.010
you may visit a public place
in which it is engraved.

00:33:52.010 --> 00:33:54.870
It's in the Paris subway.

00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:57.830
The sculpture, in station
Chatelet-Les Halles--

00:33:57.830 --> 00:34:01.100
I like it, because every day
probably hundreds of thousands

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:06.260
of people pass near this
without noticing whatsoever

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.583
that there is the Schrodinger
equation on there.

00:34:08.583 --> 00:34:09.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:09.550 --> 00:34:10.480
You know?

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:14.620
Like a metaphor of the
fact that we are surrounded

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:16.510
by these marvelous
equations around

00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:19.780
us without us noticing this.

00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.860
Here is some other couple ones.

00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:25.570
These are the equations
of fluid mechanics.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:29.670
Euler equation,
Navier-Stokes equations.

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:37.800
They changed everything in our
technology, or many things.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.510
They are solved every day
to predict the weather.

00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:46.500
They are used at enormous
length by the Hollywood industry

00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.469
to make all kinds of special
effects in the movie theaters.

00:34:50.469 --> 00:34:52.310
Go to see Titanic
or whatever-- it's

00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:56.070
full of resolutions of
these partial differential

00:34:56.070 --> 00:34:58.653
equations of fluid mechanics.

00:34:58.653 --> 00:34:59.960
OK.

00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.890
And here's another
one, which was

00:35:02.890 --> 00:35:07.100
solved by other mathematical
genius, Alan Turing,

00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:10.776
to understand the problems
of pattern formation

00:35:10.776 --> 00:35:13.370
on the skins of animals.

00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:19.070
And here is another one, which
was used by Joseph Fourier,

00:35:19.070 --> 00:35:21.080
in the 19th century,
to understand

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:28.290
the evolution of temperature--
say, in a block of iron.

00:35:28.290 --> 00:35:29.420
Here it is.

00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:30.800
Heat equation.

00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:33.507
It's a very famous partial
differential equations

00:35:33.507 --> 00:35:35.590
and, when you take courses
in partial differential

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:39.150
equations, one of the
first that you study.

00:35:39.150 --> 00:35:44.490
It's about temperature in a
block of metal, conducting.

00:35:44.490 --> 00:35:48.100
On the left is the
time derivative--

00:35:48.100 --> 00:35:50.850
the tendency of the temperature
with respect to time.

00:35:50.850 --> 00:35:53.710
Is it getting warmer, or colder?

00:35:53.710 --> 00:35:56.480
And on the right, there
is the space derivative--

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:59.860
and, actually, two
space derivatives.

00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:01.920
The tendency of the
tendency, in respect

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.660
to the spatial variable.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.170
And there is a coefficiency.

00:36:08.170 --> 00:36:09.860
It's the conductivity.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:14.740
Or, to be more rigorous,
thermal diffusivity.

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.020
They are in relation
of each other.

00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.040
Because, you know,
some materials--

00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:22.660
in some materials, the
heat is easy to transmit,

00:36:22.660 --> 00:36:25.232
in some others
difficult to transmit.

00:36:25.232 --> 00:36:25.732
OK.

00:36:28.290 --> 00:36:30.490
When you have a
conductivity that changes

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:36.650
from place to place-- say,
in a mixture of two metals--

00:36:36.650 --> 00:36:40.050
the distribution of heat can
become quite complicated.

00:36:40.050 --> 00:36:44.390
The equation is more complicated
than the solution, though.

00:36:44.390 --> 00:36:48.230
You cannot compute it exactly,
then, but you can study it.

00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:49.620
Let me show you some examples.

00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:57.370
Here's an example
in which you have

00:36:57.370 --> 00:37:03.680
a heat distribution in a metal
bar-- hot, cold, hot, cold.

00:37:03.680 --> 00:37:05.230
You see this is x.

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:07.540
This is, like, the
distance to the origin.

00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:12.520
And initially you heat
some places and see

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:14.210
how it evolves with time.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:16.160
You let it cool down.

00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:16.880
Look carefully.

00:37:21.210 --> 00:37:26.090
This is the evolution of
temperature, as time goes.

00:37:26.090 --> 00:37:28.260
At the beginning, I
had several bumps.

00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:31.660
Now I only have one.

00:37:31.660 --> 00:37:34.420
It's getting a bit boring,
because the evolution at first

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:36.720
was very first and
now it's very slow.

00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:38.620
That's one of the first
things that we learn

00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:41.050
when we study heat equation.

00:37:41.050 --> 00:37:44.450
Starts first and
then becomes slow.

00:37:44.450 --> 00:37:47.980
Other things that we learn is
that, even if globally it's

00:37:47.980 --> 00:37:51.461
cooling down, some places are
cooling down-- others are not,

00:37:51.461 --> 00:37:51.960
initially.

00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:56.540
Look at this hot spot
and this cold spot.

00:37:56.540 --> 00:38:01.570
After just a moment, the
hot spot is becoming colder,

00:38:01.570 --> 00:38:04.330
but the cold spot
is becoming warmer--

00:38:04.330 --> 00:38:08.130
until there is some
kind of equilibration,

00:38:08.130 --> 00:38:12.316
and then they start
to get decreasing.

00:38:12.316 --> 00:38:13.800
OK.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.920
Another thing that we
learn in these courses

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:20.200
is that heat equation
regularizes things.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:22.410
It makes you smoother.

00:38:22.410 --> 00:38:24.530
Look here.

00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:25.160
Is it smooth?

00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:26.630
Well, not much.

00:38:26.630 --> 00:38:29.450
You see these strong
variations, wild variations,

00:38:29.450 --> 00:38:32.650
of the slope--
changes completely.

00:38:32.650 --> 00:38:35.740
But look after a
fraction of a second.

00:38:35.740 --> 00:38:36.730
It has a smooth.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:39.470
You know, as a
mountain gets eroded,

00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:44.238
heat equation does some
kind of erosion on the data.

00:38:44.238 --> 00:38:47.920
This is the regularizing
effect of the heat equation.

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:50.030
OK.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.420
This simulation, here, is for
a constant-- the homogeneous

00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:54.610
metal bar.

00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:57.200
Let's now look at another
one, in which it would

00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:00.540
be a mixture of various metals.

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.310
And let's also start with
initial data of temperature

00:39:03.310 --> 00:39:06.460
that is crazy-- you know,
hot, cold, hot, cold--

00:39:06.460 --> 00:39:08.620
completely crazy.

00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.964
Look what happens
after a few seconds.

00:39:11.964 --> 00:39:17.050
Ah, not so smooth, but better.

00:39:17.050 --> 00:39:19.970
And, you know, here it
was quite discontinuous.

00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:22.270
But here, continuous.

00:39:22.270 --> 00:39:24.180
And better and better.

00:39:24.180 --> 00:39:26.580
We see it's not as
regularized as it

00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:31.640
was with the homogeneous metal
bar, but still not so bad.

00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.060
So you have some
regularization effect.

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:38.760
At least, that was
the conjecture.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.040
And that is exactly
what Nirenberg wanted

00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:44.070
Nash to prove with mathematics.

00:39:44.070 --> 00:39:47.280
Take any alloy-- you
know, any mixture

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:53.750
of metals-- in any
geometry, in any dimensions,

00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:57.420
and any distribution
of heat, initially.

00:39:57.420 --> 00:39:59.640
And let it act
for a few seconds.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.840
Will it become smooth?

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.570
It may seem like a
very specific problem,

00:40:04.570 --> 00:40:06.160
but this was an
important problem

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.720
because it was a key problem
to understand a whole class

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:12.440
of related problems, you know?

00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:19.300
And so Nirenberg explained
this to Nash, and Nash-- ha!

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:21.532
How to do this?

00:40:21.532 --> 00:40:24.170
OK.

00:40:24.170 --> 00:40:27.520
This is what I was
just explaining to you.

00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.325
And this is the
mathematical statement.

00:40:29.325 --> 00:40:33.600
So, if temperature of time
and x is a heat distribution

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.450
in a medium with discontinuity
conductivity-- you know,

00:40:36.450 --> 00:40:39.440
any mixture-- and a
discontinuous initial

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:42.450
distribution of temperature,
after one second,

00:40:42.450 --> 00:40:45.450
will the temperature
be continuous?

00:40:45.450 --> 00:40:47.310
This is the problem.

00:40:47.310 --> 00:40:50.770
And Nash is very
interested-- also

00:40:50.770 --> 00:40:53.180
check that he can
became famous for this.

00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:54.340
[LAUGHTER]

00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.850
And starts working on this.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:40:58.500
Starts working on
this, gets started,

00:40:58.500 --> 00:40:59.541
and works on the problem.

00:40:59.541 --> 00:41:03.520
It's fascinating, because we
have accounts and testimonies

00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.700
on how he worked on it.

00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:07.690
Going and meeting
the people, you

00:41:07.690 --> 00:41:09.680
know, betting back to
Nirenberg-- tell me more

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:10.180
about it!

00:41:10.180 --> 00:41:11.388
I want to know this and this.

00:41:11.388 --> 00:41:13.450
And is it true that
this and that and that?

00:41:13.450 --> 00:41:16.940
Nash was not a specialist
at all of that--

00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:20.100
of mathematical physics--
diffusion equation.

00:41:20.100 --> 00:41:21.730
Had no idea.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:25.120
And then he went to see other
people-- people in Princeton,

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:26.240
people in New York.

00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.180
Hey, I heard that you
are specialist of this.

00:41:28.180 --> 00:41:30.300
Can you explain me
this, that, and that?

00:41:30.300 --> 00:41:33.300
And at first his questions
were quite stupid, you know?

00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:36.260
Like, he was an outsider,
not knowing about this.

00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:38.250
And Nirenberg was
starting to wonder, hey,

00:41:38.250 --> 00:41:41.090
is this guy as
smart as they said?

00:41:41.090 --> 00:41:44.620
And, little by little, questions
were becoming more and more

00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:45.790
to the point.

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:48.610
And he was putting everybody
through contribution

00:41:48.610 --> 00:41:49.920
as a conductor, you know?

00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:53.550
Hey, my friend, I need you
to prove me this and this.

00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:57.060
I think that you are the expert,
and you can give me this.

00:41:57.060 --> 00:42:00.010
I can use it to prove
something more-- and so on.

00:42:00.010 --> 00:42:03.130
As a conductor who would
give assignments-- you know,

00:42:03.130 --> 00:42:06.170
here, you're the violin player--
will play this and this.

00:42:06.170 --> 00:42:07.180
You are the trumpet.

00:42:07.180 --> 00:42:08.700
You will play this and this.

00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:09.980
Each one does their part.

00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:11.850
Nobody understands
the great plan,

00:42:11.850 --> 00:42:14.850
except when the
orchestra starts to play.

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:17.730
And Nash had the
overall plan for this.

00:42:17.730 --> 00:42:20.460
And everybody was amazed
when, after six months,

00:42:20.460 --> 00:42:22.640
the problem was solved.

00:42:22.640 --> 00:42:25.240
Putting all people
to contributions.

00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:29.560
And, again, the
solution was amazing.

00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.010
Let's examine this
famous paper that he

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:34.980
wrote from there-- one
of the most famous papers

00:42:34.980 --> 00:42:38.710
in the 20th century-- partial
differential equations.

00:42:38.710 --> 00:42:42.230
"Continuity of Solutions
of Parabolic and Elliptic

00:42:42.230 --> 00:42:43.930
Equations," by John Nash.

00:42:43.930 --> 00:42:47.740
And now you understand
what it was about.

00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:54.360
1958, 24 pages-- rather short.

00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:59.560
By current standards,
very short.

00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.870
It's interesting to read
what he thought about this.

00:43:01.870 --> 00:43:04.330
"The open problems in the
area of nonlinear partial

00:43:04.330 --> 00:43:07.290
differential equations are very
relevant to applied mathematics

00:43:07.290 --> 00:43:09.970
and science as a
whole, perhaps more so

00:43:09.970 --> 00:43:13.220
than the open problems in any
other area of mathematics,

00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:16.380
and this field seems poised
for rapid development.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:20.300
It seems clear, however, that
fresh methods must be employed.

00:43:20.300 --> 00:43:23.180
We hope this paper contributes
significantly in this way

00:43:23.180 --> 00:43:26.310
and also that the new methods
used in our previous paper

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:27.480
will be of value."

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:31.210
That was absolutely true.

00:43:31.210 --> 00:43:33.550
"Little is known about
the existence, uniqueness,

00:43:33.550 --> 00:43:37.040
and smoothness of solutions of
the general equations of flow

00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.070
of a viscous, compressible,
and heat-conducting fluid."

00:43:40.070 --> 00:43:41.950
It's still true.

00:43:41.950 --> 00:43:44.450
Almost 50 years
after what he wrote,

00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:50.760
we are still in the dark about
some basic features about this.

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:53.950
The style was informal and
informative-- very interesting.

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:56.930
You know, he doesn't suggest
this and that and that.

00:43:56.930 --> 00:43:59.650
He also says about key results.

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:03.360
Also tells you what he
had to work hard on.

00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:05.990
And he also says things
like "This is dimensionally

00:44:05.990 --> 00:44:09.050
the only possible form for
a bound"-- reasoning a bit

00:44:09.050 --> 00:44:10.520
like a physicist.

00:44:10.520 --> 00:44:13.190
He speaks of "dynamic
inequalities."

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:15.180
What does it mean, a
"dynamic inequality"?

00:44:15.180 --> 00:44:17.300
Well, you know, it's to
convey some impression.

00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.560
It's precious.

00:44:18.560 --> 00:44:21.580
Or "powerful
inequality"-- et cetera.

00:44:21.580 --> 00:44:24.170
"The methods here were
used by physical intuition,

00:44:24.170 --> 00:44:26.140
but the ritual of
mathematical expression

00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:29.760
tends to hide this
natural basis."

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:34.100
He doesn't want just people
to see right through.

00:44:34.100 --> 00:44:37.120
He wants them to understand
how he got into this.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.020
Very generously, actually.

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.300
The notions were unexpected.

00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:45.010
He was thinking of the solution
of the heat equation in terms

00:44:45.010 --> 00:44:47.910
of statistical mechanics,
with temperature

00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:49.940
being like density of matter.

00:44:49.940 --> 00:44:53.350
As if there was such a
thing as atoms of heat.

00:44:53.350 --> 00:44:55.490
Doesn't exist, the atom of heat.

00:44:55.490 --> 00:44:59.220
But let's think
like it's this way.

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:01.970
And he used the entropy
solution of disorder

00:45:01.970 --> 00:45:04.610
used by Boltzmann,
and later by Shannon,

00:45:04.610 --> 00:45:07.600
to measure the disorder
or microscopic uncertainty

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.620
of that temperature.

00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:12.060
From physical point
of view, this quantity

00:45:12.060 --> 00:45:15.670
minus integral of T
log T makes no sense.

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:19.600
It would make sense, you
know, if T was, like,

00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.110
a density of matter.

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:24.020
But there's no such
thing, as I said,

00:45:24.020 --> 00:45:27.906
as matter-- as a particular
associated to temperature.

00:45:27.906 --> 00:45:30.220
But it works.

00:45:30.220 --> 00:45:32.910
In a radically unusual context.

00:45:32.910 --> 00:45:37.090
And he used this
notion in a context

00:45:37.090 --> 00:45:41.770
which is very different from
the one it was introduced for.

00:45:41.770 --> 00:45:43.630
And he demonstrated,
with his proof,

00:45:43.630 --> 00:45:46.940
the power of differential
inequalities,

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:51.610
that these inequalities between
slopes of various quantities,

00:45:51.610 --> 00:45:54.580
involving simple quantities
containing information,

00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:57.420
in some sense.

00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.540
It was, a bit, the same
amazement as the one that

00:46:00.540 --> 00:46:04.820
Grigori Perelman, again, would
generate when he showed that,

00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:07.770
to solve the Poincare
problem of geometry,

00:46:07.770 --> 00:46:10.170
it was useful to
introduce some entropy. .

00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.720
This was a masterpiece
in several parts.

00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:20.360
Let me not go into details
but very rapidly say

00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:23.390
that it was like first act
was about understanding

00:46:23.390 --> 00:46:25.820
displacement of what
would be something

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:28.150
like an atomic sort of heat.

00:46:28.150 --> 00:46:32.410
Like a Brownian motion, like
a particle of temperature.

00:46:32.410 --> 00:46:34.130
And, through them,
the temperature

00:46:34.130 --> 00:46:37.610
was neither too
low nor too strong.

00:46:37.610 --> 00:46:40.360
That contributions of
sources of temperature

00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:42.490
would overlap, in some sense.

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:44.180
That, if two point
sources are closed,

00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:45.800
then the resulting
heat distributions

00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:48.520
are closed too, and
the decontinuity.

00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:54.090
And each of these steps has
precise mathematical statement.

00:46:54.090 --> 00:46:57.000
You know, in the
ideal of mathematics

00:46:57.000 --> 00:47:00.840
the Holy Grail is to have
a nice, beautiful proof.

00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:05.000
And we get this concept as a
legacy of the Ancient Greeks,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.780
and geometry in particular.

00:47:06.780 --> 00:47:08.710
This implies this
from that, et cetera.

00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:11.420
They like playing with this,
but the-- like, the bricks

00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:12.770
are not triangles and lines.

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:14.684
These are, like,
qualitative properties

00:47:14.684 --> 00:47:15.725
of the heat distribution.

00:47:18.292 --> 00:47:19.750
Let me skip this,
even though these

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:21.860
were some of the inequalities.

00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:26.420
And let's focus on
one thing, here.

00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:29.470
You see, what is written
here is Nash's inequality,

00:47:29.470 --> 00:47:32.290
in the middle of this slide.

00:47:32.290 --> 00:47:35.756
Everybody in analysis knows
this is Nash's inequality.

00:47:35.756 --> 00:47:37.130
Truth is-- and
it's clear, if you

00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:41.630
read the paper by Nash-- Nash
did not prove this inequality.

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:44.880
He asked one of his
colleagues, named Stein,

00:47:44.880 --> 00:47:46.550
to prove the inequality.

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:48.880
Stein was an expert in
this kind of things.

00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:50.061
You want this inequality?

00:47:50.061 --> 00:47:50.560
Yeah.

00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.650
Let me prove it for you.

00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:52.730
Here is how you do it.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:53.930
Thank you.

00:47:53.930 --> 00:47:56.440
And Nash showed how to use
it in that problem of heat

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:57.980
distribution.

00:47:57.980 --> 00:48:04.330
He was genius in this kind of
integrating the various parts.

00:48:04.330 --> 00:48:06.360
And of on.

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:08.804
Let's skip this-- also this.

00:48:08.804 --> 00:48:10.220
He got from another
guy, actually,

00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:13.780
this one, from his colleague
Carlson, who introduced him

00:48:13.780 --> 00:48:17.750
to the concept of entropy
after he had studied that

00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:20.460
from his colleague [INAUDIBLE],
who had been specialist

00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:21.450
of Boltzmann equation.

00:48:21.450 --> 00:48:24.120
That was the style of Nash,
taking this idea here,

00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.250
that idea there.

00:48:25.250 --> 00:48:26.710
Mmm-- I think they are linked.

00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:27.530
I will use them.

00:48:27.530 --> 00:48:28.704
And so on.

00:48:28.704 --> 00:48:29.495
This was brilliant.

00:48:33.150 --> 00:48:36.080
[INAUDIBLE] Hollywood
and movie, after that

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:37.550
would be the big celebration.

00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:40.670
I don't know-- Nash would have
married a beautiful heroine

00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:42.170
or whatever.

00:48:42.170 --> 00:48:44.640
It was not this way.

00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:46.840
The celebration was lost.

00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:50.680
In 1957, Nash heard that
a young, unknown Italian

00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:53.550
mathematician, Ennio de
Giorgi, proved the same result

00:48:53.550 --> 00:48:56.220
by a different method.

00:48:56.220 --> 00:49:01.560
To all mathematicians, this
would become as the, you know,

00:49:01.560 --> 00:49:05.490
schoolbook example,
textbook case,

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:08.920
of simultaneous discovery--
by different people,

00:49:08.920 --> 00:49:11.240
at the same time, with
different methods.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:13.430
Di Giorgi was completely
unknown at that time.

00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:16.310
He was eccentric, he was
monachal, he was genius.

00:49:16.310 --> 00:49:18.820
He would become a living legend.

00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:23.390
His proofs set the standard
for generations of experts.

00:49:23.390 --> 00:49:25.900
Nash, in spite of
being so bright,

00:49:25.900 --> 00:49:28.320
was in pathological
need of recognition

00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.980
and attributed to
this coincident

00:49:29.980 --> 00:49:32.390
his failure to get
the 1958 Fields

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:35.500
Medal, which went to French
mathematician Rene Thom.

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.080
The epilogue was sinister.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:45.360
Nash's paper was accepted in
Acta Mathematica, arguably

00:49:45.360 --> 00:49:49.050
the best journal in the
world, in those days-- maybe

00:49:49.050 --> 00:49:51.040
nowadays, also.

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:54.170
And after it was
accepted he withdrew it.

00:49:54.170 --> 00:49:56.110
Which is unheard of,
you know, if your paper

00:49:56.110 --> 00:49:58.760
is accepted in such a
journal, to withdraw it.

00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:02.280
And he sent it to the American
Journal of Mathematics-- maybe

00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:04.730
the most famous paper in the
history of American Journal

00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:08.810
of Mathematics-- in the hope
of getting the Bocher prize,

00:50:08.810 --> 00:50:14.130
1959, a prize which had to go
to a paper published in there.

00:50:14.130 --> 00:50:15.550
OK.

00:50:15.550 --> 00:50:16.570
In vain.

00:50:16.570 --> 00:50:20.030
It was Nirenberg who
got the prize that year!

00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:22.110
For some other work.

00:50:22.110 --> 00:50:24.010
Hmm!

00:50:24.010 --> 00:50:27.320
Nash actually is already
undergoing paranoid delirium

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.350
in there-- the start
of a long tragedy

00:50:30.350 --> 00:50:35.490
and more than two decades
of going mental hospital,

00:50:35.490 --> 00:50:39.650
at times, having some relapse
and some clear thoughts,

00:50:39.650 --> 00:50:42.760
at other times being
completely miserable-- haunting

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:48.220
the corridors of Princeton,
talking nonsense, whatever.

00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:50.285
Meanwhile his papers will
make their revolution.

00:50:52.930 --> 00:50:55.640
To Louis Nirenberg, in
1980, somebody asked,

00:50:55.640 --> 00:50:58.110
do you know mathematicians
that you can consider geniuses?

00:50:58.110 --> 00:51:00.390
And Nirenberg answered
"I can think only of one,

00:51:00.390 --> 00:51:03.080
and that's John Nash."

00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:08.500
In 2011, to a young, brilliant
Princeton mathematician,

00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:11.105
John Pardon, somebody
in an interview

00:51:11.105 --> 00:51:13.480
asked, who is your favorite
Princetonian, living or dead,

00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:17.136
and he answered
"Probably John Nash."

00:51:17.136 --> 00:51:22.590
In 1994 as he had been out
of his mental condition,

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:26.870
Nash was awarded a Nobel prize
in Economics for his PhD,

00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:31.740
for that two-page paper in which
he defined the Nash equilibria.

00:51:31.740 --> 00:51:32.890
Here is the situation.

00:51:32.890 --> 00:51:34.790
OK, you know it's not
really the Nobel prize.

00:51:34.790 --> 00:51:37.290
It's the Sveriges Riksbank
Prize in Economic Sciences

00:51:37.290 --> 00:51:40.670
in memory of Alfred Nobel,
awarded jointly to-- et cetera,

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:43.540
et cetera-- including John Nash
"for their pioneering analysis

00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:47.180
of equilibria in the theory
of noncooperative games."

00:51:47.180 --> 00:51:52.180
Looked like Nash's genius
had been recognized at last.

00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:56.560
2001, it was the
movie Beautiful Mind.

00:51:56.560 --> 00:52:01.020
So this is Russell Crowe,
playing the role of Nash.

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:02.940
I'm not sure he understands
anything of what's

00:52:02.940 --> 00:52:04.023
written on the blackboard.

00:52:04.023 --> 00:52:07.180
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:09.020
I can recognize these
are the equations

00:52:09.020 --> 00:52:11.590
of isometric embedding.

00:52:11.590 --> 00:52:14.480
The film beautifully manages
to massacre everything

00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.470
in the life of Nash.

00:52:15.470 --> 00:52:16.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:16.270 --> 00:52:20.480
The chronology's wrong, the
nature of the mental condition

00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:24.890
is wrong, the nature of the
science contributions is wrong.

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:26.270
It's amazing how
the film manages

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:27.850
to get it wrong on all points.

00:52:27.850 --> 00:52:29.810
Brilliant.

00:52:29.810 --> 00:52:32.400
Nash hated every single
bit of the movie.

00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:38.225
But interestingly, his
wife-- his wife Alicia--

00:52:38.225 --> 00:52:43.330
found it was lovely to be played
onscreen by Hollywood beauty

00:52:43.330 --> 00:52:44.678
Jennifer Connelly.

00:52:44.678 --> 00:52:46.900
[LAUGHTER]

00:52:49.460 --> 00:52:51.910
Now, for
mathematicians, it still

00:52:51.910 --> 00:52:55.940
remained as a problem, you
know, that Nash's genius had

00:52:55.940 --> 00:52:58.020
been recognized in
economics but not

00:52:58.020 --> 00:53:01.980
for his truly beautiful
mathematical work related

00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:05.030
to the geometry and analysis.

00:53:05.030 --> 00:53:08.220
And little by little came
this public recognition.

00:53:08.220 --> 00:53:13.620
2009 was a big splash, when
Nash's ideas led Camillo De

00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:17.060
Lellis and Laszlo Szekelyhidi,
bright young mathematicians

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:19.430
from Italy and
Hungary, respectively,

00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:22.860
to construct some impossible
solutions of Euler's equation--

00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:24.530
crazy solutions.

00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:28.810
Imagine a fluid that would
be at rest initially,

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:30.740
then start to
agitate like crazy,

00:53:30.740 --> 00:53:34.280
then be at rest again, without
any force acting on it.

00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:37.420
Something that made us
rethink the definition of what

00:53:37.420 --> 00:53:40.490
is a solution to
a fluid equation.

00:53:40.490 --> 00:53:43.875
In 2012, I depicted my
emotional encounter with Nash

00:53:43.875 --> 00:53:46.270
in "Birth of a Theorem."

00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:50.600
This was, like, autobiographical
book, or at least talking

00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:54.510
about how it is to
prove a theorem.

00:53:54.510 --> 00:53:59.030
All the ups and downs,
difficulties, mistakes,

00:53:59.030 --> 00:54:01.590
traveling, meeting
with people-- whatever.

00:54:01.590 --> 00:54:04.290
And one chapter is
devoted to my encounter

00:54:04.290 --> 00:54:08.870
with Nash in Princeton,
at the T. And I was so,

00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:11.400
you know-- he represented
so much to me.

00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:15.370
I was so, how to say,
impressed that I did not even

00:54:15.370 --> 00:54:19.710
dare to speak with him
on the first encounter.

00:54:19.710 --> 00:54:26.610
And 2015, Nash at last was
awarded the Abel Prize.

00:54:26.610 --> 00:54:30.550
Abel Prize is, together
with Fields Medal,

00:54:30.550 --> 00:54:33.176
for sure the most
prestigious prize.

00:54:33.176 --> 00:54:35.430
Abel Prize is certainly
more difficult to get

00:54:35.430 --> 00:54:36.890
than Fields Medal.

00:54:36.890 --> 00:54:42.370
Abel Prize is younger--
started, like, 15 years ago.

00:54:42.370 --> 00:54:45.330
Abel Prize typically
goes to the living,

00:54:45.330 --> 00:54:48.100
old legends in their 70s
who made contributions

00:54:48.100 --> 00:54:51.280
that everybody knows
and is amazed of.

00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:56.320
And I sat on the committee on
the Abel Prize, in those days.

00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:59.290
It was very emotional
for me, also,

00:54:59.290 --> 00:55:02.830
as being on that
committee the person

00:55:02.830 --> 00:55:05.570
who was scientifically
closest to Nash--

00:55:05.570 --> 00:55:10.470
you know, the one in charge
of defending the work of Nash.

00:55:10.470 --> 00:55:12.320
I will not say more
about the discussions,

00:55:12.320 --> 00:55:14.080
because, of course, it's secret.

00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:17.170
But this was very interesting
discussions we had about this.

00:55:17.170 --> 00:55:21.160
19 May 2015, in
Oslo, the Abel Prize

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:24.230
was awarded jointly to John
Nash and Louis Nirenberg--

00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:27.500
you know, these guys, they
have a long history together--

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:30.020
for striking and similar
contributions to the theory

00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:31.530
of nonlinear
partial differential

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:36.250
equations and its applications
to geometric analysis.

00:55:36.250 --> 00:55:37.430
Very emotional moment.

00:55:37.430 --> 00:55:41.340
You have to imagine the
ceremony, also-- King of Norway

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:46.070
was there, Nash gave
speech, and so on.

00:55:46.070 --> 00:55:52.730
There was public speech of Nash,
in which Nash recollected some

00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:55.750
of his older work,
some other work

00:55:55.750 --> 00:56:04.010
that he discussed with Einstein,
related to general relativity.

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:06.160
I had the honor to
be his chairman.

00:56:06.160 --> 00:56:09.080
This was our fourth
encounter, actually.

00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:12.440
And for all the community,
everybody thought,

00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.870
at last-- Nash got this reward.

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:18.900
And it was quite due.

00:56:18.900 --> 00:56:23.150
So it was the mood--
after this prize,

00:56:23.150 --> 00:56:26.070
he will at least-- he
can relax-- recognize,

00:56:26.070 --> 00:56:27.860
money, whatever.

00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:29.460
Not so.

00:56:29.460 --> 00:56:32.785
23 May 2015, back
from the ceremony,

00:56:32.785 --> 00:56:36.420
en route to Princeton, he
died, together with his wife,

00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:37.513
in a taxi crash.

00:56:40.900 --> 00:56:44.940
We met again with
Nirenberg, later on,

00:56:44.940 --> 00:56:47.160
trying to make sense
of it, whatever.

00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:52.270
Nirenberg [INAUDIBLE] Nash
ever did anything like anybody.

00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:53.700
Extra-terrestrian.

00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:57.760
Always gives these proofs that
no one can understand at first.

00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:02.590
He himself was unable to
explain them-- always saw things

00:57:02.590 --> 00:57:05.030
that people think is impossible.

00:57:05.030 --> 00:57:08.900
Gets Nobel Prize
for his PhD work,

00:57:08.900 --> 00:57:11.690
after having becoming
insane from an illness

00:57:11.690 --> 00:57:14.470
that you're supposed
never to recover.

00:57:14.470 --> 00:57:18.870
And, in the end, dies
like nobody else.

00:57:18.870 --> 00:57:22.630
Anyway, this is tragic.

00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:27.760
But the beauty of it, of
course, is the methods.

00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:31.050
And many mathematicians
feel that Nash

00:57:31.050 --> 00:57:34.690
is part of their family, in
the sense that he brought

00:57:34.690 --> 00:57:37.420
so many ideas and techniques.

00:57:37.420 --> 00:57:41.750
If I think of my own
work, I can see clearly

00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:43.880
relations with Nash's work.

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.410
The taste
statistical-mechanics problems,

00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:49.150
the taste for
entropy, the key role

00:57:49.150 --> 00:57:52.130
of regularity-- which I
uncovered with my collaborators

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:53.670
in similar problems.

00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:56.100
We, for instance,
in the problem that

00:57:56.100 --> 00:58:02.650
was one of my-- our--
most noticed papers,

00:58:02.650 --> 00:58:05.700
about behavior of
plasmas-- we uncovered

00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:09.330
how critical the role of
regularity was, in a way

00:58:09.330 --> 00:58:13.050
that had not been understood
before by physicists

00:58:13.050 --> 00:58:14.960
or mathematicians and this.

00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:18.540
And, also like Nash,
I admire his talent

00:58:18.540 --> 00:58:21.130
take pleasure in this sharp,
massive attack of given

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:24.040
simple problem, in some
sense-- with simple and

00:58:24.040 --> 00:58:26.020
well-calibrating
tools, always trying

00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:28.220
to uncovering new connections.

00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:32.750
This idea, that idea, let's
put it together, and so on.

00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:36.850
And so, in a way, the Nash
legacy still lives on.

00:58:36.850 --> 00:58:39.910
And I will conclude with this.

00:58:39.910 --> 00:58:43.650
Putting on, flashing,
just this bibliography,

00:58:43.650 --> 00:58:47.140
recommending to you, by
the way, the Beautiful Mind

00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:51.580
book by Nasar-- well,
especially chapters 20, 30,

00:58:51.580 --> 00:58:56.070
31, in which you will find
the stories behind the scenes

00:58:56.070 --> 00:58:58.930
for the mathematical
achievements-- which,

00:58:58.930 --> 00:59:03.030
for us, is even much more
important than the mental

00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:05.170
in the story.

00:59:05.170 --> 00:59:08.760
Nash wrote four big
papers, you know.

00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:11.850
That's nothing, compared
to a big list of papers.

00:59:11.850 --> 00:59:14.710
But, of these four
papers, three,

00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:19.220
probably, in retrospect, would
have deserved the Fields Medal.

00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:25.700
On my web page, on my blog,
on date of 26 December 2015,

00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:29.450
you will also find, in
French, a short article--

00:59:29.450 --> 00:59:32.350
or not so short-- in
memoriam John Nash,

00:59:32.350 --> 00:59:36.300
entitled "Breve rencontre"--
"Brief Encounter."

00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:39.010
And, with this, I will
conclude this discourse.

00:59:39.010 --> 00:59:39.880
Thank you.

00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:41.430
[APPLAUSE]
