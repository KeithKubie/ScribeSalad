00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.730
Hello, and welcome.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.530
This will be the first in the
series of lectures on physics.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.120
My goal is really to give you
an intuitive feeling of what

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.340
physics is all about, because
especially on the mechanics

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:16.530
side of things-- projectile
motion, force, and momentum--

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.170
it's actually pretty
intuitive.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.980
Let me know if I'm not giving
you an intuitive sense.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.170
Let's just start with probably
the most basic formula in

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.890
physics, and a lot of you have
already seen this: it's

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.690
distance is equal to velocity
times time.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.090
You might have seen it in
different forms-- you might

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.560
have seen it written as the
distance is equal to rate

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.850
times time, distance is equal
to speed times time, or

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.910
instead of a d, if you're
doing it in math class,

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.830
sometimes you'll write an s for
distance, because they use

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.190
d for derivatives-- but it's
all the same thing.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.140
It just says the distance you
travel is equal to the speed

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.570
or the velocity you
travel times time.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.490
Before I do a couple of quick
example problems just to hit

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.780
this point home, I just want to
make a slight distinction

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.100
between velocity and speed.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.300
When people use it in everyday
language, it tends to be used

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.330
interchangeably-- it's how fast
are you going, velocity

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.810
versus speed.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.590
Technically, there's a
difference: velocity is a

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.700
vector of measurement, and
speed is a scalar.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.740
I probably have already confused
you, but all you have

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.550
to know is a vector has a
magnitude and a direction.

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.580
If I were to give a velocity,
I really shouldn't just say

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.740
five miles per hour.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.930
I should say five miles
per hour north.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.630
Or, instead of saying five miles
per hour north, I could

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.140
say negative five miles
per hour south.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.390
Right?

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.740
Those would be the same thing.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.320
Speed, or a scalar, only has
magnitude, so speed would say

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.710
five miles per hour, but
I don't know what

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.770
direction I'm going in.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.990
I could be going forward,
backward, left, right, north,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.030
south, up, down, who knows?

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.130
That's the technical difference
between a vector

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.180
and a scalar and between
velocity and speed.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.210
It might not seem so obvious,
and probably on these few

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.150
example problems we're doing
right now, the distinction

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.720
probably could be used
interchangeably.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.420
Later on, as we progress to
fancier problems, I think

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.020
you'll see that velocity is a
more useful notion, because

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.010
there's the idea of a
negative velocity.

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.440
You can go in one direction,
which is positive, and then

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.800
you can turn around
and go negative.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.710
With speed, there's no
direction involved.

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.860
With that said-- I don't want
to dwell on that too much,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.380
because I don't want to make
you think that this is

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.580
difficult-- let's do a couple
of really quick problems.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.830
Let's say I went 50 meters,
so distance is equal to 50

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.230
meters-- I go 50 meters.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:52.640
Time is equal to-- this is
should really be distance,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.270
because it actually changes in
distance, but for the problems

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.706
we'll do, it doesn't make a
difference-- let's say the

00:02:57.706 --> 00:03:01.630
time is-- and this could be
change in time, as well, the

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:06.990
time is 10 seconds.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:12.480
So if we use that formula, we
have 50 meters is equal to

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.240
velocity times 10 seconds.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.560
This is a pretty simple
algebra equation.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.700
If we want to solve for
velocity, we just divide both

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.740
sides of this situation
by 10 seconds.

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.570
I'm doing this because I
actually want to show you that

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:30.550
when you divide the numbers,
you should also divide the

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.620
units with them, and then
you always end up

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:33.920
with the right units.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.850
Let's multiply both sides
of this equation

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:38.960
by 1 over 10 seconds.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:47.750
I get 1 over 10 seconds times 50
meters is equal to velocity

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.470
times-- I'll write it all out,
later on, I'll skip some

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.800
steps, and this obviously
cancels out, because that's

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.965
why we did in the first place--
and then the 50 and

00:03:59.965 --> 00:04:03.230
the 10 cancel and
this becomes 5.

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:09.240
We're left with 5, meter in the
numerator, and the seconds

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.380
in the denominator.

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.910
I could write it as sec, or just
an s-- so 5 meters per

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.540
second is our velocity, and
you could have done that.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:21.350
The one thing I just wanted to
highlight is that the units,

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.020
you can manipulate with the
numbers, and then you always

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.380
get the right answer.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.700
It might have been obvious in
this case-- you didn't have to

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.930
do it this way-- but once again,
later on, when we start

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.480
doing power and work and energy,
which is actually the

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.640
same thing as work, but once we
start doing those things,

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.670
then the units might not
seem so obvious.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:45.590
It's good to be able to deal
with the units this way.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.020
We could solve-- if I said that
the velocity is equal to

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:59.460
7 meters per second, and that
time is equal to 5 seconds--

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.620
how far did I go?

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.770
I could use that formula again:
distance is equal to

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.070
velocity, which is 7 meters per
second, times time, which

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:11.820
is 5 seconds.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.550
Once again, not only can we
multiply the numbers-- 7 times

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.600
5 is 35-- but we can multiply
the units, so we have meters

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.360
over second times second.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.200
You can almost treat them like
variables, but they're not--

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.570
they're units.

00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:29.180
Meters over seconds times
seconds-- the second in the

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:31.300
numerator and the second in the
denominator cancel out,

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.670
and so you're left
with 35 meters.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.550
There-- not only do you have the
right number, you have the

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:37.780
right units.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.020
Actually, this is going to be
super useful when you have to

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:46.390
convert from centimeters to
meters, and hours to seconds,

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.910
and all of that-- maybe we'll
do a couple of examples.

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.060
Actually, a while ago, I
actually made a separate video

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:55.350
on unit conversion, and that's
going to come and really handy

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:57.540
when we do the physics.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.100
With that out of the way, let's
make things a little bit

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:01.350
more complicated.

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.550
Most of what you've probably
experienced so far-- distance

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:14.420
is equal to velocity times time,
or rate times time-- is

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.590
where velocity is constant.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.080
You're going 30 meters per
second, you're always going

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.480
the 30 meters per second, and
you'll stay going 30 meters

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.200
per second.

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:28.500
But we know from moving,
generally, that your velocity

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.700
isn't-- sometimes, you're
stationary, then sometimes

00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:33.460
you're moving, and in order to
start stationary, and then get

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.760
moving, your velocity
has to change.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:40.860
How could we describe a
change in velocity?

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.120
Once again, I don't think I'm
teaching you anything

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.580
fundamentally new.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:47.090
You know what it is--
it's acceleration.

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:52.300
So, velocity is acceleration
times time.

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.690
There's a pretty good analogy
here: just as distance is

00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:59.340
velocity times time,
and velocity is

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.650
acceleration times time.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:05.920
Or, you view it as the change in
distance over the change in

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:12.020
time is velocity, while the
change in velocity versus the

00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:16.940
change in time is equal
to acceleration.

00:07:16.940 --> 00:07:19.220
My phone's ringing-- let me
answer that a little bit

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:23.440
later, because once again,
you are more important.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:25.000
So where was I?

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.060
I was saying how they're very
similar-- at least, there's

00:07:28.060 --> 00:07:30.550
kind of an analogy here.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.500
What can we do with
this notion?

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.460
I'm going to do a bunch of what
I think you'll find is

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:39.120
pretty useful-- they're called
projectile problems, and

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.120
projectile problems involve the
acceleration of gravity.

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.620
We could do other acceleration
problems involving the

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:49.470
acceleration of cars,
and actually, I

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.040
probably will do that.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:58.050
The acceleration of gravity is
actually 9.8 meters per second

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:02.400
downwards-- once again,
acceleration is actually not

00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:04.530
downwards, but towards the
center of the earth.

00:08:04.530 --> 00:08:08.060
Acceleration is also a vector
quantity, but for the sake of

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:13.260
our computations, we'll just
say 10 meters per second.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:17.850
Acceleration is equal to g-- g
is normally the variable used

00:08:17.850 --> 00:08:21.160
when people talk about the
acceleration of gravity, and

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:27.290
let's say that equals 10 meters
per second squared.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:31.410
I know what you're thinking,
that this is kind of a strange

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.270
set of units-- meters per second
squared, and it's hard

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:35.059
to visualize.

00:08:35.059 --> 00:08:38.610
That's acceleration, and I think
once you see it used in

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.070
some of these formulas, it'll
start to make a little sense

00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:46.770
in terms of how these
units work out.

00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.080
Let's start with a fairly
simple problem.

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:53.640
Let's say I drop a rock from-- I
don't recommend you do this,

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:57.170
you could kill somebody-- not
a rock, a penny, from the

00:08:57.170 --> 00:09:01.500
Empire State Building, and I'm
assuming no air resistance.

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.920
Actually, I just looked at the
clock, and I realize that I'm

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:05.030
running out of time.

00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:06.830
I'm going to actually start
this problem in the next

00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:07.760
presentation.

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:09.370
I'll see you soon.
