00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:09.500
-Good morning, everybody.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.620
And welcome to the Radcliffe
Institute for Advanced Study.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.490
I'm Liz Cohen.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:15.340
I'm dean of the institute.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.130
And I am delighted to welcome
you to our annual science

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.000
symposium, which will engage
us all today in probing

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.820
the past, the present,
and the future of DNA.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.470
The Radcliffe Institute
for Advanced Study

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.490
is a distinctive
intellectual community

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.910
where scholars, scientists,
and artists work

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.010
at the forefront of
their disciplines

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.310
and across disciplinary
boundaries.

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.770
In fact, you might
say that dedication

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.020
to interdisciplinary work is
deeply embedded in our DNA.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.890
And you can see its expressions
in today's list of speakers,

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.830
which includes a chemist,
an anthropologist,

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.810
an entrepreneur,
and an explorer,

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:02.740
as well as the prominent
geneticist you might expect.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:05.140
I hope you'll take
advantage of the opportunity

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.910
to talk with our
speakers by joining us

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.770
for a reception at Fay House,
right next door, immediately

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.980
after the conclusion
of today's symposium.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.260
There you will also
find DNA related posters

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.460
prepared especially
for this conference,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.530
chiefly by students.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.050
These posters will be on
display in the Sheerr Room

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.200
of Fay House during
the lunch hour,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.090
as well as during the reception.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.760
Radcliffe has a long and
deeply embedded commitment

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.960
to the sciences and to sharing
advance scientific work

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.280
with the public through
conferences like this one.

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.150
We are proud of
our rich tradition

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.540
of science programming,
hearkening back

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.340
to Mary Ingraham Bunting.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.020
She was a microbiologist,
the fifth president

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.470
of Radcliffe College,
and the founder

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.650
of the forerunner of today's
fellowship program, which was

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:58.780
called the Bunting Institute.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:01.370
We continue Mary
Bunting's legacy

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.740
through our yearly
science symposium

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.700
and through a related
science lecture series.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.889
I hope you will come back for
the lectures on DNA beginning

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:14.830
on Tuesday November 3 at 5:00
PM when Dan Barouch, professor

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.960
of medicine at
Harvard Medical School

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.480
and the director of
the Center of Virology

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.550
and Vaccine Research at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.440
discusses, and I quote his title
here, prospects for a vaccine

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.870
and a cure for HIV.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.807
For more information on this
series and many other upcoming

00:02:33.807 --> 00:02:35.640
events, I hope you'll
check out the calendar

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.230
cards that we've put on your
seats, as well as our website.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.150
Today's conference
has been organized

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.160
by our biological
science faculty

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.050
director, Janet Rich-Edwards.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.330
And I'm very grateful to
Janet for her leadership.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:52.050
We're here today to
consider the past, present,

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.940
and future of DNA.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.890
And the very title
of today's conference

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.470
alerts us to how timely,
but also in some ways

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.730
how timeless, a topic
DNA actually is.

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.010
Swiss scientist Friedrich
Miescher first isolated DNA

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.220
in white blood cells in 1869.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.980
Its discovery revolutionized
the science of genetics

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.690
and also inspired an entire
literary genre of microbiology

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.326
as dramatic narrative.

00:03:22.326 --> 00:03:26.650
In 1926, The Microbe
Hunters by Paul de Kruif

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.460
ignited the imaginations of an
entire generation of budding

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.830
scientists.

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.450
Half a century
later, The Eighth Day

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:37.910
of Creation by Horace
Judson did the same

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.890
for another generation.

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.770
For decades, scores of
biologists and geneticists

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.780
have attributed their
decisions to become scientists

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.010
to reading The Microbe Hunters
or The Eighth Day of Creation

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.390
when they were young.

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:56.440
In subject matter, both are
books about microbiology.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.450
But in form, they are
adventure stories.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.530
As one reviewer put
it, they feature,

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.290
and I quote, epics
of science that

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:05.860
come to triumphant fruition.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.200
The Eighth Day of
Creation, for example,

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.630
portrays James Watson and
Francis Crick discovery

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:15.250
of DNA's double helix
structure in 1953

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:19.310
as the culminating event
in molecular biology.

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.960
It's a suspenseful thriller,
and discovering the double helix

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.210
is the climactic moment.

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.490
The book was published
35 years ago in 1979.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:35.120
And yet, since then DNA research
has continued to advance

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.810
and has helped us to see
life on Earth holy anew.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.400
It has challenged
what we thought

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.990
we knew about neanderthals,
cancer, crime fighting,

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.330
human personality, and more.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:50.740
Its discovery has
changed medicine

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.610
and spawned whole
new industries.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.270
Even in my own field
of history, which

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:59.760
would seem to be as far
removed from cutting edge

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.690
molecular biological research
as you can possibly get,

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.670
it is being fundamentally
altered by DNA.

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.440
For example, advances
in genomic archaeology

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:14.480
have provided us with
better understanding

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.380
of why famines affected
populations differently.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.950
Some human remains
contain genes that

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:25.350
show unusually high prevalence
of lactase, an enzyme that

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.950
breaks down lactose, the sugar
that occurs in dairy products.

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.310
The more lactase a
person's body can produce,

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:37.500
the more a person can tolerate
and derived nutritional value

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.500
from milk and butter.

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.500
Populations with high levels
depended less exclusively

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.810
on grain for subsistence.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.510
And therefore could better
withstand poor harvests

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.790
in the short term.

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:52.860
Because they were
already accustom

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.450
to supplementing low
grain yields with milk.

00:05:56.450 --> 00:05:59.540
On the other hand,
those same populations

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:02.720
were much more vulnerable
when epidemic diseases struck

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.160
cattle.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.610
Very close to home,
my own colleague

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.580
in the Harvard history
department, Mike McCormick,

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.580
is reevaluating the
Anglo-Saxon invasion of Britain

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:16.170
on the basis of DNA research.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.380
Mike is not exaggerating
when he calls human genetics,

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.630
and I quote him, an
extraordinary window

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:25.670
on a vanished world of
migrations and matings

00:06:25.670 --> 00:06:29.690
that take you back literally
to the dawn of human time, end

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:30.900
quote.

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.930
The study of DNA then is
more relevant to the study

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.680
of history than might
at first be obvious.

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:41.600
At the same time, how scientists
study, understand, and apply

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:44.860
genetics also changes over time.

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.720
So while DNA changes history,
it also has a history.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.760
And we are living today
in a watershed moment

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.300
of that history.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:57.920
Let's look quickly at a case
of DNA research now evolving.

00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:00.260
The emerging field of
epigenetics studies

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:03.610
how environment can alter
the molecular processes that

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:05.990
affect how genes get expressed.

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:09.200
Researchers have shown
that toxins, chemicals,

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.070
and some kinds of
trauma can alter

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:16.320
how chromosomal code actually
gets suppressed or articulated.

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.640
Recent studies raise the
intriguing possibility

00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.450
that social interactions
might do that as well.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:27.670
For instance, research indicates
that some genetic diseases

00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.970
progress differently in
socially isolated people

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.830
than they do in people with
robust support networks.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:38.330
Learning more about how DNA
replicates and expresses itself

00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.960
therefore might not
necessarily reduce us

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.130
to dehumanized chains
of polypeptides,

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.360
as some ethicists worried
when the double helix was

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.910
first discovered.

00:07:49.910 --> 00:07:53.620
It might instead help
us to better understand

00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:57.150
exactly how and why the
people in our lives,

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.940
our friends and our families,
have a transformational impact

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.150
on us.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.390
The study of DNA in short began
raising profound questions

00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:08.840
as soon as Miescher began
isolating white blood

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:10.910
cells in 1869.

00:08:10.910 --> 00:08:13.200
It continues to do so today.

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:16.570
And it will persist doing
that into the future.

00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.910
It is thus a most fitting
topic for consideration

00:08:19.910 --> 00:08:22.160
here at the Radcliffe
Institute, where

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.840
we embrace open ended,
complicated, and cross

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.410
disciplinary investigations.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:31.350
To get us started, I would
now like to hand things

00:08:31.350 --> 00:08:33.580
over to Janet Rich-Edwards.

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:36.870
Janet is a Radcliffe alum
and an epidemiologist

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.200
with research interests
centering on maternal and child

00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:41.200
health.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.420
She holds dual appointments
at the Harvard Medical School

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.400
and the Harvard T.H Chan
School of Public Health.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:51.860
And she also serves as director
of developmental epidemiology

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.490
at the Conners Center for
Women's Health and Gender

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:57.510
Biology at Brigham
and Women's Hospital.

00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.430
Her research interests
include the implications

00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:05.290
of pregnancy complications for
future cardiovascular disease

00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:08.940
and the impact of childhood
abuse on chronic disease

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:10.070
outcomes.

00:09:10.070 --> 00:09:10.570
Janet?

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:19.960
-Good morning.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:20.840
Thank you Dean Cohen.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:22.506
And thank you all for
coming here today.

00:09:22.506 --> 00:09:25.480
And special thanks
to our speakers.

00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.450
Last Sunday, as my husband
and I were up on the roof

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:31.420
watching the lunar
eclipse, we recalled

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.310
the thrill of Apollo
11 landing there

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.940
and the moment when Neil
Armstrong stepped out

00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:39.630
of that module onto
the moon's surface.

00:09:39.630 --> 00:09:41.659
I was seven years old.

00:09:41.659 --> 00:09:43.200
We had just had
sheer wonder that man

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.950
was stepping on the moon.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:46.760
My husband, looking
up at that blood moon,

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:50.080
said, it's still pretty
amazing to think about.

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:51.180
And here's what I thought.

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.467
Yeah, it is.

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:54.300
But it ain't nothing
compared to what you're

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:56.840
going to hear about on Friday.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:59.600
I'm that excited
about today's program.

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.490
For as marvelous as it
is to go to the moon,

00:10:03.490 --> 00:10:05.600
it's equally
marvelous and perhaps

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.950
even more pretentious
for the planet's welfare

00:10:09.950 --> 00:10:13.000
to be able to go into
the mitochondria.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.240
As you'll hear today,
the science of DNA

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.130
is not only telling
us about our past.

00:10:17.130 --> 00:10:20.300
It's already improving human
health and planetary ecology.

00:10:20.300 --> 00:10:23.730
And its potential for the
future seems limitless.

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.100
But this technology
is new, very new.

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.080
And like any sharp tool,
can be used for good or ill.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.240
And so we need to
develop it thoughtfully

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.416
and with safeguards.

00:10:33.416 --> 00:10:34.790
And so in addition
to the science

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.830
today, we'll be discussing
the ethical aspects

00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:37.663
of this new world.

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:42.560
There we go.

00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:45.500
When I was a kid, DNA
was pretty simple.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:51.320
You had your nucleotides, the
base pairs, A, T, G, and C.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.800
And you knew that the DNA
in the nuclei of your cells

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:59.480
was transcribed into RNA, which
left the nucleus as messenger

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:02.860
RNA bearing the code to
guide the translation

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:05.660
and assemblage of
proteins from the building

00:11:05.660 --> 00:11:09.240
blocks of amino acids.

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:12.880
Your genes on your DNA
are the sections of DNA

00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.740
that actually code for these
proteins that make up your cell

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.890
walls, your antibodies,
your enzymes, your hormones,

00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:21.230
your muscles, basically you.

00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.490
As you probably know,
there are long stretches

00:11:24.490 --> 00:11:27.600
of DNA between the genes,
sections that don't actually

00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.010
code for proteins.

00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:33.490
We've learned that this
so-called junk DNA contains

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:35.970
instructions for
gene regulation,

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:39.270
like switches that turn
things on and off invisibly.

00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:41.970
I would say, unlike a Volkswagen
diesel exhaust system.

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.850
The various combinations
of the four nucleotides

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:53.730
form-- the four nucleotides form
64 distinct codes, or codons,

00:11:53.730 --> 00:11:57.070
that match up with 20
different amino acids.

00:11:57.070 --> 00:12:03.440
These amino acids,
sorry, form the proteins

00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.460
that form your body and
shape your behavior.

00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:06.850
But think about it.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:10.130
Four nucleotides,
20 amino acids,

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:13.570
there are hundreds of naturally
occurring amino acids out there

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.560
that are just left on the table.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:18.250
What if we could recruit
some of those amino acids

00:12:18.250 --> 00:12:19.910
to make new proteins?

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:22.300
What if we could make more
effective medicines with them?

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.410
What if we could make new fuels?

00:12:24.410 --> 00:12:28.090
If we had a larger
vocabulary of nucleotides,

00:12:28.090 --> 00:12:30.630
could we deploy DNA
to make new things?

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.980
But the first question is, can
we even add nucleotides to DNA

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:35.570
and get it to work?

00:12:35.570 --> 00:12:38.350
And that's exactly what Floyd
Romesberg's lab at the Scripps

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.250
Research Institute has done.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.270
As you'll hear
today, he succeeded

00:12:42.270 --> 00:12:47.470
in creating a synthetic DNA with
two new nucleotides, x and y.

00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:49.760
With six letters
in your alphabet,

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.510
there's a possibility now
of 216 codons that can now

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:57.104
code up to 172 amino acids.

00:12:57.104 --> 00:12:58.520
And you can see
that the potential

00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:02.260
for creating new proteins
then explodes from here.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.940
It's as if the original
four letters limited us

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.010
to the vocabulary of Hop on Pop.

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:12.559
With all due respect to Dr.
Seuss who I love, with two more

00:13:12.559 --> 00:13:14.350
letters, we begin to
be able to write words

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.050
that get us to Harry Potter.

00:13:16.050 --> 00:13:18.930
And who knows, with more
nucleotides, suddenly

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:21.980
we can write Infinite Jest.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:25.230
And then there's your
mitochondrial DNA.

00:13:25.230 --> 00:13:27.560
If this is a cell,
here's your nuclear DNA

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:28.980
right there in the red.

00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.910
These little bodies here
are your mitochondria.

00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:36.370
They are your generating
bodies in every cell.

00:13:36.370 --> 00:13:38.670
The mitochondria exist
outside of the nucleus.

00:13:38.670 --> 00:13:42.520
And they have their own DNA,
a primitive circular DNA

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.930
that we probably inherited
from bacteria long, long ago.

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.459
When I was in school, we use
to learn about mitochondria

00:13:48.459 --> 00:13:49.750
at the very end of the section.

00:13:49.750 --> 00:13:53.280
It was an afterthought.

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:56.970
You inherit your nuclear
DNA from both your parents.

00:13:56.970 --> 00:14:00.040
Half your code comes from the
nucleus of your father's sperm

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.520
and half from the nucleus
of your mother's egg.

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:05.530
When they merge, your
nuclear DNA is formed.

00:14:05.530 --> 00:14:10.240
But the egg also carries
mitochondria in a cytoplasm.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.000
If you're a woman and
you have children,

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.970
you'll pass the same
mitochondria along

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:15.400
to your children.

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:17.370
In fact, the mitochondria
in your cells,

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:20.330
whether you're a woman or a
man, are the same mitochondria

00:14:20.330 --> 00:14:22.650
in your mother's mother's
mother's mother's mother's

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.840
line, all the way on back.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.850
So while your nuclear
DNA is inherited

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.690
from all your ancestors,
your mitochondrial DNA

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:33.620
comes from your
maternal lineage.

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:39.660
This fact offers up
both promise and peril.

00:14:39.660 --> 00:14:42.120
Mitochondria are rather
prone to mutation.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:45.500
They lack some of the
genetic repair mechanisms

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.310
that we have in nuclear DNA.

00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.450
And over time, over
millennia, the mutations

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:53.270
allow us to track who
our ancestors were

00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.230
by looking at these mutation
patterns across populations.

00:14:57.230 --> 00:15:00.400
If you're a man
or a woman, we can

00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.540
trace your maternal
genetic lineage

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:04.800
through your mitochondria.

00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.500
Now, men have a second option.

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.730
We can also trace a
man's father's father's

00:15:08.730 --> 00:15:11.750
father's father's line
through his paternal lineage

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:14.570
through his y chromosome.

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:17.220
So I was curious about this.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:20.190
Back in 2009, I ordered
a gene testing kit

00:15:20.190 --> 00:15:22.800
from the National Genographic
Project, which we'll hear about

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:24.750
from Spencer Wells today.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:27.730
You can see here that it's
just a simple cheek swab.

00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:30.840
I was curious about my own
lineage, but even more curious

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.720
about my husband's lineage.

00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.010
Mark is African-American.

00:15:34.010 --> 00:15:37.040
He's a dead ringer
for Barack Obama.

00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:37.960
He is.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:39.460
You couldn't believe
how many people

00:15:39.460 --> 00:15:41.340
ask him if he is Barack Obama.

00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:45.330
Or even "are you
Osama?" has happened.

00:15:45.330 --> 00:15:47.750
What do you say?

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:50.150
Like many Americans,
the records that

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:53.090
would allow us to learn
about his family heritage

00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:54.750
just don't exist.

00:15:54.750 --> 00:15:57.170
So we were very curious
to look at his DNA

00:15:57.170 --> 00:16:01.130
and trace back to
his African roots.

00:16:01.130 --> 00:16:03.580
So first we did my
mitochondrial DNA.

00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:05.020
And here's what we found.

00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.120
Like all humans alive
today, my maternal line

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.230
can be traced back to
Ethiopia 150,000 years ago.

00:16:12.230 --> 00:16:14.630
My maternal
ancestors left Africa

00:16:14.630 --> 00:16:16.820
in the second wave
of people who did

00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.410
through the Saudi
peninsula, probably

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:21.480
following better game after
the Ice Age retreated.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.060
We came up through Central Asia.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.764
Then banged a left and into
Europe, where we probably

00:16:25.764 --> 00:16:27.430
would have bumped
into the Neanderthals.

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:28.805
And John Hawks
will be telling us

00:16:28.805 --> 00:16:31.630
more about that
mixture in our lineage.

00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:34.380
And then I discovered,
not to my great surprise,

00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:37.820
that most of my genes hail
from Britain and Ireland.

00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:40.000
So then we ran Mark's DNA.

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.450
Smart scientist and
feminist that I am,

00:16:42.450 --> 00:16:45.260
given the choice between
running his mitochondrial DNA

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:50.590
or his y chromosome DNA, I said,
oh run your y chromosome DNA.

00:16:50.590 --> 00:16:54.030
We were so excited to see
where in Africa his family had

00:16:54.030 --> 00:16:55.130
come from.

00:16:55.130 --> 00:17:00.230
So when we got his results,
there was something of a shock.

00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:04.500
Mark's paternal lineage
is more Irish than my own.

00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:08.550
Now, I have to say we
were both dismayed.

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:12.329
Because confronting
us in Mark's genes

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:14.910
was a story we
weren't sure we liked,

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:16.560
was the evidence of history.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.210
We were looking at
a legacy that spoke

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:20.980
of slavery, of human
ownership probably,

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:23.460
of race and gender dominance.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:25.359
It gave us some pause.

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:28.069
Of course, if we thought
about it for half a second,

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:30.020
Mark's paternal line
was not the place

00:17:30.020 --> 00:17:32.370
to look for his
African heritage.

00:17:32.370 --> 00:17:34.700
We should have checked
his maternal line.

00:17:34.700 --> 00:17:36.830
So that's what we did next.

00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:40.860
Mark's mitochondrial DNA, of
course, told a different story.

00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:42.600
His mitochondrial
mutations lead us

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.380
to West Africa, probably
a Fulbe or Fulani tribe.

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:49.480
If we reran those results
today, what is it,

00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.020
six years later,
we would probably

00:17:51.020 --> 00:17:52.720
get even greater specificity.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.020
Because the more people
who join this project,

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.060
the better that it is able
to map human migration.

00:17:58.060 --> 00:18:01.430
But our experience finding
out about our heritage

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.870
was, I would say, not
an unmixed blessing.

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.430
And I think there are real
ethical quandaries when

00:18:06.430 --> 00:18:08.390
the genetic story
line contradicts

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:11.840
our own personal or
our group's or tribe's

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:15.050
identity and our beliefs
about our origins.

00:18:15.050 --> 00:18:16.640
But bringing up
the question of who

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:20.680
has the right to determine
your group's heritage.

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:23.880
There's also a therapeutic
side to mitochondria as well.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.630
Mitochondria can be diseased.

00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:27.770
They get flaws in
their own DNA, which

00:18:27.770 --> 00:18:29.220
can be devastating to health.

00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:31.390
We'll hear this afternoon
from Alison Murdoch

00:18:31.390 --> 00:18:33.860
of Newcastle University
about the brave new way

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.130
to prevent mitochondrial
disease that

00:18:36.130 --> 00:18:37.990
is passed from mother to child.

00:18:37.990 --> 00:18:39.240
I'll give you a brief outline.

00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.042
There are a few ways to do this.

00:18:41.042 --> 00:18:42.510
This is one of them.

00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:45.470
If a woman has
defective mitochondria

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.350
and she goes to have
a child, there's

00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:50.010
a strong likelihood
she'll pass it on.

00:18:50.010 --> 00:18:52.270
But once she and her
partner conceive,

00:18:52.270 --> 00:18:56.180
it's possible now to extract
their healthy nuclear DNA

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.370
from the unhealthy egg.

00:18:59.370 --> 00:19:03.850
If another woman with healthy
mitochondria donates an egg,

00:19:03.850 --> 00:19:07.810
it's possible to strip out
the nuclear DNA from that one,

00:19:07.810 --> 00:19:10.950
and replace it with the
prospective parent's

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.350
nuclear DNA.

00:19:12.350 --> 00:19:18.296
This gives the patient couple a
chance to have a healthy child.

00:19:18.296 --> 00:19:20.045
This has been done
successfully in humans.

00:19:20.045 --> 00:19:21.880
But as you can
imagine, the process

00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:25.080
of creating life from
three parents effectively,

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:29.060
instead of the usual two, has
raised some ethical issues.

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:30.940
Dr. Murdoch will tell
us about the technique

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:32.420
and about the new
legislation that

00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:36.630
has made this legal in the UK.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:39.320
We are also joined today by
Jacob Corn from UCal Berkeley.

00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:40.820
He will talk about
the technique you

00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:43.850
may have heard of called CRISPR,
which makes it possible to,

00:19:43.850 --> 00:19:47.350
if you will, copy edit
the genome, specific genes

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:50.510
or their transcription
factors, those on off switches

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:52.150
in the junk DNA.

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:54.130
This genome editing
has the potential

00:19:54.130 --> 00:19:57.320
not to just prevent as in
the mitochondrial scenario

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.670
you just saw, but
actually to cure

00:19:59.670 --> 00:20:03.700
many diseases, such as cystic
fibrosis or sickle cell anemia.

00:20:03.700 --> 00:20:06.800
This of course has enormous
ethical implications.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:10.050
This April, scientists in
China reported the first CRISPR

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:13.380
manipulation of a
non-viable human embryo.

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.930
If you follow the news, you'll
know that many scientists have

00:20:15.930 --> 00:20:17.990
urged a moratorium
on applying CRISPR

00:20:17.990 --> 00:20:20.820
to human germ cells,
that's egg cells and sperm

00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.860
cells, until the full
implications can be discussed

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:27.630
among scientific and
government organizations.

00:20:27.630 --> 00:20:30.870
But genetic engineering is
already being used to create

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:33.800
transgenic animals,
sometimes known as Chimera, ,

00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.160
as for the mythical beast that
was a part lion, part eagle,

00:20:37.160 --> 00:20:38.270
part goat.

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:41.130
In this case, a
human hormone gene

00:20:41.130 --> 00:20:43.460
is inserted into
a sheep's genome.

00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:47.050
The resulting transgenic sheep,
otherwise perfectly normal,

00:20:47.050 --> 00:20:50.100
then excretes the human
hormone into its milk,

00:20:50.100 --> 00:20:53.060
where it can be harvested to
create inexpensive medicines

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:55.100
and potential vaccines.

00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.520
ZMapp, the experimental
Ebola drug,

00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.160
is a product of one of these
transgenic molecular pharmacy

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:04.120
experiments.

00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:06.430
But it's not just medicines.

00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.940
You may have heard of the
spider goat, a regular goat who

00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.920
has received some DNA from
the golden orb spider.

00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:15.890
This cartoon from
Modern Farmer Magazine--

00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:20.120
believe it or not, wow it's
really modern-- is facetious.

00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:22.940
This goat does not
actually fling webs.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.390
But it does secrete
proteins into its milk

00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:28.880
that can be made into an elastic
fiber that is 10 times stronger

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:29.960
than steel.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.966
Imagine that, elastic
and stronger than steel.

00:21:32.966 --> 00:21:34.340
This has the
potential to be made

00:21:34.340 --> 00:21:38.100
into body armor, parachutes,
surgical sutures,

00:21:38.100 --> 00:21:41.180
and other fantastic stuff.

00:21:41.180 --> 00:21:42.750
Other applications
of DNA science

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:44.560
will allow us to
protect the planet.

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.760
Many of you may have heard a
recent NPR broadcast discussing

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.850
the technique of sampling
ocean water to measure

00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:52.860
the free floating
DNA that is cast off,

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:56.870
just shed, by fish,
sharks, plants, whales,

00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:59.120
and other things as an
inexpensive way of creating

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:01.470
a real time ocean census.

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:04.160
This would allow us to follow
migrations of hard to track

00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.980
animals.

00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.606
Or take leeches, or more
specifically the leech's lunch.

00:22:10.606 --> 00:22:11.980
They turn out to
be quite useful.

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.410
Because they suck the blood
from just about anything.

00:22:14.410 --> 00:22:17.550
And they provide a good
tool for censusing a forest.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.080
In the Yunnan
province of Vietnam,

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:22.040
rangers collect leeches off
trees, note their locations

00:22:22.040 --> 00:22:24.140
with a GPS, bring
them back to the lab,

00:22:24.140 --> 00:22:25.410
and put them in the blender.

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:29.920
If you then use a process
called metabarcoding, which

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:31.810
amplifies sections
of DNA, you can tell

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:33.940
what species are in the forest.

00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.690
And using this,
they've discovered

00:22:37.690 --> 00:22:42.050
that the shy and elusive saola,
aka the Asian unicorn, which

00:22:42.050 --> 00:22:47.590
has not been seen in the wild
since 1999, is not extinct.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:51.480
This information could be
used to protect its habitat.

00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:52.600
But could we go further?

00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.340
Could we, for example,
use DNA from one species,

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:58.730
even an extinct species like the
mammoth, to help another one?

00:22:58.730 --> 00:23:01.290
Beth Shapiro of UCal Santa
Cruz will, for example,

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:03.300
talk about how to
clone a mammoth

00:23:03.300 --> 00:23:05.520
and perhaps how
mammoth DNA might

00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:08.010
help to save modern day
elephants by increasing

00:23:08.010 --> 00:23:09.350
their range.

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:12.280
We will also explore with Greg
Hampikian of the Innocence

00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:16.120
Project the use of DNA for
better or worse to solve

00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:17.380
crimes.

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.270
While the intention is
to free the innocent

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:21.090
and convict the
guilty, there's also

00:23:21.090 --> 00:23:24.250
the potential of flawed science
and bad forensic technique

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:25.770
to convict the innocent.

00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:28.470
He'll be talking
to us about that.

00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.740
And throughout the
day, and with your help

00:23:30.740 --> 00:23:32.910
to bring up questions,
and explicitly

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:35.710
with the talk this afternoon
of Art Caplan, the bioethicist

00:23:35.710 --> 00:23:37.960
from the New York University
School of Medicine,

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:41.740
we'll consider the ethics
of this fast moving science.

00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:45.050
I think this promises to
be a really exciting today.

00:23:45.050 --> 00:23:48.710
Thank you for joining us, and
I'd like to get us started.

00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:51.200
If our first panel on
Mammoths, Neanderthals,

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.600
and Your Ancestors
might come up,

00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:56.510
I'll introduce George Church
who can then introduce them.

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:58.890
So George Church
is one of our own,

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:02.140
a former professor of genetics
here at Harvard Medical School

00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:05.710
and the principal investigator
of the Personal Genome Project.

00:24:05.710 --> 00:24:08.530
He's the director of the
Center for Causal Consequences

00:24:08.530 --> 00:24:11.130
of Variation and a member
of the collaborating group

00:24:11.130 --> 00:24:15.050
for the Molecular and Genomic
Imaging Center, both of which

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:18.290
are NIH centers of excellence
in genomic studies.

00:24:18.290 --> 00:24:21.240
He's written Regenesis,
How Synthetic Biology Will

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:22.690
Reinvent Nature and Ourselves.

00:24:22.690 --> 00:24:24.250
And you can get
his full bio, which

00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.800
is really quite impressive,
in your program too.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.060
So I won't belabor it.

00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.030
But thank you, George,
for moderating the panel.

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.850
-Thank you.

00:24:41.416 --> 00:24:42.832
I'm just going to
do it from here.

00:24:45.550 --> 00:24:48.250
This is really one of
my favorite topics.

00:24:48.250 --> 00:24:51.520
Every aspect of it, everything
that we just heard just

00:24:51.520 --> 00:24:52.720
resonates.

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:57.300
And it's very exciting
to be on this panel.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.777
And I'm just going
to moderate it.

00:24:58.777 --> 00:25:01.360
I'm going to try to get out of
the way as quickly as possible.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.850
I don't want to repeat
what's in your booklet.

00:25:03.850 --> 00:25:05.920
I hope you look it over.

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.660
But I will say a few
things that maybe

00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:09.470
aren't so obvious in there.

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.630
And I'll go in the order
that the speakers will speak.

00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:18.530
John Hawks has a
massive online presence.

00:25:18.530 --> 00:25:21.040
This is his web blog.

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.032
That's not a picture
of John there.

00:25:24.032 --> 00:25:25.740
This is what he actually
looks like here.

00:25:25.740 --> 00:25:29.530
But he has been involved in
the Rising Star workshop.

00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:34.940
And for those of you who follow
the Rising Star as a reality

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:37.390
singing program,
this is different.

00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:38.860
This is named after
the rising star

00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:44.370
cave, which has a
record for discoveries

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:49.920
of our ancient human remains.

00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:52.220
He'll tell you about
that, very exciting.

00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:55.275
And he has a-- he
runs one of most

00:25:55.275 --> 00:25:58.480
massive the massive open
online courses, or MOOCs.

00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.690
He got his PhD From
University of Michigan.

00:26:00.690 --> 00:26:03.150
What's not in your
thing, in your pamphlet,

00:26:03.150 --> 00:26:07.284
is he has a degree in
English and French,

00:26:07.284 --> 00:26:08.450
in addition to anthropology.

00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:10.736
And he has a distinguished
achievement professor

00:26:10.736 --> 00:26:12.110
of anthropology
at the University

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:14.520
of Wisconsin in Madison.

00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.730
He has some affection
for Neanderthals.

00:26:17.730 --> 00:26:20.290
And I think many
people have speculated

00:26:20.290 --> 00:26:22.880
about my relationship
with Neanderthals.

00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.070
Full disclosure, I
am 3% Neanderthal.

00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:27.560
And he's made a
huge contribution

00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.945
to that level of understanding.

00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:38.340
Beth Shapiro, and I met I
think because around 2007 I

00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.950
was mouthing off
about ancient DNA,

00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:44.750
which she was a
pioneer in producing

00:26:44.750 --> 00:26:46.680
progress in ancient DNA.

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.620
And I was simply
asked by journalists

00:26:48.620 --> 00:26:51.920
whether we could go from
reading it to writing it.

00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.620
And I didn't have the common
sense to dodge that question.

00:26:56.620 --> 00:27:00.490
Anyway, that led to
us holding a meeting

00:27:00.490 --> 00:27:10.880
that Beth, a very tiny one at
Harvard, really was the star

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.480
and really made
a big impression.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.660
And she has worked not
just with passenger pigeon,

00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.970
but with mammoths, giant
bears, camels, and horses,

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:28.460
all the extinct large animals
that stimulates us when we

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:31.270
were young kids and ever since.

00:27:31.270 --> 00:27:41.270
I think this kind of field
work is the stuff of Hollywood

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:43.450
crusaders and so on.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:46.170
And she has this lovely book.

00:27:46.170 --> 00:27:48.880
I love the title, but
I also like the cover.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:53.030
Because it not only has
a mammoth and the words

00:27:53.030 --> 00:27:55.340
how to clone a mammoth,
but a mirror mammoth

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:57.010
and how to clone
a mirror mammoth.

00:27:57.010 --> 00:28:02.520
So that's an inside
joke, but anyway.

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:06.010
And Spencer Wells has a really
special place in my heart.

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:10.450
In 2005, he was in
the process without,

00:28:10.450 --> 00:28:13.560
I think as he would say
without knowing it, founding

00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.800
the incredible field of
direct to consumer DNA

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.000
analysis in the form of
the Genographic Project.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.310
And he's been an explorer
in residence in the National

00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:31.230
Geographic, which I think all
of us admire that sort of work.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:34.050
And he's led that
project for 10 years.

00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:37.650
And we've already seen
some slides from that.

00:28:37.650 --> 00:28:39.120
But about that
time, I was involved

00:28:39.120 --> 00:28:43.870
in, a little after
that, with 23 and Me

00:28:43.870 --> 00:28:45.540
and with the Personal
Genome Project.

00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.220
And he helped us out
in those early days

00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:50.260
of the Personal Genome Project.

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:53.860
And he's written many
books, such as-- here's

00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:56.960
one of the early ones
I read before I met him

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.650
2002, The Journey Of Man.

00:28:59.650 --> 00:29:02.670
He's written two, the
start, Pandora's Seed.

00:29:02.670 --> 00:29:08.410
He began his PhD when he was
19 years old here at Harvard.

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:13.300
And then both he and Beth spent
a considerable amount of time

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.440
at Oxford.

00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.420
So without further ado,
we will begin with John.

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:19.150
Thank you.

00:29:28.510 --> 00:29:32.150
-All right, so here we are.

00:29:32.150 --> 00:29:35.000
I've just come from
Gibraltar, where

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.850
I was at a meeting with--
Gibraltar's a cool place

00:29:37.850 --> 00:29:39.810
for Neanderthals
for lots of reasons.

00:29:39.810 --> 00:29:42.960
Most notably because of
Gorham's and Vanguard Caves,

00:29:42.960 --> 00:29:46.550
which are some of the most
important sites representing

00:29:46.550 --> 00:29:49.190
later Neanderthals,
and really even up

00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:51.190
to the end of their existence.

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:55.420
Last year at Gorham's Cave was
announced the first known case

00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:58.750
of Neanderthals engraving
on the walls of a cave.

00:29:58.750 --> 00:30:02.120
And so we now have the
Neanderthal hash tag

00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:07.440
as a legacy of their
social media savvy.

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:10.080
It's a really exciting place,
and I love going there.

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:13.210
And the exciting part
about this latest trip

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:16.720
was that we had a
meeting that involved

00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:20.030
some of the really big
names in understanding

00:30:20.030 --> 00:30:24.090
Neanderthals and their
contribution to our evolution.

00:30:24.090 --> 00:30:27.440
People like Milford Wolpoff,
Chris Stringer, Erik Trinkaus,

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:31.150
people that in the '90s were
at each other's throats.

00:30:31.150 --> 00:30:34.760
Because they disagreed about
almost everything fundamental

00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.220
about the way that modern
humans originated and how

00:30:38.220 --> 00:30:41.920
Neanderthals did or didn't
contribute to our populations.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.170
And the thing that was
exciting about this last week

00:30:44.170 --> 00:30:47.250
for me is I put
together, as a summary

00:30:47.250 --> 00:30:51.050
to the conference,
a list of facts

00:30:51.050 --> 00:30:55.060
that now everyone involved in
understanding human evolution

00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:57.220
universally agrees on.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:00.130
And the thing about
it is that these facts

00:31:00.130 --> 00:31:01.680
are facts that
have largely arisen

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:05.070
through the application
of ancient DNA technology

00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:07.270
to ancient fossil remains.

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:09.550
It is hard to
overstate the extent

00:31:09.550 --> 00:31:11.910
to which our present
understanding

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.190
of human evolution has emerged.

00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:16.750
Especially the later
phases of human evolution

00:31:16.750 --> 00:31:19.760
has emerged within
the last 10 years.

00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:23.510
And in large part due to
our systematic investigation

00:31:23.510 --> 00:31:26.750
of the microscopic and
submicroscopic aspects

00:31:26.750 --> 00:31:29.330
of fossils, including
ancient DNA.

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:32.360
So I thought that one
way to talk about the way

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:35.380
that we've changed our
understanding of evolution

00:31:35.380 --> 00:31:39.640
by looking at ancient remains
and the DNA in ancient remains

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:41.520
is to go through this list.

00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:45.520
And I can tell you that the
leading people in the field who

00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:48.170
have been leaders for
30 years last week

00:31:48.170 --> 00:31:50.780
saw this list and
all signed off on it.

00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.427
So I tell you that
this is really stuff

00:31:53.427 --> 00:31:54.385
that we now understand.

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.960
So one is that
living people today

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:00.700
have Neanderthal ancestors.

00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.580
And many of you have
heard that, of course,

00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:04.950
living Europeans,
living East Asians,

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:09.290
living Native American
peoples have around 3% or so

00:32:09.290 --> 00:32:11.030
of Neanderthal ancestry.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:12.970
And peoples in
sub-Saharan Africa

00:32:12.970 --> 00:32:15.510
don't have that kind of level.

00:32:15.510 --> 00:32:19.020
But nevertheless, because humans
are all geologically hugely

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.565
connected-- if you count
back your ancestors,

00:32:21.565 --> 00:32:24.700
it doubles every
generation back in time

00:32:24.700 --> 00:32:28.270
until it encompasses nearly
the entire human population.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.490
Living sub-Saharan Africans
have Neanderthal ancestors,

00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:34.310
even though their genetic
component from Neanderthals

00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:35.360
is much lower.

00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:39.340
Living people today come in some
small part from Neanderthals.

00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:42.360
But this contribution
is regionally

00:32:42.360 --> 00:32:45.950
distributed among living
people in surprising ways.

00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:48.740
So this is a chart that
shows shared derived

00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:51.720
alleles with Neanderthals,
so mutations people have

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:53.500
in common with Neanderthals.

00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:55.780
And there's a lot of
them in our genomes.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:58.490
But the difference between
different populations

00:32:58.490 --> 00:33:01.110
is the signature that
some of these populations

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:03.290
have more Neanderthal
than others.

00:33:03.290 --> 00:33:06.020
That's where we get
this 3% figure from.

00:33:06.020 --> 00:33:08.250
And the higher you
are in this chart,

00:33:08.250 --> 00:33:10.700
the more Neanderthal you are.

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:13.240
East Asians, are
more Neanderthal

00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.880
derived than Europeans.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:16.940
They have a little
more on average.

00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:19.470
This is counterintuitive,
because Neanderthals

00:33:19.470 --> 00:33:22.310
are known for being a
Western Eur-Asian population.

00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:24.030
They're known best from Europe.

00:33:24.030 --> 00:33:28.720
So we've discovered that
this population has a legacy.

00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.220
We've discovered that this
legacy is not distributed

00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:32.722
as we might have anticipated.

00:33:32.722 --> 00:33:33.805
This is super interesting.

00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:40.430
DNA evidence has come from
Neanderthals, not only

00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:42.575
across their European range.

00:33:42.575 --> 00:33:43.950
And these are all
sites that have

00:33:43.950 --> 00:33:46.720
generated whole mitochondrial
genomes of Neanderthals.

00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:49.580
And there's a few more now
than when I made the chart.

00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:52.420
But also surprisingly
across a Central Asian

00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:55.650
range that we did not
formerly recognize

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:57.990
as being Neanderthal central.

00:33:57.990 --> 00:34:00.770
We now think that this is
the hotbed of Neanderthals.

00:34:00.770 --> 00:34:03.250
And that the European
Neanderthal population

00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:05.230
was continually
being replenished

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:07.710
from this eastern source.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:09.270
But the other thing
that we've begun

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:11.280
to appreciate with
the investigation

00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:15.760
of ancient remains that are
less morphologically useful,

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:19.820
the skulls and whole
skeletons tell us immediately

00:34:19.820 --> 00:34:21.050
what something looks like.

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.840
But most of the fossil
record is fragments.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.000
And in particular,
those fragments

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:30.310
now are generating super
interesting evidence

00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:32.219
about ancient populations.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:33.799
So this is Denisova Cave.

00:34:33.799 --> 00:34:35.340
I've had the privilege
of going there

00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:36.964
are a number of times
at the invitation

00:34:36.964 --> 00:34:39.199
of the Russian
Academy of Sciences.

00:34:39.199 --> 00:34:41.639
It's a beautiful place
with important excavations

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:44.159
that cover the
last 120,000 years

00:34:44.159 --> 00:34:47.670
of archaeological history.

00:34:47.670 --> 00:34:56.230
And this cave has produced
in one little pinky

00:34:56.230 --> 00:35:01.370
an entire genome at what is
now high coverage that tells us

00:35:01.370 --> 00:35:03.660
about the prehistory
of a population

00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.310
that archaeologists did
not suspect existed,

00:35:06.310 --> 00:35:11.710
a population that is as
distinct from known Neanderthals

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:15.550
as the most different living
people are from each other.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:18.730
So there was an ancient
population represented

00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:20.570
at this place, Denisova Cave.

00:35:20.570 --> 00:35:24.010
This aging population we've
begun to call the Denisovans.

00:35:24.010 --> 00:35:26.300
And the Denisovans
have contributed

00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:30.530
their genetic heritage to some
human populations, largely

00:35:30.530 --> 00:35:33.830
the populations of Australia
and Highland New Guinea,

00:35:33.830 --> 00:35:36.950
but in a very small fraction
across most of Eastern

00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:38.560
Asia and the new world.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:44.190
So we've got not one, but
multiple ancient populations

00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:47.520
that we've now sampled
with ancient DNA.

00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.730
And they co-existed.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:52.080
We didn't expect this at all.

00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.530
And the idea that you would
have bone fragments that

00:35:54.530 --> 00:35:56.970
were basically
useless for any kind

00:35:56.970 --> 00:36:00.340
of morphological
understanding create what

00:36:00.340 --> 00:36:04.110
is denser evidence of the
heritage of an ancient group

00:36:04.110 --> 00:36:07.380
than we have gotten
from most living people

00:36:07.380 --> 00:36:09.290
is just astounding.

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:11.860
This is not only true of the
Neanderthals and Denisovans.

00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.760
We can now look inside
of human genomes

00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.330
and make some
estimation of what we

00:36:17.330 --> 00:36:20.870
call ghost lineages,
ancient populations that

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:23.530
contributed to each other.

00:36:23.530 --> 00:36:27.300
If we look at my field guide
to Pleistocene hookups,

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.310
you will see that we understand
quite an enormous amount

00:36:30.310 --> 00:36:33.770
about the contributions
of different populations

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:35.620
to each other in the past.

00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:39.270
The Denisovan population,
which is known only

00:36:39.270 --> 00:36:41.370
from a pinky and
two teeth, we know

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:45.010
from looking at that genome has
contributions from a mystery

00:36:45.010 --> 00:36:49.050
population, a ghost lineage of
ancient humans, that separated

00:36:49.050 --> 00:36:52.480
from the main line of our
human evolutionary history

00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:55.990
more than a million years
ago, much more differentiated

00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:57.500
than Neanderthals,
and Denisovans,

00:36:57.500 --> 00:36:59.370
and modern humans
are from each other.

00:36:59.370 --> 00:37:02.350
We know from looking within
the genomes of living Africans,

00:37:02.350 --> 00:37:06.710
using the same signatures that
we recognize from ancient genes

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:10.300
to recognize the contribution
of ancient populations.

00:37:10.300 --> 00:37:13.350
We can now look for those
same signatures in cases

00:37:13.350 --> 00:37:15.440
where the ancient
genes don't exist.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:19.760
And we can find ancient African
populations as differentiated

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.340
as they are from living
people, as Neanderthals

00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:25.610
are from living people,
that have contributed

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:28.200
to living African populations.

00:37:28.200 --> 00:37:32.400
Our evolutionary
history involves

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:35.250
many archaic and
modern groups of humans

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:37.780
that in every instance
we have discovered

00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:39.820
interbred with each
other and contributed

00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:44.390
to later populations,
mostly to a minor degree.

00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:46.890
This is a very different
picture of our evolution

00:37:46.890 --> 00:37:50.080
than we had in the year 2005.

00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:51.640
No one would have
said that this is

00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.920
what our evolutionary
history looked like.

00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:56.970
It's looking much more like
a braided stream in which you

00:37:56.970 --> 00:38:00.180
have these populations that
are separated for quite

00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:03.160
a long time, maybe with
some minimal interbreeding

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.160
between them.

00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.690
But populations that have become
quite inbred, quite separate

00:38:07.690 --> 00:38:08.650
from each other.

00:38:08.650 --> 00:38:12.460
And sometimes later in time
they come back into contact

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.800
to contribute to each other.

00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:18.000
Sometimes of course, they
must have gone extinct.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.520
This goes now back
as far in time

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:23.270
as 400,000 years
where the earliest

00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:25.725
hominin nuclear and
mitochondrial DNA

00:38:25.725 --> 00:38:27.766
has been recovered from
a site called Sima de los

00:38:27.766 --> 00:38:31.380
Huesos, which is at the moment
the most productive hominin

00:38:31.380 --> 00:38:33.290
fossil site in the
world for producing

00:38:33.290 --> 00:38:37.190
skeletal remains of what
we now recognize from DNA

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:40.890
are fundamentally the ancestors
of European Neanderthals.

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:45.570
So there is so much to learn
from these ancient specimens

00:38:45.570 --> 00:38:47.540
that we're now
through technology

00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:49.790
being able to recover.

00:38:49.790 --> 00:38:52.830
All right, when we look at
these ancient populations,

00:38:52.830 --> 00:38:54.230
I like this tree.

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:56.560
It's a cluster.

00:38:56.560 --> 00:38:59.130
And it doesn't really recognize
all of the complexities

00:38:59.130 --> 00:39:00.050
of this relationship.

00:39:00.050 --> 00:39:02.090
But it's a good measure
of genetic difference.

00:39:02.090 --> 00:39:04.780
Because when we look at the
known Neanderthal nuclear

00:39:04.780 --> 00:39:08.000
sequences, we now have a
substantial additional sequence

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.150
in this from the Altai.

00:39:10.150 --> 00:39:12.580
They are really homogeneous.

00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:15.120
There's very little genetic
difference among them

00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.150
compared to the genetic
differences among living

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:20.770
peoples and compared to the
genetic difference between them

00:39:20.770 --> 00:39:22.190
and the Denisovans.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:25.700
So Neanderthals are inbred.

00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:28.770
And when we look at particular
Neanderthal specimens,

00:39:28.770 --> 00:39:31.180
this is a graph from a
paper describing the Altai

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:35.540
Neanderthal specimen, in
some cases the inbreeding is

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:36.310
profound.

00:39:36.310 --> 00:39:39.510
This individual was
actually inbred.

00:39:39.510 --> 00:39:42.840
His or-- I believe it's a
female-- her parents were

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:46.320
in fact relatives and second
degree relatives, something

00:39:46.320 --> 00:39:51.410
like uncle niece or
grandfather granddaughter.

00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:54.080
This is highly inbred.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:58.740
And when we look generally
at ancient human populations,

00:39:58.740 --> 00:40:01.120
including-- this is
a chart that shows

00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:05.770
population size estimates over
time, going back in the past.

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:08.870
And the Neanderthals,
the Denisovans,

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:12.740
and in fact, the ancestors
of most modern human groups

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:15.290
have passed through
very small stages

00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:18.160
where they were highly
endogamous, highly inbred.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.360
It's something that we've
learned from ancient DNA

00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:23.380
that every population that
we know about that existed

00:40:23.380 --> 00:40:25.870
in humans before
40,000 years ago

00:40:25.870 --> 00:40:29.030
was much more inbred
than living people are.

00:40:29.030 --> 00:40:33.580
We come from a heritage that
is many small groups that

00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.870
were dynamic, that were
continually limited

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:39.570
in their genetic
variability by the expansion

00:40:39.570 --> 00:40:42.770
and probably replacement
of many small populations

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:48.830
and the rejoining of these
populations later in time.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:51.170
This point goes to address that.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:53.510
I mentioned earlier, we've
got Neanderthal sequences

00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:55.610
from Central Asia
and from Europe.

00:40:55.610 --> 00:40:58.030
What we now know is
that the European ones

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:59.950
seem to differentiate
between those

00:40:59.950 --> 00:41:02.280
that existed before
50,000 years ago

00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.010
and those that existed
after 50,000 years ago.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:07.300
And the ones later seem
to have been replenished

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:10.280
from probably a Central Asian
source, as far as we understand

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:11.190
the data.

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:13.010
In other words,
Neanderthals were not

00:41:13.010 --> 00:41:17.300
a static population that was
sitting in Europe well adapted

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.400
to the Ice Ages.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.130
It was a dynamic population.

00:41:20.130 --> 00:41:22.980
It was a population that ranged
over large areas of space

00:41:22.980 --> 00:41:25.680
and continually expanded
across them with groups

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.040
replacing other groups.

00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:30.170
We're looking at human
evolutionary history that

00:41:30.170 --> 00:41:33.540
is much more dynamic
than we anticipated just

00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.280
by looking at fossil remains.

00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.400
Looking at the fossils, we
tended to connect the dots

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.620
and say as we go back
in the past, what

00:41:40.620 --> 00:41:42.630
we're doing is we're
linking ancestors

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:43.710
and their descendants.

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:47.510
What we now understand is
that we cannot link ancestors

00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:49.320
and descendants in
any direct sense.

00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:53.840
What we're linking is points
along this very complex

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:57.140
reticulate structure,
some of which

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.600
are separated for a while.

00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.470
And so maybe maintain a
morphological contiguity

00:42:01.470 --> 00:42:02.320
with each other.

00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:06.150
But many of which are not
particularly closely connected.

00:42:06.150 --> 00:42:09.780
Many of the things that we
think in anatomical terms were

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:12.950
probably important might be
epiphenomenon of selection

00:42:12.950 --> 00:42:14.600
maintaining them
over time within

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:16.020
these geographic regions.

00:42:19.390 --> 00:42:23.160
When we go to more recent
phases of our human evolutionary

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:27.090
history, ancient DNA has
been equal in its import.

00:42:27.090 --> 00:42:29.250
Although to my colleagues
who are anthropologists

00:42:29.250 --> 00:42:31.770
working in human evolution,
they haven't yet quite

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:35.030
come to as good a grip of
the importance of this.

00:42:35.030 --> 00:42:38.130
This is the earliest known
modern European skull

00:42:38.130 --> 00:42:39.060
in Europe.

00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:42.620
It's from a Romanian site called
Oase, which is deep in a cave

00:42:42.620 --> 00:42:45.110
that you have to get
under water dive through

00:42:45.110 --> 00:42:48.360
to get to where the
cranial remains are.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.010
When we look at Oase
compared to-- this

00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:56.310
is a chart that shows its
genetic similarity to Europeans

00:42:56.310 --> 00:42:59.010
at the top and Asians and
Native American populations

00:42:59.010 --> 00:42:59.690
the bottom.

00:42:59.690 --> 00:43:02.340
You can see that
this Oase individual

00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:06.350
is closer to the Asians
than it is to Europeans.

00:43:06.350 --> 00:43:08.225
The first modern Europeans
were not European.

00:43:10.810 --> 00:43:12.970
When you look at
this skull compared

00:43:12.970 --> 00:43:15.050
to other ancient
specimens, these

00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:17.990
are all ancient DNA specimens
from slightly later phases

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:21.040
of evolution, you can see that
it's about equally related

00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:24.450
to them as it is to Asians
and Native Americans.

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:27.650
Our archaeological
record of modern humans,

00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:30.900
the one that we thought
was sampling the ancestors

00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:35.320
of today's Europeans, today's
Asians, and so on, doesn't.

00:43:35.320 --> 00:43:39.510
It samples ancient populations
that by and large have not

00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:43.020
contributed to great degree
to any living people.

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:46.600
This is a chart of the
mitochondrial haplotypes found

00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:49.150
in the hunter
gatherers that lived

00:43:49.150 --> 00:43:51.190
before the advent of
farming in Europe.

00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:54.010
83% of them have a
haplogroup mitochondrial

00:43:54.010 --> 00:43:59.910
called haplogroup U. This is the
same proportions of haplogroups

00:43:59.910 --> 00:44:02.610
in the first farmers in Europe.

00:44:02.610 --> 00:44:04.730
And as you can see,
that haplogroup U,

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.850
which was 83% of this
population, is only 12%

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:08.790
of this one.

00:44:08.790 --> 00:44:11.970
There are new haplotypes,
including mine, haplogroup H,

00:44:11.970 --> 00:44:15.650
that arrived in Europe
after the advent of farming.

00:44:15.650 --> 00:44:19.450
So Europe is a dynamic place.

00:44:19.450 --> 00:44:23.000
And we now have through ancient
DNA time slices of this.

00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:26.220
And we can show that the
ancestors that we once

00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:28.490
were thinking we're
tracing our descent

00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:30.590
from these first
Europeans actually

00:44:30.590 --> 00:44:34.750
have almost nothing to do with
today's European populations.

00:44:34.750 --> 00:44:40.670
And Europe has undergone a
succession of colonizations

00:44:40.670 --> 00:44:42.270
from other places.

00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:44.780
This is almost certainly
not unique to Europe.

00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:47.510
This is almost certainly the
history of recent humans,

00:44:47.510 --> 00:44:49.810
that our population
has been dynamic.

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:51.770
And the ancient
archaeological remains

00:44:51.770 --> 00:44:55.960
that we have are
by and large not

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:59.340
the ancestors of living people.

00:44:59.340 --> 00:45:00.840
So of course, the
other side of that

00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:03.520
is that once we look
at ancient DNA remains,

00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:05.840
we can get a better
resolution on how

00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:10.680
those ancient DNA remains are
connected to living people.

00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.670
And through that
process, reconstruct

00:45:13.670 --> 00:45:15.710
the ancestral populations.

00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:18.710
So this is some of the
work from David Reich's lab

00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:19.790
here at Harvard.

00:45:19.790 --> 00:45:22.370
And you can see that there
is a reconstruction here

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:26.550
of where Europeans came from
based on what we've learned

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:29.440
from ancient genomes from
Europe and from other parts

00:45:29.440 --> 00:45:30.400
of the world.

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:33.140
And you can start to say
that there were populations

00:45:33.140 --> 00:45:36.430
in the past that we
haven't necessarily

00:45:36.430 --> 00:45:39.420
sampled well
archaeologically that are

00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:42.940
source populations that have
contributed to today's people

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:44.400
through mixture.

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.790
And we can start
to get a picture

00:45:45.790 --> 00:45:47.920
of how those mixtures happened.

00:45:47.920 --> 00:45:50.570
This is all happening
through ancient DNA.

00:45:50.570 --> 00:45:53.650
As a consequence, when we look
at recent prehistoric humans,

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:56.380
the kinds of cultural
changes that we see-- I'm

00:45:56.380 --> 00:45:58.550
going to use the example
of language shifts.

00:45:58.550 --> 00:46:00.660
But things like the
advent of farming,

00:46:00.660 --> 00:46:02.792
things like the advent
of the Bronze Age,

00:46:02.792 --> 00:46:04.250
the things that
archaeologists have

00:46:04.250 --> 00:46:08.340
been trying to track for more
than 150 years, those things we

00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:11.620
now recognize are in
large part mediated

00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:14.770
by the growth and
dispersal of relatively

00:46:14.770 --> 00:46:17.050
consanguineous populations.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.800
These are people that actually
expanded and carried with them

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:22.610
stuff, and the ways
that they made things,

00:46:22.610 --> 00:46:24.295
and the languages they used.

00:46:24.295 --> 00:46:26.420
And of course, we've had
this idea for a long time.

00:46:26.420 --> 00:46:28.790
Of course, many of you
know the Proto-European

00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:32.000
as an ancestor of today's
Indo-European languages

00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:35.740
is reconstructed to have
originated somewhere

00:46:35.740 --> 00:46:37.030
in Central Asia.

00:46:37.030 --> 00:46:40.020
And we've studied
the language shifts

00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:42.570
that have happened through
probably the spread

00:46:42.570 --> 00:46:43.700
of these language groups.

00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:47.750
For example, the Celtic
languages into Western Europe,

00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:50.440
the way that people must-- the
way that languages must have

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:56.330
moved and the Iranian languages
of Central Asia and into India.

00:46:56.330 --> 00:47:00.190
We now can recognize that
these sorts of phenomenon

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:02.040
were actually
mediated by people.

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:03.560
The people were moving.

00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:09.260
And that phenomenon that we can
see in recent prehistoric times

00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:12.590
was almost certainly the mode
of dispersal of ancient people

00:47:12.590 --> 00:47:18.240
long before we have these kinds
of archaeological records.

00:47:18.240 --> 00:47:19.990
Well, we've learned
not only about the way

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:21.490
that populations
move and interact.

00:47:21.490 --> 00:47:24.115
We've learned about the way that
these populations have changed

00:47:24.115 --> 00:47:25.250
through natural selection.

00:47:25.250 --> 00:47:27.150
One of the realizations
that we have had,

00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:32.800
and I'm using slide of Tibet
here to remind myself that,

00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:35.660
is that genes that we've gotten
from these ancient groups

00:47:35.660 --> 00:47:38.270
sometimes are useful
to us and actually

00:47:38.270 --> 00:47:41.550
make us able to do things
that we wouldn't do otherwise.

00:47:41.550 --> 00:47:44.810
In Tibet, people are highly
able to live at high altitude

00:47:44.810 --> 00:47:46.460
and to have more
normal birth weight

00:47:46.460 --> 00:47:49.330
children at high altitude
by function of changes

00:47:49.330 --> 00:47:52.730
to their circulatory system,
changes to their blood.

00:47:52.730 --> 00:47:55.750
One gene involved in
this, a gene called EPAS1,

00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:58.870
has an allele which is common
in Tibetan peoples, which

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:01.810
is very rare in nearby
peoples in lowland China.

00:48:01.810 --> 00:48:05.040
And that this allele's
most close relatives

00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:08.430
that we know of in anywhere,
any archaeological or living

00:48:08.430 --> 00:48:11.830
population, are the
Denisova genome.

00:48:11.830 --> 00:48:14.060
So we have here the
origination of what

00:48:14.060 --> 00:48:16.270
is today an effective
adaptation to a very

00:48:16.270 --> 00:48:18.200
unique extreme environment.

00:48:18.200 --> 00:48:20.100
We don't know the
Denisovans were

00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:21.970
living in the highland
plateau of Tibet.

00:48:21.970 --> 00:48:24.310
We don't have an archaeological
record put in there.

00:48:24.310 --> 00:48:27.430
But we can say that the
raw material of variation

00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:31.230
that came from this population
was made use of in later humans

00:48:31.230 --> 00:48:33.220
to adapt to this
extreme environment.

00:48:33.220 --> 00:48:37.150
We're in other words, changing
as a function of interbreeding

00:48:37.150 --> 00:48:38.420
with these ancient people.

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:41.520
It's useful to us in some cases.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:43.730
And of course, I am sorry
I put up this table.

00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:47.280
But they did have
a graph for this.

00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:49.530
And of course, we've
been changing recently.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:51.360
And this is a great
chart that shows it.

00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:54.920
These are three genes that
are involved in pigmentation

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:56.570
in human populations.

00:48:56.570 --> 00:48:59.040
And the one that I want
to draw your attention to

00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:01.080
is all the way over
here on the right side.

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:04.980
This is the frequency of
the light pigmented version

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:07.760
of these genes today
in the Ukraine.

00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:11.810
So this one HERC2, which
is eye color related,

00:49:11.810 --> 00:49:14.660
has frequency today of 65%.

00:49:14.660 --> 00:49:20.100
This one SLC45A2, which is
pigmentation related, is 92%.

00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.190
These are the frequencies
in Ukrainian archaeological

00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:25.700
samples from around
5,000 years ago.

00:49:25.700 --> 00:49:28.250
You can see that these
genes that make people

00:49:28.250 --> 00:49:30.672
light pigmented today are new.

00:49:30.672 --> 00:49:32.130
They haven't been
around that long,

00:49:32.130 --> 00:49:34.020
and they've been
growing in frequency

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.860
during archaeological time.

00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:37.940
In other words, when
we look at the past,

00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:41.530
the recent past, the
past of a few generations

00:49:41.530 --> 00:49:44.700
ago, we're looking at
people that in many cases

00:49:44.700 --> 00:49:48.336
are different from the people
that are their descendants.

00:49:48.336 --> 00:49:50.460
And of course, there have
been population movements

00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:52.420
that also contribute
to those differences.

00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:54.439
But when we look over
time, some things

00:49:54.439 --> 00:49:55.480
are becoming more common.

00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.230
Because they're useful,
things like milk drinking,

00:49:58.230 --> 00:50:01.870
lactase persistence, things like
genes related to pigmentation.

00:50:01.870 --> 00:50:03.800
We've discovered
through ancient DNA

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:07.120
the beginnings states of
some populations in these.

00:50:07.120 --> 00:50:11.470
And you can see how the
genes grow over time.

00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:12.980
Humans are changing.

00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:14.900
And it's a really
exciting thing to think

00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:17.420
that we can see that
happen now through looking

00:50:17.420 --> 00:50:19.600
at the ancient genes.

00:50:19.600 --> 00:50:21.950
Finally, ancient DNA
is changing the way

00:50:21.950 --> 00:50:24.660
that we actually conduct
archaeological excavations.

00:50:24.660 --> 00:50:25.660
And this is a great one.

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:27.201
This is from a site
called El Sidron.

00:50:27.201 --> 00:50:29.010
And this is my
friend Antonio Rosas

00:50:29.010 --> 00:50:32.170
at the bottom, who's one of the
main anthropologists working

00:50:32.170 --> 00:50:32.870
at the site.

00:50:32.870 --> 00:50:35.920
And you can see the guy in
the bunny suit who is getting

00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.420
ready to go into this cave.

00:50:37.420 --> 00:50:39.420
This cave is a really
constrained place.

00:50:39.420 --> 00:50:42.440
And you've got to work in this
little place wearing this bunny

00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:43.060
suit.

00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:45.760
And he's got his samples
that he's carrying out.

00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:47.700
We're actually
really careful now

00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:49.820
about how we treat
ancient remains

00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.890
knowing that some of the most
valuable evidence that can come

00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:55.580
from them is DNA that, as
I'm sure Beth will tell you,

00:50:55.580 --> 00:50:57.780
is highly fragmented,
hard to get,

00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:01.820
and demands that we tried
to eliminate, to the extent

00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:05.510
that we can,
contamination sources.

00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:08.190
I've been recently involved
in the Rising Star Project.

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.910
And last month, we
were fortunately

00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:14.710
able to announce the fossil
remains that we've discovered,

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:19.320
which now at more
than 1,500 specimens

00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:23.490
are the most abundant fossil
hominin site ever discovered

00:51:23.490 --> 00:51:24.990
in Africa.

00:51:24.990 --> 00:51:28.610
We named on this basis a
new species, Homo naledi.

00:51:28.610 --> 00:51:30.500
There was some news about this.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:33.260
And so it's a really
exciting thing.

00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.770
We're working in a very
constrained cave, a cave where

00:51:36.770 --> 00:51:40.500
our team has to access the
chamber with the fossils

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.890
through a very narrow 18
centimeter wide crack that

00:51:43.890 --> 00:51:46.280
is a 12 meter free climb
down to the bottom,

00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.960
that they have to wedge
themselves down through.

00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:52.400
To do this kind of work, we
recruited through Facebook

00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:57.710
a number of, where else
would you find them,

00:51:57.710 --> 00:51:59.420
extremely skilled
archaeologists who

00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:02.500
also have this kind of climbing
and caving ability and also

00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:08.464
have the dimensions to fit
through this very narrow chasm.

00:52:08.464 --> 00:52:10.130
And I'll tell you
that there's all kinds

00:52:10.130 --> 00:52:13.340
of exciting things about this
and the way that we work.

00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:17.120
But we're working in this fossil
chamber that, at the moment,

00:52:17.120 --> 00:52:19.540
is a bed of fossil hominin bone.

00:52:19.540 --> 00:52:21.539
And our team is on
bare foot protocol

00:52:21.539 --> 00:52:23.705
to make sure that they're
not stepping on something.

00:52:23.705 --> 00:52:26.090
It gives them that
sensory ability.

00:52:26.090 --> 00:52:28.950
Now, when I told my
ancient DNA colleagues

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:33.540
that I've got barefoot people
walking through the cave

00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:36.160
to make sure that we
don't damage things

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:37.650
they started to scream.

00:52:37.650 --> 00:52:41.480
I mean, it was like, oh
my god, the contamination.

00:52:41.480 --> 00:52:43.240
In fact, we do
quite a lot to try

00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:45.240
to avoid contamination
and collect

00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.580
samples that are
collected in relatively

00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:48.955
sterile circumstances.

00:52:48.955 --> 00:52:50.580
And of course,
technology has developed

00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:53.720
to the point where we can
differentiate in a lot of cases

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:56.630
the kind of modern
contaminants from ancient DNA,

00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:58.830
actual endogenous ancient DNA.

00:52:58.830 --> 00:53:03.730
So we're pretty-- even
our excavation conducted

00:53:03.730 --> 00:53:06.340
under relatively
extreme circumstances

00:53:06.340 --> 00:53:09.270
is one in which we're
changing practices

00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:13.140
to make it possible to get
evidence from this ancient DNA

00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:14.040
source.

00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:16.730
You start seeing that take hold
across a field, where people

00:53:16.730 --> 00:53:18.370
recognize the importance of it.

00:53:18.370 --> 00:53:21.890
They recognize universally
what you're learning from it.

00:53:21.890 --> 00:53:25.950
And they recognize that this
is contributing new information

00:53:25.950 --> 00:53:28.810
that they could not have
gotten by any other means.

00:53:28.810 --> 00:53:31.670
And what it tells
you is that we now

00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:34.690
have a field that's been
transformed by the application

00:53:34.690 --> 00:53:36.420
of DNA technology.

00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.320
And it is hard to
imagine where this is

00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:41.040
going to take us in the future.

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.860
But if you told me 10 years
ago that it would take us

00:53:43.860 --> 00:53:48.030
to the point where some of
these real bold elephants

00:53:48.030 --> 00:53:52.090
of anthropology were all
sitting at a table agreeing

00:53:52.090 --> 00:53:54.180
with each other about
the basic facts,

00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.780
I would say that you were
talking about science fiction.

00:53:56.780 --> 00:54:01.290
So ancient DNA has done
more than contribute

00:54:01.290 --> 00:54:03.300
to our knowledge
of human evolution.

00:54:03.300 --> 00:54:06.040
It's actually advanced
the process of science

00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:09.487
by making us able to look
at facts where previously we

00:54:09.487 --> 00:54:11.570
were working only with
theoretical preconceptions.

00:54:24.550 --> 00:54:25.145
-Beth Shapiro.

00:54:25.145 --> 00:54:27.300
-Very impressive timing.

00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.345
-Yeah, that was amazing.

00:54:29.345 --> 00:54:30.720
-Make sure this
is going to work,

00:54:30.720 --> 00:54:35.710
because I am too short
to stand behind a podium.

00:54:35.710 --> 00:54:36.900
I've come to accept that.

00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:38.570
It's life, right?

00:54:38.570 --> 00:54:42.600
All right, so this is the past,
present, and future of stuff.

00:54:42.600 --> 00:54:46.300
So I thought I would start by
just talking about the past,

00:54:46.300 --> 00:54:48.830
present, and future of
this field that I work in,

00:54:48.830 --> 00:54:52.160
that John so very nicely
gave a overwhelmingly

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:54.740
supportive introduction to.

00:54:54.740 --> 00:54:55.400
Let's see.

00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.110
I will get to cloning
mammoths, but it

00:54:58.110 --> 00:55:00.510
will be toward the end
in the future section.

00:55:00.510 --> 00:55:02.930
Because we haven't done it yet.

00:55:02.930 --> 00:55:06.830
Although, George is
trying very hard.

00:55:06.830 --> 00:55:10.030
So ancient DNA, it all
started way, way back

00:55:10.030 --> 00:55:14.370
in the early 1980s when
a team of researchers

00:55:14.370 --> 00:55:16.760
in Allan Wilson's
lab at Berkeley,

00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:19.170
they called themselves
the extinct species study

00:55:19.170 --> 00:55:22.760
group, extracted in sequence
the tiny little fragment

00:55:22.760 --> 00:55:26.450
of mitochondrial
DNA from the skin,

00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:28.080
museum preserved
skin, of this guy.

00:55:28.080 --> 00:55:29.460
This is a quagga.

00:55:29.460 --> 00:55:31.780
They were able to sequence
a little bit of DNA

00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:32.610
from this thing.

00:55:32.610 --> 00:55:38.070
And wait for it, it turns out
it's related to the zebra.

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:43.310
So it wasn't exactly a
overwhelming exciting

00:55:43.310 --> 00:55:47.090
scientific result.
But the idea that DNA

00:55:47.090 --> 00:55:50.150
was preserved in things
after they died was new.

00:55:50.150 --> 00:55:51.500
And this was pretty exciting.

00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:54.020
It actually set off a
whirlwind of research.

00:55:54.020 --> 00:55:56.530
People started to extract DNA
from pretty much everything

00:55:56.530 --> 00:55:57.510
they could find.

00:55:57.510 --> 00:56:01.150
There were mummies that
had DNA in them, probably.

00:56:01.150 --> 00:56:04.070
There were Miocene aged leaves.

00:56:04.070 --> 00:56:08.130
And before we knew it, there
were dinosaur DNA sequences

00:56:08.130 --> 00:56:13.220
being published from things
that were entombed in amber.

00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:18.990
The problem with all of this
stuff is that it wasn't real.

00:56:18.990 --> 00:56:22.090
We come to know now
despite being published

00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:24.140
in very high profile
journals there

00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:27.880
were quite a few papers that
should have been retracted.

00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.800
I don't think ever
have been retracted.

00:56:29.800 --> 00:56:34.170
But everything about dinosaur
DNA, for example, is not true.

00:56:34.170 --> 00:56:37.650
And the reason is because
DNA does not last forever.

00:56:37.650 --> 00:56:40.560
As soon as an
organism dies, the DNA

00:56:40.560 --> 00:56:42.140
that's within all
of its cells starts

00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:44.840
to break down into smaller
and smaller pieces.

00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:48.120
One of the things that causes
this DNA decay is the sun.

00:56:48.120 --> 00:56:50.420
So when we're alive
and we go outside,

00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:53.360
the sun, UV radiation from
the sun, hits our cells

00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.810
and actually breaks our DNA.

00:56:54.810 --> 00:56:57.160
But we have proofreading
enzymes that will

00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.920
go along and fix this damage.

00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.045
So we don't get cancer
every time we walk outside.

00:57:01.045 --> 00:57:04.120
Of course, these are all
energy requiring processes.

00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:06.050
And after you're
dead, you no longer

00:57:06.050 --> 00:57:10.750
have any energy, so UV
radiation, oxygen, water,

00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:13.610
enzymes that are in microbes
that are in the gut.

00:57:13.610 --> 00:57:17.034
If the gut bursts during
decay, all those microbes

00:57:17.034 --> 00:57:18.700
go circulating around
the body, starting

00:57:18.700 --> 00:57:21.790
breaking down that DNA into
smaller and smaller fragments.

00:57:21.790 --> 00:57:24.340
Also tons of
microorganisms in the soil.

00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:26.690
When these fossils are
sitting in the soil,

00:57:26.690 --> 00:57:29.060
these microorganisms
will colonize the bone,

00:57:29.060 --> 00:57:32.440
break down the DNA into
smaller and smaller pieces

00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:34.700
until eventually DNA,
which when you're

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:38.170
alive you can think of as these
massive long strands of party

00:57:38.170 --> 00:57:40.830
streamers, look
more like confetti.

00:57:40.830 --> 00:57:43.800
But not really attractive
confetti like this,

00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:47.160
like the confetti from
the New Year's parade

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:51.040
that emerges after the last
snow melts in the Kmart parking

00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:58.780
lot in April, or May if
you're in Edmonton, as many

00:57:58.780 --> 00:58:00.330
of my friends are.

00:58:00.330 --> 00:58:01.930
So yes, DNA degrades.

00:58:01.930 --> 00:58:05.070
And this process will
continue at a rate that

00:58:05.070 --> 00:58:08.110
depends on where the bone
is actually preserved

00:58:08.110 --> 00:58:10.210
in cold and dry places.

00:58:10.210 --> 00:58:12.940
Or cold places that are pretty
much temperature stable,

00:58:12.940 --> 00:58:15.100
the DNA lasts for
longer than it tends

00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:18.430
to last in warm and hot places.

00:58:18.430 --> 00:58:20.850
And today, the oldest
DNA that is known

00:58:20.850 --> 00:58:23.840
comes from this place where I
spent a lot of my time outside

00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:26.610
of Dawson City in
Canada's Yukon territory,

00:58:26.610 --> 00:58:29.910
where we find all of this
frozen sediment that's up there.

00:58:29.910 --> 00:58:34.650
And this oldest DNA is
about 700,000 years old.

00:58:34.650 --> 00:58:36.290
The reason that we
know it's that old

00:58:36.290 --> 00:58:41.000
is because in places like
this part of the world,

00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.880
we find these
volcanic ash layers.

00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:44.430
This white layer
here is actually

00:58:44.430 --> 00:58:46.880
from an eruption, a volcanic
eruption, that happened.

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:50.260
This particular eruption
was about 80,000 years ago.

00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:52.570
And we know that by dating
it using different methods

00:58:52.570 --> 00:58:54.940
like thermal
luminescence dating.

00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:58.620
So we found this particular
bone, this 700,000 year old

00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:01.580
bone, in association
with an ash layer

00:59:01.580 --> 00:59:04.410
from an eruption that happened
somewhere around 680,000

00:59:04.410 --> 00:59:05.950
or 700,000 years.

00:59:05.950 --> 00:59:07.980
So we know how
old this bone was.

00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:11.800
And the DNA in this bone
was in terrible condition.

00:59:11.800 --> 00:59:12.970
There was very little of it.

00:59:12.970 --> 00:59:15.350
It was highly damaged
and highly fragmented.

00:59:15.350 --> 00:59:18.040
But we were still able to
generate enough data from it

00:59:18.040 --> 00:59:21.510
to sequence a complete
genome of a horse-- it's just

00:59:21.510 --> 00:59:24.730
a regular horse, the kind of
horse that still lives all

00:59:24.730 --> 00:59:27.510
over the place today,
Equus caballus--

00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:30.970
and start to learn about how
horses had evolved and changed

00:59:30.970 --> 00:59:32.220
through time.

00:59:32.220 --> 00:59:36.990
Now, 700,000 years is a lot
more recent than 65 million,

00:59:36.990 --> 00:59:39.540
or 85 million, or even
100 million years,

00:59:39.540 --> 00:59:42.410
which is how far back we have
to go to get dinosaur DNA.

00:59:42.410 --> 00:59:46.160
So for the time being
at least, Jurassic Park,

00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:49.270
at least as it was in
the mind of Michael

00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:51.530
Crichton and the many
writers, and producers,

00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:54.740
and directors who continued
this chain of fantastic

00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:59.580
blockbuster scientific
films, will remain

00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:01.820
a thing of science fiction.

01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:03.130
Sorry.

01:00:03.130 --> 01:00:05.000
But it is not all sadness.

01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.210
And there are some
incredibly well

01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:09.550
preserved remains
that are found.

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:13.220
And that we now know have
quite a lot of DNA in them.

01:00:13.220 --> 01:00:15.910
That mummified mammoth that
you see up here in the corner,

01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:18.700
this is one that was found up
in the New Siberian islands

01:00:18.700 --> 01:00:20.380
a couple of summers
ago that was thought

01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.815
to be associated with blood.

01:00:21.815 --> 01:00:26.070
It was of a thick red,
black, viscous substance.

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:28.350
That I'm told they've
discovered now was not blood,

01:00:28.350 --> 01:00:31.385
but instead what is officially
known as corpse juice.

01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:37.500
Nonetheless, whether or not
it's blood or corpse juice,

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:40.470
this is an incredibly
well preserved specimen.

01:00:40.470 --> 01:00:44.370
And we are able to extract and
sequence DNA from these things.

01:00:44.370 --> 01:00:48.510
So the field is called ancient
DNA for obvious reasons.

01:00:48.510 --> 01:00:50.790
And as I explain
it now, I'm just

01:00:50.790 --> 01:00:53.230
going to go through a
little bit, a short history,

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:56.240
of different parts of it, my
involvement with ancient DNA

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.470
really in the past
and the present

01:00:58.470 --> 01:01:00.350
and then get to the future.

01:01:00.350 --> 01:01:02.800
So the past of ancient
DNA is not very long.

01:01:02.800 --> 01:01:05.770
I started working in
ancient DNA in 1999.

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:08.970
I was at Oxford University
in Allan Cooper's lab.

01:01:08.970 --> 01:01:10.860
We were one of the only
labs at the time that

01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:13.390
were really focusing
on extracting DNA

01:01:13.390 --> 01:01:14.360
from ancient remains.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:17.920
So it was pretty lucky that
we got in there at this time.

01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.800
I work mostly in a part of
the world called Beringia.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:22.000
This is Beringia here.

01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.830
It spans Alaska,
the Yukon territory

01:01:24.830 --> 01:01:28.380
here, across the Bering
Strait and into-- that's

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.720
the part of the world that
Sarah Palin, remember her,

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.740
can see from her backyard.

01:01:32.740 --> 01:01:35.280
It's too bad she's not involved
in this particular race yet.

01:01:35.280 --> 01:01:36.784
Isn't it?

01:01:36.784 --> 01:01:39.608
No it's not.

01:01:39.608 --> 01:01:41.910
Do you see that
the sea level here?

01:01:41.910 --> 01:01:43.980
This light coloration
here indicates

01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:48.230
the sea level is a lot--
it's shallower there.

01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:50.520
And so during the
Ice Ages when a lot

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:52.900
of the water on the
planet was taken up

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:54.750
into forming massive
glaciers that it

01:01:54.750 --> 01:01:56.500
sat on top of the
continents, the sea

01:01:56.500 --> 01:01:57.700
was lower than it is today.

01:01:57.700 --> 01:01:59.370
And this was actually exposed.

01:01:59.370 --> 01:02:01.720
It was a very
important land bridge

01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:05.470
for the movement of plants and
animals between the continents.

01:02:05.470 --> 01:02:07.300
And we had lots of movements.

01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:11.310
Horses and camels moved from
North America into Asia.

01:02:11.310 --> 01:02:13.930
Bison, things like that,
humans moved from Asia

01:02:13.930 --> 01:02:15.360
into North America.

01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:18.180
It was a really very
important conduit.

01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:20.270
Today, Beringia looks
a lot like this.

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:22.080
I'm in this-- I'm
taking this picture

01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.090
from this lovely helicopter.

01:02:24.090 --> 01:02:26.902
This is in the Taimyr Peninsula
in North Central Siberia.

01:02:26.902 --> 01:02:28.610
I'll show you the
helicopter in a minute.

01:02:28.610 --> 01:02:31.430
Because it's awesome.

01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:33.280
But in the past it
looked more like this,

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:39.110
where there was a rich
diversity of plants and animals

01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:42.220
and included things like
mammoths, and mastodons,

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.020
and woolly rhinos.

01:02:43.020 --> 01:02:44.603
They never made it
into North America,

01:02:44.603 --> 01:02:46.589
but they were pretty
abundant in Siberia.

01:02:46.589 --> 01:02:48.130
There were a couple
different species

01:02:48.130 --> 01:02:49.560
of horses in North America.

01:02:49.560 --> 01:02:51.770
There were crazy
things like giant bears

01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:54.920
that if stood up like this
would be 15 16 feet tall.

01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:57.750
We killed them.

01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:05.070
My favorite extinct animal, the
giant beaver, my size beaver.

01:03:05.070 --> 01:03:07.160
It's just the funniest
extinct animal.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:09.080
And so we go out
into these places.

01:03:09.080 --> 01:03:10.892
And we fly in these
stellar machineries.

01:03:10.892 --> 01:03:13.100
I told you I was going to
show you a picture of this.

01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:14.030
You'll notice that
there is actually

01:03:14.030 --> 01:03:16.530
some glass missing from
some of these windows, which

01:03:16.530 --> 01:03:17.440
is really good.

01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:20.220
Because these gas
tanks here that

01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:22.630
take up most of the inside,
that's where we sat.

01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:26.110
And after we took off
and celebrated the fact

01:03:26.110 --> 01:03:27.900
that we had gotten
off on the air,

01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:30.480
some of the people who were
sitting on these gas tanks

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:36.130
decided that smoking was
a good way to celebrate.

01:03:36.130 --> 01:03:39.350
So at least we had the windows
to let the cigarette smoke out.

01:03:39.350 --> 01:03:42.310
We stay in five
star accommodation.

01:03:42.310 --> 01:03:43.050
That's my tent.

01:03:43.050 --> 01:03:46.770
I took this picture by backing
up and unfocusing my camera.

01:03:46.770 --> 01:03:49.300
So you could see the depth
of field of mosquitoes

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:51.390
that we would deal with there.

01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:54.144
And we wander along
collecting bones.

01:03:54.144 --> 01:03:56.310
This is actually from near
Dawson City in the Yukon.

01:03:56.310 --> 01:03:58.240
There is active
gold mining going

01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:01.690
on there called placer mining
where these miners are washing

01:04:01.690 --> 01:04:04.690
away this frozen dirt to try
to get to the gold bearing

01:04:04.690 --> 01:04:05.750
gravels that are beneath.

01:04:05.750 --> 01:04:08.390
But as they're doing
that, thousands of bones,

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:09.970
really well preserved
bones that look

01:04:09.970 --> 01:04:13.220
like they could be a couple
years old or even modern,

01:04:13.220 --> 01:04:13.950
come out of this.

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.330
And we walk around
and collect them.

01:04:15.330 --> 01:04:16.913
In an average day
of working up there,

01:04:16.913 --> 01:04:21.380
we can collect something like 30
or 40 bags that look like this.

01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:25.760
Those are mostly horse, bison,
reindeer, and mammoth bones.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:27.510
But when we get lucky,
we get a carnivore.

01:04:27.510 --> 01:04:29.426
They had smaller
populations, but we can still

01:04:29.426 --> 01:04:32.210
find them, sometimes wolves
and bears, giant bears.

01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:34.050
We take a chunk out
of each of these bones

01:04:34.050 --> 01:04:36.010
and take them back to the lab.

01:04:36.010 --> 01:04:37.330
And we can do this over time.

01:04:37.330 --> 01:04:40.150
So we know how old all of
these different bones are.

01:04:40.150 --> 01:04:42.300
And we measure the amount
of genetic diversity

01:04:42.300 --> 01:04:44.530
that's in these
populations over time

01:04:44.530 --> 01:04:47.750
by extracting DNA and
sequencing a bit of that.

01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:50.640
And then we can use those
measures of genetic diversity

01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.380
and a statistical approach
called coalescent theory

01:04:53.380 --> 01:04:56.700
to translate diversity
into population size.

01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:59.680
And so we could come up with
these plots of how populations

01:04:59.680 --> 01:05:01.295
changed in size,
a big population

01:05:01.295 --> 01:05:03.820
sometime in the past
going to a smaller

01:05:03.820 --> 01:05:05.940
population in the present day.

01:05:05.940 --> 01:05:08.080
And we've generated
population level data

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:11.440
sets, hundreds of individuals,
for about a dozen species

01:05:11.440 --> 01:05:11.940
so far.

01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:13.840
And here's just four
of them to give you

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.630
a taste of what we can learn.

01:05:16.630 --> 01:05:19.560
The top graphs with
the colored background

01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:21.590
show a reconstruction
of how much

01:05:21.590 --> 01:05:24.580
habitat was available to
these animals over time.

01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:28.450
And this time scale goes
through the last 50,000 years.

01:05:28.450 --> 01:05:30.940
The tick marks here are
the fossils, the dates,

01:05:30.940 --> 01:05:33.510
that we use to make
these reconstructions.

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:36.100
So the top line is the amount
of habitat that they had.

01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:38.610
And then this lower line with
these confidence intervals

01:05:38.610 --> 01:05:42.060
around it are how big
their populations are.

01:05:42.060 --> 01:05:44.650
So you can see from
this that as the amount

01:05:44.650 --> 01:05:47.830
of habitat available to each
of these species increases,

01:05:47.830 --> 01:05:49.570
so do their populations.

01:05:49.570 --> 01:05:51.900
And as the amount of
habitat decreases,

01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:53.520
so do their populations.

01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:56.970
So these animals are really
responding opportunistically,

01:05:56.970 --> 01:05:59.732
dynamically to the
amount of stuff

01:05:59.732 --> 01:06:00.940
that's there for them to eat.

01:06:00.940 --> 01:06:03.070
You notice that
none of the species

01:06:03.070 --> 01:06:04.781
that I've put up on
here-- and you'll

01:06:04.781 --> 01:06:06.280
notice with these
stuffed toys here,

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:09.370
you can clearly see that this
is horses, bison, caribou,

01:06:09.370 --> 01:06:11.190
and musk ox.

01:06:11.190 --> 01:06:12.450
None of these are extinct.

01:06:12.450 --> 01:06:14.300
That's because when
species are extinct,

01:06:14.300 --> 01:06:18.160
it's very hard to reconstruct
their population dynamics.

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:21.790
What we found in doing this work
is that as populations declined

01:06:21.790 --> 01:06:26.690
toward extinction, we didn't see
a decline in genetic diversity.

01:06:26.690 --> 01:06:29.620
What instead we saw
was that we were

01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:32.520
seeing an increase in the
amount of genetic distance

01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:33.670
between individuals.

01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:36.170
So what it looks like is
happening as species approach

01:06:36.170 --> 01:06:39.850
extinction is the habitats are
becoming more and more patchy.

01:06:39.850 --> 01:06:43.890
And individuals are getting
stuck in these patchy habitats.

01:06:43.890 --> 01:06:45.860
And then all of
these patchy habitats

01:06:45.860 --> 01:06:47.340
are declining simultaneously.

01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:50.700
So this approach of looking
at one genetic locus or two

01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:53.600
genetic locus and
trying to find out

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:55.960
when extinction is
happening in this way

01:06:55.960 --> 01:06:59.740
doesn't work in the case
of these types of animals.

01:06:59.740 --> 01:07:03.430
Fortunately, we have moved
on to the present day

01:07:03.430 --> 01:07:06.500
where we don't have to use
these one locus or two locus

01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:07.660
analyses anymore.

01:07:07.660 --> 01:07:10.350
Because instead, we
have this crazy type

01:07:10.350 --> 01:07:12.300
of new sequencing
technology that

01:07:12.300 --> 01:07:16.990
lets us see every little bit of
surviving DNA in these bones.

01:07:16.990 --> 01:07:18.710
We call this next
generation sequencing.

01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:20.390
This is one of
the fancy machines

01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:22.040
that you can buy for
around $1 million

01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:24.170
and go out and sequence
a whole bunch of DNA.

01:07:24.170 --> 01:07:27.810
And this has been absolutely
fantastic for ancient DNA.

01:07:27.810 --> 01:07:29.920
Will people working
with modern DNA

01:07:29.920 --> 01:07:31.950
complain a little bit
about these machines,

01:07:31.950 --> 01:07:34.950
because they can only sequence
short fragments of DNA

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:35.640
at a time?

01:07:35.640 --> 01:07:38.150
We don't care at
all, because we only

01:07:38.150 --> 01:07:39.950
have short fragments of DNA.

01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:41.350
And for this
reason, Alumina like

01:07:41.350 --> 01:07:43.400
to parade me around when
they're doing their sales

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:44.820
pitches as the person
who goes up and says

01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:45.505
this is a great machine.

01:07:45.505 --> 01:07:46.963
It does everything
I need it to do.

01:07:46.963 --> 01:07:49.582
Absolutely everything, nothing
wrong with it whatsoever.

01:07:49.582 --> 01:07:51.540
So the kind of things
that we can do-- and here

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:52.350
is just a plot.

01:07:52.350 --> 01:07:54.850
This is a paper that
we published recently,

01:07:54.850 --> 01:07:56.100
a couple weeks ago.

01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:58.360
This is a plot from
some bones that we

01:07:58.360 --> 01:07:59.470
collected in the Arctic.

01:07:59.470 --> 01:08:01.630
They're about 120,000 years old.

01:08:01.630 --> 01:08:05.230
And in the early 2000s, we
tried to extract DNA from them

01:08:05.230 --> 01:08:07.500
and amplify them up using
the traditional way.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.350
And we found absolutely nothing.

01:08:09.350 --> 01:08:12.220
We couldn't get any DNA out
of these bones whatsoever.

01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:13.890
And they're cool
bones, because they

01:08:13.890 --> 01:08:15.930
belong to a really
interesting species

01:08:15.930 --> 01:08:18.260
that I'll show you a
picture of in a minute.

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.870
So we decided we would go
back to these bones now using

01:08:20.870 --> 01:08:23.420
this new next generation
sequencing technology

01:08:23.420 --> 01:08:25.779
and see if there
is DNA in there,

01:08:25.779 --> 01:08:28.140
just two short
fragments of DNA to be

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.970
able to amplify using the
traditional technologies.

01:08:30.970 --> 01:08:31.760
And it's true.

01:08:31.760 --> 01:08:33.974
This is the fragment
length distribution

01:08:33.974 --> 01:08:34.890
for these three bones.

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:36.890
You see that the mean
fragment length of them

01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:39.090
is around 30 base pairs long.

01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:40.540
That's not just confetti.

01:08:40.540 --> 01:08:43.060
That's like the punch holes
from the pieces of paper

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.140
that you would get to
throw up in the air.

01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:50.640
Normally we get millions of
bases at a time, 35, again,

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.990
and somewhere around 30.

01:08:51.990 --> 01:08:53.840
These are terribly preserved.

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:56.100
The bottom plots also
show that the ends

01:08:56.100 --> 01:08:59.300
of each of these molecules
have typical types of damage

01:08:59.300 --> 01:09:00.830
that you see in ancient DNA.

01:09:00.830 --> 01:09:03.430
And this is a really cool
thing that this next generation

01:09:03.430 --> 01:09:05.479
sequencing technology
lets us see too.

01:09:05.479 --> 01:09:07.020
And gets back to
what John was saying

01:09:07.020 --> 01:09:10.479
about how we can tell the
difference between modern DNA

01:09:10.479 --> 01:09:14.040
contaminating DNA and
the real ancient stuff.

01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:16.450
Modern DNA doesn't
have this damage.

01:09:16.450 --> 01:09:17.770
But ancient DNA does.

01:09:17.770 --> 01:09:19.580
So if we have a
bone, a human bone,

01:09:19.580 --> 01:09:22.670
that we know has human DNA in
it, the first thing we can do

01:09:22.670 --> 01:09:24.950
is only look at
the molecules that

01:09:24.950 --> 01:09:26.859
have this signature of damage.

01:09:26.859 --> 01:09:29.950
And that will exclude, for the
most part, the contamination

01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:30.670
that's in there.

01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:33.060
So this particular
individual, this species

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:35.920
that we were interested in,
is the North American camel,

01:09:35.920 --> 01:09:37.550
Camelops hesternus.

01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:40.060
And it was a long
paleontological mystery,

01:09:40.060 --> 01:09:43.779
which kind of camel this thing
was most closely related to.

01:09:43.779 --> 01:09:46.680
New world camels, which
are lamas, and alpacas,

01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:49.109
and vicunas, things like
that, or old world camels,

01:09:49.109 --> 01:09:51.609
the dromedary and
Bactrian camels.

01:09:51.609 --> 01:09:53.250
Most people thought
it was new world.

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:55.780
Turns out we have this
paleontological information

01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:56.900
from aging DNA.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.800
That in fact, they are
more closely related

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:01.400
to old world camels
than new world camels.

01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:03.230
So it's not as
exciting as humans

01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:05.680
have-- there's a new human.

01:10:05.680 --> 01:10:07.800
But camels are interesting.

01:10:07.800 --> 01:10:10.700
Other things we can do
with ancient DNA-- I'm just

01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:13.500
going to do one more
thing to try to give you

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:17.050
just a taste of what
we can do after we have

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:21.440
these ancient genome--
is study the consequences

01:10:21.440 --> 01:10:22.980
of the evolutionary
consequences,

01:10:22.980 --> 01:10:25.070
genomic consequences,
of different processes.

01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:27.050
And one of these
is domestication.

01:10:27.050 --> 01:10:28.760
We had a paper
last year where we

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.180
looked at the process
of horse domestication.

01:10:31.180 --> 01:10:35.430
So ancient DNA on these orange
things are ancient horses.

01:10:35.430 --> 01:10:37.500
The blue ones are modern horses.

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:40.710
These are the Przewalskis,
which is a wild modern horse.

01:10:40.710 --> 01:10:42.950
You see that according
to mitochondrial DNA

01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:47.420
there is a ton of
diversity in horses.

01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:49.480
A lot of horse females
were presumably

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:52.700
used in the domestication
process, but very few males.

01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.290
We have nuclear genomes now
from a couple of different horse

01:10:55.290 --> 01:10:56.170
genomes.

01:10:56.170 --> 01:10:58.120
And because there seems
to be a lot of-- there

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.490
seems to be a mixture
between these wild horses

01:11:00.490 --> 01:11:01.370
and modern horses.

01:11:01.370 --> 01:11:04.850
We can't learn about the process
of domestication looking only

01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:06.020
at modern DNA.

01:11:06.020 --> 01:11:08.570
So we sequenced complete
genomes from a couple of horses

01:11:08.570 --> 01:11:10.940
that we know were not
domestic, because they lived

01:11:10.940 --> 01:11:12.800
before domestication happened.

01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:15.300
And were able to then
scan through their genomes

01:11:15.300 --> 01:11:17.710
using a variety of
approaches and identify

01:11:17.710 --> 01:11:20.370
parts of the genome
that look like they

01:11:20.370 --> 01:11:22.910
have been under selection
since domestication.

01:11:22.910 --> 01:11:25.580
These are the genes
that were the product

01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:27.500
of the domestication process.

01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.400
And we found a lot
of different things

01:11:29.400 --> 01:11:30.940
that we expected to find.

01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.960
We found genes that
have been associated

01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:36.150
with different behavior,
being nicer, being calmer,

01:11:36.150 --> 01:11:37.840
being tamer.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:39.305
Genes associated
with pigmentation,

01:11:39.305 --> 01:11:41.180
we knew that these genes
were under selection

01:11:41.180 --> 01:11:42.300
and domestication.

01:11:42.300 --> 01:11:45.490
And genes associated
with their agility,

01:11:45.490 --> 01:11:47.069
ataxia genes, et cetera.

01:11:47.069 --> 01:11:48.610
We also found a
whole bunch of things

01:11:48.610 --> 01:11:49.943
that we don't know what they do.

01:11:49.943 --> 01:11:52.190
So the next step
in this is to try

01:11:52.190 --> 01:11:54.150
to use different
types of experiments

01:11:54.150 --> 01:11:56.700
and make these genes
express in tissue culture

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.120
and figure out what's going on.

01:11:58.120 --> 01:12:01.060
So ancient DNA can
show us where to look

01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:05.470
to better understand different
evolutionary processes.

01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:06.930
And now on to the future.

01:12:06.930 --> 01:12:10.570
So what does the future of
ancient DNA have for us?

01:12:10.570 --> 01:12:13.590
So we study a lot of
different things in my lab.

01:12:13.590 --> 01:12:16.510
We study all of these
large mammals that used

01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:17.950
to live during the Ice Age.

01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:19.390
We study domestication.

01:12:19.390 --> 01:12:21.810
We study adaptation
to climate change.

01:12:21.810 --> 01:12:25.530
We try to better understand
how populations and species

01:12:25.530 --> 01:12:28.870
responded to changes to their
habitat that were associated

01:12:28.870 --> 01:12:30.040
with the last Ice Age.

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:34.250
Because we want to be able to
make more informed decisions

01:12:34.250 --> 01:12:36.120
about how to use what
limited resources

01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:38.160
we have today to
preserve species

01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.580
in the face of predicted
climate change.

01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:42.610
And often when we
publish these papers,

01:12:42.610 --> 01:12:44.210
because they're
about big mammals

01:12:44.210 --> 01:12:48.130
that people think are fun, we
get some popular press coverage

01:12:48.130 --> 01:12:48.880
for these things.

01:12:48.880 --> 01:12:49.546
And people call.

01:12:49.546 --> 01:12:51.500
And I'm always really
excited to talk

01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:54.830
to people about the kind of
cool and interesting science

01:12:54.830 --> 01:12:56.140
that we're doing.

01:12:56.140 --> 01:12:59.896
But they really only ever want
me to answer one question.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:09.560
And so to answer this question
I wrote this book, which

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:14.029
basically says no, not yet.

01:13:14.029 --> 01:13:15.570
And I'm not going
to go through a lot

01:13:15.570 --> 01:13:19.220
of the details in this book
anyway in this talk right now.

01:13:19.220 --> 01:13:22.271
But in the book I do go through
the technical challenges

01:13:22.271 --> 01:13:24.270
associated with bringing
a mammoth back to life,

01:13:24.270 --> 01:13:27.000
as well as talk about some
of the ethical and ecological

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:28.852
questions that are
going to come about.

01:13:28.852 --> 01:13:30.310
Of course, it would
be remiss of me

01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:32.449
since I'm standing
here not to highlight

01:13:32.449 --> 01:13:34.740
some of the really cool stuff
that is being done there,

01:13:34.740 --> 01:13:37.230
in particular by this
motley crew of-- are

01:13:37.230 --> 01:13:38.600
you wearing the same thing?

01:13:48.660 --> 01:13:50.220
These guys have
been doing-- and I'm

01:13:50.220 --> 01:13:52.060
sure we're going to get a chance
to talk about it when we have

01:13:52.060 --> 01:13:53.320
the discussion section here.

01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:56.370
But they have been doing
some fantastic work, at least

01:13:56.370 --> 01:13:59.020
to set us off on the
right foot to figure out

01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:02.110
what we would need to do
if we were going to bring

01:14:02.110 --> 01:14:03.824
a mammoth back to life.

01:14:03.824 --> 01:14:05.490
I think one of the
most important things

01:14:05.490 --> 01:14:08.360
to remember when we think about
bringing a mammoth back to life

01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:11.310
is that the Asian elephant
and the woolly mammoth, Asian

01:14:11.310 --> 01:14:13.564
elephants are known to
be the closest living

01:14:13.564 --> 01:14:15.980
relative of woolly mammoths,
are separated from each other

01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:19.530
by somewhere around 5 to 7
million years of evolution.

01:14:19.530 --> 01:14:21.970
And this is not very much.

01:14:21.970 --> 01:14:23.940
This is not very much change.

01:14:23.940 --> 01:14:26.170
So when you look at
an Asian elephant,

01:14:26.170 --> 01:14:29.390
you're actually looking at
something that is about 99%

01:14:29.390 --> 01:14:31.660
mammoth already anyway.

01:14:31.660 --> 01:14:33.630
So if you're going to
take an Asian elephant

01:14:33.630 --> 01:14:36.130
and turn it into a
mammoth, all you have to do

01:14:36.130 --> 01:14:40.320
is identify that last
1% and change that.

01:14:40.320 --> 01:14:43.010
1% of 4 billion or so
base pairs is still

01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:44.470
like a million and
a half changes.

01:14:44.470 --> 01:14:46.470
But he's a pretty smart guy.

01:14:46.470 --> 01:14:48.465
I'm sure we can figure
out how to do this.

01:14:48.465 --> 01:14:49.840
We're also having--
we're getting

01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.865
a much better understanding
of the types of differences,

01:14:53.865 --> 01:14:56.910
the types of genetic changes
we might need to make.

01:14:56.910 --> 01:15:00.400
One of the first discoveries
that differentiated mammoths

01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:04.090
and Asian elephants came
from Kevin Campbell's group

01:15:04.090 --> 01:15:05.130
in Manitoba.

01:15:05.130 --> 01:15:09.270
They were looking at
hemoglobin, a protein that is

01:15:09.270 --> 01:15:11.310
a part of the red blood cells.

01:15:11.310 --> 01:15:13.930
And they discovered by
sequencing hemoglobin

01:15:13.930 --> 01:15:17.630
from elephants and mammoths
that part of this gene--

01:15:17.630 --> 01:15:18.920
it's made up of several genes.

01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:20.640
But part of it
was different only

01:15:20.640 --> 01:15:23.380
by three different changes.

01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:26.211
Three nucleotide changes led
to three different amino acid

01:15:26.211 --> 01:15:26.710
changes.

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:30.710
So the protein sequences in
hemoglobin were really similar.

01:15:30.710 --> 01:15:33.080
They wanted to
know though, what's

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.300
up with these three changes.

01:15:34.300 --> 01:15:36.050
Why are these three
changes actually important?

01:15:36.050 --> 01:15:37.510
And so they
expressed these genes

01:15:37.510 --> 01:15:40.720
and measured their ability to
carry oxygen around the body,

01:15:40.720 --> 01:15:43.570
this is what hemoglobin
do, in different types

01:15:43.570 --> 01:15:44.240
of environments.

01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.650
And they found that the woolly
mammoth version of hemoglobin

01:15:47.650 --> 01:15:50.400
was much more efficient
than the Asian elephant

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:54.720
version at carrying oxygen
around the body when it's cold.

01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:55.650
Pretty good.

01:15:55.650 --> 01:15:58.900
So this is obviously one of the
adaptations that occurred along

01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:01.140
the lineage to woolly
mammoth since the divergence

01:16:01.140 --> 01:16:03.850
between woolly mammoth
and the Asian elephant.

01:16:03.850 --> 01:16:06.680
So George and his team are
looking through these genomes

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:07.180
now.

01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:08.420
There are a whole
bunch of genomes

01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:10.600
that have been published
recently for woolly mammoths,

01:16:10.600 --> 01:16:12.016
as there are a lot
of genomes that

01:16:12.016 --> 01:16:14.030
are becoming available
for Asian elephants,

01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:16.414
and making lists of the
genes that are different,

01:16:16.414 --> 01:16:18.830
and trying to figure out whether
they're important or not.

01:16:18.830 --> 01:16:21.070
And then using CRISPR
technology, which we'll

01:16:21.070 --> 01:16:23.650
hear about later, to try
to swap these genes out,

01:16:23.650 --> 01:16:26.540
cut and paste your way
from an Asian elephant

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:28.390
into a woolly mammoth.

01:16:28.390 --> 01:16:32.100
So why might we want to
do this, just a little end

01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:35.200
on why we might want to go
through all of these problems

01:16:35.200 --> 01:16:38.100
considering there are
major technical, ethical,

01:16:38.100 --> 01:16:41.310
and ecological hurdles that
we will encounter along

01:16:41.310 --> 01:16:43.200
the way to doing this?

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:44.950
In the purpose-- for
the case of mammoths,

01:16:44.950 --> 01:16:47.470
there are really two
reasons that are discussed.

01:16:47.470 --> 01:16:50.110
And the first is ecological.

01:16:50.110 --> 01:16:52.942
There is a place in
Northeastern Siberia that's

01:16:52.942 --> 01:16:54.900
led by a guy in the
Russian Academy of Sciences

01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:56.270
called Sergey Zimov.

01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:59.120
And he calls this
Pleistocene Park.

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:01.270
Pleistocene was much more
recent than the Jurassic,

01:17:01.270 --> 01:17:04.730
so well within the realm
of possibility here.

01:17:04.730 --> 01:17:07.830
Pleistocene Park is a
great and exciting place.

01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:10.540
And Sergey already has
introduced into Pleistocene

01:17:10.540 --> 01:17:12.950
Park a couple of
different big animals

01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:15.660
that are reminiscent of
the Pleistocene, the Ice

01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:18.480
Ages, where we had things
like mammoths and mastodons.

01:17:18.480 --> 01:17:21.880
He has bison from North America,
about five different species

01:17:21.880 --> 01:17:23.277
of deer.

01:17:23.277 --> 01:17:25.610
There are some horses that
he's introduced to this area.

01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:30.990
And he's shown that over the
course of just a few summers

01:17:30.990 --> 01:17:34.630
that just having these large
mammals on this landscape,

01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:36.700
just their presence
alone, has been

01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:42.540
enough to reestablish this rich
grassland that used to be part

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:45.050
of this landscape in Siberia.

01:17:45.050 --> 01:17:47.970
Just having these animals
there churning over the soil,

01:17:47.970 --> 01:17:50.400
distributing nutrients,
distributing seeds

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:52.270
makes the grass come back.

01:17:52.270 --> 01:17:55.170
In essence, they provide
their own habitat.

01:17:55.170 --> 01:17:57.550
And he's also seen
that other species that

01:17:57.550 --> 01:18:00.300
are in danger of extinction,
because their habitat is

01:18:00.300 --> 01:18:02.160
declining, like
the saiga antelope,

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:03.990
have started visiting the park.

01:18:03.990 --> 01:18:05.240
This is a picture of his park.

01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.580
Over here on this side,
he has the animals.

01:18:07.580 --> 01:18:10.000
And he has them
fenced out over here.

01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:12.590
You see that this is actually--
you can't see it very well,

01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:13.510
the colors here.

01:18:13.510 --> 01:18:17.110
But there is some green
little patches of green

01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.990
all around here.

01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:19.690
And they're actually
very different.

01:18:19.690 --> 01:18:22.110
It's much more speciose,
more biodiversity,

01:18:22.110 --> 01:18:23.620
than you get on
this particular side

01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.340
where you don't have animals.

01:18:25.340 --> 01:18:27.310
This is also early spring.

01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:30.270
And this means that there
has been enough grass

01:18:30.270 --> 01:18:33.170
that some of it is still
surviving this harsh Siberian

01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:33.900
winter.

01:18:33.900 --> 01:18:36.460
So these guys really
are ecosystem engineers

01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:40.070
and bringing these animals
back, this large herbivore.

01:18:40.070 --> 01:18:42.230
I mean, elephants play
important fundamental roles

01:18:42.230 --> 01:18:43.480
in their ecosystem in Africa.

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.260
There's no reason
to assume mammoths

01:18:45.260 --> 01:18:47.010
didn't do the same in Siberia.

01:18:47.010 --> 01:18:49.460
So he argues,
Georgia argues, and I

01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:52.620
would argue that bringing
back these large herbivores

01:18:52.620 --> 01:18:55.130
will help to
reestablish interactions

01:18:55.130 --> 01:18:57.320
in this ecosystem
that have been missing

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.250
since their disappearance.

01:18:59.250 --> 01:19:01.200
And the same argument
could be made

01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.650
for many other extinct species.

01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:04.610
Not to bring them back
just for the purpose

01:19:04.610 --> 01:19:07.860
of looking at an extinct
species and seeing it in a zoo,

01:19:07.860 --> 01:19:10.680
but to reestablish
interactions in ecosystems

01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:14.490
that have been missing since the
time of extinction that perhaps

01:19:14.490 --> 01:19:17.540
can be used to
reinvigorate that ecosystem

01:19:17.540 --> 01:19:22.320
and save living species, which
is actually the second reason.

01:19:22.320 --> 01:19:24.000
This research is
not only teaching us

01:19:24.000 --> 01:19:25.877
about what Asian
elephants might have done

01:19:25.877 --> 01:19:26.960
or might have looked like.

01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:29.470
But it's teaching
us about elephants.

01:19:29.470 --> 01:19:33.790
And Asian elephants are in
danger of going extinct.

01:19:33.790 --> 01:19:35.640
What if we could
use this technology

01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:38.980
to take some of these genes that
have been shaped by evolution

01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:43.400
in past to reinvigorate
the diversity, the genomes,

01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:46.120
the survivability of
species that are in danger

01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:47.400
of going extinct today.

01:19:47.400 --> 01:19:50.660
If we could take an elephant
and give it the capacity

01:19:50.660 --> 01:19:54.150
to live in colder climates,
we could expand the range

01:19:54.150 --> 01:19:55.950
that an elephant could live in.

01:19:55.950 --> 01:19:59.540
Saving elephants, rather than
bringing mammoths back to life.

01:19:59.540 --> 01:20:01.120
So I'm going to leave it there.

01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.550
But we can talk
about the ethics,

01:20:02.550 --> 01:20:06.610
and ecological challenges, and
technical challenges later.

01:20:06.610 --> 01:20:08.950
But for now, thank
you very much.

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:26.270
-Wow, what an amazing
time to be a scientist.

01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:29.710
If you had told me 10 years
ago that ancient DNA labs would

01:20:29.710 --> 01:20:32.100
routinely be producing the
data they're producing today,

01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:34.250
I would have laughed
you out of the room.

01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:37.850
So it's really incredible to see
how the field has progressed.

01:20:37.850 --> 01:20:41.530
But let's step back.

01:20:41.530 --> 01:20:43.380
Let's think about
modern humans, which is

01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.830
what I'm going to talk about.

01:20:44.830 --> 01:20:48.340
And let's think about this
whole issue of human migration

01:20:48.340 --> 01:20:51.020
patterns, and in
particular, why humans

01:20:51.020 --> 01:20:53.840
are dispersed so widely
around the earth,

01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:56.280
and why we're so diverse.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:21:00.360
Put yourself back in time,
European age of exploration.

01:21:00.360 --> 01:21:02.090
You're cruising
around the Pacific

01:21:02.090 --> 01:21:04.580
with Captain Cook at the
end of the 18th century.

01:21:04.580 --> 01:21:08.020
And every time you crash ashore
on one of these remote islands,

01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:09.854
you find people there.

01:21:09.854 --> 01:21:12.020
And they're somewhat like
people you've seen before,

01:21:12.020 --> 01:21:13.000
but different in some ways.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:14.458
The language is
slightly different.

01:21:14.458 --> 01:21:16.520
They may look a
little bit different.

01:21:16.520 --> 01:21:18.660
Why are people so
widely dispersed,

01:21:18.660 --> 01:21:20.940
and how do we account for
the diversity that we see?

01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:23.980
We see a dizzying
amount of phenotypic

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:27.130
diversity, facial
appearance and so on.

01:21:27.130 --> 01:21:29.240
That's really the
overarching problem

01:21:29.240 --> 01:21:32.750
in the field of human
population genetics.

01:21:32.750 --> 01:21:36.410
And like any big overarching
problem or theme,

01:21:36.410 --> 01:21:39.090
you can break it down into
sub themes or questions

01:21:39.090 --> 01:21:42.470
that we can start to chip away
at using the tools of science,

01:21:42.470 --> 01:21:44.610
gathering data, formulating
hypotheses, coming

01:21:44.610 --> 01:21:46.200
down on one side or the other.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:48.560
First question we can
ask is one of origins.

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.980
Are we in fact all
related to each other?

01:21:50.980 --> 01:21:53.640
And if so, how closely?

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:55.230
And the second is
one of journey.

01:21:55.230 --> 01:21:58.150
If we do spring from a
common source as a species,

01:21:58.150 --> 01:22:00.260
how do we come to occupy
every corner of the globe

01:22:00.260 --> 01:22:03.020
in the process of generating
these patterns of diversity

01:22:03.020 --> 01:22:05.500
that we see today?

01:22:05.500 --> 01:22:08.040
Well, the question of
origins, as with so many

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:10.630
other big questions
in biology, seems

01:22:10.630 --> 01:22:13.490
have been answered over a
century ago by Charles Darwin.

01:22:13.490 --> 01:22:16.420
He wrote in his second most
famous book, The Descent

01:22:16.420 --> 01:22:18.322
of Man, "In each great
region of the world

01:22:18.322 --> 01:22:20.530
the living mammals are
closely related to the extinct

01:22:20.530 --> 01:22:21.880
species of the same region.

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:24.200
It's therefore probable
that Africa was formerly

01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:26.300
inhabited by extinct
apes closely allied

01:22:26.300 --> 01:22:27.800
to the gorilla and chimpanzee.

01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:30.870
And as these two species are
now man's nearest allies,

01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:33.120
it's somewhat more probable
that our early progenitors

01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:36.350
lived on the African
continent than elsewhere."

01:22:36.350 --> 01:22:39.590
OK, so Darwin solved
the origins problem.

01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:41.320
Except he didn't really.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:44.426
He of course, is talking about
our shared ancestry with apes.

01:22:44.426 --> 01:22:45.800
And he was absolutely
right, even

01:22:45.800 --> 01:22:49.334
though he didn't have any data
to support that at the time.

01:22:49.334 --> 01:22:50.750
We now know from
the fossil record

01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:52.840
that apes do appear
first in Africa

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.604
around 23 million years
ago, the great apes.

01:22:55.604 --> 01:22:57.020
At a time when
Africa was actually

01:22:57.020 --> 01:22:58.936
disconnected from the
rest of the world's land

01:22:58.936 --> 01:23:00.670
masses due to plate tectonics.

01:23:00.670 --> 01:23:02.990
It bumps into the
Arabian Peninsula

01:23:02.990 --> 01:23:05.930
between 16 and 18
million years ago.

01:23:05.930 --> 01:23:08.800
And at that point, we have the
first so-called African exodus.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:12.130
The apes that left at that time
and ended up in Southeast Asia

01:23:12.130 --> 01:23:15.089
ultimately evolved into the
gibbons and the orangutans.

01:23:15.089 --> 01:23:16.630
And the ones that
stayed on in Africa

01:23:16.630 --> 01:23:20.172
ultimately became gorillas,
and chimps, and yes, us.

01:23:20.172 --> 01:23:21.630
So yeah, Darwin's
absolutely right.

01:23:21.630 --> 01:23:25.470
If you go far enough back
in time 23 million years,

01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:27.740
you find that humans are an
African species in common

01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:29.210
with all other great apes.

01:23:29.210 --> 01:23:32.180
But that's not really
the question I'm asking.

01:23:32.180 --> 01:23:35.070
Rather I want to know about
us as a species, Homo sapiens,

01:23:35.070 --> 01:23:38.130
individuals that we would
recognize as being like us

01:23:38.130 --> 01:23:42.440
if they were sitting out
here in the seventh row.

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.380
That question has been
approached historically

01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:46.160
through the study of
paleoanthropology,

01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:49.020
going out and digging up
bones and saying typically

01:23:49.020 --> 01:23:51.940
on the basis of morphology,
often skull shape,

01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:53.780
this looks a little
bit more like my cousin

01:23:53.780 --> 01:23:56.050
Frank than that does.

01:23:56.050 --> 01:23:57.150
This is the missing link.

01:23:57.150 --> 01:23:59.240
This is where we all came from.

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:00.890
What I would like
to suggest though

01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:04.290
as a geneticist who values
large amounts of data

01:24:04.290 --> 01:24:06.310
is that while the field
of paleoanthropology

01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:08.810
gives us lots of
fascinating possibilities

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:11.530
about human origins
and dispersal patterns,

01:24:11.530 --> 01:24:13.260
it doesn't give us
the probabilities

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:15.380
about direct lines of
descent that we really

01:24:15.380 --> 01:24:18.700
want unless we're lucky enough
to get ancient DNA out of them.

01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:21.390
Possibilities about our
past and our origins,

01:24:21.390 --> 01:24:23.710
but not the probabilities
about direct connections

01:24:23.710 --> 01:24:25.830
to those individuals.

01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:26.830
This is a great example.

01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:29.038
What you're looking at here
are three extinct species

01:24:29.038 --> 01:24:30.090
of hominids.

01:24:30.090 --> 01:24:33.050
From left to right, Homo
habilis, Homo erectus,

01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:36.930
and paranthropus boisei,
robust australopithecine,

01:24:36.930 --> 01:24:40.414
all uncovered from the same
location in northern Kenya

01:24:40.414 --> 01:24:42.080
and all dating to
roughly the same time,

01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:43.880
about 2 million years ago.

01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:46.520
So which one of these guys am
I actually directly related to,

01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:48.270
descended from?

01:24:48.270 --> 01:24:49.230
I don't know.

01:24:49.230 --> 01:24:51.930
Possibilities about our past
and our origins, but now

01:24:51.930 --> 01:24:55.030
the probabilities
we really want.

01:24:55.030 --> 01:24:57.080
Well we as
geneticists of course,

01:24:57.080 --> 01:24:58.780
take a slightly
different approach.

01:24:58.780 --> 01:25:00.340
We turn the problem on its head.

01:25:00.340 --> 01:25:02.300
Instead of digging
things up out of the past

01:25:02.300 --> 01:25:04.883
and guessing at how they may or
may not connect to the present

01:25:04.883 --> 01:25:06.905
and to us, we start
in the present.

01:25:06.905 --> 01:25:08.290
And we work our
way back in time.

01:25:08.290 --> 01:25:10.250
Because we know it's
an absolute certainty

01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:13.030
that everybody alive
today had parents.

01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:14.840
And those parents had
parents and so on.

01:25:14.840 --> 01:25:16.800
So it should be possible
to build a family

01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:18.709
tree for everyone alive.

01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:20.500
And I'm sure that a
few people in this room

01:25:20.500 --> 01:25:22.830
have done that, built
a genealogical tree.

01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:24.340
It's the second
most popular hobby

01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:26.560
in the country after gardening.

01:25:26.560 --> 01:25:29.950
Told it's poised to overtake
gardening very soon.

01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:32.520
But no matter how far back
you can trace your family line

01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:34.960
and ultimately it all ends at
Charlemagne for some reason

01:25:34.960 --> 01:25:37.780
if you're from Europe.

01:25:37.780 --> 01:25:39.760
The point is that you
eventually run out

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.730
of the written record
about your ancestors.

01:25:41.730 --> 01:25:44.020
And we simply enter this
dark and mysterious realm

01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:46.649
we call history, and
ultimately prehistory.

01:25:46.649 --> 01:25:48.440
But it turns out, of
course, that we're all

01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:51.640
carrying a written
historical document

01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:54.150
inside of ourselves,
inside of nearly every cell

01:25:54.150 --> 01:25:56.110
in our body in our DNA.

01:25:56.110 --> 01:25:59.280
And that allows us to see
back beyond that brick wall,

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:02.734
as the genealogists call the
place where the records stop.

01:26:02.734 --> 01:26:04.650
Back to the very earliest
days of our species.

01:26:04.650 --> 01:26:06.608
And we've already had a
bit of a primer on DNA.

01:26:06.608 --> 01:26:09.190
But just to reiterate,
long linear molecule,

01:26:09.190 --> 01:26:11.930
the famous double helix
described by Watson and Crick

01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:15.790
in 1953 composed of four
subunits-- A, C, G, and T.

01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:18.370
And it's the sequence of
these A's, C's, G's, and T's

01:26:18.370 --> 01:26:20.460
that basically
provides a blueprint

01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:21.960
to make another
version of yourself.

01:26:21.960 --> 01:26:23.335
And in every
generation, you have

01:26:23.335 --> 01:26:27.640
to copy all of this information
to pass it on to your kids.

01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.080
And it's a lot of information.

01:26:29.080 --> 01:26:31.970
There are billions of
A's C's G's and T's

01:26:31.970 --> 01:26:33.640
in the human genome.

01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:37.040
And so it's like copying
a very long text.

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.120
Imagine a long book.

01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.600
Say, War and Peace.

01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:42.230
But it's like copying
1,000 volumes of that.

01:26:42.230 --> 01:26:45.160
And you've got to do it in
eight hours, which is roughly

01:26:45.160 --> 01:26:48.462
what it takes with yourselves
to replicate your genome.

01:26:48.462 --> 01:26:50.170
And this is really
important information.

01:26:50.170 --> 01:26:51.336
So what are you going to do?

01:26:51.336 --> 01:26:53.490
Well, you're going to
get your cup of coffee,

01:26:53.490 --> 01:26:55.220
or whatever it is that
keeps you focused.

01:26:55.220 --> 01:26:56.870
And you're going to
check and double-check

01:26:56.870 --> 01:26:59.244
very carefully as you're
copying all of this information,

01:26:59.244 --> 01:27:00.790
because it's so important.

01:27:00.790 --> 01:27:04.300
But inevitably, what is going
to happen as you're copying?

01:27:04.300 --> 01:27:06.530
You're going to make a
typo, a spelling mistake.

01:27:06.530 --> 01:27:08.390
Those happen at the
DNA level as well

01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:12.690
during this copying process, at
a rate of around 100 mutations,

01:27:12.690 --> 01:27:15.340
as we call them, per
genome per generation,

01:27:15.340 --> 01:27:18.130
as the DNA is being
copied to be passed on.

01:27:18.130 --> 01:27:20.140
And as these mutations
get passed down

01:27:20.140 --> 01:27:23.330
to children, grandchildren,
great-grandchildren,

01:27:23.330 --> 01:27:26.010
they become what we
call markers of descent.

01:27:26.010 --> 01:27:28.050
So if you share one
of these changes, one

01:27:28.050 --> 01:27:30.970
of these markers in your
DNA, with another person,

01:27:30.970 --> 01:27:33.050
that means you share an
ancestor-- the person

01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:35.430
in the past who first had
that mutation in their DNA

01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:38.300
and passed it on
to the two of you.

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:40.200
This is actual
DNA sequence data.

01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:42.050
Old-fashioned Sanger
sequencing, which

01:27:42.050 --> 01:27:45.200
is still the gold standard
for clinical diagnostics.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:47.300
Five individuals-- one,
two, three, four, five--

01:27:47.300 --> 01:27:49.780
have had the same region
of their genome sequenced.

01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:50.714
They've been lined up.

01:27:50.714 --> 01:27:52.630
The first thing you'll
notice as you read down

01:27:52.630 --> 01:27:56.230
through these sequences is that
they're basically identical.

01:27:56.230 --> 01:28:00.860
In fact, humans are 99.9%
identical at the DNA level.

01:28:00.860 --> 01:28:02.300
We only differ,
on average, at one

01:28:02.300 --> 01:28:05.840
in every thousand nucleotides
positions from someone we're

01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:07.760
not even closely related to.

01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:11.039
So it's actually quite difficult
to find these genetic markers.

01:28:11.039 --> 01:28:12.830
But if you look carefully
enough, down here

01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:16.776
in this region, GGGG GAG.

01:28:16.776 --> 01:28:20.340
A single letter change from
a G to an A, that's a marker.

01:28:20.340 --> 01:28:22.390
If you share that
with another person,

01:28:22.390 --> 01:28:23.870
you share an
ancestor-- the person

01:28:23.870 --> 01:28:28.010
who first had that change and
passed it on to the two of you.

01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:31.090
And by looking at the pattern
of these markers in people

01:28:31.090 --> 01:28:32.750
from all over the
world, focusing

01:28:32.750 --> 01:28:35.380
in particular on what you heard
about earlier-- mitochondrial

01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:37.460
DNA, the Y
chromosome-- we've been

01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:40.890
able to construct family trees
for everybody alive today.

01:28:40.890 --> 01:28:44.190
Everybody in this room-- in
fact, everybody walking around

01:28:44.190 --> 01:28:46.720
on planet Earth all
7.2 billion of us

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:50.140
falls somewhere onto one of
the branches of these trees.

01:28:50.140 --> 01:28:53.430
Now, these are very,
very simplified versions

01:28:53.430 --> 01:28:54.930
of the assays we
actually when we're

01:28:54.930 --> 01:28:57.230
designed in the essays
in the laboratory.

01:28:57.230 --> 01:28:59.570
But they still look
complicated, sitting out there

01:28:59.570 --> 01:29:02.510
in the audience in the morning.

01:29:02.510 --> 01:29:05.011
So let's simplify them, combine
them, turn them on the sides

01:29:05.011 --> 01:29:06.801
so the roots at the
bottom and the branches

01:29:06.801 --> 01:29:08.170
are at the top like a real tree.

01:29:08.170 --> 01:29:10.440
What's the take-home
message here?

01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:13.810
Well, it's that the longest
branches in the human family

01:29:13.810 --> 01:29:17.650
tree, the branches with the
most mutational changes in them,

01:29:17.650 --> 01:29:22.000
if you will, are found only
in African populations.

01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:23.550
And what that means
is that because

01:29:23.550 --> 01:29:26.610
of this molecular clock-like
process, the mutations ticking

01:29:26.610 --> 01:29:28.700
off at 100 per genome
per generation,

01:29:28.700 --> 01:29:31.450
Africans have been accumulating
genetic variation for longer

01:29:31.450 --> 01:29:33.020
than any other group.

01:29:33.020 --> 01:29:36.100
And, therefore, our species
originated in Africa.

01:29:36.100 --> 01:29:38.280
And at some point in
the past, a small group

01:29:38.280 --> 01:29:40.130
carrying a subset
of African diversity

01:29:40.130 --> 01:29:42.594
set out to leave
Africa and colonized

01:29:42.594 --> 01:29:43.510
the rest of the world.

01:29:43.510 --> 01:29:43.740
OK.

01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:45.410
So we're back where
Darwin started.

01:29:45.410 --> 01:29:48.310
Except we're not.

01:29:48.310 --> 01:29:50.450
We're not talking about
23 million years ago.

01:29:50.450 --> 01:29:51.850
We're talking
about an event that

01:29:51.850 --> 01:29:55.040
happened within the last 200,000
years, which is in agreement

01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.260
with the fossil record.

01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:59.380
Modern humans first appear
at Omo Kibish in Ethiopia,

01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:01.290
195,000 years ago.

01:30:01.290 --> 01:30:05.160
That's roughly the coalescence
point for mitochondrial DNA.

01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:08.260
And it's only in the
last 60,000 years--

01:30:08.260 --> 01:30:10.790
2,000 human
generations-- that we've

01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:13.830
set out to colonize
the rest of the planet.

01:30:13.830 --> 01:30:16.280
An early coastal migration
leading very rapidly

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:17.650
to Australia.

01:30:17.650 --> 01:30:20.140
Later inland migrations
moving to Europe,

01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:22.800
crossing the Bering land
bridge into the Americas--

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:26.380
the great paleolithic
wanderings of our species.

01:30:26.380 --> 01:30:30.530
And it's really detailing
these migration patterns.

01:30:30.530 --> 01:30:32.910
That's been the goal of
the Genographic project

01:30:32.910 --> 01:30:35.950
over the course of
the last decade.

01:30:35.950 --> 01:30:38.406
Now, what is
Genographic all about?

01:30:38.406 --> 01:30:39.530
You referred to it earlier.

01:30:39.530 --> 01:30:41.710
Thank you very
much for the intro.

01:30:41.710 --> 01:30:44.420
At its core, it's
a research effort.

01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:47.140
It's an effort to make
sense of the human journey,

01:30:47.140 --> 01:30:48.430
the human story.

01:30:48.430 --> 01:30:50.060
And this is field
research that's

01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:52.360
being carried out by a
consortium of scientists

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.550
around the world,
working primarily

01:30:54.550 --> 01:30:58.020
with indigenous people, world's
traditional and indigenous

01:30:58.020 --> 01:30:58.520
groups.

01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:01.880
Now, why are indigenous people
so important to this effort?

01:31:01.880 --> 01:31:03.830
Well, think about
your own ancestry.

01:31:03.830 --> 01:31:05.430
I'll think about mine out loud.

01:31:05.430 --> 01:31:08.080
I have ancestors from all over
northern and western Europe.

01:31:08.080 --> 01:31:11.250
I lived until very
recently in Washington, DC.

01:31:11.250 --> 01:31:13.640
Just recently moved
to Austin, Texas.

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:16.310
What does my DNA tell you
about the ancient patterns

01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:17.550
in any of those places?

01:31:17.550 --> 01:31:19.840
It's hard to say,
because I'm a mutt.

01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:23.500
And I've moved around a lot
recently, or my ancestors have.

01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:25.130
Ideally, we want
people who have lived

01:31:25.130 --> 01:31:28.292
in the same place for a long
period of time, thousands,

01:31:28.292 --> 01:31:30.250
tens of thousands, even,
in the case of Africa,

01:31:30.250 --> 01:31:31.900
hundreds of thousands of years.

01:31:31.900 --> 01:31:34.310
The world's indigenous
and traditional people.

01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:37.820
And they give us that glimpse
of the ancient genetic patterns

01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:40.170
linked to a particular
geographic location that

01:31:40.170 --> 01:31:44.240
allow us to make sense of
these human migrations.

01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:45.900
But when we were
designing the project,

01:31:45.900 --> 01:31:48.420
I felt very strongly
that it should not just

01:31:48.420 --> 01:31:51.531
be the story of the world's
100, maybe 200, million

01:31:51.531 --> 01:31:52.280
indigenous people.

01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.970
It's the story of all of us.

01:31:53.970 --> 01:31:55.270
All 7.2 billion.

01:31:55.270 --> 01:31:56.924
So we wanted to open
it up to members

01:31:56.924 --> 01:31:59.090
of the general public who
were interested in testing

01:31:59.090 --> 01:32:01.710
their own DNA, getting
the results back, but also

01:32:01.710 --> 01:32:05.110
joining the project, increasing
the size of the database,

01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:09.370
giving us more power to
detail these migratory routes.

01:32:09.370 --> 01:32:11.670
So the public participation
side, a very important

01:32:11.670 --> 01:32:13.160
component.

01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:15.232
By selling the kits
we help to fund

01:32:15.232 --> 01:32:16.940
the research we're
doing out in the field

01:32:16.940 --> 01:32:18.939
with the indigenous
populations, who, obviously,

01:32:18.939 --> 01:32:20.420
can't afford to buy a kit.

01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:22.980
And also, the third
component, the legacy fund.

01:32:22.980 --> 01:32:26.030
This is a way to give something
tangible back to the world's

01:32:26.030 --> 01:32:29.410
indigenous and traditional
groups, many of whom

01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:32.760
are leading ways of life
that are endangered today.

01:32:32.760 --> 01:32:34.260
They're often forced
to leave behind

01:32:34.260 --> 01:32:36.680
their ancient villages,
their homelands, typically

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.810
moving to a growing megacity.

01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:41.050
They become part
of the melting pot.

01:32:41.050 --> 01:32:44.300
Their kids stop speaking
the original language.

01:32:44.300 --> 01:32:46.499
They lose the culture
within a generation or two.

01:32:46.499 --> 01:32:48.040
We're actually going
through a period

01:32:48.040 --> 01:32:50.900
of cultural mass extinction
at the moment that parallels

01:32:50.900 --> 01:32:53.050
the biodiversity crisis.

01:32:53.050 --> 01:32:56.090
Linguists tell us that of the
6,000-some-odd languages spoken

01:32:56.090 --> 01:32:58.570
on Earth today, by the
end of this century,

01:32:58.570 --> 01:33:03.290
between half and 90% will be
extinct, no longer spoken.

01:33:03.290 --> 01:33:05.819
We're losing a language
every two weeks.

01:33:05.819 --> 01:33:07.360
So through the legacy
grants, we want

01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:09.390
to do something to raise
awareness about this,

01:33:09.390 --> 01:33:14.112
and if we can, to slow
it, or even to halt it.

01:33:14.112 --> 01:33:15.070
Well, how are we doing?

01:33:15.070 --> 01:33:17.190
How have we done in the project?

01:33:17.190 --> 01:33:20.830
Well, an easy way is
to look at numbers.

01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:23.920
On the indigenous side, we've
sampled roughly 72,000 people

01:33:23.920 --> 01:33:26.070
representing over 1,000
different populations

01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:27.620
from every inhabited continent.

01:33:27.620 --> 01:33:30.110
Not Antarctica, obviously.

01:33:30.110 --> 01:33:32.400
Published more than
50 scientific papers.

01:33:32.400 --> 01:33:34.250
Have several more
in the pipeline.

01:33:34.250 --> 01:33:36.860
So that's gone very well.

01:33:36.860 --> 01:33:39.450
The big surprise,
though, for me,

01:33:39.450 --> 01:33:42.810
has been the excitement on
the part of the general public

01:33:42.810 --> 01:33:45.110
in getting their own DNA tested.

01:33:45.110 --> 01:33:47.170
When we were
designing the project,

01:33:47.170 --> 01:33:51.170
I had a bet with the then-CEO
of National Geographic, John

01:33:51.170 --> 01:33:53.990
Fahey, about how many of these
kits we were going to sell.

01:33:53.990 --> 01:33:55.660
He said, Spencer,
if you sell 1,000

01:33:55.660 --> 01:33:58.640
of these things in the next
few years, you'll be lucky.

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:01.342
Nobody's going to pay $100
to get their DNA tested.

01:34:01.342 --> 01:34:03.299
I said, I don't know, John.

01:34:03.299 --> 01:34:03.840
I don't know.

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:06.130
I think there's
something to this.

01:34:06.130 --> 01:34:10.620
The day we launched the project,
10,000 people ordered kits.

01:34:10.620 --> 01:34:14.060
And we hit 100,000 eight months
later at the end of 2005.

01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:15.990
And we're up to
around 700,000, now.

01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:18.190
More than 140
different countries.

01:34:18.190 --> 01:34:21.060
We've even sold two
to Vatican City.

01:34:21.060 --> 01:34:22.410
Very curious about those two.

01:34:26.394 --> 01:34:29.060
And it's raised a fair amount of
money, obviously, for the field

01:34:29.060 --> 01:34:32.230
research, and also the legacy
fund, which we've given away

01:34:32.230 --> 01:34:34.530
$2.5 million so far.

01:34:34.530 --> 01:34:37.350
Just some examples of
projects that we've funded.

01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:40.010
Project to save the Yaghnobi
language, the last remnant

01:34:40.010 --> 01:34:43.710
of ancient Sogdian, once the
lingua franca of the Silk Road.

01:34:43.710 --> 01:34:46.637
If you had gone to Bukhara
or Samarkand or Kashgar

01:34:46.637 --> 01:34:49.220
1,500 years ago, you would have
been speaking to the merchants

01:34:49.220 --> 01:34:52.440
with this language, now spoken
by around 1,500 people who,

01:34:52.440 --> 01:34:55.370
historically, have lived in
the remote Zeravshan River

01:34:55.370 --> 01:34:57.130
Valley of northern Tajikistan.

01:34:57.130 --> 01:35:00.150
Most have now been resettled
to the capital, Duchanbe,

01:35:00.150 --> 01:35:02.380
and their kids learn to
speak Russian and Tajik.

01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:05.070
And so the language is literally
on the verge of extinction.

01:35:05.070 --> 01:35:08.150
We're helping to fund school
curricula in the Yaghnobi

01:35:08.150 --> 01:35:09.450
language.

01:35:09.450 --> 01:35:12.179
Project to preserve a
traditional dance pattern

01:35:12.179 --> 01:35:14.220
among the aborigines in
the northern territories.

01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:19.870
Their song lines, their stories
of where they came from.

01:35:19.870 --> 01:35:23.390
A project along the Yukon River,
an intertribal collaboration

01:35:23.390 --> 01:35:26.360
with tribes from Northwest
Territories in Alaska

01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:28.490
to raise awareness about
the environmental issues

01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:30.390
that are affecting, in
particular, the salmon

01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:33.117
population there, which is so
important their way of life.

01:35:33.117 --> 01:35:34.700
And this is a great
example for people

01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:38.600
who need a practical reason
for saving this information

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:39.930
and these cultures.

01:35:39.930 --> 01:35:41.450
The Shuar people
trying to preserve

01:35:41.450 --> 01:35:43.820
their ethnobotanical knowledge.

01:35:43.820 --> 01:35:46.760
Now, how many people have
been prescribed a medication

01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:48.970
by their physician recently?

01:35:48.970 --> 01:35:50.450
Probably most of us.

01:35:50.450 --> 01:35:53.520
And about 30% to 40%
of those ultimately

01:35:53.520 --> 01:35:55.880
trace back to plant sources.

01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:57.720
We often know about
these plant sources

01:35:57.720 --> 01:36:00.410
because of accumulated
traditional knowledge.

01:36:00.410 --> 01:36:04.560
Tens of thousands of years
by thousands of populations

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:06.290
experimenting with
their environment,

01:36:06.290 --> 01:36:09.560
learning which plants do
certain things and which don't.

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.350
When we lose that
body of knowledge,

01:36:12.350 --> 01:36:16.420
how many potential treatments
for cancer or Ebola or HIV

01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:18.050
might we be missing out on?

01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:18.699
We don't know.

01:36:18.699 --> 01:36:20.115
But I think it's
worth preserving.

01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:27.134
So I'm often asked, what's
your biggest surprise?

01:36:27.134 --> 01:36:29.800
What's the most surprising thing
that's come out of the project?

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:31.830
And there are
scientific discoveries,

01:36:31.830 --> 01:36:35.700
ranging from populations
fissioning off in Africa long

01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:38.600
before we started to leave
and headed toward becoming

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:42.490
separate species, or the
genetic impact of Ghengis Khan,

01:36:42.490 --> 01:36:43.910
whatever it might be.

01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:46.896
But the big surprise for
me has been the excitement

01:36:46.896 --> 01:36:48.270
on the part of
the general public

01:36:48.270 --> 01:36:50.420
in getting involved
in this project.

01:36:50.420 --> 01:36:53.960
In particular, the power of
what we call citizen science--

01:36:53.960 --> 01:36:56.340
non-specialists getting
actively involved

01:36:56.340 --> 01:36:57.802
in the research project.

01:36:57.802 --> 01:36:59.010
And I've got a great example.

01:36:59.010 --> 01:37:02.470
This came to light by
accident a few years ago.

01:37:02.470 --> 01:37:04.420
A woman writes into
the project and says,

01:37:04.420 --> 01:37:05.580
love what you're doing.

01:37:05.580 --> 01:37:08.342
Lots of members of my extended
family have taken part.

01:37:08.342 --> 01:37:09.800
We've told lots of
people about it.

01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.180
It's very, very exciting.

01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:12.450
So cool.

01:37:12.450 --> 01:37:17.520
However, it seems like
you got my results wrong.

01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:19.250
And I'd like you to retest me.

01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:21.320
Because what you've
told me is I'm

01:37:21.320 --> 01:37:24.740
carrying a mitochondrial type
that's common in Central Asia

01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:26.410
and Siberia.

01:37:26.410 --> 01:37:29.040
And I know for a fact from
the genealogical records

01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.900
that my family came
from a little village

01:37:30.900 --> 01:37:33.000
just outside of
Budapest, which you're

01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:34.210
looking at here in Hungary.

01:37:34.210 --> 01:37:35.760
So clearly, I've
got to be European.

01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.630
I can show you records going
back to the 16th century.

01:37:38.630 --> 01:37:39.790
Please retest me.

01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:41.130
Thank you very much.

01:37:41.130 --> 01:37:44.140
Now, when I heard about
this, I got really excited,

01:37:44.140 --> 01:37:45.770
not because I enjoy
asking the lab

01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:49.070
to cherry-pick one sample
out of 3/4 of a million.

01:37:49.070 --> 01:37:50.960
They tend to get a little
annoyed about that.

01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:53.010
But rather, because
the Hungarians

01:37:53.010 --> 01:37:54.180
have a fascinating history.

01:37:54.180 --> 01:37:57.862
Linguistically, they're very
different from other groups

01:37:57.862 --> 01:37:58.570
living in Europe.

01:37:58.570 --> 01:38:02.820
Most of Europe's languages fall
into the Indo-European language

01:38:02.820 --> 01:38:04.690
family that we
heard about before.

01:38:04.690 --> 01:38:07.320
A Western Eurasian collection
of languages that includes

01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:08.890
the one I'm speaking now.

01:38:08.890 --> 01:38:12.830
Part of the Germanic branch
of Indo-European languages.

01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:15.410
Romance languages--
French, Italian,

01:38:15.410 --> 01:38:18.210
and Spanish-- the
Celtic languages,

01:38:18.210 --> 01:38:20.110
the Slavic languages,
and so on, all parts

01:38:20.110 --> 01:38:24.220
of the single language family
that probably originated

01:38:24.220 --> 01:38:27.260
somewhere in the southern
Russian or Ukrainian steppe

01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:28.780
6,000 to 8,000 years ago.

01:38:28.780 --> 01:38:31.341
And the languages have
diversified over time.

01:38:31.341 --> 01:38:33.340
Except there are a couple
of languages in Europe

01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:36.030
that don't fall into that
category, into that family.

01:38:36.030 --> 01:38:39.750
One is Basque, which is what
we call a linguistic isolate.

01:38:39.750 --> 01:38:41.474
It's unrelated to
anything else on Earth,

01:38:41.474 --> 01:38:42.390
as far as we can tell.

01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:45.380
It could've been
brought here from Mars.

01:38:45.380 --> 01:38:47.629
Might be distantly related
to ancient Sumerian

01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:49.920
and some of the languages
spoken in the north Caucasus,

01:38:49.920 --> 01:38:53.061
like Daghastani, but
it's very, very tenuous.

01:38:53.061 --> 01:38:53.560
OK.

01:38:53.560 --> 01:38:56.410
That's off on its own.

01:38:56.410 --> 01:38:59.470
Hungarian is a member of a
different language family.

01:38:59.470 --> 01:39:01.800
It's related to languages
spoken in Finland,

01:39:01.800 --> 01:39:05.290
in Lapland, the Saami languages
of northern Scandinavia.

01:39:05.290 --> 01:39:08.390
All part of what we call
the Uralic language family.

01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:10.820
And as you can see, most of
the diversity in that family

01:39:10.820 --> 01:39:13.210
lies over in Siberia.

01:39:13.210 --> 01:39:14.930
And this makes
sense, because it's

01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:19.020
believed that the ancestors
of the Laplanders, the Saami

01:39:19.020 --> 01:39:21.580
people, migrated into
northern Scandinavia

01:39:21.580 --> 01:39:24.250
from Siberia within
the last 5,000 years,

01:39:24.250 --> 01:39:25.960
bringing with them
their language that

01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:27.850
belong to this Siberian group.

01:39:27.850 --> 01:39:30.240
We also know from
historical sources

01:39:30.240 --> 01:39:33.660
that people from somewhere
further east-- the Magyar

01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:37.800
people-- around 1,000 AD
migrated into central Europe,

01:39:37.800 --> 01:39:40.610
settled there and created
present-day Hungary, bringing

01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:44.252
with them their culture, their
love of chicken paprikash--

01:39:44.252 --> 01:39:46.460
that actually came later,
because peppers, of course,

01:39:46.460 --> 01:39:48.220
come from the new world.

01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:49.690
But anyway, the
Hungarian language.

01:39:49.690 --> 01:39:53.820
So they had a massive cultural
impact on central Europe.

01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:56.530
And so geneticists,
using this as a guide--

01:39:56.530 --> 01:39:58.250
and we often use
linguistic patterns

01:39:58.250 --> 01:40:01.266
as a guide when we're thinking
about the sampling-- went in

01:40:01.266 --> 01:40:03.140
and sample the number
of people you typically

01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:05.180
study in one of these projects.

01:40:05.180 --> 01:40:06.770
50, 75 people.

01:40:06.770 --> 01:40:09.380
And what they found is that
the Hungarians are identical,

01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:12.380
essentially, genetically to
the surrounding non-Hungarian

01:40:12.380 --> 01:40:13.870
speakers.

01:40:13.870 --> 01:40:15.390
You don't see any
genetic evidence

01:40:15.390 --> 01:40:18.230
for this huge cultural shift.

01:40:18.230 --> 01:40:21.580
So when this woman
wrote in to us, I said,

01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:24.630
well, here's an opportunity to
see if this public database is

01:40:24.630 --> 01:40:25.990
actually useful.

01:40:25.990 --> 01:40:28.870
We don't have to limit ourselves
to the scientific sample sizes.

01:40:28.870 --> 01:40:32.190
How many samples do we have
in the database from people

01:40:32.190 --> 01:40:33.400
with Hungarian ancestry?

01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:36.530
Well, we had 2,300 at that time.

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:39.470
And lo and behold, we
found that 2% to 3%

01:40:39.470 --> 01:40:41.770
of the lineages on both
the male and female side

01:40:41.770 --> 01:40:43.560
were coming out of Asia.

01:40:43.560 --> 01:40:44.740
So that makes sense.

01:40:44.740 --> 01:40:45.700
Power of large numbers.

01:40:45.700 --> 01:40:48.930
We knew that was going to be
something cool about creating

01:40:48.930 --> 01:40:50.610
this large database.

01:40:50.610 --> 01:40:55.260
But the only reason we knew
to look for this pattern

01:40:55.260 --> 01:40:57.980
is because this
woman wrote in to us.

01:40:57.980 --> 01:41:00.730
And that is the power
of citizen science.

01:41:00.730 --> 01:41:03.810
Instead of having a few
scientists sit back and say,

01:41:03.810 --> 01:41:06.210
these are the important
things we should be studying,

01:41:06.210 --> 01:41:09.290
we dispersed that out
into the community.

01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:11.470
And you've got, effectively,
hundreds of thousands

01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:14.756
of scientists, now, who
are looking independently

01:41:14.756 --> 01:41:16.630
at their own data, trying
to make sense of it

01:41:16.630 --> 01:41:18.910
and finding patterns like this.

01:41:18.910 --> 01:41:21.430
And building that kind of
citizen science functionality

01:41:21.430 --> 01:41:25.040
into the project has been a very
important part of the relaunch

01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:26.680
that we did a
couple of years ago

01:41:26.680 --> 01:41:30.520
in the creation of Geno 2.0.

01:41:30.520 --> 01:41:34.580
I'm going to end by talking
a little bit about consumer

01:41:34.580 --> 01:41:35.170
genomics.

01:41:35.170 --> 01:41:38.390
And I despise the term
direct-to-consumer genomics,

01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:41.580
because we don't talk about
direct-to-consumer bookselling.

01:41:41.580 --> 01:41:43.150
Direct-to-consumer
implies that there

01:41:43.150 --> 01:41:45.607
should be a mediator that's
making decisions for you.

01:41:45.607 --> 01:41:47.940
And I feel very strongly that
genomic information should

01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:50.889
be available to
anybody who wants it.

01:41:50.889 --> 01:41:52.430
I want to talk a
little bit about how

01:41:52.430 --> 01:41:53.740
the industry has progressed.

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:56.530
And it's really
reflected in this graph.

01:41:56.530 --> 01:42:01.070
These are number of people who
have bought kits, DNA testing

01:42:01.070 --> 01:42:01.980
kits.

01:42:01.980 --> 01:42:05.070
So the industry traces
back to around 2002, when

01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:08.050
Bennett Greenspan founded
Family Tree DNA down

01:42:08.050 --> 01:42:11.210
in Houston, primarily
because he was

01:42:11.210 --> 01:42:13.440
interested in looking
at his Y chromosome

01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:16.040
to see if he is a
descendant of Aaron,

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.789
carrying the Cohen
modal haplotype.

01:42:18.789 --> 01:42:21.080
And I'm not going to go into
the details on that story.

01:42:21.080 --> 01:42:22.934
But there is very,
very good evidence

01:42:22.934 --> 01:42:24.600
that you can find a
genetic pattern that

01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:29.810
links Ashkenazi Jews living
today to this historical figure

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:32.780
within the last
3,000 to 4,000 years.

01:42:32.780 --> 01:42:34.700
So he founded this
company, primarily driven

01:42:34.700 --> 01:42:35.710
by personal curiosity.

01:42:35.710 --> 01:42:38.470
It was very much a
cottage industry.

01:42:38.470 --> 01:42:41.970
Literally, a few hundred
people would hear about this

01:42:41.970 --> 01:42:44.340
and decide to get themselves
tested every year.

01:42:44.340 --> 01:42:47.710
And then we went live
with Geographic in 2005.

01:42:47.710 --> 01:42:50.760
And the numbers started
to tick up significantly.

01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:55.100
23 and Me and Navigenics
launched in 2007,

01:42:55.100 --> 01:42:56.940
in part off of the
back of our success

01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:59.170
showing that there was
a viable business there.

01:42:59.170 --> 01:43:00.878
But they launched with
products that were

01:43:00.878 --> 01:43:03.390
priced at $1,000 and $2,500.

01:43:03.390 --> 01:43:05.940
So not a lot of
people buying those.

01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:08.800
They dropped the
price in 2008, 2009.

01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:10.830
And you see this uptick here.

01:43:10.830 --> 01:43:13.850
We continue up until 2013.

01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:16.250
End of 2012 beginning of 2013.

01:43:16.250 --> 01:43:20.910
The millionth person
purchases a test kit.

01:43:20.910 --> 01:43:25.720
So it took us 11 years to
go from zero to a million.

01:43:25.720 --> 01:43:30.610
The second millionth person
bought a kit a year later.

01:43:30.610 --> 01:43:33.250
And we're over four
million now, or will

01:43:33.250 --> 01:43:35.500
be by the end of this year.

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:37.200
No signs of it asymptoting.

01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:40.380
And this is a really,
really interesting curve

01:43:40.380 --> 01:43:41.650
from a business point of view.

01:43:41.650 --> 01:43:43.260
So there are lots
of companies that

01:43:43.260 --> 01:43:46.630
have piled into this space.

01:43:46.630 --> 01:43:49.165
My buddy Ken Shaheen
at Ancestry tells me

01:43:49.165 --> 01:43:51.290
that they're probably going
to sell between 500,000

01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:54.600
and 700,000 kits
next year alone.

01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:57.340
So why is this happening now?

01:43:57.340 --> 01:43:58.690
Or in the last couple of years.

01:43:58.690 --> 01:44:00.510
Well, there are a few reasons.

01:44:00.510 --> 01:44:03.670
I think DNA has become part
of the national consciousness.

01:44:03.670 --> 01:44:06.030
Big corporations
talk about whatever

01:44:06.030 --> 01:44:07.990
it is being in their DNA.

01:44:07.990 --> 01:44:10.501
People are less afraid of
Jurassic Park scenarios,

01:44:10.501 --> 01:44:12.250
because they know that
it's very unlikely.

01:44:12.250 --> 01:44:14.650
They're less concerned
about being cloned.

01:44:14.650 --> 01:44:20.447
All of these were major issues
in 2005 when we launched.

01:44:20.447 --> 01:44:22.280
People are also more
comfortable now sharing

01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:23.870
their most private information.

01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:26.350
When we launched in 2005,
there was no Twitter.

01:44:26.350 --> 01:44:27.390
There was no Facebook.

01:44:27.390 --> 01:44:29.370
And people dump stuff
out onto the internet

01:44:29.370 --> 01:44:32.340
for public consumption now
that a generation ago, people

01:44:32.340 --> 01:44:34.000
would have been appalled at.

01:44:34.000 --> 01:44:35.100
And now it's standard.

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:37.360
And I think part of that
is trusting companies

01:44:37.360 --> 01:44:40.150
with their genetic information.

01:44:40.150 --> 01:44:43.550
And I think this is a
really important part of it.

01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:48.200
We've hit enough people having
tested themselves now that it's

01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:51.460
very likely when you
go to a cocktail party

01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:53.370
with 30 or 40
people in the room,

01:44:53.370 --> 01:44:55.870
at least one or two of them
will have tested their DNA.

01:44:55.870 --> 01:44:57.840
And they may be
talking about it.

01:44:57.840 --> 01:45:00.900
And so we've reached this
threshold for viral spread.

01:45:00.900 --> 01:45:04.520
Word of mouth, so important.

01:45:04.520 --> 01:45:06.580
A great parallel would
be the film industry.

01:45:06.580 --> 01:45:10.410
This is what the film industry
typically wants to see.

01:45:10.410 --> 01:45:14.110
You pump a ton of money upfront
before the film comes out

01:45:14.110 --> 01:45:16.890
into promotion,
marketing, advertising.

01:45:16.890 --> 01:45:19.590
And you make all your
money in the first weekend,

01:45:19.590 --> 01:45:21.260
or the first couple of weeks.

01:45:21.260 --> 01:45:24.440
So ideally, you're going to see
in the film industry something

01:45:24.440 --> 01:45:27.130
like that in terms of revenue.

01:45:27.130 --> 01:45:30.870
But occasionally, a
film will come out.

01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:32.370
And it's released
in a few theaters.

01:45:32.370 --> 01:45:35.090
And it generates some buzz and
starts to get good reviews.

01:45:35.090 --> 01:45:37.459
And the filmmakers and the
distributors say, well,

01:45:37.459 --> 01:45:39.750
maybe we should release it
in more theatres, and so on.

01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:41.540
And it continues to grow.

01:45:41.540 --> 01:45:43.100
And I think that's
what we're seeing

01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:45.020
in the genomics industry.

01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:48.400
My Big Fat Greek Wedding being
one of my favorite films,

01:45:48.400 --> 01:45:49.340
a really good example.

01:45:49.340 --> 01:45:51.423
And you'll notice that it
actually made more money

01:45:51.423 --> 01:45:52.720
in the end than Twilight did.

01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:56.406
So anyway, I'm
going to end there.

01:45:56.406 --> 01:45:59.030
And if you want more information
about the Genographic project,

01:45:59.030 --> 01:46:01.022
there's the url.

01:46:01.022 --> 01:46:02.018
Thank you.

01:46:02.018 --> 01:46:05.382
[APPLAUSE]

01:46:11.110 --> 01:46:12.420
-OK.

01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:15.650
So what we'll do now is
have a little discussion

01:46:15.650 --> 01:46:17.140
among ourselves
for a few minutes

01:46:17.140 --> 01:46:19.760
as people collect their
thoughts in the audience.

01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:23.320
And I'll ask when we
transition to the audience

01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:27.170
in a few minutes that you
stand in front of the mic,

01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:30.090
and that will be my signal
to make that transition.

01:46:30.090 --> 01:46:34.310
And put your comments in
the form of a question.

01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:35.415
Just like Jeopardy.

01:46:35.415 --> 01:46:38.720
A short question, ideally.

01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:42.460
And we'll ask you to
identify yourself, as well.

01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:50.110
So I'll start this off by
asking John a question.

01:46:50.110 --> 01:46:54.065
So you had a tree that included
Neanderthals and Denisovans

01:46:54.065 --> 01:46:55.360
and modern.

01:46:55.360 --> 01:47:01.880
And the Neanderthal had all this
flat, non-diverse branching.

01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:06.020
But the Denisovan
had just one branch.

01:47:06.020 --> 01:47:07.850
But you described all
kinds of modern DNA.

01:47:07.850 --> 01:47:14.520
Is there a difficulty there in
characterizing the diversity?

01:47:14.520 --> 01:47:15.550
Tell us about that.

01:47:15.550 --> 01:47:17.720
Sure.

01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:21.070
The Denisovan we only know about
from one genome, fundamentally.

01:47:21.070 --> 01:47:23.040
We have a couple
of other specimens

01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:24.980
that have mitochondrial
genomes that we know

01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:26.740
that it's not just a one-off.

01:47:26.740 --> 01:47:31.000
But we only a very limited
amount about its diversity.

01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:33.600
We have two ways of
looking at diversity

01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:35.930
with genomes in this sense.

01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:38.940
We could look at between
the samples, in a sense.

01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:41.030
And we can look
at within samples,

01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:43.960
because a genome
encompasses variation

01:47:43.960 --> 01:47:48.350
from the entire population
that produced it, in a sense.

01:47:48.350 --> 01:47:50.570
With Denisovans, we have
an additional option,

01:47:50.570 --> 01:47:53.910
which is to look at the
present-day people that

01:47:53.910 --> 01:47:56.490
carry some fraction
of Denisovan genes,

01:47:56.490 --> 01:47:59.720
and characterize the diversity
between that fraction

01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:04.260
in living people and that same
fraction in the ancient genome.

01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:05.760
Sort of interesting
with Denisovans,

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:09.852
because when you do
that, the Denisovans-- I

01:48:09.852 --> 01:48:11.810
love the fact that we
have a name for something

01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:13.790
that we can't see.

01:48:13.790 --> 01:48:17.810
But the Denisovans that
contributed to living people

01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:21.440
are different from the Denisovan
that we have in this cave.

01:48:21.440 --> 01:48:23.840
That may be not too
terribly unexpected,

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.990
considering that the
living people that carry it

01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:29.570
are in Australia and in
the Sahul ancient land

01:48:29.570 --> 01:48:34.160
mass, and the cave where we
find them is in the Altai.

01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:36.540
But this may have been a
population that, itself,

01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:41.020
was diverse, maybe as diverse
as living peoples' populations.

01:48:41.020 --> 01:48:44.300
Yeah, there's always a problem
comparing variation that way.

01:48:44.300 --> 01:48:46.500
But we can try to parse it out.

01:48:46.500 --> 01:48:48.280
And you look within
those genomes,

01:48:48.280 --> 01:48:52.250
and you're looking at what
are homogeneous ancestral

01:48:52.250 --> 01:48:53.900
populations of them.

01:48:53.900 --> 01:48:56.290
And where we see
divisions between them,

01:48:56.290 --> 01:48:58.830
they really stick out to us.

01:48:58.830 --> 01:49:01.960
With living people,
you're looking at-- I

01:49:01.960 --> 01:49:05.740
like to emphasize to people--
you're looking at a population

01:49:05.740 --> 01:49:09.810
structure where it's actually
very difficult to create

01:49:09.810 --> 01:49:12.590
a tree like that, because
it creates the impression

01:49:12.590 --> 01:49:14.560
that people are
quite separate, when

01:49:14.560 --> 01:49:18.000
in reality, every different
component of our genome

01:49:18.000 --> 01:49:20.030
has different geographic
distributions.

01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:22.520
In fact, we're sort of a smear.

01:49:22.520 --> 01:49:25.420
In the distant past, it looks
like we were less of a smear.

01:49:25.420 --> 01:49:31.810
It looks like we really were,
in some sense, subspecies

01:49:31.810 --> 01:49:33.220
once upon a time.

01:49:33.220 --> 01:49:34.670
And today's humans are not.

01:49:34.670 --> 01:49:37.220
Today's humans are really
clinal in their variation,

01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:40.430
and are exceptionally
similar compared

01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:41.860
to these ancient people.

01:49:41.860 --> 01:49:44.480
-So just to follow
a tiny bit more.

01:49:44.480 --> 01:49:47.060
If you did that same
exercise of comparing

01:49:47.060 --> 01:49:51.810
modern Denisovans with
ancient Denisovans, and it

01:49:51.810 --> 01:49:53.220
looks diverse.

01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:56.500
And the Neanderthals, your
whole tree was ancient.

01:49:56.500 --> 01:49:59.950
What if you look at modern
Neanderthals, like you and me?

01:49:59.950 --> 01:50:03.690
And are we non-diverse, as well?

01:50:03.690 --> 01:50:07.110
-It's a super question,
because it's the obvious one.

01:50:07.110 --> 01:50:09.040
And people haven't done it yet.

01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:13.340
We are looking at, in you
and me, 3% of our genome

01:50:13.340 --> 01:50:14.840
coming from Neanderthals.

01:50:14.840 --> 01:50:18.440
And that 3% in you
and that 3% in me

01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.390
doesn't overlap a whole lot.

01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:23.020
They're fundamentally
rare genes.

01:50:23.020 --> 01:50:25.420
And we are mostly
not overlapping.

01:50:25.420 --> 01:50:29.990
-So that means there is 6%
between the two of us, right?

01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:32.180
-We don't know what
the asymptote is.

01:50:32.180 --> 01:50:33.720
But if you start
adding up people,

01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:37.270
you start to get up
to-- we, today, sample,

01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:40.360
among probably everyone in
this room, more than half

01:50:40.360 --> 01:50:41.930
of the Neanderthal genome.

01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:45.820
But it's distributed
as rare segments

01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:47.720
in different ones of us.

01:50:47.720 --> 01:50:51.810
-So somebody might
have all of it, huh?

01:50:51.810 --> 01:50:56.780
-If they do, I want to write
a comic book about them.

01:50:56.780 --> 01:50:59.880
-They'll be my superhero.

01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:01.630
So quick one for Beth.

01:51:01.630 --> 01:51:04.730
By the way, any of
you can chime in here.

01:51:04.730 --> 01:51:10.680
You are making the argument
that as the habitat degraded

01:51:10.680 --> 01:51:15.620
or disappeared or went
up, the populations

01:51:15.620 --> 01:51:19.640
would track for your
stuffed animals, the horse

01:51:19.640 --> 01:51:22.860
and the caribou and so on.

01:51:22.860 --> 01:51:25.430
But for the caribou, it
looked like the population

01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:29.410
is almost perfectly flat, while
the habitat was going really

01:51:29.410 --> 01:51:30.870
south fast.

01:51:30.870 --> 01:51:33.470
So did I misinterpret that plot?

01:51:33.470 --> 01:51:34.370
-No, it's right.

01:51:34.370 --> 01:51:37.300
Caribou was
non-significant as far

01:51:37.300 --> 01:51:39.760
as tracking the habitat changes.

01:51:39.760 --> 01:51:46.640
And caribou, they've lived
in the very high Arctic,

01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:47.930
and they need this.

01:51:47.930 --> 01:51:50.890
They have a very good strategy
for surviving long-term.

01:51:50.890 --> 01:51:54.589
And that is that they hang out
in places where people don't.

01:51:54.589 --> 01:51:56.380
So they still live in
the very high Arctic.

01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:59.300
They eat lichens and
things like this.

01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:01.717
And their populations have
actually done really well,

01:52:01.717 --> 01:52:04.050
as other things that would
have been competing with them

01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:06.020
for resources have collapsed.

01:52:06.020 --> 01:52:08.600
So what you see there
is a second-order effect

01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:10.310
of the horses and
bison and mammoths

01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:12.215
disappearing from
the part of the range

01:52:12.215 --> 01:52:14.090
that they would have
overlapped with caribou.

01:52:14.090 --> 01:52:16.010
And even though the
habitat is declining,

01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:17.486
caribou have hung on.

01:52:17.486 --> 01:52:19.610
Something about their
ecology makes them different.

01:52:19.610 --> 01:52:21.620
And because there's no
longer any competition,

01:52:21.620 --> 01:52:24.275
their populations have
actually increased in size,

01:52:24.275 --> 01:52:26.400
even though the amount of
habitat available to them

01:52:26.400 --> 01:52:27.250
is declining.

01:52:27.250 --> 01:52:29.870
This is just further
proof-- like we needed any--

01:52:29.870 --> 01:52:32.640
that things don't
act in isolation.

01:52:32.640 --> 01:52:35.530
Species and organisms
are part of an ecosystem.

01:52:35.530 --> 01:52:38.110
And the ecosystem is
dynamic and always changing.

01:52:38.110 --> 01:52:40.050
And what we observe in
these different species

01:52:40.050 --> 01:52:42.524
is a combination of
effects from everything

01:52:42.524 --> 01:52:43.940
that's going on
in that ecosystem.

01:52:47.620 --> 01:52:51.150
-Spencer, you concluded on
a very provocative note.

01:52:51.150 --> 01:52:53.550
I thought it was
really interesting.

01:52:53.550 --> 01:52:56.550
Your plot is going
up quite steeply.

01:52:56.550 --> 01:52:59.690
When do we get-- so
we're like 2 million now.

01:52:59.690 --> 01:53:03.370
When do we get to 7.2 billion?

01:53:03.370 --> 01:53:05.660
-When the price drops.

01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:08.460
-That's meant seriously.

01:53:08.460 --> 01:53:11.030
-I don't think it's
going to anytime soon.

01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:13.150
I think there are huge
markets outside of the US.

01:53:13.150 --> 01:53:17.700
Most of the sales at the
moment are in the US or Canada.

01:53:17.700 --> 01:53:21.630
I think what's going to
drive that is utility.

01:53:21.630 --> 01:53:24.180
And the primary utility people
gain from the testing right

01:53:24.180 --> 01:53:25.520
now is genealogical.

01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:28.300
So they're finding second and
third cousins in the database.

01:53:28.300 --> 01:53:30.117
As the database
increases in size,

01:53:30.117 --> 01:53:31.200
you increase that utility.

01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:33.920
You're more likely to have
cousins that are in there.

01:53:33.920 --> 01:53:36.450
So it's price and utility.

01:53:36.450 --> 01:53:39.160
Sequencing is becoming
very, very cheap.

01:53:39.160 --> 01:53:41.190
And I'm on the
scientific advisory board

01:53:41.190 --> 01:53:44.850
of a startup called Helix,
which is a spin-off of Illumina.

01:53:44.850 --> 01:53:48.450
And one of the things that's
underpinning what they're doing

01:53:48.450 --> 01:53:51.160
is an exome-- so all
the coding regions

01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:54.680
of your genome-- for
significantly less than $100.

01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:57.230
And that is simply
unattainable outside

01:53:57.230 --> 01:53:59.700
of that organization right now.

01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:01.280
And as that price
approaches zero,

01:54:01.280 --> 01:54:04.530
it's going to become
much more widespread.

01:54:04.530 --> 01:54:10.560
-So once we have a
family tree of everybody,

01:54:10.560 --> 01:54:16.460
we've had instances where people
have been convicted or found

01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:19.760
based on getting DNA from their
brother or sister or something

01:54:19.760 --> 01:54:20.700
like that.

01:54:20.700 --> 01:54:24.700
So basically, it will
be nowhere to hide.

01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:26.220
-In essence, yeah.

01:54:26.220 --> 01:54:28.270
Yeah, that's what it means.

01:54:28.270 --> 01:54:31.710
I think, again, showing utility
is going to be important.

01:54:31.710 --> 01:54:33.510
But I do think that
in the next 10 years,

01:54:33.510 --> 01:54:36.130
it will be routine to
have your child tested

01:54:36.130 --> 01:54:41.160
either at birth or in utero with
non-invasive prenatal testing.

01:54:41.160 --> 01:54:43.600
And you will be seen
as an unfit parent

01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:45.580
if you choose to
ignore that information

01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:47.470
and not get yourself tested.

01:54:47.470 --> 01:54:51.230
And in fact, there was a lawsuit
a few years ago in France.

01:54:51.230 --> 01:54:55.130
A child born with Down syndrome
sued his parents successfully

01:54:55.130 --> 01:54:57.100
for having had him,
knowing that he was

01:54:57.100 --> 01:54:58.460
going to have Down Syndrome.

01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:00.376
Now, there was a technical
reason he did that.

01:55:00.376 --> 01:55:02.960
It was so he could access
certain financial benefits

01:55:02.960 --> 01:55:04.580
as a result of the ruling.

01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:07.612
But you have a couple
more lawsuits like that,

01:55:07.612 --> 01:55:09.820
and there's going to be a
strong incentive for people

01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:12.340
to do this testing.

01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:12.980
-Wow.

01:55:12.980 --> 01:55:13.730
That's impressive.

01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:21.000
Beth, I noticed on
your horse slides

01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:26.590
you had GRIN2B as one of
the genes on their behavior.

01:55:26.590 --> 01:55:28.530
Sorry.

01:55:28.530 --> 01:55:29.030
This has--

01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.530
-Pass.

01:55:32.710 --> 01:55:35.430
-This has been associated
with actual experiments

01:55:35.430 --> 01:55:38.220
have been done on
mice showing an impact

01:55:38.220 --> 01:55:40.040
on their intelligence.

01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:42.700
-Does it make them
smarter or not?

01:55:42.700 --> 01:55:44.580
-Depending on what
you do with it.

01:55:44.580 --> 01:55:44.770
-Depends on the mutation.

01:55:44.770 --> 01:55:47.120
So I wonder if the horses
have the smart version

01:55:47.120 --> 01:55:48.742
or the dumber version?

01:55:48.742 --> 01:55:50.700
-Just wondering whether
you have done anything.

01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:52.246
-I think I have
the dumber version.

01:55:52.246 --> 01:55:53.370
-You had it under behavior.

01:55:53.370 --> 01:55:54.447
What did that mean?

01:55:54.447 --> 01:55:55.030
-I don't know.

01:55:55.030 --> 01:55:57.898
Those were lists that
came out of my paper.

01:55:57.898 --> 01:56:00.350
I'm sorry.

01:56:00.350 --> 01:56:00.850
Pass.

01:56:03.890 --> 01:56:08.070
-Have you been to
Sergei's Pleistocene Park?

01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:11.020
It's not that far
from the Yukon.

01:56:11.020 --> 01:56:14.000
It's right next door, according
to your favorite politician.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:14.862
-I haven't been.

01:56:14.862 --> 01:56:16.155
Have you?

01:56:16.155 --> 01:56:17.720
-I haven't been there, either.

01:56:17.720 --> 01:56:18.890
-Do you want to go?

01:56:18.890 --> 01:56:19.430
-Yeah, sure.

01:56:19.430 --> 01:56:19.770
-Let's go.

01:56:19.770 --> 01:56:20.311
-Let's do it.

01:56:20.311 --> 01:56:21.604
OK.

01:56:21.604 --> 01:56:22.520
-This is a field trip.

01:56:22.520 --> 01:56:26.110
-A National Geographic
trip, right.

01:56:26.110 --> 01:56:27.910
-Do you have that
power any more?

01:56:27.910 --> 01:56:29.350
-I do, actually.

01:56:29.350 --> 01:56:30.519
I'm still leading jet trips.

01:56:30.519 --> 01:56:32.560
-There might be enough
people in the audience who

01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:34.830
could underwrite it for us.

01:56:34.830 --> 01:56:36.720
-Who is interested?

01:56:36.720 --> 01:56:39.480
-Who wants to come too?

01:56:39.480 --> 01:56:42.990
Do you know what the
square kilometers is?

01:56:42.990 --> 01:56:44.340
-He's always buying more space.

01:56:44.340 --> 01:56:47.560
He just bought another big plot
of land just south of Moscow

01:56:47.560 --> 01:56:49.060
and some farmland
that he bought up.

01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:51.272
He's calling it
Pleistocene Park 2.

01:56:51.272 --> 01:56:52.480
-It's a little further south.

01:56:52.480 --> 01:56:52.690
-Yeah.

01:56:52.690 --> 01:56:53.240
But it's closer.

01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:54.490
-To a population center, yeah.

01:56:54.490 --> 01:56:56.996
-It's easier to
access by a highway,

01:56:56.996 --> 01:56:58.370
so that he can
get more visitors.

01:56:58.370 --> 01:57:00.620
-This is a real real estate
opportunity for all of you

01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:02.290
out there.

01:57:02.290 --> 01:57:05.650
We're going to need a lot of
land for the 80,000 mammoths

01:57:05.650 --> 01:57:08.140
we're going to have
in a few years.

01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:09.610
80,000?

01:57:09.610 --> 01:57:13.620
-Well, the bison made
this huge resurgence

01:57:13.620 --> 01:57:15.820
from just a couple
hundred bison.

01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:20.260
Basically extinct
to 500,000 now.

01:57:20.260 --> 01:57:23.420
And, of course, there has to
be ranchers or public lands

01:57:23.420 --> 01:57:25.180
to support all these bison.

01:57:25.180 --> 01:57:28.330
And the reason it did-- I'm
sure everybody can guess--

01:57:28.330 --> 01:57:30.050
is there are some
financial incentives.

01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:33.990
And it was the bison
burgers and other meat

01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:37.860
that's about 10 times lower
in fat and cholesterol.

01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:39.990
-So you think mammoth
burgers are going to be the--

01:57:39.990 --> 01:57:41.781
-Well, we'll make
low-cholesterol mammoths.

01:57:49.790 --> 01:57:52.564
Yes.

01:57:52.564 --> 01:57:53.980
-The question is,
so when we think

01:57:53.980 --> 01:57:55.440
of the past in
prehistoric creatures,

01:57:55.440 --> 01:57:57.731
whether they be people or
mammoths or other things that

01:57:57.731 --> 01:57:59.240
used to walk, so
much of, I think,

01:57:59.240 --> 01:58:02.302
our understanding of them
is through the hard tissue

01:58:02.302 --> 01:58:03.510
remains that we have of them.

01:58:03.510 --> 01:58:05.370
So the experience of
going into a museum

01:58:05.370 --> 01:58:08.550
and seeing a mounted skeleton,
or thinking about physically

01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:09.920
what they appeared like.

01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:13.202
How much do you think
the further progression

01:58:13.202 --> 01:58:14.660
of ancient genetic
technologies are

01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:17.160
going to allow us to
conceive of the soft tissue

01:58:17.160 --> 01:58:20.990
and the physiological processes
that made them different, as

01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:23.640
opposed to simply the fact
that they look different.

01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:24.830
-Please state your name.

01:58:24.830 --> 01:58:25.580
-Adam [INAUDIBLE].

01:58:28.850 --> 01:58:30.320
-Well, from the
human perspective,

01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:32.390
I would say we're
talking about things

01:58:32.390 --> 01:58:36.970
like Neanderthal immunity
and Denisovan altitude

01:58:36.970 --> 01:58:38.310
and metabolism.

01:58:38.310 --> 01:58:40.850
And that the genes
that we have today

01:58:40.850 --> 01:58:42.660
from Neanderthals in
northern Europeans

01:58:42.660 --> 01:58:45.350
seem to be associated
with lipid metabolism.

01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:47.160
It's stuff that you
never would have

01:58:47.160 --> 01:58:49.490
seen in the archaeological
fossil record.

01:58:49.490 --> 01:58:51.000
And that's really exciting.

01:58:51.000 --> 01:58:53.040
But the other side
of that excitement

01:58:53.040 --> 01:58:56.190
is that our inability--
when we see this gene

01:58:56.190 --> 01:58:57.470
is there, what does it do?

01:58:57.470 --> 01:58:59.630
Our inability to
understand that is not

01:58:59.630 --> 01:59:02.690
based on our lack of
fossil evidence anymore.

01:59:02.690 --> 01:59:05.770
It's based on what we don't
know about human biology.

01:59:05.770 --> 01:59:09.860
And so what for me
the promise of this

01:59:09.860 --> 01:59:12.530
is that by studying the
evolution of these things,

01:59:12.530 --> 01:59:14.380
we actually get a
different avenue

01:59:14.380 --> 01:59:17.050
on understanding their
biological significance.

01:59:17.050 --> 01:59:19.990
So it's actually not just
about figuring out what

01:59:19.990 --> 01:59:21.340
the Neanderthals were like.

01:59:21.340 --> 01:59:23.960
It's about using the
fact that Neanderthals

01:59:23.960 --> 01:59:26.940
have an evolutionary history
and a relationship to us

01:59:26.940 --> 01:59:29.230
to figure out how
our bodies work.

01:59:29.230 --> 01:59:30.230
And that's pretty cool.

01:59:30.230 --> 01:59:32.970
-Do you think that the majority
of Neanderthal DNA that

01:59:32.970 --> 01:59:36.026
stuck around in the human
genome has been selected for?

01:59:36.026 --> 01:59:38.160
-I think that the
majority is neutral.

01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:41.820
I think the majority
is just, here it is.

01:59:41.820 --> 01:59:45.450
It's a marker of interactions.

01:59:45.450 --> 01:59:50.480
And we know that there are
windows where nobody today has

01:59:50.480 --> 01:59:51.530
the Neanderthal version.

01:59:51.530 --> 01:59:54.070
So we know that there are
gaps that represent things

01:59:54.070 --> 01:59:55.530
that they had that didn't work.

01:59:55.530 --> 01:59:58.380
There are some things that
look like they're useful,

01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:00.960
that they've really grown in
frequency beyond what you'd

02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.200
expect.

02:00:02.200 --> 02:00:03.270
-MHC alleles.

02:00:03.270 --> 02:00:05.152
-Exactly.

02:00:05.152 --> 02:00:06.860
-I think this question
actually brings up

02:00:06.860 --> 02:00:09.193
something that's important,
both to the work that you're

02:00:09.193 --> 02:00:11.909
doing with mammoths and to
a lot of work that we're

02:00:11.909 --> 02:00:12.950
doing with other animals.

02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:16.120
And that is that we
now have more letters,

02:00:16.120 --> 02:00:19.550
more A's, G's, C's, and
T's than we understand.

02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:21.170
And for humans,
it's a special case.

02:00:21.170 --> 02:00:22.830
We know a lot more
about human biology

02:00:22.830 --> 02:00:24.910
than we do about
elephant biology or bison

02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:26.300
biology or horse biology.

02:00:26.300 --> 02:00:30.920
So we have the capacity to
make these lists of genes that

02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:34.130
were identified, mostly in
models-- model organisms,

02:00:34.130 --> 02:00:37.400
not wild animals-- and guess
what they might have done.

02:00:37.400 --> 02:00:39.270
But we're very much
at the point right now

02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:41.260
of trying to figure it all out.

02:00:41.260 --> 02:00:45.940
We have a lot of massive phone
books filled with numbers,

02:00:45.940 --> 02:00:48.640
but no names associated
with those numbers.

02:00:48.640 --> 02:00:51.480
-Which is a huge
shift in genetics.

02:00:51.480 --> 02:00:54.289
When I was getting my PhD
in Dick Lewontin's lab,

02:00:54.289 --> 02:00:55.830
Lewontin was famous
for saying, we've

02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:58.870
created this huge apparatus in
terms of theoretical population

02:00:58.870 --> 02:00:59.370
genetics.

02:00:59.370 --> 02:01:01.453
And we're ready to crank
the handle on the machine

02:01:01.453 --> 02:01:02.570
and get it analyzing data.

02:01:02.570 --> 02:01:03.709
Where is the data?

02:01:03.709 --> 02:01:06.000
Generating the data was the
hard part back in the '80s.

02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:07.250
And now, it's just ubiquitous.

02:01:10.460 --> 02:01:12.210
-This has been a really
wonderful morning.

02:01:12.210 --> 02:01:13.800
Thank you, all of you.

02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:15.010
My name is Abigail.

02:01:15.010 --> 02:01:19.490
I run a nanotechnology lab
at the Koch Institute at MIT.

02:01:19.490 --> 02:01:24.319
And this question is to all four
of you, but John in particular.

02:01:24.319 --> 02:01:26.110
You mentioned at the
beginning of your talk

02:01:26.110 --> 02:01:30.170
that 10, 15 years
ago, there were really

02:01:30.170 --> 02:01:34.220
big questions that divided the
communities that have really

02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:35.920
now had a chance
to come together,

02:01:35.920 --> 02:01:38.760
which is an amazing thing.

02:01:38.760 --> 02:01:41.650
What kinds of questions
do you see now

02:01:41.650 --> 02:01:45.720
as being really divisive
that DNA has yet

02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:47.290
to be able to answer?

02:01:47.290 --> 02:01:49.060
Maybe it could in the future.

02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:52.960
But what are some of those
big, dividing questions?

02:01:52.960 --> 02:01:55.400
And this could be to everyone.

02:01:55.400 --> 02:01:58.686
-I'll take it first, because
the other part of talk

02:01:58.686 --> 02:02:00.560
that I gave in Gibraltar
was this side-- what

02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:02.080
does the future look like?

02:02:02.080 --> 02:02:06.810
And from my point of view,
I'm interested in things

02:02:06.810 --> 02:02:10.510
like how did it come to be
that humans had this population

02:02:10.510 --> 02:02:12.200
structure in the past?

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:14.700
What does that mean
relative to the way

02:02:14.700 --> 02:02:18.210
that we understand humans
to be distributed today

02:02:18.210 --> 02:02:21.210
as a widespread species with
great genetic commonalities

02:02:21.210 --> 02:02:22.830
among us?

02:02:22.830 --> 02:02:28.400
What can we make of rare
evidence in the past?

02:02:28.400 --> 02:02:30.010
I think of
archaeological evidence,

02:02:30.010 --> 02:02:31.880
and the fact that
we're now discovering

02:02:31.880 --> 02:02:36.409
that there's significant
plant use by Neanderthals.

02:02:36.409 --> 02:02:38.950
For instance, we used to think
of them as purely meat eaters,

02:02:38.950 --> 02:02:41.050
but we're finding the
evidence of the plant foods

02:02:41.050 --> 02:02:42.860
that they ate in
dental calculus.

02:02:42.860 --> 02:02:44.550
And now, we're
able to actually do

02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:48.480
some sequencing of oral
bacteria to try to understand

02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:50.220
their oral microbiomes.

02:02:50.220 --> 02:02:54.730
And those sorts of things
which suddenly give us

02:02:54.730 --> 02:02:57.690
a window on something that
we couldn't look at before,

02:02:57.690 --> 02:03:00.620
but the window is small,
and we know that it

02:03:00.620 --> 02:03:02.610
represents a larger world.

02:03:02.610 --> 02:03:06.370
How do we use rare evidence
to talk about things

02:03:06.370 --> 02:03:12.050
that were probably important,
but we can't see very much of?

02:03:12.050 --> 02:03:14.520
I don't know that
we're now polarized.

02:03:14.520 --> 02:03:16.350
I get a lot of happy feelings.

02:03:16.350 --> 02:03:18.870
I don't think that
we're divided by things.

02:03:18.870 --> 02:03:21.910
But I think that we're in a
phase where we haven't thought

02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:25.130
of the questions that
will dominate what we're

02:03:25.130 --> 02:03:26.797
doing for the next 15 years.

02:03:30.790 --> 02:03:32.700
-Heather [INAUDIBLE].

02:03:32.700 --> 02:03:35.870
I'm interested in human
evolution, particularly

02:03:35.870 --> 02:03:37.610
the evolution of language.

02:03:37.610 --> 02:03:42.110
And I think that that
may be significantly tied

02:03:42.110 --> 02:03:46.960
to the difference between
humans and non-human primates

02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:48.990
being concealed ovulation.

02:03:48.990 --> 02:03:51.740
The question that
I'm curious about,

02:03:51.740 --> 02:03:56.810
has anyone identified
where on the genome

02:03:56.810 --> 02:04:00.760
the genes for concealed
ovulation might be located?

02:04:00.760 --> 02:04:03.500
Could that be figured
out by comparing it

02:04:03.500 --> 02:04:07.410
to non-human primates who do
not have concealed ovulation?

02:04:07.410 --> 02:04:12.600
And once you have identified
the genes associated

02:04:12.600 --> 02:04:15.150
with concealed
ovulation, I'm wildly

02:04:15.150 --> 02:04:18.900
curious to know if
the fossil records,

02:04:18.900 --> 02:04:20.730
if any of these
ancient fossils--

02:04:20.730 --> 02:04:23.590
I think if we can find an
indication that they had

02:04:23.590 --> 02:04:27.230
concealed ovulation, then I'm
really willing to speculate

02:04:27.230 --> 02:04:29.970
that they might have language
skills for a whole lot

02:04:29.970 --> 02:04:31.080
of other reasons.

02:04:31.080 --> 02:04:33.998
But I'm just wondering if
anybody's thought about that,

02:04:33.998 --> 02:04:36.664
and if that could be identified,
and what the significance of it

02:04:36.664 --> 02:04:37.164
might be.

02:04:37.164 --> 02:04:38.412
-That's a good question.

02:04:38.412 --> 02:04:40.870
--[INAUDIBLE], presumably, is
looking into stuff like that.

02:04:40.870 --> 02:04:41.180
-Yeah.

02:04:41.180 --> 02:04:42.830
There are a number
of people looking

02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:44.820
into these sorts of things.

02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:46.220
A significant problem.

02:04:46.220 --> 02:04:49.620
This falls into the category
of we don't really understand

02:04:49.620 --> 02:04:51.190
how it works in humans.

02:04:51.190 --> 02:04:53.500
And comparisons
with other primates

02:04:53.500 --> 02:04:55.310
where it's not
concealed ovulation

02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:57.520
are a window of looking at that.

02:04:57.520 --> 02:05:01.940
But also, experimental
models become a possibility.

02:05:01.940 --> 02:05:03.850
And people make
transgenic mice and try

02:05:03.850 --> 02:05:06.850
to figure out what's going on.

02:05:06.850 --> 02:05:08.920
But at the moment, we
don't know the answer.

02:05:12.760 --> 02:05:14.150
-Good morning.

02:05:14.150 --> 02:05:15.450
I'm [INAUDIBLE].

02:05:15.450 --> 02:05:17.220
I'm researcher at UMass Boston.

02:05:17.220 --> 02:05:22.186
I have a question about a very
widespread kind of notion.

02:05:22.186 --> 02:05:25.830
While both John and Spencer
pointed out that notion again,

02:05:25.830 --> 02:05:28.850
it is that I want
to see how truthful

02:05:28.850 --> 02:05:33.370
the fact that we all
originated from Africa.

02:05:33.370 --> 02:05:35.515
How about ancient people
in the Middle East?

02:05:35.515 --> 02:05:38.660
I'm Originally from
Iraq, Babylonian Assyria.

02:05:38.660 --> 02:05:41.130
And I have my own
family tree over there.

02:05:41.130 --> 02:05:44.610
And it goes back to, let's
say, just before Islam.

02:05:44.610 --> 02:05:46.490
And that's all.

02:05:46.490 --> 02:05:48.580
There's known lineage.

02:05:48.580 --> 02:05:50.280
We cannot be sure about that.

02:05:50.280 --> 02:05:52.320
So I want to know why is that?

02:05:52.320 --> 02:05:53.730
How far is that?

02:05:53.730 --> 02:05:56.500
How truthful that
kind of notion?

02:05:56.500 --> 02:06:01.300
On what basis scientists
based their notion that we all

02:06:01.300 --> 02:06:05.350
share African genes originally?

02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:06.910
-It's based on the
fact that Africans

02:06:06.910 --> 02:06:09.550
have far more genetic
diversity than people

02:06:09.550 --> 02:06:11.230
living outside of Africa.

02:06:11.230 --> 02:06:12.460
It's just absolutely clear.

02:06:12.460 --> 02:06:15.940
If I could show you a tree of
what the mitochondrial lineages

02:06:15.940 --> 02:06:19.340
really look like,
98% of the variation

02:06:19.340 --> 02:06:20.900
is found in African populations.

02:06:20.900 --> 02:06:22.562
The non-Africans
are a tiny subset.

02:06:22.562 --> 02:06:24.020
Now, we've given
them more letters,

02:06:24.020 --> 02:06:27.370
because scientists started off
looking at Native Americans

02:06:27.370 --> 02:06:28.070
and Europeans.

02:06:28.070 --> 02:06:29.790
And so they just
added new letters.

02:06:29.790 --> 02:06:31.410
So everybody in
Africa falls into what

02:06:31.410 --> 02:06:32.890
they call the L branch.

02:06:32.890 --> 02:06:35.240
But L is huge, and
very, very diverse.

02:06:35.240 --> 02:06:36.870
This is mitochondrial DNA.

02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:38.280
Same thing for nuclear DNA.

02:06:38.280 --> 02:06:40.170
You see far more
diversity within Africa

02:06:40.170 --> 02:06:41.520
than outside that.

02:06:41.520 --> 02:06:43.380
And the only way
to explain that is

02:06:43.380 --> 02:06:45.670
that people have been
living in Africa for longer,

02:06:45.670 --> 02:06:47.530
accumulating more diversity.

02:06:47.530 --> 02:06:49.699
It's had a larger
effective population size.

02:06:49.699 --> 02:06:51.740
It hasn't gone through
the sequential bottlenecks

02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:53.550
that you see in
non-African populations

02:06:53.550 --> 02:06:56.090
as they move into the Middle
East, then East Asia, then

02:06:56.090 --> 02:06:57.960
the Americas, and so on.

02:06:57.960 --> 02:07:01.180
It's just it's very clear
from the genetic information.

02:07:01.180 --> 02:07:02.990
-Yeah.

02:07:02.990 --> 02:07:06.340
We do have ancestry from
some non-African peoples.

02:07:06.340 --> 02:07:08.930
But the fraction is quite
small from Neanderthals

02:07:08.930 --> 02:07:09.870
and other people.

02:07:09.870 --> 02:07:12.920
One thing to keep in mind is
that the time scale that we're

02:07:12.920 --> 02:07:15.400
talking about for the
colonization of the world,

02:07:15.400 --> 02:07:18.540
initially, by these
African people

02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:22.790
is on the time scale of
50,000 to 70,000 years

02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:25.720
or longer, which, in
historic terms, of course,

02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:28.920
is 10 times the length
of all recorded history.

02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:33.440
So we are talking about events
that are shaded in the past.

02:07:33.440 --> 02:07:35.160
But they were events
that fundamentally

02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:37.950
shaped what today's genetic
variation throughout the world

02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:38.940
is.

02:07:38.940 --> 02:07:42.030
-Now, there are some
paleoanthropologists

02:07:42.030 --> 02:07:45.650
who feel that Homo
erectus originated in Asia

02:07:45.650 --> 02:07:48.460
and migrated back into
Africa, and ultimately that's

02:07:48.460 --> 02:07:51.280
the source of modern humans.

02:07:51.280 --> 02:07:54.140
In a long circuitous
way, ultimately, erectus

02:07:54.140 --> 02:07:55.600
does come out of Africa as well.

02:07:55.600 --> 02:07:58.120
But they went out into Asia,
and possibly came back,

02:07:58.120 --> 02:07:59.160
and then went back out.

02:07:59.160 --> 02:08:00.820
It's very complicated.

02:08:00.820 --> 02:08:04.530
-The earliest good erectus stuff
we have is outside of Africa.

02:08:04.530 --> 02:08:05.306
-Dmanisi.

02:08:05.306 --> 02:08:05.930
-Yeah, Dmanisi.

02:08:05.930 --> 02:08:10.530
So it's quite possible that
there were multiple foci that

02:08:10.530 --> 02:08:14.060
led to, ultimately, the success
and proliferation of what

02:08:14.060 --> 02:08:19.600
is today a fundamentally
African origin population.

02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:21.860
-Leonard Katz, MIT.

02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:24.700
There's been debate
about what role

02:08:24.700 --> 02:08:26.840
lethal raiding
between groups may

02:08:26.840 --> 02:08:29.850
have played in human evolution.

02:08:29.850 --> 02:08:33.540
Besides some evidence from
hunter gatherer groups,

02:08:33.540 --> 02:08:36.040
there's that of
chimpanzees, which

02:08:36.040 --> 02:08:38.980
practice lethal intergroup
raiding, which can lead

02:08:38.980 --> 02:08:41.630
to local extinctions of groups.

02:08:41.630 --> 02:08:43.790
On the other hand,
there were the bonobos,

02:08:43.790 --> 02:08:47.830
which seem to be nicer.

02:08:47.830 --> 02:08:51.230
In something that
NPR ran this summer,

02:08:51.230 --> 02:08:56.110
they seem to be suggesting
that that interbreeding shows

02:08:56.110 --> 02:08:58.350
that our ancestors
were like bonobos.

02:08:58.350 --> 02:09:02.220
On the other hand,
there is genetic data

02:09:02.220 --> 02:09:07.520
that seem to show differences
between mitochondrial DNA and Y

02:09:07.520 --> 02:09:09.930
chromosome DNA in
populations, which

02:09:09.930 --> 02:09:14.050
may show selective
wiping out of local males

02:09:14.050 --> 02:09:15.970
by conquering males.

02:09:15.970 --> 02:09:19.850
Now, how do you see
the data that you know,

02:09:19.850 --> 02:09:23.830
which is much greater,
connecting with this debate?

02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:27.110
-This is one of the big
shifts in our understanding.

02:09:27.110 --> 02:09:29.910
Archaeology has been through
a very interesting history

02:09:29.910 --> 02:09:30.890
over the last century.

02:09:30.890 --> 02:09:32.640
So a century ago,
it was a question

02:09:32.640 --> 02:09:35.940
of looking for homelands and
the wandering of peoples,

02:09:35.940 --> 02:09:38.350
and as they spread, they
spread their culture.

02:09:38.350 --> 02:09:42.310
And there was a lot of
talk of conquest and so on.

02:09:42.310 --> 02:09:46.039
And that fell out of favor in
the middle of the 20th century.

02:09:46.039 --> 02:09:48.580
What seems pretty clear there,
though, from the genetic data,

02:09:48.580 --> 02:09:51.140
is that that's probably
the way things happened.

02:09:51.140 --> 02:09:53.500
So as part of the
Genographic project

02:09:53.500 --> 02:09:56.750
we had an ancient DNA team led
by Alan Cooper and Wolfgang

02:09:56.750 --> 02:09:57.840
Haak.

02:09:57.840 --> 02:10:00.407
And they, as part of their
contribution to the project,

02:10:00.407 --> 02:10:02.490
did these things they call
transects through time.

02:10:02.490 --> 02:10:05.525
Very well-studied archaeological
sites-- Central Germany,

02:10:05.525 --> 02:10:07.900
there is one in Spain, there's
one in northeastern Europe

02:10:07.900 --> 02:10:11.340
as well-- where they go back to
about 6,000 years of history.

02:10:11.340 --> 02:10:12.530
It's well-documented.

02:10:12.530 --> 02:10:13.500
We have carbon dates.

02:10:13.500 --> 02:10:15.310
We know exactly what
the cultures are.

02:10:15.310 --> 02:10:18.520
When you see a cultural shift
at a certain point in time,

02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:20.970
you see an abrupt
genetic shift, as well.

02:10:20.970 --> 02:10:25.540
So maybe the people wandered
away and another group came in.

02:10:25.540 --> 02:10:27.830
But I think what's more
likely is that you literally

02:10:27.830 --> 02:10:30.288
had conquering groups of people
who came in and killed them

02:10:30.288 --> 02:10:31.300
off.

02:10:31.300 --> 02:10:32.111
Like it or not.

02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:37.980
My name is Irwin Shapiro.

02:10:37.980 --> 02:10:41.190
And I'm an astrophysicist
by profession.

02:10:41.190 --> 02:10:44.630
I have an interest
in biology, just as

02:10:44.630 --> 02:10:46.780
an avocation, if you will.

02:10:46.780 --> 02:10:50.670
I have a question in
regard to the DNA.

02:10:50.670 --> 02:10:56.790
I hear statements like
99.6% of the DNA of humans

02:10:56.790 --> 02:11:00.030
is the same as
chimpanzees or whatever.

02:11:00.030 --> 02:11:05.340
And I also hear
that we only know

02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:09.390
what something like
few percent of our DNA

02:11:09.390 --> 02:11:11.290
is good for-- making proteins.

02:11:11.290 --> 02:11:14.730
There are 23,000 genes,
or whatever they are.

02:11:14.730 --> 02:11:19.480
I was wondering if the
differences between individuals

02:11:19.480 --> 02:11:23.490
in a given species and between
species, whether anyone has

02:11:23.490 --> 02:11:26.200
looked at the
percent differences

02:11:26.200 --> 02:11:31.100
in the stuff we know what it
does versus the stuff we don't

02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:34.460
know what it does, and
whether this could give us

02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:39.430
any insights into possible
testing with lower animals

02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:43.530
or whatever as to what the
stuff we don't know about

02:11:43.530 --> 02:11:45.610
might be good for?

02:11:45.610 --> 02:11:47.090
If that's a coherent question.

02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:55.340
Protein-coding genes-- the
things that we know, at least,

02:11:55.340 --> 02:11:57.870
that make a protein--
tend to be conserved,

02:11:57.870 --> 02:12:02.050
which means that they don't vary
as much as other genetic parts

02:12:02.050 --> 02:12:07.250
of our genome, because if they
change, it often breaks it.

02:12:07.250 --> 02:12:09.130
Conserved means that
different species

02:12:09.130 --> 02:12:12.480
are more similar than they are
for the rest of the genome.

02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:15.790
So in that sense,
the parts that we

02:12:15.790 --> 02:12:18.380
think we know that, at
least, they make a product,

02:12:18.380 --> 02:12:22.140
and here's what it is,
tend to be less variable.

02:12:22.140 --> 02:12:24.720
But, of course, the variations
that occur in those parts

02:12:24.720 --> 02:12:28.090
tend to be pretty significant,
because they are variations

02:12:28.090 --> 02:12:29.650
that change the function.

02:12:29.650 --> 02:12:32.480
In part, we use
evidence about how much

02:12:32.480 --> 02:12:34.510
different parts
of the genome vary

02:12:34.510 --> 02:12:37.190
to try to understand how
that evolution happened.

02:12:37.190 --> 02:12:38.690
And that's true not
only, of course,

02:12:38.690 --> 02:12:40.220
within humans and
other primates,

02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:42.705
but across huge
swaths of species.

02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:49.520
-I'm Catherine [INAUDIBLE].

02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:52.320
I work with students
at Regis College.

02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:56.990
And I wanted to ask a question
related to probabilities.

02:12:56.990 --> 02:12:59.370
In other words,
when we say there's

02:12:59.370 --> 02:13:04.340
been a genetic change
discovered here,

02:13:04.340 --> 02:13:07.070
and we see that
same change here,

02:13:07.070 --> 02:13:08.870
we assume there's relationship.

02:13:08.870 --> 02:13:12.340
But what's the mathematical
probability that these two

02:13:12.340 --> 02:13:16.142
changes happened independently?

02:13:16.142 --> 02:13:17.600
-So there are
regions of the genome

02:13:17.600 --> 02:13:19.190
that change very rapidly.

02:13:19.190 --> 02:13:20.880
They're hyper-variable.

02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:23.330
Microsatellites would
be an example of that.

02:13:23.330 --> 02:13:28.560
So repeats of, say, 10
or 12 or 14 CAG CAG CAG.

02:13:28.560 --> 02:13:30.520
And they tend to
add and subtract

02:13:30.520 --> 02:13:33.930
repeats very, very rapidly
in an evolutionary sense.

02:13:33.930 --> 02:13:36.320
So in that case, you
do have convergence.

02:13:36.320 --> 02:13:40.260
We do have homoplasy, as
it's known phylogenetically.

02:13:40.260 --> 02:13:41.901
But for the typical
point mutation,

02:13:41.901 --> 02:13:43.650
unless you happen to
be in a region that's

02:13:43.650 --> 02:13:45.130
prone to a high
mutation rate, it's

02:13:45.130 --> 02:13:46.810
exceedingly rare
that you're going

02:13:46.810 --> 02:13:49.672
to see exactly the same
mutation in the same location.

02:13:49.672 --> 02:13:50.380
Just do the math.

02:13:50.380 --> 02:13:52.680
You've got 3 billion
some-odd nucleotides

02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:55.210
in the human genome.

02:13:55.210 --> 02:13:57.280
Depending on the
population size,

02:13:57.280 --> 02:13:59.420
yes, if the human population
size were infinite,

02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:01.794
you would see the same mutations
occurring independently.

02:14:01.794 --> 02:14:03.570
But the human population
size has actually

02:14:03.570 --> 02:14:06.090
been relatively small
throughout most of our history.

02:14:06.090 --> 02:14:08.090
And we went through a
near-extinction event,

02:14:08.090 --> 02:14:10.920
probably around 70,000
to 75,000 years ago,

02:14:10.920 --> 02:14:12.680
where we think the
total number of humans

02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:14.790
alive dropped down
to fewer than 10,000.

02:14:14.790 --> 02:14:16.870
Possibly as few as a
couple of thousand.

02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:17.850
We came back from that.

02:14:17.850 --> 02:14:19.970
And that's why we have
a remarkably low level

02:14:19.970 --> 02:14:22.390
of genetic variation
as a species.

02:14:22.390 --> 02:14:26.001
So it really depends on
the region of the genome

02:14:26.001 --> 02:14:26.750
you're looking at.

02:14:26.750 --> 02:14:30.460
The ones that we tend to use
to reconstruct these trees

02:14:30.460 --> 02:14:32.690
don't change that often.

02:14:32.690 --> 02:14:35.220
And because of the tree
structure and the context

02:14:35.220 --> 02:14:37.660
and the fact that
they're not recombining,

02:14:37.660 --> 02:14:40.720
and so you're dealing with
a single intact chunk of DNA

02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:42.490
for the Y chromosome
and mitochondrial

02:14:42.490 --> 02:14:45.160
DNA, when you do see
recurrent mutations,

02:14:45.160 --> 02:14:46.790
you can actually notice them.

02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:48.360
They stand out very clearly.

02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:50.610
And you can exclude
that as a marker.

02:14:50.610 --> 02:14:53.650
-In fact, we use the rates of
the genome that mutate really

02:14:53.650 --> 02:14:55.750
quickly, that change
a lot, when we're

02:14:55.750 --> 02:14:59.030
interested in learning something
that happened recently in time,

02:14:59.030 --> 02:15:01.980
and the regions of the genome
that are more conserved when

02:15:01.980 --> 02:15:04.390
we want to understand
deeper evolutionary history.

02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:06.210
So if we're trying
to reconstruct

02:15:06.210 --> 02:15:08.360
the relationship between
all great ape species,

02:15:08.360 --> 02:15:10.990
we're going to focus on
parts of the genome that

02:15:10.990 --> 02:15:12.960
mutate more slowly
than if we were going

02:15:12.960 --> 02:15:17.690
to focus on reconstructing the
population history of the bison

02:15:17.690 --> 02:15:19.170
from Wood Buffalo National Park.

02:15:19.170 --> 02:15:22.660
We might use something
that's really fast-changing.

02:15:22.660 --> 02:15:25.260
And there, you really do have
to incorporate the possibility

02:15:25.260 --> 02:15:27.190
that you see the same
mutation happening

02:15:27.190 --> 02:15:28.440
more than once in your models.

02:15:28.440 --> 02:15:29.919
And that's done
probabilistically.

02:15:33.492 --> 02:15:37.156
-We're getting close to the
last two questions, I think.

02:15:37.156 --> 02:15:38.280
-My name is Charlotte Seed.

02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:40.250
And I manage a
genetic biorepository

02:15:40.250 --> 02:15:41.730
at Northeastern University.

02:15:41.730 --> 02:15:43.980
And my question is
primarily for Beth.

02:15:43.980 --> 02:15:46.410
In the field of
ancient DNA, what

02:15:46.410 --> 02:15:47.840
are considered
the best practices

02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:49.905
for preserving these
incredibly precious samples?

02:15:49.905 --> 02:15:51.620
Do you, say, treat
them any different

02:15:51.620 --> 02:15:53.210
from the other
samples in your lab?

02:15:53.210 --> 02:15:57.300
And has your work
with these DNA samples

02:15:57.300 --> 02:16:00.840
changed, maybe, your approach
to archiving and storing

02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:03.481
current DNA?

02:16:03.481 --> 02:16:03.980
-Yes.

02:16:03.980 --> 02:16:07.360
So the biggest problem
with ancient DNA

02:16:07.360 --> 02:16:12.170
is contaminating the sample
that you already have.

02:16:12.170 --> 02:16:14.560
So we have a separate
lab that everybody

02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:15.640
wears the bunny suit in.

02:16:15.640 --> 02:16:19.540
It looks like a lab
that you might work in

02:16:19.540 --> 02:16:21.816
if you're working with
really terrible diseases.

02:16:21.816 --> 02:16:23.690
But rather than having
negative air pressure,

02:16:23.690 --> 02:16:26.452
we have positive air pressure
to push stuff out of the labs

02:16:26.452 --> 02:16:27.660
that we don't want to get in.

02:16:27.660 --> 02:16:29.110
Everybody covers up.

02:16:29.110 --> 02:16:32.040
And we never do any
sort of amplification

02:16:32.040 --> 02:16:34.440
of DNA in the ancient DNA lab.

02:16:34.440 --> 02:16:37.049
And there's only
one-directional workflow.

02:16:37.049 --> 02:16:39.190
There's all sorts of
things that we implement.

02:16:39.190 --> 02:16:40.900
Sterilize everything
that we're using.

02:16:40.900 --> 02:16:41.956
Try to eliminate DNA.

02:16:41.956 --> 02:16:42.830
And it's still there.

02:16:42.830 --> 02:16:45.129
If you do deep
sequencing of nothing,

02:16:45.129 --> 02:16:47.730
you will get all sorts of
domestic animals and human DNA.

02:16:47.730 --> 02:16:49.520
It just happens.

02:16:49.520 --> 02:16:52.480
And microbial DNA, obviously.

02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:54.870
We do know that
short-term storage affects

02:16:54.870 --> 02:16:57.000
the preservation of DNA.

02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:00.540
In 2000, long time ago,
we were using PCR just

02:17:00.540 --> 02:17:02.500
to amplify different
length fragments

02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:04.020
from different samples.

02:17:04.020 --> 02:17:06.430
In the '50s, there
was gold mining taking

02:17:06.430 --> 02:17:08.440
place in Fairbanks, Alaska.

02:17:08.440 --> 02:17:10.487
And the samples that
were discovered,

02:17:10.487 --> 02:17:13.070
the bones that were discovered
as part of this, were split up.

02:17:13.070 --> 02:17:15.542
And some of them stayed
in Alaska and some of them

02:17:15.542 --> 02:17:18.000
went to the American Museum of
Natural History in New York,

02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:19.910
where they stored
them in the attic.

02:17:19.910 --> 02:17:21.930
And in Alaska at
the museum, there

02:17:21.930 --> 02:17:23.650
was a constant temperature.

02:17:23.650 --> 02:17:25.809
Little bit colder than
room temperature room

02:17:25.809 --> 02:17:26.870
where they were stored.

02:17:26.870 --> 02:17:29.639
So we took samples that were the
same age-- about 20,000 years

02:17:29.639 --> 02:17:31.100
old-- and amplified them.

02:17:31.100 --> 02:17:33.219
They were all taken out
of the ground in Fairbanks

02:17:33.219 --> 02:17:34.420
in the '50s.

02:17:34.420 --> 02:17:38.750
And the samples that were in
New York, the average fragment

02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:40.250
length that we could
get out of them

02:17:40.250 --> 02:17:42.059
was about 70 or 80 base pairs.

02:17:42.059 --> 02:17:44.959
But we could get 600 to
700 base pair fragments out

02:17:44.959 --> 02:17:45.980
of the Alaskan ones.

02:17:45.980 --> 02:17:48.990
In 50 years of being in the
attic, where in the summer

02:17:48.990 --> 02:17:51.320
it was 40 degrees above
0, in the winter it was

02:17:51.320 --> 02:17:55.709
40 degrees below 0
Celsius, this had

02:17:55.709 --> 02:17:58.170
broken all of these
fragments of DNA

02:17:58.170 --> 02:18:00.730
down in just that short
of an amount of time.

02:18:00.730 --> 02:18:03.700
So the preservation of samples
after they have been taken out

02:18:03.700 --> 02:18:05.330
of the ground is,
actually, critically

02:18:05.330 --> 02:18:08.510
important for
preserving their DNA.

02:18:08.510 --> 02:18:12.889
And yeah, we try to keep
things in cool and constant

02:18:12.889 --> 02:18:15.980
temperature environments, with
as little exposure to changes

02:18:15.980 --> 02:18:17.420
in ambient moisture as possible.

02:18:17.420 --> 02:18:20.930
I think the water, actually,
expansion and contraction

02:18:20.930 --> 02:18:24.049
of water molecules, may
physically break down the DNA.

02:18:24.049 --> 02:18:26.992
But yeah, it has changed the
way we think about things.

02:18:29.799 --> 02:18:30.299
Hi.

02:18:30.299 --> 02:18:31.450
My name is Beth Thomas.

02:18:31.450 --> 02:18:32.620
I'm with Harvard management.

02:18:32.620 --> 02:18:35.850
And I have a
question for Spencer.

02:18:35.850 --> 02:18:40.350
And it has to do with the
future utility of the data

02:18:40.350 --> 02:18:43.410
that you may be
collecting, or they

02:18:43.410 --> 02:18:47.549
are collecting in the
genographics project

02:18:47.549 --> 02:18:48.520
that you're doing.

02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:50.400
And it's been interesting
watching Facebook.

02:18:50.400 --> 02:18:53.709
Just in a few years, they're
well over a billion members,

02:18:53.709 --> 02:18:55.540
albeit it's free.

02:18:55.540 --> 02:18:59.209
But as the pricing for
these kits declines,

02:18:59.209 --> 02:19:04.500
and maybe more momentum and
just the word of mouth gets out,

02:19:04.500 --> 02:19:09.559
it's going to be interesting
to see just how many people do

02:19:09.559 --> 02:19:10.420
use those kits.

02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:13.040
And I'm just curious
what you think the maybe

02:19:13.040 --> 02:19:15.750
future of that data is?

02:19:15.750 --> 02:19:17.420
If there's been a
progressive reveal

02:19:17.420 --> 02:19:20.360
or progressive
realization about what

02:19:20.360 --> 02:19:23.870
might be what the
information from Facebook

02:19:23.870 --> 02:19:25.940
might be used for it
in the future-- ads,

02:19:25.940 --> 02:19:29.609
whatever-- is there
a similar trajectory

02:19:29.609 --> 02:19:32.190
with the data at that project?

02:19:32.190 --> 02:19:37.139
-So, again, what's driving a
lot of the interest in consumer

02:19:37.139 --> 02:19:41.420
genomics right now is
genealogy and ancestry.

02:19:41.420 --> 02:19:43.980
Some people literally know
nothing about their ancestry.

02:19:43.980 --> 02:19:45.520
They're just
curious to see, am I

02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:49.080
part European, part East
Asian, whatever it might be?

02:19:49.080 --> 02:19:51.050
Other people--
African Americans--

02:19:51.050 --> 02:19:53.264
are looking for a connection
to a tribal group,

02:19:53.264 --> 02:19:54.930
perhaps, in West
Africa, because they've

02:19:54.930 --> 02:19:59.050
lost that written history about
that side of their family.

02:19:59.050 --> 02:20:01.440
A lot of people are interested
in finding their cousins.

02:20:01.440 --> 02:20:03.270
They've got some issue
in their genealogy

02:20:03.270 --> 02:20:05.090
that can't be solved
with written records.

02:20:05.090 --> 02:20:06.465
And the only way
to resolve it is

02:20:06.465 --> 02:20:08.230
to test disparate parts
of the family tree

02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:10.600
and see if they
actually do connect.

02:20:10.600 --> 02:20:13.790
So ancestry is the
primary driver right now.

02:20:13.790 --> 02:20:15.260
That's for a couple of reasons.

02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:18.740
One is that the FDA shut down
that aspect of 23 and Me,

02:20:18.740 --> 02:20:23.810
which is one of the big players
in the field, the medical side.

02:20:23.810 --> 02:20:27.130
Part of the reason for doing
that is because of the way 23

02:20:27.130 --> 02:20:29.560
and Me chose to
deal with the FDA.

02:20:29.560 --> 02:20:32.350
I don't think if they had
handled things differently

02:20:32.350 --> 02:20:34.950
they would have necessarily
had that part shut down.

02:20:34.950 --> 02:20:37.230
Part of it, though, is
because we haven't really

02:20:37.230 --> 02:20:40.060
shown the utility of
medical genetic testing

02:20:40.060 --> 02:20:42.130
for most healthy people.

02:20:42.130 --> 02:20:44.850
We still don't know enough
about the underlying biology

02:20:44.850 --> 02:20:47.750
and what all of these millions
of SNPs-- single nucleotide

02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:49.450
polymorphisms-- really do.

02:20:49.450 --> 02:20:50.980
Do they have any effect?

02:20:50.980 --> 02:20:52.380
Is the effect significant?

02:20:52.380 --> 02:20:53.890
Is it actionable?

02:20:53.890 --> 02:20:57.180
If somebody tells you you've
got a 1.2% higher risk of type 2

02:20:57.180 --> 02:20:58.780
diabetes because
you've got a marker

02:20:58.780 --> 02:21:03.630
at whatever the locus is, is
that really meaningful to you?

02:21:03.630 --> 02:21:08.330
Those are the bigger
questions in human biology.

02:21:08.330 --> 02:21:12.130
I'm going to have to take strong
exception to both of those.

02:21:12.130 --> 02:21:14.350
When the FDA shut
down 23 and Me,

02:21:14.350 --> 02:21:19.720
it did not shut down 500 other
medical genetics centers.

02:21:19.720 --> 02:21:23.100
And they were providing
very high-quality data

02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:27.760
at many stages of
the human cycle.

02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:30.380
So there are very
valuable things

02:21:30.380 --> 02:21:33.530
that you can do pre-conception,
while you're still deciding

02:21:33.530 --> 02:21:37.430
who you're going to mate with.

02:21:37.430 --> 02:21:39.480
Noninvasive prenatal
testing you can now

02:21:39.480 --> 02:21:40.620
get from mother's blood.

02:21:40.620 --> 02:21:41.120
-Absolutely.

02:21:41.120 --> 02:21:43.720
-This is done in millions
of women around the world.

02:21:43.720 --> 02:21:46.790
-But I said the utility for
healthy adults hasn't really--

02:21:46.790 --> 02:21:51.290
-But you still have the market
includes healthy adults that

02:21:51.290 --> 02:21:53.540
are planning on procreating.

02:21:53.540 --> 02:21:57.260
And then, for healthy adults,
there is a long list of things

02:21:57.260 --> 02:21:58.230
we cannot do.

02:21:58.230 --> 02:22:01.400
But there is also a significant
list of things we can do,

02:22:01.400 --> 02:22:02.940
including various cancers.

02:22:02.940 --> 02:22:04.810
Angelina Jolie was the--

02:22:04.810 --> 02:22:05.920
-BRCA.

02:22:05.920 --> 02:22:08.900
---the person who really changed
consciousness a little bit

02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:10.210
on that.

02:22:10.210 --> 02:22:13.610
So I think there's been
a tendency in the media

02:22:13.610 --> 02:22:17.010
to focus on the half
empty part of the glass.

02:22:17.010 --> 02:22:21.300
But I think we've
reached the tipping point

02:22:21.300 --> 02:22:24.850
that Helix and others
will exploit and make

02:22:24.850 --> 02:22:26.580
it available to all of us.

02:22:26.580 --> 02:22:29.430
So it's not 20 years
away and always will be.

02:22:29.430 --> 02:22:30.725
It's happened a few years ago.

02:22:30.725 --> 02:22:31.600
-Oh, I totally agree.

02:22:31.600 --> 02:22:34.490
-It became valuable for
adults whether or not

02:22:34.490 --> 02:22:35.460
they're procreating.

02:22:35.460 --> 02:22:37.560
-Absolutely.

02:22:37.560 --> 02:22:40.640
The problem with the 23
and Me data, of course,

02:22:40.640 --> 02:22:43.015
is that it's all
based on chip results.

02:22:43.015 --> 02:22:45.140
The markers on chips are
relatively high frequency.

02:22:45.140 --> 02:22:47.389
-They're at a relative
minority of the medical record.

02:22:47.389 --> 02:22:49.209
-And we're not
discovering anything new.

02:22:49.209 --> 02:22:51.250
The real utility is going
to come from sequencing

02:22:51.250 --> 02:22:53.260
a lot of people, as you know.

02:22:53.260 --> 02:22:56.640
-And that's exactly
what the 500 others do.

02:22:56.640 --> 02:22:59.230
All the high-quality medical
data comes from them.

02:22:59.230 --> 02:23:02.613
And some of them are in
the $100 to $200 range.

02:23:08.214 --> 02:23:09.380
-I want to thank this panel.

02:23:09.380 --> 02:23:11.530
This has been fascinating.
