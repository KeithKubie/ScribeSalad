00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.960
You're probably already familiar with
some forms of carbon. For example this

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.410
graph I write over here,

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.540
this is one form carbon takes. Very
important when you're writing with a

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.450
pencil, otherwise you would not see any 
writing. If you didn't have the graphite

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.889
scraping onto your,

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.140
scraping onto your paper, which you and
your paper is also. It's not pure carbon,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.390
but it has a lot of carbon

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:23.210
in it. This right over here is a raw
diamond,

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.279
another form the carbon can take under
intense time or after a long period of

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.470
time under intense

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.760
pressure. But what you may or may not
realize

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.100
is that carbon is actually essential for
life. In fact life as we know it

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.120
is carbon-based, so carbon-based,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.190
based life. When we look for signs of
life, at least life as we know on other

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.180
planets,we are looking for signs of
carbon-based life. And there might be

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.579
other forms, other

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.210
other elements that form the backbone of
life. But carbon is the only one

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.770
that we have been able to observe. Now
why

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.699
is carbon so valuable for life? Why does 
it form the backbone

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.239
of the molecules that make life
possible ? What all comes down to where it

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.330
sits in the periodic table? And how many

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.490
and its atomic number and how it tends
to bond with things?

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.549
So this is why Chemistry is important. 
So carbon we see over here has an

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:14.860
atomic number six,

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.890
which by definition means it has 6
protons.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.439
So far we draw its nucleus it would
have 1,2 ,

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.799
3, 4, 5, 6 protons.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:28.280
And the most common isotope of carbon on earth

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.590
is carbon 12, which also has six neutrons. So let
me draw that in this nucleus 1,

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.960
2, 3, 4, 5, 6

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.799
neutrons. And then neutral carbon is going to have six electrons.

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:44.030
And so two of them are going to be in
their inner most in the first

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.090
shell .So that's two of them right over
there.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.590
These are the inner
shell.  I guess you could say or the

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.490
so that's the first two electrons ,and
then you have four remaining in its

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:57.420
outermost shell.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.090
And these four considered valence
electrons, these are the electrons that

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.080
actually do

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.060
the reacting. And if any of this seems
unfamiliar to you,I encourage you to watch

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.820
the videos on Khan Academy on things
like

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.320
valence electrons, but this is a little
bit overview right over here.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.460
Carbon has four valence electrons. 
Valence electrons are the ones

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.660
that do or that tend to do the
reacting.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.580
And so I could if I wanted to simplify
this drawng over here,I could say ,"Okay

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.440
carbon."And if I register as valence
electrons which is a typical thing to do.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.890
I could say carbon has 1,

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.110
2, 3 ,4

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.820
valence electrons. Now you might remember the octet rule that

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.600
that atoms tend to be more stable when
they at least pretend, like they

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.970
with that they're sharing or that they
have eight electrons in there outermost

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.890
shell.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.550
So carbon can do that by forming 4
covalent bonds.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.680
For example it could do that with
hydrogen.This hydrogen over here has one

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.270
valence electron. It actually has one
electron. Now the hydrogen feels good. It

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.940
feels like its sharing two-electrons
filling its

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.060
its first shell .Hydrogen is just trying to fill out the first

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.950
shell, feel a little bit more like helium
and now carbon says," Oh,now I get to share

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.920
share this electron." And then carbon can do it again with another hydrogen.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.239
It can do it again with another
hydrogen. And it can do it again

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.720
with another hydrogen. So now carbon can feel like," Hey I'm sharing eight 
electrons

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.100
and the each of the hydrogens feel like, "Oh look you know I I'm sharing two

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:24.530
electrons." Everyone seems to be happy
everyone seems to be stable.

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.280
And this molecule right over here, this
is methane ,this is methane.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.010
And by definition because it involves
carbon it is considered an organic

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.780
molecule.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.150
It is considered an organic molecule. In
fact, the whole

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.530
the whole field of Organic Chemistry is
all about studying

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.739
organic molecules which are molecules
that have carbon.

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.160
Now because this only has carbon and
hydrogen in it,it  is also considered to be

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.580
a Hydrocarbon.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.150
Hydrocarbon Hydrocarbon.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.900
And you might be familiar with things
like  gasoline being considered a

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.060
Hydrocarbon. And it is indeed

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.820
a Hydrocarbon. In fact gasoline gasoline actually even

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.300
even methane could be

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.230
used as fuel right over here. But in
typically you can see these long chains of

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.040
hydrocarbons.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.250
For example, you could have 8 carbons
form octane. You might be familiar things

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.010
like high octane fuel.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.620
So let's see carbon 2, 3,

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.050
4, 5, 6, 7,

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.130
8. This is a hydrocarbon. Its Octane because

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:34.180
it has 8 carbons Oct, Octane. In  all the
other bonds remember carbon forms 4

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.040
bonds. It typically forms 4 bonds.

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.680
So now that carbon has 4 bonds. Now this
carbon has 4 bonds. Now this carbon

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.620
2 of them to hydrogen ,2 of them to carbon.2 to hydrogen,

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.860
2 to carbon. Hopefully this starts to give you an 
appreciation why

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.860
carbon is so useful as a building block
because it can form so many bonds with

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.430
so many different structures.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.460
And these hydrocarbons they can be
chains or they can even form,

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.280
they can even form rings they can form
cycles.And in things like

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:06.780
graphite and in diamond carbons can form
these lattice structures, where you know

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.750
know carbon is for

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:11.090
is bonding. Carbon is forming is bonding
to

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:14.260
more than two carbons in these three
dimensional shapes.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.380
In these three, in these three
dimensional

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:20.680
shapes. And the shape because it's
forming three bonds

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.730
that that carbon typically forms bonds in
these are called

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.520
tetrahedral shapes or tetrahedral
bonding. And when someone says tetrahedron

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.580
if someone says tetrahedron they're
talking about

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.510
they're talking about a..Wait let me use 
a different color.

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.510
So a tetrahedron is

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:43.040
a three-dimension, a three-dimensional
shape that has four sides each of which

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.060
are triangles.

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.440
Each of which are triangles. So it
would look

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:52.040
like this. You could do it as a pyramid with a triangular base.

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:56.020
A pyramid with a triangular base. And
when carbon forms bonds as in the case

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.540
have this methane right over here.

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.560
I'd rather the carbon in the middle as this,

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.240
yellow circle ,then each of the hydrogens over here

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.450
are going to be at the corners

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.760
or at you say the vertices of
the tetrahedron.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:15.490
And so this is the tetrahedral shape
that carbon

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.930
is actually forming. Of course you have
these co valent bonds right over here.

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:23.729
Let me do this in a different color. You
have these covalent bonds over here

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:27.990
and we could draw it like this. We could
draw these covalent bonds

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.400
like this. That's 1 of them, maybe that's this one over here.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.550
This one over here is right over here.These electrons are all just buzzing around.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:39.630
And then the one we have over here and then

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.010
you have one over here. So you might see methane

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.690
sometimes just drawn like this. You might just see it drawn,

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:50.080
you might just see it drawn like this.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:54.310
But it's really forming, it's really forming
 a tetrahedral

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.870
a tetrahedral shape. Me finished drawing it, so

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:04.580
hydrogen hydrogen hydrogen hydrogen where each of these lines represent a pair of
e

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:05.400
electrons here.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:09.560
Eight electrons being shared in
aggregate, but the actual shape is closer

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.070
to this.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:13.630
Now I'm claiming to you that it's the
backbone

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:18.430
of life or life as we know it. And its
even the back bone of life is

00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:20.280
as you are.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.690
Life in the form of you.  We've
already talked about you being a

00:07:23.690 --> 00:07:24.390
majority

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:28.180
water and that's why if you look at the
average human being is the average human

00:07:28.180 --> 00:07:29.280
being is going to be

00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:32.599
roughly depends on how much how hot well hydrated you are in

00:07:32.599 --> 00:07:36.260
your stage of development. The average human
being is going to be sixty-five percent

00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.450
oxygen by mass. So you are two-thirds

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.800
oxygen that's because of all of the
water. Water is H2O.

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:47.310
And oxygen forms the bulk of the mass of the water molecule.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.610
But in second place comes carbon. In
second place comes carbon.

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:55.849
Carbon is approximately 18 % of your body's mass.

00:07:55.849 --> 00:07:59.890
And this is because everything, but the
non fluid ,the non liquid

00:07:59.890 --> 00:08:00.800
part of your body.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.800
In there's a lot of carbon going on there.

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.849
This right over is a DNA molecule and so

00:08:05.849 --> 00:08:09.039
these little grey areas, this is
all carbon.

00:08:09.039 --> 00:08:12.300
This right over here, this right over
here

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.909
is Hexokinase. I'm not going to go
into the details about what it does.

00:08:16.909 --> 00:08:20.460
But Hexokinas is a protein.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:25.330
Hexokinas and the teal colored that you see there,

00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:30.190
that is all carbon. That's all carbon.
This right over here is glucose.

00:08:30.190 --> 00:08:34.500
It is very sweet.It's an important way to regulate your body's energy.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:39.579
And the teal color that is carbon. This
is ATP, often considered to be the

00:08:39.579 --> 00:08:43.690
the molecular currency of the energy in
your body. And all the teal there this is

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:44.769
carbon. This is why

00:08:44.769 --> 00:08:48.029
a lot, especially the non water part
of your body

00:08:48.029 --> 00:08:52.540
is carbon. So hopefully this gives you a
better appreciation for

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.690
carbon. It's not just useful for
pencils and diamonds, but even if you're

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:56.910
just looking at your hand

00:08:56.910 --> 00:08:58.829
You're looking at a lot of carbon.
