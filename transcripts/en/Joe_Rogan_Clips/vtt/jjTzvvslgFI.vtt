00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.640
The Joe Rogan experience.
Oh,
they're all assholes.
Teenage boys.

2
00:00:05.641 --> 00:00:08.430
This gets shit on me.
My friend Eric said,
it's my friend Eric Crisp.

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.820
He said it to me once.
He's like,
you know,
because uh,

4
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.070
he was dealing with some teenage boys in his hometown and he was like,

5
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.640
the teenage boys are the most fucking dangerous animals on the planet because

6
00:00:17.641 --> 00:00:21.240
they have all this testosterone.
No one's really giving them any guidance yet.

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.560
They're sort of just out there wild and they're trying to outdo each other one

8
00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:29.790
up each other,
you know,
and then they're,
they're cruel,
they're cruel.

9
00:00:29.791 --> 00:00:31.380
And they also are insecure.

10
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.590
And so one of the ways to combat that insecurity is to try to make someone else

11
00:00:34.591 --> 00:00:38.070
feel like shit.
It's like,
it's some weird natural instinct that people have.

12
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.240
Well that,
that is,
that's what gossip is.
Hatred.

13
00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.730
Gossip is mild hatred and go sit when you say so and so they're less that you

14
00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.230
lower their standards,
you low there,
uh,

15
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.620
respect or the value or whatever by saying something.

16
00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.780
Or You could do it as an action.
And in doing so,
you raise your own saying,

17
00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.600
at least we're not them because they are shitheads sure less than us.

18
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.950
And that is a,

19
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.540
that has gone on since the dawn of time,
unfortunately.

20
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.020
Well that's where you see the social currency of today is like shame climate,

21
00:01:10.021 --> 00:01:14.070
like shaming people for this or that are attacking people for whatever various

22
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:16.800
things to do and trying to get public shame against people.

23
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.230
But especially people that haven't really done anything wrong.

24
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.830
What they're doing is they're trying to do that to elevate themselves and they

25
00:01:22.831 --> 00:01:24.250
see someone in the public eyes,

26
00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:27.690
he's someone who's famous or rich and they're saying that person's a fucking

27
00:01:27.691 --> 00:01:31.710
loser.
And there,
you know,
it was sports figures and perfect example,
you know,

28
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:36.450
like some super athlete and they drop a ball,
you fucking loser.
You know,
they're,

29
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.490
they're doing this to sort of maximize this sort of this like this downfall,

30
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:44.430
this,

31
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.120
if they see anything that's going wrong with that person's life and if they can

32
00:01:48.121 --> 00:01:49.590
accentuate that and pump it up,

33
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:51.840
but somehow or another they think it elevates them,

34
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.150
it actually does the opposite.
It's terrible for them.

35
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.440
It's terrible for everybody,
but they have this natural instinct,

36
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:02.850
it's competitive instinct to push down the person they think is elevated to
high.

37
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.330
Well,
I think that leads you to the trolling thing online that if you can do from

38
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:09.400
behind a firewall of no one knows who I am.
And,

39
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.470
and I remember there was something,
we have bank notes,

40
00:02:13.471 --> 00:02:17.010
like your bank notes that had a woman on the back of one of our bank notes,

41
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:21.390
the Queensland pictures on the front,
and then they change it up every few years.

42
00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:24.540
And they,
they took the woman who was on the back of it,

43
00:02:24.541 --> 00:02:26.160
I think it was a 10 pound note or something.

44
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:30.150
They took her off and they changed it.
And then there was this campaign,

45
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:33.080
we need to get a w and a woman on the back of another different motives.

46
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.290
Not gonna be that.
And two people,
uh,

47
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.250
troll this,
uh,
I think to him and saying,
you should die.
He'd be raped.
I mean,

48
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.330
hellish stuff.

49
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.470
One of them turned out to be a woman who was actually attacking another boom

50
00:02:45.471 --> 00:02:49.080
that you think or what's going on in your head.
Where's that coming from?

51
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:53.240
But behind this firewall you can,
you can go to any place of also,

52
00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.690
it's almost like they don't think that a person that they're attacking online is

53
00:02:57.691 --> 00:02:58.650
an actual person.

54
00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.530
They're not the social cues from them to not looking at them in their eye.
Yeah.

55
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.710
I just think it's a piss poor way to communicate with people.
I don't,

56
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:09.040
I don't do any communicating with people online.

57
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.920
I don't go back and forth with people on Twitter,
the back and forth.
I don't,

58
00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.430
I don't comment on things.
I don't know anything.

59
00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.690
I S I talked so fucking much as it is doing this.
I'm like,
I've said enough.

60
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.570
I know.
If you don't know how I feel about things,
Jesus Christ,

61
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.440
have you listened to this God damn podcast?
That's me.
All right.

62
00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.980
I don't need to comment on other shit.

63
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.460
I definitely don't need to comment in text form back and forth with the person

64
00:03:30.461 --> 00:03:34.300
and try to explain myself or just no benefit in it.
I used to,

65
00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.420
when I was doing stand up in the clubs and paypal might shout out,

66
00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.110
fuck all of you.
Ah,
so you know from the front and I thought,
well,
you're drunk,

67
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:42.310
you're an idiot.
What am I don't care.

68
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:45.310
And I would not think that person really knows what they're talking about.

69
00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.430
So I wouldn't go into a thing.
I would try and destroy them with,
you know,

70
00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:52.410
you know,
put you on some stuff.
Yeah.
But that's what's happening online.

71
00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.330
If someone's coming to you and I,

72
00:03:53.331 --> 00:03:55.840
and I used to not worry about it before and suddenly I was worried about,

73
00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.940
I don't know.
I actually,
I'm,
I'm not worried about that.

74
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.940
It's just literally like thousands and millions of hecklers.
Yeah.

75
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:06.370
That's really what it is.
It's a heckling thing.
Some of the,
I came up,

76
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.400
the last one I did with somebody,
I said something and someone says,
Hey,

77
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:14.260
is Eddie is a fuck you.
And I wrote back,
no,
fuck you.

78
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:18.220
It was a very witty response.

79
00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.980
That's like five year olds as they say.
Yeah,
you're a loser.
You just,
yes,
exactly.

80
00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.930
Yeah.
He was the loser and I'm better connect.
So stupid.

81
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.610
You never really feel good about it.

82
00:04:30.611 --> 00:04:32.830
Even if you get a real good zinger on somebody,
just like,

83
00:04:32.831 --> 00:04:37.510
what am I doing with my life?
Yeah.
There was uh,
eh.
Yeah.

84
00:04:37.511 --> 00:04:40.060
My Dad's bigger than you at that thing.
Yeah.
That's what was going on.

85
00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.710
And my dad wasn't terribly tall,
so I could have used that.

86
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:47.570
But what does it matter?
It does,
yeah.
And does that really,
you work for him now?

87
00:04:47.571 --> 00:04:51.550
He keeps bumping into stowaways.
Where do you guys,
it's much too tall.
My Dad.

88
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.630
Yeah.
