around on they can measure that in terms

of the amount of the planet it took to
 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.170
of the amount of the planet it took to
develop that so we have measured the

develop that so we have measured the
 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.990
develop that so we have measured the

my life
 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.800
my life
like when I learned that it was just

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810
like when I learned that it was just

so so the old road map this idea that

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060
so so the old road map this idea that
 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.120
so so the old road map this idea that
the earth is a set of infinite resources

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130
the earth is a set of infinite resources
 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.970
the earth is a set of infinite resources
and the economy can harvest those

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980
and the economy can harvest those
 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.070
and the economy can harvest those
resources every which way from Sunday in

order to produce economic growth that's

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690
order to produce economic growth that's
 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:40.080
order to produce economic growth that's
fundamental and then it trickles down to

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090
fundamental and then it trickles down to
 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.500

the human as more is better and part of
 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.740
the human as more is better and part of
that is as the economy grew is

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750
that is as the economy grew is
 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.199
that is as the economy grew is
industrialization and permitted more

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209
industrialization and permitted more
 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.770

labor there was a sort of a peaking out

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.699
of of consumption around the 1920s and
it became a problem like what are we

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709
it became a problem like what are we
 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:03.780
it became a problem like what are we
gonna do so

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790
gonna do so

there's several ways to expand markets
 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.850
there's several ways to expand markets
one is you export and another is to

one is you export and another is to
 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.590
one is you export and another is to
educate your citizens to want more than

educate your citizens to want more than
 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.390
educate your citizens to want more than
they need and then you've got an

they need and then you've got an
 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.570
they need and then you've got an
infinite way to you've got an infinite

so so injustice aside environmental
 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.069
so so injustice aside environmental
integrity aside more as better growth is
