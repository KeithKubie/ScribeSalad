00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.871
- [Voiceover] "A lake near
the Arctic Circle is covered

00:00:02.871 --> 00:00:06.006
"by a 2-meter-thick sheet of ice

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:08.211
"during the cold winter months.

00:00:08.731 --> 00:00:12.043
"When spring arrives, the warm
air gradually melts the ice,

00:00:12.043 --> 00:00:16.686
"causing its thickness to
decrease at a constant rate."

00:00:16.686 --> 00:00:19.242
It's gonna decrease at a constant rate.

00:00:19.682 --> 00:00:24.677
"After 3 weeks, the sheet
is only 1.25 meters thick.

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:29.767
"After 3 weeks, the sheet
is only 1.25 meters thick.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:34.612
"Let S(t) denote the
ice sheet's thickness S

00:00:34.612 --> 00:00:36.865
"(measured in meters) as a function

00:00:36.865 --> 00:00:39.139
"of time (measured in weeks).

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:42.205
"Write the function's formula."

00:00:42.745 --> 00:00:45.316
Alright, so we have some
interesting things here.

00:00:45.726 --> 00:00:48.404
They've given us some
values for this function.

00:00:48.404 --> 00:00:50.378
We know when time is equal to zero.

00:00:50.378 --> 00:00:54.500
We know that S of zero,
when time equals zero,

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.785
that's when the sheet is two meters thick.

00:00:58.465 --> 00:01:00.966
So S of zero is equal to two.

00:01:01.406 --> 00:01:04.031
And they also tell us
that after three weeks,

00:01:04.031 --> 00:01:07.815
the sheet is only 1.25 meters thick.

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:10.718
And when we have the function S of t,

00:01:10.718 --> 00:01:14.411
S is measured in meters,
time is measured in weeks.

00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:16.987
So after zero weeks,
we're two meters thick,

00:01:16.987 --> 00:01:19.858
and then they tell us, after three weeks--

00:01:19.858 --> 00:01:21.553
So S of three.

00:01:21.743 --> 00:01:26.735
After three weeks,
we're 1.25 meters thick.

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.353
Or another way to think about it,

00:01:32.473 --> 00:01:36.924
I could write t here in
weeks and S in meters,

00:01:37.234 --> 00:01:40.220
and when time is zero,
we're two meters thick,

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.590
and when time is 1.--

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.278
Sorry, when time is three weeks,

00:01:46.278 --> 00:01:49.184
we are 1.25 meters thick.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:54.727
So when our change in time
is equal to positive three,

00:01:55.407 --> 00:01:57.613
we increased our time by three,

00:01:57.613 --> 00:02:00.817
what's our change in thickness?

00:02:00.817 --> 00:02:04.484
Our change in thickness,
the triangle here,

00:02:04.484 --> 00:02:07.735
that's the Greek letter delta,
shorthand for "change in,"

00:02:07.735 --> 00:02:12.611
well, this was negative 0.75.

00:02:16.481 --> 00:02:19.415
So what was the rate of
change over this time?

00:02:19.415 --> 00:02:20.948
And they tell us that the rate

00:02:20.948 --> 00:02:23.270
of change is at a constant rate.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:25.615
So whatever it is between
these two periods of time,

00:02:25.615 --> 00:02:27.101
between zero weeks and three weeks,

00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:31.536
it would be that same rate
between any two periods of time,

00:02:31.536 --> 00:02:32.999
between zero week and one week,

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:36.481
or one week and two weeks,
or 1 1/2 weeks and 1.6 weeks.

00:02:37.231 --> 00:02:40.518
So what is the rate of change

00:02:40.518 --> 00:02:43.911
of thickness relative to time?

00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:47.611
Well, it's going to be change in thickness

00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:49.901
over change in time.

00:02:49.901 --> 00:02:52.712
How much does our
thickness change per time?

00:02:53.412 --> 00:02:54.616
Well, we saw right over here.

00:02:55.116 --> 00:02:56.521
Our thickness went down,

00:02:56.751 --> 00:03:01.746
set 0.75 meters in three weeks.

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:08.041
Or we could say that this right

00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:10.780
over here is equal to, let's see.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.076
75 divided by three is 25, so
0.75 divided by three is 0.25.

00:03:15.486 --> 00:03:16.818
We have the negative out there,

00:03:16.818 --> 00:03:21.817
negative 0.25 meters per week.

00:03:23.757 --> 00:03:25.721
So how can we take the information we have

00:03:25.721 --> 00:03:28.877
and express this as a function?

00:03:28.877 --> 00:03:30.340
It's going to be a linear function,

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.102
because we see that we are
changing at a constant rate.

00:03:35.082 --> 00:03:36.169
Let's think about it a little bit.

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:39.047
Linear functions, one way
we could write it is in--

00:03:39.927 --> 00:03:41.278
So we could write it--

00:03:41.278 --> 00:03:42.601
If we were dealing with x and y,

00:03:42.601 --> 00:03:46.060
you might recognize y
is equal to mx plus b,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.498
often written as slope-intercept form.

00:03:48.498 --> 00:03:50.773
This is when you're dealing with x as the,

00:03:50.773 --> 00:03:52.701
I guess you could say
the independent variable,

00:03:52.701 --> 00:03:54.256
y as the dependent variable,

00:03:54.256 --> 00:03:56.276
and b would be where you start.

00:03:56.276 --> 00:03:58.514
What happens when x equals zero

00:03:59.154 --> 00:04:01.525
and m is your rate of
change, it's your slope?

00:04:02.235 --> 00:04:05.675
So in this case, we don't have y and x,

00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:07.585
we're going to have S and t.

00:04:08.165 --> 00:04:09.721
We have S as a function of time,

00:04:10.401 --> 00:04:12.483
and it's going to be equal
to the rate of change...

00:04:13.483 --> 00:04:18.137
times time, plus where we started, plus b.

00:04:18.747 --> 00:04:22.513
Now, what is b going to be?

00:04:23.213 --> 00:04:24.535
Well, one way to think about it is,

00:04:24.535 --> 00:04:26.903
well, what's S of zero going to be?

00:04:26.903 --> 00:04:31.788
S of zero is going to
be m times zero, plus b.

00:04:31.788 --> 00:04:33.623
S of zero is going to be b.

00:04:33.623 --> 00:04:35.271
Well, we already know that this ice sheet,

00:04:35.271 --> 00:04:37.152
it starts off at two meters thick.

00:04:37.152 --> 00:04:40.031
So S of zero is equal
to b, is equal to two.

00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:42.191
So b is equal to two.

00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:44.120
And what is m?

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.138
Well, we've already said,
that's our rate of change,

00:04:46.138 --> 00:04:47.732
that is our slope,

00:04:47.732 --> 00:04:52.307
that is how much our thickness changes

00:04:52.307 --> 00:04:54.373
with respect to time.

00:04:54.373 --> 00:04:57.809
And we already figured out
that that's negative 0.25.

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.849
So m is negative 0.25.

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:06.239
You could say that m is the
slope between this point,

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.815
between the point zero comma two,

00:05:08.815 --> 00:05:11.045
and the point three comma 1.25,

00:05:11.045 --> 00:05:15.643
if we were plotting these points
on a t/S coordinate plane.

00:05:16.403 --> 00:05:18.451
So now we can write what
the function's going to be.

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.657
Maybe I'll do this in a
new color just for fun.

00:05:21.427 --> 00:05:24.256
S of t, thickness as a function of time,

00:05:24.756 --> 00:05:29.756
is going to be equal to m, negative 0.25,

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:34.636
times time, plus two.

00:05:35.086 --> 00:05:37.220
Or if you want, you
could write it like this,

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.369
two minus 0.25t.

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:43.273
I actually like this
form a little bit better.

00:05:43.273 --> 00:05:45.711
In my brain, it kind of describes

00:05:45.711 --> 00:05:47.267
what's happening a little bit more.

00:05:47.267 --> 00:05:48.776
When time is equal to
zero, you're starting

00:05:48.776 --> 00:05:52.700
at two meters thick, and then every week

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.208
that goes by, as t increases by one,

00:05:55.208 --> 00:05:58.552
you're going to lose a quarter of a meter.

00:05:58.552 --> 00:06:01.315
You're going to lose, you
have a negative value right

00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:05.285
over here, you're gonna lose 0.25 meters.

00:06:05.725 --> 00:06:07.700
And if you really want
to kind of get this even

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.465
in a deeper level, I
encourage you to graph it,

00:06:09.465 --> 00:06:11.740
and it'll become even
clearer what's going on here.

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.379
That this right over here
is this right over here,

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:15.069
is this right over here,

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:20.065
this is the slope of the line

00:06:20.865 --> 00:06:24.673
that represents the solution
set to this equation,

00:06:24.673 --> 00:06:27.900
and this two, this would
be your vertical intercept.

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.688
In this case, it would be your S-intercept

00:06:29.688 --> 00:06:32.637
as opposed to your y-intercept,
when y is the vertical axis.
