00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.620
- [Male Voice] I can assure you that what

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.783
you will observe is a vast wasteland.

00:00:04.791 --> 00:00:08.277
(background noise drowns out other sound)

00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:11.694
(instrumental pop music)

00:00:16.785 --> 00:00:20.535
- [Male Voice] And
uncorrupted communication.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.127
(instrumental pop music)

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.670
- No young kid growing up ever dreams

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.160
of someday becoming a businessman.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.370
He wants to be a fireman,
a sponsored athlete

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.360
or a forest ranger.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.210
The Lee Iacoccas, Donald Trumps,

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.950
and Jack Welches of the business world

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.055
are heroes to no one
except other businessmen

00:00:57.055 --> 00:00:58.200
with similar values.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.623
I wanted to be a fur
trapper when I grew up.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.440
So that's what I'm gonna
talk about tonight,

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.860
the kind of odyssey of wanting

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.657
to be a fur trapper to
becoming a garmento (laughs).

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.283
I was born in a little French
Canadian town in Maine,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.023
and when I was seven years old,

00:01:25.597 --> 00:01:28.050
the whole family, the six of us,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.920
got into our automobile
with everything we owned

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.080
and moved to Burbank, California.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.560
And I couldn't speak English,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.630
and I was put in school right away,

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.650
'cause it was the law,

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.730
and I stayed in school
for about three days

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:48.080
and I ran away from school.

00:01:50.455 --> 00:01:52.372
And so when I was young

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:57.830
I could play baseball,

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:01.300
and throw a football as well as anybody,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.453
but when it came time
to do an actual game,

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.760
I always fumbled the ball,

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.440
and I soon learned that
team sports and stuff

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.560
was not my thing.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.810
And I spent my early
childhood in the hills

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.720
above Griffith Park there
in San Fernando Valley

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.060
and high school days hopping freights

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.280
around the country.

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.933
So I've kind of taken a different path,

00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:35.431
and spent a lot of days in the jails.

00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:42.392
(laughs) But in those days it was illegal

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:46.290
not to have a job.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.380
It was called wandering about aimlessly

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.022
with no apparent means of support.

00:02:51.022 --> 00:02:51.855
(audience laughing)

00:02:51.855 --> 00:02:56.000
And it was a crime, so anyway,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.210
one of my favorite quotes
about entrepreneurs

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.890
is if you wanna understand
the entrepreneur,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.624
study the juvenile delinquent.

00:03:03.624 --> 00:03:05.270
(audience laughing)

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.078
'Cause they're saying, this sucks.

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:13.633
(laughs) And I'm gonna do it my own way.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.890
So when I was about 12 or so,

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.410
I got in with a bunch of falconers,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.980
in the San Fernando Valley, some older men

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.460
who didn't mind taking
in a bunch of young guys

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.110
and teaching 'em falconry,

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.110
and one of the first lessons I learned

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.970
that kind of carried
with me my whole life,

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.970
I've been kind of a
student of Zen philosophy,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.700
not religion or anything, just philosophy,

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.390
most of my life, and
when a 12 year old kid

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.330
has to go out and trap a wild goshawk

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:59.660
and then put him on his fist

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.290
and hold him on there with jesses

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.240
and the hawk baits off
over and over again,

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.650
you put him back on,

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:08.110
and you stay up with him all night,

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.760
until he finally falls asleep on your fist

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.810
early in the morning,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.950
and that's a real quick
way of building trust,

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.500
well the Zen master would have to ask,

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:20.391
who is getting trained here?

00:04:20.391 --> 00:04:24.107
(audience laughing)

00:04:24.107 --> 00:04:27.430
Well, climbing the hawks' nests

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:30.810
kind of led to climbing for its own sake,

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.270
and when I was 16 years old,

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.270
I drove my old '40 Ford that I overhauled

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:42.490
in auto shop class to Wyoming,

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.790
and I climbed Gannet Peak,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:45.750
the highest peak in Wyoming.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.260
That was the first mountain I climbed,

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.520
and I got pretty hooked,
and I spent the summer

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.070
in Jackson Hole and kind of learned

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.023
to rock climb,

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:02.160
and in those days if you're climbing

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.810
with Converse tennis shoes

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.340
and my first rope I stole

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:10.993
from the telephone company.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.573
It was an old manila rope.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.050
But the pitons in those days,

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.730
you know those spikes you drive

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.430
in the cracks, were made in Europe,

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.510
and they were made of soft steel,

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:30.893
and they were meant to be used just once.

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.970
The Europeans' attitude
was to conquer them,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.260
you conquer mountains, you know?

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:40.493
The conquest of Everest,
this kind of stuff,

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.680
and they felt like well,

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.010
you do a first ascent of a route,

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.710
and you leave all the pitons in place,

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.240
and it makes it easier
for the second group.

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:52.710
Well, we were kind of brought up

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:58.020
with reading John Muir
and Thoreau and Emerson

00:05:59.405 --> 00:06:01.240
and we had an attitude that you go

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.230
into the mountains but
you don't leave any trace

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:04.313
of having been there,

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:09.823
so when I was, I guess
about 18 or something,

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.040
I went out and I bought myself a forge

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.860
and an anvil and some hammers

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.603
and a book on blacksmithing.

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.990
I taught myself how to blacksmith,

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.933
and I started making
pitons out of hard steel,

00:06:23.182 --> 00:06:25.760
out of just bar stock of hard steel.

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.670
And made 'em for myself,

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:29.890
and then they worked so good,

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:32.740
because you could put 'em in
and take 'em out repeatedly,

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.370
and then I made some for friends

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:38.370
that I was climbing with,

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:40.370
and then friends of friends wanted some,

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:43.620
so then I started selling 'em.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:45.640
I could make two an hour,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.630
and I started selling 'em

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:48.263
for a dollar and a half each.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:53.910
Doesn't sound like much money,

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.250
but you gotta remember that pitons,

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.720
the European pitons were selling

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:01.340
for 15 cents each, so it
was 10 times the price,

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.920
but by that time we were doing

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:08.153
state of the art rock climbs,

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:12.710
and you had to have my pitons

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.130
if you wanted to do those climbs.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:15.360
You couldn't get up those climbs,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:18.850
and pretty soon we're starting to do

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:21.870
multi day climbs on big walls in Yosemite,

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:26.280
like El Capitan where you
spend 10 days up there,

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.600
and you couldn't possibly
carry enough pitons

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:34.210
to do the climb, so
we'd just carry like 40

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:37.920
or so pitons and use
'em over and over again,

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.920
and so I'm selling these things

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.300
out of the back of my car,

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:50.113
and I'm working, my shop was in Burbank,

00:07:53.010 --> 00:07:55.070
but I was surfing already at that time.

00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:59.453
I started surfing in
1955 I think in Malibu,

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.360
and I'd had everything portable,

00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:10.360
so I'd go down to the
beach like County Line

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:13.410
and stuff and I'd carry my 138 pound anvil

00:08:13.410 --> 00:08:14.760
down to the beach (laughs),

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:20.550
and I'd work on the beach
and get hot and sweaty,

00:08:20.550 --> 00:08:22.975
and then I'd go in and surf,

00:08:22.975 --> 00:08:25.270
and in those days you were wishing people

00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:27.120
would come by and go surfing with ya.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.390
(laughs) Believe it or not.

00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:35.869
(laughs) So anyway, I never, ever,

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.560
wanted to be a businessman,

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.010
'cause those were the days when

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:40.790
you thought businessmen were grease balls

00:08:40.790 --> 00:08:43.303
and that was the last
thing you wanted to be,

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.680
but I just happened to be a craftsman

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.200
that every time I came
back from the mountains,

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:56.200
I had more ideas for how to
improve various equipments,

00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.300
and I don't consider
myself an inventor at all.

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:05.743
I'm an innovator, and I look at any piece

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:08.580
of industrial design or something

00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.390
and I just happen to see ways of how

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.210
to make it better, so that's how

00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:20.713
I got trapped into being a businessman.

00:09:24.810 --> 00:09:28.810
The problem is, I wasn't
making any money doing this,

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.630
because I was just too idealistic.

00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.320
I mean, I'd spend thousands of dollars

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:36.453
in making some tooling and
dies and stuff like that

00:09:36.453 --> 00:09:39.730
that you're supposed to
amortize over three years,

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:42.390
and in three months I'd have a new idea

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.573
on how to improve it,

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.063
so I was kind of knocking myself off.

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:52.623
But you can't make any money doing that,

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.143
but on a climbing trip to Scotland,

00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:00.820
in the winter of, it must have been

00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:04.743
about mid 60's, I bought
myself a rugby shirt,

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:07.231
and I thought, oh, this would make

00:10:07.231 --> 00:10:09.370
a great climbing shirt,

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:11.610
because it had a really tough material.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.990
It had a collar.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.663
In those days we used
to love Off with Cracks.

00:10:16.570 --> 00:10:18.853
I mean nobody does Off
with Cracks anymore.

00:10:20.035 --> 00:10:22.280
(laughs) But it really shreds

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.483
your clothes and stuff.

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:25.860
Anyway, it had a collar,

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.030
so the gears things
wouldn't cut into your neck,

00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:33.030
and it was real colorful.

00:10:33.691 --> 00:10:36.493
It was blue and yellow and red,

00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:40.440
and in those days active
sportswear for men

00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.940
was gray sweatpants and sweatshirts.

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:44.773
That was it.

00:10:44.773 --> 00:10:47.053
Men did not wear colorful clothes,

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.020
so I started wearing this and climbing

00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:51.600
and all my friends are going, wow,

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:52.433
where'd you get that?

00:10:52.433 --> 00:10:54.891
That's really a great looking shirt.

00:10:54.891 --> 00:10:56.840
(audience laughing)

00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:59.830
So being a natural entrepreneur

00:10:59.830 --> 00:11:00.690
the lights came on

00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:03.200
and I started importing a few,

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.123
and sure enough they sold like crazy,

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:10.770
and then one of my early products

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:12.950
was a pair of shorts.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.710
I had an idea for a really
tough pair of shorts,

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:20.710
double seated, and so I made the pattern,

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:27.170
and my Korean friend, Yung Sun Sun Wu,

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:29.850
in fact, she's sitting right here,

00:11:30.970 --> 00:11:33.800
did the sewing, and we made them

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:37.560
out of a chair duck, canvas
duck that was so heavy

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:39.440
she had to use a walking foot machine

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.370
that you use for sewing

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.083
quarter inch thick leather,

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.780
and anyway she sewed 'em up,

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.810
and she put them down on the table,

00:11:48.810 --> 00:11:50.161
and they stood straight up.

00:11:50.161 --> 00:11:51.820
(audience laughing)

00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:53.143
And she was laughing,

00:11:54.690 --> 00:11:55.740
so anyway that was the beginning

00:11:55.740 --> 00:11:57.073
of our stand up shorts.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:01.763
You might say they were
hand forged shorts.

00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:07.450
Anyway, I got into making

00:12:07.450 --> 00:12:09.328
more and more clothing for climbing,

00:12:09.328 --> 00:12:14.328
and business was taking off,

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.800
but it really took off when

00:12:22.550 --> 00:12:24.110
I saw my friend Doug Tompkins,

00:12:24.110 --> 00:12:27.760
who started Esprit, and he was wearing

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:31.060
a Fila wool sweater, but it was brushed,

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.810
and it was real fuzzy, and I thought,

00:12:32.810 --> 00:12:36.370
wow, that thing would make a great thing

00:12:36.370 --> 00:12:39.110
for climbing and stuff,

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:41.130
if it was made out of synthetic.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.593
It would dry a lot more quickly.

00:12:46.160 --> 00:12:49.580
So my wife went down to the Cal Market

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:54.150
in LA where, it's the garment area,

00:12:54.150 --> 00:12:56.450
and she looked around
and found some fake fur,

00:12:59.162 --> 00:13:00.412
and you know the kind of?

00:13:01.380 --> 00:13:03.270
And she bought some and it was the stuff

00:13:03.270 --> 00:13:05.780
that you use in Kansas

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:07.780
for covering your toilet seats (laughs).

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.613
Real chic stuff.

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.560
(laughs) So we made up a jacket,

00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:21.720
and sure enough, you
could fall into a river

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:24.010
in the winter and take the thing off

00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:25.700
and shake it and all
the water would come out

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:26.533
and you'd put it back on,

00:13:26.533 --> 00:13:27.930
and it would save your life.

00:13:29.220 --> 00:13:33.150
Well, that piled jacket
evolved into Synchilla,

00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.964
which was a much more
sophisticated version,

00:13:35.964 --> 00:13:39.380
and then all of a sudden the sales

00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.160
just took off like crazy,

00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.160
because up till them I was selling stuff

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:50.569
strictly to climbers, hard core dirt bags.

00:13:50.569 --> 00:13:52.510
(audience laughing)

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:56.690
And now you got all these New Yorkers

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.800
buying this thing to wear

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:01.240
in their Gold Edition Jeep Cherokee

00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.278
to drive to their Connecticut home.

00:14:03.278 --> 00:14:06.278
(audience laughing)

00:14:08.493 --> 00:14:13.493
So (laughs) kind of in the mid eighties

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.880
we were growing the
business 40, 50% a year,

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.310
and it was just taking off,

00:14:19.310 --> 00:14:24.310
and so we were growing the business

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:28.670
by all the traditional ways.

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.930
We were opening new
dealers, wholesale accounts,

00:14:30.930 --> 00:14:33.510
and we were buying mailing lists

00:14:33.510 --> 00:14:35.730
for people who didn't request a catalog

00:14:35.730 --> 00:14:37.970
but we'd send 'em one anyway.

00:14:37.970 --> 00:14:42.020
We opened up our own retail stores,

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:44.633
and it was just going lickety split,

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:51.630
and in 1989, we had ramped up

00:14:53.850 --> 00:14:57.283
to do another 50% increase in business,

00:14:58.130 --> 00:15:01.640
and we had bought all the inventory,

00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.223
and hired tons of people,

00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:10.870
and then in 1990, a recession hit,

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:12.760
and instead of growing 50%,

00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:16.770
we only grew 20%, but
we were so strung out

00:15:16.770 --> 00:15:19.120
by growing that quickly every year

00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:22.190
that we had not cash reserves,

00:15:22.190 --> 00:15:26.030
and at the same time our bank
was going belly up itself,

00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:27.830
and wouldn't give us any more money.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:34.316
My accountant introduced me to the mafia.

00:15:34.316 --> 00:15:37.644
(laughs) Who wanted 28% interest.

00:15:37.644 --> 00:15:40.644
(audience laughing)

00:15:43.270 --> 00:15:45.133
I mean that's how desperate we were.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.283
Almost lost the business,

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:57.023
and I had to lay off 20% of our workforce,

00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:02.410
which is the worst thing I've ever had

00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:03.400
to go through in my life,

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.440
because a lot of these
people were friends,

00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.860
and it was absolutely my fault,

00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:13.960
and I swore I'd never ever wanna

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.120
be in that situation again,

00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.883
but we had to do it to save the company,

00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:24.740
and I realized that my company

00:16:28.110 --> 00:16:29.520
had become part of the problem.

00:16:29.520 --> 00:16:31.633
I was completely unsustainable.

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:36.310
And I was doing everything the way

00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.740
you're supposed to in America,

00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:42.960
grow like crazy, and so I took

00:16:42.960 --> 00:16:47.040
10 of the top people in the company,

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:50.090
and we all, even though we
couldn't hardly afford it,

00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:53.220
we all went down to the real Patagonia

00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:55.500
down in Argentina, and we walked around

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.933
in the wilderness for,

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.853
we had to walk for
about a week or 10 days,

00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:05.220
and we'd walk for half an hour

00:17:05.220 --> 00:17:07.193
and then we'd all sit down in a circle,

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:10.160
in a really nice place,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:11.950
and then we'd say, okay,

00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:14.310
why are we in business anyway?

00:17:14.310 --> 00:17:17.432
I mean none of us ever
wanted to be in business.

00:17:17.432 --> 00:17:20.073
Not one had a business degree,

00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:26.390
and we were all there for
completely different reasons

00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:27.470
than your normal business,

00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.393
and so we had to
communicate what that was.

00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:34.640
And so we started writing down

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:36.033
what our values were,

00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.840
and one of the important things

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.940
is that we wanted to make

00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.080
the best quality product.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:55.330
I mean we were coming from a background

00:17:55.330 --> 00:17:56.900
of making life saving equipment,

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.330
making the best climbing equipment

00:17:58.330 --> 00:17:59.840
in the world, and we wanted

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:01.590
to do the same thing with clothing.

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.170
It was really important that we were

00:18:04.170 --> 00:18:06.510
a product driven company,

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:09.950
and that our product was not stock.

00:18:09.950 --> 00:18:11.490
Our product was not the company

00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:12.740
that was gonna be sold someday,

00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:15.950
but our product was these tools

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:17.993
and this clothing.

00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:22.020
And we were gonna put that
in the front of the wedge

00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.480
and the whole rest of the company

00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.173
was gonna follow the product.

00:18:26.650 --> 00:18:28.350
So that was really important for us.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:30.892
We didn't wanna compromise on that,

00:18:30.892 --> 00:18:32.100
and then secondly, but,

00:18:37.340 --> 00:18:41.100
my chief designer at the time said,

00:18:41.100 --> 00:18:46.100
we can make the best
quality climbing hardware.

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:48.680
We can't make the best clothes.

00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:49.763
I said, well why not?

00:18:51.070 --> 00:18:55.420
Well, the best shirt is a Giorgio Armani

00:18:56.295 --> 00:18:59.710
handwoven Italian fabric,

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:01.490
and the buttons are hand sewn,

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.420
and it's an impeccable thing.

00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.383
It's a work of art, and it
costs 300 dollars, minimum.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.950
If we started making stuff like that,

00:19:09.950 --> 00:19:11.150
we'd be out of business.

00:19:12.460 --> 00:19:14.830
Well I said, what
happens if you throw that

00:19:14.830 --> 00:19:16.470
in a washing machine?

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:17.810
Oh, well, you can't do that.

00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:18.960
It's gotta be dry cleaned.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:21.130
I mean, it'll shrink.

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:22.143
It'll fall apart.

00:19:23.335 --> 00:19:25.130
I said, that's not very good quality.

00:19:25.130 --> 00:19:28.130
(audience laughing)

00:19:30.030 --> 00:19:35.030
So part of this book is defining

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:38.500
what we mean by quality in clothing.

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.550
We had to figure out what is quality,

00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:43.150
and what is quality for our customers

00:19:43.150 --> 00:19:44.050
and for ourselves?

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:45.953
Because we were our own customers.

00:19:47.593 --> 00:19:50.050
And then the next thing
we wanted was flex time.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:51.870
We wanted to be able to take off a month

00:19:51.870 --> 00:19:54.520
or two and go on an expedition,

00:19:54.520 --> 00:19:57.731
and do that two or three
times a year or more.

00:19:57.731 --> 00:20:01.440
(audience laughing)

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:03.405
So that's the name of the book.

00:20:03.405 --> 00:20:05.630
That's where I got the name for the book,

00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.320
'cause we've had a company policy

00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:11.560
that one of the lessons of surfing

00:20:11.560 --> 00:20:13.360
or powder skiing or any of those

00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.550
kind of sports is that you don't go

00:20:16.550 --> 00:20:18.633
surfing next Tuesday at 2 o'clock.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.220
'Cause you may show up
there and it's flat,

00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.514
or blown out, and you're a loser.

00:20:25.514 --> 00:20:28.514
(audience laughing)

00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:31.860
So we have a company policy

00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:33.130
that when the surf comes up,

00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:36.270
everybody drops their work
that is a serious surfer

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.667
and they go surfing.

00:20:37.667 --> 00:20:40.667
(audience cheering)

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:44.970
You just gotta be careful

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:48.084
you don't have 100% of
your employees surfers.

00:20:48.084 --> 00:20:53.084
(laughs) So that means you gotta hire

00:20:54.410 --> 00:20:55.910
very responsible people,

00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:57.930
and then let 'em get their work done,

00:20:57.930 --> 00:21:00.203
whenever they feel like.

00:21:00.203 --> 00:21:02.970
(audience laughing)

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:05.380
As long as it doesn't impact other people

00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:06.410
and the work gets done.

00:21:06.410 --> 00:21:07.810
I don't care when they work.

00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:12.830
The next thing is we wanted to learn

00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:15.493
the distinction between
work, play, and family.

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:19.940
Most people drag their asses to work

00:21:19.940 --> 00:21:21.960
and they can hardly wait for the weekend

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.352
and be with their family

00:21:23.352 --> 00:21:25.840
and do their sports and stuff,

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.350
so we wanted to blur
that whole distinction.

00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:31.380
In fact, for awhile there we were having

00:21:33.286 --> 00:21:37.143
young mothers come to work with the baby,

00:21:38.095 --> 00:21:39.760
the newborn baby, and babies in a box

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:41.339
on their desk.

00:21:41.339 --> 00:21:42.680
(audience laughing)

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.973
Cardboard box.

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:49.070
So we didn't wanna leave our family

00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:51.100
and disappear for eight hours a day,

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.970
and plus I've always had
a very high percentage

00:21:54.970 --> 00:21:57.200
of women working at Patagonia.

00:21:57.200 --> 00:22:00.633
We probably have I think
79% or something right now,

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:03.150
and they're in high level positions,

00:22:03.150 --> 00:22:04.840
and didn't wanna lose 'em

00:22:04.840 --> 00:22:07.450
when they got pregnant, so my wife started

00:22:07.450 --> 00:22:10.860
a childcare center, on
site childcare center,

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.060
which is one of the first ones

00:22:14.060 --> 00:22:14.995
ever in America.

00:22:14.995 --> 00:22:18.162
(audience applauding)

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:25.820
So the other thing is we wanted

00:22:25.820 --> 00:22:27.453
to be surrounded by friends,

00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:29.760
so we wanted to hire friends,

00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.580
friends of friends, and we wanted to hire

00:22:31.580 --> 00:22:33.383
passionate outdoor people,

00:22:34.270 --> 00:22:37.563
or people who had a passion for something.

00:22:38.795 --> 00:22:41.340
You know the high school kid

00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:42.880
that sits there and watches television

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.340
for six hours a day, with kind of a drool

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:46.996
coming out of the side of his mouth

00:22:46.996 --> 00:22:51.433
and their brain is more dead
than when they're sleeping.

00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:54.610
There's no hope for those kind of people.

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:58.452
I'd much rather get a young
criminal or something.

00:22:58.452 --> 00:23:01.452
(audience cheering)

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:08.480
So yeah, we wanted to be
surrounded by friends,

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:13.340
and so we wanted to hire
these kind of people

00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:14.410
and then teach 'em business,

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:16.460
rather than hire business people

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:19.710
and then try to instill a passion

00:23:19.710 --> 00:23:20.913
for the outdoors.

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:25.693
So at the same time, I kind of,

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.210
when I came back, I started writing

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:33.640
a philosophy of business,
from those values,

00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:34.920
and that's what this book is about.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.983
It's a philosophical book on
different aspects of business,

00:23:40.100 --> 00:23:43.060
and I read about 50 books on, I figured,

00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:44.880
I woke up one day and I realized, okay,

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.000
I am a businessman,

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.500
and it looks like this is
gonna be my life's work.

00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.411
I better figure out what I'm doing.

00:23:53.411 --> 00:23:55.250
(audience laughing)

00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:59.450
So I went out and read
about 50 books on business,

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:01.970
a lot of books on
Japanese management style,

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.980
which is totally different than the US.

00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:06.473
I figured they had a lot to teach us.

00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:10.240
Scandinavian style of management,

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:13.480
I mean all kinds of stuff,
just to educate myself,

00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:17.210
because I knew that we couldn't do it

00:24:17.210 --> 00:24:22.210
the usual way, and that, plus for me

00:24:22.560 --> 00:24:24.540
the only enjoyable part of business

00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.340
or the most enjoyable
part of the business,

00:24:26.340 --> 00:24:27.900
since I'm kind of a contrarian

00:24:27.900 --> 00:24:32.600
is breaking the rules,
and then making it work.

00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.650
I mean that's why it's taken me 15 years

00:24:34.650 --> 00:24:37.120
to write this book 'cause I didn't wanna

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:39.720
write a book and then go out of business,

00:24:39.720 --> 00:24:41.294
go bankrupt right away.

00:24:41.294 --> 00:24:43.180
(audience laughing)

00:24:43.180 --> 00:24:44.653
I had to make sure it works.

00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:51.930
And so then I took 15 people at a time,

00:24:51.930 --> 00:24:54.823
and we spent a week, or five days,

00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:57.620
going to different areas up in the hills

00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.350
in the Los Padres and stuff,

00:24:59.350 --> 00:25:00.360
and doing the same thing.

00:25:00.360 --> 00:25:01.950
Instead of talking about our values,

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.900
we started talking about
a philosophy of business,

00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:06.170
and I was teaching everybody

00:25:06.170 --> 00:25:11.170
in the company these philosophies,

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:13.790
and I didn't trust anybody else to do it.

00:25:13.790 --> 00:25:16.800
I figured it just had to come from me.

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:19.165
I didn't want it diluted,

00:25:19.165 --> 00:25:23.930
and I did that with every single person

00:25:23.930 --> 00:25:24.763
in the company.

00:25:26.301 --> 00:25:29.010
And now we have over a
thousand employees worldwide,

00:25:29.010 --> 00:25:31.210
and that's one reason
why I wrote this book.

00:25:32.337 --> 00:25:35.024
I'm getting burned out on this stuff.

00:25:35.024 --> 00:25:38.640
(audience laughing)

00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:43.480
Well when I was saying

00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:46.053
that we had become unsustainable,

00:25:48.030 --> 00:25:50.320
about the same time I started seeing

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.780
a lot more devastation
of the natural world,

00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.360
traveling around in Africa,

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:58.900
where I'd been there
10 or 20 years before,

00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:03.803
and I started seeing how
badly things were going,

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.960
and in this country, you go try

00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.200
to fish a stream that used to have

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:18.183
lots of fish, and now it's just a sewer.

00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:24.277
And I started thinking about another part

00:26:30.910 --> 00:26:32.460
to our mission statement.

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:33.820
Our original mission statement

00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:35.623
was make the best quality product,

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:40.510
and we always felt that
something is perfected

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:42.740
not when you can't add
anything more to it,

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:44.703
but when you can't take anything away.

00:26:45.570 --> 00:26:46.790
And it's kind of the difference between

00:26:46.790 --> 00:26:48.453
an old fashioned Cadillac,

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.750
that was so butt ugly that they had

00:26:51.750 --> 00:26:54.410
to put all kinds of chrome breasts on it

00:26:54.410 --> 00:26:56.640
and stuff, you know?

00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:58.750
Compared to a Ferrari in those days,

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:00.520
it didn't have any chrome on it.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.380
I mean, it was just those beautiful lines,

00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:05.410
and so that's always been our philosophy,

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:09.030
but then I thought we needed another part

00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:09.900
to our mission statement,

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:12.280
because really getting concerned

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:16.160
about the natural world,
and I was very concerned

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:17.580
about never having a company

00:27:17.580 --> 00:27:19.660
that was unsustainable again,

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.100
so we added in the second part,

00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:26.203
which says cause no unnecessary harm,

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.790
and it doesn't say cause no harm,

00:27:28.790 --> 00:27:33.790
because there's no way you can ever

00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:37.320
manufacture a product
without causing harm.

00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:41.270
And according to the second
law of thermodynamics,

00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:44.160
entropy, you basically end up

00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:47.839
with probably more waste
than you end up with

00:27:47.839 --> 00:27:49.483
in the final product.

00:27:51.010 --> 00:27:54.370
There's no such thing as sustainability.

00:27:54.370 --> 00:27:56.080
There's a beginning and end to everything,

00:27:56.080 --> 00:27:57.793
as any Buddhist will tell ya.

00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:04.020
And the only sustainability

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:06.710
that I know if, the only
thing that comes close

00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.080
to sustainability is probably

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:12.300
hunting and gathering
on a very small scale.

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.580
The only economic activity

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:19.283
is probably organically grown agriculture,

00:28:21.405 --> 00:28:23.030
'cause the energy comes from the sun,

00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:24.250
and the sun is free,

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.960
but everything else causes
an incredible amount

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.133
of waste and pollution,

00:28:30.370 --> 00:28:35.370
but climbing in Yosemite taught me

00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:38.570
an important lesson, another Zen lesson,

00:28:38.570 --> 00:28:42.390
that what's important is not the end goal,

00:28:42.390 --> 00:28:45.782
like in Zen archery, you
don't focus on the target.

00:28:45.782 --> 00:28:48.410
You spend years learning how to do

00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:51.260
all the different movements
and shooting an arrow,

00:28:51.260 --> 00:28:53.130
until finally you
perfect all the movements

00:28:53.130 --> 00:28:54.870
that then you can hit the bullseye

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:55.970
with your eyes closed.

00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:02.250
And climbing in Yosemite,
you do a 10 day climb

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:05.060
on El Capitan and you get to the top,

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:05.893
and guess what?

00:29:05.893 --> 00:29:06.743
There's nothing there.

00:29:07.693 --> 00:29:08.526
(audience laughing)

00:29:08.526 --> 00:29:09.653
It's just flat up there.

00:29:12.177 --> 00:29:15.623
So what's important is how you climb.

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.423
And if you compromise the process,

00:29:21.830 --> 00:29:24.073
I think compromise is
the work of the devil.

00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:28.430
Somehow we've, in government particularly,

00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:30.580
they love compromise.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.040
Compromise is Solomon
cutting the baby in half

00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:36.170
and giving half a baby to each mother,

00:29:36.170 --> 00:29:38.563
who's worrying over whose baby it was.

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.337
So (laughs) I don't know how I got

00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:50.299
carried away on that one.

00:29:50.299 --> 00:29:52.896
(audience laughing)

00:29:52.896 --> 00:29:57.896
(laughs) I always felt
that a responsible farmer

00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:03.995
leaves the land in better shape

00:30:03.995 --> 00:30:06.150
than when he received it.

00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:08.380
The forester doesn't just clear cut

00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:10.073
and then plant a monocrop,

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:13.570
but takes just what's needed

00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:14.810
to keep the forest healthy

00:30:14.810 --> 00:30:19.810
and then leaves trees
for the next generation,

00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:23.630
and then a responsible government

00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:27.760
makes its decisions on the society

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.700
being here at least seven generations

00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:34.570
into the future, instead
of one or two years.

00:30:34.570 --> 00:30:36.300
But somehow business is exempt

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:38.603
from that responsibility.

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.410
American style of business
is you're supposed

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:43.940
to grow this business as fast

00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:45.930
as you possibly can.

00:30:45.930 --> 00:30:47.070
You don't have to make a profit.

00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:48.410
You just show lots of growth,

00:30:48.410 --> 00:30:50.810
so that you can have an IPO,

00:30:50.810 --> 00:30:53.173
sell a bunch of stock to some suckers,

00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:58.910
and then you retire to seize your world

00:30:58.910 --> 00:31:00.710
and play golf the rest of your life.

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:09.750
Well, I don't believe that is right.

00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.480
I always felt that if the farmer

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.370
has this responsibility, well so do I,

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:18.490
as an owner of a company.

00:31:18.490 --> 00:31:22.980
And so we decided to put our company

00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:25.090
in a path to where we would be here

00:31:25.090 --> 00:31:26.770
a hundred years from now,

00:31:26.770 --> 00:31:31.103
so all the decisions made
are for the long term,

00:31:36.253 --> 00:31:39.753
which means we can't grow 15% a year,

00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:44.470
because one time at an all company meeting

00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:47.430
I started putting a one
and a bunch of zeroes

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.560
on butcher paper all around the room,

00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.180
and I said, this is how big we're gonna be

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:57.230
if we continue growing at 40% a year

00:31:57.230 --> 00:31:58.693
for the next 40 years.

00:31:59.614 --> 00:32:01.860
It was a bazillion dollars.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:04.070
I mean, it was so ridiculous

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:05.123
you can't believe it,

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:11.660
and so we decided to
grow at a natural growth,

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.650
so natural growth means that

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:22.980
when the customer tells you that

00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:27.989
they're frustrated in buying your stuff.

00:32:27.989 --> 00:32:29.610
They just got the catalog

00:32:29.610 --> 00:32:31.580
and you're already sold out,

00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:34.530
that you need to make more,

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.290
but we don't advertise on inner city buses

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:41.990
to try to get gang kids to
buy our black down jackets

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.723
instead of Timerland or North Face.

00:32:46.380 --> 00:32:49.130
The reason we got in the
trouble in the first place

00:32:49.130 --> 00:32:52.160
is that with this Synchilla

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:55.430
we were selling stuff to people

00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:58.213
who wanted it but didn't need it.

00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.763
Whenever you're in that situation,

00:33:02.670 --> 00:33:04.373
you're a victim of the economy.

00:33:05.307 --> 00:33:07.172
The economy is gonna go up and down,

00:33:07.172 --> 00:33:08.005
and you're gonna go up and down

00:33:08.005 --> 00:33:11.630
like a yo yo, and particular
if you really follow

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:13.700
the fashion trends,

00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.433
and then you're really
in a scary situation.

00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:22.940
So we made a lot of decisions then

00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:27.380
to try to be here a
hundred years from now,

00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:32.270
and from then on, we
controlled our growth,

00:33:32.270 --> 00:33:35.433
and we put ourselves,

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:38.350
I mean you could call it

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:40.410
a path towards sustainability.

00:33:40.410 --> 00:33:43.423
It's the process towards
sustainability that counts,

00:33:45.687 --> 00:33:48.520
and we also accepted the fact

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:50.163
that you can't have it all.

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:55.650
And very few businesses will accept that.

00:33:55.650 --> 00:33:58.080
We turn away business all the time.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.790
I mean, our advertising budget

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.940
is one half of one percent of sales,

00:34:04.940 --> 00:34:08.653
which is nothing in our kind of business.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.560
We want people to come to us.

00:34:11.560 --> 00:34:13.560
We want to have loyal customers

00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.340
who tell their friends,

00:34:15.340 --> 00:34:19.400
and then if we grow 3%, 4% a year,

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.560
we can be very profitable at that,

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:22.793
and that's fine.

00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:26.230
I could call Nordstrom's tomorrow

00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:29.260
and probably get a five
million dollar order

00:34:29.260 --> 00:34:30.550
out of them or something like that,

00:34:30.550 --> 00:34:33.783
but that would put us on a suicide course.

00:34:34.730 --> 00:34:37.010
I've always believed that
there's a proper size

00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:38.790
for any endeavor,

00:34:38.790 --> 00:34:42.450
and I think there's a proper size

00:34:42.450 --> 00:34:43.673
for my company.

00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:50.560
I use kind of a metaphor to show

00:34:51.980 --> 00:34:53.410
for what we were trying to do,

00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:56.083
which is make the best product and stuff,

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.240
imagine a little French restaurant

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.420
that spends 10 years in getting

00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.640
their first Michelin star,

00:35:05.640 --> 00:35:07.490
another 10 years to get their second,

00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.680
and then 25 years,
they've been in business,

00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:12.980
they finally get their
third Michelin star,

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.720
and they're one of the 10 best restaurants

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.750
in the world, and then they say, okay,

00:35:17.750 --> 00:35:20.403
we've made it, so now
let's put in 50 tables.

00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.050
Well there are no three
star French restaurants

00:35:24.050 --> 00:35:25.420
with 50 tables.

00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:27.330
It's impossible.

00:35:27.330 --> 00:35:32.330
In Japan, the very best
restaurants in Japan

00:35:34.100 --> 00:35:38.775
like in Kyoto, it costs you $450,

00:35:38.775 --> 00:35:40.133
$500 to eat there.

00:35:42.050 --> 00:35:44.010
The size is dictated by the fact

00:35:44.010 --> 00:35:47.260
that the chef is the owner,

00:35:47.260 --> 00:35:51.530
'cause you can't hire a chef.

00:35:51.530 --> 00:35:53.060
Only the owner has the passion

00:35:53.060 --> 00:35:57.000
to really have one of
these great restaurants,

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.390
and the size of the restaurant

00:35:59.390 --> 00:36:01.720
has to be so that the chef is cooking

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.483
and is waiting on the
customer at the same time,

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:08.900
so he has to see his
customers right there,

00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:09.860
so they're tiny.

00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:10.963
They're very small.

00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:16.170
So for what we wanna do, for our values,

00:36:16.170 --> 00:36:17.670
we can't have a large company.

00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:22.513
We have to start hiring
more and more MBAs,

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:25.750
which we don't wanna do.

00:36:34.090 --> 00:36:36.100
Anyway, we got out of the crisis,

00:36:36.100 --> 00:36:38.240
and we've been doing
pretty well ever since.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:42.850
In fact, the other value
that we wanted to have

00:36:42.850 --> 00:36:44.080
was to get out of debt.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.483
I didn't wanna ever
deal with bankers again,

00:36:48.090 --> 00:36:51.070
and we're pretty close to that right now,

00:36:51.070 --> 00:36:56.070
but the last philosophy
that I kind of wrote

00:36:57.590 --> 00:36:58.770
was fairly recently,

00:36:58.770 --> 00:37:01.350
and it's our environmental philosophy,

00:37:01.350 --> 00:37:06.043
and I think it applies to a business,

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:08.993
or to individuals.

00:37:09.899 --> 00:37:11.990
You can think of it as something

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:13.060
that you could do yourself,

00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:17.930
because if you're an alcoholic,

00:37:17.930 --> 00:37:21.320
you have to confront yourself and say,

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:25.460
I am an alcoholic before anything happens

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.500
to stop drinking.

00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:31.500
I mean, we just admit
that we're polluters.

00:37:32.010 --> 00:37:35.970
We're using up non renewable resources,

00:37:35.970 --> 00:37:38.440
and we're making consumer products,

00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.180
and we're part of the problem.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:44.220
So we're trying to be on the process

00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:46.030
of minimizing the damage we do,

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:49.763
and we have a five step
program for doing that.

00:37:53.060 --> 00:37:56.740
The number one is to
lead an examined life.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:37:58.610
I think most of the damage caused

00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:02.840
to the environment and to nature

00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.950
is caused unintentionally,

00:38:04.950 --> 00:38:08.210
and it's just from all of
us just blundering along

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:11.193
not questioning what we do.

00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.163
If you wanna feed your
family healthy food,

00:38:21.010 --> 00:38:22.910
you gotta know where it comes from, right?

00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:24.630
You can't just go to the supermarket

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.670
and buy vegetables.

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:30.590
I mean, the tomatoes
might come from Mexico,

00:38:30.590 --> 00:38:32.020
where they still use DDT,

00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:34.270
or we're still using

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:36.090
all kinds of different pesticides

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:37.890
on our vegetables here,

00:38:37.890 --> 00:38:39.273
so you gotta know.

00:38:39.273 --> 00:38:40.890
Sometimes you gotta know the farmer,

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.970
or you gotta, so it's the same thing

00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:48.583
if you wanna kind of clean up your act,

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.040
you gotta lead an examined life,

00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:53.740
and for us in the clothing business,

00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:58.083
this means asking a lot of questions.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:04.477
Toyota has a management technique

00:39:08.810 --> 00:39:13.773
that they use to solve problems.

00:39:14.976 --> 00:39:17.670
If our government used this technique,

00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:18.970
you'd see a big difference,

00:39:18.970 --> 00:39:22.340
but they say government is not interested

00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.850
in solving problems.

00:39:23.850 --> 00:39:25.393
It just rearranges them and.

00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.980
(audience laughing)

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:33.980
So okay, so we started an
environmental assessment program,

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.370
and we hired some people

00:39:36.370 --> 00:39:38.070
to start asking these questions.

00:39:38.070 --> 00:39:41.080
So one of the first questions we asked is

00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.880
of all the fibers used in making clothing,

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.400
which are the most damaging,

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.050
and which are the least damaging?

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:50.790
Well there's no books on this stuff,

00:39:50.790 --> 00:39:52.940
and it takes a long time
to find some answers,

00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:57.443
but finally we find out
that, of all the fibers,

00:39:58.513 --> 00:39:59.900
at first we thought, oh,

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:01.090
it's gotta be synthetics.

00:40:01.090 --> 00:40:02.550
That stuff is, I mean they were made

00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:04.360
out of petroleum and stuff.

00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:06.530
But we find out that
the most damaging fiber

00:40:06.530 --> 00:40:08.783
by far is 100% pure cotton.

00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:11.500
Those beautiful little cotton balls

00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:14.520
on babies' skins that you see in ads,

00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:16.170
that's the worst.

00:40:16.170 --> 00:40:18.580
In fact, it probably uses more petroleum

00:40:18.580 --> 00:40:20.793
than making synthetics,

00:40:23.570 --> 00:40:26.793
because all our
agriculture uses petroleum.

00:40:26.793 --> 00:40:28.500
I have a fact in the book here

00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.920
that I got out of National Geographic.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.730
It takes eight barrels of petroleum

00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:33.347
to produce one cow (laughs).

00:40:37.230 --> 00:40:41.810
So anyway, the reason
industrially grown cotton

00:40:41.810 --> 00:40:44.780
is so bad is that it uses 25%

00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.820
of the world's pesticides
and insecticides,

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:51.763
and only occupies 3% of
the world's farmland.

00:40:53.990 --> 00:40:57.686
And some of these chemicals are so toxic

00:40:57.686 --> 00:41:01.250
that they cost $500 a gallon,

00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:03.550
and in some areas of the world,

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:05.920
they spray the fields as much as 20 times

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.210
in the season, so I took a little trip

00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:11.160
to the Central Valley,
the San Joaquin Valley

00:41:11.160 --> 00:41:14.210
here and went to some cotton fields,

00:41:14.210 --> 00:41:16.113
and boy it was an education.

00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:18.723
It was a real eye opener.

00:41:19.961 --> 00:41:21.580
I mean they're killing fields.

00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:23.633
There's nothing out there that's alive.

00:41:24.610 --> 00:41:26.690
There's no birds, there's no insects.

00:41:26.690 --> 00:41:28.620
There's no weeds.

00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:30.210
There's just these little canals

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:34.750
of toxic water, and the cancer rate's

00:41:34.750 --> 00:41:35.680
10 times normal.

00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.860
There's crop dusters flying over

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.913
right over the workers, doesn't matter.

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:45.960
And there's no outlet to
that San Joaquin Valley.

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:48.790
There's no river that goes to the ocean,

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:51.350
so all of that flows out into lower areas

00:41:51.350 --> 00:41:54.980
and creates these huge
ponds, like Kesterson.

00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:56.984
You've probably heard of that.

00:41:56.984 --> 00:41:58.810
And then they hire these guys

00:41:58.810 --> 00:42:00.610
to sit on lawn chairs with shotguns

00:42:00.610 --> 00:42:03.183
and keep the water fowl from landing,

00:42:04.030 --> 00:42:09.030
so that they don't have
chicks with three beaks

00:42:11.260 --> 00:42:15.110
and four legs and stuff like that.

00:42:15.110 --> 00:42:17.833
And I came back and I said okay,

00:42:17.833 --> 00:42:19.760
(laughs) I don't wanna be in business.

00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.790
I didn't wanna be in
business in the first place,

00:42:21.790 --> 00:42:24.880
but I really don't wanna be in business

00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:27.250
if I have to use
industrially grown cotton,

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:30.083
and cotton was 20% of our sales,

00:42:30.930 --> 00:42:32.363
and I said I don't care.

00:42:33.690 --> 00:42:34.600
I'm not gonna do this.

00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:37.200
It's kind of like you have a company,

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:39.050
you're one of the best
employers in America,

00:42:39.050 --> 00:42:42.670
you're hiring people and
you give 'em great benefits,

00:42:42.670 --> 00:42:44.223
but you're making landmines.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:47.340
But you're making great landmines,

00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.468
the highest quality landmines.

00:42:49.468 --> 00:42:51.430
(audience laughing)

00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:52.700
And you go to Cambodia and you see

00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:53.890
all these people walking around

00:42:53.890 --> 00:42:55.680
with one arm, one leg,
and you see the results

00:42:55.680 --> 00:42:59.213
of your landmines, and so,

00:43:01.550 --> 00:43:03.160
so I gave the company two years

00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:06.390
to get out of making anything

00:43:06.390 --> 00:43:08.830
out of industrially grown cotton,

00:43:08.830 --> 00:43:13.830
and you don't just call
your fabric supplier,

00:43:16.090 --> 00:43:18.160
you say oh, you know,

00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.800
that 10,000 yards of shirting

00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.370
I ordered last week,

00:43:21.370 --> 00:43:23.223
switch that to organically grown.

00:43:24.523 --> 00:43:29.090
(laughs) A few companies had tried

00:43:29.090 --> 00:43:30.447
using organic cotton.

00:43:30.447 --> 00:43:33.600
Esprit tried it, Vanity Fair tried it,

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:35.030
but what they did is they tried

00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:36.850
a little separate line,

00:43:36.850 --> 00:43:41.350
and they figured that
well, if this takes off,

00:43:41.350 --> 00:43:43.250
then we'll grow it, and if it doesn't,

00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.670
we got our regular business going,

00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:48.560
so they weren't really
committed like I was.

00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:50.970
I just told the company, that's it.

00:43:50.970 --> 00:43:52.583
Either we make this work,

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:56.740
or we're never gonna use cotton again.

00:43:56.740 --> 00:43:59.860
And so it mobilized the entire company,

00:43:59.860 --> 00:44:02.443
and I've never seen the
company do better work.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.940
And they were all, everybody
went to the Central Valley.

00:44:06.940 --> 00:44:08.520
They all saw this, they came back,

00:44:08.520 --> 00:44:10.270
they were all absolutely committed,

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:15.550
and we started talking to organic farmers

00:44:15.550 --> 00:44:18.970
and sometimes cosigning their loans

00:44:18.970 --> 00:44:20.630
so that they could get
a loan from the bank

00:44:20.630 --> 00:44:22.540
'cause the bank wouldn't
loan 'em any money

00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:24.820
if they grew organically.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:29.110
We had to go to find a gin

00:44:29.110 --> 00:44:30.460
that would process our cotton,

00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:35.460
'cause the gin separates the
seed from the cotton ball,

00:44:35.890 --> 00:44:37.300
and these gins are just dripping

00:44:37.300 --> 00:44:38.490
with cotton seed oil,

00:44:38.490 --> 00:44:39.810
and the oil is where

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:43.484
all the chemicals are concentrated.

00:44:43.484 --> 00:44:48.157
One of the chemicals is Agent Orange,

00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:52.890
'cause they use that
to defoliate the plants

00:44:52.890 --> 00:44:55.060
so the mechanical pickers can pick.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.730
Well anyway, cotton seed
oil is not regulated

00:44:57.730 --> 00:44:58.863
by the FDA.

00:45:00.150 --> 00:45:02.610
Somehow they've got it so that

00:45:02.610 --> 00:45:05.233
they don't have to worry about that.

00:45:06.090 --> 00:45:09.660
And check out your chips someday.

00:45:09.660 --> 00:45:11.250
If there's any cottonseed oil in there,

00:45:11.250 --> 00:45:15.530
don't eat it, and then
they feed the cottonseeds,

00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:18.380
after they press the
oil out to the cattle,

00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:20.180
so you're getting that in your beef,

00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:24.614
anyway, we can't run.

00:45:24.614 --> 00:45:28.078
(audience laughing)

00:45:28.078 --> 00:45:30.591
(laughs)

00:45:30.591 --> 00:45:33.576
(audience applauding)

00:45:33.576 --> 00:45:36.390
We can't very well run our organic cotton

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:39.200
through this gin without
convincing the guy

00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.350
to clean it first, and then we get

00:45:41.350 --> 00:45:45.130
to the spinner who makes
the yarn and stuff,

00:45:45.130 --> 00:45:47.180
makes the fiber,

00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.830
and he doesn't wanna deal with us,

00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:50.480
because our stuff is coming in

00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:53.653
with seeds and stems and sticks,

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:58.680
little pieces of leaves,

00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.140
because we didn't use defoliant.

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:05.540
The farmer had to do it in a natural way,

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:07.270
kind of starve the plant for water,

00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:09.520
just at the right time
of the year and stuff,

00:46:10.730 --> 00:46:13.400
so I can tell you that

00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:15.650
it wasn't easy switching over,

00:46:15.650 --> 00:46:16.960
but we did it, and we found

00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.900
a few good partners, and we convinced 'em

00:46:20.900 --> 00:46:23.373
that this was gonna be the future,

00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:28.117
and we made it work, and.

00:46:28.117 --> 00:46:31.284
(audience applauding)

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.740
But that's only one question.

00:46:39.740 --> 00:46:42.400
We're supposed to ask five questions.

00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.980
So then we said okay,
well what are we gonna do,

00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:45.980
how about the dyes

00:46:47.741 --> 00:46:48.574
that you use for dying cotton?

00:46:48.574 --> 00:46:50.210
I mean, we never had to worry about this,

00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:54.060
'cause we just call a fabric supplier,

00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:55.240
and he'd come with a big book,

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:56.470
and we'd look at all these different

00:46:56.470 --> 00:46:57.950
prints and fabrics and say, oh yeah,

00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:59.980
give me this, give me that.

00:46:59.980 --> 00:47:01.750
So how about dyes?

00:47:01.750 --> 00:47:06.750
So we tried to find out
if these dyes are toxic.

00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:09.120
Well nobody wants to tell you,

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.030
and nobody even knows.

00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:12.770
The people making the dyes haven't even

00:47:12.770 --> 00:47:13.793
asked the question.

00:47:14.980 --> 00:47:16.540
Well finally we find out, yeah,

00:47:16.540 --> 00:47:18.960
this stuff's toxic, but there's a company

00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:21.710
in West Germany that makes cotton dyes

00:47:22.810 --> 00:47:26.210
that are non toxic,
except one color is toxic,

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:29.410
so okay, so we don't do that color.

00:47:29.410 --> 00:47:31.400
Okay, that's two questions.

00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:34.620
Well, where are they gonna dye this stuff?

00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.300
Is a big outfall going into a river

00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:38.850
from the dye house?

00:47:38.850 --> 00:47:40.760
So we sent somebody over to Portugal,

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:42.694
'cause we're gonna make flannel shirts

00:47:42.694 --> 00:47:45.210
out of 'em, so they go there

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:48.339
and sure enough, here's
all these dye houses

00:47:48.339 --> 00:47:52.360
on this river that goes
into Porto in Portugal,

00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.370
huge river, big outfall pipes

00:47:55.370 --> 00:47:56.720
going right into the river.

00:47:57.890 --> 00:48:00.670
But the last dye house

00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:02.370
down at the mouth of the river

00:48:02.370 --> 00:48:05.070
can't use the water 'cause it's jet black,

00:48:05.070 --> 00:48:08.940
so they bought all this fancy machinery

00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:12.860
to clean the water so they can use it,

00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:15.500
so they clean it, and
then they dye their stuff,

00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.770
and then they run it back
through the machinery again,

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:20.330
and it comes out pure into the river.

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:21.790
So there you go.

00:48:21.790 --> 00:48:23.223
Now we got a choice.

00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.683
Education leaves you choices.

00:48:27.690 --> 00:48:31.232
The uneducated person has no choices.

00:48:31.232 --> 00:48:33.013
He's gotta go through life like this.

00:48:34.370 --> 00:48:35.203
So anyway,

00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:45.080
so then one more question,

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:50.080
well what's gonna happen
to this cotton clothing

00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:53.010
when the customer is all done with it?

00:48:53.010 --> 00:48:55.300
I mean, we should be
responsible for that product

00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.783
all the way from birth
till death, and beyond.

00:49:01.080 --> 00:49:03.760
I feel a company should be responsible

00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:05.020
not only for the product,

00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.053
but for how the product is made.

00:49:08.070 --> 00:49:12.283
And so cotton, when you're done with it,

00:49:14.730 --> 00:49:19.730
if you bought a pair of bell bottom pants,

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:21.770
and suddenly they're out of fashion,

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:24.360
you throw 'em away, right?

00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:26.130
Or you give them to Salvation Army

00:49:26.130 --> 00:49:28.240
and then 15 years later

00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:29.730
it comes back into fashion,

00:49:29.730 --> 00:49:32.841
and people are rushing to buy 'em again,

00:49:32.841 --> 00:49:37.841
so that was a problem, so
we were absolutely committed

00:49:39.078 --> 00:49:43.790
to not putting fashion
into our sportswear.

00:49:43.790 --> 00:49:45.800
If the collar points are five inches long,

00:49:45.800 --> 00:49:47.060
well we don't make 'em five inches.

00:49:47.060 --> 00:49:48.980
We do 'em three inches,

00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:50.280
so that they're never in fashion,

00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:51.942
never out of fashion.

00:49:51.942 --> 00:49:53.780
(audience laughing)

00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:58.780
And the difference
between a Hawaiian shirt

00:49:58.970 --> 00:50:02.540
that you can buy at a
vintage Hawaiian shirt store

00:50:02.540 --> 00:50:05.420
for $300 and one that's 50 cents

00:50:05.420 --> 00:50:09.680
at the Salvation Army,
they're both Hawaiian shirts,

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.440
but one is classic.

00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:14.374
One never goes out of style,

00:50:14.374 --> 00:50:17.620
and the patterns line up,

00:50:17.620 --> 00:50:21.180
and there's a big
difference between the two,

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.210
so we realized that the
most important thing

00:50:23.210 --> 00:50:26.400
we could do is to try to make

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:29.023
the clothes last as long as possible.

00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:33.100
And not go in and out of fashion,

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:37.600
because we're responsible for 'em,

00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:38.850
but I can tell ya

00:50:41.670 --> 00:50:43.920
one thing that's just
happened very recently,

00:50:45.650 --> 00:50:48.350
that is really exciting,

00:50:48.350 --> 00:50:49.830
it's the most exciting
thing that's happened

00:50:49.830 --> 00:50:51.280
in the company in a long time,

00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:55.630
we've partnered with a Japanese mill

00:50:55.630 --> 00:50:57.270
that's just spent 100 million dollars

00:50:57.270 --> 00:51:00.370
in a recycling plant,

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:02.580
where they're gonna recycle polyester.

00:51:02.580 --> 00:51:05.500
Now we've been making
40 different products,

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.920
all our fleece and stuff,

00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:09.833
made out of recycled soda pop bottles,

00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:13.820
but when you're done with those products,

00:51:13.820 --> 00:51:15.830
and they're all worn out,

00:51:15.830 --> 00:51:16.800
you throw them away,

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:19.300
but now we're telling our customers

00:51:19.300 --> 00:51:21.610
that when you're done with
your Capilene underwear

00:51:21.610 --> 00:51:23.090
which is polyester,

00:51:23.090 --> 00:51:27.064
you bring it back to us and wash it first.

00:51:27.064 --> 00:51:29.200
(audience laughing)

00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.767
Especially the thongs (laughs).

00:51:33.052 --> 00:51:38.052
And then we're gonna

00:51:38.467 --> 00:51:40.070
bundle that stuff up,

00:51:40.070 --> 00:51:41.983
and we're gonna send it back to Japan,

00:51:42.822 --> 00:51:45.900
and all the ships going back to Japan

00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:47.027
are empty anyway.

00:51:47.027 --> 00:51:49.940
(audience laughing)

00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:54.220
So the shipping rates are really low.

00:51:54.220 --> 00:51:57.720
We've calculated all the energy usage,

00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:58.880
and it's gonna go to this plant,

00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:01.070
and they're gonna melt this stuff down,

00:52:01.070 --> 00:52:04.160
and take it to it's original polymer,

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.350
and then make fiber,

00:52:05.350 --> 00:52:06.320
and then we're gonna make

00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:08.170
more underwear out of it,

00:52:08.170 --> 00:52:09.920
so we're gonna complete the circle,

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:12.353
what Bill McDonough
calls cradle to cradle,

00:52:13.947 --> 00:52:16.290
and it's never been done with clothing,

00:52:16.290 --> 00:52:19.140
and we're starting with
our Capilene underwear,

00:52:19.140 --> 00:52:22.260
and we're gonna be eventually doing it

00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:23.990
with all our polyester,

00:52:23.990 --> 00:52:27.270
and we just designed a pair of surf trunks

00:52:27.270 --> 00:52:29.960
that instead of nylon, it's polyester,

00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:32.290
with a view towards a
couple years from now

00:52:32.290 --> 00:52:34.880
we'll be able to do the
same thing with that.

00:52:34.880 --> 00:52:38.420
We're making one shell
that's all polyester,

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.130
and we're working with another factory

00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:43.960
that's gonna do the same thing

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:47.260
with nylon 6, so we're used to

00:52:47.260 --> 00:52:49.073
recycling aluminum cans,

00:52:50.270 --> 00:52:52.850
and making more aluminum cans.

00:52:52.850 --> 00:52:53.930
When you buy an automobile,

00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:56.840
95% of the steel in that automobile

00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:58.413
comes from another automobile,

00:52:59.610 --> 00:53:03.170
and so now we're gonna
do it with clothing,

00:53:03.170 --> 00:53:08.170
and right now probably the least damaging

00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:10.470
clothes you can buy are fiber

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:12.970
that you can make clothes
out of is probably hemp,

00:53:17.300 --> 00:53:19.660
but I can see that soon it'll

00:53:19.660 --> 00:53:22.050
probably be polyester, and nylon 6,

00:53:22.050 --> 00:53:23.940
because in the process,

00:53:23.940 --> 00:53:27.180
we only lose 5% of the material,

00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:30.180
and it only takes 20% of the energy

00:53:30.180 --> 00:53:33.130
to make a new product
from the old product,

00:53:33.130 --> 00:53:35.193
then if you made petroleum.

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:40.840
So anyway, I hope we're not all wearing

00:53:40.840 --> 00:53:43.853
these red leisure polyester
suits someday, but.

00:53:44.690 --> 00:53:47.690
(audience laughing)

00:53:50.666 --> 00:53:54.087
So anyway, the second
part of my five steps

00:53:55.390 --> 00:53:56.640
is to clean up your act.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.240
After you've educated yourself,

00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.323
then act on it.

00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:02.740
And then the third part is

00:54:02.740 --> 00:54:04.961
we're always gonna be polluters,

00:54:04.961 --> 00:54:07.340
and we're always gonna be consumers.

00:54:07.340 --> 00:54:08.520
We're not citizens anymore.

00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.190
We're consumers.

00:54:10.190 --> 00:54:12.900
It's not the government that wants

00:54:12.900 --> 00:54:14.580
or oil companies that wanted

00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:16.870
to drill in the Arctic
National Wildlife Refuge.

00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:17.703
It's us.

00:54:17.703 --> 00:54:18.536
We're the ones.

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:23.390
And so, we're never gonna be perfect,

00:54:23.390 --> 00:54:25.610
so we gotta do some penance,

00:54:25.610 --> 00:54:29.150
so that's where we take 1% of our sales,

00:54:29.150 --> 00:54:30.770
it's not 1% of profits.

00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:32.743
It's 1% of our total sales,

00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:36.330
and we give that away to organizations

00:54:36.330 --> 00:54:38.293
that are doing some good.

00:54:39.810 --> 00:54:42.440
Since the mid 80's we've given away

00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.333
about 22 million dollars,

00:54:45.930 --> 00:54:47.688
and what we do is.

00:54:47.688 --> 00:54:50.855
(audience applauding)

00:54:55.810 --> 00:54:57.707
Well that's a lot of your money.

00:54:57.707 --> 00:54:59.833
(laughs) Thank you.

00:55:01.457 --> 00:55:04.350
(audience laughing)

00:55:04.350 --> 00:55:06.400
What we do with it is we give it away

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:07.600
to environmental causes,

00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:09.030
and people ask us why we don't give

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:10.373
to social causes.

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:14.340
Well, I think if you start asking

00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:17.320
the five questions with any cause,

00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:20.000
with any problem in the world,

00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:21.600
you'll get down to the real cause

00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.183
is an environmental cause,

00:55:24.670 --> 00:55:28.160
whether it's the hurricane in New Orleans

00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:31.080
or poverty in Africa and genocide,

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:35.960
it's all, if you ask enough questions,

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.930
it gets down to us destroying our planet,

00:55:39.930 --> 00:55:43.500
and government is not
interested in causes.

00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:45.600
They're interested in working on symptoms.

00:55:48.200 --> 00:55:49.940
One out of eight women in this room

00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:52.130
are gonna get breast cancer,

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:54.840
and that's up from one in forty

00:55:54.840 --> 00:55:55.673
in World War II,

00:55:57.010 --> 00:55:58.973
so you can't tell me it's genetics.

00:55:59.930 --> 00:56:01.840
It has to have some environmental cause,

00:56:01.840 --> 00:56:04.640
and yet I've found out
in writing this book

00:56:04.640 --> 00:56:06.960
that only 3% of the monies

00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.660
that go to breast cancer research

00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:11.150
go to trying to find environmental causes

00:56:11.150 --> 00:56:12.840
of breast cancer.

00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:15.363
All the rest goes to finding cures.

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:22.770
Well, (laughs) your average house

00:56:22.770 --> 00:56:26.060
has 5,000 toxic chemicals, most of which

00:56:26.060 --> 00:56:27.050
haven't been tested

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.890
to see if they give you cancer.

00:56:28.890 --> 00:56:32.400
There's only been under
a thousand chemicals

00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:33.233
that have been tested

00:56:33.233 --> 00:56:34.710
to see if they give you cancer.

00:56:36.010 --> 00:56:39.140
So you can give money to
breast cancer research,

00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:42.300
but give it to organizations
that are working

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.410
on stopping the use of these pesticides

00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:46.111
and these toxic chemicals.

00:56:46.111 --> 00:56:49.278
(audience applauding)

00:56:53.540 --> 00:56:58.270
So of the powerful forces in our society,

00:56:58.270 --> 00:56:59.820
whether it's federal government

00:57:01.669 --> 00:57:03.650
and state government, local governments,

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:05.450
there's one that's more
powerful than any of them,

00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:06.963
and that's civil democracy,

00:57:08.310 --> 00:57:12.430
and that's who we give our money to,

00:57:12.430 --> 00:57:16.550
is 30,000 activist organizations

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:18.973
working on environmental
causes in America.

00:57:20.587 --> 00:57:23.280
Think about this country was started,

00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:24.830
a bunch of activists dumped some tea

00:57:24.830 --> 00:57:26.083
in Boston Harbor.

00:57:29.490 --> 00:57:32.210
People say, well Lincoln freed the slaves.

00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:35.840
Well, Lincoln just wanted to keep

00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.330
the Union together, really.

00:57:37.330 --> 00:57:39.920
The slaves were being
encourage to flee the South

00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:42.340
through the Underground Railroad

00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:44.840
funded by Northern philanthropists,

00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:45.973
a bunch of activists.

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:49.490
And on Civil Rights legislation,

00:57:49.490 --> 00:57:50.673
it wasn't Johnson.

00:57:52.010 --> 00:57:54.530
It was Rosa Parks, a senior citizen,

00:57:54.530 --> 00:57:56.510
refused to get off a bus,

00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:58.590
and little black kids refused to go

00:57:58.590 --> 00:58:00.740
to segregated schools.

00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:04.569
Women's suffrage, Vietnam,

00:58:04.569 --> 00:58:06.330
(laughs) a bunch of activists

00:58:06.330 --> 00:58:08.013
got us out of that stupid war,

00:58:09.250 --> 00:58:12.810
so I really believe in civil democracy,

00:58:12.810 --> 00:58:15.490
and in fact one of the lessons of nature

00:58:17.010 --> 00:58:18.220
that is really important for me

00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:20.680
is nature loves diversity.

00:58:20.680 --> 00:58:23.010
It's always trying to make new species,

00:58:23.010 --> 00:58:24.673
it hates monoculture.

00:58:26.050 --> 00:58:27.523
It hates a monocrop.

00:58:29.070 --> 00:58:30.820
It just loves its diversity,

00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:35.520
and why not solve all our problems

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:39.060
with hundreds of thousands of little NGOs,

00:58:39.060 --> 00:58:40.810
Non Government Organizations around

00:58:40.810 --> 00:58:42.240
that are doing good work,

00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:45.478
instead of just bloated
bureaucracies and stuff?

00:58:45.478 --> 00:58:48.645
(audience applauding)

00:58:51.700 --> 00:58:55.117
(instrumental pop music)
