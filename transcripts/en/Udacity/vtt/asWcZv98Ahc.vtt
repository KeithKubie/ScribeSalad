00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.160
What answer did you give, David?``
&gt;&gt; So,

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.780
my answer is that the best explanation
is a combination of Betatosis and Zetad.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.090
By combining these two illnesses, we can
cover all of the data we saw over here.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:14.970
We saw both illnesses elevate B,
which led to our High B, and

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:16.950
both reduced C, which led to our Low C.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.300
Our patient had a normal level of E,
but the effects of Betatosis and

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.790
Zetad counteract their influence on E.

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.150
Then Zetad accounts for our Reduced F,
and Betatosis accounts for

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:30.480
our Reduced H.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.370
My explanation, though, heavily
weights the principle of coverage.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.910
I sacrifice parsimony by having
two different explanations for

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.090
the sake of coverage,
I now cover all the symptoms.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.173
I could have also chose Thetadesis.

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:44.945
Thetadesis would have explained B,
C, and H.

00:00:44.945 --> 00:00:46.371
It wouldn't explain F, but

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:51.020
it would be a simpler explanation than
the combination of Betatosis and Zetad.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.050
In that case I would be sacrificing
coverage for parsimony.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.930
I could also augment Thetadesis
with Kappacide and Mutension.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.580
The three of them together would
cover all our symptoms, but

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.900
that would also be less parsimonious
than Betatosis and Zetad alone.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.680
I may have chosen to do that though,

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.890
if those three diseases were much
more common than Betatosis and Zetad.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.690
In which case, I would have more
confidence in them than just these two.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.500
&gt;&gt; It's an excellent answer, David, but
how did you come up with this answer?

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.210
&gt;&gt; So what I did,
is I started with the data and

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.660
I looked at which of these hypotheses
currently matched the data best.

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.300
That is to say, which hypotheses
explained the most points and

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:27.240
had the fewest conflicts.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.220
So for example, Betatosis explained the
High B, the Low C, and the Low H, but

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.090
it didn't explain the Low F, and
it also suggested there was Elevated E.

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.180
Initially, Thetadesis was the best
match, it explained three symptoms,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.930
it just didn't explain the fourth.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.380
Then, based on that, I went looking for

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.820
another illness that would
complete the explanation.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.480
For Thetadesis, that ended up leading
me to Kappacide and Mutension, but

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.020
at that point,
I was using three different hypotheses.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.650
So I decided to revisit one of the
closer matches from my original round.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.580
I revisited Betatosis, which had two
mismatches, it predicted Elevated E and

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.140
didn't explain the Reduced F.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.780
And I went looking for

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.760
another hypothesis that would
complete that explanation.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.389
Zetad happened to have
exactly those two effects.

00:02:06.389 --> 00:02:10.110
&gt;&gt; Note that one can use alternative
methods for the same problem.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.650
For example, one could use
case-based reasoning, and for it,

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.040
we came across a problem very
similar to this one previously.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.152
Suppose that the solution to that
particular problem was of a level

00:02:19.152 --> 00:02:20.260
as a case.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.331
In that particular case, B was high,
C was lower, F was low, and

00:02:24.331 --> 00:02:26.268
the solution was Thetadesis.

00:02:26.268 --> 00:02:29.818
In the current problem,
the additional symptom is that F is low.

00:02:29.818 --> 00:02:34.510
So case would force you to
the conclusion of Thetadesis.

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.610
But it will create this particular
solution to also account for

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.440
the additional symptom of F being low.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.750
We could do that by adding Kappacide and
Mutension to Thetadesis.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:47.203
Case-based reasoning does,

00:02:47.203 --> 00:02:50.800
will tend to forecast
the alternative set of hypothesis.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.030
One more point to note here then,

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.980
note that different methods can
lead to different solutions.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.360
Given different methods,

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.400
how might an error agent
decide which method to select?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.540
We'll return to this particular problem
when we discuss meta reasoning.
