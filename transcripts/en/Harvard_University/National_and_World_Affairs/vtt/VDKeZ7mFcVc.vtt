00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.060
We have someone who is very sick

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.259
A very sick child

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:12.799
Sheâ€™s malnourished, 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:15.029
Our threshold to send people home is very high

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:19.959
so if someone's an in-patient in normally means they are bad off,

00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:23.369
and if they are a little kid in-patient it usually means they are really bad off.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:36.519
She's known to us

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.979
her mother was a patient who died

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:49.470
But last time we saw her about a month and a half ago

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.359
she weighed 6 kilos

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.359
so she weighed 12 pounds. and although that's not great for a one year old

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:59.430
it's a lot better than 3 kilos which is what she is right now

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.300
so this is a concerning downward trend

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:12.030
and we have to be worried that she has TB or something else going on.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.690
I'm trying to maintain a sterile field

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.230
but as I was saying to KJ, it's hard to do when there's just flies everywhere.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.140
so but we'd really rather she didn't get an 
infection form us doing this to her.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.880
I know love, I know it's uncomfortable and I'm sorry

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.290
The left subclavian, it's a central vein so it makes it a little bit easier for us

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:45.299
in this setting

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.660
so first I'm going to numb her up and then I'm going to get 
all my equipment ready to go

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.820
ok baby bear, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:06.270
But these veins might still be quite down, and if so we'll have to go into her bone

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.640
which I'd really rather not do

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.500
but you can't always get what you want.

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.790
Alright lady, let's do this huh?

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.189
you feel for the part where the collarbone starts to go up in the air

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:30.140
and then you go right underneath it

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.450
let's see what we can find 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.870
it's gunna be, see if I can get one now

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.640
oh for an ultrasound huh

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:04.110
Im passing through it but I can't 
stay in it because she is just so clamped down

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.560
and we're getting a little bit of a flash but it's just

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.290
I can't get in it because it so tiny it's probably 
as wide as the needle that I'm using

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.520
so it's a little bit of a navigational

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.940
you know at the same time I dont want to puncture her lung

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.220
you end up riding down the collarbone 
alot which is what I'm doing right now.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:35.289
interosseous isn't that bad, 
I mean once she's hydrated then I'm sure
0:03:35.289,0:01:36.450
then we can try this again

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:46.580
osseous means bone. you put it in the tibia so the shin bone.

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:53.320
Lets get you some numbing medicine ok? 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.820
just a wee bit.

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:15.850
I know, I know that it hurts and I'm sorry
