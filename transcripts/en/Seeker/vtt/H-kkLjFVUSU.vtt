00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.070
Here at DNews, we love space.

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:03.490
And we love cats.

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.939
So it’s about time we talk about cats in
space!

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:12.140
Well, sorta.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.490
Hey all you earthbound suckers, Trace here
for DNews.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.640
Today, we’re doing something a little different:
while poking around on the internet, we found

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.859
this science video that we could not figure
out.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.970
In these experiments you can see the disorientation
resulting when an animal is suddenly placed

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.930
in a weightless state.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.940
After watching that, we had to find out: where
did this footage come from?

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.160
And what is going on with those weightless
cats?

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.059
Well, it turns out the answer stretches back
to before NASA existed.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.940
And those cats are still affecting our space
program today.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.989
The space race began in 1957 with the Soviet
launch of Sputnik 1, the very first man-made

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:50.989
satellite.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.460
That’s the actual sound of Sputnik 1 while
orbiting the Earth, by the way.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.789
Sputnik lit a fire under the US to get to
space, and within 9 months, NASA was up and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:00.789
running.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.640
But it turns out, NASA wasn’t the only game
in town when it came to space research.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.780
The American military had been studying the
effects of extreme flight on pilots since

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.890
World War I.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.850
And they knew that if we were going to beat
the Russians to space, we’d need to understand

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:19.060
how the human body responds to changes in
gravity…like the huge g-forces of a rocket

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.149
launch or the zero-gravity environment of
orbit.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.020
And how did we study new and dangerous things
in the 50s?

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.250
With animals.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.790
Here’s a rocket test from 1952, five years
before NASA was founded.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.960
Onboard were two Philippine monkeys and two
white mice.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.530
They became some of the very first animals
to survive a rocket flight, and that gave

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.119
us some of our earliest data on both extreme
g-forces and zero gravity.

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:45.930
Brave, brave rocket monkeys.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.090
But anyway.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.759
In 1958, NASA comes online with the immediate
goal of getting an American into orbit.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.380
But they don’t have the facilities or scale
to conduct all their experiments.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.399
So in 1961, in steps an Air Force department
called the Aerospace Medical Division, or

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.399
AMD.

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:06.729
They work with NASA on experiments designed
to get the Project Mercury spaceflight program

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:07.729
up to snuff.

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.910
And they are some pretty intense tests.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.790
Here’s the AMD trying out an ejection seat
for a fighter jet:

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:19.430
“The main parachute starts to deploy, but
in this particular test, it collapsed partially.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:27.269
The subject received an opening shock, estimated
at 16.5 G, and lost consciousness.”

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:33.260
The AMD ran most of their tests on humans,
but, you guessed it...they’re also responsible

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.489
for this video.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:39.280
In order to study weightless animals without
actually sending them into orbit, AMD loaded

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.180
cats, and also pigeons, into a cargo plane
and sent it into a controlled free fall…

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.489
voila, zero Gs.

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.890
And 60 years later... double voila, internet
gold!

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.959
But what on Earth can kicking cats around
a cargo plane teach us about humans in space?

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:57.500
Well, a lot.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.750
In 1961, the AMD published a paper that described
techniques to help people rotate themselves

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.970
while floating in zero gravity.

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.080
Experiments like these taught us: the “Bend
and Twist,” the “Lasso,” and, wait for

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:10.610
it…the “Cat Reflex.”

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.690
Which looks a lot like this.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.659
The point is: basic things like how to move
your own body are not intuitive in space.

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:23.519
But by copying nature, scientists taught our
astronauts how to survive in orbit, and beyond.

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.379
So thanks to a lot of hard work by NASA and
the Air Force, we now have footage of floating

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.939
scientists juggling cats.

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:32.170
Your tax dollars at work.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.030
...The pigeons, though… we still have no
idea what that’s all about.

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.379
Nowadays, scientists put smaller animals into
orbit to test all sorts of things.

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:47.950
Check out our video on one experiment that
we probably should have used birds and bees

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.370
for...
