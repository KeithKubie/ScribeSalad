00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.280
Let's say we have
two reservoirs.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:08.250
Let's say up here, I have
my hot reservoir.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.720
It's at th for hot.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.210
And I have my engine.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.940
It's going to be a Carnot
engine, because we'll learn

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.140
that no engine is better,
at least from an

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.310
efficiency point of view.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.130
We have to be careful when
we say "better."

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.870
We have our Carnot engine,
and it operates on heat

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:26.850
differentials.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.830
So it takes some heat from
our hot heat source.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:33.045
It takes some heat there.

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:34.825
Let's call that q1.

00:00:34.825 --> 00:00:38.080
And it does some work.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.220
Work is a good thing, so I'll
make that in green.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.855
It does some work, and then
the surplus energy, the

00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:53.400
surplus heat, q2, then goes
to our cold reservoir.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.970
I'll do that right there.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.020
t cold.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.350
Now, I made multiple
insinuations in the previous

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.800
video that this is the most
efficient engine that can be

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.230
created between two reservoirs,
th and tc.

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.540
Now, you come along and say,
no, no, no, no, no.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.360
I know of a friend, he has
invented a new engine that is

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.710
more efficient than this engine
between these same two

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:25.400
reservoirs.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.350
And you go, and you proceed to
draw this same type of diagram

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.140
for your friend's engine.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.730
You say, look-- let me make it
clear-- this is the same

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.850
reservoir, these same reservoirs
we're dealing with.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.750
Actually, I should probably draw
this line all the way,

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.250
because I'm going to have to
do multiple engines here.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.930
So the same reservoir we're
dealing with, right?

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.910
This is all the hot reservoir,
th th, and this is all the

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.830
cold reservoir.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:52.600
I need space for multiple
engines that we're

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.530
going to deal with.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.210
So your friend has an engine.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.460
We'll call it the
super engine.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.430
And your friend's claim-- and
I'll show you why your

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.054
friend's claim cannot be true,
if you believe the second law

00:02:09.054 --> 00:02:13.140
of thermodynamics-- so your
friend's claim, they have the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.210
super engine.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.760
And they claim that look, I
can actually take in q1.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.270
I can take in that same heat
from this heat source up here.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.300
But I can produce more work
than your Carnot engine.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.460
I could produce 1 plus x.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.520
I don't want to get
too algebraic.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.520
But let's say, you produce w.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.080
I produce w times 1
plus x of work.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.530
Where x is a positive number.

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:43.490
So he's saying, look,
x is greater than 0.

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.190
Whatever that number he
might feed you is.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.000
And then the rest of
the energy that's

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.660
left over is what?

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.150
It's q1 minus this.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.480
So it's q1 minus w
times 1 plus x.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.930
And just to be clear, q2 right
here, I could rewrite that as

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.430
q1 minus w.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:08.000
Fair enough.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.030
So you look at that.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.320
You come to me with this, and
I say, no, no, no, no.

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.750
This cannot be true.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.300
Because if this were, then we
would solve literally all of

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.950
the world's energy problems. And
I'm about to show you why

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:21.490
we could solve all of the
world's energy problems, and

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:24.240
we would have a perpetual motion
machine, and be able to

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.610
defy all sorts of things
if we had this.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.560
Now, this is my Carnot engine.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.600
But I could devise a reverse
Carnot engine, right?

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.800
Let me make a reverse
Carnot engine.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.230
So my reverse Carnot engine
would look like this.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.930
And it's going to do the same
thing, but in reverse.

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:55.070
So instead of producing q1 minus
w here and putting it

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:10.420
into tc, it could take in q1
minus w from our cold source--

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.520
so could take that in-- or even
better, let's scale it up

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.270
a little bit.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.430
Let's say it takes in q1
minus w times 1 plus x.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:23.660
So I've just made a slightly
larger reversed Carnot engine.

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:28.580
Now, if I take in that much--
in order to do this in

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.180
reverse, I'm going to have to
take in, I'm going to have to

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.780
scale up this Carnot engine
and reverse everything.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.860
So instead of producing work,
I'm now going to need work to

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.010
go on the other direction, and
I've scaled it up by 1 plus x.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.450
So I'm going to need the
amount of work here

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.820
times 1 plus x.

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:53.360
And then I'm going to push q1,
but I've scaled it up.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:57.180
I'm going to push in
q1 times 1 plus x

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.790
into my hot heat source.

00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:00.490
And once again, this isn't
defying the laws of

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:01.110
thermodynamics.

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.410
I'm taking up some work.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.500
There's work that needs to be
done in order to do this.

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.800
But all of a sudden, you come
to me and say, look, this is

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.380
an awesome deal.

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.080
You have this nice engine
that works this way.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.980
My friend has a super engine.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.780
Let's just couple
them together.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.450
Let's take the work that he
produces right here-- he

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.580
produces w times 1 plus x, and
that just happens to be the

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.410
amount of work that you need
to operate your engine.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.310
So you just feed that
into there.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.630
So what's the net effect
of these two engines?

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.750
So let me do another, scroll
a little bit more.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.190
Actually, that might be
the best way to do it.

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.580
So let me make sure that we
understand that these are the

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.510
same heat sinks or heat sources
that we're using the

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.960
whole time.

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.680
So that's my hot source, my
cold source is down here.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.400
So if I add our two engines
together-- so if I have a, you

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:02.210
know, let me call it a-- I'm
going to pick a new color.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.320
These colors are getting
monotonous.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.160
Nope.

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.760
I wanted to do the
rectangle tool.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:09.950
There you go.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.780
All right.

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:12.880
So I combine these two
engines together.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.320
Essentially I just put a
big box around them.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.060
They're both operating between
these two heat sources.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.160
These two reservoirs.

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.730
So I call this the, you know,
your super engine plus my

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:25.300
reverse Carnot engine.

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:26.990
So what's happening now?

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:32.685
What's the net heat that's
being taken in

00:06:32.685 --> 00:06:33.570
or put out of here?

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:38.710
So we have q1-- we have--
let me see.

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:43.670
We have q1 minus w 1 plus x, but
in this direction, we have

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.340
q1-- so in this direction,
we could rewrite this.

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:48.620
I want to make sure you're
clear on the algebra.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:50.490
This could be rewritten
as what?

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:58.360
As q1 times 1 plus x times, or
minus, w times 1 place x.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.090
Right?

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.530
Now, if you compare these
terms, this is the

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:05.340
same as this term.

00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:07.770
This term is bigger
than this term.

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:08.120
Right?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.060
This term is clearly bigger,
because we're multiplying it

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:11.180
by something larger than 1.

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.630
It's bigger than this storm.

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:17.640
So if we combine these two, the
upward movement, or the

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:20.120
amount of heat I'm taking up
from my reverse Carnot, is

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.530
going to be greater than the
amount of heat being put in by

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:25.670
your friend's super engine.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:26.900
And we can actually calculate
the amount.

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:29.440
We can just take this amount
minus that amount, and that's

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:31.640
the net upward movement.

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:36.040
So the net upward movement
from our cold

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:38.470
reservoir is what?

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:40.500
It's this value minus
this value.

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:47.450
So minus q1 minus w 1 plus x.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.973
If we take a minus, we're
going to subtract it.

00:07:48.973 --> 00:07:50.800
So it's a minus and a plus.

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.450
These cancel out.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:55.610
This minus cancels out with--
so this first term could be

00:07:55.610 --> 00:08:00.010
rewritten as q1 plus q1x.

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:00.830
Right?

00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:01.910
We could rewrite it that way.

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.400
So this cancels out with that.

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.050
And so the net upward movement
when we combine the two

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:11.270
engines is q1 times x.

00:08:11.270 --> 00:08:12.440
Fair enough.

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:13.640
Now what about the
work transfer?

00:08:13.640 --> 00:08:16.380
Well, whatever work this guy
produces is exactly the amount

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.090
of work that I need.

00:08:17.090 --> 00:08:20.540
So no outside work has to
be done on the system.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.650
It just works.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:23.960
This guy produces work, this
guy uses the work.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.730
Now what's in that
heat transferred

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:28.175
up to our hot reservoir?

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.140
What's the amount of heat?

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.090
Well, it's the difference
between these two.

00:08:35.090 --> 00:08:38.419
And this is clearly a larger
number than this one, so the

00:08:38.419 --> 00:08:40.230
upward movement dominates.

00:08:40.230 --> 00:08:42.299
So what's this minus that?

00:08:42.299 --> 00:08:48.750
So this can be rewritten
as q1 plus q1x, right?

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:50.380
I just distributed the q1.

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:51.580
We're going to subtract
that out.

00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.400
Minus q1.

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:54.330
You're left with q1x.

00:08:54.330 --> 00:08:56.090
So the net movement,
when we combine the

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.700
two engines, is q1x.

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:01.580
So what's happening here?

00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:05.770
I have no external energy or
work has to be expended into

00:09:05.770 --> 00:09:06.795
this system.

00:09:06.795 --> 00:09:11.890
And it's just taking heat from
a cold body, and it's moving

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.970
it to a warm body.

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.140
And it does this indefinitely.

00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.260
It'll do this as much
as I want to.

00:09:16.260 --> 00:09:17.290
I can just build a bigger one.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.840
It'll do it on even a larger
and larger scale.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.520
So if you think about it, I
could heat my house with ice

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:26.090
by just making the ice colder.

00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:32.270
I could create steam from things
that arbitrarily cold.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.570
This goes against the second
law of thermodynamics.

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:39.770
The net entropy in this
world is going down.

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.620
Because what's happening here?

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:45.700
This is just a straight up
transfer of q1x from a cold

00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.230
body to a hot body.

00:09:47.230 --> 00:09:50.340
So what's the net change
in entropy here?

00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.060
The change in entropy
of the universe.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:10:02.430
Well, the hot body is gaining
some heat, so it's q1x over

00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:05.135
the temperature of the hot body,
and then the cold body

00:10:05.135 --> 00:10:06.430
is losing the same amount.

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:11.450
So it's minus q1x over
the cold body.

00:10:11.450 --> 00:10:17.110
Now, this is a bigger number
than this is, right?

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:19.150
Because the denominator
is smaller.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.130
This is a cold body.

00:10:20.130 --> 00:10:22.490
Its temperature in Kelvin will
be a smaller number.

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:26.355
So this is going to be less than
0, which the second law

00:10:26.355 --> 00:10:28.240
of thermodynamics tells
us cannot be.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.610
The entropy cannot shrink
in the universe.

00:10:30.610 --> 00:10:33.140
This whole thing is an
independent system, and the

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:34.180
entropy is shrinking.

00:10:34.180 --> 00:10:36.900
And we can make the entropy
shrink arbitrarily if we just

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.480
scale up our x's enough.

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.670
So this is why the Carnot engine
is the most efficient

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:43.500
engine possible.

00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:46.690
Because if anyone claimed to
have a more efficient engine,

00:10:46.690 --> 00:10:49.650
you could couple it with a
reverse Carnot engine, and

00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.110
then create this perpetual
reverse-- I guess you could

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.450
call it a perpetual
refrigeration machine that

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:59.610
just out of the blue creates
anti-entropy from anywhere,

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:01.970
and it would be this perpetual
energy source that creates

00:11:01.970 --> 00:11:03.460
energy out of nothing.

00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:06.390
And so this is just something
that cannot be done in our

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.830
world, especially if you believe
the second law of

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:10.060
thermodynamics.

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:13.620
So the most efficient engine
is the Carnot engine, where

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:17.810
its efficiency is described as 1
minus the temperature of the

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.380
cold body divided
by the hot body.

00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.920
So if I have two temperature
reservoirs, let's say that my

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:30.590
hot one is at 500 Kelvin, and my
cold one is at 300 Kelvin,

00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.910
and I have some engine that
takes heat from there, and

00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.690
transfers it there, and
does some work.

00:11:35.690 --> 00:11:38.350
The most efficient engine, if
I were to remove all the

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:42.030
friction in the engine, the
highest efficiency I could get

00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:47.390
would be 1 minus 300 Kelvin over
500 Kelvin, which is 1

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:53.360
minus 3/5, which is 2/5, which
is equal to 0.4, which is

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:56.650
equal to 40%.

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.720
So if someone tells you that
they made an engine that

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.570
operates between a reservoir
that's 500 Kelvin and 300

00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:07.090
Kelvin, and they say, oh, I've
achieved 41% percent

00:12:07.090 --> 00:12:07.520
efficiency.

00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.460
I've really polished
the thing well.

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.250
You know that they are lying.

00:12:11.250 --> 00:12:14.150
So anyway, hopefully you found
that reasonably interesting,

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.750
and I'll see you in
the next video.
