00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.880
NARRATOR: What do all these
people have in common?

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.120
They've all been
called populists,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.330
but is that an insult
or a compliment?

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.210
And is it even accurate?

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.960
It's hard to tell.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.620
The term is defined as a member
of a political party claiming

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.710
to represent the common
people, but populism

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.750
isn't as easy to understand
as some other isms.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.540
Why?

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.830
To answer that, we need to go
back to the origin of the term

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.380
late in the 19th century.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.080
The decades following
the Civil War

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.040
were a time of massive
growth in America.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.170
From 1860 to 1890, the American
population nearly doubled.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.330
Production of steel and coal
exploded, all while the US Army

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:44.170
battled Native
Americans in a bid

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.710
to carve out more and more
land for railroads and farmers

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.380
as the country
expanded ever westward.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.540
With over 62 million
American mouths to feed,

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.170
farming looked like
a lucrative field.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.330
Technological advancement
made it even easier to grow

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.250
and harvest crops,
if you could afford

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.290
to invest in the technology.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.080
But many farmers couldn't,
not on their own.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.960
So they took out hefty
loans from eastern banks,

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.920
believing that the
high demand for food

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.960
would allow them to pay off
their debt in a short time.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.290
But then crop prices
fell and drought hit,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.250
and the privately-owned
railroad monopolies

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.920
drove up transportation costs.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.460
Many farmers soon went bankrupt.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.040
The federal government
did little to help,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.790
refusing to break
up the monopolies

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:31.460
and offering little
to ease the suffering.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:34.210
So farmers took matters
into their own hands,

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.080
banding together to
advocate for themselves.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.290
In May 1891, one such
farmers' alliance in Kansas

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.960
coined the phrase "populist,"
meaning of the people,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960
to describe their movement.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.670
Within a year, the
People's Party,

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.830
also known as the Populist
Party, had been formed.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.120
It was born out of an unlikely
alliance between farmers,

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.330
union leaders, and
workers' organizations

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.750
like the Knights of Labor.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.000
Their collective target was
the moneyed elite of the East.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.500
Populist orator Mary
Ellen Lease famously

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.830
stated that America had become
a government of Wall Street,

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.500
by Wall Street, and
for Wall Street,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.290
and the Populist Party
agitated for massive reform.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.960
The populists called for the
recognition of labor unions,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.420
regulation of the
railroad industry,

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.420
the direct election of senators,
a progressive income tax,

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.040
women's suffrage, an
eight-hour work day, and more.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.670
These were considered
radical ideas at the time.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.380
Through their collective
action, the party

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.830
gained power and a foothold
on the national stage.

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.460
In 1892, they nominated
James B. Weaver

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.290
for president, who
received 8% of the vote

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.210
and captured five states.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.210
Two years later, the party
sent eight members to Congress

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.210
and captured hundreds of
state legislature seats.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.040
But there were divisive
factions within.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.830
Nativists and racists
blamed Jewish immigrants

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.790
and Chinese railroad
workers for their woes.

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.290
Some populist groups welcomed
black farmers in the South,

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.380
but others refused them as
the Jim Crow era took hold.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.880
While the movement began outside
the two-party system, by 1896

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:11.750
the Populist Party
had become aligned

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.380
with the Democratic Party.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.330
They nominated
William Jennings Bryan

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.670
for president, an influential
populist politician.

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.750
This too ostracized
many black populists,

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.080
who felt a loyalty
to the Republicans,

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.580
the party of Lincoln.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.000
The Populist Party waned,
but its founding ideals

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.330
would persevere.

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:32.710
Louisiana governor
and Senator Huey Long

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:34.670
led a left-wing
populist movement

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.710
that addressed Americans'
real fears during the depths

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:39.080
of the Great Depression.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.080
He demanded a radical
redistribution of wealth

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.170
from the country's richest
citizens to its poorest.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.580
His plan, known as
Share Our Wealth,

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.620
would have capped personal
income at $50 million

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.290
in today's money.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.420
He considered a run
for president in 1936,

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.120
but was assassinated.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.620
His ideas, however,
did not die and helped

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.040
push the already liberal
New Deal policies

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.960
of FDR even further left.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.620
In the 1950s, America
saw one of its first

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.790
right-wing manifestations
of populism

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:11.790
under Senator Joseph McCarthy.

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:15.290
McCarthy claimed communists had
infiltrated positions of power

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.080
in the government and military
with the help of the East

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.250
Coast liberal intelligentsia.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.710
Attacking the liberal
elites echoed the outcries

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.540
of the original
populist movement,

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.790
but for very different reasons.

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.460
In the 1960s, Alabama
governor George

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:33.330
Wallace made a name for himself
as a staunch segregationist.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.830
He used populist rhetoric to
capitalize on mostly white

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.080
middle class resentment of
the sweeping social changes

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.580
of the decade.

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.500
The low and middle income
group in this country

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:47.290
haven't had any representation,
and the pseudo-intellectuals

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.000
have taken over the party
in the Democratic Party.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.830
NARRATOR: His followers
attacked the government,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.330
Vietnam War protesters, the
media, liberals, and the elite.

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:01.330
Populist ideas and rhetoric
continued into the modern day.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.580
Barack Obama, responding to the
unsustainable cost of health

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.830
care, campaigned on
universal coverage

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.420
as a candidate in
the 2008 election

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.500
and pushed through the
Affordable Care Act

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.210
as president.

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:15.880
The legislation covered many
more Americans than before,

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:18.960
but left the private health
care industry intact.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.330
It was still
attacked as radical.

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:22.790
No more petitions!

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.790
Fight the politicians!

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.460
Fight the politicians!

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.540
NARRATOR: In the 2016 Democratic
presidential primaries,

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:33.170
Bernie Sanders tapped into a
very real anger at both Wall

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.710
Street and the government over
the 2008 financial crisis,

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.830
the subsequent great
recession, and a recovery that

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:42.120
had left many Americans behind.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.880
As a result of their
greed and illegal behavior,

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.790
they drove this economy into
the worst economic downturn

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:53.460
since the Great Depression.

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.330
NARRATOR: His proposed
economic policies,

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:58.830
like a progressive estate tax,
doubling the minimum wage,

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:01.500
and improving paid
family and medical leave,

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.500
paralleled those of the
populist farmers of the 1890s.

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.710
It's going to be so
beautiful, and you're

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.830
going to pay far less money.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.670
NARRATOR: Donald Trump, while
running for president in 2016,

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.750
also made a populist appeal
to the economic and social

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.330
insecurity of many
Americans, portraying

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.080
his political opponents
and the media as the elite

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.500
and employing a nativist
tone similar to the more

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.170
divisive factions of the late
19th century populist movement.

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:29.920
[chanting]

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.000
Throughout American
history, populism

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.170
has been celebrated,
condemned, and appropriated

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.460
across the political spectrum.

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.620
There is no easy definition,
but the one thing

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.580
all populist movements
seem to have in common

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:49.120
is an appeal to the people
and their fears, anxieties,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.880
and dreams of a better world.
