yeah he could sort of read French and he
 

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
yeah he could sort of read French and he
could<00:06:47.320><c> see</c><00:06:47.440><c> the</c><00:06:47.530><c> math</c><00:06:47.710><c> and</c><00:06:47.889><c> he</c><00:06:47.950><c> could</c><00:06:48.100><c> figure</c>

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:48.250 align:start position:0%
could see the math and he could figure
 

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
could see the math and he could figure
out<00:06:48.490><c> what</c><00:06:48.639><c> sort</c><00:06:48.850><c> of</c><00:06:48.910><c> background</c><00:06:49.090><c> and</c><00:06:49.480><c> so</c><00:06:50.320><c> so</c>

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 align:start position:0%
out what sort of background and so so
 

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.170 align:start position:0%

we're<00:06:50.889><c> not</c><00:06:51.070><c> together</c><00:06:51.220><c> and</c><00:06:51.580><c> that's</c><00:06:51.760><c> why</c><00:06:51.880><c> we</c>

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:52.180 align:start position:0%
we're not together and that's why we
 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:54.930 align:start position:0%
we're not together and that's why we

work went on to make history because
 

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:17.430 align:start position:0%
work went on to make history because

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
became widely adopted these ideas are
 

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
became widely adopted these ideas are

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:30.050 align:start position:0%
outside and you know I think it's a
little<00:11:28.090><c> difficult</c><00:11:29.050><c> for</c><00:11:29.380><c> me</c><00:11:29.500><c> to</c><00:11:29.590><c> really</c>

00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
little difficult for me to really
 

00:11:30.060 --> 00:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
little difficult for me to really
understand<00:11:31.060><c> why</c><00:11:31.180><c> but</c><00:11:32.670><c> the</c><00:11:33.670><c> several</c><00:11:33.940><c> factors</c><00:11:34.270><c> I</c>

00:11:34.380 --> 00:11:34.390 align:start position:0%
understand why but the several factors I
 

00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
understand why but the several factors I
think<00:11:34.420><c> so</c><00:11:34.750><c> you</c><00:11:35.170><c> know</c><00:11:35.260><c> this</c><00:11:35.440><c> was</c><00:11:35.590><c> back</c><00:11:35.860><c> in</c><00:11:36.070><c> the</c>

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:36.250 align:start position:0%
think so you know this was back in the

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:54.070 align:start position:0%
know with that normalization so it's
 

00:13:54.070 --> 00:13:58.769 align:start position:0%
know with that normalization so it's

00:13:58.769 --> 00:13:58.779 align:start position:0%
very similar to where to CRF in fact it
 

00:13:58.779 --> 00:14:02.370 align:start position:0%
very similar to where to CRF in fact it

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:46.050 align:start position:0%
accomplished on it was really icy
and<00:15:44.620><c> so</c><00:15:44.920><c> the</c><00:15:45.190><c> patent</c><00:15:45.520><c> was</c><00:15:45.610><c> in</c><00:15:45.730><c> the</c><00:15:45.820><c> hands</c><00:15:46.030><c> of</c>

and so the patent was in the hands of
 

00:15:46.060 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%

people with no idea what they had and we
 

00:15:49.450 --> 00:15:50.730 align:start position:0%
people with no idea what they had and we

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:52.570 align:start position:0%
could not really develop the technology
 

00:15:52.570 --> 00:15:54.150 align:start position:0%
could not really develop the technology
and<00:15:52.840><c> then</c><00:15:52.960><c> our</c><00:15:53.170><c> engineering</c><00:15:53.530><c> team</c><00:15:53.770><c> was</c><00:15:53.980><c> in</c><00:15:54.100><c> a</c>

00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
and then our engineering team was in a
 

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:55.410 align:start position:0%
and then our engineering team was in a

00:15:55.410 --> 00:15:55.420 align:start position:0%
separate company because we went with
 

00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.150 align:start position:0%

AT&amp;T<00:15:55.720><c> the</c><00:15:56.080><c> engineering</c><00:15:56.440><c> went</c><00:15:56.650><c> with</c><00:15:56.800><c> result</c>

00:15:57.150 --> 00:15:57.160 align:start position:0%
AT&amp;T the engineering went with result
 

00:15:57.160 --> 00:15:59.250 align:start position:0%
AT&amp;T the engineering went with result
and<00:15:57.370><c> the</c><00:15:58.030><c> product</c><00:15:58.330><c> worked</c><00:15:58.450><c> with</c><00:15:58.540><c> NCR</c><00:15:58.810><c> so</c><00:15:59.170><c> it</c>

00:15:59.250 --> 00:15:59.260 align:start position:0%
and the product worked with NCR so it
 

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
and the product worked with NCR so it
was<00:15:59.350><c> a</c><00:15:59.380><c> little</c><00:15:59.560><c> depressing</c>

00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:00.570 align:start position:0%
was a little depressing
