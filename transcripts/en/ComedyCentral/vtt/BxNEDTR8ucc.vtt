00:00:02.001 --> 00:00:04.771
Our next course is a halibut
from Maine

00:00:04.804 --> 00:00:09.509
lovingly glazed in
an orange-cranberry<i> mostarda.</i>

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:12.545
I have an awkward question
for you, Lillian.

00:00:12.578 --> 00:00:15.348
Is that halibut
actually from Maine?

00:00:15.381 --> 00:00:18.751
Your butler, Poopers, just said
it, but I assume he was japing.

00:00:18.784 --> 00:00:21.154 align:end position:100%
Poopers, is that halibut
from Maine?

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:23.689 align:end position:100%
I can almost smell the bearded
fisherman who caught it.

00:00:23.722 --> 00:00:25.458 align:start size:72% position:28%
Get rid of that poison!

00:00:25.491 --> 00:00:27.226
Garfield,
remove this atrocity at once!

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.030 align:start position:0%
I apologize
one thousand-fold.

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:39.972 align:start position:0%
You're quite handsome
when you throw out food

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.141 align:start position:0%
a dog has spit out.

00:00:42.174 --> 00:00:44.410 align:start size:66% position:34%
Oh, thank you, Chair.

00:00:44.443 --> 00:00:46.145 align:start position:0%
Do you ever wonder
what it would be like to taste

00:00:46.178 --> 00:00:48.114 align:start position:0%
one tiny, little bite?

00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:50.583 align:start position:0%
I know I do,
but I'm not as brave as you.

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:53.219 align:start position:0%
Maybe you could try it
and tell me what it's like.

00:00:53.252 --> 00:00:54.554 align:start size:56% position:44%
No, I could never!

00:00:54.587 --> 00:00:56.055 size:88% position:56%
It's an unpardonable offense

00:00:56.088 --> 00:00:58.357 align:end position:100%
to eat that which is designated
for the upstairs.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.326 align:start size:47% position:53%
I must throw it
in the garbage.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.129 align:start position:0%
I'd love to see
just one small morsel

00:01:03.162 --> 00:01:06.999 align:start position:0%
in your perfect
little mouth.

00:01:07.032 --> 00:01:08.234 align:start size:25% position:75%
[scoffs]

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.403 align:start size:31% position:69%
Well, I...

00:01:10.436 --> 00:01:14.340 align:start size:56% position:44%
guess I could have
one little nibble.

00:01:14.373 --> 00:01:16.076 align:start size:13% position:88%
Yes.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:20.780 align:end position:100%
It's like
a flaky little cloud!

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:22.415 align:end position:100%
What did you say
this was called, again?

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.917
- Food.
- Well, if this is food,

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.752 align:end position:100%
then I'm glad
to have tried it.

00:01:26.785 --> 00:01:29.856 align:end position:100%
It makes working for gruel
that much more rewarding,

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:33.793
knowing that real food is going
to its rightful place, upstairs.

00:01:33.826 --> 00:01:36.729 align:start position:0%
Well, I surely enjoyed
watching you do it.

00:01:36.762 --> 00:01:40.600 align:end position:100%
Well, then I am glad
to have danced with the fire.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:44.735
