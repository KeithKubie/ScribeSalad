00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
All right! We've done so much.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We've calculated the size of the earth and the moon and the distance from the earth to the moon.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We might as well figure out the distance to the sun as well, right. Let's look at a picture.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Here's the earth. Here's the moon. Over here, we have the sun.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Now, let me say again this is not to scale.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The sun should be much larger and much farther away than depicted here.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
The moon should be farther away as well.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Now, the picture I've drawn here is a very special alignment of the earth, moon and sun.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is what's called a half moon--the reason why is the sun is striking the moon and based on this

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
geometry, you can only strike this side of the moon.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Well, it's always only striking half of the moon. What makes this so special?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Well, what's special is from earth, if we look up, we just see everything on this side of this blue line,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:58.000
everything below this blue line, and as you can see, everything to the left of this dividing line is in the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
light and everything on the other side to the right is not, so to us this actually appears like a half moon.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Even though the moon is always only half illuminated, this is the one special geometry

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
where we only see half of the visible side illuminated to us.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
We've got this special geometry that happens about twice a month. What makes it special?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
You can maybe guess that we can draw a right triangle between the earth, the sun and the moon.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
In the previous problem, you calculated this distance, and I'm not going to tell you exactly

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
what we calculated but let's say it's very close to 400,000 km.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
That's the distance from the earth to the moon.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Now, we can actually measure this angle--you've probably seen those strange days

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000
where the sun and the moon are both in the sky.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I know that seems weird--the moon is supposed to be out at night, sun in the day

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
but hey it happens like this sometimes.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
When it does happen like this and it happens to be a half moon, we can measure this angle

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
and then, well, I think you see where we're going--you can measure this distance l.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
This actually turns out to be a really, really large angle--so this angle which we'll call alpha.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Alpha is actually equal to 89.853 degrees--so given this number and this distance between

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the earth and the moon, can you tell me what this l is--the distance between the sun and the earth.

00:02:22.000 --> 99:59:59.000
Give your answer in kilometers.
