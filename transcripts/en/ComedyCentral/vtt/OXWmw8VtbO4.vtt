Thats USC football player Zach
Banner.

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.873
I wanted to show him a good
time.

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:10.343
First up. Complying with the
NCAA rule that states

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:13.279 line:0%
<i> that states that athletes
 may only be paid from a job.</i>

00:00:13.312 --> 00:00:15.314
<i> So I made Zach my employee.</i>

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:16.783
<i> Boss.</i>

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:19.719 align:end position:100%
Listen, man,
as my employee,

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:21.788 align:start size:66% position:34%
I wanted to gift you.

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:23.322
So I got you a car.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:26.225
<i> - Ooh...</i>

00:00:26.258 --> 00:00:27.960
- I couldn't buy it.
- Oh, man.

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:30.663 line:0%
- 'Cause that's against
the rules of the NCAA.

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:32.432 line:0%
- Correct.
- So I rented it.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:34.500 line:0%
- For me?
- Yeah, now how old are you?

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.269 line:0%
- 23.
- I think you gotta be

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:39.072 line:0%
older than that
to drive the car,

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.741 line:0%
based on their rules,
on NCAA.

00:00:41.774 --> 00:00:44.177 line:0%
Just Maserati rules.
- Are you gonna drive me?

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:45.545 line:0%
- I'm gonna chauffeur you, brah.

00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.750
- You're a senior,
headed towards the draft.

00:00:50.783 --> 00:00:52.618
- Yes, sir.
- How are you feeling right now

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:55.988
about this--your whole career
as a college athlete?

00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:58.291
- Feeling good, man.
I was All-American this year.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.992
- Okay.
- Everything with the Rose Bowl

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:01.861
victory and everything.
We brought SC back,

00:01:01.894 --> 00:01:03.796
put it on the map.
- What was the night like

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.032
after that game?
- Oh, insane.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:08.534
Dudes were jumping off tables
doing crazy stuff?

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:11.170
- So I mean, that's pretty much
what you get paid in.

00:01:11.203 --> 00:01:13.539
Is party, and fan love.
- Yeah, yeah.

00:01:13.572 --> 00:01:16.175
Yeah, we get paid in parties
and girls at school.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.044
- Girls at school?
- Yeah.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:19.512
It's like one of those type of
things, if I told you,

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:21.380
I'd have to kill you
type things.

00:01:21.413 --> 00:01:23.483
- Don't stop spilling the tea
now, Zach, it's too late!

00:01:23.516 --> 00:01:25.318 line:0%
You already out here
dry snitching.

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:28.221 line:0%
Dry snitching is when you snitch
but kind of.

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.389
- What's the brokest moment
you've had in college?

00:01:30.422 --> 00:01:32.492
- One time during the summer,

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.861
I was straight up eatin' Cup of
Noodles for, like, three days.

00:01:34.894 --> 00:01:37.029
- Cup of Noodles?
- Cup of Noodles for breakfast,

00:01:37.062 --> 00:01:38.865
lunch, and dinner.
- Ugh!

00:01:38.898 --> 00:01:40.500
Man, you need to be living life.

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.435
You need to be eating
Wagyu steak.

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:44.137
You know what that is?
- No.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.372 line:0%
- That's where they treat
the cow like a king.

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:49.509 line:0%
They massage it.
They--and the cattle

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:52.879 line:0%
watch M. Night Shyamalan
movies and Scorsese flicks.

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.847 line:0%
- They cater to the cow.
- They cater to the cow.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.917 line:0%
And then they kill it,
so you go the best meat.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.752 line:0%
- It's like a black woman.

00:01:59.785 --> 00:02:01.454 line:0%
- What?
- Yeah.

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:02.855 line:0%
- It's like a black woman.

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:04.357 line:0%
- What?
- Yeah.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.725
- What, 'cause they have
the best meat?

00:02:05.758 --> 00:02:06.926
- No, 'cause they cater to them

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:08.861
and they kill you at the end

00:02:08.894 --> 00:02:10.563
when they found out you hanging
out with they boyfriends.

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:14.134
- Too many blitzes, [BLEEP].
Too many blitzes.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:18.538
[scatting]

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.406
- They got good food here?

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.641
- They got dope food here, man,
that's why we here.

00:02:21.674 --> 00:02:23.342
Catch the keys.
- Oh!

00:02:23.375 --> 00:02:25.178
I missed--oh, man!

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.083 line:0%
- I can't really purchase
your food.

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:34.187 line:0%
Cheers to the rules, right?

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.055
Mmm.

00:02:37.022 --> 00:02:38.358
Uh-oh.

00:02:39.792 --> 00:02:40.927 line:14%
<i> Look at Zach's face</i>

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.228 line:14%
<i> staring at that steak.</i>

00:02:42.261 --> 00:02:46.265
DJ Khaled and another one.

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:48.935
And another one.
Thank you, man.

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:53.139
So what's your normal day like
as a college athlete?

00:02:53.172 --> 00:02:55.208
- Up at 6:00 a.m. for lift.

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:58.644
School starts at 8:30,
get out of class around 2:00.

00:02:58.677 --> 00:03:01.480
Meetings are at 3:30
and then practice is at 5:00

00:03:01.513 --> 00:03:03.749
and we're done about 8:00.

00:03:03.782 --> 00:03:05.985
- Phew. How often
do you skip class?

00:03:06.018 --> 00:03:08.154
- Every day.

00:03:08.187 --> 00:03:10.323
- Like, not all your classes.
- No.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.691
- But there's...
- You choose.

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.226
- Every day there's one4 class

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:15.127
that you're just not gonna make.
- No.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.096
- If you weren't
as good as you are,

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:19.098
would you have to go to
more classes?

00:03:19.131 --> 00:03:22.101
- Yeah, 'cause then you're
supposed to carry the team GPA.

00:03:22.134 --> 00:03:24.470
- Uh-huh.
- The average amongst the team.

00:03:24.503 --> 00:03:26.472
- So what's the kicker's GPA?

00:03:26.505 --> 00:03:29.141
- Well, he's a kicker, so he
doesn't really practice often.

00:03:29.174 --> 00:03:31.510
And he's white,
so it's pretty high.

00:03:31.543 --> 00:03:34.513
- How does it make you feel,
Zach, to be an athlete

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:36.182
and know that people
are making money off you?

00:03:36.215 --> 00:03:39.285
- It's just not fair.
I simply think that

00:03:39.318 --> 00:03:40.820
the players should be
compensated.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:42.188
People from the NCAA,

00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:43.623
people from the school,
coaches,

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:44.690
everybody's getting paid;

00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:46.459
<i> why aren't we?</i>

00:03:46.492 --> 00:03:49.795
- What I might do,
get this to go, and then go.

00:03:49.828 --> 00:03:51.364
And accidentally leave it.

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:52.965
What's the phrase,
finders-keepers?

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:55.668
- That's still illegal.
We can't do that.

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:57.570
- You right, you right.

00:03:57.603 --> 00:04:00.473
I now decree this leftovers.

00:04:00.506 --> 00:04:03.576
They have no cash value.
Let me say it again.

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:07.813
Fans might be watching.
These are leftovers!

00:04:07.846 --> 00:04:09.882
No cash value!

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:12.785
I don't want this shit no more!

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:20.092
By the rules of the NCAA,
you can eat that food, right?

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:23.362
- Yeah, yeah, I can do that.
- Then go to town, man.

00:04:23.395 --> 00:04:25.197
- Oh, my God.
- Yeah.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.499
Does it taste like freedom?

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:28.634
- Really good steak.

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:30.636
- Look at you, man,
sitting here,

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:32.338
eating someone else's trash.

00:04:32.371 --> 00:04:35.041
How'd it get like this, Zach?

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:38.210
<i> I came, I saw,
 and I balled out with Zach.</i>

00:04:38.243 --> 00:04:40.880
<i> As much as the NCAA rules
 would allow.</i>

00:04:40.913 --> 00:04:42.915
- You the man, James.
- You the man too.

00:04:42.948 --> 00:04:45.251
[BLEEP] Cup of Noodles.
