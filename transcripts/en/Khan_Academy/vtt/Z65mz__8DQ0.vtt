00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.300
- [Instructor] What I'd
like to do in this video

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.690
is a few more examples

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.510
recognizing the slope and
y-intercept given an equation.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.730
So, let's start with something

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.060
that we might already recognize.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.970
Let's say we have something

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:16.330
of the form y is equal to five x

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.780
plus three.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.550
What is the slope and the
y-intercept in this example here?

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.180
Well, we've already talked about

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.410
that we can have something
in slope intercept form

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.280
where it has a form y
is equal to the slope,

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:30.800
which people use the letter m for,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.840
the slope times x plus the y-intercept,

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.930
which people use the letter b for.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.240
So, if we just look at this,

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:40.510
m is going to be the coefficient
on x right over there.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.230
So, m is equal to five.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.070
That is the slope.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.420
And b is just going to be this
constant term, plus three.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.660
So, b is equal to three.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.820
So, this is your y-intercept.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.030
So, that's pretty straightforward

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.470
but let's see a few slightly
more involved examples.

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.000
Let's say if we had
form y is equal to five

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.810
plus three x,

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.683
what is the slope and the
y-intercept in this situation?

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.870
Well, it might have
taken you a second or two

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.120
to realize how this earlier equation

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.970
is different than the one I just wrote.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.770
Here, it's not five x, it's just five,

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.860
and this isn't three, it's three x.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.790
So, if you wanna write it

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.040
in the same form as we have up there,

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.430
you can just swap the
five and the three x.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.660
It doesn't matter which one comes first,

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.970
you're just adding the two,

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.570
so you can rewrite it as y is
equal to three x plus five.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.580
And then it becomes a little bit clear

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.870
that our slope is three, the
coefficient on the x term,

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.730
and our y-intercept is five,

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.230
y-intercept.

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.750
Let's do another example.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.530
Let's say that we have the equation y

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.600
is equal to 12 minus x.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.170
Pause this video and see if
you can determine the slope

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.763
and the y-intercept.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.240
All right, so, something
similar is going on here

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.630
that we had over here.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.620
The standard form, slope intercept form,

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:09.770
we're used to seeing the x
term before the constant term,

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.320
so we might wanna do that over here.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.320
So, we could rewrite this

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.680
as y is equal to negative x plus 12,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.980
negative x plus 12.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.570
And so, from this, you
might immediately recognize,

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.780
okay, my constant term,

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.510
when it's in this form, that's my b,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.690
that is my y-intercept.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.270
So, that's my y-intercept
right over there.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.890
But what's my slope?

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.150
Well, the slope is the
coefficient on the x term

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.780
but all you see is a negative
here, what's the coefficient?

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.160
Well, you can view negative x

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.710
as the same thing as negative one x.

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.710
So, your slope here is
going to be negative one.

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.030
Let's do another example.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.030
Let's say that we had the
equation y is equal to five x.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.550
What's the slope and y-intercept there?

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:59.383
At first, you might say,

00:02:59.383 --> 00:03:01.860
hey, this looks nothing
like what we have up here.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.110
I only have one term

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:04.920
on the right-hand side
of the equality sign.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.780
Here, I have two.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.340
But you could just view
this as five x plus zero,

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.110
and then it might jump out at you

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:15.480
that our y-intercept is zero

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.860
and our slope is a
coefficient on the x term.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:20.260
It is equal to five.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.890
Let's do one more example.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.170
Let's say we had y is
equal to negative seven,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.583
what's the slope and y-intercept there?

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.600
Well, once again, you might say,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.300
hey, this doesn't look
like what we had up here,

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.960
how do we figure out the
slope or the y-intercept?

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.700
Well, we could do a similar idea.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:39.360
We could say, hey, this is the same thing

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.360
as y is equal to zero times x minus seven.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.510
And so now, it looks just
like what we have over here

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:48.820
and you might recognize

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.180
that our y-intercept is negative seven,

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.320
y-intercept is equal to negative seven.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.890
And our slope is a
coefficient on the x term,

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.850
it is equal to zero.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.190
And that makes sense.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.710
For a given change in x, you
would expect zero change in y

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:09.053
'cause y is always negative
seven in this situation.
