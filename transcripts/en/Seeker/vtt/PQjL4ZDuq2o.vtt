00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.759
What do your phone, the sun, the stove, far-off
black-holes and the palm of your hands all

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:05.779
have in common?

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:06.939
Radiation, baby.

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:12.830
It's everywhere.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.120
Up and atom friends, Trace here emitting and
absorbing radiation at your eyeballs for DNews!

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:27.170
When I say radiation, most people do this,
but to be honest, radiation on it's own isn't

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:28.520
necessarily harmful!

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.649
The term radiation is super broad, gamma rays
shooting out of stars is radiation, heat coming

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:37.589
off the pavement on a hot day is radiation,
and the radio waves picked up and emitted

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:42.520
by cell phones, radio stations and WiFi networks
are radiation too -- even the light you're

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.109
seeing on this screen is radiation.

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:49.629
The thing is, even though radio, microwave,
visible and infrared, are technically radiation

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:56.539
-- when we SAY radiation, most people think
of dangerous high-energy particles called

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:57.539
IONIZING radiation.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.750
That includes Ultraviolet, X-Rays, or Gamma
Rays.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.730
Which makes sense, but what can that stuff
DO to you when it hits your body?

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.950
In 1927, in the journal Science, Hermann Muller
published a paper showing the ionizing radiation

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.200
of x-rays damaged the genes of fruit flies.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.690
He later won a Nobel prize!

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.160
Ionizing radiation is high-energy radiationâ€¦
it's got a lot of energy.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.290
When this high-energy particle or wave hits
an atom, the atom absorbs the energy; causing

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:25.470
the weakest electron to pop off!

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.020
This creates a charged atom called an ion!

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.910
Do that enough and all that high-energy can
cause chemical changes in our tissue.

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.890
If ionizing radiation affects too many cells
at once, or we absorb a bunch over time -- that's

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.180
when we risk sickness, radiation poisoning,
or eventually cancer.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.560
That happens when the radiation changes how
things fit together.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.880
It might knock off bits of our DNA, mess with
its structure, or (at worst) break one or

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.440
both strands of the DNA double helix!

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.000
That alone isn't damaging, but sometimes,
the body makes mistakes when repairing that

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.490
damage -- causing wide-spread issues.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.000
But chances are, you'll never have to worry
too much about how much radiation you're being

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.320
exposed to.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.650
Radiation dosage is measured in sieverts.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.790
One sievert in a short time can cause radiation
sickness and 10 can kill.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.420
But because we'd never really encounter a
full sievert, scientists usually talk in millisieverts.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.959
Every year, just living on Earth exposes us
to 2.4 mSv in natural background radiation,

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:22.959
and its fine.

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.510
A chest x-ray, for example, is 6.8 mSv, so
while ONE X-Ray won't hurt you, a bunch throughout

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.680
your life (or all at once) can damage your
tissues enough to cause health problems.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.750
If that weren't complicated enough, there
are different types of ionizing radiation!

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.980
Alpha, Beta, Gamma and X-Rays; listed in increasing
energy levels.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.840
Alpha radiation is the slow big fella, it
can't really penetrate your body, but it's

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.950
essentially a handful of protons and neutrons.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.290
Beta is basically a tiny fast-moving electron;
it can penetrate your body, but not some denser

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.700
materials, like aluminum.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.489
Then there's gamma radiation, which is just
fast-moving pure energy!

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.439
It's so small it can pass between your cells,
but if it hits your DNA it'll mess you up

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.910
-- though it won't make you green and invulnerable.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.519
In fact gamma so high energy, it can pass
though you, aluminum and even concrete walls

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:14.209
-- though not lead it's too dense.

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:16.030
X-Rays are like gamma rays, but lower energy.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.439
In the end, you probably don't have to worry
a LOT about ionizing radiation.

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:24.540
UV rays can damage DNA over time, so wear
sunscreen.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:28.180
X-Rays are highly regulated, and hopefully
you haven't spent too much time near unbridled

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:31.510
nuclear reactions, or exposed yourself to
cosmic rays.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.400
Most radiation is just regular non-ionizing
stuff.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:39.920
Heck, even humans emit infrared radiation
in the form of heat and some ionizing radiation

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.409
that we absorb from food, like bananas.

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:43.409
It's everywhere!

00:03:43.409 --> 00:04:10.059
And though some of it can damage you, it's
not all bad.
