00:21:17.360 --> 00:21:20.889 align:start position:0%
ones I think the customer lifetime value
is<00:21:17.779><c> a</c><00:21:17.990><c> difficult</c><00:21:18.679><c> thing</c><00:21:18.740><c> to</c><00:21:19.039><c> compute</c><00:21:19.899><c> anyway</c>

00:21:20.889 --> 00:21:20.899 align:start position:0%
is a difficult thing to compute anyway
 

00:21:20.899 --> 00:21:23.440 align:start position:0%
is a difficult thing to compute anyway
so<00:21:21.259><c> I</c><00:21:21.830><c> mean</c><00:21:22.340><c> we</c><00:21:22.460><c> basically</c><00:21:22.850><c> use</c><00:21:23.090><c> the</c><00:21:23.240><c> same</c>

00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:23.450 align:start position:0%
so I mean we basically use the same
 

00:21:23.450 --> 00:21:25.450 align:start position:0%
so I mean we basically use the same
techniques<00:21:23.899><c> that</c><00:21:24.110><c> everyone</c><00:21:24.889><c> use</c><00:21:25.039><c> so</c><00:21:25.190><c> we</c><00:21:25.279><c> don't</c>

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:25.460 align:start position:0%
techniques that everyone use so we don't
 

00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:28.139 align:start position:0%
techniques that everyone use so we don't
do<00:21:25.580><c> anything</c><00:21:25.789><c> specific</c><00:21:26.509><c> for</c><00:21:26.990><c> younger</c><00:21:27.499><c> ones</c>

00:21:28.139 --> 00:21:28.149 align:start position:0%
do anything specific for younger ones
 

00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:30.820 align:start position:0%
do anything specific for younger ones
but<00:21:29.149><c> what</c><00:21:29.389><c> Rajan</c><00:21:29.960><c> mentioned</c><00:21:30.409><c> about</c><00:21:30.619><c> the</c>

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:30.830 align:start position:0%
but what Rajan mentioned about the
 

00:21:30.830 --> 00:21:34.690 align:start position:0%
but what Rajan mentioned about the
younger<00:21:31.549><c> ones</c><00:21:31.820><c> is</c><00:21:32.029><c> quite</c><00:21:32.509><c> true</c><00:21:32.720><c> that</c><00:21:32.899><c> they</c><00:21:33.700><c> can</c>

00:21:34.690 --> 00:21:34.700 align:start position:0%
younger ones is quite true that they can
 

00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:36.279 align:start position:0%
younger ones is quite true that they can
switch<00:21:35.059><c> from</c><00:21:35.090><c> different</c><00:21:35.600><c> apps</c><00:21:35.779><c> if</c><00:21:35.960><c> they</c><00:21:36.110><c> get</c>

00:21:36.279 --> 00:21:36.289 align:start position:0%
switch from different apps if they get
 

00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:39.100 align:start position:0%
switch from different apps if they get
