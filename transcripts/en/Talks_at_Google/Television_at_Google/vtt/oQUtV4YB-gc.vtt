00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.250
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks so much.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.402
Thank you.

00:00:08.402 --> 00:00:09.610
I think we're going to start.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.160
We're going to go
straight into cooking.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.300
TY PENNINGTON: Let's
go right into the food.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.660
EMERIL LAGASSE: Really?

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.730
OK.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:15.990
How's everybody doing?

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.099
I wasn't expecting that.

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.640
TY PENNINGTON: So this is what
we do on the show, by the way,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:22.140
too.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.940
We have our home
cooks, which I think

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.720
makes this show so
much more different

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.190
than any other
cooking show that's

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.020
ever been on for
several reasons.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.599
One, you can actually finally
smell it and taste it.

00:00:33.599 --> 00:00:36.140
So you get to use your senses
that you haven't had to before.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.905
EMERIL LAGASSE: Just
like they will today.

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:38.210
TY PENNINGTON: Exactly.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.640
And the beauty of it is,
while we're on set, too,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.310
he's letting me know immediately
when somebody's in the weeds.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.024
He's like, that's
not going to work.

00:00:45.024 --> 00:00:46.190
I was like, how do you know?

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.320
He was like, I'll
tell you later.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.317
But he just knows.

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:52.150
But the beauty of it
is just being on there,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:53.940
we get to eat incredibly well.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.234
Because he can't stand
Kraft Services, because they

00:00:57.234 --> 00:00:58.650
don't stack up to
what you can do.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.524
So we all eat pretty
well, just like you guys

00:01:00.524 --> 00:01:02.590
are going to eat today.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.700
So to tell us what we're
doing, Emeril, today.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.491
What are we having?

00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:09.620
EMERIL LAGASSE: When we
discussed coming here

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.400
with my friend
Tiffany and her team

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.620
and our team--
first of all, I want

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:17.150
to thank my right hand
here, Alain Joseph,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.090
for making this all possible.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:20.300
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.060
As always.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.410
It's been early this morning,
also starting at Times Square.

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.280
But thank you.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.040
So we talked about
doing something

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.050
that maybe you could all walk
away with and try to do this,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.640
maybe, sometime at home or
on the weekend or whatever.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.400
And that is, if
you go to Louisiana

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.120
and go to New Orleans,
you got to have gumbo.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.500
And so we thought,
why not teach one

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.290
of my favorite gumbos,
chicken and sausage gumbo?

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.050
So prior to Ty and
I coming out here,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:00.720
we took a whole chicken, just
a regular a whole chicken.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.290
If you want an organic, you
can do an organic chicken.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:04.460
TY PENNINGTON: And we
jerk the hell out of it.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.335
EMERIL LAGASSE: Yeah.

00:02:05.335 --> 00:02:06.736
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:06.736 --> 00:02:08.660
EMERIL LAGASSE: Few
sprigs of thyme,

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.660
covered it with water
after we washed it.

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:16.020
And we brought it
up to a simmer,

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.090
and we just simmer the
chicken for about 45

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.900
minutes until the chicken
was-- and what we have is we

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.380
have the chicken meat.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.530
Take the skin off.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.400
We have the chicken
meat from the chicken,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.920
and then we also have the stock.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.140
And why the stock is a
little darker than a regular,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.520
basic chicken stock is that we
roasted the bones after that

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.472
and then reapplied the
bones to the original stock

00:02:40.472 --> 00:02:41.930
to give it a little
bit more color.

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.050
TY PENNINGTON: How did
you roast the bones?

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.135
EMERIL LAGASSE:
Just roasted them.

00:02:44.135 --> 00:02:44.880
TY PENNINGTON: No kidding?

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.630
EMERIL LAGASSE: Yeah,
in a little roasting

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.741
pan in the oven.

00:02:47.741 --> 00:02:48.740
They get a little brown.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.059
They get a little caramelized.

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:51.850
And then we added that
to the broth to just

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.620
give it a little bit more color.

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:57.050
And some people would do that,
maybe, with a tomato product.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.250
But in this particular
gumbo, no tomato.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.250
It's very, very simple
from that point on.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.830
And the key to a great
gumbo is the roux.

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:16.780
If you take the time and
learn how to do the roux,

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.380
it's not about high heat,
because it's about the color.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.890
It's all about the color.

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.320
You smell that?

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.134
You smell that?

00:03:25.134 --> 00:03:27.550
That's the roux that's happening
right here, because we're

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.784
starting to get that
chocolatey color.

00:03:29.784 --> 00:03:31.450
TY PENNINGTON: Always
go with cast iron?

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:32.980
EMERIL LAGASSE:
Cast iron is best.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.200
If you don't have cast iron,
you could use stainless.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.970
You could use nonstick,
what you have.

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.460
But cast iron is a really
good source of heat.

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.330
So we got chicken.

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.371
We got our stock, and now
we've started our roux.

00:03:46.371 --> 00:03:47.280
What's in the roux?

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.970
It's half flower and
half oil, vegetable oil.

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.210
I don't use any peanut
oils or those type

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.510
of oils which have a great
smoking point, only because

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.080
of people with allergies,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.342
So I just do either vegetable
or canola oil and flour.

00:04:02.342 --> 00:04:03.550
Yeah, you can do that, Tyler.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:04.383
That would be great.

00:04:04.383 --> 00:04:07.280
No, no, seriously, I mean that.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:08.850
Because what I
want to show you is

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.130
that when you're cooking, when
you're cooking with roux, which

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:14.740
is the thickening
agent, there are

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.390
many stages of where roux is at.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:22.440
The first stage, which is
called the blonde roux,

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.110
it's not about how
high the heat is.

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.029
You guys can see that?

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:27.070
I forget where I am here.

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:27.570
OK.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.030
This is the first stage of
the roux, a blonde roux.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.932
Then if you continue
to keep cooking it,

00:04:34.932 --> 00:04:37.140
then you're going to get a
little bit darker in color

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.180
like that.

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.020
And those of you that
enjoyed-- I hope you

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.680
enjoyed the gumbo
upstairs-- or downstairs.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:45.950
I forget where we are.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.330
But that was probably the
color roux that the chef did,

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:50.140
not so dark.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:51.660
I'm going a lot darker.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.570
I'm going a lot heartier,
a lot more rustic.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.410
Then the next stage
that you bring the roux

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.000
up a little bit more.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.090
And this is all about
temperature, about heat,

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.070
about length of time,
and about stirring.

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.160
You have to stir.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:07.270
How do I know when the roux
is perfect for my gumbo?

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.370
It's easy.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.560
It's two beers.

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.150
By the time you can
drink two beers,

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.050
the roux is absolutely perfect.

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.300
TY PENNINGTON: You know, it
does taste better already.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.730
EMERIL LAGASSE: On a bad Sunday,
I burn the roux purposely

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:24.180
so I can have two more beers.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.140
It's a great excuse.

00:05:27.965 --> 00:05:31.760
TY PENNINGTON: I'm trying
to get this right for me.

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:33.492
It's getting darker
because of the heat.

00:05:33.492 --> 00:05:35.700
You sure it's not burning
a little bit on the bottom?

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:36.390
EMERIL LAGASSE: No, no.

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:37.550
That's why you want to sir that.

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.560
TY PENNINGTON: Well,
it's getting a little hot

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.280
down there.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.010
EMERIL LAGASSE:
You got to stir it.

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:44.079
And you don't want a hot spot.

00:05:44.079 --> 00:05:44.995
Stirring it real good.

00:05:44.995 --> 00:05:45.520
TY PENNINGTON: No.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.519
My dog had one of those.

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:47.780
You do not want those.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.600
EMERIL LAGASSE: No, no, exactly.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.100
Now, the next thing
that we're going

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:54.050
to do once the roux is ready is
we're going to add a trinity.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.160
And in classical cooking,
everywhere in the world,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.090
they have a mirepoix, which is
carrots, celery, and onions.

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:04.010
But only in Louisiana do
you have celery, onions,

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:06.440
and bell pepper, which
is called a trinity.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.390
Sometimes it's the holy trinity.

00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.010
OK?

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.460
Stir that around good.

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:12.270
Thank you, Ty.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.340
Now, the next thing
about Louisiana cooking,

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:21.222
about New Orleans food, is
about the layers of flavor.

00:06:21.222 --> 00:06:22.430
TY PENNINGTON: Amen, brother.

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:24.554
EMERIL LAGASSE: The seasoning
is very, very simple.

00:06:24.554 --> 00:06:29.240
We're going to use a couple of
bay leafs, two or three, which

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.660
is from the laurel tree.

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:32.985
We're going to use salt.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:35.750
Look.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.960
This is not difficult now.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.200
And we're going to
use cayenne pepper.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:46.220
Those are the basic seasonings
in most all Louisiana cooking.

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.170
Very, very simple.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.880
TY PENNINGTON: Love it.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.690
EMERIL LAGASSE: Now,
what we're going to do

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:52.460
is once we start building
this and we're layering this,

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.685
then we're going to come
back and re-season it.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:58.585
Did I get you?

00:06:58.585 --> 00:07:00.043
TY PENNINGTON: I'm
just guessing we

00:07:00.043 --> 00:07:03.080
may need a little
moisture in there soon.

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.342
EMERIL LAGASSE: Maybe
you need another beer.

00:07:06.342 --> 00:07:07.800
TY PENNINGTON:
That's what we need.

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.930
EMERIL LAGASSE: All right.

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:12.830
So once this cooks about
six to eight minutes

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:16.649
and we start getting
flavor out of the trinity,

00:07:16.649 --> 00:07:18.440
then the next layer
that we're going to add

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:23.080
is andouille sausage
or smoked sausage.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:26.880
Andouille, preferably, which is
a spiced pork smoked sausage.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:30.440
But if you can get a
smokey smoked sausage,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.410
that will work as well.

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:35.700
Chorizo will work, mostly
the Portuguese type.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:37.090
Not the dry cured type.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.120
It gets a little bit oily,
and it has a lot of paprika.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.670
So it'll bleed a little bit.

00:07:41.670 --> 00:07:43.150
TY PENNINGTON: Can you
get andouille sausage just

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.450
about anywhere?

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.908
EMERIL LAGASSE:
Just about anywhere

00:07:44.908 --> 00:07:47.910
now, you can get an andouille,
in most grocery stores.

00:07:47.910 --> 00:07:51.450
So as you can see,
very basic ingredients.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.730
The hardest part
was making the roux.

00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:57.970
And that roux took about 45
minutes to come together.

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:00.010
And then the trinity,
and then salt, cayenne,

00:08:00.010 --> 00:08:01.810
and bay leaf is where
we are right now.

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:03.420
We've already
boiled the chicken.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:06.150
We've already taken the
chicken off the bone.

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:07.680
We got the meat.

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:12.780
So now, basically we're going to
add another ingredient, garlic,

00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:14.560
which is one of my
favorite things.

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:20.190
TY PENNINGTON: I'm
with you on that.

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:21.160
EMERIL LAGASSE: You
with me on that?

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.530
TY PENNINGTON: I love it, man.

00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.480
There can never be enough
butter or garlic, right?

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:25.438
EMERIL LAGASSE: I know.

00:08:25.438 --> 00:08:26.450
Exactly.

00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:27.880
OK.

00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:30.810
So how dark was the roux?

00:08:30.810 --> 00:08:33.130
Just to let you know, this
is the color that it was.

00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:34.620
This is what we
took out of there

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.200
before we started adding that.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:38.260
It's about 45 minutes or so.

00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:40.460
Slow, medium heat.

00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:43.435
You've got to keep stirring it,
preferably with a wooden spoon.

00:08:43.435 --> 00:08:45.050
TY PENNINGTON: See, you've
kind of gone from a Pinot

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.910
to a Cab is what
you've done, right?

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.100
EMERIL LAGASSE: Exactly, Ty.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:48.080
Exactly.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:51.330
Now what we're going
to do-- very simple,

00:08:51.330 --> 00:08:53.670
is now we're going to
start adding the liquid.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:55.150
The liquid should
be cold, which is

00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:57.300
why you want to make
the stock in advance.

00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:01.450
So if you want to buy stock,
you can buy preferably maybe

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:04.750
a low sodium chicken
broth, chicken stock.

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:06.850
Now we're going
to add the liquid.

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:09.910
And the liquid has to be
cold, because this is hot.

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:12.660
So if we added hot to hot,
then what we're going to do

00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:13.930
is get lumps.

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:16.560
If we added cold to cold,
we're going to get lumps.

00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:19.235
So one has to be hot,
one has to be cold.

00:09:19.235 --> 00:09:20.610
And now what we're
going to do is

00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:22.151
we're going to add
our broth in here.

00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:28.070
Now, using the roux-- if you
could just work that right in,

00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:29.600
Ty, that would be great.

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.410
When you're using the roux,
or any thickening agent,

00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:39.040
it'll never be at its full
thickening ability or maximum

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:41.980
ability until it
comes to a boil.

00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:43.510
When it comes to a
boil, that's when

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:45.580
you're going to know how
think it's going to be.

00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:47.240
And it's only going to
get thicker as it cooks.

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.750
Because as it
cooks, you're going

00:09:48.750 --> 00:09:50.530
to have evaporation,
which then you're

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:52.050
going to have concentration.

00:09:52.050 --> 00:09:55.121
So you've got to keep that a
little bit into consideration.

00:09:55.121 --> 00:09:55.620
OK.

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.000
Everybody with me so far?

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.240
There's a big test
at the end of this.

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.320
OK.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.660
Now the biggest part--

00:10:07.917 --> 00:10:12.875
TY PENNINGTON:
He's like, I know.

00:10:12.875 --> 00:10:16.170
EMERIL LAGASSE: The biggest
part now, folks, is making sure

00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:17.810
that we come up to
the boil-- so we're

00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:23.270
going to turn that heat
up-- and to let it cook.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:26.790
Now, a good gumbo, especially
one rustic like this,

00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:29.900
is going to take about at least
an hour and a half on simmer.

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:30.740
Let it simmer.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.930
You've got to let those
flavors all meld together.

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.740
We're going to taste it.

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:37.114
We're going to re-season it.

00:10:37.114 --> 00:10:38.780
So when we taste it,
we're going to say,

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:44.570
well, it needs more salt,
it needs more pepper.

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:46.926
This is one that we have.

00:10:46.926 --> 00:10:48.220
TY PENNINGTON: Thank you.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.053
EMERIL LAGASSE: Hot.

00:10:51.338 --> 00:10:54.480
TY PENNINGTON: Oh,
that's horrible.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.640
Wow.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.020
Where did the wine come from?

00:11:00.020 --> 00:11:02.950
How'd you get that little
touch of wine in there?

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.650
EMERIL LAGASSE: Knowing
Alain, my right hand,

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:07.650
he has already re-seasoned it.

00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:09.120
But that's when
you would say, OK,

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.250
I want a little bit more
salt, or it has enough pepper,

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:15.540
or I would like a
little bit more pepper.

00:11:15.540 --> 00:11:21.720
You can always serve this on the
side, some sort of hot sauce.

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.500
Tabasco is good.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.250
It's a little vinegary.

00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.910
I like crystal.

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.740
It's one of my favorites.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:34.010
And also, this is what they
call file gumbo or file powder.

00:11:34.010 --> 00:11:36.050
So if we added file
powder into that,

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:39.350
now we'd have a chicken,
sausage, and file gumbo.

00:11:39.350 --> 00:11:41.140
Does that make sense?

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:43.260
So this is always usually
assured on the side

00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:47.500
if people want that flavor,
unless it's a file gumbo.

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:49.500
Now, here's what
we're going to do, Ty.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:55.860
Always serve with rice.

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:56.876
You know what I think?

00:11:56.876 --> 00:11:58.620
I think we could jack
this one up, too.

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:03.380
What do I mean by that?

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:04.740
Let's add more chicken.

00:12:04.740 --> 00:12:07.354
Why not?

00:12:07.354 --> 00:12:08.520
Let's add some green onions.

00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.316
TY PENNINGTON: I always
say more is more.

00:12:11.316 --> 00:12:13.030
EMERIL LAGASSE: Let's
add some parsley.

00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.865
If you want to just
mix that in for me.

00:12:14.865 --> 00:12:15.320
TY PENNINGTON: Sure.

00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:16.778
EMERIL LAGASSE:
Thank you, brother.

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:20.970
Oh yeah.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:23.500
TY PENNINGTON: I'll tell
you, you Cajuns really know

00:12:23.500 --> 00:12:25.580
how to do it, man.

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:26.530
It's true.

00:12:26.530 --> 00:12:30.660
I'm just saying, New Orleans,
it's some of the best food

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:33.270
not just in America,
but in the world.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:34.226
EMERIL LAGASSE: Amen.

00:12:34.226 --> 00:12:36.100
So now what we're going
to do is we're always

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:40.750
going to serve that gumbo
with nice steamed rice.

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:44.302
And if you want to get crazy and
do other flavored rice, jasmine

00:12:44.302 --> 00:12:45.510
rice, whatever, that's great.

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:48.300
It's just regular rice.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.229
Little bit of green onion,
a little parsley garnish.

00:12:51.229 --> 00:12:52.145
There you go, brother.

00:12:52.145 --> 00:12:53.560
TY PENNINGTON: So
there's no beans in this?

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:54.110
EMERIL LAGASSE: No beans.

00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:55.330
TY PENNINGTON: No kidding?

00:12:55.330 --> 00:12:55.470
Interesting.

00:12:55.470 --> 00:12:56.345
EMERIL LAGASSE: Try that one.

00:12:56.345 --> 00:12:57.960
TY PENNINGTON: And clearly
I was off on the wine,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.001
because you said nothing.

00:12:59.001 --> 00:13:02.482
[LAUGHTER]

00:13:03.875 --> 00:13:05.500
EMERIL LAGASSE: Where
did you get wine?

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.660
TY PENNINGTON: I don't know.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.820
EMERIL LAGASSE: Other
than where you had lunch.

00:13:07.820 --> 00:13:10.340
TY PENNINGTON: I tasted
it a little bit then.

00:13:10.340 --> 00:13:10.841
Oh, wow.

00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:12.381
EMERIL LAGASSE:
Michael, I don't know

00:13:12.381 --> 00:13:14.100
where you are, because
I can barely see.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:14.600
OK.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.049
MALE SPEAKER: Our
food team now is

00:13:16.049 --> 00:13:17.940
going to bring out
samples of gumbo.

00:13:17.940 --> 00:13:19.010
TY PENNINGTON: Yeah, so
you guys can try this.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:20.551
MALE SPEAKER: So
everyone can try it.

00:13:23.034 --> 00:13:25.325
EMERIL LAGASSE: Michael, do
you want to open things up?

00:13:25.325 --> 00:13:27.479
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:13:27.479 --> 00:13:30.020
So I was going to ask you guys
a few questions about the show

00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:31.960
and about you.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:34.560
I realized I forgot to
intro you guys earlier.

00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:37.810
But one thing I think most
people don't know about you

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:41.890
is that you guys hold the
title of the highest pancake

00:13:41.890 --> 00:13:44.740
stack ever officially in the
Guinness Book of World Records.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:45.200
EMERIL LAGASSE: This morning.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:46.575
MALE SPEAKER: As
of this morning.

00:13:46.575 --> 00:13:49.360
EMERIL LAGASSE: We
broke the record.

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:52.069
202 pancakes, three feet.

00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:54.360
TY PENNINGTON: And the wind
was making it go like this.

00:13:54.360 --> 00:13:55.955
EMERIL LAGASSE: It was scary.

00:13:55.955 --> 00:14:01.720
TY PENNINGTON: But yeah,
Guinness Book of World Records.

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.275
Someone's going to beat us, but
it's not going to be tomorrow.

00:14:05.275 --> 00:14:07.900
MALE SPEAKER: I think one thing
that's interesting is-- Emeril,

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:11.080
we were talking about this--
is that tomorrow, October 3,

00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:16.257
marks your 20th year on Food
TV, which is kind of amazing.

00:14:16.257 --> 00:14:19.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:21.200
So I wondered if you
could talk a little bit.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:23.410
When you started, you were
doing this, basically.

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.910
It was this in front
of an audience.

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.490
EMERIL LAGASSE: Yeah.

00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:29.310
20 years ago tomorrow--
I didn't realize

00:14:29.310 --> 00:14:32.450
it was tomorrow until
Michael brought that up-- I

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:34.670
was starting the Food Network.

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:38.310
And I think I was the third
or fourth employee at the Food

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.810
Network.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:40.600
This is way before
Chelsea Market, which

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:43.350
is where the homeland
is over there now.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:49.310
Basically, there wasn't really
anywhere to shoot 20 years ago.

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:52.460
I had got contacted
about shooting a pilot.

00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:53.840
I didn't even know
what that was.

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:54.923
I thought he flew a plane.

00:14:57.810 --> 00:15:01.490
Called me my restaurant and
told me about this network

00:15:01.490 --> 00:15:04.460
that they were going to start
with food 24 hours a day,

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:06.680
and I thought they were crazy.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.880
And I'll make the story short.

00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:12.690
I worked with this production
house in Nashville.

00:15:12.690 --> 00:15:15.514
I shot two different shows
before the Essence of Emeril,

00:15:15.514 --> 00:15:16.930
which is the
anniversary tomorrow,

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:20.150
and I got fired,
because it was horrible.

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:21.770
And I look at the
tapes now, and I'm

00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:23.260
like, what were you thinking?

00:15:23.260 --> 00:15:25.950
God, this was terrible stuff.

00:15:25.950 --> 00:15:26.979
Because I was a cook.

00:15:26.979 --> 00:15:27.520
I really was.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.853
I didn't know anything about TV.

00:15:28.853 --> 00:15:30.150
I had my head down.

00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:31.340
I was just chopping.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:34.290
And I didn't realize that I
had to make this connection

00:15:34.290 --> 00:15:37.880
with this camera thing over
here and people at home.

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:42.792
So a little over 20 years ago,
I got a call from the president,

00:15:42.792 --> 00:15:44.000
and he said come to New York.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:44.833
And we brainstormed.

00:15:44.833 --> 00:15:47.680
And that's when The Essence
of Emeril idea came.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:52.620
I was universally trained and
classically trained as well,

00:15:52.620 --> 00:15:53.880
and schooled.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:55.740
And the show started.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:59.540
And as years went by with
The Essence of Emeril,

00:15:59.540 --> 00:16:01.480
it did make it 12 seasons.

00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.520
And then somewhere around
the sixth or seventh season,

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:05.770
I was going to quit.

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.730
I was just tired
and really wanted

00:16:07.730 --> 00:16:10.290
to be back in my
restaurants and only

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:11.470
focusing on the restaurants.

00:16:11.470 --> 00:16:13.730
But that didn't
happen, because they

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:16.700
lured me to do this
show called Emeril Live.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:21.210
So Emeril Live had
a run for 10 years.

00:16:21.210 --> 00:16:25.380
And it was a great
ride and a lot of fun.

00:16:25.380 --> 00:16:28.850
And my whole point of
ever starting television

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:30.720
was just to make it evolve.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:33.064
And if I could take the
intimidation factor--

00:16:33.064 --> 00:16:34.480
it certainly wasn't
for the money.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.950
Because they paid me $50
a show when I started.

00:16:37.950 --> 00:16:39.560
It's the truth.

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.340
And it was a set up like this,
and it was really makeshift.

00:16:43.340 --> 00:16:45.430
But it is what it is.

00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.930
It's 100 million people
now in about 19 countries.

00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:51.010
And it was an amazing ride.

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:53.535
And then I have done
some other shows.

00:16:53.535 --> 00:16:56.160
I'm doing another show right now
for the Cooking Channel called

00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:57.220
Emeril's Florida.

00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:58.350
But I'll tell you what.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:02.370
Working with Ty Pennington,
I've never had more fun

00:17:02.370 --> 00:17:05.829
and never have worked with
a more professional guy

00:17:05.829 --> 00:17:06.600
in television.

00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:08.792
TY PENNINGTON:
Don't make me cry.

00:17:08.792 --> 00:17:09.500
I will punch you.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.740
EMERIL LAGASSE: He's as
hard working as I am,

00:17:11.740 --> 00:17:13.771
and I think I work
pretty damn hard at it.

00:17:13.771 --> 00:17:15.020
And we're having a lot of fun.

00:17:15.020 --> 00:17:17.020
This is a really,
really good show

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:19.510
that debuts tomorrow,
On The Menu.

00:17:19.510 --> 00:17:22.619
It's amazing to see how
these home cooks in America

00:17:22.619 --> 00:17:23.839
have evolved.

00:17:23.839 --> 00:17:26.800
And the food that we're
getting-- huh, Ty?--

00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:30.200
It's amazing quality,
amazing presentations.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:32.040
And these are home
cooks that are just

00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:33.570
looking to fulfill their dream.

00:17:33.570 --> 00:17:35.220
You're all about dreams.

00:17:35.220 --> 00:17:38.280
And these dreams are coming
true for these people.

00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:40.580
They walk away with $25,000.

00:17:40.580 --> 00:17:42.570
I think the money's OK.

00:17:42.570 --> 00:17:45.680
But having the rights
of saying, hey, my dish

00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:48.810
is going on the menu at
Cheesecake Factory or whatever,

00:17:48.810 --> 00:17:52.320
that's a big deal.

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:55.950
And I think it's going to
really click with America,

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:59.490
because for the very
first time, they

00:17:59.490 --> 00:18:02.319
can actually smell
and taste the food.

00:18:02.319 --> 00:18:04.360
TY PENNINGTON: Well, I'm
sure these guys can also

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:05.359
smell what it really is.

00:18:05.359 --> 00:18:09.300
It's also a genius
marketing idea.

00:18:09.300 --> 00:18:10.010
It really is.

00:18:10.010 --> 00:18:10.700
It's genius.

00:18:13.155 --> 00:18:15.530
You've seen something like
that before with Fashion Star,

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.990
but not everybody is going to
want to go out and buy a $600

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:18.489
dress.

00:18:18.489 --> 00:18:22.162
I know I had on hold,
but somebody got it.

00:18:22.162 --> 00:18:23.870
But I think what's
really cool about this

00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:26.430
is that you do give
people, everyday cooks,

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:28.907
a chance to really
show what they can do.

00:18:28.907 --> 00:18:30.240
And they're just like everybody.

00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.342
They're just like us.

00:18:32.342 --> 00:18:34.550
But the other cool thing is
some of these restaurants

00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:36.300
that-- I know in the
city, we don't really

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:40.716
consider restaurant-- but when
I've been across the country

00:18:40.716 --> 00:18:42.340
building homes, this
is where you stay.

00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:44.631
You stay at a Hampton Inn,
and you eat at those chains.

00:18:44.631 --> 00:18:45.960
That's what America is.

00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.870
So it's going to be interesting.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.065
Because I think
anyplace that you've

00:18:50.065 --> 00:18:52.440
got menu item, to be able to
add something new that's got

00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.590
a story, that's got some
zest and excitement,

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:56.430
I think it's also
a really good thing

00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:58.820
for the person who
loves eating there.

00:18:58.820 --> 00:19:00.550
So everybody wins.

00:19:00.550 --> 00:19:02.760
And it's fun, because
you really don't

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.201
know who's going to pull it out.

00:19:04.201 --> 00:19:05.950
Because they second
guess themselves, too.

00:19:05.950 --> 00:19:07.650
Because they have to
go to the process.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:10.090
What is interesting is Emeril
and I are the first ones

00:19:10.090 --> 00:19:11.940
to taste it before anybody does.

00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:14.140
And he doesn't let on anything.

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.064
He's like, uh huh.

00:19:17.064 --> 00:19:19.090
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
I watched the pilot.

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:21.670
And there's a woman who does
something sort of questionable

00:19:21.670 --> 00:19:26.240
with a hamburger and a cake made
out of instant mashed potatoes

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:31.920
on top of it and then
some kind of sweet sauce.

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.730
And I'm curious, what are some
of the worst abominations,

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:38.285
crimes against
food, you've seen?

00:19:38.285 --> 00:19:41.550
EMERIL LAGASSE: That's
probably it right there.

00:19:41.550 --> 00:19:43.570
And hopefully she's
not in the room.

00:19:43.570 --> 00:19:46.220
But anyhow, that's
probably one of them.

00:19:46.220 --> 00:19:48.425
Actually, I went to
Ty, and I said, Ty,

00:19:48.425 --> 00:19:49.800
you're not going
to believe this.

00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.200
He's like, well, what's up?

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:58.190
I said, I think she's
using instant potatoes.

00:19:58.190 --> 00:20:00.270
And I asked her about
it, and she said, yeah,

00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:01.950
that's how we do it at home.

00:20:01.950 --> 00:20:04.280
So I gave her a
chance to change.

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.620
I basically said something
like, do you always

00:20:07.620 --> 00:20:09.230
use instant potatoes?

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:10.425
Like, hello.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.797
So she used instant potatoes.

00:20:15.797 --> 00:20:16.880
Do you remember that dish?

00:20:16.880 --> 00:20:17.460
TY PENNINGTON: Oh yeah.

00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:18.580
Well, I just
remember the texture,

00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:19.746
because everything was soft.

00:20:19.746 --> 00:20:20.862
And I was like--

00:20:20.862 --> 00:20:22.570
EMERIL LAGASSE: You
could have gummed it.

00:20:25.577 --> 00:20:27.410
TY PENNINGTON: Anyway,
I think that's what's

00:20:27.410 --> 00:20:28.970
interesting is that you do--

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.220
EMERIL LAGASSE: But it's real.

00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:31.220
And that's what they do at home.

00:20:31.220 --> 00:20:32.350
TY PENNINGTON: And they
stick to their guns.

00:20:32.350 --> 00:20:33.690
And sometimes he'll
give them some advice,

00:20:33.690 --> 00:20:35.120
and sometimes they'll take
it, and sometimes they'll

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.440
just be like, well,
I know this is good.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.860
I'm going to stick to my guns.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:40.830
But the fun part
is, we don't have

00:20:40.830 --> 00:20:44.520
to be the a-holes, because they
feed a room full of 100 diners,

00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:46.110
and they're the
ones who really say

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:48.130
exactly how they
feel about the meal.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.420
So the critique
comes from people

00:20:50.420 --> 00:20:53.445
that really care about a
good burger or a good pizza

00:20:53.445 --> 00:20:55.890
or whatever they love
the restaurant for.

00:20:55.890 --> 00:20:58.371
And I can't believe we're
eating in front of everybody.

00:20:58.371 --> 00:20:59.370
Oh, they are getting it.

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.074
OK, thank god.

00:21:00.074 --> 00:21:01.990
Because I'm like, man,
this is really amazing.

00:21:01.990 --> 00:21:04.839
You guys should try it.

00:21:04.839 --> 00:21:06.380
MALE SPEAKER: Do
you think home cooks

00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.640
are better now than when
you started, Emeril?

00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:09.340
EMERIL LAGASSE: No
question about it.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:14.190
I think-- we talk about
Food Network 20 years ago.

00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.010
Probably when a group
called The American Cuisine

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:24.140
Symposium over 30
years ago was really

00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:27.420
trying to change the face
and the image of what

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.880
American cuisine was,
because basically,

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:33.710
everybody else around the
world looked at us like a joke.

00:21:33.710 --> 00:21:36.660
We had a few restaurants,
but basically we

00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:39.720
knew hamburgers, and mashed
potatoes, and mac and cheese.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:43.010
And we weren't really
respected for cuisine.

00:21:43.010 --> 00:21:44.500
And I think about
30 years ago was

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.990
when that started to change.

00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:49.890
And there were a lot of
serious pioneers at the time,

00:21:49.890 --> 00:21:53.440
like Alice Waters, like Larry
Forgione, Paul Prudhomme.

00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:57.910
I could go on and on-- Jeremiah
Tower, Jonathan Waxman,

00:21:57.910 --> 00:22:00.830
these guys, still
some of them around.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:04.300
But they really started changing
the face of American cuisine

00:22:04.300 --> 00:22:09.350
and reintroducing
farmers and fishermen.

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.920
Because farmers
and fishermen, they

00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:13.590
didn't think that was
cool 30 years ago either.

00:22:13.590 --> 00:22:15.991
So why should I be a fisherman?

00:22:15.991 --> 00:22:17.490
A, I'm not going
to make much money,

00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.110
but nobody respects
me for what I do.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:23.370
Or why should I grow really
great heirloom tomatoes,

00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:27.470
because nobody understands
and respects what I do.

00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:28.680
So that movement started.

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:32.190
And then 20 years ago, the
reentry of food television

00:22:32.190 --> 00:22:36.520
started again after Julia and
a couple of them out there.

00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:37.430
And it was rough.

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:41.230
It was a rough beginning,
because people still

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:42.870
didn't really quite understand.

00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:46.020
And my approach was really
to take the intimidation out

00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:47.190
of it.

00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:50.730
My approach then, once I finally
learned a little bit what

00:22:50.730 --> 00:22:53.860
I was doing, was that if
I could connect and not

00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.760
make this so intimidating,
and make this comfortable

00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.610
for you to want to maybe
go home and make gumbo,

00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:01.090
then that would be cool.

00:23:01.090 --> 00:23:02.890
And if one person does
that in this room,

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:05.470
then I might have
accomplished something.

00:23:05.470 --> 00:23:06.991
So then the wave hit.

00:23:06.991 --> 00:23:07.990
Then it started hitting.

00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:11.310
And then The Food Network
started getting more popular,

00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:13.000
other things, as we know.

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.950
But there was a long answer.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:15.771
I'm sorry.

00:23:15.771 --> 00:23:18.270
TY PENNINGTON: The one thing I
think we all remember, I just

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:20.610
remember when you ordered
a salad and everything was

00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:21.950
iceberg lettuce.

00:23:21.950 --> 00:23:25.130
And then I remember the
change happening when, wait,

00:23:25.130 --> 00:23:27.160
what's this arugula?

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.425
This is fantastic.

00:23:30.779 --> 00:23:33.445
The more you started to see, the
more you started to experience.

00:23:33.445 --> 00:23:35.000
And I think everyone has.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.290
Now everyone really has become
so much smarter with food

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:42.470
because of shows like Emeril's.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:44.910
MALE SPEAKER: I wanted to
ask you one tech question.

00:23:44.910 --> 00:23:45.960
We're at Google.

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.580
In the world of food or in
the world of a home design,

00:23:48.580 --> 00:23:52.520
is there something you wish
existed-- an app, a device that

00:23:52.520 --> 00:23:56.400
would make your job
and your life easier?

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.770
It does not have to
be a Google product.

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:02.795
TY PENNINGTON: But
aren't they all good?

00:24:02.795 --> 00:24:04.388
MALE SPEAKER: I can't
talk about that.

00:24:10.171 --> 00:24:12.520
EMERIL LAGASSE: We've
come a long way already,

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.877
but that doesn't mean that
you guys are stopping.

00:24:14.877 --> 00:24:16.210
MALE SPEAKER: I want some ideas.

00:24:16.210 --> 00:24:18.137
We need something new.

00:24:18.137 --> 00:24:19.720
TY PENNINGTON: Well,
I would say this.

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:24.400
It's funny-- we're
similar in many ways,

00:24:24.400 --> 00:24:28.480
because I'm old school, but I'm
also new school in the sense

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.619
that I build homes.

00:24:31.619 --> 00:24:33.160
I built some really
new homes, and we

00:24:33.160 --> 00:24:36.070
brought in some incredible
technology that allows you

00:24:36.070 --> 00:24:41.040
to-- these days,
let's be honest,

00:24:41.040 --> 00:24:43.880
your device is what you
plug in to your house now.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:45.290
That's your temperature.

00:24:45.290 --> 00:24:46.770
For the first time,
it's showing us

00:24:46.770 --> 00:24:48.186
how much energy
we can save, which

00:24:48.186 --> 00:24:49.750
I think is a very
positive thing.

00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.282
It's keeps the mind
about, oh yeah,

00:24:51.282 --> 00:24:52.490
this is how much I'm wasting.

00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:53.460
Holy shit.

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.950
I didn't realize that until
someone finally showed me

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.990
how much I'm wasting.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:02.240
But at the same time,
you're kind of nervous

00:25:02.240 --> 00:25:06.109
that if it all goes down,
where's the manual button.

00:25:06.109 --> 00:25:07.650
So I think we're
all a little nervous

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.200
about relying so
much on technology.

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.820
Because it's like--
I don't know,

00:25:14.820 --> 00:25:16.394
it's that uncle
that, you sure you

00:25:16.394 --> 00:25:17.810
want to keep your
kids over there?

00:25:23.250 --> 00:25:26.630
He's doing these crazy,
wild things, man.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:31.525
And he's really good with these
inventions, but I don't know.

00:25:31.525 --> 00:25:33.650
I think I've made my point
in a really bizarre way.

00:25:33.650 --> 00:25:34.310
But yes.

00:25:40.150 --> 00:25:43.610
But at the same
time, the technology

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:46.369
has also helped the
home building industry

00:25:46.369 --> 00:25:47.160
completely as well.

00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.626
So it's hard to say.

00:25:48.626 --> 00:25:49.750
What would you say in food?

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:51.210
EMERIL LAGASSE:
For me, food wise,

00:25:51.210 --> 00:25:57.160
I think, Michael, is that I
have trouble cataloging, which

00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.810
is something that you
do extremely well.

00:25:59.810 --> 00:26:00.900
What do I mean by that?

00:26:00.900 --> 00:26:02.770
So I have an apartment here.

00:26:02.770 --> 00:26:04.020
I have a house in New Orleans.

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.250
I have a house in Florida.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:09.240
And I'm a crazy cookbook junkie.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.160
So I have cookbooks everywhere.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:13.500
I have a test kitchen in
New Orleans at home base,

00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:16.060
and we have thousands of books.

00:26:16.060 --> 00:26:18.470
So for me, it's
about cataloging.

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.400
I haven't quite figured that
out where I can bring something

00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:29.550
to the stove, and I would have
my catalog based on whatever

00:26:29.550 --> 00:26:33.060
region or country of cuisine
that I was preparing,

00:26:33.060 --> 00:26:37.850
and I could easily get into
it without-- where did I

00:26:37.850 --> 00:26:38.690
put that book?

00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:39.540
Oh, wait a minute.

00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:41.760
Oh no, it's in New York.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:44.020
MALE SPEAKER: So this seems
like a good 20% project

00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:47.600
for someone, for Emeril, to
help him catalog his cookbooks

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.350
and make sure that they're
always there in his tablet

00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:52.070
by his stuff.

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.039
I have one very specific
New Orleans question.

00:26:54.039 --> 00:26:55.580
I was in New Orleans
pretty recently,

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.230
and there's a dish
that you do very well

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:00.060
called barbecue shrimp.

00:27:00.060 --> 00:27:01.560
It's not grilled.

00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.490
It doesn't have barbecue sauce.

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:06.277
I don't understand this dish.

00:27:06.277 --> 00:27:07.360
Why is it called barbecue?

00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:08.050
It's delicious.

00:27:08.050 --> 00:27:09.490
It's very peppery,
Worcestershire.

00:27:09.490 --> 00:27:12.110
EMERIL LAGASSE: Well, I think
probably one of the originals.

00:27:12.110 --> 00:27:14.210
It really started
as a home dish.

00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:18.600
And we're very
fortunate in Louisiana

00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:21.440
and along the coast in
Florida and Mississippi

00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:24.540
to have really, truly an
abundance and easy way

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:27.100
to access shrimp pretty easily.

00:27:27.100 --> 00:27:29.160
Shrimp boats are everywhere.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.410
You go in New Orleans,
you'll find these trucks

00:27:32.410 --> 00:27:35.150
that have ice chest
that are selling shrimp.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:36.680
It's amazing.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:40.610
So my research tells
me that basically it

00:27:40.610 --> 00:27:43.480
was a home dish that
moms and dads used

00:27:43.480 --> 00:27:47.220
to do with a lot of butter,
Worcestershire sauce, which

00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:55.350
is a big staple of the cooking,
garlic, and maybe some onion.

00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:59.270
And then when it
commercialized, it probably

00:27:59.270 --> 00:28:03.300
made its mark at Pascal
Manale's in uptown New Orleans,

00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:05.530
where you have to have a bib.

00:28:05.530 --> 00:28:10.500
Because it's almost like a
vinaigrette, if you will.

00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:12.050
It's like Worcestershire
and butter

00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:14.990
that's separated with a
lot of cracked pepper.

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:19.200
And you dip it, and
you get crusty bread.

00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.210
And no, there's
nobody barbecue sauce,

00:28:21.210 --> 00:28:25.420
and they're not on the grill,
and they're not on the barbie.

00:28:25.420 --> 00:28:27.630
So that's where that started.

00:28:27.630 --> 00:28:34.690
Now, Emeril's this year,
this coming March, actually,

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:38.770
will be 25 years that Emeril's
has been open, my flagship.

00:28:38.770 --> 00:28:43.840
And when I was
creating Emeril's there

00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:47.630
were few dishes that I
wanted to do and create

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:49.750
for a white
tablecloth restaurant.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:50.850
I didn't say fine dining.

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:53.710
I said white tablecloth.

00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:56.850
And one of them was I wanted
to do barbecue shrimp.

00:28:56.850 --> 00:29:01.530
So what we did is we took the
shrimp, and we took the heads

00:29:01.530 --> 00:29:06.440
and took the shells, and we
made an extraction or a barbecue

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.720
base, even though it's
not a barbecue sauce.

00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:13.330
Heavy Worcestershire,
lots of herbs and spices,

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:15.970
pepper, of course,
Worcestershire, lemons.

00:29:15.970 --> 00:29:18.590
And this is reduced down.

00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:20.880
It's a slow process,
a reduction.

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:25.570
It makes not quite a
paste, but more of a syrup.

00:29:25.570 --> 00:29:29.520
And that's what we use, of
course with a little cream

00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.690
and butter, the things
are the good for you.

00:29:31.690 --> 00:29:33.480
And that's our barbecue shrimp.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:36.010
And I created that, and it was
one of the very first dishes

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.630
that we put on the menu.

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.290
And the flavor of
it is just what

00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:41.980
you've experienced,
except there's no mess.

00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.060
It's a knife and fork
deal, and we serve it

00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:47.100
with a petite rosemary biscuit.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.450
So now everybody has
their variation on that.

00:29:49.450 --> 00:29:53.720
But it's also fun to do
at the beach, because it's

00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.310
an easy dish that
you can get shrimp,

00:29:56.310 --> 00:30:00.550
and you can either make a
stock or not with the shells,

00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:03.390
or you basically just
put them in a cast iron

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:06.550
with a lot of butter and parsley
and garlic and Worcestershire

00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:10.290
sauce, and you simmer
them up until they cook,

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:12.030
and you serve them
with crusty bread.

00:30:12.030 --> 00:30:13.510
TY PENNINGTON: But shrimp
are a little tricky, though,

00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:14.530
because you can't
overcook them, right?

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:16.580
EMERIL LAGASSE: You
can't overcook them.

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.380
That's why I say they have
a built-in thermometer,

00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.690
because luckily they turn
that color unless you're

00:30:22.690 --> 00:30:26.140
using a ruby red shrimp.

00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.000
It's like salmon.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.340
They have that color that
they turn, they go, and then

00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:33.010
they turn pink, and you
know that they're perfect.

00:30:33.010 --> 00:30:34.520
But you can't overcook them.

00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.270
MALE SPEAKER: I think
it's time to open up

00:30:36.270 --> 00:30:37.644
to some questions
from the floor.

00:30:37.644 --> 00:30:39.350
I don't know where
the microphone is.

00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:42.136
Is it there?

00:30:42.136 --> 00:30:43.900
TY PENNINGTON: I
didn't have it last.

00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.470
I'm kidding.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:45.227
EMERIL LAGASSE: There are
no questions in the room

00:30:45.227 --> 00:30:46.566
whatsoever.

00:30:46.566 --> 00:30:47.329
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:47.329 --> 00:30:48.120
EMERIL LAGASSE: Hi.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.570
AUDIENCE: What
advice do you have

00:30:49.570 --> 00:30:53.330
for picky eaters and getting
them to expand what they eat,

00:30:53.330 --> 00:30:56.822
particularly the adult
kind of picky eaters?

00:30:56.822 --> 00:30:57.780
EMERIL LAGASSE: Adults?

00:30:57.780 --> 00:30:58.410
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:30:58.410 --> 00:30:59.630
EMERIL LAGASSE: Not children?

00:30:59.630 --> 00:31:00.330
AUDIENCE: No.

00:31:00.330 --> 00:31:03.564
So like smarter than a child.

00:31:03.564 --> 00:31:05.680
EMERIL LAGASSE: Well,
that's what you thought.

00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:14.480
I have a theory, particularly
when it starts with kids

00:31:14.480 --> 00:31:16.790
and it starts at an early age.

00:31:16.790 --> 00:31:18.390
My brother is an example.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:21.270
Growing up, my mom
was a fantastic cook.

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:24.410
God, thanks that
she's still alive.

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.120
He would not eat
anything that she

00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:29.590
made that had celery or
onion or bell pepper in it.

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:33.470
Also, the trinity is a
staple called sofrito

00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:36.170
in Portuguese cooking.

00:31:36.170 --> 00:31:38.890
So she always made
two of everything.

00:31:38.890 --> 00:31:41.060
So she made one the
regular way that she wanted

00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:42.500
and one a different way.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:47.010
And I always used to
think, wow, that's wrong.

00:31:47.010 --> 00:31:51.290
Now he eats it because he has no
choice, because his wife is not

00:31:51.290 --> 00:31:53.430
going to make him
two of everything.

00:31:53.430 --> 00:31:56.210
So he either eats it or not.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:59.050
But going back to
an early age, I

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.470
think that it might have
started from the top.

00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:04.840
Somebody told him
that onions and celery

00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:08.300
or whatever weren't good,
or duck wasn't good,

00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.260
or pheasant wasn't good.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:14.400
My wife grew up right on
the coast in Mississippi,

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:15.520
in Gulf Port.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.050
And when we met,
I always thought

00:32:18.050 --> 00:32:20.810
it was strange that
she wouldn't eat fish.

00:32:20.810 --> 00:32:23.080
And you could see the
ocean from her house,

00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:26.210
but she didn't eat fish.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:29.590
She would eat speckled trout
or she would eat red fish,

00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:33.190
but she wouldn't eat the
other fish from the gulf.

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:34.820
And I couldn't figure it out.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.070
And the reason that I
finally figured it out

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:41.900
was that there's a lot
of bad fish out there.

00:32:41.900 --> 00:32:44.250
And fish should have no odor.

00:32:44.250 --> 00:32:45.290
It should have no smell.

00:32:45.290 --> 00:32:47.520
It should smell like the sea.

00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.500
And maybe she wasn't
getting the greatest fish

00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.830
where they were buying it
unless they went and caught it.

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:59.330
So that was one
mindset for her, that I

00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.092
don't eat a lot of seafood.

00:33:01.092 --> 00:33:02.425
I'm not answering your question.

00:33:02.425 --> 00:33:04.920
AUDIENCE: No.

00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.540
EMERIL LAGASSE: I
could just tell by--

00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:07.831
TY PENNINGTON: I do that a lot.

00:33:07.831 --> 00:33:10.977
EMERIL LAGASSE: Your facial
expression was continually

00:33:10.977 --> 00:33:13.060
getting more and more
pissed off as I was talking.

00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:20.560
Is there anything particular
about this person?

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:23.780
AUDIENCE: No.

00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:24.280
Thank you.

00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.254
That's great.

00:33:28.176 --> 00:33:31.670
EMERIL LAGASSE: I'm
sorry I pissed you off.

00:33:31.670 --> 00:33:35.502
The day is going to
get better, I promise.

00:33:35.502 --> 00:33:38.020
AUDIENCE: So how
did the two of you

00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.940
join forces to create this show?

00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:41.370
Did you know each other before?

00:33:41.370 --> 00:33:44.080
Did one of you call
the other up on a whim?

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:46.330
EMERIL LAGASSE: I'll
give you my version.

00:33:46.330 --> 00:33:48.240
Ty can give you his version.

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:50.274
I've been a big fan of this guy.

00:33:50.274 --> 00:33:51.690
I don't watch a
lot of television,

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:54.030
but I did love his show.

00:33:54.030 --> 00:33:56.570
I loved his connection
with people.

00:33:56.570 --> 00:33:58.430
And then he and I did
a project together

00:33:58.430 --> 00:34:02.790
for Good Morning
America where Ty

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:04.252
rebuilt a hospital for children.

00:34:04.252 --> 00:34:05.710
TY PENNINGTON: Give
kids the world.

00:34:05.710 --> 00:34:06.584
EMERIL LAGASSE: Yeah.

00:34:06.584 --> 00:34:10.050
And I was part of it and
did the food part of it

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:11.679
for the hospital.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:14.090
And we met, and we
sort of connected.

00:34:14.090 --> 00:34:15.960
And what we really
didn't know is

00:34:15.960 --> 00:34:18.310
that his agent was
working on this show,

00:34:18.310 --> 00:34:20.139
and my agent was
working on this show.

00:34:20.139 --> 00:34:23.219
But he and I couldn't really
say anything to each other.

00:34:23.219 --> 00:34:28.639
And then shortly after, Mark
Burnett and his team, Mark

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:32.730
Burnett Productions, said,
hey we got this great show.

00:34:32.730 --> 00:34:34.949
You guys should
think about this.

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:36.690
You guys would be
great together.

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:38.389
And it really has been a blast.

00:34:38.389 --> 00:34:40.659
We're really happy.

00:34:40.659 --> 00:34:41.870
I'm sticking to my story.

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:43.400
TY PENNINGTON: Yeah.

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.110
It's funny, I'm
really good friends

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:48.929
with a lady who works
with Mark Burnett.

00:34:48.929 --> 00:34:51.446
She's a very lady in television.

00:34:51.446 --> 00:34:53.070
I've worked with her
on several things.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:54.750
And she called me
one day and was

00:34:54.750 --> 00:34:57.750
like, hey, I've got this show
idea that I'd like you hear.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:01.440
And I was like, you want
me to host a cooking show?

00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:03.610
She's like, well,
it's more than that.

00:35:03.610 --> 00:35:05.270
And I was like,
OK, let's hear it.

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:07.610
And then she said, you'd
be working with Emeril.

00:35:07.610 --> 00:35:11.320
And I was like, I
like it already.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:16.150
But as she unlaid what
makes the show so different

00:35:16.150 --> 00:35:18.160
and the fact that we're
working with home cooks,

00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.460
that you really are
dreaming, and I realized,

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.640
wow, this is a
chance to really see

00:35:22.640 --> 00:35:24.787
somebody who's got a
passion about something

00:35:24.787 --> 00:35:25.620
really live a dream.

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.079
At the same time,
it's a challenge.

00:35:27.079 --> 00:35:28.661
You don't know what's
going to happen.

00:35:28.661 --> 00:35:29.745
It's got high energy.

00:35:29.745 --> 00:35:33.790
And clearly that's why I was
brought in-- for the energy.

00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:36.750
And what's fun
about Emeril is, we

00:35:36.750 --> 00:35:38.797
didn't really know
each other too well.

00:35:38.797 --> 00:35:41.380
We were both surprised by each
other's sort of sense of humor,

00:35:41.380 --> 00:35:42.850
but we have two
different styles.

00:35:42.850 --> 00:35:45.550
We're sort of like
Bert and Ernie.

00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:50.195
One is like, and is like--
barely says anything,

00:35:50.195 --> 00:35:53.020
but when he says it, it's good.

00:35:53.020 --> 00:35:55.580
So it's fun.

00:35:55.580 --> 00:36:00.720
I think it's a fun
show because he

00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:04.600
gets to lend his expertise
to people who really need it.

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:11.030
Why is that funny?

00:36:11.030 --> 00:36:13.730
And I just get to
lend non-sequiturs,

00:36:13.730 --> 00:36:16.520
which is also my gift.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.825
So it's a lot of fun.

00:36:17.825 --> 00:36:21.136
MALE SPEAKER: I think there
was a question over here.

00:36:21.136 --> 00:36:23.020
AUDIENCE: Thank
you for being here.

00:36:23.020 --> 00:36:26.810
So I'm pregnant, and when I have
my midnight craving for gumbo

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:29.640
but I don't have three
hours to make a roux,

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:34.280
what can I whip up that's the
essence of New Orleans in five

00:36:34.280 --> 00:36:36.837
minutes that will give me that
spicy gumbo taste and then

00:36:36.837 --> 00:36:37.920
I can just go back to bed?

00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:39.816
TY PENNINGTON: That's
a good question.

00:36:39.816 --> 00:36:41.355
EMERIL LAGASSE:
Do you eat pasta?

00:36:41.355 --> 00:36:43.721
AUDIENCE: I eat everything.

00:36:43.721 --> 00:36:45.652
TY PENNINGTON: I'm pregnant.

00:36:45.652 --> 00:36:48.400
EMERIL LAGASSE:
If you have pasta

00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:51.005
and you have this stuff, this
essence stuff, this spice--

00:36:51.005 --> 00:36:52.391
AUDIENCE: Where do you get that?

00:36:52.391 --> 00:36:54.390
EMERIL LAGASSE: It's in
a lot of grocery stores.

00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:56.260
TY PENNINGTON: It's
in the essence aisle.

00:36:56.260 --> 00:36:57.780
Next to Emeril's--

00:36:57.780 --> 00:37:01.010
EMERIL LAGASSE: But any
kind of Creole seasoning.

00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:04.730
And if you even just used
olive oil, not even cream base,

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:08.310
if you used olive oil
and sprinkled that on,

00:37:08.310 --> 00:37:12.210
and you had a protein,
maybe some smoked sausage,

00:37:12.210 --> 00:37:14.610
you'd be really close.

00:37:14.610 --> 00:37:17.423
And that would be less
than 20 minutes, probably.

00:37:17.423 --> 00:37:19.180
AUDIENCE: And Tums for dessert.

00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.263
EMERIL LAGASSE: I'm sorry?

00:37:20.263 --> 00:37:22.390
TY PENNINGTON: Tums, yeah,
to take the edge off.

00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:23.050
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:37:23.050 --> 00:37:23.780
EMERIL LAGASSE: Yeah.

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:25.530
There's nothing wrong
with bananas foster.

00:37:28.407 --> 00:37:29.240
AUDIENCE: Hey, guys.

00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:30.990
Just wanted to say thanks for
taking the time to do this.

00:37:30.990 --> 00:37:31.550
EMERIL LAGASSE: Thank you.

00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:33.140
AUDIENCE: I was
surprised that you

00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:37.200
said you thought home cooks were
better today than in the past.

00:37:37.200 --> 00:37:39.530
With Seamless and everything
now, and going out

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:41.120
to eat-- even when I was
young, it was a special thing.

00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.035
And now that I'm
getting older, it

00:37:42.035 --> 00:37:43.576
seems like everybody
can get take out

00:37:43.576 --> 00:37:46.360
so easily, that food has
because so much more accessible.

00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.180
I would be surprised
if more people were

00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:50.270
cooking at home now than before.

00:37:50.270 --> 00:37:53.010
So I was just wondering if you
had any reason why you thought

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:54.468
people were better
now than before?

00:37:54.468 --> 00:37:56.792
Is just more
information, or what?

00:37:56.792 --> 00:37:59.000
TY PENNINGTON: You probably
got all the good answers.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:01.360
I would say in the
past, it was usually

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.360
one person cooking
in the family.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.100
But I think, let's just say,
modern family has really

00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.820
evolved in all kinds
of different ways.

00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:11.010
So more people are cooking.

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:13.930
But I think there's more ideas.

00:38:13.930 --> 00:38:16.180
There's more visuals.

00:38:16.180 --> 00:38:18.490
Because of cooking shows,
more people are trying it.

00:38:18.490 --> 00:38:20.640
Where some people say,
oh, I can't do it,

00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:21.940
or well, maybe I'll try it.

00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:23.040
So that's what I mean.

00:38:23.040 --> 00:38:26.840
I think there's more volume
of people trying it at home.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:29.400
There's certainly a lot better
restaurants these days, I

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:34.860
think, just because they've
amped up the game a little bit.

00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:37.360
EMERIL LAGASSE: Yeah, the game
has definitely changed a lot,

00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:39.540
and at home as well.

00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:44.150
There are more people in
the household cooking now

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:45.800
than ever.

00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:47.670
You guys are the
kings of that stuff,

00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:49.330
knowing that statistic stuff.

00:38:52.410 --> 00:38:55.220
Just about everybody
I meet these days

00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:59.710
are trying at some level about
cooking, or at least wanting

00:38:59.710 --> 00:39:03.590
to try at some level.

00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:08.530
And then there are a lot
of things that have passed.

00:39:08.530 --> 00:39:12.220
For a while, there
was a craze that folks

00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:15.640
were having these weekend
parties where they were trying

00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:18.990
to do Iron Chef things and
couples against couples

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:21.489
against couples, and a lot of
fun things started happening.

00:39:21.489 --> 00:39:22.780
TY PENNINGTON: Like salmonella.

00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:25.270
[LAUGHTER]

00:39:25.770 --> 00:39:31.744
So I say all around, it's
got nothing but better.

00:39:31.744 --> 00:39:33.160
MALE SPEAKER: I
think we have time

00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.701
for just one more
question over here.

00:39:34.701 --> 00:39:35.452
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:39:35.452 --> 00:39:38.140
I'm curious about your process
for finding the restaurant

00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.640
partners for you show.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:42.550
Was there a level of variety
you were looking for?

00:39:42.550 --> 00:39:44.020
What was the thought
behind who you

00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:48.615
picked to be the restaurants
that choose the dishes?

00:39:48.615 --> 00:39:50.490
TY PENNINGTON: I love
that you pass it to me.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:52.240
Well, thank you so
much for your question.

00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:01.110
I honestly think it was
a simple thing where

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:03.330
TNT put the word
out that look, we're

00:40:03.330 --> 00:40:06.380
going to show that is really
going to showcase home

00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:10.870
cooks in a challenge to put
it on everyday restaurants

00:40:10.870 --> 00:40:13.950
and chains.

00:40:13.950 --> 00:40:17.650
Hats off to some
of the restaurants

00:40:17.650 --> 00:40:18.990
who wanted to take a risk.

00:40:18.990 --> 00:40:21.219
Because it is a risk when
it's a television show.

00:40:21.219 --> 00:40:23.510
But more than that, these
guys, you've got to remember,

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:26.310
they're not just being involved.

00:40:26.310 --> 00:40:28.650
On Friday night
when the show airs,

00:40:28.650 --> 00:40:33.907
Chili's kitchen staff with
restaurants over the country

00:40:33.907 --> 00:40:36.240
are finally understanding
what ingredients are going in.

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.310
Because nobody even
there knows yet

00:40:38.310 --> 00:40:40.526
until the show airs
on Friday night, which

00:40:40.526 --> 00:40:41.900
means that entire
staff has to be

00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:44.990
ready to create that
dish for Saturday.

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:46.510
So it's a big commitment.

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:47.130
And I think--

00:40:47.130 --> 00:40:50.585
EMERIL LAGASSE: And the
execution is incredible.

00:40:50.585 --> 00:40:53.890
TY PENNINGTON: It's
pretty-- well, like I said,

00:40:53.890 --> 00:40:55.590
I think what's
astounding about it

00:40:55.590 --> 00:40:57.260
is it's never been done before.

00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.820
And it is a big step forward.

00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:01.320
But I think it's
one of those things

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:05.670
that as far as integration
goes and as far synergy,

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:07.330
you're still having
good entertainment.

00:41:07.330 --> 00:41:09.829
You're also learning a lot about
food, but at the same time,

00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:13.140
you're also giving--
advertising is changing, too.

00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:16.610
And so if you can deliver
that and it works,

00:41:16.610 --> 00:41:18.570
it could be groundbreaking.

00:41:18.570 --> 00:41:21.552
So it's going to be
interesting to see.

00:41:21.552 --> 00:41:23.260
Again, we haven't
answered your question,

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:26.410
but we have talked for a while.

00:41:26.410 --> 00:41:29.520
EMERIL LAGASSE: I think
that TNT did really

00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:33.270
a super job of getting
the word out in America

00:41:33.270 --> 00:41:35.620
that this was going to happen.

00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:38.310
People then submitted
recipes to them.

00:41:38.310 --> 00:41:42.510
And it was actually a process
that had to go through that.

00:41:42.510 --> 00:41:46.440
And then these
people were selected.

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:48.270
And it's their dishes.

00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:50.180
It could be their
grandmother's, it could

00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.280
be their aunt's, their
uncle's, whatever.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.690
But it's their interpretation
of that dish or their dish.

00:41:55.690 --> 00:41:57.880
And they're doing
everything they

00:41:57.880 --> 00:42:00.800
can to try to get
it on the menu.

00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.420
TY PENNINGTON: To
change it enough

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:06.459
that it would work on the
menu of whatever restaurant

00:42:06.459 --> 00:42:07.250
we're working with.

00:42:07.250 --> 00:42:08.610
EMERIL LAGASSE: That's
an important thing, too,

00:42:08.610 --> 00:42:09.580
Ty, like you just said.

00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:14.440
Because not everything
submitted can possibly

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.780
be either afforded or executed.

00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.030
TY PENNINGTON: And 120
ingredients isn't going to fly.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.090
EMERIL LAGASSE: Exactly.

00:42:20.090 --> 00:42:22.740
TY PENNINGTON: But I think
they did really one of variety.

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:24.949
Because you can't
just have hamburgers.

00:42:24.949 --> 00:42:25.990
You can't just have this.

00:42:25.990 --> 00:42:28.180
You need a variety
of restaurants,

00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:31.650
because you need to hit the
gamut of breakfast, dinner,

00:42:31.650 --> 00:42:33.170
lunch, dessert.

00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:35.930
So you want it to be able
to be constantly changing

00:42:35.930 --> 00:42:40.320
so that there can be surprises
for the taste buds every week.

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.390
EMERIL LAGASSE: And we
have an amazing kitchen

00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:44.697
staff on the show,
really amazing.

00:42:44.697 --> 00:42:46.280
TY PENNINGTON: Great
medic staff, too.

00:42:46.280 --> 00:42:47.570
Just ready at any moment.

00:42:47.570 --> 00:42:51.860
EMERIL LAGASSE: A lot
of Band Aids, flu shots.

00:42:51.860 --> 00:42:56.360
But the pantry has to
be completely stocked,

00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:58.790
because we don't know what
direction they're going to go.

00:42:58.790 --> 00:43:00.900
So it's a really big challenge.

00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:04.520
It's a big shot for them
every other day on the set.

00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:08.500
Because it's not only
proteins, but it's produce

00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:11.397
and the freshest, greatest
ingredients that we can get.

00:43:11.397 --> 00:43:12.480
TY PENNINGTON: It's funny.

00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:18.580
I try and put myself in the
place of one of the home cooks.

00:43:18.580 --> 00:43:20.220
I was thinking to
myself, OK, I think

00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:21.700
I'm good enough that
I can create something

00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:22.950
that maybe somebody would dig.

00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:25.310
But I'm dumb enough to
pitch these really bad ideas

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:27.685
to the corporate executives
just because I'm sitting next

00:43:27.685 --> 00:43:29.620
to them, and they're
just like, what?

00:43:29.620 --> 00:43:31.640
But I'm like, it could work.

00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:38.350
So anyway, my point is that it's
not just creating this dish,

00:43:38.350 --> 00:43:41.240
but then realizing they
have to whip out 40 plates.

00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:43.794
So you mainly go
from this person

00:43:43.794 --> 00:43:45.960
has been cooking for your
family to, oh, by the way,

00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:47.769
you've got to go feed a room.

00:43:47.769 --> 00:43:49.810
And they all have to be
delivered, because each--

00:43:49.810 --> 00:43:52.059
EMERIL LAGASSE: And they're
customers of these places.

00:43:52.059 --> 00:43:54.170
So they know the menu
and their product.

00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:56.240
TY PENNINGTON: And
then it hits you--

00:43:56.240 --> 00:44:00.025
wait, maybe I couldn't do this.

00:44:00.025 --> 00:44:02.400
I can deliver one and be like,
you're going to love this.

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.730
But 40-- what?

00:44:04.730 --> 00:44:07.200
So it's fun.

00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:09.469
And it's a great challenge.

00:44:09.469 --> 00:44:11.510
MALE SPEAKER: Well, I
think you guys have to run.

00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:12.360
They've got a busy schedule.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.500
I want to thank you
guys for coming.

00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:15.125
Please, everyone,
give them a big hand.

00:44:15.125 --> 00:44:18.350
[APPLAUSE]
