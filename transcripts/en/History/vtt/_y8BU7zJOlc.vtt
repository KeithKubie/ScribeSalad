00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.040
- Heahmund!

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.170
In all of this world there
can be no justification

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:05.790
for murdering a servant of God.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.670
I killed Cuthred because
he and the other bishops,

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.790
clergy, and several of
your leading aldermen

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:15.000
formed a conspiracy
to overthrow you

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.170
and then to assassinate you.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.830
If Cuthred was
once their leader,

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.670
who is their leader now?

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.880
I don't know.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.540
But I'm almost certain
he intended to replace

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:27.210
Alfred with Aethelred.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.080
But whether Aethelred is part
of the conspiracy or not,

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.670
I've yet to discover.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.580
Heahmund shall be punished
for his heinous crime.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.080
That is not your
decision, brother.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.750
Alfred is doing what he
thinks is best for Wessex.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.420
And we must support
him, must we not?

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.580
He's my brother.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.380
Of course I support him.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.250
Good.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.670
Ah, Prince Aethelred.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.330
King Harald!

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.580
I will think of you in York.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.580
I left some good
men in charge there.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.500
King Harald Finehair.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.830
Welcome to York.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.750
I am Jarl Olavsonn.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:05.210
I still consider it
part of my new kingdom.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.580
York will only be a
staging post for us.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.080
I'm here to attack Wessex.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.620
After we plunder Wessex,
we'll return to Kattegat.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:16.540
We overthrow its king.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.960
Bjorn Ironside.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.920
My name is Magnus.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.290
I'm Ragnar's son by
Queen Kwenthrith.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.960
I heard you were here.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.380
My half-brothers,
and I had to see you.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.460
We had heard Ragnar
fathered a son in Wessex.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.380
Alfred's family
threw me to the wolves.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.290
And they say that you're
here to support King Alfred.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.250
But how can you do that?

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.540
We are at Alfred's mercy.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.330
He should be at yours.

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.670
Alfred is just as guilty as
his father and his grandfather

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.250
for the death of our father.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.330
My lords, I've
decided to restore

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.830
his grace Bishop Heahmund to
the bishopric of Sherborne.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.830
We cannot and I will not do
without the greatest warrior

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:01.960
for Christ in this kingdom.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.670
[crowd shouting]

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.000
I wish also to announce
my marriage to Princess

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Elsewith of Northumbria.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.330
You will be queen
to a kingdom at war.

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.500
You'll be married to a king who
is in present danger of being

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.330
overthrown and assassinated.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.790
If I were your wife,
I would gladly share

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.830
your dangers and tribulations.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:22.920
I shouldn't be here.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.620
God will punish me.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.330
And help you carry
the terrible burden

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.540
that fate has placed upon you.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.380
My gods won't punish you.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.120
I had not expected
this conversation

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.380
to proceed in this manner.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.620
I would hate you ever
to think me predictable.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.210
I'm a virgin.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.210
I now pronounce
you man and wife.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.000
The king has asked
us to be baptized

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.670
in the Christian faith.

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.500
That way you will no longer
be supporting and harboring

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.210
pagans, but we would
be fellow Christians.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.210
And did you tell him that
there was no way that you

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.880
will renounce our gods?

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.710
I renounce my belief in
Odin and all other pagan gods.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:06.290
We have suffered the loss
of two of our children, Bul

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.080
and Thorgrim.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.880
So now I beg of you all one last
time to please bury your axes.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.080
Our real hope lies
with the child

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.330
that Kjetill's daughter
Thorunn carries in her belly.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.080
Let us drink to the new child.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.250
To the birth of a new child.
ALL: Skol.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.250
She's gone!

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.250
What do you mean gone?

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.580
Thorunn, she's disappeared!

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.580
I don't understand.

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.210
She can't have disappeared.

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.040
Mother told me she'd gone
to pray at the waterfall.

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.540
She felt her time was near.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.420
She wanted to pray to
Freya for a safe delivery.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:44.920
She wasn't there.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:46.880
I shouted, I looked for her.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.790
She disappeared.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.620
You and me are
descended from Odin.

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.920
The fact is, Hvitserk, I am not
just descended from the gods.

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.620
Ivar the Boneless is a god.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.080
You're crazy, Ivar.

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.920
I am not crazy.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.290
I am not.

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.210
That is your mistake.

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.460
I did the impossible.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.750
I am going to be a father.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.460
I am divine.

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:20.210
And to celebrate, we
will make a sacrifice

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:22.380
dedicated to my fellow
gods welcoming me

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.290
into the family of the Aesir.

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.960
But it must be an
important sacrifice

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.290
and must be someone that
the gods will have heard,

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.790
of someone that all the
people will have heard of.

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.790
Someone-- hmm.

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.330
You don't know what
you're saying, brother.

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.500
[chuckling]

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.670
Bring on the sacrifice!

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.920
[crowd cheering]
