00:00:00.085 --> 00:00:03.045
60% or 80% of the activity
that goes on in your brain

00:00:03.211 --> 00:00:08.468
is about deciphering visual data
and visual input that you get.

00:00:09.635 --> 00:00:12.338
There are scientists who've done
a tremendous amount of research on this,

00:00:12.505 --> 00:00:16.600
and it's within 13 milliseconds
that you know what a picture is of.

00:00:16.766 --> 00:00:19.770
You can look at a blurry picture
and you'll know it's a bedroom,

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:21.145
or a kitchen, or a street scene.

00:00:21.271 --> 00:00:23.691
You don't need to see detail.

00:00:24.483 --> 00:00:26.903
The power of photography
is way more complicated

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.103
than people admit to.

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:33.410
And I think there's psychological
and physiological reasons

00:00:33.576 --> 00:00:35.611
that we respond to things
that we respond to,

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:37.871
as well as intellectual
and emotional ones.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:40.700
So it's wildly complicated
and it's terrific.

00:00:40.866 --> 00:00:42.335
It's great, it's great.

00:00:46.005 --> 00:00:49.093
I loved the title of your book,
Photography Changes Everything,

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:51.551
because of course it does.

00:00:52.053 --> 00:00:53.963
And I thought maybe we'd start
with talking a little bit

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:55.306
about that project.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.393
I spent about three years
reaching out to almost 100 people,

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.178
asking them to think how photography
changed what they did,

00:01:04.315 --> 00:01:08.581
because I was very interested
not in the power of images

00:01:08.736 --> 00:01:10.745
as museums often talk about them,

00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:13.323
but in terms
of the consequentiality of images

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.701
and how they really transform things.

00:01:17.536 --> 00:01:20.956
I was sitting in a room with a bunch
of environmental scientists

00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:22.166
surrounded by drones.

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:23.568
Actual drones in the room?

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:25.471
Yeah, drones were all there
on shelves, right?

00:01:25.628 --> 00:01:28.786
And we were talking
about the project they were doing,

00:01:28.923 --> 00:01:33.123
and they were showing me
the kind of schematic God's-eye view

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.146
down through the drone's flight path
where you could look at every image

00:01:36.305 --> 00:01:37.481
that the drone made,

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.393
and each drone
was making 2,000 images a day,

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.533
and that was all really interesting.

00:01:42.686 --> 00:01:44.685
But I turned around and I looked
to the people in the room,

00:01:44.851 --> 00:01:47.691
thinking about Edward Steichen
and aerial photography,

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:51.278
and I said, “Does anybody here
ever think about the history

00:01:51.445 --> 00:01:52.946
of aerial photography
as you're doing this?”

00:01:53.113 --> 00:01:54.448
And they said, “No.”

00:01:54.656 --> 00:01:55.366
–Right?
–Right.

00:01:55.533 --> 00:01:59.810
And I thought, well,
that's a really interesting thing.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:03.430
I mean, photography for the people
in that room was a tool.

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:05.870
They didn't care
about the history of it

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:08.253
and what got them
to where they needed to be

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.388
in terms of images.

00:02:09.546 --> 00:02:12.163
Photography is used by everybody,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.845
and everybody uses it
for all sorts of reasons,

00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:20.015
and images can be beautiful
for all sorts of reasons,

00:02:20.183 --> 00:02:21.878
and useful for all sorts of reasons,

00:02:22.018 --> 00:02:24.061
and consequential
for all sorts of reasons.

00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:28.231
Do you think it's important
to tell a history of photography

00:02:28.398 --> 00:02:32.986
or do you think that
that is sort of a 20th century goal?

00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:37.220
I think it's hugely important to talk
about the history of the medium

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:40.736
because it's not
quite a universal language,

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.238
and the idea that we're all
visually literate is not quite true.

00:02:44.373 --> 00:02:47.368
We can all probably
extract some very basic level

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:48.951
of information from photographs

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:53.311
but I think you have to learn
to understand how images work

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:54.966
and how images are constructed.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.501
Who made the picture,
why did they make the picture,

00:02:57.636 --> 00:03:00.431
who edited the picture,
who cropped the picture,

00:03:00.723 --> 00:03:04.030
who captioned the picture,
what pictures did they leave out,

00:03:04.185 --> 00:03:06.613
what pictures are being censored?

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.986
It's a malleable medium,

00:03:09.148 --> 00:03:11.388
and I think people
need to be aware of that.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:14.546
That's one of the big goals
in visual literacy is for people

00:03:14.695 --> 00:03:17.513
to understand how many different ways

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:20.868
you can make and use
and understand any kind of image.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:26.456
There's nothing like it,
there's no other experience like it

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.896
because when we're
walking around the world,

00:03:29.043 --> 00:03:32.046
you don't have time
to see everything around you.

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:34.613
For a moment,
you can stop something

00:03:34.756 --> 00:03:38.286
and look at it in a way
that you normally wouldn't see it,

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:40.106
and I think that's part
of the real fascination

00:03:40.263 --> 00:03:41.221
with still photography.

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.891
It's a kind of very existential,
philosophical kind of medium.

00:03:45.058 --> 00:03:48.478
It lets you step outside yourself
to kind of look at the world

00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:49.855
in a different way.
