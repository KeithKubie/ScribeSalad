00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.130
&gt;&gt; ERIN McKEAN: DARE—the Dictionary of American
Regional English—really represents the idea

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.400
that every word of American English is worth
study, is worth investigation, and all speakers

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.780
deserve to have their language recorded.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.430
&gt;&gt; EMILY ARKIN: At a high level, DARE as a
dictionary is a project that really shows

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:21.140
a snapshot of what America is like.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.520
It has a very long history, going back to
the early 20th century, based on a large-scale

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.730
survey that involved differences between different
regions and how people used the same language.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.250
&gt;&gt; ERIN McKEAN: The most exciting part of
the new digital edition of DARE is that it

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.710
offers so many more ways to get into the books.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.070
&gt;&gt; EMILY ARKIN: It took several years of brainstorming,
and a lot of thinking about what new things

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.450
we could do in new media and with web technology.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.170
&gt;&gt; ERIN McKEAN: They’ve made a lot of the
data more accessible along different axes.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.512
&gt;&gt; EMILY ARKIN: There’s the dictionary A
to Z, which has the entries and all of their

00:00:53.512 --> 00:00:55.640
definitions and many different senses.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.300
Then there’s also the survey data behind
the scenes, so you can really dig into the

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.970
background of the dictionary that way.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.050
&gt;&gt; ERIN McKEAN: Now you can look and see,
“oh, okay well what words are used in a

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.670
particular region,” “what’s the constellation
of terms used for a particular thing.”

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.240
&gt;&gt; EMILY ARKIN: We have access to all of the
audio recordings, so you can hear audio as

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.850
you’re going through the dictionary with
examples.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.700
&gt;&gt; FIELD RECORDING: “Hush puppies, well
that’s like ham and eggs.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.359
Eggs go with ham, hush puppies go with fish.”

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.350
&gt;&gt; ERIN McKEAN: The experience of flipping
through a paper dictionary, finding what you

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.579
want and then finding a whole bunch of things
that you didn’t know that you wanted, that

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.929
serendipity is really important.

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:34.289
&gt;&gt; EMILY ARKIN: We did try to capture some
of that serendipity in the website.

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:38.380
We have a word wheel, so that you can spin
it and see, “oh, I’ve never heard that

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.749
word before,” or maybe you’re looking
at one word in the alphabet and you see ten

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:42.749
that are nearby.

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:46.990
&gt;&gt; ERIN McKEAN: The ability to personalize
your DARE experience, save what you’ve looked

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.240
up, really make DARE your own, is one of the
things that make people feel that a dictionary

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.429
belongs to them, it’s their tool, it’s
there for what they need.

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.420
&gt;&gt; EMILY ARKIN: If you’re doing a really
specific sociological study, or maybe you

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.530
just want to find out how your own grandmother
spoke, there’s a lot of power to find exactly

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.579
the word you’re looking for.

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.940
&gt;&gt; ERIN McKEAN: Every time you put something
online it’s a new and brave undertaking.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.470
How will a scholar use this, how will a researcher
use this, how will an elementary school student

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.830
who’s writing a report use this.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.030
It’s going to open up DARE to new uses that
we haven’t even thought of yet.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.420
And that’s what makes me really excited
about the digital edition of DARE.
