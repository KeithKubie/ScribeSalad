00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.569
&gt;&gt; Sean: Professor Brailsford - a lot of people
talk about von Neumann architecture and

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.460
we've talked about Babbage; we've talked
about Turing. Who was von Neumann ?!

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.130
&gt;&gt; DFB: We've done a lot about Turing; we've
done a fair bit about Babbage, in the

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.970
generation earlier. In fact a lot of
people, I guess, in the English-speaking

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.269
world would regard Turing, in some way, as
being the Father of Computing. He came up

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.449
with this very important result, in the
mid-thirties, about what was computable,

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.079
and as we now know. to his credit. he
wasn't at all afraid to burn himself with a

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.280
soldering iron and try to create
hardware. Which he did at Bletchley Park

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.680
during the war. So, yes, if he's the Father,
if Babbage was the Grandfather and if Ada,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.260
Countess of Lovelace, was the Great-Aunt,

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.390
then who on earth was John von Neumann?
And why is he mentioned alongside Turing?

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.940
Well right at the outset let's say John
von Neumann was the impossibly talented,

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:09.659
impossibly charismatic, very wealthy,
Uncle to computing. It was he that, in the

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.600
mid-1940s, in a way, made it all happen by
the force of his own personality. And

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.939
kept it, not just in an enclosed
community, but encouraged all those who

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.290
wanted to build general-purpose
computers to come along to this Summer

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.329
School and do it.  But that really, I guess,
is in the future. It's where we've got to

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.880
get to in the von Neumann story. But, yes,
you're quite right Sean, to say that one

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:41.939
of the first phrases that almost any
computer scientist hears about is The

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.430
von Neumann Architecture for computers,
which to a large extent we still follow

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.509
even now - all of, what 60-70 years later. 
So, we've mentioned EDSAC before, we'll

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.040
be coming back to mention this very
important early computer again. But it is

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.780
a von Neumann machine and all it's
saying is [that] it's very simple to build a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:09.569
computer. You need a Store, or Memory as
it's more commonly called nowadays, to

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.180
hold your instructions and your data.
You need a

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.870
control unit, often called a CPU now. And
you need an arithmetic capability - the

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.120
ALU, the arithmetic and logic unit. Again
many of you will know in modern chips

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.579
those two are often combined into what
we just call "the CPU chip" nowadays.

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.019
And you need input devices of various sorts
leading back to people's Teletypes [with] 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.129
input/output devices for backup storage,
disk and so on. You need to be able to do

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.739
input and output. So there it is. It's
just one, two, three, four, five boxes - that

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:51.310
is the von Neumann architecture. And it's
very, very similar today. There was a big

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.489
debate at the time about that Store that
Memory. Shouldn't you, for safety's sake,

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:05.430
put the instructions of your program in
a different sort of memory to your data?

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.969
Wouldn't it be safer to do that and
better in some ways? On the other hand,

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:14.469
clearly, if you've got a good memory
technology, that works, the temptation

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:19.659
might be just to put them [instructions and data] 
in separate areas of that same technology and try

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.459
and take some sort of precaution about
them not interfering with each other. In

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.720
EDSAC the only way to get into a
subroutine and get back out of it again

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:35.379
was to over-write part of your program
instructions! Let's just return back to

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:41.470
this incredible character John von
Neumann. How does he fit in alongside

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.560
Alan Turing? Well, like I said, he's the
older, impossibly talented, Uncle. Did

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.060
Turing and von Neumann know each other?
Oh yes they did! They were both, basically,

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.349
trained as mathematicians. Von Neumann - 
it's hard to know where to begin and

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:00.280
where to end. You can't exaggerate enough 
about how

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.349
good he was. He was Hungarian and his
Hungarian name - where they give surnames

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:11.349
first - was, I think, Neumann Janos.
His father was very, very wealthy and

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.139
when one was quite young the family
became ennobled in Hungary. [They] became

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:19.820
basically at the level of Baron - 
hereditary Baron I think

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:25.130
over here. Janos was very talented; he was
a childhood prodigy. He could divide one

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.090
eight-digit number by another eight
digit-number in a fraction of a second

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:35.150
when he was aged about 6. He loved
history; he was a multi-talented polymath

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:41.330
he easily came top of the class he
effortlessly took in detail. And that's

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.360
the first thing that all of his
mathematics contemporaries said about

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.950
him was his sheer speed of picking up
new ideas and seeing the ramifications

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:55.580
of them. So he was notorious even as a
teenager, and as a maths undergrad. He did

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.940
his early education I think up to PhD
level in Budapest. He almost naturally

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:06.620
ended up at a place we mentioned before
in connection with Godel and Hilbert.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:13.360
I'm talking, of course, about Gottingen
University in Germany. So Neumann Janos

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.280
makes the journey, via a PhD, to becoming
effectively the research assistant

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.660
to the superstar David Hilbert at
Gottingen. But because his family

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:27.050
had been ennobled he's not Janos Neumann 
any more - Neumann 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.140
Janos sorry  - he's Johann von Neumann
- impossibly talented. Hilbert his

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.840
supervisor, at a seminar given by Johnny,

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.900
John,  Johann (!)  asked who his tailor was.
Because his impossibly smart

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:49.460
pinstripe suit was just a complete
knockout. So he was a legend almost the

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:55.190
moment he got there and did some
fabulously important work there. It was

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.670
obvious that for somebody of his talents
he was going to get a full Professorship

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:03.650
very quickly indeed. I think he became
impatient, waiting for it to happen at

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.170
any German university. So, in the late thirties 
- '37-'38?  Somewhere around there anyway -

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:15.650
Anyway he got an offer from Princeton, in
New Jersey. And that was, I don't know,

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.380
very timely. It all fitted in together
very well. As part of his tours of Europe,

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.370
giving seminars, and on his way to
Princeton, I think he met Turing in the

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.770
mid-thirties in Cambridge. Because he
gave seminars there

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:35.370
and I think a lot of mutual respect grew
up. I mean, obviously, Turing being in awe of

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:41.400
von Neumann wouldn't be so exceptional.
But after that 1936 paper of Turing's,

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.310
about decidability, following on from
Godel and all that, von Neumann rated

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:51.030
Turing - there was no question about that.
This was evidenced by the fact, you will

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:54.810
recall - those of you who have seen my previous
videos - that Turing also took a

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.349
sabbatical and worked with Alonzo Church at Princeton.

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:02.849
Well, von Neumann was there by that time.
Von Neumann was such a superstar, they not only

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:07.319
made him [full] Professor of Mathematics at
Princeton, at an absurdly early age - 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:12.360
probably about 30, something like that.
But some of you will recall, right next

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.590
door to Princeton - about a mile and a
half across the meadows - is the Institute

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:20.819
for Advanced Study which had been
endowed in the early 1930s by a

00:07:20.819 --> 00:07:26.340
multi-millionaire. And this really was
the ultimate Club to be invited to join.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.139
You've got to be of the quality of
Einstein, who accepted the invitation.

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:35.130
Hermann Weyl one of the founders of
quantum mechanics; Godel - we know about

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:42.090
Godel. Godel was invited to just come
to IAS - Institute for Advanced Study at

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:46.949
Princeton - stay as long as you like. Yes,
you're a Professor; everything found: food

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:52.889
accommodation; the lot. All we want is to
have the greatest minds here. Von Neumann

00:07:52.889 --> 00:07:57.930
was offered a professorship in that
community, I think at age 35 - maybe

00:07:57.930 --> 00:08:03.270
slightly younger. Unbelievably young. He'd
hardly been at Princeton a year or two, as

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:07.979
an ordinary mathematics professor.
Everybody thought "This is a truly

00:08:07.979 --> 00:08:16.789
phenomenal person". He reminded many
people of absolute superstars like

00:08:16.789 --> 00:08:26.880
Newton, Gauss, Euler, Einstein, Hilbert
himself. Even at early to mid-

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:32.880
thirties they could see that potential
in him, there. So, yes, Turing visits

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:41.250
Princeton in 1938 - worked with Alonzo
Church - but also of course had frequent

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:45.600
interactions at seminars with von Neumann
And then came the big question,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.339
if you recall, for Alan Turing: "Should I
return to England and do my patriotic

00:08:50.339 --> 00:08:54.870
duty?" According to Andrew Hodges'
definitive biography of Turing,

00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:58.620
Turing's father was all for Turing
staying in Princeton, you know: "Keep out

00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:03.690
of the war; get a prestigious mathematics
job". And that was underlined by the fact

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:10.710
that von Neumann offered Turing a job. He
basically said: "Turing, would you like to

00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:14.730
be my research assistant at the
Institute for Advanced Study?" Now

00:09:14.730 --> 00:09:18.930
Turing could see, straight away, that would
just make you as a mathematician. 

00:09:18.930 --> 00:09:25.380
You were invited, by the great von Neumann,
to be his research assistant, at IAS!

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.760
Only problem was, I think, first of all, I think
Alan Turing did feel a certain

00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:34.589
patriotism in wanting to come home and
do his bit. There was also the worry that

00:09:34.589 --> 00:09:39.570
at that time von Neumann had not
properly got into computing - he'd not

00:09:39.570 --> 00:09:44.160
turned his considerable talents to
considering it - and for the research

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:50.010
assistantship he wanted Alan Turing to
do quantum mechanics, another of von

00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:54.690
Neumann's great loves. And I don't think
Turing was keen on that because he

00:09:54.690 --> 00:09:58.650
knew from experience, at Cambridge, where
he'd tried doing mathematical physics, it

00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:04.260
really wasn't his arena at all. So he
politely declined with great thanks, came

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:10.880
back to England and the rest, if you like,
is more or less history. Now there's

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:17.640
"Johnny", as he'd now become. Johann von
Neumann speaker of four, five languages

00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:21.990
including Italian and English, once he'd
transferred from Gottingen to Princeton,

00:10:21.990 --> 00:10:27.390
wanted to become the all-American genius.
So he was ... on more formal occasions he

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:33.360
was just John von Neumann but to his
friends he was "Johnny". You can't 

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:38.730
exaggerate enough! I mean, his wife said: "He
can count everything but calories". He was

00:10:38.730 --> 00:10:43.709
fond of food and drink; the champagne
parties! the glitz! the glamour! the

00:10:43.709 --> 00:10:48.810
girlfriends! Good old Johnny - he
absolutely was the antithesis of the

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:53.760
shy mathematician. He was all-
encompassing and everybody who met him

00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:57.160
was just stunned by how he could see 
his way through

00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:06.460
problems in no time flat. And just do
impossible things. And so he was there, in

00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:10.600
a very ,very nice position, Institute for
Advanced Study, even before the

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:14.890
Americans joined the war. But he stayed
there throughout the war. But being who

00:11:14.890 --> 00:11:21.370
he was he was endlessly in demand to be
a consultant and, most famously, along

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:24.790
with people like J Robert Oppenheimer he
was one of the consultants employed on

00:11:24.790 --> 00:11:29.260
the Manhattan Project - the atomic bomb and
the hydrogen bomb. But he was used by the

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:33.760
Army, the US Navy, the Air Force
- everybody wanted Johnny as their

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:40.630
consultant. And this even included, as the
war developed, the fact that one of the

00:11:40.630 --> 00:11:44.320
earliest computers which we have
mentioned in a previous video was

00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.580
University of Pennsylvania, Moore School
of Engineering. They helped develop the

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:54.700
ENIAC which, if you remember, was a vacuum
tube computer running on decimal

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:59.620
arithmetic and initially devoted to
gunnery trajectory calculations. It was a

00:11:59.620 --> 00:12:04.870
bit late in 1946 to be in direct
strategic use in gunnery, Actually Johnny,

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:08.920
who by this time *of course* was a
consultant to the Moore School, devised a

00:12:08.920 --> 00:12:12.850
way, I think, to turn ENIAC into being a
general purpose computer, although it

00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:17.230
wasn't a very efficient one, and I
believe he used it for some calculations

00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:23.070
relevant to the atomic bomb and all that
kind of thing. The natural question

00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:30.220
arising with everybody at the end of the
war went like this: "We all know - or even

00:12:30.220 --> 00:12:35.050
though it's top-secret at Bletchley Park
we have heard gentle rumours - that

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.670
computers are being developed all over
the place and you've always got to say:

00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:43.210
Are they special-purpose? Are they
general-purpose? Are they

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:50.110
binary? Are they decimal? Are they fully
electronic? Or are they electromechanical?

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:54.700
And literally there must have been at
least a dozen machines around that

00:12:54.700 --> 00:13:00.790
satisfied some of these criteria. If you
ask Germans about "Who's the father of

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:05.440
computing?", they'll  say "Konrad Zuse", He
developed electromechanical

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:09.550
machines that were Turing-complete and
calculated things. But they never got

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:13.630
beyond electromechanical. You get on to
electronic ones - you get Atanasoff 

00:13:13.630 --> 00:13:19.120
and Berry's electronic, valve driven,
thing - special purpose though! Could solve

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.570
certain differential equations. And even
Tommy Flowers, and Colossus, we know,

00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:27.400
special purpose: could decrypt Tunny traffic -
Lorenz cipher as it later become

00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:33.130
known as. So, you've got everything
happening that if it's general-purpose

00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:37.060
it's not yet electronic; if it's
special-purpose it is electronic but we

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:41.530
want it to be general-purpose. So, at the
end of the war was the perfect time to

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:47.620
get everybody together and say: "Look, now
that the war's over we all want to find

00:13:47.620 --> 00:13:53.410
the way to do it correctly. To build
general-purpose, probably binary-based

00:13:53.410 --> 00:13:58.810
because they're more reliable, all
electronic digital computers. How do we

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:02.050
do it"? And who better to lead the charge and

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:06.760
run a Summer School, and be associated
with it, than uncle Johnny of course!

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:13.120
And the Moore School at Pennsylvania, to their
great credit, did this. They decided that

00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:18.430
the successor to ENIAC would be a thing
called EDVAC. They said, yeah, it's

00:14:18.430 --> 00:14:21.610
going to take us three or four years to do
this but in the meantime here we are,

00:14:21.610 --> 00:14:28.090
1946, why not all of you, all over the
world, who are interested in the quest to

00:14:28.090 --> 00:14:34.570
build general-purpose, all electronic,
digital computers, probably based on the

00:14:34.570 --> 00:14:40.290
binary system ... we'll hold a Summer School
in the Moore School of Engineering, 1946,

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:45.250
welcome everybody. Did Turing go to it?
He was, I believe, at that time at the

00:14:45.250 --> 00:14:48.660
National Physical Laboratory in the UK
No he didn't.

00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:53.710
Hated conferences did Turing. He wasn't
a clubbable character. He  couldn't stand

00:14:53.710 --> 00:14:58.690
small-talk. Classic shy mathematician not 
at all like 

00:14:58.690 --> 00:15:06.820
von Neumann, right? So Turing wasn't, if you
like, the UK representative there. And one

00:15:06.820 --> 00:15:10.750
wonders whether he would also been held
back by Bletchley Park and the Official

00:15:10.750 --> 00:15:14.589
Secrets Act because he'd only just left a
few years before. The representative from

00:15:14.589 --> 00:15:21.410
the UK was somebody who was Turing's exact
contemporary. They had both done

00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:26.089
mathematics in the early 1930s, at
Cambridge. They had both got first-class

00:15:26.089 --> 00:15:31.700
degrees. Did they get on? Not very well!
But who's this other person? His name is

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:37.850
Maurice Wilkes - Maurice Vincent Wilkes - and
by the vagaries of job allocations

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:42.560
around about World War II, he didn't end
up at Bletchley Park, did Maurice, he ended

00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.260
up in radar. But he knew enough about
mathematics and electronics to be in a

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:56.149
good position to do, or make, a von
Neumann machine in the UK in the period

00:15:56.149 --> 00:16:02.750
from about 1946 onwards. But we'd better
stop there because Maurice and his EDSAC

00:16:02.750 --> 00:16:09.310
is an extra story.
