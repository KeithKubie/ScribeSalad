00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:14.520
Timothy Evans was no saint and there was good
reason for the police to suspect him of murdering

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.110
his pregnant wife and baby daughter.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.500
He and said wife, Beryl, had a long history
of angry quarrels including witnesses stating

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.670
that the couple occasional came to blows with
one another.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.300
Seemingly a constant source of argument was
Beryl being upset with Evans for heavy drinking

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.510
and wasting their money on it and Evans angry
with Beryl for poor housekeeping and her own

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.550
mismanagement of their finances.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.910
Nonetheless, the couple had a daughter in
1948, Geraldine, but this, too, was apparently

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:42.910
a strain.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.760
When Beryl became pregnant again in 1949,
unable to afford to care for a second child,

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.989
the couple decided to obtain an illegal abortion.

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:54.400
When the initial inquiry began, Evans certainly
appeared guilty of murdering his wife and

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.400
future daughter.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.109
After all, the first the police heard of it
was when Evans walked into a police station

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:03.789
on November 30, 1949 and confessed that he
had killed Beryl… albeit accidentally by

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.310
giving her something from a bottle that was
to abort the baby.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.360
As for his daughter, he told them he had placed
her with another family after the death of

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.360
Beryl.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.830
After his confession, the police began an
investigation.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.650
But when they looked for Beryl’s body in
the sewer drain near 10 Rillington Place,

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.830
where Evans claimed he stashed it, they didn’t
find it.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.250
Not only was there no body there, but it required
three men to remove the manhole cover for

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.250
the drain.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.710
Needless to say, they weren’t buying the
story.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.770
Confronted with the information that the body
was not where Evans said it was, Evans gave

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.370
them a rather different tale.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.840
He claimed his downstairs neighbor, former
police officer John Christie, offered to perform

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.040
an abortion for the couple and, after discussing
it, they agreed to have him do it.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.780
According to this version of the story, Evans
went to work the day of the procedure on November

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.280
8, 1949 and, when he returned, Christie told
him the abortion had gone horribly wrong and

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:56.410
Beryl had died.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:00.270
Evans then stated that Christie offered to
dispose of the body and arrange for a family

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.090
to care for Geraldine while Evans got out
of town for a while.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.110
Ultimately Evans agreed to the plan, leaving
the baby Geraldine with Christie and going

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:10.360
to stay with relatives in Wales.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.510
With this new story in hand, the police began
a new search for the body of Beryl, for a

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.480
time coming up empty despite a search of Evans
and Christie’s home.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.000
Finally, on December 2nd, Beryl’s body was
found, as was Geraldine’s- discovered in

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.380
the back garden of the residence where Evans
and Christie lived.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.730
The cause of death of both was the same – strangulation.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.031
When confronted by police about the fact that
not only had his wife not died as a result

00:02:35.031 --> 00:02:39.660
of a botched abortion, but had been been strangled,
and his baby daughter had also been found

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.440
strangled, Evans changed his story once again.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.620
This time, he told the police he’d murdered
Beryl first after an argument about money

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.360
and later murdered Geraldine in the same way
before skipping town.

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.120
Evans’ trial began on January 11, 1950,
and he was convicted a few days later of murdering

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.120
his daughter.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.840
He was not charged with the murder of his
wife because if Evans had been found innocent

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.560
or if a mistrial had occurred, by not lumping
the two charges together, the prosecutors

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.420
could re-try him on the second charge of murdering
his wife.

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.750
Concerning his conviction, the jury only deliberated
for 40 minutes.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.730
His sentence of death by hanging was carried
out on March 9, 1950.

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.670
He was 25 years old at the time.

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.130
So where’s the problem in all of this?

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.330
After all, he confessed to the murders.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.530
Well, it turns out Evans seemingly actually
had nothing to do with the deaths of his pregnant

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.140
wife and daughter, other than trusting the
wrong man.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.350
You see, three years after Evans was executed,
John Christie was evicted from the house in

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.990
question and the tenant who lived in Evans’
former section of the home, one Beresford

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.510
Brown, was given access to the now vacant
section of the house in March of 1953.

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.670
While Mr. Brown was hanging a radio in the
kitchen, he discovered a hidden door that

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:53.160
had been covered with wallpaper.

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.870
Behind it was a pantry.

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.160
Inside the pantry, he found three bodies-
all women, and all strangled.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.390
It turns out that John Christie was a serial
killer of women, with his preferred way to

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.830
kill them being strangulation.

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.120
Further, investigation revealed that when
he performed the murders for which Evans was

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.070
ultimately blamed, he had already killed two
women.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:16.840
The first was a young woman named Ruth Fuerst
in 1943- a prostitute that he confessed to

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.199
strangling on a whim while having sex.

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.520
The second woman, Muriel Amelia Eady, was
a co-worker he confessed to killing in 1944

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.449
after luring her to his house with a promise
of a mixture that would cure her of bronchitis.

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.069
Instead, he tricked her into inhaling burning
coal fumes, with the carbon monoxide present

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:36.449
ultimately causing her to lose consciousness.

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:39.099
After this, he raped and strangled her.

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:43.660
Both of these bodies were found buried in
the garden and had been missed by police when

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.129
they searched for the body of Beryl three
years before.

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.129
Christie’s next victims were Beryl and,
it is thought, the baby Geraldine.

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:54.590
However, interestingly, he denied he murdered
Geraldine, despite Geraldine having been killed

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.389
by strangulation seemingly in the exact same
way as Beryl.

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:03.029
It is worthy of explicitly mentioning again
here that Evans had been convicted of only

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:04.080
the murder of Geraldine.

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:08.270
Had Christie confessed to murdering her, this
would have shed even more negative light on

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:11.900
the police’ investigation and the trial
of Evans.

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:16.339
In any event, after the deaths of Beryl and
Geraldine, Christie confessed to murdering

00:05:16.339 --> 00:05:20.800
four more women, the first of which was his
wife, Ethyl, in late 1952.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:24.139
In the following three months, he went on
a murder-spree, killing a prostitute named

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:28.910
Kathleen Maloney, then a woman known as Rita
Nelson who was in town visiting her sister,

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:33.150
and finally one Hectorina MacLennan, who he
had been helping, along with her boyfriend,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.469
find a place to live in London.

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:38.449
In all three cases, he appears to have first
exposed the women to carbon monoxide until

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.029
they passed out, then raped and strangled
them, and finally wrapped the bodies in blankets

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:47.340
exactly as Beryl Evans’ body had been handled
after her death.

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:53.020
So why did Evans confess to killing his wife
and child and how did investigators miss the

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.740
two other bodies on the premises when searching
for Beryl?

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.979
To answer these questions a commission was
formed to investigate the matter.

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:06.139
This first inquiry, however, as had happened
during Evans’ trial, ignored important evidence

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.029
and ultimately raised more questions than
it answered.

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:15.309
In response, in 1955, private citizens petitioned
the Home Secretary to look into the matter

00:06:15.309 --> 00:06:19.480
further, while at the same time a book on
the subject, The Man on Your Conscience, by

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.150
Michael Eddowes, was published.

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.719
Some time later, journalist Ludovic Kennedy
also wrote about Evans in Ten Rillington Place.

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:32.119
In the end, this second investigation finally
seems to have gotten to the bottom of what

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:33.119
happened.

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:36.849
To begin with, while Evans’ first story
and confession appear to have been genuine

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:40.839
(and seemingly concocted as a way to protect
Christie from any blame in what Evans at the

00:06:40.839 --> 00:06:45.039
time thought was just an accident), the second
confession- the one he made directly after

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:48.539
he apparently was first finding out that his
wife had been murdered and his baby girl was

00:06:48.539 --> 00:06:52.909
not safe with another family, but also dead-
that one was made under threats of violence

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:57.740
from the police officers around him, who dictated
the confession to him and forced him to sign

00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.740
it.

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:02.339
They also don’t appear to have been able
to extract that confession until many hours

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:06.469
into the interrogation, which extended well
into the early morning hours the next day

00:07:06.469 --> 00:07:07.999
after it started.

00:07:07.999 --> 00:07:11.999
This was something Evans would later claim
in court, continuing to profess his innocence,

00:07:11.999 --> 00:07:15.129
including directly before his execution.

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:16.279
Nobody believed him.

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:20.810
As to why the police were so convinced he’d
done it, this appears to primarily be because

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.759
of their own gross incompetence and inability
to come up with a motive for why Christie

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:28.349
would have done it, as Evans claimed.

00:07:28.349 --> 00:07:31.969
On the former point, when the police searched
for the body of Beryl, their search methods

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:36.930
left something to be desired, including not
bothering to check the wash-room the first

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:43.319
time, nor bothering to excavate the small
garden (approximately 5×4 meters) when their

00:07:43.319 --> 00:07:45.419
initial incomplete search turned up nothing.

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:49.490
It was also later noted that a human femur
was being used to prop up a trellis that was

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:53.610
in plain sight in the garden, though it’s
not clear from the evidence at hand whether

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:58.569
this was there when the police were originally
investigating or was placed there after.

00:07:58.569 --> 00:08:02.990
(Christie would later state that almost directly
after the police left the first time, a dog

00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:05.469
dug up the skull of one of his former victims.)

00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:09.740
On top of this, when the officers did eventually
find the bodies of Beryl and Geraldine, they

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.319
told Evans exactly where they were found and
how the murders were accomplished.

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:18.589
Even moderately competent interrogators would
have withheld this information to get Evans

00:08:18.589 --> 00:08:20.869
to admit to it in his confession.

00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:24.620
An even bigger problem was that the police
officers involved also intentionally suppressed

00:08:24.620 --> 00:08:28.890
critical evidence in the case- that workmen
who had repaired the roof of the home in question

00:08:28.890 --> 00:08:32.650
shortly after the murders stated that the
washroom that the police eventually found

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.539
the bodies of Beryl and Geraldine in had not
contained any bodies whatsoever after Evans

00:08:37.539 --> 00:08:39.390
had supposedly stashed them there.

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:43.979
Thus, sometime between the murders and, critically,
after Evans had left town, the bodies had

00:08:43.979 --> 00:08:46.019
been moved into the washroom.

00:08:46.019 --> 00:08:49.640
During the re-investigation, it also came
to light that the police may have not only

00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:54.319
suppressed this information, but forced the
workmen to change their story for the official

00:08:54.319 --> 00:08:55.319
account.

00:08:55.319 --> 00:08:59.240
In essence, the police seem only to have been
interested in evidence that showed Evans was

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.920
not only the murderer, but also that no one
else was involved, a particularly interesting

00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:09.149
fact given that Christie for a time had been
a member of the police force himself.

00:09:09.149 --> 00:09:12.300
Of course, the fact that the bodies were moved
when Evans had been out of town wouldn’t

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.610
have necessarily exonerated him, but would
have shown his second confession could not

00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:20.720
have been accurate either, and likely called
for further investigation into the matter,

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:25.190
particularly into whether Christie was involved
or was, in fact, the murderer as Evans would

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:29.290
maintain throughout the trial and to the day
he was executed.

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:33.620
Another bizarre thing discovered during this
later investigation was that the police accounts

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:36.580
of their original investigation were contradictory.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:41.110
Further, they deliberately destroyed critical
evidence pertaining to Evans’ case before

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:42.430
the re-investigation.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:47.430
Not only that, but they even somehow destroyed
the record book of how and why said evidence

00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:49.130
had been destroyed in the first place.

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:53.740
In the end, the original trial came down to
Christie saying Evans was the murderer and

00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.800
Evans saying Christie did it.

00:09:55.800 --> 00:10:00.060
The jury, and the police investigating before
the trial, believed the former police officer,

00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:03.720
Christie, and because of it, Evans was convicted
and executed.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:08.949
However, owing to the facts discovered during
this second inquiry, Evans was pardoned in

00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:14.600
1966 and his body exhumed to be buried, not
in the prison graveyard, but rather in a Leytonstone

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.600
cemetery.

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.860
BentleyThis brings us to the story of one
Derek Bentley.

00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:22.040
A few years after Evans was executed for a
crime he did not commit and around the same

00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:26.940
time Christie’s true nature was making news,
Bentley and an accomplice, 16 year old Christopher

00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:29.250
Craig, committed the crime of burglary.

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.850
Unfortunately for Bentley, while fleeing the
scene of the crime, Craig shot and killed

00:10:32.850 --> 00:10:35.230
a police officer, one Sidney Miles.

00:10:35.230 --> 00:10:39.440
Due to a quirk of English law, Bentley was
just as accountable for the murder even though

00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:43.040
he didn’t do it and was fleeing when Craig
shot the police officer.

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:48.589
Needless to say, the 1953 execution by hanging
of the 19 year old Bentley, who was also considered

00:10:48.589 --> 00:10:53.120
mentally deficient and whose true crime had
just been that of burglary, did not go over

00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:54.720
well with the general public.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.699
Even the sentencing judge, Lord Rayner Goddard,
who had no choice under English law but to

00:10:58.699 --> 00:11:02.470
sentence him to death, stated he assumed the
young man would be reprieved.

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:07.430
But in the end, Sir David Maxwell Fyfe chose
not to exercise the Royal Prerogative of mercy

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:12.329
in Bentley’s case, to the exasperation of
many, including Lord Goddard who reportedly

00:11:12.329 --> 00:11:16.269
verbally attacked Fyfe for his refusal to
change the boy’s sentence.

00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:19.870
As for Craig, who actually killed the officer,
because he was under 18 at the time, he was

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:24.760
not sentenced to death and ended up serving
a 10 year prison sentence before being released.

00:11:24.760 --> 00:11:30.100
Bentley himself, though dead, in 1993 was
issued a “royal pardon in respect of the

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:33.060
sentence of death passed upon him and carried
out.”

00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:37.760
2EllisFinally, we come to the 1955 case of
one Ruth Ellis.

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.060
She was a model who was executed for the murder
of David Blakely whom she was having an affair

00:11:42.060 --> 00:11:43.060
with.

00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:47.220
Unlike Evans and Bentley, she did in fact
commit the murder in question, but her trial

00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:51.899
was marred by the fact that she seemingly
steadfastly refused to allow her lawyer to

00:11:51.899 --> 00:11:53.519
competently defend her.

00:11:53.519 --> 00:11:56.509
In short, she was determined to be executed.

00:11:56.509 --> 00:12:00.199
As to why she killed Blakely, it was revealed
that he had been cheating on Ellis and had

00:12:00.199 --> 00:12:04.839
regularly abused her, including one beating
resulting in the loss of her unborn child.

00:12:04.839 --> 00:12:08.009
Two weeks after the miscarriage, she shot
and killed him.

00:12:08.009 --> 00:12:12.149
When her lawyer suggested she plead insanity,
she simply told him, “I took David’s life

00:12:12.149 --> 00:12:14.269
and I don’t ask you to save mine…

00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:15.850
I don’t want to live.”

00:12:15.850 --> 00:12:20.000
In accordance with her wishes, her lawyer
didn’t really bother to defend her at all,

00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.040
with even the judge in the case, Justice Cecil
Havers, noting her defense was essentially

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.040
“non-existent.”

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:30.399
It should be noted here, however, that this
same judge instructed the jury to ignore the

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:35.779
extreme abuse Ellis received at the hands
of Blakely and her poor mental health as “according

00:12:35.779 --> 00:12:38.379
to our law it is no defence…”

00:12:38.379 --> 00:12:43.019
The outcry over Ellis’ planned execution
resulted in a petition signed by over 50,000

00:12:43.019 --> 00:12:48.040
people asking for mercy in her case, but no
such mercy was given.

00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.959
Of this, it was written in the Daily Mirror
on the day Ellis’ was executed:

00:12:51.959 --> 00:12:56.689
The one thing that brings stature and dignity
to mankind and raises us above the beasts

00:12:56.689 --> 00:13:01.769
of the field will have been denied her – pity
and the hope of ultimate redemption.

00:13:01.769 --> 00:13:06.470
The medical officer will go to the pit under
the trap door to see that life is extinct.

00:13:06.470 --> 00:13:11.380
Then in the barbarous wickedness of this ceremony,
rejected by nearly all civilised peoples,

00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:13.569
the body will be left to hang for one hour…

00:13:13.569 --> 00:13:17.089
If you read these words of mine at midday
the grave will have been dug while there are

00:13:17.089 --> 00:13:21.350
no prisoners around and the Chaplain will
have read the burial service after he and

00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:26.240
all of us have come so freshly from disobeying
the Sixth Commandment which says, “Though

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.399
shalt not kill”.

00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:31.292
Famed American screenwriter and crime novelist
Raymond Chandler would himself ring in, published

00:13:31.292 --> 00:13:32.292
in the Evening Standard:

00:13:32.292 --> 00:13:35.649
I have been tormented for a week at the idea
that a highly civilised people should put

00:13:35.649 --> 00:13:40.269
a rope around the neck of Ruth Ellis and drop
her through a trap and break her neck.

00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:43.410
This was a crime of passion under considerable
provocation.

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:46.410
No other country in the world would hang this
woman.

00:13:46.410 --> 00:13:49.779
Thanks to outcry over Ellis’ execution,
the Homicide Act was introduced, with the

00:13:49.779 --> 00:13:52.819
goal of reducing the number of capital crimes
in the UK.

00:13:52.819 --> 00:13:57.249
This did little to satiate the masses who
continued to call for the abolishment of capital

00:13:57.249 --> 00:13:58.639
punishment altogether.

00:13:58.639 --> 00:14:02.759
In the end, in part thanks to the cases of
Evans, Bentley, and Ellis riling up the public

00:14:02.759 --> 00:14:07.269
against capital punishment, it was suspended
in the UK for five years by the Murder (Abolition

00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:13.209
of Death Penalty) Act of 1965, which was made
permanent in December 1969, though capital

00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:17.999
punishment could still be dolled out until
1998 for the crimes of treason, espionage,

00:14:17.999 --> 00:14:34.529
and, oddly enough, arson in a royal dockyard.
