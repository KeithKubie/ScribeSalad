00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.380
So we saw in the
previous video how

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:11.240
we can solve linear optimization
problems in LibreOffice.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.680
Let's now try to get
some intuition for what's

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.770
going on by visualizing
our problem.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.230
Since we only have two
decisions, R and D,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.570
we can visualize our
constraints in two dimensions.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.620
We'll plot D on the x-axis,
and R on the y-axis.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.370
We first have
non-negativity constraints,

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.090
so R and D are both
greater than zero.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.530
We can plot the capacity
constraint, R + D less than

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.330
or equal to 166, which is
shown as the red line here.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.260
Our solution has to be
to the left of this line

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.530
according to this constraint.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.460
Now, let's add in our
demand constraints.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.960
The regular seats should be less
than the demand of 100, which

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.250
requires the solution to
be below this blue line.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.180
And the discount seats should
be less than the demand of 150,

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.140
which requires
the solution to be

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.220
to the left of this green line.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.660
Taken together, our
constraints define

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.820
what we call our "feasible
space" or the space

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.170
of all possible values
that our decisions can

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.620
take according to
our constraints.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.430
To find the optimal solution
now in our feasible space,

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.990
we have to use the
objective, 617*R + 238*D.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.410
We can plot this objective
in our feasible space.

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:40.050
So to know how many
seats we should

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.560
sell to achieve a
certain revenue,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.430
we can see different
values of this line.

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.800
So to achieve a
revenue of $20,000,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.729
our solution has to be somewhere
on this line in our feasible

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.120
space.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.440
To achieve a revenue of
$40,000, our solution

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.940
has to be somewhere on this
line in our feasible space.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.110
And to achieve a
revenue of $60,000,

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.300
our solution has to be somewhere
on this line in our feasible

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.120
space.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.690
Since the revenue is increasing
as we move this line up

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.620
and our goal is to
maximize the revenue,

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.000
our optimal solution
will be where

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
this line can't go
any further and still

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.970
be in our feasible space.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.100
So our optimal solution
is at this point

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.430
with a revenue of $77,408.

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.730
As we can see here,
the solution is

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.850
dependent on how the
feasible space was defined.

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.940
In the next video,
we'll see what

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.720
happens if our capacity
and demands change.
